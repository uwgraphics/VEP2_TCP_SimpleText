To the godly Reader.
IT WERE BUT A NEEDLESS labor to make any particular recital of those
points of doctrine which this Church of England at this day does hold and
maintain, for they be at large set out in sundry english books, and
especially in the Apology of the Church of England, and the Defense of the
same: summarily also collected together in the book of Articles agreed upon in
the Convocation at London Anno. 1562. etc. this I dare boldly affirm, that
all points of Religion necessary to salvation, and touching either the
mystery of our redemption in Christ, or the right use of the Sacraments, and
true manner of worshipping God, are as purely and perfectely taught, and by
public authority established in this Church of England at this day, as ever
they were in any church sithence the Apostles time, or now be in any reformed
Church in the world: the which to be true, those that be learned (even among
the myslikers of this present state) can not, nor will not deny.

Likewise: that all Heresies, all corrupt doctrines, all superstitious and
papisticall opinions, have been, and be by the Prince and the Realm banished,
by the learned Bishops and Preachers in word and in vvriting confuted, who
is so blinded with malice, that he cannot see, or so froward and vvilfull
that he vvil not confess?

What shall vvethen think of those men, that are so far from acknovvledging
this singular and unspeakable benefit proceeding from the mere mercy of God,
so far from being thankful for the same, from desiring the continuance of it
with hearty prayers, that by all means possible they seek rather to obscure
it, and to deface it, because in certain accidental points they have not
their fantasies and proper devises. If this be not to set themselves against
God, and to trouble the peace of the Church for external things (which is
schismatic) let the quiet and godly Christian, judge. How much better had
it been for them to have proceeded in teaching necessary points of doctrine,
and exhorting to obedience, to concord, to godly life and conversation, than
thus with no small rejoicing of the wicked, great offense of the vveak
Gospellers, marvelous grief of the Queens majesty, and other that have the
care of government, frovvardly to dysquiet and dysturb the Church, trouble the
happy peace of the common weal, and hazard the whole state of Religion,
they shall one day (if not to late) well understand.

Furthermore it behooves all godly minds, that will not be carried away
with rash and ouerhastie judgment in this controversy, to consider not only
that that I have before spoken of the truth of doctrine publicly received and
confirmed: but also circumspectly to weigh the circumstances of time, place,
person, and the whole state of things, now in this Church and Realm of
England: The regard vvherof in mine opinion, must needs cause in all
discrete heads a stay of judgment, in comparison that the things themselves
barely considered, vvoulde do. The state of this Church of England at this day
God be thanked, is not Heathenish, Turkish, or Papisticall, in which condition
many things might be done, that otherwise are not to be attempted: but it is
the state of a church reformed and by authority and consent settled, not only
in truth of doctrine, as before is noted, but also in order of things
external touching the government of the Church and administration of the
Sacraments. Wherefore the controversy is not whether many of the things
mentioned by the platformers, were fitly used in the Apostles time, or may
now be well used in some places, yea or be conveniently used in sundry
reformed Churches at this day. For none of these branches are denied, neither
do we take upon us (as we are sclaundered) either to blame or to condemn
other Churches for such orders as they have received most fit for their estats.
But this is the whole state of our controversy, when we of this Church, in
these perilous days, do see that we have a great number of hollovve hearts
within this Realm that daily gape for alteration of Religion, and many
mighty and great enemies abroad busily devising and vvorking to bring the
same to pass, and to overthrow the state both of religion and of the Realm:
whether seeing we have a settled order in doctrine and government received and
confirmed by law, it may stand with godly and Christian vvisdome, (with
disobedience to the Prince and law, and with the unquietness of the Church
and offense of many consciences) to attempt so great alteration as this
platform must needs bring, and that for matters external only, and with
such egernesse and bitterness, that they deface and discredit the whole
state of this Church with all the Preachers and Ecclesiastical governors of
the same, as remaining in horrible corruptions and Antichristian deformities,
and thereby fill the mouths of the adversaries with greater matter of
obloquie to deface the gospel, than ever of them selves they had been able to
devise.

Surely I could never read, but that they that should so do, were rather to
be esteemed troublesome and schismatic defacers, than zealous and godly
reformers.

I know that no Church can be so perfect in all points of external government
and ceremonies, but that such as be disposed, may pick some occasion of
quarrelling thereat, though unjustly: therefore the true members of the
Church must not be to light of credit, nor to ready to follow contentious
captains. For S. Paul says: Si quis sit contenfiosus inter vos etc. If any
be contentious among you, we have no such custom, neither the Churches of God.
etc.

Again, when any thing is amiss it must be considered whether the faults
be in the things themselves, or in the persons: for we may not with partial
and corrupt judgment impute the faults of the persons to the things, whether
they be offices or ceremonies, for then should we continually be altering
the state, and never stand steadfast in any kind of government: therefore in
such cases we must seek to reform the abuses in men, we must not pull away
the states and offices, or the things themselves because they be abused by
some men.

But to let this pass and come to the purpose: this Reply of T. C. (which is
of some counted so notable a piece of work) consists of two false
principles and rotten pillars: whereof the one is, that we must of
necessity have the same kind of government that was in the Apostles time,
and is expressed in the scriptures, and no other: the other is, that we may
not in any wise, or in any consideration, reteyne in the Church any thing that
has bin abused under the Pope: if these two posts be vveake, yea rotten (as
I have proved them to be, in this my Defense) then must the building of
necessity fall. Touching the first, it is to be understood, that there is a
double government of the Church, the one spiritual, the other external:
Christ only and none other by the operation of his spirit and direction of
his word spiritually governs his Church, and reignyng in the conscienees of
the faithful, guydeth their minds in all matters of devotion, faith and
holiness: and this is the spiritual kingdom of Christ, so much spoken of in
the scriptures, and specially in the Prophets: of this kind of government I
mean not. The external government has both a substance and a matter about
which it is occupied, and also a form to atteyne the same, consisting in
certain offices and functions, and in the names and titles of them: the
substance and matter of government, must in deed be taken out of the word of
God, and consists in these points, that the word be truly taught, the
sacraments rightly administered, virtue furthered, vice repressed, and the
Church kept in quietness and order. The offices in the Church whereby this
government is wrought, be not namely and particularelie expressed in the
scriptures, but in some points left to the discretion and liberty of the
Church, to be disposed according to the state of times, places and persons, as
I have further declared in my Answer and Defense follovving. Of the second
principle I have also spoken at large there, so that I shall not need to
trouble the Reader any further in these matters.

The proofs that T. C. uses in this his Reply are grounded only upon untrue
allegations and interpretations of the scriptures, vain and childishe reasons,
falsifying the authorities of Doctors and other vvriters, untruly ascribing
that unto them, which they vvrote not, as shall be euide^tlie declared in this
Defense, by the grace of God: and surely I have not read many books wherein
so many gross untruths are to be found, or wherein there is so many
manifest arguments uttered, to prove the ignorance of the author, and lack
of reading ancient and learned vvryters.

Touching his manner of vvriting I shall not need to say much, for any man of
judgment, that reads his book may easily perceive, with what hautines of
mind, what contempt and disdain of others, in what sclaundrous and
opprobrious manner it is written: how often does he repeat M. Doctor, in
contempt either of the degree, or of the person? 370. times is the least:
what other speeches of disdain and reproach does he utter? but I do nothing
at all maruayle at it, for I consider it has been the usual practice of
sectaries and disquieters of Aug. lib. 1. contra Donatist.
the Church. It is true that S. Augustine says, lib. 1. contra Donatist. cap.
11. Nulli schismata facerent si fraterno odio non excaecarentur. None would
make schisms, if they were not blinded with hatred of their brethren. And
again: An non est in schismate odium fraternum? quis hoc dixerit, cum and
origo and pertinacia schismatis nulla sit alia, nisi odium fraternum. Is there
not hatred of brethren in schisms? who would say so? seeing that the
beginning and continuance of schism proceeds from no other cause, than from
hatred of our brethren. I must therefore say with M. Zuinglius: Scio quibus
conuitijs and quantis furoribus illorum Lib. de Baptis.
hic me exponam. I know to what reproaches and to how great rages of theirs I
make my self subject. And I will conclude with him. Quamuis miris conuitijs
nos perstringere, and Eodem.
nouis quotidie clamoribus mordereno^ des^a^t etc. Although they maruelouselie
slander us, and daily with new clamors, revile and backbite us, yet will I
never leave of the defense of the truth before their contumacie be made known
to all men. Who so peruseth such learned authors as had great experience of
the like kind of men, he shall find that their especial grace both in
speaking and vvriting, has been in bitter inuectiues against other whom they
have enuyed and hated for some special causes. M. Zuinglius in an Epistle that
he vvriteth before his book de Baptismo, speaking of the Anabaptists says
thus: Hyp^critica illorum humilitas illis fatis nota and perspecta est: qui cum
his aliquando sermones contulerunt, quam scilicet sit illorum oration omni fell
amarulentior. Their hypocritical humility is very well known to those which
have had conference with them: how that their talk is more bitter than gaul.
And in his book de Baptismo, he earnestly protests that he never found any
thing in them, quam saturninam quandam and melan^holicam ingeniorum
contumaciam. etc. and in his book against Baltasar he says that by dispraysing
and reuyling others, they seek to win credit unto them selves. How this
quality agrees with some of our men, and especially with the author of
this Reply, I am content that other men judge. If I my self have in writing,
and in this Defense spoken something more sharply, it must be imputed to mine
infirmity, and yet am I thereunto greatly provoked: but herein as in many
other matters, I submit my self to the judgment of those that have authority
to judge, and of those that be learned: for I am content still to make this the
foot of my song: Errare possum, haereticus esse nolo.

To those that be in authority I only speak as M. Zuinglius did to the
magistrates in his time, upon the like occasion: Quod si hoc cuiuis hominu^
impune facere licebit, In Ecclesiast.
vt quae priuato suae rationis consilio adinuenit, in vulgus spergat,
inconsulta, imo resistente etiam vniuersa totius ecclesiae authoritate, breui
plus errorum, quam fidelium and Christianorum in ecclesia erit cernere. If it
be lawful for every man to publish abroad among the people those things which
he has devised of his own head, before he has consulted with the church,
nay against the authority of the whole church, in short time we shall see more
errors in the church, than there be faithful men and Christians. And again,
Si enim boc permittamus vt capitosus quisque and Lib. de Baptis.
male feriatus bomo, mox vt nouum aliquid and insolens animo suo concepit. etc.
If we suffer every hedie and braynelesse fellow, so sone as he has conceived
any new thing in his mind, to publish it abroad, gather disciples, and make a
new sect, in short time we shall have so many sects and factions, that
Christ which scarce with great pain and labor, is brought to unity in every
church, should be divided again into many parts. Wherefore as you have
singularelie and with great vvisdome and labor, already restored the true
religion of Christ, and banished all superstition and erroneous doctrine: So
likewise (as the same Zuinglius says) in those perilous times, wherein Satan
seeks so busily to In his epistle before his book de Baptismo.
entrap us (so that with new co^tentions about external things, he goes
about to trouble those whom the sword of persecution either moved not, or
terrified not) look well about you, note the crafts and subtilties of them:
take heed of the pestilent winds of diverse doctrine, let none trouble the
gospel amongst you, or set you at strife and variaunce. And remember that as
the stream that comes down from the high mountains being caused by much
rain and snow, taking eueriething that it meteth with, before it, the
further it goes the greater strength, and the more abundance of water it
gathers, and first remoueth out of their places small stones, after with
greater violence, casts down strong bridges, yea huge and mighty rocks,
and increases to that strength, that nothing, be it of never so great force,
can resist or vvithstand it: and in the end leueth nothing else behind it,
quam inutilem luctum, quaerelas inanes, and miseram vastatorum agrorum and
segetum formam: but unprofitable mourning, vain complaints, and a miserable
form of the spoiled fields: even so, contentionum pestis, and impia haeresis,
eodem modo progrediens, non quicquam aliud quam turpem and calamito sam rerum
faciem: in florentissimo ante ecclesiae, agro post se relinquit. The plague of
contention, and wicked heresy proceeding in like manner, leaves nothing after
it but a miserable and pitiful face and show of things in that place, which
was before the flourishing field of the church. Consider what the wise man
says Proverb. 17. the beginning of strife is as one that opens the waters.
It had been well if the beginning had been vvithstanded: but seeing that was
neglected, and rather by some furthered than stopped: Yet now it is time to
make up the breach. This is sufficient to you, whose vvisdome and
carfulness is well known to all those that be not with sinister affection
blinded.

Those that be in the Ecclesiastical state (and desirous to keep the peace of
the Church) I have only to admonish, that they be not discouraged from doing
their duties, because of the slanderous reports, and unchristian tauntes and
contumelies, that our unquiet brethren lade them with, knovving that it has
been the usual practice of all sectaries and especially of Anabaptists, who
count them all as wicked, and ungodly, as vvorldlinges, and men pleasers, as
idle and slothful, that conspire not with them in their confused platform.
I may use the same exhortation to you that M. Zuinglius, used in the like
time. Nec quicquam vos moueant, atroces illaecalumniae. etc. Let not those
bitter reproaches Zuinglius (...) Ecclesiast.
and cauilling speeches, (wherewith the Anabaptists and others, studious of
contention, and discord oppress you) move you any thing at all, because you
rather follow Christ, than them: for although they call you wicked, and
infidels, yet your selves best know what your confidence in God is, and what is
your meaning and purpose, so that so often as they accuse you of impiety, or
of infidelity, so often do they minister manifest proofs unto you, that their
spirit proceeds from the father of lies. And marvel not at those bitter
contentions: you know it to be true, that the same Zuinglius also says: Nec
enim aliud est communis illius hostis nostri ingenium. etc. This is the
subtil^e of our common enemy, this is his manner, hereunto does he bend him
self wholly, and sleeps not: that as soon as the lord has revealed the
light of his word, he also by and by sows darnell: this do almost all the
epistles of S. Paul teach us, wherein it is manifestly declared that there
has been always some men Pietatis simulatores potius quam cultores, rather
feyners of holiness than embracers of it, who for certain external and
unprofitable things, doubt not to lay (as it were) grievous stumbling blocks,
to the doctrine of the gospel. Only let us be diligent in our vocation:
earnest against all kind of enemies: fervent in prayers for the preservation
of the Queens majesty, and for the peace of the Church, with the good
success of the Gospel: and vigilant that errors be not published without
controlement: and, God will ere it be long, (if our sins deserve not the
contrary) give peace to this Church, as he has done to other disturbed in
like manner. To conclude, I do charge all men before God and his Angels, as
they vvil answer at the day of judgment, that under the pretense of zeal,
they seek not the spoil of the Church: under the color of perfection they
work not confusion: under the cloak of simplicity they cover not pride,
ambition, vayneglorie, arrogancy: under the outvvarde shevve of godliness,
they nourish not contempt of magistrates, popularitie, Anabaptistrie and
sundry others pernicious and pestilent errors. The Lord make us thankful for
his infinite mercies and singular goodness bestovved upon us in thus long
continuing his gospel: preserving our most gracious and loving Queen: and
ouerthrovving all the conspiracies and devises that the devil has hitherto
invented to molest this state and Church.

A note of such dangerous points of doctrine as are avouched by T. C. in his
Reply: and quoted as they are to be found in this Book.
HE says that Certain of the things which we stand upon are such as if
every hear of out head were a life, we ought to aforde them for the defense
of them: whereby he would insinuate that this Church of England does maintain
some damnable doctrine. page 44. 2 He says, that if the Church be considered
in the whole and general government and outward policy of it, it may be
pure and unspotted: which smells of an Anabaptisticall fancy. page 50. 3 He
affirms, that many things are both commanded and forbidden, of which there
is no express mention in the word, which are as necessarily to be followed or
avoided, as those whereof express mention is made: which sounds to the
confirmation of the very foundation of all Papistrie. page 77. 4 He holds,
that the doctrine of free will is not repugnant to salvation: and yet is it a
doctrine clean contrary to free justification by Christ. page 82. 5 He
says, that all the commandments of God and of the Apostles, are needful
for our salvation: which is a notorious error. page 103. 6 He utterly denies,
that any magistrate can faue the life of blasphemers, contemptuous and
stubborn I dolaters, murderers, abulterers, incestuous persons, and such
like, which God by his indiciall law has commanded to be put to death:
whereby he byndeth the civil Magistrate to the observing of the Judicial laws
of Moses, and condemns this state and government (now used in this realm of
England) of manifest impiety. page 120. 7 He affirms, that in the Churches
of Christ, there be no drunkardes, nor whoremongers, at the least, which are
known: which assertion tends to Anabaptisme. page 176. 8 He says, that what
socuer apparel the magistrate commands the minister to wear, the
commandment can not be without some injury done to the minister: which is to
debar the Magistrates from appointing any kind of apparel to Ministers.
page 265. 9 He says, that those ministeries without the which the Church is
fully builded and brought to periection and complete unity, are not to be
retained in the Church: which is a very dangerous assertion, and may give
occasion of diverse errors. page 307. 10 He holds that it were more safe for
us, to conforinc our indifferent ceremonses to the Turks which are far of,
than to the Papists which are so near: which can not be so, for the Turks
utterly deny Christ, and be void of all Christian ceremonies. page 475. 11 He
affirms, that not only the dignity, but also the being of the Sacrament of
baptism depends upon this, whether he be a minister or no, that do the
minister it^ which if it be true, then be there numbers not baptized, that are
supposed to be baptized, and it must of necessity follow, that they ought to
be rebaptized, which is plain Anabaptisme. pa. 5^8. 12 He says, that with
what lawfulness men may offer themselves to the prayers and hearing of the
word of God, they may also offer themselves to the Lords Supper: which is a
palpable error, page 532. And page 604. he affirms directly to the contrary.
13 He denies, that the church or any man, may restrain the people from bodily
labor, in any of the six days: which is to draw from the Magistrate his
lawful authority, and to give carnal liberty to the people. page 541. 14 He
says, that the life of the Sacraments depends of the preaching of the
word: which if it be true, then is the Sacrament of baptism not to be
ministered to Insants, because they can not hear the word preached, and
indeed this is the ground of Anabaptisme. page 566. 15 He doubts, whither he
may call him minister or no, that can not preach, which being joined with his
former assertion, that the minister is of the being of the Sacrament* it will
fall out, that he counts all those not baptized which have been baptized by
any other, than by preachers. page 568 and. 583. 16 He seems to be of this
judgment, that only those which be of the family of God ought to be baptized:
which is a dangerous error, for not all that be baptized are of the family of
God. page 621. 17 He secludeth the Children of excommunicate persons, and of
prosessed Papists from the Sacrament of baptism, until they be able to make
a confession of their faith: which smells very strongly of Anabaptisme, and
it is a manifest error. page 622. 18 He says, that Princes must remember to
subject themselves unto the Church, to submit their Scepters, to throw down
their crowns before the Church, and to lick the duste of the fecte of the
Church: and by the Church he means the presbytery and Eldership: so that
he would have Princes in as great bondage to his Seniors, as ever they were to
the Pope. page 645. 19 He says, page 646. that the government of the common
wealth, must be framed according to the government of the Church, even as the
hangings to the house: and he affirms that the government of the Church is
Aristocraticall or populare, and therefore his opinion must needs be, that no
government of any common wealth ought to be Monarchical, but either
Aristocraticall or populare: which is a dangerous error, and springs of
this, that he does not distinguish betwixt the essential points of the
government of the Church, and the accidental points of the same: for the
essential points of ecclesiastical government, may well agree with any
lawful state of common wealth, and civil kind of government: as the Gospel
may be truly preached in them all, the Sacraments rightly ministered,
discipline duly erecuted, and such like: but the accidental points of
government (as the manner of electing ministers, the kind of discipline,
accidental ceremonies, and other such like rites and circumstances) may be
varied according to time, place, and persons, and are so to be framed, as they
may best agree with the state and gouernmente of every common wealth. The
ignorance of this distinction has cast. T. C. into a great and perilous error.
20 He both joins with the Papists, in taking from the civil Magistrate
authority in ecclesiastical matters, and also in confirming that error by
their arguments, and none other. page 694. etc. 21 He affirms, that the
reading of the scriptures without the preaching, cannot deliver so much as one
poor sheep from destruction. etc. wherein he is also contrary to himself.
page 784.
A note of certain untruths, and falfied authorities contained in the Reply
of T. C. and are to be found out in this Book, according to the quotation.
HE says, that it appears in the eight chapter of the book of Nehemias,
that the teast of Tabernacles, which was commanded of the Lord to be
celebrated every year, was not celebrated from the days of Joshua the son of
Nun, until the return of the people from their captivity: which is a
manifest untruth, as it is evident. 1. Esdr. 3. and it is also against the
opinion of all the interpreters. page 8. 2 Josias, is alleged for Ezechias.
page 10. 3 This word (especially) is added to the text. 1. Cor. 10 page 86. 4
He opposes Ignatius and Tertullian, to Ambrose and Augustine, as though
Ambrose and Augustine should think it to be lawful to fast on the Lords day,
and the other two thould write the contrary: whereas Ambrose and Augustine
fully agree with Ignatius and Tertullian in that matter. page 99. 5 He mangleth
S. Augustines words, both before, behind, and in the mydest. page 107. 6 Page
144. he falsifieth the words of S. Paul. 1. Tim. 3. and untruly translateth
them. 7 He says that the Israelites when they worshipped the Calfe said, That
they would keep holy day to the Lord Iehoua: which is not true. page 151. 8 He
cites a place out of Justinians code, which cannot as yet be found there,
neither does he faithfully report, but subtly suppress the words which
explane the matter, as they be set down by Illyricus of whom he borrowed them.
Page 184. 9 He says, that Platina writes, that Lodowik the second commanded
the Romans to choose their own Bishop: which is not true, for he only
commended them for so doing, he did not command them. Page 186. 10 He says,
that those which write the Centuries suspect the Cannon of the Council of
Laodicea, which forbids the election of ministers to be committed to the
people, and doubt whether it bea Bastard or no: which is untrue, for the
Authors of the Centuryes make no such doubt. Page 188. 11 He says, that
Hierome wills that the people should have power and authority to choose
their clearks and their ministers: which is not so, for Hierom wills no such
thing. Page 203. 12 He alleges Musculus his words in stead of Ieromes: and
that which only Muscu. says in his common places, he ascribes to Ierom in
his epist. to Nepotian. ead. 13 He says that Nazian. (in an oration that he
writes at the death of his father) confuteth those reasons, that seem to
hinder the election of Ministers by the Church, and yet is there no such thing
to be found in that oration. Page 205. 14 He refers the Reader to the. 6.
and. 7. book of Eusebius, for examples of elections of the people and Clergy
confirmed by the Christian magistrate, namely in the Bishop of Constantinople:
and yet is there no such examples, in those books, neither any mention of any
Bishop of Constantinople. Page 207. 15 He fathereth a manifest untruth upon
Eusebius. lib. 6. touching Origens admission into the ministry. Page 209. 16
He leaves out the words of the Council of Chalcedon, that open the meaning
of the Council. Page 222. 17 He again ascribes Musculus his words to
Jerome. Page ead. 18 He denies that Chrysostom makes a distinction betwixt
Bishops and Elders, when as his words be plain. Page 226. 19 He does untruly
and corruptly allege Theodorete. Page 268. 20 He says, Page 280. that the two
treatises called the Admonition, were written by diverse persons, the one not
knowing the others doings: the contrary whereof is manifestly declared. 21 He
cites Nicephorus corruptly. Page 326. 22 He falsifyeth a place in the first of
John, by a false interpretation, to make it serve his turn. Page 302. 23 He
says that the Centuries allege a place of Ambrose, out of his book de
dignitate sacerdotali, to prove that the office of an Archbishop was not then
come into the Church. Which is untrue, for the Centuries allege no such place
out of Ambrose for any such purpose. Page 337. 24 He says that Hierome and
Augustine speak of Archdeacons, in those places where they only speak of
Deacons. Page 346. 25 The words of Socrates are falsified. Page 350. 26 He
untruly reports the words of Cyprian. Page 257. 27 He falsifieth the meaning
of Tertullian, alluding that to Ceremonies, that Tertullian means of matters
of faith and of salvation. Page 370. 28 He keeps back the words of Theodoret
that explane his meaning. Page 412. 29 An untruth concerning Iereneus, avouched
out of the fifth book of Eusebius. Cap. 3. and. 4. Page eadem. 30 He
peruerteth the words of the Greek scholiast. Page 413. 31 He avouches an
untruth of Theodoret. Page 415. 32 He utters a very uncharitable untruth of
the worthy man M. Jewel, Bishop of Sarisburie. Page 422. 33 He says, that in
the Council of Antioch it appears that the Bishop of the Metropolitan seat
called Synodes and propounded the matters, which were to be handled, and that
it was his office to see, that the Bishops kept themselves within their own
Diocese: and he quoteth the. 9. Canon where no such thing is to be found.
Page 435. 34 He both adds and detracteth from the. 34. Canon attributed to
the Apostles. Page. 439. 35 The. 17. Canon of the Council of Antioche is
untruly alleged. Page. 440. 36 He should say an Epistle of Pope Zachary to
Boniface, and he says an Epistle of Zachary to Pope Boniface, In the which
Epistle he says that this cause scil. Least they should wax vile through the
multitude, is alleged why there should not be a Bishop in every village or
little city which is untrue: for there is no such cause alleged there. 443.
37 He alleges the fifth Cano^ Concilij Tyronnes. for that, that cannot be
found in it. Page 446. 38 He says, that another council (quoting the Council
of Afrike) decreed that the Christians, should not celebrate feasts on the
birth days of Martyrs, because it was the manner of the heathen: which is a
manifest untruth, for there is no such decree in that council. 479. 39 He
says. That Tertuliian would not have the Christians to sit after they had
prayed, because the Idolaters did so: and he quoteth his book de anima, where
there is no such thing written. Page ead^. 40 He fathereth an untruth of
Augustine touching Baptizing by women or in private houses. Page. 522. 41 He
alleges M. Beza in his annotations for that which cannot be found in the^.
Page 584. 42 He says, that if we will take the nature of the sacrament so
straightly as Augustine does, and that there be no sacraments but when as to
the element there comes the word, the circumcision can be no Sacramen^,
which is a gross untruth, for in circumcision there is both the word and the
element. Page. (...). 43 He says that the eldership was most flourishing in
Constantines time, but he notes (...) place, where we may find his saying to
be true. Page. 651. 44 He is greatly deceived about the excommunicating of
Apollinaris, and shows manifest tokens, that either he has not himself read
the story, or that he has read it very negligently, as it is plainly declared
in the Defense. Page. 669. 45 He falsifieth Ambrose. Page. 670. 46 He alleges
a place of Tertullian very deceitfully. Page. 673. 47 He says that Augustine
in his books de Bap. contra Donatistas, (...) that if the most of the people
be in ^ected with the fault which is to be punished, that then no
excommunication ought to be attempted, for because (...) sufficient number of
voices will not be obtained for the excommunication, whereas these words, for
because a sufficient number of voices. etc. are not to be found in these
books of Augustine. Page. 675. 48 He makes an untrue report of the. 10. Canon
of the Council of Anti^h. Page. 682. 49 He alleges that for making
Ecclesiastical laws and ceremonies, which is meant of building and repayring of
Churches, out of Eusebius. lib. 2. de vita Constant. Epist. ad Eusebium. Page.
698. 50 He affirms that this practice continued still in the Churches of God,
scil. that nothing was brought into the Church to be read, besides the word of
God, whereas the contrary is manifestly proved of the same time whereof he
means. Page. 718. 51 He says that S. John in the Apocalips reprehending the
ministers of diverse Churches, did not put to his name unto his book, which is
a manifest untruth, for he adds his name both in the beginning, and in the
end: thrice in the first chapter, and once in the last.
I here omit his manifest wresting of the Scriptures: his wrong collections:
bold assertions contrary to the practice of the Church and truth: and
notorious untruths affirmed by him of the Answer to the Admonition, with
sundry other gross ouersights, because I have noted them in the margent, and
plainly detected them in my Defense to this Replier, and are (for the most
part) noted also in the General Table under these 3. titles. Falsifications of
the Replier: T. C. charged with untruth. T. C. charge the Answer falsely.
Men may err and be deceived: but either to speak nothing truly, or often to
fault in untrue dealing, cannot be a token of the spirit of truth: the which
spirit of truth, God for his Christ's sake, grant unto all those that have a
hearty desire to know the truth.

To the Church of England, and all those that love the truth in it, T. C.
wishes mercy and peace, from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus
Christ.
AS our men do more willingly go to warfare, and fight with greater courage
against strangers, than against their Countrymen: so it is with me in this
spiritual warfare. For I would have wished that this controversy had been
with the Papists, or with either (if any can be) more pestilent and professed
e^mes of the Church: for that should have been less grief to write, and
more convenient to persuade that which I desire. For as the very name of an
enemy does kindle the desire of fighting, and styrreth up the care of
prepa^ng the furniture for the war: So I can not tell how it comes to
pass, that the name of a brother ^aketh that courage, and abateth that
carfulness which sheuld be bestowed in defense of the truth. But seeing the
truth ought not to be forsaken for any man's cause* I enforced my self,
considering that if the Lord might lay to my charge, that I was not for
certain considerations, so ready as I ought to have been, to publishe the
truth, he might more justly condemn me, if being oppugned and slaundered by
others. I should not according to that measure which he has dealte unto me,
and for my small ability defend it, and deliver it from the evil report
that some endeavor to bring upon it.

An Answer to the Epistle dedicated by T. C. to the Church of England. etc.
IT does not appear by the style and manner of writing used in this your book,
that there remains any portion of such natural affection or brotherly love
in you, as you would bear the world in hand, and seem to have by these your
words: For if you should have written against the veriest Papist in the world,
the vilest person, the ignorantest dolt, you could not have used a more
spiteful and malicious, more slanderous and reproachful, more contemptuous
and disdaynfull kind of writing, than you use throughout your whole book: and
truly if you had not these two letters T. C. for your name, yet could I have
easily coniectured by the haughtiness of the style, and contemptuous speeches,
who had been the author of the book, so well am I acquainted with your
modesty, and such experience have I of your myldnesse. But it is well, for
now such as before have thought that you had been sine fell, without gall,
and that butter would not melt in your mouth, may perceive that all is not
untrue that has been reported of you. But what would they farther think if
they should compare (you being that T. C. that I take you to be) your oath
which you once took when you were admitted fellow into T. C. ( Item me buic
Collegio fidelem and beneuolum The oath which the fellows of Tri. Col. in
Cambridge do take at their (...).
futurum, ei and omnibus socijs ac discipulis, atque etiam magistro eiusdem,
non solum dum in eo vixero, sed etiam postea pro virili cum opus sit
beneuolentiam and opem praestituru^. etc.) with this your good will uttered
throughout your whole book? verily you might have answered as well as you have
done, and had better regard both to your oath and to your brethren. But to let
that pass, I doubt whether you mean good faith or no, when you would make us
believe that you take us for brethren: for surely that does not appear either
by the first or. ^. Admonition, or by this your book, if a man consider the
fierceness and fiery heat, almost in every line of them, uttered against us.
In the second Admonition fol. 35. speaking of the Bishops which be now, and
their confederates (as you call them) these words in most spiteful manner be
uttered. And take them for better 2. Admo* fo. 35
who shall, they are no other but a remnant of Antichrists brood, and God
amend and forgive them, for else they bid battle to Christ and his Church, and
it must bid defiance to them, till they yield. And I protest before the
eternal God I take them so, and thereafter will use my self in my vocation,
and many more too no doubt, which be careful of God his glory, and the Churches
liberty, will use them selves against them, as the professed enemies of the
Church of Christ, if they proceed in this course, and thus persecute as they
do. And therefore these be but words of dalyance, when you say, that you
cannot tell how it comes to pass, that the name of a brother s^aketh that
courage and abateth that carfulness, which should be bestowed in the defense
of the truth. In deed it ought to have abated your outrageous and disdayneful
speeches, if old rancour and desire of reuengement, had not gotten in you the
upper hand. For whether you deal with me like a brother, or like an utter
enemy, let the indifferent Reader judge.

What truth you have on your side, and how it is oppugned and slandered by such
as you mean, shall I trust appear, when your Reply is diligently compared
with my Answer. If you had meant the truth in good earnest, you would have
dealt more paynly in replying than you have done: you would have set down my
book, as I have done the Admonition, that the Reader might have compared
both together: and not have mangled it, depraved it, falsified it, and untruly
collected of it as you have done, and almost nothing else, as (God willing)
shall appear. God grant that it be not laid to your charge that you have
hindered Truth, slaundered it, and given the common adversaries occasion to
speak evil of it.

T. C.
And as unto other parts of the Gospel, so soon as the Lord opens a door
for them to enter in, there is for the most part great resistance: So in this
part concerning the government and discipline of the Church, which is the order
which God has left, as well to make the doctrine most effectual, and to give
as it were a sharper edge unto the preaching of the word, as also to be a wall
to keep it, and make it continue amongst us, I see there be sundry lettes,
which do as it were with weapons, stand up to stop the passage, and to
hinder that it should not be settled amongste us.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is true that there is great resistance so soon as the Lord opens any
door to his Gospel, and that by sundry means, and diverse kinds of men, as
the stories of the Church from time to time declare, and daily experience
teaches: it is also true, that many under this pretense of right gonernment,
and restoring of discipline, have and do disturb the Churches wherein the
Gospel is sincerely preached, and the Sacraments rightly ministered, for further
proof whereof, and avoiding of tediousness, I refer you to master Bullinger
Lib. 6. cap. 10. aduersus Anabaptist. To Master Calvin aduersus Anabaptist.
To Master Gualter in his Epistle dedicatorie before his The pretense of
restoring the right government, but a cloak for farther mischief.
commentary upon the first to the Corinthes. Therefore this pretense of
restoring the right government of the Church, with so great disquietnesse of
the same, is but a cover to hyde the further purposes of Satan the enemy of
the peace and quietness of the Church.

T. C.
With the which albeeit I wrestle hand to hand in this book, yet forasmuch
as we have all drunk so deep of the cup of untruth, that we do not only
stumble at blocks, which other men lay in our way, but oftentimes we gather
lettes unto our selves in framing a prejudice against the truth: I thought good
to note shortly what those stumbling blocks are, and although I cannot remove
them, yet to give warning of them, and to lend my hand to the weaker and
simpler sort to help to ouerstride them.

Io. Whitgifte
What these stumbling blocks are, and how you will help the weaker and
simpler sort to ouerstride them, we shall see in the discourse that follows.

The Epist. of T. C. Sect. 2.
The offenses which are taken herein, be either in respect of the cause, or in
respect of those which seek to defend, and promote the cause. The cause is
charged first with newness and strangeness, then as author of confusion, and
of disorder, and last of all as enemy to Princes, magistrates, and common
wealths. For the first, besides that it is no sufficient challenge, to say it
is new and strange, there is no cause why it should be counted new, which is
confessed of those which myslyke it, to have bin for the most part used in the
Apostles times, nor why it should be esteemed strange, which is used now far
and near, of this and that side the sea, and of ne strangers, but of those
which are of the household of faith. And it shall more largely appear in this
book, that this is no innovation, but a renouation, and the doctrine not new,
but renewed, no stranger, but borne in Sion, whereunto (it being before unjustly
banished) ought now of right to be restored.

Io. Whitgifte.
Snrely the offenses are taken both in respect of the persons, and of the
cause: Neither is either the persons, or the cause charged with any thing by
me, but I am ready either to prove it, or to retract it. The antiquity of
it, and the strangeness we must refer to be judged of the Reader, when we
have both written what we can. In the mean time I suppose that your devises
with the circumstances, will appear not only not to be ancient, but very
strange and lately devised: although in such matters antiquity is not
sufficient to prove a thing convenient, except it agree with the circumstances
of time, place, and persons, much less necessary, unless it be in matters
pertaining to salvation, as shall hereafter (God willing) more largely be
declared: where also it will appear, that many of your assertions tend not to
renouation, but innovation, and that they were never either borne in Sion, or
meet for Sion.

The Epist. of T. C. Sect. 3.
And of confusion and disorder it is yet more untruly accused. For justice may
be as well accused for doing wrong, as this doctrine, for bringing in
disorder, whose whole work is to provide, that nothing be done out of place,
out of time, or otherwise than the condition of every man's calling will bear:
which puts the people in subjection under their governors, the governors
in degree and order one under an other, as the Elder underneath the Pastor, and
the Deacon underneath the Elder, which teaches that a particular Church shall
give place unto a provincial Synod, where many Churches are, and the
provincial to a national, and likewise that, unto the general, if any, be,
and all unto Christ and his word. When on the contrary part, those which
stand against this doctrine, are thereby compelled to bring into the Church
great confusion, and marvelous disorder, whylest the Pastors office is
confounded with the deacons, whilst women do minister the Sacraments which is
lawful only for men, whylest private men do that which belongs unto public
persons, whilst public actions are done in private places, whilst the
Church is shuffled with the common wealth: whylest civil matters are handeled
by Ecclesiastical persons: and Ecclesiastical by those which be Civil: and
to be short, whylest no officer of the Church keeps his standing, and one
member does take upon it the office of an other. Which things as they hazard
the army, and destroy the body, so they do presently hinder, and will shortly
(if remedy be not provided) utterly overthrow the Church. And therefore
unless good order be in that which was brought into the Church by Poperye:
and confusion in that which was left unto the Church by the Apostles, and
that it be order, that public actions should be done in private places by
private persons, and by women that is appointed to be done by men, and
confusion when the contrary is observed: and finally, unless order have an
other definition or nature, than hitherto has been read or heard of, there is
no cause why this doctrine which contemeth the discipline and government of the
Church, should be thus shamefully slaundered, with confusion and disorder.

Io. Whitgifte.
It will fall out I think, that your opinions now in question, tend in deed
to Where unto their opinions tend.
confusion: respect neither time, place, nor persons: confound degrees, bring
such in contempt as be in authority: make the ignorant subject lofty, and
arrogant, take from Princes their due authority in Ecclesiastical matters:
when as present experience and the peace and quietness of this Church, since
the beginning of the Queens Majesty's reign (until you and your company
began to broache these your fantasies) declares, that the doctrine mainteyned
by those whom you count as your adversaries, is most agreeable to order,
preserves peace, keeps every man in his degree and calling. And truly if the
government of the Church now allowed by public authority, be compared with
your new devised policy, the difference of them both will easily appear. For I
pray you tell me, how many of you which have bin permitted as The admonitors
agree not in their go uernment.
preachers in several places, have consented in one kind of government, nay,
which of you have not troubled, not only the Town where you have remained,
but the whole Country reunde about also? so that undoubtedly though you be not
Anabaptists (as I hope you be not) yet does this property of theirs most aptly
agree unto you that whersoeuer you come, you make contention, and kindle the
fire of discord, take it as you list, experience does teach it to be so,

Whether we confound the Pastors office with the Deacons or no, otherwise than
it has been in the Apostles time, and primative Church: whether private men
women, civil or Ecclesiastical persons, do more than they ought to do or
no, to be short, whether order according to the true nature and definition
thereof be observed or no, I shall have better occasion hereafter to discuss.
Now my meaning is to answer words with words, although in no such deriding and
opprobrious manner.

The Epist. of T. C. Sect. 4.
For the third point which is, that it is an enemy to Magistrates, and the
commonwealth: if it be enough to accuse without proof, say, and to show no
reason, innocence it self shall not be guiltless. This doctrine was in times
past, even by their confession, which write against it, a friend unto Princes
and Magistrates, when Princes and magistrates were enemies unto it: And can it
now be an enemy unto Princes and magistrates, which are friends unto it? It
helped and vpholded the common wealths, which were governed by tyrants, and
can it hinder those, which are governed by godly Princes? And in what is it an
enemy to Princes and magistrates? Note the variance, set down the enimitie.
If the question be, whether Princes and Magistrates be necessary in the
Church, it holds, that the use of them is more than of the Sun, without
the which the world can not stand. If it be of their honor, it holds,
that with humble submission of mind, the outward also of the body, yea the
body it self, and all that it has, if need so require, are to be yielded,
for the defense of the Prince, and for that service, for the which the Prince
will use them unto, for the glory of God, and mayntenance of the Common wealth.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but glorious words, the truth whereof shall appear, when we come to
the more particular declaration of the several points: and if we accuse
without proof, say and show no reason, take your remedy against us as
slaunderers, and bring us to our trial. In deed the doctrine of the Gospel,
which is the doctrine of salvation, has been, is, and will be a friend to
Princes and Magistrates, yea though they persecute the same: But you have not
yet proved your doctrine now in question, to be that doctrine of the Gospel
and of salvation. These words might well have been spoken of the Gospel
against Mahometisme, Iudaisme, Papisme, but you do injury to that doctrine of
life, when you confound with the same your erroneous contentions about
ceremonies, and the kind of government, which all being external things, I
think not many will make them to be de necessitate salutis, of necessity unto
salvation. you have here said nothing of your doctrine, but that which the
Arrians, the Pelagians, the Papists, the Turks, yea almost the Anabaptists
will say of theirs: for many even of the Anabaptists confess, that
Magistrates be necessary, but yet not to be lawful for Christians to be
Magistrates: and for proof thereof they use diverse of the self same places that
the Admonition has alleged (and you allowed) against superiority in the
clergy. And (except I be deceived) you come very near to them, for you will
have the Ecclesiastical and civil government so distinct, that they can by
no means concur in one and the self same persons: whereby you take from the
Civil Magistrate authority in Ecclesiastical matters, and by that means
spoil him of the one half of his jurisdiction. But of this matter more at
large hereafter as occasion shall be ministered by you. In the mean time, I
admonish the Reader to believe your words no farther than he shall see just
proof of them.

T. C.
If it be asked of the obedience due unto the Prince, and unto the Magistrate,
it answers that all obedience in the Lord, is to be rendered: and if it come
to pass, that any other be asked, it so refuses that it disobeyeth not, in
preferring obedience to the great God, before that which is to be given to
mortal man. It so resysteth, that it submits the body and goods of those
that profess it, to abide that which God will have them suffer in that case.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is truly spoken of the doctrine of the Gospel, but not of the
doctrine in controversy amongst us: and verily this is not plain dealing, to
make the reader believe that we do withstand the doctrine of the Gospel,
when we only resist your contentions about external matters, whereby the
doctrine of the Gospel is hindered, and the Church of Christ disturbed.

T. C.
And if it be showed, that this is necessary for the Church, it can not be
but profitable for the common wealth: nay the profit of it may easyly appear,
for that by the censures and discipline of the Church, as they are in this
book described, men are kept back from committing of great disorders, of
stealing, adultery, murder, etc. whylest the smaller faults of lying and
uncomely (...), of hard and cholerike speeches, which the magistrate both not
commonly punish, be corrected.

Io. Whitgifte.
If it be necessary for the present state of the Church, it is also
profitable for the present state of the common wealth: for I perceive no such
distinction of the common wealth and the church, that they should be counted as
it were two several bodies governed with diverse laws and diverse Magistrates,
except the Church be linked with an heathenish and idolatrous common wealth.
The civil Magistrate may not take upon him What ecclestasticali functions the
(...) Magistrate may not take upon him*
such Ecclesiastical functio^s as are only proper to the Minister of the
Church, as preaching of the word, administering of the Sacraments,
excommunicating, and such like, but that he has no authority in the Church,
to make and execute laws for the Church, and in things pertaining to the
Church, as Discipline, Ceremonies, etc. (so that he do nothing against the
word of God) though the Papists affirm it never so stoutely, yet is the
contrary most true, and sufficiently proved by men of notable learning, as
Master Jewel Bishop of Salisburie, Master Horn Bishop of Winchester, Master
Nowell Deane of Paul's, in their books written against Papists holding your
assertion, to whose painful and learned writings I res^rre the Reader, for
the avoiding of too much prolixitie.

I do not well understand what is mente by these words, Nay the profit of
it may easyly appear, for that by the censures and discipliue of the Church,
as they are in this book described, men are kept back from committing of
greater disorders of stealyng, adultery, murder. etc. whylest the smaller
faults, of lying, and uncomely jesting, of hard and cholerike speeches,
which the Magistrate does not commonly punysh, be corrected: Do you not
think the punishemente for stealing, and murder, to be sharp enough? or do
you think that the fear of the Discipline of the Church will more terrify
men from these vices, than the fear of death? Or do you doubt whether the
Civil Magistrate has Authority to appoynte any other punyshemente for
these and such like crimes, than is prescribed in the Judicial Law of
Moses? For this is now called in controversy, and begins to be table
talk: or are you persuaded, that the Civil Magistrate either may not, or
will not correct lying, uncomely jesting, hard and cholerike speeches? Or
that if these were punished by the Discipline of the Church, men would rather
be terrified from the greater crimes, than they will be if they be punished
with civil correction? Truly I think that the civil Magistrate has
sufficient authority to provide remedies for all such mischieues, without
altering the state, either of the church, or of the common wealth. But let the
indifferent Reader judge, whether you go about to wring the swoorde out of
the Magistrates hand or no: or at the least, so to order the matter, that it be
never drawn out to punish vice, but with the consent and at the appointment
of you and your seigniorie.

T. C.
And undoubtedly, seeing that the church and common wealth, do embrace and
kiss one an other, and seeing they be like unto Hypocrates twins which were
sick together and well together, laughed together, and weped together, and
always like affected: it can not be, but that the breaches of the common
wealth, have proceeded from the hurts of the Church, and the wants of the one,
from the lackes of the other: Neither is it to be hoped for, that the common
wealth shall flourish, until the Church be reformed.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this I grant (and God be thanked therefore) if we shall measure the state of
the church, with the flourishing estate and wise government of the common
wealth, we shall have no great cause to complain, but to burste out into
most hearty thanks unto God for the same, and most humbly desire the
continuance thereof.

I do not say that the Church is without fault, for then should I affirm an
impossibility, but I think the faults that are, rather to be in the persons,
than in the laws, rather in the governors, than in the kind of government:
neither would I have men (either Puritanes, Donatistes, or Anabaptists) to
dream of such a Church, as Plato did of a Common wealth, Aristotle of
felicity, and the Stoics of their just man: much lesie to make contention
in the Church, or divide themselves from the same, if al things go not
according to their fantasy: for then shall they never be quiet with any
Church, no not long with that Church, which they themselves do presently best
like of. Surely if this rule be certain, that the Common wealth shall not
flourish The rule of T. C. returned against himself.
until the Church be reformed, then this may be a good token unto us, that this
Church of England is reformed, because the Common wealth does flourish.
Neither do I speak this to flatter the Magistrates, and to sewe quisshions
under their elbows (as it pleases some to report) but I speak it before God,
I speak it as I think: and the rather I utter it, to deliver both the state
of the Church, and also of the common wealth of England, from the
unthankful, unnatural, and slanderous tongues of such as seek to deface and
deprave them both.

I will not defend the vice, the negligence, the security of any man, I shall
be as bold and as ready to tell even the best thereof in time and place (as
occasion is ministered, and my duty shall require) as any of those shall be,
which would seem to be farthest from all kind of flattery.

T. C.
And it is also certain, that as the Church shall every day more and more
decay, until it be made even with the ground, unless the walls be builded,
and the ruins repaired: S^ the weight of it (if it fall) will either quite pull
down the Common wealth, or leave it such as none which fear God will take
any pleasure in it. For seeing Solomon says, that by wisdom (which is the
word of God) Kings do govern, and Princes do bear rule: it can not be, but
as that wisdom is either contemned, or neglected, or otherwise abridged of
her free and full course, so Princes and Magistrates, and consequently their
common wealths, either go to wrack, or decay, or at the least, want so much
of the flourishing estate, as there wants of that word of God which he has
appointed to be their stay. And howsoever (before the coming of our Savior
Christ) amongst the Athenians, Lacedaemonians, and Romans, and since his
coming in dyners places where this wisdom has not ben heard of, there may
seem to have bin some shows of either flourishing, or tolerable common
wealths, yet neither have those endured, but according to the prophecy of
Daniell, have been broken all to pieces: so that there is not so much of them
left, as a sheard to fetch fire in: neither yet can those kingdoms which
have the knowledge of the Gospel revealed unto them, look for that long
suffering and patience of God toward them wherewith those ignorant kingdoms
have been borne with. For as the benefit is greater toward these, than
toward the other, so is the judgment swifter against them, than against the
other: if that grace which was not offered unto them (being offered unto these)
be refused, and made light of. And in these especially is, and shall be
fulfilled that which the Prophet Esaias says, that it shall be in the later
days that every nation and kingdom, which shall not serve the Church, shall be
destroyed. As of the other side, the full and whole placing of our savior
Christ in his throne, is the perpetual stay, and stayed perpetuity of all
Princes in their seats.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is true, for if any nation shall refuse the word of God offered unto
it, or not suffer Christ wholly to be placed in his throne, no doubt God will
pour upon that nation his plagues, as he has done upon al other that have
run into the same contempt. But would you make your reader believe, that
because this Church of England does not admit your kind of government,
therefore the walls of it be broken, the word of God contemned, and Christ
not suffered wholly to be placed in his throne? We admit the Gospel wholly,
and in governments the magistrates take upon them no office only proper to
Christ, neither yet any authority which is not by the word of God limited unto
them. These words might aptly have bin spoken if you had written against the
state of the Church in France, or any such like kingdom as refuses the
Gospel offered unto it, and most cruelly persecuteth the true professors of
the same. I do not excuse such in the Church of England as contemn the word
of God, neither do I justify the whole Church for not receiving the Gospel
offered, by bringing forth the fruits thereof as it ought to do: But I exhort
every man, from the highest to the lowest, even in the bowels of Jesus Christ,
to have a better regard thereunto, least it be said unto us, as it is said unto
the Church of Ephesus, Apoc. 2. Sed babeo aduersum te, quod charitatem tuam
pristinam. etc. I have some thing against Apoc. 2.
thee, because thou have forsaken thy former love. etc. And to the Hebrews. 6:
For the earth Hebr. 6
which drinks in rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs
meet for them by whom it is dressed; receives blessing of God. But that
which bears thorns and briers, is reproved, and is near unto curssing,
whose end is to be burned. For surely even these contentions stirred up in the
Church where the Gospel is truly preached, are arguments that we be void of
love and peace, the chief and principal tokens and fruits of the Gospel.

T C.
And therefore if this book shall come into the hands of any, that have
access unto her Majesty, the head of this common wealth, or unto her most
honorable counsatle, the shoulders thereof, my humble suit and hearty request,
in the presence of God is, that according as their callings will suffer them,
they will put them in remembrance of these things, which otherwise they know
better than I, and that they would set before them the example of Moses, who
was not contented to have brought the people out of Egypt, T. C. makes greater
accopt^. of the government than of the Gospel it self* for he (...) the state
of this Church, to ^he wand^ing in the wildern^.
but would very fain also, have conducted them into the land of Canaan, that
is, would gladly have been the instrument of the full and whole deliverance of
the people. And seeing that the Lord does offer them this honor which he denied
unto his servant Moses, that they would not make themselves guilty of so
great unthankfulness, as will follow of the forsaking of so incomparable a
benefit. That her Majesty especially, and her most honorable counsel, would
set before them the example of David, who although he made a great
reformation of those things which were defaced by Saul, yet he was not content,
that the Ark of the Lord should dwell under a Tabernacle, and therefore desired
maruellously, that he might buyld the temple unto the Lord. And seeing that the
Lord has granted unto them which he denied unto his servant, that they would
not be narow and straight in themselves, seeing the Lord opens the treasures
of his goodness so largely unto them. That they would set before them the
zeal of Zerubbabel, who although he had (after the return out of captivity)
abolished idolatry, laid the foundations of the Temple, and set up an altar
unto God, whereupon the morning and evening sacrifice was daily made: yet being
admonished by the Prophet Aggey, that God would not be pleased, unless the
Temple also were fully builded, did (all fear of the nations round about, and
other business laid aside) cause it forthwith, and with all possible speed
to be made an end of. Finally, that it would please them to consider the
examples of Josias, Ezechias, and Iehoshaphat, who are therefore, to their
everlasting commendation pr^ised of the holy Ghost, for that they made whole,
and thorough reformations, where as the honor of other some (albeit they were
otherwise good) is stained, and caryeth the mark of their imperfection, by
this and like exception, that although they did such good things, and such,
That is, they suffered manifest Idolatry: where with you can by n^ means (...)
thi^ Chur^he of England, and therefore your application (...) vnfie.
yet they left also such and such undone.

Io. Whitgifte.
And why is not her Majesty the head of this Church also, as well as of this
common wealth? For I must give thee to understand (good Reader) that T. C.
makes T. C. joins with the Papists concerning the authority of the civil
Magistrate in ecclesiastical matt^rs.
the Church, and the common wealth two such distinct and several bodies, as
must of necessity, have distinct and several magistrates and gonernors, and
that the Civil magistrate has not to meddle in Ecclesiastical matters,
except his aid be required by the Pastor and Seigniorie, or such like cases,
wherein he flatly joins with the Papists, who say, that the civil Magistrate
has only Potestatem facti, and not Iuris, that is, authority to execute such
things as they decree, but not authority to make any laws in Ecclesiastical
matters. And least you should think that I feign this, consider the whole
scope of his book, and particularly his words before mentioned in this leaf,
where as he accuses the government of this Church now in practice of
confusion, because civil matters are handled by Ecclesiastical persons, and
Ecclesiastical Sect. 3.
matters by those which be civil, also that which he speaks of this matter
f^. 144. and Fo. 144. sect. 2.
154. and especially that which the second Admonition has, fo. 8. 9. 57. 60. I
know not Fol. 154. sect. 1. 2. 3.
how he could have made a greater difference, betwixt the Church and the
common wealth in those places where the Princes be enemies unto the Church. In
deed true it is, that in the Apostles time, Princes did not meddle in causes
Ecclesiastical, except it were by persecuting. etc. For they were then
infidels, not Christians, persecutors, not professors: And therefore if all
ought of necessity to be reduced to the form of government used in the
Apostles time, Christian Princes must be delivered from that care, and be
content to forgo that portion of their authority. But hereof more in the due
place, this I only here note, that you may the better consider the same in the
pervsing of his book.

The rest of that which is contained in this part, may have some use, if it
be rightly applied: for godly princes have to follow such godly examples, and
to be diligent in reforming such things as are to be reformed, either in
substance, circumstances or persons.

T. C.
Which I do not speak, as though we had not already, by her Majesty
especially, and afterward by their honors hands received a singular benefyte,
but that we having the whole, might have our hearts and mouths filled with
the praise of God, and continue the possession of that which we have, which
otherwise for our unthankful refusal, shall be taken away. Wherein as we have
especial regard, that the name of God should be magnified, not by us alone, but
by our posterity unto the worlds end: So it is not the smallest part of our
care, that her Majesty and your honors, to whom we are so deeply bound, and
of whom we have received so singular benefytes of peace, and preaching of the
Gospel, might with your successions continue nnd flourish amongst us for
ever: But the desire of reformation, and fear of Gods heavy wrath to come
upon us, has carried me further herein than I purposed. I will therefore make
an end of these points, considering that the untruth of these accusations, of
newness and strangeness, of disorder and confusion, of being enemy to
princes and common wealths, shall better appear in the discourse of this
Book.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be smooth words to win credit by: but they agree not with the rest of
your book, wherefore I doubt not but that they will be considered of
accordingly. I would to God that you did in deed acknowledge that singular
benefyte that you have received by her Majesty and their honors, then truly
would you have showed yourselfe more thankful than you have done, neither
would you have maintained libells which seek utterly to deface all that is
done, as will manifestly hereafter by further examination appear. Whatsoever
accusations have bin made of your doctrine, if they be not justified, then let
the authors of them suffer the shame. Surely you have as slenderly answered
these accusations hitherto, as may be.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. 5. 6. 7.
Amongst the offenses taken by occasion of those, which prefer the doctrine,
this is the cheifest, that comparison being made betwixt those excellent me^,
both in virtue and learning, which suffered for the testimony of the truth,
and between us, of the one side: Also between the Archbyshops, Bishops, Deanes,
and Archdeacons, which now are, and us on the other side: it seems unto many
that it is not like to be good, which was not found out by those excellent
personages, and which being now propounded, by men of no great show, is either
misliked, or at the least, by no open approbation allowed, of those which
carry greater countenaunces, and be in greater dignities.

Unto the first, although answer is made more at large, in this book, yet I
will add thus much, that as for my part, I coufesse my self, to be a great
deal inferioure unto the least of them: so the omitting of these necessary
things, ought to be no more prejudice against them, or against those that
pret^erre them, than the omitting of the celebration of the feast of
Tabernacles, so many hundredth years, by so many good high priests, in the
reigns of so many good kings, was prejudicial unto the ministers, which
caused it to be celebrated, when the people returned out of their captivity:
for it appears in the book of Nehemias, that the feast of Tabernacles, which
was commanded of 8. Chap.
the Lord to be celebrated every year, was This is a manifest untruth, as
shall appear.
not celebrated from the days of Joshua, the son of Nun, until the return of
the people from their captivity. And yet were there in this space, dysiers
both judges and kings, both priests and Prophets singularly zealous and learned.

If therefore the omitting of so necessary a thing, so many hundredth years, by
such godly, zealous, learned persons, could not bring any prescription, against
the truth: the lack of this necessary discipline, by the space of. 30. years,
through the oversight of a few (if they be compared with that multitude) ought
not to be alleged, to keep it out of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely the inequality of the persons, and great difference betwixt them, both
in godliness, zeal, learning, experience, and age, (though it seem a small
matter too some) yet it ought to be well considered: for it is well known,
that the first sort of men here mentioned, did excel in all those forenamed
qualities, and have continued in the same even to the death: and the latter
sort many of them singular in learning, zeal, wisdom, and experience, having
also knowledge of other Churches reformed more than you (howsoever it pleases
you and some of your companions undutifully to contemn them) wherefore as I
said, this comparison is something, and not so lightly to be esteemed, as you
would make the reader believe. For my part I think the worse of you, because
you think so well of your selves, that you dare be so bold, as not only to
compare your selves with them, but to prefer your selves before them. As for
this Humility, and abasing your self in saying, that you confess your self
to be a great deal inferioure to the least of them: He that will take pains
but to peruse your book, shall easly understand that you think nothing less.
For truly your style is so big and lofty, and your tauntes such toward them
and others, that a man would think you not only to have cast off all modesty,
but utterly to have forgotten all good manners, civility, and duty. But it
is Rhetoric common to you with other of your companions, as appears in
diverse places of the first Admonition, and in the second throughout the whole,
which I would wish the reader to consider, that he may thereby partly know, and
discern your spirit.

But say you, the omitting of these necessary things, ought to be no more
prejudice against them. etc. Surely if you can prove that they have omitted
any thing expressly against the commandment of God, then is it true that you
say, but if you cannot do so, then do you unjustly charge these learned and
godly martyrs. But what if you have abused the place in the. 8. Chapter of
Nehemias? What if you understand it not truly? The feast of Tabernacles was
not so long omitted.
What if there can be no such thing gathered of it, as you would make the
reader believe? Shall I triumph over you and say that either you have not read
it, or you do not understand it, or that you willingly and wittingly abuse it,
or that you received it in some notes from others, as it pleases you to deal
with me, when no such occasion is offered unto you? I will not so requite you:
But this only I say, that you have not set down the true sense of that place:
For the meaning is not that the feasts of Tabernacles was The true
interpretation of the place alleged out of the 8. of Nehemias.
not celebrated from the time of Joshua the son of Nun, unto that day which
was almost a thousand years, but that it was not celebrated in that manner,
that is with such solemnity, so great rejoicing and gladness, as the very
words them selves declare, both in the Hebrew, text and in the best
translations. And so does Pellicane expound that place, who says, that these
words since the time of Joshua the son of Nun. etc. be spoken Pelican in 8.
Nebe.
in the respect of the greatness of the joy which then happened to the
people. Lyra also expounds the same place much after the same sort, and
presupposes nothing less, than that the feasts were omitted all this time:
for he affirms that they were much more solemnly and with greater cost
celebrated in the times of David and Solomon: Lyra in 8. Nebe.
therefore, says he, the comparison is secundum quid, and. proportionaliter
(for I use his words) because in all this time sithence Joshua, it is not read,
that the people were so generally gathered together in Jerusalem, as we read
in the beginning of this Chapter that they were at this time: and again he
says that it was more for the people newly returned from captivity, to
celebrate such a feast with that solemnity, than it was to mighty kings and
people being in prosperity, and settled in a kingdom, to celebrate the same
day with much more cost and solemnity. I might allege other expositiors to
the same effect: neither have I read any that does expound that place otherwise.

The like kind of speech we have. 2. Reg. 23. where it is said. That there was
no passover 2. Reg. 23.
holden like that (which Josias held) from the days of the Judges, that
judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and the kings of
Judah: which is only spoken in respect of the multitude, and zeal of the
people, with the great preparation: and not because the passover was not all
this time celebrated. The like is also used. 2. Chro. 2. Chro. 30. 26.
30. verse. 26. even so it is in this place: for there is no doubt, but that the
feast of Tabernacles was celebrated both in David and Salomons time: and it is
manifest that it was celebrated not long before this time, as it is in plain
words expressed. 1. Esdras 1. Esra. cap. 3. verse. 4.
Ca. 3. verse. 4. wherefore I might make much ado at this oversight of yours, or
rather wilful deprauing of the scriptures, if I were delighted with that kind
of confuting. But though my learning be small, and that I am ignorant both of
Logic and Philosophy, and have read so little in Divinity, and you so
mighty a man in the Scriptures, and so profound in all kind of knowledge, as
you persuade your self to be, yet you must be content here to be admonished of
me, that you have abused this place, and that it serves not for your turn, to
prove those godly men, which suffered martyrdom in Dueene Mary's time, to have
permitted any thing in this Church of England (after it was reformed)
expressly contrary to the commandment and word of God, as you untruly
report, So many good high priests in the reygnes of so many good kings, so
many hundredth years to have omitted the feasts of Tabernacles, expressly by
God commanded. Although I do not deny, but such men also may sometimes be
ouerseene in some points, but neither can you prove that they were deceived in
any substantial point of doctrine, neither yet if they were, is this place
aptly or truly alleged.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. 8.
The dignity also, and high estate of those, which are not so earnest in this
cause, can not hinder it, if we consider, the wisdom of God, almost from time
to time, to consist, and to show it self most in setting forth his truth, by
the simpler, and weaker sort, by co^temptible, and weak instruments, 1. Cor. I.
by things of no value, to the end, that when al men see the baseness, and
rudeness of the instrument, they might the more wonder at the wisdom, and
power of the artificer, which with so weak, and foolish instruments, brings
to pass so wise and mighty things. And if me^ will with such an eye of fiesh,
look upon matters, they shall condemn that excellent reformation, made under

that the This place is not right interpreted.

For when A manifest flattery, and the scripture abused to color it.
I consider the zeal for religion which shows it self in many, as well of
the nobility, 30. Chap.
and gentry of this realm, as of the people, their care to continue it, and
advance it, their voluntary charges to maintain it, their liberality toward
them, which bend themselves that way, as I do thereby conceive some hope, of
the favorable countenance, and co^tinuaunce of Gods goodness toward us: So I
cannot be but ashamed of mine own slackensse, and afraid of the displeasure of
the Lord, for that those whose proper work this is especially, and which
should bear the standard, and carry the torch unto the rest, are so cold,
and so careless in these matters of the Lord.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know none among us, which in the respect of his dignity, and high estate,
seeks or desires to be preferred or believed before you, but in the respect
of the cause, which is the peace of the Church, suppression of schisms, and
the truth it self. No man denies but God of his wisdom in the beginning of
the Church of Christ, poured God uses not the simple only, or always to set
forth his truth.
out his gifts more plenteously upon the simpler, contemptible and weaker
sort, and that he choosed for his Apostles fishermen, tollegatherers, and
ignorant persons, lest that should be ascribed to the wit, eloquence, and
learning of man, which comes only of the goodness, might, and power of God,
as the Apostle plainly declares. 1. Cor. 1. and. 2. But will you therefore
conclude, that truth, zeal, and godliness remains either only or especially
in the simple, rude, and ignorant sort? and make this your conclusion, the
learned, the honorable, men of great countenance or knowledge be of this or
that opinion, Ergo it is not true? Or the simple, rude, and ignorant people ar
thus and thus persuaded, Ergo they must be followed, or to the like effect?
Uerely this were to reason as the Franciscan friars do to excuse their
ignorance: Apostoli nesciebant literas, ergo Franciscanis non est opus literis.
And like some other fantastical persons also, which think that no learned,
rich, or honorable man shall be saved, but only beggars, and such as be
ignorant, as master Gualter testifyeth in his commentaries upon. 1. Cor. 1.
Gual. in. 1. Cor. I. hom. 7.


You know (as I suppose) that this place of the. 1. Cor. 1. quoted in your
margent, does not gather any such conclusion, that therefore the doctrine is
not true, because Princes, nobles, wise and learned men etc. do allow of it: or
therefore it is true, because it pleases the simple, rude, and ignorant
people. For Nicodemus, Joseph, Lazarus Betha: Sergius Paulus, Dionisius
Areopagita, Crispus, Gaius, Erastus, with diverse others, were politic, wise,
welthy, learned, and honorable men: and the Prophet Esaias says. That kings
and Queens shall be the nursing fathers and mothers, the defenders and
mainteiners of the Church. And Bullinger in his commentaries upon Esaias. 49.
this place does thus expound it: He speaks of the first calling especially,
wherein fishermen Bull. in. 1. Co. I.
and Idiots were especially called to the preaching of the Gospel. For no man
can deny, but that after the Gospel was confirmed in the world, the best
learned embraced the truth. For first shepherds declared that Christ was borne:
then the Magi, that is, the wise men of the East, came to salute him with
gifts. Wherefore I pray you let not the wealth, calling, or dignity which you
think we have, prejudice our cause. The simple and plain meaning of the place
is, that God in his electing to eternal life, has neither respect to
nobility, learning, riches, or any such thing.

I might here again trippe you for alleging Josias in stead of Ezechias,
and say that you had not read the Scriptures, or that you used other men's
notes, and so dally with you, as you use to do with others: But I will leave
such kind of gibes to brabling Sophisters in the schools, and think that it
was some light oversight, which in such a case may sometimes happen to him that
is most circumspect.

Your collection upon that place. 2. Chro. 29. and. 30. I can not as yet
allow, until I be better instructed therein: for whereas you say that it is
there witnessed that the Levites which were a degree under the Priests were
more forward and more zealous than the Priests themselves, and the people more
earnest and more willing than either the Levites or the Priests: I see not how
you can gather any such thing out of either of these two Chapters: for if
there be any sentence to gather it of in the. 29. Chap. it is the. 34. verse:
which although in some translation, it seem to insinuate some such thing, yet
if credit may be given to those that be notable learned men, and very well
seen in the Hebrew song, the meaning of that place is nothing less. Pellicane
translateth the words thus: Leuitae quippe faciliori ritu sanctificantur quam
sacerdotes: For the Levites were sooner or easyer sanctified than the priests
which he expounds more plainly in his Pel. in. 2. Chr. 29.
commentaries, saying: Intelligitur sacerdotum numerum imminutum fuisse. etc.
It is to be understood that the number of the priests was diminished which
should have sufficed for to prepare the sacrifices, and therefore they desired
the help of the Levites, that al things might be done more diligently: there
was also another cause of the Levites help, for the sanctifying of the temple,
and the preparation of the sacrifice was so suddenly commanded, that many of
the priests had not time to sanctifye themselves according to the law, which
required a certain space for the same, and the Levites might be sanctified
with less adoo, and in shorter time. And surely even the very circumstances of
the place does prove this to be the true understanding of it: For these be the
words that immediately go before. But the priests were too few and were not able
to fleay all the burnt offerings, therefore their brethren the Levites did help
them, until they had ended the work, and until other priests were sanctified.
2. Chro. 29. 34*


Your second assertion that is, that the people were yet more earnest, and more
willing than either the Levites or the priests, I think is grounded upon the.
15. verse of the. 30. Chapter, which is this: Afterward they slew the passover
the fourteen day of the second month: and the priests and Levites were
ashamed, and sanctified them selves, and brought the burnt offerings into the
house of the Lord. Truly I see not how you can collect any 2. Chro. 30. 15.
such thing out of these words: I know that some do gather such a note of that
place, But I do not understand the reason of it. Howsoever it be, and howsoever
you abuse the scriptures to justify your selves, I doubt not but that a great
number of those, whom you contemme and seek to deface, do presently, and will
to their lives end, show that zeal of religion, that diligence in their
calling, that uprightness in conversation which becomes them, and which
they are well assured pleases God: neither do I in so saying condemn the
godly zeal of any, but I admonish all to take heed of a preposterous and
affectionated zeal, such as is spoken of in the. 30. Page of the second
edition of my answer to the Admonition.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. 9.
And I humbly crave, and most ernestly desire of those which bare the chief
titles in the ecclesiastical functions, that as we do in part correct our
negligence by the example of the forwardness, and readiness of the people, so
they would suffer themselves to be put in remembrance of their ducties by us
which are underneath them, and that they would not neglect this golden gift of
gods grace, in admonishing them, by cause the Lord does offer it in a treane
or earthen vessel, but that they would first consider, that as Naaman the
Syrian prince, received great commodity, by following the advice of his maid,
and after, of his man: And Abigael being a wise woman, singular profit, by
obeying the counsel of her servant: so they may receive of tentimes profitable
advertisement, by those which are in lower places than they themselves be. Then
let them think, that as Naaman was nevertheless noble, for obeying the voice
of his servant, nor Abigaell nevertheless wise, because she listened unto the
words of her man, so it cannot deminish their true honor, nor empaire the
credit of their godly and vncounterfaite wisdom, if they give care unto
that, which is spoken by their inferiors.

Io. Whitgifte.
This humility appears to be counterfaite by the opprobrious speeches, and
great contempt that you show toward them in the rest of this book.

What diligence you are provoked unto, by the forwardness and readiness of the
people, I know not, but every man may see you are ready to shake off your
calling upon every light occasion: Neither will you preach in those places
where the Gospel has not bin so well planted, but there only you loyter,
where there is less need, and where you easily may make sturres, and move
contention, as experience sufficiently teaches.

I know none, no not of the best, that refuses to hear either you or any
other modestly admonishing, neither have you any cause hereof to complain, but
your stomachs are such, and your arrogancy so great, that you passingly abuse
your selves toward those, whom indeed you ought to reverence, and with all
duty obey.

I marvel that you will confess yourselfe to be underneath them, seeing you so
cry out against superiority in the clergy, and claim such interest in
equality: but I may not stand in answering words.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. 10.
And last of all, that as, if they had not listened unto those simple persons,
the one had perished in his leprosy, the other had bin slain, with her
family: This is glorious talk builded upon a false ground.
even so, if they shall for any worldly respect of honor, riches, or fear of
being accounted, either unadvised in taking this course, or light, or
inconstant, in forsaking it, stop their cares against this loving admonition of
the Lord, they provoke his anger, not against their health, or against their
life, but against their own souls, by exercising of unlawful authority, and
by taking unto them partly such things, as belong by no means unto the Church,
and partly which are common unto them, with the whole Church, or else with
other the ministers, and governors of the same: whereof I beseech them humbly
to take the better heed, for that the judgment of the Lord will be upon a
great part of them, by so much the heavier, by how much, they have not only
believed the Gospel, but also have received this grace of god, that they
should suffer for it. So that if they will neither take example of diverse their
superiors the nobles of this realm, nor be admonished by us, of the lower
sort (wherein we hope better of them) yet they would remember their former
tunes, and correct themselves, by themselves, and seeing they have bin content,
for the Gospels sake to quit the necessary things of this life, they would not
think much, for the discipline, which is no small part of the Gospel (having
both things necessary and commodious) to part from that, which is not only in
them superfluous, and has nothing but a vain ostentation (which will vanish as
the shadow) but also is hurtful unto them, and pernicious unto the Church,
which thing I do more largely, and plainly lay forth in this Book.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely if they do for any such respects refuse any admonition given unto
them, for the avoiding of such things as be unlawful, and as they unjustly
retain, then no doubt they are worthy of great reprehension: but if your
Admonition be not loving, but spiteful, not brotherly, but unchristian, nay no
Admonition in deed, but a very scolding and uncharitable railing, if the
things you would have them forsake, be both lawful and conueniente for them
to use, and contrariwise the things that you move them unto, tend to confusion,
and overthrow of the Gospel, and of the state (as they do) then truly have
they to consider of such disturbers of the peace of the Church, and according
to their office and duty provide a conueniente remedy for them: knowing that it
is the extreme refuge of Satan, when by other means he cannot, then to seek
the overthrow of the Gospel, through contention about external things.

The Epist. of T. C. Sect. II.
An other exception against the favorers of this cause, is taken for that they
propounde it out of time, which is that the Jews said, that the time was not
yet come to build the Lords house: but it is known what the Prophet answered.
And if no time were unseasonable, in that kind of material building, wherein
there be some times (as of summer) more opportune and fit than others: how can
there be any untimely building, in this spiritual house, where, as long as it
is called to day, men are commanded to further this work. And as for those
which say, we come to late, and that this should have bin done in the
beginning, and can not now be done without the overthrow of all, for mending of
a piece: they do little consider, that S. Paul compares that which is good in
the buylding unto gold, and silver, and precious stones, and that which is
evil, laid upon the foundation, unto stubble and hey, and wood. Likewise
therefore as the stubble, and the hey, and the wood be easily by the fire
consumed, without any loss unto the gold, or silver, or precious stones: so
the corrupt things in this buylding, may be easily taken away, without any
hurt or hinderaunce unto that which is pure, and sound. And if they put such
confidence in this similitude, as that they will thereby without any testimony
of the word of God, stay the further buylding, or correcting the faults of
the house of the Lord (which by his manifest commandment ought to be done
with all speed) then besides that they be very uncunning buylders, which can
not mende the faults without overthrow of al (especially when as the fault, is
not in the foundation) they must remember, that as the mean, which is used to
gather the children of God, is called a building, so it is called a planting.
And therefore as dead twigs, riotous or superfluous branches, or what soever
hinders the growth of the vine tree, may be cut of, without rooting up the
vine: so the unprofitable things of the Church may be taken away without any
overthrow of those things which are well established. And seeing that Christ and
Beliall can not agree, it is strange, that the pure doctrine of the one, and
the corruptions of the other, should cleave so fast together, that pure
doctrine can not be with her safety, severed from the corruptions, when as
they are rather like unto that part of Daniels image, which was compounded of
claye and iron, and therefore could not cleave or stick one with an other.

Io. Whitgifte.
They did not only propound it out of time, (after the Parliament was ended)
but out of order also, that is in the manner of a libell, with false allegations
and applications of the Scriptures, opprobrious speeches, and slanders: not to
reform, but to deforme the Church, and to confound al. The rest in this part
is Petitio principij, the petition of the principle, for you take that as
confessed and true, which will not be granted unto you, as shall more at large
hereafter appear.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. 12.
It is further said, that the setters forward of this cause are contentious,
and in moving questions give occasion to the Papists of staundering the
religion, and to the weak, of offense. But if it be found to be both true
which is propounded, and a thing necessary about which we contend, then has
this accusation no ground to stand en. For peace is commended to us, with these
conditions, if it be possible, if it lie in us. Now it is not possible; it
lies not in us to conceal the Romans 1^* ^. Cor. 10.
truth, we can do nothing against it, but for it. It is a profane saying, of
a profane man, that an unjust peace, is better than a just war. It is a
divine saying of an heathen man: (...): It is good to contend for good things.
The Papists have no matter of rejoicing, seeing they have greater and sharper
controversies at home, and seeing this tends both to the further opening of
their shame, and thrustyng out of their remnants, which yet remain among us.
The weak may not be offended, consyderyng that (even in the Church of God, and
among those of the Church) there has been as great varieties of
judgments, as these are. For what weightier controversies can there be, than
whether we shall rise again or no, These were offenses, but woe to the
authors.
whether circumcision were necessary to be observed of those which believed?
And yet the first was amongst the Church of the Corinthes, the other was
first in Jerusalem and Antioche and after in the Churches of Galatia, and yet
they the Churches, and that the true religion which was there professed.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is very true, and sufficiently proved in that Answer to the Admonition,
that the authors thereof be contentidus, and give occasion to the Papists of
staundering the religion professed, and to the weak of offense. For whosoever
troubles the peace of the Church, or divide themselves from the Church for
external things, they be contentious: but these men do so, therefore they be
contentious: the mayor proposition is grounded upon the words of Saint
Paul. 1. Corinthians. 8. 9. and. 10. but especially upon these words of the.
11. Chapter. If any be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the
Churches of God. Whereas he purposely speaks of such, as be contentious for
external matters: whereupon that is grounded that Bullinger says: That those
be contentious, which trouble and divide the Bulling.
church for external things. And that also, which Zuinglius in his book de
baptismo, speaking of contentious Anabaptists, writes: They go about
innouations of their own private authority in those Churches where the
Gospel is truly taught, and that in external Zuinglius de baptis.
things. And in his Ecclesiastes he calls them authors of contentions, and
troublers of the church, which strive about external matters. And surely this
is an evident token that Zuingl in ecclesiast.
the accusation is true, because they and their companions (for the mosre
part) make contention wheresoever they come, and especially in those places
where the Gospel has with most diligence bin taught, as experience
sufficiently proves. Furthermore the time and manner of publishing their
pamphlets, argues ye same most evidently.

The truth and necessity of those things for the which they contend, rest as
yet in trial. Surely if they be matters necessary to salvation, then is there
some just cause of breking the peace of the Church for them, but if they be
matters of no such weight, then can you not excuse either your self, or them.

In deed the Papists have no just matter of rejoicing, for they disagree both
in me, and also in far greater matters tha^ these be, even in ye chiefest
points of their religion: but this is no sufficient excuse for us, we may not
disagree in truth, because they disagree in error. Neither ought the weak to be
offended, because such co^tentions have bin usual in the Church, as I have also
showed in mine Epistle dedicatorie to the Church of England. But yet woe be
unto those by whom such offenses come.

T. C.
And it is to be remembered that these controversies, for the most part, are not
between many. For sundry of those things which are comprehended in the answer
to the Admonition, have (as I am persuaded) few favorers, of those especially,
which are of any stayed, or sou^der judgment in ye scriptures, and have seen,
or red of the government, and order of other Churches: so that in deed (the
father of that answer excepted) we have this controversy, oftentimes, rather
with the Papists, than with those which profess the Gospel, as we do.

Io. Whitgifte.
Certainly I do not willingly defend any thing against the word of God, or of
mine own private persuasion, but I have either sufficient warrant of the word
of God, or some godly learned and zealous authors judgment for the same. If I
have done otherwise I trust I shall hear of it in this book; but I am fully
persuaded that all men of stayed and sound judgment, join with me in these
matters, and such especially as have had the best experience of the order and
government of other reformed Churches: for proof whereof, I refer you to the
wisest, godlyest, and best learned among the clergy in this land.

T. C.
And where as last of all, it is said, that this precedeth of envy, of
singularity, and of popularitie, although these be no sufficient reasons
against the truth of the cause, which is neither envious, singular, nor
popular, and although they be such, as might be severally, by great
likelyhodes, and probabilities refuted: yet because the knowledge of these
things, pertains only to God, which is the searcher of the heart and raynes,
and for avoiding of to much tediousness, we will rest in his judgment, tarry
for the day wherein the secrets of hearts shall be made manifest. And yet all
men do see, how unjustly we be accused of singularity, Notable untruths, as
will fall out in trial.
which propound nothing that the Scriptures, do not teach, the writers both
old and new for the most part affirm, the examples of the Primitive
Churches, and of those which are at these days confirm.

Io. Whitgifte.
Whether if proceed of envy or no, let the manner both of their, and your
writings declare. Popularitie you can not avoid, seeing you seek so great an
equality, commit so many things to the voices of the people, and in sundry
places so greatly magnifye and extol them, than the which three what can be
more popular? Singularity, and the properties thereof.
It is Singularity to deuyde your self from that Church, which both
profess the word of God truly, and is not to be touched in any point of
doctrine necessary to salvation. It is true that a godly learned writer says:
Charity Musc. in. (...) Mat.
knittes together, and reconcileth: singularity cutteth in pieces, and
divides: it is the beginning and root of all heresy, to hate and contemn
the communion of the church. And a little after, There be some contentious
persons whom no church can please, always having some thing to blame in other,
but nothing in themselves, which is a manifest sign of singularity. But
because the minds and affections of men, are certainly known only to God, the
determinate judgment hereof I also refer unto him.

As for this bold assertion, that you propeund nothing that the scriptures do
not teach. etc. how true it is, must hereafter by examination appear.

The Epist. of T. C. Sect. 13.
All these accusations as well against the cause, as the favorers thereof,
albeit they be many and diverse: yet are they no other, tha^ which have bin long
since in the Prophets, apostles, and our savior Christ's, and now of late in
our times objected against the truth, and the professors thereof. And therefore
as ye sun of the truth then appeared, and brake through al those clouds, which
rose against it, to stop the light of it: so no doubt this cause being of the
same nature, will have the same effect. And as all those sclanders could not
bring the truth in disgrace, with those yt loved it: so the children of ye
truth through these untrue reports, will neither leave the love of this cause,
which they have already conceived, nor yet cease to enquire diligently, and to
judge indifferently of those surmises which are put up aagaynst it.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words of course, which men of any sect (though not truly) will
apply unto themselves, if they be otherwise dealt with, than they can well bear.
The truth certainly can not be kept under by any means, and yet sometime error
ouershadoweth the truth even as the clouds do the Sunn. My hope also is, that
men will not be carried away with slanderous reports* (for if they should,
then musre you needs prevail) but with sound reasons, and the truth of the
cause.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. 14.
Moreover, seeing that we have once ouerco^med al these lets, and climed over
them, when they were cast in our way, to hinder us from coming from the gross
darkness of Popery, unto ye glorious light of the Gospel: there is no cause
why now they should stay our course to further perfection, considering that
neither the style is higher now, tha^ it was before (being the very self same
objections) and in all this time we ought so to have grown in knowledge of the
truth, that in stead of being then able to leap over a hedge, we should now
have our feet so prepared by the Gospel, that they should be as the feet of
a hynde, able to surmount even a wall if need were.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is but one truth, and that is certain: when we have obtained if, we must
therein remain constant, without altering: whosoever shall ouerleap or ouerrun
this wall, must of necessity procure unto himself great danger. and therefore
according to the old proverb, Look before thou leap.

We must grow in faith and knowledge, and always be growing and going forward,
but it does not therefore follow, yt we must daily invent new opinions, or
broach new dectrines, and alter in judgment: we must grow in strength of
faith, we must increace in practice and love of virtue, we must study to
increase our knowledge, that we may be the more confirmed in the truth that we
have learned out of the word of God. This is an evil collection, we must grow
in the knowledge of the truth, therefore we must always be altering and
changing our religion.

The Epistle of T. C. Sect. vlt.
The sum of al is, that the cause may be looked upon with a single eye,
without al mist of partiality, may be heard with an indifferent ear, without
the wax of prejudice: the arguments of both sides may be weighed, not with the
changeable weights of custom, of time, of men, which notwithstanding (Popish
excepted) shall be showed to be more for the cause than against it: but with the
just balances of the incorruptible and unchangeable word of God. And I humbly
beseech the Lord, to increase in us the spirit of knowledge, and judgment,
that we may discern things which differ one from an other, and that we may be
lyncere, and without offense, until the day of Christ.

Io. Whitgifte.
This do I in like manner desire with all my heart, and to the latter end of
it, I say Amen. The midst if you prove not, then shall you be blamed, for
making such a brag.

T. C. The Author to the Reader.
I Am humbly to crave at thy hand (gentle reader) that thou would vouchesafe
diligently and carefully to compare Master Doctors answer, and my reply,
both that thou may the better understand the truth of the cause, and that
the untempered speches of him (especially that whippeth (...) desires that
which * as much as lies in him) he has sought to ^inder.
other so sharply for them) which I have in a manner altogether passed by, and
his lose conclusions, which I have (to avoid tediousness) not so fully
pursued, may ye better appear: which thing as I crave to be done through the
whole book, so chiefly I desire it may be done in the beginning, where the
reader shall not be able so well to understand what is said of me, unless he
have M. D. book before him. Vain and un s^fficient ex^u se^ why he ha^h not
^et down the answer to the Ad^onition.
The cause of which diversity rose of that, that I first purposed to set
down his answer before my reply, as he did the Admonition, before his answer.
But afterward considering that (his book being already in the hands of men)
it would be double charges to buy it again: And especially weighing with my
self that through the slownesse of the printe, for want of help, the repli^ by
that means should come forth later, than was conuement (for although he might
commodiously bring in the Admonition, being short, yet the same could not be
done in his book, swelling in that sort which it does) I say, these things
considered, I changed my mind, and have therefore set down the causes, which
moved me so to do, because I know, that thos^, if any be, which have
determined to continue their foreiudged opinions against the cause, whatsoever
be alleged, will hereupon take occasion to surmize, that I have left out his
answer, to the end that it might the less appear, wherein I have passed over
any weyghte of his reasons: whereas, had it not bin for these causes, which I
have before alleged, my earneste desire was, to have set his answer before
my reply: whereof I call the Lord to witness, whom I know to be a sharp
judge, against those which shall abuse his holy name to any untruth.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have well provided for the comparing of Master Doctors answer with your
reply: and howsoever you protest, ye your earnest desire was to set it down
before your The true ca^ ses why T. C. set not down the answer.
Reply, yet the sequel will declare the contrary: for it shall evidently
appear that therefore you have omitted it, because you are loath they should be
compared together, least your frivolous Replies, your childish collections,
your wilful deprauing, your fraudulent dismembring of my book, should
manifestly appear. Full well knew you, that your fautours (in whose hands
especially your books are kept) would not take pains to compare them both
together, except they had bin joined together, that they might have done it
with one labor. And suerly herein you have dealt very unhonestly with me, done
me great injury, and not performed that toward me, that you before required
of me in one of your pamphlets, and do now again require of me in the end of
this book. But wise and indifferent men will soon epsy the causes, if it
will please them to pervse this book with some diligence.

My untempered speeches if they be compared with your floutes and disdaynful
phrases, or with either of ye Admonitio^s, will seem I am sure very modest.
And no doubt you would have set down some examples of some of them, if they had
bin such as you would make the reader believe. But in your book he may see the
humbleness of your spirit, and judge whether that one quality be found in
you or no, which Zuinglius in Zuinglius.
his book called Elenchus contra Anabap. and in his books de baptismo, and
Ecclesiast. and Bullinger in his book Aduersus Anabap. do say, is common to
the Anabaptists, that is, to revile Bullinger.
the ministers of the word, and much more bitterly to inuey against them (if
they withstand their errors) than against the Papists. Truly if you should have
written against the doggeddest Papist, or the pestilentest heretic that ever
was, you could not have invented, how in more spiteful manner to deface him:
but how truly, it rests in ye trial.

Touching lose conclusions, it is unlike that you have omitted any, seeing yt
you have famed those to be which are not. Wherein your false dealing plainly
appears, and shall b^ made manifest. Your excuses for omitting my book in your
reply be mere excuses: for why should you run in suspicion of corrupt dealing
for saving. x^. d. in an other man's purse? as for the volume of your book it
would not have been much bigger, if you had spared your superfluous digressions,
cut off your vain words, and kept in your scornful and opprobrious speeches.
What I think of your protestation, I have told you before.

To his loving Nurse, the Christian Church of England, Io. VVhitgifte a membre
and minister of the same, wishes peace in Christ, and continuance of his
glorious Gospel, even to the worlds end.
THere be diverse things, and especially five, that when I first took this
labor in hand, had almost utterly dissuaded me from the same.

First because I do with all my heart hate contention and strife, and
especially in matters of Religion, among such as profess the self same
Gospel.

Secondly, for that I feared greatly least some sclaunder might tedounde to
the Gospel by this open contention, seeing that God is not the author of
contention or confusion, but of peace. 1. Cor. 14.


Thirdly, I doubted whether this kind of dealing by writing might minister
matter to the common adversaries of the Gospel, to rejoice and glory, and to
flatter themselves the more in their damnable errors.

Fourthly, I greatly suspected the slanderous reports of the backbiter, and
of the unlearned tongue: the one, because he loves to speak evil, and hear
evil of all those that be not in all points inclinable to his fancy, whereof
I have great experience, being my self most unjustly sclaundered by that
viperous kind of men: the other, because they be not able to judge of
controversies according to learning and knowledge, and therefore are ruled by
affection, and carried headlong with blind zeal, into diverse sinister
judgments, and erroneous opinions.

Lastly, because I know sundry (in all respects) worthy men, much more able to
deal in such matters than I am.

But when I considered my duty toward God, to his Church, and to our most
gracious Lady and sovereign Elizabeth her Majesty (by whose ministry God
has given his Gospel free passage unto us) the first stop and hindrance was
answered. For I thought that, that duty ought not to be omitted for any such
cause, seeing God and not man, shall be my judge: and also that not he which
defends the truth, and confu^eth errors, but he that impugneth the truth,
and spreddeth sects, is the authoure of contention.

Likewise when I remembered that it was no new thing to have contentions,
sects, and schisms in the Church of Christ, (especially when it enjoys
external peace) and that we had manifest examples there of from time to time,
(first in Peter, and Paul ad Gal. 2. Paul and Barnabas, Acto. 15. then in
the Church of the Corinthians. 1. Cor. 1. and. 3. Afterward betwixt the
oriental Church and occidentall Church, touching Easter and such like
matters: Betwixt the Bishops of Aphrica and the Bishops of Italy for
rebaptising of Heretics: and sundry times, yea usually in the external peace
of the Church, as may be more at large seen in Eusebius lib. 4. eccl. histo.
cap. 6. and libr. 5. cap. 24. 25. 26. and li. 8. etc. Likewise in Ruffinus lib.
1. ca. 1. In Zozom. lib. 6. cap. 4. In Basilius Magnus ep. 61. ad fratres and
episcopos in occidente, and ep. 69. and in sundry other ancient and learned
histories and writers. For the second point I was satisfied: For I thought,
that, that could be no slander to this Church, which by the malice of Satan
has been practiced in all Churches even since the ascension of Christ.

Thirdly, when I perceived that these men against whom I now write, did agree
with the adversaries in defacing the state of Religion, the order of Common
prayers, the Ministry, the Sacraments, the kind of Government, etc. used
and allowed in this Realm of England, and that in as opprobrious and
spiteful manner as the adversaries do: likewise that they seek to overthrow
the self same pillars of this Church with the adversaries (although not by the
self same means) I thought that the confutation and overthrow of the one,
should be the confutation and overthrow of the other, and therefore the
adversaries to have small cause in deed of rejoicing.

Against backbyters, slaunderers, and unlearned toungs, I shall by Gods grace,
arm my self with patience, for their talk is no sufficient cause for a man to
abstain from doing his duty.

To conclude, I (although the vnworthyest and vnmeetest of a great number) was
bold to take upon me this enterprise, partly to show that the book called
the Admonition, is not such, but that it may easily be answered, and especially
to satisfy mine own conseience: for I considered that if no man had taken
upon him the envy of the common sort, in with standing the enterprises and
proceedings of the Anabaptists when they began in Germany, Anabaptisme had
ouerrunne those Churches, and utterly destroyed them.

These were the reasons that satisfied the former objections, and especially
moved me to take upon me this labor, wherewith if I can also satisfy others, I
have my desire: if not, yet have I done my duty, and satisfied mine own
conscience. And forasmuch as the matter touches the state of the whole
Church of England, I thought it most meet to dedicate this my book, rather
unto the same generally, than to any one particular member thereof: protesting
that if I have affirmed any thing therein, that by learning and good reasons
may be proved erroneous, I will reform the same, for I wholly submit it to
the rule of Gods word, and the judgment of those that be learned, discrete
and wise. The Lord bless thee (O dear spouse of Christ) with the
continuance of his Gospel, of the Queens Majesty, and of godly peace and
quietness. Amen.

An answer to the whole Epistle to the Church.
T. C.
WHat causes either pulled you forward, or thruste you backwarde, to write, or
not to write, and how in this dispute with your self, in the end you were
resolved to write in this sort, I leave it unto the judgment of the Lord,
who only knows the secrets of the heart, and will in his good time unseal
them. But if there be any place of conjecture, the hatred of contention, which
you set down, as the first and principal cause, that beat you back from
writing, might well have bin put, as the last and least, or rather none at all.
For if peace had bin so precious unto you (as you pretend) you would not have
brought so many hard words, bitter reproaches, e^mylike speeches (as it were
sticks and coals) to double and treble the heat of contention: If the
sharpness of the Admonition misliked you, and you think that they outreached
in some vehemency of words, how could you more effectually have confuted that,
than to have in a quiet and ^ide spirit set them in the way, which (in your
opinion) had left it? Now in words condemning it, and approving it in your
deeds, I will not say that you do not so much mislike this sharpness, as you
are A charitable figure.
sorry, that you are prevented, and are not the first in it. But this I may well
say unto you, which he said: Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam? what should
I hear words, when I see the deeds? In the fourth reason whereby you were
discouraged to write, if by backbiters, and unlearned tongues, viperous kind of
men, not able to judge of controversies, carried away with affections and blind
zeal, into diverse sinister judgments, and erroneous* opinions, you mean al
those that think not as you do in these matters, I answer for my self, and
for as many as I know of them, that they are they, which first desire (so it
be truly) to hear and speak all good of you. But if that be not, through
your perseverance, in the maintenance of the corruptions of this Church (which
you should help to purge) then the same are they, that desire, that both the
evil which you have done, and that which you have yet in your heart to do, may
be known, to the less discredit of the truth and sincerity, which you,
with such might and maine, do strive against.

Touching our A manifest perverting of the words and meaning of the Epistle.
unlearned tongues we had rather a great deal, they were unlearned, than they
should be as theirs, * which have taught their tongues to speak falsely. And how

you would make the world believe that we, and our tongs be, I hope (through
the goodness of God) they shall be learned enough, to defend the truth,
against all the learning that you shall be able to assault it with. If those be

know you that you have not opened your mouth against earth, but you have set
it against heaven, and for all indifferent judgment, it will easily perceive,
that you are as far from the spirit of * John Baptist, as you are near to
his manner of speech, which you use. whither it be affection, Math. 3. 7
or blind zeal, that we follow, and are driven by, it will then appear, when
the reasons of both sides, being laid out, shall be wayed indifferently. Whereas
you say, that your duty toward God, and the Queen her Majesty, moved you to
take this labor in hand, it will fall out, upon the discourse, that as you
have not served the Lord God in this enterprise and work of yours, so have you
done nothing less than any godly duty which you owe unto her Majesty, so
that the best that can be thought of you herein, is, that where in an evil
matter, you could yield no duty, yet now you have done that, which you thought
a duty, which judgment, we will so long keep of you, until you shall by
oppugmng of a known truth, declare the contrary, which we hope will not be.
What truth it is, that we impugn, and you defend, let it in the name of God
appear, by our several proofs and answers of both sides. And as for the
slanderous surmises, whereby in your third and last consideration, you set the
Papists of the one side of us, and the Anabaptists of the other, and us in the
midst, reaching out our hands (as it were) to them both: first, it ought not
to be strange unto us, miserable sinners, seeing that the Lord hunselfe,
without all sin, was placed in the midst of two grievous malefactors, as
though he had bin worse than they both. Then for answer of these slanderous
speeches, I will refer the Reader to those places, where these general
charges are given out in more particular manner.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is well that you are content to rest in his judgment, until the time
come: for so indeed ought we to do: as the Apostle admonishes. 1. Cor. 4.
Nolite ante tempus quicquam 1. Cor. 4*
iudicare: Judge not before the time, until the Lord come. etc.

Your conjecture is a mere conjecture in deed, for undoubtedly these so many
hard words of mine, bitter reproaches. etc. would not have bin kept so secret
of you, if you could have had them foorthcomming. But be it so, as you will
needs have it, yet have I not in like bitterness of speech spoken against
them, as Zuinglius, Bucer, Calvin, Bullinger, Gualter. etc. have done against
the like troublers of the Church: who had notwithstanding all these pretenses
and clokes, to shadow their contentions with, which either you, or the Authors
of the Admonition do allege: for they pretend the Glory of God, the Purity
of Religion, the safety of the Church, as Master Bucer witnesses in his
Coment* upon the Ephe. Cap. 4. Master Calvin in his book aduersus Anabap.
Gastius in his book de exordio and erroribus catabaptist. Zuinglius in his
book called Ecclesi. And Bullinger in his book aduersus Anabaptist: as I have
by setting down their very words more at large declared in the second edition
of my answer to the Admonition. But grant, that for the love of peace, and
hatred of contention, and earnest zeal that I bear to this Church of Christ
in England, and dutiful affection to my sovereign, I have sometimes passed the
bounds of modesty (wherein I will neither accuse, nor excuse my self) yet are
my speeches in bitterness far inferior to those opprobries, slanders, and
disdainefull words uttered either in the first or second Admonition, or in your
Reply. And where have you learned to epsy a mote in another man's eye, and not
to see the beam that is in your own? or what point of Rhetoric do you call
it, to charge me in the beginning of your book with that, that you yourselfe
most outrageously fall into sundry times, almost in every leaf? or how unwise
are you to give unto me that council, which you yourselfe in no respect
observe? But of both our modesties, and manners of writing, we must be content
that other men judge which shall read our books: and therefore it is but in
vain either for you to accuse, or me to excuse. God grant us both the spirit
of modesty and humility.

In my fourth reason, by backbiters, I mean all such as are ready to hear
evil, and speak evil of all men that be not of their judgment, and such as
cease not continually to deprave those especially that be of any countenance
and calling, the which vice does abundantly reign (I will not say in all) but
in a great sort of your sect, and those learned also. I could name some which
go from place to place for that purpose especially, although under other
pretenses: and in this quality they agree with the Anabaptists: as may appear
more plainly in the notes of the Anabaptists qualities, contained in the
second edition of my answer to the Admonition, to the which for breuities
sake I refer you.

By unlearned tongues, I mean such of the common people as you have deluded,
who in deed are carried away by a blind and preposterous zeal, and therefore
the rather to be excused. I know there be some (both of the learned and
unlearned sort) among you, that have milder spirits than the rest, such I do
not blante in this point, I would other would follow their modesty.

As for the good that you and other would so gladly speak of me, it evil
appears in this book, where you do but devise how possibly you may deface
me: in deed both you, and some others (if you considered your duties toward
me, and my dealings toward you, whilst you kept your selves within your
bonds) have small occasion to whisper of me in corners as you do, or otherwise
to deal so unchristianly with me. The evil that you know by me, utter it and
spare not, I desire no silence, so that it be done where I may come to the
answering of it. And surely he that shall read this your book, cannot but
conceive, that if you knew any evil thing by me, it would not be concealed.
But to all reproaches I will answer, as they come in order, and proclayme
defyance against you, for any thing that you can justly charge me with.

I intend not to maintain any corruptions of this Church, I will seek for the
redress thereof as earnestly as you shall, and more orderly, and therefore I
trust more effectually. But I neither can, nor may suffer that which is
lawfully, and by due order established, unlawfully and out of order by you to
be defaced. This your pretense of clensing the Church from corruptions, is but
the accustomed excuse of the Nouatians, Donatists, and Anabaptists, as you
know welynough: and therefore before you condemn me to be a defender of the
corruptions of this Church, you must first prove them to be corruptions: and
when you have so done, you must also declare them to be such corruptions, as
deserve this stir and hurly burly for them: for there were great corruptions
in the Church of the Corinthes, and yet the Apostle greatly misliked such as
stirred up contentions for the same: so has there bin always imperfections in
the Church, especially in external things: and yet such as therefore did break
the peace of it, were always counted as contentious, and condeinned as
schismatiques: look the writers before of me mentioned in their books against
the Anabaptists.

As I said before, so I say again, let the evil which I have done, and that
which you say I have yet in my heart to do (wherein you take upon you the office
of God) be proclaimed at the standard in Cheap, or elsewhere (so it be done
publicly that I may answer it, and not in corners as it has bin) and if I
fail in my purgation, let me sustain the pain due for the same. I ask no
favor, I fear no accuser, I refuse no indifferent judge. And if you have any
thing to say against me, do it orderly, do it lawfully, not in corners, not in
libels. This I speak not to justify my self before God (for in that respect I
know more imperfections in my self than I do in any other, because I know my
self better than I know any man else) but before man, in doing my duty, in
observing laws, in walking in my vocation. etc.

I do not accuse you all, for lack of learning, neither can you, or any man
else gather any such thing of my words: God grant you may use your learning to
better purpose, than to the disturbing of the Church, and stirring up of
contentions, where the Gospel is truly preached. This is but a slender
collection to say that therefore I accuse you all of vnlearnednesse, because I
say that I greatly suspected the slanderous reports of backbiters, and of the
unlearned tongue. Surely there be both learned and unlearned tongues among you
too much given to backbiting, and slandering, as it is well known: and yet I
accuse not all. Let them which find this imperfection in them selves, in the
name of God amend it, for it is a foul fault.

In that they like vipers with slanderous reports, sting men privately, they
be not the generation of Christ, but of Christ's adversary, howsoever otherwise
they seem to be godly and zealous: For Christ does will them to love their
enemies, to pray Math. 5.
for them that curse them. etc. so far would he have them from backbiting
and slandering of their brethren, and of such as profess the name of Christ
with them. He that speaks against slanderous tongues, does not open his mouth
against Heaven, but against that vice which is earthly, yea hellish: neither
must you think that your Church is so pure, but that it has in it a number
such as well deserve this reprehension. And therefore these great speeches of
yours might well have bin forborne, your learning and reasons which you so often
boast of, must be left to the judgment of others.

What duty I have performed toward God and her Majesty, lies not in your
power to judge: I am fully persuaded, that I have done that which my duty
toward them both requires of me, and urges me unto in this behalf: and I
doubt not, but that therein I have done good service to them both. Your
judgment of me I do not greatly regard, so long as you are affected as you
are. I will die rather than impugn a known truth, neither will I cease from
defending of that which I am fully persuaded to be a truth.

In my third and last consideration, all is true that I said, neither can you
deny it. Most true it is that in defacing this present state of Religion, that
is, the order of common prayers, the ministry, the Sacraments, the kind of
government, you join with the Papists, although you use in some points
contrary reasons: and in disquieting the Church for external things, you
join with the Anabaptists. And in opprobrious speeches and tauntes you are
inferioure to neither of them both. And yet I do not say that you be either
Papists or Anabaptists. Prove that I herein speak untruly of you, and I will
willingly make you amends.

A brief Examination of the reasons used in the Book, called an Admonition to
the Parliament.
Io. Whitgifte.
FIrst, in that book the scripture is most vntollerably abused, and
unlearnedly applied, quoted only in their margent to delude both such, as for
lack of learning cannot, and such as either for slothfulness or some
preiudicate opinion, will not examine the same: as I have particularly declared
in my answer following.

T. C. An answer to that which is called a brief examination of the reasons
used in the Admonition to the Parliament.
IF the scriptures had bin applied to the maintenance of the abomination of
the Mass, and some Vain shifts to color the un apt allegati^s of scriptu^es
by the (...). Charity do^he not cover open and notorious faults.
other of the grosest of antichristianitie, you could have said no more, nor
used vehementer speech than this, that they are most vntollerably abused, and
unlearnedly applied. And then where is charity, which covers the multitude
of faults, especially in brethren, when you do not only not Pro. 10.
cover them, but also take away their garments whereby they are covered. I
will not deny, but that there be some few places quoted, which might have bin
spared, but there are a great number, which (M. Doctor) tosseth and throws
away so lightly, which he shall perceive to sit nearer him than he is, or at
the least seems to be aware of. And to bring to pass that the quotations in
the margent might appear to the reader more absurd, M Doctor has besides
the There is no su^e advantage taken.
advantage which he takes of the faults of the Printer, used two unlawful
practices especially. Whereof the one is, that whereas the Admonition does quote
the scripture, not only to prove the matters which it handles* but sometimes
also to note the place from whence the phrase of speech is taken, M. Doctor
does go about to make his reader believe, that those places which be
alleged for proof of the Scriptures alleged for proof of the phrase.
phrase, are quoted for proof of the matter. The other practice is, that where
the Admonition for the shortness which it promises, and was necessary in
that case, could not apply the places, M. Doctor presuming too much of the
ignorance of his reader, thought he might make him believe, that any thing
else was meant by those places, than that which they meant in deed, and for
which they were alleged. And where you say the quotations are only to delude
such. etc. I see you hold it no fault in your self, which you condemn so
precisely in others, that is, to judge before the time, to sit in the
conscience, to affirm definitely of their thoughts, contrary to their own
protestation. But seeing you lift up our imperfections so high* and set them as
it were upon a stage for all men to be looked of, to the discredit of the
truth which we do mainteyne, you shall not think much if your poverty be
pointed unto, in those things wherein you would carry so great countenance of
store.

Io. Whitgifte.
The abusing of the scriptures, and the unjust applying of them, is to be
maintained The abusing of scripture is to be maintained in none.
neither in Papist, nor other: and least of all in such as seeming to give most
authority unto them, do by that means give occasion to the adversary to
contemn them. What just occasion might the Papists have of triumphing, if they
should understand that we as licenciously wring and wrest the scriptures to
serve our turn, as they do to serve theirs? And truly as well may they apply
the scriptures that they use in the defense of their Transubstantiation,
Purgatory, Merits, Images. etc. as the authors of the Admonition can do to
prove those things, for the which they do oftentimes allege them. And
therefore I think that my speech in that point against them cannot be too
sharp.

Charity does not so cover open and manifest sins, that it suffers them to
be vnreprehended, but it remitteth private offenses, it does not publish secret
sins at the first: neither does it disclose all things that it knows to the
defamation of a brother, when he may be otherwise reformed. But this fault of
theirs in abusing the scriptu^s is public, printed in books, in every man's
hand: used to discredit and deface this Church of England: which no true
member of the same ought to suffer. Wherefore in detecting this untrue dealing,
I have not broken any rule of Charity, but done my bounden duty.

If there be so many of their quotatio^s tossed and thrown away by me. etc. I
trust you will let me understand of them as occasion is offered: which surely
you have done in very few places, and in those wherein you have done it, you
have done it very slenderly and loosely, as will appear. I take very little or
no advantage at al of the Printer, but salve that as much as I can: and where
as you say that where the Admonition quoteth the scripture, not only to prove
the matter, but to note the place from whence the phrase of speech is taken.
etc. that is a very feeble excuse, and far fetched: for to what purpose should
they so do? or why do you not by some examples declare unto us, that they have
so done? this is but a shifte, and argues that you are not purposed to
acknowledge any fault, be it never so manifest. And therefore little hope there
is of any amendment. And whereas you also say that the Admonition for the
shortness which it promises. etc. to that I answer as before, and I add
that it was very uncircumspectly done of them, to quote places which could
not be applied to that purpose for the which they were quoted. In such matters
men ought to have such regard unto the time, that they abuse not the word of
God. But I have (as you say) otherwise applied their quotations, than they
meant indeed. I think you will let me hear of it, when you come to those
places, and then shall I shape you an answer.

To what purpose should the margent of their book be pestred with such unapt
quotations, but only to delude the reader, and to make him believe that all
things there contained be grounded of the express word of God? where things be
open and manifest, there a man may judge, though he sit not in the conscience
of him of whom he judges. As for Protestations they be now so usual and
common in every matter, and the sequel so many times contrary to the same,
that it is hard for a man to give credit at all times to all persons
protesting: there is experience of it, and I could allege examples, if I
were disposed.

Set out my poverty as much as you can, and spare it not: but take heed least
in so doing you show yourselfe poor indeed, and that in those things
especially wherein you seem most to complain of my poverty.

A brief examination. etc.
Secondly their proofs consist especially of these arguments. The Argu. a
sec^dum quid ad simpliciter.
first is ab eo quod est secundum quid, ad id quod simpliciter est, as such
and such things were not in the Apostles time, Ergo, they ought not to be now.
Which kind of argument is very deceitful, and the mother and welspring of many
both old and new schisms: of old, as of them that called themselves
Apostolicos, and of the Aerians: of new, as of the Anabaptists, who considering
neither the diversity of times concerning the external ecclesiastical
policy, nor the true liberty of the Christian religion in externe rites and
ceremonies, in matters neither commanded, nor forbidden in Gods Law, nor the
authority of Christian magistrates in the Christian congregation, concerning
the same, have boldly enterprised to stir up many and heinous errors: For if
these reasons should take place: the Apostles used it not, Ergo it is not
lawful for us to use it: or this either: they did it, Ergo we must needs do
it: then no Christians may have any place to abide in, they may have no
Christian Princes: no ministration of sacraments in Churches and such like: for
the Apostles had no place to abide in, they had no Christian Princes to govern
them, no Churches to minister sacraments in. etc. Likewise we must have al
things Acts. 2. and. 4.
common: we must depart with all our possessions when we be converted Math. 19.
to the Gospel: baptize abroad in the fields: minister the communion Acts. 8.
in private houses only: be always under the cross and under Act. 2. and. 20.
Tyrants, and such like: For the Apostles had al things common, departed from
their possessions, baptized abroad in fields, ministered the communion in
private houses, were always under persecutors and Tyrants. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
To this kind of argument and that which is here spoken. T. C. makes no answer
at all in this place, what he does hereafter we shall understand when we come
to it.

Abriefe examination. etc.
Another kind of argument is much like unto this, and is taken Ab authoritate
negative.
ab authoritate negative, which in matters of salvation and damnation holds
when we reason ab authoritate scripturae, from the authority of the scripture,
but not else: For this argument (it is not commanded in the scripture to be
done, nor there expressed Ergo it ought not to be done) is so far out of the
way and so erroneous, that it is not tolerable: for it takes away the most
part of all due circumstances, without the which either after one manner or
other, the very institutio^s of Christ cannot be observed: For how is it
possible to receive the holy communion, but either sitting, standing, kneeling,
walking or lying: either at one time or other: in the morning or at night:
before meat or after meat: clothed or naked: in this place or in that place.
etc. and yet none of these circumstances are in Scripture commanded, or by
necessary collection may thereof be gathered: the same is to be said of the
observation of times, of common prayers, and other convenient and necessary
orders in the Church. If this argument were good, then all good laws and
ordinances made for the advancing of true religion, and establishing of good
orders, were to be abolished, which were the very root, and welspring of
stubbornness, obstinacy, sedition, disobedience, and confusion.

T. C.
FOr the arguments themselves, they shall be seen what they be in their
places, so shall also that be answered, which M. Doctor brings here, for the
confutation, being straight way after, and in sundry other places repeated in
this book, I will touch that which is not repeated, and that is, that M.
Doctor makes it a^ A wrangling cavil.
indifferent thing for men and women to receive the supper of the Lord, clothed
or naked. This sauoreth strongly of the sect of the Adamites.

Superfluous proofs.
S. Paul which commends ye preservation of godliness and peace, unto the
civil magistrate, does also commend unto him the providing, that honesty be
kept, and M. Doctor makes it an indifferent thing, Where found you these words?
to come either naked or clothed unto the Lords table: verily there is It is
less honesty, in charging M. Doctor falsely.
small honesty in this. And if the heathen which knew not God, did account it a
filthy thing for a stage plaier, to come upon the stage without a slop, how
much more filthy is it for a Christian to come naked unto the Lords table? and
the contrary thereof, is necessarily collected of the scripture,
notwithstanding that M. Doctor says otherwise. A digression from the matter
to the person.
They which have heard M. Doctor read in the schools can tell, that he being
there amongst learned men, never used to reduce the contrary arguments of the
adversaries, to the places of the fallacions, and yet that was the fittest
place for him t^ have showed his knowledge in, because there they should have
bin best understood: now that he professes himself to be a Doctor of the
people, which because they have not learned these things, cannot understand
them, he dasheth out his Logic: what may be probably gathered hereof, I
leave to every man's consideration: this is certain, that circumstances of
place and persons, which he so often urges, are not well observed of him, when
Logic speaks in the Church, and is mute in the schools: when things are
handled more learnedly amongst thepeople, and more popularly amongst the
learned. It is truly said, (...). A good thing is evil, when it comes out of
season. But to observe what Art here is showed, I would gladly know what place
of the Where be they called falla cions* you ca^ not deny them to be false
arguments.
fallacions, either an argument Ab authoritate negative is, or of negatiues by
comparison. Aristotle setting forth places, whereunto all fallacions may be
called, makes no mention of these, and if these were fallacions, and were such
as he imagines them, they should be referred unto the former place, Ab eo quod
est secundum quid, ad id quod est simpliciter, for these reasons, the Scripture
has it not, therefore it ought not to be, or the minister was known by
doctrine, therefore by doctrine only, and not by apparel: If I say they be
fallacions, they be referred unto that place, and whether they be, or no, and
also how corruptly, and otherwise than is meant they be gathered, it shall
afterward appear. In the mean season in a small matter here is a great
fault, not only to muent new places, but of one place to make three, and may
as well make a thousand.

Io. Whitgifte.
The arguments are left unanswered, because in deed they can not be answered.
Wherefore T. C. picketh other quarrels, and here begins his vain of gybing
and jesting. Who would have made this ado about clothed or naked, but such a
one as is delighted in quareling? or who can gather, that by using this
example, I would have men to receive the Communion naked, or once surmise that
I think it lawful for them so to do, and therefore to savor strongly of the
sect of the Adamites, but he that is disposed to piece out his reply with
such imagined toys. I pray you where do I make it an indifferent thing, to
come either clothed or naked unto the Lords table? Set down my words: but if
I say no such thing, if I have not so much as once named this word
indifferent in that place: then surely have you dealte with me, not only not
indifferently, but very dishonestly, in laying this thing to my charge. The
example is apt, and proves that thing manifestly that I allege it for: that
is, that the most part of the due circumstances (without the which the very
institutions of Christ in his Sacraments can not be observed, be not commanded
particularly, nor expressed in the Scriptures, but left to the Church to
determine. I do not say, that it is an indifferente thing, I know it does
necessarily appertain to comeliness: but I deny it to be particularly
expressed in the Scriptures: and therefore I say, that although all things
necessary to salvation be in the Scriptures manyfestly contained, yet all
things necessary to order and comeliness are not there expressed, much less
such things as according to time, place, and persons may be altered. If this
doctrine be not true, why do you not overthrow the other examples also? why
can you find no other faults in this argument? If this example so trouble
you, I will tell you plainly from whom I had it, even from that famous
Martyr, and notable learned man, D. Ridley, sometime Bishop of London, who used
the same example to the same purpose, in his conference by writing with M.
Hoper, exhibited up to the Council in the time of king Edward the sixte, the
true Copy whereof I have. Surely he was no Adamite, but a man of singular
judgment and learning.

Touching my reading in the Schools (which you here opprobriously object
unto me) though I know that the University had a far better opinion of me,
than I deserved, and that there were a great many which were in all respects
better able to do that office, than my self, yet I trust I did my duty,
and satisfied them. What logike I uttered in my Lectures, and how I read, I
refer to their judgments: who surely if they suffered me so long to continue
in that place, augmented the stipende for my sake, and were so desirous to have
me still to remain in that function (reading so unlearnedly, as you would
make the world believe I did) may be thought either to be without judgment
them selves, or else to have bin very careless for that exercise. Well, I will
not speak that which I might justly speak by this provocation of yours: For
I count this either an heathenishe, or a chyldishe kind of confuting, to fall
from the matter, to the deprauing of the person. God grant that we both may
so know our gifts, and our selves, that we may acknowledge them to be his,
and employ them to the edifying of the Church, not to the disgracing one of
another. Scientia inflat. etc.

I did know that this my book should come into the hands both of the
learned and unlearned: and therefore (as near as I could) I did frame my self
to serve them both. And because all, or the most part of your proofs,
consiste of these or the like kind of arguments, I thought it convenient, to
set down a note of them before my book, and that for the learned sake, whereof
I do not repent me, neither do I think that it comes out of place.

But to observe what art here is showed, you would gladly know (you say)
what place of the fallacions either an argument ab authoritate negative is, or
of negatiues by comparison. etc. I marvel that you will so openly dally: I
entitle this treatise, A brief examination of the reasons used in the book.
etc. And afterward I call them arguments, I do not call them fallacions,
(which notwithstanding I might have done in some respect) but seeing you
cavil about words, tell me where I call either an argument ab authoritate
negative, or of negatiues by comparison, fallacions? Do you not blushe to
trifle on this sort, and to seek occasion of cauilling in so small matters? I
am sure that you are not so ignorante in Logike, but that you know there be
many false arguments, which be not amongst the fallacions. What say you to
an argument a specie negative, and such like? What say you to an argument ex
solis negatiuis, or ex solis particularibus? or to that that otherwise does
offend in any mood or figure? or to be short, to such as be in any place of
Logike negative or affirmative, when the nature of the place will not bear it?
For you know that in some places only negative reasons hold, in some other
places only affirmative.

Concerning an argument ab authoritate negative, that it is no good argument
Arg. ab autho ritate negative.
all Logicians confess, neither is he to be thought to have any skill in
Logike at all, that will deny it. Only the authority of the Scripture is to
be excepted in matters pertaining to salvation, or damnation, because therein
it is perfect and absolute: as I have declared in my answer to the Admonition.

Touching the argument of negatiues by comparison, which you think to Arg. of
negatiues by comparison.
be so strange, it is most usual in the Scriptures, and most consonant to
reason. when God said unto Samuel. 1. Reg. 8. They have not refused thee, but
me: He meant not absolutely, that they had not rejected Samuel, but by that one
negative by comparison, he understands two affirmatiues: that is, that they
had rejected Samuel, and not him alone, but chiefly they had rejected God. But
of this kind of argument, look the. 2. book, and 12. chapter of worthy
Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, which he writes of the Sacrament: where he
answering the objections of the Papists out of Chrysostom, touching
transubstantiation, handles this argument at large, and sets it out by many
examples, to the which place I refer the Reader, and you too, that you may
see your lack of discretion, in finding fault where none is. Those be but
slender answers to these arguments, except you quit your self better in the
rest of your Reply, it had bin mnche safer for your cause to have still kept
silence.

Io. Whitgifte.
A brief examination etc.
The third kind of argument is called petitio principij. which is Arg. a
petitione principij.
when a man frames unto him self principles of his own devise, grounded
neither upon authority, neither yet upon substantial reason, and then upon the
same will conclude his purpose: which is vitiosissimum genus argumentandi, a
very erroneous kind of reasoning, as these men do in using these two false
principles: the one, when they say that to be invented by an Antichristian
Pope, which was not so invented: the other, when they say that nothing may be
used in the Church of Christ, which was invented by the Pope, or used in the
Popes Church: which can not be true, as in sundry places of the book I have
declared. The self same reasons moved the Aerians to forsake the order of the
Church, and to command their disciples to do the contrary of that that the
Church did. We borrowe good laws of the Gentiles: and we use the Churches,
Belles, Pulpits, and many other things used of Papists. etc.

The fourth kind of reason is, of negatiues by comparison: as this, Arg. a
negatiuis per come parationem.
Priests and Ministers are to be known by their doctrine, not by their
apparel: Ergo, they ought not to have distinct apparel from other men. This
argument follows not, for negatiues by comparison are not simply to be
understood, but by the way of comparison: And therefore of the former sentence
thus we may conclude, that the apparel is not to be esteemed as a note of
difference in comparison to learning and doctrine, and yet a note. As when
Paul says, that Christ sent him not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, 1.
Cor. 1. And God by his Prophet, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Ose. 6.
and Mat. 9.

The fifte is ab eo quod est non causam, vt causam ponere, when that is taken
for Arg. a non causa pre causa.
the cause of any thing, which is not the cause: As when they condemn the
book of Common prayer, and a prescript form of service, because (as they say)
it maynteineth an unlearned (or as they term it) a reading ministry, when as
the book is not the cause of it, neither yet a prescript form of prayer, but
either the parties them selves that be unlearned, or they that do admit them,
or else both. This kind of argument is usual in the Admonition.

There be other unlearned and unskillful reasons used in this book, which may
easily be discerned, even of children. And therefore I here omit them.

Thus much I thought good generally to write, which being duly considered,
the book it self needs no other kind of co^futation.

Io. Whitgifte.
To all this T. C. answers nothing: but only to that of negatiues by
comparison, whereof I have spoken before.

T. C. Fol. 1. Sect. 1.
And to the end the pithe and weight of M. Doctors arguments may be the better
scene, I will likewise give the reader a say of them, noting the places of the
fallacions, whereunto they be referred. Which I do against my will, and
compelled, for that M. Doctor to discredit the truth would make his reader
believe, that those which think not as he does in these matters, are not
only unlearned, but contemners of good learning. In deed there is no great
learning in these small things, and they are of that sort, which although it
be a great shame not to know, yet it is no great commendation to have
knowledge of them.

Io. Whitgifte.
It had bin plain dealing to have set down M. Doctors arguments in the same
form that he has written them: then might the reader better have judged of
your collections: but you were to wise for that, for then should either your
forgerie have been manifest, or else your book should have bin less by all
this portion. I seek to discredit errors, and contentious doctrine, and not
the truth. Such learning there is, even in those small things, that who so is
ignorant of them, may easily be deceived, both in speaking, writing, and
reasoning.

T. C. Fol. 1. Sect. 2.
In the. 40. page he reasons thus. An untrue collection.
The ministers must learn, therefore they must learn Cathechismes: which is
a fallacion of the consequent. For although he that must learn a Cathechisme,
must learn: yet it follows not that whosoever must learn, must byandby
learn a Cathechisme.

Io. Whitgifte.
My words in that place be these: If they that find some want of learning in
them selves, or that be crepte into the ministry unlearned, ^ither of their
own accord, or by commandment of their ordinary read and learn godly and
learned Cathechismes, they are to be commended, and so is he that provoke
them thereunto.

That Cathechisme which you in derision quote in the margent, is a book fit
for you to learn also: and I know no man so well learned, but it may become
him to read and learn that necessary book. But some arrogant spirits there
be, that think them selves of all men b^st learned, and disdain to learn of
any.

That place of the fourth Chapter of the first to Timothy does not forbid a
man to learn. He that is a good and modest preacher will not disdain as well
to be taught, as to teach.

Now how any man can gather of these words any such argument as T. C.
frames unto him self, let the Reader judge. He might well have thus
concluded: Ministers that find some want of learning in themselves. etc. ought
to read and learn such books, as may better instruct them, Ergo, they may
read and learn godly and learned Cathechismes. And again, M. Nowell his
Cathechisme, is godly and learned: Ergo, godly and learned men may read and
learn it. Last of all, a godly and modest Preacher will not disdain as well to
be taught, as to teach: Ergo, he will be as well content to read other men's
books, although they be Cathechismes, as he will be to have other men to
read his. Now I pray you judge of the sequel of these reasons: and compare
them with T. C. his waywarde collection, and tell me truly whether he deals
simply, or no. It is true, that although a man must learn, it follows not
that he must of necessity learn a Cathechisme, because there be other books,
besides Cathechismes to be learned, whereby a man may be instructed: but this is
also true, that if a man must learn, he may learn Cathechismes. Surely T. C.
is driven to a hard shifte, when he is thus constrained to feyne fallations
where none are.

T. C. page 1. Sect. 3.
In the. 55. page he reasons, that for so much as the civil Magistrate may
appoint some Another forged argument of T. C. his own fram^ng.
kind of apparel, therefore he may appoint any, and so the Popish apparel:
which is ab eo quod est secundum quid, ad id quod est simpliciter, of which
sort he has diverse others. As women may baptize, and preach, because such a
one, and such a one did: And the ministers execute civil government, because
Elias and Samuel did.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words in that page be these: May not therefore christian Magistrates, in
Christian commonweals, for order and decency, appoint a several kind of
apparel, as well to Ministers, as to other states of men? Judges, Sergeants,
Aldermen, and Citizens, are known by their apparel, and why may not the
Ministers be so likewise? are they not under subjection? be they not subject to
civil laws and ordinances? ought they not to obey their governors in all
things not against the word of God? If it had pleased T. C. to have set aparte
dallying, he might have seen, that from the last section of the. 54. page,
unto the fourth section of the. 56. page my drift is to prove that Ministers
may differ from other by their apparel, and that they may have a distinct kind
of garments from lay men, and that the civil Magistrate has authority, for
order and decency to appoint a several kind of apparel to Ministers. Now if
he would have gathered truly, he should have framed his argument thus: Christian
Magistrates have authority in Christian commonweals, for order and dece^cy, to
appoint a s^ueral kind of apparel to Ministers. Ergo* Ministers may differ and
be known from other by their apparel. Whether that the civil Magistrate may
appoint them to wear such apparel as was used in the Popes time or no, that
I handle at large, even from the. 4. section of the. 56. page to the portion of
the Admonition in the 62. If T. C. had marked this mine order, he would not so
confound him self, and delude his Reader, by such untrue collections of my
arguments.

Touching the other examples of baptizing by women, and civil offices in
ecclesiastical persons, because he has not quoted the page (which argues
he knows not where to find them, or that he is loathe the reader by searching
the places, should perceive his corrupt dealing in the gathering) I will
defer answering of them, until I come where they, or any similitude of them
may be found. In the mean time with the first he charge me untruly: and the
second I intend to justify.

T. C. fol. 1. Sect. 4.
In the. 69. page he says, Cyprian (speaking of the office of an Archbishop)
which is a manifest petition of the principle. For it being that which should
have bin It is proved sufficiently in the trea^se of Archbishops.
proved, M. Doctor takes it for granted. And in diverse places, speaking of
the Archbishop, he goes about to deceive his reader with the fallation of the
equivocation, or diverse signification of the word. For whatsoever he finds
said of Archbishop and Bishop in times past, he brings to establishe our
Archbishops and Bishops, when notwithstanding those in times past, were much
different from ours, and are not of that kind, as shall appear afterward.

Io. Whitgifte.
As though Cyprian may not speak of the office of an Archbishop, except he
express his name, or as though the circumstance of the place may not declare,
that he speaks of such an office. But how justly I am here charged with a
manifest petition of a principle, I shall have better occasion to declare, when
I come to answer the manifest cavil which T. C. uses, touching that place of
Cyprian.

How also in diverse places, speaking of the Archbishop, I go about to deceive
my reader with the fallation of equivocation, (which is only said in this place
without any manner of proof, or any one example) shall likewise appear, when I
come to answer the reply touching that matter, where it will evidently fall
out, that T. C. is greatly deceived, in that he supposes the Archbishops and
Bishops in times past, so much to differ from ours, especially if he mean the
difference to be in authority and office.

T. C. fol. 1. Sect. 5.
In the. 239. page he reasons, that for so much as those which wear the
apparel, do edify, Another untrue collection.
therefore they edify by reason of the apparel, which is to make that the
cause, which is not, but only comes with the cause.

Io. Whitgifte.
You deal in this as you have done in the rest, that is corruptly: for the
second reason which I there use, to prove that the apparel does edify, is
this: That such as have worn the apparel, and do wear it, by the ministry
of the word, have greatly edified, and do daily. In the which argument I make
not the apparel the efficient or substantial cause of edifying, but an
accidental cause. For you know that it is an order and law in the Church of
England, that none should either administer the Sacraments, or preach,
except he receive the apparel appointed: forasmuch therefore as he that
refuses to wear the apparel by order of this Church, may not preach, and
therefore can not that way edify, and he that wears that apparel may
preach, and so edify, therefore the apparel per accidens does edify, even as
the Church, the Pulpit, and such other things do, which edify not per se,
of themselves, but per accidens, accidentally, as all other accidental
ceremonies do.

T. C. page 1. Sect. 6.
In the. 240. page. he reasons thus, that the surplice. etc. be notes, and
notes of good ministers, therefore they be good notes of ministers, which is a
fallation of composition, when a man thinks that whatsoever is said of a
thing by it self, may be said of it when it is joined with another.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Admonition says, that cappe, gown, tippet. etc. have the show of evil,
seeing the Popish priesthood is evil. To the which I answering, say on this
sort: When they were a sign and token of the Popish priesthood, then they
were evil, even as the thing was which they signified, but now they be signs
and tokens of the ministers of the word of God, which are good, and therefore
also they be good. What can you say to this manner of speaking? is it not true
to say that they were signs of evil, when the things that they signified were
evil, and now they be signs of good, seeing the things they signify be
good? and as they were evil signs, when they signified evil things, so they
be now good signs, because they signify good things. Do we not commonly
call the signs and notes good or evil; even as the things signified be good
or evil? None is so ignorant that knows not this: and therefore my reason is
good, but your collection is like it self. I have used no other manner of
reasoning or speaking in this place, than M. Bucer does in the same matter,
Fol. 59. and. 60. And therefore this is rather spoken against him, than against
me.

T. C. page 1. Sect. 7.
In the. 149. page he reasons thus: Those which authorized the book of
Common prayer, were studious of peace, and buylding the Church, therefore
those which find fault with it, are pullers down of the Church, and
disturbers of the peace, which is a fallation of the Accident, when a man
thinks that every thing which is verified of the subject, may be likewise
verified of that which is annexed unto it. The further confutation of the which
arguments I refer unto their places.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Admonition says, that those persons, in which and by whom the book of
Common prayer was first authorized, were studious of peace, and of buylding up
of Christ's Church. Whereupon I conclude, that if that be true, then the
defacers of that book be disturbers of the peace. Which I gather of that that
they the^ selves have granted, and as I am persuaded truly: neither do I
understand how it can be made a fallation ab accidente. For I think that the
meaning of the authors of the Admonition is, that these men showed them selves
desirous of peace, and of buylding up the Church, even in collecting and
authorizing that book (or else to what purpose should they make any mention
of them) which if it be true, as it is, then the argument must of necessity
follow.

T. C. page 1. Sect. 8.
There be diverse other which he has, which are so far from just
conclusions, as they have not so much as any color of likelyhoode of
argument, which I can not tell where to lodge, unless I put them in the
common inn, which is that, which is called the ignorance of the Elench. As in
the. 68. page, when he concludes thus, An untruth, for there is no such
aagument*
that Cyprian speaks not of the Bishop of Rome, Ergo he speaks of an
Archbishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
I might here justly quarrel with you for leaping so disorderly, sometimes
forward and sometimes backwarde, as from the. 240. page to the. 149. and from
that to the 68. etc. But I let al such things pass, and come to the matter. In
the. 68. page as you quote it, but in deed the. 69. after I have declared the
true meaning of Cyprian, I add, that Cyprian there speaks not of the usurped
authority of the Bishop of Rome over all Churches, but against the insolency
of some, which despising their Metropolitan or Archbishop, did with their
factiousnesse trouble the Church. Which words I added, to declare how untruly
the Papists do abuse that place of Cyprian, to prove the Popes authority
over all the Churches, when he only speaks of the authority of an
Archbishop or Bishop in his own province or dioces. True it is that Cyprian
does not speak of the authority of the Bishop of Rome over all Churches, but
of the authority that Cornelius then Bishop of Rome, or Cyprian himself had
in his own province: neither will any deny this but Papists. Now to pervert
this my plain meaning, and to father on me whether I will or no, this
argument, he speaks not of the Bishop of Rome, and therefore of an
Archbishop, argues a mind disposed to con^, and a stomach desirous rather to
deface the person, than to give care to the matter.

T. C. page 1. Sect. 9.
And in the. 71. page Other untruth*
There must be superiors, Ergo, one minister must be superior unto an other.
There must be degrees, therefore there must be one Archbishop over a province.

Io. Whitgifte.
There are no such reasons, those that be in that place alleged, are only out
of Hierome and Chrysostom, and of greater force than will be truly answered.

T. C. page 1. Sect. 10.
And in the. 73. there was one over every congregation, therefore there was one
over all the ministers Another untruth
in the province. These and a number like unto these, M. Doctor has scattered
throughout his book, which as Nero said of his master Senecas works, cleave
together like sand: and thus let it be seen, whose arguments are most justly
concluded, those of the Admonition or these of M. Doctors.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is a shame to lie of the devil. Where find you in all that page any such
argument or similitude of it? but surely you have done me a great pleasure, who
searching my book so diligently for arguments to quit the Admonition, have not
found one, but most vainly and untruly fained those to be which be not.
Truly, I do not think my self in every circumstance to be so circumspecte, but
that I may minister sometime matter to a quarreller, howebeit, as yet you have
not found any thing for your purpose. And I shall most heartily desire the
reader, to judge of the rest of your doyngs, even according to these beginnings.

An Exhortation to such as be in authority and have the government of the
Church committed unto them, whether they be Civil or Ecclesiastical
Magistrates.
Io. Whitgifte.
COnsidering the strangeness of the time, the variety of men's minds, and the
marvelous inclinations in the common sort of persons (especially where the
Gospel is most preached) to embrace new invented doctrines and opinions,
though they tend to the disturbing of the quiet state of the Church, the
discrediting and defacing of such as be in authority, and the mainteining of
licenciousnesse and lewd liberty: I thought it good to set before your eyes
the practices of the Anabaptists, their conditions and qualities, the kind
and manner of their beginnings and proceedings, before the broching of their
manifold and horrible heresies, to the intent that you understanding the same,
may the rather in time take heed to such as proceed in like manner: least they
being suffered too long, brust out to work the same effect. I accuse none,
only I suspect the authors of this Admonition, and their fautours: what cause
I have so to do, I refer to your selves to judge, after that I have set forth
unto you the Anabaptisticall practices, even as I have learned in the writings
of such famous and learned men, as had themselves experience of them, when
they first began in Germany, and did both personally reason with them, and
afterward very learnedly write against them: neither will I in this point
write one word, which I have not my author to show for.

An answer to the Exhortation to the civil Magistrates.
T. C. page 2. Sect. 1.
IT is more than I thought could have happened unto you, once to admit into
your mind, this opinion of Anabaptisme, of your brethren, which have always
had it in as great detestation as your self, preached against it, as much as
your self, hated of the folowers and favorers of it, as much as your self.
And it is yet more strange, that you have not doubted to give out such
slanderous reports of them, but dare to present such accusations to the holy
and sacred seat of justice, and thereby (so much as in you lies) to corrupt
it, and to call for the sword upon the innocent, (which Big words.
is given for their maintenance and safety) that, as it is a boldness
intolerable, so could I hardly have thought, that it could have fallen into
any, that had carried but the countenance and name of a professor of the
Gospel, much less of a Doctor of divinity. Before you will join with us in
this cause, you will place us whether we will or no, in the camp of the
Anabaptists, to the end you might thereby, both withdraw al from aiding us,
which are godly minded, as for that you fearing (as it seems) the
insufficiency of your pen, might have the sword, to supply your want other
ways. And if we be found in their camp, or be such disturbers of the quiet
estate of the Church, ^efacers of such as be in authority, mainteyners of
licenciousnes and lewd liberty (as you do seem to charge us with) we refuse
not to go under those punishments, that some of that wicked sect received, for
just recompense of their demerites. You say you will not accuse any, A
charitable judgment, and yet before he reproved the l^ke.
I know it is for want of no good will, that you do not accuse them, of whose
condemnation and extreme punishment, we might be sure, if your hand were as
strong as your heart. But you suspect the authors of the Admonition, and their
fautors. (*) Charity is not suspicious. Let us therefore see, whether there be
just 1. Cor. 13. 5.
matter to bear out, and to uphold this suspicion. You will bear men in hand,
that if we be not already full Anabaptists, yet we are in the way thither, the
fotesteps whereby you trace us, must be considered.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no cause why you should so marvel at the matter, all things well
considered, neither do I think that the Anabaptists do so greatly detest and
hate them, as you would make us believe. I do not accuse them of the doctrine
of Anabaptisme (as you your self in the end of this section do acknowledge)
but I declare that I greatly suspect them, because they come so near unto the
qualities and practices of the Anabaptists, and use the same beginnings:
whether this my suspicion be true or no I refer it to the judgment of
others. If the reports be slanderous, let them take their lawful remedy
against me: but if they be most manifest, then it is convenient that the
Magistrates have understanding thereof. Your great words do not answer the
matter. I fear not the insufficiency of my pen (I thank God) neither is
there any cause why I should: for the truth has always a plentiful defense,
whereas error and schism is compelled to use arrogant, opprobrious, and
contemptuous speeches to maintain it self.

Of all other T. C. has least cause to complain of such extremity, or to
speak in this manner. I have much more cause to accuse his undutiful and
unthankful nature. If Charity be not suspicious, why do you then thus not
suspecte, but directly give sentence, that it is not for want of good will,
that I do not accuse them of Anabaptisme? (...) it not lawful for me to
suspect, and is it lawful for you to condemn? You took upon you to reprove
me before for judging, and can you fall so sone into it your self, (...) deed
charity is not suspicious without just and lawful causes: but whether the
causes be just or no, let those judge to whom it does especially appertain.

Io. Whitgifte.
The first article. page 2. Sect. 1.
First Anabaptisme tends to this end, that (in those places where ^
the Gospel has bin for a time preached, and where Churches be reformed) the
Gospel may be hindered, the Churches disquieted, the simple brought to doubt
of the Religion that has been taught them: contentious and unquiet minds may
have matter to work on, the preaching of the Gospel become odious: finally
that Magistrates and such as be in authority, may be contemned, and despised
of their subjects and inferiors.

T. C. page 2. Sect. 2.
It is all true you here allege of the Anabaptists: God be praised there is
nothing of it true in us. If through these questions moved, the Church be
disquieted, the disquietnesse rises in that the truth and sincerity which is
offered, is not received. We seek it in no tumultuous manner, but by humble
suit unto them, to whom the redress of things pertayne, and by teaching as our
callings will suffer. If all those are to be counted in the way to Anabaptisme,
which move controversies when the Gospel is preached: The ca^ is (...) thing
like.
Then those that taught that the Gentiles wear to be preached unto, when as
the most of the believing Jews (which likewise preached the Gospel) thought
otherwise, are to be counted in the way of Anabaptisme. Likewise, those that
preached that circumcision was not necessary unto salvation, when as a great
number of Christians at the first thought it necessary. Then Master Zumglius,
and Decolampadius smelt of Anabaptisme, which went about to overthrow diverse
things, which Master Luther held. I could go further with this, but I
content my self with these examples. If any be brought in doubt, or hatred of
the truth hereby, or any man take occasion to be contentious, it is not in the
nature of the doctrine which is taught, but in the corruption of their minds,
nor it is not offense given, but taken: nor this doctrine can be no more
charged, than the rest of the Gospel, which is a (*) sword that cutteth a
City or kingdom in sunder, and sets a (*) fire where Mat. 10. 34.
there was none, and puts contention between the father and the son. But
what is to give an Luc. 12. 49.
incurable offense unto the simple, and matter to the enemy to rejoice in, to
all good Christians of tears and weeping, if this be not, to make the world
think, that numbers of those which profess the Gospel, are infected with the
poison of Anabaptisme, which can not be touched with the smalest point of it?
As for the Magistrate, and authority, we acknowledge the lawfulness,
necessity, A good (...) vnfayne^.
and singular commodity of it, we commend it in our sermons to others, we
pray for them, as for those, of whose good or evil estate, hangs the
flourishing or decay of the common wealth, and Church both. We love them as our
Fathers and Mothers, we fear them, as our Lords and Masters, and we obey
them in the Lord, and for the Lord. If there be any thing, wherein we do not
according to that which is commanded, it is, because we can not be persuaded
in our consciences, that we may so do (whereof we are ready to render a
reason out of the word of God) and if that will not serve, forthwith to
submit our selves, to that punishment, that shall be awarded against us. And
herein, we first call the Lord God to witness of our meaning, and then we
refer our selves to the consciences of all men in the sight of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nothing is here said of you in the defense of the authors of the Admonition,
but the Anabaptists will say the same in theirs: Let the like effects
proceeding from the like causes, and in like manner judge the likelyhoode
betwixt the Anabaptists and them. One of the chief notes that are given of
Anabaptists by Zuinglius in his Zuinglius
book called Ecclesiastes, and in his other books where he speaks of them,
is, that they sow discord and contention in those Churches where the Gospel
has been truly preached, and that about external matters, as it may more at
large appear in the second edition of my answer to the Admonition, And tell
me I pray you what Church has any of them settled themselves in, but in such,
wherein the Gospel has been well The admonitors justly accused of contention.
planted before? or in what place have they for any time remained, where they
have not with contention and factions troubled not that place only, but the
whole country round about in like manner? Surely if they preached doctrine
necessary to salvation (that is the Gospel) and in those places wherein the
Gospel is not received, then if contentions should arise, the cause were not
to be ascribed unto them, but unto their hearers only: but seeing they ran not
teach the Gospel more sincerely than it is taught, and seeing the matters they
contend for, be not of such necessity, that the Churches should for them be
disquieted, seeing also that they seek reformation (as they call it) neither in
due time, due place, nor before meet persons: And finally, seeing contentions
are raised by them in those places where the Gospel is received, I see not
how they can avoid the just accusation of contentieus persons, and disturbers
of the peace of the Church. For if you ask of the time: the Admonition was
published after the Parliament (to the which it was dedicated) was ended. If

speak of the place: it was not exhibited in Parliament (as it ought to have
been) but spread abroad in corners, and sent into the Country. If you inquire
of the persons: it came first to their hands who had least to do in
reforming. Likewise your sermons of these matters: when preach you them?
surely even in this troublesome Their disorder in preaching.
and tumultuous time, when there is especial occasion to move men to prayer,
to unity, and to the embracing of the substance of Religion, which by all
means is sought to be overthrown. Where preach you them? even where they do
least good and most harm: in places where the Gospel has been already
planted, yea and often times in secret conuenticles and corners, which the
truth never seeks, but upon extreme necessity: and before whom preach you?
not before such as have authority to redress, but before the common people,
who (although some of them be godly and sober) yet for the most part be
greatly delighted with novelties, love such scholemaisters as teach liberty,
and continually inueigh against superiors. All this being true, as you can not
deny it to be true, there is no cause why you should be offended with the
setting down of the first article.

To preach the Gospel is a thing necessary unto salvation: to preach that
circumcision and such like ceremonies be not matters of salvation, is a
necessary doctrine, and of the substance of Religion. Zuinglius and
Oecolampadius and other differed from Luther in some matters of substance, and
yet did they orderly and lawfully with the consent of their Magistrates proceed
in these matters: wherefore these examples help you nothing: for the matters
you contend for, be not of ye same nature, neither do you proceed in like
manner. The same answer may be made to all other like examples, that you can
use in these matters. But because I will not lean only to mine own judgment
in this case, let it not grieve you if I set down M. Zuinglius opinion
touching the same, who in his book called Ecclesiastes, speaking against the
Anabaptists says on this sort, If they were sent of God, and endued with the
spirit of God, they would have Zuingl. in ecclesi.
construed in the best part these external things, which be not as yet
rightly reformed, they would have become all things to all men, that they
might have won all to Christ. etc. M. Calvin also in his book against ye
Anabaptists says, that when under the color of a Calvin aduersus Anabap.
zeal of perfection, we ca^ bear no imperfection, either in the body, or in
the members of the Church, it is the devil which puffs us up with pride, and
seduceth us with hypocrisy to make us forsake Christ's flock.

Whatsoever you allege for the saluing of your contentious doctrine out of ye.
10. of T. C. uses the same defense for his contention, that the Anabaptists do.
Matthew verse. 34. ye same do ye Anabaptists use for their excuse also, as
Zuinglius testifies in his Ecclesiastes, his words be these. Their doctrine
brings forth nothing but contention and tumults, in the defense whereof they
allege that Christ said, I came not to send peace but the sword: to who^ we
answer, that this sword has no place among the faithful: Zuing. in ec.
for it divides the faithful from infidels: but they make contention and
brawling among the The sword which Christ sends is not between the faithful.
faithful, and that for external things. Hitherto Zuinglius: which is a
sufficient answer to you also using ye same excuse, and moving co^tentio^s in
like manner and matters. The same sense have the words of Christ. Luc. 12. ver.
49. for the Gospel is a sword that deuideth the faithful from infidels, but
not the faithful among themselves.

It is the greatest offense to the simple, and most worthy of Christian tears
and weeping, that men should cloak and color their arrogancy, contention,
and errors, with a false pretense of godly zeal for the purytie of faith, the
sincerity of the Gospel, and the reformation Bucer in. 4. Ephesians.

What you think and teach of the authority of the civil Magistrate will
appear hereafter more plainly in some other parts of your book, your
additions to your protestation of allowing Magistrates, and of your obedience
to them, may color your abridging of their authority: For if they command
you any thing wherein you intend not to obey, you may say, they commanded not
that in the Lord, and that it is against your conscience: These exceptio^s or
excuses be very general, and may with you (who in all things pretend the word
of God, and conscience) strayghten the authority of the Magistrate to your
own purpose. But hereof we shall something more plainly (although not fully)
understand your opinion hereafter. The same Protestation that you make, it may
appear that the Anabaptists made also in the beginning, as Zuinglius
declares in his Ecclesiastes.

by the people: that they preached not the Gospel truly, that they were Scribes
and Pharisees: that they had not those things which Paul required in a
minister. 1. Tim. 3. That they did not themselves those things, which they
taught unto other: that they had stipends, and labored not, and therefore
were ministers of the belly, that they could not teach truly, because they had
great livings, and lived wealthily and pleasantly, that they used not their
authority in excommunication, that they attributed to much unto the
Magistrate.

T. C. page 3. and. 4.
There was never Heretic so abominable, but that he had some truth to cloak
his falshode, should his untruths and blasphemies, drive us from the
possession of that, which he holds truly? no not the Devil him self,
saying, that God had given his Angels charge over his, can thereby wring this
sentence from us, why we should not both believe it, and speak it, being a
necessary truth to believe and speak. You may as well say, we are
Anabaptists, because we say, there is but one God, as they did, one Christ as
they did. etc. And here I will give the Reader a taste of your Logike, that
you make so much of in your book. This is your own Logike, and these be
arguments of your own framing.
The Anabaptists say that the Churches should choose their ministers, and not
the Magistrate, and you say so, therefore you are Anabaptists, or in the way to
Anabaptisme. The Anabaptists complained, that the Christians used not their
authority in excommunication, and so do you complain, therefore you are
Anabaptists, or in the way to them. I will not lay to your charge, that you
have not learned Aristotle's Priorums, which says, it is (...) as often as the
mean in any syllogism, is consequent to both the extremes. But have you not
learned that which Seton, or any other halfepeny Logyke tells you, that you
can not conclude affirmatively in the second figure? And of this sort are
every one of your surmises contained in this treatise, which you entitle, an
exhortation. etc. And if I lyked, to make a long book of little matter (as you
do) I would thus gather your arguments out of every branch which you
ascribe, as common unto us with the Anabaptists, as you make ado, upon every
place, which is quoted by the Admonition to the Parliament. But answer, I
pray you, in good faith are you of that judgment, that the civil Magistrate
should ordain ministers? No: but that may be the true church of Christ wherein
there is no excommunication: the contrary whereof the Anabaptist^ affirm.
Or that there should be no excommunication, as it was, and is used in certain
the Heluetian Churches? If you be, your controversy is not so much with us,
as with the Bishops, which both call ministers, and excommunicate. If you be
not, why is that Anabaptisticall in us, which is Christian and Catholic in
you? And why do you go about, to bring us in hatred for those things, which you
do no more allow, than those who^ you thus endeavor to discredit? we do not
say that there is no lawful, or no ordinary calling in England, for we do
not deny, but that he may be lawfully called, which is not ordinarily, as M.
Luther, Melancthon, Zuinglius, Decolampadius. And there be By what a^ those

places in England, where the ministers be called by their parishes in such
sort, What scriptures, or where* will you not quote one*
as the examples of the scripture do show to have been done, before the
eldership and government of the Church be established. I know not any, that
says, that the Gospel is not truly preached in England, and by those also
that are not of the same judgment, that the Admonition to the Parliament is
of. But if it be said, that it is not generally of cuery one of them, and in
all points, or not so often, or not there where their duty byndeth them, and
they are called unto, or not so sincerely, or without mixture, as it ought to
be, then there is nothing said, but that, which we fear, may be too easily
proved. It it be said of some, that in certain there are found some of those
things, that were reprehended in the Phariseis, what is that to prove, that
they be Anabaptists that speak of it. Your self in one place of your book,
call the authors of the Admonition, and their favorers, Phariseis, who do all
things to be seen of men, and therefore they sighe, and hold down their
heads. etc. And this you speak, against them that preach the Gospel.
Therefore by your reason you give sentence of Anabaptisine against your self.
You promised you would not write one word, whereof you had not your author
for it. First you have This is untrue
perverted the meaning of the Anabaptists, in that wherein they acculed the
godly Ministers, that they were not according to that which is written in the
third of the. 1. Epist. to Timothe, and all because you would multiply the
number of your likelyhoodes. For they charged the Ministers, by that place, of
dissolutdnesse and losenesse of life, and corruption of manners, and we
allcadge it to prove that they should be able to teach and instruct, against
the dumb Ministry that is abroad. But that which follows, utters not
only great Is it be not ^o, what may be (...) of you*
untruth and falsification of the author, but shows a mind desirous to
slander, and sorry (as it seems) that those which you so grievously
discredit, are no lyker the Anabaptists, than they be. I will set down the
words, as they are written in the. 102. leaf, that it may appear how
faithfully you have dealte. Libere enim dicunt concionatores qui sripendium
accipiunt, non esse veros Deiministros, neque posse docere ueritatem, sed esse
uentris ministros, qui o^iose accipiant ingentia stipendia, ex illis rebus,
quae simulachris immolatae fuerunt, and ex diuitijs splendide and luxuriose
uiuant, cum tamen Christus dixit, gratis accepistis, gratis date, and prohibuit
duas tunicas, peram and pecuniam habere, preterea Paulum aiunt manibus suis
laborasse, and mandasse reliquis, ut idem faciant, itaque concludunt nulla
debere stipendia habere sui officii, sed laborare and gratis ministrare, and
quia hoc non faciunt, non posse ipsos ueritatem docere. They say What other
thing is assirmed in the second articles
freely (speaking of the Anabaptists) that the preachers which take stipendes,
can not be the true ministers of God, nor teach the truth, but are ministers
of the belly, which to live idly take great stipendes, of those things which
were offered to images, and do of their riches live gorgeously, and riotousely,
when notwithstanding Christ said, ye have received freely, give freely, and
forbad the^ to have two coats, or a scrippe, or money. Besides that, they say
that Paul labored with his own hands, and gave commandment, to the rest
of the Ministers, that they should do so, and therefore they conclude, that
they should have no stipende for their office, but labor and minister for
naught, and because they do not so, they cannot teach the truth. Now let all
men judge, whether it be one thing, to say, that they ought not to have
stipendes, that labor not, or to say as the Anabaptists said, that it was
not lawful to have any stipende, or to say, they could not teach truly,
because they had great livings, or because they had any livings at all.
Although I never read nor heard any of those that you mean, say, that those
which had great stipendes and livings could not preach truly. It may be that
diverse have said that it were meet, the ministers should be content, with
competent stipendes, and that the overplus of that might go to the supply of
the wants of other ministers livings, and to the maintenance of the poor, or
of the university, and that that excess, is the cause of diverse disorders in
those persons, that have it, but that they could not preach truly (when they
preached) which had great livings, I for my part never heard it. I think you
would not be exempted from reprehension of that, wherein you fault, and
therefore I know not what you mean by these words (that they did not those
things themselves which they taught others) we profess no such perfection in
our lives, but that we are oftentimes behind a great dealein doing of that
which is taught to be our duties to do, and therefore think it necessary
that we should be reprehended, and showed our faults. Whereas you say that the
Anabaptists accused the ministers, for giving to much to the Magistrates, I
have showed what we give, and if it be to little, show us and we will amend
our fault. I assure you it greeueth me, and I am even in the beginning weary,
of turning up this Note his mo^est ^ manerly speeches.
dung, and refuting so baine and frivolous sclanders, with out all show and
face of truth, and therefore I will be brief in the rest.

Io. Whitgifte.
I speak not here of the doctrine of the Anabaptists which is the certain
note whereby they may be known: but of their other qualities and manner of
talk and Preaching. The words be M. Bullingers, they be not mine. The
arguments framed, be yours, and neither his nor mine.

Your disciples magnify you, because your usual talk both public and
private, is They seek not the reformation but the diffamation of ministers.
against the Ministers of the Church, against their calling, against their
preaching, against their life. etc. which you do not to reform them (for you
do it in their absence and to the people) but to deface them, and to
discredit them: not to promote the Gospel (which they preach as diligently
and syncerely as you do) but to bring them into hatred with the people,
whereby you might the rather prevail in your enterprises: not to reform their
manners (for they may compare with you in all kind of honesty and duty) but
to erpresse your malice and wrath: for that which Zuinglius (...) Anabap.
in Elench. contra Anabap. speaks of them, (It is melancholy and wrath, not
true zeal of which they glory) may be truly verified of you, and thereof
let this your book be judge.

Now if I say, that in this point you agree with the Anabaptists, I do not
therefore straighteway conclude that you are Anabaptists: but this I conclude,
that you are not for such inuemues to be esteemed as more pure in deed than
your brethren, nor they thorough such slaunde^os speeches of yours to be
discredited: because herein you speak or practice nothing against the true
Ministers of the word of God, but that which the Anabaptists have done in
the self same form and manner before you. And that these be qualities
worthy to be observed in the Anabaptists, and such as proceed in like
manner, it may appear not only by this observation of M. Buliinger, but: of
other learned and Godly men also, that have written against them, and given
notes of their qualities. Zuinglius in his Book before named says, That they
speak evil both Ibidem Why the (...) speak evil of magistrate^ and (...)
Idem in ^les
of the Civil Magistrate, and of the ministers of the Church, that if at any
time either of them according to their office, reprove them, then they
streyghtwaye say that therefore they be enimyes unto them, because they tell
them of their faults: And in his Ecclesiast. he says thus of them ^. They so
slander, reuyle, and backebyte the Ministers of the word, and of the
Church, that they ought to be suspected and hated of all Godly men: even
for their slanderous and curssed speaking. But their end and purpose is, by
this means to win credit unto them selves, and to discredit such as set
them selves against them, and detecte their erroures. The like saying he has
in his book De. Baptismo. To the same effect also speaks Gastius of them in
his Book De exordio and erroribus Catabap. Gastiu^.
where among other sentences he has this: Their talk utters nothing else
but reprehension of the Ministers of the word, and liberty in external
things. Now judge I pray you, whether this has been a quality worthy to be
observed in the Anabaptists or no?

I do not speak against such as modestly and according to the rule of the
Apostle. 1. Tunoth. 5. do reprove any, but against those that have nothing
else in their mouths, but inuectiues against the Ministers of the word,
obseruyng neither place, time, nor any other circumstances, whom I still say
in this point to be fitly compared to the Anabaptists.

Now whether it be my Logike, or yours that you give a taste of in this
placelette the learned Reader judge, to whom also I commit the trial of
this spyrite of yours, which bursteth out in such unseemly manner, upon the
consyderation of your own devised arguments, to feed your contempt and
disdain with. In deed if you make arguments where I make none, and if you
frame them as it pleases you, no marvel it is though you make a long book,
and cause your Reader to believe, that my Logic is as simple as you would
have it. But deal with me uprightly and honestly, and then set down my
unskillfulness, and spare not, as I trust you would do to the uttermost in
every point, if you could, seeing that you do it where there is no occasion at
all offered unto you by me, but imagined of your self. Well, let these
quarelles go, more meet to be among boys than among men. Gratia Dei sum quod
sum, neither have I any thing but that which I have received of him from whom
comes all good things.

Both of the election of ministers, and of excommunication what I think, I
will declare God willing in their proper places. The words here by me
alleged (as I have said) are Master Bullingers, and they be truly spoken, and
to good purpose as there it shall appear. In the mean while I refer you for
that of the Magistrate in electing of ministers, to the 87. and 88. leaves of
that his Book Aduersus Anabap. and for that of excommunication to the. 233.
and. 234. leaf of the same Book.

You deny, that you say, there is no lawful or no ordinarye calling of
Mynisters in England, which is a strange hearing to me: for whereunto then
tends all that which is written in your Book touching the electing and
calling of Ministers? or F^st Admonition contrary to T. C.
that which is written in the first Admonition Folio. 9* where they say in
plain terms, that we have neither a right Ministry of God, nor a right
government of his Church. And Folio. 34. 35. 36. etc Folio 157. where they
say, that this prescripte form of Service used in this Church of England
mayntayneth an unlawful* Ministry: or that which is so bytterly spoken
against the Book of orderyng* Ministers and Deacons, which they call the
Pontifical? But you say that he may be lawfully called, which is not
ordinarilye. I would have you to speak plainly. Is our calling to the
Ministry here in England lawful, but not ordinary? If it be lawful, then is
it not against the word of God, neither is there any Law in the Scriptures
to the contrary, as you would make us to believe. But truly. I think that
you were not here well aduysed, or else have you some subtle meaning, for you
add immediately, that there be places in England where the Ministers are
called by their Parishes. etc. So that I suppose you mean, that in some
Parishes of England, there is a lawful calling of Ministers: if it be so,
then is it not withstanding truly said, that you deny the manner of calling
Ministers in this Church of England to be lawful: for that manner of calling
is not to be ascribed to this Church, which is used in some conuenticles and
secret congregations, but that which is allowed by public and common
authority.

Your distinction of lawful and ordinary is not simply good, for whatsoever
is lawful Lauful is ordinary in a Church established.
in a Church established, that is ordinary: I think that even very common
reason does teach this to be true. Wherefore certainly if our ministry be
lawful, it is ordinary. If any Parish in England do elect or call their
ministers otherwise than the orders and Laws of this Church does permit, I
can not see how that Parish can excuse it self of schism, and I think
verilye, that such Parishes ought to be looked too in time.

I do not well understand* what you mean by these words, in such sort as
the examples of the Scripture do show to have been done, before the
Eldership and gouernmente of the Church be established. What examples be
these? you quote no places where to find them* Or when was the gouernmente of
the Church and Eldershyp established? If you had more plainly expressed these
two things, we might have the better understood your meaning. But belyke
these Parishes do not call their Ministers in all points according to the
rule that you would have prescribed, and therefore you make an Interim of it,
until your government be fully finished. This is your dealyng to allow of all
things done out of order: yea though it be against your own order, so that
it tend to the derogation of public and common order.

Whether they say, that the Gospel is not truly preached in this Church of
England The Admomtors deny the Gospel to be truly preached in England.
or no, look in the whole discourse of their book: and in the second
Admonition page. 6. where you may find these words, I say that we are so
scarce come to the outward face of a Church ryghtely reformed, that although
some truth be taught by some preachers, yet no preacher may without great
danger of the Laws, utter all truth comprised in the book of God, it is so
circumscribed and wrapte within the compass of such statutes, such
penalties, such imunctions, such Aduertisementes, such Articles, such sober
Caueats, Second Admonition page 6.
and such manyfolde pamphlets, that in manner it does but peep out from
behynd the screene. What say you to these words? how can you salve them?

Whether they generally call all the Ministers of the Gospel which be not on
their sect Phariseys or no, let the whole discourse of both the Admonitions
judge, and that Pamphlet entitled, An exhortation to the Bishops to deal
brotherlye with their brethren: In my answer to which pa^phlet, I prove that
this name Pharisey does much more aptely agree unto the Authors thereof, and
such like, than to the Bishops and other ministers, whom they so often call
by that name, and so odiously compare them together in that pamphlet.

I must once tell you again, that I make no arguments here, I do but only
compare their qualities and conditions: I have performed my promise, if I (...)
not, show me wherein. I pervert not the meaning of the Anabaptists* but set
down the very words of M. Bullinger word for word, without any addition,
^tion, or alteration: it had been well if you had examined the places better.

Touching the falsification, and untruth you charge me with, I think you be
not in good earnest, it is but because you could no longer temper your heat:
for you make many of these outcryes, but I suppose you use them only as means
to cast up your melancholy, which you call zeal. Whatsoever I there speak
of the Anabaptists, I fyndeit in the same form of words in those leaves of
M Bullingers book, which I have quoted in the Margent. Pervse with a little
more diligence Fol. 18. where he has these words: Quod stipendia babeant, and
non laborent, atque ideo ventris ministri sunt, and the. 102. And if you find
not there word for word all this that I have here spoken, touching the
stipendes and livings of ministers, and in the same form of words, then use
your hot Rhetorike: but I know they (...) Idem (...).
be there, and you reprove you can not tell what. If this so greatly trouble
you, I will tell you what Zuinglius also says of this matter in his Ecclesi
istes, where he speaking of Anabaptists says thus: They teach that such can
not preach the Gospel syncerely, which have benefices, but their hope is to
have the true Pastors expelled, that they may succeed in their places, and yet
they publicly protest that they seek for no living. Now whether you or your
men agree with them in this point or no, I neither Zuingl. in Eccles.
deny nor affirm: if you be prickte, I can not blame you though you kick.
Neither do I say, that those ought to have stipends which labor not, I do but
report Bullingers words of the Anabaptists, I would have no man exempted
from due reprehension: I only report this to show the malicious spirits of
the Anabaptists against the ministers of the word, that it may be known of
what society they may be suspected to be, whose talk is wholly bente
against the Ministers of the word of God.

That you give too little to Magistrates it shall be showed in place.

Though you be weary, it is no marvel, for it greeueth you to be touched
so narrowly: And surely if you use no cleanlyer terms than you do in this
place, or continue in pouring out your choler in such abundance, you will
tire me also, or ever I make an end.

Whatsoever I have here spoken of the Anabaptists is most true, and therefore
no slander.

Thirdly, the whole reformation that was then in the Church displeased them,
as not spiritual enough and perfect. For the Sacraments Bull. fo. 9. 18*
were not (as they said) syncerely ministered, things were not reduced to the
Apostolic Church, excommunication not rightly used, no amendment of life
appeared since the preaching of the Gospel: therefore the Church then reformed
no more the true Church of Christ, than was the Papisticall Church.

If you do note these things (which we say not) we will rather do them with
the Anabaptists, than leave them undone with you. Of our simple heart and
meaning in them, we have before Psalm. 37. ver. 6.
protested. In the mean season, we will patiently abide, until the Lord bring
our *righteousness in this behalf unto light, and our just dealing as the
noone day. Touching our sighing and seldom or never laughyng, you give
occasion after to speak of it, unto the which place, I reserve the answer.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do not write this of them because I would have men absteyne from reproving
vice, and exhorting to godliness, but to let it be understood, that these
be no certain proofs of the verity of the doctrine, being commonly used in

If they were at any time punished for their errors, they greatly Bull. fol. 11.
complained that nothing was used but violence, that the truth was oppressed,
that innocent and godly men which would have al things reformed according to
the word of God, could not be heard, nor have liberty to speak. That Zuinglius
stopped their mouths, and defended his cause, not by the word of God, but by ye
authority of the magistrate.

We are no Stoikes, that we should not be touched with the feeling of our
greefes, if our complaints be excessive, show them and we will abridge them.
what errors we defend, and how you maynteyne your part by the word of God, it
will appear in the discourse of your Book.

Io. Whitgifte.
And yet your complaint in this point, as it is without just cause, so is it
common to you with the Anabaptists, and therefore no true note of the verity
of your doctrine, nor any sufficient cause why you should therefore be more
gracious unto the people. The cheifest thing that the common sort have to say
in your defense is, that you be persecuted, put from your livings etc. Which if
it were altogether true, as it is reported, yet your complaint is no other,
than the Anabaptists is, and therefore no more to be alleged for the
justifying of you, than the like is for the justifying of them.

They found great fault with the baptising of children, and ceremonies Bu. Fo.

T. C. Page. 5. Sect. 6.
Their finding fault without cause in the ceremonies of baptism, cannot bar
us from finding fault where there is cause. We allow of the baptism of
children and hope through the goodness Mark the (...)*
of God, that it shall be far from us, ever to condemn it. But to let your
slanderous tongue go (all the strings whereof ye seem to have losed, that it
may the more freely be thrown ont, ano walk against the innocent) where,
where is the modesty you require in other, of not entering to judge of things
unknown, which dare insinuate to the Magistrate, that it is like they will
condemn childrens baptism, which do baptize them, preach they should be
baptized, and which did never by syllable, letter, or countenance, mislike of
their baptism.

Io. Whitgifte.
Can you deny any thing to be true that I have spoken of the Anabaptists in
this article? or can you deny but that your selves also mislike the ceremonies
used in baptism in this Church? yea and the same that they did? what followed
in them is manifest: what will follow in you God knows: I judge not. What be
my suspicions is declared in my answer to the Admonition, which if you have
truly taken away, I am satisfied: but I am afraid the contrary will appear in
your book.

They bragged that they would defend their cause not only with Fol. 11.
words, but with the shedding of their blood also.

T. C. Pa. 5. Sect. vlt.
We fear no shedding of blood in her majesty's days, for mainteining that
which we hope we shall be able to prove out of the word of God, and wherein we
agree with the best reformed churches, but certain of the things which we
stand upon are such, as that if every hear of our head were a life, we ought
to aford them for the defense of them. We brag not of any the least ability of
suffering, but in the fear of God, we hope of the assistance of God his holy
spirit to abide, whatsoever he shall think good to try us with, either for
profession of this, or any other his truth whatsoever.

Io. Whitgifte.
Thanks be unto God, there is no cause why you should fear. But wherefore do
you then beat any such suspicion into the peoples heads? or why do you beast
of that that you know is nothing near you? and which no man once goes about
to offer unto you? what mean you in the. 59. page of the second Admonition to
say that there is a persecution of poor Christians, and the professors of the
Gospel, suffered, not far unlike Second Admoni. Fol. 59
to the six articles, which crafty heads devised, and brought the king her
noble father unto, as they would do her majesty now? Can any thing be spoken
more untruly, more suspiciously, nay I may rightly say, more seditiously?

If there be such things in controversy betwixt us, that require defense even
unto The state of the co^te^tio^ altered by T. C.
death, yea and that if every hear of our head were a life, we ought to afoord
them for the defense of the same, then truly is there greater matters in hand,
than every body does consider of. Hitherto it has bin the common opinion, that
our contention was but about trifles, about external things, such as might
admit alteration, and were not of the substance of religion: but if this be
true that you here set down, belike a great sort have bin hitherto deceived.
Truly if the matters be of such weight that they require defense of life, you
are much to blame that have not hitherto made them better known. I trust we
shall in this book understand what they are. In the mean time the stout
bragges that are used by some, might well be spared: but we have oftentimes
seen great clouds and small rain, and heard great crackes of thunder, and
(thanks be unto God) small harm done. Neither are you more to be credited for
these boastings, than were the Anabaptists for using the like.

Their whole intent was to make a separation and a schism, and Fol. 17. 77.
to withdraw men from their ordinary Churches and pastors, and therefore most
odiously they inueied against such pastors, and sought by all means to
discredit them.

T. C. Page* 6. Sect. 1.
We make no separation from the Church, we go about to separate al those
things, that offend in the Church, to the end that we being al knit to the
sincere truth of the Gospel, might afterward in the same bond of truth, be
more nearly and closely joined together. We endeavor that every Church having
a lawful pastoure, which is able to instruct, all might be ranged to their
proper Churches, whereas diverse, unless they go to other than their own
parishes, are like to hear few sermons in the year, so far are we from
withdrawing men from their ordinary churches and pastors. Let him that
inueyeth against any pastoure without good cause, bear the punishment: as for
inueying against heaping of living upon living, and joining steeple to
steeple, and non residence and such ambition and tyranny, as bears the sway
in diverse ecclesiastical persons, if the price of the pacification, be the
offending of the Lord, it is better you be displeased, than God be offended.

Io. Whitgifte,
Whether you make a separation or no, and a schism in the Church, let all men
judge: and whether you draw the people from their ordinary pastors or no, let
the secret conuenticles (for I can call them no better) used not only in the
city, but in other places of the country also testify: whether justly, and as
it becomes you, you enuey against such pastors and preachers as mislike your
opinion, and seek their discredit, let the bitter inuectiues in sermons
before the people, when none of them is present, the common table talk, both
your Admonitions, the first and the second, yea and this your passing modeste
book declare. Truly this article and every content in it, was never more truly
verefyed of the Anabaptists, than it is, and may be of you.

What you have to say against the ambition and tyranny of any such as you
especially shoot at, we shall see in your particulars, I trust you will speak
al you know, and more to, else you do degenerate.

We stay ourselves within the bonds of the word of God: we profess our selves

knowledge of the truth of God, and yet I know no question moved, which has not
bin many years before in other churches reformed, holden as truth, and
therefore practiced, and in our Church also have bin some years debated.

Io Whitgifte
Thus much might they allege for themselves also, and apply those textes of
scripture to as good purpose as you do. For that place of the fourth to the
Ephe. does 4. Ephesians.
teach that God has therefore appointed his ministry in the Church, that it
might be a means to bring us to a perfect knowledge of Christ. The meaning is
not that we should be daily altering our judgment, and broching new opinions:
for against such inconstancy, the same Apostle speaks in the. 14. verse of
the same Chapter. 4. Ephesians. ver. 14.
True it is that we must daily grow in faith and love, to the full perfection
whereof, we cannot attain in this life: but it does not therefore follow, that
we like children must be carried about with every wind of doctrine, and never
remain constant in one religion. To the same end are the words of the Apostle
in the. 3. to the Colloss. to be referred.

I believe it will fall out that in this your reply, there will be found
sundry articles, neither allowed nor practiced in any Church reformed, nor in
our Church debated at any time heretofore.

If we defend no falsehood or inconvenient thing, we cannot be counted stubborn

we likewise refer to their judgments, with whom we are conversant, and have
to do with, being misseiudged and untruly condemned of you, we judge nor
condemn no man, their vices we condemn, so far forth as the listes of our
vocation does permit us.

Io. Whitgifte.
Because the answer to this Article consists of (If,) and depends
especially of the testimony of such as have bin a convenient time conversant
with you, I refer the judgment hereof to their experience, and indifferent
considerations.

So do the Anabaptists in words protest as it appears by these words of
Zuinglius Zuingli. in Ecclesi.
in his Eccle. Though they protest, and by oath deny that they take any
authority from magistrates, y et shortly after we should have seen it come to
pass that they would have bin disobedient to all laws of magistrates, if once
they had increased to that number, that they might have trusted to their own
strength. But what your doctrine tends too (though peradventure you mean not
so) it will, I think, appear when it is examined.

If we give honor and reverence to none, let us not only have none again,
but let us be had as those that are unworthy to live amongst men. I fear there
be of those, which are your favorers, Ecclesiastical persons, that if they

or they should put off the cappe first. We give the titles of Majesty, to the
Queen our soueraygne, of grace, to Duke and Duches, of honor to those which
are in honor, and so to every one, according to their estate. If we miss, it
is not because we are not willing, but because we know not always what
pertains unto them, and then our fault is pardonable. For answering
churlishly, Where nothing is mentioned of it, but it is referred (by like) to
this place, and from hence posted over thither again.
it is answered before in the seventh Article.

Io. Whitgifte.
Iudeede the Anabaptists in the end rejected all authority of superiors, and
refused to give unto them their due titles and reverence, yet when they had for
a time obtained their own desire they took that to themselves most
ambitiously, which they refused to give to other. You are not so far gone as
yet in all states, but in the contempt of the state Ecclesiastical, you may
compare with them to the uttermost: what you will do in the end touching the

T. C. Page. 6. Sect. 6.
With acknowledging of our manyfold wants and ignorances, we doubt not also to

the Lord and our briethren, yea all men in that which is good. We reverence
other men's gifts, so as we think the contempt of them, redoundeth to the
giver. Therefore although the cominon infection be in us, yet we hope pride
does not reygne in our mortal bodies.

Well for the right application of this Article, I will go no further than to
this your own book. Surely if the rest of your fellows have the same spirit,
there was never Anabaptists in these qualities to be compared unto you. But I
think better of some of them, so would I have done of you also, if I had not
seen the contrary in you, even sithence our first acquaintance, but
especially, sithence the time, wherein upon just occasions, I began to stir
you: and now most evidently in your Reply, yea this very answer of yours to

They went not to preach in such places where the Gospel was Fol. 88.

defend the ministers own presenting and offering himself or ever he be
called.

Io. Whitgifte.
And why have you then hitherto chosen such places to remain and preach in, as
London. etc. Where the Gospel without you, and before your time was planted?
why have you there and in such like places disquieted the Church and sown
the seed of contention? What calling have you had in those places, which you
might not have by the self same means in other places also, where the Gospel
is not so well planted? Truly this note is so common to all Anabaptists, and so
notorious, that I Zuinglius.

means that they seek for among the Clergy, and the state of the Segniorie,

T. C. Pa* 7. Sect. 2.
So far forth as we may (for the infirmities wherewith we are enclosed) we
endeavor to adorn the doctrine of the Gospel, which we profess, we seek
not the admiration of men (if God do give, that we have honest report, we
think we ought to maintain that, to the glory of God, and advancement of the
Gospel. What is our straightness of life any other, than is required in all
Christians? we bring in I am sure no monachisme or anchorisme, we eat and
drink as other men, we live as other men, we are apparelled as other men, we
lie as other men, we use those honest recreations that other men do, and we
think there is no good thing or commodity of life in the world, but that in
sobriety we may be partakers of, so far as our degree and calling will
suffer us, and as God makes us able to have it. For the hypocrisy that you so
often charge us with, the day shall try it. If any man join with us, with
mind to contend, it is against our will, notwithstanding Who is so blind as he
that will not see?
we know none; and what great stirrers and contenders they be which favor this

These be fair speeches, sooner said than proved: I accuse you not of these

Io. Whitgifte.
An exhortation etc. Page 5. Sect. 4. 5.
These were the manners, conditions, practices, and proceedings of the
Anabaptists in Germany, before they uttered their seditious and monstrous
heresies.

I leave the application hereof to your wisdoms, who easily can conjecture,
what kind of me^ they be that come nearest to these steps. Only I desire you
to be circumspecte, and to understand that Anabaptisme (which usually
follows the preaching of the Gospel) is greatly to be feared in this Church
of England, and almost plainly professed in this Admonition, the authors
whereof agree with them in these forenamed practices and qualities.

T. C. Page 7. Sect. 3.
Do you think to mock the world so, that when you have so unjustly, and so
haynously accused, you may wipe your mouth, and say as you did before that you
will not accuse any? and as now, that you leave the application? Is not this
to accuse, to say that the authors of the Admonition do almost plainly
profess Anabaptisme? Is not this to apply, to say that they agree with the
Anabaptists in A falsificatio^ for ^e adds this word* all*
all the forenamed practices and qualities? you would feign strike us, but you
would do it in the night, when no man should see you, and yet if you have to
do against Anabaptists, you need not fear to proclayme your war against
them: you have a glorious cause, you shall have a certain victory. I dare
promise you, that you shall have all the estates and orders of this Realm to
clappe, their hands and sing your (...), and triumphant songs. But that you
would convey your sting so privily and hissingly, as the Adder does, it
caryeth with it a suspicion of an evil conscience, and of a worse cause, than
you make the world believe you have.

Io. Whitgifte.
Truly I am in good earnest: I mock not: I greatly fear Anabaptisme, which
is an heresy that has many branches, and creeps in secretly under notable
pretenses: and therefore I thought it convenient to gather these notes together
out of such learned and godly writers as have had experience of them, the
which also I have more at large set out in the second edition of my book. If
this offend you, the offense is Page. 19. etc.
taken and not given: you are not able to accuse me justly hitherto of any
untruth. I accuse none, because I know none, that will openly profess
himself to be one, or plainly affirm any article which is of the substance
of their heresye. But I see diverse walking in the same steps that the
Anabaptists did, toward their heresies: and therefore I thought it my
duty to admonish those that be in authority to take heed of them (Let men
apply them as they see cause, and have experience) there can be no hurt in
that, it shall make them the more circumspect, and arm them against the
hypocriste of diverse. How the authors of both the Admonitions do agree with
the Anabaptists, in these forenamed practices, I have declared in my answer
to your Reply.

You falsify my words when you affirm, that I say they agree with the
Anabaptists in all the forenamed practices, and qualities, for I have not this
universal sign all: if they agree with them in many, they are to be
suspected. I think the Anabaptists themselves, as they have diverse and
several opinions in doctrine, so had they also sundry qualities concerning
life and conversation: and yet some there are which be common to them all. I
know that all the estates and orders of this Realitie hate Anabaptisme: I
require not your promise for that matter, which you offer unto me Satis pro
imperio. I know their detestation of that heresy, and therefore I am hold to
open these practices and qualities unto them, least they may by some men's
hypocrisy, and close dealing be deceived. My words and writings be public, my
speeches plain, and therefore if I sting, it is openly inoughe. The privy
hissers and stingers, he those that secretelye smite their neighbor, and hiss
at them in their absence at tables, and in corners, and sting them behind
their backs, when they are not present to answer for themselves: Such adders
and Scorpions, swarm among you.

Moreover it may please you to consider the conditions and practices of the
Donatists, who divided them selves from the congregation, Donatistes.
and had their peculiar Churches, or rather conuenticles, in Africa. They
taught also that all other Churches were spotted and impure, because of their
Ministers. Finally, that there ought to be no compulsion used in matters of
Religion and faith, and that none should be punished for their conscience.

T. C. Page. 7. Sect. 4.
Now you carry us from the Anabaptists in Europe, to the Donatistes in
Affricke, and you will paynte us with their colors, but you want the oil of
truth, or (...) of truth, to cause your colors to cleave and to endure. The
Lord be praised, that your breath although it be (...) ^anke, yet it is not so
strong yt it is able either to turn us, or change us into what forms it
pleases you. I shall desire the reader to look Theodoret lib. 4. de fabulis
Haereticorum and Augustine, ad quod-uult-Deum: and in his first and second
books against (...) Letters, where he shall find of these heretics, that by
comparing them with these, to whom M. Doctor lyk^eth them, the smoke of this
accusation might the better appear: For these sclaunders are not worth the
answering. To this division from the Churches, and to your supposed
conuenticles, I have answered. They taught that there were no true Churches but
in Africa, we teach nothing less, than that there is no true Church but in
England. If the Churches be considered in the parts, whether Minister, or
people, there is none pure and unspotted, and this is the faith of the true
Church, and not of the Donatistes: if it be considered in the whole and
general government and outward policy of it, it may be pure and unspotted,
for any thing I know, if men would labor to purge it. The Donatists vaunted
themselves to be exempted from sinn^, and what lykelyhoode is there between any
assertion of the authors of the Admonition, and this fancy of the Donatistes.
To the last point of no compulsion to be used in matters of Religion denying it
to be true, I refer the further answer to an other place.

Io. Whitgifte.
This that I have set down of the Donatistes is all true, neither can you
disprove one word of it. I write so much of their practices as he correspondent
to the doings The admonitors compared with the Donatistes.
of the Authors of the Admonition. The Donatistes divided th^mselues from the
congregation, and had peculiar Churches, or rather conuenticles in Africa.
These also divide themselves from the Church. And although they tie not the
Church of Christ to any one corner, yet have they their several Churches, and
secret meetings. The (...) made this their excuse, why they departed from
other Churches? because they were not pure and unspotted, and their ministers
of evil life: These men for the like causes separat^ themselves from the
Church also. The Donatistes would have no (...) used in (...) of Religion,

otherwise report of them, than M. Calvin him self does in his book against
the Anabaptists: and Augustine with others that write of them.

Surely neither in the whole, nor in part can the Church be unspotted in this
world, no not in the outward policy and government of it: neither do I
think that you are able to show any examples of such Purity: we have to the
contrary even in the Apostolical Churches in the Apostles time, as the
Church of Corinth, and of the Galatians. Master Calvin in his book aduersus
Anabaptistas is directly against you, and in deed I think that you are not
able to show one learned writer of your opinion in this point.

To conclude, these men flatly join with the Papists, and by the self same

which forsothe know (as you have professed) no commandment in the Scripture

common proverb against you, I will trust you no farther than I see you. After
you have thus yoked them with the Papists, you go about to show wherein they
draw with them. Wherein I first ask of you, if all they that affirm or do
any thing that the enimyes of the Church do, are forthwith ^oyned and
conspired with them against the Church? what I say, that neither Christ nor
Paul joined either with Gentil^, Phariseis, or false Apostles against the
church

Corinthians, our 2. Cor. II. v. 12.
Savior Christ, which spoke against the Jews which were then the only people
of God, as the Gentiles did which were their enimyes, will you say therefore
that either Saint Paul ^. Cor. 9.
joined with the Phariseys or false Apostles, against the Church, or that our
Savior Christ joined against the Jews with the Gentiles? but let us see your
slanders particularly,

Io. Whitgifte.
The same Solomon says, that in the mouth of the foolyshe is the root of

were at enimitie betwi^te them selves, and yet they wyned together against
Christ: The Phariseis and Saduces were of contrary opinions, yet were they
both enimyes to the doctrine of Christ. The Turk and the Pope be of contrary
Religions, yet do they both conspire against the Gospel: Papists and
Anabaptists agree not either in opinion or in society, yet do they both
seek to deface the Church of Christ: Even so they, though they impugn the
doctrine of the Papists never so ^ly, and cast away their marks and badges
never so far from them, though they cannot abide their company, yet do they
with them by the same assertions, (though not by the same arguments) assault
this Church of England, and bend their force against it. Did not the
seditious Jews within Jerusalem, join with the Romans being their enimyes,
inprocuring the destruction of that City? you are not so ignorant as you
would seem to be, I am sure you understand my meaning.

How or where you have called for the punishment of the Papists more than I
have (...) and therefore you counted cruel, and I made and moderate,
certaynely I know not, I hear only your self say so. What I have done, and
where, I mind not to brag of at this time, I leave that for you.

What I have professed concerning the putting to death of Herotickes, the same
do I profess still, and am ready thereof to give an account at all times as
I shall be required: although neither you, nor any man else, have heard me teach
that doctrine, or profess it: but this is one of your glances by the way:
when occasion is given me to speak of that matter I will plainly utter my
conscience by the grace of God, In the mean time, it is no cause why I should
be better thought of among the Papists, for both their practice and their
doctrine is eleane contrary.

To your question I answer, that if they do that against the Church, which
the enimyes do against the same, then do they in that conspire with them
against the Church: and therefore all your example^ (...) used are to no
purpose at all. For Saint Paul joined with the Phariseys and with the false
Propheteo in those things which were allowed of the Church, and for the
commodity of the Church, and therefore in no respect against the Church, the
same answer I make to the example of Christ justly reproving the Jews: if
you would have used apt examples for your purpose, then should you have
brought in such as being of contrary judgments, have notwythsta^dyng
sought to overthrow one and the self same thing, although by diverse means:
But then should you have concluded against your self, as you must of
necessity dee. So that here where you would seem to say much, you have said
nothing at all.

Io. Whitgifte.
An exhortation etc. page 5. Sect. vlt.
First the Papists affirm that we are not the true Church, no, that we have
not so much as the outward face and she we of the true Church, and so do these
men almost in flat and plain terms.

T. C. page 8. Sect. 1.
They do not deny but there is a visible Church of God in England, and
therefore your sayings of them, that they do almost in plain and flat terms
say, that we have not so much as any outward face and show of the true
Church, argues that you have almost no love in you, whieh upon one word once
uttered, contrary to the tenor of their book, and course of their whole
life, surmise this of them, and how truly you conclude of that word (scarce)
it shall appear when we come to that place.

Io. Whitgifte.
They do in plain and flat terms write as much as I do report of them in
this article: for a manifest proof thereof ^ refer the reader to the. 6.
page of the second Admonition, and the. 53. of the first Admonition: and to
the whole discourse of both. My (almost) is equivalent to they* searse. But
whosoever shall well consider the tenor of their books, and the course of
their life, may easily understand, that both I might have lefte^ out my
almost, and they their scarce, likewise.

Io. Whitgifte.
An exhortation etc. Page 6. Sect. 1.
Secondly the Papists say, that we have no ministry, no Bishops, no
pastors, because they be not rightly and canonically called to these
functions: the self same do these men affirm.

T. C. Page 8. Sect. 2.
I have answered this in the second article of Anabaptisme, that you charge us
with.

Io. Whitgifte.
Then have I answered the same there also.

Thirdly the Papists say that our Sacraments be not rightly ministered: and so
say they likewise.

T. C. Page. 8. Sect. 3.
This is also answered in the third.

Io. Whitgifte.
That is, you have there closely confessed this to be true. But that the reader
may understand that it is most truly verifyed of them, let him peruse that
which is written in the second Admonition. fol. 43. where they say, the
sacraments be wickedly 2. Admon, fol. 43.
ministered: and in the first Admonition. fol. 89. and that also that follows
in this book.

Fourthly the Papists wholly *condemn our book of common prayers, set out by
public authority, and the whole order of our service: in that point do these
men fully join with them also, for they condemn it wholly, and that with most
bitterness.

T. C. Page. 8. Sect. 4.
I answer, that they do not condemn it wholly, but find fault with it, as in
some points disagreeing with the word of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
For the proof of this article, read the first Admonition. fol. 85. 86. etc.

Fifthly the Papists would not have the Scriptures read in the Church to the
people: no more would they. For they say, reading is not feeding, but as evil
as playing on a stage and worse to.

T. C. Page 8. Sect. 5.
All men shall perceive, when I come to that place, how you have racked their
words to an other sense, than they spoke them, in the mean season it is
inoughe that they confess that readyng in the Church is godly.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is well that you confess it to be godly, it will appear when I come to that
place, that the authors of the Admonition, both write and think far
otherwise, except they write one thing and think another.

Sixthly the Papists deny the civil Magistrate to have any authority in
Ecclesiasticalll matters, and so do they.

I have answered in the Where you have not spoken one word of it.
tenth article of Anabaptisme.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your answer is there very confused, and uncertain: but for the proof of
this article, I refer the reader to certain notes which I have collected out
of your book touching this matter in this my defense.

Io. Whitgifte.
An exhortation etc. page 6. Sect. 6.
To be short, the Papists refuse to come to our Church, to Communicate with us
in the Lords Supper: and these men would not have them by laws and punishment
compelled thereunto.

T. C. page 8. Sect. vlt.
I answer that Doeg, when he said that David came to Abimilech, said nothing
but truth, and when they that witnessed against Christ that he said, destroy
the temple, and in three days I will build it up again, said nothing but
that our savior Christ said. But yet Doeg was a slaunderer, and the other,
false witnesses: because the one spoke of mind to hurt, and the other
understood it of another temple, than our savior Christ meant it: so although
you do in part rehearse their words, yet taking them contrary to their
meaning (which might easily appear by the circumstances) I see not how you
can be free from these faults, unless it be done ignorantly, which I wish
were true for your own sake. And here I will desire thee gentle reader, to
mark with what conscience this man says, that they are joined and confederate
with the Papists against the Church. The Papists mislyke of the Book of
common prayers for nothing else, but because it swarueth from their Mass
book, and is not in all points like unto it. And these men mislyke it, for
nothing else, but that it has to much lykelyhoode unto it. And judge whether
they be more joined with the Papists, which would have no communion or
fellowship with them, neither in ceremonies, nor doctrine, nor government, or
they, which forsaking their doctrine, reteyne part of their ceremonies, and
almost their whole government: that is, they that separate themselves, by three
walls, or by one, they that would be parted by the broad sea from them, or
which would be beuided by narrow water, where they may make a bridge to come
again, and displace the truth of the Gospel, as they have done in times past:
They that would not only unhorse the Pope, but also take away the styrrops,
whereby he should never get into the sadle again: or they that being content
with that, that he is unhorsed, leave his ceremonies and his government
especially, as styrrops, whereby he may leap up again when as occasion
serves. They that are content, only to have cut the arms and body of
Antichristianitie, or they which would have stumpe, and root all up.

Io. Whitgifte.
Better it is to have a bad excuse than none at all. Their words and meaning is
plain, as shall appear when I come to the^. I think in deed their meaning
is, that they would not have them compelled to come to our Churches, and to
communicate in the Lords supper with us, as it is now ministered: For it is
well known, how they themselves refuse to do the same, and how they have
defaced both this Church, and the manner and form of administering the
Sacrament: what they would do, if they might have their own devised
reformation, and have the law in their own hands, I can not tell, but it is
very like that they would be sharp and severe enough in compelling men to
come. I speak of their opinion touching the compelling of men to come to our
Church, unto the which they come not themselves.

That which follows in your Reply, I have sufficiently answered before,
Page 51.
where I have declared, how that it is no strange thing for men of clean
contrary judgments and opinions, to join together in oppugning one and the
self same truth. The Papists pretend one cause of misliking the book of
Common prayers, and they pretend an other cause of misliking the same, do they
not now both join in defacing and overthrowing it? That which follows is
but words, those things which they reprove in that book be godly, and most
of them not to be bettered. The persons that stand in the defense of that
book, have all points of Papistrie in as great detestation, as they, and
peradventure greater, for they so occupy themselves in these external
things, which be of small importance, that in the mean time they The
Admonitors gratify the Papists.
slip over matters of weighte and substance, even the principal points
where in we differ from them. Wherefore this comparison of yours stands upon
a false ground. For I am fully persuaded, that you and they do the Pope great
good service, and that he would not miss you for any thing. For what is his
desire, but to have this Church of England (which he has accursed) utterly
defaced, and discredited, to have it by any means overthrown, if not by
forreyne enemies, yet by domestical dissension. And what fitter and apter
instruments could he have had for that purpose than you, who under pretense
of zeal, overthrow that which other men have builded, under color of
purity, seek to bring in deformity, and under the cloak of equality and
humility, would usurp as great tyranny and lofty Equality made a cloak for
ambition.

but out of Zuinglius, and Gastius also, and you shall see them in all points
to use these plausible pretenses, and to accuse their adversaries after the
like manner.

Io. Whitgifte.
An exhortation, etc. Page 6. Sect. vlt.
Hereby it is manifest, that the Papists and they jointly do seek to shake,
nay to overthrow the self same foundations, grounds, and pillars of our
Church, although not by the self same instruments, and engines. Wherefore
it is time to awake out of sleep, and to draw out the sword of discipline,
to provide that laws, which be general, and made for uniformity, as well of
doctrine as ceremonies, be generally and universally observed, that those which
according to their consciences and duty execute them, be maintained, and not
discouraged. Either boldly defend the Religion and kind of government in this
Realm established, or else (if you can) reform and better the same: for it
can not be but that this freedom given to men to obey and disobey what they
list, to speak what they list, against whom they list, and where they list, to
breche what opinions and doctrine they list, must in the end burst out into
some strange and dangerous effect. The Lord both grant unto you that be
Magistrates, the spirit of government, and to all other that be subjects, the
spirit of true obedience. Amen.

you accused none, but suspected certain? would you have the sword to be

are nothing like either Anabaptists, Donatistes, or Papists, and your self
most unlike to him that you profess to be, and that you see, that all your
sclaunders are quenched by the innocence (as it were by water) of those men,

geese, which by their barking and gagling, should give warning in the night,
of thieves that entered in: but if they cried in the day time, when there was no
suspicion, and when men came in to worship, then their legs were broken,
because they cried when there was no cause. If therefore he have accused
justly, then is he worthy to have his diet allowed him of the common charges:
But if otherwise, we desire not that his legs may be broken (as theirs were)
but this we humbly crave, that if this our answer do not sufficiently purge
us, that we may be sifted and searched nearer, that if we nourishe any such
monstrous opinions (as are surmised) we may have the reward of them: if we do
not, then at the least, we may have the good abearing, against such
sclaunderous tongues, seeing that God has not only committed unto the
Magistrate, the safety of our goods and life, but also the preservation of
our honest report.

Ungodliness being convicted, when she is destitute of a good answer, turns
her self to reprochefull words: but your heat of words, and forgetfulness
of duty and reverence, I pass over with silence. The multitude of livings
which I have, I do enjoy by law, and may retain (I thank God) with a far
better conscience, than T. C. did one living for the space of certain years,
and would have done still with all his heart, if he might have bin winked at,
though it were expressly against his oath. My pomp is very small, my pride of

statutes of the College where I am (to the which T. C. has bin sworn) and
to the laws of the Realm. What I hereafter look for, it is hard for you to
judge: But I most humbly thank my heavenly father, that in all this storming
of yours, wherein you have blown out against me what you could possibly

that consumes the body, which I move unto, but it is the sword of correction

shedding of blood. That sword of discipline, I call for still, and say with

man may freely defend his errors, and spread abroad in the Church false
doctrine, there will be more contentions, sects and discord among Christian
Churches, than ever there was among Infidels. And again, If every man may
without controlment preach among the people his own private fancy and
opinion, contrary to the determination and authority of the Church, it will
shortly come to pass that we shall have more errors than Christians.

If I have accused any man unjustly, there is a law, whereunto I am subject:
but your words are not of that weight, neither your defense such, that
therefore they please or satisfy wise men, because you speak them. If they
can say no more for them selves than you have said for the^, then they must
remain still in the same suspicion.

against the manifest truth of God: First, by experience their rigor has too
plainly appeared ever since their wicked reign, and specially for the space
of these five or six years last past together. Of the enormities, which with
such rigor they maynteine, these treatises do in part make mention, justly
craving redress thereof. But the matters do require a larger discourse. Only
the authors of these, thought it their parts to admonish you at this time,
of those inconveniences which men seem not to think upon, and which without
reformation, can not but increase further dissension: the one part being,
proud, pontifical, and tyrannous: and the word of God for the other part

would be evident. And would to God, that free conference in these matters

An answer to the Preface of the Admonition.
THese two treatises contained in this Admonition, as they be void of sound
learning, so are they full of blind affection, and stuffed with uncharitable
and unchristian Arrogancy and unchristian speches of the Libellers.
terms and phrases. Wherefore it is to be feared, that they proceed not of
love, but of hatred, not of zeal, but of malice, not of humility, but of
arrogancy, not of minds desirous to reform, but of stomachs seeking to
deforme and confound that which is in due form and order by lawful
authority established. For what charitable, zealous, and humble spirit, would
so spitefully and slanderously speak of their brethren, whose doctrine is
pure, whose zeal is fervent, whose suffering for the Gospel has been in
time of trial comparable with any man's that now lives: who have also
paynefully taught the word of God in this Realm, and do at this day, and by
whose ministry the Gospel has taken root, and is come to that increase
that now (God be thanked) appears. Surely these opprobrious terms, Proud
generation, tyrannous Lordships, ungracious, cruel, Popelike, wicked raygne,
proud enemies. etc. applied to brethren, proceed not from the humble and
mylde spirit of God, but from the proud and arrogante spirit of Satan.
Therefore by this unseemly Preface, it may appear from what spirit the rest
of this Admonition springs. Touching the cruelty and rigor Pretended
persecution.
these men complain of, I shall need to speak little, being manifest to all
that be not with sinister affection blinded, that lack of severity is the
principal cause of their licentious liberty. But who sees not their
hypocrisy, which would make the world believe that they are persecuted,
when they be with too much lenity punished for their intolerable contempt
of good laws, and other disordered dealings? Nay such is their perverseness,
or rather arrogancy, that if they be debarred, but from the least part of
their will and desire, by and by they cry out of cruelty and persecution, it
is to be doubted what these men will do when persecution comes in deed,
which now make so much of a little, or rather of nothing. As for this great
brag, Stout brags.
For how soever learned and many they seem to be, they should and may in
this Realm find ^owe to match them, and shame them too, if they hold on as
they have begone, Satis arroganter dictum est, and verifieth that to be true,
that is commonly spoken of these kind of men, that is, that they contemn all
other in comparison of them selves: that they think them selves only zealous,
only learned. etc. But it is possible that they may be matched, and I know
no man of learning, afraid to encounter with them, either by word or writing.
Touching the ministry and gouernmente of the Church, what faults there is
to be therein found we shall understand, when we come to their reasons. God
grant us humble and meek spirits, that godly unity may be maynteined in the
Church.

One thing I must desire thee to note (gentle Reader) (wherein the folly of
these men maruellously appears) how they have painted the margent of their
book with quoting of Scriptures, as though al were scripture they write, when
as in deed they abuse the scripture and thee For what one place of scripture is
in all this Preface alleged to any purpose, and yet how many is there quoted?

23. is this: But he ansvvered her not a word then came to him his Disciples,
and besought him, saying: send her away for she cries after us. In the
sixeteenth of Luke it is thus: Then he said unto them, ye are they which
justify your selves before men, but God knovveth your hearts: for that
which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God. I
would gladly know how their assertion, and these two textes hang together. I
allow not tyrannous lordeship to stand with Christ's kingdom: But it may
well inoughe for any thing in these two places to the contrary. Tyrannous
lordship is not esteemed among men, but hated.

The Reply unto the answer of the Preface.
T. C. Page 9. Sect. 2.
IT may be said unto you, that which Aristotle said of a certain
Philosopher, that he knew not his own voice: For if that you had remembered
that which you do so often promise, that you will not answer words, but
matter, the Printer should not have gained so much, men should not have
bestowed so much money of a thing not of so great value, nor that (which is
more) the world should not be burdened with unprofitable writings. For how
often runninges out have you, to draw the authors of the Admonition into
hatred, by inueyghing bitterly against their vnlearnednesse, maliciousness.
etc. (as it pleases you to term it) so that if there were any excess of
speech in them, you have paid it again with measure pressed down, and
running over. How often charge you them with pride and arrogancy, men that
confess once or twice of them selves their want of skill, and which profess
nothing of them selves, but only a bare and naked knowledge of the truth,
which may be done with modesty, even of them which have no learning. And yet
those that know them, know that they are neither void of the knowledge of the
tongues, nor of the liberal Arts, albeit they do not make so many words of

it, as you. Solomon says, that he that is despised, and has but one
servant, is better than he which magnifieth and sets out him self, and
yet wants bread: whereby he means, that the man that has but a little,
and carries his countenance accordingly, is much more to be esteeined, than he
which bears a great port, and has not to supporte it. These brethren
have not undertaken the knowledge of Logike, Philosophy, and other school
learning, whereof notwithstanding they are not destitute: you in so often
reproching them, with the ignorance of them, would make us believe, that you
are so notable a Logician, and Philosopher, as if Logike and Philosophy had
been borne with you, and should dye with you: when as it may appear partly
by that which has been spoken, and partly by those things, that will fall
out hereafter, that you are better acquaynted with the names of Logike and
Philosophy, than with any sound, or substantial knowledge of them. But let
that be the Uniuersities judgment, where you have been brought up, and are
best known. To return to your unprofitable excursions, how often times in
your book do you pull at the Magistrates sword, and what sword you would
have, I leave to the consideration of all men, seeing you are not satisfied
with their imprisonment: whereupon also does eusue the expense of that which
they have. What matter is in all these, that brings any help to the decision
of these causes, that are in question between us? how many leaves have you
wasted in confuting of the quotations, which (you say) are Though they be

unjust your reprehensions are, and how small cause you have to lead th^in
oftentimes, so gloriously in triumph (as you do) which I assure you I could do
in the most places. As what could be more ^tly alleged, to induce to read the
book, than that they should try all things? what more fitly to hold men
from rash condeinning of things, than that they should be slow ^ speak?
what more fitly to move that they should not ^illike of the goodness of the
cause, for the simplicity or base degree of them that defend it, than that we
should not have the says of our Lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons?
And what more vmustly done than that you should whip them for the Printers
fault, in putting one place for another? If, I say, I should thus go about
to make good every place, how evil should I deserve either of learning, or of
the truth it self, in blotting of much paper, whereby no profit would come
to the Reader? And if the days of a man were as many as the days of an oak, I
would neither willingly trouble, nor be troubled, with such strife of words.

have conscience of pestering the world, with such What mente you then to

Therefore all these, and whatsoever else wandering words, I shall meet with
in this book, I ineane (by Gods grace) as dead things and nothing worth, to
bury with silence, and will answer to these things, which couch the matters
that lie in controversy between us. And as for the vnlearnednesse, blind
zeal, malice, intolerable pride, contempt of all good orders, and twenty
such more things, wherewith M. Doctor charge us, if our life and conversation
does not confute them sufficiently, our words and profesiion of our selves
will not do it. And therefore we will first stay our selves, with the
testimony of our own consciences, and then in the equity of the judgment of
all those, which shall indifferently consider these things that we are charged
with. And as for the sword that is so hotly and hastily called for, we hope it
be in their hands, which will use it better than they are by you directed.

Io. Whitgifte.
I think those that shall read my book, with indifferent judgment, will
say that I have performed my promise: and am as spare in words without
matter, as conveniently I could be, and much more sparing than you are,
either in this place where you have nothing but wor^es, or in the rest of your
book. The vaiue of my book, and the unprofitableness of it, I refer to the
judgment of others. I have done my duty in it (as I am persuaded) and
satisfied my conscience.

I do inueighe against the authors of the Admonition in no otherwise and
sort, than modes^ie, and the cause it self requires: If I have, show the
particulars, note the places. I speak not of their knowledge and learning,
otherwise than it is uttered in their book. I neither despise them in such
sort, nor magnify my self: I leave that to you and yours, and thereof I
require the testimony of this your own book.

I boast not of any profounde skill in School learning, (I thank God for
that which I have) I refuse not the Uniuersities judgment of me, from the
time of my first being Sophister unto this day. I think it has been, and
is better persuaded of me than I am worthy, which appears in that it has
laid upon me (as much as upon any one man) from time to time, from my first
peeping out, unto this day, all the publyke exercises in all sciences that I
have professed, without my seeking, nay against my will: and I trust that I
neither have in doing of them disgraced her, nor shamed my self. But surely I
am ashamed thus to brust out to the defense of my self, if I were not
thereunto compelled by your uncivil and opprobrious speeches.

My excursions be necessary. I pu^ no o^tener, nor in any other manner, nor at
any other sword of the Magistrate, than the state of the Church, my office
and vocation, and charity it self requires: neither do I mean the authors
of the Admonition only, but their adherentes also. Surely I believe that by
that means these controuers^es would shortly be ended, and the Church kept
in great quietness and good order.

The confutation of the quotations was most necessary, and it is that, that

you most sharply. True it is, that they be vain, unlearned, and to no
purpose, and yet used as grounds of that Admonition, and the doctrine therein
contained. Wherefore the opening of the va^itie and vnap^nesse of them, is the
overthrow of that book: which the common sort thought to be all Scripture,
and nothing else but Scripture, and therefore the doctrine therein contained to
be most true, when as in deed the Scriptures be there as manifestly wrested,
and unfitly used as they be of the Papis^es and Anabaptists. And therefore
though they were vaynely alleged of them, yet were they necessarily confuted
by me. M. Calvin in his book against the Anabaptists, says, That they
win credit with those that be zealous, because Calvin ^duers.
they pretend the word of God, and have it always in their mouth. And
therefore Anabap.
though their allegations be frivolous, yet does he spend much labor in
detectyng them: even so say I, you pretend the word of God in all things,
and thereby you do deceive the godly and zealous people: wherefore it is
expedient, that your grounds be laid open, to the intent it may be known
how crookedly and evil fauouredly you build upon them.

If you could maintain every place, or many of the places, I dare say you
would, but surely I commend your Khetorike. Those places that you would
seem to give some countenance unto, bewray your lack of ability to defend
either them, or the rest. For you answer not one word to the reasons, for
the which I disallowe them, nor to the true sense and meaning which I give of
them. Truly if you should thus go about to make them good, in so doing you
should do your cause no great good. But here you have wholly omitted, the.
15. of Mathewe, and the. 16. of Luke. The one whereof though it be corrected,
yet it is in a manner as far from the purpose as it was before, as it may
ap^eare in the Additions and alterations, etc. at the end of the first book.
Your words of pleasure which follow, because they be but words, I wholly
omit them, as I will also do in many other places, where I shall find
nothing else, least I make this Book longer than is convenient.

generali: they should have declared who they be that have this authority
forbidden, and what the authority is. Touching these places aileaged in the.
20. of Matthew. 10. of Mark. 22. of Luke, Musculus and diverse other learned men
think, that they extend not only to the Apostles, and men of the Clergy,
as we call them, but to all Christians, of what state so ever they be. And it
is the common opiuion of al writers, that these words of Christ do not
condemn superiority, Lordeshippe, or any such like authority, but the
ambitious desire of the same, and the tyrannical usage thereof.

T. C. Page. 10. Sect. 2. and. 3.
To come therefore unto the matter out of the places of the. 20. of Mathewe, and
the. 22. of Luke, where our Savior Christ, upon occasion of the mordinate
request of the sons of zebede, puts a difference between This is is a
note of your own devising.
the civil and ecclesiastical function, he places the distinction of them in
two points, whereof the one is, in their office, the other is in their names
and titles.

The distinction of the office, he notes, in these words, the kings of the
Gentiles have dominion over them, and the Princes exercise authority over
them, but it shall not be so with you. Whereupon the argument may be thus
gathered, that wherein the Civil magistrate is severed from the Ecclesiastical
officer, does not agree to one minister over an other. But the Petitio

dominion. Therefore bearyng dominion does not agrec to one minister over an
other.

Page. II Sect. 1. and. 2.
Touching their names and titles, he puts a difference in these words: And
they are called Gracious Lords, but it shall not be so with you. And so the
argument may be framed as before, that forasmuch as they are severed in
titles, and that to the Civil minister does agree the title of gracious
Lords, therefore to the Ecclesiastical minister the same does not agree. For
as it is fit, that they whose offices carry an outewarde majesty and pomp,
should have names agreeable to their magnificence, so is it meet, that those
that God has removed from that pomp and outward show, should likewise be
removed from such swellyng and loftye titles, as do not agree with the
simplicity of the ministry which they exercise. And whereas it might seem
somewhat unjust, that he that has the greater gifts, should not be preferred
to those which have less, our savior Christ shows that the matter is
far otherwise. For by how much every man does excel his fellow in the
gifts of the holy Ghost, by so much more he ought to employe himself to the
benefyte of others: so that in a manner he should become (as it were) their
servant to do them good, which although it be in part, common to the civil
magistrate, with the minister of the word, yet he does never let down
himself so low, nor gives his service either to the Church or common wealth,
but that he does and ought in that service to retain that dignity and
countenance, with the marks and notes thereof, which his Princely estate
does require.

In the end he propounds himself for example, in whom he sets before
their eyes a perfect pattern of the ministe^. For seeing he being Lord,
took upon him to be a servant, and being Emperor and king of heaven and
earth, was content to want all the glory and show of the world (his
ministry so requiryng) it should be great shame for them which were his
disciples, chosen out for the ministry, not to content themselves, but to
aspire unto such offices and dignities, as they dreamed of.

Io. Whitgifte.
You say that Christ in that place puts a difference, between the Civil
and Ecclesiastical functions, and that in two points, in their office, and in
their names and titles: the distinction of the office (you say) he notes in
these words. The Kings of the Gentiles. etc. of their names and titles these:
And they are called gracious Lords, etc. Whereupon you conclude, as though all
were cock sure.

But I pray you tell me, whereupon do you gather that Christ makes any such
distinction here, either of offices, or titles? In deed he would have a
difference both betwixt the authority of his Disciples and other Christians,
and the dominion of Heathenishe Princes: and also betwixt their affections in
desiryng the same: and therefore does he expressly say, The kings of the
Gentiles. etc. If he had meant any such distinction of offices or titles, as
you would make us believe, he would have said, The Kings and Princes of the
Jews, etc. or rather Kings and Princes, without any Government not forbidden
of Christ, but the kind of government.
further addition: but seeing that he says the Kings and Princes of the
Gentiles, it is manifest, that he forbids not only to his Disciples, but to
all Christians such tyrannical kind of government as the Gentiles used, and
that ambitious desire and affection of the same which ruled in them. For
Christ uses to call back those that be his from errors and corrupt
affections, by the example of the Gentiles, as he does in the. 6. of Matthew
from too much carfulness for meat and drink, and such like. Nam omnia ista
gentes exquirunt, For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: where he
does not forbid them to seek for meat, drink, and clothing, but to seek
for it too carefully, and with mistrust of Gods providence, as the Gentiles
did. In like manner here he forbids not government, either in the civil or
Ecclesiastical state: but he forbids such government as the Gentiles used,
and such corrupt affections as they had in desiring the same.

Touchying your argument, I say it has two faults. First, it is a fallacion,
Two faults in the argument of T. C.
a petitione principij, for you take it as granted, that the Civil Magistrate
is severed from the Ecclesiastical officer, by bearyng dominion, which I will
not simplye grant unto you, for that is partly our question. Secondly, your
minor is ambiguous, The civil Magistrate does not simply biffer from the
Ecclesiastical, by bearing dominion.
and therefore in that respect, your argument may be also placed in the
fallacion of aequiuocation, for the word Dominion, may have diverse
significations: It may signifye such dominion as Christ speaks of in this
place, that is, rule with oppression. It may also signify the absolute
authority of a Prince, such as is mentioned. 1. Samuel. 8. Thyrdely, it may
signify any peculiar office of superiority and government under the Prince,
at the appointment of the Prince, as the Diverse significations of the word
Dominion.
authority of a Judge, Justice. Mayor. etc. Last of all, it may signifye any
jurisdiction or kind of government. If you take it in either of the two first
significations, your minor is true: if in either of the two latter
significations, it is false. For we grant, that there is great difference
betwixt the dominion of Kings and Princes, and betwixt the Jurisdiction and
authority of Bishops. Kings have power over life and goods. etc. so have
not Bishops. Kings have authoritiie in all causes, and over all persons
withintheir dominions, without any limitation: if Bishops have any such
dominion, especially in Civil causes, it is not in the respects they be
Bishops, but it is from the Prince, and limited unto them.

Touching their names and titles (you say) he puts a difference in these
words, and they are called gracious Lords, but it shall not be so with you.
etc. The words of the twentieth of Mathewe be these: And they that are
great, exercise authority over them. In the. 10. of Mark, the same words
be used. In the. 22. of Luke, the Greek word is (...), benefici vocantur,
they are called bountiful, or beneficial, which I see not how you can by
any means apply to your purpose: For Mathewe and Mark refer this clause,
It shall not be so among you, not to any name, but to the ambition and
tyrannical kind of dominion, which our Savior Christ there reproves, as
it is most manyfeste. And therefore this place of Luke, must also be
expounded by them. Neither is this word (...), of any such imperiousness,
that Christ should forbid Caluinus.
his Disciples the name. M. Calvin in his Commentaries interpretyng these
words of Saint Luke says thus: As touching the words: where Mathewe
has, that kings exercise authority over them, in Luke we read, that they
are called bountyfull, in the same sense: as though he should say, Kings have
plenty of all things, and are very rich, so that they may be bountyfull and
liberal: And a little after he says, that they do appetere laudem
munificentiae, desire the commendation of bountyfulnesse. I know that certain
of the Kings of Egypt were called (...), munifici and benefactores,
bountiful and benefactours: and that they were delyghted to be so called. I
know also that among the Hebrews their Princes were called Munifici and
liberales per antonomasian: But what then? if either they vaynegloriously
desired that name, or were so called, when they deserved rather the names of
Tyrants and oppressoures, does it therefore follow, that they be unlawful
names for such as may deserve them? The most that can be gathered of this
place (for any thing that I perceive) is, that the Kings of the Gentiles had
vain and flattering titles given them, being nothing less in deed than that
which their names did signify: and so may it be a good admonition for men
How the words, Vos autem non sic, may be reserred to names.
to learn to answer to their names and titles, and to do in deed that which
by snche names and titles is signified. Now then if you will have Vos autem
non sic, but it shall not be so with you, to be a prohibition to all
Christians, and especially to Bishops, that they shall not ambitiously seek
dominion as the Gentiles did: unjustly and tyrannously use their authority, as
they also did: nor have names and titles to the which they do not accordingly
answer, no more than the Gentiles did, then I agree with you. But if you will
have Vos autem non sic, to restrain them from being called (...), that is,
liberal benefactors. etc. as your interpretation agrees not with the words of
the other two Evangelists, so does it not with any learned interpreter that I
have read.

To your argument concerning names and titles, I answer as I did to the
former. Diverse kinds of names.
Some names and titles are proper to the civil Magistrate only, as the names of
Emperor, King, Prince, Duke, Earl. etc. These names are not given to any of the
Clergy in this Church to my knowledge: some names are common to the Civil
Magistrate, Names common to civil and Ecclesiastical persons.
with Ecclesiastical persons, as certain names of reverence, of superiority,
and of office. The name of Gracious Lord, is a name of superiority, and of
reverence, according to the manner of the country where it is used, and
therefore may well agree, either to the civil or Ecclesiastical persons: and
in many places, diverse are called by this name Lord, (which is in Latin
Dominus,) for reverence and civility; which have very small dominion. As for
the name of Archebishoppe or Metropolitan, that is not proper to any civil
Magistrate, and therefore without the compass of your argument. Thus then you
see, that some titles are proper to the civil Magistrate, some to the
Ecclesiastical, and some common to both, whereby your mayor is utterly
overthrown. As for this word (...), upon the which you seem to grouude your
argument, I see not why it may not be common to all men, that show themselves
liberal and beneficial.

There is no man denies but that there is, and must be great difference
betwixt the pomp and outward show of a Prince, and the state of an
Ecclesiastical person, both in titles and other majesty: and I think that
he is very blind, that sees it not so to be in this Church of England: yet
may the Ecclesiastical person show forth the countenance of his degree,
whereunto he is called of God, by his Prince, and by the laws of that realm
wherein he is a subject.

It is true, that an Ecclesiastical Minister does much differ from a civil
Magistrate Ministers may execute some kind of civil jurisdiction.
touching his ministry and spiritual calling, yet is he not so distinct,
that he may exercise no such civil office wherein he may do good, and which
is an help to his Ecclesiastical function. As the civil Magistrate may in
some things exercise jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, and meddle in matters of the
Church, so may the Ecclestasticall person in some causes use civil
jurisdiction, and deal in matters of the common wealth, if it shall be thought
expedient or necessary by the chief Magistrates. Calvin.

agree A temporal lord may be a preacher.
with you, yet has he these words. Add hereunto, that Christ did not so
much respect the persons of men, as the state of his Church, for it may so
be, that he which is Lord of a village or city, do also (necessity
constraining) exercise the office of teaching. Whereby it is plain, that a
temporal Lord (if necessity require) may together with his Lordship become
a preacher of the Gospel. M. Brentius in his. 48. Homily Brentius.
What kind of external do minion is denied to ministers.
upon Luke, speaking of this matter says, that Bishops which glory
themselves to be the successors of the Apostles, may not under the pretense of
their Ecclesiastical office usurp external dominion over kings and Princes,
to make kings whom they list, and to displace whom they list. And by and by

preacher) to have temporal dominion, and to govern What kind of temporal

the people committed unto him by civil policy? I answer that it is not
lawful for a Minister of the Church to usurp such rule and dominion, under
the pretense of the Gospel, and of his Ecclesiastical Ministry: Peter must
not therefore have dominion over Antioche or Rome, because he is an Apostle.
etc. But if temporal dominion or possession happen to the minister of the
Gospel, either by inheritance, or ordinary election, or any other Civil or
lawful contracte. etc. then may he enjoy these external things. etc. And in
his. 52. Homily, upon these words of Christ now Idem.
in question, he writes thus: What shall we then say to these things?
because Christ says: The kings of the Nations bear rule over them, and are
called bountyfull, ^.
but it must not be so among you, shall it not be lawful for a Christian
man to bear rule in a temporal kingdom, and acknowledge the tytles of
honor, as of bountyfulnesse and clemency, which are given unto Princes? Is
it not lawful also for a Bishop, to have temporal dominion? Christ in this
place does not think it unlawful for Christians, to be Magistrates, neither
does he forbid Bishops to have external dominion. But he shows a
difference between the kingdom of this world, and his kingdom. He teaches,
that the kingdom of this world and his kingdom are so distinct, that he
which is a minister of his kingdom, must not in that respect usurp the
kingdom of this world: for the Apostles thought, that because they were
Apostles, therefore they should possess the kingdoms of the world. And
therefore Christ in this place condemns their false opinion. etc. Christ
does not condemn Magistracy among Christians. etc. No, he does not forbid
Bishops to have external dominion, if they come unto it by inheritance, or by
lawful election. It is a very hard matter both to preach the Gospel, and
to exercise temporal dominion, and yet it is not of it self unlawful
together with the ministry, to keep and use temporal dominion, if it come
ordinarily and lawfully. For Christ came not to trouble civil laws, and the
ordinary gouernmentes of the kingdoms of this world, but rather that these
being preserved, his Gospel might be preached quietly. Haec Brentius. But of
civil authority in Ecclesiastical persons, occasion will be given to speak
more at large hereafter.

among you, let him be your minister: though it may especially appertain to
the Apostles, yet it is also a general rule for all Christians, and so is the
example of him also, which he propounds unto them. And so does Musculus
very truly interpret this place, to whom M. Bucer agrees, whose words be
these: The Anabaptists Buce^ in. 20.
think here that they are able to prove, that it pertains not to a Christian
to bear rule, Mitth.
and that no man can be together a Magistrate, and a Christian, because Christ
said They which^ear rule godl^y, serve.
here to his Disciples, Vos autem non sic, not consydering that those, which
godlylle and according to the will of the Lord bear rule, Nihil minus quam
dominari, imo maxim seruire, and tanto pluribus, quanto pluribus praefuerint,
do nothing less than bear rule in deed, yea verily do most of all serve,
and even unto so many do they serve, over how many so ever they bear rule:
surely Christ would have his Apostles to have their authority in Churches,
and they themselves did greatly require to be obeyed: but because in that they
sought nothing unto themselves, but only salvation and the glory of God in
those whom they ruled, they did govern the Churches: they had every where the
superiority: they ruled such as believed: they would have the godly to be
obedient unto them: interim nihilominus seruierunt omnibus, dominati sunt
nemini, And yet in the mean time served all, and had dominion over none: So
also in the Civil gouernmente, who was ever in greater dignity than Moses, or
more to be feared for his authority and power? and yet who ever served mo,
more diligently, and more humblye, which never sought any thing for himself,
or took any thing unto himself. etc. but day and night to the vttermoste of
his power, sought for the safety of the people. etc. If any now so bear
office, and rule the works of the hands of the Lord, and govern the sheep
of his pasture according to his will, what does he else but serve all those
whom he governs? And The place of Math. 20. general.
therefore Christ does not here dehort from bearing rule, and being a
Magistrate, but from seeking rule and dominion: for I had rather take this
saying of the Lord in this generality, than to restrain it to the Apostles
only: Eo quod omnino pius Magistratus seruiat non dominetur, habeatque per se
omnia secundum praesentem domini cohortationem: Because a godly Magistrate
does altogether serve, and not bear rule, and has by himself all things
agreeable to this present exhortation of the Lord. Thus you see Bucers
judgment upon these words of Christ.

Chap. I. second Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 14. lin. 11.
And it is the common opinion of all writers, that these words of Christ do
not condemn superiority, Lordeship, or any such like authority, but the
ambitious desire of the same, and the tyrannical usage thereof.

T. C. Page 11. Sect. 3. and. 4.
Against this is said, that the places do nothing else but condemn ambitious
desire, and tyrannical usage of authority, and does not bar the ministers
of these things. The Bishop of Salis bury so allegeth this place in his
defe^se of the Apology against M. H^ ding. page 65^


Then belyke all those godly and learned men, which have used these places to
prove that the Pope, which professes himself to be an Ecclesiastical person,
ought not to have the civil sword, nor to usurp unto himself such glorious
pomp, have abused them. For you teach him, how he should answer, that
there is nothing forbidden but ambition and tyranny, and in deed this is the
answer of all the Papists to that objection.

Io. Whitgifte.
Those godly and learned men which have used these places against the Pope,
These places are rightly used against the Pope, notwithstanding this
interpretation.
have rightly used them, and if it had pleased you, you might have understood,
that in the very next leaf following I say: that these places may be aptly
alleged against the pride, tyranny and ambition of the Bishop of Rome, which
seeks tyrannically to rule, and not to profit, but not against the laufull
authority in any state of men. They therefore allege it truly, The Popes
dominion such as Christ here forbids.
and yet you untruly expound it, for the Popes dominion is such, as is in
this place forbidden, that is usurped and tyrannical, because he has not
only entered into the spiritual kingdom of Christ, and sought to reign in
men's consciences, but also pulls from Princes the power of earthly
dominion, saying that he has that immediately from God, and the Emperors and
Princes immediately from him. And so do the learned expound this place, and it
is their answer to the objection of the Anabaptists. I fully agree with my L.
of Salisburie his allegation of this place, for Bishops may not be kings, nor
have any such civil dominion, as the Pope claymeth and usurps.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 14. Sect. 1. and Page 15. Sect. 1. and. 2.
Musculus expounding these places says in this sort: Who so Musculus.
ever will be great among you. etc. He says not, no man ought to be chief
among you, which he should have said, if it had not bin lawful in the kingdom
of God for some to be great and chief, or if it had bin necessary, that all
should have been in all things equal: the Celestial spirits are not equal: the
Stars be not equal: the Apostles themselves were not equal: Peter is
found in many places to have been chief among the rest, which we do not
deny. Therefore this is not Christ's meaning to have none great or chief among
Christians, seeing the very necessity of our state requires that some be
superiors and betters, so far is it from being repugnant to charity. In a
common weal it is necessary that some should excel other, so is it in a
well ordered family: In like manner there must be in the Church governors,
presidentes, rulers, of whom Paul makes mention, To. 12. 1. Co. 12. Heb. 13
as there is also in the body some principal members, some inferior. etc.
Therefore Christ does not require that in his kingdom all should be equal, but
this he does require, that none should desire to be great, or to be thought
and counted chief. Hitherto Musculus.

Which interpretation must needs be true, else we may say that Christ in this
place rejects and disalloweth the Princes and Magistrates of the Gentiles,
and also forbids the same among Christians: which is false and
Anabaptisticall.

Likewise the same Musculus says, that Christ teaches in this place, what he
ought to be indeed that desires to bear rule over other, to wit, that he
ought to be a servant to other, that is (as he does interpret it) to profit
other, and to serve for the commodity of other: for though the name of a
prince and of a Lord be a name of honor and dignity, yet is it the office of
a Prince and Lord to serve those which be under them, in governing of them
carefully, and in providing for their wealth and peace.

T. C. Page. 11. Sect. 5. and. 6.
But Musculus a learned man is of that judgment. This is a simple answer to
oppose one (...) authority against another.
And master Calvin as learned as he, and diverse other are of that judgment
that I have alleged: this is no great proof on your side, nor reproof of
ours: let us therefore see the reasons wherewith this exposition is warra^ted. A
false collectio^ upon master Musculus his words.
Musculus reason is this, that if he should have inent that the Apostles should
have bin equal and none greater than an other, then there should be equality
of all, and none should have authority over other. And so there should be no
degrees of the Prince and subject in the commonwealth, of master and servant in
a family, of people and minister in the Church. But it is no good reason to say
there is, nor ought to be, any inequality amongst the Apostls, therefore there
is none, nor ought to be none at all. Or to say there is no inequality amongst
the pastors, therefore there is no inequality between the pastors and the
people. For as the common wealths, and families, and Churches are preserved by
inequality, and in that some are higher, and some are lower, some rule, and
some obey: so are the same likewise preserved by equality of certain amongst
themselves, as albeit the Ministers may have dominion over the people, but one
of them must not be above another. 1. they may rule but not be ruled.
Consuls in Rome were above other officers, and the people, yet were they
equal between themselves. Examples against himself
And although it be the preservation of the family, that the master should be
above the servant, and the father above the son, yet it tends also to the
quiet of the house, that the servants amongst themselves, and the brethren
amongst themselves, should be equal. And so we grant, that for the
preservation of the Church, it is necessary that there be some should bear
rule, and other should be under their rule, but I deny, that thereof follows
that one minister should bear rule over another. Whereas master Musculus says
that Peter was found in many places chief among the rest, if he mean as
Eusebius cap.. 14. lib. 2. does, which says that he was Eusebius not truly
translated.
(...). or his virtues and gifts he had, one that spoke before the rest, and in
the name of the rest, (which he seems to do in that he does not absolutely
give any chiefly unto him, but only in certain places) I agree with him, and
do not deny, but such chiefly may be amongst the ministers, as shall appear
more at large hereafter.

This interpretation of master Musculus (master Doctor says) must needs be
true, or else Christ should reject Princes and Magistrates, amongst both
Christians and other. I have showed that it does not follow because he
forbids that rule unto the ministers, therefore he forbids it simply and
altogether, no more than the law which forbids that any stranger should be
king of the realm, forbids therefore that there should be no king of the
realm. Whereas you say master Musculus teaches how he ought to rule which
rules, and what he ought to be, I have told you before, other think
otherwise, and therefore you having set down his judgment before, needed not
to have repeated it here again.

Io. Whitgifte.
Not only master Musculus does so expound this place, but also Bucer and sundry
others, both old and new writers: as Chrysostom, Theophilact etc I know that
M. Calvin does otherwise think of it, but that is no sufficient answer to
Musculus his reasons. The first reason of Musculus you collect on this sort:
If Christ should have meant, that the Apostles should have bin equal. etc.
then there should be equality of all: wherein you deal with Musculus, as you
deal with me: that is, you make his arguments against his express words: for
where does Musculus reason in that manner? Musculus his reasons upon the. 20.
of Math.


The first reason of Musculus is this. If Christ had meant that it should not be
lawful in the kingdom of God for some to be great and chief, then would he
have said, no man ought to be great among you, but he said not so, for his
words be, whosoever will be great among you. etc. therefore. etc. And this is a
better reason than you can well answer. If you could have done it, you would
not have shifted it off with a vain confutation, not of Musculus, but of your
own devised argument.

Musculus his second reason is this. There is superiority in the kingdom of
God, and one above another, as there is in the celestial spirits, in the
stars, and in other states. For Peter is found in many places to have bin
chief among the rest, and therefore this is not the meaning of Christ, that
none should be great or chief among Christians.

His third reason may be thus gathered. The very necessity of our state
requires that some should be superiors and betters, as well in the Church, as
in the commonwealth etc. therefore it is not Christ's meaning to have no
superiors. etc.

In like manner does he reason out of the. 12. of the Romans 1. Cor. 12. Heb. 13.
and of the parts and members of man's body: And in the end thus he concludes:
Therefore Christ does not require that in his kingdom all should be equal,
but this he does require, that none should desire to be great. etc. Musculus
his reasons not answered but shifted off by. T. C.


To these reasons you answer not one word, but shift them off by telling us,
that as commonweals and families and Churches are preserved by inequality.
etc. and as albeit the consuls of Room. etc. which be to no purpose, and make
directly against you. For not only in a family the master is above the
seruante, but one servant also above another, Thexamples of. T. C. against
himself Math. 24.
whereunto Christ himself alludeth Mat. 24. when he says, who is a faithful
servant whom his master has made ruler over his household. etc. In like manner
not only the father is above the son, but also in the same family one brother
is above another: and even in the scripture Genesis 49. and other places, it may
be seen that pre-eminence of dignity has bin always (for the most part)
given to the eldest: wherefore Ge. 49. verse. 3.
these similitudes help you not.

And whereas you seem to grant, that the pastor must be superior to the
people, and yet one Pastor not to be above another, the words of Christ rather
import the contrary: for the dominion that is here forbidden, is not of one
minister over another, but over the people of God, as the similitude of them
that sit at the table, and of them that serve does evidently declare: for who
are they that sit at the table to be served, but the people (which is the
Church) in respect of whom the ministers are servants? Therefore this place is
very unfitly alleged, to prove that there should be no superiority between
ministers: for such superiority in government as by your own confession may
be in ministers over the people, may also be in one minister over another, for
any thing that this place has to the contrary.

But whether one minister ought to be above another or no, shall be discussed in
his Tract. 8.
proper place.

What superiority soever M. Musculus gives unto Peter over the rest, that
example is aptly applied to the justifying of his exposition upon this place,
that we have now in hand. But I must tell you that you do not truly translate
the words of Eusebius concerning Peter. For this word (...) signifies not
only to speak before the rest, and in the name of the rest (as you translate
it) but it signifies also principem in omni re gerenda: a chief ruler or
guide, in every matter or business. Wherefore I say still that this
interpretation of M. Musculus must needs be true, and that it may as well be
alleged to take away superiority from Christian Princes, as it may from
ecclesiastical ministers.

This of M. Musculus that he says, that Christ here teaches, what he ought
to be indeed, that bears rule over other, neither have I before rehearsed,
nor you hitherto answered.

Moreover the Greek words that Christ uses in all these places, as (...), and

bear rule, but he says. Quicunque voluerit inter vos magnus fieri. etc. He

Io. Whitgifte.
You ask me why you may not say that this preposition (...) does not signify
here a perverseness The true interpretation of (...) (...).
of rule, but an absoluteness, and a full power and jurisdiction? I answer
that if you should so say, you should say otherwise than the truth is, and
contrary to the judgment of the best interpreters. Erasmus expounding that
place of Matthew, says thus, Nec est simpliciter dominantur sed (...),
dominantur in eas, sieve aduersus eas, frequenter enim ea praepositio in malum
sonat, quod tyranni populi male gerant principalum, neither is it simply they
have dominion, but they have dominion over them, or against them: for that Era.
in annot.
preposition ((...)) does oftentimes sound in evil part, because the Tyrannes
of the people do rule evil. And expounding the other word (...) he says. Et
praepositio similiter in partem malam sonat, iudicans eam protestatem esse
tyrannicam and cum malo parentium esse coniunctam: And the preposition ((...))
likewise sounds in the evil part, declaring that power to be tyrannical,
and joined with the hurt of the subjects. M. Beza in his Bez. in annot.
notes upon the same place, well allows of this interpretation. But this also
(says he) is to be understood (which Erasmus did not let pass) hoc vocabulo
and eo quod proxime sequitur, non quamuis dominationem significari, sed cum
imperiosa quadam acerbitate coniunctam, quam prohibet Paulus Ephesians. 6. etc. that
by this word, and that which next follows, al kind of domination is not
signified, but that which is joined with a certain imperious cruelty, which
Paul forbids. Ephesians. 6. so it is taken. Acts. 19. and. 1. Peter. 5. For
otherwise the faithful ministers of the word of God do exercise an authority,
not at all to be contemned: And therefore also I have interpreted (...),
licentia vtuntur aduersus eas, They use license or unlawful liberty against
them. That place of the. 19. of the Acts, verse. 16. does manifestly declare
the true meaning and signification of this Al5. ias. 15.
word (...), both in this place, and in the. 1. Pet. 5. verse. 3. for there it
is manifest that it signifies a violent kind of dominion.

The place of Saint Luke must be interpreted by these places of Mathewe, and
Mark. It is sufficient that these two Evangelists have these words, and a
manifest declaration how that place of Saint Luke is to be understood.

My words be not as you report them, I do not say in all thr^e Evangelists,
but in all these places, meaning of Mathewe and Mark. This is but a shift to
dally of a matter which you cannot answer, and the untruth returned upon your
self.

When I say that Christ does not say that no man shall be great among them, but
he that does desire to be great. etc. I say as the words be, and as Musculus
himself notes. That place of Luke which you recite is so far from answering
The place of Luke insinuates a (...) among the Apostles.
this, that it does confirm it rather. For in that that Christ there says, he
that is great among you. etc. he insinuates that there must be some great
among them, whom he there teaches how to use himself, as I have before declared
out of M. Bucer, and as Musculus does likewise note. Luke. 22.


Chapter. 1. the. 5. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page. 15. Sect. 5. and. 6.
To conclude, it is manifest, that in Matthew and Mark he reproves the
ambition of the sons of Zebedie, who ambitiously desired the one to sit on
his right hand, the other on his left. And in Luke the ambition of the rest of
the Apostles, who contended among themselves which of them should be greatest.

So that it is plain, that these places suppress ambition and desire of rule,
in all kind of me^: and not superiority, not magistracy, not jurisdiction in
any kind of persons.

T. C. Page. 12. Sect. 1.
Last of all you conclude that our savior Christ in the. 20. of Matthew
reproves the ambition of the sons of Zebedie, and in the. 22. of S. Luke all
the rest of the Apostles. I grant you, he does so, and that could not be done
better, than in telling them, that they desired things not meet for them, and
which would not stand with their calling. And if as you say the ambition
Untruth, for say not, only.
only was reprehended, and the desire of rule to oppress others with, the
answer you attribute to our savior is not so fit, for they might have
replied and said, that he forbad tyrannical rule and oppression of their
inferiors, but they desired that which was a moderate and well ruled
government. And seems it unto you a probable thing that S. Luke means
tyrants and oppressors, when as he says they are called beneficial and
gracious Lords? That is not so
men do not use to call oppressors, liberal or bountiful Lords, neither is
it to be thought of all the Apostles, that they desired rule one over another,
to the end that they would use cruelty, or tyranny, or oppression, one over
another, for that were to do them great injury. Besides that it is said, that
the rest of the disciples disdayned at the two brethren, which they would not
have done, if they had had any purpose or mind to have oppressed them, then
they would have contemned them, rather than have disdayned them, if they had
broken out into such gross faults. For Aristotle teaches that (...) (which
In his rhet^. ad Theod.
is the It is not the same, for one is more general than the other.
same that (...) is, the verb whereof the Evangelist uses) is against those
that are supposed of them that bear the disdain, to be lifted up higher and
into better estate than they are worthy of, which agrees with that
interpretation which I have alleged, and cannot agree with the other, which
you set down. For who (speaking properly) would speak after this forte? The
rest of the Apostles disdayned at the two brethren, or thought them unworthy
that they should bear tyrannical rule over them.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have declared both my authors and their reasons concerning the exposition
of these places, which may satisfye any man that is not wilful. Your reasons to
the contrary, have no ground, but only used, that it may be thought that you
have said something. Beit, that Christ told the sons of Zebede, that they
desired things not meet for them, what is that to the purpose, to prove that
he did not reprove their ambition? as though there may not be ambition both in
desiring that which is unlawful, and that also which is lawful.

I do not say that their ambition only was reprehended (I marvel what you mean
so to falsify my words) for I think also that he reproves the tyrannical
rule of the kings of the Gentiles. But this I with Musculus, Bucer and other
learned men constantly affirm, that he condemns not rule, but violent and
heathenish rule, not superiority or government, but the ambitious and greedy
desire of the same.

If it so displease you that I interpret the Greek words to signify a
tyrannical rule, and a government by oppression, blame Erasmus, Musculus, and
Beza, who so interpret them: nay blame S. Luke who does most evidently in the.
19. of the Act. ver. 16. use Me^ called by titles not deserved.
one of these words in the same signification. Why they were called Liberal and
bountiful, notwithstanding they be tyrants and oppressors, I have before
declar^ (...) desired the commendation of bountifulness and liberality,
though they (...) ^eserue it. It is no strange matter for men of great
authority to be called by such ^tles, as they do not deserve. The Pope is
called sanctissimus, and seru^s seruorum Dei. and yet is he far from doing
any thing by these names signified. Men use to call their rulers and governors
by their accustomed titles, howsoever they deserve them, though it be gracious
or bountiful Lords, when they have no spark of grace or bountifulness. What
rule or superiority soever it was that the Apostles desired, they desired it
ambitiously and out of time, and therefore were justly reproved for their
ambition.

I told you before that Christ in those places condemns not ambition only,
but unlawful gouernmente also, even such as the Gentiles used of whom Christ
in those places speaks. And whereas you say that the rest of the disciples
disdayned the two brethren. etc. you do but spend ink and paper in dallying.
The disciples heard by their request that they desired promotion and preferment
above the rest and therefore they disdayned them: what opinion they had of their
usage in their offices, that is unknown either to you, or to me, because the
scripture has not expressed it: but this I think, that they were as ambitious
in disdaining, as the other were in desiring. Your definition of (...) out of
Aristotle is needelesse (but only that thereby we may know you to be an
Aristotelian) for the Apostles, disdained them, because they desired rule and
dominion, not because they desired to rule well or to rule evil. And surely an
envious person and a disdainful, has not so much respect to the lawfulness
or unlawfulness of the preferment and promotion of him, whom he does envy and
disdain, as he has to the party that is preferred, and to the preferment it
self: as it is not unlike that there are some of you that disdain such as be
in place above you, be they Deanes, Bishops, or Archbyshops, although you say
that their offices be unlawful, and tyrannical. And this vice is too common
among you, for you think some of us to be lifted up higher, and to better
estate, that be not so worthy as yourselues, and hinc illae lachrymae: if I

In that you say (...) and (...) be all one, you are much deceived: for (...)

The Exposition of the place Matthew. 23. Chapter. 2.
Answer to the Admonition Page. 15. Sect. vlt. and. Page. 16. Sect. 1. and. 2.
Touching the place in the. 23. of Matthew. where Christ said unto Rabbi Man
The place of Math. 23. expounded.
his disciples Be not you called Rabbi, call no man father, be not called
masters. Who is so ignorant to think that Christ forbids by these words one
Christian man to call another Lord, master, Father? shall not children call their
parents father? shall not scholars call their teacher master? and shall not
servants call him master, under whose government they are? Is it not lawful
for one to call another master, Doctor, Father, Lord. etc. Paul
(notwithstanding these words of Christ). 1. Cor. 4. calls himself their
father: and. 1. Tim. 2. he calls himself the Doctor of the Gentiles.
Wherefore it is manifest that these names be not here prohibited, much less
the offices: but only the Pharisaical, ambitious, and arrogant affection of
superiority: As it is also manifest by this that follows: whosoever exalts
himself. etc And surely as Christ condemns here the ambitious affection of
such as ambitiously desire these names of superiority, so does he in like
manner condemn those who be so puffed up with pride and arrogancy, that they
contemn and disdain to call men in authority by the titles of their offices.
For pride, contempt, and arrogancy, is as well in refusing to give honor
and reverence, as it is in ambtiouslye desyring the same.

But the chief purpose of Christ in this place is, to teach us not so to
depend upon men, as though it were not lawful to break their decrees, or to
decline from their authority: For there is one only father, Lord, and
master, to whom we are so bound, that by no means we may declyne at any
time from his precepts.

These places therefore may be aptly alleged against the pride, tyranny,
and ambition of the Bishop of Rome, which seeks tyrannically to rule, and
not to profit: but it makes nothing at all against the lawful authority of
any other in any state or condition of men.

T. C. Page. 12. Sect. vlt.
Concerning the exposition and sense of that place I agree with you, and Bylike
it was fondly alleged, when you do but suppose their meaning.
suppose that it is quoted of the authors of the Admonition, rather to note^e
ambition of certain, which gape greedily at these bishoppricks which we
have, to the end they might be saluted by the name of Lords, and honors, than
to prove that one minister should not have dominion over another. And therefore
although these places be against no lawful authority of any estate or
condition of men, yet as they are aptly alleged against the bishop of Rome,
the one against his estate and authority simply, the other against his
tyranny, and evil usage of himself in that authority: so it may be aptly
alleged against any other, which shall fall into the like fault of the
Bishop of Rome.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is manifest that they quote this same place for the self same purpose that
they do the other: there can be no mist so thick, that may darken the eyes of
men from seeing it, except they seeing will not see, as you do at this time,

I am glad that you agree with me in the exposition of this place: surely in so
doing you must also agree with me in the exposition of the other. For as Christ
here does not forbid the names but the arrogant and ambitious desire of them,
so does he not there forbid authority and superiority, but the coveting of
it, and ambitious and inordinate desire of the same. And if you well mark the
words, Christ does here much more plainly forbid these names, then he does
their those offices of superiority.

If any man does imitate the Bishop of Romes ambition, either in office or in
name, he has me as great an enemy, as he has you. But in that you pass
over with silence, these words of mine, these places therefore may be aptly
alleged. etc. you seem either to allow my expositions of the other places
also, or else you are ashamed of your own unfaithful and subtle dealing, which
before would have made your Reader believe, that I had misliked all those godly
and learned men's judgments, which use these places against the Bishop of Rome:
it had bin plain dealing to have set down my words in order, as I have done
yours.

And the third shows an order of correcting secret sins, and private
offenses, and medleth not with those that be open and known to other. Now
therefore consider to what purpose those places be noted in the margent, and how
little they prove that which is concluded.

As for all the rest of the places of scripture that follows, noted in the
margent of this Preface, I know not to what purpose they be alleged, but only
for vain glory, to bleare the eyes of the ignorant Subtilty in quoting places

reforming the Church, then the mark of this heresy reaches unto those,
which made the book of common prayer, An untruth, for I do not say so in

why have they their secret conuenticles? You know all this to be true in a
number of them. I know not why they should do so, except they think them
selves to be contaminated by hearing us preach, or by coming to our Churches,
or by communicating otherwise with us. Which if they do, it argues that they
persuade them selves not only of such an outward perfection, but of such an
inward purity also, that they may as justly for the same be called Puritanes,
as the Nouatians The qualities of Nouatus, and cause of his heresy.
were. You know that the first occasion why Nouatus did separate him self
from the Church, was because he could not obtain the Bishoprike of Rome,
which he ambitiously desired. You know also that his pretense was because the
Bishops did receive those into the Church, which had fallen in the time of
persecution. Afterward he fell into greater and mo absurdities, for commonly
such as once divide them selves from the Church, fall from error to error,
without stay. This Nouatus though he seemed to condemn ambition in all other
men, yet was he most ambitious him self: though he by vehement oaths denied
him self to desire a Bishoprike, yet did he most greedily seek for it: though
he boasted of more perfection in life, and of a more perfect platform of a
Church than he thought others had, yet was it nothing so. He was the first
that I read of, that forseeke his Nouatus the first that forsook his
ministry.
ministry, and that said, Se nolle amplius presbyterum esse, sed alterius
Philosophiae studiosum: that he would no longer be a Minister, but a student
in other Philosophy. Read Eusebius in his sixte book of his Ecclesiastical
history, Cap. 43 and Nicephorus in his sixte book also, and third chapter.
Surely the story of Nouatus is worthy to be noted, because there be so many at
these days, which do not so much differ from him in opinions, as they agree
with him in conditions.

You affirm that I say, The book of common prayer to be a perfect and
absolute rule to govern this Church, wherein nothing is wanting or too little,
nor nothing running over, or too much. If I have said any such thing, quote
the place, that the Reader may consider of it, and know that you speak the
truth. But if I never either spoke, or writ any such thing, then are you a
false witness, and I have to desire the Reader to consider of the rest of
your sclaunderous reports, according to the truth of this. I have learned
with Saint Augustine to give this reverence only to the writers of Canonicali
Scriptures, that I think none of them to have The canonical scriptures are

erred in writing. And I do firmly believe, that only the books of the
Canonical Scripture, are of that absoluteness, and perfection, that nothing
may be taken away from them, nothing added to them. I do not think the
Communion book to be such, but that it may admit alteration. I do not
believe it to be so perfect, but that there may be both added to it, and
taken from it. But this I say, that it is a godly book, without any error
in substance of doctrine, and nothing in it (that I know) against the word of
God: and those imperfections, or rather motes that you say to be in it, not to
be such, that any godly man ought to stir up any contention in the Church
for them, much less to make a schism, and least of all to divide him self
from the Church. This is my opinion of that book, which unless by learning
and good authority I justify, let me have the blame and shame of it. I will
not enter into your hearts, to judge what you think of your inward purity,
(which notwithstanding in comparison you have in this present place arrogated
unto your selves) that very perfection of an outward platform of a Church
which you challenge unto your selves, is one step to Nouatianisme, and well
deserves the name of Catharisme.

Admonition.
Seeing that nothing in this mortal life is more diligently to be sought for,
and carefully to be, looked unto ( 2. Reg. 23. 3. Chro. 17. 2. Chro. 29. 30.
31. Psalm. 132. 2. 3. 4. Mat. 21. 12. Ioh. 2. 15.
) than the restitution of true religion and reformation of Gods Church: it
shall be your parts (dearly beloved) in this present Parliamente assembled,
as much as in you lies to promote the same, and to employe your whole labor
and study, not only in abandoning all Popish remnauntes both in ceremonies
and regimente, but also in bringing in and placing in Gods Church those
things only, which the Lord him self ( Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.
) in his word commands. Because it is not might to take pains in taking
away evil, ( Psalm. 37. 27. Romans 12. 9.
) but also to be occupied in placing good in the stead thereof. Now because
many men see not all things, and the ( 1. Cor. 2. 14
) world in this respect is maruellously blinded, it has been thought good
to profer to your godly consyderations a true platform of a Church reformed,
to the end that it being laid before your eyes, to behold the great
vnlykenesse between it and this our English Church: you may learn, either
with perfect ( Psalm. 31. 6. Psalm. 139. 22.
) hatred to deteste the one, and with singular love to embrace, and careful
endeavor to plant the other: or else to be without excuse before ( John. 15.
21.
) the majesty of our God, who (for the discharge of our conscience, and
manifestation of his truth) has by us revealed unto you at this present,
the sincerity and simplicity of his Gospel. Not that you should either ( 1.
Tim. 3. 8.
) wilfully withstand, or ungraciously tread ( Math. 7. 6.
) the same under yourfeete, for God does not disclose his will to any such end,
but that you should yet now at the length with all your main and might,
endeavor that Christ (whose ( Mat. 11. 3^
) easy yoke and light burden we have of long time cast of from us) might rule
and reign in his Church by the scepter of his word only.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 20. Sect. 1. and. 2.
I Will not answer words, but matter, nor bare affirmations or negations, but
reasons: and therefore in as few words as I can, I will comprehend many lines.

But before I enter into their reasons, I think it not amiss to examine that
assertion which is the chief and The ground of the Admonition.
principal ground (so far as I can gather) of their book, that is, that
those things only are to be placed in the church, which the Lord himself in
his word commands. As though they should say, nothing is to be tolerated
in the Church of Christ, touching either doctrine, order, ceremonies,
discipline, or government, except it be expressed in the word of God. And
therefore the most of their arguments in this book be taken ab authoritate
negative, which by the rules of Logike prove nothing at all.

T. C. Page 13. Sect. 2.
YOu give occasion of suspicion, that your end will be scarce good, which
have made so evil a beginning. For whereas you had gathered out of the
Admonition, that nothing should be placed in the Church, but that God has in
his word commanded, as though the words were not plain mough, you will give
them some light by your exposition. And what is that? you answer that it is as
much as though they would say, nothing is to be tolerated in the Church of
Christ, touching either doctrine, order, ceremonies, discipline, or government,
except it be expressed in the word of God. Is this to interpret? is it all
one to say, But their quarrel is in tollerating, not in placing.
nothing must be placed in the Church, and nothing must be tolerated in the
Church? he has but small judgment, that can not tell, that certain
things may be tolerated, and borne with for a time. Which if they were to be
set in and placed, could not be done without the great fault of them that
should place them. Again, are these of like waighte, except it be commanded
in the word of God, and except it be expressed in the word of God? Many
things are both commanded and forbidden, of which there is no express
mention in the word, which are as A Papisticall assertion.
necessarily to be followed or avoided, as those whereof express mention is
made. Therefore unless your weightes be truer, if I could let it, you should
waighe none of my words. Heerevpon you conclude, that their arguments taken
ab authoritate negative, prove nothing. When the question is of the authority
of a man, in deed it neither holds Untrue.
affirmatively nor negatiuely. For as it is no good argument to say, it is not
true because Aristotle or Plato said it not: so is it not to say, it is true
because they said so. The reason whereof is, because the infirmity of man can
neither attain to the perfection of any thing, whereby he might speak all
things that are to be spoken of it, neither yet be free from error in those
things, which he speaks or gives out, and therefore this argument
neither affirmatively, nor negatiuely compels the heare^: but only induces
him to some lyking or mislyking of that, for which it is brought, and is
rather for an Orator to persuade the simpler sort, than for a disputer to
enforce him that is learned. But for so much as the Lord God, determining to
set before our eyes a perfect form of his Church, is both able to do it,
and has done it, a man may reason both ways necessarily. The Lord has
commanded it should be in his Church: therefore it must. And of the other
side, he has not commanded: therefore it must not be. And it is not hard to
show, that the Prophets have so reasoned negatiuely. As when in the person of
the Lord the Prophet says, whereof I have not spoken, and which never
entered into my heart: and as where he condemns them, Ierem. 7. ver. 31. 32.
Esaias. 30. V. 2
*because they have not asked counsel at the mouth of the Lord.

Io. Whitgifte.
This my interpretation of their words is grounded upon the whole discourse
and drifte of their book, as it may evidently appear to be true to any that
has eyes to see, and ears to hear: and show you if you can any one place
in their book, which does overthrow this my interpretation of their words.
I know it is one thing to say, that nothing must be placed in the Church,
and an other thing to say, that nothing must be tolerated, but I see that
they make no difference between them neither in their writing, nor yet in
their practice. And I think also that there is some difference betwixt these
two manner of speeches, except it be commanded in the word of God, and
except it be expressed in the word of God. For I know sundry things to be
expressed in the word of God, which are not commanded: as Christ his fasting
forty days, and his other miracles, and therefore by that interpretation I
have given unto them a larger scope than they them selves require, which if it
be an injury, it is to my self, and not to them.

But I think you were not well advised, when you said, that many things are
both An unadvised assertion of T. C. tending to Papistrie.
commanded and forbidden, of which there is no express mention in the word
of God, which are as necessarily to be followed or avoided, as those whereof
express mention is made. If you mean that many things are commanded or
forbidden in the word; which are not expressed in the word, in my opinion you
speak contraries: For how can it be commanded or forbidden in the word,
except it be also expressed in the same? If you mean, that many things are
commanded or forbidden to be done, necessary unto salvation, which
notwithstanding are not expressed in the word of God, then I see not how you
differ from that opinion, which is the ground of all Papistrie, that is, that
all things necessary unto salvation are not expressed in the scriptures. How
soever you mean it, it can not be true: for there is nothing necessary to
eternal life, which What is said to be expressed in the Scripture.
is not both commanded and expressed in the Scripture. I count it expressed,
when it is either in manifest words contained in Scripture, or thereof gathered
by necessary collection. If I had to do with a Papist, I could prove this to
be true by the manifest testimonies of the Scripture it self, and also by
sundry other, both ancient and late writers, but because I think it has
but ouerslipped you, and that upon better advise you will reform it, therefore
I will cease to deal further in it, until I understand more of your meaning.

My conclusion touching Arguments negative ab authoritate, (as I understand
it, Arguments ab authoritate negative.
and have expounded it, in the words following) is very true, and must of
necessity be so. You say, that when the question is of the authority of a
man, it holds neither affirmatively, nor negatiuely. Wherein you show your
self not to be so skillful in that, the ignorance whereof you do so often in
your book obiecte unto me: for not in Aristotle An arg^ent ab authoritate
holds affirmatively.
only, lib. 3. Top. and lib. 2. Rhet. ad Theod. but in every half penie
Logike, (as you term them) the place ab authoritate is expressed, and the
arguments taken out of the same, said to hold affirmatively, and not
otherwise: the rule whereof is this, Vnicuique in sua art perito credendum
est. It is a good argument to say, that it is true because 1. Top. Cap. 8.
Aristotle or Plato said it, if it be of any thing pertaining to that Art,
wherein Aristotle or Plato were cunning and expert.

Whether all things pertaining to the outward form of the Church be
particularly expressed, or commanded in the Scripture, or no, is the question
that we have now in controversy: that God could do it, and therefore has
done it, is no good reason, no more than it is for the real presence in the
Sacrament.

Affirmatively the argument is always good of the authority of the Scripture:
as God has there commanded it to be done, therefore it must be done. Or the
Scripture affirms it to be so, Ergo, it is so. But negatiuely it holds not,
except in matters of salvation and damnation, which is not my opinion only,
but the opinion of the best interpreters. Zuinglius in Elencho contra
Catabaptist. reproves them Zuinglius in Elench.
for reasoning on this sort, his words be these: You shall find no way to
escape, for fondly you reason a factis and exemplis negatiuely: yea a non
factis and non exemplis: for what other reason use you than this: we read not
that the Apostles baptized infants, Ergo they are not to be baptized.

The examples that you use in the. 7. of Ierem. verse. 31. 32. and. 30. of
Esaias. ver. 2. The places which T. C. quoteth, prove not his purpose.
to prove that in external and indifferent matters, we may reason negatiuely
of the authority of the Scriptures, are far fetched, and nothing to your
purpose. For that which the Prophet Jeremy speaks of, is a matter of great
importance, even most horrible and cruel sacrifices, wherein they burnte
their sons, and daughters. Iere. 7. ver. 31.
Which they were not only not commanded to do, but expressly forbidden, as
it appears in the. 18. of Leuiti. verse. 21. and the. 20. of Leuiti. verse.
3. and the. 18. of Deutero. verse. 10. Now to reason thus, God has
commanded that you shall not give your children to be offered to Moloche, and
he has not given you any commandment to the contrary, therefore you ought
not to have offered them: is affirmative, not negative: although in this case,
being a matter of substance, and of salvation or damnation (for to kill and
murder is of that nature) a negative argument is very strong. The Prophet Esaias
reproves the Jews for using their Esa. 30. ver. 2.
own advise, seeking help of the Egyptians, in the time of their adversity,
and not of the Lord. Which they did both contrary to their own promise,
and also contrary to the commandment of God, Deutero. 17. verse. 16. But
what is this to prove that we may reason negatiuely of the authority of the
Scriptures, in matters of rites and ceremonies, and other indifferent things?
You accuse me for not alleging of Scriptures, better it were to allege
none, than thus to allege them to no purpose, or rather to abuse them.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 21. Sect. 1. 2. 3.
It is most true, that nothing ought to be tolerated in the Church, as
necessary unto salvation, or as an article of faith, except Wherein the
scripture is sufficient.
it be expressly contained in the word of God, or may manyfestly thereof be
gathered: and therefore we utterly condemn and reiecte Transubstantiation, the
Sacrifice of the Mass, the authority of the Bishop of Rome, worshipping of
Images. etc.

And in this case an argument taken ab authoritate Scripturae negative, is
most strong: As for example. It is not to be found in Scripture, that the
Bishop of Rome ought to be the head of the Church, and therefore it is not
necessary to salvation, to believe that he ought to be the head of the Church.
etc.

It is also true, that nothing in ceremonies, order, discipline, or government
in the Church is to be suffered, being against the word of God: And therefore
we reiecte all ceremonies, wherein there is any opinion to salvation,
worshipping of God, or merit: As creeping to the cross, holy bread,
holywater, holycandle. etc.

T. C. Page 14. Lin. 3.
But you say, that in matters of faith and necessary to salvation it holds,
which things you oppose after, and set against matters of ceremonies, orders,
discipline, and government, As though i^ were enough for you to say ^on such
silly proofs.
as though matters of discipline and kind of government were not matters
necessary to salvation, and of faith. arg. ex solis particularibus.
The case which you put, whither the Bishop of Rome be head of the Church, is a
matter that concerns the government, and the kind of government of the
Church, and the same is a matter that touches faith, and that stands upon
our salvation. Excommunication, and other censures of the Church, which are
forerunners unto excommunication, are matters of discipline, and the same are
also of faith, and of salvation. The sacraments of the Lords Supper, and of
baptism are ceremonies, and are matters of faith, and necessary to salvation.
And therefore you which distinguishe between these, and say, that the former,
that is matters of faith and necessary to salvation may not be tolerated in the
Church, unless they be expressly contained in the word of God or manifestly
gathered: But that this later which are, ceremonies, order, discipline,
government in the Church, may not be received against the word of God, and
consequently received if there be no word against the^, although there be none
for them: you I say distinguishing or dividing after this sort, do prove your
self to be as evil a deuider, as you showed your self before an expounder,
for this is to break in pieces, and not to divide.

Io. Whitgifte.
That matters of ceremonies, discipline, and kind of government be matters
necessary unto salvation is a doctrine strange, and unheard of to me, whereof I
will by and by speak more at large, after I have in a word or two answered
your objections of the Bishop of Rome, and of the sacraments of Baptism, and
the Lords Supper: for you say, The case which I put whither the Bishop of
Rome be head of the Church, is a matter that concerns the government, and the
kind of government of the Church, and the same is a matter that touches
faith, and that stands upon salvation. Whereupon bylike you would conclude,
that matters of government, and kind of government, are matters necessary to
salvation. Surely I put no such case: but I put such an example, to prove that
we may reason ab authoritate scripturae negative, for this is a good argument,
we find it not in Scripture that the Bishop of Rome ought to be the head of
the Church: Ergo, it is not necessary to salvation to believe, that the
Bishop of Rome is the head of the Church: the which thing notwithstanding the
Papists do affirm: for they say thus, Subesse Romano pontifici omni animae
est de necessitate salutis: to be subject to the Bishop of Rome is of
necessity of salvation to all men. Now sir, my reason is framed thus against
them, whatsoever is necessary to salvation is contained in the Scriptures, but
that she Pope should be the head of the Church, is not contained in the
Scriptures: Therefore it is not necessary to salvation. But you reason clean
contrary, for you conclude thus, whether the Pope be the head of the Church
is a matter of government and of the kind of government, but the Papists say
(for that I take to be your meaning) that it is a matter necessary unto
salvation, that the Pope should be the head of the Church: Ergo matters of
government and kind of government are necessary unto salvation. Thus you see
how popishely, with a popish reason you make a very popish conclusion.
Certainly no government is to be brought into the Church that is directly
against the word of God, as the Popes is, which does not only usurp the
office and authority of kings and Princes, but of Christ also, and
commands things contrary to faith, and to the manifest word of God,
wherefore his authority is wicked and damnable, but it does not therefore
follow to make this a general rule, that the government of the Church or
kind of government is necessary to salvation. Do you not know of what force
an argument is ex solis particularibus?

To prove that Ceremonies are necessary to salvation you reason thus: The
Sacraments of the Lords Supper, and of baptism, are ceremonies, and are
matters of faith, and necessary to salvation: Ergo, etc.

Undoubtedly you are as evil a reasoner, as I am either an expounder or
deuider, because the Supper of the Lord, and Baptism be matters of salvation,
therefore are all ceremonies matters of salvation? will you ex solis
particularibus conclude an universal proposition? furthermore you know that
the Supper and Baptism be not only Ceremonies, but also Sacraments,
instituted and commanded by Christ, having promyses of salvation, annexed unto
them: and so have not other ceremonies. And you speak too basely of them, when
you call them ceremonies, not showing how or in what sort they may be so
called. It is the next way to bring the Sacraments into contempt, and it
argues that you have not so reverent an opinion of them, as you ought to have.
Therefore the reader must understand that there be two kinds of Ceremonies,

the one substantial, the other accidental: substantial Ceremonies I call

undone as order requires, and altered according to time, place, person, and
other circumstances, without any opinion of Justification, necessity, or

mentions. 1. Cor. 11. that, men should 1. Cor. 11.
pray bareheaded, and not women, and such like, as I have in my answer to
the Admonition more particularly declared. Such Ceremonies I deny to be

salvation: and in such I say (as you also afterward confess) the Church
has authority to appoint from time to time, as shall be thought expedient,
though the same Ceremonies be not expressed in the word of God: so that my
division holds, and is stronger than you shall be able to ou^erthrowe with
all the force you have.

But now to your Paradox, you say that matters of discipline and kind of
gouernmente, Matters of ye kind of government and discipline are not
necessary to salvation. Two kinds of government of the church.
are matters necessary to salvation, and of faith. And you add that
excommunication and other censures of the Church, which are forerunners unto
excommunication, are matters of discipline, and the same are also of faith and
of salvation. There are two kinds of government in the Church, the one
invisible, the other visible, the one spiritual, the other external. The
invisible and spiritual government of the Church is, when God by his spirit,
gifts, and Ministry of his word does govern it, by ruling in the hearts
and consciences of men, and directing them in all things necessary to
everlasting life: this kind of gouernmente in deed is necessary to
salvation, and it is in the Church of the elect only. The visible and
external government, is that which is executed by man, and consists of
external discipline, and visible Ceremonies practiced in that Church, and
over that Church, that contains in it both good and evil, which is usually
called, the visible Church of Christ, and compared by Christ to a field
wherein both good seeds and tares Math. 13.
were sown: and to a net that gathered of all kind of fyshes. If you mean
this kind of government, then must I ask you this question, whyther your
meaning is, that to have a gouernmente is necessary to salvation, Or to have
some one certain form, and kind of gouernmente, not to be altered in
respect of time, persons, or place? Likewise would I know of you, what you
mean by necessary unto salvation. Whyther you mean such things, without
the which we can not be saved: or such things only as be necessary or
ordinary helps unto salvation: for you know that this word necessary
signifies either that without Diverse signification of the word necessary.
the which a thing can not be, or that, without the which it can not so well
and conveniently be.

But for so much as you afterward make mention of excommunication, and other
censures of the Church, which are forerunners unto excommunication, I take it
that you mean the external government of the Church, and that kind of
government. And yet must I ask you another question, that is, whyther you
mean that this gouernmente, and kind of gouermente is necessary at all
times, or then when the Church is collected together, and in such place where
it may have government. For you know that the Church is sometimes by
persecution so dispersed, that it appears not, as we read Apocal. 6. Nor
has any certain place to remain in, so that it can not have any external
government, or exercise of any discipline. But to be short, I confess that in
a Church collected together in one place, and In what ^specte government is
necessary.
at liberty, government is necessary in the second kind of necessity, but
that any one kind of government is so necessary that without it the Church
can not be saved, or that it may not be altered into some other kind thought
to be more expedient, I utterly deny, and the reasons that move me so to do
be these.

The first is, because I find no one certain and perfitte kind of
gouernmente Reasons why the Church (...) not tied to any one certain kind of
external government.
prescribed or commanded in the Scriptures to the Church of Christ, which no
doubt should have been done, if it had been a matter necessary unto the
salvation of the Church.

Secondly because the essential notes of the Church be these only: The true
preaching of the word of God, and the right administration of the
Sacraments: Only two essential notes of the church.
for (as Master Calvin says in his Book against the Anabaptists) This
honor is meet to be given to the word of God, and to his Sacraments, that
wheresoever we Calvin aduer. Anabap.
see the word of God truly preached, and God according to the same truly
worshypped, and the Sacraments without superstition administered, there we
may without all controversy conclude the Church of God to be: and a little
after, so much we must esteem the word of God, and his Sacraments, that
wheresoever we find them to be, there we may certaynely know the Church of
God to be, although in the common life of men, many faults and errors be
found. The same is the opinion of other godly and learned writers, and the
judgment of the reformed Confess. Heb uetica. cap. 17.
Churches, as appears by their confessions. So that notwythstanding
government or some kind of government may be a part of the Church, touching
the outward form and perfection of it, yet is it not such a part of the
essence and being: but that it may be the Church of Christ without this or
that kind of government, and therefore the kind of gouernmente of the Church
is not necessary unto salvation.

The Church of Corinth when Paul did write unto it, was the Church of Christ,
for so does he call it. 1. Cor. 1. where also he does give unto it, a singular
commendation, and yet it had not at that time when he so commends it, that
kind of government and discipline, that you mean of, that is, excommunication
as appears. 1. Cor. 5.

My third reason is this. If excommunication (which is a kind of government)
be necessary to salvation, then any man may separate him self from every
Church wherein is no excommunication, but no man may separate himself from
every Church wherein is no excommunication, therefore excommunication (which is a
kind of government) is not necessary to salvation. The first proposition is
evident, for no man is bound to remain in that Church where any thing is
wanting, without the which he cannot want of excommunication is no just cause
of separation from any Church.
be saved. As for the second proposition (that is to say) that no man ought
to separate him self from every Church, where excommunication is not,
because it is learnedly proved by such as have written against the
Anabaptists, who both did teach and practice the contrary, it shall be
sufficient to refer you unto them. Master Calvin, in his Book against the
Anabaptists faith thus. Herein is the controversy Calvin aduer. Anabap.
betwixt the Anabaptists and us, that they think there is no Church where
this government (meaning excommunication) is not appointed, or not used and
exercised, as it ought to be, nor that a Christian man there ought to receive
the Supper and under that pretense they separate themselves from the Churches
where the word of God is truly preached. etc. M. Bullinger also in his sixth
book against the Anabaptists says. This the Anabaptists Bull. lib. 6. aduer.
Anabap.
do urge, that there is no true Church acceptable unto God, where there is no
excommunication, the which they use. To these therefore we answer, that the
Church of Corinth was a true Church, and so acknowledged of Paul to be. 1.
Cor. 1. before there was any use of excommunication in it. etc. of the same
judgment is M. Gaulter writing upon Gualter in. 1. Cor. 5.
the first to the Corinth. 5. VVhilest the Anabaptists persuade themselves
that there can be no discipline without excommunication, they trouble the
Churches every where. etc. In the same Chapter he says, that there is no one
certain kind of government or discipline prescribed to ye Churches, but that
the same may be altered as the profit of the Churches shall require. His words
among other be these, Let every Church follow Ibidem.
that manner of discipline, which does most agree, with the people with who^ it
abides, and which seems to be most fit, for the place and time. And let no
man here rashely prescribe unto others, neither let him bind all Churches to
one and the same form. But of this matter I shall have occasion to speak more
hereafter, where it shall appear how far this learned man M. Gualter is,
from allowing that kind of g^uernment now in this state of the Church, the
which T. C. would make us to believe to be so necessary. This have I briefly
set down, not to disalowe discipline or government (for I think it very
convenient in the Church of Christ,) nor yet to reject excommunication, which
also has a necessary use in the government of the Church, but to declare that
this assertion can not stand with the truth, and with learning, that the kind
of government (meaning as I think some one certain kind of external
government) is necessary to salvation.

And it is no small injury which you do unto the word of God, to pin it in
so narrow room, as that it should be able to direct us, but in the principal
points of our Religion, or as though the substance of Religion, or some rude

within your compass. For I dou^t not, but diverse of the fathers of the Greek
Church, which were great patrons of free will, are saved, He that dies in the
opinion of free will, holds not this foundation
holding the foundation of the faith which is Christ. The like might be said
of a number of other, as necessary doctrines as that, wherein men being
misseled, have notwithstanding been saved. Therefore seeing that the point of the
question l^eth chiefly in this distinction, it had been good, that you had

When you say, That it i^no small in^urie that I do unto the word of God to

book with bare words that might well be spared. I gy^e that perfection to the
word of God, which the word it self requires, and all godly learned men

that many things are both commanded and forbydde^ of the which there is no

or avoided, as those whereof express mention is made, which I take to
derogate much from the perfection of the Scriptures, to be mere Papisticall,
and quite contrary to that, that you do pretend. I also confess, that in
all other things we must so be directed by the Scriptures, that we do nothing
contrary to the true sense and meaning of them, no not in external and in the
least matters: neither do I otherwise write, teach, or speak of the
perfec^ion and authority of the Scriptures, than all other leane^ men, and the
reformed Churches, teach, write, and believe: wherefore I pass over your
words and come to your reasons.

If I mean, say you, by matters of faith and necessary to salvation, those
without the which a man can not be saved. etc. I can not but muse what you
mean willingly to pretend ignorance. Is this think you a sound argument:
Diverse of the fathers of the Greek Church, which were great patrons of free
will, are saved, holding the foundation of the faith which is Christ: Ergo The
doctrine of free will is not a doctrine of salvation or damnation? you might as
well say, that many in the popish Church which believed that the Pope was
supreme head of the Church, that the Mass was a sacrifice for the quick and
the dead, and such like points of p^pisticall Religion be saved, Ergo these are
no matters of salvation or damnation. Surely by the same reason al other kind
of sins (almost) The mercy of God infinite.
might be without this compass. But it may please you to understand, that the
mercy of God in his son Jesus Christ is infinite, and that he pardons at
his good will and pleasure, not only misbeliefe proceeding of ignorance, but
wilful erreurs, and sins also, though they be of themselves damnable: he
also alters the mind of man even in a moment, and therefore as his mercyes
be infinite, so be his judgments unsearchable. Wherefore this your reason is
uttered without due consideration. The doctrine of free will because it is an
enimye to the grace of God, must needs be of it self a damnable doctrine, yet
does it not prejudice the mercy of God, nor finally shut out repentance the
gift of God. And full well do you know, that he can not hold ye foundation
of faith (that is Christ) perfectly, which is a mayntayner of free will. But
leauiug the weight of such kind of arguments to the consideration of the
Reader: I come to the purpose. When I say that an argument holds negatiuely
from the authority of the Scripture in matters of faith and necessary to
salvation, my meaning is manifest: which is this, that the Scriptures do
contain all things necessary to be believed, and to salvation: and therefore
whatsoever is taught unto us, as an article of faith and necessary to
salvation, not contained in the scriptures, that same to be false and untrue,
and therefore to be rejected. As for example, the doctrine of fre will, of
Purgatory, of praying for the dead, of praying to Saint^, of the sacrifice of
the Mass, etc. are not contained in the Scriptures, and therefore they be not
doctrines to be believed, nor necessary to salvation, but damnable d^ctrynes
of themselves, and repugnant to salvation. Surely I think in this point that
you neither understand me nor your self: my meaning is plain, that nothing
is necessary to salvation, which is not plainly contained in the Scriptures.

But to the end it may appear, that this speech of yours: does some thing
take up and shrink the arms of the Scripture, which otherwise are so long and
large: I say that the word of God contains the direction of all things
pertaining to the Church, yea of whatsoever things can fall into any part of
man's life. For so Solomon says in the second chapter of the Proverbs. My
son if thou receive my words, and hide my precepts in the. etc. then thou
shall understand justice and The Scripture wrested by T. C.
judgment, and equity, and every good way. S. Paul says that whither we
eat or drink, or 1. Cor. 10.
what soever we do, we must do it to the glory of God. But no man can glorify
God in any thing but by obedience, and there is no obedience, but in respect
of the commandment and word of God: therefore it follows that the word of
God directs a man in all his actions: and that which 1. Tim. 4.
S. Paul said of meats and drinks, that they are sanctified unto us by the
word of God, the same is to be understood of all things else whatsoever we
have the use of. But the place of S. Paul in the. 14. to the Romans is of all
other most clear, where speaking of those things which are called indifferent,
in the end he concludes, that whatsoever is not of faith is sin: but faith
is not but in respect of the word of God, therefore whatsoever is not done by
the word of God, is sin. And if any will say that S. Paul means there, a
full persuasion and (...) that that which he does is well done, I grant it.
But from whence can that spring but from faith, and how can we persuade and
assure ouresclues that we do well, but whereas we have the word o^ God for
our warrant? so that the Apostle by a metonunie, Subjecti pro adiuncto, does
give to understand from whence the assured persuasion does spring, whereupon it
falls out, that for as much as man our actions even civil and private, we
ought to follow the direction of the word of God, in matters of the Church,
and which concern all, there may be nothing done but by the word of Go^. Then

lawful to do what men list, but they are bound to follow the general rules of
the scripture, that are given to be the squire, whereby those should be squared
out.

Io. Whitgifte.
When I say that the scriptures contain all things necessary unto salvation, I
do Now ^ scripture (...) the direction of all things belonging to the life of
man. Page. 15.
not mean that it contains those things only, neither do I deny but that
the word of God, so contains generally the direction of all things
pertaining to the Church, or that (...) fall into any part of man's life, that
nothing ought to be done in the Church, or in the life of man contrary to the
word of God, or not according to the true intent and meaning of the same. Yet
do I deny that the scriptures do express particularly every thing that is
to be done in the Church (which you your self afterward confess) or that it
does set down any one certain form and kind of government of the Church, to
be perpetual for all times, persons, and places, without alteration, as I
shall hereafter more particularly declare.

The place you do allege out of the. 2. chap. of Salomons Proverbs, does not
prove your purpose, for Solomon there teaches the fruits and commodity of
wisdom, and in the person of her, declares what understanding he shall have
in righteousness, judgment, equity, and every good pathe, that harkeneth
unto wisdom, obeys her commandments, and gives his heart to knowledge.
But what is this to prove, that the scripture has expressed every particular
ceremony, or kind of government in the Church? how follows this reason, if
Princes and such as be in authority, receive the words of wisdom, and hide
her commandments within them. etc. they shall understand Pro^er. 2.
righteousness, judgment, and equity, and every good pathe. etc. therefore
the scriptures do express every ceremony, order, discipline or kind of
government that is to be used in the Church? surely except you take heed you
will wander as far out of the way in aleaging the scriptures, as the authors
of the Admonition did in quoting them. I grant you that Princes must give
them selves to the understanding of wisdom, and especially of the wisdom of
God contained in his word, for so shall they understand righteousness,
judgment, and equity, and every good pathe. etc. But what is this to our
question? Magistrates must be directed by the word of God: Ergo they must make
no civil or ecclesiastical law, or order, which is not expressed in the word
of God: I deny this argument. Your other text is written in the. 1. Cor. 10.
VVhither therefore we eat or drink. etc. Whereupon you frame this argument:
whatsoever 1. Cor. 10.
we do, we must do it to the glory of God: but no man can glorisie God in any
thing but by obedience, and there is no obedience, but in respect of the
commandment and word of God. Therefore it follows, that the word of God
directs a man in all his actions: (to omit the undigested form of this
argument, wherein the conclusion agrees not with the (...)) this text is as
far from the purpose as is the other, for what sequel is this, we must do
all to the glory of God, we must obey the commandment and words of God: Ergo
we must do nothing in our whole life, but that which is particularly expressed
in the word of God: Or, therefore the scripture expresses every particular
ceremony, or^er, or kind of government to be used in the Church? You may as
well by this place conclude, that every civil actio^, every private actio^,
every civil kind of government, is expressed in y^ word. For this rule of S.
Paul is general, and pertains to all Christians, of what state, condition or
degree so ever they be. But the true meaning of S. Paul in yt place is, that
we seek ye glory of God in all things, and do nothing that is against his word
and commandment. He glori^ieth God in meat and drink which acknowledges God
to be the giver of them, and then is thankful for them, and uses them
moderately, etc. the like is to be said of all other actions. That which
Saint Paul (you say) said of meats and drinks, that they are sanctified
unto us by the word of God. etc. It is true, but to what purpose do you
allege that 1. Tim. 4.
place? The word of God pronounces all Gods creatures to be good, and the
use of them to be lawful ( for all things are clean to those that be clean)
the same are to Tit. 1. 15.
be desired by us of him, as the author and giver of them, and when we have
them we must be thankful for them: But what is this to the proof of any
thing that we have now in controversy?

But the place of Saint Paul in the. 14. to the Romans (you say) is of all
other most clear. etc. Whereupon you frame this argument, Paul speaking of
things which are called indifferent, says that whatsoever is not of says, is
sin, but faith is not but in respect of the word of God: therefore what
soever is not done by the word of God is sin: still I omit the evil
framing of your arguments: For I respect not the defacing of your skill, but
the grounds of your proofs. That sentence of Saint The place in the. 14.
to the Romans expounded.
Paul is also general, and it is to be extended to all civil actions, as
well as it is to Ecclesiastical, and therefore if it prove that all Civil and
Politic actions and kinds of gouernmente must be particularlye expressed in
the Scrptures: it proves the same in Ecclesiastical matters also: else not.
But the meaning of the Apostle is, that we should do nothing against our
conscience, nothing but that which we do believe not to displease God, not
to be against his word, or commandment. For not to be of Faith, has
diverse significations. First, it signifies that, that is contrary to the
persuasion of the faith and judgment of the conscience: Secondly it
signifies, not to be taken as an article of Faith. If it be taken in the first
signification: Then it is not true that whatsoever can not be proved in the
word of God, is not of faith, for then to take up a straw, to observe many
Civil orders, and to do a number of particular actions, were against faith,
and so deadely sin: because it is not found in the word of God, that we
should do them. The which doctrine must needs bring a great servitude and
bondage to the conscience, restrain or rather utterly overthrow that part of
Christian liberty, which consists in the free use of indifferent things,
neither commanded nor forbidden in the word of God, and throw men headlong
into desperation. For what man is able to show the word of God for all
things he does? If it be taken in the second signification, then it is true,
that that is not of Faith, which can not be proved by the word. For nothing
is to be believed as an article of faith, which cannot be proved by the word
of God. In this. 14. to the Romans, not to be of Faith is taken in the
first signification, that is against the persuasion of the faith and
judgment of the conscience: as though he should say, whatsoever a man
does against his conscience, that is sin. And this to be the true meaning
of this place, the words Romans 14. verse. 22.
going before, do declare, where the Apostle says, Blessed is he that
condemns not himself in the thing which he allows, that is, whose dooyngs
are not against his conscience.

This rule (I say) of Saint Paul, extends as well to Civil actions, as
it does to Ceremonies and orders of the Church, and therefore what you will
conclude of the one, that must you also conclude of the other: But I think
you will not say, that every civil action must be expressed or commanded in
the word of God: wherefore neither can you prove by these words of S. Paul,
that every ceremony, order, or kind of gouernmente in the Church must be
commanded by the word of God.

But what need I labor so much in a matter at the length confessed, The
matter in controversy is by T. C. confessed.
by your self: for you deny that you say, That no Ceremony. etc. may be
in the Church, except the same be expressed in the word of God, but that
in making orders and ceremonies of the Church, it is not lawful to do what
men list. etc.

Hold you here, and we shall soon agree. For neither does that, that I have
hythertoo spoken in this matter, nor that which I intend to speak
hereafter, disagree from this: the which you might have seen, if it it had
pleased you, page. 22. and. 28. of the Answer to the Admonition, and in my
Page 22. sect. 2. Page 28. sect. 2.
whole discourse of that matter. Wherefore if you were constant, and not
contrary unto your self, or at the least not desirous to have showed your
self contrary to that which I have in this point written (though you here
confess it to be true) you might have both eased your self and me of this
labor.

Which rules I will here set down, as those which I would have as well all
orders and ceremonies of the Church framed by, as by the which I will be
content, that all those orders and ceremonies which are now in question,
whether they be good and convenient or no, should be tried and examined by. And
they are those rules, which Saint Paul gave in such cases, as are not
particularly mentioned of in the Scripture. 1. Cor. 10. 1. Cor. 14.


The first, that they offend not any You ad, especially, to the text
especially the Church of God. The second is, (that which you cite also out
of Paul) that all be done in order and comeliness. 1. Cor. 14. Romans 14.
The third, that all be done to edifying. The last, that they be done to the
glory of God.
So that you see that those things which you reckon up of the hour, and time,
and day of prayer, etc. albeit they be not specified in the Scripture, yet they
are not left to any, to order at their pleasure* or so that they be not against
the word of God: but even by and according to the word of God, they must be
established, and those alone to be taken, which do agree best and nearest with
these rules before recited. And so it is brought to pass (which you think a
great absurdity,) that all things in the Church should be appointed,
according to the word of God: whereby it likewise appears, that we deny not
but Here in effect T. C. confesses the matter in question.
certain things are left to the order of the Church, because they are of that
nature, which are varyed by times, places, persons, and other circumstances,
and so could not at once be set down and established for ever: What is
affirmed otherwise* in the answer to the Admonitio^^
and yet so left to the order of the church, as that it do nothing against the
rules aforesaid. But how does this follow, that certain things are left to
the order of the Church, therefore to make a new ministry by making an
Archbishop, to alter the ministry that is appointed, by making a Bishop or
pastor without a Church or flock, to make a Deacon, without appoynting him
his Church whereof he is deacon, and where he might exercise his charge of
providing for the poor, to abrogate clean both name and office of the eldet,
with other more: how I say do these follow that because the Church has power
to order certain things, therefore it has power to do so of these which God
has ordained and established: of the which there is no time, nor place, nor
person, nor any other circumstaunce, which can cause any alteration or change?
which thing shall better appear both in the Discourse of the whole book: and
especially there where you go about to show certain reasons, why there should
be other government now, than was in the time of the Apostles.

Io. Whitgifte.
You set down four rules, which you would have all orders and ceremonies

the Church framed by. etc. The first is. 1. Cor. 10. that they offend not
any, especially the Church of God, which rule I think you take out of these
words of that Chapter, Tales estote, vt nullum praebeatis offendiculum, neque
Iudaeis. etc. be such as you give no offense neither to the Jews, nor to the
Grecians, nor to the Church of God. But truly they make 1. Co. 10. ve. 32.
little or nothing for your purpose, neither yet any other thing contained in
that chapter. For the Apostle there shows how one private man should behave
himself toward an other, yea and toward the Church in things that may be
done, or not The orders of the Church depend not upon every man's liking, or
mislyking.
be done: he prescribes no general rule for the Church to make orders and
appoynte Ceremonies by. For what reason were it that the orders of the Church
should so depend upon one or two men's lyking or misselyking, that she
should be compelled to alter the same, so often as any should therewith be
offended? Which must of necessity come to pass, if this your rule were
general. For what Church is void of some contentious persons, and
quarellers, who^ no order, no reason, no reformation Musculus.
can please? It is true that Musculus says: There be some who^ no church can
please, having always some thing to reprove in other men, and nothing in
themselves. The Anabaptists, the Libertines, the Papists, and other unquiet
minds, and contentious persons are offended with such rites and Ceremonies as
the reformed Churches use: neither is there (as I suppose) any reformed Church
void of some of these kind of persons: shall they therefore by and by alter
the form and state? S. Paul in this place would have no just offense given
to any either faithful or infidel. For Christians ought to be such, at whose
examples, doctrine, and life, no man might justly take any offense. True it
is, that in all orders and Ceremonies the Church must take heed that there be
no just offense given, but she has not to depend upon every private man's
judgment.

Whereas you say, especially the Church of God, you add to the words of the
Apostle, T. C. adds to the text, to make it serve his turn.
for he says not especially: and if you mark his meaning well, you shall
rather find that he would have especial care taken, that there be no offense
given to such as are not yet come to the Church (which some understand by the
Jews and Grecians) least they should still be withdrawn from the Church,
when as there is no such fear to be had of those that be already members of
the same. The second rule of T. C. allowed. The judgment of comeliness and
order, rests not in every private person. The third rule examined.


Your second rule. 1. Cor, 14. is a good and necessary rule, not only
alleged by me, b^t allowed and embraced as most conueniente: but who shall
judge what is most comely and the best order? shall every private man, or
rather such as have the chief care and government of the Church? This is a
rule prescribed by the Apostle to the Church, whereby she must direct her orders
and government, not to every priuato person to pick a quarrel to disquiet the
Church.

The third. 1. Cor. 14. that all be done to edifying. This sentence can not be
applied ge nerally to all things used in the Church, if we truly interpret
the meaning of the Apostle, but to the gift of toungs, to prayers, and to
prophecies, whereof he has made mention before. Neither can I perceive that
any learned Interpreter does take it as a general rule for all rites and
ceremonies, but only for the exercises of Praying, singing of Psalms,
interpreting, and Prophesying. For of things used in the Church, some pertain
to instruction, and some to order and comeliness. For the first he gives
this rule, Letal things be done to edifying. For both the first and the second
he gives this, Omnia decenter. etc. Let all things be done decently and in
order. Although those ceremonies and rites which are appointed by the Church
for order and comeliness, do edify In the treatise of appare tract. 7.
as Ceremonies, that is, not of themselves, but per accidens, accidentally, as
I have in an other place declared It is sufficient if the Governors of the
Church, and such as have authority to ordeyne such rites, do think them to
be profitable in the respect of the time, person, and place: neither must
every private man's judgment in this case be respected, as it is well set
down by the Articles agreed upon by the Dutche Church in London, allowed by
M. Beza, and by diverse other reformed Churches. It is the third article: Quid
porro ad aedificationem faciat. etc. Moreover Theses Ecclesia
Belgio-germanicae. arti. 3.
what is profitable to edifye, and what is not, is not to be determined by the
judgment of the common people, nor of some on man, nor yet by the issue of
men's actions. etc.

I can net understand out of what part of the. 14. to the Romans, your
last The last rule pertains no more to ceremonies tha^ to other actions.
rule is taken, except it be the sixth, seven, or eight verses, out of the
which I would gladly know how you can derive any rule to frame ceremonies
by, rather than all other actions of man whatsoever.

These be your rules to square by, and truly we refuse them not, though some
of them pertain nothing to your purpose. The Dutch Church and the other
Churches in the. 11. of those articles before mentioned, touching commanding
or forbidding indifferent things, determine thus. Qui propter aliam rationem.
etc. They which for any other cause either command or forbid at their
pleasure, the free use of indifferent things, then for one Theses Eccles. Belg.

of these three, that is neither for edifying, nor for policy, nor
ecclesiastical order, and especially those which do rashly judge other men's
consciences in these matters, offend heynonsly against god, and against their
neighbors. Whereby they seem to allow any order taken in indifferent things,
if it tend either to edifying, or policy, or ecclesiastical order. But to
return to your Reply: yt which you speak of hour, time, and day of prayer.
etc. justify my saying: for they be not expressed in the scripture, as you
also now affirm, but left to the ordering (not of every private man) but of the
Church, or such as have the chief care and government of the same, to appoint
as they shall think most convenient and agreeable to the general rules given
in the scripture for that purpose. Neither is this contrary to any thing that
I have written. But both in this and that also which immediately follows, you
are contrary to your self, and directly ad oppositum to the Admonition, T. C.
is contrary to himself and to the Admonition, and agrees with the answer.
As by conference may appear: for these be your own words, Whereby it
likewise appears, that we deny not but certain things are left to the
order of the Church, because they are of that nature which are varyed by
times, places, persons, and other circumstances, and so could not at once be
set down and established for ever. And yet so left to the order of the Church,
as that it do nothing against the rules aforesaid. What does this differ
from these words of mine: It is also true that nothing in Ceremonies, order,
discipline, or gouernmente of the Church is to be suffered against the word of
God? and to this end do all those authorities and places tend, that I have
alleged for this matter. So that either you understand not me, or not your
self, or else your quarrel is against the person, not the cause. The
admonition in this point you defend not: for it says directly, that those
things only are to be placed in Fol. 19.
Gods Church, which the Lord himself in his word commands. And although
peradventure you will shifte this off, by saying that they mean such things
only as be commanded either generally or specially, yet the whole discourse
of their book declares, that their meaning is, that nothing ought to be
placed in the Church which is not specially commanded in the word of God.

But seeing you and I agree in this, that the Church has authority to ordeyn
ceremonies and make Orders, which are not expressed in the word of God, it
remains to be considered wherein we differ: which is (as I think) in this,
that I say, the Church of England has lawfully used her authority, in such
ceremonies and orders, as she has appointed, and now retains, and you deny
the same: so that your controversy is against the Church of England, and the
Ceremonies and orders used therein. And therefore you add and say, but how
does this follow, that certain things are left to the order of the Church,
therefore to make a new ministry. etc. Whereby you give us to understand,
that the things you misselike in this Church, are the office and name of an
Archbishop, which you untruly call a new ministry, (as it is by me declared
in my answer to the Admonition) our ministry, the government of our Church,
and (as you say) other more, that is, all things at your pleasure. But how
justly and truly this is spoken, shall appear in their proper places. In the
mean time it is sufficient to tell you, that you are an unworthy member of
this Church, which so unjustly report of it, so unchristianly slander it,
and so without grounds and sound proofs condemn it. There is nothing by it,
or in it altered, which God has ordained and established, not to be altered.

The Scripture has not prescribed any place or time, wherein or when the
Lords Supper should be celebrated, neither yet in what manner. The Scripture
has not appointed what time, or where the congregation shall meet for common
Prayer, and for the hearing of the word of God, neither yet any discipline for
the correcting of such as shall contemn the same.

The Scripture has not appointed what day in the week, should be most meet
for the Saboth day, whither Saturday, which is the Jews Saboth, or the day now
observed, which was appointed by the Church.

The Scripture has not determined what form is to be used in matrimony, what
words, what prayers, what exhortations.

The Scripture speaks not one word of standing, sitting or kneling at the
Communion, of meeting in Churches, fields, or houses, to hear the word of
God: of preaching in pulpets, chaires, or otherwise: of Baptising in fontes, in
basins, or rivers: openly or privately, at home, or in the Church, every day in
the week, or on the Sabbath day only. And yet no man (as I suppose) is so
simple to think that the Church has no authority to take order in these
matters.

But while you go about to seem to say much, and rake up a great number of

Savior Christ, and so the day wherein the world was renewed: as the Jews Sabbath
was the day wherein the world was finished, and being in all the Churches in the
Apostles times (as it seems) used for the day of the rest and serving of God,
ought or may be changed or no. This one thing I may say, that there was no It

great indgement to make it as arbitrarie and chaungeable, as the hour and the
place of prayer. But where was pour judgment, when you wrote that the
scripture has appointed no discipline nor correction for such as shall contemn
the common prayers, and hearing the word of God? what Church discipline would
you have other than admonitions reprehensions, and if these will not profit
excommunication? and are they not appointed of our Savior Christ Scriptures

has defined of them both.

Io. Whitgifte.
Out of all these things which I say the Scripture has not prescribed or
appointed, T. C. seeks quarrels where none are offered.
you choose to carpe at first, The Lords day, which we call Sunday, and you
say, that you will not dispute whether it ought or may be changed or no: when
as you should rather have proved it, to be appointed by the scriptures (which
no doubt you would have done if you could) for that is it which I deny. Where
have you heard me say, that it may or ought to be altered? if you will
confute, confute that which I have set down and affirm, not that which it
pleases you to imagine.

In good sooth, this is no true dealyng. No marvel it is that you have not
set down my book, seeing you deal thus corruptely with it. I do not
think that The determination of the church ought not lightly to be altered.
that which the Church has once determined, and by long continuance proved
to be necessary, ought to be altered, without great and especial
consideration. I say with Saint Augustine Epist. 118. ad Ianuar. If any thing
be universally observed of the whole Church, not to observe that, or to call
it into question, is mere madness, therefore, Aug. ep. 118.
seeing that it has had such time of continuance, that it was for so good and
just causes appointed, and is so generallye observed of the Church, I do not
think it now arbitrarie, nor to be changed: much less do I make it as
arbitrarie or chaungeable as the place and hour of prayer, which may be
diverse in diverse churches, and it is among those rites and orders that be
diversely observed in diverse places, whereof also August. makes mention in that
Epistle. Surely as there had been little judgment in me, if I had made it
chaungeable, so is there small honesty in you to alter my words, and to
falsify my meaning.

Secondly, you myslike that I should say, The scripture not to have appointed
discipline or correction, for such as shall contemn the common Prayers, and
hearing the word of God. And you ask me where my judgment was? but I have
more cause to deiliaulide of you, where that learning and skill Scriptures
unskillfully alleged by T. C.
is which you so much brag of, seeing that you so unskillfully allege the
Scriptures against their true meaning and sense? For where have you learned
that Christ in the. 18. of Matthew does appointe any general rule for public
offenses, such as negligence, and contempt in frequenting public Prayers, and
hearing of the word of God is? The very words of Christ, If thy brother
trespass agay^st thee etc. do teath Math. 18.
that he means not there of open and known, but of secret and particular
sins. The which thing also the note that is in the margent of the Bible
printed at Geneua, might have taught you, if you had been as well disposed to
have followed the same in this place, as you seem to have done in other
places. M. Calvin in his book against the Anabap. reproving them for using
this place to the establishing of their kind of discipline by excommunication,
says on this sort: They are again deceived, Calvin. aduer. Anabap.
in that they consider not that the Lord speaks in that place of secret
faults: for as for those, which are manifest and give unto the people cause of
offense, they are to be corrected by other means than by secret admonitions.
You must therefore seek for some other place than this, if you will prove that
the Scripture has appointed any discipline and correction for such as shall
contemn the Common Prayers, and hearing of the word.

To prove that there are also civil punishments, and punishments of the body
for contemnyng common prayers, and hearing of the word, appointed by the word
of God, you cite 22. of Exodus. 19. of Deuteronomie etc. But before I come to
the answering of these places, I pray you let me ask of you these questions.

First, whether you would have both Ecclesiastical and civil punishment for
the self same fault?

Secondly, whether you would have negligence or contempt in frequenting of
common prayers and hearing of the word, punished with death or no? for that
punishment is appointed in those places by you alleged.

Last of all, whether you think the Judicial laws to be perpetual, and to
bind the civil Magistrate to the observing of them, and to restrain him from
making any other, The unaptness of the proofs of T. C.
as shall be thought to him most convenient? for except you will have two kinds
of punishments for one and the self same offense: except you will punish with
death such as be negligent in coming to public prayers: to be short, except
you will have the civil Magistrate bound of necessity to practice these
judicial laws of Moses, (which in deed you affirm afterward in your book)
those places make nothing for your purpose. So that you are yet as far to
seek for Scripture, that appoints any certain kind of discipline for these
matters, as ever you were.

But that it may be understood how unreasonably you wring and wrest the
scriptures, so make them serve your turn, I will in one word or two declare
ye meaning of those places, and set open the might of your arguments.

In the. 22. of Exodus the place by you alleged, the punishment of death is
appointed Exodus 22.
for Idolaters, whereupon you would ground this argument. God in the. 22. of
Exodus appoints death as a punishment for Idolaters, Ergo the word of God
appoints a certain kind of punishment for such as be negligent in frequenting
publik prayers, and contemn the hearing of the word. I say there is no
sequel in this argument, unless you will make all those that be negligent in
coming to public prayers, and contemn to hear the word Idolaters, and this
to be a perpetual law.

In the 19. of Deuteronomie there is nothing tending to any such purpose, only
in the Deuteronomy. 19.
latter end of the chapter, there is a punishment appointed for him that
bears false witness, whereupon these words, so thou shall take evil away
from the midst of thee etc. by you here alleged, do follow. Now if you will
thus conclude, God in the. 19. of Deutronomie appoints a punishment for a
false witness: Ergo, the scripture has appointed discipline for such as
neglect to come to public prayers. etc. then indeed you may prove any thing,
and it is but in vain to strine with you. But Lord what gybing and flouting
would there be, if I should bappe^ to fall into so manifest and open absurdities.

In the. 2. Chro. 15. Aza made the same punishmente for Idolatry, that is
mentioned 2* Chro 1^.
in the. 22. of Exo. and therefore the same answer serves that place. Truly I
think you take your self to have free liberty to apply the scriptures at
your pleasure, else would you never thus abuse them without all judgment or
reason.

What I think of the necessity or continuance of these laws, I will declare
in a T. C. triumphs before the victoris.
more special place: In the mean time, you blow the triumph before the
victory: for as yet, you have not proved that the scripture does appoint any
certain kind either of civil punishment or Church discipline for such as
contemn or neglecte the coming to public prayers, and hearing of the word of
God.

You say that there are other punishments for such as neglect the word of God.
etc. but you neither tell us what they be, nor where to find them.

Chapter. 1. the. 7. Division.

I omit that there be examples of Pulpits in Esdras, of chaires in the. 23. of
Math. whereby the chair of Moses our savior Christ meaning the doctrine of
Moses, does also declare the manner which they used in teaching: of sitting at
the Communion (which the Evangelist notes to have bin done of our fauioure
Christ with his disciples) which examples are not to be lightly changed, and
upon many occasions.

Io. Whitgifte.
Examples of Pulpits you say, we find in Esdras. True it is that in the. 8. of
Nehem. we read Esdras stood upon a Pulpit of wood, which he had made for the
preaching, but the same was placed in the open street, neither did Esdras any
thing but read. The other persons with the Levites mentioned verse. 7. of that
Chap. did cause the people to understand the law: that is, made them give
diligent ear to the reading of the law. And although there be words in the. 8.
verse, which (as they be translated) seem to insinuate some kind of
interpretation, yet the meaning is nothing so: for these be the words, Et
apposuerunt intellectum, and intellexerunt scripturam illam, that is (as
learned men do interpret it) aduerterunt animum, they were attentive to the
reading, or Nebem. 8.
as some translate it, Et legerunt in libro legis Dei distinct and apposite ad
intelligendum: and intellexerunt cum legeretur, And they read in the book of
the law of God, distinctly and in such sort, as they might easily understand.
Hereof may I much better gather that reading is preaching, than you can do that
the scripture appoints Pulpits. For though Esdras did so, is it therefore by
and by a rule to be followed? You read not of any of the Apostles that did in
like manner, neither is there any mention made of Pulpits, from the beginning
of the new testament to the end of the same. And this place makes rather for
Pulpits to read in, than for Pulpits to preach in.

It is most certain that by the chair of Moses in that place, is meant the
doctrine of Moses, whether it declare any place or no made for Moses to teach
the people in, that is but coniecturall: neither have we any example expressed
either in Moses himself, or in any other that may resolve that doubt.
Howsoever it is, the matter is not great. For things used in the old Church do
not prescribe any rule to the Church of Christ, unless it can be showed
Christ himself and his Apostles to have used the same.

My meaning is that in the whole scripture, there is neither Pulpit nor chair
prescribed to be used in the Church of Christ, but that and such other like
things left to the disposition of the Church, as shall be thought most
convenient from time to time.

What though Christ sat at his last supper, does it therefore follow that of
necessity we must needs sit? why must we not then as well be bound to receive
the same after supper? I say again that the scripture does no where
prescribe, whither we shall sit, stand, or kneel, at the communion: if it do
prescribe sitting why do some of you use walking, othersome standing, which
both do more differ from sitting than kneeling does.

But this I cannot omit, that you make it an indifferent thing to preach the
word of God in Churches or in houses, that is to say, privately or publicly.
For what better interpretation can I have than of your own words, which says
by and by after, of Baptism, that it is An untruth, for there is no such thing
said.
at the order of the Church, to make it private or public. For if it be in the
power of the Church to order that Baptis^e may be ministered at the house of
every private person, it is also in her power to ordain that the word be
preached also privately. And then where is that which Solomon says that A
place of scripture strange lv applied.
wisdom cries openly and in the streates, and at the corners of the streates
where many ^ieete? and where be the examples of the old Church, which had
besides the Temple at Jerusalem, erected up Sinagogues in every town to hear
the word of God, and minister the circumcision? These places prove that the
word ought to be preached publicly, but not only publicly.
what is become of the commandment of our savior Christ, which willed his
disciples that they should preach openly, and upon the house topps, that which
they hard in the ear of him and secretly? and how do we observe the example of
our savior Christ, who to deliver his doctrine from all suspicion of tumults
and other disorders, said that he preached openly in the temple, and in the
Sinagogues, albeit the same were very dangerous unto him? and the example of
the Apostles that did the sa^ie? for as for the time of persecution, when the
Church dare not, nor it is not meet, that it should show it self to the
enemy, no not then is the word of God nor the sacraments privately preached
or ministered, nor ought to be.

For although they be done in the house of a private man, yet because they are
and ought to be ministered in the presence of the congregation, there is neither
private preaching, nor private baptism. For like as wheresoever the Queens
majesty lies there is the Court, although it be in a gentleman his house, so
wheresoever the Church meets, it is not to be holden private as touching the
prayers, preachings, and sacraments, that shall be there ministered: so that I
deny unto you that the Chnrch has power to ordeyne at her pleasure, whither
preaching or ministering of Sacraments should be private or public, when they
ought not to be, but where the Church is, and the Church This is only said, but
not proved.
ought not to assemble (if it be not letteed by persecution) but in open
places: and when it is driven from them, those places where it gathers
itself together, although they be otherwise private, yet are they for the time
that the Churches do there assemble, and for respect of the word and
sacraments, that are there ministered in the presence of the Church, public
places. And so you see those (whom you charge slanderously with conuiuticles)
are feign to glase up the windows that you open to secret and private
conuenticles.

Io. Whitgifte.
But this you cannot omit, that I make it an indifferent thing to preach the
word of God in Churches or in houses. etc. it is an argument that you lack
good matter, when you make such excursions from the purpose. My words be, that
the scriptures speak not one word of meeting in Churches, fields, or houses
too hear the word of God, of baptising in fonts, in basins, or riuets, openly
or privately, at home or in the Church. etc. If I have said untruly, convince
me with scripture, and show me those places, where these things be determined.
Where do I say that these things be now indifferent? to have the word preached
is not indifferent but necessary, to have it preached in this place or in that
place, in Churches, in fields, or in houses, is indifferent, until such time
as the Church Things indifferent lose the nature of iudifferencie when they
are commanded.
has otherwise determined. So is it likewise in baptism, the sacrament is
necessary, the circumstances of time and place. etc. be committed to the
disposition of the Church, and remain so long indifferent, until the Church
has taken order in them: which being done, then they be no more indifferente.
Do you not know that, whereunto so many Churches reformed, and learned men have
of late subscribed? it is the. 6. assertion. Res alioqui per se mediae, mutant
quodammodo natur^m. etc. Things otherwise Theses eccles. Belgio. art. 6.
indifferente of themselves, after a sort change their nature, when by some
lawful commandment, they are either commanded, or forbidden, because
neither then can be omitted contrary to the commandment, if they are once
commanded, neither done contrary to prohibition if they be prohibited, as it
appears in the ceremonial law. The place is not of the substance either of
the word or of the sacraments: but yet to contemn or willingly to break the
order appointed by the Church in such matters, is sin.

You say that I affirm it to be at the order of the Church, to make baptism
private or public. Surely you do me great injury, and win your self small
credit by this T. C. peruerteth ye words of the Answer
kind of dealing. Is it all one to say, that the scripture has not determined
whether baptism should be ministered openly or privately, at home or in the
Church, and to say, that the Church may make baptism private or public? For
hereby you would give your readers to understand, that I think it in the power
of the Church to appoint that there should be no public baptism, wherein (as I
said) you do me great injury. My words therefore and meaning tend to this
end, that the scripture has not any where expressed when baptism should be
celebrated publicly, when privately: but has left that to the determination
of the Church, to do therein according to the circumstances of time, person.
etc. Neither do I call baptism private in any other Baptism is called pr^ce
in respec^ of the place.
respect than of the place: and therefore my meaning is, that the scripture
has not determined where, or when we should baptize, at home in private
families, or in public and open places, as fields, Churches, etc. For we have
examples in scripture both of baptising in houses, and of baptising in fields.
Act. 8. 9. 10. and. 26. Therefore touching the place, the scripture has not
determined any thing, and in the respect of the place I call it public or
private: although I see nothing in the scripture to the contrary, but upon
necessary occasion, and other circumstances it may be private in the respect
of persons, that be present at the celebrating of baptism: for the number of
standers by or of such as are to be baptized, is not of the substance of the
sacrament, therefore in that also the Church may take order and has therein
to deal.

And as I think, that in such respects baptism may be privately administered,
so The word may be preached privately both in r^pect of the place and persons.
think I also that in the like respects the word may be privately preached.
Neither did the Apostles only preach in the Sinagogues, and in open places,
but in private families and houses also, as it is manifest. Act. 5. Where it is
said that the Apostles did not cease daily to teach and to preach Jesus Christ
in the temple, and house by house. Act. Act. 5.
10. Peter preached in Cornelius his house. and. Acts. 16. Paul preached in
prison. And Act. 10.
not only was the word preached privately in respect of the place* but
sometimes also Act. 6.
in the respect of the persons, as Christ preached to the woman of Samaria
alone. Io 4.
Io. 4. And Philip in the chariot to the Eunuch. Act. 8. Act. 8.


Your scriptures brought in to prove that there may be no private preaching,
are very far fetched, and some of them very straungely applied. That which
Solomon says Proverb. 8. proves that God calls all men by his word and by
his works, to follow that which is good, and fly from that which is evil. And
I think that the meaning of Solomon in that place is that God does offer his
word to all persons, in all places, so that there can be no ignorance
pretended. But I pray you, how does this argument follow, the word of God is
offered to all, and openly proclaimed: Ergo it may not be also privately
taught? all your proofs and examples that follow, be of like effect: they
prove that the word of God ought publicly to be preached, but they do not take
away private exhortations and preachings. It is true that both Christ and his
Apostles taught in Smagogues, so it is true also that they taught in private
families, as I have declared: but yet I say, the scripture has not appointed
any certain place of preaching. For Esdras red the law in the streates, Nehem.

any place? wherefore the aptness of the place, and the conueniencie of it:
likewise Act. 5.
when the word is to be preached publicly, when privately, is left to the
judgment and ordering of the Church. And therefore it is true that I have set
down, that the scripture has not dermined any thing of meeting in Churches,
fields or houses to hear the word of God: or of preaching in Pulpits,
chaires, or otherwise.

There are and may be occasions, even in the time of prosperity, when both
the word may be preached, and the Sacraments administered in private families,
so that they be done according to the order of the Church, and not in the
contempt of common and public assemblies. And I think that such noble men
and gentlemen as upon oceasion either of infirmity of body, or of distance of
place, or some other vrge^t cause, have the word of God preached in their
private families, and the Sacraments ministered according to the order of the
Church, are greatly to be commended. Neither does this open any window, to
secret and schismatic conuenticles, (such I mean as seek corners)
because they will not keep the orders and laws of the Church, but contemn the
same, and conspire in some new and erroneous opinions. In the which number
those be, whom I have truly charged with conuenticles, for they despising the
order of the Church, have wickedly separated themselves from the same, whose
opinions notwithstanding you maintain, although you would seem to condemn
their conuenticles. But it may be that you coumpt this time to be a time of
persecution, and so excuse their doings.

To be short, when I speak either of private preaching or of private
ministering the sacraments, I mean it especially in respect of the place, and
not in the respect of any schismatic separation: so that hitherto you have
said nothing, that impugneth any thing that I have written. Neither have I
spoken any otherwise in all these things, than other learned and godly men have
done, as it is to be seen by all their several authorities, which I have in
their places set down.

I pray you what meant Saint Paul in. 1. Co. 14. after he had prescribed
certain orders unto them to be observed in the Church, thus generally to
conclude, Omnia decenter and ordine fiant. Let all things be done decently and
in order. Does he not there give unto them authority to make orders in the
Church, so that al things be done in order and decently? The best interpreters
do understand this as a general rule given unto the Church to examine her
traditions and constitutions by: And therefore without all doubt their
judgment is, that the Church has authority in external things, to make
orders, and appoint laws not expressed in the word of God, so that this rule
of the Apostle be observed.

at all regarded of these men (as they be not, such is their arrogancy) this
controversy might soon be decided.

For the most ancient fathers and best learned, as Justinius Martyr, Irenaeus,
Tertullian, Cyprian, and other, do expressly declare that even from the
Apostles time, the Church has always had authority in such matters, and has
observed diverse orders and ceremonies, not once mentioned in the word of God.

cause for these matters in controversy, there is no doubt but M. Doctor would
have made them speak. For when he places the greatest strength of his cause
in antiquity, he would not have passed by Justin, Ireneus, Tertullian,
Cyprian, being so ancient, and taken Augustine which was a great time after
them. And if the godly councels could have helped here, it is small wisdom to
take Augustine, and leave them. For I think he might have learned that amongst
the authorities of men, the credit of many be better than of one: and that
this is a general rule, that as the judgment of some notable personage is
looked unto in a matter that is debated, more than theirs of the common sort,
so the judgment of a counsel, where many learned men be gathered together
carries more likelihoode of truth with it, than the judgment of one man,
although it be but a provincial counsel, much more than if it be general,
and therefore you do your cause great injury, if you could allege them, and
do not. This is once to be observed of the reader throughout your whole book,
that you have well provided that you should not be taken in the trip, for
misaledging the scriptures, for that unless it be in More scriptures than you,

call the Papists from their antiquity, councels and fathers to the trial of
the scriptures, which in the controversies which rise amongst ourselves, fly
so far from them, that it wants not much, that they are not banished of your
part, from the deciding of all these controversies.

And if this be a sufficient proof of things to say A better proof, than to
say, I say so, as you commonly use to do.
such a doctor said so, such a council decreede so, there is almost nothing

Here are many words which might well have bin spared, but that you are
desirous Sect. 1.
to have your modest speeches known to the world. In the. 25. page I have told
you where some of these dumb persons speak their parts, but you are blind
when you should see, and deaf when you should hear that which you would not
gladly see or here. I told you there, that Justinius Martyr speaks of this
matter in his second Apology, and in his book of questions, and that
Tertullian speaks of the same in his book de corona militis. It has
pleased you in that which follows to Neither dumb nor speaking persons ca^
please T. C.
reprove me for translating into my book other men's opinions, and authorities,
and here though I have quoted the places where you may find them, yet is it
also your pleasure to spend your gibing and jesting eloquence upon me for not
translating them. Well I will deceive your expectation, and make them speak.
Justinius Martyr in his second Apology says that they used in baptising to call
upon the name of God for such as were baptized, and after baptism to carry
him that was baptized Justin. Apo. 2.
to the place, where the brethren be gathered together, to pray both for
themselves, and for him also that is baptized, and in the end of their prayers
that they salute one another with a kiss. Likewise he there says, that when
they celebrated the Ibidem.
Lords supper, there was used certain prayers, and thankesgyuing to the
which the people said Amen. Also that the Deacons did give to the people the
bread and the cup, and carry them likewise to such as were absent. In his
book of questions, Justin. lib. quae.
he shows how that singing was used in the Church, and commends it, and
that they used not to kneel at prayers on the Sunday, in token of the
resurrection. Diverse other such ceremonies and orders does he recite, used in
his time, not prescribed by the word of God, but appointed by the Church,
whereof some now be abrogated, because they be not so fit for this time, as
they were for that time.

Irenaeus speaks very playnelye in that Epistle which he writ to Irenaeus.
Uictor Bishop of Rome, whereof also Eusebius makes mention lib. 5. cap. 25.
and. 26. In that Epistle he declares the diversity of diverse Churches for the
day of Easter, the time of fasting, and such like: which plainly argues
that the scripture has not determined all things, but left much to the
disposition of the Church.

Tertullian in his book aduersus Praxean. says that the Church then used
tern^ Tertul. Idem.
mersione in baptismo, thirst dipping in baptism. And in his book de corona
militis, although he recite some things which in time grew to be
superstitious, yet does he there plainly declare, what his opinion is in this
matter, he recites diverse customs of the Church then used, whereof there is
no mention in the scriptures: he declares that those which were to be
baptized, must first profess that they renounced the Devil, his pomp, and
his Angels, and that then they were thrice dipped in the water, amplius aliquid
respondentes quam dominus in Euangelio determinauit: answering somewhat more
than the Lord has determined in the gospel. Likewise he shows, that the
sacrament of the supper, which the Lord celebrated at supper, and commanded to
all, was then celebrated in the morning, and ministered only by those that be

si legem expostules scripturarum, nullam inuenies. etc. of these and such like
orders, if thou should require a law out of the scriptures, thou shall find
none, and a little after he adds, Annon putas omni fideli licere concipere and
constituere duntaxat quod Deo congruat, quod disciplinae conducat, quod Saluti
proficiat, dicente domino? Cur autem non and a vobis ipsis quod iustum est
iudicatis? do thou not think that it is lawful for every faithful man, to
conceive and appoynte at the least that which agrees to God, which is
convenient for discipline, which is profitable unto salvation, seeing the Lord
says, why do you not of your selves judge that that is right? And in his book
De virginibus Veland. He has these manifest words. Regula Idem.

scilicet in Deum, vnicum
omnipotentem. etc. Hac lege fidei manente, caetera iam disciplinae and
conuersationis admittunt nouitatem correctionis, operante scilicet and
proficiente vsque in fiuem gratia Dei. There is only one rule of faith, which
alone is immovable, and not to be altered, to wit, to believe in one God the
omnipotent creator of the world and in his son Jesus Christ borne of the
Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, risen the third day from the
dead, received into Heaven, sitting now at the right hand of the father, and
shall come to judge the quick and the dead, by resurrection of the flesh:
this law of faith remaining, the other things of disciplyne, and trade of
life, do admit alteration of amendmente, the grace of GOD woorking and
profiting too the end.

Cyprian Lib. 10. Epist. 12. mentions certain rites about Baptism, no where
spoken of in the Scriptures: and Lib. 4. Epist. 6. he shows it to have been
the manner of the Church then, to receive the Communion every day, which the
Scripture does not command. Cyprian. Idem.


Thus you see that these Doctors be not dumb, but can speak sufficiently in
that matter for the which they are alleged. And least you should cavil
because I say that others also be of the same Judgment, recyting only Saint
Augustyne, I have caused Ambrose, Jerome, and Basil to bear witness in the
same matter. The words of Ambrose be these, After that Churches were appointed
in every place, Ambrose in ^. Ephe.
and offices ordained, the matter began otherwise to be ordered. etc. And
after that he had declared the difference betwixt the Apostolical Church,
and the Church in his time touching Ceremonies and gouernmente he concludes
thus. Therefore
do not the writyngs of the Apostles in all respects agree, with the order
which is now in the Church, because these were written in the first
beginnings. Jerome writing ad Jerome.
Lucinium, and answering his questions touching fasting on the Sabbath day,
and daily receyuyng the Communion, says on this sort, sed ego illud te
breuiter admonendum puto, traditiones ecclesiasticas (presertim quae fidei non
officiant) ita obseruandas, vt a maioribus traditae sunt. Nec aliorum
consuetudinem, aliorum contrario modo subuerti. But this thing I think meet
briefly to admonish thee of, that the Ecclesiastical traditions (namely
such as do not hinder faith) are so to be observed as they are delivered of
our elders, neither is the custom of one to be overthrown with the contrary
custom of others.

Basil in his. 63. Epistle written to the Ministers of Neocaesaria, recyteth
the manners Basil.
and Customs about public prayers and singing of Psalms then used in the
Church, and there plainly declares what his judgment is touching this
question. I omit that which he speaks of this matter in his book de sancto
spiritu, Idem.
where although he gives too much authority to unwritten traditions, yet
does it there appear, that many things were then used in the Church of
Christ, which were not expressed in the word of God. I might here allege
Socrates, who Socrates.
in his sifte Book and. 22. Chapter of his ecclesiastical history handles
this matter at large: and speaking of Easter he says, The Apostle and the
Gospel do in no place lay a bond of servitude upon them, which come to the
preaching, But men them selves have every one, according as they thought
meet, in their countries celebrated of custom the feast of Easter, and other
feasts for the resting from labor, and the remembrance of the healthful
passion. etc. and in the same Chapter: No Religion observes the same rytes,
although it embrace the same doctrine of them, for they do differ among
themselves in rytes, which are of the same faith. And so he proceeds in
declaryng the variety of Ceremonies and other obseruances and rytes in the
Churches, whereby it is manifest that (by his Indgement) many things are
committed to the disposition of the Church, which are not expressed in the
word of God. And that the Church has used this liberty from time to time,
to the same effect speaks Sozome. Lib. 7. Cap. 19. They (he means
Policarpus and Victor) thought Sozome.
it follye, (and not without cause) to be separated one from another for
Ceremonies or Customs, which did agree in the principal points of Religion,
for you can not find the same rytes, and altogether like in all Churches, no
though they do agree together. I might pester this Book (and that you know
well enoughe) with the judgment of all the ancient Fathers, that have any
occasion to speak of this matter, but these may suffice to declare that I
have not vainly used their names, for mutes on the stage.

Touching Councels, I maruayle you will make any doubt of them, whereunto
Councels of things indifferent.
tend the most of their Canons, in matters of Ceremonies, and gouernmente of
the Church, but to teach that the Scriptures have not expressed all things
concerning the same, bnt left them to the order and appointment of the
Church? I pray you where shall you find in the Scripture the. 13. Canon
Ancyrani: Conci. de vicarijs Episcoporum and eorum potestate? or the. 15. non
debere pr^sbyteros Ancyranum.
ecclesiastica iura vendere: and diverse others in the same Council? or the.
11. Canon Council. Nencaes. Nicaenum.
Neocaesari. of the certain age of him that ought to be minister? or the. 1.
Canon Council Nicaeni: of Enuches? the fourth of ordering Bishops? the sixte
of Metropolitans? the seventh of the Bishop of Jerusalem? the twentieth of
standing in the time of Prayer? or the. 7. Canon Council. Gangren or the. 18.
or. 20. or ye. 11. 15. 18. 19. etc. Council. Arelatens. Gangrense. Arelatens.
But what should I trouble the reader with such particular rehearsals, of so
many Councels, which have made such a number of Canons concerning such
matters, as must be ordered in the Church, whereof the Scripture has
particularly determined nothing? is it not therefore manifest that Councels
both general and provincial, by their acts declare, that touching
Cer^monyes, discipline, and government of the Church, many things are left to
the discretion of the Church, which be not expressed in the Scriptures?

And whereas you charge me for not alleging of Scriptures, if I would
Scriptures of things indifferent.
without discretion cite places, nothing pertaining to the purpose, as you
hitherto have done, I could use a number: but I had rather have one text to
my purpose, than a hundred wroong and wrested as yours be. Howebeit, there is
no cause why you should as yet complain, for hitherto I have alleged more
than you have answered. To the. 1. Cor. 14. (as yet unanswered) I may join
that which the 1. Cor. 14. 1. Cor. 11. 2.
Apostle says. 1. Cor. 11. Quemadmodum tradidi vobis instituta tenetis. You
keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. The which words Master
Calvin expoundyng says on this sort, I do not deny but that there were
some traditions of the Apostles Calvin.
not written, but I do not grant them to have been taken as parts of
doctrine, or necessary unto salvation. What then? even such as did pertayne
to order and policy. For we know that every Church has liberty to
ordain and appoint such a form of government, as is apt and profitable for
it, because the Lord therein has prescribed no certainetie. So Paul the
first founder of the Church of Corinthe, did also frame it, with honest and
godly institutions, that all things might there be done decently* and in order.
And that also which is in the end of the Chapter: Other things will I set in
order when I come. Whereupon the same Master 1. Cor. 11. 34. Calvin.
Calvin says, But let such toys pass, seeing that it is certain that Paul
speaks but of external comeliness, the which as it is put in the liberty
of the Church, so it is to be appointed according to the time, places, and
persons.

In deed I glory not in words so much of the Scriptures as yeu dee, but I
trust that I have as sure ground there for any thing that I have affyrmed,
as you have, and much more, else would I be sorye. It is not beasting of the
Scriptures in words, and falsely applying of them, that can carry away the
matter with those that be learned and wise, you know what Master Calvin
says of the Anabaptists in his Book written against them, Quia vero nulla
specie illustriore seduci possunt miseri Calvin aduersus Anabap. Why the
Anabaptists always pretended the word of God.
Christiani. etc. But because the woeful Christians, which with a zeal do
follow God, can not by any other more notable show be seduced, than when the
word of God is pretended: the Anabaptists (against whom we write) have that
evermore in their mouth, and always talk of it. And yet in lawful matters,
not expressed in the Scriptures, I know not to whom we should resort to
know the use and antiquity of them, but to the Councels, stories, and doctors.

The opinion of S. Augustine of things indifferent.
Chap. 3. the first Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 23. Sect. 1.
That notable learned Father Augustine has diverse sayings Augustin^.
touching this matter worthy to be noted. In his Epistle ad Casulanum. 86. he
says thus, In his rebus de quibus nihil certi statuit scriptura diuina, mos
populi Dei, vel instituta maiorum, pro lege tenenda sunt, in those things
wherein the holy Scripture has determined no certainetie, the custom of the
people of God, and the traditions or decrees of our forefathers, are to be
holden for a law. Whereby it is manifest, that those things may be retained
in the Church which are not expressed in the Scripture. In the same Epistle he
reports the answer that Ambrose made unto him, being demanded whether it
were lawful to fast on the Sabbath day, or not to fast, seeing that among
the Churches there was some diversity in this poyut. Quando bic sum, says he,
non ie^uno Idem.
Sabbato, quando Romae sum, ieiuno Sabbato, and ad quamcunque ecclesiam
veneritis, eius morem seruate, si pati scandalum non vultis aut facere. When I
am here, I fast not on the Sabbath, when I am at Rome, I do fast on the
Sabbath, and to what Church so ever you come, keep the custom thereof, if
you will neither suffer offense nor give offense. The whole Epistle is worthy
of reading.

T. C. Page. 17. Sect. 3. 4. 5. 6.
The Answerer goes about to prove, that they came yet out of good earth, and
from good men, which if he had obtained, yet he may well know, that it is no
good argument to prove that they are good. For A true sayings, but not truly
applied.
as the best earth brings forth weeds, so do the best men bring
forthlyes and errors. But let us hear what is brought^, that if this visarde
and show of truth be taken away, all men may perceive, how good occasion we
have to complain, and how just cause there is of reformation. In the first
place of Saint Augustine there is nothing against any thing which we hold, for
that, that the Church may have things not expressed in, the scripture, is not
But it is against that, that nothing should be placed in the Church which God
in his word^ has not commanded: and therefore you do here but shifte of the

against, that it ought to have nothing but that may be warranted by the
scripture. For they may be according to the scripture, and by the Scripture,
which are not by plain ter^es expressed in the Scripture. But against you it*
makes much, and ouerturneth all your buylding in this book. For if in those
things which are not expressed in the Scripture, they are to be observed of the
Church, which are the customs of the people of God, and the decrees of our
forefathers, then how can these things be varyed according to time, place, and
persons, (which you say should be) when as that is to be retained, which the
people of God has used, and the decrees of the forefathers have ordained. And
then also how can we do safelyer, than to follow the Apostles customs and
the Churches in their time, which we are sure are our forefathers, and the
people of God.

Besides that, how can we retain the customs and constitutions of the Papists
in such things, which were neither the people of God nor our forefathers.

I will not enter now to discuss, whether it were well done to fast in all
places, according to the custom of the place. You Untruth, proceeding of
Ignorance.
oppose Ambrose and Augustine: I could oppose Ignatius and Tertullian Tertul.
de cor. milit. Ignat. ad phi. epist. 5.
whereof the one says, it is (nefas) a detestable thing to fast upon the
Lords day, the other that it is to kill the Lord, and this is the
inconvenience that comes of such unlearned kind of reasoning: S. Ambrose
says so and therefore it is true.

And although Ambrose and Augustine, being strangers and private men at Rome,
would have so done, yet it follows not that if they had been Citizens and
ministers there, that they would have done it, and if they had done so to, yet
it follows not but ye they would have spoken against that appoinment of days
and (...) of fasting, whereof Eusebius says that Montanus was the first author.
I speak of ye which they ought to have done, for otherwise I know they both
thought corruptly of fasting (when as the one says) it was remedy or reward
to fast other days, but in Lent, August d^ temp. ser. 62 Amb. 10. li* epist*
not to fast, was sin. And the other asks, what salvation we can obtain
if we blot not our sins by fasting, seeing that the Scripture says, that
fasting and alms does deliver from sin, and therefore calls them new
teachers, that shut out the merit of fasting, which I therefore recyte because
you would seem by Augustine and Ambrose judgments to allow of the wekely and
commanded fastes.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have sufficiently proved that the Scripture has not expressed all things
that may be used in the Church touching ceremonies, order, and such matters,
for that is the question we have now in handling, and for further proof and
confirmation of the same, I do not disdain the authority of any man,
especially of Augustine, a man Augustine delivered from untrue surmises.
(for his excellent learning and sound judgment in most points of Religion)
esteemed of all that have any show of learning, or sparkle of modesty: his
opinicn of the sufficiency of the Scripture in matters of salvation, of the
authority of it in iudgeing matters of controversy is perfect, and sound,
as may be seen Lib. 2. aduersus Cresco. gramma. Lib. ^. contra Maximi: Lib. de
vnitate ecclesiae. Lib. 2 de doct. Christ* Chap. 16. and. 20. Euang. Iohannis.
Epist. 112. and in a number of places else: he speaks also of Ceremonies and
traditions, as moderately, as divinely and as warely as any man does, as it
appears evidently in these places that I have in my answer alleged. And
therefore he is not with such contempt to be rejected, nor yet defaced with
untrue surmises.

That which comes from so good and learned a man is the rather to be
believed, so long as it is not repugnant to the word of God. And although the
best earth brings forth some weeds, yet the good fruit must not for the
weeds sake be refused. This is a very mean reason: good men sometimes err
and be deceived, therefore they must never in any thing be believed.

But to come to the purpose: you say, that this first place of Saint Augustine
is nothing against any thing that you hold. etc. Surely and it makes wholly
for that which I hold: for it proves directly that there be some things
wherein the Scripture has not determined any certainty, but left them to the
disposition of others: for he says In bis rebus de quibus nibil certi statu^
scriptura diuina* etc. and that these things be not such as be repugnant or
against the word of God; but according to the rule of Saint Paul. 1. Cor. 14.
(if you were not of purpose disposed against your own conscience and knowledge
to abuse the reader) you might easily understand by my expressed words,
uttered in this portion of my answer, and in all other places where I have
occasion to speak of the like matters.

I would wish you to deal sineerely: the question that we have now in* The
subtle dealing of T. C. in altering ye state of the controversy.
hand is, Whether the Scripture has expressed all external things touching
the orders, Ceremonies and government of the Church. I prove it has not, both
by the Scripture it self, and by manifest examples, and by the judgment of
the best learned: you not being able to answer, and yet desirous to seem to
say somewhat, to shifte of these examples and authorities, dally at the
matter, and would make your Reader believe that I would have things used in
the Church contrary, or not according to the Scriptures: from the which
opinion I am as far of as you, and a great way farther, except you revoke
some points of your Book. You should therefore now have kept you to the
improuyng of this general proposition: and if hereafter in speaking of
particular matters I had approved any thing against the word of God, you might
have spent* your wit and eloquence in confuting of that.

You say that this place of Saint Augustyne makes much against me. etc. but
you are greatly deceived, for Saint Augustyne in that place does not give a
certain rule to the whole Church, but to particular men, for it is his
answer so Ca^ulanus demaundyng of him Vtrum liceat sabbato ieiunare. A
private man may not take upon him to violate the particular orders of any
particular Church, much less such orders as be observed of the whole
Church, except they be against the Scriptures, for both in this and such
other rules of Augustyne that is generally to be observed which the same
Augustyne, does add in his, 118. Epistle ad Ianuarium: quod neque contra
fidem neque bonos mores iniungitur. etc. And that this Augu. ep. (...).
rule In bis rebus de quibus nihil certi. etc. is given to particular men to
drive them from schisms and contentions in the Church, it is evident by that
which the same Augustyne writes, in the end of that Epistle ad Casulanum,
Wherefore if Idem.
you will willyngly content your self with my counsel (namely which have in
this cause, being by you required and constrained spoken peradventure more than
enough) do not resist your Bishop herein, and follow that which he does,
without any scruple or doubt. Wherefore when Saint Augustyne says Mos populi
Dei, etc. his meaning is that they are to be observed as rules to keep private
and particular men in order, and in quiet obedience to the Church. Although
in deed The Church may not alter any order generally observed, without just
cause.
the Church it self may not without just cause, change. such things as
have been generally observed, not being contra fidem and bonos mores, against
faith and good manners, as the Lords day, the day of the Resurrection,
Ascension, and such like. And there may be just causes, why things once
determined by the Church, should not be changed afterward, though before
the same things were arbitrarye, and might have been otherwise, and in some
other manner decreed as the Church had thought most convenient: If no such
causes be, it may alter any use, Ceremonye, or order, which it has before
determined, as Saint Augustyne him self declares Epist. 118. ad Ianuarium.
His Idem.
enim causis, id est, propter fidem, aut propter mores, vel emendari oportet
quod perperam fiebat, vel institui quod non fiebat. Ipsa quippe mutatio
consuetudinis etiam quae adiuu^t vtilitate, nouitate perturbat. For these
causes, that is to say, for faith and good manners, either that must be
amended which was evil done, or appointed which was not done, for even that
change of Custom, which helps through profitte, does trouble through
novelty.

Now how true this collection of yours is: Augustyne prescribes this rule to
Casulanus, that in those things wherein the Scripture has determined no
cer^aynetie, he should follow the Custom of the people of God, and the
decrees of our forefathers, that is, that he should use himself in those
things* that be not against faith and good manners according to the order of
the Churches where he comes, therefore these Customs upon just cause may
not be altered by the Church, let the learned Reader judge. Ap^nate man (a^ I
said) may not break the lawful and good orders of the Church, though they
be not expressed in the word of God, yet may such: as God has gy^ that
authority unto in his Church, alter and change them as shall be most (...)
even according to this r^le of Augustyne ( bis ^im (...) id est, aut propter
fidem, aut prop^ ^ores, vel emendari oportet quod perpe^m fiebat, vel institui
quod non f^ebat. etc.) before by me recyted.

We must follow such cu^omes of the Apostles and examples, as they have used

and done for us to follow, but such customs or doyngs of the Apostles as
(...) either peculiar unto thems^lues, o^ (...) only for such (...) they (...)
in* we are not compelled to follow. For as in the Scriptures (...) be ^me
precepts general, some only ^rsonall, so are there in the sa^ of examples
and orders, some that for ever are to be observed, and some for a (...) that
there were such customs, and orders among them shall be declared in seue^all
places, as occasion is minis^red.

Whether we have received, or may retain customs. etc. of the Papists or
no, is partly to be discussed where I speak of apparel, and partly in other
places, where more particular occasion is offered to speak of the same: and
therefore I will pass it over until I come to those places. Whyther it were
well done to fast in all places according to the custom of the place or no, is
not the question.

I look to Augustynes meaning and purpose, not to every one of his examples:
howbeit I think that there is a great difference, betwixt the manner of
fasting used then in the Church, and the manner of fasting used now in some
Churches. I think that in Augustynes time a man might have observed this rule
of fasting without any offense to God. But I do not think that he may do so
in like manner now, because it is certain that in the Church of Rome, there
are many wicked opinions, both of differences of meats, times, etc. and also
of merit joined to their fasting, and therefore are contra fidem and bonos
mores, and so not within the compass of this rule, of S. Augustine.

I perceive no repugnancie at all betwixt Ambrose, Augustyne, Ignatius and The
Replyer sets the fathers together by the ears without cause
Tertullian, For the Sabbath day mentioned by Ambrose and Augustyne, is not
the Lords day, which we call the Sundaye, and whereof both Ignatius and
Tertullian speak: but it is the Saturday which is called Sabbatum. And that
this is true, you might have read in the same Epistle of Augustyne to
Casulanus, where he says thus: Whereas you ask of me, whyther it be lawful
to fast on the Sabbath day: I Ibidem.
answer, if it were by no means lawful, truly neither Moses, nor Helias,
nor our Lord him self would have fasted forty days together. But by this
reason it is concluded, that the fast on the Lords day is lawful also:
notwythstandyng, whosoever does think that this day ought to be dedicated
unto fasting, as some do observe the Sabbath fasting, he shall give no small
offense to the Church. And after in the same Epistle: And truly of the
Sabbath day the case is more easy, because the Church of Rome does fast, and
some other also, although but few either of those that be next, or far
from it. But to fast on the Lords day is a great offense, especially since
that detestable heresye of the Manicheis, which is much repugnant to the
Catholic faith, and most manifestly contrary to the Scriptures of God, has
been openly known: which do appoynte unto their hearers this day as lawful
to be fasted, whereby it is come to pass, that the fast on the Lords day is
accounted more horrible. You see therefore how you may be deceived for all
the great reading you would seem to be of: for these fathers agree among them
selves, and you have faulted in opposyng them to Augustyne and Ambrose: so that
for any thing that is yet proved against them, a man may well use their
authority in such matters without that inconvenience that you suppose: for I
know how far they them selves would be believed, and whereunto their
authority extends.

It is like that both Ambrose and Augustine would have done that themselves,
which they moved other men unto, and much more being Citizens, than being
strangers: it is also like that if they had been Ministers there, they would
have in time and place reproved such things as were amiss; for it had been
their duty so to do: yet do I likewise think that they would have had
great respect to that advertisement, that Augustine gave to Casulanus in that
Epistle in these words, vtique cauendis est ne tempestate contentionis,
serenitas charitatis obnubiletur. Verily we must take heed least Ibidem.
in the storm of contention, the fairness of love be darkened.

The errors which Ambrose or Augustine had, must^ not prejudice their
authority in speaking truly. This is but a very simple kind of answering, to
deny the author where be speaks truly, because in some other place he has
erred, and been deceived. I neither allege Ambrose nor Augustine, to allow or
disalow weekly and commanded fastes but to prove the matter that I have in
hand, which is, that the scripture has not expressed all things used in the
Church. Howbeit, I know nothing in this place affirmed either by Ambrose or
Augustine touching fasting, which may not be observed without just offense.

Chapter. 3. the. 2. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 23. Sect. 2.
That which he writes in his Epistle ad Ianuarium. 118 is a most Aug. Ep. 118.
plain declaration of his judgment in this matter: Illa autem quae non
scripta sed tradita custodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum orb obseruantur,
dantur intelligi, vel ab ipsis Apostolis, vel plenarijs concilijs, quorum est
in Ecclesia saluberrima authoritas, commendata atque statuta retineri, sicuti
quod domini passio, and resurrectio, and ascensio in coelum, and aduentus de
coelo spiritus sancti anniuersaria solennitate celebrantur, and si quid aliud
tale occurrerit, quod seruatur ab vniuersa quacunquese diffundit ecclesia.
Those things which be not written, but kept by tradition, which are
observed through the whole world, are to be understood, either to be
delivered unto us, from the Apostles them selves, or else decreed by general
Councels, whose authority is great in the Church, as that we yearly with
solemnity celebrate the passion of the Lord, and his resurrection, his
ascension into heaven, and the coming of the holy Ghost, and if there be any
other thing that is observed of the whole Church.

T. C. Page 18. Lin. 1. and Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4.
What you mean to cite this place ad Ianuarium. 118. I can not tell. You
charge the authors of the Admonition to be conspired with the Papists: I will
not charge you so, but will think better of you, until the contrary do more
appear.

But I appeal to the judgment of all men, if this be not Nor one whit, but
the contrary shall be proved.
to bring in popery again, to allow of S. Augustines saying, wherein he
says, that the celebrating of the day of the passion. etc. is either of some
general Council, or of the Apostles commanded and decreed: whereby a gate is
open unto the Papists, to bring in, under the color of traditions, all their
beggerie whatsoever. For you plainly confirm, that there is some thing
necessary to be observed, which is not contained any ways in the Scripture.
For to keep those holidays, is not contained in the Scripture, neither can be
concluded of any part thereof, and yet they are necessary to be kept, if
they be commanded of the Apostles. Therefore in your opinion, some thing is
necessary to be kept, which is not contained in the Scriptures, nor can not
be concluded of them. And if you say, that S. Augustine leaves it in doubt,
whether it were the Apostles tradition and statute, or a general Councels,
then you bring us yet to a worse point, that we can not be assured of that
which is necessary for us to know, that is, whether the Apostles did ordain
that these days should be kept, as holidays, or the Councels. And that it
is S. Augustines meaning to father Sermo. 7. de baptis. cont. Donatist. lib. 5.
ca. 23.
such like things of Apostles, it may appear by that which he writes,
saying: There are many things which the whole Church holds, and therefore
are well believed to be commanded of the Apostles, although they be not
found written. A pretty and sound collecti^.
If this judgment of S. Augustine be a good judgment, and a sound, then
there be some things commanded of God, which are not in the scriptures, and
therefore there is no sufficient doctrine contained in the scriptures, whereby
we may be saved. A great untruth and absurdity.
For all the commandments of God, and of the Apostles, are needful for our
salvation.

And Nay, mark how your affections move yo^ to speak untruly.
mark I pray you, whither your affections carry you: before you said, that
the Lords day, which was used for the day of rest in the Apostles time, may
be changed, as the place and hour of prayer, and the day of the passion and
resurrection. etc. you either thrust upon us as the decree of the Apostles, or
at least put upon us a necessity of keeping of them, least happily in breaking
of them, we might break the Apostles decree, for you make it to lie between
the Councels and the Apostles, which of them decreed this.

And do you not perceive how you still reason against your self? For if the
Church have had so great regard to that which the Apostles did in the^ ^es,
that they kept those things which are not written, and therefore are doubtful
whether ever they used them or no, how much ^ore should we hold our selves
to these things which are written that they did, and of the which we are
assured?

As touching the observation of these holidays, I will refer the Reader unto
an other place, where occasion is given again to speak of them.

Io. Whitgifte,
My meaning therein I have set down in my answer. It is to let you
understand The rule of S. Augustine does not establishe, but overthrow p^perie.
S. Augustines judgment in the matter we have in hand. The rule is true and
good, and so far from establishing any piece of Popery, that if rather quite
overthrows the same.

By it we may prove the supremacy which the Bishop of Rome claymeth over all
Churches, neither to be written in the word, nor yet to be appointed by the
Apostles, nor yet determined by ancient general Councels: for neither has he
bin always, nor in all places taken to be the head of the Church. And it is
manifest that Phocas the traitor and murderer, gave first unto him and his
Church that prerogative, and therefore not left unto him by the Apostles, nor
given him by the general Councels. The like may be said of all other things
used in the Church against the word of God. For it is certain, that they
have not been generally observed in all places, and at all times: and if some
of them have been so observed, yet not in that manner and form, that the
Church of Rome does now observe them. So that you find fault with this
rule, before you have cause. Master Zuinglius (who would have been loathe one
whit to strengthen the Papists) speaking of the like place of S. Augustine, in
his book de baptismo, says thus: But leaving those things, Zuingl. de
baptis. of the rule of Aug.
let us return to the words of Augustine, who among other things adds
this: Quanquam quod vniuersa tenet ecclesia nec concitijs institutum, sed
semper retentum est, non nisi authoritate Apostolica traditum rectissime
creditur. etc. Let these words (says he) prevail with other me^ as they may,
yet no man can deny, but that there lies great weight of authority in them.
For if there be nothing in Councels concluded of the baptising of Infants: and
yet the same was universally of the whole Church observed in Angustines time,
what other thing can be gathered, but that it has always been used without
contradiction. Master Calvin also Lib. Insti. Cap. 13. Sect. 21. uses this
rule of Augustine to the same purpose, where he speaking of Popish traditions,
for the which they abuse the authority of Augustine, says thus: Ego vero
non aliunde quam ex ipsius Augustini verbis solutionem afferam. Quae toto
inquit terrarum orb seruantur, vel ab ipsis Apostolis, vel concilijs
generalibus, quorum est in ecclesia saluberrima^ authoritas, statuta esse
intelligere licet. Verily I will fetch a solution from no other place, than
from the very words of Augustine. Those things (says he) which are observed
throughout the whole world, are understood to have bin instituted, either of
the Apostles themselves, or of general Councels. etc. As it is in the answer
to the Admonition.

I know no reason why the Apostles may not be said to be the authors of
celebrating the day of the Passion. etc. Neither yet do I under stand any
cause why the Church may not still observe the same: sure I am, that they
were not the authors of the superstitions and errors used in them by the
Papists, neither does Augustine say so: for this is no good argument to
say, the Apostles appointed these days to be celebrated: Ergo, they appointed
the manner of celebrating used by the Papists. The days may be with more
godliness, and profit to the Church observed (being cleansed from super
stition and erroneous doctrine) than abrogated. Neither is this to open a gate
to Papisticall traditions, but to shut it close up, as I have said before.
For let the Papists (if they can) name any wicked thing used in their
Church, which either bathe been generally observed, or whereof I am not able
to show the first author and inuentor.

Neither Aug^in this place, nor I in any place have said, or con^ it (...)
thing not co^ntayned in the Scripture, to be so necessary to be observed,
that (upon inst consideration) it may not be. altered by such as have
authority. And (...) ^all that you do say, have said, or shall say (...) that
effect, is forged, and untrue, devised only by you as a shifte to fly unto,
when otherwise you are to seek for answer.

To these your words, they are necessary to be kept, if they be commanded by
the Apostles* (meaning such things as Augustine speaks of) I answer with
master Calvin, who as I told you before, writing upon these words. 1. Cor11:
Quemadmodum tradidi vobis, etc. does grant that there were some traditions of
the Apostles not written, but he denies them to be taken aspartes of doctrine,
o^ necessary to salvation, saying, that they be only such as pertayne to
order and policy.

The rest of this section of yours is nothing but: Petitio Principij. For
neither do I move any such doubt in Augustines words, neither, is it material
whether I do, or no: nether yet is it true that there is any thing commanded
of. God, or of the Apostles, as necessary to salvation, which is not
contained in the word of God: neither are these and such like traditions
parts of doctrine, and of salvation (as M. Calvin truly says) but of order
and policy.

Who would think that any man (except he had hardened his face, without A
gross error of T. C.
blushing to affirm untruths) would have fallen into such gross
absurdities, and uttered such strange assertions void of all truth. Have
you ever read in Scripture, or in the writings of any learned man, or can you
by reason prove this Paradox, that all the commandments of God and of the
Apostles are needful for our salvation?

What is to lay an intolerable yoke and burden upon the necks of men, if
this be not? or whereby could you more directly bring us into the bondage of
the law, from the which we are made free, than by this assertion? for if all
the commandments Gal. 5.
of God. etc. are needful for our salvation, then must we be bound upon
necessity of salvation, to observe the whole Ceremonial law, which was the
commandment of God. What? was the commandment unto Abraham, to offer his
son Isahac: Genes. 22.
unto the Israelites to rob the Egyptians: unto Moses to put off his shoes:
unto Exodus 11.
Saul to kill Amalech, and infinite other, needful for our salvation? is the
commandment Exodus 3.
of the Apostles to abstain from blood, and that which is strangled: or of 1 Samuel 15.
Paul unto Timothy, to drink wine. etc. needful for our salvation? What a
torment Act. 15.
is this doctrine able to bring unto a weak conscience, which has not
observed 1. Tim. 5.
any one of these? You must therefore understand, that there are diverse
kinds of commandments of God, and of the Apostles, some general, and given
to all: other Diuerskinds of commandments.
personal, and pertayne only to one singular person, or to one nation and
kind of people. etc. Again there are some which are perpetual, and not to be
omitted or altered: other which are temporal, and may be omitted or altered,
as the circumstance of time, place, and persons does require. Whereby it may
appear, how grossly you have erred, in affirming, that all the
commandments of God, and of the Apostles, are needful for our salvation. I
might in more ample manner prosecute this matter, but this that has bin spoken
may suffice.

What I have said of changing the Lords day, and how you have satisfied my
words, is declared before: and so is the answer made likewise unto this your
feeble conclusion, grounded upon a falie principle.

Which of us two is carried furthest by his affections, let the indifferent
reader judge, by these and such other like dealings of yours.

I have told you before how much this and the other places of S. Augustine
makes for my purpose, which you can not but understand, if you sought not
corners to creep into, for the avoiding of such reasons and authorities as be
most apt for my purpose.

Things which the Apostles have done, for us to follow, without any exception
may not be violated, but the question is, whether these things which they have
done and written, be sufficient for the ordering and government of all
Churches, in all times and states, or no. And whether in all things that they
have done, we may or ought to follow them, both which you have hitherto very
slenderly touched.

And again, Quod neque contra fidem, neque contra bonos mores iniungitur,
indifferenter est habendum, and pro eorum inter quos viuitur societate
seruandum est, That which is enjoined, being neither against faith, nor good
manners, is to be counted indifferent, and to be observed, as the society of
those with whom we line requiteth.

In the same Epistle answering this question (whether upon the Thursday before
Easter, the Lords supper should be celebrated in the morning, or at night,
because Christ did institute this Sacrament, and deliver the same to his
Disciples after supper, he gives these three rules worthy to be noted, the
first is this: If the holy Scripture prescribe any thing to be done, there is
no doubt but that must be observed, as it is there prescribed. The second is
this: That if any thing be universally observed of the whole Church (not
repugnant to the Scriptures) (for so he means) not to keep that, or to
reason of that is madness. The third: If it be not universally observed, but
diversely in diverse Churches: Faciat quisque quod in ea ecclesia in qua^ venit
inuenerit: Let every man do as he finds in that Church into the which he
comes, modonon sit contra fidem aut contra mores, So that it be not against
faith or good manners, for so he adds.

In the same Epistle again he says, that the Lord has not in Scripture
declared in what order and manner his Supper should be celebrated, but left
that to his Disciples. And in his hundredth and nintenth ad Ianuar. In those
things (says he) that be diversely observed in diverse places, this rule as
most profitable is to be kept, that those things which be not against
faith, neither good manners, and make something to exhort unto a better life,
wheresoever they are instituted, we ought not only not to disallovve them,
but to praise them, and to follovv them. By all these places of this learned
father it is evident, that it has been received from time to time as a
certain truth, that the Church of Christ has authority to ordain and
constitute, as shall be necessary, in those things before of me rehearsed.

For a further proof hereof, I could allege that ancient and learned
father Justinius Martyr, in his second Apology pro Justinius Martyr.
Christianis, and in his book of questions. Tertullian in his book Decorona
militis. Basil also in his. 63. Epistle written to the ministers of
Neocaesaria. Tertul.
Eusebius Lib. 5. Ecclesiasti. histor. Cap. 25. and. 26. and diverse other, but
I omit Basil.
them for brevity sake, neither do I allege those learned fathers, Eusebius.
because I think their authority any thing at all preuayleth with the authors
of the Libell, but for the wise, discrete, humble, and learned, whose humility
and wisdom will not suffer them to despise the judgments of so learned and
godly fathers.

T. C. Page 18. Sect. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. and Page 19. Sect. 1.
As for that rule that he gives when he say the, what so ever is not. etc. and
for the last of the three rules, I receive them with his own interpretation,
which he has afterward in 119. Epist. ad Ianuarium, which is, that it be
also profitable.

And as for those three rules, which you say, are worthy to be noted, I can see
nothing, that they help your cause one whitte, for I know no man that ever
denied, but that the Church may in such things as are not specified and
precisely determined, make orders, so they be grounded of those general rules
which I have before alleged out of S. Paul.

And as for the second of the three rules, I can not at any hand allow it,
for when all Christianity was ouerrunne with popery, things were universally
observed, which to keep were mere wickedness, and this strengthens the
Papists universality.

Concerning your Gloss (if it be not repugnant to the scripture) besides that
it is not enough, because it must be grounded by the Scripture, and that it is
wicked to give such authority to any decree of men, that a man should not
enquire of it, or reason of it, I have showed that he mente nothing less. For
affirming that such things are the Apostles commandments, his meaning was,
that they should be without all exception received, and absolutely. (...)
much better is it that we take heed to the words of the Apostle, than either
to S. Augustines or yours, which says, that if he, or an Angel from heaven,
should preach any other M Doctor speaks not of preaching another Gospel,
but of appoynting other rites and orders
Gospel, than that which he had preached, that they should hold him
accursed: he says not any contrary or repugnant doctrine, but any other
Gospel.

But tell me, why Because it nothing pertains to my purpose. S. Aug. mangled
and not truly reported.
passed you by that in Augustine which he writes to January likewise, that
those things which are not contained in the Scripture, nor decreed of
Councels, nor confirmed by general customs, but are varied by the manners of
Regions, and of men, upon occasion offered, ought to be cut off, although
they seem not to be against faith, because they press with seru^e burdens,
the religion which Christ would have free. This sentence belyke was to hot
for you, you could not carry it. Therest whose names you recite (which you say
you leave off for brevity sake) I leave to the judgment of the Reader to
consider, wherefore they be left out, seeing that Augustine, in whom you put
so great trust, answers so little to your expectation. This is certain, that
bre^tie (which you pretend) was in small commendations with you, Words of
pleasure.
which make so often repetitions, stuff in diverse sentences of doctors and
writers, to prove things that no man denies, translate whole leaves to so
small purpose, Tu^pe est doctori. etc.
upon so light occasions make so often digressions, sometimes against the
vnlearnednesse, sometimes against the malice, sometimes against the
intemperancie of speech of the authors of the Admonition, and every hand
while pulling out the sword upon them, and throughout the whole book
sporting your self with the quotations in the margent: so that if all these
were taken out of your book, as wind out of a bladder, we should have had
it in a narrow room, which is thus swelled into such a volume, and in
stead of a book of two shillings, we should have had a pamflet of two pence.

And whereas you say, that you have not alleged these learned fathers for the
authors of the Libell, but for the wise, discrete, humble, and learned: to them
also I leave it to consider, upon that which is alleged by me. First, how
like a divine it is, to seek for rules in the Doctors, to measure the making
of ceremonies by, which you might have had in the Scriptures: there at the
rivers, here at the fountain: uncertain there, which here are certain,
there ^parte false, which are here altogether true: then to how little
purpose they serve you, and last of all, how they make against you.

Io. Whitgifte.
I take that which you grant: both the first rule, which is, Quod neque
contra fidem. etc. and the last of the three, with what interpretation soever
you admit them, serve my turn very well, and fully prove my present purpose.
Wherefore in granting of them, you have granted as much to me as hitherto I
have desired. Of the rules out of S. Paul, I have spoken before: so have I
likewise of the ends which the Church must have a respect unto in her
decrees of orders, ceremonies, and government, whereof also I shall have
occasion to speak hereafter.

The second of the three rules you can not at any hand allow, but there is
no cause why you should mislike it. For Augustine did give it as a rule meet
for his time, not for all times, although it may serve also for all times, if
his meaning be joined with it, that is, If that which is universally observed
of the whole Church, be not repugnant to the word of God, and so it
strengthens not one whit the Papists pretended universality.

In mattrrs of order, ceremonies, and government, it is sufficient if they be
not repugnant to the scripture. Neither do I think any great difference to be
betwixt not repugnant to the word of God, and according to the word.

That which is generally observed, and of that kind that the rule means, is
Decrees that perteyne to order and comeliness, are not only humane.
not only man's tradition and decree, but Gods also. M. Calvin teaches you in
his Institutions, Cap. 13. Sect. 31. that such kind of decrees, as pertayne
to order and comeliness, are not only humane, but divine. And he brings in
for an example kneeling at public prayers.

S. Augustines meaning is, that he would have no factions or contentions in the
Church, or any man to trouble the peace thereof, by setting him self against
lawful orders and customs of the same: otherwise I think that he neither
forbids to enquire, or reason of any such matter. But you think that
Augustine was so adicted to such decrees of the Apostles, that his meaning was
to have them received without all exception. Surely I think that he was so
persuaded in deed of such decrees, as he means and speaks of in that
place. But for as much as in such rules he has sundry times made such
exceptions, Quod neque contra fidem. etc. therefore this rule also is to be
received of us, according to his meaning in all such like rules.

God forbid that I should not take heed to those words of the Apostle, and
hold him accursed which shall preach any other Gospel, than that which he had
preached. For I take him that preaches any other Gospel, to preach contrary
and repugnant doctrine to the Apostle: and undoubtedly he that teaches any
thing to be necessary to salvation, which is not comprehended in the scripture,
teaches a false doctrine, and clean contrary to the doctrine of the
Scripture. But you do not use this place (I am sure) against any thing that is
here said. Our question is not of matters pertaining to salvation, but of
ceremonies, of external orders, and discipline. Whereof S. Paul speaks
nothing in that place. I make them not matters of salvation, neither are they.

I will tell you why I passed by that which S. Augustine writes to January,
Epist. 119. and is now recited by you, because it nothing pertayneth to my
purpose, and yet it is rather with me, than against me.

But let me now ask you an other question, why do you not truly report S.
Augustines S. Augustine mangled and untruly reported by T. C.
words, but mayme them both before, behind, and in the midst, for Augustine
in the words that immediately go before, says: That he was much grieved,
because that many things which were more profitably commanded in the word of
God were neglected, by reason of so many presumptuous observations of outward
ceremonies: the omitting whereof was more grievously punished, than the
breaking of Gods commandments. And upon this occasion he concludes thus:
Omnia itaque talia quae neque sanctorum. etc. All such ceremonies ( scilicet,
as be impediments to the observing of the commandment of God, and are
preferred before Gods commandments) being neither contained in the holy
Scriptures, nor found decreed in the Councels of Bishops, nor confirmed by the
custom of the whole Church, but are varied innumerably by the diverse manners of
diverse Regions: so that scarcely, or never the causes can be found out, which
men followed in appoynting of them: when occasion is offered I think they
ought to he cut off without any doubt. Hitherto Augustine.

Therefore in reciting the words of S. Augustine in this place, first you have
omitted the words going before, that express his mind, and declare that he
means such ceremonies as be impedimentes to the observing of Gods
commandments: for having spoken of such before in manifest words, he
concludes (as I have said) on this sort, Omnia itaque talia. etc. All such
ceremonies. etc. which words you have fraudulently kept back.

Secondly, where S. Augustine speaks of the unreasonable multitude of
ceremonies, using these words: innumerabiliter variantur, are varied
innumerably, you have likwyse left out this word, innumerably, which also
expresses Augustines meaning.

Last of all you have concealed a sentence in the midst, which is very
material to the declaring of Augustine his mind. The sentence is this: Ita vt
vix aut omnino nunquam inueniri possint causae, quas in eis instituendis
homines secuti sunt: So that scarcely or never the causes can be found out,
which men followed in appoynting of them. Whereby it is plain, that he also
means such ceremonies as be appointed without reason or cause. And yet in
the latter end he adds: But the Church of God being placed betwixt much
chafe and darnell, does tolerate many things. etc. But I am so far from
defending the multitude, or burdensomnesse of ceremonies, that I consent in all
points with that saying of Augustine, wherefore this sentence is nothing to
hot for me, but pleases me right well: And it had bin more for your
commendation if you had not meddled withal.

They whose names I here recite (though I have not written their words) yet
in the places which I have qnoted do affirm as much as I recite them for,
which you might have found, if you had taken pains to search for the same,
as I think verily you have done, and found little for your purpose, and
therefore are content to pass them over in silence.

If I make so often repetitinons, I do but as I am occasioned by them whom I
answer, and as you do your self in this Reply, though it pleases you not to
be acknowne of it. The sentences of Doctors and writers that I stuff in, argue
that I have red them, and that I am not ashamed to lay them open, to the end
my plain dealing may be seen, in alleging of them. But what? did you before
find fault with my Dumb doctors, and can you not now abide them speaking?
surely I intend not to be directed by so unconstant a guide.

If I prove things that no man denies, you had the less labor in
replying: If I translate whole leaves to so small purpose, they be the sooner
answered: if upon so light occasions, I have made so often digressions, you
will take heed (I am well assured) that you offend not in the like: which
truly you have forgotten in this place, for here is a digression without all
reason. But I will let your reverend and modeste speeches pass, and not
recompense them with the like: for it neither sauoureth the spirit of God,
neither yet any modest and good nature, but a stomach swelling rather against
the person, than against the cause.

My purpose is not in this place to seek for rules to measure Ceremonies by,
but to prove that in Ceremonies and other external things, much is left to
the discretion of the Church, which is not to be found in Scriptures: and
yet I know none of these rules unmeet for a divine to search for, or to
understand, unless it be such a one, as contemns all other men's learning
but his own. But how happens it that you have answered nothing to the last
place that I have alleged out of Augustine. Or why say you nothing to my
conclusion, which is, that by all those places of this learned father, it is
evident. etc.

In all this your reply you have greatly faulted in ignorantia Elenchi, for
you have not reasoned, nor answered ad idem, but spoken altogether from the
purpose. T. C fauire^ in ignorantia Elenchi*

But I trust M. Caluines judgment will weigh something with them, who in his
Institutions Cap. 13. Sect. 31. and. 32. speaking of traditions, says in this
sort.

Because the Lord has both faithfully and plainly comprehended, and declared
in the holy scriptures, the whole sum of true righteousness, and all the
parts of the true worshipping of him, and what so ever is necessary unto
salvation, therefore in those things he is only to be heard, as a master, or
teacher: But because in external discipline and ceremonies he would not
particularly prescribe, what we ought to follow, because he foresavv that this
depended upon the state and condition of the time, neither did judge one form
or manner to be agreeable to al ages, here we must have a respect to those
general rules which he gave, that according to the^ might be examined such
things, as the necessity of the Church requires to be commanded for order and
decency. Finally, because in these things he has expressed nothing (for that
they are neither necessary to salvation, and may be diversely applied to the
edifying of the Church, according to the manner and custom of every country
and age) Therefore as the commodity of the Church requires, and as shall be
thought convenient, both the old may be abrogated and nevve appointed. I grant
that we must not rashely nor often, nor for every light cause make
innouations. But what hurts, and what edifieth charity will best judge,
which if we vvil suffer to be the moderatrix, al shall be safe and well. Now it
is the office of Christian people with a free conscience, without
susuperstition, with a godly mind and ready and willing to obey, to observe
those things which are appointed according to this rule, not to contemn them,
nor negligently to omit them, so far off ought they to be from breaking them
openly thorough disdain and contumacie.

But thou will say, what liberty of conscience can there be in so precise
and straight observing of them? truly the liberty of conscience may well
stand which it, if we shall consider that these laws and decrees to the which
we are bound, be not perpetual, or such as are not to be abrogated: but only
external rudiments of man's infirmities: whereof notvvithstanding we all stand
not in need, yet we all use them, because one of us is mutually bound to an
other, to nourishe love and charity among our selves.

This we may learn in the examples used before. What? does religion consist in
a woman's veil, that by no means she may go abroad bare headed? or is the
commandment touching her silence such, as it may not be broken without
wickedness? or is there any mystery in kneeling, or in burying the dead, that
may not be omitted without great offense? No truly: for if such have be
required of a woman to help her neighbor, that she can have no ley sure to
cover her head, she does not offend, though she run out bare headed. And
there is a time and place when and where it is as mete for her to speak, as it
is elsewhere to hold her peace. Him also to pray standing, which being let
with some disease, can not kneel, there is nothing forbids. To be short,
it is better in time to bury the dead, than to tarry for a winding sheet, or
some to carry him, until he stink above the ground. But there is somewhat even
in thosethings, which the custom of Religion, laws, and decrees, humanity
it self, and the rule of modesty wills us to do, and to take heed of, wherein
if we shall through ignorance and forgetfulness offend, there is no sin committed:
But if through contempt or contumacie, it is to be reproved. In like manner it
skilleth not what days be appointed, what hours, what manner of places touching
the building, what Psalms are to be song this day or that day: And yet there
must certain days be appointed, and certain hours, and a place mete to
receive al, if we have any respect to keep unity and peace. For what
confusion were it, and of how great co^tentions and braulings the seed, and
cause, if every man as he lists, might alter and change those things which
pertein to the common state: Seeing that it would never be brought to pass,
that one thing could please all men, if such matters were left indifferent, and
committed to every man's arbitrament? Now if any man repine or grudge, and will
here seem wiser than it behooves him, let him consider by what reason he can
excuse his waywardness in the Lord. Notvvithstanding that saying of S. Paul
must ^atisfie us: we have no custom to contend, neither the 1. Cor. 11.
Churches of God. Thus far Calvin.

In which words we have these things to consider: First that Collections out
of Calvin.
God has in the Scripture fully and plainly comprehended all those things that
be necessary to salvation.

Secondly, that in Ceremonies and external discipline, he has not in
Scripture particularly determined any thing, but left the same to his Church,
to make or abrogate, to alter, or continue, to add, or take away, as shall be
thought from time to time, most conueniente, for the present state of the
Church, so that nothing be done, agayust that general rule of Saint Paul.
1. Corin. 14. Let all things be done decently and in order.

Thirdly, that it is the duty of a Christian man without superstition
willingly to obey such constitutions, not to contemn them, not to neglect
them, much less stubbornely and arrogantly to break them.

Fourthly, that the observing of them takes not liberty from the couscience,
because they be not made to be perpetual and inviolable, but to be altered, as
time, occasion and necessity requires.

Fifthly, that all ought to obey such ordinances, for charity sake, though
all stand not in need of them.

Sixthly, that if a man do violate them by ignorance or forgetfulness, he
does not offend, if by contempt or stubbornness he does greatly offend.

Seventhly, that confusion (which is to suffer every man to do what he list)
is the seed of contention and brawling.

Last of all, that the true ministers of God be not contentious, neither yet
the Churches of God.

These things among other I thought good to note out of M. Caluines words,
which if they were diligentely considered, such contentions might soon be
ended.

Why should you trust that M. Caluins judgment will weigh with them, if they be
Anabaptists (as you accuse them) if they be Donatistes, if Catharists, if
conspired with the Papists, how can you think yt they will so easily rest in
M. Caluines judgment, which hated and confuted all Anabaptisme, Donatisme,
Catharisme, and Papisme? but it is true which the proverb says, memore^. etc.
he yt will speak an untruth, had need have a good memory: and this is the
force of the truth, in the conscience of man, that although he suppress it,
and pretend the contrary, yet at unawares it steals out. For what greater
testimony could you have given of them, that they hate a^ those heresies,
which you lay to their charge, than to say, yt you trust M. Caluins judgment
will weigh ^ the^? Now in deed that you be not deceived, we receive M. Calvin,
and weigh of him, as of the notablest instrument yt the Lord has stirred up,
for ye purging of his Churches, and of the restoring of the plain and sincere
interpretation of the scriptures, which has been since the Apostles times. And
yet we do not so read his works, ye we believe any thing to be true, because he
says it, but so far as we ca^ esteem, that ye which he says, does agree with
the canonical scriptures. But what gather you out of M. Calvin?

First that all necessary things to salvation, are contained in the scripture:
who denies it?

In the second collection, where you would give to understand ye ceremonies and
external discipline are not prescribed particularly by the word of God, and
therefore left to the order of the Church: you must understand, that al
external discipline is not left to the order of ye Church, being particularly
pr^ scribed in ye scriptures, no more than You say afte^ that there are but
these two.
al ceremonies are left to the order of ye Church, as the sacra ments of
Baptisin, and the supper o^ the Lord: whereas, upon the indefinite speaking of
M. Calvin, saying Ceremonies and external discipline, without adding all, or
some, you go about Untruth, for I have reported his words to no other end
than he has written them.
subtly to make me^ believe yt Calvin had placed the whole external discipline
in ye power and arbitrament of the Church. For i^ al external discipline were
arbitrarie, and in the choice of the Church, excommunication also (which is a
part of it) might be cast away, which I think you will not say. But if yt M.
Calvin were alive to hear his sentences You should have showed wherein his
words ar^ ra^ked and wryth^.

nothing less because he is dead.

Concerning all the rest of your collections, I have not lightly known a man,
which ta^eth so much pain with so small gain, and which sows his seed in the
sea, whereof there will never rise increase. For I know none that ever deined

judgment of M. Calvin in any matter that we have in controuers^e with you,
which I speak not therefore, because I would call the decision of
controversies to men and their words (which pertayn only to God and to his
word) but because I know his judgment in these, things to be clean against
you, and especially for that you would beat men in hand, that M. Calvin is on
your side, and against us.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you your self will of necessity enforce these qualities and conditions of
Anabaptists (which I in the beginning rehearsed) upon the authors of the
admonition, who can let you? The most that I have said, is that I suspecte
them, because they so agree with them in certain qualities and practices. But
if they were bent that way, yet does it not follow that they would by and by
seem to contemn M. Caluines or any other famous and learned man's
judgment. For you know that the chief captains of the Anabaptists, did
not forthwith utter either al their contempt of learned men, or all their
pestiferous opinions at the first, but used therein some policy, such as might
most prevail to win credit unto their faction. You remember that Zuinglius
in his book called Ecclesiast. says of the Anabaptists, Zuinglius aducrs.
Anab.
that though they protested, and by oath denied that they meant to take any
authority from the magistrate, yet shortly after it would appear, that they
would have bin disobedient to all laws of Magistrates. etc. as I have before
rehearsed: the practice whereof is to be seen in Sleidan and other stories.

And although in the beginning it was pretended that the contention was but in
matters of no great importance, as cap, surplesse, tippet. etc. yet in the
additions to the first admonition fol. 9. it is protested, that the strife is
for greater matters, as for a true ministry, and gouernmente of the Church,
and now you say, that certain matters Fol. 5. sect. vlt. Fo. 14. lin. 5. Fol.
6. sect. 4.
which be in controversy, are matters of life and death, of salvation and
damnation. fol. 5. and 14. Besides all this the additions that you make to the
protestation of your obedie^cs to the civil Magistrate fol. 6. etc. is very
suspicious, so is your doctrine touching the authority of the civil
magistrate also, as I have in an other place declared. Wherefore how far both
they and you will as yet proceed, is not certainly known. In the mean time,
if by allowing such as M. Calvin is, some credit were not maintained, wise
and learned men would the sooner epsy their doings.

When I say, that I trust M. Caluines judgment will weigh some thing with
them. I speak it but in comparison, to the authority of such as I have
before alleged. For I know they make small acc^mpt of any author that writes
against them, but least of all of the old ancient fathers, whom some of them
are not ashamed to call pillorie Doctors. They may therefore bear a
countenance to such as hate and confute Anabaptisme, Papisme. etc. and yet
both join with the Papists and the Anabaptists etc. in disturbing the Church.

As the words of M. Calvin be directely to my purpose, and my collections
truly gathered out of them, so is your answer thereunto very weak, and in
deed nothing. The words of M. Calvin where upon my second collection is
gathered, be these: But because in external discipline and ceremonies he
would not particularly prescribe what we ought to follow, because he foresaw
that this depended upon the state and condition of the time, neither did judge
one form or manner to be agreeable to all ages: Here we must have respect. etc.
Confer these words with my collection, and you shall see them agree in all
points. And surely M. Calvin says that fully and plainly in this place,
which I have taken in hand to prove. M. Calvin neither adds all, nor some,
and therefore neither have I added them, least I might seem to be a corrupter
of his words.

Your objection of the Supper of the Lord, and of Baptism, is altogether
frivolous: for they be substantial Ceremonies: and not ceremonies only, but
Sacraments also, and therefore must have of necessity an express
commandment in the word of God.

Touching excommunication, I shall speak hereafter, it is the matter that the
Anabaptists so greatly urged, and for the not using of the which, they
separated themselves from the Churches, where the Gospel was preached, as
appears in the books both of Calvin, Bullinger, and others, against them.
I know that touching Excommunication, whether the use of it be at all ^ymes
so necessary or no, that it may not be altered, learned men do vary in
judgments, whose opinions in that matter I will defer, until I come where
I have farther occasion to speak of it.

If M. Calvin were alive, and understood the state of our Church and
controversy truly, I verily believe that he would utterly condemn your
doings: and I am the rather induced to think so, because I understand him to
have allowed many things in the English Church being at Geneua, which you
altogether misselyke, as Funeral sermons. etc. And therefore he would not think
his words racked one whit, to establishe any thing that he would have had
overthrown.

The rest of my collections are most agreeable to M Caluines words, most
necessary for this present time, and most apt for my purpose: and your
passing them over so slightly, does argue your lack of ability to answer
them. In deed they flatly determine this controversy, and in effect
overthrow your whole book.

Those that make contention in the Church for such matters as you do, and in
such sort and manner, can not avoid the just accusations of being
contentious persons: and if the Physician gives a purgation where there is no
need, or a more vehement purgation than is convenient for the disease, or
minister it out of time, or give one purgation for an other. etc. what rumbling
and stir soever follow in the body, he may be justly said to be the author
and cause of them. Do you not know what Zuinglius says in his Ecclesiast.
speaking of Anabaptists: If they were sent of God, Zuinglius i^ Ecclesi^st.
Id^m de bapti^mo.
and endued with the spirit of love, they would have construed in the best
part, those external things. etc. And again, Christ never made any
contention for external things, and in his book de Baptismo, They go about
innouations of their own private authority. etc.

I use M. Caluines judgment, as I use the judgment of other learned men,
neither will I refuse any learned man's opinion in these controversies, that
truly and wholly understands the state of this Church, and the ground of all
things used in it. But I doubt how you will hereafter stand to this offer.

The opinion of Bucer of things indifferent.
Chap. 5.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 29. Sect. 5. and. 6.
Of the same judgment in this matter is M. Bucer, as it appears Bucer of
things indifferent.
in his Epistle to M. Alasco, these be his words: If you will not admit such
liberty, and use of vesture to this pure and holy Church, because they have
no commandment of the Lord, nor example of it: I do not see how you can
grant to any Church, that it may celebrate the Lords Supper in the morning,
and in an open Church, especially consecrated to the Lord: that the Sacrament
may be distributed to men kneeling or standing, yea to women as well as to
men. For we have received of these things neither commandment of the Lord,
nor any example, yea rather the Lord gave a contrary example. For in the
evening, and in a private house he did make his Supper, and distributed the
Sacraments, and that to men only, and sitting at the table. Haec Bucerus.

But to end this matter, is it not as lawful for a godly Prince, with the advice and consent of godly and learned Bishops, and other of the wysest, to
make orders in the Church, and laws Ecclesiastical, as it is for every
private man, to use what manner and form of service he list, and other order
and discipline in his own parish, which these men seek and strive to do.

T. C. Page. 20. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and. Page 21. Sect. 1.
And as for Peter Martyr and Bucer, and Musculus, and Bullinger, Gualter, and
Hemingius, and the rest of the late writers, by citing of whom, you would
give to understand, that they are against us in these matters, there is set
down in the latter end of this book, their several judgments, of the most
of these things which are in controversy: whereby it may appear, that if
they have spoken one word against us, they have You do learned me^ great
injury, in accusing the^ of contrariety.
spoken two for us. And whereas they have written (as it is said) and alieadged
in their private letters to their friends, against some of these causes, it may
appear, that they have in their works published to the whole world, that they
confirm the same causes. So that if they wrote any such things, they shall be
found not so much to have dissented from us, as from themselves: and therefore
we appeal from themselves, unto themselves: and from their private notes and
letters to their public writings, as more autenticall. You labor still in
the fire that is unprofitable, to bring M. Bucer his Epistle to prove, that the
Church may order things, whereof there is no particular and expressed
commandment, for there is none denies it, neither is this saying, that all
things are to be done in the Church according to the rule of the word of God,
any thing repugnant unto this, that the Church may ordeyne certain things,
according to the word of God.

But if this Epistle, and others of M. Bucers with his notes upon the book of
common prayer, which are so often cited, and certain Epistles of M. Peter
Martyr were never printed (as You cannot but understand that they are printed.
I cannot understand they were) then besides that you do us injury, which go
about to prejudice our cause by the testimonies of them, which we can neither
hear nor see, being kept close in your study: you also do your cause much
more injury, whilst you betray the poverty and nakedness of it, being fame
to ransacke, and ruffle up every dark corner, to find something to cover it
with.

Therefore it were good before you took any benefyte of them, to let them come
forth, and speak their own testimonies, in their own language and full
out. For now you give men occasion to think, that there are some other things
in their Epistles which you would be loath the world should know, for fear of
fall of that, which you would gladly keep.

There is What say you than to the. 14. reason of the Admonition, then
ministers were not so tied to any form of prayers. etc.
no man that says that it ought to be permitted to every person in the Church
where he is minister, to have such order or discipline, or to use such service,
as he lists, no man seeks for it. But to have the order which God has
left in those things which the word precisely appoynteth, and in other things
to use that, which shall be according to the rules of S. Paul before recited,
agreed by the Church, and confirmed by the prince.

And whereas you have ever hitherto given the ordering of these things to the
Church, how come you now to An un truth, for I give it not to the Bishops only,
but to a godly Prince with the advice and consent of godly and learned Bishops,
and other of the wisest.
ascribe it to the Bishops? you mean I am sure the Bishops, as we call Bishops
here in England, whereby you fall into the opinion of the Papists unawares,
which when they have spoken many things of the Church inagnifically, at the
last they bring it now to the doctors of the Church, now to Bishops.

As for me, although I doubt not but there be many good men of the Bishops, and
very learned also, and therefore very meet to be admitted into that
consultation, whereinit shall be considered, what things are good in the
Church: yet in respect of that office and calling of a Bishop, which they now
exercise, I think that every godly learned minister and pastor of the
Church, has more interest and right, in respect of his office, to be at that
consultation: then any Bishop or Archbishop in the Realm, for as much as he
has an ordinary calling of God, and function appointed in the scriptures
which he exercises, and the other has not.

But how this authority perteyning to the whole Church, of making of such
orders, may and ought to be called to a certain number, that confusion may be
avoided, and with the consent also of the Churches to avoid tyranny, it shall
appear in a more proper place where we shall have occasion to speak of the
eldership or government in every Church, and of the communion and society or
participation, and intercommuning of the Churches together, by councels, and
assemblies provincial or national.

Io. Whitgifte.
Diverse of those learned men here named, being rightly informed of the state of
The occasion of men's writings must be considered.
this controversy, with all the circumstances perteyning thereunto, have set
down their opinions in writing, and therefore if it should so come to pass,
(which as yet is not proved, neither as I think will be) that in their public
writings, they should seem to affirm any thing contrary to their private
letters, it is because they speaking generally of all, and having respect to
the time and place, wherein and when such things were abused, have generally
spoken of them otherwise then they do, as they be now used in this Church of
England. And surely in my opinion these their epistles, wherein of purpose
(being required) they give their sentence of such matters, ought to be more
credited, than their general writings, wherein they may seem otherwise to
speak upon other occasions. But I think that in the end it will fall out,
that they have written nothing publicly against any thing that is written by
them privately: and of some of them I am sure that their public and private
writings of these matters do fully agree. But where have you learned to
answer on this sort to the authority of learned men? to accuse them of
contrariety before you have manifestly proved it, is to do unto them great
injury.

The place of M. Bucer makes directly for my purpose, and therefore in giuyng
place unto it, you grant as much as I hitherto have required. For M. Bucer
used the example of apparel which is one thing in controversy betwixt us,
and says plainly, that the Church has authority to appoint such things, as
have neither commandment nor example in the Scripture.

These Epistles of M. Bucer, and of M. Martyr, with the Epistles of other
learned men be printed and published wholly and fully, and it can not be that
the same should be unknown unto you, the books being so common: your pleading
of ignorance in this thing is but a color.

When every Minister must be chief of the seigniorie, and have with some other
of the parish the whole authority Ecclesiastical: when they must not be so

tied to any form of prayers, but as the spirit moves them, so to pour out
supplications: when the Prince is secluded from authority in appoynting of
ceremonies, and orders of discipline, that is, when in Ecclesiastical matters
you give to the Civil magistrate no more than the Papists do, to wit
potestatem facti, and not potestatem iuris, as will afterward more plainly
appear: what is it else but for every minister to be Pope in his own parish,
and to use such order, discipline, and service as he himself lists.

If you had bin disposed to speak the truth, and to report my words as they
be written, you would have eased your book of these lines which follow. For
where do I give this authority to the Bishops? or in what words do I
restrain the Church to them? my words be these: Is it not as lawful for a
godly Prince, with the advice and consent of godly and learned Bishops, and
other of the wysest, to make orders in the Church. etc. You see that I join
the Prince, the Bishops, and other of the wisest together in making of orders.
etc. and whenever I mean the Church in such a case, I mean not the
confused multitude of the Church, but such as God has called to govern his
Church in the external government: whom I take to be in this Church, the
Prince, the Bishops, the Council, and such other, as by the order of this
Church, have to do in such like matters.

Your falsifying hurts not me, but discrediteth your self, and your cause.

The Bishops have much to thank you, that it would please you to admit them
into that consultation of yours, if they would give over that office and
calling. But (thanks be unto God) you have as yet no such authority committed
unto you. Wherefore this and such like kind of speeches, do but declare how
magnifically you think of your self. etc.

If it pertayne to the whole Church, that is (as I think you understand it)
to the whole multitude of the Church, to make such orders, how can you
restrain it to a certain number? or why not as well to some one, if the
multitude think it so convenient, but of this matter, when you come to your
seigniorie and kind of government.

shall you take any thing therefrom. etc. And in the other place: Whatsoever I
command you take heed you do it, thou shall put nothing thereto, nor take
ought therefrom. God in the old law to his people, prescribed perfect and
absolute laws, not only moral and judicial, but ceremonial also: neither
was there the lest thing to be done in the Church omitted in the law. And
therefore for them at that time, and during that state, it was not lawful to
add any thing, nor to take any thing away no not in ceremonies and other
civil laws: now in the time of the Gospel God has left unto his Church
expressed in his word a perfect rule of faith and manners, and sufficient to
salvation, and cursed is he that shall add any thing to it, or take any thing
from it in that behalf, for therein it is perfec te and absolute. But as he
has left the judicial law to the discretion of the magistrate, to add

Unto the places of Deuteronome, which prove that nothing ought to be done in
the Church, but that which God commands, and that nothing should be added or
diminished. First you answer that that was a precepte given to the Jews for
that time, which had all things even the least prescribed unto them. I see it
is true which is said, that one absurdity granted, a hundred follow. For to A
(...) perverting of ma ni^ell and playn^ words.
make good, that things ought to be done besides the scripture and word of God,
you are driven to run into part of the error of the Manichees, which say,
that the old testament perteyneth not unto us, nor binds not us. For what is
it else, than to say that these two places served for the Jews time, and under
the law? for surely if these two places agree not unto us in tune of the
Gospel, I know none in all the old testament, which do agree. And I pray
you what is here said which S. John in the Apocalipse says not, where he
shuts up the new testament on this sort: I protest unto every man which
hears the prophecy of this book, that whosoever Apoca. 22.
adds any thing to it, the Lord shall add unto him the plagues which are
written in it: And whosoever takes away any thing from it, the Lord shall
take away his portion out of the book of life, and out of the things that are
written in it? which admonition if you say perteyneth to that book of the
Apocalipse only, yet you must remember that the same may be as truly said of
any other book of the scripture.

Io. Whitgifte.
My first answer to that place of Deuteronomie is true, neither can you
disprove The first answer justified
it by any sound reason or good authority: for if you will have this precept
now to be understood of all the selfsame ordinances, and laws, of the
which, and for the which, it was at that time given, then must we of
necessity keep the ceremonial and judicial precepts of the Law being at
that time in force. The which thing as I suppose, no learned man will once
imagine, but yet as this precepte was then given to them, that they should add
nothing to the laws of God then in force, or take any thing from them, so is
it perpetual for us also, that we should add nothing to the law of faith and
manners, which is likewise perfectly prescribed unto us in the book of God.

And thus you see how far I am from the error of the Manichees, and from
thinking that the old testament does not apperteine unto us: and yet I am not
so Jewish, to How far that precept in Deuteronomy. is extended.
think that we are bound either to the ceremonial or judicial law: and
therefore I say that that precepte applied unto us, does not extend any
further, than to such things as God has commauuded or forbidden us that be
Christians to do in his word. How unjustly therefore you charge me to say, that
these two places agree not unto us under the Gospel, when as I have plainly
declared how they agree to them under the law, and to us under the Gospel, let
any man judge.

The words in the last of the Apocal. although they be properly and namely
spoken of that book, yet I am fully persuaded that they may also be affirmed
of the whole testament. And I am so far from allowing either addition or
detraction, to, or from the word of God, that I utterly condemn as false that
which you have setdown before in your book Fol. 13. That many things are both
commanded and forbidden, of which there is no express mention in the word,
which are as necessarily to be followed or avoided, as Fol. 13. Sect. 2.
those whereof express mention is made.

Then you are driven to say, that the Jews under the law, had a more certain
direction, and consequently a readier w^y, than we have in the time of the
Gospel, of the which time the Prophet Iet. 31. v. 34
says, that then a man should not teach his neighbor, they shall be so
taught of God: as if he should say, that they that live under the Gospel,
should be all, in comparison of that which were under the law doctors. And

say, that they should be all, for their knowledge as learned as the Levites and
priests, which only had entrance into it.

Io. Whitgifte.
In matters of ceremonies and judicials they had more particular rules
prescribed Wherein the Jews had a more certain direction than we.
unto them, and a more certain direction. For we have very little in these
matters particularly written in the new testament: but the moral law we have
as perfect as they had, and in the law of faith, which is the law of the
Gospel and the rule of salvation, we do far exceed them. Other meaning than
this there cannot (with all the violence that you have) be wrong out of my
words.

Your places alleged out of the Prophet Jeremy and Esaias improve nothing that
I have spoken, for the Prophet Jeremy speaks of the elect of God, whom he
Ierem. 3.
does teach and illuminate not only with the outward preaching of his word, but
by the marvelous operation of his spirit also. The words of the Prophet Esaias
(if you Esaias. 56.
mean the 7. ver. of the. 56. Chap. for else there is no such words there) do
signify that God will gather the Gentiles and strangers into his Church, and
make no distinction betwixt them and the Jews in the time of the Gospel: but
how you should gather of that place that the people should be as learned as
the Priests and Levites, I cannot conjecture. Neither truly do I know to what
purpose this text is alleged, except it be alittle by the way, to flatter
the people and to claw them.

Now if the Jews had precepts of every the least action, which told them
precisely how they should walk: how is not their case in that point better
than ours, which because we have in many things but general rules, are to
seek often times, what is the will of God which we should follow? But let us
examine their laws, and compare them with ours in the matters perteyning to
the Church: for whereas the question is of the gouernmente of the Church, it
is very impertinent, that you speak of the iudicialls, as though you had not
yet learned, to distinguish between the Church and commonwealth.

To the ordering and governing of the Church, they had only the moral, and
ceremonial law: we have the same moral that they had: what special
direction therefore they enjoy by the benefyte of that, we have.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Jews as it is confessed by learned men, had their laws more particularly
Why the Jews had their ceremonies particularly prescribed
prescribed unto them, and especially touching Ceremonies, not only because
they were prone to Idolatry, but also oftentimes in subjection to Idolatrous
princes, where they had occasion offered unto them to worship their false Gods.
Therefore a learned interpreter says, Fateor in multis ceremonijs diuinitus
mandatis fuisse occupatos, ne alias appeterent. I confess that they were
occupied in many ceremonies commanded of Call. in barmo. in pentateuc.
God, least they should desire other. This then was one, though not the only
cause of their ceremonial laws: and in this respect their case was not
better, but indeed much more servile and worse than ours, who are delivered
from that yoke of ceremonies, and bound only to two, as Aug. Epist. 118. ad
Ianuar. says most easily to be observed, Aug. epist. 118
and most excellent in signification, that is, the supper of the Lord and
Baptism. So that you are much deceived if you think us to be in worse case,
than they were, because we have not so many particular rules for ceremonies, as
they had: for we are delivered from the bondage of Ceremonies, as the Apostle
declares to the Galat. 5. Galat. 5.
and therefore M. Calvin in his book against the Anabap. answering this
reason of theirs ( There is more perfection required in the Church of Christ,
than there was among Call. adue. ana.
the Jews, and therefore Christians may not use the sword or be magistrates)
says on this sort. Hoc quidem verum est, quod ad Ceremonias attinet. This is
true as touching ceremonies, meaning that we are not now bound to so many laws
of ceremonies, but have freedom and liberty therein. I speak of accidental
ceremonies as well as of Sacraments.

You say that whereas the question is of the government of the Church. etc.
wherein antiquum obtines. For our present question is whither all things to be
used in the Church are prescribed in the scripture? And that which I speak of
the judicial law I speak it by occasion of the interpretation of these
places of Deuteronomie. Howbeit I see no such distance betwixt the Church and
the common wealth, but the laws of the one does and ought to perteine to the
other, except you will do as the Papists did, that is, seclude the civil
magistrate altogether from meddling in any ecclesiastical matter. And I am well

of the Lords supper, and we have as certain a direction, to celebrate them, as
they had to celebrate their ceremonies, and fewer and less difficulties can
rise of ours, than of theirs: and we have more plain and express doctrine to
decide our controversies than they had for theirs. What hour had they for
their ordinary and daily sacrifices? was it not left to the order of the
Church? what places were appointed in their several dwellings to hear the
word of God preached continually, when they came not to Jerusalem? the word
was commanded to be preached, but no mention made, what manner of place they
should have: where was pulpits commanded or chaires? and yet they had both.
Where any form of burial in the law? and yet it is a thing perteyning to the
Chnrch, that the dead be after a comely sort buried: where, any order or form
of marriage? and yet it is known, they had. It was (which is more) in the
discretion of that Church, upon occasion of dearth, or war, plagues, or any
other common calamity, to proclayme a fast.

Io. Whitgifte.
We have no ceremonies which he sacraments, but two, and in them, and for all
things How we have but two Ceremonies.
perteyning to their substance, we have as certain direction as they had for
any of their sacraments. But yet is not every circumstance to be used about the
celebrating of them, so particularly, nor so certainly prescribed unto us, as
was to them in their ceremonies, sacraments, and sacrifices: for they had
every particular circumstance to be used about their sacrifices, sacraments
and ceremonies set down unto them, as it is evident Exodus 12. 25. 26. etc. and
in Leuiticus. We are not bound to any such prescript form of outward
ceremonies and circumstances, but have free liberty, not only to appoynte, but
also to alter and change the same, as shall be thought most convenient: so
that nothing be done against the word of God, and that the general 1. Cor. 14.
rule be observed. 1. Cor. 14. that all things be done decently and in order.
All this therefore that you speak of hour, place, and of the form of
burial, and of marriage. etc. infirmeth nothing that I have said, for these be
circumstances not used in the service of God, but in other actions: and I
speak of such ceremonies and circumstances, as are used in the Church, about
the service and worshipping of God, which were to the Jews particularly
prescribed (as appears in the places before alleged) but be not so to us.

I will not be long, whereas you say, that they had nothing but was determined
by the law: and we have many things undetermined and left to the order of the
Church. I will offer for one that you shall bring that we have left to the
order of the Church, to show you that they had twenty, A large offer but not

which were undecided of, by the express word of God. For as their ceremonies
and Sacraments are multiplied above ours, so grew the number of those cases,
which were not determined by any express word, and therefore I will conclude
Mark these words.
that for so much as we have the same (...) to direct us in the service of God,
which they had, besides that, a noble addition of the new testament, to make
things more manif^st, and to bring greater light unto the old testament, we
have also precise direction of our religion as they had, and therefore those
places of Deuteronomy. stand in as great force now touching the gouernmente of the
Church, as they did then.

And as for the judicial law, for as much as there are some of them made in
regard of the region where they were given, and of the people to whom they
were given, the Prince and Magistrate keeping the substance and equity of them
(as it were the marrow) may change the circumstances of them, as the times and
places, and manners of the people shall require. But to say that any magistrate
can save the life of blasphemers, conteniptuous and stubborn Idol^ters,
murderers, adulterers, incestuous persons, and such like, which God by his
judicial law has commanded to be put to death, I do utterly deni^, and am
ready to prove, if that perteyned to this question. And therefore although the
judicial laws are permitted to the discretion of the Prince and Magistrate,
yet not so generally, as you seem to affirm, and as I have often times said,
that not only it must not be done, against the word, but according to the word,
and by it.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely if you can show me twenty things to be done of them, in the service of
God or discipline of the Church, left to the order of the Church, and
undetermined in the law, for one that I can show left to the order of our
Church, you can do more than any man that I know, has either spoken or
written. Musculus Lo. co. after that he has made a particular Musc. loc. com.

recital of the ceremonial laws, says that God did therefore appoint unto
the^ such a number of Ceremonies, because they should not inue^t any other,
seeing they had Ceremonies inow whereby they might be exercised, and as it were
by a certain kind of schooling might be instructed in the spiritual sense. To
our discretion is left as I have said, the most of the circumstances perteyning
to both the sacraments, most of all external rites, ceremonies, and other
things that perteyne to comeliness and order yea and the disposition of many
things also which apperteine to the external discipline, and gouernmente of
the Church: which are to be varied according to time, persons, and place, as
shall hereafter be proved. If you be able to show that the same liberty was
left unto them, in so many things you shall do more than I can conceive.

But admttte all this to be true, that you say, there can be nothing spoken
more directly The assertion of T. C. directly ^eth the Answer.
for the justifying of my cause. For if the Israelites notwithstanding these
places of Deutero. had liberty to order things in the Church not commanded or
prescribed unto them in the word of God, then do the Authors of the Admonition
unaptly use these places of Deuteronomie: to prove that those things only are
to be used and placed in the Church, which God himself in his word has
commanded. For if the Jews (notwithstanding these precepts) did lawfully use
those things that were not in the word commanded, without adding to the word,
or taking from it, surely we may do so in like manner. And thus have you taken
much pains in justifying that cause, which y^u would so gladly overthrow.

Where you say, that we have the same laws to direct us in the service of God,
that they had, The assertion of T. C. tends to Iudaisme.
if you mean the same moral laws you say truly, but nothing to the purpose:
if you mean the same ceremonial laws (which properly are said to be laws
directing them in the service of God) then do you Iudaizare play the Jew. And
certainly I marvel what you mean by this saying, seeing that you know our
external manner and kind of worshipping of God to be far distante from
theirs: and our sacraments (though spiritually the same) yet both in number,
form, matter, observation, and kind of signification, much differing from
them, and especially seeing that their ceremonial law is utterly abolished.
Neither do I well understand what your meaning is when you add, Besides that a
noble addition of the new testamente, to make things more manifest, and to
bring a greater light unto the old testament. For if you mean that the new
testamente is added to the ceremonial law, that cannot be so, for it is the
end of the Ceremonial law, and does utterly abrogate it. Nam ^inis legis
Christus. etc. Christ is the end of the law. For as well the figures as the
promises contained in Romans 10.
the law and the Prophets, are fulfilled in the new Testament by the coming
Luke. 24.
of Christ, as he him self says, Luke. 24. If you mean that it is added to
the moral law, that is also untrue, for it only explaneth it, it adds
nothing unto it. In deed it brings a great light to the old Testament,
because all things are there fulfilled which were prophe^ied of, and
prefigured in the old Testament. M. Calvin Calvin. inst.
Institu. Cap. 3. Sect. 9. says, that to think Christ to have added any
thing to the law is most pernicious.

I must crave pardon of the Reader, for making such excursions out of the
way, Whether the Magistrate be bound to observe the Judicial law of Moses.
for I am compelled to follow you, which interlace your book with such by*
matters, and those so suspicious and dangerous, that I can not safely pass
them over with silence. And even now again do you enter into a strange and
dangerous opinion in my judgment: for you would have the civil Magistrate
bound to observe all the Judicial laws of Moses, except such as were made
in respect of the re^gion where they were given, and of the people to whom
they were given. Of the which laws the Magistrate you say, may only change
the circumstances, as the times, and places, and manners of the people shall
require. But you utterly deni^, and are ready to prove, if that perteyned to
th^s question, that any Magistrate can save the life of blasphemers,
contemptuous and stubbo^ne Idolaters, murderers, adulterous persons, and such
like, which God by his Judicial law has commanded to be put to death.

Howesoeuer you pass this matter over as impertinent to this question, yet for
as The (...) with the asser tion of T. C.
much as you have here set it down (and I am fully persuaded that it is
untrue) I mind to touch it something, and to utter the reasons of my
persuasions. I leave it to the consideration of those that know the laws, and
state of the Realne, and especially such as have the chief government and
care of the same, what lies hid under this your opinion. First, all the
laws of this land, that be contrary to these Judicial laws of Moses, must
be abrogated: The Prince must be abridged of that prerogative which she has in
pardoning such as by the law be condemned to dye: the punishments of death
for fellonie must be mitigated according to Moses law, which does by other
means punish the same, Exodus 22. To be short, al things must be transformed:
Exodus 22.
Lawyers must cast away their huge volumes, and multitude of cases, and content
them selves with the books of Moses: we of the Clergy would be the best
Judges, and they must require the law at our hands. Deutero. 17. verse. 8.
And so Deuteronomy. 17.
while we make them believe that we seek for equality among our selves, we
seek in deed regal dominion over them. Look Deuter. 17. verse. 12. But to
omit all these considerations, which I leave to those to whom they do
especially perteyne, I will show as briefly as I can, how far this opinion is
from true divinity.

First, besides all those places of Scripture, which make generally for the
abrogation The Judicial law abrogat^.
of the whole law: we have especial places for the Judicial law, and namely
those where Christ makes laws of deuorcement for adultrie. Math. 5. and. 19.
which Mat. 5. and. 19.
were altogether needless, if she that is taken in adultrie should of
necessity be stoned to death, according to ye law of Moses. Aug. ad Pollentiu^
de adult. coniug. li. 2. cap. 6. 7. 8. and. 14. Augustine.
proves by that which is written of Christ. John. 8. touching the woman
deprehended John. 8.
in adultrie, and brought unto him by the Scribes and Pharisees: that the wife,
taken in adultrie ought not to be punished with death, but suffered to live that
she might be reconciled to her husband, or at the least repent. Cyril also
upon the. 11. of Leuit. says, that though the punishment of death was
according to the law of Moses appointed for adultrie, Cyrill.
and certain other crimes, yet among Christians there is no such
commandment in force. Musculus in his common places, tit. de legib. speaking
of the law, says thus: Muscul.
They ask the question whether the whole law be abrogated: we answer, if
whole Moses gave place to Christ, then has his whole law given place to the
law of Christ. And a little after: The commandments of the law are
Moral, Judicial, Ceremonial. That the Ceremonial commandments have
ceased it is evident, forsomuche as the Priesthood of the law, to the which
the ceremonies were annexed is abrogated by the Priesthood of Christ,
according to the order of Melchizedech: and that the Judicials also are ceased
it does herein appear, for that the whole order of government of Israel,
which was requisite unto the inhabiting of the land of promise, has from that
time ceased, wh^ as they being expelled, began to dwell amongst the Gentiles
without a king, without governors, without a Priest, and without a law.

Hemingius in his Encber: is of the same judgment: his words be these. There
is also Hemingius.
the Judicial law, which expired with the common wealth of Moses: so that it
does not bind any man of necessity, but so far only, as some portion of
it does perteyne to the law of nature (as the law against incestuous marriages.
Leuit. 18.) and so much of it likewise, as the civil Magistrate shall admit
for policy.

I omit that place of M. Calvin, which is written in his Harmony upon the. 5.
books Calvin.
of Moses, where he speaking of these laws. Exodus 23. Deuteronomy. 12. Number. 3^. which
were given for the breaking of Images, destroying of places where idolatry was
committed etc. says, that they were but temporal exercises, to keep the
people in obedience. etc. And in the same book, speaking of the. 7* of Deuteronomy.
The graue^ Images of their Gods shall Deuteronomy. 7.
ye burn with fire, and covet not the silver and gold that is on them, etc.
says, Although this was a politic law, and given only to the ancient
people for a time, yet hereby we may gather how detestable Idolatry is. etc.
But of all other places that is most evident which he has in his Institu.

qui recte compositam rempub. negent. etc. There are certain which deny that

commonwealth to be well ordered, which omitting the politic laws of Moses,
is ruled by the common laws of the Gentiles. The which opinion how dangerous
and seditious it is,
let other men consider, it is enough for me to have declared, that it is both
false and foolish. But that usual division is to be observed, which deuideth
the whole law of God delivered by Moses, into manners, ceremonies, and
judgments, and every part thereof is diligently to be considered, that we may
understand what perteyneth unto us thereof, and what does not. In the mean
time, let no man be troubled with this, that both the Judicials and ceremonies
did apperteyne unto manners: for the ancient fathers, the inuentors of this
division, although they were not ignorant, that these two latter parts were
occupied about manners, yet (because they might be altered and abrogated without
any prejudice unto manners) they called them not moral. They called that first
part properly by that name moral, without the which the true holiness of
manners, and the immutable rule of living could not well consist. And again.
The law of God forbids to steal: what punishment was appointed for theft
in the policy of the Jews, appears* in Exodus The most ancient laws of
other nations Exodus 22.
punished theft with double: they which followed afterward made a difference
betwixt open theft, and that which was secret: others condemned the thieves
with exile and banishment: others adjudged them to be whipped: and last of all,
others, to be put to death. False witness amongst the Jews was punished with
equal pain in respect of the hurt: in other places only with infamy: in
other places with hanging. etc. All laws jointly do revenge murder with blood,
but yet with diverse kinds of death. In some places there are greeuouser pains
appointed for adulterers, in other places those which are more easy: yet we
see how they al by this diversity of punishment, tend to one end, for they
al with one consent, do give sentence of punishment against those offenses,
which are condemned by the eternal law of God: to wit, murder, theft,
ad^ltrie, false witness, but they agree not all in the manner of the
punishment. Neither truly is it necessary or expedient that they should agree
herein.
There is a country which should out of hand be destroyed with thieves and
slaughter, if it did not with horrible example deal very sharply with
murderers. There is also some time which requires the augmentation of the
sharpness of punishment, and some people very prone unto some certain sin,
except they be with great rigor kept in awe. He is then very evil affected,
and enuieth the public commodity, that is offended with this diversity,
which is most meet to reteyne the observation of the law of God. For that
which some men object, that by this means injury is done to the law of God,
whiles it being abrogated, other laws are preferred before it, is most vain.
For other laws are not preferred before it, but allowed, not by any simple
comparison in respect of Gods law, but according to the condition of time,
place, and nation: neither can that be said to be abrogated,
which was never prescribed unto us, for God delivered it by the hands of
Moses, not for all nations, but particularly for the Jews. etc. M. Beza
likewise in his book de haer ^ Magist. puniend. of this matter writes thus:
We acknowledge those politic laws to be prescribed, Beza.
only to the country of the Jews: neither are we so unskillful that we
would have Moses common wealth or government called back again, as though it
were not lawful for every Magistrate within his own dominion to make laws in
civil matters. And a little after. The Judicial laws were framed only for
one nation. Therefore seeing they were never written for us, they can not be
said to be abrogated. And again. Only the Israelites were bound to the
Judicial laws, that is, those that dwell in Jury, because they were made fit
for that common wealth only. And after that he has showed by an example of
the law for theft, that that manner and kind of punishment, did only bind
the Israelites, and that other Magistrates in their countries for good causes
may appoint a sharper kind of punishment for the same, he concludes thus:
Lex enim illa Mosis Idem.
quatenus poenae modu^ praescribit, alijs gentibus neque vnqua^ fuit posita,
neque nu^c est proprie abrogata. That law of Moses in so much as it
prescribes the manner of punishment, was neither
at any time given to other nations, neither is it now properly abrogated. So
that now they that be disposed may perceive, how this doctrine of yours not
only tends to the overthrowing of states of common wealths, but is
contrary also to the truth, and opinion of learned men, and those especially
of whom you your self make greatest account. Therefore it is true that I have
said in my answer to the Admonition, that is, The Judicial law to be left to
the discretion of the Magistrate to add to it, or to take from it, or to alter
and change it, as shall be thought most fit for the time, manner of the
country, and condition of the people, as M. Calvin also very aptly notes in
the very end of that. 15. section before rehearsed.

So has he left authority unto his Church to make laws, and appoint orders
and ceremonies, as shall from time to time be thought most expedient and
profitable for the same, so that nothing be done contrary to his word, or
repugnant to the same. And this authority has the Church used, even from the
Apostles time, as it is manifest, both by the scriptures. Act. 6. Act. 15. 1.

Chap. 6. the. 6. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 31. Sect. 1.
But to come to the words of Deuteronomie them selves, what is it to add to
the word of God, or to take from it? Truly to think otherwise, or teach
otherwise of God than he has in his word revealed: Those take from the
word, that believe less than in the word is expressed: those add to the
word, first, which teach or decree any thing either in matters of faith or
ceremonies, contrary to the word. Secondly, those that make any thing
necessary unto salvation, not contained in the word. Thirdly, such as make
any religion, or opinion of merit in any thing that they themselves have
invented besides the word of God. Last of all they add to the word, which
forbid that for a thing of it self unlawful, which Gods word does not
forbid, and make that sin which Gods word does not make sin. But such as
truly and sincerely embrace the word of God, and admit nothing contrary unto
it, if in government and ceremonies without any wicked and superstitious
opinion they appoint or retain such as they know not to be against the word
of God, and profitable for the present state of the Church, can not truly be
said to add any thing to the word of God, or take any thing from it, though
the same be not expressed in the word.

T. C. Page 22. Sect. 3.
After you define what it is to take from, and put to the word of God, wherein
not to speak of your wonderful There is no great dexterity required to
perform this.
dexterity in defining, which can define two things, and those contrary
(putting to, and taking fro) with one difference, which Zeno him self could
never do, you leave out that which Moses especially meant to comprehend, which
is, not to do more, nor to do less than he has commanded. And as for your
division, it has as evil success here, as in other places, for when it is a
great fault in dividing to have either too much or too little, you fault in
both, for where as you say, they add, which teach or decree. etc. Besides
that you leave out, which Moses mente, you forget also that, which your self
had said, which had placed adding too, not only in teaching and decreeing,
but in thinking or believing.

And whereas you make four parts of your division, the three last are found to
be all under the first member, which is to make things of faith and ceremonies,
contrary to the word, and so your division is not only faulty, but no
division at all. All this is spoken in contempt of the person, not in defense
of the cause.
The which thing I could have easily forgiven you, and passed by as a thing not
very commendable to travel to show the poverty of those things, which do
sufficiently of themselves (as it were) proclayme their own shame: but that it
grieved me to see a book lengthened with first, second, third, last, as
though every one of them contained some notable new matter, which needed an
Oyes before it, to stir up the attention of the reader, when there is nothing
but a many of words without matter, as it were a sort of fair empty
apothecaries boxes, without any stuff in them. And for that you are so hard
with other men for their Logike, I will desire the reader to pardon me, if I
pursue these things more narrowlier than some peradventure will like of, or I
my self delight in. And so for any definition or division that I can perceive,
it stands fast, that nothing is to be done in the Church of God, but by his
commandment and word directing the some. It is true in deed, if they be not
against the word of God, and profitable for the Church, they are to be
received, as those things which God by the Church does command, and as
grounded of the word of God. But there is the question, and therefore you
taking this as a thing granted always, do always fall into that which you
charge other with, of the failacion of Petitio principij.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is neither definition nor division here that can please you: but what
remedy? when you iestes be uttered, and you a little sported your self, and
the matter comes to trial, there appears very sle^der corrections: I have
after my rude and simple manner declared what it is to add to the word of God,
or to take from it, and have Two contraties may be defined with one difference.
not sought for any exact definition. But yet (by your leave) two contraries
may be defined by one general difference, when we talk of those things which
be common to them both, and do not seek to separate them from among them
selves, but from all other things, that be not of the same kind. So is virtue
and vice, by this difference sensim acquiri, and sensim amitti, separated from
al other that be not sub habitu: As Homo and brutum by this difference
sensibile, be separated from all other creatures that be not under Animal. It
is a common rule, that the definition of that which is called genus, does
agree to every part and member under it, which we call species, be they
contrary, repugnant, or otherwise disagreeing the one from the other,
howsoever. Therefore declaring generally what it is to add to the word, or to
take from the word, I say it is to think otherwise, or to teach otherwise of
God, than he has in his word revealed. Which in genere does aptly expound
them both. For as well he that adds to the word, as he that takes from the
word, does think or teach of God otherwise than he has in his word
revealed. So you see that a man of small dexterity, in defining may do that,
which you thought Zeno himself could not perform.

But what needed all this pastime of yours? do I not immediately after severally
declare both what it is to add to the word, and what also to take from it?
are you able to prove that the expositions which I set down be not true? can
you better them? Will you still more and more declare your quarrel to be rather
against the person, than the cause? You say I leave out that which Moses
especially mente to comprehend, which is, not to do more, nor to do less
than he has commanded. Surely if you were disposed to deal modestly and
sincerely as it behooves you in so weighty a matter, you would not thus
wittingly and willingly seek occasion of quarelling: whether that which you
say is left out, must not of recessitie be included in those words that I
have spoken of adding to the word, and taking from it, or no, I leave to the
indifferent reader to consider.

Touching my division, I say as I did of the definition. I am not curious in
dividing, but I plainly and after my rude manner tell how many ways a man
may add to the word of God. Neither does he always divide, that shows
how many ways a thing may be done, and yet is there nothing left out
necessary to be expressed. For this that you speak of thinking and believing,
is included in the third kind of adding to the word. The three last kinds
are not found to be under the first* for it is not all one to teach or decree
any thing contrary to the word: to make any thing necessary to salvation
not contained in the word: to put any religion or opinion of merit in any
thing that men them selves have invented besides the word: and to forbid that
as unlawful which God does not forbid.

In the first kind is invocation of Saints, worshipping of Images. etc.
which be directly contrary to the express word of God. In the second is
that decree of Pope Boniface, which makes it necessary to salvation to be
subject to the Bishop of Rome, and such like, whereof there is no mention in
the Scriptures. In the third kind are all outward Ceremonies invented by
man, wherein any opinion of worshipping or merit is put: as holy bread, holy
water, and other Ceremonies of that sort. In the last part is the decree of
Pope Nicholas, Did. 22. omnes, where it is decreed, that he which infringeth
the privileges of the Church of Rome, is an heretic. And in this sort do
those add also to the word, which condemn the use of things indifferent as
unlawful, for in so doing they make that sin, which the word of God does not
make sin.

Again that there is a great difference in the parts of my division, and that
they are not confounded, you might have perceived if it had pleased you with
better advise to have weighed them: for things may be decreed contrary to the
word, and yet not made necessary unto salvation. Things may be made as
necessary to salvation, which of them selves are not contrary to the word,
and yet not contained in the word: Men may have an opinion of Religion and
merit in such things as they think not to be of necessity to salvation. To
be short, men may make that sin, which the word of God makes not sin, as
all those do which forbid the use of indifferent things, and make the same
unlawful as I have said before. You see now that there is no one part of
this division (as you call it) which does not include something not contained
in the other parts: and therefore all those unseemly and immodest tauntes and
words might have bin forborne.

I ask no forgiveness of you for any thing that I have written: But I
beseech God forgive you your outrageous contemptes, and unchristian floutes
and iestes, where with your book is more pestered, than any of Hardinges is,
where he shows him self most scurrilous. But I will omit them all, and
only desire the Reader to consider of what spirit they come, and in both our
writings to respect the matter, not the person.

dividing and defyning.

Here now I would gladly know what T. C. has proved against the thing yt I have
here written, or how he has justified ye proposition of ye Admonition which I
have refelled: for the su^me of al is this. The authors of the Admonition say,
that those things only are to be placed in the Church, which God him self in
his word commands. This I confess to be true in matters of salvation and
damnation. But I say it is untrue in matters of ceremonies, rites, orders,
discipline, and kind of gouernmente: which being external matters, and
alterable, are to be altered and changed, appointed and abrogated, according
to time, place, and person, so that nothing be done against the word of God.
And T. C. confesses page. 15. that Page 15. Sect. 5.
certain things are left to the order of the Church, because they are of
that nature, which are varied by times, places, persons, and other
circumstances, and so could not at once be set down and established for ever,
and yet so left to the order of the Church, as that it do nothing against
the rules aforesaid. The same does he affirm in effect in this place. Now
I pray you tell me, what difference is there in our words? he says: that
certain things are left to the order of the Church. etc. so that nothing
be done against the rules aforesaid: And I say, that the Church has
authority to appoint orders, rites, ceremonies. etc. so that nothing be done
against the word of God. In deed he goes much further in this matter than I
do, for where I say, The Scripture expresses all things necessary to
salvation, he affirms, that many things are both commanded and forbidden.

same, and so end this question.

and matters of ceremonies, many things are to be used in the Church, which be
not contained in the Scriptures. And speaking of this place. Philip. 3. (If any
think otherwise, God will also reveal the same unto you: nevertheless, in
that whereunto we are come, let us proceed by one rule, or agree among our
selves) says, That the Apostle there speaks of nothing else, than of
external ceremonies and rites, the use and administration whereof, the same
Apostle in that place affyrmeth, to be in our will and power, so that we do
nothing repugnant to the commandment of God. Neither trouble the publyke
peace (whereof we ought to have especial regard) for external things.
These be the very words of Zuinglius, in the which there is first to be noted,
the interpretation of the words of the Apostle, Philip. 3. Secondly, that he
uses Collections out of Zuinglius.
this exception, So that we do nothing repugnant to the commandment of God,
which T. C. so much misliketh. The same Zuinglius in the same book, verifieth
in plain words that which I before have, touching a negative argument from
the authority of the Scriptures.

Peter Martyr upon the. 1. Corinthians. 1. writes, That there be three kinds of
traditions, P. Martyr.
one expressed in the Scriptures: an other plain repugnant to the word of
God: The third neither contrary to the word of God, nor yet necessarily
joined to the same: in the which we must obey the Church, These three
cautions being observed: First, that they be not obtruded as worship of God,
or peculiar holiness, but as pertaining to order, and the civil commodity of
the Church, and to comeliness in divine actions: for all things be
sufficiently contained in Scriptures that pertayne to the worshipping of God,
and holiness. Secondly, that they be not counted so necessary, but that they
may be altered, if time require. Let the Church keep her interest and
authority in these indifferent things, to appoint what shall be thought most
necessary and meet to edifying. Last of all, that the people of God be not
burdened with to great a multitude of them. Thus far Martyr.

Gualter in his preface to the first Epistle to the Corinth. after that he has
declared Gualter.
the diversity of rites used in diverse Churches, concludes on this sort.
Wherefore S. Augustine writing to Ianuarius, after that he had laid forth
diverse ceremonies of Churches observed in his time, did very well think that
this should be the most safe rule unto Christian men, if they did frame them
selves, unto those Churches, whereunto they should come, in those things which
might be done without any prejudice unto faith and godliness, his words are
these: There is in these things (meaning customs and rytes) no better rule or
instruction for a grave and wise Christian, than that he do after that manner
the which he sees used of the Church unto the which he shall peradventure
come. etc. The which moderation if all men would use at this day, there would
be less contention in the Church, neither should Christian liberty be
abridged by the superstitious traditions of men. But why do they condemn
whole Churches, for indifferent things, which if they would obey S. Paul,
ought to apply them selves to the weakness of every one.

Beza in an Epistle of his, prefixed before the confession of the Churches in
Heluetia Beza.
says, That all rytes and ceremonies are not to be received without exception,
which the Apostolic Church it self has used, either as profitable or
necessary for their times: and in his book called confessio Christ. fidei.
cap. 5. he writes That one cause of Councels and Idem.
Synodes was, to make rules of ecclesiastical discipline, and to appoint the
government of the Church, according to the diversity of time, place and
persons: For it is necessary that in the house of the Lord all things should
be done in order: of the which order there is one general reason in the
word of God 1. Cor. 14. But not one and the same form, agreeing to all
circumstances. And again in the same Chapter he says, The rules or canons (of
rytes and Idem.
orders in the Church) have respect to comeliness in external things, and
therefore they be neither general for the most part, nor perpetual: for that
which is profitable in some place, in other some places would rather hurt: and
moreover the diverse respects of the time are such, that the same thing which
for good considerations was ordained, must of necessity sometime be abrogated:
whereof it comes to pass, that there is not only so great variety in the
old canons, but contrariety also. Again in the same Chapter. We must Idem.
not always look what the Apostles did in politia ecclesiastica, in the
gouernmente of the Church, seeing there be most diverse circumstances, and
therefore absque (...) without
preposterous zeal, all things can not in all places and times be reduced to
one, and the same form. etc.

In the confession of the Churches in Heluetia. etc. it is thus written: Men
shall easily Confess. ecclesiarum Heluet.
gather this also, that we do not by any wicked schism, sever or cut off our
selves, from Christ's holy Churches of Germany, France, England, and other
Christian nations, but that we well agree with all and every one of them, in
the truth of Christ, which here we have acknowledged. For albeit there is some
variety in diverse Churches, about the uttering and setting forth of their
doctrine, and about rytes and ceremonies, which they receive as a mean to
edify their Churches, yet that variety never seemed to minister cause of
dissension and schism in the Church: for in such matters the Churches of
Christ have alvvayes used their liberty, as we may read in the
Ecclesiastical history.

I omit here the confession of the Church of VVirtenberge, and the testimonies
of sundry other notable learned men. I know no learned writer, that does deny
the Church to have authority in appoynting rytes, ceremonies, discipline, and
kind of government according to the place, time, persons, and other
circumstances, though the same be not expressed in the word of God, so that it
do nothing repugnante to the same.

But what need I labor so much in a matter confessed by him, that would seem
to overthrow it: for if the Jews had twenty things left to their order in
the Church for our Page 21. Sect. ^
one (as T. C. has affirmed) and yet this commandment not broken Deu. 4.
and. 12. Nihil adds verbo. etc then may the Church of Christ use her liberty
in like manner, without any breach of the same. Wherefore to conclude. I now
refer it to the judgment of the Reader, whether if be true or not, that I
have affyrmed against the Authors of the Admonition: to wit that those things
only are not to be brought in, or used in the Church, which the Lord himself
in his word has commanded, but that of necessity in external things, and
outward government, the Church has authority to determine according to time,
place, person. etc. though the same be not commanded or expressed in
Scripture, so that it be not repugnant to the word.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 32. Sect. 1. 2. and. Page 33. Sect. 1.
The other places noted in this margent, as Psalm. 37. Romans 12. 1. Cor.
Scriptures unchristianly abused by the Admonition.
2. and the rest are not alleged to prove any thing in controversy, but only
without judgment placed in the margent to make a show: how aptly they be
applied I leave to the consideration of the diligent Reader.

This one thing I can not but marvel at, that these fellows so please
themselves in the platform of their Church, and attribute so much thereunto,
that they exhort, nay rather charge the court of Parliament, with perfect
hatred to detest the present state of the Church, and with singular love to
embrace that which they prescribe in this Book: and to move them rather to
this perfect hatred of us, and singular love of themselves, they use the
authority of the. 31. and 139. Psalm. In the one, David says that he has
hated them that give themselves to deceitful vanities, because he trusts in
the Lord. In the other speaking of the contemners of God, of wicked and
bloody men, Mark this spirit.
and of such as blaspheme God, and be his enemies, he says, I hate them with
an unfeigned hatred. etc.

As though all such as like or allow of the present state of the Church of
this Realm of England, gave them selves to deceitful vanities, were
contemners of God, wicked and bloody men, blasphemers of God, and his enimyes.
I will not aggrauate this blasphemy of theirs: let Prince, Nobles, and all
other lovers of God and his word, consider diligently this spirit, and in
time prevent the burning malice of the same: no Turk, no Jew, no Papist
could possibly have spoken more spitefully of this Church and state: but such
is the spirit of arrogancy. To the like effect they allege the. 15. of
John. 1. Timo. 3. Math. 7. and. 11. as though they only had the word of God,
and were of the Church, and we contemners and reiecters of the same. O where
is humility? Truly if these men be not by discipline brideled, they will work
more harm to this Church than ever the Papist did.

Io. Whitgifte.
To this there is not one word spoken.

Admonition.
May it therefore please your wisdoms to understand, we in England are so
far off, from having a Church rightly reformed, according to the prescript of
Gods word, that as yet we are not come to the outward face of the same. For to
speak of that wherein all consent, and whereupon all writers accord. The
outward marks whereby a true Christian Church is known, are preaching of the
word purely, ministering of the Sacraments sincerely, and Ecclesiastical
discipline, which consists in admonition and correcting of faults severely.
Touching the first, namely the ministry of the word, althougher must be
confessed, that the substance of doctrine by many delivered is sound and good,
yet herein it fails, that neither the Ministers thereof are according to Gods
word proved, elected, called or ordained: nor the function in such sort so
narrowly looked unto, as of right it ought, and is of necessity required.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 34. and. 35.
The proposition that these libellers would prove is, that we in England are
so far from having a Church rightly reformed according to the prescripte of
Gods word, that as yet we are not come to the outward face of the same. For
proof hereof they use this argnment: There be three out ward marks whereby a
true Christian Church is known: preaching of the word purely, ministryng of
the Sacraments sincerely: and ecclesiastical discipline, which consists in
Admonition and correction of faults severely. But this Church of England (for
so in effect they say) is void of all these, Ergo it has not so much as the
external face of a Church. To prove that the word of God is not preached
truly, they reason on this sort: The Ministers of the word are not according
to gods word, proved, elected, called or ordained, nor the function in such
sort so narrowly looked unto, as of right it ought, and is of necessity
required: And therefore the word of God not truly preached. Here All points of
doctrine pure in this church.
(thanks be to God) they allege not one article of Faith, or point of
doctrine, nor one piece of any substance, to be otherwise taught and allowed
of in this Church (for not every man's folly is to be ascribed to the whole
Church) than by the prescripte word of God may be justified, neither can
they. Now how this conclusion follows (though the antecedent were true) let
those judge that be learned. The Ministers are not rightly proved and elected.
etc. An unapt r^son.
Ergo the word of God is not truly preached: how wicked so ever the man is,
howsoever he intrude himself into the ministry, yet may he preach the true
word of God. For the truth of the doctrine does not in any respect depend
upon the goodness or euilnesse of the man: I pray you how were you, and some
other of your adherentes called, elected, etc? But to come to the purpose: They
would prove that the Ministers of the word in this Church of England, are
not according to gods word proved, elected, called or ordained.

What force and pithe is in their arguments, shall appear in the several
answers to every one of them. This one thing I must let you understand, that
these men seek to deface this Church of England, by the self same grounds
that the Papists do: although by another kind of proof. For what have the
Papists else to say, but that we have no Ministers, because they be not
rightly called, and so consequently no word, no Sacraments, no discipline, no
Church. And certainly if it were well examyned, I believe it would fall
out, that the Authors of this Book have conspired with the Papists to
overthrow (if they could) the state both of this Church and Realm,
howsoever subtly they seem to detest Papistrie.

T. C. Page 23. Sect. 1, 2, 3.
Where do I (...) that they say so?
Where in effect do they say, that the Church of England is void of
preaching* and ministering of the Sacraments? is it all one to say, that the
word in the Church of England is not purely preached, and the Sacraments
sincerely, and discipline severely administered, with this, that the Church of
England is void of all these? Again, where do they reason thus, that the
word of GOD is not truly preached, because the Ministers are not ryghtly
proved, and elected, when as they have not one word of true preaching? Is it
all one to say it is not purely preached, and to say, it is not truly
preached? Saint Paul to the A cavil.
Philipp. is glad that the Gospel be preached, although it be not purely,
but he would never have been glad, that it should have been preached falsely
or not truly. Again he inueygheth not against the false Apostles, in the
Church of Corinthe, because they preached the word untruly, but because they
vsyng painted words and affected eloquence, and making a great show of
learning, and tounges, did not preach the Gospel sincerely: so that you see
that it is one thing, not to preach truly, and an other thing not to preach
purely: and so you see their reason is not so evil, for the want of a good
calling may give occasion to say, that the word of God is not sincerely
taught, because there is not a lawful and ordinary calling. For although
for the substance of doctrine, and the manner of handlyng of it, they that
Saint Paul speaks to, of the Philipp. did not fault, yet Saint Paul says
that they did not preach purely, because they did it of contention, or of
envy, which was no fault in the doctrine, but in him that taught. Therefore
let men judge how just your wayghtes are, that expound not purely not
truly, and whyther this be to confute other men's arguments, rather than to
skirmishe with your own shadows.

I know no Papists reason thus, that because we have no Ministers, therefore
no word, no Sacrament, no discipline, no Church, For they deny that we have
the word or Sacraments, because we hold not their word and sacrifice: but
if there be that so reason, yet these men that you charge, have neither any
such antecedent, or such a consequent. For they never said that there is no
Ministry in England, nor yet do ever conclude, that there is no word, no
sacraments, no discipline, nor Church.

For in saying that the face of the Church does not so much appear (for so
the whole process of their book does declare that they mean, when they say
that we have not scarce the face of the Church) they grant that we have the
Church of God: but that for want of those ornaments, which it should have,
and through certain the deformed rags of Popery, which it should not
have, the Church does not appear in her native colors, and so beautiful,
as it is meet she should be prepared, to so glorious a husband as is the
son of God. Say you certaynely, and do you believe that the authors of this
book, are conspired with the Papists, to overthrow this Church and Realm?
Now certaynely I will never do that injury unto them, as once to go about
to purge them of so manifest slanders, nor never be brought by the outrage of
your speeches to prove that nooneday is not mydnight: and therefore as for you,
I will set your conscience and you together. The reader I will desire, not to
think it a strange thing: for it is no other than has happened to the
servant of God, even from those which have professed the same religion,
which they did, as it appears in the. 37. of Jeremy, which was accused of
certain of the Israelites, that he had conspired with the Babilonians, their
mortal enimyes, and laid to his charge that he was going to them, when he was
going to Benjamin.

Io. Whitgifte,
Who is so blind as he that will not see? Do they not in plain words say
That the outward marks whereby a true Christian Church is known, are
preaching of the word purely: ministering the Sacraments sincerely, and
Ecclesiastical discipline. etc? Is not their whole drifte in the Admonition to
prove, That neither the word is preached purely, nor the Sacraments sincerely
ministered. etc. in this Chnrche of England? and what do T. C. willuigly
peruerteth the words of ye Answer.
I otherwise report of them? be not my words plain? where do I affirm that
they should say that the Church of England is void of preaching and
ministering the Sacraments? But let the Reader consider my words, and
accordingly judge of your plain dealing. Where I write yt they in effect say
the Church of England is void of these, I am sure you will refer, these, to
that which went before, that is, preaching of the word purely, ministering of
the Sacraments sincerely, and ecclesiastical discipline, etc. neither can you
otherwise do though you would wrest my words never so violently: and
therefore that which I report of them, is, that they say this Church of
England neither has the word purely preached, nor the sacraments sincerely
ministered. etc.

I make no great difference betwixt purely, and truly, neither does it
follow Purely and truly.
that the word of God is truly preached always when the truth is preached.
For as a man may do Iusta, not Just, lust things and yet not justly: so may
the truth be preached, and yet not truly. A man may do that which is just
unwittingly, or for gain, or for pleasure, or for malice, but then he does it
not justly, Quid non ex babitu and animo: Even so a man may preach the true
word of God, of affection, of contention, ambition, for profit. etc. but then
he does not preach it truly. So that your distinction betwixt purely and
truly is to no purpose.

Neither does Saint Paul help you any thing at all, but is clean centrarye
1. Phi. verse. 18.
unto you, for in the* 18. verse of the first Chapter to the Philip. these be
his words. (...)* etc. which in the Bible Printed at Geneua is thus
translated: What then? yet Christ is preached all manner ways, whether it be
under a pretense, or sincerely. So you see that there is no difference made
betwixt sincerely and truly, for the Greek word signifies truly. And
Master Beza in his notes upon the same Chapter and. 16. verse expoundyng (...)
not purely, says thus Non pu^o scilicet animo, quum alio qui pura Beza.
esset doctrina, to weete, not with a pure mind, seeing that otherwise the
doctrine is pure. so that these aduerbes purely and truly in this place are
referred not to the doctrine, but to mind of him that teaches* I would wyshe
that both you and others would cease from drawyng the Scriptures to your
phantasyes and affections.

That this is one reason of the Papists to prove that we are not the Church,
because we have no true ministry, I marvel you can be ignorant, seeing there
is nothing oft^er in their mouths.

Whether the authors of the Admonition reason in like manner or no, tell me,
when you have well considered these words of theirs in the Epistle to the
Reader. Either must we have a right-ministery of God, and a right government
of his Church according to the Scriptures set up (both which we lack) or eise
there can be no right Religion. Likewise when you have without parcialitie
viewed the rest of their book: Truly I think him to be more than blind,
that sees not this to be their kind of reasoning. Their meaning is plain,
and the second Admonition makes it plainer, howsoever you would seem to
color, and cloak the matter, for what other meaning can it have to say that
we have no right* Religion, and to speak so bitterly against the whole form
of the Church, and the most of such things as be in the same?

I do believe certaynely that there is some Papisticall practitioners among
you, neither is it strange, for so conspired they with the Anabaptists also
as I have declared, and the Anabaptists hated them, as much as you, and
pretended the sunplicitie of the word of God as much as you: and both in
pretense of zeal, of purity of life, and other qualities, for the most part
were equal unto you. And though the Prophet Jeremy were unjustly accused,
yet does not that improve any thing that I have said: for they are not the
Prophet Ieremye, neither in person, office, or cause, neither yet have I
accused them unjustly in any thing.

Of the election of Ministers. Tract. 3.
Of the trial of Ministers both in learning and conversation.
Chap. 1. the first division.
Admonition.
The first is this. For whereas in the old Church atrial was had Acts. 1. 11.

both of their ability to enstruct, and of their godly conversation also: now

learned and unlearned, of the basest 1. Re. 12. 31.
sort of the people (to the slander of the Gospel in the Romans 2. 14.
mouths of the adversaries) are freely received.

Answer to the Admonition. Page. 36.
It it true that in the old Church trial was had of their ability to
instruct, and of their godly conversation. But the place in the margent
alleged out of the first Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles makes nothing
for that purpose: being therein no mention at all of any trial made either of
learning or manners, but only of presenting two, and of praying and casting of
lottes: And M. Clauine in his Institutions says plainly, that out of this
place of the Acts and example, there can be no certain rule gathered of
electing and chosing Ministers, for as that ministry was extraordinary, so
was the calling also. Read M. Calvin and you shall soon see how little this
place, so often in the margent quoted, makes for that purpose for the which it
is quoted.

T. C. Page 23. Sect. 4. 5. and Page 24. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4.
It makes for the purpose which is alleged out of the first of the Acts, to
prove, that there ought to be trial of those which are chofen to the
ministry: for when S. Peter says, that such a one must be chosen as has
been continually conversant with our savior Christ, and from the beginning of
his preaching until the day wherein he ascended into heaven, he meant nothing
Surely that was not so much meant, as that he might be a fit witness of the
doyngs of Christ and of his resurrection.
else, but that such a one should be chosen, which was sufficiently instructed,
and had been continually a scholar of our savior Christ, and therefore fit to
teach and to witness that, which they had seen, and whose godly conversation
was notorionsly known.

Besides that, albeit those two Mathias and Barsabas were therefore set up in
the midst, that the Church in the prayer that was made for their election,
might by seeing them, pray the earnestlyer for them: yet it was also as much to
say, that if any could object any thing against them, that he should prefer
his objection.

And whether they were examined or ^s, the matter is not great, neither when it
is said that a trial should be had, it is meant, that when the parties are
famously known to those which have the right of election, that there should
be always necessarily an apposing and examining, so that the sufficiency of
doctrine and holiness of life (for the which cause the trial and examination
is commanded) be known and agreed upon by them, that chose, it is enough.

And so these two being notoriously known and consented of by the Church, to
be fit men, might happily not be examyned, but yet the words of Saint Peter
declare plainly, that in the choice of them, there was regard had to both,
their ability to teach, and honesty of conversation.

And although there be certain things extraordinary in this election, If all
these be extraordinary, what have you left in that election, as ordinary^ or
how prove you the other to be ordinary more than some of these.
as that such a one must be chosen which had been conversant with our savior
Christ, and that there were two put up for one place, and that it was permitted
to lottes, to cast the Apostleship upon one of them two, as if the Lord
should by the lottes from heaven, tell, who should have it: yet it follows
not to say, that the rest of the things that are there used, should not be
practiced in ordinary callings, for as much they will well agree with them.

And Master Calvin in the place you allege says, that the ordinary
callings somewhat differ from the calling of the Apostles, and after shows
wherein: that is, in that they were appointed immediately of God, and by his
mouth: whereby it appears, that for the residue of those things which are
there mentioned, he holds that they may well stand with the ordinarye
elections.

Io. Whitgifte.
This Reply stands all by conjectures: it is certain that there was no
trial had of them, because they were sufficiently known, and therefore the
text without discretion alleged, to prove that there ought to be a trial of
their ability to instruct etc. If it had been quoted to prove that such as
were admitted into the function, were meet for the same, both sor their life
and doctrine, it had been to some purpose. I think it necessary that such as
be admitted into the ministry (unless they be very well known) should
be tried, both in learning, and life, but this place makes nothing at all for
that purpose, but rather contrary, for it speaks of such two as were well
known, and therefore needed no trial: so that if we conclude any thing of
that place, it must be this, that none ought to be admitted into the
ministry, but such as be well known, and need no trial.

There was no other cause of presentyng them, than that which is expressed in
the text, and it is presumption to make the Scripture serve to maynteyn our
contentions, against the express words and plain meaning.

If this be a rule to be followed, it must be followed wholly: for where have
you learned to add, or take from any law or rule prescribed in Gods word?
or how do ye know that this example must be followed in one thing, and not
in an other? what special revelation have you to make any such dismembring of
this action? No doubt this example is extraordinary, and not of necessity to
be followed.

The words of M. Calvin are plain, that there can be no certain rule
gathered of this example, for the electing of ministers, because the calling of
the Apostles does something differ from the calling of other ministers.

Chap. 1. the second Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 36.
In the sixth of the Acts mention is made of Deacons only, whom you will not
allow to be ministers of the word, and therefore this place serves not your
turn, neither is there any thing spoken of any trial, but only they are
willed to look out among them, seven men of honest report, and full of the
holy Ghost, and wisdom to be appointed Deacons.

T. C. Page. 24. Sect. 5.
And where you say that the sixte of the Acts, because it speaks of Deacons
is nothing to the matter, me think you should have easily understood, that
if a trial be necessary in Deacons (which is an under office in the
Church, and has regard but to one part of the Church, which is the
poor, and is occupied in the distribution of money) much more it ought to be
in an office of greater charge, which has respect to the whole Church, and
is occupied in the dispensyug of the holy word of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
That there should be a trial of such as are to be admitted to the
ministry, I think it most convenient (as I told you before) except the
parties be sufficiently known to such as have authority to admit them: but I
say that this place of the Acts does not prove it, both because the office of
a Deacon (by their opinion) is altogether distinct from the office of a
minister of the word, the one perteyning to the body, the other to the soul,
the one occupied about money, the other in the word, and also, for that
there is in that place no mention made of any trial. That place rather proves
that which before was noted A^t. 1. that such only should be appointed to
that office, as be known by good experience to be fit for such a function.

Tell me one word in that text that signifies any such trial as the
Admonition speaks of. Therefore I say again as I said before, that such as
be well known, need no farther trial: as both that example Act. 1. and this
also Act. 6. manifestly declares.

followed. And the book of ordring ministers and deacons, set forth and allowed
by this Church of England requires, that whosoever is to be admitted into the
order of the ministry, should so be tried, examined, and proved both for
learning and life, as S. Paul there requires. Read the book with
indifferency and judgment, and thou can not but greatly commend it. If any
man neglect his duty in that point, his fault must not be ascribed to the rule

T. C. Page 24 Sect. 6.
But in the end you agree that they should be tried, so that now the question
stands only how and by what means: wherein you for your part say, that the
book of ordering ministers is a sufficient and good rule. I have read it, and
yet I can not commend it greatly. But you will say not with indgement, or
iudifferencie. I will promise you with this indifferency, that I wished, that
all that is there, were good and convenient, and such as I might say unto, so
be it. With what judgment I do disallowe it, I leave it to all men to
esteem upon these reasons.

Io. Whitgifte.
The question is not whether you allow, or disallowe that book, neither is it
material whether you do or not. Your reasons used against it, I will
severally, for memory sake examine.

many things, yet is he blind also in many, and that even in those things which

voices, so that if we were destitute of authority of the scripture, the very
light of reason would show us a more safe and waryer way.

But there is greater authority, for S. Luke in the first of the Acts shows
that Sainc^e Peter would not take upon him to present two, as fit for the
place which was void, but says, they did present or set up: whereby
appears, that the examination of their ability was committed to many. The
same apeareth also in the. 6. of the Acts, when as the Apostles will ye Church
wherein there were so excellent personages, to look out seven full of the holy
ghost and wisdom. etc. They do not there permit the discernyng of their
wisdom and other gifts to one, but to many.

Io. Whitgifte
Your first reason is partly grounded ^ppon bare conjectures, or rather The
first (...) son of T. C. has either a weak, or a false ground.
common suppositions, that may be supposed in the most perfect government,
partly upon the place Acto. 1. either not understood, or wyllingly
miscon^rued, nothing perteyning to the purpose. But first it is untrue, that
the exa^ination, either of doctrine, or life, is in this Church wholly
committed to one man: For the Book commits the examination of such as are
to be admitted into the ministry, not only to the Bishop, but to the
Archedeacon also: to the Bishop in the beginning of the Beoke by plain and
express words: to the Arched^acon, because he must present them unto the
Bishop of his knowledge, which he ran not do truly, without diligente
examination. But admit it be so, that the examination is committed to one
man only: what then? For soothe consyderyng on the one part the greatness of
the charge. etc. and of the other part the weakness of the nature of man.
etc. it is more dangerous to commit that to the vewe of one man. etc. If you
respect the greatenesse of the charge that is committed to ministsrs. The
Bishop most meet to have the examination.
etc. Who is better able to consider thereof than the Bishop, which both
knows what such a charge means, and has had himself long experience
thereof: To whom also diverse several charges do, apperteyn, for the which
it behooves him to foresee, that there be meet ministers? If you speak of
blind affections, as love, envy. etc. who may be supposed to be more void
of them, than he that is called to such an high office in the Church, that
is so well instructed in the Scriptures, of so long time known both for his
life, learning, Religion, and wisdom, meet to have that credit committed
unto him? Surely if any one man, or more, be void of such affections, and
be thought meet to have such matters committed unto him, it is the
Bishop: And if he be meet and woorthye for that place and office, then
may he also be safely credyted, with all things incidente unto the same.

But what have you here said against one man, in this case, that may^ not be
likewise said of an other man, in all other like cases? against one King, one
Judge: yea against many, even the whole multitude, in whom not only lack
of knoweledge and discretion in such matters, but great abundaunce of
affections, of wrath, of hatred, of love, of fear, of contention, etc. for
the most part reygneth, as experience of all times and places declares? But
of this matter occasion will be ministered to speak more hereafter.

The proverb, Plus vident oculi quam oculus, Many eyes see more than one, is
not always, nor in all cases true: one man of wisdom, experience, learning,
and discretion, may see more, know more, and judge better in those things
that he can skyll of, than ten thousand other that be ignorant, or that in
such matters be far inferior unto him.

You say, that almost the^ is no office of charge in this Realm. etc. which
is not so, for the offices of greatest importance and charge in the whole
Realm, both^ in the Ecclesiastical and civil state, are in the only
Election of the Prince, and they be best bestowed and upon the meetest and
woorthyest persons. Those offices that be committed to the v^yces of many,
either are bestowed of custom, or at the entreatie of some in authority, or
by extreme suite and labor made by some parties, or else is there great
contention stirred up about them by some busy bodies. And in deed when are
there more unworthy men chosen to offices, when is there more strife and
contention about elections, when do partial and sinister affections more
utter themselves, than when an election is committed to many?

And where as you say, that upon one man's report all the rest which have
interest in the election, would not give their voices so sieyghtly to any:
Experience teaches you clean contrary: for do you not see that in all such
Elections, for the most part, some one man rules the rest? Moreover, where
is the request of such as be in authority for any denied in such
elections? I could bring you a number of examples.

If the Election of the minister should be committed to every several
Parish, do you think that they would choose the meetest? should not the
Lord of the town or some other among them of countenance lead them as he
list? would they have no respect to their neighbors children, though not
the meetest? wo^ulde there be no contention among them? would they not have
like people, like Pastoure? But of this also more must be spoken in an other
place.

That in the first of the Acts, is nothing for your purpose, for there is no
order of Election prescribed, but an extraordinary calling to an
extraordinary office, as I have said before. Neither did the multitude
present them, but only the Apostles, as M. Beza says, Lib. conf. cap. 5.
titu. 35. Neither were they examyned, as is also declared: and therefore that
place altogether impertinent.

To that in the sixte of the Acts I have answered sufficientely: it proves
not examination. And M. Beza in the aforenamed book and Chapter says
plainly, that Luke has not set down what the Church did observe in the
election of Deacons: and shortly after concludes thus: Certam igitur regulam,
non est quod nimium curiose quisquam hic praescribae, sed si recta fuerit
conscientia facile fuerit pro temporum Beza lib. eonf. cap. 5.
and locorum circumstantia definire quid expediat, Therefore there is no cause
why any man should here ouer-curiously prescribe any certain rule: But if
the conscience be vpryght, it may be easy to determine, what is convenient for
the circumstance of time and place. And these words he speaks of that place
of the Acts. But I The elections Act. 1. and Act. 6. do nothing agree.
pray you answer me this one question: if you will make these two places
Act. 1 and Act. 6. rules which we must of necessity follow in electing of
ministers: how will you join them together being in nothing like? for Acto.
1. the Apostles presented two to the people, Acto. 6. The whole multitude did
present seven to the Apostles: Acto. 1. they cast lottes, Acto. 6. they laid
on hands: Acto. 1. they prayed to God to show whether of the two he had
chosen, Acto. 6. there is no such thing: Acto. 1. of two that were presented
one was chosen, Acto. 6. all were chosen that were presented: so that there is
great difference in the two places, and therefore no prescript rules for us to
follow.

Secondaryly, I can not commend it, for that, that one man is the Archedeacon,
which must examine the Pastors, and judge of their sufficiency. For what is
the Archdeacon? is he not a Deacon? for he being the chief Deacon, must
needs be also a Deacon himself. And therefore although the chief Deacon, yet
inferior to any of the Pastors: and the *gyfts which are 1. Tim. 3.
required in him, inferioure to those which are required in the Pastor, and
so to make him judge of the aptness and ablenes of the Pastor, is to make the
inferior in gifts, judge of the superior: he that has by his calling less
gifts, judge of his which has by his calling greate^ gifts, which is nothing
else, than to appoynte him that has but one eye, to ouersee his sight, that
has two.

Io. Whitgifte.
You will not stand in this reason I think, when you have something better
remembered T. C. reasons against himself.
your self: will you not have the Archdeacon, because he is but a deacon,
examine the Pastors, and judge of their sufficiency? do you think yt because
he is inferior to ye pastors, and the gifts required in him inferioure to those
which are required of the Pastors* therefore he is not meet to examine the
Pastor, and to judge of his aptness? What greater argument can be used against
your self? for if this be true, how can the people examine the pastors, or
judge of their aptness, being far inferior to Deacons, in respect of their
office, and in gifts not like unto them? or how can you admit your Seniors
to the examination or allowing of them, not only being inferior in office
and calling, but in gifts also? yea the most of them rude and ignorant, for
such Seniors you must of necessity have, if you will have any. Surely I marvel
that you have so much forgotten your self. A Deacon is superior to the
people, yea to your Seniors (though you deny it) and mo gifts required in
him than in both the other. 1. Tim. 3. Wherefore if he be not meet to examine
pastors, and judge of their sufficiency, because that were to make the
inferior in gifts to judge of the superior. etc. much less are the people and
your Seniors able to be examiners and judges in that matter.

Furthermore, if none must examine and judge of the Pastor, but such as be
superior, or at the least equal unto him, and such in whom more or as many
gifts are required, then truly I see not to whom this office may more orderly
or safely be committed than to the Bishop, who is superior to the Pastor,
both in office and also in gifts.

It is not true that the book commits the examination of ministers only to
the Archdeacons, or especially: it is otherwise in the beginning of the book
in plain words. Your reason whereby you would prove an Archdeacon to be only a
deacon, is no reason at all: for what sequel is there in this argument, an
Archdeacon is the chief deacon, Ergo he is only a Deacon? as though you were
ignorant of the state of our Church, and knew not that Archdeacons may be also
ministers of the word.

Chap. 1. the sixth Division.
T. C. Page 25. Sect. 1.
Thirdly, I mislyke the book, because it permits, ye the Bishop may admit
the minister upon the credit and report of the Archdeacon, and upon his
examination, if there be no opposition of the people: which appears by these
words in the book, whereas to the Archdeacon saying thus: Reverend father in
God, I present unto you these persons to be admitted to be Priests. etc. The
bishop answers. Take heed that ye persons whom you present unto us, be apt
and meet for their godly conversation to exercise their ministry duly to the
honor of God and edifying of his church. And thervpo^ I think it comes that
the Archdeacon is called the eye of the bishop. But why does not he himself
take heed unto it? with what conscience can he admit a minister, of whose
fitness he knows not, but upon the credit of an other, although he were
otherwise very fit? where can he have that full persuasion that he does well,
upon the report of others, when the report of his life and learning* is made
but of one. And therefore 1. Timo. 3.
Saint Paul ordained, that the same should be the ordeyners, and the
examiners, and not to hang upon the faith or report of an other man, in things
that are so weyghtie, and whereof he may himself take notice.

Io. Whitgifte.
This reason though it differ in some circumstances, yet in effect it is all
one with the second, for it is against the examination of the Archedacon, and
so was that. But your argument is not sound: for does the Bishop
therefore admit Ministers only upon the credit, and at the report of the
Archedeacon, because the Archedeacon presents them unto him? you know that
none is admitted to any degree here in Cambridge, but the same is first
presented to the Uicechancelor, and to the University, by some one of that
faculty, who gives his fidelity for them: does the University therefore
admit them only upon the credit and report of that one man? You know the
contrary: even so it is here: The Archdeacon presents to the Bishop, the
Bishop does inquyre if he has diligently examyned them. etc. does he
therefore think you, not examine them him self? I have known Bishops reiecte
those whom their Archdeacons have allowed.

If any Bishop do give that credit to his Archdeacon, he does more than I
would wish he should do, and otherwise than the book requires of him:
neither must his example done without the book, prejudice that which is
well appointed in the book.

Paul. 1. Ti. 3. declares what qualities and conditions a ^ishop ought to
have: but can you gather of any thing there written, that the same should be
the ordeyners and examiners? it is most meet it should so be I grant, but
yet would I not have the Scriptures made ship menn^s hose, to serve our
tournes as it pleases us to turn them, least we fall into that fault our
selves, which we justly reprove in the Papists.

But still you are contrary to your self, for if the same must be the ordeyners
and the examiners, T. C. contrary to himself.
then must the Bishops of necessity be the examiners, for you can not deny
but that the Bishops must be the ordeyners. And if you will have. 1. Ti. 3.
to serve your purpose, then must you of force confess it, for there Saint
Paul writes to Timothy being a Bishop, and but one man, so that this reason
is directely agay^st the first.

Chap. 1. the seventh Division.
T. C. Page. 25. Sect. 2.
Fourthly, for that albei^ the Church is demanded whether they have any thing
to obiecte, yet that Church whereof he is to be Pastor, and which it skilleth
especially that he be fit, is not demanded, and which would (because it
stands them upon) inquire diligently of him.

Io. Whitgifte.
And how would you have that Church whereof he is to be Pastor demanded
whether The absurditi^s that of necessity follow the assertion of T. C.
they have any thing to object against him? would you have every one that is to
be minister, first go and dwell among them, that they might have trial of
him? In deed so did Mathias, and Barsabas among the Apostles, and the seven
among them, by whom they were chosen Deacons. But how long shall he then
remain among them? for it had need be a good time, else shall they not
thoroughly know him, nor then neither, for he may play the hypocrite. But who
shall in the mean time bear his charges there and find him? for a number of
parishes in England be not able sufficiently to find one, much less more: Or
how shall they have any trial of his doctrine, learning and ability to
preach, seeing that he may not publicly either teach or exhort, because he
is not yet called to the ministry?

Surely I understand not how your devise could be well brought to pass,
except you will make in every parish an university, or some school of
Divinity, or College of learning, as in deed they had in most great Cities
of the old Church, where the election of ministers was committed to many: or
except you imagine, that some such may be dwelling, and continuing in every
Parish, as by inspiration or some other extraordinary means may be made able
to be their Pastor, when the place shall be void.

But tell me this one thing: would you have him that is to be chos^n their
Pastor, remain among them, they having yet a Pastor? or come unto them after
the death or departure of their Pastor, as the second Admonition would have
it Folio. 14? if the first: then must the Parish be double burdened, that
is, they must find both him that is, and him also that shall be their
pastor: moreover it is uncertain how long he must remain with them, expecting
the death or departure of the other: Likewise how he shall in the mean time
occupy himself. etc. If the second: then must they of long time be destitute
of a Pastor, for they cannot have sufficient trial of him, except also
sufficient time be granted unto them to try him in, which cannot be less
than one whole year at the least.

But admit all these impossibilities and great absurdities, to be possible
and convenient: yet are there further doubts, what if the parish be wholly or
the most part simple, ignorant, and unlearned men not able to judge? what if
they be all or the most part corrupt in religion? what if they be such, as can
be better content with one that will wink at their faults, than with him that
will reprove them? what if they be such, as will be ouerruled with some one,
whom they dare not displease? To be short, what if they cannot agree among
themselves, upon some one, but be divided i^to factions. etc? All these things
being considered, you shall find it the fittest, and best way, that the Bishop,
even according to the form prescribed in the book, have authority to admit
and allow of such as are to be ministers. Would you have him that is brought
up in the university, and well known in all respects to be meet for the
ministry, to whom also a cure in some place of Westmerland is to be
committed, to be kept from the same, because he is unknown unto them? Let
other men think of your de^ises as they list, in my judgment they be mere
phansies and fond dreams, grounded neither upon the word of God, neither yet
of any other good consideration. Sure I am that they are contrary to the
practice of reformed Churches, and namely the Churches of Berne and Tygure. As
M. Musculus reports in his common places titu. de ministris verbi. And M.
Bullinger. 1. Tim. 4.

Touching this supposition of yours, that none should be admitted into the
ministry except Tra^t. 4. c^p. ^
the same have some certain cure committed unto him, occasion will be given to
speak in another place.

Chap. 1. the. 8. Division.
T. C. Page 25. Sect. 3. 4.
Again, they are demanded, which can object nothing of his insufficiency,
whom for the most part they never see nor heard of before, as one that came
of one day unto the town, and goes away the next.

Further, they have no reasonable space given them, wherein they may inquire or
hearken out of his honest conversation: and have some experience of his
soundness in teaching, and discretion and judgment to rule his flock. But if
as soon as ever it be said, that those that are strangers to them should
object against them, no man stand forth to oppose against them, forthwith he
is made a minister. And these are those things wherein I think the book of
ordering ministers faulty, touching the trial and examination of the
ministers, which selfsame things, are likewise of the trial of the Deacon.
And so you see, that besides the faults of those that execute the law, that
there be faults in the laws themselves, and therefore the cause is truly
assigned, although you see it not.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is none that ought to be admitted by any Bishop, but such as have dwelte
and remained in his dioces a convenient time: No time of admitting (except it
be of some singular person whose ability is not doubted of) is appointed, but
the same is before a sufficient time notifyed in the notablest places of the
whole dioces, chiefly to this end and purpose, that there may be resort
thither by such as have any thing to object against any that is to be
admitted at that time into the ministry: neither ought any to be admitted
except he bring a sufficient testimonial of his good behauioure from that
place, where he has had his abode: and therefore if they come not, it is a
token that they have nothing to say: or if they have to object, and do not, the
fault is in themselves, they may if they will.

I told you before, that he may not teach before he be thereunto admitted, nor
rule a flock before he have one committed unto him, and therefore of
necessity he must at the least be admitted into the ministry of the word,
before they can give any judgment of him. So that in deed though you have
used many words, yet have you in effect said little or nothing: and the
slenderness of your reasons against the book, together with the
inconueni^nces that must of necessity follow, has procured a great credit
unto it: and it still remains true, that I have answered to the Admonition,
that is, that the fau^ts that be, are in the persons, not in the law.

Chap. 1. the. 9. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 37. Lin. 1.
Again, if some be admitted into the ministry, either void of learning, or
lewd in life, are all the rest for their sake to be condemned? Or is this a
good argument, some be admitted into the ministry without trial, therefore
none is lawfully admitted into the ministry? or some ministers be unlearned
and evil, Ergo, there is none good? I think you will not deny, but that there
is now within this Church of England, as many learned, godly, grave, wise, and
worthy Worthy ministers in England.
ministers of the word, as there is in any one realm or particular Church in
all Christendom, or ever has bin heretofore.

T. C. Page. 25. Sect. 5. 6. 7.
And what mean you, still to use this fighting with your own shadow? for
where are the words, or what be they that condemn all the ministers for some?
that say all the ministers are unlawfully admitted, for some? or that there is
none good, because some are bad? If there be no such words, as carry with
them any such sense, then you do wrong to your brethren. If there be words that
declare the clean contrary, then all men see what you be, which although you
often fault in, yet I am loath so often to name and charge you with it. When it
is said, that learned and unlearned are received, it is evident that they
condemn not all.

The Lord bless and increase an hundredth fold the godly, wise, learned, grave
ministers of this Church, and because these words seem to rock us asleep,
and to bring us into forgetfulness of the great ruins and desolations of the
Church, I must tell you that two thousand able and sufficient ministers, which
preach and feed diligently and carefully the flock of Christ, were hard to be
found in this Church, which have bin notwithstanding found in the Church of
France, by the estimation of those which know the estate, even under the time
of the cross, where there were no such helps of Magistrates, and appointed
stipends, as God be praised we have.

And again, you are to be put in mind, that a great number of those were
bredde in king Edwards days, so that I fear me a man need no great
Arithmetike to count the numbers of such able ministers, as the late years
have brought forth. And yet I am well assured, that if the ministry were
reformed, and worthy men were sought for, there are great numbers of zealous
and learned men, that would lay their hands to serve this kind of building by
the ministry. For besides numbers that the universities would yield, which
sighe for the repairing of the decays of the Church, to help forward so
great a work, the Innes of Court, and other the Gentry of the Realm,
Galene, and Justinian, would bring their tenthes, and (as it were) pay their
shot in this reckening.

Io. Whitgifte.
Their words be plain, for they say whereas in the old Church a trial was
had. etc. now by the letters commendatorie of some one man. etc. whereby they
set this time as contrary unto that, because some have bin admitted without
trial: and therefore make that fault general, which is particular, and in
very deed condemn all for some. If it were not so, why should either they or
you condemn the rule, and not the persons only? why should they say that we
have no right ministry? why should the second Admonition from the beginning
to the end, so rail upon all the states and degrees of ministers and preachers
in this Church, which do not consent with them in disturbing the Church, and
opposing themselves against lawful orders and laws. Look Fol. 32. of the. 2.
Admonition especially, and so forth, where they speak in most unchristian
manner. And though these me^ in this place say learned and unlearned, yet does
it not follow that they condemn not all, of an unlawful calling, and of not
being tried, and examined as well in life, as learning. But what need you make
such ado in cloking a matter to notorious? for what do either they or you, but
deface even the best learned, and wisest of such as withstand you: thinking
none sufficiently learned, but yourselues and your adherents?

For the number of sufficient ministers in France, able to preach in the time
of the cross, I will not take upon me to define any thing: yet have I talked
with some wise, godly, and learned preachers of that country, such as had good
cause to know the state of that Church touching that matter: and truly for any
thing that I can learn of them, you have ouershot your self in reckening at
the least. 14. hundredth. But I am not curious in matters not apperteyning unto
me, and I write but of credible report. God be thanked for the number that
they had, or have, how many or how few soever they are.

Touching the number of preachers throughout England, I cannot write any
certainty, but of this University because I have some experience, you shall
give me leave to speak as earnestly in truly commending of it, as you have
done in untruly and unkindly defacing and slaundering it. The number of known
preachers, which this university has bredde since the beginning of the
Queens Majesty's reygne to this time of the year of our Lord Anno. 1573. are
at the least. 450. besides those that have bin called to that office after
their departure from hence, and are not yet known to me. The number of
preachers that be now in this University remaining is. 102. and no doubt but
God will increase the number of them daily more and more. Although The
contentions in the Church is an hindrance to the profession of diumitie, in the
universities.
it must be confessed, that the factions and tumults which you and some others
have made in the Church, do discourage a great number from the ministry,
causes many to contemn it, and think the calling to be unlawful, and
therefore to absteyne from it. Moreover I know by experience, that some of you
devise and practice by all means possible, to stir up contention in this
University, to dissuade men from the ministry, to bring such as be sober,
wise, learned and godly preachers into contempt, and to make a confusion, and
divide every College within itself. But howsoever hitherto you have prevailed
(as you have prevailed to much) yet I trust you shall never thoroughly bring to
pass that which you desire. And I doubt not, but that your undutiful,
uncivil, and uncharitable dealing in this your book, your many errors and
foul absurdities contained in the same, has so detected you, that honest,
discreet, quiet, and godly learned men will no more be withdrawn by you, and
such as you are, to any such schism or contention in the Church: but rather
bend them selves against the common adversary, and seek with heart and mouth
to build up the walls of Jerusalem, which you have broken down: and to fill
up the Mines that you have dug, by craft and subteltie to overthrow the
same. And howsoever some will still be way wardly disposed, yet I doubt not,
but that if such as be in authority will do their duties, they may by
convenient discipline, either be kept within the bonds of modesty, or else
removed from this place, wherein of all other places, they may do most harm.

For the Innes of Court what they would do I know not, howbeit I think very few
have gone from this place thither, which had ever any purpose in them, to enter
into the ministry. And surely from that place where I am, I have not known
any go to the Innes of Court, in whom there has appeared any kind of
inclination to the ministry. What store of fit preachers those Innes would
yield, if your Church were framed, I know not, but I think, that some of the^
would not refuse the spoil of this. I doubt not but that there are many in the
Innes of Court well affected in religion: God continue them and increase the
number of them, and give them grace to take heed that they be not seduced by
overmuch credulity in themselves, and pretensed zeal in others.

What Galene and Justinian would do, may be doubted, for, though both Galene
and Justinian have forsaken our ministry, yet do they keep such livings as
they had in the respect of the same, and are so far from yelding of tenthes,
that they can be well content to receive tenthes.

Touching letters commendatorie of some one mannoble or other, Letters
commendatorie of wise and godly men.
it may be that the parties which give these letters be of that zeal,
learning, and godliness, that their particular testimony ought to be better
credited, than some other subscribed with an hundred hands. And I think there
is both noble men and other, who may better be trusted in that point, than a
great number of parishes in England, which consist of rude and ignorant men,
easily moved to testify any thing: And in many places for the most part, or
altogether, drowned in Papistrie. I know no reason to the contrary, and I see
no scripture alleged, why one learned, godly and wise man's testimony, may not
be reteiued in such a case, and yet the book expresses no such thing, The
b^oke ^quireth due examination of life and learning.
but requires due examination of learning, and sufficient testimonial of
conversation, and gives liberty to any one particular man, to object any
crime against any such as are to be ordered, and wills that the party
accused be kept from the ministry until he have cleared himself of the
crimes objected. If tag and rag be admitted, learned and unlearned, it is the
fault of some, not of all, nor of the law: And if they were called and elected
according to your fantasy, there would some creep in, as evil as any be now,
and worse too,

T. C. Page. 26. Lin. 8.
It is not denied, but the testimony that a noble man which professes the
truth does give, ought to be weighed according to his degree, and place which
he has in the commonwealth, but where you think, that the testimony of one
wise man, learned, and godly, is sufficient warrant to proceed to an election
of a Minister, you considered not well the circumspection which S. Paul used,
who when he admitted Timothy into his company, to be a companion in his
journey, to cut off all occasion of evil speech, received him not*but upon
commendation of the brethren, both in Lystra Act. 1^.
and Iconium.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know that the testimony of many godly and wise men, is of more weight, than
the testimony of one only, but this is no answer to that which I have said.
The place of Paul and Timothy Act. 16. declares how well Timothy was
thought of, and commended unto Paul, but it follows not, that Paul would
not also have received him, if he had bin commended unto him but by some one.

signify that Paul would not have taken him with him, unless they had al
given such testimony of him, neither can there be any such sense truly

You say that there be admitted into the ministry of the basest sort of the
people: I know not what you mean by the basest sort: this I am sure of, that
the ministry is not now bound to any one tribe, as it was to the tribe of
Leui, in Ieroboams time: now none is secluded from that function of any degree,
state, or calling, so that those qualities be found in him, which in that
office are to be required.

T. C. Page. 26. Lin 14.
You know they meant by the basest of the people, such as gave but one leap
out of the shop into the Church, as suddenly are changed out of a serving man's
coat, into a ministers cloak, making for the most part, the ministry their
last refuge. etc. And seeing that besides the words be plain, the daily
experience teaches it, you need not make it so strange, as though you knew
not what they meant.

Io. Whitgifte.
I hear you say so, but why did they then quote the. 1. Reg. 1^. (...). 3^.
that manifestly proves the same sense that I have gathered of their words, and
that text only occasioned me so to do.

I marvel to what purpose the twelfth chapter of the first book of kings is
here quoted, for Jeroboam is there reproved because he took the priesthood
from the tribe of Leui, to the which only it did apperteyne.

at the ignorance of the ministers (for they have of themselves those that be
as ignorant and more) as they do at your schisms and fond opinions, wherewith
you disquiet the peace of the Church, and lay stumbling blocks before the

The second chapter to the Romans is here quoted only to painte the margent.

The second. In those days (...). 5. 4. (...)* 44. 10. 12. 13. Ierem. 23.
no Idolatrous sacrificers of Heathenish priests were appointed to be Preachers
of the Gospel: but we allow and like well of Popish massemongers, me^ for all
seasons, King Henry's priests, king Edwards Priests, Queen Mary's Priests,
who of a truth if Gods word were precisely followed, should from the same be
utterly removed.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 38. Sect. vlt.
The place in the fifth chapter of the Hebrews quoted in the margent, speaks
nothing of Idolatrous sacrificers or heathenishe Priests, but only by the
example of Aaron proves, that no man ought to intrude himself into the office
of a Bishop or Priest, except he be called of God. Lord how dare these men thus
wring the scriptures? In the 23. of the Prophet Jeremy there is much spoken
against false prophets, but not one word (for any thing that I see) to prove
that idolatrous sacrificers may not be admitted to preach the Gospel.

Io. Whitgifte.
To this is nothing answered.

The places of the 44. of Ezechiell have some show in them, for there the Lord
commands the Levites which had committed Idolatry to be put from their
dignity, and not to be received into the priests office, but to serve in
inferioure ministeries.

I think you will not make this a general rule to debar such from
preaching of the Gospel, as have through infirmity fallen, and be now with
hearty repentance returned. We have many examples to the contrary, Peter
forswore his master Christ, which was as evil Peter's forswearing.
as sacrificing to Idols, and yet he was not put from his Apostleship. We have
diverse examples in the Primitive Church, of such as by fear being compelled
to sacrifice to strange gods, after repented, and kept still the office of
preaching the Gospel, and did most constantly die in the same.

T. C. Page. 26. Sect. 1.
What ought to be general, if this ought not, to put the minister that has
bin an Idolater, from his ministry? is it not a commandment of God, and
given, not of one Leuite or two, but of all 2. Cha. 23.
those that went back, not at one time, but at others also, when the like
occasion was given, as appears in the book of the kings, where all the
priests of the Lord that had sacrificed in the high places, were not suffered
to come to the altar in Jerusalem? Does not S. Paul make smaller 1. Tim. 3.
causes of deposing from the ministry than Idolatry? For after he has
described what manner of men the ministers should be, and Deacons, he adds:
And being tried, S Paul his words and meaning falsisyed.
let them execute their functions, as long as they remain blameless: I think
if so be a man had bin known to be an adulterer, although he repented him, yet
none that is well advised, would take him into the ministry: for if S. Paul
reject him that had. ij. wives at once (which was a thing that the Jews and
Gentiles thought lawful, and that was common amongst them, and had prevailed
throughout all the world) how much less would he suffer any to be admitted to
the ministry, which should be an adulterer, and have another man's wife, which
is condemned of all that profess the name of Christ, and which is not so
general a mischief as that was, and suffer him to abide in the ministry,
which should commit such wickedness during his function, and likewise of a
murderer, now the sin of Idolatry is greater and more detestable, than any
of them, in as much as perteyning to the first table, it immediately stayneth
Gods honor, and breaks duty to him, unto whom we more owe it (without
all comparison) than to any mortal man. And if S. Paul in the choice of the
widow to attend upon the sick of the Church, which was the lowest office in
the Church, requires not only such a one as is at the time of the choice,
honest and holy, but such a one as had led her whole life in all good works,
and with commendation, how much more is that to be observed in the minister or
bishop of the Church, that he be not only at the time of his choice, but all
other times before such a one, as had lived without any notable, and open
offense of those, amongst whom he had his conversation.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is not such a commandment as must of necessity be perpetually kept, and
The place 44. Ezechi. touching Idolatrous sacrificers is not perpetual

not perpetual Ira. 2. cap. 6. diuis. 5. Ezech. 44.
as I have before proved. Moreover why should this precept rather be
perpetual, than that which goes before, that no stranger uncircumcised in
heart, and uncircumcised in flesh should enter into the sanctuary? or than that
which follows, that the Priests when they enter in at the gates, must be
elothed with white linen. etc: Do not the circumstances of the place best
declare the meaning of it? The like also is to be said to that example. 2.

The place of S. Paul. 1. Tim. 3. is untruly by you alleged, and corruptly

for the words of the Apostle be not as you report them: and being tried let
them execute their functions, as long as they remain blameless: But thus the
Apostle says and let them first be proved, then let them minister being
blameless: the greek word is (...), that is, if in trial they be found
blameless, then let them minister. For trial may be had whether they be
blameless or no, but not whether they will so remain. Moreover the Apostle in
that place speaks of Deaco^s, and not of ministers. I marvel what you mean
so manifestly to falsify the words of the scripture, or to what purpose you
have invented this new translation, except it be to justify that error of the
Anabaptists, that the virtue of the word, and of the Sacraments does depend
upon the good life of the Minister. Certain it is that you have neither
greek, latin, nor English text that does so translate it. Neither do^he (...)
Apostle S. Paul there speak of deposing ministers, or deacons, but of
electing (...), as it is manifest. I doubt not, but that a whoremonger after he
has repented him (if other things be correspendent) may be admitted to the
ministry, even as well, as Peter after his denial, was admitted to be an
Apostle, or Paul after that he had been a persecutor. Saint Paul would not,
that a Bishop should have two wives at once, but he does not seclude him from
being a Bishop that has had two wives: except you will establishe in this
place the Papishe bigamie. In like manner he would not have an whoremo^ger, a
drunkard, a covetous person to be chosen a Bishop: yet does he not seclude from
that function such, as have been guilty of these crimes (and now of godly
conversation) for their former offenses: for then should he deal otherwise
with them, than he himself was dealt with: neither have you any example in the
new testament of any deposed from their ministry, though they were found in
many things guilty. Christ knew that Judas was a traitor, yet did he not
depose him from his Apostleship: he knew that the Scribes and Phariseis were
criminous in diverse points, yet did he will them to be taken, and heard as gods
ministers when he said in cat^edra Mosis sedent Scribae. etc. the Scribes and
Phariseis sit in Moses seat. etc. Mat. 23. And S. Paul knew Math. 23.

not will their ministry to be taken from them, but showed himself to be very
glad for their Phil. 1.
labor and travel taken in preaching the Gospel. Phi. 1.

unto it, which so alters and changes a man through the mercy of God, be he
never so defiled, that it makes him pure and clean: and shall we seclude him
from ministering unto God, that is pure in the sight of God? or shall we not
think him to be a meet minister in the visible Church, that is a member of
the unvisible, and elect Church? In the old law there were many things that
defiled the body, and made the man for a time unclean, but now all such things
are clean to those that be clean. In Tit. ^.
like manner there were then certain crimes pertaining to the mind, which
could not be expiated but by corporal punishment, but repentance is a medicine
for all, and the greatest Idolater truly repenting, may become a more zealous
preacher, tha^ he that in the sight of the world, never committed the least
offense.

S. Paul in the choice of widows does not require such a one as has led her
whele life in all good works: for how could that be at that time, when they
had but in one part of their life known Christ, and professed the Gospel,
being thereunto converted by the Apostles: but his meaning is, that such be
chosen, as were known to have been diligent in all good works, that is, to
have been liberal and beneficial toward the poor, for so does M. Calvin
interpret it: if you would have none chosen to be ministers, but such as have
all their life time been blameless, I think you are like to have but a few,
and more like to refuse such as be very meet and fit for that function. But
as the Apostle would not have any admitted to the ministry upon a sudden
trial or conversion, so does he not appoint for the same, the whole former
time of man's life, but a reasonable and sufficient time, such as may suffice
for the trial of a man in such matters.

Chap. 2. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 26. Sect. 2. 3 and Page 27. Sect. 1.
If I should stand with you, whether Peter his forswearing that he knew not
Christ, were a greater fault then to go from the Gospel to Idolatry, and
therein, for some long space to continue, as the Levites did, I should trouble
you. For if a man suddenly and at a pushe for fear, and to save his life, say
and swear he is no Christian, and the same day repent him of his fault,
although it be a great and heinous crime, yet it seems not to be so great, as
his is, which not only denies Christ in words, but does it also in decdes,
and worshippeth Antichrist, and continues in that worship, not a day, but
months, and years.

But I will answer you, that even as our savior Christ called S. Paul in the
heat of his persecution, and when he was a blasphemer unto the Apostleship, so
he having the law in his own hands, and making no laws for himself, but
for us, might call S. Peter also to that function, which had thrice denied him.

But as it is not lawful for us, to follow the example of Christ in calling of
Paul, by admitting those which are new converted, having a contrary precepte
given, that no (*) new plant, or green 1. Tim. 3.
Christian, should be taken to ye Ministry: So is it not lawful also, to
follow that example of our Savior Christ, the contrary being commanded, as I
have before alleged. For albeit the examples of our Savior Christ be to be
followed of us, yet if there be commaundtmentes general to the contrary, then
we must know, that it is our parts to walk in the broad and beaten way, as
it were the common caussie of the commandment, rather than an outpath of the
example.

Io. Whitgifte.
Peter having before bragged of his constancy, lately admonished by his
Master Christ, almost eue^ in ye presence of his master, wittingly and
willingly denied, not once, but thrice, yea bitterly forswore him: which fault
no doubt was as grievous as any kind of Idolatry: and therefore if you stand
with me in that matter never so long, you can not greatly trouble me. for the
circumstances being considered, there is nothing to exeuse Peter's denial.

As Christ in the heat of Paul's persecution, did choose him to be an Apostle,
and called Peter also to that function, after he had thrice denied him, even so
does he still continue his mercy, neither is it one whit streightened: and
these examples has he set before us that we should at no time despair of his
mercy and goodness: so says S. Paul 1. Tim. 1. Verum ideo misericordiam
consecutus sum. etc. Notwithstanding, for this cause was I 1. Tim. 1.
received to mercy, that Jesus Christ should first show on me al long
suffering, unto the example of them, which shall in time to come believe in him
unto eternal life.

Although these examples of our savior Christ are not at all times, and in all
points to be followed, yet do they sufficiently declare, that no man for any
crime is to be secluded from any lawful vocation, if he repent him and become
a new man. And there be no general commandments contrary hereunto, but this
doctrine is consonant to the whole course of the Gospel.

estimation and credit he had amongst the people, but besides that I have
showed, that such things are unlawful being forbidden, the errors and corrupt
expounding of scriptures, which are found in his works, declare that it had
been more safe for the Church, if by study of the scriptures, he had first
been a scholar of divinity, or ever he had been made Doctor.

Io. Whitgifte.
You needed not to have wyped away the example of Ambrose, with so much
disgracing of him, being so worthy a man, and so learned a father: for though
he were not christened when he was chosen Bishop, yet had he long before that
time professed the name of Christ, and was soundly grounded in Religion: for in
those days many did long differ the time of Baptism after the time of their
conversion. And S. Paul 1. Tim. 3. by his green Christian as you term him,
does understand such as be newly converted. Ambrose was a man of notable
learning, and singularly commended in all histories that make any mention of
him: his errors be not so many, nor his expositions so simple, that you should
so contemptuously write of him.

^here may be more examples showed out of that which you call the Primitive
Church, to the (...) of that which you say. For when they used oftentimes
against those that had so feign, such severity (in deed extreme and
excessive) that they were never after, until their deaths admitted to the
Lords table: I leave to you to think whether they would then suffer any such
to execute the function of the ministry. Besides that S. Cyprian has also a
special treatise of this, that those that have sacrificed to Idols should not
be permitted any more to minister in the Church, in the first book of his
Epist. Epistle. vij.

Io. Whitgifte.
It appears in that. 7. Epistle of Cyprian, that he meant of such as after
they had sacrificed to Idols, took their ministry again upon them, without
any signification or show of repentance, but rather justifying, or at the
least excusing their former fact. And that this was Cypria^s meaning, it may
be gathered by these words in the same Cypri. lib. ^. Epist. 7.
Epistle, which he speaks to the people to whom he writ, touching
Fortunatianus, who having sacrificed to Idols would have again resumed his
ministry: Ergo contumaces, and deum non timentes, and ab ecclesia in totum
recedentes, nemo comitetur. Quod si quis impatiens fuerit ad deprecandum
dominum, qui offensus est, and nobis obtemperare noluerit, sed desperatos and
perditos secutus fuerit, sibi imputabit cum iudicij dies venerit. Wherefore let
no man keep company with those which are stubborn, not fearing God, and wholly
depart from the Church: But if any will not ask forgiveness at the Lord,
which is offended, and will not obey us, but will needs follow them which are
disperate and paste hope, he shall lay the blame on none but on him self at
the day of judgment. Whereby it is plain, that Cypria^ meant such, as had wholly
departed from the Church, and were desperate in wickedness. It is manifest
that in Cyprians time, those that did offend in such crimes and afterward
repented, were appointed a time of public repentance, according to the
quality of the fault committed, and until that time was expired, they were
not admitted unto the Lords table, except only at the point of death.

But I grant that there was extreme severity in Cyprians time showed to
such, as had fallen in the time of pesecution, and that it evidently appears
in other of his Epistles, that such were no more admitted to the ministry.
But this law was made by Cyprian and others as it is evident Lib. 2. Epist. 1.
in that Council of Carthage where it was also concluded that such as were
baptized of heretics should be rebaptized, and therefore of the less force,
seeing that that whole Council is for inst causes rejected.

I pray you what say you to M. Luther, Bucer, Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, etc.

instruments of promoting the Gospel and preaching the same? whereof many have
given testimony by sheding their blood.

And by whose Ministry especially has the Gospel been published, and is as
yet in this Church of England, but by such as have been Massemongers, and now
zealous, godly, and learned preachers.

T. C. Page 27. Sect. 2. 3.
But you ask what they say to M. Luther, Bucer, Cranmer, Latimer, Rid^ey? I
pray you when did these excellent personages, ever slide from the Gospel unto
Idolatry? which of them did ever say Mass, after God had opened them the
truth? what has so Even the A^monition which I confu^e, for it speaks
generally and makes no such distinct^
blinded you, that you can not distinguishe and put a difference, between one
that having been noussed from his youth up in Idolatry, comes afterward
out of it, and between him, which having knowledge of the Gospel afterward
departs from it, and of such is the place of Ezechiel, of such I say, as have
gone back and fallen away.

I know none, that have been Preachers of the Gospel, and after in the time
of Queen Mary Massemongers, which now are zealous, godly, and learned
preachers, and if there be any such I think for offense sake, the Church
might better be without them, than have them. You say God in that place
shows how grievous a sin Idolatry is, in the Priests especially: And is
it not now more grievous in the Minister of the Gospel, whose function is
more precious, and knowledge greater? and if the sin be greater, should it
have now a less punishment, than it had then? how shall the fault be
esteemed great or little, but by the greatness or smalnesse of the
punishment? you said before, the places of Deuteronomie, touching adding and
diminishing nothing from that which the Lord commands, were for the Jews,
and are not for our times. And this commandment of God in Ezechiel, you say
served for that time, and not for ours.

Io. Whitgifte.
The examples of M. Luther, Bucer, Cranmer. etc. do sufficiently confute the
Admonition, The examples of Luther. etc. are directly against the Admonition.
the words whereof be these: In those days no Idolatrous sacrificers or
heathenish priests were appointed to be preachers of the Gospel: but we allow
and like well of Popish Massemongers, men for all seasons, king Henry's
priests. etc. here you see, that they do not only condemn such as once
knowing the truth, have afterward departed from it, but such also as have at
any time sacrificed: why should they else name king Henry's priests, seeing it
is evident that the mass was not abolished in King Henry's time? so that I
have better cause to ask, what has so blinded you that you could not
understand their meaning, the words being so plain? or rather that you would
in that point wilfully blind your self, and others also? I know some that being
preachers of the Gospel, and after in the time of Queen Mary massemongers,
which now are zealous, godly and learned preachers, and of as good fame and
credit with godly men, as any be in this land (without offense be it spoken)
neither be the quiet and humble members of the Church offended with them, but
rejoice at their conversion, and praise God for them.

But you frame your doctrine according to your affection toward certain
persons, Doctrine framed according to men's persons.
as ye manner now a days of some is: for this doctrine has been taught
generally, that no Idolatrous priest should remain in the ministry: and these
examples of Luther, Bucer. etc. have been lightly rejected, as repugnant to the
conunaundement of God: but now being better advised, and remembering that some
in that case be great promoters of your opinions, this mitigation forsooth must
be made, that such as were preachers in king Edwards time. etc. they (I mean
your fautors) were professors, though they were no preachers, they were also in
Queen Mary's time Massemo^gers, and now they be preachers, and yet all is
well: for you have the law in your hands, to coin what opinions you list, to
add to them, or to take from them, what you list, to apply and not apply them,
to whom and when you list, even Popelike.

The sin of Idolatry is now as great an offense as it was then, but the
external and civil punishment for the same, is in the power of the Magistrate,
being a portion of Tract. 2. cap. 6. the. 5. division.
the judicial law, the necessity whereof is wholly abrogated, as I have proved
before.

Those precepts in Deuteronomy. were given to the Jews, both for the judicial and
ceremonial law also: they be given to us for the law of faith and good manners
only: for we are clearly delivered from the ceremonies of the law: and the
judicials (whereof this in Ezechiel is a portion) are not enjoined to
Christians, upon any necessity, but left to the discretion of the civil
Magistrate. And therefore I have said nothing, either of those places of Deuteronomy.
or of this of Ezech. which I will not by learning and good authority justify.

You work a sure way, which to maintain your corruptions, deny the
scripture, which speaks against them, to be understood of those which be in
our time, and that to be understood of our ministers, which was of theirs, or
of our faults, which was of theirs. This is not the way to Anabaptisme, but to
all heresies, and schisms, that ever have been or shall be. For if you go
forward in clipping the scripture, as you begin, you will leave us nothing in
the end, wherewith we may either defend our selves against heretics, or be able
to strike at them.

Io. Whitgifte.
I neither deny the scriptures, nor clip them, neither can my doctrine open
the way to any heresy: but I speak of them in this point as all learned and
sound writers do, old or new: if I do not, disprove me, not by words, but
by reasons and authorities.

Besides this, there is a great difference betwixt the severity of the law,
and the lenity of the Gospel, betwixt the external regiment of the Church
before Christ, and the Church after Christ, neither can you make the one in all
points correspondent to the other: Likewise betwixt the declining of those
Priests, which was wholly from God to Gentilitie, and the falling of ours to
Papistrie, which confesses the same articles of faith that we do, although
not sincerely. It is one thing wholly to worship false Gods, an other thing to
worship the true God falsely and superstitiously. But among all other things I
would gladly know wherein king Edwards priests have offended you? It is
happy you let Queen Elizabeth's priests alone. I marvel whose priests you are?

T. C. Page 27. Sect. 5. 6.
Whereas you say, there is a great difference between the severity of the law
and lenity of the Gospel, me thinks I smell a spice of the error of the
Maniches, which were also scholars in that behalf of the old heretic Cerdon,
that there is a good and an evil, a gentle, and a severe God, one under the
law, and an other under the Gospel. For to say that God was then a severe
punisher of sin, and that now he is not at so great hatred with it, but that
he will have it gentlyer and softlyer dealte with: is even al one in effect
with that, which supposes two Gods. I will join with you in it, that the
transgressions of the law, in the time of the Gospel, ought rather to be
seuerelier punished, than they were under the law, for as much as the
knowledge is greater, and the abundance of the spirit of God, whereby the laws
are kept is more plentiful, than under the law.

At this time I will content me with the place of Zachary The place of Zach.
missev^derstoode.
which prophesying of the kingdom Cap. 13.

mother of the false Prophet shall cause their own son to be put to death.

Io. Whitgifte.
My opinion touching the severity of the law and lenity of the Gospel,
Difference betwixt the seueretie of the law and the lenity of the Gospel.
is farther from the error of the Maniches, than yours is from the Turks or
Jews. I know God is as severe a punisher of sin now, as he was then, but the
manner and kind of corporally punishing it, is not the same now, that it was
then: Neither will I refuse to join with you in this, that Christian
Magistrates are not bound to the judicial laws of Moses, touching the kind
and manner of punishing sin: and yet is not this to extenuate sin one whit,
but the contrary rather, as Cyrill does note in his. 11. book upon Leuiticus,
where he shows a reason why adultrie, and other crimes were commanded in the
law to be punished with corporal death, and not in the Gospel, which reason
fully answers your objection, Quid igituridicemus quod lex Mosi crudelis est.
etc. what then? shall we say that the law of Moses is cruel, which commands
that the adulterer, and adultresse should be punished: and that the Gospel of
Christ through indulgence and pardon, makes the hearers the worsse? it is not
so: for to this purpose did we bring in that saying of Paul before: how much
more is he worthy of more grievous punishment, which treads under feet the
Son of GOD. etc. Hear therefore how neither the law was then cruel,
neither yet the Gospel is now dissolute, for the greatness of forgyuenesse:
but in both, though diuersely, the loving kindness of GOD remains. This,
that is according to the law (as for example, that the Adulterer and
Adultresse wear punnyshed with present death) for so much as both of them
have suffered punishment for their sin, and have received due reward for the
wickedness which they committed: what reuengement shall afterward hang over
their souls, if they have committed no other fault, if there is no other
sin, which may condemn them, but only have committed this fact, and for the
same have received the punishment due by the law? The Lord will not punish
one thing twice, for they have received the reward for their sin, and the
pain for their offense is finished. And for this cause is not this kind of
commandment cruel (as the heretics affirm, accusing the law of God, and
denying that there is any kind of humanity in it) but it is full of mercy:
because hereby the people should rather be purged from their sins, than
condemned. But now there is no punishment laid upon the body, nor any purging
of sin, through corporal punishment, but through repentance, which if a man
do worthily work, so that he may seem worthy to have the punishment
withdrawn, he may find forgiveness. But howsoever this answer of Cyrill,
may in some points minister occasion of quarrelling to such as be disposed,
yet this is evident, that the quantity of sin and the heynousnesse of it, is
not to be esteemed according to the corporal and external punishmente, but
according to the commandment of God, to the which it is repugnant, and
according to the threatenings of God in the scriptures pronounced against the
same, for we see that lesser faults are by man punished with greater torments,
even according to the state of every country. And this smells not one whitte
of the Manichees heresy, but the clean contrary. Neither do I make this
difference betwixt the severity of the law, and lenity of the Gospel, in any
other respect, than of temporal punishment appointed in the law.

The place of Zachary does not make for your purpose, except you will give to

liberty for one private man to kill another. The prophet in that place
declares what zeal shall be in the people against false prophets, and how much
they shall prefer the true Religion of God before their own natural
affection, and rather forsake their children yea hate them, and kill them, than
by their means, they should be withdrawn from God: this is the true meaning
of that place. If you will refer it to the time of the Gospel. But if you
will apply it to the Israelites to whom this prophet now preaches and
prophecieth, then does he declare unto them what zeal and feruencie. God
requires in them, if they truly repent them of their former Idolatry: even
that they shall not spare their own children, but deal with them according to
the law Deu. 13. ver. 6. etc. M. Luther expounding this place and referring it
to the time of the Gospel Luther.
says thus: Et est haec sententiae summa. etc. The su^me hereof is, that
Christians shall retain, and defend true and pure doctrine, without respect of
any person, whether it be his kinsman, or friend, for it is necessary that
there should be false doctrine, and heresies, that the truth might be tried,
but yet they shall not have the upper hand, or prevail. And interpreting
these words) his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through
when he prophesies) he says, id est, non ferreis aut aereis armis and gladijs
ipsum conficient, sed verbo Dei, erit enim spirituale and suaue certamen, quale
est parentum cum suis liberis, sicut and diuus Paulus Corinthios confodit, and
ipsorum errores verbo Dei reprehendit. That is to say, they shall destroy him
not with Iron or brazen armor and weapons, but with the word of God: for the
strife shall be spiritual and pleasant, such as is between parents and
their Children, like as Saint Paul does pearce through the Corinthians, and
reprehendeth their errors by the word of God.

But would you in deed conclude of this place, that those which have taught
The bloody assertion of T. C.
false doctrine must of necessity be putto death, though they repent? yea
that their own parents and friends must kill them, or cause them to be
killed, and not rather receive them willingly, if they will convert, and
embrace them most joyfully? undoubtedly, the Prophet has no such meaning:
neither have you any example of such extremity committed by a true Christian
toward a repentant Idolater, from the nativity of Christ unto this hour:
neither is there any thing in the whole new Testamente, whereby any such
fact can be warranted. And howesoeuer this place may make, for the severe
punishyng of stubborn and perverse Idolaters, it makes nothing at all for
such as repent and be converted: and therefore it may be, that this place of
Scripture does content you, but surely it can not persuade any that duly
considers it, that Idolaters though they repent, may not be received both
to mercy, and also into the ministry.

And if any man shall think that I wring his words against his meaning, let
him consider against whom he bends his force, and urges this place of
Zachary (that is, against them which have fallen, and have bin Massemongers,
and now are none, but preachers of the Gospel) and he shall easily perceive
both the blo^dinesse of his opinion, and also that I have not herein dealt
unfaithfully. Surely (al circumstances considered) it is not unlike that this
has been some occasion of the mischeeuons attempt which of late has been
put in practice.

It is as absurd which is brought, to prove that the Papists which worship

godly new writers, which do resute this distinction being brought of the
Papists, as a shifte to prove that the Idolatry which is forbidden in the
old Testament, touches not them, because they worship God by these things,
and the Idolatrous Jews and Infidels, worshipped nothing else, nor looked at
nothing else, than the bare things before which they fell down. Which self
same distinctiou you bring to prove, that Papistrie is not so detestable, as
the Idolatry of the Jews. It may be, that certain of the Gentiles worshipped

Jupiter and Juno. etc. But you can not show, that the Israelites ever
worshipped any other god, than the true God, so that their fault was only, in
that they worshipped him otherwise, than he had appointed. And the Gentiles that
worshipped many gods, worshipped one as the head and chief, and the rest as
small companions, and as they termed them, minorum gentium deos, as the
Papists do God as the chief, and the Saints as other petty Gods.

And here all men may see, what a good proctor you be for the Papists, both
in lessening their faults, and abating their punishments, and yet will not I
say, that you are conspired with them, or have received your fee of them. But
if you can show where, or in what one point, those that you charge with
confederacy, have laid so soft pillowes under their heads as these are: they
refuse not to be called confederate, and conspired with the Papists.

Io. Whitgifte.
The distinction betwixt the worshipping of the false gods wholly, and the
worshipping of the true God falsely and superstitiously, is not yet by you
proved to have any absurdity in it. But it is great boldness for you to
affirm, that the Gentiles and the most gross Idolaters never took those
which they did worship for Gods, but that in them, and by them they thought
they worshipped the God that made heaven and earth. For what profane
Philosopher, what drunken Poet, what boy in the Grammar schole knows The
gentiles took the Images to ^e gods. Psalm. 115. Esaias. 44. Ierem. 10. Baru^. 6.
Hist. Bell and Dracon. Judge. 2. 1. Reg. 18.
not the contrary? Was Jupiter, Apollo, Uenus, Diana. etc. Gods or Goddesses
that created heaven and earth? or thought to have made heaven and earth? and
yet these and such like they were, whom the Gentiles did worship even in
their Images. Nay they took the very Images themselves sometimes to be their
Gods. Does not the 115. Psalm. Esaias. 44. Iere. 10. Baruch. 6. the story of
Bell and the Dragon, and the Scripture in sundry places else, manyfestly
declare it? And did not the Jews oftentimes sin in this point as grossly as
the Gentiles did? Look Judge. 2. verse. 10. 11. 12. etc. 1. Reg. 18. wherein it
is plain, that the Jews were as gross in taking those things to be Gods in
deed, as were the Gentiles. And surely I think the places in the Scripture
before alleged, so manifest for the proof hereof, that no man reading the
same, can any thing doubt of this matter.

The words of the text do expressly signify unto us, that the Israelites
took the golden Calfe to be God: but be it that they may be taken there
metonimically (which is but a conjecture) that can not excuse their
grossness at other times, when they were conversant among the Gentiles, and
allured so worship their The example of T. C. against him self.
Gods. But this example serves very well for my purpose, for Aaron did not
only make this Calfe, but also sacrificed unto it, and caused the people to
worship it: and yet notwithstanding he was not deposed from his priesthood,
although his case was all one with theirs, against whom you now speak.

You say the people said that they would keep holyday to the Lord Jehovah,
and therefore did not take the Calfe to be God: wherein you say not truly,
for those were the words, not of the people, but of Aaron: the people said,
These be thy Exo. 32. ver. 4.
Gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, so that, that
reason may show what Aaron thought of it: and this, what was the opinion of
the people. I would have you to deal sincerely in alleging of the scriptures.

You put me over to the treatises of godly new writers, which do refuse this
distinction. etc. But you neither name those writers unto me, nor let me
understand where to find those treatises, which makes me suspecte that you
neither know whose, nor where they be: but the matter is not great. I do as
much mislike that distinction of the Papists, and the intent of it, as any
man does, neither do I go about to excuse them from wicked, and (without
repentance and Gods singular mercy) damnable Idolatry: But yet do I say the
Idolatry both of the Jews, and of the Gentiles (for the causes by me
alleged) to be much greater. For there Three kinds of Idolatry. Martyr in
Iud. 2. Musculus in Lo. com. in expla. 1. praecept.
are three kinds of Idolatry. One is, when the true God is worshipped by
other means and ways, than he has prescribed, or would be worshipped. The
other is, when the true God is worshipped, together with false Gods. 2. Regum.
17. The third is, when we worship false Gods either in heart and mind, or in
external creatures living, or dead, and altogether forget the worship of the
true God. All these three kinds are detestable, but the first is the least,
and the last is the worste: in the which kind the Israelites sundry times
offended, as is manifest in the places before mentioned.

The Papists worship God otherwise than his will is, and otherwise than he
has prescribed, almost in all points of their worship: they also give to
the creature that which is due to the Creator, and sin against the first
table: yet are they not for ought that I can see, or learn, in the third
kind of Idolatry: and therefore if they repent unfeignedly, they are not to be
cast either out of the Church, or out of the ministry.

The Papists have little cause to thank me, or to fee me, for any thing that
I have spoken in their behalf as yet: you see that I place them among wicked
and damnable Idolaters. My defense is of those that have bin Papists, and be
not, and for no other: for them I speak my conscience according to my poor
knowledge, take it as you please.

Of Ministers learning of Catechismes.
Chap. 3.
Admonition.
The third. Then 1. Tim. 4. II

like young children they Ministers of London (...) joined to learn M. Novvels
C^ techisme.
must learn Catechismes.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 40. Sect. 3. 4. 5. and. Page* 41* Sect. 1. 2.
God be thanked, there is a great number of Ministers that can teach others,
and may be your scholemasters in all kind of learning, except you have more
than you utter in these treatises.

If they that find some want of learning in themselves, or that be crepte into
the ministry unlearned, either of their own accord, or by commandment of
their Ordinary, read and learn godly and learned Catechismes, they are to be
commended, and so is he that provoke them thereunto.

That Catechism which you in derision quote in the margent, is a book fit
for you to learn also: and I know no man so well learned, but it may become
him to read and learn that learned and necessary book. But some arrogant
spirits there be, that think them selves of all men best learned, and
disdain to learn of any.

That place of the fourth chapter of the first to Timothy, does not forbid a
man to learn.

He that is a good and modest preacher, will not disdain as well to be taught,
as to teach.

T. C. Page 28. Sect. 2. 3.
What should become of the people in the mean season, whilst they learn
their Catechism, and when they have learned it, they are no more fit to be
Ministers, and to teach other, than he that has learned his Accidence, is
meet to set up a schole. And it can not be defended, but it was a gross
ouersighte, to enjoin ministers to learn a Catechism. It were much to
compel them to read it. And if a man would have dec^amed against the
ignorance of the most part of the ministers, three whole days together, he
could not have said more against them, than that Canon which sends them to
their A. B. C. and principles of their religion. How know you that they quote
the Catechism in the margent in derision? is there any syllable or letter that
sounds that ways? if you conjecture it because they have set it in the
margent, you may as well say, that they likewise quote the scriptures in
derision, being also placed there.

It follows even as the rest of your argu ments do, for it is your own, and
no man's else.
But how follows this? It is meet that ministers should learn every day,
therefore it is meet they be enjoined to learn Catechismes? it is meet they
should read Catechismes, therefore meet to learn them, and be enjoined to
learn them? Is there nothing worthier the learning and profession of the
Minister, than to learn Catechismes? or does a man learn those things
always, which he reads? does he not read things sometime to record the
things that he has learned? For because they say it is not meet that
ministers should be enjoined to learn a Catechism, you conclude of their
words, that they would not have a minister to learn, or to read any thing,
which is as far from their meaning or words either, as you are from the
reasonable and upright expounding of them.

Io. Whitgifte.
God be thanked, the people need not pyne away for lack of food, they have
the Scriptures read unto them, they have also profitable and fruitef^ll
Homilies, they have the Sacraments rightly ministered, and publyke prayers in a
known tongue: and sometime God sends unto them some well disposed preacher
further to instruct them, and the Curate is not so slothefull and careless,
but that he will also communicate with them that which he himself has by
diligent reading learned.

Catechismes (and that especially) do conteyne the grounds of religion, and
the principal points of faith, and good life, and therefore not unfit, or
unprofitable for any man to read. I know not what weightier matters they can
learn, than those that be contained in that book: except you think nothing
weighty, but such matters as you now contend for: and for the which you so
much disturb the peace of the Church. It is well done to enjoin them to
learn it, and it shall be no disgracing, no not to your self to read it.

We do not deny but that there be unlearned Ministers in England, and we
think it no discredit at all, to enjoin them to learn such things as are
most profitable both for them to know, and to teach unto other. To read
and to learn such an A. B. C. is not unprofitable for any: but you will still
show that good opinion that you have of your self, and how greatly you
disdain all other men's labors.

Whether I have truly said that note to be placed in the Margent in derision,
or no, let the Reader judge, to whom also I do refer the consideration of
your modesty, touching that matter. He that indifferently considers their
quotations of Scriptures, will think that the most of them, were not placed
there in good earnest.

The argument which it has pleased you to frame of my words (I grant)
follows not: but this follows right well, it is fit that ignorante
Ministers should be enjoined to learn such things, as be meet and
profitable for them, Ergo, they may be enjoined to learn Catechismes. And in
like manner, it is meet they should read such Books as may instruct
them: Ergo, they may read Catechismes. I think a man by reading, learneth:
and I suppose that to read those things again, which a man has forgotten,
is to learn them again, if to learn be to understand, and to remember.

But all this your dallying about this matter, is to bring discredit unto this
state of the Church, because there be many ignorante Ministers. Wherefore I
will answer you with the very words in the confession of the Churches in
Heluetia. We condemn all unmeet Ministers, not endued with gifts necessary
for a shepherd Confess. eccles. Helueti^.
that should feed his flock. Howebeit we acknowledge that the harmless
simplicity of some shepheardes in the old Church, did sometimes more profit
the Church, than the great, exquisite, and fine or delicate, but a little too
proud learning of some others: wherefore we reject not now a days, the good
simplicity of certain, so that they be not altogether unskillful of God and
his word.

obteineth the next aduouson, by money or by favor, and so thinks himself
sufficiently chosen.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 42. Sect. 4. 5. 6.
To prove that the election was then made by the common consent Matthias
elected extraordinarily.
of the whole Church, you quote the first of the Acts. I told you before
master Caluines judgment of that place: there is no mention of electing by any
common consent. And in the place by you quoted, which is the. 26. verse, it is
declared how they gave forth their lottes, and that the lot fell on Matthias,
and that he was by a common consent counted with the eleven Apostles: here is
no mention of any election. But when he was extraordinarily through Gods
providence by lot appointed, then they al counted him, and esteemed him as one
of the Apostles, where as before, some of them would have had Barsabas.

I think your meaning is not to have always two at once to be presented to
the ministry, and then one of them to be chosen by lotte: I know none of
that opinion. Wherefore this example is singular and extraordinary, and
therefore no general rule to be followed.

If any man seeks a benefice extraordinarily, ^r* unlawfully. If any man
desire honorem, the honor, not onus, the burden: opes, the riches, not opus,
the work: he has to answer for it: but I trust you will not accuse all,
though perhaps you know some, I mean of your selves, and peradventure your
own self.

Admonition.
The fifthe. Then the congregation Act. 6. 2. 3.
had authority to call ministers: in stead thereof now they run, they ride,
and by unlawful suit and buying, preuente other suitors also.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 42. Sect. 2. 3.
To prove that the congregation had then authority to call ministers: you
allege the sixte of the Acts, which place of the Acts I touched before: It
speaks not of Ministers of the word, but of Deacons, which were appointed
to make provision for the poor only (as you say) neither did the multitude of
the Disciples (for so they be called) elect them before they were willed so to
do by the twelve Apostles.

It may be that some use to run and ride, and by unlawful suit A good rule
may be broken by some, and yet good still.
and buying preuente others, and it may be that you have experience hereof:
but all do not so, this is the fault of the man, not of the calling: you may
not ascribe men's infirmities to a lawful order. The rule may be good,
though it be by some broken.

T. C. Page 28. Sect. 4.
It has bin likewise showed, what was in that election extraordinary, and
what perteyneth to the ordinary callings. And in the sixte of the Acts it was
showed, if the Deacons should not be thrust upon the congregation against the
will of it, much less ought the minister. And if that congregation had by the
commandment of the Apostles, an interest in the choice of their governors, I
see not why the same commandment remains not to be followed of other
Churches. Your reasons wherewith you would make difference, shall be after
considered,

Io. Whitgifte.
And I have likewise answered to whatsoever you have said there, but you tell
us neither there nor here, how aptely this part of the text, scilicet,
verse. 26. is in this place quoted. To your reason also gathered out of the
sixte of the Acts in the electing of Deacons I have there answered: only I
thought good in this place to set down the judgment of Chrysostom Hom. 14.
in Act. Ideo boc non permiserunt Chryso. Hom. 14. in Act.
sorti, ueque cum possent ipsi spiritu moti, eligere, hoc faciunt: sed magis
statuunt quod multorum testimonijs approbatur. Nam definire numerum, and
ordinare, and in talem vsum, hoc sibi vendicant: Eligere autem viros illis
permittunt, vt ne videantur ipsi in gratiam quorundam agere. The Apostles did
not commit the election of Deacons to lotte, neither they being moved with
the spirit, did choose them, though they might have so done: for to appoint
the number, to ordain them, and to such an use, they challenged as due unto
them selves. And yet do they permit the election of them to the people,
least they should be thought to be partial, or to do any thing for
favor. Your reasons to prove that to be a perpetual rule, shall not (God
willing) be passed over in their place.

Chap. 4. the. 2. Division.

The sirthe. Then no Act. 14. 13. 2. Cor. 8. 19
minister placed in any congregation, but by the consent of the people.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 42. Sect. vlt.
Coproue that no Minister was placed in any congregation, but by the consent of
the people, you allege the. 14. of the Acts, and of the. 2. to the
Corinthians, the eight chapter. In the. 14. of the Acts, verse. 23. (for the
which you have quoted the. 13.) it is thus written. When they (that is Paul
and Barnabas) had ordained them elders by election (for so is some translation)
in every Church, and prayed and fasted. etc. The text is plain that Paul and
Barnabas did ordeyne them Elders.

T. C. Page 29. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
Unto these places of the first and sixte of the Acts is added, first the
place of the fourtenth of the Acts, where the authors of the Admonition do
prove, that the election ought not to be in one man his hand, but ought to be
made by the Church, against which master Doctor takes three exceptions. The
first is, for that it is said that Paul and Barnabas ordained Elders, whereby
he would conclude, that the congregations had nothing to do. But how slender
a reason that is, it may be considered of infinite places in the Scripture,
whereof I will recite two or three.

In the fifthe Chapter of Joshua it is said, that Joshua made him sharp knyues
for the circumcising of the children of Israel, and a little afterward, that
Joshua circumcised them. Shall we now upon these words conclude, yt Joshua did
make the knives himself, or was a Cutler, or being made to his hand, did
whette them, and sharpen them, or shall we say that he did circumcise the
children of Israel in his own person, and himself alone, when as that was
done by many, and by the Levites, to whom that office apperteyned? No, but the
Scripture declares, that Joshua procured sharp knyues to be made, and exhorted
and commanded the people to be circumcised.

In the eyghtenth of Exodus, it is said that Moses did appoint unto the
people, Princes, Captains over thousands and hundrethes. etc. And if any
conciude thereupon that he did it 1. Chap. verse. 15.
himself alone, he is by and by confuted by that which is written in
Deuteronomie, where it appears that the people did choose them, and presented
them to Moses. What is it then that is said in Erodus, that Moses appointed
them, but that Moses assembled the people, and exhorted them to appoint rulers,
and told them what manner of men they should be, and in a word, sat as it
were, moderatour in that election.

To come to the new Testament. In the Acts it is said, that Paul and
Timothy delivered Act. 16.
unto the Churches, the orders and decrees of the Apostles and Elders, and yet
it appears in another place, that the Church had also to do, and gave their
consent unto the making Act. 15. verse. 23.
of those decrees, so that the former place means, that the Apostles and
Elders did go before, and were the chief, and directors of that action.

The same manner of speech is used of the You say so, but you show not one.
Roman stories, wherein it is said, that the Counsel did make Magistrates,
for because that he gathered the assembly and voices, whereby they were made:
and so S. Luke says here, that Paul and Barnabas ordained, because they
being the moderators of the election, caused it to be made, assembled the
Churches, told them of the necessity of having good pastors and gouernoures,
gathered the voices, took heed that nothing should be done lightly, nothing
tumultuously or out of order. And so to conclude, it is an evil reason to say
as M. Doctor does, that because S. Luke has, that Paul and Barnabas
ordained, therefore the people were excluded.

Io. Whitgifte.
If the reason grounded upon the plain words of the scripture, be but a
slender reason, then do I confess that to be so likewise. Howbeit, very godly
and learned men think it a reason sufficient. Zuinglius in his Eccless. says,
that some were called and elected Zuinglius. Bullinger.
to the ministry of the word, by the Apostles only. Bullinger in his third
book aduersus Anabap. Cap. 4. says thus: Paulus and Barnabas presbyteros seu
ministros elege^unt in ecclesijs Asiae. Paul and Barnabas did choose Elders or
Ministers in the Churches of Asia.

Those places of Scripture that you recite, may prove that there are such
manner of speeches in the scripture, but they prove not that this is such, and
therefore you have in vain rehearsed them.

The example of Joshua is far from prouyng this phrase, to be such, sor you
affirm, that Joshua is said to make sharp knyues, and to Circumcic^, only
because hcc procured sharp knyues to be made, and commanded the people to
be circumcided, and not because he him self bydde sharpen the knyues, or
circumcyde in his own person: But it is certain that Paul and Barnabas had
to do in this action, and did themselves in their own persons, ordeyne
ministers, and not command others to ordeyne them. Wherefore the manner of
speech can not be like, except you will expound this place thus: Paul and
Barnabas ordained them Elders, that is, commanded the people to choose them
Elders, which interpretation were strange for this place, and unheard of
before.

That in the syrste of Deuteronomie does not directely prove, that Moses
alone did not appoynte those Magistrates, for although he wylled the people
to bring unto him men of wisdom, and of understanding. etc. yet it
follows not that they did so, but it rather appears, that they committed
the choice of them wholly to him, for after in the fyfteenth verse of the same
Chapter he says, So I took the chief of your tribes, wise and known men,
and made Deu. 1. Ver. 15.
them rulers. etc. Manifest it is (that whether the people named any unto him
or no) he appointed them, and gave them their authority, so that the manner of
speech is proper, and without any trope or figure.

But do you not still secretly pushe at the authority of the Civil
Magistrate, T. C. under an other pretense pusheth at the civil Magistrate.
under the pretense of speaking against the state Ecclesiastical? For
howesoeuer you would seem to bring in the place in the eighteenth of Exodus,
to prove the phrase and manner of speaking, yet may you be thought secretly
to insinuate that Princes may not appoynte under-officers, without the
Election of the people. And surely if your dealing in this place be well
marked, it may easily be seen, that in reasonyng against the gouernemente of
the Church, you lay the grounds of confoundyng, or at the least, of
chaungyng the state of the Common wealth.

In the fifteenth of the Acts ver. 22. and. 23. there appears, that the
whole Church together with the Apostles and Elders, did send certain
chosen men of their own company to Antiochia, with Paul and Barnabas. etc.
and wrote Letters by them conteynyng these Decrees: whereunto though the people
subscribed, and gave their consent, yet it follows not, but that the
Apostles and Elders made them: As it also appears verse. 2. and. 6. of the
same chapter. Every one that consents to Orders, and subscribeth unto them,
does not therefore make them: Wherefore they may properly be said to be made
by the Apostles and Elders only, though the people allowed well of them, and
consented to them. And therefore says M. Calvin: the modesty of the people
Call. in. 15. Act.
herein does appear, that after they had committed the decidyng of the
controversies to the Apostles, and other Doctors, they were also content to
subscribe to their decree. Whether there be any such manner of speech or no
in the Romayne stories, it is not material: neither is there any thing here
spoken, which proves that this is such a manner of speech: wherefore it
must remain as proper and literally true, until there be stronger reasons
brought to prove as plainly, that the people ordained ministers, as it is here
written, that Paul and Barnabas did.

Chap. 4. the third Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 43. Lin. 8.
And the Greek word (...) although it signify to elect, by putting up of
hands, yet it is the common opinion almost of all Ecclesiastical writers,
that this word in Scripture is used for the solemn manner of ordering
ministers by the imposition of hands.

T. C. Page 29. Sect. 6. and Page 30. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4.
And I maruayle with what conscience he could answer so in this place,
especially where it is forthwith added, that they ordained them by the
suffrages, and voices of the Church. But you say that the Greek word (...) is
by the common opinion of almost all ecclesiastical writers, used in the
scripture for the solemn manner of ordeyning of ministers, by the imposition of
hands: which is the second exception you take to this reason. Wherein, but
that I have promised to hold my self to the matter, and that these bold
asseuerances in matters most untrue, are so common, that if I should every
foot pursue them, I should weary my self and all others, I could not keep
my self from running out to marvel at such high speeches void of truth.
First, where you say that some translation has, that they ordained ministers
without making mention of Election, what have you gained thereby, when I can
show more that translate it otherwise, and say it is, that they ordained by
election, or voices, or suffrages? I had not the commodity of Books, whereby I
could see the judgment of all Ecclesiastical writers. But of those which I

consentin the Election, neither M. Calvin, M. Beza, M. Bullinger, M. Musculus,
M. Brentius, he that translated Chrysostom upon that place, Erasmus in his
Paraphrases upon that place are of the contrary judgment, of whose judgment
I would not have spoken, if you would not have gone about, thus to abuse your
reader, with such manifest untruths, to overthrow the order which God has
established.

But let all authorities of men go, and let us examine the thing in it self.
If so be that the holy Ghost had meant the solemn putting on of the hands
upon the head of him that was created Elder and Minister, had he not words inow
to utter this his meaning? would he have for laying on of hands used a word
that signifies lifting up of hands: would he have used a word signifying
holding up for laying down? for when the hands are laid of the head of an
other, they are laid down, and not holden up. There are words in the old
Testamente, and in the new before Luke wrote, and after he wrote, to express
this Ceremony of laying on of hands, and yet none have ever expressed this.

Saint Paul speaks thrice of it in his Epistles to Timothy, and always
he uses 1. Tim. 4. 1. Tim. 5. 2. Tim. 1.
(...). In the old Testamente where this ceremony is used and spoken of, the
Septuaginta did never traslate (...), But as the writers of the new Testament,
(...). And what should I stand in this, when as Saint Luke himself, both
before and after, speaking of that Ceremony of laying on of hands, does
never use this word 8. Acts. 9. Acts. 19. Acts.
(...) but the same word which Saint Paul uses, and the Septuaginta? And
although the Holy Ghost speak proprely, and well by whom soever he
speaks, yet it could have been worste of all said by Saint Luke, of all
the Canonical writers, that he should speak thus vnproprely, who of them
all writes most purely and elegantely, according to the phrase of the most
eloquent Grecians, and therefore he borrowed this speech of the ancient
Greek writers, which did use to express their Elections by this word,
because they were made, and voices given by this Ceremony of lyftyng up of
hands.

But what if Saint Luke have used this word before, and in this book, in
the signification of choosyng by voice, dare you then say, that he uses it
here for putting on of hands?

In the. 10. of the Acts Saint Peter says, that Christ after his
resurrection, appeared not unto the whole people, but unto those whom he had
before chosen by his If you will grant that this word is taken for electing
by one voice, we shall soon agree.
voice, to be his witnesses, he uses this (...). Now if you will say here,
that it is to be turned, those of whom he laid his hands: I will ask you
where you read, that ever he laid his hands of their heads. I will show
you where he did by his heavenly voice appoint them. And I think you are not
able to show in any Greek author ancient, and which men do take to be
autenticall to teach the property or eloquence of the greek tongue I mean
which were before Saint Luke his time, where the word (...) is taken for
the laying on of hands of the head of any.

This I confess that the Greek Ecclesiastical writers have sometimes used it
so, but you must remember that Saint Luke could not learn to speak of them
that came two or three hundred years after him? but he borrowed this phrase of
speech of those that were before him, and therefore speaks of elections as
they did. So that you see this shift will not serve.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is nothing to prove that they ordained them by the suffrages of the
Church, but this word (...), the acceptance whereof in this place is now in
question: I say still, that although it proprely signify to elect by putting
up of hands, yet is it the common opinion almost of all ecclesiastical The
signification of the word (...)
writers, that it is used in Scripture for the solemn manner of ordering
ministers by the imposition of hands. And that this is neither so strange nor
so untrue, as you would seem to make the reader believe, I have set down
those authors which have taught me so to say.

Bullinger upon the same place says thus: Caeterum dictio (...), ita
ponitur, vt velsuffragijs populi delectos esse, vel manuum impositione
inauguratos intelligere possimus. But the word (...) is so placed that we
may understand either that they were chosen by the voices of the people, or
ordained by the laying on of hands.

M. Calvin upon the same place has these words, Verbum Graecum (...)
significat Caluin^.
aliquid manibus sublatis discernere, qualiter in commitijs populi fieri solet.
Scriptores tamen ecclesiastici nomen (...) alio sensu vsurpant: nempe pro
solenni ordinationis ritu, qui in Scripturis vocatur, manuum impositio. The
greek word (...) signifies to determine some thing by holding up of hands,
according as it was usual in the assemblies and elections of the people:
notwithstanding the Ecclesiastical writers use this word (...) in an other
sense. For the solemn manner of ordering, which in the scriptures is called
the laying on of hands. And this saying of M. Calvin has Marlorat also
written in his collections, as allowyng the same. The same M. Calvin Instit:
cap. 8. Sect. 65. Sequitur iam vt tractemus. etc. It follows now that we
should entreat of the manner whereby the ministers of the primitive Church
were placed in their office. This the Latinistes call ordering or consecration,
the Grecians (...), and sometimes also (...): although (...) is properly called
that kind of election, wherein the voices are signified by lifting up of
hands. Gualter.


Likewise Gualter upon the fourteenth of the Acts. Deinde (...) mentionem
facit Lucas. etc. Furthermore Luke makes mention of (...), by the which not
only the gathering of voices, but also the laying on of hands, which was a
sign of consecration, may be signified: And surely the latter seems most
conueniente. For it is not lykely that the Apostles would depart from that
order, which we see to have been observed in the election of Matthias, and
permit any thing to the judgment of man (which in voices oftentimes
comes to pass) seeing that they stirred up the whole Church to prayer and
fasting.

Thus then you see that the matter is nothing so strange as you make it: for
all these learned writers affirm as much touching the acceptance of this
word, as I have done: and if you will give me leave to allege the Canons
attributed to the Apostles, as you do, I will find it there taken in the same
signification also: for in Can. Apost. 1. and. 2.
the first Cano^ it is thus written, (...). Let a bishop be ordained of two or
three Bishops. And in the second Can. (...). Let a minister be ordained of
one Bishop. You can not deny, but that the old translations and commentaries
also make only mention of electing and ordeyning, and not of electing or
ordeyning by voices.

Oecumenius in his commentaries upon this place does affirm, that Paul and
Barnabas did create and ordeyne them: so do other likewise: and howesoeuer the
word in Chrysostom is translated, yet Chrysostom gives no signification in
his Chaysost. in 14. in Act.
commentaries that his meaning was so. But Hom. 14 in Act. he writes thus,
Vide quomodo scriptor. etc. Mark how the writer is not superfluous, for he
does not declare how, but he simply declares, that they were ordained by
prayers: for this in (...). ordinatio, that is to say, ordeyning, the hands
are laid upon the man, but God works the whole, and it is his hand that
touches the head of him that is ordained, if he be ordeynedas Hierome.
as he ought to be. Hierome also writing upon the. 58. of Esaie says, that
(...) is vsuallye taken for the ordeining of Clerks, by Prayer and laying on
of hands.

I deny not but that many do translate it, as you say, yet is it doubtefull
in (...).
diverse of them whether they meant the voices of the whole Church, or of the
ministers, or of Paul and Barnabas only. M. Bullinger says that he is
elected by the common suffrages of the people, qui optimorum testimonio
probatus est: which is approved by the testimony of the best. And the law
says, in publico negotio qui se non apponit cum possit, consentire
intelligitur, he is thought to consent in a public business, which does not
withstand when he may.

I think your complaint for lack of books is without cause, and very
unlikely it is to be true, all things considered. How so ever M. Calvin, or
M. Bullinger do take that word themselves, yet have they affirmed as much of
the other signification, as I have done, and therefore the more like to be
true. Neither have you as yet alleged any thing that can prove the contrary.

You may not teach the Holy Ghost how to speak, neither must you in
such matters use so light and vain reasons. Neither M. Bullinger nor M.
Calvin disalloweth that signification, or goes about to confute it, and you
your self confess, that the Greek Ecclesiastical writers have semetyme
used it so, as in deed they commonly do, which may easily be understood,
by that that I have hitherto spoken.

He that lays his hands upon a man's head, does lift them up be fore he
can lay them on, and therefore you do but trifle in making so much a do
about holdyng up, and laying down. There be other weordes, (I grant) to
express this Ceremony of laying on of hands, and I know that Luke and Paul
do use an other word for the same, and the Septuagint. in like manner, but
what is all this to the purpose? What can you conclude hereof? Is this
sufficient to prove, that this word therefore in this place may not signify
the same? are these bare conjectures sufficient, to improve so many learned
men's judgments.

I do not say that (...) does signifye only the bare Ceremony of laying on
of hands, but the whole solemnity of creatyng Ministers, which is also
sometimes signified by (...), as namely, 1. Ti. 9. But Saint Luke, when he
uses in other places (...), he does use it in the bare signification of
laying on of hands, and not for any other ryte or solemnity, as he does this
word (...) in this place: and therefore you do petere principium, when you
frame your proofs, as though it were affirmed or granted, that Saint Luke
by this word should mean only the bare ceremony of imposition of hands.
T. C. brings a place against himself.


The place that you allege out of the tenthe of the Acts makes most
against your self, and overthrows your whole buyldyng. First, because
(...) is not there taken for liftyng up of hands, but for appoyntyng or
ordeinyng only: for Christ did not appoynte his Disciples by lifting up of
hands: Secondly, it signifies not to appoint or to ordeyne by the suffrages
and consent of other: for Christ required no man's consent in the choice of
his Apostles: so that you have lost and not gained by alleging of that
place: for as this word (...) in the tenthe of the Acts does not signifye,
that the Apostles were chosen by the consent or voice of any other, than of
Christ only: so does (...) also in this fourteenth of the Acts signify,
that Paul and Barnabas did appoynte and ordeyne them ministers by their own
voices only, and not by the suffrages of the people. Certainly that place of
the tenth of the Acts manifestly declares, that this word in Scripture does
not signify any common Election by the voices of the people, as you would
have it to do. Wherefore I think that their judgment can not justly be
mislyked, which say this word in this foureteenth of the Acts, to signify
the solemn manner of ordeining Ministers by the imposition of hands: not
meaning thereby the bare Ceremony, but the whole action of ordeyning. To
conclude, I will desire no other interpretation of this word in the. 14. of
the Acts, than that same place which you have alleged Acts. 10. which also
answers, what so ever you have here spoken of Saint Lukes skyll in the
Greek tongue: or of the use of this word in the Scriptures: so that I shall
not need any other Author before Saint Lukes time, to prove the same.

Chap. 4. the fourth Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 43. Lin. 12.
Surely howesoeuer the word is taken, yet here is no general rule prescribed
of electing ministers. You may as well conclude, that all things ought to be
common among Christians, because we read Act. 2. that all those which
believed, had all things common among them: and that those which be converted
to the Gospel, ought to sell their goods and lands, to be distributed at the
discretion of the ministers, because they did so. Act. 2. and. 3.

T. C. Page 30. Sect. 5. 6. and Page 31. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4.
Let us therefore see your third: which is, that although the Churches
consent was then required, yet it is not now, and that it is no general
rule, no more than (say you) that all things should be therefore common now,
because they were in the Apostles time.

The authors of the Admenition, with their favorers, must be counted
Anabaptists, no one word being showed which tends thereunto, you must
accuse them, which confirm that foundation whereof they build their
community of all things, which is one of their chief heresies. If I should
say now that you are like to those that row in a boat, which although they
look backewardes, yet they thruste an other way, I should speak with more
lykelyhode than you have done. For although you make a countenance, and
speak hotly against Anabaptists, yet in deed you strengthen their hands
with reasons. But I will not say so, neither do I think that you favor that
sect, but only the whirlewinde and tempest of your affection bente to
maintain this estate, whereby you have so great honor and wealth, drives
you upon these rocks, to wrack your self on, and others.

For I pray you what community is spoken of either in the two, or three, or
fourth of the Acts, which ought not to be in the Church: as long as the
world stands? was there any community but as touching the use, and so far
forth as the poor brethren had need of, and Act. 1. Act. 5.
not to take every man alyke? was it not in any man his power to sell his
houses, or lands, or not to sell them? When he had sold them, were they not
in every man his liberty to keep the money to himself at his pleasure? and
The text says plainly, that as many as were possessoures of lands. etc. soul^
them.
all they that were of the Church did not sell their possessions, but those
whose hearts the Lord touched singularly with the compassion of the need of
others, and whom God had blessed with abundance, that they had to serve
themselves, and help others, and therefore it is reckened as a rare example,
that Barnabas the Cyprian and Leuite did sell his possession, and brought
the price to the feet of the Apostles.

And as for Ananias and Saphira, they were not punished for because they
brought not the price of their possessions to the Apostles, but because they
lied, saying that they had brought the whole when they had brought but part.
And to be short, is there any more done there, than Saint Paul prescribes
to the Corinthians, and in them to all Churches to the worlds end? After he
had exhorted to liberality toward the poor Church in Jerusalem, not
(says 2. Cor. 8.
he) that other should be relieved, and you oppressed, but upon like
condition at this time your abundance supplyeth their lack, that also their
abundance may be for your lack, that there might be equality, as it is
written, he that gathered much, had nothing over, and he that gathered little,
had not the less.

Surely it were better you were no Doctor in the Church, than that the
Anabaptists should have such hold to bring in their community as you give
them.

In sum the Apostolic community, or the Churches in their time, was not
Anabapti^ticall.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have showed before in the beginning of my Answer to the Admonition, No good
argument, a f^* cto ad iu^.
not only how weak, but also how dangerous a kind of reasonyng it is, to
say, that the Apostles did it, Ergo, we must do it, or the Apostles did
it not, Ergo we must not do it. Zuinglius a notable learned man, does
especially reprove the Anabaptists for this kind of reason, and says that
an argument, a facto ad ius, or a non facto ad non ius, is never good, except
those examples be grounded upon some law or rule. Wherefore, when I thus
labor to overthrow the vicious manner and kind of the Anabaptisticall
argument, I trust no indifferent man will suspect me of their errors? when I
say, that this is no good argument: In the Apostles time those that believed
had all things common among them, therefore Christians must have all things
common: do I confirm their heresy of having all things common? I know not
why you should so charge me with the whirlewynde and tempest of my affection
bente to mayntaine this estate. etc. except you be offended because I show the
weakness of the Anabaptists reasons for their community.

My honor and wealth is not so much, but yet I would be loath to have it
common, and you may not blame me though I maynteyne that state, where all men
may quietly enjoy their own, without confusion.

I know the Anabaptists do not only err in their kind of reasoning, but in
the right understanding of the Scriptures also, even of those places whereupon
they frame their argument. But the text says plainly, Omnes qui credebant.
etc. All which believed, were in one place, and had all things common. Acto.
2. and. 4. Quotquot Act. 2. Act. 4.
enim possessores praediorum aut domorum erant. etc. For as many as were
possessours of lands or houses sold them. etc. And though they were greatly
to be commended in sellyng their lands and possessions, and in so lightly
esteeming the riches of this world, yet it follows not, that no man can be
a good Christian, unless he follow that example. There are sundry places of
the Scripture that overthrow the Anabaptisticall community: and therefore
howesoeuer they understand these examples, yet can they not prove their
error, for it is true that Zuinglius says, Nullius facta iuri praeiudicant,
examples must give place when they be against a general law, commandment
or right.

I have not spoken one word of Ananias and Saphira, and therefore I muse to
what purpose you bring them in: neither am I against the interpretation of
those places of the Acts, yet do I say, that no man is bound of necessity
to follow those examples, except it were in the like time, and state. So that
if the Anabaptists both err in the understanding of those places, and in
their kind of reasoning also as they do in both. M. Doctor may keep his
Doctorship still, and they be far enough from their community. The
community that was in the Apostles time was Christian, and most fit for
that time, but the same may not now be urged in the self same manner, and
form, without suspicion of Anabaptisms. And it is a very good argument
against you: for as the community used amongste the Christians Act. 2. and.
4. was godly, and yet not necessary nor meet for all states of the Church,
even so the election then used was also godly, and yet not at all times to be
practiced, but only in the like state of time.

Chap. 4. the fyft Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 43. Lin. 20. and Sect. 1.
In the second to the Corinthians. 8. the Apostle declares how the Churches
had chosen Luke (or as some think Barnabas) to be his companion in his
journey: But what makes this for electing of ministers? how follows this
argument? The Churches had chosen Luke or Barnabas, to be Paul's companion in
his journey: therefore ministers of the word must be elected by the people?

These three last reasons are all one, and the places of Scripture which I
have set down, and answered, be alleged of you to prove, that the election
of ministers, was then made by the common consent of the people, and that every
congregation had authority to call their ministers.

T. C. Page. 31. Sect 4.
Unto the place of the. 2. epistle to the Corinthians, and. 8. chapter, you
ask what makes that to the election of the ministers? But why do not you say
here as you did in the other place, that the Apostle means nothing else but
the putting on of the hands of them which ordained? For the same word (...) is
here used, that was there, and this place does manifestly and without all
contradiction convince your vain signifycation that you make of it in the
other place, and the untruth wherein you say that the scripture uses this word
for a solemn manner of ordering ministers, by putting on of hands. For here
it is said, that he that was joined with Paul, was (...) by the Church, and
it is manifest that the impositio^ of hands, was not by the Church and people,
but by the elders and ministers, as it appears in S. Paul to Timothy. 1.
Tim. 4. 2. Tim. 1.


Now to come to that which you make so light of: for say you, how follows
this: The Church chose Luke or Barnabas to be companion of Paul's journey: Ergo
the Churches must choose their ministers? It follows very well, for if it
were thought meet that S. Paul should not choose himself of his own
authority, a companion to help him, being an Apostle, is there any Archbishop
that shall dare take upon him to make a minister of the Gospel, being so many
degrees (both in authority and in all gifts needful to discern, and
trieout, or take knowledge of a sufficient minister of the Gospel) inferioure
to S. Paul.

And if S. Paul would have the authority of the Church to ordain the
Minister, that should aid him in other places, to the building and gathering
of other Churches, how much more did he think it meet, that the Churches
should choose their own Minister, which should govern them: and which things
may be also said of the election in the first of the Acts. For there the Vntr^.
Church first chose two, whereof one should be an Apostle, which should not be
minister of that Church but should be sent into all the world, so that always
the Apostles have shunned to do any thing of their own wills, without the
knowledge either of those Churches, where they instituted any governors, or if
it were for the behoof of those places where there were no Churches gathered,
yet would they ordain none, but by the consent of some other Church, which
was already established.

Io. Whitgifte.
Of the acceptance of this word in the. 14. of the Acts, I have spoken
sufficiently This place is not one whit contrary to any thing that is said in
that matter: for in the 14. of the Acts it is referred to the appointing of
ministers of the word, and in this place of the second. Cor. 8. it is applied
to the sending of some with Paul to gather the benevolence of the Churches,
and to carry the same to the poor Saints. Now though (...) may signify the
imposition of hands, or the whole action of ordering ministers, when it is
referred to that matter, yet does it not follow, that it should always signify
so, to whatsoever it is applied. But take it as you list, it is as well spoken
of one alone, as of many, as the place Act. 10. manifestly declares: and
therefore does not of necessity signify an election made by the people, except
some other word be joined with it, to express the same, as there is in this.
2. Cor. 8. For thus the Apostle says (...) which addition should not have
needed, if this word 2. Cor. 8.
alone had of necessity signified in the scripture any such election, as you
would have it to do.

In the argument there is no sequel at all, for it was very convenient and
meet, Why the com panions of Paul were chosen by consent.
for the avoiding of suspicion of private gain, or corrupt dealing, that such
as should have to do in gathering and distributing alms, should be chosen by
a common consent: and it is manifest, that it was Paul's own request to have
them in this business, by the consent of the Churches, joined with him, for
the stopping of the mouths of such as would otherwise have bin ready to suspect
Paul's integrity in that money matter: and that this is true, these words
declare, declinantes boc ne quis nos carpat in bat 2. Cor. 8.
exuber antia quae administratur a nobis, procurantes bonesta. etc. Avoiding
this, that no man should blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us,
providing for honest things, not only before the Lord, but also before men: as
though he would say, therefore have I procured that by the consent of the
Churches some might be joined with me in this collection, least any man should
take occasion to suspecte me of corrupt dealing, or to report, that in this
business I robbed the Church to enrich my self.

Now therefore how any thing can be gathered of this place, to prove that
ministers of the word ought to be chosen by a common consent of the people, let
the reader judge. Paul might have chosen the^ himself if he would, but he
desired the Churches to choose them, that his upright dealing in collecting and
distributing of the alms, might not be brought into suspicion, as I have said
before. And therefore an Archbishop may dare take upon him to make a minister
of the Gospel. etc. for any thing that is in this place to the contrary. In
deed if an Archbishop should be appointed to collecte, and to distribute
alms, then were it fit (for his own credit sake, and to avoid the
slanderous speeches of those that be quarrelous) that he should desire some to
be joined with him, by the common consent of those of whom he should collect.
And this is the only thing that may be gathered of this place, touching any
election.

It is untrue, that in the first of the Acts the Church did first choose those
two, that stood in the election for the Apostleship: the Apostles only did
propound them to the church, as M. Beza truly says in these words, apparet cum
eligendus esset qui in Iudae proditoris locum Beza. li. confe. cap. 5.
succederet, fuisse multitudini propositos ab Apostolis eos, quos maxim
idoneos censebant. It appears, when he was to be chosen, which should
succeed in the room of Judas the traytoure, that they were propounded unto
the multitude by the Apostles, whom they thought most meet. Neither were the
Apostles chosen by men, but immediately by God, as al writers confess, which
was the cause why matthias was there chosen by lot, and not by the voices of
men.

Why in the Apostles time it was convenient to require the consent of the
people in some things, and yet not convenient now so to do, is declared
afterward.

time, the peoples consent was in many places required in the appoynting of

T. C. Page. 31. Sect. vlt. and. Page 32. Sect. 1.
You will not deny but that in the Apostles time, and S. Cyprians time in many
places, the consent of the people was required: show any one place where it was
not.

Does not S. Luke say that it was done Church by Church, that is in every
Church? And where you say it endured An untruth, for I say not, but to Cyprias
time.
but to S. Cyprians time, it shall appear to all men that it endured in the
Church a thousand years and more after his time: and it appears in the. 4.
epistle of his first book that he used it not as a thing indifferent, but
necessary, and argues the necessity of it, of the place of the first of the
Acts, which is alleged by the authors of the Admonition. And so they are not
their arguments that you throw up so scornefully, saying, how follows this,
and this, what proves it? but Cyprians, whom by their sides you thrust
through, and so irreverently handle.

Io. Whitgifte.
You bid me show any one place where the consent of the people was not required
in electing of ministers, in the Apostles, or in Cyprians time. I might rather
ask you this question, Election of ministers by the people not general in the
Apostls time.
especially of the Apostles time, and bid you show unto me any one place, that
directly proves the consent of the people to have bin required in the election
of the ministers of the word. In the first of the Acts, the Apostles propounded
two, and the election was not by voice, but by lot. In the. 14. of the Acts it
is plain, that Paul and Barnabas did choose the ministers of the word. S.
Paul says to Timothy. 1. Ti. 5. 1. Tim. 5. Tit. 1. (...)
manus cito ne cui imponas: lay hands on no man suddenly. And to Titus Chap.
1. that for this cause he left him at Creta. etc. That he should ordeyne elders
in every city. To be short, Christ himself alone, without the consent of
any other, appointed his Apostles. Show you me the like evident places for your
purpose if you can.

The 6. of the Acts is but of Deacons: who because they were occupied about
mouey Why Deacons were chosen by com mon consent. Act. 6. 2. Cor. 8.
matters, and collecting and distributing of alms, it was meet that they
should be chosen by a common consent, to avoid the grudging of the people
that gave alms, and the suspicion of others, as the place it self does
manifestly declare. Acts. 6. There arose a murmuring of the Graecians toward
the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministering.
etc. The. 2. Cor. 8. is to the like effect, whereof I have spoken
sufficientely. There only remains too help you, this word (...) which I
have proved not of necessity to signify in the scripture any election by the
people, except there be some other word added unto it, to express the same as
there is. 2. Cor. 8. and therefore my assertion is grounded upon the plain and
evident places of the scriptures, yours upon likelyhoods and conjectures only.
And if it were as lawful for me to allege the Canons attributed to the
Apostles, as it is for you (who have alleged them in sundry places) then could
I tell you out of them also, that the electing of ministers by the people, was
not general at that time: Cano. Apo. 36.
as it may be gathered out of the. 36. Canon.

If you will believe Eusebius li. 2. eccle. histo. cap. 23. or Zuinglius in his
eccles. you shall Eusebius. Zuinglius
find that the Apostles did appoint and ordeyne James to be Bishop of
Nierusalem. But I will not now stand upon this matter, I shall have more
occasion to speak of it hereafter: in the mean time, this which I have said
is sufficient to satisfy your request, for the Apostles time. Touching that of
Luke, that it was done Church by Church, if you mean the ordering of ministers
by Paul and Barnabas, it is answered before, where I have showed that it
makes against you: if you understand by every Church, those Churches where
Paul and Barnabas were together, then do you expound Church by Church well:
else not. But this is not material. Election of ministers by the people not
general in the (...) of Cyprian.


Now that the electing of ministers by the people was not general in Cyprians
time, I prove by Cyprians own words. li. 1. epist. 4. where he speaking of
electing by the people says, quod apud nos quoque, and fere per prouincias
vniuersas tenetur, which also is observed with us, and almost throughout all
provinces etc. In that he says it was almost in every province, he plainly
signifies that there were some provinces, wherein this Cyprian. (...). 4.
manner and form of electing was not used.

When I say that the consent of the people was required in many places even to
Cyprians time, I do not deny, but that it was also required after Cyprians
time, neither do I speak any otherwise in that point, than Musculus Musculus.
has spoken in his common places: ti. de verbi. ministris, where he says
thus, haec forma electionis ad Cypriani vsque tempora in ecclesijs durauit.
etc. This form of election remained in the Churches until Cyprians time. I
know it was both before, and after Cyprians time, in many places: but that is
not the question (for it partly is, and shall more at large hereafter be
declared, that it was also otherwise both before and after Cyprians time) but
our question is whether it ought to be so at all times, or no, and at this
time, especially in this Church of England.

You say it appears that Cyprian in his. 4. epistl of his. 1. Book uses it
not as a thing indifferente. etc. Surely if Cyprians words be well considered
you will be found not The place of (...) examined.
to have reported truly of him: for he with other Bishops, answering the (...)
that was demanded of them touching Martialis and Basilides, whether (seeing
they were convicted of heinous crimes) they might still enjoy their office, and
minister unto the Lord, first, declares out of Exodus 19. Leui. 21. etc. of
what integrity and holiness those ought to be that serve the altar, and
celebrate divine sacrifices. Likewise they show that such precepts must be
obeyed, and heed taken, that none be chosen into the ministry, but such as
be blameless, signifying by the way, how greatly that people does offend, that
does communicate with a sinful priest, and consents to the unjust and
unlawful office of him, that is placed over them, showing out of the Prophet
Osee and the book of numbers, what punishment is due unto them, that be
contaminated with the sacrifice of a profane and unlawful priest: where upon
he brings in these words: propter quod plebs obseque^s praeceptis dominicis,
and deum metuens, a peccatore praeposito separare se debet, nec se ad sacrilegi
sacerdotis sacrificia miscere, cum ipsa maxim habeat potestatem vel eligendi
dignos sacerdotes, vel indignos recusandi. Quod and ipsum videmus de diuina
authoritate discendere, vt sacerdos plebe praesente sub omnium oculis
deligatur, and dignus atque idoneus publico iudicio, ac testimonio comprobetur.
etc. For which cause, the people obeying the commandments of the Lord, and
fearing God, ought to separate themselves from a wicked gouernoure, and not to
communicate in the sacrifices of a wicked priest, for so much as they
especially have authority, either to choose those priests which be worthy, or
else to refuse them which are unworthy. The which thing also we see to
proceed of the authority of God, that the priest should be chosen before the
face of all, the people being present, and that he which is sit and worthy,
should by the public judgment and testimony be approved, as the Lord
commanded Moses in the book of numbers saying, take Aaron thy brother, and
Eleazer his son, for Aaron shall be gathered to his fathers, and shall dye
there. God commanded the priest to be appointed before the whole sinagogue,
that is, he declares that the ordering of priests ought not to be, but ( sub
populi (...) is conscientia) by the knowledge of the people standing by, that
the people being present, vel detega^tur malorum crimina, vel bonorum merita
praedicentur. etc. either the faults of evil me^ might be bewrayed, or the
deserts of those which are good might be commended: and that that ordering
might be just and lawful, which shall be examined by the voices and judgment
of all. Which thing was afterward observed according to the rule of God, when
as Peter spoke unto the people, concerning the choosing of a bishop into the
place of Judas.

Where the words of Cyprian and the other Bishops be plain, that the ordering
of ministers ought to be in the presence of the people, to the intent they may
object any thing against them if they can, but not that it ought to be by their
voices and election, the which the example that he uses of Eleazer Number. 20.
and the words that he recites out of the first of the Acts, plainly declare,
for though Eleazer was placed in Aarons room in the presence of the people,
yet had they no voices in his election: No more had they in the election of
Matthias, though it were in their presence.

That also which follows in the same epistle does prove this to be their
true meaning, for alittle after, it is said, propter quod diligenter de
traditione diuina. etc. Wherefore it ought diligently to be observed and holden
as proceeding from the tradition of God, and the observation of the Apostles
(the which also is retained almost thoroughout all provinces) that, to the
intent orders should be rightly celebrated, all the next Bishops of the same
province, should assemble unto that people, to whom a gouernoure is to be
appointed, and that the Bishop should be chosen in the presence of the people,
which does fully know the life of every one. etc. so that Cyprians meaning is
to have the people present at the ordering of ministers, that if they know any
crime in them, they may object it: if not, with their silence allow of the
parties: for as the law says ta^iturnitas pro consensu habetur, silence is
taken for a consent. And to this purpose serve the places that he uses Numer.
20. Act. 1. and to no other, as the diligent reader may easily perceive. But
howsoever the words of Cyprian sound, certain it is, that neither that in the.
20. of Numeri, nor this in the. 1. of the Acts, can prove any election made by
the people.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 44. Lin. 1. No certain form of electing
ministers commanded in the scriptures.

But I say that in the whole scripture, there is no commandment that it
should so be, nor any example that makes therein any necessary or general
rule, but that it may be altered as time and occasion serves. For in such
matters not commanded or prohibited in scripture, touching ceremonies,
discipline, and gouernmente, the Church has authority from time to time, to
appointe that which is most convenient, for the present state: as I have
before declared.

T. C. Page. 32. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
But you say these examples are no general rules. It will fall out that you
have neither examples of all Apostles, nor of all Churches nor of (...) times.
Examples of all the Apostles, in all Churches, and in all purer times,
uncontrolled, and vnretracted, either by any the ^rimitiue and purer Churches,
or by any rule of the scripture, I think ought to stand. If it were a private
example of one, or in one place alone, or if it were countermaunded by any
other rule of the scripture, then the example were not always safe to follow.
But what if there be commandment also*

In the You are driu^ to a straight, when you are glad to search a mandatum out
of the ceremonial law.
eight of the book of numbers the Lord commands that the Levites, which
preached the word of God to the people in their several congregations, should
be brought before the Lord and before the people, and the people should lay
their hands upon the Leuits heads: which what other thing is it than to
declare their liking of them, and by that ceremony to consecrate them and set
them apart for that use of their ministry? And if you say that it were a
disorder that all should lay on their hands, I grant you: but so he speaks,
because the approbation was by all, and some in the name of the rest declared
that, by their laying on of hands.

But me thinks I here your old answer that this perteyneth not unto us, being
a thing done under the law: But take heed what you say, for if you will
admit neither the general examples of the new testament, nor the
commandments and examples of the old, take heed that you do not or ever you
be aware, spoil us of the chief and principal pillars and buttresses of our
religion, and bring us Not so, but you seem to bring us to plai^ ^udaisme.
to plain Catabaptistrie, which you say you are so afraid of.

For to prove the baptism of children and young infants, what stronger hold
have we than that God commanded in the old Testament, that they should be
circumcised, and examples thereof in the new Testament, for that the Apostles
baptized whole families, where, by all likelyhoode there were children. Now we
say that there is this commandment in the old Testament, of the ministers,
and there are examples in the new Testament general and throughout, why
should it not then be necessary in this as well as in the other? Besides that
in the This is a silly place to prove (...) general commandment.
6. of the Acts, the Apostles command that the Church should seek them out
Deacons, whom they might appoint over the poor.

Touching certain Ceremonies, I have showed that they are necessary, as namely
the sacraments.

And as for discipline and gouernmente, I have showed partly, and more
hereafter will be showed, that they are of the substance of the Gospel, if to
have excommunication be to have discipline, or if to have pastors, or Bishops
and Doctors and Deacons be gouernmente of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
You do still petere principium, and build upon a false ground: for I deny
that you have examples either of all, or of any of the Apostles: or that this
kind of election has bin in all Churches and in all purer times. etc. and
albeit, for the proof of this, sufficient is said before, yet will I add
something now also. All the places of scriptures that you have The diversity
of electio^s in the Apostles time.
hither to alleged, are Act. 1. Act. 6. Act. 14. and. 2. Cor. 8. which
places neither agree in persons that were to be chosen, nor in the manner and
form of choosing. For the first of the Acts is of an Apostle, the. 6. of
Deacons, the. 14. of Bishops, and the. 2. Cor. 8. of such as were joined with
Paul for the collecting and distributing of Alms. Al men do grant that the
calling and electing of an Apostle is immediately from God, and therefore does
differ from all other elections of Pastors, Deacons. etc. But to let this
pass: I pray you consider the diverse manner and form used in all these
places. In the first of the Acts, Peeter made an exhortation to the disciples,
he appointed out of what company the new Apostle should be taken: the
Apostles presented two, after prayers made, lots were given forth, and the
Apostle was chosen by lot, and not by voice, but immediately taken and reputed
with the eleven Apostles.

In the. 6. of the Acts, the twelve Apostles willed the whole multitude to
look out seven men of honest report. etc. to be Deacons, and the whole
multitude did choose seven and presented them to the Apostles: and the Apostles
prayed and laid their hands on them.

In the. 14. of the Acts Paul and Barnabas ordained ministers in every
Church, with praying and fasting.

In the second Corinth. eyghte. At Paul's request the Churches appoynte
certain to be collectours for the poor Saynctes with him: which of all
these examples would you follow? will you name them to the people, or shall
the people, name them too you? Will you have two put up together, and one of
them chosen by lotte? Or will you have the whole people for to choose, and you
to lay on hands: or will you only have the Bishops to choose? to be short,
will you pray only at the election, or will you both pray and fast? or have you
any commission to make a mixture of all those examples, and so to make one
rule, where unto all Churches at all times must of necessity be bound?

I told you before, that M. Calvin says plainly that out of that example in
the first of the Acts, no certain rule can be gathered of electing and
choosing of ministers: and M. Beza li. confess. ca. 5. is as plain, that there
can be no certain rule gathered out of the Beza.
6. of the Acts, or out of that in the first: his words be these. In the
election of Matthias lottes were cast, but for a peculiar cause, for it behooved
the Apostles to be chosen immediately of God: In the election of Deacons Luke
has not set down what the Church did observe: But in another place, we may
gather by Paul, that they of Asia used the holding up of hands, which manner
was usual with the most of the Graecians: wherefore there is no cause why any
man should ouercuriously prescribe here any certain rule. etc.

Now to rehearse what variety has bin used in the Churches touching this
election, Uarietie used in the electio^s in ye pr^tiue Churches. Calvin.
were needelesse, it shall be sufficient only to set down that which M.
Calvin speaks of it in his Insti. cap. 8. Sect. 60. etc. where first he
declares that the rule of S. Paul touching the qualities of a minister is to
be observed, and that he is to be examined according to the same. Then does he
show, how that there has not always one order bin observed touching the
electours and appointers: for sometimes none was chosen without the consent of
the whole people, and other sometimes the people committed the choice to the
Bishop and ministers or Seniors, except it were in the election of the Bishop.
And sometimes only the ministers did first choose, and then offer those whom
they had chosen to the magistrate, or to the Senate, or to the chief rulers,
who ratifyed the election if they liked it, if not, then did they choose out
other. etc. This variety of electing ministers does M. Calvin declare in that
place.

It appears in the. 35. or as some counts. 36. of the canons attributed to
the Apostles, Can. Apost. 36
that Bishops were not then chosen by the consent of the people, for that canon
speaks of such Bishops, as being appointed to some Church, were not received
by the people, and yet remained Bishops still. To the like effect is the. 18.
can. Con. Ancyra. Con: Ancyr. can. 18. Con. Antioch. can. 17. 18. Con: Laodic.
can. 12. Can. 13. T. C. seeks a commandment in the Ceremonial law, for the
election of the ministers of the Gospel. The place Numbers. 8. proves not his
purpose.
and the. 17. and. 18. of the Council of Antioch. In the. 12. Canon of the
Council of Laodicea it is decreed that the Metropolitan with other Bishops
adjoining should have the election of Bishops, and of such as are to be
preferred to a cure. And the. 13. Can. of the same council does forbid that
the elections of ministers should be committed to the people. So that you see
your manner of electing by the people not to have bin in all Churches in all
purer times.

It appears that you were put to a pinch for a commandment to establish
your manner and kind of electing ministers, when you are constrained to fetch
one out of the book of Numbers, and that nothing at all perteyning to your
purpose. For what one word is there in that place that has any shadow of your
election? First, the people there did not elect the Leuits: Secondly, they laid
their hands upon them: which I am sure you will not have the people to do in
the ordeyning of Bishops, for you say that only elders and ministers used to
lay on their hands. So that this place of the Book of Numbers does command
that which you will not admit, and speaks not one word of that for the
which you do allege it.

But tell me in good earnest, will you bind us to the observation of the
Ceremonial law also, as you have done before to the judicial? For what else is
there in that whole chapter, but laws touching ceremonies, and in that place
by you alleged especially? for there he speaks of the manner of purifying
of the Levites and of their offering: he speaks not of any election. For God
himself had chosen the Levites before, for the first borne of the children of
Israel. cap. 3.

I would to God men would but indifferently consider how undiscreetly you
allege the scriptures, lest you should seem to be void of scripture. You
say the people by laying on their hands did by that ceremony consecrate them.
Would you have the people to consecrate ministers by laying on of hands? do you
not care what absurdities, and contrarieties you speak? you make a distinction
in that which follows betwixt ordeyning and electing, and you say that
election perteyneth to the people, and ordeyning to the Bishop. Page 40. lin.
vlt. etc. Page 31. sect. 4.
And in another place: that the imposition of hands was not by the Church and
people, but by the Elders and Ministers. But if this be a commandment for us
now to observe, then must you recant that saying.

I do admit this Scripture as a portion of the Ceremonial law, but I do
not The dealings of T. C. tend to Iudaisme.
admit it as a perpetual commandment, because I know the Ceremonial law
is abrogated, except you will have all those Ceremonies which were used in
that place, and are contained in the same commandment, as of sprinkling them
with water, of shauing their bodies, of washing their clothes, of laying their
hands on the heads of bullocks. etc. practiced in ordering ministers of the
Gospel. Neither is this any title of Catabaptistrie, but yours smells of
Iudaisme, for you bound us before to the Judicial law, and now you will bind
us to the Ceremonial also: what remains but to say that Christ is not yet
come.

Circumcision is a figure of baptism, but the Leuiticall priesthood is no
figure of the ministry of the Gospel, therefore we may well prove the
baptizing of Infantes by circumcision, but we can not prove the ordering of
ministers of the Gospel by the ceremonies used about the Levites.

Those examples of the Apostles do well prove the baptizing of children,
because Gene. 17. Mat. 28.
they be grounded upon these general places of the Scriptures, Ego sum Deus
tuus. etc. I am thy God, and the God of thy seed. etc. and Mat. 28.
Baptizantes omnes gentes, Baptizing all nations. The contention is not whether
discipline. etc. be necessary, but whether one kind be necessary.


Of discipline also and government, I have something spoken before, and mind
to speak hereafter when further occasion is offered: in this place it is
answer sufficient to say, that the contention is not whether discipline or
government be necessary in the Church, or no, but whether this or that kind
of discipline and government be necessary, and whether there be one certain
kind and form of discipline and government to be used in the Church at all
times, and in all places. As for Pastors, Bishops, Doctors, Deacons. etc. they
be necessary ministers in the Church, but it does not therefore follow, that
there must be always one kind and form of government.

And I add, that howsoever in the Apostles time, that kind of electing and
calling ministers was convenient and profitable, now in this state of the
Church, it were most pernicious and hurtful.

T. C. Page 32. Sect. 6. 7.
You say that howsoever in the Apostles time. this use was of having the
consent of the church in the choice of their Pastor or Bishop, now in this
state it were most pernicious and hurtefull. Wherein, see how This is an
v^aduised collestion.
unadvisedly you condemn the churches of Geneua, of all France, of certain
of the Germayne churches, which keep this order. But you allege your reasons,
therefore those are to be considered, because they come so rare. For your manner
is, that if you can have but one writer new or old, of your side, or which
seems to be of your side, you run away with the matter, as though you had
scripture, reason, Doctors, and all.

I will therefore then take a view of your reasons, when as I shall have briefly
set down those reasons, whereby the perpetual equity, reasonableness, and
conueniencie of this order, that the church should have a stroke in her
ministers election, may appear.

Io. Whitgifte.
I condemn no Churches that have appointed any order for the electing of their
Pastors, which they think to be agreeable to their state, and most profitable
for them: for therefore I say, that no certain manner or form of electing
ministers is prescribed in the Scripture, because every Church may do therein
as it shall seem to be most expediente for the same. That may be profitable
for the Churches of Geneua and France. etc. which would be most hurtefull
to this Church of England. And therefore I say that howsoever this popular
kinds of electing was convenient or profitable in the Apostles time, yet in
this state of the Church of England, it would be pernicious and hurtful.

You say my manner is, that if I can have but one writer. etc. Truly I do not
stand so much in my own conceyte, neither am I so well persuaded of my own
wit and understanding, but that I greatly esteem the opinions of learned
men: and I think my self to have reason sufficient, when I have good and
learned authority, which is grounded both upon Scripture and reason. And to
put you out of doubt, if you be offended because I so do, you must be
offended still: For I had rather allege the authority of learned men, which
is grounded both upon the Scriptures and reason, than to stick to mine own
fancy, both without authority and reason, as those commonly do, which are
desirous of innouations, and have their heads filled with new devises.

But you will take a view of my reasons. etc. and I will first examine your
reasons severally, and then answer for my own.

An examination of the reasons which T. C. uses to prove the perpetual
equity, etc. of elections by the people.
Chap. 5. the. 1. Division.
T. C. Page 32. Sect. 8.
It is said amongst the Lawyers, and in deed reason which is the law of all
nations confirms it, Quod omnium interest, ab. omnibus approbari debet. That
which stands all men upon, should be approved of all men. Which law has
this sense, that if it may be, it were good that those things, which shall
bind all men, and which require the obedience of all should be concluded as
far as may be, by the consent of all, or at least by the consent of as many
as may be gotten. And therefore it draws much the obedience of the subjects
of this realm; that the statutes whereby the realm is governed; pass by the
consent of the most part of it, whilst they be made by them, whom the rest
put in trust, and choose for that purpose, being as it were all their acts.

Io. Whitgifte.
You use for your purpose a rule of the law, which you do not understand,
nor The first reason examined.
rightly interpret: for where as this word Debet, imports a necessity, you
expound it as a word of courtesy, saying, if it may be, and it were good to be
concluded: when as the law says, Debet approbari, it ought to be allowed. And
reason will the same, that where many men have interest in any thing, or have
any thing in common, whereof every of them has a private interest, right, or
property, there every man's consent should be had: as if a house, or any other
thing be common among half a dosen men by purchase, descent, or gift, and
five of them would burden that thing with any charge, or do any act to
prejudice the sixte man, it shall not bind him without his consent: for there
this rule is true. Further more a thing is said omnes tangere, to perteyne to
all, which is common either Pluribus vt vniuersis, or else Pluribus vt
singulis. In the first kind, are those things that pertayne to bodies
politic, as the body of a whole common wealth, City, Borough, Town,
College, Church. etc. Wherein (as the Lawyers say) this rule has no force.
The reason of the law is, because it being almost an impossible thing, for
all men in such a body to agree in one, and there being amongst men for the
most part (as it were) a natural inclination to dissent, and disagree one
from an other, there should never any law or order be made, if every singular
man's consent should of necessity be had: It is therefore sufficient in such
places and matters, if the laws, statutes, and customs of the place be
observed.

Wherefore the rule has only place in the second: that is, in things that
are This law can not take hold in the election of ministers.
common Pluribus vt singulis, to many severally, that is, wherein every man
has a propriety and particular right: as it is properly in lands,
possessions. etc. in the which the Minister can not be comprehended: for it
were a great absurdity, that in the election of the minister every singular
man's consent should of necessity be required: for then if any one froward
man in the whole parish were disposed to withstand the election, it could
never be ended: and this must necessarily come to pass, if you will build
upon this law.

And yet in such cases this law admits this general exception, if there be
especial The law as mitteth exceptions.
reason and cause why that thing which concerns many, should be done by
some other way, rather than by the consent of them, which have interest. And
these are taken for good reasons in this case: First, if it be rather
behouefull for the common wealth, and Church of God to do that which
concerns a number, some other way, rather than by the consent of every
particular man. Secondly, if it be for the more quiet estate of the common
wealth, not to have their consent. Thirdly, if it be better for the parties
themselves, to have it otherwise provided: Last of all, if it be against the
laws of God, or of the customs and laws of any Country.

If I were a Lawyer, I could tell you, that this law admits many exceptions.
What is more expedient for all men, than to have a good Prince, good
Counselors, good Judges. etc. and yet I think it were most pernicious to
have those offices committed to the election of the people.

But what need I strive with you in this matter? For if those things that be
concluded by Parliament, be by the consent of the most part of the Realm,
because the peoples consent is there in their knights of their shires, and
other Burgeses (as in deed it is, which you also confess) then have you no
more to say in this matter: for the book of ordering Ministers and Deacons.
etc. is allowed and granted by Parliament, and therefore the Bishops and
Ministers of this Church of England are chosen by the consent of the people,
nay (which is more) of the whole Realm, because they are ordained and chosen
according to that order and rule, which the whole realm in Parliament has
made and bound them selves unto.

But (by the way) if this ground of law be good in that sense that you
allege it, and be transferred to the civil state, it will be found very
dangerous, and tootoo much sauouring of popularitie: as in deed the whole
course of your doctrine is.

Chapter. 5. the. 2. Division.

So is it also when the question is to choose the Magistrate, Mayre, or
Bayliffe, or Constable of every town, which things if they have grounds in
civil affairs, they have much better in Ecclesiastical. For it is much
more unreasonable, that there should be thrust upon me, a governor, of whom
the everlasting salvation or damnation both of my body and soul does
depend, than him of whom my wealth and commodity of this life does hang.
Unless those upon whom he were thrust, were fools, or mad men, or
children, without all discretion of ordering themselves, which as I will
show, can not agree with those, that are the Church of God, and are to have a
Pastor. For they of the Church of God, although they be called sheep in
respect of their simplicity and harmlesnesse, yet are they also for their
circumspection wise as serpents, in the wisdom, especially which is to
salvation: and how No man ^keth vi^e a^ou^t of the people of God: but you
partly of (...), partly of popular affection, would have it seem so, thereby
to (...) hatred against us.
vile account soever you will make of them, they are the people of God, and
therefore spiritual, and forthwith those of whom saint 1. Cor. 2.
Paul says, the spiritual man discerns all things.

Io. Whitgifte.
The disorder of such popular elections has bin such, the contentions moved
Elections by the multitu^e are for ye most part tumultuous.
in them so great, the ambition of the persons standing in election so
notorious, the partial affection of the people inclining to their kinsfolks,
friends, or landlords. etc. so intolerable, to be short, the lack of
judgment and discretion in many of them so apparent, that that manner of
electing upon great considerations has bin altered in diverse places, and
desired to be altered in others also, by all those that are wise and discrete,
and that wish for quietness and good government. Neither is it true, that the
election of those officers which you name, is every where in the people. In the
best ordered Cities and towns it is otherwise: and experience does teach,
that those offices which are in the Princes bestowing, and some other to whom
she commits the same, are the best bestowed, and upon the most worthyest
persons, as Bishoprikes, the offices of Judges, Justices. etc.

In ecclesiastical affairs, it is much meeter, that such as have knowledge,
zeal, and care for the people, should place over them a meet and fit
Pastor, than that the choice of him should be committed to the multitude,
which is not only for the most part ignorant, but careless in such
matters, yea and oftentimes evil disposed, and commonly led by affection, as
friendship, hatred, fear. etc.

I know that Christian men are not called sheep because they be void of
reason: Christian men ^eepe.
For as Chrysostom says, Oues sunt, sed rationales, They are sheep, but
such as are endued with reason. And god does at one time or other (if they be
his) open his truth unto them, and indueth them with the spirit of discerning
betwixt true and false doctrine, in those things that do pertayne to their
salvation. But because God does in his good time open his truth unto them,
are they therefore always void of affection and error? or because some have
this spirit of discretion, is it therefore common to all, or to the most
part? In deed if you speak of the invisible Church, which is only of the
elect, then is it something that you say: but if you speak of the visible
Church, which is a mixture of good and evil, and wherein the evil are the
greater number, then has your saying no probability in it. And why may not
the Pope as well reason of this place. 1. Cor. 2. that he can not err in
matters of religion, Scripture un aptly alleged by T. C.
as you may, that Parishes can not be deceived in electing their pastors? for
he does allege this text for himself to the same purpose: but the meaning
of the Apostle is this: that he only which is ruled and governed by the
spirit of God, has the true knowledge of the mysteries of God, and is able to
discern the truth from falsehood. You can no more prove therefore, by this
sentence, that the Parishes can not err in choosing their Pastors, than the
Pope may do that himself, general Councels, and the Church can not err:
and surely the more I consider the matter, the more I marvel what your meaning
is in alleging this texts.

Chapter. 5. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 33. Sect. 2.
Moreover, reason and experience teaches, that it makes much to the profiting
of the Church under the hand of the Pastor or Bishop, that the Church love
him and reverence him. For the contempt and hatred of the minister for the
most part, stands not in his own person, but reaches even unto the
doctrine which he teaches. But the Minister that the Church desires, it
commonly best loves and most reuerenceth, and of the other side, hates and
contemns him, that is thrust upon them, therefore it makes much to the
profiting of the people in the doctrine of the Gospel, that the minister come
in, by their consent. Likewise, the people must by S. Paul his 1. Tim. 4.
rule, follow the good example of the Minister: but men will not likely
follow their examples, whom they love not, nor love them, which are thrust
upon them against their wills. Therefore it stands with the good
conversation and godly following of the steps of the minister, that he be
with the consent of the Church.

are dearly beloved of their flocks, which neither were elected by them,
desired of them, nor known unto them before. And I think verily that there is
not one parish in England which does the worse love or reverence their pastors
in that respect, excepts such only as you and your adherents have inflamed,
not only with the spirit of discord, but of disdain, and contempt also
toward all laws, orders, and persons, that be not in all points framed
according to their imaginations. But would you that a Papistical parish (such
as there may be diverse in England) should choose their Pastor, that they might
love him? Surely then would they not choose a Protestant. Or do men always
continue in loving of those, whom they have chosen? You know that experience
teaches the contrary: so long only do they love him, as he pleases them, and
serves their affections, which because he neither can nor ought to do,
therefore their affection of love is soon quenched: and they begin to hate
and to contemn him, and the rather because they did choose him. For in that
respect they think him more bound to please them.

And if it should happen (which may come to pass) that any Church should

election, or if it be made, that they confirm it not, by suffering him to
exercise any ministry. And if either the Churches round about do fail of
this duty, or the Church which is admonished rest not in their admonition,
then to bring it to the next Synod, and if it rest not therein, then the Prince
or Magistrate, which must see that nothing in the churches be disorderly and
wickedly done, ought to drive that Church from that election to an other which
is convenient. Now I will examine the reasons which you add to prove, that
although in times paste the church choosed their ministers, yet now it must
be otherwise.

the matter etc. and if they will not, then to bring it to the next Synod: if
that will not serve, then that the Prince or Magistrate must and ought to drive
that Church from that election, to an other more convenient? Where have you I
say, either commandment, or example of any such order in the whole
scripture? will you of your own head and brain take upon you to prescribe a
rule besides all Scripture? And dare you so boldly condemn an order taken by
the common consent of so great a Church as this of England is, because it is
not in all points correspondent to some examples in the scripture? Men may see
if they be not blind, what your meaning is. You think peradventure that if
this were once brought to pass, it should not be long or you were placed
somewhere, according to your desire. The like policy and practice has bin
used by others: look Zuinglius in his Ecclesi.

and therefore could not be without discretion of ordering them selves in
choosing their pastor: and now you say, if any church should by the most
part choose some unmeet man. etc. Whereby you confessr that they may be
deceived, contrary to your former words.

Secondly, your order is most vnperfitte, and full of intolerable
inconveniences: for The order which. T. C. prescribes un perfect, and full of
inconveniences.
who shall complain of this election to other Churches? And when complaint is
made, who shall call them together? when they be called together, what order
shall be taken for the avoiding of confusion and tumult? or who shall bear their
charges? or in what place shall they meet, or how often? Likewise If the
churches round about do fail in this duty. etc. who shall bring it to the
next Synod? or who shall summon the Synod? or in what place shall it be kept?
or at what stay shall the parishes be for a pastor, until the matter be
determined? or who shall complain to ye Prince and magistrate? or what if the
Prince will not drive them to a new election, but allow of the old? Do you not
see of what disorder, contentions, tumults, and inconveniences this your
disordered order would be the cause? For how many meetings of Churches should
we have? how many Synodes? what parts taking? what running up and down? what
loss of time? what cause of offense? what quarrels? yea what not?

But amongst al other things you have here appointed to ye Prince or magistrate

a good office, that he must stand and behold all this, and in the end only
drive the parish to a new election, which also you say that he must do.
Throughout your whole book you take from the civil Magistrate his whole
authority in ecclesiastical matters, and give unto him no more, (as I have
before declared) than the very Papists do, that is potestatem facti, and not
potestatem iuris. For he must only at your commandment execute such laws
and orders as you and your Seniors have devised. Again, considering the great
number of Parishes in this realm, the variety of men's minds, the diversity
of opinions in Religion, and the general inclination in the hearts of men to
dissent and disagree among them selves, it can not be, but that in short space
the Prince should be ouerpressed and surcharged with the composing and
ordering of these confused and tumultuous elections: so that she must be
constrained to let pass the care of the government of the common wealth, and
be wholly troubled with hearing and redressing these matters. Wherefore to
conclude, if you have no better reasons for your popular elections than these,
I think it will be long before you can persuade any reasonable or wise man, to
subscribe unto it. But now to the defense of my own reasons.

The diversity betwixt the Apostles times and ours, requires a diverse kind
of government, and of ordeyning Ministers.

First, because in the Apostles time, the Church was under the cross, and
therefore very few in comparison was there, that embraced the Gospel, and
commonly they kept together, or at the least met oftentimes, so that one of
them was thoroughly known to another, and they them selves could best judge who
among them was the fittest to teach and instruct, having always diverse fit
for that function. Now the Church is in prosperity, and therefore the number
that professes, great, and dispersed into diverse places, and in most parishes
not one fit for the ministry among them, or known unto them: so that they
should call they know not whom

T. C. Page 33. Sect. 4.
You say it was in the Apostles times under the cross, and therefore few, and
so might easily know one an other, who were fit for the ministry. But you
forget your self maruellously. For in the Apostles times, the Church (I mean
visible and sensible, for else how could it be persecuted) was It is not so
much to have the Gospel sown in many places, as to have it generally received
in a few.
sown not only throughout all Asia (which is the greatest part of the
world) but through a great part of Africa, and no small portion of Europe,
and now it is shut in a small corner of Europe, being altogether banished out
of Asia and Africa: And therefore there are not the There be many mo Christians
in profession now tha^ were at that time. For though the Gospel was then
dispersed in many places, yet was it professed but of few persons
tithe now, of thosethat professed the Gospel then, and what a conclusion is
this, the Church were few in number, because they were under the cross.

For to let pass both other scriptures, and stories ecclesiastical, have you
forgotten that which is said in the first of Exodus, that the more the
children of Israel were pressed and persecuted, the more they multiplied? Then
you say they kept together, and met often, and so knowing one another, were
best able to judge one of another. But herein you speak as one that has
small experience of persecuted Churches, for in the time of persecution, the
Christians that were in one great city, were feign to gather them selves out
of all the corners, and from all the ends of the city, to one place, being
not able to divide themselves into many parishes, both for other
considerations, and because they were not able to maynteine many ministers, and
Elders and Deacons, so that we read that the Church which was at Antioche,
wrote unto the Church at Jerusalem, and that of Jerusalem unto them of
Antioche, and S. Paul to the Church at Rome, at Ephesus, and at Philippos.
etc. Which speeches do declare, that by all likelihood, in one great city, they

one congregation, and therefore that must needs be scattered here and
there, and so could not have the commodity either of often meeting, or of
knowing one an other, so well, as where such a city is divided into many
Churches. Those that know the estate of France in the time of persecution, do
well understand, that every Church almost was gathered of towns, whereof
some were six miles, some seven, some more, from the place of meeting, and
keeping their congregations. And therefore could not meet so often, nor know
one an other so well, as we by the grace of God may do, which meet oftener,
and in less number than they do.

Io. Whitgifte.
I remember my self very well, and I also remember that no learned writer old
The multitude of Christians is now greater.
or new denies this to be true that I have said: you only say that in the
Apostles time the visible Church of Christ was sown not only throughout all
Asia which is the greatest part of the world but a great part of Africa and no
small portion of Europe, you prove it not, either by Scripture, story, or any
good writer. The Gospel I grant was preached in all these parts of the
world, yet was it not generally received in any one part of the world, no not
in any city, not at Jerusalem, where all the Apostles were, not in any the
least town. There were Christians at Jerusalem, at Antioche, at Ephesus, at
Rome. etc. But not the tenth part in any of these, or other places, in
comparison to the Jews, and the Gentiles that were there, and not Christians.
In the Apostles time the visible Church of Christ at Rome was but an handful in
comparison, to the times that followed, when the whole city was christened and
professed Christ, and had Christian Magistrates. I speak not of the dispersing
of the Gospel into diverse places, which I know was in the Apostles time, for
that commandment had they of Christ, that they should go into the whole
world. etc. but I speak of the multitude of Christians Mar. 16
gathered together in one place. In the Apostles time (as I said before) no one
country or kingdom, no one city, no one town, did wholly profess Christ, or
for the most part: now whole kingdoms, whole countries, whole nations,
profess him.

When Matthias was chosen, the whole Church, was gathered together in one
place. And so was it when the Deacons were chosen. Which thing now is
impossible, because of the multitude: so that though the election might be by
the whole Church in the Apostles time, when it was together in one place, yet
can it not be so now, seeing it is impossible for any one kingdom to contain
it. It might well be that the people in every city might meet in one place
without confusion or tumult, in the Apostles time, when as scarce the. xx. part
of the city were Christians: but it cannot be so now, when whole cities
profess Christ. Wherefore I speak of the multitude of Comparison made in
respect of the multitude in one place, no^ dispersed.
Christians gathered together in one place, not of the multitude dispersed
throughout the whole world, though it is not to be imagined that the number of
the Christians then dispersed through the whole world, is comparable to the
number of Christians which at this day be in Europe.

Now few Christians was there at Jerusalem not long before it was destroyed,
being above. 40. years after Christ? Does not Eusebius Lib. 3. cap. 5.
testify that they all were received into a little town called Pella? and yet
the Apostles had spent much time and labor in preaching there: but the number
of such as did not profess Christ was infinite in that city at that time, if
we believe histories, and especially Josephus de bello Judah. Lib. 7. cap. 17.
wherefore your opinion of the multitude of Christians in the Apostles time, in
comparison to those that be now, is but a very dream.

It is a very good reason to say, that because the Church was then under
Persecution does both diminishe and increase ye number of professors.
the Cross, therefore few in comparison embraced the Gospel (for sodde I
say) because notwithstanding the number of true professors do increase rather
than diminishe in the time of persecution, yet is it not so with hypocrites,
and dissemblers, who would seem to profess the Gospel, and whom also we must
count professors, because we see not their hearts. This is manifest by this
example. In the time of King Edward when the Gospel was in prosperity, how
many was there in London that seemed to be earnest and zealous professors of
the same: but when the time of persecution came under Queens Marie, what became
of that number? how few was there then in comparison? do you not think that
if God should send a trial there would be found in that city many false
brethren? Moreover in the time of prosperity true Christians may without
danger show themselves, and remain in their cities, though the number be
never so great: but in the time of persecution they are dispersed into sundry
places.

We may learn in the. 8. of the Acts, that the Church wholly remained at
Jerusalem, until that persecution wherein Paul was a doer, and that then they
were dispersed: shall we not then say that at Jerusalem the number of
Christians by reason of persecution, were few in comparison? True it is that
this dispersing was the cause why the Church of Christ was more enlarged, yet
in the mean time was the number of Christians at Jerusalem meruelously
diminished. Thus then you may understand if you please, that this is a good
reason to say, the Church was then in persecution, and therefore very few
incomparison, that embraced the Gospel, both in the respect of the visible
Church generally, and also in respect of the same Church particularly in every
ceuntrey or city. And yet it is true that Sanguis Martyrum est semen
Ecclesiae, The blood of Martyrs is the seed of the Church, but that seed
must have time to grow in: and I speak of the external professors of the
Gospel.

That which you write to overthrow my words touching the keeping together and
often meeting of such Churches as be persecuted, confirms my meaning, for I
say they kept together in the time of persecution, and you affirm the same,
whereupon I also conclude, that therefore one of them must of necessity be well
known to another. And although our assemblies in time of prosperity be
peradventure as frequent as Conference in the time of per secution, is a cause
of better knowing one another.
theirs is, or rather more frequent, yet have we not such occasion to confer
one with another, or to consider one another, or to know one another as they
have, for they then admit none into their society at their meetings, but
such as are known to be brethren, and of whose Religion and zeal they have
good trial. And I think that those which have been exercised either in
France, or elsewhere, in any such time of persecution, know this to be true,
that they know none so thoroughly, or are acquainted with none so entirely, as
with such who have been with them in the time of persecution. You would feign
if you could, confute a known truth, and a manifest thing: for who would
deny, but that such as keep together in the time of persecution, must of
necessity be known among themselves, and best judge who is fittest among
them, for any function?

Secondly in the Apostles time, all or the most that were Christians The church

were virtuous and godly, and such as did sincerely profess the word, and
therefore the election of their pastor might safely be committed to them: now
the Church is full of Hypocrites, dissemblers, drunkardes, whoremongers. etc. so
that if any election were committed to them, they would be sure to take one
like to themselves.

T. C. Page, 34. Sect. I.
To your second difference I answer, that in deed there be Hypocrites in our
Churches now, and so were there then, but more now than then: I grant you
that also, but there is no great danger in them, as touching the election of
the minister or Bishop, for that in such open and public actions that come
into the eyes of all men, there is no good man will do so sincerely, so
holily, as they will do, although it be fainedly. The hurt that they do, is
in closer and secreter matters. But where you say our Churches are full of
drunkards and whoremongers: besides that you utter or ever you be aware, how
evil success the preaching of the Gospel has had here (for want of
discipline and good Ecclesiastical gouernmenie) you bewraye a great
ignorance. For although (a) A dangerous assertion tending to the doctrine of
the Anabaptists.
there be Hypocrites, which bear the face of godly men in the church, whose
wickedness is only known to God, and therefore can not be discovered by men,
yet in (*) the churches of Christ, there be no drunkardes nor whoremongers, at
least which are known. For either upon Admonition of the Church they repent,
and so are neither drunkardes nor whoremongers, or else they are cut off by
excommunication (if they continue stubberne in their sins) and so are none of
the Church, and therefore have nothing to do in the election of the Minister
of the Church. And me thinks you should not have been ignorant of this,
that although there be tares in the flower of the Church, which are like the
wheat, and therefore being ground, easily meets together Mat. 13.
in the loaf, yet there are no acornes which are bread for swine. And although
there be goat^s amongst the flock of the Church, because they have some
likelyhoode with the sheep, feedyng as Mat. 25.
they do, giving milk as they do, yet in the Church of Christ there are no
swine, nor hogs, it pertains to God only to sever the tares from the
wheat, and the goats from the sheep: but the Churches can discern between
wheat and acornes, between swine and sheep.

Io. Whitgifte.
There be not only Hypocrites (which deal syncerely in nothing, no not in
publyke actions) but there be such also as be corrupt both in Religion and
life, who would no doubt be as corrupt in elections (if they might have to
do therein) as they are in other matters.

In saying that the Church is now full of Hypocrites, drunkards, whoremongers.
Drunkards and whoremo^gers in the visible church.
etc. I derogate no more from the good success that the preaching of the
Gospel has had, than the like, or greater faults did, from the same in the
Church of Corinthe, and Galatia. The Church is a net that gathers together

corn: and for one that profitably hears the word of God, three do the
contrary, as the parable of the sower declares. There be many called but few
chosen: And the gate is wide that leads to perdition: therefore it is no
discredit to the Gospel, or to the preaching thereof, nor yet to the good
government of the Church, to have many wicked and ungodly persons, which cannot
possible be rooted out, until the time of Harnest: but this has been always
an Anabaptisticall cavil against the true Church of Christ, and lawful
government thereof, as Bullinger declares Lib. ^. aduersus Anabap. Bullinger.
And undoubtedly if this were a good argument to prove that the Gospel is not
preached sincerely, then Esai, Jeremy, and other of the Prophets, which had
preached among the people many years, and smally prevailed with them, either
concerning doctrine or manners, preached not sincerely.

Whereas you say that in the Church of Christ there be no drunkards or
whoremongers, at the least which are known. etc. either do you greatly
ouershoote your self, and forget the great crimes that were known to be in
the Church of Corinthe: or else would you secretly bring in the error of the
Anabaptists, which say, that, not to be the true Church of Christ in the which
there appears manifest crimes: for the declaration of the A branch of
Anabaptisme.
which error and confutation also, I refer you to the third book of Bull*
aduersus Anabap and the. 2. and. 3. chapter: where you may likewise learn what
profit has cenie to this and the like Churches, where the Gospel is
professed by the preaching of the word, though many wicked still remain in the
same. I grant you that these vices when they be known ought to be punished:
But if, either because those that be in authority do not their duty
therein, or else those vices continue notwithstanding, therefore you will
conclude that this is not the Church of Christ, I tell you plainly, that you
have already entered into one branche of Anabaptisme.

It cannot be denied but that the evil are continually mirt with the good in
this world, even in the most purest Church: and that then they abound
especially, when the Gospel is in prosperity: so that this is a good cause
why the election of ministers may not safely be committed to the common people.

Io. Whitgifte.
They were then diligently taught, and they gave them selves wholly to learn,
because it was a time of persecution, in the which men be commonly best
disposed, and sequestered (as it were) from all worldly cares, lookyng
continually to fall into the hands of the persecutors: now, though they be
in diverse places well taught, yet because they have not such a sense, and
feeling of the word in the time of prosperity, as they have under the cross
(when the Church of Christ is purest) the election of their Ministers can not
be so safely committed unto them now, as it might be then. But why have you
not answered my reason? for as yet that is untouched.

Fourthly, in the Apostles time there was in the Church no Idolaters, The

no superstitious persons, no Papists: now the Church is full of Papists,

should have, if the election of the^, were committed to their several parishes?

T. C. Page 34. Sect. 3.
I see that when a man is out of his way, the further he goes the worse.
Before you placed in the church whoremongers and drunkardes, as filthy swine
in the Lords courts, now you bring in Papists, Idolaters, and Atheistes
which are not only filthy, but also poisoned and venomed beasts. I am not
ignorant of that distinction, which says that there be in the Church, which
are not of the Church, and those are Hypocrites as is before said: but I
would gladly learn of you, what Scripture there is to prove, that Idolaters
and Papists and Atheistes are in the Church. when Saint Paul The place is
not rightly vn^.
calls all such without the church and with whom the Church has nothing
to do, nor they with the church: you might as well have placed in the
church, Wolves, Tigers, Lions, and Bears, that is tyrants and persecutors.
For those ye speak of, and (in the judgment of men and of the church) as
well shut out of it as they, in the eye of the Lord, they may be of the
church, and so may and are sometimes the persecutors them selves: so that the
election of the church, is not, nor ought not to be hyndered by those that
have nothing to do with it. But now I hear you ask me, what then shall
become of the Papists and Atheistes, if you will not have them be of the
church? I answer that they may This is true in the common wealth of the
Turke^, but not in this common wealth.
be of, and in the common wealth, which neither may, nor can be of, nor in the
church: And therefore the church having nothing to do with such, the
Magistrate Where find you this (ought*)
ought to see, that they join to hear the Sermons in the place where they
are made, whether it be in those parishes where there is a church, and so
preaching, or where else he shall think best, and cause them to be examined,
how they profitte, and if they profit not, to punish them, and as their
contempt grows, so to increase the punishment, until such times as they
declare manifest tokens of vn^epentantnesse, and then as rotten members, that
do not only no good, nor service in the body, but also corrupt and infect
others, cut them off. And if they do profit in hearing, then to be adjoined
unto that church, which is next the place of their dwelling.

Io. Whitgifte. How Papist^ etc. be in the Church.

You must of necessity admit this distinction (some be of the Church, and
some be only in the Church) else can you not make any visible Church, for we
only know, who be in the Church: but who be of the Church is known to him
alone, who knows those that be his. If they communicate with us in hearing
the word, and receiving the Sacraments, though otherwise they be drunkardes,
supersticious, or infected with errors in doctrine. etc. yet must we count
them in the Church, until they be cut of from it by excommunication. Wherefore
whoremo^gers, Papists, Idolatrous and superstitious persons, though they be
known to be such (if they do communicate with us in the word and sacraments)
are to be counted in the Church, until they be orderly secluded from the same.
And yet there may be Papists, Atheistes, and such like, though they be not
commonly known to be such. And you know well enough, that they which in
deed are Papists in opinion, yet if they be content to conform them selves
to the outward orders of the Church, would stand in their own defense
against him that should accuse them. They (...) are in the Church, and not of
the Church, are not hypocrite^ only. T. C. eueth and place against himself.


Neither is it true that only hypocrites are such as be in the Church, and
are not of the Church. That chapter which you quote in your margent, and
almost the whole Epistle does declare the contrary. For the incestuous
Corinthian was in the Church, until he was excommunicated. And the Apostle
there speaking of whoremongers, Idolaters. etc* says: Si quis cum frater
appelletur fuerit s^ortator. etc. If any which is called ^. Cor. 5.
a brother, be a fornicatour, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a rayler, or a
drunkarde, or an extortioner, with such one eat not. By the name of brethren
were those only then called, which did profess themselves to be Christians,
and were so accounted to be. And master Calvin speaking against the like
error of the Anabaptists, after that he had spoken of hypocrites in the
Church, adds and says: Nonnunquam etiam admixti Calvin aduers. Anabap.
contemptores dei vitae dissolutae, and flagitiosae, aut qui sibi cauebunt, ne
reprehendantur ab hominibus, sed interim ostendunt se nullo dei timore, nulla
reuercntia tangi: Oftentimes also there are mingled contemners of God, men of
dissolute and wicked life, or such as will be sure to keep them selves out of
danger of men's reprehension, when as notwithstanding they show themselves not
to be touched with any fear or reverence of God.

If you mean that place. 1. Cor. 5. where S. Paul says: Si quis cum frater
appelletur. etc. If any man which is called a brother. etc. and think that
thereby they are secluded from the external society of the Church, you take
the words of S. Paul amiss, as the Anabaptists did: to whom (obiecting that
place) M. Calvin answered in his book written against them, in this manner:
Quod autem vetat Paulus cum his cibum sumere Ibidem
qui sunt vitae dissolutae, id ad priuatam consuetudinem pertinet, no^ ad
publicam co^munionem. VVheras Paul forbids that we should eat with them
which are of a dissolute life and behavior, that perteyneth only to private
familiarity, and not to the public communion. Now if we ought to receive the
Communion with them, we ought also to account them in the external society of
the Church. But why do you thus seek to shifte of those matters, which you
can not answer? Is it not certain that there is in the external society of
the Church a far greater number of such, than there was in the Apostles
time? which if it be true (as it can not be denied) then do I still affirm
that the election of the minister can not be safely committed to the people.

It is well that you take upon you to prescribe unto the Magistrate how to deal
with such as be not in the Church: I pray you where find you any such manner of
dealing toward them, appointed unto the civil Magistrate? if you have any
scripture for it, why do you not allege it? if you have none, what presumption
is entered into you, thus imperiously to prescribe laws unto Magistrates? But
what if there be plain scripture, that they ought not to be admitted to the

neither cast ye your pearls to swyne.

Your distinction betwixt the Church and the common wealth, if it were in
Neroes or Dioclesians time might be admitted without exception, but in my
opinion it is not so fytte in this time, and especially in this kingdom. May
he be a member of a Christian common wealth, that is not in the Church of
Christ? if you had said that he may be in the power, and at the will and
pleasure of a Christian Magistrate, that is not in the Church of Christ, I
could well have lyked of it: but it can not yet synke into my head that he
should be a member of a Christian common wealth, that is not also a member of
the Church of Christ, concerning the outward society. M. Musculus in my
judgment speaks truly against this distinction of yours betwixt the Church
and a Christian common wealth in his com. pla. ^it. de magistra. Let the

of errors, have diverse Magistrates and lawmakers, some profane, and some

ecclesiastical ceremonies, but in all their life, in every place, at all
times, in all things, actions and studyes: that according to the Admonition of
the Apostle. 1. Cor. 10. whether he eats or drinks, or whatsoever he does,
he does it to the glory of God. etc. wherefore that distinction of
ecclesiastical and profane laws, can have no place in it, because there is
nothing in it that is profane, seeing that it is a holy people unto the Lord
God, and the Magistrate is holy and not profane, his authority holy, his
laws holy. etc. be it therefore far from the Church of Christ that it should
be partly holy, partly profane. etc. But all this from the purpose, and you
make to many frivolous digressions from the matter which compels me also in
following you, to do the like.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 45. Sect. 2.
Fifthly, in the Apostles time there was no Church established, being In the
Apostles time no church established, and no christian Magistrate.
then no Christian Magistrates, and therefore the state of the Church was
popular: now there is Christian Magistrates, and a Church established, and
subject to rulers. etc.

T. C. Page 35. Sect. 1.
If there be no churches established, because there were no Christian
Magistrates, then the churches of the Apostles were not established. And it is
absurd to say that the Ministers now with the help of the Magistate, can
lay surer foundations of the church, or build more cunningly or
substancially, than the Apostles could, which were the master builders of the
church of God, and as for the consu^mation of the body of the church, and the
beauty of it, seeing it consists in Jesus Christ, which is the head, that is
always joined unseparably in all times of the cross, and not the cross with
his body, which is the church. I can not see why the churches under persecution
should not be established, having both the foundation and the nethermost
parts, as also the top, and highest part of the church, as well as those
which have a christian Magistrate. If in deed the Magistrate, whom God have
sanctified to be a ^ourse unto his church, were also the head of the same,
then the church could not be established without the Magistrate, but we
learn that although the godly The Magistrate is head of the common wealth, and
but a member of the Church by T. C. his judgment.
Magistrate be the head of the common wealth, and a great ornament unto the
church, yet he is but a member of the same. The church may be established
without the Magistrate, and so that all the world, and all the devils of hell
can not shake it, but it can not be in quiet, in peace, and in outward
surety, without a godly Magistrate. And therefore the church in that respect
and such like prayseth God and prays for the Magistrate, by the which it
enjoys so singular benefits. Thereupon you conclude, that the church was
then popular, which is as untrue as the former part. For the church is
governed with that kind of government, which the Philosophers that write of
the best common wealths, affirm to be the best. For in respect of Christ
the head it is a Monarchy, and in respect of the auncientes and pastoures,
that govern in common, and with like authority amongst them selves, it is an
Aristocratie, or the rule of the best men* and in respect that the people
are not secluded but have their interest in Church matters, it is a
Democratie, or a popular estate. An image whereof appears also is the
policy of this realm, for as in respect of the Queen her Majesty, it is a
Monarchy, so in respect of the most honorable Council, it is an
Aristocratie, and having regard to the Parliament, which is assembled of all
estates, it is a Democratie. But you should have showed how this difference
of having a Christian Magistrate, and having none, ought to bring in a
diversity, in the choice of the Pastor by their church: it were not hard if
one would spend his time so unprofitably, to find out an hundred
differences, between a persecuted Church, and that which is in peace, but
seeing you can show me no reason, why the Church may not choose her
ministers, as well under a godly magistrate, as under a tyrant, I will be bold
to show you, how that if it were lawefull to break the order of God, it were
meeter in the time of persecution, that the election should be in some others,
discreate and learned persons hands, to be made without the consent of the
church, than in that time when there is a godly magistrate, and that it is
then most convenient to be chosen by the church.

Io. Whitgifte.
There was then no Church established in any Civil government, because How
the Church was not established in the Apostles time.
the Magistrates did then persecute, and not defend the Church. The Church
in the Apostles time was established in doctrine most perfectly: in
discipline, government, and ceremonies, as was convenient for that time, and as
the Church may be in time of persecution: but the time was not yet come,
whereof the Prophet Esaias. 49.
said: Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and Princes shall be thy nursing
mothers: therefore it was not established in any civil government, neither did
it so publikcly and openly show it self. The Gospel and the Church was in
Queen Mary's time here in England, but it was persecuted, not established,
not maynteyned, not allowed of, nor professed by the public magistrate, and
the laws of the land: and therefore of necessity a great difference
betwixt the gouernmente of it then, and the gouernmente of it now: the
outward show of it then, and the outward show of it now: the placing of
Ministers then, and the T. C. often offends in ignorance of the Eiench*
placyng of them now. My meaning and my words be plain, you needed not to
have offended again (as almost contynually you do) in the ignorance of the
Elench whylest you do not reason nor answer ad idem.

If you speak of the Church, as it is a communion and society of the
faithful and elect only: and of the government thereof, as it is only
spiritual, then is it most certain, that the Church is as thoroughly
established, as perfectely governed, as gloriously decked and beautified in the
time of persecution, as it is or can be under the civil Magistrate: But if you
speak of the external society of the Church, which comprehends both good
and evil, and of the outward government of it, then neither it is, nor can be
in such perfect state, nor so thoroughly established, or outwardly adorned in
the time of the Cross, as it is and may be under a Christian Prince. The
ignorance of this distinction of the Church, and of the government thereof (of
the which I have spoken more at large in an Tract. 2.
other place) causes you to fall into so many and so gross erroures
concerning the same.

You say, that if the Civil Magistrate were the head of the Church. etc.
Christ The Prince head of the Church.
only, and properly is the head of the Church, for it is his body, but yet in
the respect of the external society of the same, and the Supreme authority
that is given of GOD to the Prince, over his people in all causes, he may be
also in that respect called the head of the Church. etc.

Chrysostom. in Epistol. ad Philip. Homel. 13. gives this name to certain
women, Chrysostom.
of whom he says thus: Videntur mibi istae mulieres caput fuisse Ecclesiae
quae illic erat: These women seem to me to have bin the head of the Church
which was there. And therefore a learned man answering Hosius, who reproved
Vergerius for moving yt king Iaco. Andraea*
of Polonia to take vopen him to be the head of that Church, says on this
sort: As the Church of Christ in earth is but one body, so has it but one
head (as the Apostle teaches) which is Jesus Christ, who is always present
with his Church, and governs it with his holy spirit etc. but because this
Church being visible, is not only ruled by the word, but by the sword of the
magistrate also, appointed by God, therefore we say, there are so many
heads of Churches, as there are governors of countries. So that you see the
magistrate to be the head and chief governor of a particular church in this
respect, that it is a visible society, and must have besides the spiritual,
an external government also: whereof because the civil Magistrate is the head
and chief, therefore it can not be therein established without the civil
magistrate. Your spare speches for the authority of the Magistrate in the
government of the Church, I will note in a several place by themselves, and
therefore do I the lyghtlyer pass them over in this place: In the mean time
this is no good argument to say, that the Magistrate is but a member of the
Church, therefore he is not the head and chief gouernoure thereof in earth:
for the head though it be the chief, yet is it a part of the body. But you
still confound the visible and invisible Church of Christ, the spiritual
and external government of the same, which confusion may make you seem to
say something, to such as do not diligently consider it, when in very deed
you say nothing, to the overthrow of any thing that I have answered.

The Church may be established without the magistrate touching true faith, and
the spiritual government of it by Christ in the heart and conscience of man,
How yt church may be established without a Magistrate.
but not touching the visible society, and the external government. Upon this
confusion also is that grounded which follows, that the Church in the
respect of Christ the head is a Monarchy. etc. For when I said that the state
of the Church was popular in the Apostles time, I spoke of the outward form,
show, and government of it: which therefore I call popular, because the
Church it self, that is the whole multitude, had interest almost in every
thing, especially whylest the Church yet remained at Jerusalem.

I know that all these three kinds of gouernmentes may be mixte together
after diverse sorts, but yet the state of government is named according to that
which most rules, and bears the greatest sway: as when matters are most
commonly governed by the consent of the more part of the people, the state is
called popular: when by diverse of the best and wysest, it is called optimorum
status, when by one it is called a Monarchy: as in this Realm in the Court
of Parliamente, although all the states be represented, yet because the
judgment, confirmation, and determination rests in the Prince, therefore
the state is neither Aristocratie, nor Democratie, but a Monarchy: Even so in
the Apostles time, (especially, as I have said, whylest the Church remained
at Jerusalem) though they might be counted Optimates, yet because most
things in gouernmente were done by the consent of the people, therefore the
state for that time was popular.

You say, that I should have showed how this difference of having a
Christian Magistrate, and having none, ought to bring in a diversity in the
choice of the Pastor by the churches: I have showed you before the reasons of
it: And now I add this, that for as much as the Magistrate is the chief and
principal Gouernoure of the Churches under Christ, and ought to have a
special care and regard to and for the same: It is not meet that any thing
touching the gouernmente of the Churches, or any publyke function perteyning
thereunto, should be otherwise done, than he shall think convenient and
profitable for the present state of it. And therefore well says M. Musculus
in his common places, titu. de verbi ministris, Musculus.
It is not conueniente that those things which are publicly to be done, or
which concern the people subject unto them, or to be short, are such as
concern Religion, and in that respect perteyne unto them (except we will
say with the fantastical Anabaptists, that Christians may not be
Magistrates) should be done without the consent and knowledge of the civil
Magistrate. And again, wherefore for the condition of time, necessity
required, that the Magistrates and Princes by the means of a few men, which
were of excellent judgment, and had a care that the Church of Christ should be
provided for, might hereunto be induced, that they might appoint faithful and
learned Pastors over their subjects. And titulo de magistratibus, speaking of
the Civil magistrate he says, First, that he should place ministers of
Churches where they are wanting, whether he chooses them himself, or
confirms them which are chosen of others by his commandment: For it is not
convenient, that any man should take upon him any public offices in the
Church, without the authority of the public magistrate. But (you will say)
it was otherwise in the primitive Churches, in which the prelates of the
Churches were chosen of the ministers and the people: I answer: Such was then
the state of the Churches, that the ministers were not otherwise to be chosen,
because they had not a Christian magistrate: if you call back the manners of
those times, first call back the conditions and state of them also. The Prince
has to see that all things be done in the Church orderly, and profitably,
and therefore has he the altering and changing of such elections.

Your offering of an hundredth differences between a persecuted Church, and
that which is in peace, shall go with that brag which you used Fol. 22.
where you offered twenty to one. etc. But to what purpose make you this offer?
the more differences there are between them, the more is my cause justified.
But you will be bold to show meehow that if it were lawful to break the
order of God. etc. and I will also be as bold to answer your reasons
severally.

Chap. 6. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page 36. Sect. 1.
In the time of persecution a church chooses an unlearned minister, or one
that is wicked in life, howesoeuer it be, he is unfit, the Churches round
about by their ministers or Elders, admonish this church of her fault, and
move to correct it, the Church will not by no means be admonished, what can
now the other churches do in the time of persecution? if they excommunicate
the whole church, it is a hard matter, and yet if they may do that, there
is all they can do: the evil is not remedied, which may be easily taken away,
where there is a godly Magistrate, and the Church (as is before said)
compelled to a better choice. So you see that there are This is but one and yet
none in deed: for the case you put is very unlikely se the time you speak of.
inconveniences in the choosing of the Pastor and other the governors of the
church, by the church, in the time of persecution, which are not in the time
of peace, under a christian Magistrate.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is your only reason, to prove that in a Church persecuted, it is meeter
for the Minister to be chosen without the consent of the Church, than in a
Church being in prosperity. And surely it is even like to your reasons in
other matters: for first, that which you say of the Churches round about
(for admonishing, correcting, or excommunicating that Church, that shall
choose an unmeet minister) is not to be found in all the Scripture, either
in commandment or example, and it is a mere devise of your own head.

Secondly, it is most unlike, that the Church in the time of persecution
should choose an unmeet or a wicked minister: because those that be persecuted
themselves be godly, and well disposed, and careful to have such a one, as
they may safely commit themselves unto. For though in the time of
persecution there may be some hypocrites, that will for a time join
themselves with the Godly, yet the most part do of a conscience that which
they do, else would they not endure persecution: wherefore if ever the
election of their minister may safely be committed unto them, it may then so be
especially. Lastely, in the time of persecution, they have no Magistrate, they
be all equal, neither is one bound to obey another by any civil law, none
has chief and special care over the rest, as Magistrate to compel:
wherefore it can not be otherwise then, but that such offices and functions
should be chosen by a common consent, neither can there be therein, in that
time, the half part of inconuentences that are in the same, in time of
prosperity, as any man of any consideration may evidently perceive.

Chap. 6. the seventh Division.
T. C. Page 36. Sect. 2. 3.
Now I will show you Where find you that I think so.
which think that the consent of the Church in their minister, can not
stand with the time of a christian magistrate, that it has not only stood,
but has been confirmed in their times and by them. In codice Iustiniani it is
thus written, following the doctrine of the holy Apostles The words of this
constitution are craftily suppressed.
etc. we ordeyne, that as often as it shall fall out, that the ministers place
shall be boyd in any city, that voices be given of the inhabiters of that
city, that he of thrce (which for their right faith, holiness of life, and
other good things are most approved) should be chosen to the Bishoprike which
is the most meet of them. Also Carolus Magnus, which was the first German
(a) He was Fran little non Germanorum primus Imperator: for Conradus his nephwe,
and Otho did first translate the empire from France to Germany* as some
think.
Emperor in. 63. distinct. sacrorum canonum says, being not ignorant of the
holy Canons, that the holy Church in ye name of God should use her honor the
freelyer, we assent unto ye ecclesiastical order, that the Bishops be chosen
by election of the Clergy and people, according to the statutes of the canons
of that diocese.

In the. 63. distinction it appears, that Ludouicus Carolus his son
decreed, that he should be Bishop of Rome, whom all the people of Rome should
consent to choose.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where do I say that the consent of the Church in the choice of their minister,
cannot stand with the time of a Christian magistrate? I have said that
howsoever in the Apostles time, that kind of electing ministers was
conueniente, now in this state of the Church it were pernicious and hurtful:
which to be most true, the differences of the times before by me alleged,
do prove. The civil magistrate may commit this election to such as he likes
best, and may use that manner and kind of choice, which he thinks to be most
convenient for that Church, whereof The proofs of T. C. improve his purpose.
he has the chief care next unto God: And these proofs that you here bring
in to justify your cause, in my opinion do quite overthrow the same. For it
appears to have bin in the power of Emperors and civil magistrates, to
appoynte the manner and form of such elections: why else should they have
needed to make any laws or constitutions for that matter? It is true that
Musculus Lo. com. tit. de magistra. speaking of the civil Magistrate says,
Prudenter autem and magna. etc. But he must wisely and very Muscul.
warilye order the election of ministers, seeking nothing else but that the
flock of the Lord might be provided for. He shall choose not only such men as
are holy, but such as are also able to teach. He shall flee simonie more than a
dog or snake But he shall use that manner of election, which may be most
profitable for the Churches: And, for somuche as he is not able of himself to
do all things which perteine hereunto, he shall use the help, and aid of
faithful men, and of those that fear God, upon whose shoulders he may lay
the care or burden, whether they be within the order of the ministry of the
word or of an other profession, but notwithstanding in such sort, that he
him self do know them which are chosen, and if they seem meet do by his
authority and power confirm them.

But to come to your authorities. The words that you do allege in codice
Iustiniani, T. C. subtly concealeth the words of his author that make against
him.
must somewhere else be sought for, I think your authoure Illiricus is
deceived in quoting that place: for surely I cannot understand that they are to
be found in that book. But from what authoure soever they come, you have
subtillie left out the words that expound his meaning and make directly against
you. Wherefore I will recite them word for word as they are reported in
Illiricus, the authoure, out of whom you have borrowed them: Sequentes igitur
doctrinam. etc. Following the doctrine of the holy Apostles, in that, that most
pure and vncorrupt Priests ought to be chosen, which are appointed for that
cause chiefly, that by their prayers they might obtain the favor of the most
merciful God toward common wealths: we do decree by this present
constitution, that as often as it shall happen the room of any priest to be
void, the inhabitants of the same city shall give their voices of three,
which in true faith, holiness of life, and in all other good things are
approved and allowed of, that of these, he which shall be most meet, might
be chosen Bishop. The Emperor says that he follows the doctrine of the
Apostles in this, that they prescribe what manner of men are to be chosen (
sci^integerrimi and incorruptissimi most pure and most vncorrupt.) not in the
manner or kind of electing, as you would seem to make the Reader believe in
noting these words only (following ye doctrine of the holy Apostles) and leaving
out that which follows, and declares wherein he meant to follow their
doctrine, namely ( de eo quod debeant eligi integerrimi: in that that they
which are most pure ought to be chosen. etc.) For else why does he add and
say, sancimus we have decreed: and not rather, they have decreed? But the
words that follow are most plain: quoties sacerdotalem sedem etc. as often as it
shall happen that the room of a Priest shall be void, the inhabitants of that
city shall give their voices of three. etc. for where did the Apostles ever
appoint, that three should stand in the election? or what example have you of
it in the whole scripture? so that you see here no one prescript rule or
example of the Apostles in all points followed, but that order to be taken, and
law made by the Emperor, which he thought for that state and time of the
Church to be most convenient.

In Nouellis he seems to declare what is meant by the inhabiters of that
city: for Constitution 123.
thus it is written: Sequentes igitur ea. etc. Following therefore those things
which are decreed in the holy Canons, we make this pragmaticall law, by the
which we decree, that as often as it shall be necessary to ordeyne a Bishop,
the Clergy and primates of the city, for the which the Bishop is to be
ordained, shall assemble together, and the Euangelies being laid before them,
shall agree and determine upon three persons: And every one of them shall
swear by the holy word of God (and that to be enrolled with their
determination) that they have not chosen these men, either for reward, or for
promise, or for friendship, or favor, or for any other affection, but only
because they know them to be of the true and catholic faith, and of honest
conversation, and that they are above five and thirty years old. So that it
is plain, that by the inhabitants of the city, he means the Clergy, and
the chief persons of the city. It follows in the same constitution: Vt ex
tribus illis personis, quae d^cretis hoc modo eliguntur, melior ordinetur,
electione and iudicio eius, qui ordinandi ius habet. That of those three which
are in this sort chosen, the best may be ordained, by the election and
judgment of him, that has the authority to ordeyne. And this last clause may
be an interpretation also of the meaning of that constitution, ex codice: that
is, that the inhabitants choose three, of whom the Metropolitan should choose
one to be Bishop: for it is evident that the Metropolitan had ius ordinandi,
and that law in codice, differs not one whit from this constitution.

The words of Carolus Magnus, make with me rather than against me, for in that
he says secundum statuta canonum de propria dioecesi: according to the
statutes of the Canons of that diocese; he plainly signifies that in sundry
diocese, there be sundry kinds and manners of elections, else would he have
said, secundum statuta canonum Apost. according to the statutes of the canons
of the Apostles, or sacrae scripturae, of the holy scripture, or such like. But
that which follows in the same law makes the matter manifest. Praecipimus
etiam omnibus. etc. we will also and command all those which are subject to
our jurisdiction, that no man attempt to spoil the privileges of the
Churches, Monasteries, or the Churches themselves. etc meaning no doubt
touching elections.

That of Ludouike did. 63. declares also that it was in the Emperoures power
to alter the manner of elections, or to establishe them: for else, to what
purpose were these laws and Confirmations made? All this verifyeth my
assertion, and proves plainly, that the manner and form of calling and
electing Ministers, is, and has been, in the power of the civil Magistrate
to order, as shall be most expedient for the present state of the Church: if
the Prince think it convenient that the people should have voices in such
elections, they may so have: if not, there is no law of God does bind them
to it: and that do all those laws of Emperors manifestly prove.

Chap. 6. the eight Division.
T. C. Page 36. Sect. 4. 5.
Platina also in the life of Pope Adrian the second, writes that Ludouike the
second by his letters An yntruth, for he only com mendeth them for so doing, he
does not command them to do ^o.
commanded the Romans that they should choose their own bishop, not loking
for other men's voices, which being strangers could not so well tell what was
done in the common weal where they were strangers, and that it apperteyneth to
the citizens.

The same Platina witnesses in the life of Pope Leo the. 8. that when the
people of Rome were earnest with the Emperor Otho the first, that he would
take away one Pope John yt lived very licentiously and riotously, and place an
other, the same Emperor answered, that it perteined to the clergy and people,
to choose one, and willed them that they should choose, and he would approve
it: and when they had chosen Leo, and after put him out without cause, and
chose one Pope Bennet, he compelled them to take Leo again. Whereby appears,
that in those estates where Magistrates were Christian, and where the estate
was most of all Monarchical, that is subject to ones gouernmente, and also
when the Church put out any without good cause, that then the Magistrates
should compel the Churches to do their duty. In deed the Bishop of Rome
gave the election then into the Emperou^ his hands, because of the lightness
of the people, as Platina makes mention, but that is not the matter, for I do
nothing else here but show that the elections of the ministers by the Church
were used in the times of the Emperors, and by their consentes. And seeing that
Otho confessed it perteyned not unto him, it is to be doubted, whether he
took it at the Bishop his hands.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have not truly reported the words of Platina in the first place, for he
says Platina falsified by. T. C
not that the Emperor Ludouike did command the Romans that they should
choose their own Bishop, but that he commended them for their godly and sound
choice. His words be these: Superuenere a Ludouico Imperatore literae, quibus
Romanos admodum laudat, quod summum Platina in vita Adriani. 2.
Pontificem sancte and integre creassent, There came letters from Ludouike the
Emperor, wherein he praises the Romans very much, because they had holily
and syncerely created the high Priest. etc. But Platina declares how
tumultuous an election that was, and how injuriously the Emperors Ambassadors
were secluded from the same, having therein interest: and although the Emperor
was content to put up that injury, and to commend that election (peradventure
for some worldly respect) yet it is manifest, that then the Bishops of Rome
began to usurp upon the authority of the Emperor, and to seclude him from
having any interest in their elections. M. Bale Bale.
speaking of this election says: Vi enim eligendi pontificis potestatem, ad se
tunc rapiebant Romani, For the Romans then took by force unto them selves
power to choose their Bishop.

The second place of Platina argues the vndiscretenesse of the people both in
placing and displacing their Bishop, and the authority of the Emperor in
taking this authority of placing and displacing from them, when they do abuse
it: for here he put out Benet whom they had chosen, and placed Leo whom they
had displaced, whereby it appears, that there was not then any one such
prescripte form of electing the Bishop of Rome, but that it was in the
authority of the Emperor, to abrogate, alter, or change it. All this is
nothing to the improuing of my assertion, for I deny not, but that the people
had interest in elections of Bishops, in diverse places, and especially in the
Church of Rome, a long time: But this does not prove, that there is any
prescript rule in Scripture, for the election of ministers which may not be
altered, and changed from time to time, as shall be most convenient for the
present state of the Church: nay whatsoever ye have hitherto said, proves
the contrary.

Platina does not write that Otho coufessed that the election of the Bishop of
(...) did not perteyne unto him: you should have a care to report the words of
the author truly: it is one thing to say, that the election of the Bishop
perteyneth to the Clergy and people, another thing to say, that it perteyned
not to him: for it might perteine to them al. And the same Platina in the life
of Io. 13. says, that after John was condemned by a council, and therefore
fled away, the Emperor Otho, at the request of the Clergy, did create Leo
Bishop of Rome: his words are these: Hanc ob causam Otho persuadente Platina in
(...) ta Joan* 13
clero, Leonem Romanum ciuem Lateranensis ecclesiae Scriniarium Pontificem
creat. For this cause Otho by the persuasion of the Clergy, chooses Leo a
Citizen of Rome, and keeper of the monuments of the Church of Laterane, to be
Bishop. He further in that place declares, how the people after the Emperors
departure deposed Leo, and placed Benet, and how the Emperor by force
compelled them to place Leo again.

That Otho the Emperor did take this grant at the Bishops hands, that the
election of the Bishop should be in him, and not in the people, M. Bale
testifyeth in manifest words, in the life of Leo. 8. where he says thus.
After, he took from the Clergy and people of Rome, the power of choosing
their Bishop, which Carolus Magnus had given Bale in vita Leon. 8.
unto them before, and by a Synodall decree did commit the same to Otho the
Emperor, for the avoiding of seditions which were wont to be in these
elections, and Otho receiving this grant thankfully, that he might show
himself again beneficial toward the Sea of Rome, restored all things which
Constantine is feyned to have given. etc. In the which words also it is to be
noted yt this liberty of choosing their Bishop, was granted unto the people
and Clergy of Rome by Carolus Magnus, the which not only M. Bale testifyeth
in this place, but M. Barnes also, in these words. Leo the. 8. understanding
the wickedness of the Romans in obtruding their friends to the Church, by
bribes, threatenings, and other wicked devises, did restore the interest of
choosing the Bishop to Otho the Emperor. Whereof I also conclude, that it is
in the power of the civil magistrate to take order for elections of ministers,
and that the consent of the people is not of any necessity required thereunto.

Chap. 6. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page. 36. Sect. 6.
And if the Emperors permitted the election of the Bishop to that City, where
it made most for their surety, to have one of their own appointment, as was
Rome, which with their Bishops did oftentimes put the good Emperoures to
trouble: it is to be thought, that in other places, both cities, and towns,
they did not deny the elections of ministers to the people, besides that,
certain of those constitutions are not of Rome, but of any city whatsoever.
And these Emperors were, and lived between. 500. and odd years, until the
very point of a thousand years after Christ, so that hitherto this liberty
was not gone out of ye Church, albeit the Pop^ which brought in all tyranny,
and went about to take all liberty from the Churches, was now on horse back,

In that the Emperors did but permit such elections to the people, it is
manifest, that the interest was in them, else why should they be said to have
permitted it. In deed true it is, that the Emperors so long did remitte of
their interest in such elections, that afterward when they would have claymed
their right therein, they could not obtain it, but by violence were shut from
all, as the histories manifestly deelare.

Hitherto you have proved nothing in question, neither have you reasoned ad i would

for you should either have proved that the election of ministers does of
necessity perteyne to the people, or that the same manner of electing is
conueniente for this Church of England in this time, and state: both which I
have improued, and do still utterly deny, neither does any thing that you
have alleged, prove either of them.

Therefore this diversity of the state of the Church requires a diue^s kind
of gouernmente, and another kind of ordeyning ministers. For this cause in
Concilio Laodicensi, which was Anno. 334. it was Council. Laodic.
decreed that the election of ministers should not be permitted to the people.

Those that write the Centuries This is untrue as shall appear.
suspect this canon, and doubt whether it be a bastard or no, considering the

voices of the Church, was An untruth, for I said not so.
but in the Apostles time, and during the time of persecution. And the first
time you can allege this liberty to be taken away, was in the. 334. year of
our Lord, which was at the least. 31. years after that Constantine the great
began to reygne. I say at the least, because there be good authors that say,
that this council of Laodicea was holde^ Anno. 338. after the death of
Ioninian the Emperor, and so there is. 35. years between the beginning of
Constantines reygne, and this council. Now I think you will not say, that the
Church was under The Church was under persecution in Constantines time by the
space of 13. years, for Maxentius and Licinius did then persecute.
persecution in Constantines time. And therefore you see you are greatly
deceived in your account.

Now if it be as lawful for us to use M. Caluins authority, which both by
example and writings has always defended our cause, as it is for you to wring
him and his words, to things which he never inent, and the contrary whereof he
continually practiced, then this authority of yours is dashed. For M. Calvin
says, whereas it is said in that council, that the election should not be
permitted to the people, it means nothing else but that they should make no
election, without having Upon the Acts. 16.
some ministers or men of judgment to direct them in their election, and to
gather their voices, and provide that nothing be done tumultuously, even as
Paul and Barnabas were chief in the election of the Churches: And even the
same order would we have kept in elections continually for avoiding of
confusion, for as we would have the liberty of the Church preserved, which
Christ has bought so dearly, from all tyranny: So do we again condemn and
utterly abhor the barbarous confusion and disorder.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where do those that write the Centuries suspecte that Canon? why note you not
the place? there is not one word tending to that end, in that place where they
speak of this Council. Neither as I think are you able to show any such
thing affirmed by them, and it is the first time that ever I either red or
heard it doubted, whether this were a Canon of that council or no. In the. 4.
Cent. col. 435. I find these words: variant ab ^ac consuetudine, mirum qua
veritate, constitutiones Concilij Laodiceni, quae ordinationes iudicio
multitudinis fieri probibuerunt. The constitutions of the Council of Laodicea,
which forbad Cent. 4.
the ordeyning (of ministers) to be done by the judgment of the multitude, do
vary from this custom (of electing by the people) it is marvel by what truth.
But no man can hereof gather that they doubt whether this Canon be a bastard or
no. Only they doubt whether this decree was made according to the truth. The
general Council at Constantinople, which is called Synodus. 6. did both allow
this council, and ratifye it.

It is not greatly material at what time this Council was holden: Neither
does it follow that because this decree was now made against such elections of
the people, therefore the people had before this time in all places interest, in
electing of ministers: for it may be that some claimed this interest, and moved
the people to contend for it then, as you do now: and therefore the Synod
might upon that occasion make this determination: as the like might be made at
this time in this Church of England, against such parishes as take upon them
the election of their Pastors, as you before affirmed Page. 3.
some to do: and yet we could not thereupon truly conclude, that before the
time of this prohibition the election of ministers was either generally, or
orderly committed to the people in this Church of England.

I have not in any place said that this order of choosing the minister by the
voices of the Church was but in the Apostles time, and during the time of
persecution, neither yet, that they could claim it of duty in either of these
times, or that it was then general, and in all places: for I have before
showed the contrary.

And where you think that I will not say the Church was under persecution in
Constantines The Church in persecution in Constantines time.
time (though it be not material) yet must I tell you that I think it was:
for eue^ then Maxentius and Licinius did persecute, and continued in
persecuting by the space of. 13. years after Constan. began his reygne: and it
is said of Licinius that he killed many thousands of Christians.

I have not at any time wrung M. Caluines words to any other sense, than he
himself has written them: if it be otherwise, make it knewne: for I have dealt
plainly and set down his words, so have not you. In his Institutions cap. 8.
Sect. 63. thus he writes of this Council: Est quidem and illud fateor. etc.
And surely I confess, that it was Calvin of the Council of Laodicea.
upon great reason decreed in the Council of Laodicea, that the election
should not be permitted to the multitude: for it scarcely at any time
happens that so many heads should with one consent determine any thing: And
that saying is almost true, that the unstable multitude is divided into
contrary factions. etc. Then does he tell what order was observed in elections:
first the Clergy only did choose, then did they offer him whom they had
chosen, to the magistrate, or to the Senate, and chief rulers, who after
deliberation, did confirm the election, if they liked of it: if not, then did
they choose another whom they thought to be more meet. In the end, the
matter was propounded to the multitude, rather to know their desire, and
require their testimony, than to give them any interest either of choosing or
refusing: this is the sum of Caluines meaning, and this he says, was the
meaning of that Council: which I say is in ^ffect, to take away the election
from the people.

Your note in the margent must be corrected, for Calvin has no such thing
upon the. 16. of the Acts: but the like he has upon the. 14. howbeit the words
of the Council be plain, quod non sit permittendum turbis electiones eorum
facere, qui sunt ad sacer dotium prouebendi: Council. Laodicen. Can. 13.
That it ought not to be permitted unto the multitude, to make elections of
them, which should be preferred to the ministry. And there can be no doubt of
the meaning of the Council, because it appears in the. 12. Canon that they
would have Bishops preferred to ecclesiastical dignity, by the judgment of
the Metropolitan and other Can. 12.
Bishops.

Liberty and tyranny be too common in your mouth. It is no tyranny to
restrain the people from that liberty that is hurtful to themselves, and
must of necessity engender contentions, tumults, and confusion.

But if Councels be of so great authority to decide this controversy, the^
the most famous Council of Nice will strike a great stroke with you, which in
an Epistl that it writes unto the Church of Egypt (as Theodoret makes
mention) speaks thus. It is meet that This is (...) of the Clearg^, not of
the people.
you should have power both to choose any man, and to give their names which
are worthy to be amongst the Clergy, and to do all things absolutely according
to the law and decrees of the Church, and if it happen any to dye in the
Church, then that those which were last taken to be promoted to the honor of
him that is dead, with this condition, if they be worthy, and the people choose
them, the Bishop of the city of Alexandria together giving his consent and
appoynting him.

The Council in that epistle, first declares what was done with Arius: then
what became of Melitius, how he was deposed from his Bishoprike, and yet
suffered to remain in his own city, but to have no authority of choosing or
ordeyning ministers either in the province, or in any other city. After it
shows that such as were ordained and made ministers, or promoted by him,
should keep their ministry and honor, but not have any authority in
elections, or in preferring of any to any degree The. li. ^. cap. 9.
of ministry, whereupon it by and by follows, qui vero Dei gratia. etc. but
those that by the grace of God and your prayers, have not bin factious and
scismaticall, but kept themselves undefiled in the Catholic and Apostolic
Church, it is meet that they should have authority and power, both to choose
any man, and to give their names which are worthy to be of the Clergy: And to
do all things according to the laws and decrees of the Church. Their meaning
is evident, that such only of the Clergy should have to do in electing or
preferring any to the ministry, which have not bin schismatic and
factious in the time of heresy: for these words of the Council are not spoken
of the people, but of the Clergy, as the circumstance of the place does
declare: which thing Iacobus Grinaeus notes in the marge^t, in these words:
Iura Clericorum qui ortbodoxi manserunt. That which follows and if it happen
any to dye in the Church. etc. does argue that the people had a consent in
those Churches, according to the orders whereof the Council would have them to
proceed: but it makes no new law for it, neither does it decree any thing as
concerning it. And it is evident that their order herein was not general, but
particular to those Churches: for it follows after in the same epistle, This
order was peculiar to Egypt and Alexandria.
Haec proprie and peculiariter ad Aegyptum, atque sanctissimam Alexandrinam
ecclesiam pertinent. So that it is manifest that the meaning of the Council was
not to bind all Churches to this order. But all this labor of yours is lost,
for you go about to prove that which no man denies.

Another of the famousest councels, called the Council of Constantinople, which
was gathered under Theodosius ye great (as it is witnessed by the Tripartite
story) in an epistle which it wrote Lib. 9. cap. 19.
to Damasus the Pope, and Ambrose and others, says thus: we have ordained
Nectarius the Bishop of Constantinople with the whole consent of the Council,
in the sight of the Emperor Theodosius beloved of God, the whole city
together decreeing the same. Likewise he says that Flanian was appointed by
that Synod bishop of Antioch, the whole people appoynting him.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words in that epistle both as the Tripartite histo. and as Theodoret
himself reports them lib. 5. cap. 9. signify, that the whole city was well
pleased, that Nectarius was chosen to be their Bishop, and consented unto it:
But it does not therefore follow that the whole city did choose him. In
Theodoret I find these words. Reuerendissimum The. li. 5. cap. 9
and dei amantissimu^ Nectarium episcopu^ praeposuimus in generali nostro
Co^^ilio, and praesente amantissimo dei Imperatore Theodosio, cum omnium
clericorum, ac totius ciuitatis approbatione. We have placed or ordained the
most reverend, and loving Nectarius, in our general Council, both Theodosius
(the Emperor most beloved of God) being present, and also with the
approbation of all the Clergy and the whole city.

They say we have placed or ordained Nectarius. etc. and they which say so
were Bishops. Moreover Theodoret in the chapter that goes before, says
plainly that the Pastors and ministers did choose him Bishop. But be it that
the whole city did give their voices: that is no proof, that at all times it
must of necessity be so.

The same answer I make to your example of Flauianus.

Likewise in the council of Carthage where Augustine was, holden about Anno
Domin^. Needelesse proo fes.
400. in the first Canon of the Council it is said, when he has bin examined
in all these, and found fully instructed, then let him be ordained Bishop by
the common consent of the Clearks, and the lay people and the Bishops of the
province, and especially either by the authority, or presence of the
Metropolitan.

And in the Toletane council, as it appears in the. 51. distinction, it was
thus ordained. Let not him be counted a Priest of the Church (for so they
speak) whom neither the Clergy nor people of that city where he is a
Priest, does choose, nor the consent of the Metropolitan and other Priests in
that province had sought after.

Moreover Concilium Gabilonense which was holden Anno domini. 650. in the
tenth Canon has this. If any Bishop after the death of his predecessor be
chosen of any but of the Bishops in the same province* and of the Clergy and
citizens, let another be chosen, and if it be otherwise let that ordinatio^ be
accounted of none effect. Al which Councels prove manifestly, that as the
people in their elections had the ministers round about, or Synods and councels
directing them, so there was none came to be over the people, but by their
voices and consents.

Io. Whitgifte.
This which is affirmed of these Councels, is confessed to be true, but not to
the purpose: for the question is not whether the peoples consent were required
at any time or no, but whether it must be required at all times.

This alteration of government and orders in the Church of Christ is well set
out by Ambrose in the. 4. to the Ephe. upon these words, Et ipse dedit. etc.
where he says on this sort, that the number of Christians Ambrose.
might increase and be multiplied, in the beginning it was permitted to every
one to preach the gospel, to baptize, and to expound the scriptures, but when
the Church was enlarged there were certain parishes appointed, and
gouernoures and other officers ordained in the Church. etc. Therefore the
vvritings of the Apostles do not in all things agree with the orders that are
now in the Church. Thus far Ambrose.

T. C. Page 38. Sect. 1.
Indeed if you put such dark colors upon the Apostles Church as this is, it
is no marvel if it ought not to be a patron to us of framing and fashioning
our Church after it. But O Lord who can patiently hear this horrible
disorder, ascribed to the Apostles Church, which here you attribute unto it,
that every one hand over head preached, baptized, and expounded the scriptures,
what a window, nay, what a gate is opened here to The Anabaptists glory of the
same calling that you c(...) for.
Anabaptists, to confirm their fantastical opinion, wherein they hold that
every man whom the spirit moves may come, even from the plough tail, to the
pulpit, to preach the word of God. If you say it is Ambrose saying and not
yours, I answer, unless you allow it why bring you it, and that to prove the
difference between the Apostles times and these? For if it be false (as it is
most false) then there is no difference here between the Apostles times and
ours. Does not the whole course of the scriptures declare, and has it not bin
proved, that there was none that took upon him the ministry in the church,
but by lawful calling? what is this but to cast dust and dirt of the fairest
and beautifullest image that ever was, to make a smokie, disfigured, evil
proportioned image to seem beautiful, to overthrow the Apostles buildings of
gold and silver, and precious stones, to make a cotage of wood, straw, and
stubble, to have some estimation, which could have none the other standing. For
in effect so you do, when to uphold a corrupt use that came in by the tyranny
of the Pope, you go about to discredit the orders and institutions which were
used in the Apostles times, and that with such manifest untruths.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a very slender answer to Ambrose, whose authority both for his
excellent Ambrose unworthily r(...)ted. by T. C.
learning, and virtue, and also for his antiquity, is not to be so
contemptuously rejected. The selfsame word and to the same effect does
Georgius mayor in his commentaries upon the first to the Philip. recite out of
one Rabanus Bishop of Moguntia, who also borrowed them as it should seem, of
Ambrose. Mayor allows well of them, and makes no such exclamations as you
do, and yet a man known to be learned, and sound in religion, as his works
declare. Likewise the authors of the Centuries. 4. Cent. cap. 7. allege this
same place of Ambrose, and allow of it: and therefore the matter is not so
heinous as you make it. Anabaptists pretend a kind of calling by the people.


The Anabaptists glory of the same calling that you now contend for, as it
appears in the. 3. book of M. Bullinger aduer. Anabap. cap. 4. whose words
be these, suam vero vocationem etc. They affirm that their calling is just,
because they be called and sent of their (...).
Churches: but our vocation to be unlawful, which is made of the magistrate,
and therefore, that they are sent of God, but we of the world and of men. You
know that this was one of the first things that the rusti^all Anabaptists moved
sedition for, and that they required it of the magistrates, as Sleydan
declares li. 5. ex his postulatis, says he, primu^ erat, vt (...).
ipsis liceret ecclesiae ministros eligere, qui verbum dei pure doceant: Of
those requests, the first was, that they might choose ministers of the Church,
which might teach the word of God purely. You see therefore that the
Anabaptists many of them, require a vocation, and one not much unlike that
which you strive for in this place, and at this time. When Ambrose says that
it was permitted to every man to preach the Gospel. etc. he does not say that
it was permitted unto them without some kind of calling: if you will vewe the
place well, and consider it at large, as it is in Ambrose, your heat will be
something quenched I doubt not.

It is no derogation at all from the Apostolical Church, to have the orders of
it in diverse points altered: for though such were most conueniente then for
that state, time, and persons, yet are they not so now in respect of this
state, time, and persons, so that the form of the Apostolical Churches was
then perfyte, and absolute, though now it admit (in the respect of diverse
circumstances) alteration.

Musculus also in his common places answering to this question, Musculus.
why that ministers of the word are not chosen now by the ministers and the
people, as they were in the primitive Church, but appointed by the Magistrate,
says thus: talis tum ecclesiarum erat status, vt aliter no^ essent eligendi
ministri, quia Christiano magistratu destituebantur. Si reuocas temporum
illorum mores, primum conditiones and statum quoque illorum reuoca. Such was
then the state of Churches, that they could choose their ministers no
otherwise, because they had no Christian Magistrates. If thou would have
the manners and customs of those times observed, then must thou call back
their conditions and state.

T. C. Page. 38. Sect. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. vlt. and. Sect 39. Sect. 1 2.
The place is to common which you assign, you had I am sure the book before
you: you might have told where the place was, and in what title. But that
place of Musculus in the title of the magistrate, is answered by himsel^e in
the same book, where he entreats of the election of the ministers. For going
about (as it seems) to satisfy some of their ministers, which were brought
in do^bt of their calling, because they were not chosen by their Churches,
speaking of the use of the Church in choosing their minister he says thus.

First it must be plainly confessed, that the ministers were in times past
chosen by consent of the people, and or^eyned and confirmed of the seignioures.

Secondarily that that form of election was Apostolical and lawful.

Thirdly, that it was conformable to the liberty of the Church, and that
thrusting the Pastor upon the Church, not being chosen of it, does agree to a
Church that is not free, but subject to bond^ge.

Fourthly, that this form of choice by the Church makes much both to that
that the minister may govern his slocke with a good conscience, as also that
the people may yield themselves to be easlier ruled, than when one comes
against their wills unto them.

And to conclude all these, he says that they are altogyther certain, and
such as cannot be denied. After he says that the corrupt estate of the Church
and religion drives to alter this order, and to call the election to certain
learned men, which should after be confirmed of the Prince. And that it may yet
more clearly appear that his judgment is nothing less than to confirm this
election, he sets down their election in Bernland, which he approves and
labors to make good as one which although it does not fully agree with the
election of the primitive Church, yet comes very near unto it: As that not
one man, but all the ministers in the city of Berue do choose a Pastor when
there is any place void.

Afterward he is sent to the Senate, from the which, if he be doubted of, he is
sent again to the ministers, to be examined, and then if they find him meet,
he is confirmed of the Senate (which stands of some number of the people)
and by the most part of their voices. By these things it appears, that this
election of the Minister, by the people, is lawful and Apost^like, and
confe^sed also by him, that those that are otherwise, bring with them
subjection unto the Church, and servitude, and carya note and mark of
corruption of Religion.

Last of all that he go^h about to defend the election used in the Churches
where he was Minister by this, that it approached unto the election in the
primitive Church. Now what cause there may be, that we should bring the
Church into bondage, or take away the order whereby both the Minister may
be better assured of his calling, and the people may the willyngiyer submit
them selves unto their pastors and governors, or what cause to depart from
the Apostolyke form, of the choice of the Pastor being lawful, I confess I
know not, and would be glad to learn.

To assign the cause hereof unto the Christian Magistrate, and to say, that
these things can not be had under him (as you under Master Musculus name do
affirm) is ^o do great injury unto the office of the Magistrate, which
abridgeth not the liberty of the Church but defends it, diminishes not the
Pastor his assurance of his calling, but rather increases it, by establishyng
the ordinary callyngs only, which in the time of perse^ution some times are
not so ordinary, withdraws not the obedience of the people from the Pastor,
bu^ urges it where it is not, and constrayneth it where it is not voluntary?
And seeing that also Musculu^ (...) ning (...)
Musculus says, that these forced elections are remedies for corruption of
Religion, and disordered states, what greater dishonor can there be done unto
the holy institution of God in the civil governor, than to say that these
forced elections without the consent of the people, must be where there is a
Christian Magistrate: as though there could be no pure Religion under him,
when as in deed it may be easily under him pure, which can hardly, and with
great danger be pure without him. And when as it is said, that the Churches
consent should be had in the election of the Minister, Here you ar^ ^one
(...) from your Apostolica^ form.
we do not deny the confirmation of the elections unto the godly civil
Magistrate and the disanulling of them, if the Church in choosing, and the
Ministers in directing, shall take any unfit man, so that yet, he do not
take away the liberty from the Church, of choosing a more convenient man.

So that you see, that by Musculus your witness reasons, this enforced
election without the consent of the people, is but corrupt, and so ought
not to be in the Church. And that although it has been borne withal, yet it
must be spoken against, and the lawful form of election labored for, of all
those that love the truth, and the sincerity thereof.

the centuries should be seen. etc. and yet you neither tell us in what part
of Justinians Code, in what book of Chap. of Theodoret, in what counsel of
Cartharge, or of Toledo, in what tome of Augustine, or part of Gratia^, in what
centurie, or book of centuries, which all require much more time to search
out, than this of Musculus, and especially your law, which (for any thing that
I can perceive) asks so long a search in codice Iustiniani, that I think it
will never be found there. But it is no great marvel for you report them as
the Author does of whom you borowe them, without any further search or trial.
But to put you out of doubt, this place of Musculus is titulo de Magistratibus.

Musculus in deed confesses that in the Apostles time, ministers were choosen
by the people, and ordained and confirmed by the elders. And after that he has
showed this manner of election to have been used t^ Cyprians time, he adds
and says: Ad hunc itaque Tit. de ve^b* ministris.
modum eligebantur. etc. After this manner in times paste were Ministers,
Bishops, and Deacons elected: the which form also of electing, Churches
retained unto the time of Christian Princes and Magistrates, whose consent was
required in the election of Bishops, and that worthily, for it is not meet
that those things which are to be done publicly, and concern the people
which be their subjects, and perteine unto them in respect of Religion
(except we will say with the Anabap. that Christians ought not to be
Magistrates) should be done without their consent.

After this, he declares how the Bishop of Rome in the end, spoiled the
Magistrate and the people also of this liberty: and when he has spoken
against the abuses of the Roman Church in that matter, he makes an objection
of such Churches as profess the Gospel, saying, but some peradventure will
object that those Churches which in our time will seem to have reformed
Religion receive their ministers of the Magistrate, and not by any election of
the people: to this objection he says that he is compelled to answer for
their sakes: who though they faithfully labor in the word of the Lord, yet do
they doubt whether their vocation be lawful or no, because they were not
elected and ordained according to the Apostolical form: And having confessed
those points yt you here set down, he makes this resolution. Veru^ si
consideres diuersu^ ecclesiae statu^. etc. If thou shall consider the diverse
state of the Church, thou must confess, that that which in it self is
Apostolical, lawful, and usual, and convenient for the liberty of the
Churches, primis quide^ ecclesiae te^poribus prodesse potuisse, nostris vero
non ita: might well profit the Church in the beginning, but not so in our time.
For the^ there was not such a multitude of Christians, but that the minister
without tumult, might by common consent be chosen, which thing at this day were
very hard to be done. Moreover the^ the minds of the faithful were not so
generally infected with common errors, nor so blinded with false worshippings,
but they remained as yet in the doctrine and Religion which they had received
of the Apostles: wherefore it might well be, that a true minister might be
chosen by their common suffrages. But after that the number of Christians was
increased to an infinite multitude, and first schisms, then general
ignorance, blindness, and sundry kinds of superstition invaded the Church,
etc. there could no longer any true and sincere minister be elected by the
general consent of the people etc. wherefore for the condition of the time,
necessity it self required, that Princes and Magistrates should commit this
matter to certain wise me^ careful for the Church, by whose means meet
pastors might be placed, etc. then he adds: that for the circumstances of
time, as in all Churches the Apostolical form of electing and ordeining
cannot be restored* so is there no cause, why the minister of Christ, being
called to preach the Gospel by a godly Prince, and Magistrate, should doubt of
his calling, whether it be right and Christian or no. But he must remember that
where the state of the Church, and of Religion is corrupt, another way must be
found out to remedy the same, than that which was used in the Churches, when
all things was safe and sound. In the end he declares what manner of electing
and ordeining Ministers is used in ye church of Berne. Neither does he in that
place or any other that I know, go about to defend the election used in the
Church where he was Minister, by this, that it approached unto the election of
the Primitive Church, as you report him to do. Thus have I truly reported
Musculus his words in that place, and his order: than the which what can be
more directly spoken to my purpose? which is to prove that no one certain
manner and form of electing Ministers, is anywhere appointed to be general,
and perpetual, but that the same may be altered according to place, time, and
persons: and that the manner used in the Apostles time, is not meet and
convenient for this time. All this I say Musculus has plainly, and by good
reasons here proved, which he does also as manifestly confirm in the title
de Magistratibus. For after that he has declared that it pertains to the
Magistrate to appoint Church Ministers, he says dices: at secus factum est in
primis ecclesijs, in quibus a ministris and plebe eligebantur ecclesiarum
antistites, respondeo, talis tum ecclesiarum erat status. etc. as it is in my
answer.

For the subjection and bondage of the Church which you so often talk of, this
is my answer in few words: that subjection to lawful Magistrates in matters
lawful, is no bondage to any, but to such as think dutiful obedience to be
servitude and bondage, as the Anabaptists do. Why the people are debarred from
electing (which you call the Apostolical form of the choice of the Pastor)
you may learn by that which has been hitherto spoken, if you be so desirous
to learn, as you would seem to be.

That the minister may be well assured of the lawfulness of his calling,
though The minister may be assured of his calling though he be not chosen by
the people.
he be not called of the people, you have also heard of Musculus, who of
purpose answers that doubt. He that is sure of an inward calling need not
to doubt of his outward calling, if it be according to the manner and form of
that Church wherein he is called.

That the people do as willingly now submit them selves to their Pastors and
governors, (though they have no interest in electing of them) as they did
then, experience teaches in all places, where there be good and virtuous
pastors, except only in such as you and yours have set on fire with contention
and contempt. You say to assign the cause hereof to the Christian
Magistrate. etc. We give unto the Magistrate that which of duty belongs
unto him in the respect that he is a Christian Magistrate, and has the chief
government of the Church in all causes, and over all persons: and you desirous
of popularitie, withdraw from the Magistrate that which is due unto him, giving
the same to the people, and vulgar sort.

You count it an abridging of the liberty of the Church, a diminishing of the
pastors assurance of his calling, a withdrawing of the people from the pastor,
to be short, a brynging of the people into bondage, for the Magistrate to
maintain his right in using that kind of appointing Ministers, which he
thinks to be most profitable for the Church committed unto him: and is not
this to do great injury to the office of the Magistrate? Why do you not
plainly say that the Queens Majesty abridgeth the liberty of the Church,
diminishes the pastors assurance of his calling, withdraws the people from
their pastor, urges and constrains them to that which is voluntary, and
brings them into bondage, because she will not suffer them to have fredome in
the elections of their Bishops, and Pastors? for this is your plain meaning.
But temper your popular and undutiful speeches: the true The true liberty of
the Church.
liberty of the Church, which is liberty of conscience, and fredome from
false doctrine, errors and superstitions, and not license for every man to do
what himself liweth, was never more in any Church: pastors never had better
cause to be assured of their calling: the people at no time more bound to
cleave to their pastors: never less cause to complain of urging constraint,
servitude, or bondage, than they have at this day under her Majesty: but you
go about to persuade them to the contrary, which where unto it tends, would
be in time considered.

Musculus says, that this manner of ordering Ministers (for he does not call
it T. C. transfei reth yt corruptions of men's minds, to the government.
forced elections) is a remedy against corrupted states, not in respect of
laws, government, Magistrate, or Religion by authority established, but of
menues minds that are corrupted with errors, contentions, and sinister
affections, and this is no dishonor to the civil governor. For if in a
kingdom there be many wayward and disordered persons, the fault is in
themselves, and not in the Magistrate, nor in the kind of government, but a
great commendation rather, when as by the diligence of the Magistrate, and
profitable kind of government, such disordered persons be corrected and
reformed, or at the least kept under and restrained. Is it a dishonor to the
Prince, that where as she found the whole Realm corrupted in doctrine, now it
is otherwise, though not in the hearts of many, yet in external form, and
public regiment? Wherefore you do but subtly, (I will not say
contemptuously) transfer that to the Magistrate and kind of government, which
Musculus means of the corrupt minds and affections of the common sort of men.

You add that when it is said, that the Churches consent should be had in the
election of T. C. urges the Apostolical form, and yet brings in that which
is not Apostolical.
the minister. etc. but how shall we know that you mean as you speak? for you
have no warrant so to do in any Apostolical election, or in any form used in
the Apostles time. Wherefore either you must break that rule which you would
have both to be perfect, and perpetual for all times, and states, or else do
you but dissemble with the Magistrate, and mind nothing less than that you
say you would do.

But as good never a whit, as never a deal the better: for the Magistrate
must The absurdities of the devise of T. C.
confyrme them, or reiecte them, if he be godly, and take not from the Church
her liberty in choosyng. First, what if the Magistrate be ungodly? or who
shall judge whether he be so or no? or how shall the Magistrate know when the
Church in choosing, and the Ministers in directing shall take any unfit man?
who shall complain to the Prince of his unfitness, if both the Ministers and
people think him fit? or who shall judge of his fitness? or what privilege
shall the Magistrate have hereby, when he must have one of the peoples electing
whether he will or no, or else must the Church the distitute? Surely the
Magistrate should have a good office, to be so troubled with such elections in
this Church of England. In good sadness tell me, do you not see the
absurdities of these your fond and troublesome devises? or are you so blind,
that you perceive not how far you would swerve from the form, which you say
was used by the Apostles, when you give to the civil Magistrate the
confirmation of ministers, which they in their time kept to themselves?

Musculus has in most plain manner taught the self same thing, that I have
done, as it may appear to all those that will understand: but you of purpose
would blind both your self and others.

That Bishops have authority to admit and ordeyne Ministers.
Chap. 7. the first Division.
Admonition.
Now that authority is given into the hands of the Bishop alone, who by his
sole authority thrusts upon them such, as they many times, as well for
dishonest life, as also for lack of learning, may, and do justly dislike.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 46. Sect. 1.
That Bishops have authority to admit Ministers (which is here denied) it
is plain by that which is written. 1. Tim. 5. manus cito ne cui imponas, Lay
thy hands rashely on none. These words Ambrose, Chrysostom, and all learned
writers, for the most part, do say to be an Admonition to Timothy, that he
ought to be circumspecte in appoynting of Ministers. And to Titus chap. 1.
Paul says that he left him at Creta, vt constituat oppidatim presbyteros,
that he should appoint Ministers in every town. This Hierome and others do
expound of the authority that Titus had in placing ministers in every Church.

T. C. Page 39. Sect. 3. 4. and Page 40. Sect. 1. 2.
Now you would prove A wilful de prauing of the Answer.
that this election of Ministers by one man was in the Apostles time. But you
have forgotten your self, which said a little before, that this election by
the Church, was not only in the Apostles times, but also in the time of
Cyprian: now you say otherwise. And if the election of the minister by the
Church agree so well with the time of persecution, and when there is no
christian Magistrate, how comes it to pass, that in those days when
persecution was so hot, and there were no such Magistrates, that Saint Paul
would have the election by one man, and not by the Church. Besides that, if
Who has said so ^
this be Saint Paul his commandment, that the Bishop should only choose
the Minister, why do you make it an indifferent thing, and a thing in the
power of the Church to be varyed by times, for this is a flat commandment.
Thus you see you throw down with one hand, as fast as you build with the
other. But to answer directly to the place of the fifth of the first to
Timothy.

I say first, that Saint Paul writes to Timothy, and therefore instructs
him what he should do for his part in the appoynting of the Minister. If he
had written to the whole church of Ephesus, he would likewise have instructed
them how they should have behaved themselves in that business. If one do
write unto his friend, that has interest in any election, to take heed that
he choose none but such as are meet, shall any man conclude thereupon, that
none has to do in that election, but he to whom that letter is written?
Then I say further that Saint Paul attributes that unto Timothy, that was
common to more with him, because he being the director and moderator of the
election is said to do that which many do: which thing I have proved by
diverse examples both out of the Scripture, and otherwise before. And even in
this imposition of hands, it is manifestly to be showed. For that whereas
Saint Paul 2. Tim. 1.
says in the second Epistle that Timothy was ordained by the putting on of
his hands upon him, in the first Epistle he says, that he was ordained by
the putting on of the hands of the 1. Tim. 4.
eldership. So that that which he in one place takes to him self alone, in
the other he communicates with more. Again, it is a fault in you, that you can
not distinguishe or put difference between the election, and imposition of
hands.

Last of all I answer that although this might agree to Timothy alone, as
in deed it can not, yet it follows not that every Bishop may do so. For
Timothy was an Evangelist, which was above a Bishop, as hereafter shall better
appear. And it is an evil argument to say the greater may do it therefore
the less may do it. The superior, therefore the inferior. If you were at
any cost with producing your witnesses, you should not be so wise to be so
lauishe of them, as to cite Ambrose and Chrysostom, to prove a thing that none
has ever denied for who denies that Saint Paul does not give warnyng to
Timothy to be circumspecte? if you mean to use their testimony to prove that
he only made the elections, they say never a word for you, if there be any
thing, cite it. To the place of Titus, I answer as to that of Timothy, for
there is nothing there, but agrees also to this place. And as for Hierome, he
has nothing in that place, as he has in no other, to As if there were any
(...) thing affirmed.
prove that to the Bishop only does belong the right of the election of the
Minister.

I have showed you reasons before, why it can not be so taken of the sole
election of the Bishop, the Church being shut out. If authorite would do any
good in this behalf, as it seems it ought, seeing that all your proof
throughout the whole book, is in the authorities of men, (which Aristotle
calls (...), uncunning proofs) I could send you to M. Calvin which
teaches, that it is not to be thought that S. Paul would permit to Titus to
ordeiue Bishops and ministers by his own authority, when he himself would
not take so much upon him, but joined his with the voices of the Church. But he
peradventure sauoureth not your ^ast, and yet you would make men believe
sometimes, that you make much of him, if you can get but one word An untrue
accusation.
unjointed, and racked in pieces from the rest, to make good your part. If he
weigh not with you, you have M. Musculus, whom you take to be a great patron
of yours in this cause, Musculus in his com. pla. in his title of the election
of ministers
which does with greater vehemency affirm the same thing that M. Calvin
says, asking whether any man can believe that Paul permitted in this place to
Titus, or in the place before alleged to Timothy, that they should ordeine of
their own authority, and by themselves, when as Paul would not do it but by
the voices and election of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Admonition in the sixth article colorably, but in the. 7. plainly
affirms, that Bishops may admit ministers.
the right of ordering ministers does at no hand apperteine to the Bishop:
this do I improve in this place, and prove that the right of ordering and
electing Ministers, does apperteine to the Bishop: but I have contented my
self with the fewer proofs, because their assertion is so absurd, that it
can not but discredit their learning with all learned men. And what so ever T.
C. has hitherto said, manifestly declares it to be untrue: yet now it is his
pleasure to gloss upon my words, and to say that I would prove this election
of Ministers by one man, to have bin in the Apostles time. etc. Whereas in
deed my words be plain, and my meaning is to prove that the electing and
ordering of ministers does apperteine to Bishops: I do not say only to Bishops.

When you say that the election of the Pastor does apperteine to the people,
do you mean that it only pertains to the people? But because you think yt
to be so great a matter, to say that in the Apostles time the election of
Ministers was by one man, seeing that I have said before that this election by
the Church was in the Apostles time and after, I will say now more than I said
before, that they be both true: that is, that in the Diverse kinds of ordeining
and electing ministers in the Apostles time.
Apostles time there was diverse manners of ordeining and electing Ministers.
For some time one alone did choose, and ordeine, sometimes many, sometimes
Ministers only, and sometime the people also: as it may evidently be gathered,
both by that which is spoken before, and by this also that I do say in this
place. Zuinglius in his book called Ecclesiastes says thus, We read in old
time of three kinds of elections: some Zuinglius.
were chosen by the common and general consent of all the faithful gathered
together in one place: Other some were elected and sent by the Apostles only:
Other some we may find, whom one only Apostle did choose and send, as Titus
whom Paul left at Creta, committing unto him, the care of that Church. The
like says M. Bullinger Lib. 3. aduersus Bullinger.
Anabap. cap. 4. there is another calling of those, which are also called of
God, but by men, which choose and send according to gods ordinance, as when
Peter sent Mark, and Paul^ both called and sent Timothy, Titus and Luke. Thus
you see that it is counted no strange matter to have diverse kinds of calling
and electing ministers, even in the Apostles time. And therefore in saying now,
that Bishops have authority to admit ministers, I say nothing contrary to any
thing that I have said before, neither yet if I affirm that Timothy and
Titus had this authority to themselves alone.

The election of the Minister by the Church is fittest for the time of
persecution: but that does not seclude from the same time, election and calling
by one man: neither is this the question, whether choosing by the common
consent of the people, or calling and sending by one man, be meetest for ye
time of persecution: but whether election made by the multitude, is fitter for
the time of persecution, and when there is no christian Magistrate, than for
the time of prosperity, and under a Christian Magistrate: and therefore you
do but incumber the Reader with false suppositions. Elections by the
multitude, or by one only, may be used in the time of persecution, and at
other times also, as shall be most expedient for the Church.

Where do I say, that it is Paul's commandment that the Bishop should
only T. C. peruerteth the saying of the Answerer.
choose the Minister? undoubtedly this is no true or divine dealing, wyllingly
and wittingly to pervert a man's saying, neither can it come of a good
conscience, and you have faulted in it very often. I prove by that which S. Paul
said to Timothy 1. Ti 5. (Lay thy hands rashely on none) that a Bishop has
authority to admit 1. Tim. 5.
Ministers, because Timothy to whom these words were spoken, was a Bishop: and
learned interpreters do say, that Saint Paul by these words did admonish
Timothy, that he ought to be circumspect in appointing of ministers: Therefore
this is not Paul's commandment, that a Bishop only should ordeine
ministers, but this he gives in charge to all Bishops, in the name of
Timothy, that they lay their hands rashely on none: whereby also he plainly
signifies that the ordering and electing of Ministers does apperteine unto
them, which is denied by the Admonition. Here is then nothing thrown down
that was before builded, but you cast snow balls at ye windows of the
building, which may for a time darken them, till your snow be melte away with
the Sun.

Touching your direct answer, (as you call it) to the place. 1. Tim. 5. thus I
briefly reply, that it is but devised of your own head, not grounded upon
any good authority, nor consonant to the circumstance of the place, or course
of the Epistle. Both Ambrose and Chrysostom and other learned writers (as I
have said) do understand it to be meant of the authority that Timothy had in
ordering Bishops and ministers. The whole Epistle, and the circumstance of this
place do plainly testify, that this was spoken to Timothy, only in the
respect that he was a Bishop. The precepts that be contained in this Epistle,
the most of them, and in this Chapter especially, are such as properly
perteyne to Timothy in the respect that he was a Bishop, and a Minister of
the word. To conclude, if the election of a Bishop had of necessity perteyned
to the people, Paul would not have written in this manner to Timothy as he
has done, describing unto him what qualities he that is to be elected Bishop
ought to have, but he would rather have written the same to the people, or
willed Timothy to declare it unto them. Neither does he any where in any of
his Epistles write to any Church, to give them any instructions in this so
necessary a matter: but only writes of the same in those Epistles to
Timothy and Titus being Bishops, which may be an argument that the ordering
of Ministers does properly apperteyne to a Bishop, and that this also, manus
cito. etc. is spoken to Timothy in that respect.

A man mave write to his friend that has interest in an election, but Paul
does not only write unto Timothy as to one that has interest, but as to one
in whom the whole interest consists. When you say that Paul attributes that
to Timothy, that was common to him with more, if you mean more Bishops, then it
is true, for it is a rule for all Bishops to follow: but if you mean other of
the people, then do you but shifte of the matter with ghessing.

To your proofs of that phrase and kind of speech I have answered before, it
is but a starting hole to fly unto, when you are foiled by the plain and
evident words of the Scripture. That which is by you alleged. 2. Ti. 1. and
1. Ti. 4. makes for my purpose: for you have before confessed, that imposition
of hands was not by Fol. 31. Sect. 4.
the Church and people, but by the Elders and Ministers: and you allege these
places 1. Timo. 4. and 2. Timo. 1. to prove the same. And therefore I much
marvel to what end you now allege them, except it be to prove your phrase,
for they cannot prove any election made by the people, unless you will say
and unsay at your pleasure.

But to put you out of doubt, imponere manus, to lay on hands, sometimes
signifies the To lay on hands, is diversely taken. Bullinger.
ceremony only of laying on of hands, and sometimes the whole manner and form
of ordering. And in this second signification it is taken. 1. Ti. 5. and. 2.
Ti. 1. Bull. expoundyng this place. 1. Ti. 5. says, manus enim imponere aliud
non est, qua^ ecclesiae alique^ praeficere and ordinare, To lay on hands is
nothing else, but to ordeine and appoint one over the Church. And interpreting
yt also. 2. Ti. 1. he says: Paulus in praesenti per donu^ dei, prophetiae
donu^ intellexit and functione^ Episcopale^ ad quam vocarat Timotheu^ dominus,
sed per ministeriu^ Pauli, qui ideo nunc* dicit donum illud in Timotheo esse
per impositionem manuum suarum: Paul does here understand by the gift of
God, the gift of Prophecy, and the office of a Bishop, unto the which the
Lord had called Timothy, but by the ministry of Paul, who for that cause
now says, that that gift was in Timothy by the imposition of his hands. And
M. Calvin Institu. Cap. 8. Sect. 50. decideth this matter fully in these
words: Sed Paulus ipse alibi se Calvin.
etc. But Paul himself in another place, does testify that he, and no more,
did lay his hands upon Timothy: I admonish thee (says he) that thou stir
up the grace which is in thee, by the imposition of my hands. For where it is
said in the other Epistle of the laying on of the hands of the eldership, I
do not so take it, as though Paul spoke of the College of Elders: but in
this name ( videlicet presbyterij) I understand the ordination it self: as if
he should say, endeavor thy self that the grace be not in vain, which thou
have received by the laying on of hands, when I ordained thee a minister.
Again upon this. 1. Tim. 5. he says thus: Impositio manuum ordinationem
significat, signum enim pro re ipsa capitur, The imposition of hands
signifies the ordering, for the sign is taken for the thing it self. For
what is it to appoint, but to call, elect, and ordeyne? Moreover that which
Paul says to Titus, Vt constituas. etc. does expound this to Timothy,
manus cito. etc. and therefore in deed I make no difference in this place,
betwixt election, ordeyning, and imposition of hands.

Last of all (you say) that you answer, though this might agree to Timothy
alone. etc. If it agreed to Timothy alone, it must needs follow that it may
agree to other Bishops also: for Timothy was a Bishop, as it shall be by
better reason proved, than you Tract. 8.
are able to show any to the contrary: This that you speak of his
Euangelistship, and of his superiority in that respect, is only spoken
without reason or authority: but you shall have store of both to the
contrary (God willing) when I come to that place.

I am not so lauishe of my witnesses, as you are of scornful and unseemly
tauntes and speeches.

Both Ambrose and Chrysostom. do not say, that Paul here warns Timothy
only to be circumspect, but to be circumspect in appoynting of Ministers: and
if it were not so, I doubt not, but that I should hear of it. The words are
spoken to Timothy in respect that he was Bishop, neither has the Apostle
given any such like Admonition to any Church, in any of his Epistles, as I
have before noted. And therefore Ambrose in his exposition of this place to
Timothy (after that he had showed what circumspection the Apostle would have
to be used in ordeyning of Ministers) concludes thus: Haec Episcopus
custodiens, castum se exbibebit religioni: A Bishop observing Ambrose.
these things, shall show himself pure in religion. Whereby he signifies
that this precept is properly perteyning to a Bishop. Chrysostom also in the.
1. Tim. 4. upon Chrysostom.
these words, Cum impositione manuum presbyterij, says, Non de presbyteris
hoc loco, sed de Episcopis loquitur* non enim profecto presbyteri ipsum
ordinarunt: He speaks not of priests in this place, but of Bishops, for
certaynely priests did not ordeyne him. And Oecolam^ Oecolampad.
upon the same words: Presbyteros dicit Episcopos, neque enim presbyteri
Episcopum ordinabant, He calls Bishops Priests, for Priests did not ordeyne
a Bishop. Whereby it plainly appears that these ancient fathers think this
precept, manus cito ne cui imponas: lay thy hands suddenly on no man, to be
given only to Timothy in the respect that he was Bishop, and therefore also
to apperteyne unto Bishops only to ordeyne Ministers.

Hierome upon that place to Titus says: Audiant Episcopi qui habent
constituendi Hierome.
Presbyteros per vrbes singulas potestatem, sub quali lege ecclesiasticae
potestatis ordo teneatur: Let Bishops which have authority to appoint
Ministers in every city, hear in what law the order of ecclesiastical
authority does consist. And a little after (speaking also of Bishops)
Whereby it is manifest that those which contemning the Apostles rule, will
not bestow the ecclesiastical degree upon any for desert, but for favor, to
do against Christ. etc. Hierome here takes the Bishop only to have
authority to ordeyne and appoint Ministers. And Chrysostom upon the same
place says that Paul did Chrysostom. in 1. Tit.
those things himself that required greatest labor and travel: but left
other things of honor and commendation to Titus, as ordeyning of Bishops. So
says Theophilact likewise. Thus then you see how evidently both those places
of scripture, and also these ancient fathers do overthrow that saying of the
Admonition, that the right of ordering ministers does at no hand apperteyne to
a Bishop. And how manifestly also the same have justified that which I have
said, that is, that Bishops have authority to admit ministers: for these be
my very words.

Now how corruptly you have dealt with me here in this place, I would wish
The corrupt dealing of T. C.
the indifferent Reader to consider: where I say, that Bishops have authority
to admit ministers, you make me to say, that the election of ministers by one
man was in ye Apostles time. And where I say, yt these words of Paul to
Timothy ( manus cito ne cui imponas. etc.) be an admonition to Timothy, that
he ought to be circumspect in appoynting of ministers: you make the reader
believe that I say, that it is a commandment given by Paul to Timothy, that
the Bishop only should choose the minister. And where I say that Hierome and
others do expound these words to Titus (vt constituas oppidatim. etc.) of the
authority that Titus had in placing ministers in every Church: you report
them, as though I should say, that Hierome proves the right of the
election of the minister to belong to the Bishop only: where I have ordeyning,
there you have election: And where I say, belongs to the Bishop, there say
you, belongs to the Bishop only. Is this your sincerity? dare you accuse
other men of corruption, being guilty of it your self almost in every line?
True it is, that I am persuaded that both Timothy and Titus, and consequently
other Bishops, have authority to ordeyne and appoint ministers alone, which I
have also partly proved before, and shall do partly hereafter, as I have
occasion: But yet all men that be not blind may see, that I have affirmed no
such thing in that part of my answer to the Admonition.

I have always greatly esteemed the judgments and opinions of learned men, and
howsoever you are persuaded of your own excellency, and dexterity of wit, yet
am I content to submit my self to the opinions of other, to whom I am in no
respect comparable: and then do I think my self to have reason sufficient,
when I have good authority of the scriptures, and of learned writers.

Aristotle spoke as a heathenish Philosopher, of such profane sciences, as be
grounded not upon authority, but upon natural and human reason: but that
that we profess is of an other nature, for it is grounded upon authority, and
for the authority sake to be believed, what reason soever there is to the
contrary. And surely I marvel what you mean so often to quarrel with me, for
the alleging of the authority of learned writers: except it be because you
have not red so many your self, or else that you would seem your self to be
the Author and inuentor of those reasons, which you have borrowed of them:
which in deed, is to win the praise of a good wit unto your self, and to
rob the learned writers of their just commendation. Therefore to answer you
briefly in this matter, I think authority in divine matters to be the best
Authority the best proof in divine matters.
reason, whether it be of the scriptures themselves, or of such learned men as
do rightly interpret ye same. And I deem it to be much more honesty in using
their authorities to express their names (that they may have their just
commendation, and the matter the more credit) than using their authorities,
and suppressing their names, vaynely and arrogantly to usurp as my own, that
which I have borrowed out of them.

I know Master Caluines interpretation upon that place, and likewise what
Musculus says of the same in his Common places, titu. de electione
ministrorum: but the words of the text be plain. And forasmuch as you make a
distinction betwixt electing and ordeyning, and say, that electing perteyneth
to the people, and ordeyning to the Bishop: Page 41. lin. 4.
Likewise that the Apostle in this place speaks of ordeining, and not of
electing, you must of necessity confess, that by saying sicut tibi
ordinaram, as I appointed Tit. 1.
thee, he means only imposition of hands and prayer: as though he should
say, vt constituas opidatim presbyteros suut tibi ordinaram. sci. per
impositionem manuum and orationem: That thou should ordeyne Ministers in
every city as I appointed thee (that is to say) by laying on of hands, and
by prayer. And thus do learned Interpreters also expound this place: Neither
is Musculus his meaning much otherwise, as it may appear to those that well
consider his words: especially if your distinction betwixt electing and
ordeyning hold, and if Paul speak here of ordeyning only: for in ordeining
of Ministers the Apostles used laying on of hands as a ceremony, they prayed
also Act. 14.
and fasted. But if you will have the Apostle here to speak of electing also,
then does he expound him self, when he says: Si quis est inculpatus. etc.
If any by unreprovable, Tit. 1.
the husband of one wife. etc. For how can you otherwise make those words
aptly to hang together? No doubt the Apostle gave Titus an especial charge in
ordeyning of Ministers, to have respect unto these qualities: of which charge
he puts him in mind when he says, that he left him at Creta, to ordeyne
Ministers in every city, as he appointed him, that is, such as be
unreprovable. etc.

I know there be some that expound this place thus also: that for as much as
Paul when he left Titus in Creta, did will him to ordeyne Ministers in every
city, now he puts him in mind of the same by his letters, and wills him
to do according to his appointment, that is, to place Ministers in every
city: and surely this interpretation has good reason: for being absent, we
commonly use to put them in mind by letters, to whom we have committed any
thing to be done, of such things as we willed them to do, when we were present
with them.

I reverence Master Calvin as a singular man, and worthy instrument in Christ's
Church: but I am not so wholly addicted unto him, that I will contemn other
men's judgments that in diverse points agree not fully with him, especially in
the interpretation of some places of the Scripture, when as in my opinion they
come nearer to the true meaning and sense of it in those points, than he does.

I did never cleave to Musculus, or to any other man so, that for his or their
sakes I derogate any thing from such as be comparable to them, and have
deserved singular commendation for their writings. If any one, or mo learned
men be of my judgment, though all be not, I am not ashamed to use their
testimony in that point, though in some other points I do not consent unto
them.

If I either vnioynt or rack in pieces from the rest, any word or sentence of
Master Caluines, make it known, set it open, that I may justly bear the blame
of it: but if I deal truly and faithfully with him, if I set down his own
words, whole sentences, whole sections, and (as you say) whole leaves, without
adding, altering, or diminishing, then how can you excuse your so untrue and
unjust charging of me? Which, if it were not so common and usual with you,
might the better be tolerated.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 46. Sect. 1.
It is the general consent of all the learned fathers, that it perteyneth to

all other Ministers, in that the ordering and appoynting of Ministers does
properly perteyne unto him. And yet these men say, that the right of ordering
Ministers does at no hand apperteyne to a Bishop. But for the order and
manner of making Ministers, peruse the book made for that purpose, and as I
said before, so I say again, if thou have any judgment thou can not but
like it, and allow of it.

In the end you say it is the general consent of all the learned Fathers,
that it belongs to the Bishop to choose the Minister. Because you acquaynte
my ears with such bold and untrue affirmations, I can now the more
patiently hear you thus baunting your self, as though you had all the fathers
by heart, and carried them about with you, wheresoever you went, whereas if
a man would measure you by the skill in them, which you have showed here, he
would hardly believe that you had red the tenthe part of them.

Are all the learned Fathers of that mind? I think then you would have bin
better advised, than to have set down but one, when as you know a matter in
controversy will not be tried but by two or three witnesses, unless the Lord
speak him self: and therefore you give me occasion to suspecte that because
you cite but I had cited Am brose and Chrysostom before.
one, you know of no more. Now let us see what your one witness will depose
in this matter.

And first of all, you have done more wisely than simply, in that you have
altered Hieromes words. For where he says, wherein does a Bishop differ from
an Elder, but only in ordeyning: you say, a Bishop does excel all other
Ministers. etc. I report me here unto your conscience, whether you did not of
purpose change Hierome his sentence, because you would not let the Reader
understand what odds is between S. Hieromes Bishops in his days, and
between our Lord Bishops. For then the Bishop had nothing above an Elder, or
other mininister, but only the ordeyning of the Minister. Now he has a
thousand Parishes, where the Minister has but one. For the matters also of
the substance of the ministry, the Bishop now excommunicateth, which the
Minister can not. Besides diverse other things, which are mere civil, which
the Bishop does, and which neither Bishop nor other Minister ought to do. I
say, I report me to your conscience, whether you altered Hieromes words to
this end, that you would keep this from the knowledge of your reader, or no.
For answer to the place, it is an It is your argument, it is none of mine: my
worcester des importetio such thing.
evil argument to say, the Bishop had the ordeyning of the Minister, Ergo he
had the election of him. The contrary rather is a good argument: the Bishop
had the ordeyning of the Minister, therefore he had not the election of him.
For ordination and election are diverse Diverse mem bers of the whole may concur
in one, and the self same person, though one of them can not be verified of an
other
members of one whole, which is the placing of the Pastor in his Church, and
one member can not be verified of an other, as you can not say your foot is
your hand. I will not deny, but that sometimes these words may be found
confounded in Ecclesiastical writers, but I will show you also, that they are
distinguished, and that the election perteyneth to the people, and Then have
you all this while striued in vay ne.
ordeyning unto the Bishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
Show me one Father that denies that, which I here affirm: if you neither
do, nor can, then may my skill in the Fathers, and reading also be as much
(for any thing here to the contrary) as you think I would have it seem to
be. But I will not follow you in your vain of gybing. I had cited before
Chrysostom and Ambrose, for the same purpose, so that my witnesses be three,
and therefore sufficient, except you will make some lawful exception against
them: but because you may understand that I have plenty and store sufficient,
I will rehearse but one sentence unto you of M. Caluines, in his Institu. Cap.
8. Ordinari Episcopos a suis Metropolitis, iubent Calvin.
omnes veteres Synodi: All ancient Synodes do command that Bishops should be
ordained of their Metropolitanes.

What cause should I have thus to report Hieromes words, to prove such
difference betwixt the Bishop and other Ministers, seeing that does not
perteyne to this place: and again, considering that I have at large proved the
same in another place? Are you so dull of understanding as you would seem to
be? do not both the words that go before, and those that follow also,
declare my purpose in using that place? I do not translate Hieromes words,
but I declare Hieromes meaning: and if the offense be in this, that I say a
bishop does excel al other ministers, then does your own Author Illiricus
(out of whom you have verbatim borrowed so much) and the other writers of the
Centu. offend also: for thus he says: Ordinatio ministrorum propria erat
Episcopi, quo solo iure caeteris sacerdotibus praestantiorem esse Episcopum
Centu. 4. ca. 7.
Hieronymus scripsit ad Euagrium: The ordeyning of Ministers was proper unto
the Bishop, by the which (as Hierome wrote unto Euagrius) a Bishop only
excels other priests: out of whom as I have borrowed this word excel, so
have you borrowed also this word only: for the words of Hierome be these: quid
enim facit excepta ordinatione Hie. ad Euag.
Episcopus, quod presbyter non facit: What does a Bishop, which a Minister
does not, except ordination? Whereby he manyfestly affirms as much as I in
this place require: that is, that the right of ordering Ministers does
apperteyne to the Bishop. The same also Chrysostom in the like words writes
in. 1. Ti. 3.

Touching the difference betwixt a Bishop and a common minister, of the
superiority of Bishops, and of their jurisdiction (for avoiding of confusion,
where unto you here provoke me) I will speak when I come to that part of this
book.

You say that this is an evil argument, The Bishop has the ordeyning of the
Minister, Election and ordinatio may concur in one person.
Ergo he has the election of him. etc. I think it is a very good argument,
and that you are greatly deceived when you say election and ordination can not
concur in one, and the self same person, although they may be
distinguished the one from the other. Had not the Master of the College
interest in the electing of you when you were chosen to be fellow, and did he
not also admit you? was there not then both election and admission in one
man? And is not the like in other degrees of learning? Has not he authority
to elect, that has authority to admit, that is, to ordeyne? or have you
an example of any lawfully placed in the ministry, without the election and
admission of the Bishop? Have you forgotten what you alleged T. C. forgets
him selie*
before out of the Council of Carthage, the Council of Toledo. etc. where it
is sufficiently expressed, that the election of Ministers does as well perteyne
to the Bishops, as it does to the people? And do not all the examples and
places of scripture that you have alleged for your purpose, verify the same?
Wherefore though election and ordination so differ the one from the other,
that the one can not be said to be the other, yet may they well be joined
together in one subject: as Prudence, Justice, Temperance and Fortitude are,
being notwithstanding members of one whole. But this has deceived you, that
you think, because diverse members An oversight of T. C.
of one whole, can not be confounded among themselves, and one verified of an
other, therefore they may not meet together in one and the self same person,
which is a gross ouersighte of yours: for take your own example: although
your foot is not your hand, yet (I am sure) you would be sorry if one man
might not have both feet and hands.

But what need I labor any thing in proving this: for you your self confess
more than I affirmed, and as much as I require, that is, that election and
ordination are sometimes confounded in Ecclesiastical writers: And therefore
the one taken for the other. I do not deny but that sometimes also they be
distinguished, although the Admonition in this place that I do now confute,
does utterly confound them.

Upon the sixte of the Acts, the gloss has, that that which was done there
of the twelve Apostles, in willing the brethren to look out fit men, was
done to give us example, and must be observed in those that are ordained: for
says the gloss, the people must choose, and the Bishop must ordeyne. And
that S. Hierome must be so understands, it appears not only that it has
been so expounded: but also it may be easily proved, for that S. Hieromes
sentence and judgment appears in other places, that he would have nothing
here done without the people, as in his Epistle ad Rusticum monachum, he
Hieromes words (...).
wills that the people should have power and authority to choose their
Clearkes and their Ministers. And in his Epistle to Neopotian, of the life of
the clearks, he has this distinction manifestly: An untruth* proceeding of
gross ignorance for these are Musculus his words, and not Hieromes.
They run, says he, unto the Bishops suffraganes, certain times of the
year, and bringing some sum of money, they are anointed and ordained, being
chosen of none, and afterward, the Bishop without any lawful election, is
chosen in hugger mugger, of the Canons and Prebendaries only, without the
knowledge of the people. And so you see, that although that S. Hierome says,
that the Bishop had the ordeyning of the Ministers, yet he had not the
election, for the ordeyning was nothing else but an approving of the election,
by putting on of hands, and consequently, having made your vaunt, that all the
learned Fathers were of this judgment, that the Bishop should elect the
Minister, you show not so much as one.

Io. Whitgifte.
What gloss says so? where shall a man find it? or where is it? this is to
large a scope that you take unto your self. But I must pardon you, for
Illiricus; of whom you have borrowed it, does not otherwise quote the place.
Nowebeit the words as Illiricus does report them (which I think are taken
out of glossa ordinaria) make nothing against any thing that I have said: for
if you will thus reason: The Bishop must ordeyne, Ergo, he may not elect? I
deny your argument, the reason I have showed before, one man may both ordeyne
and elect.

You have utterly falsified Hieromes words ad Rusticum monachum, and much T.
C. falsifieth Hierome.
more declined from the true interpretation of them, than I would have
suspected, especially seeing you would be thought to have intrapped me in the
like not long before. For the words of Hierome be these: Cum ad perfectam
aetatem veneris, si tamen Hier. ad Rustic. Monachum.
vita comes fuerit, and te vel populus, vel Pontifex ciuitatis in clerum
elegerit, agito quae clerici sunt: When thou shalt come to perfect age, if
thy life be answerable, and either the people, or the Bishop of the City shall
choose thee into the Clergy, do such things as belong to a Clearke. He
does not here will that the people should have authority to choose their
Clearks and their Ministers, as you say, but he says unto Rusticus the
Monk, that if either the people, or the Bishop of the City choose him to be
Clearke, that then he must do those things that perteyne to a Clearke. He
says, vel populus, vel Pontifex. etc. signifying that it was a thing
indifferent to be chosen either by the people, or by the Bishop: which makes
for me against you, for I say that a Bishop may choose a minister, and you
deny it.

The place that you allege out of the Epistle of Hierome, ad Nepotianum de
vita T. C. fathereth that upon Hierome, whi che is not to be found in him, but
is in Muscuins.
Clericorum, is not to be found in Hierome. They be Master Musculus his own
words, Titu. de verbi ministris. And because that he does adioyne them to a
place which he has alleged out of Hierome, therefore you think them to be
alleged of him as Hieromes words, which is a gross ouersighte, and argues
that you have not read the Authors them selves. Oh, how would you have
triumphed if the like could have been espied in my book. There is a manifest
place to the contrary in that Epistle to Nepotian, for thus he says: Gloria
patris est filius sapiens: Hierome ad Nepoti.
gaudeat Episcopus iudicio suo, cum tales Christo elegerit sacerdotes: A wise
son is the glory of the father: let the Bishop rejoice and be glad of
his judgment, when he has chosen unto Christ such Priests. Here might I
triumph over you (both for corrupting of Hieromes words, and fathering that
upon him which is not to be found in him) if I were disposed to deal with you
so profanely in a divine and serious matter. Only this I wish, that by these
gross ouersightes, you would learn one poyne of wisdom, that is, to be
modest, and to know your self.

Now will I show you the clean contrary of that you say, not that I gladly
travail this ways, for if you had not constrained me, you should not have
heard one voice this way. And would to God, that you would be content,
especially when you meet with those that will be tried by the Scriptures, to
seek no farther strength than they give you. But I am loathe you should
oppress the truth, and make all men afraid of it, by making them believe,
that it is so desolate and forsaken of her friends, as you pretend. You
confess S. Cyprian is against you herein, and he was a learned Father, and a
Martyr also, which did not only use this form of election, but also taught
it to be necessary, and commanded, and therefore me thinks you should not
have said all the learned Fathers without exception: you see also We have seen
it, finally to your credit.
S. Jerome is of another judgment. S. Augustine also when he speaks how he
appointed Eradius to succeed him, showed, how it was the approved right and
custom, that the whole Church should either choose or consent of their Bishop.
And Ambrose says that that is truly and ^. Epistle.
certainly a divine election to the office of a Bishop, which is made of yt
whole Church. Gregorius Nazianzene in the oration which he had at the death of
his father, has diverse things which prove that the election of the minister
perteyned to the Church, and This is an untruth, for he makes no such
confutation there.
confuteth those things which should seem to hinder it. These were learned
fathers, and yet thought not, that the election of the Pastor or Bishop,
perteyned to one man alone, but that the Church had also her interest,
therefore you see all the learned fathers are not of that mind, you say they
are.

Io. Whitgifte.
To Cyprian I have answered before: the people gave their consent in his time:
Cyprian choo seth without the consent of the people.
but yet was he bold sometime to elect clearks without them, as it appears
lib. 2. epist. 5. which he writes unto the Clergy and people, signifying
unto them that it was not necessary to have their consent in choosing one
Aurelius a Clearke: his words be these: In ordinandis clericis (fratres
charissimi) solemus vos ante consulere, and mores ac merita Cypri. lib. 2.
epist. 5.
singulorum communi consilio ponderare. Sed expectanda non sunt testimonia
humana, cum praecedunt diuina suffragia etc. In the election of Clearks
(beloved brethren) we were wont to take your advise before, and to weigh with
common advise every man's manners and deserts: But the testimonies of men are
not to be looked for, when divine suffrages have gone before. In these words
also it appears, what interest the people then had in electio^s, What
interest the people had in Cyprians time.
even to bear witness and to testify of the good life and conversation of
such, as should be admitted into the Clergy.

Jerome himself (whatsoever your counterfeyte Jerome does affirm) agrees
with me.

Did not Illiricus tell you where Augustine speaks these words, neither in
what tome, nor in what book, nor in what epistle? Surely Augustines works are
far larger, than Musculus common places. But the treatise you mean of, is in
his second tome among his epistles, in number 110. I would wish the learned
reader to peruse it, then shall he soon perceive, how little it makes for
your purpose, and how aptly The testimony of Augustine cited by T. C. serves
not his purpose*
it serves mine. First he does not show that it was the approved right and
custom, that the whole Church should either choose, or consent of their
Bishop: if he do, lay down his words: if you cannot, then has Illiricus his
collection deceived you. Secondly, although it may there appear that the
people used to give their consents, yet Augustine both by his own act, and by
the act of Seuerus bishop of Milleum; declares that not to be so necessary, or
such a right, but that it may be, upon just considerations, altered. Last of
all, the words of Augustine be plain, which I will only set down and leave
them to the consideration of the reader. Augustine showing his reasons why he
did appoint Eradius to succeed him, says thus: scio post obitus episcoporum.
etc. I know that Churches Aug. 2. to. (...).
use after the deaths of Bishops, to be much troubled through ambitious or
co^tentious persons: and it is my duty (so much as lies in me) to provide
for this city, least that thing (whereof I have often times had experience to
my grief) should happen. Then he shows Contention in popular (...) lections.
what a stir there was alittle before in the Church of Milleum about their
Bishop, at what time he was sent for unto them, to appease the controversy,
and declaring how in the end, they willingly embraced him, whom Seuerus their
Bishop, Byshopsappoynt their successors.
whilst he was alive, appointed unto them, he says, minus tamen aliquid
factum erat, vnde nonnulli. etc. Yet was there somewhat less done, whereby
diverse were offended, because my brother Seuerus thought it sufficient to
appoint his successor in the presence of the Clergy, and spoke not thereof
unto the people: by occasion whereof some grief was conceived. But what needs
more words? it pleased God, the grief was expelled, joy came in place, and he
was admitted Bishop, whom the predecessor had appointed. And it follows
immediately, Ergo ne aliqui de me querantur, voluntatem meam, quam credo dei
esse, in omnium vestrum notitiam profero, presbyterum Eradium mibi successorem
volo. etc. Therefore least any should complain of me, I do here signifye
unto you all my will (which I think to be the will of God) I will have
Eradius the mynister to be my successoure. etc. Lastly he shows how he
himself was appointed Bishop, his predecessor being yet alive.

Here it is to be noted, first, what stir began to be in Augustines time
about such Notes out of the restunome of Augustine.
elections made by the people, which was the cause why he and others appointed
unto themselves successors whilst they yet lived. Secondly, that Seuerus
appointed to himself a successor, and thought it not necessary therein to
require the consent of the people, which he would not have neglected if it had
bin either necessary or usual: Last of all, that Augustine pronounces Eradius
to be his successor in the presence of the people, that they might know his
mind, but yet without asking their voices, although they did willingly of
themselves consent: for that which afterward he requires them to subscribe
unto, was the petition that he made unto them, no more to trouble him with
their civil matters, but that they would resort unto Eradius his successor for
such causes. When the reader has well considered these circumstances, which
he shall better learn in the place itself, then let him judge how much it
serves for your turn.

It may appear by that Epistle of Ambrose, what contention there was in
Vercellensi Contention about popular elections.
ecclesia (to the which he wrote) about the election of their Bishop, for they
had been long destitute of one, as it there appears. Wherefore he exhorts
them to agree* meant, by the example of their predecessors, who so well agreed
in choosing of Eusebius, whereupon he says, merito vir tantus (meaning
Eusebius) euasit, quem omnis elegit ecclesia: Ambro. epi. 82
merito creditum, quod diuino esset electus iudicio, quem onmes postulauissent.
He worthily proved a notable man, whom the whole Church elected: he was
rightly thought to be chosen by gods appointment, whom every one desired. And
who doubts but that he is called of God, whom the whole Church without
suite, without sinister affection, without intent to maintain factions and
schisms, does desire? this proves, that in Ambrose his time, in that Church
the people desired their Bishop: which is not to be denied: but it also shows
that in the same time, there were marvelous contentions about such elections:
which is to be considered.

Nazianzene in that oration, has not one argument to prove that the election
of the minister Nazianzene performs not that for the which he is avouched.

does perteyne to the Church, neither does he confute those things which should
seem to hinder it: for there is none alleged: only he declares what a
marvelous stir and sedition there was, at two sundry times, in the Church of
Caesaria, about the election of the Bishop, what violence was used about the
same, how the people were divided among themselves first, and after against
their ministers. Likewise how they suddenly misliked their own choice, and
would have disanulled it, if they had not bin restreyned of their wills by
Nazianzene, his father. How the Emperor also, and the ruler of the city,
taking part with the factious company, were by him pacifyed. Surely this makes
very little to the commendation of popular elections: Nay in the second
contention that he there recites, declaring who were the especial authors of
it, he says, Ecclesiae enim a malo erant immunes pariter and opulentiores and
pote^tiores, sed omnis The common people especial authors of tumults in
elections.
impetus ac seditio inter plebem erat, ac precipue vilissimam: For the churches
(meaning the Clergy) were clear from that mischief, so were the richer sort
also, and they which were of greater authority, but all the violence and
sedition was among the common people, and among them especially, which were of
the basest sort. And a little after, telling how his father pacifyed that
sedition, he says, that his father writ unto them, admonished them, p^pulum,
sacerdotes, necnon alios and quotquot qui ad gradum pertinebant, obtestabatur,
eligebat, * calculum ferebat. etc. He humbly entreated the people, the priests,
and others which perteyned (...).
to that order, he elected, chose. etc. What is here spoken that makes not
rather against you, than with you, no man denies but that the people at this
time had interest in the election of the minister in diverse Churches, but that
does not prove that they ought to have so now, or that the Bishop has no
interest in the same: nay inconveniences of popular elections did then
manifestly appear.

There is not as yet one authority brought in to prove that the ordering of
ministers T. C. reasons not ad idem, and defends not the Admonition.
does at no hand apperteine to the bishop, which the Admonition affirms, and
I have improued: but you have not replied unto it, keeping your old accustomed
manner still, not to reason ad idem: for whereas you should conclude thus: the
ordering of ministers does at no hand perteyne to a Bishop, you conclude thus:
The election T. C. lets slip ye which he should prove and yet proves not
that which he would. The propositions that should have bin defended
of a Pastor or Bishop perteyneth not to one man alone. And yet you have not
proved that, only you bring in examples of popular elections: and so have I
brought in both examples, and authorities for the sole election of the Bishop:
for they be both true. But you ought to prove these two propositions, if you
will justify the Admonition: first, that popular elections ought to be
perpetual: and secondly: that the ordeyning of ministers does at no hand
perteyne to the Bishop. But you subtly pass these over, and cast a mist
before your readers eyes, in heaping up, out of Illiricus needelesse proofs.

And that this election continued in the Church, until within a CCC. years,
at what time there was more than Egyptiacall, and palpable darkness over the
face of the whole earth, it may appear in a treatise of Flaccus Illiricus,
which he calls an addition unto his book that he entituleth the catalogue

much, but almost altogether.
much helped in this matter of the choice of the Church touching the
ministers: especially in the Emperors edicts which are before cited. For
lacking opportunities diverse ways, I was contented somewhat to use the
collection to my commodity, for the more speedy furtherance, and better
proceeding in other matters, which I will leave of, because they may be there

books, of Eusebius, where An untruth: for there ^no such thing to be found in

besides that the customs of the peoples choice is set forth, there are
examples of the election of the people and Clergy, which were confirmed by

Christian magistrate, namely in the Bishop of Constantinople. And these may
suffice for the other that have not that commodity of books, nor ability,
nor skill to read them, being in a strange tongue, to know, that besides the
institution of God in his word, this manner of electing did continue so long,
as there was any sight of the knowledge of God in the Church of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
Illiricus his treatise that you speak of, does nothing prejudice the cause
that I have in hand, touching the authorities there alleged: for the question
is not whether it has bin so or no, but whether it be convenient and
profitable for the Church to have it so now. The reasons that Illiricus uses,
beside his authorities, are of no great force to prove either necessity or
conueniencie, of such elections in this Church, as the state is now.

You do well to confess the help that you had by Illiricus, for it could not

vnespyed, seeing you have almost verbatim drawn all the authorities, and
reasons that you use in this cause out of him. And truly I marvel with what
face you can so opprobriously object unto me, other men's collections, and lack
of reading the ancient writers, when as it is evident that your whole book
consists of other men's notes, and collections: and that you your self have
scarce read any one of the Authors that you have alleged, 18. authorities at
the least you have borrowed of Illiricus, in this cause, besides certain other
reasons.

You refer the reader to the. 6. and. 7. book of Eusebius, where you say
both the forms of elections in those tunes are described, and the customs of
the peoples choice set forth, and diverse examples of the elections of the
people and Clergy. etc. But the reader should have been something beholding
to you, if you had named the Chapters as well as you have done the books:
Howebeit you do very politikely, to refer your readers to the whole books,
which you are sure the most of them cannot, and of those that can, many will T.
C. sends his reader to Eusebius for that which he shall not find in him.
Euse. lib. 6. cap. 10.
not peruse: but you have not dealt faithfully, for it is not to be found in
any part of these two books, where the customs of the peoples choice is set
forth, or any example of the people and Cleargies election confirmed by the
Christian Magistrate. Nor yet any example of any Bishop of Constantinople. The
contrary rather may be collected in sundry places. In the sixte Book Eusebius
declares that in the absence of Narcissus (because it was not known where he
was) The gouernoures of the Churches adjoining, ordeyne another Bishop.

And after Narcissus return, because he was aged, the story says: dictum
Alexandrum alterius paroeciae etc. That the ordinance of God called the said
Alexander, being Bishop of another parish, to undertake that charge with
Narcissus, according to a vision which was in the night revealed unto him: And
in ye next chapter he shows how that those of Jerusalem received the said
Bishop courteously, and would not suffer him to return to the place where he
was Bishop before, they being admonished by a vision in the night, which
signified unto them, that they should go out of the city gates and receive
their Bishop appointed unto them by God: which thing they also did by the
consent vicinorum Episcoporum, of the Bishops adjoining. What for me or manner
of electing can you gather of this place? except you will admit visions, and
call them from one Byshopricke to another, to help some, that is grown in
age. Neither is here any mention made of the election of the people: for this
that he says Hierosolomitani went out. etc. it may rather be understood of
the ministers and deacons of Jerusalem, than of the people.

In the. 7. book cap. 30. it appears that the ministers and Pastors had then
authorite to choose Bishops. Only in the. 6. book there is one example that may
seem something to make for your purpose until it be well considered. It is of
one Fabianus who was chosen Bishop of Rome (as it is there reported) in this
manner: cum fratres omnes Lib. 6. cap. 29.
ad ordinandum futurum Episcopum in ecclesia congregati essent. etc. The
report goes (when as all the brethren were assembled together in the Church,
to choose him which should be Bishop, and many of them determined of diverse
worthy and notable men, Fabianus himself being present with the rest, and no
man minding to choose him, that a dove falling from above (like as the holy
ghost descended upon our savior in likeness of a dove) did light upon his
head, and so the whole people being with one spirit much moved, did together
with great joy and with one consent proclayme him worthy to be Bishop, and
immediately took him, and placed him in the Bishops seat. Here we may learn
that Fabianus was miraculously chosen to his Bishopric, and that the people
moved with this miracle did burst out into commendation of him, and thought him
worthy to be Bishop: does it therefore follow that they elected him? for it
may be doubted whether those brethren that came together to ordeyne the Bishop,
were of the Clergy, or of the people.

It is not denied but at this time the people did sometimes, and in some places
give their consents in the electing of their Bishop: yet does not this example
prove it, being (as it may appear) extraordinary: neither is there in these
two books any form of such elections described, nor any customs of the
peoples choice set forth: much less any examples of the elections of the
people and clergy which were confirmed by the Christian Magistrate, as you
affirm. And surely I marvel what you mean to speak of any such
confirmation by the Christian magistrate, seeing it is manifest, that as yet,
there was no Christian Magistrate mentioned by Eusebius, except only one Philip
Emperor of Rome, of whom he speaks very little: and makes no mention of
any elections made in his time: so far off is he, from expressing examples of
any confirmation of such electio^s, by any christian magistrate. Namely (you
say) in the Bishop of Co^sta^tinople, A gross oueright of T. C.
and yet there is no such example in either of those books, no not so much as
one word of any Bishop of Constantinople. And yt it may appear how far you ar
ouerseene in this place, you shall understand that the last Emperor of whom
Eusebius makes any mention in these books, is Dioclesian, who came to the
Empire Anno. 288. but Constantinople was builded Anno. 335. So that by your
assertion the Bishop of Constantinople was confirmed above. 40. years before
Constantinople was.

I will add only one place, which if it be more Part^riunt montes. etc.
bitter than the rest, and cut the quick more near, you shall not be angry
with me, but first with those that were the Authors of it, and then with him
that wrote it.

Eusebius in the sixth book speaking of Origin, which was admitted not of one
Bishop, but of many Bishops to teach, shows how the Bishops were reprehended
by the Bishop of Alexandria called Demetrius, because they had admitted him An
untruth as will appear.
without the election of the Presbytery of the Church, which were the chief
in the election in every Church, and unto the which the Churches did commit
the government of themselves in every several town and city, and says that
it has not bin heard, that (...) should (...) which is, that the lay men
should teach when the Bishops were present. Whereby it is evident, that he
counted him Untruth, for O^gea was yet a lay man, and not admitted minister by
any,
a lay man which was only admitted by the Bishops, although they were many, not
being first elected by the presbytery of that Church, whereof he was the
teacher.

Io. Whitgifte.
The terrible preface that is here prefixed would make any man quake that is
not acquainted with such vain bragges. But soft man awhile, you do but dream:
for there is no such matter in that book of Eusebius. Did you never hear tell
of any that T. C. smites at others, but wounds himself.
laboring to smite at another, have deadly wounded themselves? I believe it
will fall so out with you in this bitter and sharp place, and then shall not I
need to be angry with you: you shall have more cause to chafe with your self.

For answer to the place: I say it is altogether by you falsified, and most
untruly Eusebius fa^ sityed by T. C.
alleged: the only thing that Demetrius found fault with, was because Origin
being a lay man did teach in the Church, Bishops being present: for he
says: it was never heard that lay me^ should teach in the churches, Bishops
being present. But what is said to this, nescimus quomodo. etc. wherein he
affirms (we know not how) that thing which is not Eu. li. 6. ca. ^
true: seeing there may be found diverse, who when they were able to profit the
brethren, and that the holy Bishops had exhorted them to instruct the people,
did after this sort, teach in the Church. As Euelpis was required to do at
Laranda by Neon: and Paulinus at Iconium by Celsus: and at Synada Theodorus by
Atticus, which were all blessed brethren: And it is very likely that this
thing was done also in other places, which we know not of. Yea Demetrius
himself suffered him to do the like in Alexandria as it is manifest in sundry
places of that book: and even in the end of the same chapter He retourneth to
Alexandria, and does again employ himself to his accustomed diligence in
teaching. But because this place is so confidently avouched, and so untruly, I
will set it down as it is in Eusebius lib. 6. cap. 20. where he speaking of
Origin says thus: In the mean time (by reason of a great war begone in
that city) leuing Alexandria, and thinking that he could not safely abide in
Egypt, he went into Palestina, and remained at Caesaria, where also he was
requested of the Bishops of that country, that he would dispute, and expound
the holy scriptures before the whole Church, when as yet he was not ordained
minister. The which thing is hereby manifest, for that Alexander the Bishop of
Jerusalem, and Theoctistus Bishop of Caesaria, writing to Demetrius of him, do
after this sort render an account of that deed: Furthermore he adds this also
in his letters, that it was never heard of, neither yet at any time seen, that
lay men did teach in the Church, Bishops being present: wherein (we know not
how) he affirms that thing which is not true. etc. As it is set down before.
What one word is there here that shows how the Bishops were reprehended by
the Bishop of Alexandria called Demetrius, because they had admitted Origin,
without the election of the presbytery of the Church, which were the chief
in the election in every Church, and unto the which the Churches did commit
the government of themselves in every several town and city. etc. as you
affirm? Nay is there any thing sounding that way? the only cause why Demetrius
reproves them (as I have said) is, because they suffered Origin in their
presence to interpret the scriptures in the Church, being as yet Origin was
then indeed a lay man,
but a lay man. And yet you see how Demetrius is reproved for that also, and
how by sundry examples it is there showed, that it is no rare thing for a lay
man, to interpret the scriptures in the Church, the Bishop being present, if he
be there unto called by the Bishop.

Is this your bitter place? is this that terrible cutter? Indeed, it makes
your doings vncyphered, and shrewdly wounds you, if you can well consider it.

But to make the matter yet more plain. Eusebius. in the same book and. 23.
chapter shows how Origin afterward accepit presbyterij gradum in Caesaria
palestinae, ab eius loci Euse. lib. 6. 23.
Episcopis: was made minister in Caesaria Palestinae of the Bishops of that
country. The which thing Demetrius misliked also, not for any just cause, but
only of malice: for although Demetrius at the first esteemed well of Origin,
and bare good will unto him, yet afterward when he saw him maruellously to
prosper, and to become very famous and well accounted of, he then sought
means, not only to discredit him, but those also which had preferred him to
the ministry: laying to his charge that which he had done being a boy, (that
is, gelding of himself) as Eusebius does at large declare lib. 6. cap. 8. You
see therefore how untruly you have reported Eusebius, and that there is no such
cause by him expressed, why Demetrius reproved the Bishops, as you feyne to be.

But I partly smell your meaning, which I suppose to be this: that all we
which are admitted into the ministry by the Bishops, without your
presbytery, are but lay men: whereby you would insinuate, that all those which
have bin baptized by us, are not baptized: because you say, that it is of the
substance or being of baptism, whether Pa. 114. Sect. 1.
he be minister or no that ministers that sacrament, Page 114. And this is
that mystery, which you and your fellows will not as yet openly utter, but
craftily dissemble, until you see better opportunity. The truth is, your
intent is rebaptization, and flat Anabaytisme. But I have declared sufficiently
the vanity of your collection in this place: and the weakness of your
reasons touching this matter, where you have given me more especial occasion
to speak of it. Tract. 9.

Chap. 7. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page. 42. Sect. 2. 3.
Seeing then that the scripture does teach this order, that there should be no
minister thrust upon the Church, but by the consent thereof, and reason
persuades that ways, and the use of the Church has bin so from time to time:
both in peace and in time of persecution, both under tyrants, and godly
princes, it cannot be without the high displeasure of almighty God, the great
hurt and sore oppression of the church, that one man should take this unto him,
which perteyneth to so many, or one minister which perteyneth to more than one,
especially, where the advice of learned ministers may concur with the peoples
election or consent.

Now if any man will rise up and say that this doctrine brings in disorder,
and by this means children, boys, and women should have their voices: which is
unseemly, all men understand that where the election is most freest, and most
general, yet only they have to do, which are heads of families, and that this
is but a mere cavil to bring the truth in hatred, which is unworthy to be
answered, and requires rather a Censor, than a disputer to suppress it.

Io. Whitgifte.
The scripture does not teach any such order: it has examples to the
contrary: it presribeth herein no certain rule to be perpetual: there is
better reason to the contrary, if the diversity of the time and other
circumstances be considered: the Church also has not at all times nor in all
places used one form and manner of election: not in the Apostles time, as it
has bin declared: wherefore the Church is neither hurt, nor oppressed, if the
godly Magistrate alone do appoint in it Bishops, and take such order for
admitting other inferioure Pastors, as shall be thought to him most
conueniente: Neither is God displeased with them for so doing, if they seek
his glory therein, the godly peace and quietness of the Church, and have
respect to the end of the Apostles in appointing ministers. But he is greatly
displeased with those, that make a necessity where none is, and trouble the
Churches with their own devises, and make contention for external matters.

It is not necessary that the people should have interest in the election of
ministers, but the contrary is convenient.
Chap. 8. the. 1. Division.
Io. Whitgifte.
Now that you have uttered all your authorities and reasons, to prove that the
people ought to have interest in the electing of their ministers, and that I
have sufficiently (I trust) answered the same: Let it not be troublesome
unto you, if summarily I collect my reasons that move me to think the
contrary.

1. And first I will prove that there is no certain form of electing
prescribed in Scripture, but that the same is left free for the Churches to
appointe, as shall be thought most convenient for their states and times. 2.
Secondly, I will show, that there has been great diversity from time to
time, used in the Church, touching elections, and that the people at all
times, and in all places, have not been admitted thereunto. 3. Last of all, I
will set down the reasons why the people have been debarred from such
elections, and why they ought still so to be.
Touching the first, these be my reasons.
1. Christ (whose factes and deeds we ought especially to follow) did of
himself Math. 10. Luke. 10.
alone, without the consent of any, call, and choose his Apostles, and likewise
the 70. disciples whom he sent to preach. 2. The Apostles Acts. 1. altered
this manner and form: for they presented two, and the one of them was chosen by
lotte. 3. In the. 6. of the Acts, they clean altered this also: for the
people presented seven to the Apostles, and they were all chosen without
lottes, the Apostles also laid on their hands upon them. 4. In the. 14. of
the Acts this form is likewise changed, for Paul and Bar^abas ordained
ministers in every city, without either presentment by the people, or casting
of lottes. 5. In the. 13. of the Acts it is manifest, that Paul and Barnabas
were sent only by the Prophets and Doctors, without any consent of the
people, either given or required: read the beginning of the Chapter, it is
plain enough of it self. 6. Paul sent Timothy and Titus, and gave them
authority to ordeyne other: 1. Tim. 5 2. Tim. 1. Tit. 1.
So that it is certain, that here is no prescripte manner and form appointed,
to be observed for ever: seeing that the Apostles themselves did not bynd or
tie themselves to any such rule: which both M. Bullinger, Zuinglius, and
Beza, do likewise confess, as I have before declared. And therefore M.
Calvin (as I told you before) says, that of that example in the first of the
Acts no certain rule can be gathered of electing and choosing ministers. And
M. Beza is of the same judgment both for that example Act. 1. and the other
also of Deacons Act. 6. as I have likewise declared before. And in that book
of confession and. 5. Chapter, he has this saying worthy to be noted:
Because the multitude is for the most part ignorant and intractable, and the
Beza lib. con^ cap. 5.
greater part does oftentimes prevail against the better, not in a popular
state lawfully appointed, are all things committed to the unbridled multitude:
but certain Magistrates are appointed by the consent of the people, to rule and
govern them: if this wisdom be in worldely affairs, much more is a
moderation to be had in those matters, wherein men be oftentimes blinded.
Neither is there any cause why any man of sound judgment should exclame that
in such matters there is no place for policy, except he can show this policy
whereof I speak, to be repugnant to the word of God, which I think he can
not: Hitherto M. Beza: and he speaks of the electors of Ministers. And a
little after he says, that we must not always look what the Apostles did in
Ecclesiastical policy, Idem.
or in the government of the Church, seeing there is so great diversity of
circumstances, that a man can not without preposterous zeal reduce all things
in all places and times, to one and the same form: but it is sufficient, if
respect be had to their end and purpose, which is not variable, and that
manner and form used which leads thereunto. etc. Whereupon also I conclude,
that in the Scriptures there is no certain form prescribed The end of the
Apostles in ecclesiastical policy, must be regar ded, and not their deeds.
Ibidem.
of electing ministers: and that the doings of the Apostles in that matter,
are not at all times of necessity to be followed: but it is sufficient to
respect their end and purpose, that is, that there be meet ministers: and
therefore M. Beza says, No man may here prescribe any certain rule, but if the
conscience be good, it is an easy matter to determine what is most expedient
for time, place, and other circumstances.
Chap. 8. the second Division.
2 Touching the second, that is for the diversities of elections afterward
used in That the people were not always admitted to the election of ministers.

the Church, and that the people were not always admitted to the same, I
refer you to that which has been spoken before, out of Eusebius and
Zuinglius, of the Apostles appoynting of James to be Bishop of Jerusalem:
of Cypri lib. 1. Epist. 4. where he plainly confesses, that, electing by the
people was not then general, in that he says, Et fe^e per prouincias
vniuersas tenetur, and does the contrary himself in choosing one Aurelius
without the consent of the people Lib. 2. Epist 5. Likewise of the 18. Can. of
the Council of Ancyrane. 18. Canon of the Council of Antioche. 12. and 13.
Can. Con. Lao diceni: All which Canons and Councels I have alleged before.

In the first of the Canons attributed to the Apostles, it is decreed that a
Bishop should be ordained of two or three Bishops: and the Greek word
is (...).

In the second of the same Canons, the ordeinyng of Priests, Deacons, and
other clearks is committed to the Bishop alone, and the greek word there is
(...) Can. 2.
likewise.

In the. 35. or. 36. of the same Canons, it plainly appears, that Bishops
were chosen Can. 35. 36.
without the consent of the people.

In the. 4. Canon of the Council of Nice, the election of Bishops is appointed
only Council Nicanu^. Can. 4 Antioch. 19.
to Bishops.

It appears plainly in the. 19. ca. Con. Anti^cheni, that only the
Metropolitan and other ministers had interest in the ordeinnig and apointing
of Bishops.

It is manifest by Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 8. and 23. that Origin was admitted and
ordained Eus. li. 6. ca. 8. 23. Hieronymus Epist. ad Nepotian. Distinct. 62.
Nulla.
minister only by Bishops.

Hierome in his Epistle ad Nepotianum, in the words before recited, signifies
that the election of Priests does p^rteyne to the Bishop.

Gratian distinct. 62. has this Canon made by Leo who was Bishop of Rome.
Nulla ratio s^it. etc. No reason permits that they should be accounted
amongst the Bishops, which are neither chosen of the Clearks, nor desired of
the people, nor consecrated of the Bishops of that province, with the judgment
and allowance of the Metropolitan. The Gloss expounding what this is to be
desired of the people, says, that it is to give testimony unto them. And no
man denies but that such as are to be admitted into the ministry, ought to
have a testimony of their life and conversation, and that it should be lawful
for any man to except against them, if there be just cause: but yet the
judgment not to rest in the people.

And distinct. 6^. there is this law, Laici nullo modo se debent ins^rere
electioni, The lay Distinct. 63. Laici.
people ought by no means to thruste themselves into the election, or to
meddle with the election. There are certain Canons collected out of the greek
Synodes by Martin Bracaren. Episco. and they are to be found to. Conci. 2. the
first of the Canons is this, the Tom. 2. Con.
which Gratian also has distinct. 63. Non licet populo. etc. It is not
lawful for the people, to make the election of them which are preferred to
priesthood: but it is in the judgment of the Bishops, that they should prove
him, which is to be ordained, whether he be instructed in the word, and in
faith, and in spiritual conversation. The same may be also proved by the 2.
and. 3. Canons following

In the same distinc. there is this Canon taken out of the. 8. general
Council. Consecrationes and promotiones. etc. This holy and general Council
agreeyng with former Councels, has decreed and enacted, that the consecrations
and promotions of Bishops should be made by the election of the Clergy, and
by the decree and College of the Bishops.

Theodoret lib. 4. cap. 5. says, that when Auxentius being an Arian, was
deprived Theod. lib. 4. cap. ^.
of the Bishoprike of Millain, Valentinian the Emperor called together the
Bishops, and willed them to place such a one in that bishoprike, as he might
safely commit himself unto. etc. and when as they desired the Emperor that he
himself would choose one whom he thought meet, the Emperor told them
again, that it were much better for them to elect one, because they were best
able to judge of his metenesse. And although the people, being divided
tumultuously requested the Bishops, some for one, some for an other, and at the
length all desired to have Ambrose, yet it may evidently appear, that the
interest of the election, was in the Bishops, and the confirmation and allowyng
of the same in the Emperor. And in that the Bishops would have committed
the whole matter to the Emperor, it may appear, that it greatly skilleth not
who do choose, so that such be chosen as be fit for the place.

In the. 63. distinct. of Gratian, it is also to be seen, that sometime the
election Distinct. 6^.
and allowing of Bishops was wholly given to the Emperor, as we may read in
the decree of Adrian the Pope there mentioned: and in the decree of Leo the
first, where he shows, how that the dissentions, heresies, and schisms that
were in the Church, was the cause why that both the election of the Romain
Bishop, and of other also was committed to the Emperor.

Whereby it is evident, thal the people have not at all times, nor in all
places had interest in the elections of ministers. I know that Gratian in the
same distinction says as much in the behalf of the people, but thereby we
may gather, that this election has been variable, and from time to time used
according to the place, time, and persons. For further proof hereof, I could
recite the variety that now is, and heretofore also has been, even in
reformed Churches, but to avoid tediousness, I refer that to every man's own
search.

This is most certain, that the form prescribed in the second Admonition,
and in this Reply of T. C. also, if it be considered, will appear to have in
it nihil Apostolicum, nothing Apostolical, but to differ as much from any
form that was then used, as this does that we retain in the Church of
England at this day, and a great deal more.

Chap. 8. the. 3. Division.
The reasons why the people have been secluded from such elections, and so

to be, are these.

1. First, the marvelous contentions that have bin in such kind of
elections, by the sinister affections of the people, being easily moved to
division and parts taking, upon every light occasion. Examples whereof there be
infinite almost in every Contention about the election of ministers.
election, as it may enidently appear to every one, that has but lightly
run over any Ecclesiastical history.

When Damasus was chosen Bishop of Rome, there was one Vrsicinus a Deacon Plat.
in vita Damasi.
set up against him, and the contention was so vehement betwixt them, and
the rage of the people so intemperate, that they fell from voices to blows, in
so much that there was many slain, even in the place of election.

What sedition was there moved in the election of Boniface the second, when
Platina.
Dioscorus contended with him for the Bishoprike, the people were so divided,
that the contention could not be ended but with the death of Dioscorus.

The like brawle was in the elections of Conon, Sergius, Paulus. 1.
Constantinus, Platina.
and almost in every election made in that seat: as it is evident in such
stories, as especially entreat of the lives of the Bishops of Rome.

The like stir there has bin in other places also, especially after that the
churches were divided with heresies and sects. At Constantinople, after the
death of Alexander their Bishop, there was a marvelous uproar for his
successor, some desiring to have Paul a Catholic, and some Macedonius an
Arrian: this contention was so vehement, that the whole city was disturbed and
many slain on both parties, yea even the Emperors officer that was sent to
appease it. Sozom. lib. 3. cap. 4. and. 7.

The strife that was in the same place, after the death of Atticus, (Philip,
Prochis, and Sisinius, striving for the Byshopricke at one time) Socrates
testifyeth lib. 7. cap. 26. Sozom. lib. 3. cap. 4. and. 7. Socrat. lib. 7. cap.

the same does he write also to have bin betwixt Philip and Prochis, after the
deprivation of Nestorius lib. 7. cap. 35.

After Endoxius removed from Antioch to Constantinople, there was in Antioch
great strife for a successor, as the same Sozo shows lib. 4. cap. 28. where
he adds these words: as in such things it comes to pass, that there are
diverse contentions and seditions betwixt the Clergy and betwixt the people.

Socrates lib. 5. cap. 9. declares the like tumultes to have bin about the
election of Flauianus: and he adds, atque ita Antiochena ecclesia denuo, non
propter fidem sed propter Episcopos scinditur. And so the Church of Antioch is
again divided, not for matters of faith, but for their Bishops.

I declared before out of Nazianzene in his funeral oration at the burial of
his father, Nazianzene
what great trouble and danger was at Cesaria in his time, about the election
of their Bishops. The same also I noted out of Augustine Epist. 110. it was the
cause why August in. tom. 2. epi. 110.
both he and his predecessor in their life times, did provide to themselves
successors, as it is there manifest.

Socrates lib. 6. cap. 11. declares what contention there was at Ephesus,
about the election Socrat. lib. 6. cap. 11.
of their Bishop, the people being divided into sundry factions, in somuche
that Chrysostom was himself enforced to appoint unto them one Heraclis his
Deacon.

The same Authoure lib. 7. cap. 7. testifyeth the like contention to have bin
in Alexandria, Socrat. lib. 7. cap. 7. Euagrius li. 2. cap. 5.
whilst some desired Timothy an Archdeacon, othersome Cyrill.

Euagrius li. 2. ca. 5. writes thus: Cum antem bic Proterius. etc. when this
Proterius was placed in the Bishops seat of Alexandria, there arose a great
and intolerable tumult among the people, which were tossed with diverse
sentences: for (as it often falls out in such cases) some would have
Dioscorus again: others stuck stoutly to Proterius, so that many incurable
mischieses were committed. For Priscus the Rhetorician writes, that the
governor of Thebes came the same time to Alexandria, and saw the people wholly
to set them selves against the magistrates, and that when the garrison of
soldiers would have kept back the sedition, they beat them back with
stones into the temple, which was in times past called the temple of Serapis:
then the people coming thither with speed, took the temple and burned the
soldiers quick. But whe^the Emperor understood hereof, he sent thither two
thousand new soldiers, who having a prosperous wind and passage, arrived the
sixth day after at the great city of Alexandria, and so raged against the wives
and daughters of the men of Alexandria, that much more mischief was now
wrought than before.

To what further inconvenience this intolerable contention came afterward,
the same Euagrius writes cap. 8. where he also describes the manners and
conditions of Euagrius li. 2. cap. 8.
the people at large, and declares how easily they are moved to contentions
and tumultuous dealing, how willingly led by any factious person that
prete^deth liberty. etc. In the end he shows how villanously and cruelly they
murdered Proterius appointed to be their Bishop.

What should I speak of that hurlyburly that was in Millains before the
election Theod. lib. 4. cap. 6. Chrysostom. lib. 3. de sacerdotio.
of Ambrose, whereof Theodo. speaks lib. 4. cap. 6.

I shall desire ye learned reader to peruse Chrysostom in the. 3. book that he
writes de sacerdotio where he speaks of this matter plentifully, and
declares ye marvelous partiality and the intolerable co^tentio^s that ye
people used, and was ye cause of, in such electio^s.

If I were disposed to heap up examples, I could fill a large volume, but
these (being almost in the best time of the Church, under Christian Princes)
manifestly declare what intolerable inconvenience ensues such elections, as
are committed to the people, especially in these matters.

2 My second reason is, that if such elections should be committed to the
people, the ^iuill Magistrate (who has the chief government of the Church,
and to whom the especial care of religion does apperteine) should not be able
to procure such reformation, nor such consent and agreement in matters of
religion, as he is, when he has himself the placing of Bishops, and such as
be the chief of the Clergy: for the people The election of ministers by the
people, an impediment to the civil magistrate in ecclesiastical matters.
(who are commonly bent to novelties, and to factions, and most ready to
receive that doctrine that seems to be contrary to the present state, and
that enelineth to liberty) would usually elect such as would feed their
humors: So that the Prince neither should have quiet government, neither could
be able to preserve the peace of the Church, nor yet to plant that religion,
that he in conscience is persuaded to be ^ncere. As for the authority of
^isalowing their elections, which you give unto him, it is but an intolerable
trouble, and besides that he shall not understand their doings: or if he does,
yet may he not deprive them of their liberty in choosing, so that you make his
authority in effect nothing. Moreover his Churches and whole kingdom should
be filled with Anabaptists, Libertines, Papists, Puritanes, and an hundredth
sects mo, or ever he were aware: for who will complain of him, whom the
people do phansi^, be he never so unmeet a person?

3 My third reason is taken out of your own book Fol. 25. where you say that
the If the people should choose, the inferioure in gifts should be judge of the
superior. Page 25. lin. 3.
Archdeacon may not be judge of the aptness and ableness of the Pastor,
because, he is inferi^re to the Pastor, both in calling and gifts: which if it
be true, then surely may not the people have any thing to do in the election of
the Pastor, being in all respects much more inferioure unto him, than the
Archdeacon is: for to have interest in electing, is to be admitted to judge of
his meetenesse and aptness, that is to be admitted.

4 It would be a cause why many Churches should be longer destitute of their
Popular elections a cause of long want of pastors, etc
Pastors than is convenient, for if an unmeet man were chosen, and an appeal
made to the next Pastors, and from them to the next Synod provincial, and
then the parishioners that will not yield, excommunicated, and after
excommunication complained of to the Prince, and then driven to a new election
and in the same peradventure as wayward as they were before: whilst I say, all
this were in doing (besides the marvelous schisms, contentions, brawlings,
and hatred, that must of necessity in the mean time be among them) two or
three years might soon be spent: for all these things cannot be in due order
well done in less time) al which time the parishes must be destitute of a
pastor, and burn with those mischiefs that I have before recited.

5 It would make the government of the Church popular, which is the worst kind
Popular election a cause of a popular government.
of government that can be. For it is true that M. Calvin says, cap. 20.
Instit. Procliuis est a regno. etc. The fall from a kingdom into a tyranny is
very ready, and the change from the government of the best, into the Factions of
a few is not much harder: but the fall from a popular state into a sedi^ion,
is of all other most easy.

6 The people (as I have said before) through affection and want of judgment
are The people easily led by affection.
easily brought by ambitious persons to give their consent to unworthy men:
they are soon moved by the request of their friends, and of such as they either
fear or love, to do anything, as may appear in sundry things committed unto
the^ of great importance: yea sometime when by oath they are bound to deal
without al affection, or parcialitie.

7 By this means they would think to have their pastor bound unto them, so
that A hindrance to the Pastor in doing his duty.
they would take it disdainefully to be reproved by him, according as his
duty would require Again the pastoure considering their good will in
preferring of him, would not so freely (...) them, nor willingly displease
them.

8 To conclude, the people are for the most part rude and ignorant, careless
also in The people unfit to be judges in such cases. Chrysostom. 2. in. (...)
such matters, and more me^te to be ruled, than to rule: For as Chrysostom
de^eth, Populus est quiddam tumultus, etc. The people is a certain thing full
of tumult and sturres, consisting and rashly compacted for the most part of
folly, oftentimes tossed with variable and contrary judgment, like to the
waves of the sea. etc.

These and a great number mo reasons may be alleged, why the people are to be
s^uded from the election of their Pastors: and yet do I not so utterly seclude
them from such elections: but that if they have any thing to object against
him that is to be ordained, they might be heard: which order is prescribed in
the book of making ministers: and that is as much as can be required.
Although I do not condemn those Churches, wherein this is safely committed
unto them: for I only speak of the present estate of this Church of England.

The reason why I do think the Bishops to be the fittest to have both the
allowing and ordeyning of such as are to be ministers, I have expressed in my
answer to the Admonition. And they are not as yet by better reasons confuted.

Of ministers having no pastoral charge, of ceremonies used in ordeining
ministers: of Apostles, Evangelists and Prophets. Tract. 4.
Of ministers admitted, a place being not void.
Chap. 1. The first Division.
The Admonition.
The seventh. Then none admitted to the ministry, but Act. 1. 25.
a place was void before hand, to which he should be called.

Answer to the Admonition. Page. 47. Sect. 1. 2.
TO prove this you cite in the margent the first of the Acts, where it is
declared how Mathias was chosen in the place of Judas, to make up the number
of the. xij. Apostles. Surely this is but a slender reason: Mathias was chosen
into the place of Judas, Ergo, no man must be admitted into the ministry,
except a place before hand be void, to the which he should be called. Every
mean sophister will laugh at the childishness of this argument.

Mathias was chosen to be an Apostle, and not to any certain cure, and
therefore this example proves nothing.

T. C. Page. 42. Sect. 4.
The reason is of greater force than you would seem to make it, for as the.
xij. place was to Mathias, so is a certain Church unto a Pastor or Minister,
and as the Apostles ordained none unto that place before it was void, so ought
not the Bishop ordeyn any until there be a Church void and destitute of a
pastor. And as the Apostles ordained not any Apostle, further than they had
testimony Act. ^. ^*
of the word of God, as it appears that S. Peter proceeds by that rule to
the election, so ought no Bishop ordeyn any to any function, which is not in
the scripture appointed. But there are by the word of God, at this time no
ordinary ministers Ecclesiastical, which be not local, and tied to one
congregation, therefore this sending abroad of ministers which have no places,
is unlawful.

Io. Whitgifte.
As their reason is far from good reason, so are your similitudes far from
proving the same: and the Logitians say, Soluitur sunilitudo, ostensa
dissimilitudine. First, there is great difference betwixt the office of an
Apostle, and the office of a Pastor, as you must needs confess. Then is there
also difference in the number: for the Apostles which were chosen of Christ
to be witnesses of his Resurrection, were twelve, and therefore the number
certain: but the number of Preachers and Pastors is not limited, but the mo the
better: Thirdly, there was one chosen in the place of Judas, that the Scripture
might be fulfilled as Peter says Act. 1. but there is no such thing in the
election of Pastors and other ministers. Moreover it was the twelfth place in
number that Mathias was chosen unto, and not any local place, such as pastors
take charge of. Wherefore except you can make a certain number, and no certain
number: a local prescript and definite cure, and a general charge without
prescription of any certain place, all one, or at the least very like: this
argument, Mathias was chosen into the place of Judas: ergo, no man must be
admitted into the ministry, except he have a Cure, must of necessity be a
very childishe and fond argument. And how often shall I tell you, that to
reason afacto ad ius, of an example to make a general rule, is a very
unskillful kind of rasoning, except there be some general rule and
commandment according to that example.

But was not Paul added to the number of the Apostles, though there were no
Some admitted to the ministry, a place being not void.
place void? Were not also Barnabas Act. 14. Epaphroditus Phil. 2. Andronicus
and Iunia, Romans 16. called Apostles? I might therefore as well reason thus,
Paul, Barnabas. etc. were called to be Apostles when there was no place void,
Ergo some may be called to the preaching of the Gospel, though they have no
certain cure. But let us see how you will justify this assertion, that there
are no ordinary ministers ecclesiastical, which be not local, and tied to
one congregation. etc. For I utterly deny it, in that sense that you speak it.

And that it may the better appear, that those functions do only remain,
which are appointed to one certain place, and that the Reader may have the
clearer and playner understanding of all this matter, all the whole
ecclesiastical function may be well divided: first into extraordinary, or
those that endured for a time, and into ordinary, which are perpetual. Of
the first sort are the Apostles, and Evangelists, which the Lord used for
a time, as it were, for chief Masons, and principal buylders of his Church,
as well to lay the foundations of Churches where none were^ as also to
advance them to such forwardness and height, until there might be gotten,
for the finishing of the buylding and house of the Church, fit pastors,
Elders, and Deacons. And that being done, they went from those places into
others, which thing may be perceived by the continual story of the Acts of
the Apostles, and by diverse sentences which are found in the Epistles of S.
Paul. And therefore also when the Churches have bin by Antichrist even rased
from the foundations, God has stirred up Evangelists, even immediately by his
spirit, without any calling of men, to restore his Churches again: of which
sort was Master Wickli^e in our Country, M. Hus, and Hierome of Prage in
Bohemia, Luther and Zuinglius in Germany. etc. And after this sort God may at
his good pleasure work, when he purposes to set in his Gospel in any nation,
where the whole face of the earth is covered with the darkness of ignorance,
and want of the knowledge of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
Although you can not warrant by the Scriptures this distinction of ordinary
and In what respect the Apostolical function was extraordinary.
extraordinary ecclesiastical functions, yet I think the Apostolical
function was extraordinary, in respect that it had for the time certain
especial properties, as to bear witness of the resurrection of Christ, and
of his assention, which they did see with their eyes: also to plant and to
found Churches: Likewise to go throughout the whole world. These I say were
temporal and extraordinary, and so was the Apostleship in this respect, but
yet ordinary in respect of their chief function, which was to preach the
Gospel, and to govern the Churches which they had planted. Likewise
Evangelists have an ordinary function, neither is there any cause why it
should be called a temporal office, but only in respect of writing the
Gospel, for there is none that thinks the office of preaching to be either
extraordinary or temporal.

But I pray you let me ask you one question, why should not the office of
Seniors be as well extraordinary and temporal, as the office of an Apostle, or
an Evangelist? for as you say: that the Apostleship and Euangelistship
remained, until there might be gotten for the finishing of the buylding and
house of the Church fytte Pastors. etc. So say I, that the office of Seniors
and Elders might remain in the Church, until there were christian Princes
and Magistrates, by whom the people of God might be kept in peace and
quietness, and the Churches of Christ more perfectly governed. And well assured
I am, that there are as good reasons for this, as there are for the other. For
as in the place of the Apostles, Evangelists. etc. are succeeded Bishops,
Pastors, Doctors: so I may say, that in the place of Elders and Seniors, are
come Christian Princes and Magistrates.

As for this part of the Apostles function, to visit such Churches as were
before planted, and to provide that such were placed in them, as were virtuous
and godly Pastors: I know it remains still, and is one of the chief parts
of What part of the Apostles function remains.
the Bishops function, as shall hereafter more at large appear.

I grant that Master Hus, Hierome of Prage, etc. were stirred up even by God,
to preach his truth, and open the door of his word again, yet were they
called to some function of the Church before, although that function were for
the most part, wicked, and the Church almost wholly corrupted with
superstition and errors: But why you should rather call them Evangelists,
than Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, or Doctors, I know not: especially seeing
some of them had ordinary charges.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 43. Sect. 1.
Of this sort of extraordinary functions, are the Prophets also, which
besides a singular dexterity, and readiness of expounding the Scriptures, had
also the gift of telling things to come, which, because it is not now
ordinarily, I think there is none will deny, but it is an extraordinary
calling, for the other two of the Apostles and Evangelists, it shall appear
more at large hereafter (by occasion given by M. Doctor) that they are but for
a time.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you mean Prophets, in the respect of the gift of telling things to
come, Act. 11.
such as Agabus was, then be they temporal, but yet ordinary for the time
wherein Prophets in some respect ordinary.
they were: But if you mean Prophets in respect of their dexterity and
readiness in expounding the Scriptures, such as Barnabas was, and Simon,
Lucius, Act. 13.
etc. and Saul. Likewise such as Judas and Silas. Acts. 15. and such as the
Apostle Act. 15.
S. Paul speaks of. 1. Corinthians. 14. I see no cause why either the calling 1.
Cor. 14.
should be extraordinary, or the ^ffice and gift temporal, except you have a
liberty to make temporal and perpetual, ordinary and extraordinary, what
you please. But seeing you would have all things proved by Scripture, I pray
you prove this that you have said, either of the Apos^les, Euangelis^s, or
Prophets by the Scripture, seeing you teach that of them, which seems to be
contrary unto the Scripture.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.
T. C. Page 43. Sect 2.
The ordinary and continual functions of the Church are also divided into
two parts, for either they are they that govern or take charge of the whole
Church, as are those, which are called Elders, or they which take charge of
one part of the Church (which is the poor of every Church) as are those
which are called Deacons. Those again that be called Presbyteri, which we
term Elders of the Church, and have to do with the whole Church, are
either those, which teach and preach the word of God, and govern too, or
else which govern only, and do not teach or preach. Of the first kind are
Pastors, and Doctors. Or the second are those, which are called by the common
name of Elders, or auncientes. Of all this ordinary function I shall have
occasion to speak, and of every one shall appear that (which I have said
before) that they are no uncertain and vndefinite ministeries, but such as
are limited unto a certain Church and congregation. And first of all, for
the Pastor or Bishop, which is here mentioned, which name soever we consider
of them, they do forthwith, as soon as they are once either spoken, or
thought of, imply and infer a certain and definite ch^rge, being as the
Logitians term them, actual relatiues. For what shepherd can there be,
unless he have a flock? and how can he be a watcheman, unless he have some
city to look unto? Or how can a man be a master, unless he have a servant?
or a father unless he have a child? Now if you will say that they have a
charge, and they have flocks, and cities to attend and watch upon, for a
whole shire, or province, or realm, are their flocks, and their Cities, and
their charges.

Io. Whitgifte.
This division also is of your own inuenting: neither have you any mention of
Seniors, (as you call them) or of Deacons in that fourth Chapter to the Ephesi.
which you would have to be so perfect a rule of ecclesiastical functions. As
for Pastors and Doctors, you know that diverse both ancient and late writers,
as namely Hierome, Augustine, Chrysostom, Musculus, and Bucer, etc. do
confound them, and the reason that Hieroine uses can not be well denied,
because the Apostle says not as he did before of the other: alios Pastores,
alios Doctores, some Pastors, Ephesians. 4.
and other some Doctors, but he joins them together, and says: alios
Pastores and Doctores, some Pastors and Doctors. M^reouer I see not how you
can justify your division of Seniors by the word of God, as I shall further
declare in that place, where Tract. 17.
you more largely speak of them: In the mean time, I see no reason why your
unpreaching and vnministring Seniors, should have any perpetuity in the
Church, more than Apostles, for the cause that I have before alleged:
neither have you yet proved, that the Deacons office is only to provide for
the poor: you have examples to the contrary, as I have declared in my
Answer. To be short, I understand not how you can make Doctors, governors
of any several parishes and Churches, except you will make them Pastors.

But because you only speak here, and prove nothing, I will differ a
further answer, vnti^l I hear more sound arguments.

You say, a shepherd can not be, unless he have a flock. etc. all which is
true: but he is also a shepherd that has mo flocks, and he is a shepherd,
that has a general care and oversight of many shepherds, and many flocks.
For he that has many flocks, and many shepherds, may have one master
shepherd to see that all the rest do their duties, and that the sheep be
kept in good order. And though every several City have several watchemen
which watch by course, yet may there be one that has an especial care
over all, and is appointed to see the rest do their duties: So one master may
have many servants, one father many children. Wherefore if you use this
reason to improve the office of a Bishop, it lacks might: if to prove that a
Pastor must have a flock, no man does deny it: but if to conclude, that no
man may preach, unless he have a certain flock, there is no sequel at all
in it: for first you must prove that the only office of a Pastor is now
remaining in the Church, and that no man can be minister of the words and
Sacraments, except he be a Pastor of some certain flock, for that do I
constantly deny.

First of all in your reading ministers that is untrue, for they go not to
^eade in all Churches, but ^arrie till they be hired in one. And therefore when
the Bishop has laid his hand of Petitio principij.
them* they are no more Ministers, than before his hand came upon them,
because they have no charges, and therefore the patron or person that hireth
them to read, and sets them a work are their Bishops, and make them
ministers, and not the Bishop of the Diocese.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words grounded upon this false principle, that none oug^te to be
admitted into the ministry, but such as have a certain cure and charge,
which you are never able to prove, either by Scripture or good reason: but the
contrary is manifest by both.

Chapter. 1. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page 43. Sect. 4.
Secondarily, for those that preach to have a whole Diocese, or Province, or
Realm to be their flock, or City to attend upon, is contrary to the
policy or good husbandry of all those that would either have their City
safe, or their flocks sound. For who are they, which would appoynte one for
the watch of a thousand towns or cities, when as all they, which love their
safety, would rather have for every city many watchemen, than for many
cities one? Or what is he, that is so watchefull and circumspecte, whose
diligence and watchefulnesse, one city assaulted with enemies, will not wholly
occupy and take up? Or what is he, whose sight is so sharp, that he can see
from one end of the Diocese, or Province, or realm, to the other end
thereof? Or what is he, that will commit the keeping of twenty thousand
sheep to one man, that looks for any good or increase of them? How shall
all these hear his whistle, how shall all know his voice, when they can not
hear it? How shall they acknowledge him, when they can not know him? how
shall they follow him, when they can not see him go before? how shall he
heal their diseases, when he can not possibly know them? But some man will
say, that these are human reasons, and likelyhoodes, which may be
overthrown with other similitudes: These notwithstanding are Analogies drawn
from the nature of those things, which the Ministers are likened unto, and are
of the most part used of the holy Ghost him self expressly.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is a great point of good husbandry and policy also, to have, besides
the several shepheardes over several flocks, and sundry watchemen over
sundry Cities, diverse other to feed the sheep, as occasion serves, and to
admonish the watchemen and the Cities of their duties: else why did the
Apostles after they had planted the Churches, and placed Shepheardes and
watchemen over them, so diligently afterward vysite them, and so carefullye
look unto them, as we read Acts. 14. 15. 18? Was the watch think you the
worse kept, or the sheep the negligentlyer looked unto? The policy that
Darius used Daniel. 6. when he appointed a hundredth and twenty governors over
all his Realm, and over them three to ouersee them, and take an account of
their doings, is greatly commended: and why may not this policy be
necessary in the Ecclesiastical state also? But you here run smothely away
with the matter, and suppose that there may not be for several Cities, and
several flocks, several watchemen and shepheardes, because there be some
that have a general care over many flocks and Cities. If a thousand Towns
or Cities have a thousand watchemen appointed unto them, to have the
particular care over them, and also one, two, or more to have a general care
both over the watchemen, and over the Cities also, do you not think that all
shall be in better order, and in much more safety?

But your similitudes fail maruellously in sundry points, which I must
Similitudes are but weak arguments.
admonish you of, because you glory so much in them, and think that you
have reasoned strongly, when you have used the weakest kind of argument that
can be, to prove any thing: for as the Logitians say, Similitudo rem
illustrat, sed non probat: A similitude makes a matter plain, but proves it
not. And it is easily overthrown by showing the vnlikelyhoode: In this the
similitude agrees, that as every City must have a watcheman, and every
flock a shephearde, so every Church or Parish must have a watcheman or a
Pastor: and as the watchman and shephearde his office is to watch and to
feed, and to have a necessary care over their charges, so must also the
Spiritual watcheman and shephearde have a care over the people committed unto
them. All this is true, and neither proves nor improueth any thing that is in
question. I might as well say, that if the City be well watched, and the
flock carefully looked unto, though it be not by the watcheman or shephearde
him self, but by his means and procurement, there can be no just fault
found with either of them. Likewise, that when the shephearde has brought
his sheep into a pasture where they may both be sure from all danger, and
have meat sufficient, then his presence is not so necessary for them, so that
he do sometimes visit them. Also that there is no one watcheman, that either
does or can watch continually, but must of necessity have his rest, so
that some other supply his absence: and likewise, that there is no master
shephearde, but that he has some under him, either boy, or man, to supply
his absence whylest he is about other matters. To be short, that one
shephearde has care over sundry men's sheep, sundry flocks of sundry
Towns and Parishes, etc. Diverse other such similitudes of shepheardes and
watchemen might I also use, to prove many things contrary to your meaning. I
might also show unto you the dissimilitude betwixt a temporal shephearde.
and a spiritual shephearde: unreasonable sheep that can not feed them
selves, or by any means provide for them selves, nor have any charge so look
to them selves, and reasonable sheep, such as God has endued with
knowledge, to whom he has left his word, which conteyneth in it
suffyciente to salvation, whom he has charged to read it, and to hear it:
who shall also answer for them selves. etc. Finally* what difference there is
betwixt temporal meat and drink, which is soon digested, and therefore
daily to be renewed: and spiritual food which continues, and whereof he
that has once sufficiently tasted, shall not hunger or thirst. etc. These I
say, and a great number of other dissimilitudes could I bring, to overthrow
all that you can build upon these similitudes.

I might further say, that in the Prophets, and other places of the
Scriptures, Kings and mighty Princes that have ample and large Dominions, be
called Ierem. (...).
both shepheardes and watchemen, as namely in Jeremy. 2^. Ezechiell. 34. etc.
and Ezech. 34.
therefore all those your reasons might as well be alleged against them, and
of them also might you say, What is he, whose sight is so sharp, that he
can see from one end of the Diocese, Province, or Realm, to another? For
these names be as common, and as usual to Kings and Princes, as they be to
Ministers of the word and Bishops. And truly if these similitudes sink once
into the peoples heads, and be applied unto civil government, (against
which they be as forceable, as against the ecclesiastical) they will as
easily, and far more easily stir them up, to seek alteration in that also.

Chap. 1. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page 43. Sect. 4. 5.
But that there be no controversy left in this point, what is No man douteth
what a flock is, and yet you have invented a strange definition.
a flock? S. Paul defines it plainly, when he says: appoint Pastors, or
Elders, or Bishops (for these words are indifferently used) through, not
every Shire, or Province, or Realm, but through every City, or Town. And
least that any man should here take occasion to conclude, that then it is
lawful for one man to be Bishop or Pastor of a whole City, such as
London, or York. etc.

S. Luke in the Acts does declare the meaning of this place, where he says
that they appointed Elders throughout every congregation, so that if the City
or Town be great, and the professors of the Gospel in it, be more than will
make conveniently a congregation, then there must be, by the rule of God You
have no word of God for this, and the practice of the primitive Church does
confute it, as it is proved Tract. 8.
more Pastors and Bishops. Whereupon it appears that both no Pastor or
Bishop ought to be made without there be a flock, as it were a void place
for him, and that a flock is not a Realm, or Province, or Diocese (as we now
call a Diocese) but so many as may conveniently meet in one assembly or
congregation. And that this is the meaning of Saint Paul, it appears by the
practice of the Churches from time to time, which have both decreed against,
and found fault with these wandering and rouyng ministeries.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is manifest that S. Paul willed Titus to appoynte presbyteros (for that
Tit. 1.
word he uses) in every City, for so does he also say. But what can you
hereof conclude? What sequel is there in this argument: Saint Paul willed
Timothy to appoint Ministers in every City, Ergo, there must be none
admitted to the ministry of the word, but such as have some certain cure?
or therefore one man may not have the ouersighte and direction of many cures?
In deed if S. Paul had said to Titus, thou shalt appoynte no Ministers of
the word, or Seniors, but to a certain cure, or admit none to preach the
Gospel, except he have some one place certainly appointed unto him: then your
reason had bin something. But now it has no show of any argument.

The place Act. 14. tends to the same purpose, neither is there one word
there to prove that such may not preach the word, as have no certain
charge committed unto them: but the contrary rather: for Paul and Barnabas,
though they did appoynte in every Church Ministers, yet did they preach
themselves also. And I hear no reason yet, why both these may not be true,
that every Church should have a Pastor, and yet that some may be admitted to
preach the word, that have no several churches. This I am sure was usual in
the Apostles time, and it is now most profitable, neither is there one title
in the whole scripture against it. And you your self have bin in that case
ever since you were preacher, and remain so still for any thing that I know.

Chap. 1. the. 8. Division.

The great Council of Calcedon decreed that no Eider or Deacon, or any other
in the ecclesiastical Cap. 6. act. 1^.
order should be ordained (...): that is, losely, and as it were let go at
randon whither he himself ^sted, which he also interprets by and by more
plainly, when he adds, The Council of Calcedon maimed.
that he should not be ordained (...): that is, unless it be specially in a
congregation of some city or town. And in the Council of Urban (as Gratian
reports, distinction. 70.) it was decreed that the ordination, that was made
without any title, should be void, and what that means, is showed by and
by, when it is said, and in what Church any is entitled, there let him always
remain. And this is also You still stum ble upon Hierome in stead of Musculus.
S. Hierome his Ad Nepoti*
complaynt, in that men were ordained unto the ministry, when they were
chosen by no Church, and so went round about, having no certain place. And
therefore this, that none ought to preach, unless he have some pastoral
charge, ought not to have been so strange a thing unto you, as you make it,
if either the Scriptures, or the Councels, or the ancient Fathers, had been
so well known unto you, as either your name requires, or you take upon you,
which dare so boldly pronounce, that there can be showed no text of
Scripture for the matter.

Io. Whitgifte.
You are notable in falsifying and coruptly alleging of the authorities of
Fathers and Councels, and a singular grace you have, both in ascribing that
unto them, which they have not, and in otherwise reporting that which they
have: as you do now in this place deal with the Council of Calcedon: for
you say, that Council decreed that no Elder or Deacon. etc. should be
ordained (...): that is losely. etc. And you add, that he interprets this
more plainly, when he adds that he should not be ordained (...): that is,
unless it be specially in a congregation of some city or town. But you have
craftily left out that which makes against you, and plainly opens the
meaning of the Council, which is this, (...). etc.

The whole Canon is this, Nullum absolute ordinari debere presbyterum aut
Diaconum, ec quemlibet in gradu ecclesiastico, nisi specialiter in ecclesia
ciuitatis aut pagi, aut in martyrio, aut monasterio, qui ordinandus est,
pronuncietur. Qui vero absolute ordinantur* decreuit Sancta synodus, Con.
Cbalced* cap. 6. act. 15*
irritam haberi ^uiusmodi manus impositionem, and nusquam posse ministrare ad
ordinantis ignominiam. Whereby it is plain, that the meaning of the Council is
to have none admitted into any Ecclesiastical degree, except he have some
thing to live upon, and not that he must of necessity have some cure: for then
would not the council have said aut in martyrio, aut monasterio, for these be
no pastoral charges: neither yet would it have added aut Diaconum aut
quemlibet in gradu ecclesiastico, Deacons or any other in ecclesiastical
degree: because every one admitted in aliquem gradum ecclesiasticum, into any
ecclesiastical degree, is not admitted to a cure. Wherefore the gloss in
Gratian does well interpret the meaning of this Canon, when it says that nonc
is to be ordained sine titulo, Did. 70. (...).
without a title, ne dicatur, mendicat in plateis infoelix clerious: least it
be said, an unhappy clerk beggeth in the streates: and further adds thus,
colligitur etiam bic, ex eo quod dicit, sieve possessionis, argumentum, quod si
quis habet patrimonium sufficiens ordinari potest sine titulo: an argument may
also here be gathered, in that it says (or of possession) that if any have
sufficient patrimony, he may be ordained without a title. But these words,
sieve in martyrio sieve in monasterio, do manifestly declare that the Council
would have none admitted to any Ecclesiastical function without some stay of
living, either of some benefice, Monastery, College, Chapel, his own
possessions, or such like: as the practice of the Church under the Pope is at
this day. And yet if any man should say, that out o this Canon there can be
nothing gathered, but only this, in what places those that are called to the
ministry are to be admitted and ordained, I know not how you could answer
it, for the words of the Canon admit that sense most properly.

That decree of Urban has the same meaning, and that which follows, of
remaining continually in that Church, in the which he is entitled, does but
signify that he must be assured of his living, whereunto he is entitled during
his life: for the same Canon does permit one man to have two Churches, but yet
that he ought not to be canonicus prebendarius, but only of one Church whereof
he is entitled. But I can not but marvel that you will use the testimony of
this Council of Pope Urban, which was holden at the least an. 1090. after
Christ, even in the most corrupt time, when as Antichrist had fully possessed
the sea of Rome, in the which Council among other things Volater* and Bale.
he confirmed the acts of Pope Hildebrand against Henry the Emperor. This
Urban also was the confirmer of the superstitious orders of the Platina: in
vita Vrb. 2.
Cistercian friars, and Volateran: and Cent. II. ca. 10.
Carthusian Monks, he likewise deposed Distinct. 32 eos qui.
Deacons that were married, from their orders: And Matthew. p^ risi. in vita
VVilli. 2.
forbad (by the Council of the traitorous Archbishop Anselme) that any Clearke
should receive beneficiorum inuestituram, or any Ecclesiastical dignity, of
any Prince or lay man, but Cent. 4.
only of the Pope. And that you may yet further understand what a worthy
patron you have gotten for your cause, this Urban was he that was author
P^lid. de invent. lib. 6. cap. 2.
of the Canonical hours, commonly called our Ladies Psalter.

Certainly Hierome says no such thing in that Epistle, you are disposed to
father that of him that he never spoke* His complaint was that much cost was
bestowed upon Churches in adorning and decking of them, and little regard to
the choice of Ministers, meaning that they had more care to have gorgious
Churches than good Ministers. But what is this to your purpose?

Thus have you proved neither by Scripture, nor by Council, nor Doctor (truly
alleged and understood) that none may preach, unless he have some
pastoral charge, and I still affirm that you have not one text of Scripture
soundyng that way, where there are to the contrary sundry examples, as I have
alleged.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 77. Sect. 2.
If you had used more reasons, I would have answered them, what certain cure
had Paul, Barnabas, Philip, Epaphroditus, Andronicus, Iunius, and yet they
were not of the twelve Apostles? It is a strange doctrine to teach that a man
may not preach out of his own cure: It is more strange to say, that it is
not lawful for him to preach, except he have some pastoral cure, being of
him self able to live, and not minding to be burdensome to the Church? If you
seek for any text in the scripture to confirm this doctrine, you can find
none: if you seek for examples to the contrary, you shall find plenty.

T. C. Page 44. Sect. 2. 3. 4.
But you ask what place Paul and Barnabas had appointed them. What mean you
thereby to conclude, that because Paul and Barnabas the Apostles had no place
appointed them, therefore a Pastor or Bishop should not? when this is one
difference between the Apostle and Bishop, that the one has no certain place
appointed, and the other has. But I think I smell out your meaning, which is,
that we may make Apostles also at these days, and that that function is not
yet ceased, for otherwise your reason is nothing worth. Likewise also you ask
of Philip, which was an Evangelist. And so you think that these running
Ministers are lawful, because they are Apostles and Evangelists, against
which I shall have occasion to speak shortly after in the. 50. Page. But if a man be able to live of him self, and mind not to be burdensome to the
Church, it seems unreasonable unto you, that he may not go about and
preach throughout all Churches.

Did you never read any learned disputation, and that of learned writers in
our days about P. Marty^ upon the 1. Cor. 9. thinks it more expedient for
one to take wages of the Church although he be able to live of him self.
this question: whether (although it be lawful) it be expedient that a man
being able and willing to live of him self, ought to take wages of the
Church, for inconveniences which might ensue of taking nothing? I do but
ask you the question, because you make so great a wonder at this, for I will
not take upon me here the defense of it, because I will not multiple questions.

And why I pray you may not that manne that is so able, and will be content
to live of him self, why I say may not he teach and be the Pastor of some
Church? Do you think that for his forbearing the wages of the Church, he
may break the What laws and orders, where are they establi shed.
laws and orders that God has established?

Io. Whitgifte.
It is a good reason to prove that there may be preachers of the word, which
have no certain cure, and does clean overthrow your former answer to the
place Acto. 1. for Paul and Barnabas were not chosen into any vacant place as
Matthias was, and therefore that reason is no reason. I do not say a Bishop or
Pastor should not have a place appointed unto them (for I know Bishops and
Pastors have their cures limited) but this I say, that some may be preachers
and Ministers of the word, which have no certain cure. Neither is this true
that all such as be admitted to the preaching of the word, be either Bishops
or Pastors.

Against Apostles and Evangelists we shall understand what you have to say,
when we come to that place.

You ask me whether I ever read any learned disputations. etc. I might ask
you the same question, for you utter no great reading here, only you allege
Peter Martyr upon. 1. Cor. 9. where he speaks little of this matter. For the
question is not whether a man having a Pastoral cure, and sufficient of his
own to live, may cease to take the ordinary stipend of his Church or no,
which is that, that Peter Martyr handles in that place, and whereof he makes
this resolution, that he should do that therein, that may most profitte the
Church, and further the Gospel, and yet to be most expedient to take the
accustomed stipend, although S. Ambrose Lib. 1. off. cap. 36. and diverse other
be of the contrary judgment. But this is our controversy, whether a man
having sufficient to live of by him self, may not be admitted to the preaching
of the Gospel, except he have some Pastoral cure. S. Paul in that Chapter
gloryeth that he took nothing of the Corinthians, and Peter Martyr in the same
place says that Paul would take nothing P. Martyr in 1. Cor. 9.
that he might the more freely reprehend.

You ask me also why that man, that is so able, and will be content, may not
teach, and be the Pastor of a Church. etc. I answer, that he may and if he
will. But I ask you again, what if he be persuaded that he shall do more
good, by going to such places, where there is greater want of preaching? What
law or order is there established by God to the contrary? where is that law
or that order? Set it truly down, and I yield unto it: else can I not but
dissent from you, seeing I see manifest examples in the Scripture to the
contrary: and eue^ your own example, also in your own person, which ought to
have moved you to a public confession, if you have all this while usurped an
unlawful vocation: as certainly you have done, if this your assertion be true.

That the ordering of Ministers does apperteine to Bishops properly, Ordering
of ministers pertains to Bishops.
which you here utterly deny, I have proved before: they be best able to
judge of men's ability to that function. It is their especial charge to see
that there be meet Ministers in the Church, and therefore good reason that
they should have the chief stroke in ordering of them: and yet in that
business they trust not themselves alone, they have other godly and learned
ministers to assist them in examining such as are to be admitted: they also
require a testimonial of life and conversation from that place, wherein those
that are to be Ministecs have been latest and longest remaining.

Page. 48. Sect. 1. 2.
If such numbers as you say be admitted at one time, and sent abroad like
maisterlesse men, that is the fault of the person, not of the law: neither is
it a sufficient cause to debar any learned, godly and meet man from the
ministry, able to live of him self, or having any other Ecclesiastical
living, as prebend, fellowship in some college of either university, or such
like, though he have no Pastoral charge and cure, neither shall you ever be
able to prove, but that a man disposed and able to do good in the Church of
Christ, may be admitted into the ministry, although he have no
ecclesiastical living at all.

I mislike runnagates and masterlesse men, and such as are compelled to seek up
and down to get them services as well as you: and I hope the redress thereof
is already determined.

Now if you would know what is here meant by seniors, you may learn if you
please of Oecumenius a learned and old writer, who expounds this place of
Timothy on this sort, (...). By seniors he means Bishops: and so says
Chrysostom inlike manner.

not thereby to severe th^se that had the government of the Church together
with the pastor and minister of the word, which were called ancients, as you
seem to mean: but to put distinction between those which are Elders by age,
and Elders by office, besides that it is before alleged that it may be, that
the pastor or Bishop did in the name of all the Elders lay on his hands upon
him that was ordained. And lastly, you know, and can not deny, that S. Paul
in one or two places confounds the Bishop and the Elder.

Io Whitgifte.
The words of Chrysostom, and of Oecumenius be evident, as you might have
perceived, if you would have taken pains to read the places. For the words
of Chrysostom be these: (...): He Chrysostom. in 1. Tim. 4.
speaks not here of Elders, but of Bishops, (...): for certaynely the Elders
did not ordeyne the Bishop. How say you, be not these words plain, that he
means Bishops, and not other Ministers? And M. Beza in Beza.
his notes upon this place says thus: Presbyterij. 1. ordinis presbyterorum,

In the book now allowed of making Deacons and ministers, and consecrating of

The Admonition.
Beside that ridiculous, and (as they use it to their new creatures)
blasphemous saying, receive the holy Ghost.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 49. Sect. 4. and vlt.
To use these words (receive the holy Ghost) in ordering of Ministers, which
Christ him self used in appoynting his Apostles, is no more ridiculous and
blasphemous, than it is to use the words, that he used in the Supper: But it
is blasphemy thus outrageously to speak of the words of Christ. The Bishop
by speaking these words does not take upon him to give the holy Ghost, no more
than he does to remitte sins, when he pronounces the remission of sins:
but by speaking these words of Christ, receive the holy Ghost, whose sins
so ever ye remitte, they are remitted* etc. he does show the principal
duty of a Minister, and assures him of the assistance of Gods holy spirit,
if he labor in the same accordinglye.

You call them his new creatures, these be but words of s^urrilitie, to be
hissed at, not to be answered.

T. C. Page 44. Sect. vlt.
To say that the Bishop may as well say (receive the holy ghost) as to say the
words used in the Supper, or to say that the sins of those, which do believe
are forgiven, is (...), as far as York and London. For there are
commandments to the Ministers to do that, which they do, and here is
none: and there the Minister does not command that the bread be the body of
Christ, but he says that it is. Neither does he command that sins should
be forgiven, but pronounces in the behalf of God, that they are forgiven. It
is not lawful also, that he with the congregation should make a prayer for the
assistance or increase of God his gifts upon him, that is ordained, but to
command that he should receive it, is merely unlawful. For these words
(receive the holy ghost) are the imperative mode, and do expressly signify a
commandment. And so the Bishop may as well say to the sea when it rages and
^elleth, peace, be quiet, as to say receive the holy Ghost. And if you think
it so good reason to use this in the making of ministers, because you use the
words of our Savior Christ, why may not you as well blow upon them as he did?
For seeing that our savior Christ confirmed his word there with a Sacrament, or
outward sign, and you think you must therefore do it, because he did it, you
are much to blame to leave out the outward sign, or Sacrament of breath,
whereby the faith of him that is ordained, might be the more assured of such
gifts and graces, as are requisite in his function. I heap not up here the
judgment of writers, you know, I think, it might easily be done, if I liked
to follow that way.

Io. Whitgifte.
Christ used these words (this is my body) in the celebration of his Supper,
but there is no special commandment that the Minister should* use the same,
and yet must he use them, because Christ used them: even so, when Christ did
ordeine his Apostles Ministers of the Gospel Io. 20. he said unto them*
receive the holy G^ost. etc. which words because they contain the principal
duty of a Minister, and do signify that God does pour his spirit upon those
whom he calls to that function, are most aptly also used of the Bishop (who
is Gods instrument in that business) in the ordeyning of Ministers. S. Paul
speaking to Timothy. 1. Tim. 4. says, Neglecte 1. Tim. 4.
not the gift that is in thee, which was given unto thee by prophecy, with
the laying on of the hands of the eldership. In which words the Apostle
signifies, that God does bestow his gifts and spirit upon such as be
called to the ministry of the word, whereof imposition of hands is a token,
or rather a confirmation: and therefore says M. Calvin, that it was not a
vain ceremony, because God did fulfill with his Call. 1. Tim. 4.
spirit that consecration, which men did signify by imposition of hands. And
surely as that is no vain ceremony, though it be done by men, so these be no
vain words, though they be spoken by men.

Neither does the Bishop speak them as though he had authority to give the
holy Ghost, but he speaks them as the words of Christ used in the like
action, who (as I said before) does most certainly give his holy spirit to
those whom he calls to the ministry. And surely if any pattern either in
calling or ordeyning of ministers is to be followed, this of Christ is to be
followed especially: and it is not unlike but that the Apostles when they laid
on their hands used the same words, because (as I have said) laying on of
hands is a sign, or rather a confirmation of the same. That which you speak
of commanding, is a mere cavil, you know in your conscience that there is
nothing less meant.

To recite the words of Christ in the name of Christ, in the self same manner
that Christ did speak them, is as lawful in this action, as it is in the
Supper, for the bread is not the ministers body, but the sacrament of Christ
his body, and yet he says, Take and eat, this is my body: So in reciting Gods
commandments we say, Thou shall have no other Gods but me: and yet we mean
not that we are their Gods, but we speak the words of God in his person, and
in the self same manner and form, that he has left them unto us. But it is
now no maruayle though such as wyckedly forsake their calling, do also
impiously deride and jest at the manner and form thereof.

Christ when he said to the sea, peace, be quiet, showed a miracle to confirm
his divinity: but when he said, Receive the holy Ghost. etc. he did institute
a ministry, which should be used by man: and therefore there is no
similitude betwixt these two. Christ when he breathed upon them, did an action
proper unto him self, for he thereby signified that he had authority to give
unto them his holy spirit, and that the same spirit did not only proceed
from the father, but from him self also: when he spoke these words, he made a
perpetual promise, that all such should receive his spirit, as from time to
time were by him called to the office of the ministry.

I think you would surely use some authority of writers here, as you do in
other places, if you had any: but I suppose you have not one that misliketh
this form, as it is used in this Church of England. I know they do justly
condemn the foolish imitation of the Papists, who follow Christ in
breathing: But that there is any great misliking of these words, Receive the
holy Ghost (except only when they speak of the papisticall abusing of them) I
can not perceive.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 50. Sect. 2.
To prove this you allege the. 20. of the Acts, the. 4. to the Ephe. the first
to Titus, the. 5. chapter of the. 1. of Peter: which places declare that there
were Pastors which had flocks: but they prove not that every Pastor had a
flock: nevertheless how so ever you prove it, true it is that if he be a
Pastor, he must have a certain flock, for therein does a Pastor differ from the
rest of the degrees of ministers in Christ's Church, mentioned in the fourth
chapter to the Ephesians. But you must learn, that there be not only Pastors in
the Church, but also Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Doctors, Ephesians. 4. 1.
Cor. 12. who all are called ministers, and have their place in the Church of
Christ, as it shall be proved if you deny it.

T. C. Page 45. Sect. 1.
This passes all the divinity that ever I read, that there are now
Apostles, and Evangelists, and Prophets. You shall assuredly do maruels, if
you prove that, as you say you will, if any deny it: I deny it, prove you it.

Io. Whitgifte. Apostles.

Then have you not read much divinity: for if it be true that the Apostle
Saint Paul in the fourth to the Ephesians does make a perfect platform of
a Church, and a full rehersall of the offices therein contained (as you say he
does) then can I not understand how you can make those offices rather
temporal, than the office of the Pastors and Doctors. And forasmuch as you so
greatly contemn authority, and would have all things proved by Scripture,
let me hear one word of the same, that does but insinuate these offices
to be temporal. The place it self seems to importe a continuance of these
functions, until the coming of Ephesians. 4.
Christ. For he says: He therefore gave some to be Apostles, and some
Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the
gatheryng together of the Saints, for the work of the ministry. etc.
until we all meet together in the unity of faith and knowledge of the
son of God unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the age and fullness
of Christ. etc. I am persuaded that you can not show any like place, which
does so plainly importe the abrogatyng of them, as this 1. Cor. 12. and. 14.
does make for their continuance. I have beside that place to the Ephesians,
the twelfth of the first to the Corinth. and the. 14. where he speaks of
Prophets, as of perpetual ministers in the Church of Christ.

I know that there were certain things in the Apostles, which were proper
unto themselves, as their calling, which was immediately from God, their
commission to go into the whole world, the power of woorkyng miracles, to be
witnesses of the Resurrection and of the Ascension. etc. but to preach the
word of God in places where need requires, (though the same be not
peculiarly committed to them) or to govern Churches already planted, I see no
cause why it should not be perpetual. Evangelists.


Likewise the office of the Evangelist, if it be taken for the writing of the
gospel, then it is ceased. But if it be taken for preaching to the people
plainly and simply, as Bull. in. 4. ad Ephesians.
Bullinger thinks: or generally, for preaching the gospel: as Musc. Tit. de
ver minist. in locis com.
Musculus supposes, in which sense also Paul said to Timothy. 2. Timo. 4.
do the work of an Evangelist: Or for preaching more fervently and zealously
than other, as Bucer in. 4. Ephesians.
Bucer says: then I see no cause at all why it may not still remain in the
Church.

Moreover Prophets, if they be taken for such as have the gift of
foreshewyng things to come, then be they not in all times of the Church: but
if they be Prophets, 1. Cor. 14.
such as Saint Paul speaks of. 1. Corin. 14. such (I say) as have an
especial gift in interpretyng the Scriptures, whether it be in expoundyng
the mysteries thereof to the learned, or in declaryng the true sense thereof to
the people: I understand not why it is not as perpetual as the Pastor or
Doctor.

Thus you see that I have both Scripture and reason on my side: and to the
end you may perceive that I am not destitute of the consent also of learned
Ambrose.
men in this matter, I will set down the opinions of one or two. Ambrose
upon these words Ad Ephesians. 4. Et ipse dedit quosdam quidem Apostolos. etc.
says thus: The Apostles are Bishops: Prophets be interpreters of the
Scriptures, although in the beginning there were Prophets, as Agabus, and the
four Virgins Prophetesses, as it is in the Acts of the Apostles. etc. yet
now interpreters be called Prophets, Evangelists be Bucerin. 4. Ephe.
Deacons, as Philip: for although they be no Priests, yet may they preach
the Gospel without a chair, as both Stephanus and Philippe before named.
Bucer upon the Fol. 42. sect. vlt.
same place says that there be Evangelists now, and you your self fol. 42.
confess, that Hus, Jerome of Prage, Luther, Zuinglius. etc. were Evangelists.
Peter Martyr in his P. Martyr.
Commentaries upon the. 12. to the Romans says, that the Apostle there
describes those functions and gifts, which are at all times necessary for
the Church: And in that place the Apostle mentions Prophesying. M. Calvin
in his Institut. Calvin.
cap. 8. does confess, that God has stirred up Apostles or Evangelists since
that time of the Primitive Church, and that he has done so likewise even
now in this time.

M. Bullinger upon the place of the fourth to the Ephe. says, that the
words Bullinger.
be confounded, and that an Apostle is also called a Prophet: a Doctor, an
Euangeliste, a minister, and a Bishop: and a Bishop, an Euangeliste, and a
Prophet. etc. To be short, it is thus written in the Confession of the
Churches in Heluetia, Confess. Heluetica.
The ministers of the new Testament be called by sundry names: for they are
called Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Bishops. etc. And (speaking of
Prophets) it says: The Prophets in time paste, foreseeyng things to come,
were called Seers, who were expounders of the Scriptures also, as some be even
now a days. Evangelists were writers of the history of the Gospel, and
Preachers also of the glad tidings of Christ his Gospel: As Paul bid
Timothy do the work of an Euangeliste. etc. So that to say, that there is
in the Church Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists in such sense as I have
declared, is no strange divinity, to such as be divines in deed. But let
us hear your reasons.

Chap. 3. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page. 45. Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4.
And that you may have some thing to do more, than peradventure you thought
of, when you wrote these words, I will show my reasons, why I think there
ought to be none, nor can be none, unless they have wonderful and
extraordinary callings. It must first be understood that the signification
of this word Apostle, when it is properly taken, extends it self not only
to all the ministers of God, being sent of God, but to the Ambassador of any
Prince or noble man, or that is sent of any public authority, and is used of
the Scripture by the trope of Synecdoche for the twelve, that our Savior Christ
appointed to go thoroughout all the world, to preach the Gospel, unto the
which number was added Saint Paul, and as some think Barnabas, which are
severed from all other ministers of the Gospel by these notes.

First, that they were immediately called of God, as S. Paul to the Galathians,
proves him Gal. 1.
self to be an Apostle, because he was not appointed by men.

Then that they saw Christ, which argument Saint Paul uses in the. 9. 1.
Cor. Am I not an Apostle? have I not seen Christ?

Thirdly, that these had the field of the whole world to till, whereas other
are restrained more particularly, as to a certain plough land, wherein they
should occupy themselves: whereupon it follows, that as we conclude against
the Pope truly, that he can be no successor of the Apostles, not only because
he neither teaches, nor does as they did, but because the Apostles have no
successors, neither any can succeed into the office of an Apostle: so may we
likewise conclude against those that would have the Apostles now a days, that
there can be none, because there is none, unto whom all these three notes do
agree: as that he is both sent of God immediately, or that he has seen
Christ, or that he is sent into all the world.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin upon the sixteenth to the Romans says, that this word
Apostle, in proper and usual signification, does only comprehend that
first order which Christ in the beginning did appoint in his twelve
disciples, which is directly con trarie to your saying.

I grant that in such respects as you now put down, there be no Apostles:
although Matthias was not immediately called by God, as it appears Acts. 1.
and you before have confessed: neither can you prove by the Scripture, that
Barnabas was so called, but the contrary rather does appear in the. 11. of
the Acts, and yet he was an Apostle. Saint Paul in the first to the
Corinth. 9. does not say that he saw Christ, to prove that he was an
Apostle, but to declare that he was in that respect nothing inferior to the
rest of the Apostles. I have before declared in what sense I say that there be
Apostles in the church: neither is it a matter so strange seeing that M.
Calvin says as much in the place before recited: Quanquam non nego, quin
Apostolos postea quoque, vel saltem eorum loco Euangelistas interdum excitarit
Deus, vt Call. in. 16. To. instit. cap. 8.
nostro tempore factum est, Although I do not deny, but that God has
afterward also stirred up Apostles, or at the least Evangelists in stead of
them, as it is done in our days.

Chap. 3. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page. 45. Sect.. 5.
And although some Ecclesiastical writers do call sometimes good ministers
successors of the Apostles, yet that is to be understood because they
propounde the same doctrine that they did, not because they succeeded into the
same kind of function, which they could not do. S. Paul does use this word
sometimes in his proper and native signification, for him that is publicly
sent from any to other, as when he speaks of the brethren that were joined
with Titus, which were sent by the Churches with relief to the poor Church
in Jerusalem and Inry, and where he calls Epaphroditus an Apostle. But that
is with addition and not simply, as in the first place he calls the brethren
the Apostles of the Churches, that is, not the Apostles of all Churches, or
sent to all 2. Cor. 8.
Churches, but the Apostles which certain Churches sent with the relief to
other certain churches: and Epaphroditus he calls not an Apostle simply, but
the Apostle of the Philippians, that Philip. 2.
is, which the Philippians sent with relief to Paul, being in prison at Rome,
as it appears in the same epistle.

Io. Whitgifte.
The writers of ye Magdelb. history call Epaphroditus an Apostle in the same
sense Epaphroditus an Apost.
that they call Paul, and the rest of the Apostles: and M. Calvin thinks the
name of an Cent. 1. lib. 2. cap. 7.
Apostle to be taken in that place generally, pro quolibet Euangelista: for any
preacher of the gospel. Ambrose says: erat eorum Apostolus a Paulo factus,
dum illum ad exhortationem Calvin. in. 2 Philip.
eorum mittebat ad eos: he was made their Apostle of Paul, when as at their
request he sent him unto them. And Theodoret in plain words does call him an
Apostle, because he Ambrose. in Philip. 2.
was bishop of the Philippians. If these say true, as no doubt they do, the^ is
not Epaphroditus called an Apostle only in that signification, that you say he
was. In that he Theo. 1. Tim. 3. and Phil. 2.
calls them Apostles with an addition of the Churches, not of all Churches,
he confirms my saying, for it argues that there may be Apostles though they
have commission but for one kingdom or province only, as Epaphroditus was the
Apostle of the churches of the Philippians, because he was sent unto them to
preach. Thus does both Ambrose, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Calvin, and others
write.

Chap. 3. the fourth Division.
T. C. Page 46. Sect. 1.
And as for Andronicus and Iunius which are by you recited T. C. (...) off a
direct answer with this (belike)
belike to prove that we may have more Apostles, because it is said of S. Paul
that they were famous and notable amongst the Romans 16.
Apostles, it cannot be proved by any thing I see there, whether they had any
function ecclesiastical or no. For S. Paul calls them his kinsfolks, and
fellow prisoners, and does not say that they were his fellow laborers: and
a man may be well notable and famous amongst the Apostles, and well known
unto them, which is no Apostle. And if the Apostles would have had this order
of the Apostles to continue in the Church, there is no doubt but that they
would have chosen one into James his room, when he was slain, as they did,
when they supplied the place of Judas, by choosing Matth^s, and so ever as they
had dyed, the other would have put other in their places. So it appears that
this function of the Apostles is ceased.

place, They are called notable amongst the Apostles: not because they were of
the college of the twelve Apostles, but because (as it is credible) they had
spread the Gospel through Martyr in. 16 Romans
many places, and had planted many Churches. And a little after speaking of
your interpretation, he says, This sense does not displease me, if the words
themselves be not contrary thereunto. So that he seems to doubt whether the
words will bear your interpretation or no. Gualter and Bullinger also suppose
it not to be vnlykely^, Gualter in. 16. Romans
that they were the first planters of Christian religion at Rome. And I can
read of none that doubts whether they had any function Ecclesiastical or
no, as you do.

I brought them in before pagina. 47. to prove that some may be chosen to
preach the word which have no certain cure, and you to avoid a direct
answer, have shifted them of to this place, and now you say, that belyke. I
bring them in to prove that we may have more Apostles, which thing in deed
they prove manifestly, but I brought them in to declare that a man may be
admitted to preach, though he have no certain cure, and to that you have not
answered.

There is nothing expressed in Scriptures, whether the Apostles did choose any
into the room of James or no: but I am persuaded they did not, neither was it
necessary. For who ever said, that there must continually be twelve Apostles,
and neither more nor less?

I told you before out of M. Calvin, that this word Apostle, in his proper
and usual signification comprehends only the twelve Apostles appointed by
Christ. Wherefore in this signification there are now no Apostles, neither was
there any since that time: but it signifies also generally such as preach
the Gospel in sundry places, and although they go not through the whole world,
as the twelve did, yet are they not bound to any one place certainly. And
according to this signification, there both has be^e and are Apostles.

You ask further, that if a man should not preach before he have a pastoral
charge, what they will answer unto Philip and Epaphroditus, whereby your
meaning is belike, that although they beno Pastors, yet they may be
Euangeli^ts, which go about the country here and there. But this office is
ceased in the Church, as the Apostles is, saving that sometimes the Lord
does raise up some extraordinarily, for the building up of the Churches, which
are fallen down, and pulled up by the foundations, as I have showed somewhat
before. And that it is ceased, it may appear by these reasons.

First, for because all those that the Scripture calls precisely Evangelists
(which are only Philipan^ Timothy) had their callings confirmed by miracle,
and so it is like that Titus and (...) and ^pollos, and if there were any
other, had their vocations after the same manner Act. 8. 39.
confirmed, but there is no such miraculous confirmation now, therefore there
is no such vocation. 1 Timothy I. 18.


Io. Whitgifte.
I have declared both before by Scripture, reason, and other authority, that
though the name of an Evangelist be changed, yet the office remains. The
Scripture no where calls Tunothie an Evangelist, only. 2. Ti. 4. S. Paul
wills him to do 2. Tim. 4.
the work of an Evangelist, which is, to preach the Gospel. But of this
matter I have at large spoken in an other place.

It passes to see how boldly you do abuse the Scripture. Where do you
read that either (...) or Philippe, were ordained or confirmed Evangelists,
by miracle? There can be no such thing imagined: in the. 39. verse Acts. 8. the
words Act. 8.
be these: And as soon as they (that is Philippe and the Eunuche) were come
out of the water, the spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the
Eunuche saw him no more etc. Was this the miracle that confirmed Philip an
Evangelist? Lord God what mean you? This was rather done to confirm the
Eunuche: As for Philip it is manifest that before this miracle he was an
Evangelist: for in the same chapter we read that before this time Philip had
preached in Samaria, and converted them, being before seduced by Simon the
sorcerer: and that he had also baptized them. Moreover he had converted the
Eunuch, and baptized him before this miracle was showed: wherefore it could not
be a confirming of his Euangelistship.

That in the. 1. Ti. 1. verse. 18. insinuates, that diverse Prophecies had gone
before of Timothy, whereby it was revealed that he should be a woorthye
Minister of the Church, or as Calvin says, which had commended him to the
church: although there be sundry interpretations of that place more like to
be true than that. But how proves it that he was made an Evangelist, by
miracle? First Timothy was now a Bishop, as hereafter is proved. Secondly,
here is no mention made of any calling to an Evangelist ship. Thirdly, a
Prophecy is not a miracle. Last of all, though this were true both in Philip
and Timothy (as it is in neither) yet does it not follow, that whosoever is
called to be an Evangelist, must also be confirmed by miracle, for particular
examples make no general rule: Timothy was ordained minister of the Gospel,
per impositionem manuum, by the laying on of hands, 1. Tim. 4.
1. Ti. 4. 2. Ti. 1. And therefore his vocation was ordinary, and needed no
such confirmation 2. Tim. ^.
by miracle.

T. C. Page. 46. Sect. 4.
Now again, if there should be any Evangelist, who should ordeyne him? you
will say the Bishop. But I say that can not be, that the greater should be
ordained of the less. For Heb. 7.
the Evangelist is a higher degree in the Church, than is the Bishop or
pastor. And if he be so, why has he not his estimation here in the Church
about the Bishop or Archbishop either? for the Archbishop is but a Bishop, or
why does not he ordeyne Bishops as Tunothie and Titus did, which were
Evangelists, being one point of their office, as Eusebius declares? Eusebius.
li. 3. cap. 27.


Io. Whitgifte.
You do but try my patience in so often offending in the petition of the
principle: For neither can you prove an Evangelist to be an higher degree in
the Church than is a Bishop, neither is it true that Timothy and Titus were
Evangelists, and not Bishops, and in that point have you all the writers both
old and new, stories and other, one or two only excepted, flatly against you,
besides the evident reasons that may be collected out of the Scripture.

I know not to what purpose you quote the. 7. to the Hebrews, except it be for
this Hebr. 7.
text: The less is blessed of the greater: in which place blessing is not
taken for ordeyning or consecrating: for Melchisedech did no such thing to
Abraham. But it is there taken as it is Numer. 6. where the Priests are
commanded to bless the Numer 6.
people, and therefore serves not your turn for any thing here spoken.

I understand not to what end you quote Eusebius in his third book, and. 27.
Chapter. Uaine quotation.
For there is not in that place one word spoken of an Evangelist, or any part
of his office.

Chap. 3. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page. 46. Sect. 5.
Again, if there be in every Church a Pastor, as S. Paul commands, what
should the Evangelists do? for either that pastor does his duty, and then the
Evangelist is superfluous, or if he do it not, then he is no lawful pastor,
and so ought he to be put out, and an other to be put in his stead. And where
the pastor doing his duty can not suffice, there the Scripture has given him
an aid of the Doctor, which for because his office consists in teaching
doctrine, to this end that the Pastor might not be driven to spend so much
time in propounding the doctrine, but might have the more time to employ in
exhorting and dehorting, and applying of the doctrine to the times and places,
and persons, it is manifest that he also is tied to a certain Church. For how
could he be an aid unto the pastor to whose help he is given, unless he
were in the same church where the pastor is? And that the Evangelists office
has been to taken as a function that endured Lib. 5. cap. 10.
but for a time, it may appear first by that which Eusebius writes speaking
of Pantenus: for says he, there were until that time Evangelists. etc. which
was about the year of our Lord. 162. Whereby he gives to understand, that
about that time they ceased, and that in his time there was none, when
notwithstanding there were Bishops or Pastors, and Elders Li. 1. offic. 1.
and Deacons. And Ambrose says, that there be no Apostles, but those which
Christ himself did appoint: whereby it appears, that of all the
Ecclesiastical functions that preach the word there are but the Pastor and
Doctor only left unto us, and the same also restrained to particular charges.

Io. Whitgifte.
But what if there be not in every Church such a Pastor, neither can be, is
the Evangelist then necessary? you must of necessity confess that, for the
people must not be deprived of the word, when by such means they may have
it. Howebeit, though every Church had his Pastor, and every pastor did his
duty, yet might preaching by other do good, as well for the confirmation of
the Doctrine, and the more frequent preaching, as also for that it pleases God
sometimes to work that by one, that he does not by an other. But what
Scripture have you to prove that the Doctor is added to the Pastor, as an
aid, or that the Doctor is tied to a certain place? you have no license to
coin new Scriptures, and in the old I am sure you can not find it. As for
your bare word, it is but a very bare proof.

I told you before, that Hierome, Augustine, Chrysostom, Musculus, and
diverse other upon good reason confound Pastor, and Doctor, and think them
to be but diverse names of one office. And whereas you say, that the Doctors
office consists in teaching doctrine, to this end, that the Pastor might
not be driven to spend so much time in propoundyng the doctrine. etc. I
would gladly know whence you learn that. Ambrose says, they be such as
see good rule kept in the Church, or such as Ambrose in 4. Ephesians.
teach children.

Eusebius words speaking of Pantenus be these: There were as yet at that time
many Evangelists, which were pressed and ready to this, that they might with
a godly zeal according to the Apostles example, promote and plant the word
of God. Which prove, that there were then Evangelists good store, which were
zealous. etc. But there is no mention made of any ceassing of their office: it
rather proves a continuance of the same, being so long after the Apostles
time. There is now no such Evangelists as go from kingdom to kingdom, or
thoroughe the Lib. 5. cap. 9.
world, because the miraculous gift of tongues is now ceased. Neither is
any now lawfully called to any such Ecclesiastical function, but by man,
and therefore they must go no further than his authority extends that has
called them.

Ambrose says truly, if he should say that there are no Apostles but such as
Christ himself appointed, if we speak proprely and usually (as I have before
declared) but that is no hinderance to any thing yt I have affirmed. And yet
surely ye words of Ambrose sound nothing that way, for Ambrose abasing and
disabling himself says thus: Non igitur mihi apostolorum gloriam vendico,
quis enim boc, nisi quos ipse filius elegit dei? etc. I therefore challenge not
to my self the glory of the Apostles: for who can do this, but they whom the
son of God did choose? And what can you hereof conclude? He says afterward
also, that i e does not challenge to himself the circumspection of Pastors, yet
was he then a Bishop, as it is in that place evident. Gladly would you have
some authority for your purpose, if you could tell where to find it.

Of the residence of the Pastor. Tract. 5.
Chap. 1. the first Division.
T. C. Page. 46. Sect. 6.
Now that I have proved that there are no Evangelists, Prophets or Apostles,
and that the ministeries of the word, which remain, are limited unto certain
places: I will take that which you grant, that is, that the Pastor or Bishop
ought to have a special flock. And demand of you, wherefore he should have
it? Is it not to attend upon it? And can he attend upon it, unless he be
resident and abiding upon it? But he cannot be abiding upon it, if he go from
place to place to preach where he thinks necessary. Therefore being Pastor
or Bishop of a congregation allotted unto A digression from the matter to the
person.
him, he may not go from place to place to preach where he thinks good, much
less to have a mastership of a college in one corner of the land, a Deanery in
another, and a Prebend in the third, and so be absent from his pastoral
charge in such places, where either he preaches not, or needs not to preach,
those places being otherwise furnished without him. For then how is this
difference kept between the Pastor and other ministers, that the one is tied
to a place, and the other is not. For if you say, that it is in that he shall
preach more at his flock, than at other places, I answer that the Evangelists
and Apostles did carry longer in one place, than in another, and taught some
congregations years, when they did not othersome months. And therefore they
say nothing, which allege for the nonresidence of Pastors that S. Paul
called Timothy and Titus from Ephesus and Crete, for first they were
Evangelists and no Pastors, then they went not of their own heads, but called
of the Apostle, which was a chief gouernoure of the Church. And thirdly they
went not, but having other sufficient put in their place, as it appears in
their seuerell epistles, so that if that place make any thing it makes not to
prove the non residencie, but rather whether a minister may be translated from
one Church to another.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your reader, if he judge indifferently, cannot but acknowledge this, that you
so co^fidently speak of proores, to be but a vain brag and nothing so.

There is no man that denies but that a Pastor ought so to attend upon his
slocke, How a Pastor ought to be rendent.
as he may be well able to do his duty toward the same, and with a good
conscience answer his doings before the chief Pastor, to whom he shall give
his account. In the mean time if he be godly, if he preach among them as
often as he is persuaded to be convenient, if he have a care over them, that
they be not destitute of that, which is necessary, if he have such as are
honest, learned, and diligent to supply his absence, he may be bold to say to
his unlawful judges, tu quis es, qui iudicas alienum seruum, proprio Romans 14.
domino stat, aut cadit. Who art thou, which condemnest another man's servant?
he stands or falls to his own Master* Whether a Pastor having a flock,
may also preach out of his own charge, is another question. And although it be
by you denied, yet because your words without proof weigh not much, I will
(for the avoiding of confusion) speak nothing thereof in this place, but this
only, that as the opinion is strange, so is it most untrue, and not to be
justified either by Scripture, aunciente fathers, or reasons.

But (oh T C.) who sees not the mark, you shoot at? who perceyueth not how

slide from the matter to the person? To what end do you here recite a
mastership of a college, a Deanrie* a Prebend, but that your meaning is to
note some one particular man, whom (because he has withstoode your erroneous
and contentious doctrine, has not exalted you, as it is well known you have
desired, has executed those laws upon you, which (for the avoiding of
manifest and wilful perjury) you ought to The oath of the fellows of Tri.
Col. in Came.
have executed of your self) you seek by all means possible to deface. Is
this conscience* Is this praebe, e te beneuolum magistro, non solum dum in eo
vixeris, sed etiam postea pro virill. etc. The Lord forgive you, and give you
grace to know your self. If he that has this mastership, Deanery, Prebend and
benefice, neglect his duty in any one of them, if he do not that, that both
Gods laws and man's laws require of him, if be be a loyterer, if he seek his
ease, if he be not able to give an account of his doings when he shall
thereunto be called, then let him sustain both the shame, and the blame also.

The Pastor is not so tied to any place, that he may not from the same be
bodily The Pastor may be absent upon occasion
absent upon occasto^, as I am ready to prove by sufficient both reason and
authority, when I shall be urged there unto. The examples of the Evangelists
and of the Apostles do verify the same, for they fully instructed the
churches, wherein they preached, in all things necessary to salvation, though
they did not continually remain with them, but now and then visit them. And
therefore the Pastors may so do in like manner.

Touching Timothy and Titus (whom you so often without any kind of proof deny
Timothy being a Pastor was absent from Ephesus.
to be Pastors) I have spoken else where at large: notwithstanding because your
too too bold asseuerations may appear what they are, I will in a few words
even in this place declare, both that Timothy and Titus were Pastors, and
that their examples do evidently prove that a Pastor may be upon occasions
absent from his flock. And for this time I will be content with that only,
that M. Calvin writes touching In ye treatise of Archbyshops. etc.
the same matter, referring the reader for further proof, to that, that I have
in more ample manner written of the same. M. Calvin. 1. Ti. 1. does call
Timothy Pastor of the Church of Ephesus. And in the. 1. Ti. 4. expounding
these words, ne donum quod Tract. 8. Calvin.
in te est. etc. he says that the holy ghost had by oracle appointed Timothy
to be received into the order of Pastors. And. 2. Ti. 4. that he did excel
vulgar and common Pastors, meaning that he was an excellent Pastor, endued
with more singular and notable gifts, and of greater authority, than the
common sort of Pastors be. And in the same Chapter speaking of Paul's sending
for Timothy from Ephesus to Rome, he says, that there was no small cause why
Paul sent for Timothy from that Church, which he ruled and governed, and
that so far off: hereby we may gather (says he) how profitable conference
is with such men: for it might be profitable to all Churches, which Timothy
might learn in a small time: so that the absence of half a year, or of one
whole year, is nothing in comparison of the commodity, that comes thereby.
Whereby it is manifest that Calvin both took him to be a Pastor, and also
excuses his absence. So that the example of Timothy makes much for the
pnrpose: The like may be said of Titus, and of sundry other in the scriptures.

Now if the Apostle being a chief gouernoure of the Church might call Timothy
and Titus so far from their cures, and that for no great, nor yet common
matters of the Church, but for his own private business, as it appears. 2.
Tim. 4. then I trust you will also think it lawful, that such as be rulers
and governors of the Church, may do the like. There is no man that writes so
exactly of Non residence, but Lawful causes of the pastors absence.
he confesses certain necessary causes of absence, as if it be for the
commodity of the Church, whereof he is Pastor, or for the commodity of the
whole church of that kingdom, or for the commodity of other particular
churches in the same, or for necessity, or upon commandment of higher
authority: in all these and such like cases the absence of a Pastor is
lawful, and it is praesentia rather than absentia, if you will believe learned
writers. Now if you will demand of me who shall allow these causes, I answer,
no one private man, of what calling soever he be, but the magistrates, to whom
the government of the Church is committed, if they allow the absence, and the
Pastor satisfye his own conscience, there is no man of God, no good
conscience, no modest spirit, that dare presume to judge him, much less to
condemn him.

That he ought in his absence to provide a sufficient deputy, I confess, and
that example of Tichichus does prove that, for he was Timothies deputy, and
not his successor, as you seem to insinuate. M. Calvin says that S. Paul
sent Tichichus to Ephesus, Ca.* in. 2. Ti. 4.
when he sent for Timothy to Rome, in the mean time to supply his absence:
So that he was but Timothies deputy. Moreover it is manifest that Timothy was
often absent Timothy often absent from Ephesus.
from Ephesus, twice with Paul at Rome, and that he returned thither again
this last time, as well as he did at other times, as both M. Caluines words
before mentioned do declare, and I also have evidently proved in that place,
where I prove Timothy Tract. 8.
to be Bishop of Ephesus.

But I will never weary my pen to confute those, whom their own This is

principle, for there is no man (I think) that so regards preaching in other
places that he neglects it in his own. But I am fully persuaded, ye God has
so called no man to one place, that he has restreyned him from doing good in
other places also: and I constantly believe, that in the mo places he labors
and does good, the more his service to be accepted unto God. And it is a token
that he is truly called when he has an hearty desire to profit many.

All congregations of Christians are dear unto God: wherefore he does not so
much incline to any one, that he would have the other altogether neglected.
And therefore if there be but one good man placed in a whole shire, I think
that he is there placed to do good in the country round about him, and that he
ought so to do, because they be all sheep perteining to one fold: but yet so
must he labor generally, that he have an especial care of his own particular
flock.

And you see that if I would follow those noble metaphores of watchman and
Shepherd, which the scripture uses to express the office of a minister with,
what a large field is opened unto me. For then I could show you how that cities
besteged, and flocks in danger of the wolves, are Luke. 2.
* watched continually night and day. And that there is no city so sore and
so continually besieged, nor no flocks subject to so manyfold diseases at home,
or hurtful and devouring beasts abroad, and that without any truce or
intermission, as are the Churches, the Shephards, and watchmen whereof are
Pastors or Bishops.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have showed before what your metaphors of watchmen and the pheards ca^
prove: Tract. 4. cap. 1. diuis. 6.
what dissimilitudes there is betwixt them and spiritual watchmen and Pastors.
I think your meaning is not, that the Pastor should preach both night and day,
or that The metaphores of watchme^ and shephards.
there is no continual watching, but continual preaching. If I were disposed
to dally with you in your metaphores, I could say unto you that watchmen must
of necessity oftentimes have their deputies, or else that there must be many
of them, and so watch by turns. I could also say, that as soon as the watchman
has told the city of the enemies approaching, and has discrieb them unto it,
he may depart from his station and take his rest.

Likewise that the watchman has least to do, when his enemies are nighest,
especially when they have invaded the city: for then are the soldiers to
drive them away by force. Wherefore by these metaphors this only can you
prove, that the Pastors ought to admonish their flocks of their enemies,
discrie them in time, and will them to be vigilant. The enemies are known, the
armoure is certain, the citizens reasonable, wherefore if they neglect the
Admonitions given in due time and order, if they be not vigilant, their blood
be upon their own pates, the watchman has done his duty. The like in all
respects may be said of shephards and sheep.

To what purpose you have quoted in your margent the. 2. of Luke. I know not,
Luke. 2.
except it be, because it is there said, that the shepherds were watching
their sheep in the night. The which how you can apply to your purpose I would
gladly learn, for these shepherds went from their sheep, and left them in
great danger.

But I will leave that to their considerations, and will show that the parts
and duties of the minister be such and so many in his own flock, that if he
were as wise as Solomon was, as great in council as Joseph, as well learned as
S. Paul, as active as Iosue, which fought so many battayles in small space,
yet al were little enough or too little, to perform to the ^ul that, which
his charge requir^th of him. Of the Pastors therefore is required not only the
preaching of the word, and ministering of the sacraments, whereof, the preaching
of the word, and ministering of the sacrament of baptism, ought to be
continually, and as often, as the Church may conveniently assemble, the other
sacrament of the Lord his supper, although not so continually (sor that the
Church shall hardly have so much leisure from their necessary affairs of this
life, as that they may celebrate it as ^ften as the other) yet so often, as
that we remember* that too rare and seldom celebrating it, argues a mind too
too much forgetful of the unspeakable benefyte of our redemption, and argues
also that we are far behind the primitive Church in zeal, which did
celebrate it every Saboth: I say beside the preaching of the word, and
ministering of the sacraments, there is required of him that he should admonish
privately, and house by house those that are under his charge. 20. Acts.


Io. Whitgifte.
Certain it is, that the charge of a Pastor is great, and that he, which does
the best, must confess and say that he is but an unprofitable servant: and yet
if he occupy his talents, be they mo, or be they fewer, and gain with them
more or less, he has a merciful master, who will embrace him with mercy,
and will accept of his service. And therefore, though he be much inferioure to
Solomon in wisdom, to Joseph in council, to Paul in learning, and to Joshua
in actiuitie, yet may he be a faithful servant, Matthew. 25.
and hear of his Lord and master, Euge serve bone and fidelis. etc. It is well
done good servant and faithful.

If you should thus straightly deal with the Pastors, and leave them no
consolation, you should not follow our savior. Christ his mildness and
mercy.

But let the bitterness of your speeches go, and let us come to the weight of
your reasons: you say that there is required of the Pastors preaching of the
word, and ministering of the sacraments, and private admonition, and that ye
preaching of the word and ministering of the sacrament of Baptism, ought to be
continual: and private exhortations likewise, and therefore the Pastor may not
be absent. Touching ye preaching of ye word I have spoken before something, it
must be according ye to conscience and discretion of the Pastor, who has to
consider what is best for that congregation, whereof he has ye charge, both for
the often preaching, and for the manner of preaching also: The sacraments may
be administered by other, than by the pastor, as they were in the Apostles time.
1. Cor. 1. and Act. 10. Private exhortation must also be used as occasion
serves, according to the discretion of the minister. But I marvel that you
say, the ministryng of the sacrament of Baptism ought to be continually. etc.
Baptisin ministered but once in the year.
You know that in Victor his time it was celebrated but once in the year at
Easter. And in Tertullians time at Easter and Pentecoste, and in many Parishes
in England there is no such daily need of administering that Sacrament. To
conclude, both the Sacraments may be as well ministered by an other if
occasion serve. And therefore of all other reasons this is the slenderest.

Saint Paul's meaning in the. 20. of the Acts, is not that he daily went
into their houses to exhort them, but that he did so as occasion served.

Now tell me how this can be done profitably, without a diligent marking and
looking into their manners? How can either public preachings, or private
admonitions have their effect and working, unless the word of God be applied
according to the disposition or state of that people, unto which it is
preached? And undoubtedly hereof it comes that the word of God is no more
effectual in this realm than it is, for because it is preached hand over
head, without knowledge and understanding the estate of the people. For so,
oftentimes the promises and glad tidings of the gospel of our Savior are
preached unto those, that being before secure in their sins, are after the
hearing of the promises rocked into a dead sleep thereof, and they that are
overthrown with the conscience of their sin, and confounded in themselves,
are by the sharpness of the law, and hearing of the judgment of God broken
into pieces, and driven to desperation. And so likewise, the people are taught
sometimes how to lead their lives in honest conversation, when all that
doctrine falls to the ground, because they have no knowledge of Christ, nor
of faith in him: and to be short, it is as much as if either the surgeon should
apply his plaster, or the Physician his medicine, when they neither know of
the wound, or disease of their patients. But this knowledge of their estate,
cannot be without a continual abode amongst them, therefore a continual
residence is necssary.

The Apostles and other in their time, did not long continue in one place to

not perpetually resident among them.

The word of God (his name be praised therefore) has bin effectual in
England, and numbers are by the same converted from superstition, blindness,
and ignorance, to the true knowledge of God. But this is an old and usual
objection of the Anabaptists against the Church of Christ, that in their
Churches there is a manifest amendme^t The usual objection of ye Anabaptists
of life, but in other Churches, which seem to profess the gospel, there
appears no such fruit: and that the gospel is preached, but no man the
better. This I say, is the slanderous speech of the Anabaptists against those
Churches, from the which they have divided themselves, and it is very often used
by you.

You must think that there be Pastors and Preachers in England, that
understand the state of the people, and know what discretion to use in their
sermons and exhortatio^s, as well as you can teach them. But this is most true,
that as you think none learned but your self, so do you also judge all men to
lack both wit add discretion but your self. And here in this place have you
taken upon you this censure most confidently, I will not say arrogantly.

In the end of this division you conclude thus, the knowledge of the estate of
the people cannot be known without a continual abode with them: therefore a
continual residence is necessary. You must prove the Antecedent, for it is
false. The Apostle knew (so far as it was The Pasto^ may know the estate of
the people without a con tinuall abode amongst them
necessary for him to know) the Romans, the Corinthians, Galatians and other
Churches to whom he wrote, and yet was he not continually resident among them*
And so did the other Apostles and Preachers, which were not resident in any
one place: and yet a preacher may do good in preaching among them, whom he
knows not, for it is God that directs him in his words and matter. And for
as much as he cannot but know that every congregation consists of diverse
minds and affections, therefore (except he be void of discretion) he will so
moderate and temper his sermon or exhortation, that it may profit all, and
hurt none, but such as do not accordingly receive it. And therefore both
these propositions are false: the a man by preaching cannot profit such, as he
knows not: and that he cannot know them, except he be perpetually resident
with them.

Moreover as in the law the priests were ready in the temple to answer to all the doubts and questions, that any of the people should come to ask: so the
ministers in their several parishes should be ready to dissolve the
difficulties, that either one has with another, or with himself, touching
the conscience, for want whereof, the consciences of many, after doubtful and
dangerous wrestling with the devil, and which despair are strangled. And
thereupon some hang or drown themselves, some other putting away all care or
conscience of sinning, and laboring to have no sense nor feeling of their
sin, close up the wound unhealed, which after, either breaks out more
daungerously, or else every day more and more waxing senseless, and without
feeling, treasure up unto themselves the wrath of God against the day of
judgment. For although the judgment of God does not for the time follow them
so hard, as them, which through terroure of conscience untaught and
vncomforted, kill themselves: yet their estate is never the less dangerous
therefore, but rather more, for as much as by a longer line of sin drawn out,
they also pull upon themselves a heavier comdemnation. Which things when they
see oftentimes before their eyes, that will consider it, it is easy to judge
that it comes to pass a great deal oftener than we can see.

Io. Whitgifte.
You do not refer me to any place, where I might read that the priests in
the law were ready in the temple to answer all the doubts and questions, that
any of the people should come to ask. etc. And I do not remember any such
place in the scripture, except you mean that, which is written in the. 17. of
Deute. verse. 9. etc. where there is no such Deute. 17.
attendance mentioned: but only the people are willed to bring their
controversies to the priests and the judge. If you mean the. 12. verse of that
Chap. where it is said of the priest that he stands before the Lord to
minister there, you have also missed the quisshion. For the meaning of that
place is that whosoever presumptuously refuses to harken unto the Priest (so
long as the priest is the true minister of God, and pronounces according to
his word) shall die. etc. The priest here had to do in civil and judicial
matters together with the judge: the priest was but in the chief place, where
judgment was heard, and not in every particular congregation. Wherefore if you
would conclude any thing of this place, it must be, that the Priest must be
joined with the Judge, and have to do in civil and judicial matters, and
remain in some chief place of the country where judgments are to be heard.
You can by no means hereof conclude, that every particular congregation should
have a Pastor continually remaining with them.

There is not now any such general ignorance, but that there may diverse be
found able to answer all such doubts, as you speak of sufficiently, though the
Pastor be absent. The scriptures also are publicly red in every man's house,
which are as Saint Paul says. 2. Ti. 3. profitable to teach, to improve, to
correct, to instruct in righteousenes, 2. Tim. 3.
that the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect in all good works: and
as Chrysostom calls them, they be an apothecarie his shop, where every man
may find In. 3. Coll.
remedy for his diseases.

Moreover the sufficiency of his curate may be such, that he shall be as well
able to answer all such questions, as if he himself were present. Neither
are those cases you put usual (God be thanked) and they oftentimes happen,
where there is least cause to complain of any absence of the Pastor.

When as therefore the only preaching of the word of God being continual, is a
bond strong enough to hold the Pastor to his flock, then the inquiry of the
manners and behauioure of his flock, the private admonitions and consolations,
the dissoluing of doubts, when any rises, as a three or four fould cord ought
much more to hold him: so that he which shall break all these things willingly
and wittingly, cannot easily be thought to break them as Sampson did his, by
the strength of God, but rather by some other power not of God.

slouthful pastors: I speak only of such as be vigilant, and occupy
themselves profitably in the Church, visit their several flocks, and teach
them to the satisfying both of the parishes, and of their own consciences
also: such I am persuaded, may do as much in all those points here by you
mentioned, to the commodity of their flock being sometimes absent, as if they
were continually present, besides the good they may do, to the whole Church
generally, whereof they are also members and Ministers.

But I muse with what face you can thus seek to deface true pastors that do

offends God less, than you do, that have forsaken your calling.

Besides that S. Paul commands that the pastor should be a pattern or
example in all goodness, 1. Tim. 4.
and holiness of life unto his flock, and our savior Christ says that when
the she^harde has (...) John. 10.
forth his sheep, he goes before them, but if the Pastor be not amongst his
flock* and have not his conversation there, they can not follow him. If they
have not the example before their eyes, (...) not make the like unto it.
Therefore this commandment also binds them to residencie amongst their
flocks. S. Peter wills the Pastors of the Churches, that they should feed
the flocks. What flocks? Not every one, but those, which are committed to
their faith or trust, or which depends upon them. And S. Paul speaking to ye
ministers or Bishops of Ephesus, wills them Act. 20.
that they should take heed unto the flocks, over the which the holy Ghost
had made them overseers, where he restra^eth, as S. Peter did their oversight
and watch unto their particular flock. 1. These. 2.
S. Paul says that he took it heavily that he was separated from them but a
small time. If therefore the Apostle was away with grief from them, whom he had
taught, who^ his calling compelled to be away, and would not suffer to be
always there: what shall be thought of the Pastors, whose callings is to be
with their flocks, and which are consecrated unto them, eue^ as the Apostles
were unto ye whole world? what I say shall be thought of them, that are away
months and years?

Io. Whitgifte.
Christ is a pattern and an example to us in all goodness, whom we must
follow, A man ma^olow the example of h^ that is not ^lwayes present
and yet we never saw him, but have only heard of him by his word. S. Paul
willed the Corinthians. 1. Cor. 4. and. 11. and the Philippians chap. 3. to
follow him, and yet was he not perpetually resident among them. A man may be
thoroughly known touching his external conversation, of those with whom he is
diverse times conversant, although he be not always abiding with them. I think
there be Pastors very well known to their flocks both for their life and
doctrine, and yet do not continually remain with them: you and I have not bin
long nor much conversant together, and yet surely I suppose that I know you
both touching your Religion, conversation, and affection, as well as if I had
been twenty years companion in your chamber with you. And therefore this is no
good argument, to say that the pastor must be an example to his flock, and
therefore he must of necessity be continually among them, for he may so be,
and that perfectly, if he be sundry times among them, and likewise if they
hear of his good conversation in place where he remains, when he is not
among them.

The same answer serves for that which is alleged out of the. 10. of S. John.

S. Peter. 1. Epist. Chap. 5. does not only exhort Pastors and such as be
addicted to some certain place, but all other also to whom this word presbyter
does reach, as it may appear in that he himself says qui sum and ipse
presbyter, which am also my self an elder. 1. Peter. ^.
Wherefore it is an exhortation general to al preachers and Ministers of ye
word, and not only proper to pastors: the words that follow be diversely
expounded: some say feed the flock of God, which depends upon you, some,
which is committed unto you, and othersome, as much as lies in you, which is
the most common interpretation, (...) it is as much as though he should say,
according to the Talent that God has given unto you. But how soever it be
interpreted, the meaning is, that every man labor in teaching, instructing,
and governing the Church of Christ, and the charge committed unto him
faithfully and diligently. Which exhortation of Peter may be obeyed of him that
is not continually remaining in one place, if he do, as I have said before.

The words of S. Paul Acts. 20. tend to the same end. A minister of the word
and pastor must be diligent in his calling, not slothful, and ought to seek
by all means possible to profit the Church of Christ, and especially in such
places, where unto he is especially called: all this I grant.

The place of S. Paul. ^. These. 2. is far from the purpose. For Paul
declares his singular good will and affection that he had to the
Thessalonians: he does not express any duty of his ministry, and therefore a
learned man interpreting that place says, binc colligimus, quod sancti etiam
se videre secundion carnem gestiunt, hereof we gather, that the Saints also do
gladly desire to see one another bodily. A man to express his singular
affection toward his friend, will say, that it greeueth him to be out of his
company one hour. But how follows this argument. Paul was desirous to be
corporally present with the Thessalonians, and to remain with them, Ergo a
Pastor must never be absent from his flock? if it be lawful to make such
arguments, I will conclude any thing.

And indeed those that feed their flocks faithfully according to the
commandment of God, do see what a great wisdom and mercy of God it is to
appoint every flock his pastor, and every pastor his flock. They can tell of
a wonderful love, that God works in them toward their flocks, and in
their flocks toward them. A great encoragment unto them, and as it were a
prick to stir up their dullness it is, when they see the blessing of God
upon their labors, and thereof a marvelous care, and thought to turn all such
things away, as should hinder the increase of that blessing, which they can
not have any feeling or experience of, which are not conversant with their
flocks, besides a familiarity between the pastor and the flock is profitable
to this, that eueri^ one may be emboldened to come and demand to be
satisfied of those things they doubt of, which they will never do unto those,
whom they are not by continual conversation acquainted with.

Io. Whitgifte.
How can you tell? you have no such experience, for you never had flock: or
what boasting pastor has so bragged of himself? Peradventure because some
troublesome persons delighted with contentions and strange opinions made much
of him, and the rest gave him some countenance, he thought they loved him, when
as peradventure it was nothing so. But be it true of those, whom you mean: I
doubt not but there be flocks that have that love toward their Pastors, and
Pastors that have that love toward their flocks (though they do not
continually remain with them) which ought to be in the Children of God, and
which never will be remoned, deface you them as much as you can.

And it is not nothing, that Aristotle disputes against Plato his community,

preservation of wife or Children, or of any other possession, was then the best
and surest, when as every man had a certain possession committed unto him,
which he should care for, and take charge of. And so the Lord his wisdom
was for the better suertie and salvation of his Church, not to make many
Ministers, which should in common and indifferently take care of all, but
ordained that the Church should be divided in diverse parts, and that every
one should have a piece to care for, and to give account for.

Io Whitgifte.
What has Aristotle to do with non residence? Authority is scarce when his
help is Aristotle not rightly allea ged.
required. But what says he? forsooth, that that which was cared for of all
men, was neglected of all. I think that you report not Aristotle's words
truly: for as far as I remember, he says that that which is common to all,
is neglected of all. The other can not be true, for that which is cared for of
all men, can not be neglected of all (for to care for, and to neglect, be
contraries) but must of necessity be well provided for, and looked unto. But
to what purpose do you allege this? Because I say that no man must so look to

charge, that he neglect the other parts of the Church: do I therefore say
that there is no private charge, but all things are in common? It is the duty
of every member in the common wealth so to look to his own private affairs
and business, that he neglect not the common state of his country: are all
things therefore common? neither did Aristotle ever teach that a man should so
care for his certain possession, that he preferred not the common utility
before it: and so likewise Christ has divided to every man a portion of hie
Church to care for, but yet not so, that he should think himself no longer
bound to the whole, or that he must now cease from profiting the whole.

Now if any man will say, that in such great scarcity of Pastors, it is good,
that when a man has travailed in one place, and removed them from
superstition, and brought them to believe in God through Christ, to go to
another place, and assay also to draw them from Idolatry: first I urge that,
which I did before, which is the calling, wherein every man must abide, and
without the which no man ought to attempt any thing. Then I say, that it is as
hard a province, and as painful a thing unto the pastor, as acceptable and
precious a work unto the Lord, to keep those, which are gotten, as to get
those, which are not gotten: and that that saying is fulfilled here, if in any
thing else, Non minor est virtus, quam quaerere, parta tueri.

Io. Whitgifte.
This objection is of greater force, than you are able to withstand. For the
same God, that has called him to the one place, to plant his true Religion
there, has also called him to the other, that he may do the like even as he
did the Apostles, Prophets and Evangelists, and pastors also, who have been
even immediately after the Apostles time transferred from one place to another,
for the greater commodity of the Church: Neither can it be proved that any man
should be so tied to one place, that he may not be transferred to another to
profit more.

It is true that the devil most grievously assaulteth those, which have
embraced the truth, because now they are become his professed enimyes, and
openly withstand him: But they are sufficiently armed with faith, and with ye
word of God, so that although they be tempted, yet can they not be overcome.
The other that remain in ignorance he wholly possesses, and because they have
yielded themselves unto him, he does suffer them to be quiet: therefore to
deliver such out of his servitude and bondage, and so to arm and instruct
them, that they are not only able to withstand, but to put to flight the devil
also, must of necessity be both the hardest, and the most acceptable work
unto God: except you will say that it is more commendable to help him, who is
sufficiently armed, and able to resist, than him that is altogether unarmed,
and as it were under the foot of his enemy. Certainly the most acceptable
work unto God is, to convert sinners unto repentance, and to heal such as be
sick, and therefore Christ himself said, that he Luke. 19.

For we know that after that the Devil perceyueth, that men are pulled out
of the power of darkness, into the glorious light of the Gospel, he sweateth
and labors by a thousand means to destroy them, and bestirreth himself
more then, than in the time of their ignorance, and in stead of that one
chain of ignorance, and want of the knowledge of God, he lays a thousand
trappes for them, to snare them with. So that the continual danger that the
Church is in, does as it (...)
were speak unto the pastor in the common proverb, (...): that is, look
diligently to that charge, which thou have received. For if the watcheman
should forsake the city, where unto he is appointed, and go, and watch in
another, where he is not called, although he save that, if he loose the other,
he shall not therefore escape the punishment of betraying the other city* where
he was placed watchman.

Io Whitgifte.
So it is: but all the devils in hell can not prevail against them: therefore
said S. Paul to the Ephe. cap. 6. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may

resist the evil day. etc. every Christian is in this case, yea the pastor
himself: but wot you what Christ says, Ioh. 10. My sheep hear by voice,
and no man shall take them Ioh. 10. Chrysostom. in 3. Colos. Colos. 3.
out of my hands. The Scriptures, as Chrysostom says, be continual
scholemasters: and he that has understanding may therein learn how to
withstand Satan and all his assaults. And therefore said the Apostle to the
Coll. 3. Let the word of God dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom, teaching
and admonishing your own selves, in Psalms and hymns. etc.

If the watcheman has sufficiently admonished the city, and has ministered
weapons unto them, brought them out of the bondage of their enemy, and leave
some other behind him to supply the rest, and then go to another city to
deliver it also from the like slavery, if in the mean time the former city be
lost, or revolted (which is not like) their blood be upon themselves, the
watchman has done his duty. When Io^s had told Niniuie her offenses, and
showed his message for the which he was sent, The preacher is called thither
where he may do most good*
was there any more required of him? Moreover I am persuaded, that wheresoever
the preacher may do most good, thither is he called of God: neither is this to
forsake his station, but to follow his calling, and to do good.

Touching the behalf of God and his glory, if any man will say that they can
not perish, which once have believed, and therefore those may be left, and
others attempted, I can say of those that are in ignorance and blindness, that
they can not perish that be elected, although they never have the Gospel
preached. And therefore we must walk in those ways that God has appointed, to
bring them to salvation, which is to feed them continually, and watch over
them so long as they are in danger of hunger, in danger of wolves, in danger
of the enemies, within and without, which is so long as the Church is here
upon the earth.

Io. Whitgifte.
God forbid that any man should use any such kind of excuses, to take away
the means whereby God uses to call such as be his: but it is a comfort to the
pastor, when he is in conscience persuaded, that he has not omitted to open
unto his flock those ways and means, and that he ceasseth not still to
admonish the^ of the same in time convenient. S. Paul Act. 20. says to the
Ministers of the Church of Ephesus, that he Act. 20.
was free from the blood of them all, and that he had opened unto them the
whole counsel of God. etc. and yet he had not bin much with them: and after
that time he thought that he should not see the most of them any more. Wherefore
a man may do his duty, and open all things and means necessary unto
salvation, although he be not continually remaining in one place. Chrysostom
expounding the place in the third to Chrysostom. (...) 3. Col.

them to prepare them Bybles, and told them that it especially perteyneth to
them to read the scriptures, he adds: cast not all upon our shoulders. You
are sheep, but yet reasonable, the Apostle has committed many things unto
you. Those that are to be instructed must not always learn. etc. And again

Upon all which things I conclude, that the residence of the Pastor is
necessary, and to doubt whether the Pastor ought to be resident amongst his
flock, is to doubt whether the watchman should be in his tower, the eye should
be in the head, or the soul in the body, or the shephard amongst his flock,
especally where the sheep are continually in danger of wolves, as in the land
of Jury, from whence this similitude or manner of speech was taken, where they
watched their flocks night and day, as I observed before out of S. Luke.

Io. Whitgifte.
The question is not whether the pastor ought to be resident or no, but of the
time, the manner and kind of residence. No man must continually be absent, for
that were altogether to neglect his flock: neither is it required that he be
continually present, for that can not be. But if he neglect not his duty in
preaching, and perform other things requisite, although he be sundry times
absent upon the occasions before specified, yet is he not to be condemned,
seeing it often times comes to pass, yt such kind of men do most good, both
in their Churches particularly, and in the Church generally.

Of the watchman and of the shephard I have spoken before, and showed wherein
the similitude Tract. 4. ca^* diuis. 6. and tract. 5. ca. ^. diuisi. 3.
holds, and wherein it holds not: no one watchman is continually in ye
tower, neither is it possible that he should be: it is sufficient if the tower
be watched, and the chief watchman neglect not his duty: the shephard also
is not always present with his sheep, but sometime he leaves them alone,
when he has folded the^, or brought them into a safe pasture, and sometimes he
commits the^ to his servant, or to some other to be kept in his absence.
The similitude of the eye and of the soul, in some points may be aptly
applied, but not in this of residence, for if either the eye be plucked out of
the head, or the soul separated from the body, neither of them both can be
restored again. But you must confess that there be causes why a pastor may be
absent from his flock without any such incurable danger: and therefore these
similitudes in these cases of absence hold not.

T. C. Page. 49. Sect. 5.
If any will here upon conclude, that they have no space given them to sleep,

show themselves diligent in continual feeding their flocks, and to fear the
judgment of God, before whom no feined, or colored excuse will stand. And so
I trust they will make no longer absence, than must needs, and if upon any
occasion at any time they be somewhat longer, that the same be not without the
leave of their Churches, whose they are, and which they for the Lord his sake
serve, and then also that in such rare and necessary absence Here you admit
cura^, which is contrary to your forme^ assertion.
they provide the^ of some able man to teach in the mean season, which the
Church by her governors will allow of.

Io. Whitgifte.
Yet such doubts would be directly resolved, for they seem something to
trouble you. And in very deed they cause you to overthrow whatsoever you have
hitherto gone about to build: for now you confess that the Pastor may be
absente of his own private business: if he have leave of his Parish, and if
he provide some able man to teach in the mean season. etc. I pray you let me
ask you a few questions: may not a man be as well absent for public affairs,
or at the commandment of the Prince or chief Magistrate, as he may be for
his own private business? Is not his flock in as great danger when their
Pastor is absent with their leave, as when he is absent without their leave? or
where do you find it in scripture, that the Pastor ought to ask leave of his
Parish, when he has occasion to be absent? Or how shall he get Page 42. etc.
an able man in the mean season, to teach his flock, when as you affirm,
that no man may be admitted into the ministry, except he have a certain
flock committed unto him. And that then it is not lawful for him to preach
out of his own cure? These questions would be answered, and these contrary
speeches of yours reconciled, if it be possible. For undoubtedly they do not
agree with your former talk.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 50. Sect. 3. 4. and Page 51. Sect. 1.
You say also that every flock had his shephearde or else shepherds. And to
prove that one flock had more shepherds, you cite Act. 14. which makes
nothing for your purpose: yet I deny not but one flock may have more Pastors,
for I see nothing in the word of God against it.

To be short, you say now they go fisking from place to place, and couetously
join living to living. etc. and being but one shepherd have many flocks. If
you mean by fisking from place to place, such as preach in diverse places, and
not in their own cures only, your phrase of fisking is to light and
scurrilous. When you allege any reason why men may not go from place to
place to preach, where they think it necessary, you shall either be
answered, or yielded to. In the mean time I think it agreeable both to Gods
word, and conscience.

Against couetously joining of living to living you allege the. 5. of Esaias,
which is far from your purpose: for the Prophet speaks there of such as
oppress the poor, and will not suffer them to have a place to dwell in: yet I
do not allow such as couetously join living to living, of what kind or
degree of men soever they be.

But I see no cause why one good and diligent Pastor may not rather be credited
with more flocks, than a slothful, unskillful, or negligent with one. You

manner, when they be distinct?

And heerevpon also is ended another question that the Answerer makes, whether
one may have many flocks, which is, whether one shepherd may be many
shepherds, one watcheman many watchemen. For if his residence be necessary in
one place, then he ought to content him self with one.

Io. Whitgifte.
My question is this: why one man may not as well have diverse parishes, when
they be distinct, as he may when they be joined together? for the compass, the
number, and the distance of place, is all one: you confess Pa. 34. lin. 10.
that the one may be, and the reformed Churches in France did so use it, where
(as I am credibly informed, and you before seem to affirm) six Towns or mo
were committed to one Pastor. This being lawful, I see not why the other
should not be so in like manner: neither have you answered to any one word in
this part.

to take but that living of all his flocks, which he now has of one,

Reader perceive what you omitted unanswered. But I will follow you, and
examine what Councels and other have thought of such as have more benefits

In the. 15. Canon of the Council of T. C. uses ^ most corrupt Council for
his defense.
Nice, it is commanded that no clearke should be placed in two Churches, and
he adds the reasons, whereof the first is, that it is a point of marchaundise,
Mat. 6.
and of filthy gain. The second, that (*) no man can serve two masters. The
third, 1. Cor. 7.
that every one ought to (*) tarry in that calling, wherein he is called.

Io. Whitgifte. T. C. alleges the second Council of Nice to dete^ mine
controversies.

It should seem that you would gladly make men believe, (and it is very like
that you your self are also persuaded) that this Council was the first Council
of Nice: For else why do you in the next section place Damasus, and name the
second tome of the Councels, when as Damasus was long time before this your
Council of Nice, and the same Council is in the second tome of the Councels.
Least therefore the Reader may be deceived, I let him to understand, that this
Canon here by you alleged, is a Canon of the second Council of Nice, holden
about Anno. 795. or. 781. and one of the corruptest Councels that ever was,
wherein not only praying to Saints, and adoring of Relics, but also
worshipping of Images. etc. was confirmed.

But yet let us examine this Canon of that Council. In the end of that same
The Canon of the second Council of Nice examined.
Canon it is thus written: Et haec quidem in hac regia ciuitate, in his autem
quae extra sunt locis, propter hominum inopiam permi^titur: And these things
are to be understood in this regal City: for in those places that be
without, it is permitted for the scarsi^ie of persons. Whereby it is plain,
that the meaning of the Canon is, that no one man should have committed unto
him mo great cities than one: but that he might have mo towns or villages
committed to his charge, it is manifest by those words of that Canon that I
have rehearsed. And therefore Gratian himself does thus expound that Canon:
Sed duae ecclesiae intellig untur ecclesiae duaru^ ciuitatu^, in quibus nullus
debet conscribi: But by two Cause. 21. q. 1. Clericus.
churches are meant the churches of two cities, wherein no man ought to be
appointed. And for the proof thereof he alleges this Canon of the Council of
Calcedon: Clericu^ in duarum ecclesijs ciuitatu^ conscribi non oportet: A
Clearke may not be appointed in the Churches of two cities. And the Gloss upon
that place says: that one man may be entitled in two Churches, if the
Churches be poor: or if the Bishop do dispense and think it convenient, or
if the number of Clearkes be few: or if he be entitled to the one, and have
the other in commenda^, or if the one be near to the other. And the authority
of this Gloss is as sufficient as the credit of that Council of Nice, if the
Canon did not expound it self. I omit the absurd allegation of the
Striptures to confirm this their purpose. For the place Mat. 6. is to be
understood of contrary masters: and that in the. 1. Cor. 7. of the kind of
vocation, and not of the place. He that does his duty in mo places, is
lawfully called to them all, as I have said before.

to the intent that they might the sooner fulfill their inordinate lusts.

Io. Whitgifte.
You are deceived: it is in the first tome of Councels, and therefore the more
like it is, that you take the former Council to be the first Council of Nice:
But such dealing is usual with you: if you had meant plainly, you would have
said, the second Council of Nice, and not simply the Council of Nice, which
argues either that you were deceived your self, or else sought to deceive
others.

This place of Damasus is nothing at all to your purpose, which you might
easily Damasus alleged to a wrong purpose.
have perceived, if you had red that Epistle. For he only there speaks
against such as were called Chorepiscopi, who were in degree inferior to
Bishops, and yet did they despise to be counted no better than Priests. There
were certain Bishops in Damasus time, that gave them selves wholly to
idleness and pleasure, and committed their office to such, as were called
Chorepiscopi, as it is evident in that Epistle: neither does he mean any
other charge than consecrating of Priests, Deacons, and virgins, imposition of
hands, blessings, erecting of aulters, dedicating of Churches, and such like,
which were taken properly to perteyne to the Bishop, and yet notwithstanding
was by some Bishops passed over to such Chorepiscopi. This negligence of
bishops in such matters Damasus co^de^neth, together with ye office of
Chorepiscopus. And this is the whole drifte of Damasus in that Epistle, as it
is most evident. And therefore says Leo (as Gratian reports) Did. 68. Hi
(meaning chorepiscopi) propter Distinct. 68.
insolentiam suam, qua officia episcoporum sibi vsurpant, ab ecclesia prohibiti
sunt: These men for their insolency, whereby they usurp the offices of
Bishops, are excluded from the Church. So that here is not one word in this
whole Epistle against Curates, and such as Page 50. lin. ^*
are left to supply the Pastors absence. Moreover you your self in the
beginning of this page confess, that a man being absent may leave his Deputy
in his place. But yet here you have forgotten your purpose, that is, to prove
that one man may not have more benefices: in which cause also it appears that
you are destitute of proofs, being compelled to use only corrupt authorities?

Whether it were better that one diligent Pastor should have many flocks, than
a negligent and unskillful Pastor one, is not the question: for we say neither
is lawful, nor ought to be done.

Io. Whitgifte.
You say much, but prove little. I think it much better that one man have
diverse, than that any should be untaught. For I speak of that time wherein
there is not a competent number of preachers to be had for all places.

It passes to see how you have dismembered my book, even of purpose to avoid
the answering of diverse things, and even very here you have omitted one
principal point. For I ask also this question, why that Parishes being
distinct, may not as well be committed to one man, as the same might be, if
they were made all one, as you would have them? for the distance of places,
and the number of persons is not altered: only the ease of the Pastor, and
greater pains of the people is procured. For whereas the Pastor before came to
them, now must they take pains to come to him. But such things you will not
voutsafe the answering, because in deed you can not.

them? did not Dionisius a Monk, and Pope of Rome? for it is thus written of
him, Tom. 1. conci. Dionisius Monacbus Papa presbyteris ecclesias diuisit, and
coemiteria, parochiasque and Dioeceses constituit: Dionisius a Monk and Pope
divided to Priests Churches and Churcheyardes, and appointed Parishes and
Dioces.

T. C. Page. 50. Sect. 6. 7.
Do you believe that, which you set down of Denis the Monk and Pope, that he
devised and divided parishes? If you do not, why would you have us believe
it? If the law does condemn him that turns a blind man out of the way, or
lays a block before him, what does it him, which would put out the eyes of
them that see their way already? I have showed, and Assertions without proof*
the matter is plain, that the Lord divided national Churches into parishes
and congregations. So that if S. Paul have not the word of parish, yet he
has the thing. And those that have read stories, know that (...) (which we
call a Diocese, and which conteyneth with us numbers of parishes) was at the
first, taken to be the same that parish is, and used a great while before
Denis was borne, or munkerie begotten.

And as for Coemeteria or Churcheyardes, if you mean those places that lie
next round about the Churches, as they came in with the Monk, they might well
have gone out with him, for any profit either to the Church, or common wealth
by them. But if you mean as the Greek word, which is there used, signifies,
a fit place where the bodies of men sleep, and are buri^, attending the time
of their rising up again in the iaste and general day of judgment, then
these Churcheyardes were in the time of the Law, and in the primitive Church

especially when the Church had quietness and peace; that it might without

for the preservation of the Towns and Cities in their health, as also for that
through the superstition, which has been of being buried rather in the
Church, than in the Churcheyarde, in the Chauncell rather than in the Church,
nearer the high altar, than further of the remnauntes whereof are in a great
number of men's hearts yet, which might much be helped by the bringing in of
that custom again, of burying the dead in some honest place out of the town
thereto appointed.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have told you my Author, and if you will not credit one witness, you

have more. Denis himself does testify it in an Epistle that he writ to
Seuerus a Bishop. Damasus says the same, so does Marianus Scotus, Platina,
and others. Polidor Uirgill does something plainly open the matter in these
words: Pol. Virg. lib. 4. c. 9. de invent.
Circiter annum Domini. 267. Dionisius tam presbyteris vrbis Romae, quam
aliarum gentium templa, coemiteria and parochias quas dicunt, diuisit:
Praeterea Episcopis dioecaeses distribuit, mandauitque, vt vnusquisque suis
finibus ac limitibus contentus esset: Parochias (vt hoc demonstremus) nostri
appellant singula templa Dioecesis, and eorum territorium certis terminis
distinctum. etc. About the. 267. year of our Lord, Dionisius divided Churches,
Churcheyardes, and Parishes (as they call them) as well to the Priests of Rome,
as of other nations: furthermore he distributed Diocese unto Bishops, and
commanded that every one should content himself with his own bounds and
limits: our men call Parishes (that we may make this plain) the several
Churches of a Diocese, and their territory limited within certain bounds.
etc. Wherefore take heed least you cast dust in your own eyes, and blind your
self: for this of Denis is not denied of any that I can read.

Where has the Lord divided national Churches into parishes and
congregations? Why do you not note the place? or where has S. Paul the
thing, though not the word or name? or what stories say, that (...) was
taken to be the same that we call now a parish? Here is much spoken, but
nothing proved.

This Denis was Bishop of Rome about the year of our Lord. 263. which

you have not considered. But to put all this matter out of doubt, and to open
that (the ignorance whereof makes you so hot in this matter) there was
diverse congregations and Churches in the Apostles time, but yet was there not
any limitation of place, or certain compass of ground certaynely appointed:
for that was left to the discretion of man to enlarge, or to contracte, as it
should be thought from time to time most convenient: and who can once imagine
or suppose that Christ, or his Apostles did appoint the limittes of Diocese or
Parishes? or who knows it not, that it is in the power of such as have
authority, to enlarge or diminishe Dioces or Parishes, as they shall see it
expedient. I know nothing to the contrary, but that the Parish, whose bonds
and limits be but one mile compass, may be made ten mile compass, and
contrariwise. It is well said of one, that distributio gregis nunc extenditur,
nunc coarctatur pro hominis arbitrio: The distribution of a flock is sometime
enlarged, and sometime made less, according to the judgment of man. And this
matter needs not to seem so strange unto you, for if you had bin so
diligent a reader of the book of Acts and Monumentes, as you boast your self
to be, then might you have read there, that the Council of Nice did appoint
to certain Bishops the limittes and bounds of their Provinces and Dioces. But
what should I labor in a matter so manifest?

If by Coemiteria or Churcheyardes those places be meant that be about the
churches, where we use to bury the dead (as it is most like they be) then
hear I no reason at all Why you should in such manner speak of them, except
you will pluck down whatsoever has beforetyme been appointed, be it never
so ancient, and the use thereof convenient and necessary. There is no doubt
but by Coemiteria are meant places of burial, which because they have been
(as you confess) at all times certain, especially in the peace of the
Church, it is meet that they should so still remain. And for as much as
the places now used, if they were appointed by Denis (as it is most like) are
fitly appointed, and most conveniently in most places, you have alleged no
cause as yet, why they should be removed, but the self same cause, that may
be in like manner used to remove the Church, and whatsoever else has been
devised by any man, be it otherwise never so necessary, convenient, or comely.

But I will not follow you in these digressions, where you only spend paper
with words void of proof. If you quote Eusebius. 7. Lib. 13. to prove that
the place of burial was in the fields, there can be no such thing gathered
of his words: and if you quote him to prove that the word signifies a place
of burial, you go about to prove that, which no man denies.

If you should beget, and be a father of many books, and all your children
like their eldest brother, you would (without better advise) shake many
grounds of our religion. For here again you wish that all pastors were able
to teach, but that being impossible (as the state is now) you are content
with Pastors or ministers, that can do nothing but read. You throughout your
whole book make this a marvelous good estate, and always turn the best side
outward, and when men go about to urge the deformities thereof, to the end
they might be remedied, then you lay open the shame and nakedness of it, and
make it greater, than it is in deed. For as I have showed before, the Church
stands not so much in need of your reading ministers, as you would make the
world believe. And although it be a great deformity, and sore plague of the
Church, which you here speak of, and confess at unawares, yet you will let
no man come near to heal it. There be some make a gain by sores, and sore
legs, and therefore they have a medicine to keep their wounds always
green, that they should not heal.

I hope you do not of purpose keep the Church in this estate, but this I dare
say, that the chief of your gain, and of your honor, consists and is
grounded in the ruins of the Church, and therefore I desire you to took unto
it.

Io. Whitgifte.
I omit whatsoever you here speak against my person, for I am purposed to
abstain The causes of the lack of able ministers.
from requiting you in like sort, only I will answer for my self where you
labor to slander me. The cause of lack of a sufficient number of meet
ministers in this Church, is neither the religion professed, nor the government
that is used, nor yet the governors: But partly the cruelty of the times
past, wherein numbers of meet ministers have bin consumed: partly the un
willingness of me^ in this present time, which have not that zeal to enter
into this calling, that is to be wished: and partly (nay chiefly and
principally) you and your schisms, which have caused some to cast off their
ministry wholly, some to forsake their pastoral charges, and yet to keep
their Prebendes and other livings: some to deprave the ministry, condemn it,
and by all means possible alienate as many from it, as they can. And therefore
nothing that I confess of the scarsitie of meet and able ministers,
derogateth any thing either from the doctrine professed in this Church, or from
the kind of government, or the Magistrates: but rather commends the same,
because notwithstanding all the former impediments, yet has it a number of
excellent ministers, and does continually breed mo.

If any confession tend to the condemnation of any, it is of you and your
adherents, who have more hindered and slaundered the Gospel in this realm of
England, than the Papists either have done, or could possibly do. And I am
fully persuaded, that one of the greatest deformities suffered in this Church,
is lack of discipline toward you, who be so far from healing any sore in
the Church, that the more you be suffered, the greater do you wound it: And
in very deed the reformation you pretend, is nothing but a mere confusion,
or rather subversion both of the Church and common wealth also.

My honor and gain is but very small, yet it is more, than I am worthy of,
but I trust the time will come, when as such boiling affections uttered in so
spiteful a manner, will be made manifest: and I pray God it be not imputed unto
you in that day. If my houour and gain be other than may stand with the good
and prosperous estate of the church, I am ready to yield it up whenever I
shall by due authority be required. In the mean time, God be judge betwixt
you and me.

But what if the estate of the Church be such, as you speak of, that it will
scarce yield three preaching Pastors and Bishops in some Diocese, may you
therefore make reading ministers? In deed if the Apostle had made this a
council only, and no commandment, that Pastors of churches should be able to
teach, then your saying might have been borne.

But seeing that S. Paul has commanded expressedly, that he should be able to
teach, and Tim. 1. 3.
to convince the gaynsayers, I would learn of you gladly, what necessity
there is, which can Tit. 1.
cause a man to break the moral law of God, to bring in a tradition of man.
You may as well break any other commandment of God for necessities sake, as
break this, being comprehended in the first table.

And tosay that these that can only read, must be tolerated in the Church as
ministers, is to say because you can have no Pastors in the Churches, you will
have idols, for so will I not doubt to call them, although through ignorance
of that which they do, some may be good men. But yet in respect of the place
that they occupy, they are idols, for they stand for that, and make show of
that which they are not, and admit you them as often as you will, the Lord
pronounces that they shall be no ministers to him, which have no *knowledge.
Qzee. 6.


But let us hear your reason It is your own reason.
there must be reading in the church, therefore there must be ministers, which
can do nothing else. Then we may reason thus to. There must be breaking of
bread, and distributyng of the cup in the Church, and pouring on water,
therefore whosoever is able to break aloafe of bread, or to lift a cup of wine,
or to pour on water on the body of the child, may be made a minister.

And did you never read, yt there were readers in the Church, when there were
no reading ministers? But of that of reading of the scriptures and prayers in
the Church there will be a fitter place to speak afterward, where it shall be
showed how unjustly you surmise these things of them*

Touching Homilies shall be spoken more hereafter, where further occasion is
given.

Io. Whitgifte.
Saint Paul. 1. Tim. 3. and Tit. 1. shows what qualities a Bishop or a
Pastor ought to have: but he does not say, that if none can be found, or not a
sufficient number, in whom all these qualities do concur, that then the
Church shall rather be destitute of ministers, than have such: for there were
in his time that swarued from this rule, and yet was he glad they preached.

Of the ministers of this Church of England, though diverse be ignorant, yet
inaye they by study and diligente readyng of the Scriptures, Catechismes,
Homilies, and other godly and necessary books so profit in knoweledge, that
although they be not able publicly to preach, yet may they be able
privately to exhort, and otherwise also by Readyng the Scriptures and
Homilies, according to the order appointed, greatly profit the people of God.
But what should I contend with you in this matter? This Church of England in
this point professes nothing, that is not allowed by the general Confession
of the Churches in Heluetia, from the which I think you will not dissente.
That Confession as I told you before, has these words:

We condemn all unmeet ministers, not endued with gifts necessary for a
shepherd Confess. Heluet.
that should feed his flock: howbeit we acknowledge that the harmless
simplicity of some shepheardes in the old church, did sometimes more profit
the church, than the great exquisite, and fine or delicate, but a little to
proud learning of some others. Wherefore we reject not nowadays the good
simplicity of certain, so that they be not altogether unskillful of God and
his word. There is nothing in that. 6. of Ozee that serves your turn. You
say, that I reason thus: There must be readyng in the Church, therefore
there must be Ministers that can do nothing else. You know what is written
Sapi. 1. Os quod mentitur. etc. The mouth that speaks lies, slays the
soul. etc. I would it were not so usual with you. My argument is this, that
for somuche as there can not be a sufficient number of preachers to furnish
this church of England in all places, therefore there may be reading ministers;
that is such ministers as by reading the scriptures and other books appointed
unto them, may profit ye people and instruct them, for reading is necessary in
the Church. etc. This is my reason. That which you use is a child of your own
begetting, it is none of mine, as the Reader can not choose but perceive. The
reason that follows of breaking bread and distributing the cup. etc. is used
but for a jest, which ought not to be in serious matters, and therefore I leave
it to them that are disposed to laugh, when they should rather weep.

I know there were readers of old in the Church, but they had not authority
to administer the sacraments, as our ministers have, and of necessity must
have, and Tract. 9. ca. 2. the. 2. division.

causes, which I have before mentioned, but yet I can not but speak of this
place of saint Luke, for fear of the danger that may ensue. For if this be a
good reason, ye the place of S. Luke may not be used to prove that preaching is
perpetually annexed to the ministry, because in yt same place is made mention
of curing of diseases, which is but a temporal thing, and followed the
ministry, but for a time, then the commandment of S. James, *that the elders
of the Church should James. 5.
pray for those that are sick, is now no commandment, because putting on of
hands, and anointing of them, that they might recover their health, has no
place, and by this means you will pull from us as many places of the new
testament, as you did before of the old.

Io. Whitgifte.
You would no doubt maintey^ all their places, if you could: for the quotations
be the substance of that book, and the thing that most persuaded the Reader,
which credited al things there written without examination, and thought it must
of necessity be true, being so confirmed by the scriptures. And surely you
could not have greatlier condemned the authors of that Admonition, than in
suffering so many quotations of theirs to pass without defense. For what
wickedness can there be greater, than to abuse the Scriptures in maynteyning
of sects and errors.

The place of Luke is not answered: the words of the text be these: and he
sent Luke. 9.
them to preach the kingdom of God, and to cure the sick. etc. No man living
can conclude of this place, the one more, than he can do the other, and your
words be but your own: There be other places a number that be more general
than this, to prove preaching by: this was peculiar and proper to the
disciples, as the whole circumstances of the place declare, for they are also
commanded to take nothing with them in their journey, neither staves. etc. To
preach is perpetual, but it can not be gathered of this place, that none ought
to be admitted into the ministry but such as can preach, because it was
peculiarly spoken to the Apostles, as the other circumstances do prove. The
commandment of Saint James is general, for he tells what all sick men
ought to do, and the ministers likewise that resort to the sick, and
therefore though the anointing with oil, which was a sign of the gift of
healing, be taken away because the gift is ceased, yet does praying remain
still, and is perpetual, and not only proper to some ministers of the
Church, but common to all. Wherefore the places be not like: the one being
spoken peculiarly to the disciples, the other generally to all ministers.

his cure, he may not do it without my Lords license.

Where the word of God is professed, and Christian magistrates govern, there it
is mete that no man should take upon him any function except he be by the
Magistrate, (to whom it does appertein) thereunto admitted: And forasmuch as
there be always in the church hypocrites, heretics, schismatikes, and other
evil disposed persons, which study for nothing more than to disquiet the state
of the church, and to occupy the people with their factions, it is necessary
that none should be admitted to preach in any place, without he be thereunto
licenced by the Bishop, who ought to have a diligent care in that matter.

I suppose you are not of that mind, that men may now in this Church under
Christian magistrates preach without license: it has always bin the opinion of
wise, learned, and godly men, that since the Apostles time, none were
ordinarily called to the office of preaching, but such as were called of God by
man: only Anabaptists, and some other sect of heretics teach the contrary.

men, to whom it does perteyne.

Their complaint is, that those which are ordained Pastors, and therefore to
preach, can not do it without further license: as if a man should be charged
to do a thing forthwith, and then he that charge him, binds him hand and
foot, that he can not do it unless he will lose him.

The bishops inhable him to teach, and point him a place to teach in, and yet
they will not let him teath* unless he have a further license. It h^be an
heretik or schismatike, or suspected of any such thing* why is he admitted, or
being admitted, why is he suffered to be so much as a reader ^n y^ churche^ and
because you could not answer this, therefore you set up a fancy of yours to
confute. And thus you fight without an (...), and you make triumphs, where
there is no victory.

They will say unto you, yt not only under a godly magistrate, but not in ye
time of persecution any man ought to ^ake upon him any function in ye church*
unless he be there unto called by me^, except he have a wonderful calling,
which is rare, and must be ^iligently examined by them, which have it, (...)

in: so far they are from the frensy of Anaba^tists, which you by a confutation
of ye, which they never affirmed, would seem to stain them with.

Io. Whitgifte.
This Repl^e consists partly of equivocations, and partly of (...)
suppositio^s. For where you say, ye no man should put himself into the office of
preaching, without the approbation of those men, to who^ it does apertein: you
speak ambiguously, and therefore you must explicate what you mean by those to
who^ it does apertein: whether ye people and seniors, as you call them, or ye
bishops or ye civil Magistrate, or such, to who^ ye civil Magistrate does commit
ye judging of such matters. For ye Auabaptistes confess ye they must be called
of their churches, but they deny ye authority of the civil magistrate herein,
and the authority of such also as he does (...) for yt end and purpose. Again,
you here suppose, yt no man may preach out of his own cure, and therefore being

suppose that none may be admitted to preach, except he have (...): to be

being suspected, by and by removed out of the ministry* all which
suppositio^s be^e vntiue, and therefore this Replis full of great absuraities.
Their meaning is plain, that though there be just cause, why the Bishop
should inhibite them from preaching, both for their contentions, and also for
their errors, yet would they preach whether the Bishop will or no, for the
case is their own. They were admytted to preach in their cures, and
elsewhere, so long as they used them selves modestlye, quietly, and taught
sound doctrine: but after they began to divide the Church, and make
contention in it, they were restrained from preaching until such time, as
upon their submission and reformation, they should be there unto admitted
again: hinc illae lachrymae, this is the matter, and hereto you answer, ne
gry quidem.

Of the apparel of Ministers. Tract. 7.
The causes why they refuse the apparel, examined.
Chap. 1. the first Division.
T. C. Page. 52. Sect.. 3.
The cappe, the surplis, and tippet, are not the greatest matters we strive
for, which notwithstanding has been informed to the Churches beyond sea, to
the end that the judgments of some might be the easlyer had against us.
Howbeit we think it an attire unmeet for a minister of the Gospel to wear,
and the Surplis especially more than the other two, because such hurtefull
Ceremonies are so much more dangerous, as they do approach nearer the
service* or worship of God,

Io. Whitgifte.
Yet in the beginning such was your pretense: neither was there any thing
else that you contended for: as it is well known to all men that had to deal
with you, or heard of you. I am certainly persuaded, that if the Churches
beyond sea did fully understand your proceeding, together with the state of
this Church of England, that they would as bitterly write against you, and
as willingly condemn you, as ever they did the Anabaptists. But to your
reasons against the apparel.

Chap. 1. the second Division.
T. C. Page 52. Sect. 4.
The causes why we are loathe to meddle with them, are not as many are borne in
hand, This assertion is contrary to your practice. Monumentes of idolatry may
be used if they have any profit.
because that we think any pollution so to stick to the things themselves, as
that the wearyng of them had any such power to pollute and make unclean the
users of them: Neither yet only because the Papists have superstitiously used
them, but because they having been abhominably avnsed by them, have no use nor
profit in those things or ends, wherein and whereunto they are now used.
And further, that they are also hurtful, being monuments of Idolatry, where as
to bring them in and establishe them, it behooves that there should some
manyfeste profit of them appear. For it is not enough to say, it is
indifferent in the own nature, Ergo meet to be done: but as the
circumstaunces of the times and persons, and profit or hurt of our brethren
do require or not require, so must it be done or not be done. For in these
things which are called indifferent, God will have the use of them to be
measured, that it be referred first to his glory, then to the profit of
others.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is true that is commonly said: that such as be in error neither long
agree with other, neither yet with themselves. Some of you have taught, that
pollution does stick to the things them selves, as that the wearyng of them
had power to pollute and make unclean the wearoes: and a number be carried away
with that doctrine: else why do they refuse to come to our Churches, our
sermons, yea to keep us company, or to salute us? why spitte they in our
faces, revile us in the streates, and show such like villainy unto us, and
that only because of our apparel? Is not all this a manifest declaration that
they think us therewith to be so polluted, that what so ever we speak or do
is polluted, in like manner, even the word of God and his sacraments? and
where have they learned this, but of you and others your partners? Likewise
what was the chief ground of this opinion, how did you move the people to
this extremity, and what have they yet to speak in the defense of their
excessive raging? forsoothe that this gear came from the Pope, was invented by
Antichriste, and therefore abominable, and not to be used. This only reason
they have, and this is the common place that you have hitherto bette upon. But
now being convinced by manifest reasons, and seeing the manyfolde
absurdities, that wayteth upon such assertions, you pass over the matter as
though you had never been stained with it, and say the causes why you are
loathe to meddle with them, are not as The apparel not refused because the
Papists use it.
many are borne in hand. etc. So that in effect this is now by you confessed,
that those things which the Papists have superstitiously used, yea which
they have abhominably abused, if they have any use or profit en those things
or ends, wherein and whereunto they are now used, be lawful, and not to be
refused. And therefore we must (I think) have no more to do with this
Argument: The Pope invented them, Ergo, they are not to be used: but this
must be the question, whether they have any use or profit in those things
or ends, wherein or whereunto they are now used. And this shifte is invented
to take away all objections, which may be of Churches, of Bells, of
Pulpits, and such like.

But let us proceed to the reasons. You have not yet proved that they have no
use, or that they profit not in those things and ends, wherein and whereunto
they are now used: and therefore I will take that for no reason as yet:
although I have sufficientely answered unto it, where I have spoken of
Ceremonies, and in this treatise also that follows Tract. 2.
of this matter.

You say further that they are also hurtefull, being monumentes of Idolatry.
etc. Whereby you acknowledge that notwithstanding they be monumentes of
idolatry, yet may they be brought in and established if some manyfeste
profit of them appear, so that this also is granted, that monuments of
idolatry may be brought in and established upon this condition, if they be
profitable.

That which follows in this portion of your reply touching things
indifferent, I consent unto, with this prouiso, that it is not every man's part
in the Church to judge and determine, what the circumstance of the times and
persons makes profitable or hurtful (for then should we never be quiet) but
theirs only, to whom the government of the Church is committed: to the which
prouiso if you do consent, we are in this matter thus far agreed.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page. 52. Sect. 4. 5.
Now, that they are not profitable and hurtful, it also may appear, if we
consider them by all the kinds of men in the realm.

The Papists are either stubborn or weak, and in respect of both these, they
cannot be but hurtful. The weak I call those that have made some step from
popery to the gospel, and of whom there is good hope that they may be fully
gotten to the Gospel: but these are harmed by the use of these vestiments, for
they take occasion of falling at them, because they think that the sacraments
get reverence by them, and the ministry is commended by such apparel wearing,
and think that the sacraments want something of that they should have, if they
be not used: Whereupon are hard oftentimes these voices: I will not communicate
unless he wear a surplis. But this offense and occasion of falling is
confirmed by the use of these garments, therefore in respect of such men, they
are hurtful.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is spoken without proof, and it is very untrue that the weak Papist
is hurt in any respect by wearing this apparel: they take such garments as
things perteyning to comeliness and order, and so ought they to do. Neither
did I ever in my life hear that these garments hindered one jot any from
coming to the gospel. But admit all this were true (as it is most untrue)
why should it not as well by doctrine and teaching be removed, as other
superstitious opinions be in these things, which you can be content still to
remain.

These voices, I will not communicate, unless he wear a surplis, may
sometimes come upon just cause, when the good subject sees the minister which
ought to be an example of obedience, stubburnly and wilfully show example to
the contrary: and sometime it may come of waywardness when men be disposed to
contend: but surely I do not think that any man, which is persuaded to
communicate with us in the Sacraments, can think that they be either the
better or the worse for the external habit of the minister. They be dissuaded
from far greater matters than that, and therefore it is not to be thought
that they will stick in such trifles. But ad^t it were so, is it not as great
an error to think that the Sacraments be polluted with the apparel, as it
is to think, that they want somethyng, which they should have, if the
apparel be lacking? Yes truly: and therefore to take away both the errors, I
think it most convenient, the apparel be used, and these errors by doctrine
to be confuted.

Chap. 1. the fourth Division.
T. C. Page 52. Sect. 6.
Again, although I have knowledge, and know that the wearing of a surplisse

Io. Whitgifte.

grounds in Scripture, (such I mean as command obedience to superiors) to
prove the wearing of the surplis to be lawful, then were it some thing that
you say. But seeing such only be offended therewith as account themselves
most strong, and condemn other of infirmity: seeing also that obedience to
Magisirates in such^ indifferent things, has manifest grounds in scripture,
and to doubt of obedience in such matters, is in eff^cte, to pluck the
Magistrate his sword out of his hand, this reason has not so much as any
similitude of probability in it. Is there any minister of the Church, (for of
such only is the Surplis required) that will rather be moved to wear a
surplis, by the example of an other, than by the consideration of his duty
toward the law, and (...) of the Church, by due authority in a lawful and
indifferent thing appointed? you might make the same reason serve to pluck
down the Church, the Pulpit, the Belles, yea to overthrow all orders, and
all laws in things indifferent, which all have the same ground of obedience
that the surplis has.

In the Conf^ssion of the Dutche Church in London, which is allowed by the
Things indifferent change their nature be^g commanded or forbidden, Confess.
Ec^les. Belgiog^rman.
Church of GENEVA, and diverse other reformed Churches (whereof I have made
mention before) it is thus written of things indifferent: Things otherwise
indifferent of themselves, after a sort change their nature, when by some
comma^ndement they are either commanded or forbidden, because neither they can
be omitted contrary to the commandment, if they be once commanded neither
done, contrary to the prohibition, if they be prohibited, as it appears in
the Ceremonial law. So that the ground why a man should wear the surplis
(being an indifferente thing as you confess it to be) can not be unknown to
any, but such as know not the ground of their obedience toward authority.

It is true, that in some things indifferent a man must have respect to the
weakness In what kind of (...) things we ^ughte to have a resp^ct of the

of his brother, and absteyne from doing that, which he might lawfully do,
rather than to off^nde his brother. But that is in such indifferente things,
as be not by any law commanded or forbidden, but left free to every man to
do, or not to do: As, if to wear the Surplis, were by no law commanded, but
left to every man's own disposition: then surely if there were any weak
offended with the wearyng of it, I ought to absteyne for the weak his sake:
but being by lawful authority commanded to wear it, if I should refuse so
to do, I should offend against the Magistrate, and against God, who by his
Apostle has given this commandment, omnis anima potestatibus. etc. let every
soul be subi^ct to the higher power Romans 1^.
etc. which is to be understood in all things, that are not against God. And
therefore if any man be offended with me in so doing, the offense is taken it is
not given.

Chap. 1. the fifth Division.
T. C. Page. 52. Sect. vlt.
Again for the stubborn Papists, they take hereupon occasion to speak evil
of, and to bl^spheme the truth of the gospel, saying that our religion cannot
stand by itself, unless it lea^e upon the staff of their ceremonies, and
persuade themselves that those were very well devised by their Popes, that they
that are their ^nimies to their religion, cannot be without. And herv^on they
^ake occasion to hope that their other trumper^e and baggage will in the and
come in again, which ca^seth them to be more frosen in their wickedness, and
shut their ears unto the truth, which possibly they would hear, if all hope
of bringing in of their Popery were cut off.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is but a mere fancy: for first, it was brought into the Church before
their Popes whom they hold upon, invaded that seat, as it is afterward
declared. Secondly, they be not matters that they make any great account of.
Thirdly, they know fullwell, that we could be without them: and that we (but
only for obedience sake) do not much esteem of them. Wherefore this is an
argument framed only upon light conjectures. But beit all this were true,
shall we for their fancy or fond judgment refuse to do that, which is
lawful, which we may d^, and which we are bound to do? Or in making orders for
the Church, must we enquire what their opinion will be? Then pluck down
Churches* etc. for of them they make a greater reck^ning, than they do of the
surplisse, or any other such like matter. I think verily that there is not one
Papist in England that does take occasion upon any thing retained in this
Church, to hope that their other trumperie and baggage will in the end come in
^gayne: neither is there any cause in respect of them, why they should so hope:
and if they do, yet I doubt not but that they shall hoppe without that hope.
But a man may imagine if he will that there is a man in the Moon, with a tree
on his back. etc. and you cannot let him.

And let it be observed that throughout the realm there are none that make
such clamours, and outcries, and complaints for these ceremonies, as they and
those, that they suborne. They pretend I confe^se, the Queens maiestres
Imunctions, and (...) unto them, but who is so blind as sees not that they
have another meaning. For I appeal unto the consciences of all that know
them, whether they do it for any obedience toward hi^ majesty, whose death
should be a thousand times better news unto them, than her graces marriage.

Io. Whitgifte.
The more is the pity, that they should have such i^st cause of clamoring,
and that The clamors of Papists should mo^ the ministers to more circumspection.
those which should teach them obedience to God and their Prince, be examples
to the contrary. A subtle and crafty Papist will be glad of any cause of
quarelling: the more circumspect therefore ought the minister to be, in taking
heed lest he give just cause of the same. But there be honest, godly, and
zealous men also that cannot abide s^che disorder and contempt, whom
peradventure you would gladly strain with the note of Papistrie, as your
manner is: and for my part I think it to be the part of all dutiful subi^cts
to keep laws and orders appointed, and to see other keep them also, if they
be thereunto called.

Surely he that is a Papist indeed, cannot wish well to her (...), but if he
communicate with us in the sacraments, hear the word preached, and come to our
Churches, I will think and hope the best of him. But if he refuse so to do (as
there be di^ers such) so long as he so continues, I must count him an enemy
to religion, to the Church, and to the Prince, be he Papist, Anabaptist, or
whatsoever. For he that in heart and in deed misliketh the religion, cannot
like well of such as maintain the same.

Chap. 1. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page. 53. Sect. 1.
There are also numbers of those, which have all Antichristianitie in such
detestation, that they cannot abide the least scrappe of it, and when they see
the ministers wear them, they are grieved in their hearts, and they begin
somewhat to fear, least this communicating with the Papists in apparel,
should make some way to those which use them, the easier to admit other
things, when they should be likewise commanded. And these brethrens minds are
not to be lightly grieved, and the ministers, if they think to profit them,
must cut away all occasion, whereby they may have an evil opinion of them.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin in his book against the Anabaptists after he had spoken some thing
against The purity which can abide no imper fection, is devilish.
the Puritanes and Donatists, has this saying worthy to be noted: Here
therefore we may be admonished, that when as under the pretense of the study of
perfection, we can tolerate no imperfection, either in the body or in the
members of the Church, that then the Devil does make us swell with pride, and
does seduce us by hypocrisy, that he might provoke us to forsake the flock
of Christ: knowing assuredly that he does obtain the victory, when he draws
us from the same. For seeinge yther remission of sins or health, is in no
other place, although we outwardly bear the countenance of an Angelical
conversation, yet if we do with such boldness separate ourselves from the
Christian fellowship, we are become Devils. If this be to be feared in such as
show this prepostorous zeal against that which is blameworthy, what shall we
think of those that under the pretense of zeal deface the minister, and the
word that he preaches, for doing that which is lawful, and the which of
duty he ought to do. If the minister should apply himself to please the
people, and such especially of whom you seem to speak in this place, his
greatest study had need to be how to transform himself daily into a new
shape. But most certain it is that you study to much to please the people: And
that is the occasion of so many novelties, whereby they are most commonly
delighted, est natura hominis nouitatis auida.

T. C. Page. 53. Sect. 2.
Seeing that therefore this kind of Ceremonies in apparel, harden the hearts of
the Papists, and cause them to be the stiffer in their popery, hinder the
weak from profyting in the knowledge of the Gospel, grieve the minds of the
godly, are occasion of an evil opinion unto them of their ministers, we think
that these ceremonies are to be removed, as not only not profitable (which they
ought to be) but hurtful, if not to the ministers themselves that use them,
yet to their people to whom they are commanded by God to have regard unto, in
these things that are indifferent in their own natures. Now I will come to
that, which you set down.

Io. Whitgifte.
Seeing that not one word of that is true: and if it were, yet the error and
false persuasion of the mind rather to be reformed, than relented unto, I see
no cause why this kind of apparel (being commanded) ought not to be used,
except you will leave to every man liberty to do what him list, or suffer the
fancies of some to rule Prince, Council, Bishops, Church and all.

Answer to the Admonition. Page. 53. Sect. vlt. and. Page 54. Sect. 1. 2.
To prove that in those days ministers were known by voice learning, Uayne and
childish all^gations.
and doctrine, you cite the ninth of the first of Samuel: and the 26. of
Matthew. In all that ninth Chapter of Samuel, there is not one word that makes
for this purpose, except you mean this, that when Saul asked of Samuel where
the Seers house was, Samuel answered again that he was the Seer: If this be
to be known by voice, learning, and doctrine, the ignorantest minister that
is, may soon be known by his voice, learning, and doctrine: for if you ask
him, where is such a man, he can answer you, I am he. In the. 26. of Matthew the
first place, verse. 48. is this, Now he that betrayed him, had given them a
token, saying, whosoever I shall kiss, that is he, lay hold on him. The
multitude that came with Judas, knew christ by Judas kissing of him, therefore,
in those days ministers were known by voice, learning, and doctrine. The
second place in that Chapter alleged, verse. 73. is this. They that stood by
said unto Peter, surely thou art also one of them: for even thy speech
bevvrayeth thee. Peter was suspected by his speech to be a Galilean, and
therefore one of Christ's Apostles, Ergo a minister was then known by voice,
learning, An argument retorted upon the adversary
and doctrine. You may as well of that place gather thus. Peter preached not
Christ the^, but denied him, Ergo a minister must be known by denying of
christ. Lord God, what dare not these me^ allege for their purpose.

I know that the chief tokens whereby a minister ought to be known is
doctrine and learning: but you childishly abuse the scripture, and play with
the same.

Now you say, ministers must be discerned from other, by Popish A minister may
be known by his apparel.
and Antichristian apparel, as cappe, gown, tippet. etc. Do you think that
because a minister ought to be known by his voice, learning, and doctrine,
therefore he may not be also known by his apparel. John the Baptist had
peculiar apparel, and was known by it: Christ had distinct apparel from
other, for his coat had never a seame.

T. C. Page 53. Sect. 3. 4.
The places alleged by the Admonition, with others, which may be cited,
howsoever you deride them are ^otwithstanding probable conie^ctures They were
quoted by the Admonition to prove that ministers were known by voice,
learning, and doctrine, and you transfer them to apparel.
that ^eyther Samuel, nor the Apostles, nor our Savior Christ did wear any
distinct apparel from others, which lived in their times. For if Samuel being
then the seer, had had a several apparel, which was proper to the seers, it
is not like that Saul would have asked of himself where his house was. And
if the Apostles had worn a several apparel from the (...), they should not
have bin esteemed by so general and uncertain a note, as of speaking somewhat
brodely, or as I may term it, Northe^ly, for it had bin a surer note to have
said thou art one of his Apostles, bycanse none wears this apparel but his
Apostles, where there was a great number that spoke Galilean like, which were
not of his Apostles, nor disciples neither. But let these go. You say our
savior Christ had a several apparel, because he had a cote without seame.
Assuredly you might use less scornefulnesse in rehearsing of other men's
arguments if for no other cause, yet for this, that they might take more pity
of yours.

For what an argument is this? our fauioure Christ did wear an under garment,
which could not be well parted, but with the spoil or marring of it, therefore
he ware a several apparel from the rest. It is true, John Baptist had a
several apparel, and to help you, so had Elias, but to this end, that both by
his unwonted apparel, and strange diet which he used oflocusts and wild
honey, the extraordinaries of his ministry might be set forth, and the
people the rather moved to enquire of his office, whom they saw to varrie so
much from the common customs of other men. But ministers now have no such
extraordinary functions, therefore by that reason of yours, they should not
be severed from other men, by any note of apparel. You say you know that the
chief notes of a minister, are doctrine and learning, if you mean that the
distinction of apparel must supply the rest, and that that also has some
force to commend their ministry, the Prophets and Apostles of our sautoure
Christ, left us no A^table reason.

Io. Whitgifte.
They be conjectures indeed, and mere conjectures but without all shadow of
probability The unapt reasons of the Admonitors dissembled by T. C.
or reason: and if you will give me leave so to coniectnre, I will prove any
thing. But such slender conjectures argues the slenderness of your proofs.
The Admonition uses tho^se places to prove that ministers were then known by
voice, learning and doctrine, which how they or you can conclude of them, I
confess, that I cannot imagine, except you will say, that Samuel said unto
Saul I am the seer: and they that stood by said unto Peter-euen thy speech
bewrays thee: therefore ministers were known by voice, learning and
doctrine: which is as much as though you would say, Saul knew Samuel by
Samuels own report, and a welchman is known by his tongue, ^rgo ministers are
known by voice* learning, and doctrine: is not this a proper kind of
reasoning? is this the reverence due to the scriptures, thus (...) to abuse
them?

But say you, if Samuel had had a several apparel proper to the Seers, it
was not like that Saul would have asked of him where his house was: Nay, you
should rather have said that it is like that Saul being a rud^y, and brought
up only in keeping of cattle, had never seen prophet before, and therefore
could not know Samuel, what kind of apparel soever he had worn. And that
this is true, that Saul did not know what a Seer meant, and that he did never
see any before, it may appear in the same chapter. And therefore says M.
Mart^ upon that. 18. verse of the. 9. Chapter. Saul is so rude in P. Martyr.

gowns, and what soever does not please their waywardness. etc. Whereby it is
evident that the Prophets did wear, and were known by a peculiar kind of
garment. If you enquire of the practice, we have diverse examples: yea even of
Samuel whom we now have in hand. For one thing that (...) Saul, that he whom
the wytch had raised, was Samuel, was the de^ption of his apparel. 1. Sam.
28. There comes up an old man with a mantell upon him* And Saul perceived 1.
Sam. 28.
that it was Samuel. etc. It cannot be thought that Saul conceyned this
opinion, because she named an old man, but because she added his mantell and
kind of attireWe read likewise of Elyas. 2. Reg. 1. and. 2. that he had a
heary or rough mantell agreing to the description in the Prophet Zachary, and
a leather girdell whereby he was known of Ahazia: And this is by you confessed.
Elizeus succeeds Elias both in office and vesture: And John Baptist did not
only represent Elias his spirit, but also his kind of garmente, for his rough
garment of camels hear, and leather girdle are described by Saint Matthew cap.
3. I suppose now that the manifest scripture, the opinion of learned
interpreters, and the practice of so many notable Prophets do sufficiently
justify my assertion, and are able to improve your probable conjectures, as you
term them.

Touching Peter what kind of apparel soever he did wear, the matter is not
great: it is the fond reason of theirs that I reprove, which is tootoo
childish, as I have showed before: and yet may it be supposed that Peter used
all the means he could, not to be known, and therefore whether he cast off
his uppermost garment, or changed it, it may be a question. Furthermore, it was
in the night time: finally, he was suspected by a maid to be one of Christ's
disciples before he had spoken one word, as it appears, Io. 18. But to let
all this pass, what kind of reasoning call you this? Peter was known by his
voice, Ergo he was not known by his apparel: or this, Peter was known by his
tongue to be a Galilcan, Ergo ministers must be known by voice, learning, and
doctrine.

Here you let slip without any defense at all, that which is alleged by the
Admonition The Admo nition wants a procto^
out of the. 48. verse of the. ^6. Chapter of Mathewe to the same purpose.

No man can deny but Christ's apparel differed from the rest, and that this was
a rare kind of habit, else would not the Evangelist Saint John cap. 19. have
made so particular mention of it: wherefore, that which I say is true, that
even then ministers of the Gospel might be known by their apparel, as Christ
and John the Baptist: and therefore not to be so strange a matter, that
ministers should also now differ from other men in their apparel.

That which you speak of John Baptist, confirms my saying, which is, that
ministers of the Gospel were then also known by their apparel: and if
unwonted apparel did set forth John his ministry, and moved them the rather
to enquire of his office, why may it not have the same use now in like manner?
But I have used those examples only to show the vanity of the Admonition,
which would make the Reader believe, that in those days there was no
distinction used in apparel.

Christ and his Apostles have left a perfect pattern of a minister touching
conditions, qualities, Lose conclusio^s of T. C.
and office, so has ye scripture done of a magistrate, and of a subject also,
of a master and of a servant. etc. but shall there be therefore no distinction
in apparel betwixt them? or no external notes to discern them by? what kind
of argument call you this, Christ and his Apostles have left us a perfect
pattern of the ministers office: Ergo, the magistrate may not take any order
for his apparel? Truly these be loose conclusions and (as you use to term
them) very pitiful arguments. Of the same force be these arguments: most of
the Apostles and Prophets used no such several apparel, Ergo, we may not use
any several apparel. And again, none of them have left any commandment of
it, Ergo it ought not to be.

The first reason has thus many faults: first, the Antecedent is untrue, as I
have showed before out of this Prophet Zachary, and M. Calvin. etc. For the
Prophets were discerned from others by a certain kind of apparel, and it is
not able to be proved but that the Apostles had several apparel from the
common sort of men. Secondly, The Antec^dent of T. C infers a consequent
against himself.
it is no good argument a facto ad ius: but it is much worse a non facto ad non
ius, the which kind of argument Zuinglius diverse times reproves in his
treatises against the Anabaptists, as I have oftentimes said. Thirdly, if some
of the Apostles and some of the Prophets did use several apparel (as the
Antecedent confesses they did) though it does not follow that we must do so:
yet it evidently proves that we may do so, being no commandment in the
scripture to the contrary. Theargume^^ of T. C. overthrown by his own
assernon.


Your second argument is overthrown by your own self. For Page 13. you
say, that many things are both commanded and forbidden, of which there is
no express mention in the word, which are as necessary to be followed and
avoided, as those whereof Pa. 13. Sect. 1
express mention is made: which if it be true, (as it is most untrue) then
things of less importance and not so necessary, though they be not
expressedly commanded, yet may they be done. M. Calvin in his book against
the Anabaptists (for your arguments and theirs do maruellously agree, and be
builded upon the selfsame foundation) says thus: To dissolve that which God
never dissolved, is in a mortal man a token of to much rashness and
arrogancy. But let us always hold this, that then the authority of God is
usurped, Calvin aduer. Anabap.
when that is condemned, which he has permitted: But the scripture mentions
in no place that the use of armoure is forbidden unto princes. etc. You may
herby then perceive, that M. Calvin does not think this to be a sound
argument, it is not commanded: Ergo it is unlawful, except it can be showed
to be prohibited: wherefore if you will condemn a several kind of apparel in
ministers, you must show some commandment or prohibition in the word of God
for the same, else are you rash, and arrogant, usurping to your self gods
authority as M. Calvin says.

It is so often rehearsed as you report, but by diverse authors, to show their
opinions of one and the selfsame thing. M. Gualter and M. Martyr among other
examples, use this of S. John to prove that in the ancient Church there was a
peculiar fashion of apparel for Priests. I recite their words as witnesses in
this case worthy of credit, and by that occasion this example of John is the
oftener repeated: but this is a sore matter to move such choler: you should
quietly have answered the reason, and left your heat of speech: but you have
done the contrary.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 55. Sect. 1.
But what if none of the Prophets, what if none of the Apostles (which you are
not able to prove either of the prophets or Apostles) were known by their
apparel? May not therefore Christian magistrates in Christian commonweals,
for order and decency appoynte a several kind of apparel, as well to
ministers as to other states of men.

T. C. Page. 54. Sect. 1.
You ask whether the christian Magistrate may enjoin a several kind of
apparel to the Ministers. Either the cause is to weak, which you defend, or
else it has gotten an evil patron, which would so gladly shifte it, and
change it with another. For this is an other question, which you speak of.
For although that be granted unto you, which you demand, yet you can not
conclude your cause. For albeit the Magistrate may command a several
apparel, yet it follows not that he may command this kind of Popish
apparel, and therefore what manner of argument is this of yours, the Magistrate
may command a seuetall apparel, therefore he may command this. The
College walls will tell you You might have learned other Logike within the
College walls.
that a man can not conclude from the whole to the part affirmatively. So you
see I might let you fish and catch nothing, but I am neither afraid, nor
ashamed to tell you the truth of that you ask, so far forth at leaft as I
am persuaded. That is as much to say, as if you like it, you may use it.
I think therefore it may be such a kind of apparel, as the Magistrate
commanding it, the Minister may refuse it, and such it may be, as he may not
refuse it. But whatsoever apparel it be, this commandment can not be without
some injury done to the Minister. For seeing that the Magistrate You may say
the like of Judges.
does allow of him, as of a wise, learned, and discrete man, and trusts him
with the government of his people in matters between God and them, it were
somewhat hard not to trust him with the appoynting of his own apparel, and he
is probably to be supposed that he has discretion to wear his own gear
comely, and in order, that is able to teach others, how they should wear
theirs: and that he should be able to do that by his wisdom, and learning,
that others do without learning, and great store of wisdom, and that he
should keep order and decency in apparel, which has learned in the schole
of Christ, which they do that had never other scholemaster than common sense
and reason. And if any minister be found to fault, in going either
dissolutely, or to exquisitely and delicately, then the Magistrate may Why may
be not as well appoint him an order, as punish his disorder^

Io. Whitgifte.
If you had noted my order, and delte sincerely, these words of yours might
with less discredit unto you, have bin well forborne. For in this place I
only prove that the ministers may be distinguished from other by a several
kind of apparel. And I ask the question whether a christian Magistrate may
appoint a several kind of apparel for order and decency? Of this apparel
which the Admonition calls Antichristian, I speak a little after. Your so
usual kind of reasoning not ad idem, argues but lack of ability to answer
the present purpose.

The question is incident to my cause: for if the Christian Magistrate have
authority to appoint a several kind of apparel to Ministers, then it is
also lawful for Ministers to use it.

You say the College walls will tell me, that a man cannot conclude from the
whole to the An argument holds from the whole to the part affirmatively
somtune.
part affirmatively. Although my argument is neither a genere, nor a toto,
but ab oppositis relatiuis* (for it is this in effect, the Magistrate may
command it, Ergo the subjects must obey it) yet not the College walls
(which be dumb and can not speak) but the rules of Logike tells me, that if
by the whole you mean that which the Logitians do call Genus, then an
argument from the whole to the part does firmly hold affirmatively, if the
whole be taken vniuersaliter, universally, as in this example, omne animal est
sensibile, Ergo, omnis bomo est sensibilis. Omnis virtus est mediocritas, Ergo
temperantia est mediocritas: and so likewise the Magistrate has authority to
appoint any kind of habit for order or decency, Ergo he may appoint this or
that kind of habit. If you mean by the whole, that which the Logitians do
properly call to tum integrale, as you seem to do, then the rules of Logike
tell you, that ab omn^ ^oto ad parts (except it be a toto in modo) the
argument is good affirmatively, and not otherwise. I am not disposed to boaste
of my knowledge in Logike, nor to win any opinion thereof to my self by
defacing or contemning of other: But, I thank God, I have sufficient to
maynteyne whatsoever I have written, and to answer what you can reply to the
contrary. But who would have thought that this spirit had bin in T C. a man
supposed to be so mortified. etc. The Magistrates authority in appoin ting
apparellabridged by T. C.


You answer my question in deed: but as good never a whitte as never a deal
the better. For in such sort you give the Magistrate authority to command
some kind of apparel to the Minister, that he can command none unto him,
whatsoever it be, without some injury done to the Minister: which is a very
strange answer. For first it restrayneth the Magistrate from having
authority to (...) any kind of apparel: for such (you say) it may be,
that the Minister may refuse it: Then does it accuse the Magistrate of doing
injury, if he appoynte even that kind of apparel that he may lawfully do.
For you say, whatsoever apparel it be, this commandment can not be without
some injury done to the Minister. This is a very nyce authority given to the
Magistrate: but let the Reader well consider your words, and mark what
authority you give to Magistrates. One reason whereby you would prove that
the Magistrate do^he the Minister injury, if he command him to wear that
kind of apparel, which is lawful to be commanded, is this: the Magistrate
does allow of him as a wise, learned, and discrete man. etc. and therefore it
were somewhat hard not to trust him with the appoynting of his own apparel.
etc. First, it is not true, that the Magistrate does allow of him. etc. For
you will have him chosen by the Parish, and the Magistrate can not know what
kind of Ministers every Parish does choose. Secondly, if the Magistrate
allow of him, it is upon condition that he be obedient to his laws. Thirdly,
the Magistrate may be deceived in him, and take him for another manner of man
than he is. Last of all, how wise, how learned, how discrete soever he is,
yet is it meet that he obey laws, and be subject unto good orders. May not
other learned, wise, and discrete men, allege this for them selves also, and
say, that they be able to govern themselves, what need they like children be
prescribed what to do? And undoubtedly at this day this is the voice of
diverse: and this lesson of liberty belike they have learned of you.

I do most humbly desire those that have the care of this common wealth, but
Whereunto the assertion of the (...) tends.
to consider what lies hid even in these your words uttered in this place,
they will then no doubt understand that you seek freedom from all laws of
Princes, and imagine that such perfection may be in men, that they shall not
need to be governed by civil laws, but every man to be a law to him self.

And here your subtle dealing is worthy to be noted (which is very usual
with you) in altering the case: for whereas the kind of apparel is appointed
to be a distinction from other men, and an external note of their calling, as
it is in other sorts of men, as Judges, Sergeantes, Aldermen. etc. you (as
though^ you knew not this) make your Reader believe, that the Magistrate in
appoynting apparel does mistrust the Ministers discretion, in wearing his
own gear comely, and in order: as if the meaning of the Magistrates
commandment herein, were, that Ministers should not go either dissolutely,
or disorderly, and not rather that all Ministers should use that form of
decent apparel, whereby they might in one uniform order agree amongst them
selves, and differ from other states of people in her Dominions. If you meant
uprightly, you would not so often deal in this order.

Chap. 3. the. 2. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 55. Sect. 1.
Judges, Sergeants, Aldermen, and Citizens are known by their apparel, and
why may not Ministers be so likewise? are they not under subjection? be they
not subject to civil laws and ordinances? ought they not to obey their
governors in all things not against the word of God?

T. C. Page 54. Sect. 2.
And whereas you would prove that it may be done with the Ministers, as it is
done with Judges, Sergeantes, Aldermen, and Sheriffs, the case is not like.
For as for these which be in office, their robes and gowns may as their maces
and swords, somewhat help to set forth the majesty and moderate pomp
which is meet for the offices of Justice which they execute, and
consequently to help to strike a profitable fear into their hearts, which
are underneath them, which has, nor can have no place in the minister, whose
authority and power, as it is not outward, so can it not, nor ought not to
borrowe any credit of those external shows. And the Magistrate, or the
City, may seek some honor of the Citizens, mustering as it were by numbers in
one liuerie, which ought not to be looked for at the ministers hand, because
he honoreth and serves the Magistrate an other way, nor can not also,
considering that they are scattered through all the land in every Town, one,
or not so many, as being put in one liuerie, would make any great show to the
honor and commendation of the Town, or City where they remain.

Io. Whitgifte.
I might as well answer for Judges, Sergeants. etc. as you do for ministers,
and say that seeing the Magistrate does allow them as wise, learned, and
discrete men, and trusts them with the government of the common wealth, it
were somethyng hard not to trust them with the appoynting of their own
apparel: but so should I reason fondly and seditiously: for it is meet that
learned, wise, and discrete men should be subject to laws: and the wyser, the
learneder, and the discreeter they be, the more willing they are to obey the
same. And this kind of argument tends to nothing else, but to the animating
of the subjects against the Magistrate, and against the laws. The subjects
an^nated (...) the magistrate.


Though the authority that the Minister ought to have, must come especially
by his doctrine, good conversation, and by his calling: yet is no outward
means (being lawful) to be refused, whereby the same may be helped: and he
must labor as much as he can, even by outward means (whether it be of
conversation, or of apparel, or any such like thing) to commend his office
and calling, and to procure reverence unto it.

A man might likewise say, that Princes, Judges, and Magistrates, are not to
be reverenced for their apparel sake, but for the authority committed unto
them by God: and yet is it meet and convenient that they wear such kind of
apparel as may externally commend their authority.

The apparel of Ministers declares their modesty and gravity: signifies
their calling and office: perteyneth to comeliness and order: and therefore as
convenient to be prescribed unto them, as any other kind of apparel is to
Judges, Sergeantes, or other civil Magistrates. And forasmuch as Ministers be
members of the common wealth, it is meet that they should be subject to the
orders of the same.

It is the honor of the Prince to have all the states and degrees of persons
within her dominion in good order, be they in City, or in Town, together or
separate: and therefore this is nothing that you say, the Magistrate or the
City may seek some honor of the Citizens. etc.

The Judge, wheresoever he goes, ought to be known by his apparel, even so
the Minister: neither can you show any good reason to the contrary. M.
Calvin upon Calvin.
the. 23. of Mat. says, it is meet that Doctors should in gravity and
modesty of apparel differ from the common sort.

other are, and to obey also sometimes, where the commandment is not given

the truth, nor the duty of a subject.

The distinction of Apparel was appointed for Ministers before the Popes
tyranny.
Chap. 4. the. 1. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 55. Sect. 2. 3.
If you doubt whether a particular kind of apparel differing from the lay
men, were ever appointed for Ministers in the Church before the Popes tyranny,
and whether in these days it may be appointed in reformed Churches, or no,
hear the judgment of master Bullinger, and master Gualter, in an Epistle
written by the^ to master N. and master M. Their words be these.

That in the ancient Church there was a particular fashion of apparel
Bullinger and Gualter.
for Priests, it appears in the Ecclesiastical history of Theodoret. lib.
2. cap. 27. and of Socrates lib. 6. cap. 22. No man is ignorante, which has
but lightly read over the monumentes of the ancient fathers, but that the
Ministers used a cloak in their service. And therefore I say de before, that
the diversity of garments had not his original of the Pope. Eusebius cites
out of the ancient vvryters, that saint John the Apostle vvare on his head a
leaf or thin plate like unto a Bishops myter. Pontius Diaconus witnesses
of saint Cyprian the Martyr, that when he offered his neck to the
executioner, he first gave him his cappe, and the Deacon his upper garment, and
so stood appareled in white linen. Moreover Chrysostom makes mention of
white apparel of Ministers. Hitherto Bullinger and Gualter.

T. C. Page 54. Sect. 3. 4.
The place of The place of Theodoret fal^fied*
Theodoret cited by M. Bullinger, makes mention of a golden Cope, and that
used by Bishops of Jerusalem, and sold by Cyrill a good Bishop, whereby he
declared sufficiently his misliking of such garments in the ministry of the
Sacraments. In the place the which he cites out of Socrates, there is one
Sycinius an Nouatian Bishop is said to have worn white apparel, and
therefore is reprehended as for too much exquisiteness and finenesse of
apparel, and the Bishop of Durisine, in a letter he wrote, alleges the same
place against the surplice. A man would hardly believe that master Bullinger
should use these places to prove a distinction of apparel amongst the
Ministers: We are not ignorant but that a cloak has been used of the
Ministers in their service, but that was no several apparel of the Ministers,
but common to all Christians, which with change of their religion, changed
also their apparel, as appears manifestly in Tertullian de Pailio.

As for the Petalum that S. John ware, I see not how it can be proved, to be
like a Bishops ^iter. For the cappe that S. Cyprian gave the executioner,
argues rather that it was the common apparel, which was customably worn,
for else it would not have done him so much good. As for his upper garment,
which he gave to his Deacon, it was a token of his good will, which he would
leave with him, as the practice has been seen with us, and proves nothing
that it was any several apparel. As for the whytelinnen garment, which he
suffered in, it can not seem strange unto us, which have seen the holy
martyrs of the Lord executed in Smithfielde and other places. And it is not to
be thought that S. Cyprian had so small judgment, that living in the time of
persecution, he would by wearing of some notable apparel from the rest, as it
were betray him self into the hands of his ennemies, unless all the
Christians had done so too for clearer and more open profession of their
faith, and greater detestation of the contrary Religion: as Tertullian and
the Chrystians in his time did, by the wearing of a Cloak, which reason may
be also alleged of the Petalum of Saint John. Hom. 6. ad pop. Antioch^.
It is true, Chrysostom makes mention of a white garment, but not in
commendation of it, but rather to the contrary. For he shows that the
dignity of their ministry, their sa^tie and crown was in taking heed, that
none unmeet were admitted to the Lords supper, not in going about the Church
with a white garment. And it is easily to be seen by ( Scripture fondly
alleged.
) Solomon Eccle. 9.
in his Ecclesiastes, that to wear a white garment was greatly esteemed in the
East parts, and was ordinary to those that were in any estimation, as the
wearing of black with us: and therefore was no several apparel for the
ministers, or for to execute their ministry in.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of Theodoret be these, But the tale, which they had raised of
Cyrillus, T^eod. lib. 2. cap. ^7.
did chiefly displease the ( (...)*
) Emperor. For whereas the most worthy king Constantine had for the honor of
the Church of Jerusalem given unto Macarius Bishop in the same city, a holy
garment (precious and wrought with gold) which he should wear, when he
ministered the holy Baptism, they reported that Cyrill sold it. etc. Here you
see that Theodoret counts it but a fable, that Cyrill should make any such
sale, and those that say he sold it, declare that it was not for any
disalowing of the vesture, but for Sozo. lib. ^ cap. 25.
necessity of the poor in the time of famine, as Sozo. lib. 4. cap. 25.
testifies.

You deal with M. Bullinger as you do with me, that is, you pervert his
meaning and allege that out of Socrates, that he meant not, and keep that in
silence, which makes Lib. 6. cap. (...)*
directly for this purpose. Socrates there shows how Sycinius being a
Nouatian, did wear white apparel, and when he was for the same reproved, he
answered that it was no where written that Priests should wear black
apparel, and bad them prove by scripture, that priests ought to wear black
apparel. Whereby it is plain, that ministers in those days did wear black
apparel, and were thereby known, and that Sycinius being an heretic refused
so to do, using the same arguments that you do, scilicet, that it is no where
commanded that Priests should wear such kind of vesture. Wherefore the story
is aptly alleged by master Bullinger, to prove a several kind of apparel,
and it insinuates what manner of men those be, that contemn the common order
in such matters, and love to be singular like unto Sycinius the Nouatian
heretic.

As for S. John his Petalum, you hear what these learned men say, who no
doubt have good ground of their judgment. Neither would Eusebius have made
any mention of it, if it had not bin a kind of apparel, whereby S. John was
known. Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 31.
The words of Eusebius lib. 3. cap. 31. be these: John which leaned upon the
breast of the Lord, being a Priest wore a leaf or thin plate. Whereby it is
evident, that this apparel was peculiar to S. John in the respect that he was
a Priest. That Cyprian his apparel was not usual and common for other men to
wear, it may appear by this, that the names of his apparel be expressed, for
that which he gave to the executioner is called Birrus, that is, a thi^ne
plate, and that which he gave to the Deacon was called Dalmatica, a garment
with long sleeves: as for the white linen, it is not there mentioned as any
distinct kind of apparel.

The words of Chrysostom do manyfestly declare that then such kind of
garment was used in the administration of the Sacraments: neither do his
words tend any thing at all to the disalowing of it, for they be spoken by
the way of comparison, and negatiues by comparison are not simple negatiues (as
I told you before) but by the way of comparison: and therefore when
Chrysostom says, that the dignity of their ministry. etc. was in taking
heed, that none unmeet were admitted to the Lords supper, not in going about
the Church with a white garment, he does not disallowe going about the
Church in a white garment, but he says, that it is not in comparison of the
other, so greatly to be regarded.

If Solomon in that place meant any such matter, yet is it no proof at al for
this that T. C. does (...) ^eage the (...) fundly (...) carelessly.
you alle^e it for: there was a great number of years betwixt Solomon his time,
and Chrysostomes, and all kind of customs much altered, and therefore I
marvel what you mean to bring in Solomon to prove that the white apparel used
by ministers of the church in the administration of the sacraments in the time
of Chrysostom, was not s^uerall, but common and usual apparel. But that the
Reader may understand your carelessness in alleging the scriptures, I will
set down the words of Solomon in that. 9. chapter and. 8. verse. At all times
let thy garments be white, and let not oil be lacking upon thine head. In the
which sentence, by the white garment is meant either innocence of life, as
Pellicane does interpret it, or joy and mirth, as some other think: Ecclesi.
9.
but there can be nothing less gathered thereof, than that there was at that
time any such usual kind of apparel. And to what purpose should he have so
said, if it had bin so? The Metaphores and figurative kind of speeches that
Solomon uses in these books, can not be unknown to any. You do not trouble
me with many quotations, but those that be, are passing strange. And surely I
can not but marvel how you dare be so bold, as thus to abuse the scriptures.

Be it that this is the saying of belly gods (according to the note of the
Geneua Bible, whereupon I think you ground your assertion) to move unto mirth
and pastime, does it therefore follow, that this was an usual kind of
Apparel in Solomon his time? Or if it were then, must it be also in
Chrysostom his time? Or if it were so in his time, might it not also be used
of the ministers in the administration of the sacraments, as a comely and
decent vesture, and differing from the rest? If I had the gift of jesting,
that you are so excellent in, what sport could I make with this, and a number
such like places?

Therefore it is certain that Ministers even from the Apostles time have had a
distinct and several kind of apparel from other men.

As for Eustathius his deprivation, because he did not were apparel meet for
a Minister, it makes not to this purpose one whit. For I have showed that if
any minister go like a ruffian or swashe buckler, or in the bravery of a
courtier, that it is meet he should be punished according to the quantity of
the fault. And that it is so to be understood it appears manifestly by the
counsel of Gangris, which did therefore confirm the same deposing, because he
ware a stranger apparel, and the habit of a Philosopher, and caused all his
fellows to do so. Therefore I maruaple what you mean to allege this place.

does appear that Eustathius and his adherentes were condemned for using a new
and singular kind of apparel, from that which then was commonly and
customably used of all Bishops. That in the conclusion of this Council which
is spoken of modest, simple, and decent apparel, against that which is lose
and dissolute, has no color of proving any thing against Eustathius his
contempt and singularity, neither does it in any one word signify, that he
was not deprived for refusing to wear the ordinary and accustomed apparel to
Priests.

Augustine in his Epistle ad Publicolam has this notable saying. Augustinus.
Et cum templa, idola, luci, and si quid buiusmodi data potestate euertuntur,
quamuis manifestum est, cum id agimus, non ea nos honorare, sed potius
detestari, ideo tamen in vsus nostros priuatos duntaxat and proprios, non
debemus inde aliquid vsurpare, vt appareat nos pietate ista destruere, non
auaritia. Cum vero in vsus communes, non proprios ac priuatos, vel in honorem
dei very conuertuntur, hoc de illis fit, quod de ipsis hominibus, cum ex

or use them to our own private uses only and commodity, that it may appear
that we destroy them for Religion sake, and not for covetousness. But when
they are converted, not into private and our own use, but into common uses,
or to the honor of the true God, that is done and brought to pass in them,
which is done and brought to pass in men them selves, when of Idolaters and
wicked persons they are changed into true Religion. This has God himself
taught in those testimonies, which thou thy self haste used, when as God
himself commanded that of that same grove, which was dedicated to strange
Gods, there should be wood taken for his sacrifices: and of Hierico, that all
the Gold and Silver, and brass should be brought into the treasury of the
Lord. Wherefore that also, which is written in Deutronomie, thou shall not
covet their silver nor their gold, neither shall thou take any thing thereof to
thy self, least thou offend, because it is abomination unto the Lord thy
God. etc. It manifestly appearreth that either private uses is forbidden in
such things, or that nothing should so be brought into thy house that it be
honored: for then it is abomination. etc. Hitherto Augustine.

By these words it does manifestly appear, that even things altogether

dedicated to Idols and used in Idolatry, may be converted to common uses, and
used in the service of God and to his honor, but not to private uses nor
superstitiously.

forsake their solemnities, let go their toys, and then if they agree not unto
our truth, let the^ be ashamed of their fewness, whereby he shows that the
nearest way to gain the Papists, is to forsake their ceremonies. And yet I
would be loathe to say either with you, or with Augustine, that it is not
lawful for a man, to make of a Popish surplisse, a shirte for himself, or to
take the gold of a Cope which he has boughte, and convert it to his private
use. And herein we do nothing disagree with Saint Augustine, which grant that
surplesses and copes, and tippets, and cappes, may be applied to a good use,
either common or private, as they will best serve, but we deny that that use
is in distinguishing either the ministers from other men, or the ministers
executing their ecclesiastical function from themselves, when they do not
exercise that office.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of Augustine be plain, neither can they be so shifted of. And it
makes evidently against your distinction that he says such things may not be
converted into private uses. A man may cavil with the most manifest
authorities either of scriptures or fathers, that can be: but every shifte and
cavil is not a sufficient answer. This proposition is by these words of
Augustine directly proved: that things altogether dedicated to Idols and used
in Idolatry may be afterward used in the service of God, and to his honor,
which is the state of our question. And because this is a material point, and
peradventure Saint Augustine his authority is not much regarded of you, I will
set down M. Calvin his opinion also touching the same matter, who in his
Harmony upon the books of Moses, upon these words in the. 23. of Erodus ver.
24. Thou shall utterly overthrow, and break in pieces their Images, says
t^us: we make it Calui^.
not now any scruple of conscience to retain still those Churches which were
polluted with Idols, and to put them to better use because that which is added
to the law propter consequentiam (as they term it) does not bind us. I
grant that all those things which do tend to the planting of superstition
ought to be taken away, so that, by precise urging of that which is of it
self indifferent, we be not in to much rigor, Superstitious. The place is
worth the noting, it fully overthrows your grounds against the apparel.

Saint Augustine in that sermon quoted in your margent, speaks against such
as professing Christianity did notwithstanding resort to the temples of the
Paganes at their solemnities and feasts, thinking it sufficient, if they did in
heart detest the Idols, though in body they were present in their temples and
at their feasts: much like unto those that think it sufficient to serve God in
heart, though in body they be present at the Mass, and Idolatrous service.
That this is the meaning of Augustine in that place, it may evidently appear
to all such as will peruse it: upon this Augustine brings in these words:
If you ask how the Paganes may be overcome, won, and illuminated, how they
may be brought to salvation: forsake all their solemnity, let go Aug. sermon.
6. de verbis domi. in Matthew.
their toys, and then if they agree not unto the truth, let them be ashamed of
their fewness. It was in Saint Augustines time, as it is in some places at
this day, where in some one city there be Churches both for the Gospel, and
for the mass also: it is not meet that such as profess the Gospel, should
resort to the Mass: for besides that they offend God in being present at
Idolatrous service, they also give occasion to the Papists to think better of
their Mass, because they see it frequented of such as seem to profess the
Gospel, and thereby also persuade them selves of a greater multitude that
embraces their Religion: wherefore one way to convert them is, to abstain
from their Churches, that they may understand both our misliking of their
service, and their own paucitie also. And that this is meant of by Augustine in
that place, it may also appear by these words in the same Sermon: The Paganes
say in their hearts, why forsake we our Gods, seeing the Christians them
selves worship them as well as we. And again: Behold against what true God
thou do offend, whiles thou fallest down before false Gods. S. Augustine
speaks not one word in all that sermon of ceremonies, or any thing else
taken from the gentiles, and by Christians converted to other uses: much less
of any such matter as we have new in question. And therefore you do but abuse
the Reader by reciting certain words of S. Augustine without the
circumstances, which open the true meaning of them.

I praise your wit for saying that such things may be converted to private
uses: for deny that (as S. Augustine plainly does) and I shall be bound unto
you, that your doctrine shall have the fewer fautors by. 3. parts: for surely
many that condemn your opinions in heart, for hope of private commodity, that
might come unto them, by the dissolution of colleges, Churches, etc. do seem
very well to like of them. Wherefore teach them (if you be wise) that such things
may be converted to their private uses, whatsoever Augustine says to the
contrary.

Augustine says also that they may be converted in honorem Dei, unto the
honor of God. What say you to that? as for your denying that that use is in
distinguishing either the ministers from other men. etc. because it is but your
bare denial against all the proofs alleged, I will with affirming the
contrary pass it over.

writes on this sort.

But let us consider your other argument, that is to say: It is not lavvfull
to use these kind of vestures, because they were invented by the Popes

suertie, that we can use nothing that perteined to the Pope, and is used in

also the salarie and reuenevves consecrated to the Idols of the gentiles, to

they did nothing stick or fear to use them, when it seemed to them
convenient, imitating Paul the Apostle, who stuck nothing at all to rehearse
for his purpose Menander, Aratus, and Epimenides, and that he did in entreating
the holy Scripture apply profane words to set forth Gods Religion. We read
also how that wine was consecrated Wine, bread* etc. consecrated to Idols.

letters unto Mercury, song unto the Muses and unto Apollo, and many other
things Tertullian rehearses in his book entitled de corona militis

that we stick not to use all these things freely asvvell in holy as in
profane uses, although at one time or other before, they had been consecrated
to Idols and to devils. Hitherto Peter Martyr.

T. C. Page. 55. Sect. 5.
To all these things that M. Martyr reckeneth up of revenues, and wages,
verses, wine, bread, oil, water, which being consecrated unto Idols are well
used, Tertullian answers in the same book, whereout a number of these are
taken: when he says that we ought to admit a participation of those things,
which bring either a necessity or profit in the use of them, but we deny ^
these things thus used, are either necessary or profitable. And therefore in
stead of temples, tithes, wine, etc. if you would have matched the surplice
well, you should have said sensors, tapers, holy bread, holy water, and such
like.

Io. Whitgifte.
Master Martyr used these examples to prove that the surplice and other
apparel of Ministers now used (for that is the matter he handles) may
lawfully be retained and worn: whose judgment and authority with learned and
wise men does far ouerreach your naked denial. Neither does Tertullian
speak any thing in his books de corona militis, that tends to the
confutation of any thing that Master Martyr has here spoken, but to the
confirmation of it rather, as he may perceive that with diligence reads the
book. Eusebius Lib. 4. cap. 11. says that Justinius Martyr preached the

apparel, or in what order of life, so that it be not against God, any man

Christians, the church compels them not to change their apparel, or manner
of living, which can nothing hinder Religion, but only she compels them to
change their false opinions. Hilarie Hilarie.
also says, in Psalm. 67. that the spoils of the heathens taken from the
devil, are divided to the furniture and ornaments of the Church of God. So
that the saying of Master Martyr is very true, and confirmed by ancient
authority, and the use of the Church as the testimonies of these fathers
manifestly declare. Where as you say, that if I would have matched the
surplice well, I should have said sensors, tapers. etc. I tell you again that
it is not I, but M. Martyr a famous and notable man, that so matched them, and
at that time, when the same matters were in controversy, and his judgment
required of them, and therefore could not be written of him, but with great
aduisement. Howbeit, that you may know something the more, you must learn to
put a difference between Adiapbora vera and Pseudoadiapbora, those things that
be indifferent in deed, and those that are falsely accounted indifferent.

means it be lavvfull to use those things, which were of Aarons Priesthood
or of the Gentiles, then is it not lavvfull for us to have Churches, nor

which thing also experience proves. For any thing to be a What it is to be a

there can stick in the things themselves no note or mark of Antichrists

may serve godly with godly men, that was of wicked signification with the
ungodly? Truly I know very many Ministers of Christ, most godly men, who
have used godly these vestures, and at this day do yet use them: So that I
dare not for this cause ascribe unto them any fault at all, much less so
heinous a fault of communicating with Antichrist, for the which fault we
may utterly refuse to communicate with them in The distribution of bread and

Christ. The Priests of devils did celebrate in their sacrifices, the
distribution of bread and the cup, as Justinius Martyr and Tertullian make
mention. What let is there why we may not use the same ceremonies also? you
will say we have a commandment of the Lord touching this ceremony. Very
well. And by the self same it appears that same thing to serve among the
children of God to the service of Christ, which the wicked abused in the
service of devils, if the commandment of Christ be added thereto. But it is
the commandment of Christ, that in our holy actions vveinstitute and use all
things so as comeliness and order be observed, that faith may be edified.

The same M. Bucer in another Epistle written to M. Cranmer Archbishop of
Canterbury, says on this sort: All true godly men may
godly use those rytes, which wicked men have abused howsoever ungodly.

T. C. Page 56. Line. 2. and Sect. 1.
It is true that M. Bucer says, that it is not in the nature of any creature
to be a note of Antichrist, but yet it follows not thereof, that the creature
that has been accidentally and through abuse applied to Idolatry, may be
forthwith used as we shall think good. For neither the Idols of the gentus,
nor the corruptions of those which offered, had not power to make the beef or
mutton that was offered, no good and wholesome meat for the sustenaunce of man,
neither cause that a Christian man could not eat them as beef and mutton, but
yet either to eat it at the table of Idols, before them, or else privately in
his own house, when there was any weak by, that thought it an abominable
thing, was not lawful: and yet the meat nevertheless the good creature of
God, and which might be received with thanksgiving, so the abuse of the surplis
and coape. etc. cannot cause, but that they may be used as cloth and silk.

And whereas he says that they are changed, and made of notes of
Antichristianitie, marks of Christianity, I say that they cannot be changed
so by and d^cree or commandment, for as much as notwithstanding that
profession of change, the ha^ ts or men unto which every man must have regard
unto, are not changed. For not so soon as the magistrate will say that these
things shall be from henceforth used as things indifferent, forthwith men do
use them so, but those only use them so, which have knowledge, both the
ignorant and the weak take them still otherwise.

you should seem to give place to the plain truth. These vestures are neither
used at the tables of Idols, nor with the offense of the the weak, as I have

Gospel, as well as the bell is known to be rong to godly prayers, and

question, whether we may wear such apparel as the Papists do, say on this
sort: If we should have nothing common with them, then must we forsake all
our Churches, refuseal livings, not minister baptism, not say the Apostles or
Nicene creed, yea and quite cast away the Lords prayer, neither do you
borrow any ceremonies of them. The matter of apparel was never taken away
at the beginning of reformation, and is yet retained, not by the Popes law,
but by the kings commandment, as an indifferent thing of mere policy. Yea
truly if you wear a cap or a peculiliar kind of apparel, as a civil and
politic thing, it smells neither of Iudaisme, nor Monachisme: For these
will seem to separate themselves from the civil and common life, and account
a meritorious deed in the vvearing of a peculiar garment. So Eustathius Bishop
of Sebastia, was not Superstition in garments condemned.
simply condemned for vvearing a peculiar kind of garment: but for that he did
put religion in his garment. The canons of the council of Gangren, Laodicen,
and of the sixth council, are well known. If in case, any of the people be
persuaded that these things sauoure of Papisme, Monachisme, or Iudaisme, let
them be told the contrary, and perfectlye instructed therein. And if so be
through the importunate crying out hereon before the people by some men, many
be disquieted in their conscience, let them bevvare which so do, that they
bring not greater yokes on their own necks, and provoke the Queens majesty
and bring many faithful ministers in such danger, as they cannot rid
themselves out again. Hitherto Bullinger.

T. C. Page 56. Sect. 1. 2. 3.
The rest of those things, which M. Bucer, and those which M. Bullinger and
Gualter bring, are all of that sort, whereunto answer is made.

Only this they add, that if the people do abuse and peruerte those
ceremonies, they ought to be better instructed, which is a counsel not so
convenient, that the ministers and Pastors which have so many necessary
points to bestow their time on, and to inform the people of, should be
driven to cut off their time appointed thereto, to teach them not to abuse
these things, which if they use never so well, they can gayn nothing, and to
take heed that they hurt not themselves at those things, which in their best
estate do no good, especially when one sermon of the taking of them away
joined with authority to execute it, may do more good, than a thousand
sermons without authority.

Besides that, it is absurd, that Ceremonies which ought to be helpers to
promote the doctrine, should become lettes and hindrances, whylest the
minister is occupied in teaching, to beware of the abuse of them, and of
superstition. And it is as much as if one should be set to watch a chyide
all day long, least he hurt himself with the knyfe, when as by taking away
the knyfe quite from him, the danger is avoided, and the service of the man
better employed. And so it follows, that although the Church may appoynte
Ceremonies and rites, yet it can not appoynte these that have great
incommoditie, and no commodity, great offense, and no edifying.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have omitted diverse things in the words of these learned men,
whereunto you have not answered one word, as the Reader by conference may
perceive: and here you have also willyngly passed over that which touches you
somethyng pinchingly, in these words of M. Bullinger, and M. Gualter, scil.

because the Pastors have so many necessary points. etc. how comes it to
pass that you and your partakers have so pestered your sermons and books
therewith, and so long time taught the people nothing else, but contempt of
all good order and obedience in such matters, and have stirred them up against
the true preachers of the Gospel, and against their Magistrates and rulers for
the self same thing? Is it not as convenient for us to root out of the
peoples minds errors touching things indifferent, as it is for you to
ingrafte them? or is not the doctrine of the true and lawful use of
indifferent things, of due obedience toward laws and Magistrates a
necessary doctrine?

Where as you say, it is absurd, that Ceremonies which ought to be helpers
to promote The doctrine of things indifferent necessary. Things abused must not
by and by be taken away.
the doctrine, should become lettes and hindrances. etc. I will not say you
speak absurdly, but undoubtedly you speak unadvisedly. For will you have
things indifferent abrogated so soon as they be abused, ^east they should
become lets and hindrances, whilst the minister is occupied in teaching. etc.
then take away tithes, lands, meats. etc. The abuse whereof must of
necessity oftentimes be reprehended in sermons, and the true use taught: and
make all things common, that the preachers in their sermons may be occupied
about great matters. Do you not see that doctrine of things indifferente is
necessary? understand you not that the taking away of the things from the
eyes, does not by and by root the opinion out of the heart? Things abused
must not always be taken away when they are abused, but the right use must
be taught, and the abuse reproved.

The child when he has discretion, and is able to be instructed, though he
sometime hurt himself with the knyfe, yet must not the same be altogether
taken from him, but he must be rebuked for vsyng it so indiscreetly, and
taught to use it better. Shall the rich and costely apparel be taken from
Princes, nobles, and men and women of estate, and they brought to a popularitie
therein, because there is great abuse oftentimes in such apparel, and many
prouocations to evil? No truly: but such kinds of abuses are to be by the
word of God reproved. Neither does such instructions and doctrine in matters
indifferente hinder preachers from weightyer matters. Why did the Apostles
make their decree of absteyning a suffocato and sanguine, from that that is
strangled, and blood? or Saint Paul, of praying bare headed or Act. 15.

Touching the great incommoditie and offense that you imagine to be in this
apparel, it is but your fancy, which take y^ apparel to be the cause of your
niceness, contempt, disobedience, contention, and such like, remaining in you,
when in deed it is nothing else but singularity, and preposterous zeal:
Wherefore that is to be removed out of the heart, rather than the apparel from
the back. To be short, yt which you imagine of any opinion of the Religion in
this aparel, or superstition, or any such like offense, it is but a mere
imagination to cloak and cover the corruptions of the mind before mentioned.

fourthly, that they be not decreed as necessary, and not to be changed: And
last of all, that men be not so tied unto them, but that by occasion they may

And although they have all these proporties which you recite, yet if they be
not to edifying. if not to God his glory, if not comely and agreeable to the
simplicity of the Gospel of Christ, crucified, they may not be established.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is sufficient if they perteyne to order and comeliness (as I have before
declared) the judgment whereof does not belong to every private man, but to
such only as have authority in the Church: to whose determination in such
matters all other of duetic are bound to submit themselves.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 62. Sect. 1.
YEt one thing I must admonish you of, that there is a difference A difference
between worshipping of false gods, and of the true God falsely.
to be made bewixt those things, which were wholly dedicated to false gods, and
to be used in the worshipping of them: and those things which were used in the
false woorshipping of the true God: for the Papists herein differ from the
Gentiles, that they acknowledge and confess the true God, and believe the same
articles of faith that we do: but yet worship him not aright, nor believe on
him in all points, as the word of God prescribes. And therefore if things
abused of the Gentiles, and invented by them may be used of Christians, much
more may things invented and abused by Papists.

T. C. Page. 56. Sect. 4.
Concerning your distinction, whereby you lessen the idolatry of the Papists,
I have showed the vanity thereof.

Io. Whitgifte.

place will not serve every circumstance of this place, except you will say with
ye Stoickes, that peccata sunt paria, all sins are equal.

Answer to the Admonition, Page 62. Sect. 1.
But of this matter I mind also to speak some thing in the second part of
this Admonition.

T. C. Page. 56. Sect. 5.
But of this matter you say you will speak again. In deed so you do, and
again, wherein you confound the memory and understanding of the Reader, and
declare your self not only ignorant of Aristotle's rule of (...) (which is to
speak of one thing generally and once for all) but even to be void of that
order, which men have commonly by the natural Logike of reason. Neither can
you excuse your self in saying that the admonition gives you so oftentimes
occasion to speak of them, and so to lay the fault upon it, for that it being
written by diuets persons of the same matters, whereof A manifest untruth.
one knew not of an others doing, can not be blamed for the repetition of one
thing twice, when as you can not escape blame, which might have gathered
easyly into one place, that which is said of them in diverse: which thing,
although it be not so easy for me to do in your book, as it was for you to do
in theirs, yet I will assay to do it both in this, and in all other points
that follow, not thinking thereby to bring this treatise of yours to any good
order (for that were to cast it new again, and then you would complain of
your mind perverted) but that I might remedy this so great disorder, which may
be boon without changing any thing of that which you have set down.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have done as you ought to have done if you had mente plainly: for I have
followed verbatim the book that I confute in the same order, that it is
written, which I think be that confuteth ought to do. That the Admonition
was written by diverse persons, the one not knowing of an others doing* can not
be true: for both the parts have one title, they be in one volume, they were
Printed in one letter, at one time, by one and the same Prynter, and came
abroad together, neither were they ever separated that I know or can
understand. Moreover this bewrays all, and condemns you, for one that has
no conscience in writing untruths, that in the beginning of the Admonition
mention is made of both of these treatises in these words: Two treatyses you
have here ensuyng (beloved in Christ) which ye must read. etc. And in the
end of both these Treatises it is thus written: Weee have thought good in the
latter end of our book, for sundry consyderations, to certifye you (beloved
brethren) of the reasons that have moved us, who are the authors of these
treatyses to keep back our names. etc. Finally, the order and manner of both
these Treatises the style, the quotations. etc. do manyfestly convince you of
false witness bearing: but it is to usual with you.

I am not so cunning in Aristotle, that I can be so bold as to attribute that
unto him, which is not to be found in him, as you do in this place: for though
he speak much of this rule (...), yet has he no such thing as you father upon
him in this place.

It is meet that he which writes a book of any matters, should of one
matter speak fully in one place: but he that confuteth, must follow his
order, whom he confuteth. Which if you had done in my Book, as I have
done in theyrs, either would not your unfaithful dealyng have bin so much,
or else must it sooner, or easylier have bin espied. Your tauntes I leave to
your self that have so good a grace in them.

And if there be any other arguments touching any of these points in other
places, which I have not gathered together into one, the fault is in this,
that I could not bestow so much time in making a harmony of the things,
which are at so great dyscorde, and then that which is left out, shall be
answered in place where I shall find it. Now let us see M. Doctors (...),
and second navigations touching apparel, whether it be any happier, or have any
better success than the first.

Admonition.
Now, we must have Surplisses devised by Pope Adrian.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 105. Sect. 1. 2.
THe impurities you find in the administration of Baptism be these, Surplis.
etc. Touching the Surplis, and such like apparel, I have spoken before
sufficiently: the first inuentor of it (which you say to be Pope Adrian) dot
he make it neither better nor worse, and yet it was used long before Adrians
time, neither can you prove him to be the first inuentor thereof. It is
certain that such kind of vesture has been used in the ministration of the
Sacraments, long before any corruption of doctrine took place in the Church,
as it appears both by Hierome in his first book Aduersus White garmente used
in the ministration.
Pelagi. where he makes manifest mention of a white garmente used in the
Administration of Sacrifice by the Bishop, Priest, and Deacon. And also
Chrysostom Hom. 6. to the people of Antioche, who speaks of the like
garmente worn in the Church. Those that answered the examiner, do but
chyldishly cavil at these two places, which in deed be plain of themselves
and evident, and so is that of Hieromes also upon the. 44. of Ezechiell. The
religion of God has one habit in the ministration, and an other in common use
and life. Read the place considerately, and it shall easyly appear, that
Hierome means as well of Christian Ministers, as of Iewishe Priests.

But of the use of this and other apparel prescribed in this Church to be worn
by ministers, I have spoken partly before, and am ready to speak more as
occasion shall be offered. In the mean time the Surplis is not of the
substance of Baptism, neither required as necessary to the Administration
thereof, but as comely and decent.

T. C. Page. 57. Sect. 1.
In the. 105. page M. Doctor to prove the use of the Surplice, to draw out
his book into some competent volume, borrows certain places of the
examiner, for answer whereunto, I will refer the reader to that which is
answered unto the examination, as to a full and sufficient answer, wherein I
will rest, and when M. Doctor has proved that, which he says, that it is
but a chyldish cavil, he shall then hear further.

In the mean season it is but a slender reply to so learned an answer (that
proves both out of other authors, and out of those same which the examiner
cites, that by a white garmente is mente a comely apparel, and not slouenly)
to say it is but a chyldish cavil, which a D. of Diumitie and of forty
years of age can not answer. The place of Hierome upon the 44. of Ezechiell,
the more it be considered, the more shall appear the truth of the Answer.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have not answered one word of this, but only shifted it of: I purpose not
A white garmente in the ministration used in Hieromes time. Hiero. lib. 1.
aduers. Pelagi. l^. 44. Ezecb.
at this time to vnrippe the answer to the Examiner, except you had taken the
pains to set it down. Both the places of Hierome are to be seen: in the one
he shows, that in the administration of the Sacraments, the Bishop,
Priest, and Deacon did wear a white vesture: And in the other he says,
that the Religion of GOD has one habit in the ministration, and an other in
the common use and life. Join these two places together, and see whether the
words of Hierome be manifest or no. And that it may evidently appear, that at
this time wherein Hierome lived, the manner was to wear white garments in the
time of divine service and Administration of Sacraments, I will recite the
words of the fourth Council of Carthage, at the which there were present.
214. Bishops among whom was S. Augustine: Diaconus tempore oblationis tantum
vellectionis, alba induatur: Let the Deacon wear a white Con. Carth. 4. Can.

vesture, only in the time of the oblation and reading. Canone. 41. And this
may be a sufficient confutation to what soever is spoken of these places of
Hierome in the answer to the Examiner.

Admonition.
And as for the apparel, though we have been long borne in hand, and yet are,
that it is for order and decency commanded, yet we know and have proved that
there is neither order nor com^ynesse, nor obedience in vsyng it. There is no
order in it but confusion, no comlynesse, but deformity: no obedience, but
disobedience both against God and the Prince.

TO all this also I have answered before, I mean to all the reasons here
alleged, as for bare words, they prevail with none, but such as have
respect to the persons, and not to the matter. And therefore I omit these
words of pleasure, which you use, when you say, that in this apparel there
is no order but confusion, no comeliness, but deformity: no obedience but
disobedience, both against God and the Prince.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nothing is said to this, although some part of it necessarily requires an
answer.

Chap. 6. the third Division.
Admonition.
We marvel that they could epsy in the last synod, that a gray Amyse,
which is but a garment of dignity, should be a garment (as they say) defiled
with superstition, and yet that copes, caps, surplesses, tippets, and such
like baggage, the preaching signs of Popish priesthood, the Popes creatures,
kept in the same form to this end, to bring dignity and reverence to the
ministers and sacraments, should be retained still, and not abolished.

Answer to the Admonition Page 237. Sect. 2.
It is well that you seem to iustifye the gray Amyse, because the Bishops have
disalowed of it in their Synod, Truly this is your conscience and religion, to
be always ad oppositum, and to disalow that, which law and authority allows,
and allow that, which they disalow. The next way (as I think) to drive you
unto conformity in apparel were to make a straight law, that no man should
wear such kind of apparel: because you love to be contrary to laws and good
orders.

T. C. Page. 57. Sect 3. 4. 5.
Now I will desire the reader to turn unto the. 237. 238. 239. 240. 242.
pages, to see whether at this third voyage master Doctor brings any better
merchandise. Where first he surmiseth an untruth, as though the Admonition
misliked of the taking away of the gray Amiss, where it says only, that there
was less cause to take that away, than the surplis. etc. Wherein there is
nothing but the truth said; for because that was used in few churches, and but
of few also in those few churches: Therefore if there were cause to take away
that, there was greater to take away the surplis. And to take away the Amiss out
of the Church, and leave the surplis. etc. is to heal a scratch and leave a
wound unhealed.

Now whereas you say, that we are always ( Ad appositum) and that if the law
commanded straightly, that we should wear none of this apparel that then we
would wear: if it should be answered again that you do I (...) ^as few times
as you.
Seruire scenae: that is, that you are a time seruer, you see we might speak
with more likelyhoode than you. But we will not take (as you do) the judgment
of God out of his hands, but will attend patiently the revelation and
discovering of that, which is now hid both in you and us.

And although you will grant us neither learning nor conscience, yet you might
afford us so much wit as that we would not willingly, and of purpose want
those commodities (...), which we might otherwise enjoy as well as you, if we
had that gift of conformity which you have.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of the Admonition touching the gray Amise be these: we maruayle
that they could epsy in their last synod, that a gray Amiss, which is but a
garment of dignity, should be a garment (as they say) defiled with
superstition, and yet that coapes. etc. Do they not say that the Amiss is but a
garment of dignity. etc? consider their words well, and you shall see that
master Doctor has said truly.

The gray Amiss was justly taken away, because the use of it is not established
by any law of this realm, as the use of other vestures be: and in mine opinion
the Bishops deserved commendation in so doing: for thereby they declared, that
they will not suffer any rites or ornaments to be used in this Church, but
such only as are by public authority established.

Experience has taught me that diverse men be of that nature, that they have
a Some men delight to be contrary to times.
delight in opposing themselves to the present estate, and I see it by proof
to be a great fault in diverse of you.

I have hitherto served as few contrary times, as you have done: as for the
gift of conformity, which you say I have, I thank God for it, I have learned
to conform my self to the time in that sense, that S. Paul has willed me so
to do. Romans 12. and to Romans 12. Romans 13.
laws also and magistrates, as I am likewise commauuded in the. 13. Chapter of
the same epistle.

What commodities you want, that I have, I cannot conjecture: your meat and
drink is provided with less trouble and charges unto you, and in more
delicate and deintie manner, than mine is: your ease and pleasure ten times
more, you do what you list, go when you list, come when you list, speak when
you list at your pleasure. What would you have more? I know not why you should
complain, except you be of the same disposition with the Franciscane Friars,
who when they had filled their bellies at other men's tables, were wont to cry
out and say: O quanta patimur. etc. Some men are delited to be fed at other
men's tables, and prefer popular fame before Gold and silver.

Israelites to touch any thing thereof: and yet was the gold and the silver, and
the brazen and iron vessels carried into the treasure house of the Lord, and
consecrated unto him. Joshua. 6.

and most abhominably defiled with devilish and abominable service, and turned

T. C. Page 57. Sect. 6. 7.
Whereas you say that the accursed things of Jericho, and the Ox, that was
fed to be ^anctified unto Baal, and the wood consecrated unto the Idol, were
converted to the service of the living God, when you shall prove that the
surplis is so necessary to the service of God, as gold. and silver, and other
metal, and as Oxen and wood, whereof the first sort were such, as without the
which, the temple could not be built, the other, such as were expressly
commanded of God* to be used in his service, then I will confess that this
place makes something for you. And Here you disport your self, with your own
imagination.
yet if your coapes and surplices. etc. should have such a purgation by fire,

metalls had, or ever the Lord would admit them into his treasure house, and
should be driven to pass from Popery unto the gospel, by the Chimney, the
fire would make such wrack with them, that they should need have better
legs, than your arguments, to bring them into the Church.

Moreover, do you not see here, that you have not losed the knotte, but cut
it? For the authors of the Admonition object the place of Esaias. 30. and you
object again the places of Deuteronomy, and of the Judges, this is to oppose
sword against sword: in stead that you should have first holden out your
buckler, and latched the blow of your adversary. As for Churches, it has bin
answered that they have a profitable use, and therefore very evil compared
with the surplis, which beside that it brings no profit, hurts also, as
is before said.

Io. Whitgifte.
That wood, that gold, and that Ox. etc. was not so necessary, but that both
God might have bin served, and the temple builded without them: and therefore
that is no answer. Things dedicated to idols may be converted to gods honor.
For although gold, wood, oxen. etc. be necessary, yet the gold and silver
found in I^richo, the Ox reserved by Gedeons father, and wood that was
consecrated to Baal, was not so necessary: for there might have bin other
gold, silver, wood, oxen. etc. provided. In that God commanded these things
to be done, you know that S. Augustine (in the epistle ad Publicolam, in the
words before rehearsed) does conclude a general doctrine, that things
dedicated to Idols may be converted to common uses, and to the honor of God.
For he uses the selfsame places to prove the same, and answers that, which
may be alleged to the contrary out of Deuterono. So does it also the place of
Esaias quoted in the margent of the Admonition: which answer if it will not
satisfy you, then do I further refer you to that, which I have also before
alleged out of M. Calvin writing upon the. 23. of Exodus verse. 24. But this
place of Esaias and such like, are unaptly alleged against the apparel now
used, being nothing of that nature, that those things be, whereof the Prophet
in that place speaks.

You say: if our coapes and surplices. etc. should have such a purgation by
fyr^. etc. I pray you where read you of any such purgation by fire of those
metalls before they were admitted into the Lords treasure house? And what
purgation by fire could there be of the wood, or of the ox, before they were
used in the sacrifice and s^ruice of the Lord? There is no such purging of the
things taken in Jericho mentioned in that Chapter, but the Iosu. 6. ver. 24
contrary: for thus it is written. After they burnt the city with fire, and
all that was therein, only the silver and gold, and the vessels of brass and
iron they put into the treasure house of the Lord: and in the place before,
where Joshua is commanded to reserve these things, there is no commandment of
any such purging.

As your common answer is this, that such things have profitable uses, and
therefore may be retained, though they were consecrated to Idols (which is but a
shift of your own without any ground) so I say that these vestures have a
decent and comely use, and be referred to order, and therefore may be retained
likewise although they were used in Idolatry. And if you shall answer and say
that there may be other things used most comely and decently, then I reply, that
so there may be places as commodious as these Churches: gold, silver, wood.
etc. as good and as profitable as that. And if you object that they be not
comely and decent, then I say unto you, that it is your part, and the part of
all those, that be obedient, to submit your selves to the judgment of those
that be in authority, except they command such things as be contrary to the
commandment of God.

And I say again with M. Bucer, that for any thing to be a note of Antichrist,
is not in the nature of any creature in itself (for to that end nothing was
made of God) but it hangs altogyther of consenting to Antichrists religion,
and the professing thereof: The which consent and profession being changed
into the consent and profession of Christianity, there can stick in the
things themselves no note or mark of Antichrists religion. The use of bells
was a mark of Antichristianitie in our Churches, when the people by them
were called to Masses, and when they were roong against tempests, now they
are a token of Cstristianitie, when the people by them are gathered together
to the Gospel of Christ, and other holy actions. etc.

You say also that they do not edify. If you say that they do not edify

of themselves, you say truly: for only the holy Ghost on this sort does edify,
by the ministry of the word. But if you say, they edifye not at all, that is,
that they do not tend to edifying, as other ceremonies and things used in the
Church (as Pulpit, Church, kneeling, singing and such like) which be appointed
for order and decency, do: then speak you that, which you are not able by
sound arguments to justify.

Io. Whitgifte.
To this not one word.

Chap. 7. the fourth Division.
Answer to the Admonition Page 238. Sect. vlt.
Peter Martyr in his epistle written to M. Hooper thinks that they do edify
after a sort as other ceremonies do. And so does M. Bucer also in his epistle
written to M. Alasco.

T. C. Page 57. Sect. vlt.
After this he sets himself to prove that they do edify, and that first by
M. Bucers and M. Martyrs authority, and yet in their words before alleged,
there is not a word of edifying, If he gather it of their words, the answer is
already made.

Io. Whitgifte.
I tell you it is in their epistles, not in their words before alleged. M.
Bucers worde^ Bucer.
be these. Now if any Church judge and have experience (such as I doubt not
there are many at these days in Germany) that the use of such vesture brings
some commendation to the holy ministration, and thereby helps somewhat in the
way of comeliness and order, to the increase of faith: What (I pray you) can
be brought out of the scriptures why that Church is not left to her own
judgment in this matter, neither therefore to be contemned, or to be called
into question for her judgment sake? That Church verily will keep in these
things a mean agreeable to the cross of Christ, and will diligently attend
that no abuse creep into it. Hitherto M. Bucer. To the like effect also
writes M. Martyr in the epistle before named.

Answer to the Admonition. Fol. 239. Sect. 1.
Furthermore, that they do edify, it is manifest, first, because they The
apparel does tend to edifying for three causes.
are by a lawful magistrate, by lawful authority, for order and decency
appointed in the Church, without any manner of superstition, or suspicion of
the same.

T. C. Page 57. Sect. vlt.
Then he brings reasons to prove it, whereof in the first he seems to
reason that because it is commanded by a lawful magistrate, and lawful
authority, therefore it edifyeth. As though a lawful magistrate does nothing
at any time unlawfully, or as though a lawful and a godly magistrate does not
sometimes command things, which are inconvenient and unlawful. Saul was a
lawful magistrate, and did command unlawful things. David was a lawful and
godly magistrate, and yet there flipt from him commandments, which were
neither lawful nor godly. But he adds that it is done for order, and for
decency without superstition, or suspicion of it. This is that, which is in
controversy, and ought to be proved, and M. Doctor still takes it as
granted, and still faulteth in the petition of the principle, wherewith he
charge others.

Io. Whitgifte.
That which is appointed in the Church by a lawful magistrate, and by lawful
authority for order and decency without any superstition or suspicion of
superstition does edify as other orders do: but it is certain that the
apparel now used is so appointed, Ergo, it does edify as other orders do.

You cavil at the mayor, and bring in the examples of Saul and David, to
prove that a lawful magistrate did command unlawful things, but you omit
the other circumstances contained in the mayor, and therefore you answer not to
the purpose. The minor you say is in controversy, and I do fault in the
petition of the principle. Surely I do petere y^ principium, that no good
subject can deny. For the Queens majesty is a lawful magistrate, the
authority of Parliament is a lawful authority, her majesty by that
authority has appointed this apparel, and that as it is protested for
comeliness and decency without any superstition, Ergo, the minor is true. If
you will yet doubt of comeliness and decency, then I still say unto you,
that what is comely and decent, is not every man's part to judge, but the
magistrates and such as have authority in the Church.

Chap. 7. the. 6. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 239. Sect. 2.
Secondly, because we are by due proof and experience taught, that such as
have worn this apparel, and do wear it, by the ministry of the word have
greatly edifyed, and do daily.

T. C. Page. 58. Sect. 1.
The second reason is, that they that wear this apparel have edifyed, and do
edify, which is, as if a man would say, the midwiues which lied unto Pharao,
did much good amongst the Israelits, Ergo their lying did much good. If he will
say, the comparison is not like because the one is not sin in his own
nature, whereas the other is sin, then take this: One that stammereth and
stutteth in his tongue edifyeth the people, therefore stammering and stutting is
good to edify. For what if the Lord give his blessing unto his word, and to
other good gifts, which he has that preaches and wears a surplis, etc. Is
it to be thought therefore, that he likes well of the wearing of that apparel?
This is to assign the cause of a thing to that, which is not only not the
cause thereof, but some hindrance also, and s^aking of that, whereof it is
supposed to be a cause. For a man may rather reason, that for as much as they
which preach with surplis. etc. edify (notwithstanding that they thereby They
that are driven away ^or that cause do give suspicion of Anabaptisme.
drive away some, and to othersome give suspicion of evil. etc.) then if they
preached without wearing any such things, they should edify much more. And
yet if a man were assured to gain a thousand, by doing of that, which may
offend, or cause to fall one brother, he ought not to do it.

Io. Whitgifte.
Indeed, if this apparel were of that nature, that a lie is, your similitude
of the midwiues had some show in it: and yet must you of necessity confess,
that their lying to Pharao did much good per accidens: for otherwise the men
children of the Israelites, and even Moses himself had bin murdered: and you
are not ignorant that diverse writers in this respect excuse that doing of
theirs. You know likewise what the opinion of some is, touching that kind of
lie that is called officiosum mendacium: but for my part, I am in that point of
Saint Augustines judgment. But your similitude is not like: and if it were,
yet makes it against you, for their lying did good, as I have said e before.

Your other similitude of stammering and stutting is ridiculous, and argues
your great contempt of lawful and decent orders. The laws of this Church
have prescribed this apparel to the ministers of the word as decent, orderly,
and comely, the same laws have inhibited those to preach, that refuse to
submit themselves unto such orders. Wherefore s^eing they be appointed as fit
garments for preachers, and non^ may preach, except he receive them, they do
edify, not by themselves, as I have before declared, but per accidens, as all
other such like things do. For neither the church, nor the Pulpit, nor the
bells, nor (...) and such other do otherwise edify than per accidens.

Touching offense that is taken at the wearing of this apparel, I have showed
before, that it is an offense taken and not given: neither is i^ to be
considered whether men be offended or no, but whether they have any just cause
of offense. Many be offended with our Churches, and will neither hear sermon,
nor receive the sacraments in them: we must not therefore pull down our
Churches, or cease to preach, and administer the Sacraments in them. You must
remember the destinction of scandalum acceptum and scandalum datum: an offense
given, and an offense taken.

Chap. 7. the seventh Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Fol. 239. Sect. 3.
Thirdly, because also by experience we daily understand, that such as consent
in wearing this apparel, consent also in all other points of doctrine, and
keep the peace of the church, which is one of the principal causes of
edifying: contrariwise, such as refuse the same apparel, not only dissent and
disagree among themselves, but fall into diverse and strange opinions without
stay: and slander the gospel with their contentiousnesse, and tear in pieces
the Church of Christ with their factions and schisms: and be the cause why
both the word of God, and Christian magistrates be almost generally contemned.

T. C. Page 58. Sect. 2.
The third reason is, that they which consent in wearing the surplices,
consent also in all other points of doctrine, and they that do not wear it,
do not consent, not so much as amongst themselves. I^ this consent in the
points of religion be in the surplice, cope. etc. tell us I beseech you,
whether in the matter, or in the form, or in what h^dde and unknown quality
stands it? If it be n that the ministers use all one apparel, then it is
maruel^ that this being so strong a bond to hold them together in godly
unity, that it was never commanded of Christ, nor practiced of Prophets or
Apostles, ^ether of no other re^ormed Churches. I had thought wholly, that
those things which the Lord oppoynteth to maintain and keep unity with,
and ^specially the holy Sacraments of Baptism, and of the Lords Supper, had
been strong enough to have first of all knitte us unto the Lord, and
therefore also to his doctrine, and then one of us to an other, and that the
dissentings in such a Ceremony as a Surplice. etc. neither should nor could
in those that (...) unto God, break the unity of the Spirit, which is bound
with the bond of truth. And although there be which like not this apparel,
that think otherwise than either their brethren, or than in deed they ought
to do, yet a man may find greater dissent amongst those, which are united
in Surplice and Cope. etc. than there is amongst those which wear them not,
either with them selves, or with them that wear them. For how many there are
that wear Surplices, which would be (...) to say a Mass, than to hear a
Sermon, let all the world judge. And of those that (...) wear this
apparel, and be otherwise well minded to the Gospel, are there not which
wyl^ wear the Surplice and not the cappe: other that will wear both cap end
surplice, but not the tippet: and yet a third sort, that will wear surplice,
cappe, and tippet, but not the cop^? It has been the manner always of wise
and learned men to esteem of things by the causes, an^ not by the event, and
that especially in matters of religion, for if they should be esteemed of the
event, who is there which will not condemn the Israelites battle against Aye,
and (...) against the Bemamites? which notwithstanding, the cause which was
Gods will, and Gods ^maundement, iustifyeth. And therefore in a word I answer,
that if there be such con^ent amongst those which like well of this apparel,
and such ^arres amongst those yt like it not, as M. (...) would make the
world believe) neither is the w^aryng of a surplice. etc. cause of that
consent in the^, nor the not wearing, cause of that disagrement in the other.
But as our knowledge and love is imperfect here in this world, so is our
agreement and consent of judgment imperfect. And yet all these hard speeches
of yours, or uncharitable suspicions of papisme, Anabaptisme, catharisme,
dona^sme. etc. whereby you do as much (as lies in you) to cut us clean of from
you, shall not be able so to estrange us or separate us from you, but that we
will by gods grace hold, whatsoever you hold well, and keep that unity of
spirit, which is the bond of truth, even with you Master Doctor whom we s^ppose
as appears by this your book, to have set yourselfe further from us, than
numbers of those, which although they be content to receive the apparel, and
bear with things, yet would have been loath to have set down that against the
sincerity of the Gospel, and hind^rance of reformation, which you have bone.

Io. Whitgifte.
Such laws and orders as keep godly peace and unity in the Church do (...),
but the laws for apparel keep godly peace and unity in the Church, Ergo,
they edify. The M^nor I prove by experience of such as are subject to these
laws and by the event: which is a probable kind of reasoning, though it be
not necessary: neither may the examples of a few improve that, which is
generally true almost in all.

These persons, that you talk of, which be thus contrarily minded (if there be
any such, as I think you do but feign) yet do they keep the peace of the
Church, they condemn not their brethren, neither yet the apparel that they
them selves (peradventure for some special cause) wear not.

Some I know there are, which agree with us in wearing the apparel, and join
with you in contention: subscribe to all our orders and articles, and yet in
certain places and companies maintain your opinions, but of such we make no
account, neither I think do you, further than they may serve your turn.

Again I confess that there be some which have not received the apparel, and
yet greatly mislike many of your opinions, and keep with us the unity of the
Church, whom I for my part have always reverenced, and do reverence not only
for their singular virtue and learning, but for their modesty also. Wherefore
when I speak either of the one or of the other, I speak not of all, but of
the most part.

Certain it is, that those things which the Lord appoints to keep unity
with, and especially the sacraments ought to be the especial bond of the same:
and that nothing should separate those, that are coupled and joined therein:
but we see it fall out othe^wise, such is the crooked and rebellious nature of
man, and therefore has God also appointed Magistrates, and given them a^thoritie
to make orders and laws to maintain the peace and unity of the Church, that
those which of conscience and good disposition will not, by such laws and
orders may be constrained at the least to keep the external peace and unity
of the Church. Do you take this to be a good reason: The Sacrament^ are bond^
to keep and mainteyne the v^itie of the spirit, therefore there (...) no laws
or Magistrates T. ^. imagines such a perfection as is not to be ^ounde.
to provide for the external peace and quietness of the Church? your
imagination throughoute your whole book is of such a perfection in men, as
though they needed no laws or Magistrates to govern them, but that every man
might be as it were a law to himself, which whereunto it tends may easily
be coniectured.

I have not set down any thing (I trust) to the hinderance of the Gospel, or
of reformation* but I seek to reform such contentious spirits as be enimyes
unto both. And I believe that when some other (not only such as you mean, but
such as you least think of) shall understand the depth of your opinions,
together with the strangeness, untruth, da^gerousnesse and other circumstances
joined with them, they will think that I have spoken or written nothing either
untruly, or unnecessarily. In the mean time I discharge my conscience and
duty, and so will do (God willing) as long as I can either speak or write.

Chap. 7. the eight Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page. 239. Sect. 4.
I here omit that which I might as justly bring for this kind of apparel, as
you do for sitting at the communion: I mean a fit and profitable
signification, whereof M. Martyr speaks in the Epistle before mentioned on
this sort: I will not here say, that they which stand to the P. Martyr.
defense of this matter, may pretend some honest and just signification of the
apparel, and that not dissenting from the word of God, which is this: the
Ministers of the Church (as the Prophet Malachie witnesses) be Angels and
Gods messengers: but Angels for the most part appeared, being clothed in
white garments. I pray you how shall we debar the church of this
liberty, that it can not signify some good thing in setting forth their rites
and ceremonies, especially being so done, that no manner of Gods honor is
attributed unto them, and that they be in sight comely, and in number fevve,
and that Christian people be not with them ouerburdened, and matters of
greater importance be omitted.

T. C. Page 59. Line. 5.
The white apparel which is a note and a true representation of the glory and
pureness in the Angels, should be a lying sign, and pretense of that, which
is not in the Ministers, which are miserable Master Mar^yrs words pe^uer. ted*
and sinful men. And our savior Christ, which was the minister of God, and
pure from sin, and therefore meetest to wear the marks of pureness, used
no such kind of wede, saving only for that small time, wherein he would give
to his disciples in the mount, a taste of that glory which he should enjoy for
ever, and they with him: where for the time his apparel appeared as white as
snow. And if it be meet that ye ministers should represent the Angels in their
apparel, it is much more meet, that they should have a pair of wings as the
Angels are described to have, to put them in remembrance of their readiness
and quickness to execute their office, which may and ought to be in them, than
to wear white apparel, which is a token of pureness from sin and
infection, and of a glory, which neither they have, nor can have, nor ought so
much as to desire to have, as long as they be in this world. And whereas the
mainteyners of this apparel, have for their greatest defense, that it is a
thing mere civil: to let pass, that they confound ecclesiastical orders
with civil (which they can no more justly do, than to confound the Church
with the common wealth) I say to let that pass, they do by this means not
only make it an Ecclesiastical ceremonye, but also a matter of conscience.
For if ^o be that the white apparel of the Minister have any force, either to
move the people, or the Minister unto greater pureness, or to any other
godliness whatsoeue^, then it is that which ought to be commanded, and to be
obeyed of necessity, and to be retained, although the contrary were
forbidden. And then also if there be a virtue in a whitegarment, and the (...)
thereof be so strong to work godliness, it were meet that order were taken,

that the whitest cloth^ should be bought, that should be often (at the least
every week once) washed by a very good la^nder, and with soap: for if the

help, more white helps more, and that which is most white, helps most of
all to godliness. Although^ the Church have authority to make Ceremonies (so
they be according to the rules before recited of Gods glory, and profiting the
congregation) I could for all that never yet learn that it had power to give
new significations, as it were to institute new Sacraments. And by this
means is taken clean away from us, the hold which we have against the
Papists, whereby (against all the goodly shows which they make by the color
of these significations) we say that the word of God, and the Sacraments of
Baptism, and of the Supper of the Lord, are sufficient to teach, to
admoni^he, and to put us in remembrance of all duty whatsoever. So we are
now come to the superstition of the Grecians, for as they will have neither
graven nor car^ed image in their Churches, but painted, so will we neither have
graven nor carved, nor painted, but wouen. And truly I see no cause why w^ may
not have as well holy water and holy bread, if this reason which is here, be
good: for I am sure the significations of them are as glorious as this of the
surplice, and call to remembrance as necessary things. And if it be said,
that it may not be, least the number of Ceremonies should be to to great,
it may be easily answered, that these which we have may be taken away, and
those set in place of them. And therefore although the surplice have a black
spotte, when it is whitest, yet is it not so black as you make it with your
white significations, nor the cause so cu^ll, as you d^fende it. If you press
me with M. Martyrs and M. Bucers authority, An easy kind of answering.
I first say they were men, ^ therefore (although otherwise very watchful) yet
such as slept some times. And then I appeal from their Apocryphas, unto their
known writings, and from their private letters unto their public records.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have here only set down M. Martyrs words to show that I might as justly
bring in a fit and profitable signification of the apparel, as the authors of
the Admonition do of sitting at the communion. I did not allow their
signification of sitting, neither do I approve any such signification of
Apparel: but yet you will give me leave to set the one against the other, and
to show that I might as well do the one as they do the other.

You pervert Master Martyrs words: for he says that for as much as Angels
appeared Mere civil things may have signification.
in white apparel, and the Ministers of the Church be Angels and Gods
messengers, therefore the Church may appoint to her Ministers such apparel
in signification of their office. Which you do not answer, but range up and
down at your pleasure like unto a spaniell not taught to follow his game. M.
Martyr does not say that the apparel is a sign of pureness that is in the
Minister: and therefore all this that you The form of apparel may put a man
in mind of (...) duty.
write in confuting of that, might have been cut off, and very well spared.
But if Master Martyr should have said that it may be a sign of the
pureness that ought to be in Ministers, you are to seek for an answer as
yet. Christ being purity it self needed nothing to put him in mind thereof,
but man being impure may have external instruments to bid him (as it were)
remember what he ought to be. I think that several kinds of habites be
appointed to men of diverse degrees and calling, partly for that purpose: and
if a man in grave apparel use himself lightly or wantonly, we use commonly to
say such behavior becomes not that apparel, meaning that his habit and
apparel ought to put him in mind of modesty and gravity: and this does
argue that even mere civil things may have significations, which
overthrows an other argument of yours, whereby you would prove that the
apparel must of necessity be an ecclesiastical ceremony, because there is
attributed unto it some signification. Whether it be a matter meare civil, or
meare Ecclesiastical, or mixed of both, is not now the question, neither yet
whether the Church may be confounded with the common wealth or no, and therefore
I will not here deal with any of them, least I should confound both the
matter, and the Reader: only I speak of your argument, which is confuted by
common usage: for several habites in the universities signify several
degrees in learning: several kind of apparel, several callings and
functions in the common wealth: and this apparel does put every man in mind
of his duty, and yet they are not longer to be retained than the Magistrate
and the laws do permit: but are alterable according to times, places, and
persons: No man says that there is virtue in such garments or power to work
godliness, and therefore your pretty iestes builded upon that ground are vain
and toyish, and your topicall place not rightly understood: for it is meant of
such things, quae per se aliquid faciunt.

Every thing that signifies any thing is not a sacrament, for then were
Matrimony asacrament, and so were laying on of hands, and such like.

The Papists used unlawful signs, and attributed unto them life and death,
for they made them necessary to salvation.

Images whether they be graven, painted or wouen, are against the express
commandment of God, and therefore these be unapt similitudes, neither would
you have used them, if you had well considered M. Martyrs words.

The same I answer to your allegation of holy water and holy bread, they be
pseudoadiaphora, and have annexed unto them opinion of salvation and of
worship: all which we utterly remove from these orders.

Your answer to M. Martyrs and M. Bucers authority is sure, but not greatly
commendable: T. C. refuses ye judgment of learned men, when he cannot
otherwise anwere them. In men's wri tings the circumstances of time and place
must be distin guished.
for it is the easiest, but the worst answer that can be to deny the
authority of wise, learned, and famous men, and that without reason, and only
by cauilling. These be their known writings, and they be written of purpose
upon these controversies according to the circumstances of time, place and
person, and therefore if any thing in their public writings seem to be
against their judgments here, distinguishe the time and other circumstances,
and I doubt not but they will well agree with themselves. Interim, you do your
endeavor to deface them.

Admonition.
They have the show of evil, (seeing the Popish priesthood is evil.)

Answer to the Admonition. Page 240. Sect. 2.
When they were a sign and token of the Popish priesthood, then How apparel
is a sign of evil, and how otherwise.
were they evil, even as the thing was, which they signified: but now they be
the tokens and the signs of the ministers of the word of God which are good,
and therefore also they be good: no man in this Church of England is so
ignorant, but that he knows this apparel not to be now the signs of a
Massing Priest, but of a lawful Minister: wherefore it is a show of good: even
as it is in the like manner in the universities a show and sign of degrees in
learning, and therefore a show of good, except you will also condemn degrees
of learning. Neither is it any strange matter, for the self same thing in
diverse respects, and at diverse times, to be the sign both of good and evil.
The bells were a sign of evil, when they were rung to call to Mass, and to
stay storms and tempests, the self same bells are now a sign of good, when
they be rung to Sermons and other godly actions. The Churches themselves were a
sign of evil, when Idolatry was committed in them, and false doctrine
preached: now they be a sign of good, when God is rightly worshipped in them:
and his word truly preached. Many such examples I could bring, but a
reasonable man can gather of these sufficiently to confute your error.
Futhermore when we be willed to absteyne from all show of evil, it is meant of
evil life, and evil doctrine, least we do any thing with a scrupulous
conscience.

T. C. Page 59. toward the end.
M. Doctor proceeds to prove that they are signs and shows of good and not
of evil, as ye authors of the Admonition allege. To the proof whereof,
although (according to his manner) he repeateth diverse things before alleged,
yet the sum of all he has comprehended in an argument, which is, that for
so much as the ministers are good which wear them, therefore they are also
good: and because the ministers, whereof the apparel are notes, and marks, be
good: therefore those be good notes and good marks: so the reason is, they are
notes, and notes of good ministers, therefore they be good notes of the
ministers. So I will prove the names of Idols to be fit and convenient names
for good men to be called by. Beltshaser, Saddrake, Misacke, and Abed-nego were
names of Daniell and his three companions, and they were the names of good men,
therefore they are good names of men. And so the names of the Babilonian Idols,
are by this reason of M. Doctor justified to be good names. Again the golden
calfe, was a sign. Also it was Untruth.
a sign of the true God: therefore it was a true sign of God. Concerning the
notes of civil professions, and what difference is between those and this
cause, I have spoken before.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Admonition says thus: they have the show of evil, seeing ye popish
priesthood is evil. To this I answer that when they were a sign and token of
the popish priesthood, then they were evil, and a sign of evil, because the
thing was evil, which they signified: but now they are tokens of the Ministers
of the Gospel which are good, and therefore they are good, and the signs of
good. The reason is M. Bucers: I am not ashamed of my author, and it is
stronger than you can overthrow. For let me hear how you will answer this
argument: whatsoever signifies and notes that which is good, is a sign of
good: but this apparel signifies that which is good, Ergo, it is a sign of
good. The Mayor is evident. The Minor is thus proved. The ministry of the
Gospel is good: but this apparel is a sign of the ministry of the Gospel,
Ergo it is a sign of good. All the Logike you have can not answer this
argument, except you will deny the apparel to be the sign of the ministry
of the Gospel, which were to deny yt which is subject to the senses: the other
examples that I have used, does make this matter more manifest. I refer it to
the Reader to judge how fitly you have answered them.

Whether they be good signs, or no, is not now the question, but whether they
be signs of good, for that the Admonition denies. If you can conclude that
they be evil, because they be signs of evil, why may not I likewise say that
they be good, because they be signs of good. We commonly call that a good
sign, which is a sign of good, neither can you place this reason in any
fallacian, it is a sign of good, Ergo, it is a good sign: for it is called a
good sign in this respect only, that it signifies that, which is good.

Those names in respect of those whom they signified were good: in the respect
of the External things may be both good and evil in diverse respects. The
diverse (...) used b^ T. C. in answering.
Idols, to whom they properly belonged, they were evil: for such external
things in diverse respects may be both good and evil. The golden calfe was an
Idol made to be worshipped, no sign of the true God, and therefore indiscreetly
here brought in.

Wheresoever I have before alleged these things you speak of, yet be they
answered neither here nor there: and this the Reader may note if he list, that
whersoeuer you cannot answer, there either you frumpe and girde after your
manner, or you cavil and confute your own imagination, or closely pass the
matter over in silence, or post it over to some other place, where you speak
nothing of it.

Admonition.
They work discord, they hinder the preaching of the Gospel.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 241. Sect. 2.
This is an argument a non causa ad causam: it is not the apparel that Non
causa procausa.
works discord, or hinders the preaching of the Gospel, no, no more than
it is the word of God that engenders heresies, or wine that makes drunk, or
the sword that murthereth, or the law that works injury. etc. But it is the
sinister affection, the rebellious nature, the contentious mind of man. For
who began this contention, or when was it begone? Truly if the law for
apparel were utterly abrogated, yet would not your contention cease, nay, it
would burst out much more vehemently, and in far greater matters, as this
your Admonition declares. And therefore I think rather, that the law for
apparel will stay further contentions, especially if it be duly executed.

T. C. Page 60. Sect. 1.
You say the cause of disorder is not in the apparel, but in the minds of
men. You mean I am sure, those that refuse the apparel, but if you make them
authors of discord, because they consent not with you in wearing, do you not
see it is It is as sone said but not so truly, because the one ret^yneth
order, and the other breaks it.
as soon said, that you are the causers of discord, because you do not consent
with those which wear not? For as there should be unity in that point if all
did wear that apparel, so should there be, if all did wear none of it. It
is a very unequal comparison that you compare the use of this apparel, with
the use of wine, and of a sword, which are profitable and necessary, but it
is more intolerable, that you match it with the word of God. I could throw
it as far down, as you li^te it up, but I will not do so. This only I will
say, if there were no harm in it, and that it were also profitable, yet
forasmuch as it is not commanded of God expressly, but a thing (as you say)
indifferent, and notwithstanding is cause of so many incommodities, and so
abused (as I have before declared) it ought to be sufficient reason to abolishe
them: seeing that the brazen serpent, which was instituted of the Lord
himself, and contained a profitable remembrance of the wonderful benefit of
God toward his people, was beaten to powder, when as it began to be an
occasion of falling unto the children of Israel: and seeing that S. Paul
after the love feasts (which were kept at the administration of the Lords 1.
Cor. 11.
Supper, and were means to nourish^ love amongst the Churches) were abused and
drawn to another use than they were first ordained, did utterly take them
away, and command that they should not be used any more.

Io. Whitgifte.
I may answer you almost in the self same words and manner, that M. Zuinglius
answered one Balthazar an Anabaptist, who charged him then, as you charge us
now Zuinglius ad. Balt.
in this place: consider, says he, who be the authors and causes of
dissension: whether we that attempt nothing of our own private authority, but
have submitted our selves to the judgment of the Church, and of those that be
governors of the same, or rather you, who so arrogantly, without any such
authority do what you list, speak what you list, allow and condemn at your
pleasure* But for further trial hereof, I refer you to such notes, as I have
collected out of Zuinglius and others, and placed in the second edition of my
Page 19. etc.
Answer to the Admonition.

Our consenting is according to our duty required of us by the word of God
toward such as be in authority: your dissenting is contrary to your duty of
obedience in such cases enjoined unto you by the word of God. If all refused
the apparel with you, yet would you not be quiet, for you make this the least
cause of your schism. I do not compare this apparel with the word of God, but
by these examples I show the unaptness of such arguments as be a non causa ad
causam. You have thrown it down as low as you can, and if you could cast it
lower, your will is good, and therefore to say you could do it and will not, is
as great an offense as was the midwiues lying to Pharao.

I have showed in my answer, that as the case now stands, it is rather
commodious: as for abuses in it, as it is now used, you have hitherto showed
none, and if it were abused, yet does it not follow that therefore it is to be
removed, except the abuse could not be taken away without the abolishing of
the thing, as it was in the brazen serpent: which serpent though it was by God
commanded to be set up, yet was it (as M. Martyr says) but for that time,
wherein power was given unto it to heal and cure those that were bitten of the
serpents, Number. 21. and therefore being but temporal, and thus abused, Number. (...).
was lawfully taken away, neither would the Idolatry committed unto it
otherwise have ceased. But do you think that any man does worship the
apparel, as the Israelites did worship the serpent? S. Paul in that Chapter of
the. 1. Cor. reproves 1. Cor. 11.
them for certain abuses about the Lords Supper, whereof this was one of the
chief, that they made it an occasion of feasting and banqueting, which manner
of feasting in the Church was not only borrowed of the gentiles, as M. Bullinger
says, but occasion also of much contention, and very unseemly for that time
and place. And as Master Calvin says upon that place. The Corinthians are
reproved, because they had mingled Calvin.
profane banquettes (and that also with the contumely of the poor) with that
holy and spiritual feast: and therefore expedient it was, that they should
betaken away, and if you can show the like incurable abuse in the apparel, I
will cry away with it, as fast as you do.

Admonition.
They keep the memory of Egypt still amongst us, and put us in mind of that
abomination whereunto they in times past have served, they bring the
ministry into contempt, they offend the weak, they encorage the obstinate.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 241. Sect. 3. 4. 5.
You say, they keep the memory of Egypt still amongst us. etc. No truly, no
more than does the Church, the Pulpit, the Bells. etc. but they teach us the
true use of Christian liberty: and that all things be clean to those that be
clean. Finally, that godly men may well use that which wicked have abused,
howsoever ungodly.

They bring the ministry into contempt: Only with you, and such as you (by
your continual crying out against them) have deluded: contemners of good
orders, laws, and statutes, are to be severely punished for their contempt.
Good laws, orders, and statutes are not to be altered or dissolved, because by
such as forget their duties, they are contemned.

They offend the weak, and encourage the obstinate: Those that be offended
with them, think themselves most strong, and glory therein with condemning of
others. The obstinate be encouraged through the schisms, and contentions,
that you trouble the Church, and slander the Gospel with: which one day you
will understand, if in time you do not repent.

T. C. Page. 60. Sect. 2.
The rest of that which follows in this matter, is nothing else, but either
that which has bin oftenti^es repeated, or else reprochefull words, or unjust
accusations of contempt of Magistrates, without any proof at all, and
therefore are such as either are answered, or which I will not voutchs^e to
answer, especially seeing I mean not to True, for (...) ^aue (...) for one.
give reproach and reuiling for reuiling: and seeing that I have before
protested of our humble submission, and loving fear or reverence, which we
bear to the Prince, and those which are appointed Magistrates underneath her.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a short answer, to say you will not voutchsafe to answer. What
reproachful words, or unjust accusations are here uttered by me? except this

are not to be altered and dissolved, because by such as forget their duties,

Whether of us two have more offended in reprochings and reuilings, because we

And therefore I will conclude, that forsomuche as the ceremonies of
Antichristianitie, are not, nor can not be, the fittest to set forth the
Gospel, and for that they are occasions of fall to some, of hinderaunce to
other some, of grief and alienation of minds unto others (the contrary of
all which ought to be considered in establishing of things indifferent in the
Church) therefore neither is this apparel fittest for the minister of the
Gospel, and if it were, yet considering the incommodities that come of the use
of it, it should be removed.

Io. Whitgifte.
This conclusion consists wholly upon false principles, whereof though some
of them have bin before spoken, yet not one of them proved: for trial whereof I
referr^ the Reader to that, which we have both written of this matter.

Here you quote in the margente the sixte of John, verse. 38. where Christ
says, that he came down from heaven not to do his own will, but the
will of his father that sent him. Likewise the twelfth of John, verse. 49.
where also he says, that he has not spoken of him self, but the father
that sent him, gave him commandment what he should say, and what he should
speak. And the first to the Corinthians. 11. Chapter, verse. 23. where S.
Paul says, that he received of the Lord that which he delivered unto them.

text of Scripture, without amplifying or expounding the same? when I know
your meaning herein, you shall understand more of my mind. In the mean
time, this I am sure of, that the Homilies appointed to be read in the Church,
are learned, godly, agreeable to Gods word, and more effectual to edification,
than a number of your Sermons, which consiste in words only, and entreat of
little else, but of cappe, surplesse. etc. Archbishop, Lord Bishop. etc. the
end whereof is not edification, but contention. Homilies read in the Church
have always been commendable, Homilies red in the Church are commendable.
and usual even from the beginning, look Augustine, Chrysostom and others:
and why may not Articles and Injunctions, being collected to the setting
forth of true Religion and good orders in the Church be read there also as
in a most meet place? But I perceive you are enemies to reading, because you
love so well to hear your selves talking, I will say no worse.

T. C. Page 60. Sect. 4.
You know they allow studying for sermons, and amplifying and expounding of
the scriptures, and why then do you ask? But by this question you would have
your Reader think, or at the least have the Authors of the Admonition in
suspicion, that they lyked not of study for sermons. God make us more careful
of the good name of our brethren, than by such light and ungrounded
suspicions, nay without any suspicion, nay, contrary to that which is daily
seen and hard, to raise up such slanderous reports of them. But Homilies are
smally beholding unto you, which to prove that they may be read in the Church,
allege that Augustine and Chrysostom made sermons in their Churches: for that
which we call a sermon, they called of the Greek word an Homily, so that the
argument is, that Augustine and Chrysostom preached sermons or homilies in
their Churches, therefore we may read Homilies in ours. But peradventure you
have some better thing to say for them afterward.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have heard some fautors of theirs earnestly reason against studying for
sermons, and it is not long since it was almost in plain terms in the Pulpit
preached. I think they study for their sermons, but how diligently they
study, or whether they would seem to study, or no, I know not: the words
of the Admonition are very suspicious.

That which I speak of Augustine and Chrysostom aptly serves for my
purpose: for although they were Augustines and Chrysostomes sermons, yet in
that they have both committed them to writing, and left them to their
posterity, it argues that they thought them to be very profitable for the
Church: Neither do I see any cause why they should rather now be thought
unlawful to be read, than they were then to be preached: but yet one thing we
may note, that both Augustine and Chrysostom writ their Homilies or
sermons, and therefore it may be that they did also sometime read them in the
Church.

It may be that he which has an hundredth pounds by the year, for which four
sermons only are preached. etc. (if there be any such) takes more pains for
the Church, is more careful for the state of it, suffers more opprobrious
words, and false slanders (which is not the least kind of persecution) for
doing his duty, and keeping him self within the listes of obedience
toward God and his Prince, than those do that glory most of persecution,
and lack of living. He that has much, is also occasioned to spend much:
neither is his pains the less, but more, if he be once desirous to do his
duty. And the higher he is in degree, the more subject to the envious
backbiter, and to the slanderous tongue.

Those that have such Palaces, and make such noise when they go in the

of God, profit their Country more in one month, than you and all your
company do in a whole year: Nay, I would to God it might be said you
profited. Their pomp and their Palaces are by lawful authority committed
unto them, and the true Martyrs of God have occupied the same, or the like
before them, and yet Martyrs too.

Who amongst you they be that have had Bishoprics offered unto them, I know
not: but if they boast of their denial, and have suborned you to make it
known, they have their reward. It may be the Bishopric was to little for
them, and they looked for some greater, and so missed both: but I will not
judge: surely this brag comes here out of place.

The heat of the tongue and backbiter, both I and other may greatly complain
of: and I hope we get not our living by going up and down the streates, and
feasting daily at other men's tables, or as Diogenes did, by disdayning and
contemning all others. Melius est vinum bibere cum ratione, quam aquam cum

with haughtiness and pride. It is also more acceptable to God to dwell in a

preferment, and such as be arrogant and wilful, may seem to contemn the
same.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 64. Sect. 2.
Here you are in your ruff, but you show your ignorance and contemptuous
stomach. You have given sentence that the names of Metropolitan,
Archebishoppe. etc. and their offices, were devised by Antichriste. Likewise
that they are strange and unheard of in Christ's Church. Also that they be
plainly in Gods word forbidden: and last that they are utterly with speed
to be removed. If you can prove all these points, it is time the Church were
transformed, and the whole kind of government of this Realm altered. But if
you can not prove them, then is it high time that such insolency should be
repressed, and perturbers of Churches and common wealths reformed. Well, I
must do the best I can to improve all these points, which I might do
sufficiently, if I should as barely deny them, as you have affirmed them: but
I will not deal so nakedly in so great a matter.

T. C. Page 61. Sect. 2.
Of those offices something has bin spoken before, where it has bin proved
out of the words of Christ, that neither the names, nor offices of Archbishop,
or Archdeacons do agree to the ministry of the Gospel. Now as M. Doctor

be the principal stoppes and hindrances of his confused platform, and that
also they be the enemies unto sects and contentions, wherewith he is so greatly
delighted. Moreover he and many of his adherents, be of that nature whereof
Caesar and Pompey were reported to be: the one could abide no superior, the
other no equal: even so is it with them, as it is well known to those that
have bin conversant with some of them. And although they pretend equality in
words, yet if you mark well their writings, it shall easily appear, that they
mean it in others, not in them selves, for they would have him to be the best
rewarded, and most reverenced, that has the most and best gifts, which every
one of these chief captains persuaded himself to have: so that in ye end
there would be as great a do (after their manner) which of them should be the
chief, as ever there was betwixt the Bishop of Rome, and other Bishops, or
betwixt Canterbury and York in times past. In the mean time you may easily
understand, if you please, that notwithstanding they themselves would be
exempted from the jurisdiction of Archbishop, Lord Bishop. etc. yet do they
challenge unto themselves as great jurisdiction over their Parishes, and as
lofty dominion over Prince, Nobles, and all, as ever the Pope did over the
whole Church, as shall (God willing) be more fully declared, when I come to
speak of their seigniory and kind of government. Now to his Reply.

Where has something bin spoken before of these offices and names? Or what
arguments have you hitherto used to prove that they do not agree to the
Ministers of the Gospel: If you have so done, I trust you are fully answered
in that same place. But I promise you I do not presently remember where you
have hitherto done it. If you mean the places of Math. 20. etc. you have your
full answer.

I have bestowed the more cost and labor in this matter, because I see your
chief force bent against it. For mark you who will, all your drift is against
superiors. But let us hear your reasons.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page. 61. Sect. 3.
And for the names first, I desire the reader, that we be not thought studious
of contention, because we strive about the name of Archbishop. etc. For this is
not to strive about words, unless it be counted a strife of words, which is
taken for the maintenance of the word of God, as it has before appeared out of
the Evangelists. Then it must be remembered which Aristotle says very well in
his Elenches, that (...) which is, that names are imitations, or as it were,
express images of the things whereof they are names, and do for the most
part bring to him that hears them, knowledge of the things that are
signified by them. Howsoever the thing be it self, yet oftentimes it is
supposed to be as the name pretends, and thereupon follows that a man may
be easily deceived, when the names do not answer to the things whereof they
are names. There may be (I grant) a free and more licencious use of names, but
that license is more tolerable in any thing, rather tha^ in matters of the
Church and salvation. And if there be some cases, wherein names that are not so
proper, may be borne with, yet are there also which are intolerable. As who
can abide that a minister of the Gospel should be called by the name of ^
Leui^e, or sacrificer, unless it be he which would not care much, if the
remembrance of the death and resurrection of our savior Christ, were plucked
out of his mind? Again it is unlawful for any man to take upon him those
titles which are proper to our savior Christ: but the title If Christ be
called an Archbishop, then is not the title devised by Anti^hrist.
of an Archbishop is only proper to our savior Christ, therefore no man may
take that unto him. That it is proper to our savior Christ, appears by that
which S. Peter says, where he calls him 1. Epist. 5. Heb. 13. Act. 3. 5.
Heb. 1^.
(...), which is Archesheph^ard, or Archbishop: for Bishop and shepherd are
all one. And in the Hebrews where he is called the great shepherd of the
sheep: and in the Acts, and Hebrews, archeleader of life and of salvation,
which titles are never found to be given unto any, but vnt^ our savior
Christ, and are proper titles of his mediation, and therefore can not be
without ^olde presumption, applied unto any mortal man.

Io. Whitgifte.
To contend about names, when there is an agreement of the ma^ter and
substance, has alwaye^ bin taken for a manifest note of a contentious
Sophister. But your answer is ready that you contend for the substance also,
which (...) true you might have cut of the most part of this section, whereby
you would excuse your self for improuing the name of an Archbishop. But to
come to the purpose, you say It is unlawful for any man to take upon him those
titles, which are proper to our savior Christ: but the title of Archbishop is
only proper to our savior Christ, therefore. etc. The minor you prove by the
words of S Peter. 1. Epist. chap. 5. where he calls him (...) and Acts. 3.
5. and. 13. to the Hebrews. etc. where he is called the great shephearde of the
sheep, archeleader. etc. But before I come to your minor, I must a little
better search your mayor, for you pass it over smothly, as though there could
be nothing said unto it.

I grant that those names which be proper unto God, can not be given to any
other, Names proper to God may in some respect be attributed to other.
in that respect that they are proper unto God: but that they can in no other
respect be attributed to any other, it is untrue, and against the manifest
words of the scriptures. What name is more proper unto God, than is this name,
God. And yet is the same also attributed unto man. Moses Exodus 7. is called
Pharaoes God, because he was Gods minister to speak unto Phar^o in his name,
and to execute his judgments upon him. Nec vero (as M. Caluin^ says) quicqua^
sibi detr^xit Deus. etc. Call. in Harm.
Neither did God derogate any thing from himself, in that he transferred (his
name) unto Moses, because he does so communicate that, which is proper to
himself with his ser^ants, that he still remains whole. In the. 22. of Exodus
the Judges are called Gods, ^ in the. 82. Psalm, Magistrates are called Gods
also. In the. 23 of Math. Christ speaks of the names of Master, Father, and
Doctor, as proper to himself, for he says, be not y^ called Rabbi, for one is
your master, to wit Christ. etc. And call no man your father upon earth, for
there is but one your father, which is in heaven. Be not called Doctors for one
is your Doctor, even Christ, and yet no man is so ignorant that he will deny
these names to be common to others, though not in the same respects, as I have
showed before. Christ also calls himself a Pastor, Ioh. 10. and so does S.
Peter call him Bishop and Pastor, 1. Epist. 3. and so he is properly and of
himself, and yet these names be communicated with other. In the. 8. of Ioh. he
is called Lux mundi, which is a most proper name, aptly given unto him, and yet
does he himself give the same name to his Disciples, Mat. 5. Diverse such
examples might I show for ye improuing of your mayor, but these be sufficient.

Thus therefore I answer in few words, both to your mayor and minor, that
some How ye name Archbishop may be trans^rred to other than Christ.
names that be proper to God are also attributed unto man, but not in the same
respect: for they belong unto God properly and per s^, to man per accidens, and
in respect that he is the minister of God, and such other like causes. And
therefore although this name Archshepheard, or (if you will) Archbishop, be
proper to Christ in the respect that he is not only the chief shepherd,
but also the only shephearde, to whom the sheep do properly perteyne, and
to whom all the other shepherds must of necessity submit themselves, and in
whose name, and under whom only, the Church is governed, yet in the respect
of the external policy of the Church, and of Pastors and Bishops that are
to be kept and directed in such things as perteyne to their du^tie, the same
name of Archbishop may aptly and fitly be attributed unto him, that has the
ordering and direction of the rest, in the external government of the Church.

But whiles you confound the spiritual and the external regiment of the
church, The (...) and external gou^rnment confounded.
you confound both your self and your reader also: In the spiritual regiment
Christ is only the pastor: and al other be his sheep. In the external regiment
there be many other Pastors: In the spiritual regiment Christ is only the
Archbishop, and governs all to whom all other must make their account, ^nt in
the external government there be many Archbishops, as the state of every
church requires. In the spiritual government Christ is only the prince, the
king, the judge, and in respect of him all other be subjects: but in the
external government, there be several countries, several kings, princes,
magistrates, judges. Again in the spiritual kingdom of Christ, and regiment of
his Church, there is no respect of persons, but all be equal: In the external
regiment and government there is and must be degrees of persons: To be short,
in respect of Christ and his spiritual gouernmente, there is neither
Magistrate nor Archbishop. etc. But in the respect of men, and the external
face of the Church, there are both, and that according to Christ's own
order, as shall hereafter be declared. So that now you may perceive your
error to be in not rightly distinguishing the states, and times of the Church
and government.

And if any man will reply and say, that it is not said that our savior

yet notwithstanding there is no more heads or the church but he: And i^ it be
further said, that these Archbishops are but under and as it were subordinate
Archbishops, I say that a man may as well say, that men may be also vnderheades

you understand an ^xternall ruler or governor of any particular nation, or
Church, (in which signification head is usually taken) then I do not perceive
why the Magistrate may not How the ma gistrat^ (...) be called (...) of the

as well be called the head of the Church, that is the chief governor of it
in the external policy, as he is called the head of the people, and of the
common weal^h. And as it is no absurdity to say, that the civil magistrate is
head of the common wealth, next and immediately under God (for it is most
true) so is it none to say, that under God also he is head of the Church, that
is chief governor as I have before said. Constantine in an Epistle that he
writes to the people of Alexandria, Bishops called heads of churches, and yet
ye Popes supremacy i^ usurped.
as it is reported by Athanasius Apol. 2. calls Bishops Ecclesiarum capita,
the heads of their Churches. And yet is the Popes Supremacy vsurp^d, both
because it takes from Magistrates that which is due unto them, and also
usurps the authority of Christ in remittyng and retaynyng sins, in making
Laws contrary to Gods Laws, which he says be necessary to Salvation, in
making his Supremacy a matter of Salvation, and in chalengyng authority over
the whole Church of Christ, and an hundredth such like presumptions.

The Archbishop being both under God and his Prince, has his name only in
respect of his authority in certain causes above other Bishops, and that but
in one province or kingdom only, neither can either the name or use of it (as
it is in this Church) offend any but such as be offended with all superiors,
and think that none ought to be better than themselves.

Archbishop though the persons at sometime have degenerated, yet the name has
continued in the same signification, and therefore the reasen is nothing like,
except you will also for the like cause condemn the name of a Bishop, or of a
king, for there have been many evil men called by the name of bishops; and
many tyrants by the name of kings, and yet the names never the worsse. If names
should be changed so often as they be abused, some had need to have an office
only to invent new names. There was a certain kind of heretics that called

it was not lawful to bring in any strange doctrine, so it was not lawful to

Io. Whitgifte.
This is your first argument, the Phariseys coming to S. John Baptist, after
he had denied to be either Christ or Elias, or an other Prophet, conclude, if
thou be neither Christ nor Elias, nor of the Prophets, why baptizest thou?
Ergo, there may be no Archbishops, which is your meaning. But least you should

allegation of the Scripture. For the Phariseys do not say unto him: If thou
be neither Christ, nor Elias, nor of the Prophets, but these be the words of
the text, If thou be not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet, now there is
a great difference betwixt these two kind of speeches, if thou be not of the
Prophets, and if thou be not the Prophet. For the first signifies that they
should ask him, whether he were any of the Prophets, the other whether he were
that prophet whom they looked for to be such a one as Moses was, according to
that which is written Deuteronomy. 18. verse. 15. for else John would Deuteronomy. 18.

the Church, but of such extraordinary persons as they looked for to come, as
Christ, Elias, or that prophet. Thirdly, they did not recite all the ordinary
functions, as Leuite and Priest, which were then most ordinary and almost
only at that time: so that your reason has neither form, nor truth in it.

moving of the spirit of God. So that it appears that the ministry of the
gospel and the functions thereof, ought to be from heaven, and of God, and not
invented by the brains of men: from heaven I say and heavenly, because
although it be executed by earthly men, and the ministers also are chosen by
men like unto themselves: yet because it is done by the word and institution
of god, that has not only ordained, that the word should be preached, but
has ordained also in what order and by whom it should be preached, it may be
well accounted to come from heaven and from god.

Neither is there any new ministry or order appointed in this church,
because The Archbishop no new ministry.

Sacraments, and Quoad ministerium do not differ from other pastors (in respect
of whom they are called Archbishops) but touching order and government, as you
may read afterward in the answer to the admonition. So that all this which
is here spoken is grounded upon a false principle. For you would make the
reader believe, that to institute an Archbishop, is to institute a new
ministry, wherein you are maruellously ouershot. The Jews had government in
their church, and superiority in the ecclesiastical estate, and so have we.
But you may not tie the church of Christ to the pattern of the Jews synagoge,
for that were to make it servile.

Seeing therefore that these functions of the Archbishop and Archdeacon, are not

of god, it follows that they are of the earth, and so can do no good but
much harm in the church, And if any man will say that we do the Church great
injury, because we do tie her to a certain number of orders of ministers, as
it were to a stake, so that we may not devise new functions: I say that both
the church and Christ does accuse him again: Christ esteems himself to have
injury, because that by this means he is imagined not to have been careful
and provident enough for his church, in that he has left the ministry,
wherein does consist the life of the church (being that whereby it is begotten)
so rawly and imperfect, that by permitting it to the ordering of men, there is
a great danger of error, which he might have set without all danger, by a
word or two speaking.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your proofs hitherto alleged are most insufficient to iustiste this
conclusion, and yet do you boldly go on as though all were sure. This is but
beldenesse and confidencie, it is not sound and pithie dealing. I still deny
that there is any other ministry in the Church, because there are
Archebishops, than is by the word of God confirmed: But you have not yet
proved by either Scripture or reason, that there ought not to be governors or
superiors among the ministers of the Gospel, to whom any other names may be
given, than is expressed in the word, which you ought to prove, else you do
but dally, and study with vain words to enlarge your book.

It is manifest that Christ has left the government of his Church, touching
the external policy in sundry points to the ordering of men, who have to
make orders and laws for the same, as time, place, and person requires, so
that nothing be done contrary to his word, as it is before proved, Tract. 2.

The Church of the other side ryseth against him, for that he makes Christ
less careful for her, than he was for that under the law. For (...) me in the
whole volume of the testament, is there any kind or degree of ministry,
whereof God is not the certain and express author? Was there ever any man (I
except Jeroboam and such profane men) either so holy or so wise, or of such
great knowledge yt ever did so much as dream of instituting of a new
ministry? After the long wandering of the arc in the wilderness, when it
came to be placed in Jerusalem, tell me if any besides the Levites and priests,
the ordinary ministers, and the prophets which were unmediatly stirred up of
God, were found to have ordained any office or title which was not commanded
or whether there was at any time any thing added or enjoined to those offices
of priesthobe, and Leuiteship, which was not by the law prescribed.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely here is nothing but vain repetitions of that false principle, whereupon
this tantalogie and multiplication of words is builded, that is, yt the
institution of T. C, faulteth still in the petition of the principle.
an Archbishop is the institution of a new ministry, as though the apostle S.
Paul when he placed Timothy at Ephesus and Titus at Creta, did institute a
new ministry, because he gave the^ authority and jurisdiction over ye rest,
as it is afterward proved: or the Church when it did apoynt one among the
Bishops to govern the rest in Scismatis remedium, to remedy schisms, as
Hierom says, and as it shall more at large hereafter be declared. Neither can
it therefore be said, that Christ does show him self less Christ is not
less careful for this church than for that under the law.
careful for his church, than he did for that under the law: For his
carfulness appears and consists in this that he has now much more
plainly set down the doctrine of salvation in all points, than it was in the
law, and has also ordained that there should be not only fit ministers to
publish that doctrine, but offices also to govern the people in godliness. As
for names and titles and other external things variable according to diverse
circumstances, he has left them to the liberty of his Church, as I have
before declared: which is one part of his singular goodness toward the
Church, in that it is not so seruilely tied to external things, and to the
letter as it was under the law.

And it is evident, that under the law, there were offices and titles in the
church, which Titles and offices in ye church under the law where God is not ye

expressed whether the window was of glass or of crystal, or of neither.
Moreover he is not prescribed to make a cover for it, and yet it had one as is

there appointed, but left to the discretion of Noah. There are many other
things required to the making of such an Arc, whereof there is no express
mention in that place. To conclude, Noah being in the Arc, did things which

In the tabernacle the Church is yet more expressly showed forth. Moses that

wrought it Bezalaell and Aholiab, most cunning workmen, and yet observe how the
Lord* leaves nothing to their will: but tells not only of the bourdes, of

same, I say with Pellicane These things are particularly described according
to the word of the Lord, that the people might know that they ought not so much
to obey Moses precepts as the will of God, in building the Tabernacle, and in
freely offering to the same their gold, their silver, their brass, their
purple. etc. the which otherwise they would have abused to their own vanities:
and that also they might not be without that beauty in ceremonies and
worshipping of God, which they see among the Gentiles. Moreover that they
might have matter to occupy them with, least they should fall to
slothfulness and idleness. So that of this place it may be well gathered,
that nothing wherein the worship of God does consist, is to be used without his
prescription, but how you can aptly apply this figure to the external
government, and policy of the Church, I cannot well understand: and if you
may so use it, yet do you but allegory, which is no good kind of proof because
allegories may be applied according to every particular man's invention. But all
that can be truly gathered of this figure is (as I have said before) that,
Calui^e. 35. Exo. in. expos 2. praecept^*
no kind of worship may be brought into the Church of God, which is not
grounded upon his word, and therefore Ma. Calvin speaking of this
tabernacle says that God gave precepts of the tabernacle and things
perteyning to it. Ne externa pietatis exercitia, quae vidimus fuisse admodum
necessaria, populum deficerent, Least the people should want the outward
exercises of godliness, which we see to have been very necessary. And again
he says, that when Moses in the mountain did see the example of the
Tabernacle, he was then instructed De vero Dei cultu and mysterijs. of the true
worship of God and of heavenly mysteries. And again speaking of this
Tabernacle he says: Lex Iudaeos ad spiritualem solum Dei cultum instituit, sed
ceremonijs vestitum, vt ferebat temporis ratio. The law did institute the
Jews only to the spiritual worship of God, but yet covered with ceremonies,
as the time required. Therefore in this figure there was only expressed what
should be done in the worshipping of God, and not in the external policy and
government of the Church.

Let us come to the temple, which as it was more nere the time of Christ: so it
does more lively express the Chur^he of God which now is. Solomon the wyse^t

for the vessels of the temple, nor ^or the beauty of it, but according to the
form that was enjoined him, as appears in the first of the kings, and the

And it is certain that both David and Solomon appointed orders, the one about
the Tabernacle, the other about the Temple, which we read not in Scripture

Now if the holy Ghost in figures and tropes does so carefully, (and as a

much more is it to be thought that he has performed this? If in the
shadows, how much more in the body? If he have done this in earthly things,
and which shall perish, how is it to be thought, that he has (...)
performed it in heavenly, and those which abide for ever? And then tell me,
what are those times of which it was said, the Mel*sias when he comes will
tell us all? Is it a like thing that he which did not only appoint the temple
and the tabernacle, but the ornaments of them, would not only neglect the
ornaments of the church, but also that without the which (as we are borne in
hand) it cannot long stand? Shall we think that he which remembered the bars
there, has forgotten the pillars here? or he yt there remembered the pinnes,
did here forget the master builders? how he should there remember the besoms,
and here forget Archbishops, if any had been needful? that he should there make
mention of the snuffers to purge the lights, and here pass by the lights
themselves? And to conclude, that he should make mention there of the moates,
and here say nothing of the beams? there reckon up the gnattes, here keep
silence of the camel^es? What is this else but that which Aristotle says,
(...), that is, to look to small things, and not to look to great, which if it
can not fall into the Lord, let it be a shame to say, that the chief pillar
and vpholder of the Church is not expressed in the scripture, nor can not be
concluded of it.

Io Whitgifte.
You have before confessed Page 15. that certain things are left to the order
of the Church, T. C. ^reth by (...)
because they are of that nature which are varied by times, places, persons and
other circumstances. (...). which is sufficient to answer whatsoever you have
here spoken of the care^ulnesse of the holy ghost in the truth it self, above
figures and tropes. Although there is no doubt but the holy ghost was as
careful in the one as in the other, and loved the one people as well as the
other, and therefore it may be an argument a paribus, but not ^ minori, as you
seem to make it. I have told you before also why god did more particularly
prescribe every ceremony to the Israelites in the law, than he has done to
his people in the Gospel.

whatsoever. Christ which is the Messiah has told us all things that are
necessary to salvation, John. 20. and so is that place in the. 4. of John to be
understood.

We make not an Archbishop necessary to salvation, but profitable for the
government of the Church, and therefore consonant to the word of God, as shall
be declared. We know the Church of Christ is not builded upon any man, either
as upon foundation, or pillars, if we speak properly, but upon Christ
himself, and his word, which remain immovable: we know also, that the same
Church may stand wit^out the external help of man But yet has God appointed
functions in his Church, both ecclesiastical, and civil, as means to keep
it in external peace, di^cipline, and or^er: and though he has not expressed
the names, yet has he allowed the (...). Among men the chief pillar that
vpholdeth the Church is the Christian prince and magistrate, and yet where
have you in the Gospel any such express mention made thereof, as there is in
the appointing of the tabernacle of Beesoms, snuffers. etc. which e^amples you
use in derision: such is your modesty and reverence. We know that all things
nec^ssary to salvation are much more plainly expressed in the Gospel, than in
the law: We are also well assured that Christ in his word has fully and
plainly comprehended all things requisite to faith and good life: but yet has
he committed certain orders of ceremonies, and kind of gouernmente, to the
disposition of his Church, the general rules given in his word being
observed, and nothing being done contrary to his will and commandment therein
contained, as ^ have proved before.

The Church must not only be brought to persection, but also be preserved therem*

governors. Your mayor also conteyneth dangerous doctrine, including as well
the christian magistrate as the Archbishop. And it is in effect all one with
this argument: The Church is fully builded and brought to perfection and
complete vnit^e without the Christian magistrate: Therefore Christian
magistrates are not to be retained, which is the very argument of the
Anabaptists against Christian magistrates. You must therefore understand, that
the Church must as well be preserved and kept in perfection, peace and unity,
as builded and brought thereunto, and that such offices and functious are
lawful as tend to that end, and be therefore by lawful authority appointed,
howsoever some weyward persons think the contrary.

And that without these ministeries the Church may be complete, it appears by
that which is in the fourth to the Ephesians, where it is said that Christ gave
some Apostles, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Doctors, to the restoring of
the saints unto the work of the ministry, until we all come to the unity
of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, and unto a perfect man.

Io. Whitgifte.
In that place to the Ephesians there is no mention made of Deacons and
widows, The place in the. 4. Ephe. discussed.
nor of your elders, and therefore it makes as much against them as it does
against Archbyshops. Moreover it has Apostles, Evangelists, and Prophets, all
which you seclude from the state of this Church. Thirdly it conteyneth those
ministeries only which are occupied in the word and administration of the
sacraments, not those which perteyne to order and discipline as you
afterward your self confess, and therefore I understand not how that place
can help you any thing at all.

The learned writers have thus reasoned against the Pope: that forasmuch as
Apostles, Prophets. etc. are sufficient for the building of the Church,
therefore there ought to be no Pope. The argument and necessity of the
conclusion is as strong against the Archbishop and all one. For by the same
reason that the Pope is cast away as a superfluous thing, for that these
offices are able to make perfect the Church, is the Archbishop likewise
thrown out of the Church, as a knobbe or some lump of flesh, which being no
member of the body does both burden it and disfigure it. And as they say that
God gave no Pope to his Church, therefore the Pope can do no good: so we may
well say God gave no Archbishop to his Church, therefore the Archbishop can do
no good.

Io. Whitgifte.
If there were no stronger places than this against the Pope of Rome his
usurped authority, it might stand still, for any thing that I know: because
this place speaks only of the offices occupied in preaching the word and
administrating the sacraments, as I have said, not of any office of government.
Neither is it a perfect pattern because it has omitted those offices before
mentioned. I have told you before that a negative argument from the scripture
(except it be in matters of salvation) is but weak. Likewise that an
Archbishop is no new ministry, but may well be contained in the number of
those, of whom the Apostle there speaks. For the name of a Pastor does
comprehend both Archbishops and Bishops. The name does but signify an office
of government convenient for the state of the Church in the external policy of
it. And if it did prevail against the Pope, yet does it not so against the

Archbishop. For the Pope does challenge his authority by succession from
Peter, so does not the Archbishop. The Pope says that he is the head of the
universal Church of Christ, so does not the Archbishop. The Pope says that
to be subject to him is necessary to salvation, the Archbishop thinks no
such matter. The Pope chalengeth power to remitte and retain sins, to
dispense with the word of God, to make new articles of faith. etc. so does
not the Archbishop. To be short the Pope claymeth authority over kings and
princes, and says that they have authority from him: but the Archbyshops (if
you speak of ours) acknowledge themselves to be subjects to their Prince, and
to have that authority and jurisdiction from her, which they practice over and
above that that other bishops do, and therefore* on must needs be reproved
here, either of great lack of discretion, or else of gresse ignorance, or
purposed malice. You might say that God gave no magistrate in that place to
his Church, Ergo, the magistrate can do no good. Surely I think that if you
should well consider how near your arguments approach to the Anabaptists, you
would either more circumspectly use them, or else quite cast them away.

Neither did God give any Archdeacon to his Church therefore he cannot profit
ye Church. But it will be said that this argument follows not, because no
mention is made here of the deacon or of the elder, which notwithstanding are
both necessary in the Church, and therefore that there are functions
profitable in the Church whereof no mention is made here. But how It is easily
known and as easily (...) of you, as appears af^wards.
easily do all men know that the Apostle speaks of those functions here only,
which are conversant in the word, and have to do with the preaching thereof:
and therefore made hereno mention of the Deacon or elder. It is said again
that in the epistle to the Corinthians, S. Paul speaks only 1. Cor. 12.
of Apostles, Prophets and Doctors, leaving out Evangelists and Pastors and yet
Evangelists and Pastors necessary: and so although Archbyshops are not spoken
o^ in the place to the Ephesians, yet they may not be therefore shut out as
unnecessary. But they that say so, should have considered that the diversity
of the matter which the Apostle handles in these two places, bred a diverse
kind of speech. For in the epistle to the Corinthians, going about to condemn
the ambition of men, which will thrust themselves into other men's callings,
and take upon them to do all themselves, and to be as it were eye, and ear,
and hand and all: S. Paul proves that the Church is a body wherein there are
many members, and the same diverse one from another, and that it is not one
member only. And to prove that, it was sufficient to say that he placed some
Apostles, some Prophets, some Doctors, without rehearsing al ye kinds of
functions. But in the Epistle to the Ephesians, meaning to show the liberality
of our savior Christ in giving those which should be able by doctrine and
teaching to make perfect and absolute his Church, it was necessary that he
should reckon up all those functions whereby that work is done.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have in this place your self answered your former reasons touching the T.
C. has answered him self touching the place Ephe. 4.
place to the Ephesians. For I have told you that the names of Archbyshops and
Archdeacon be names of jurisdiction and gouernmente, not of any new ministry
and therefore such bishops and ministers, as be so called to have those names,
not in the respect of the ministry of the word, but of order and policy.

The objection made of the place of the. 1. to the Corinth. Cap. 12. is of more
weight than you can be able to remove with all the might you have. For the
Apostle there as well declares the diversity of offices in the Church, as he
does in that Epistle to the Ephesians: yea and more perfectly to, as the place
it self and the very order that the Apostle keeps does declare. your
distinction is but in vain invented for a shift only, against both reason and
authority: against reason because the Apostle having before made a perfect
division of gifts in the Church, it is not like but now speaking of offices he
does the same. Moreover he does rehearse them in order saying, first Apostles,
then Prophets, thirdly Doctors. etc. Lastly he recites here more offices tha^
he does there, for here he recites eight and there only five at the most.
Authority both of learned writers, and of the manifest words of the Apostle
himself is against it. Peter Martyr says that in this place Recenset
singulatim quas parteis habeat boc corpus he P. Martyr (...) 12. 1. Cor
rehearses particularly what parts this body has, meaning the Church. And the
Apostle himself recyting the diverse parts of the body and functions of the
same to declare the diverse functions that be in the Church, does no doubt make
as perfect a division here as he does in any other place, so that this shift
cannot serve your turn, and if it did, yet have you proved nothing by it, for
you your self have given the salution saying That in the place to the
Ephesians he only speaks of such functions as are conversant in the word,
which is true.

But how comes it to pass that S. Paul neither in the one place, neither in
the other nor else where makes mention of the Archbishop, which is said to be
the chefest pillar and vndersetter of the Church? Now I hear what is said to
this, that under the Pastor is contained bishop, he is not contained but is the
same that bishop. How then? Forsooth say they an Archbishop is bishop? well

are hanged in the bush, but I will help them, of by shops some are
Archbyshops, some are by the common name bishops. For if they answer not thus,
what have they to say? But what an absurd thing were that to say that S. Paul
comprehended an Archbishop under a Pastor or bishop, which neither was at that
time nor certain hundred years after? this were not to deinde but to
prophecy. And how is it that they never marked that S. Paul speaks of those
functions which were in the Church, and not of those which should be
afterward? and of those that God had given, and not of those which he would
give* For the words are and he has given.

Io. Whitgifte.
No man can deny, but a bishop may aptly be comprehended under this name
Pastor, and Archbishop under the name of a Bishop: and it may as well be said
that of bishops some be called Archbyshops, and some by the name of bishops, as
it may be said of kings some be called Emperors, some by the common name of
kings: of Dukes, some Archdukes some by the common name of Dukes: of Justices,
some chief Justices, some by the common name of Justices.

What if the name of an Archbishop were not in S. Paul's time? Does it
therefore Things may be lawful which were not in Paul's time.
follow that the thing signified by the name was not in his time? This word
(...) was not in S. Paul's time, but afterward invented in the council of Nice.
Yet was the thing thereby signified in S. Paul's time, and from the beginning.
Other names there be also which were invented since the Apostles time, and yet
both lawfully and necessarily used. The authority and thing whereof the
Archbishop has his name, was in Paul's time and therefore the name lawful:
and if it had not bin in S. Paul's time, yet were both the name and the office
lawful because it perteyneth to the external policy and regiment of the
Church, which is variable according to the place, time, person, and other
circumstances. Shall not the authority that Christian Princes have in matters
ecclesiastical be thought lawful, because there were no such Princes in S.
Paul's time? Dr shall not they have the chief authority in ruling and
governing the Church in exteruall policy and regiment because there is no
such express mention of them in those two places of S. Paul?

But you shall answer yourselfe, for you say that in those places S. Paul
speaks of such functions as were then in the church, not of such as should be
afterward, which is true. And therefore I conclude that as all those offices
(by your own confession before) are not necessary for all times in the Church:
so are they not only, for all times of the Church, but other may be brought in
meet for the government of the same. I know your meaning is nothing less, yet
this is my collection which I think you will very hardly answer.

How many hundred years the name of Archbishop was after the Apostles time,

Your argument if it be thus framed, Pastors are necessary at all times in all
estates of the Church, and in all places, and cannot be put down at the will
of the Church: Archbyshops are Pastors, therefore they be necessary at all
times. (...). I deny your argument, because the mayor in the first figure
cannot be particular. If you make your mayor universal, then I do deny it,
and put you to the proof. If you say that to preach the word and to administer
the sacraments (which is, the office of a Pastor) is necessary at all times:
then I confess it to be true, and distinguish the minor on this sort: that an
Archbishop in respect of the ministry of the word and sacraments, is at all
times necessary, not in the respect of policy and government, in consideration

nothing to do with discipline and order? with what face can you take away the
raines of government out of the Apostles hands, and put them in the Archby
shops and Archdeacons hands? what a perverseness is this that the ministeries
invented by men should be preferred to all the ministeries appointed and
commanded of God.

The Apostles for sooth have in common with the Archbyshops and Archdeacons the
power of ministering of the word and of the Sacraments, of binding and losing,
and thus far as good as the Archbyshops and Archdeacons. But for discipline
and order the Apostles have nothing to do, but herein Archbyshops and
Archdeacons are above them and better than they.

Io. Whitgifte.
You wonderfully forget your self, for it is your own distinction as it
appears Page. 64. li. 5.
in the. 5. line of the same page of your book: and thereby you shifted off
the objection of Deacons and Elders. I know no man that takes the raines of
gouernmente out of the Apostles hands and gives it to any to whom it is not
due by the word of God. But is your meaning that the Apostles should now
execute it themselves? else Quorsum bae^ Surely you are so full of passions
that you forget the matter. I know the Apostles had in their time together
with the ministry of the word and sacraments, power to exercise
ecclesiastical discipline and order: But truly I understand not your meaning,
for never any such thing as you here fancy entered once into my cogitation. I
rather say that because in the Apostles there was joined the administration of
discipline with the ministry of the word and sacraments, therefore it may be
so likewise now in Archbyshops and Bishops. For that authority of discipline
and government that the Apostles had in their time, is now for the most part
executed by Archbyshops and Bishops, which is the overthrow of your whole
assertion.

But to come to this distinction, I had thought before this time, that the

chief builders in setting up the Church, now I perceive you make the
archbyshops and Archdeacons the chief builders, and the Apostles under
carpenters or common masons, to serve and to 1. Cor. 3*
take the commandment of the Archbishop and Archdeacon. And whereas it is
said that the ministeries which S. Paul speaks of are in the words and
sacraments, binding and losing only, and that there be other which are besides
these (occupied in the order and discipline of the Church) (of which number are
Archbyshops and Archdeacons) let us mark a little what deep divinity here is.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely you wander you know not whether, without doubt your mind, when you
writ this, was upon some other thing than upon my book. For where have I made
this comparison betwixt the Apostles and Archbyshops? or what have I spoken
sounding that way? I would have you to deal honestly and plainly. If you mean
the book in latin, whereof you after ward speak, the words of that book
sounding any thing this way be these. Archiepisiopi ab episcopis quoad
ministerium non differunt (omnes enim paripotestate docendi, baptizandi,
ligandi and soluendi praediti sunt:) sed quoad ordinem et politiam: ordinis
enim and politiae causa quaedam vltra episcopos Archiepiscopis cencessa sunt.
Archbyshops differ not from bishops in respect of the ministry (for they are
all endued with equal authority to teach, to baptize, to bind and lose) but
in respect of order and policy. For some things are granted to Archbyshops
for order and policies sake above the bishops. And further answering that place
to the Ephesians it says: Apostolus eo in loco eos tantion ministr^s and
ministeria enumerat quae in precibus, verbo, and administratione sacramentorum
versantur, non eorum quae ad ordinem and disciplinam instituuntur, qualia sunt
Archiepiscoporum and Archidiaconorum The Apostle in that place does only recite
those ministers and ministeries, which are occupied in prayer, the word and the
administration of the Sacraments, not of them which are instituted for order
and discipline, such as are the functions of Archbyshops and Archdeacons. The
which selfsame distinction for that place you use Page 64. lin. 5.
in the beginning of the 64. Page of your book, these only words excepted (
qualia sunt Archiepiscoporum and Archidiaconorum) as I have before showed and
your own words declare. And I am sure these words do not make the Archbyshops
and Archdeacons chief builders and the Apostles under carpenters as it
pleases you to collect, but this is your modesty.

When you have told where they have laid on this greater burden and weight, or
what the burden and weight is that you say they have laid on, or who they be
that have laid it on, then shall your question be answered, in the mean time
let this suffice the reader, that you do but forge matter to increase your
volumes, and to sport your self.

Secondarily I ask with what boldness and upon the confidence of what
gifts, any man dare take upon him both that which the Apostles did, and more
to?

Io. Whitgifte.
To this I answer as to the former.

Chap. 1. the. 25. Division.
T. C. Page 65. Sect. 3.
Then I say that it is too too unskillfully done, to separate order and
discipline from then that have the ministry of the word in hand, as though
the Church without Archbishops and Archdeacons* were aco^fused heap and a
disordered lump, when as S. Paul teaches it to be without them, a body
consisting of all his parts and members, comely knitte and joined together,
wherein nothing wants, nor nothing is to much.

Io. Whitgifte.
Order and discipline are not separated from the ministry of the word,
although all such Authority to execute discipline, is not equally given to all.
as be ministers of the word have not the like authority to execute them.
For as it is said in that Latin book, for order and policies sake more is
granted to the Archbishop than to the Bishop, neither will any learned man so
greatly maruayle at this, seeing the practice thereof was in the Apostles time.
For Paul had more large and ample authority than Timothy, and Timothy than
the resse of the ministers of Ephesus.

What if the Church without Archbishops and Archdeacons were perfect in S.
Paul's time, and may be perfect at other times, does it therefore follow that
the Church in no time or stare may have them, or rather that they be not
necessary at some time for the Church? In S. Paul's time Apostles, Prophets,
workers of miracles, gifts of healing, diversity of tongs were counted
necessary, and principal parts of this body, which not with standing you
confess now to be cut of, and yet the body perfect: So that you see this is
no reason at all, to say that the Church in S. Paul's time was a perfect body
without Archbyshops and Archdeacons: Ergo, they are not necessary in the Church
of Christ. For I might as well reason thus: The Church of Christ in S. Paul's
time was not perfect without Apostles, Prophets, doers of miracles, gifts of
healing, diversity of tongs, therefore it is not now perfect being without
them. And likewise it was then perfect without Christian magistrates, The
unskillful reasoning of T. C. opens a bore to Anabaptisme.
Ergo, Christian magistrates are to be removed from the Church. This kind of
reasoning, as it is unskillful, because it does not distinguish the times of
the Church, neither considers necessary circumstances, so it is most
perilous and opens a door to Anabaptisme and confusion.

Moreover I told you before, that although this name Archbishop is not
expressed The office of the Archbishop expressed in scripture.
in the Scripture yet is the office and function, as it is evidently to be
seen in the examples of Timothy, and Titus, yea and in the Apostles
themselves, whose office of planting Churches thorough the whole world is
ceased, but their care for the good government of those Churches which were
planted, and their authority over those Pastors whom they placed, does and
must remain in such places where there are Churches. And therefore M. Bucer
writing upon the fourth to the Ephesians says Bucer in ^. Ephesians.
thus: Miletum Presbiteros Ecclesiae Ephesinae conuocat: tamen quia vnus inter
eos praeerat alijs and primam Ecclesiaecuram habebat, in eo proprie residebat
nomen Episcopi. In the Acts Paul calls the same men Bishops and Elders,
when as he called together the ministers of the Church of Ephesus unto Miletum:
yet because one amongst them did rule over the rest and had the chief care of
the Church, the name of Bishop did properly remain in him So that this
superiority and jurisdiction which we speak of, was even in the Apostles
time, as it is more at large afterward proved.

Chap. 1. the. 26. Division.
T. C. Page 65. Sect. 3.
Does it not pertayne to order that the Apostle says that God has set first
Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers? are not these words, First,
Second, Third, differences of order? if this be not order, surely I know not
what order is. And yet neither Archbishop nor Archdeacon author of this, and it
was kept also before they were hatched.

Io. Whitgifte.
Yes, but will you have the same order now? then must you have Apostles, and
Prophets, which you deny, so that this order you see is not perpetual,
wherefore from time to time that order among the ministers of the word must
be observed, That order multe be observed which is convenient for the state.
that is most convenient for the state of the Church. Neither is any against
such order, but those that will not live in order. Did ever any man deny but
that there was order in the Apostles time? All this is but to make the reader
believe that some such thing is in that Latin book, when there is not one
word whereof any such thing can be gathered: is this your simplicity?

Chap. 1. the. 27. Division.
T. C. Page 65. Sect. 4.
Let us see of discipline and government, which we may see to be committed to
those which have the preaching of the word and to others also which did not
preach the word, when S. Paul 1. Tim. 5.
says, that the elders which govern well are worthy double honor especially
those which travel in the word: where he appoynteth the government to the
ministers of the word, and to those also that were not ministers of the word.
And thereupon it follows that the ministers of the Church are not severed one
from an other, as you, because some have the ministration of the word and
Sacraments only, and some with the administration of the Sacraments and word,
have also the government and discipline in their hands: but clean
contrariwise S. Paul distinguishes them, and shows that all the ministers
in the Church have the government, but all have not the word to handle, so
that he distinguishes the ministry into that which is occupied in the word
and government, and into that which is occupied in the government only. But in
this distinction you do not only forget S. Paul, but you forget your self.
For if S. Paul speak in that place of those that meddle with the ministering
of the word and sacraments You falsify my words, by displacing the word
(only).
only: why does the bishop which is one of the ministers that S. Paul speaks
of (being the same that pastor is) why I say does he meddle with the discipline
and order of the Church, seeing that belongs not to him by your distinction?
why does also the Archbishop (whom you say is a bishop), meddle with it? And
thus you see you need no other adversary than your self to confute you.

Io. Whitgifte.
The reader should better have understood what you had gone about, if you had
set before his eyes the words that you confute. Now I scarce understand your
meaning my self. You shote altogether without a mark. I know no man that
denies discipline and government to be committed to those that have the
preaching of the word, and to others also which preach not the word. But if
you mean that either all kind of ecclesiastical discipline and government,
is committed to all such as preach the word, or in as ample manner to one as
to another, you have not yet proved it, neither will you be hable to prove it
with all the learning that you think your self to have.

That in 1. Tim. 5. does prove no such matter, as you pretend. For what does
What it is to rule well.
S. Paul mean there, by governing well? Christ^ and Ecclesiae suae tum
doctrina tum integritate vitae fideliter inseruire, non suased quae Dei sunt
quaerere: to serve Christ and his Church faithfully both in doctrine and
integrity of life, to seek not those things which are his, but those which
are Gods. Thus do the learned interpreters expound, been praeesse, in this
place. Is not the office of teaching, exhorting, reproving, an office of ruling
and governing? But you say that the Apostle does make two kind of governors,
one that trauayleth in the word, the other that does not. And what then? he
that diligently does that office that is committed unto him, whether it be in
preaching the word, providing for the poor, visiting the sick, or any such
like function, does rule well. But does it therefore follow that all have like
authority, or that there is no kind of Ecclesiastical government or
discipline, but that which is common to all the ministers of the word?
Certain it is, that every Pastor that does his duty in All ministers govern
but not alike.
preaching rules well, and so do they also that duly and truly administer the
Sacraments, relieve the poor, visit the sick, privately admonish, etc. But
is there therefore none that has superiority over them, to procure that those
things be done accordingly, to correct them if they be not done, to see that
every man be kept in order, be obedient to laws, teach true doctrine, break
not unity. etc? This place therefore helps you not. For although all
ministers of the word rule and govern after a sort, yet do not they al so,
in all kind of government, nor equally, for they also must have governors.

But consider your reason or at the least the end of your drifte. All ministers
of the Whereunto (...) dust of the (...).
word govern their parishes by preaching the word, rebuking sin. etc.
Ergo, they must have none to govern them, and keep them in order, and see
that they do their duty: it is all one with this. Every Master of a family
rules over his family* and therefore he must have no superior to rule over
him: or every chief officer of Cities or Towns be rulers and governors of
those places, therefore they must have none to rule and govern either their
cities and towns, or themselves. In deed this is a plausible doctrine to make
every Pastor chief governor within his own parish, and to make every city
and town a kingdom within it self: but it is a pestilent doctrine, for in
short time there would be as many Popes as Pastors, as many religions as
parishes, as many sects as families, and in the end an overthrow both of
religion, the Church, and the kingdom. Neither could there possibly have
been invented a more readier way for the Pope to make his entry in hither
again.

Of your distinction of Presbyter, I will speak in a more fit place.

I have not forgot my self, but you neither understand (as it appears) my
writings, neither yet your own, for hither to you have fought without an
adversary.

And yet I must put you in mind of your falsehoode and subtle dealing: for
whereas I say that the Apostle in the. 4. Ephe. speaks only of those
ministers and ministeries, which are occupied in prayers, the word and
administration of the sacraments. you by displacing the word, only, make your
Reader believe, that I affirm the Apostle to speak in that place, of those
that meddle with the ministering of the word and Sacraments only, as if I
should seclude the ministers of the word from all kind of government.

And least any man should say I confute my own shadow, I must let him to
understand that there is a Pamphlet in Latin, which is called the The book ^
named but (...) you have consuted your shadow, and not the book as has appeared
book of the Doctors, which goes from hand to hand and especially (so far as
they could bring to pass) to those only that they thought to favor that
opinion, in the which book, all these answers unto the place of the Ephesians
are contained, and almost all that which is comprehended in this defense of
Archbyshops and Archdeacons, with other things also which are found in this
book of M. Doctors: and therefore it is very likely that he having no other
way to vent his rapsodies, and rackings together, thought he would bring them
to light after this sort. But how much better had it been that this misshapen
thing had had the mothers womb for the grave, or being brought out had been
hidden as the former is, in some benchhole or dark place, where it should
never have seen any light, nor no man's eye should ever have looked of it?

Io. Whitgifte.
It had been much for your credit if you had set down the words of that
book the which you and your fautors in derision call the book of Doctors.
Which you have only named and not confuted. The book dare abide the light, and
the Author also, but so dare not you. To the rest of your words my answer is
only this, that you bewray your spirit: for further proof hereof I refer
the reader to the third Chapter of S. James, from the tenth verse to the end.

Chap. 1. the. 30. Division.
T. C. Page 65. Sect. 5. and Page 66. Sect. 1.
Now I will reason also after this sort out of the place of the Ephesians and
Corinthians joined together. There is no function but has gifts fit and apt
to discharge it, annexed and given unto it: whereupon the Apostle by a
Metonomie, does call the Apostles, Prophets, etc. gifts, because they have
always gifts joined with them. This being granted (as no man can deny it) I
reason thus.

Syllogism without all form.
Those functions only are sufficent for the church, which have all the gifts
needful, either for the ministering of the word and sacraments, or for the
government of the church: but all these functions reckened of S. Paul to the
Ephesians, with those which S. Paul calls (...) and (...) (which are the
Deacons and elders) have the gifts needful either for the government of the
church, either else for the ministering of the word and sacraments: therefore
these functions only are sufficient for the church. For it is a superfluous
thing to make more offices than there be gifts to furnish them, for so they that
should have them, should rather be Idols than officers. And therefore for
as much as there is no gift which falls not into some of these ^nnctions, it
is altogether a vain and vnprositable thing to bring more offices and
functions into the Church besides these.

Io. Whitgifte.
You say there is no function, but has gifts apt and fit to discharge it,
annexed and given In what sense every function is said to have gifts to
discharge it.
unto it. If you mean that there is no function but there is gifts meet for
it, which God has in his power to bestow, it is most true: But if your
meaning be, that the gifts be so annexed to the function, that of necessity
whosoever is called to that function must also have those gifts, it is most
untrue. For experience does teach that every man has not gifts according to
his function, although he be lawfully there unto called, touching his
external calling: for the in ward calling none knows but God himself, and
a man's own conscience. But you put me in remembrance of that which master
Bullinger writes of the Anabaptists lib. 5. cap. 1. where he (confuting the
reason they use to prove that Christians ought not to have magistrates, because
Christians be so perfect of themselves that they can govern themselves, and
therefore need not to be subject to any other superior authority says thus:
Solent autem Anabaptistae libenter ea imaginari and animo suo fingere quae
nunquam Bullinger. lib. 5. aduersus anab. cap. 1.
fueru^t, neque extant, aut posthaec futura sunt. The Anabaptists willingly
use to imagine and conceive those things in their minds which never has
been, nor are, nor hereafter shall be. Even so I say unto you, that in
imagining the gifts perteyning to every function so to be (...) unto the
function, that he which has the one must of necessity have the other, you
fancy that which never was, is, or shall be: and in so reasoning what do you
else, than use that argument against superiority in the Ecclesiastical
estate, which the Anabaptists use both against Ecclesiastical and Civil
magistrates? But I answer you as M. Bullinger answered them: Except you were
blinded with pertinacie you might easily see in your self just cause why
there should be magistrates Idem.
and Superiors.

Moreover God does not tie his gifts to any certain and definite number of
names or titles of offices, but bestows them as it pleases him, to the
commodity of his Church, upon such as be meet to use them, by what name or
title soever they be called. Wherefore this assertion of yours is either
unadvisedly avouched, or else does it conteyne some secret poison not yet
uttered.

This being said, to the ground that you have laid, thus I answer to your
argument: The deformed argument of T. C.
it is in no mode, and in deed to bad for any boy to use in his Sophismes. It
is in form the same with this: Those things only are sufficient for salvation
which are contained in the Scriptures, but al those things in the Aue Maria are
contained in the Scriptures, therefore those things only which are in the Aue
Maria are sufficient to salvation. Or this, those only are men which are
endued with reason, but all the Cosrardmongers in London are endued with
reason, therefore the Costardmongers of London only are men. Besides this, the
Mayor is particular, which (...) against all form of Syllogism in the first
or second figure: to be short, in your Mayor you have this word (only) in
your Medium and in the Minor is left out. And therefore your conclusion
follows not, except you had said in your Minor, that only these functions
reckened of S. Paul to the Ephesians etc. have all gifts needful for the
ministering of the word and sacraments and for the government of the Church:
And yet if it were so, your argument should be of no force, being ex solis
particularibus. So that in your Syllogism there is no manner of form, and
therefore not worthy of any other answer, until it be better framed.
Although I could say unto you that all those functions have gifts necessary
for them: but not only those functions: because there be other not mentioned of
you which have gifts necessary also, and which the Apostle rehearses. 1. Corinthians. 12. So likewise could I answer that most of those functions
(according to your own opinion) be not perpetual but for a time, and therefore
your reason is no good reason. Likewise that the Apostle has not made in
either of these places any perfect division of offices which were even at that
time in the Church. For in the first to the Corinthians the. 12. chap. he
leaves out Evangelists, Pastors, Bishops, Deacons, widows: and in the
fourth to the Ephesians: Deacons, widows, workers of miracles, etc. So that
he has not left any perpetual pattern of offices, or names in either of
those two places. To conclude I could tell you that God has left to his
Church authority to appoint both names and offices, as shall be for the same
most convenient and profitable, the which authority the Church has also from
the beginning used, as in appoynting Catechistes, Lectors, and such like, not
superfluons but most necessary offices, and profitable for the Church, in
those times wherein they were.

Chap. 1. the. 31. Division.

And so it may be thus reasoned. If men may make and crect new ministeries,
they must either give gifts for to dischardge them, or assure men that they
shall have gifts of God, whereby they may be able to answer them. But they
can neither give gifts, nor assure men of any gifts necessary to discharge
those functions, therefore they may make or erect no new ministeries.

Io. Whitgifte.
First there is no new ministry erected. But among the ministers some are
appointed to govern the rest, and to have the chief direction of them, and
such are chosen to that superiority, upon whom God (as far as man can judge)
has bestowed gifts meet for the same. Secondly, it is not necessary that
those that appoint any office, should be able to give gifts incident there
unto. For then no man might appoint any office. It is therefore sufficient if
he appoint such Persons as God has endued with gifts meet for such an
office, and such offices as there may be persons meet to execute: which being
observed, your argument is soon answered.

Chap. 1. the. 32. Division.
T. C. Page 66. Sect. 3.
Last of all to conclude against these made and divised ministeries of
Archbyshops and Archbeacons after this sort, The (...).
if men may add ministeries, they may also take away: for those both belong to
one authority: The (...).
but they can not take away those ministeries that God has placed in his
Church, therefore they cannot add to those that are placed in the Church.
And this foundation I thought first to lay or ever I entered into M. Doctors
not reasons, but authorities, not of God but of men, in confuting of which
there will fall forth also other arguments, against both these offices of
Archbishop and Archdeacon.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your whole book is for the most part builded upon that false founded
argument, The Reply grounded upon the petition of the principle.
that is called Petitio principij. For this will not be granted unto you,
which you have so oftentimes repeated, and whereupon all your arguments are
grounded, that to appoint Archbyshops or Archdeacons, is to appoint a new
ministry. It is (as I told you before) but to keep an order in the ministry
and in the Church, and to execute that office of government which the Apostles
themselves did. When Hierome said, That for the avoiding of Schisms the
ministers appointed one among themselves to govern the rest. Did he mean that
they instituted a new ministry? A man may see by this, how unable you are to
defend your cause, seeing you are enforced to frame principles unto your self,
against the which you may reason, that the ignorant reader may think your
quarrel to be just. But now to your argument. The Mayor is not true, for men
may add ministeries to those that be, and break not the will and
commandment of God, because they may be helps and furtheraunces to those
ministeries that God has appointed: But he can not take away such ministeries
as God has placed in his Church, to be perpetual, without breach of his
will and commandment. Moreover, besides those ministeries that God has
appointed in his word as necessary at all times, there may be some added that
be convenient for some times, and yet the Church that has authority to add
these, has not the like authority to take away the other: So that your Mayor
lacks proof. Your Minor also is ambiguous: for man can not take away those
ministeries that God has appointed to be perpetual in the Church, but he may
take away those that be but temporal, as occasion serves.

If your foundation be no sounder than this that you have hitherto laid,
surely your buylding cannot long stand, and M. Doctors authorities may well
enough encounter with all your reasons.

That the names of Metropolitan, Archbishop, etc. be not Antichristian.

First therefore I prove that the names of Metropolitan and The antiquity of
Archbishops.
Archbishop etc. be not Antichristian names, that is, names invented by
Antichrist, but most au^cie^t: yea that they were in the Church, long before
the Gospel was publicly embraced by any Prince or in any kingdom. Polidore
Virgil lib. 4. De inuentoribus rerum, Cap. 12. says that Clement in his book
entitled Compe^diarium Christianae religionis, testifies, that the Apostle
Peter did in every Province appoint one Archbishop, whom all other Bishops of
the same province should obey. He says also that the same Archbishop was
called Primas, Patriarcha, and Metropolitanus. Peter was not Antichrist, Ergo,
the name of an Archbishop is no Antichristian name.

Now I will come to the examining of your witnesses, whereof some of them are
so bored in the ears and branded in their foreheades, that no man need to
fear any credit they shall get before any judge wheresoever, or before whom
soever they come, but in the Romish court, and the Papists only excepted.
For to let go Polidore Uirgile because whatsoever he says he says of the
credit of another, let us come to Clement which is the author of this you
speak. And what is he? Is there any so blind that knows not that this was
nothing less than Clement, of whom S. Paul speaks, and which some think
was the first Bishop of Rome ordained by Peter, and Phil. 4. Tertul. de
praescript. aduers. haeret.
not rather a wicked helhounde into whom the Lord had sent Satan to be a
lying spirit in his mouth, to deceive them for their unthankful receiving of
the gospel? And he must witness for the Archbishop: a worthy witness. For
as all that Popish Hierarchy came out of the bottomless pit of hell: so to
uphold the Archbishop the neck of it, whereupon the Romish monster stands,
are raised up from hell bastards, Clemens and Anacletus, and indeed as it may
appear, the very natural sons of Satan, and the sworn soldiers of
Antichrist.

A man would have thought that the Bishop of Salisburie, M. Iuel had so pulled
of the painting of the face of this Clement, that all good men would have had
him in detestation: so far of would they have been to have alleged out of
him to prove any thing that is in controversy.

The Bishop alleges both Eusebius, and S. Hierome, to prove that none of

Bishop uses being the witness of unsuspected witnesses: yet because the law,
although it allow two witnesses, notwithstanding does like the better of three,
I will set down here also Ireneus which was a great while before them both,
and followed hard after the time of the true and vncounterfeyte Clement, Li. 3.
cap. 3.
and therefore could best tell of him, and of his wrytings, and yet he makes
mention but of one Epistle, which upon occasion amongst the Corinthians he
wrote to them. Indeed in an other place of that book he shows, that it is
very probable, that Clementalso either wrote or turned the Epistle to the
Hebrews. Now if that Epistle to the Counthes were extant, we should easily
see by comparing those that are now in his name with that, what a misshapen
thing this is.

And if so be that Ireneus conjecture be good, that Clement was the author or
interpreter of the Epstle to the Hebrews, then what horrible injury is done to
the holy Ghost, while the same is supposed the writer of this book to the
Hebrews, which is the author of such beggerie as this Clement brought into
the world? And I pray you do you hold that it is the true Christian religion
which that book conteyneth? Could none of these considerations drive you from
the testimony of this Clement? It goes very hard with the Archbishop, when
these Clements, and Anacletusses must be brought to underprop him.

But what if there be no such book as this is, which you name, (when you say
in his book entitled Compendiarium religionis Christianae) it is like you
know not him, nor what he says, when you cannot tell so much as his name.
Only because Polidore writes that Clement says this in a certain short and
summarie book of christian religion, you have set down that he writes thus
in a book entitled Compendiarium Christianae religionis, where there is no
such title neither in the Councels where his Epistles are, neither yet in all
other his works.

Thought you to disguise him with this new name of the book, that he should
not be known? or meant you to occupy your answerer in seeking of a book which
because he should never find, he should never answer? The place which
Polidore means is in the first Epistle which he writes unto James the
brother of the Lord, which is as the rest are both ridiculous in the manner of
writing, and in the matter oftener times wicked and blasphemous, which I speak
to this end, that the reader through the commendation that M. Doctor has
given to this Clement, in taking him as one of his witnesses in so great a
matter be not abused.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here is much more labor spent than is necessary. No man denies but that the
Epistles attributed to Clement are Counterfeyte, neither do I otherwise allege
him or Anacletus, or any such like, than both M. Calvin, M. Jewel, and many
other learned men do, as it is evident in their writings. That testimony
which I use is out of Polidore, and therefore have I quoted both the book and
Chapter. Polidore writes as other do that entreat of such matters, and for
as much as he was learned, and of purpose gave himself to the searching out
of such things, his report is not lightly to be rejected. But (God be thanked)
neither the name nor the anthoritie of an Arfhbishop depends upon these
witnesses, neither do I use them as sure grounds, but as probable testimonies
of the antiquity of the name. You have cited the Canons of the Apostles thrice
at the least in this your book, and Higinus likewise, and used them as
proofs, and yet is there as great suspicion in the counterfeyting of them, as
there is of this book of Clements. I pray you therefore give me that liberty
in recyting Authors, that you take to your self, and that no man refuses
when they serve to his purpose. For I protest unto you, that I have as evil an
opinion of many of them, and think as great corruption to be in them as any man
does, and that not only because I have so red in other men's writings of them:
but also for that I my self in reading of the^ have noted the same. But I am
well assured that Polidore meant that Clement which is supposed to be the first
Bishop of Rome, how he was therein deceived (being so learned a man) I leave
it to others to judge.

It is not like that Polydore meant that Epistle, for he knew what difference
there was betwixt an Epistle and a book: neither does the length or the matter
of that Epistle give any occasion that it should so be called: wherefore it
is like that Polydore had it out of some book attributed unto Clement under
that title, though the same be not extant. For there be diverse works of
ancient fathers, which be not now ertant in print, and yet in some places to
be had. But I will not stand longer in this matter. The words of Polydore be
these. Sicut D. Clemens in suo Christianae religionis compendiario libello
perhibet, etc.

For answer unto him, although he be not worth the answering, I say first it
may be well said here of the office of the Archbishop, that the father of it
was an Amorite, and mother an Hittite, that is that it comes of very
infamous parentage, the beginning thereof being of the Idolatrous nations.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words of pleasure: it will appear in this discourse that the
parents and authors both of the office, and of the name, be such as ought with
greater reverence to be spoken of, and with greater signification of duty.

And whereas Clement makes S. Peter the Apostle to make it as it were his
adopted son, thereby to wipe away the shame of his birth, it does S. Peter
shameful injury. For besides that it was far from S. Peter to take this
authority to himself, not only of making Archbishops thorowout every Province
but also instituting a new order or of fice, without the counsel of the rest
of the Apostles, which none else of the Apostles did, and which is contrary to
the practice of S. Peter, both in the first and sixth of the Acts, contrary
also to the practice of the Apostles which after shall appear. I say besides
this, is it like that S. Peter would graffe the noblest plant as it is said of
the ministry of the Gospel, in such a rotten stock of that which was most
abominable in all Idolatry? For the greater they were in the service of the
Idolles, the more detestable were they before God.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do not take upon me the defense of Clements words in that Epistle, or of
Polydore in the book and Chapter before recyted, in all things that they spoke
touching the matter. But I cannot suffer your vain reasons to serve for an
answer. For if Saint Peter did thus place Archbishoppes, yet did he not
appoint any new order or office, as you have been oftentimes told. Of all
Bishops there is one order or One ministry of bishops, but diverse degrees.
ministry, but diverse degrees. Between an Archbishop and a Bishop there is
only a difference of degree and dignity, not of order or ministry: as
diverse learned men give unto Peter, above the rest of the Apostles the
pre-eminence of honor for orders sake, but not of power. Moreover Peter in
appoynting them without the consent of the other Apostles, did no otherwise
than the Apostle S. Paul when he placed Timothy at Ephesus, and Titus at
Creta. It may be also that in some places where there were before Archiflamines
he placed such as were called Archbishops, etc. which might be done in respect
of ye city and place, and not in respect of the idolatrous priests. For
Archiflamines were but in great Cities, which being converted unto Christ,
might have in the place of their Archiflamines, Godly and learned Archbishops,
to ouersee and direct the rest of the Bishops and Preachers, that unity and
order might be observed. Thus Paul did at Ephesus and Creta. And why might not
Peter do it in other places likewise?

Chap. 4. the fourth Division.
T. C. Page 67. Sect. 5. 6. 7. 8.
The Lord when he would give laws of woorshipping to his people, in the
things that were indifferent, of shauing and cutting, and apparel wearing,
says to his people, that they should not do so, and so, because the Gentiles
did so, yea even in those things, the use whereof was otherwise very
profitable, and incommodious to forbear, he would have them notwithstanding
to absteyne from, as from swines flesh, Conies. etc. to the end that he might
have them severed as appears by S. Paul, by a great and high wall from other
Nations. Ephesians. 2.


And therefore it is very unlike that S. Peter would frame the ministry of
the Gospel (which is no ceremony but of the substance of the gospel.) by the
example of the heathenish and ydolatrous functions.

If one had said that the Lord had shapen this common wealth by the pattern
of other common wealths, although it had been most untrue (all other
flourishing common wealths of Athens, Lacedemon, and Rome, borowing their good
laws of the Lords common wealth) yet had it been more tolerable: but to say
he framed the ministry of the Gospel by the Priesthood of Idolatry, is to
fet chastity out of Sodom, and to seek for heaven in hell.

And if so be that the Lord had delighted in this Hierarchy, he would rather
have taken of his own, than borrowed of others: of his own Church, than of the
Synagog of Satan. For under the law besides the Levites there were Priests and
above them a high Priest.

Io. Whitgifte.
God gave unto the Israelites a king, though other Nations had so in like
manner. The Israelites had some things like to the Gentiles.
And he ordained degrees of Priests among them, to offer unto him Sacrifices
though the Gentiles had the like: and what inconvenience could there come by
placing Archbyshops (which should faithfully preach the word of God, and
carefully govern the Church of Christ) even in those places where there were
Archiflamines, who did deface Christianity, and persecute the Christians? For
by these means there could no harm come unto them, as there might have done
to the Israelites by using of such things of the Gentiles as he forbad unto
them, but the contrary: For this was a means to pluck them from all their
superstition and Idolatry. Neither is this in any respect a framing of the
ministry of the Gospel by the examples of Idolatrous and heathnish
functions. Except you will say also that because the Gentiles had Flamines, and
the Christians had Bishops, therefore the Christian Bishops were framed
according to the example of the Gentiles Flamines. If you cannot say so truly
in Bishops, neither can you justly affirm it of Archbishops: for the reason is
all one. Do you think this to be a good collection: where in the Popes time
there was a Massing priest, now is there placed a Minister of the Gospel, Ergo
the ministry of the Gospel is framed according to the example of Massing
priests? And yet thus do you conclude, that because there are nowadays
Archbishops where before there were Archiflamines, therefore the ministry of
the Gospel is framed according to the heathnish and ydolatrous functions.

You say after that James was an Archbishop, if he were, he was the first and
placed over the Jews.

And although S. Peter might, to gain the Gent^es, be c^ntent to use their
^dolatrous functions, with a little change of their names, yet there is none
so mad to think that he would translate any such function, from the
Gentiles to the Jews, which were never before accustomed with any such
Flamines or Archiflamines. And this I dare generally and at once say, against
Math. 5. 10. 9.
you and your Element, that the Lord translated diverse things out of the Law
into the Gospel as the Presbetery, or eldership, excommunication, and the
office of Deacons (as it is thought) for that the Sadducees, of whom so often
mention is made in the gospel, are thought to have had that office to provide
for the poor, for those that know the Hebrew tongue, do understand that
Tsadi^im (...)
and Tsidkah, do not only signify Justices and just men, but also alms
and almesmen: I say these and others more translated from the law unto the
gospel: but neither you nor your Clement, shall ever be (...) to show, that
the Lord ever translated any thing from Gentelisme into the gospel.

We read in the Acts, that all the Gentiles were commanded, to conform
themselves unto Act. 15.
the Jews in the ab^ayning from blood and strangled meat for a time, but we
can n^er find that the Jews were commanded to conform themselves to the
Gentiles in their (...), the reason whereof is, because the one was sometime
the law of God, and therefore he that had conscience in it, was to be borne
with, and the other came from men and out of their forge which the Lord would
never g^ue so much honor unto, as to make other men by any means subject unto
them.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you had not learned that point of Sophistry which is called Petitio
princip^j, (whereof I have so o^tentimes told you) without doubt you had lacked
much matter, and your book would have been very thin. For all this ado in
this place is nothing but discanting upon a false plain song. The offices of
an Archbishop and Bishop are no Idolatrous functions but Christian, and meet
both for Jew and Gentile converted unto Christ: neither are they translated
from the Gentiles, but grounded upon the word of God, practiced in the
Apostles time, approved by the best counsels as is declared in the answer to
the Admonition, and shall be more amply hereafter, occasion being offered.
Wherefore all this that you have here said, (the ground being taken away)
serves for no purpose.

Your conjecture of the Deaconship to be taken from the Jews, is but a mere
conjecture, if there had been any such office in the law, it would have been
specified in one place or other of the old Testament.

Touching your eldership we shall see what you have to say for it in place. I
will not trouble my self and the reader with bye matters not incident to this
question. And yet I would gladly learn of you in what portion of the law your
presbytery is commanded or prescribed, for I told you before out of M.
Calvin, that it was appointed after the return of the Jews from the
captivity of Babylon.

Your reason why there should be no orders or ceremonies taken from the
Gentiles is not sufficient: for it is a negative reason ab authoritate. But to
speak of that matter is now from the purpose because I have denied these
offices to be taken from the Gentiles.

Chap. 2. the seventh Division.
T. C. Page 68. Sect. 4.
B^t what if there were no such offices among the Gentiles and Paganes as
Archiflamine^ and Protoflamines? whereof before I show the conjectures which I
have, I must give the gentle reader to understand, that I am not ignorant that
there are diverse which say there were such offices among the Gentiles, and
namely here in England: that there were. 25. Flamines and three Archiflamines,
whereof were made three Archbishops of London, Canterbury, and York, and. 25.
Bishops as Platine has in the chapter E^eutherius. And Ga^frydus Monemutensis
in his second book and first chapter. And ^s I think Gildas also, and Lumbard
in his fourth book speaks of it, as a general thing that was in all places
where Paganism was. But if so be that the religion of other Paganes did
follow, and was like unto that of the Romans (which is very probable) they
being then the rulers of the whole world in a manner, unto whose example all
men do lightly conform themselves even without commandment, then there is
great lykelyhood, there were no such Archiflamines or Protoflamines out of
Tullie, which shows that there were among the Romans diverse kinds of
Priests whereof some were called Flamines of a several attire which they ware
always on there heads, other Pontifices, and a third sort were called Salij,
and the chief of those Flamines was called Flamen dialis, who was als^
distinguished from the rest by a white hatte: but of any Archiflamines, or
Protoflamines, he makes no mention at al: and therefore it is like that there
was never any such office amongst the Paganes.

Io. Whitgifte.
Whether there were such offices among the Gentiles or no, the matter is not
great, nor worthy of deciding. But that there were such it is manifest, if
any credit is to be given to so many Histories and writers both
Eccles^asticall and profane, Archiflamin^
not only those whom you have reported, but Gratian, Polydore, and others. But
as a sufficient confutation of all this that you have here written, and as an
argument of your unskillfulness in stories, I will set down the words of
Master Fox, Tom. 1. Page 146. which be these: Let us return to Eleutherius
the good bishop, who M. Fox, tom. 1. fol. 146.
hearing the request of the King and glad to see the godly towardness of
his well disposed mind, sends him certain teachers and preachers: called
Fugatius, or by some Fagamus, and Damianus or Dimianus, which converted first
the King and people of Britayne, and baptized them with the baptism and
sacrament of Christ's faith. The Temples of Idolatry and other monuments of
Gentilitie they subverted, converting the people from their diverse and many
Gods, to serve one living God. Thus true religion with sincere faith
increasing, superstition decayed with all rites of Idolatry. There were then
in Britayne. 28. head Priests which they called Flamines, and three
Archpriestes among them which were called Archiflamines having the oversight of
their manners, as judges over the rest. These. 28. Flamines they turned to.
28. Bishops, and the three Archiflamines to three Archbyshops having then their
^eates in three principal Cities of the realm: that is in London, in York,
and in Glamorgantia, videlicet in vrbe legionum, by Wales. Your conjecture
therefore is but vain, and cannot counteruayle so many witnesses.

Moreover your argument is negative from humane authority: for you argue that
there were no Archiflamines among the Paganes, because Tullie makes no mention
of them, and therefore of no credit. Besides why might not the Grecians call
those Archiflamines whom Tullie called Flamines diales. But the matter is not
worthy the labor, and therefore thus briefly to have answered it shall
suffice: only I would have the Reader by the way to note the antiquity of
Archbishops here in England, even from the first beginning of the public
profession of Christiani^e; Archbyshops in England, An. Do. 180.
which was Anno. 180. or there about.

Chap. 2. the. 8. Division.
T. C. Page 68. Sect. 5.
And if there were, I have showed how wicked it is to say that Peter framed the
ministry of the Gospel by it. Now let it be seen of all men how strongly
you have concluded, that the names of Archbyshops are not Antichristian, when
as it is most certain that he was a pillar of Antichrist, upon whom your
reason is grounded.

Io. Whitgifte.
Though it be certain that Peter framed not the ministry of the gospel by
any custom of the Paganes, yet your arguments are of no force, to prove that
he did not place ministers of the gospel, where there were before priests of
the Paganes, call them by what other name you will^or that in the chie^ Cities
he placed not such as might direct and govern the rest: seeing it is the
consent of all writers that the Apostles when they had planted Churches, did
place Bishops, and other ministers in the Churches which were planted.

Whether he were a pillar or no of Antichrist by whom I have hitherto proved
the names of Archbyshops not to be Antichristian, I leave it to the learned to
judge. ^f you mean Clement of whom Polidore does borrowe his report, it is
evident that Polidore means that Clement that was one of the first Bishops of
Rome, who was no pillar of Antichrist but a godly Bishop. If you mean Polidore
himself upon whose credit I take the report, then surely h^wsoeuer in diverse
points o^ Papism^ he erred, yet is he one that has greatly detected and opened
their supers^itions, and whose authority neither your self nor any other
learned man in many things will ref^se.

But if all this were true that you say, yet may we take reports of
antiquities Repor^es of antiquity may be taken from infi^ls.
even from Turks, Paganes, Papists, or ^ls must we condemn the most part of
Histories.

The times wherein Uolusianus lived declare sufficiently how littell credit is
to be given to his testimony, which were when the mass had place, if not so
wicked as it was after, yet notwithstanding far differing from the
simplicity of the supper which was left by our Savior Christ. And Eusebius is
of more credit in this than Uolusianus, which in the third book and fourth

of it, and in the preface before his works it is said that after his
conversion he went to Rome to Clement, and was sent with others of Clement into
the weste parts, and that he came to Paris and was there executed, whether
soever of these opinions is true that falls which Uolusianus affirms. And
if either Uolus^anus or you, will have us believe that Dionysius Areopagita was
Archbishop of Athens you must show some better authority than Eusebius, or
Dionysius bishop of ^orinth, and then your cause shall have at the least some
more color of truth.

Io. Whitgifte.
Thus indeed may you easily wype away all authority of Histories, and
Fathers. But this shifte will not serve your turn with wise and learned men.
Uolusianus was very well learned, and a very godly Bishop in his time, neither
is it to be thought that he would write any thing in such a matter which he
had not certaynely learned of worthy writers. Your reason brought out of
Eusebius, to prove the contrary, fails in two respects. First, because it
is negative from authority and that of man: For thus you conclude: Eusebius
did not call him Archbishop, Ergo, he was no Archbishop: which kind of
argument is never good in any respect, when it is taken from the authority of
man. Secondly, your argument fails, because Histories be not so curious in
cal^ing men by their several titles. They think it sufficient, if they use
the common and most usual name, eu^n as it is the common use amongst us, to
call the Archbishops of Canterbury and York oftener by the names of Bishops of
Canterbury and York, than by the names of Archbishops. So that in deed your
argument being denied, you are not able by any sound reason to confirm it.
If Eusebius or Dionisius had denied ^him to be an Archbishop, your argument had
bin good.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 65. Sect. 3.
Erasmus in his argument of the Epistle to Titus, says that Paul made Titus
Archbishop of Creta, but Antichrist was not in Paul's time, Ergo, the name of
an Archbishop was not invented by Antichrist.

T. C. Page 69. Sect. 1.
Erasmus follows, which says Titus was Archbishop of Crete, whom I could
answer with his own words. For I am sure he will grant me, that Titus and
Timothy had one office, the one in Ephesus, ye other in Crete, but it
appears by Erasmus his own words that Timothy was but a Bishop of Ephesus,
therefore Titus was but Bishop of Crete. A slender proof.
For Eras^us in his argument upon the first Epistle of Timothy, says that S.
Paul did inform Timothy of the office of a Bishop, and of the discipline of
the Church. If either he had bin an archbishop, or an Archbishop had bin so
necessary as it is made, he would have instructed him in that also.

Io. Whitgifte.
This makes wholly against your self, for hereby it appears that the
writers use not any great curiosity in observing proper titles, but they
think it sufficient, if that name of office be used that comprehends all.
Where does Erasmus say, that Timothy was but a Bishop? Will you not learn
to deal plainly? But let us hear your argument: Erasmus says, that S. Paul
did inform Timothy of the office of a Bishop, and of the discipline of the
Church, Ergo, Erasmus says that Timothy was no Archbishop. Undoubtedly you
had need bear with other men's unskillfulness in Logike, if you use such
reasons in good earnest. This argument also is negative ab bumana authoritate,
Whatsoever is necessary for a Bishop is necessary for The difference betwixt

an Archbishop, and the office of a Bishop is the office of an Archbishop.
There is no difference of Bishop and Archbishop, but only this, that the
Archbishop has authority over other Bishops, to call them together when
occasion serves, to see that they walk according to the laws and rules
prescribed to keep unity and concord in the Church, and such like. There
is no difference quantum ad ministerium, in respect of their ministry and
function, but only quoad politiam and ordinem, in respect of policy and
order, as I have said before.

And I pray you tell me whether Erasmus or the greek Scoliaste be more to be
believed in this point, out of whom is taken that which is in the latter end
of the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, where they both are called the first
elected Bishops that ever were, either of Ephesus or Creta: for my part I
think they were neither Bishops nor Archbishops, but This is often promised,
but never per^ormed.
Evangelists, as shall appear afterward. But it may be sufficient to have set
against Erasmus authority, the authority of the Scholiast. And here if you
will cavil, and say that the Scholiast which says he was Bishop, denies not
but that he also was an Archbishop, because an Archbishop is a Bishop, it may
be answered easily, that the Scholiast did not speak nor write so improperly,
as to call them by the general name of Bishop, whom he might as easily have
called (if the truth would have let him) by a more proper and particular name
of Archbishop. And further in This division is not so strange as you make it.
this division of the ministers, the Archbishop and the Bishop are members of
one division, and therefore one of them can not be affirmed and said of an
other, for that were contrary to the nature of a true division.

Io. Whitgifte.
I tell you that Erasmus and the grecke Scholiaste, do very well agree, and
the one does expound the other. I tell you also that your negative arguments
are not worth a rushe, use them as often as you list. What you think of
Thimothie or Titus being Archebishops or Bishops, is not material, but of
what force your reasons are shall be considered, when you utter them. If
Erasmus and the Greek Scholiaste were of diverse judgments in this point (as
they be not) yet were it an unlearned answer to set the one against the other.

He that calls an Archbishop a Bishop, speaks properly, for so he is in the
respect of his ministry, and substance of his office, the name of
Archbishop he has only in respect of order and policy. Archbishop and
Bishop are members of one division, as chief Justice and Justice is. Every
chief Justice is a Justice, but every Justice is not a chief Justice: even so
every Archbishop is a Bishop, but every Bishop is not an Archbishop: neither is
this such a strange division as you think it to be. For Aristotle did in
like manner divide (...) in Regnum, Aristocratiam, and (...) that is, that which
is commonly called (...).

T. C. Page 69. Sect. 3.
And yet I have a further answer both to Erasmus and Uolusianus, and
whatsoever other have written after this sort, that they spoke and gave titles
to those men they wrote of, not according to that which they were, but
according to the custom and manner of that age wherein they wrote. And so we may
read that Uincentius and Nicephorus writing of Uictor, speak far otherwise
Vinc. 10. li. cap. 124. Nicep. 4. li. cap. 38.
of him than Eusebius does, which notwithstanding wrote of the same man which
they did. The one calls Uictor the Pope of Rome: Nicephorus falsified.
and the other faith, that in glory he passed all the Bishops before him,
which Eusebius never makes any word of. Even so Uolusianus and Erasmus, living
in the times when as they which were ye most esteemed in the ministry, were
called archbishops, call Titus and Dionisius Archebishops, upon whom depended
the chief care of those Churches which they governed.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is no answer at all, first because Erasmus would then have given to
Timothy the same title also: secondly because Erasmus being a man of so
singular knowledge and judgment, would not otherwise than truly report of
any man, especially in such a case, and handling matters of divinity.
Thirdly, because when he wrote, there was neither Bishop nor Archbishop at
Creta, as there was at Rome, when Vincentius and Nicephorus writ. And if this
were true that you say, then should Eusebius when he wrote of Victor, have
termed him a Patriarch or an Archbishop, or Metropolitan at the least. For
these names were usual in Eusebius his time. But why do you untruly report
of Nicephorus? for in that book and chapter he gives unto Victor no other
name and title, than the same that Eusebius does, for he calls him by the
bare name of Victor, without any other title, neither does he say, that in
glory he passed all the Bishops before him, but this he says, that the other
Bishops which were with him, did diswade him from excommunicating the Bishops

glory. Therefore he says that he did excel in glory those Bishops that
were then, not those which were before him. But what is this to your purpose?

I omit Anacletus a godly Bishop and Martyr, who lived Anno Domini. 85.
which in his Epistle, Tom. 1. conci. diverse times makes mention of
Archbishops, Patriarchs, Primates, Metropolitanes, and says, that S. James,
which was called Iustus, was the first Archbishop of Jerusalem.

I omit also Anicetus, who lived Anno Domini. 155. which likewise in his
Epistle makes mention of Archebishops. Because these Epistles are not without
just cause suspected either to be none of theirs, or else in diverse points
corrupted.

T. C. Page. 69. Sect. 3.
There follows Anacletus, an other of these witnesses which must depose that
the name of an Archbishop is not Antichristian, of whom, as of Clement that
went before, and Anicetus which follows after, the common proverb may be

he can. And this (...) man says, that James was the first Archbishop of
Jerusalem: but Eusebius says, James was Ibi. 2. 23.
Bishop, not Archbishop of Jerusalem, and appointed by the Apostles. And in the
third book, It is the* (...) chapter.
22* chapter, he says, that the Apostles did appoint after his death, Simeon
the son of Cleophas Bishop of Jerusalem. And Ireneus in his fourth book. 63.
chapter, says that the Apostles in all places appointed Bishops unto the
Churches, whereby it may appear what an idle dream it is of Clement,
Uolusianus, and Anacletus, either that Peter did this by his own authority,
or that the primitive Church was ever stained with these ambicious titles of
Patriarch, primate, Metropolitan, or Archbishop: when as the stories make
mention, that throughout every Church, not every province, not by Peter or
Paul, but by Apostles, a Bishop, not an Archbishop was appointed.

Io. Whitgifte.
If they be the A^acletus, or Clemens, or Anicetus that commonly they are taken
for, and these writings were theirs uncorrupted, then were their witness
sufficient, although they were Bishops of Rome. But I neither will defend
their writings, neither do I think them to be worthy any defense, only I
require but that liberty of using them, that no learned man refuses when they
serve his turn. Master Calvin does allege this Anacletus his authority to
prove that the peoples consent Calvin. M. F^xe.

M. Fox tom. 1. page 12. who writes thus: Wherefore as we must needs grant
the Bishop of Rome to be called a Metropolitan, or an Archbishop by the
Council of Nice: so we will not greatly stick in this also, to have him
numbered with Patriarchs or Primates: which title seemed in old time to be
common to more Cities than to Rome, both by the Epistle of Anacletus, of Pope
Stephanus, and Pope Julius, and Leo. etc.

Master Jewel also himself does use his authority in that sort that I do.
But what need you be so curious, who have so often alleged the Canons of the
Apostles: and in your. 95. page you use the authority of Higinus or Pelagius,
as great a counterfeite as this Anacletus is. I speak not this to win any
credit to Anacletus his M Jewel. Page 95. sec. 4
Epistles or decrees, but to avoid your cauils, and to show that in citing
him in this manner and form that I do, I do no otherwise than other godly
and learned men have done. You shall understand ere I come to an end, that I
have not alleged him for any need.

Your argument to prove that James was no Archbishop, because Eusebius and
other do call him Bishop and not Archbishop, is of the same nature that your
other arguments be, that is, ab authoritate negative: and therefore must be
sent away with the same answer.

Whether the Apostles placed James and Simeon at Jerusalem, or no, is not the
question. But you are something deceived in your quotation, for you should in
the place of the. 22. chapter of Eusebius, have noted the. 11. chapter.

The place of Ireneus, though it make not against any thing that I have
spoken, if it were as you do allege it, yet must I tell you, that it is by
you not truly understood. For Ireneu^ does not say that the Apostles did
together in every place Irenaeu^.
appoynte Bishops, but he says, Secundum successiones Episcoporum, quibus illi
eam, quae in vnoqueque loco est ecclesiam tradiderunt. According to the
succession of Bishops, to whom they committed the Church that was in every
place. Meaning that every one of the Apostles did appoint Bishops in those
Churches, which they had planted, as S. Paul did at Ephesus and Creta. And
notwithstanding that in some Churches the Apostles together did place Bishops,
yet that in other Churches which they planted, Sometime one Apostle did
appoint Bishops. Tertulli. de praescript.
they did the same severally, it is manifest, not only by these examples of
Timothy and Titus, but of sundry other, whereof we may read in
ecclesiastical histories, and namely of * Policarpus made Bishop of Smirna, by
S. John. And you your self testify the same of S. John out of Eusebius, even
in the next section. Moreover, it can not be gathered, either out of the
words of Ireneus, or any other ecclesiastical history, that the Apostles did
place Bishops any where, but in the chief and principal Towns and Cities,
committing unto them the government of other Uillages and Towns, and the
appoynting of several Pastors for them, as it is also evident in the foresaid
examples of Timothy and Titus, and the words of Ireneus importe the same. But
if they had in every Hamlet placed Pastors, yet does it not follow, but that
there might be some one in a Dioces or Province, by whom these Pastors
should be directed: As Timothy at Ephesus, Titus at Crete.

Chap. 2. the. 14. Division.
T. C. Page 69. Sect. vlt.
And here you put me in remembrance of an other argument against the
Archbishop, which I will frame after this sort. The mayor false.
If there should be any Archbishop in any place, the same should be either in
respect of the person or minister, and his excellency, or in respect of the
magnificence of the place: but the most excellent ministers that ever were, in
the most famous places, were no Archebishops, but Bishops only, therefore
there is no cause why there should be any Archbishop: For if there were ever
minister of a congregation worthy, that was James. If there were ever any City
that ought to have this honor, as that the minister of it should have a more
honorable title than the ministers of other cities and towns, that was
Jerusalem, where the son of God preached, and from whence the Gospel issued
out into all places. And afterward that Jerusalem decayed and the Church
there, Antioche was a place where the notablest men were, that ever have bin
since, which also deserved great honor, for that there the Disciples were
first called Christians, but neither was that called the first and chiefest
Church, neither the ministers of it called the Arche or principal Bishops.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is a strange matter that you should so grossly err in making arguments,
seeing you have taken upon you so great skill in that Art. But I will not be
occupied in examining the form of it. Your mayor is not true, for such
offices may be appointed rather in the respect of the time, and of the
persons that are to be governed, Why these offices are appointed.
than of the worthynesse of the minister, or the dignity of the plate: and
therefore your mayor does not conteyne a perfect and sufficient distribution.
Again the worthiness of the person, and the dignity of the place, be not at
all the causes why such offices should be appointed in the Church, but the
suppression of sects, the peace of the Church, and the good government of the
same. The worthiness of the person may make him meet for such an office, and
the place may be convenient for such officers to remain in: but neither of
them both can be a sufficient cause why such offices should be appointed. I
know the worthiest cities have had the pre-eminence in such matters, but it
was because they were the most meetest places for that purpose, and the place
does only add one piece of title to the office, but it is not the cause of
the office. Lastly, you have not yet proved that there was no Archbishops in
those places, or that James had not that office.

Chap. 2. the. 15. Division.
T. C. Page. 70. Lin. 9. This is contrar^ to that which was immediately
affirmed before.

And Eusebius to declare that this order was firm and durable, shows in the
third book 13. chapter, that Saint John the Apostle, which ouerliued the
residue of the Apostles, ordained Bishops in every City.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is no reason at all: S. John ordained Bishops in every Church, therefore
there was no one Bishop superior unto them to govern and direct them in
matters of The office of an archbishop in S. John.
discipline, order and doctrine, if occasion served: I think that S. John him
self was directer and governor of them all, and in effect their Archbishop.
And that does manifestly appear in that third book and. 23. chapter of
Eusebius. For thus he says: In those days John the Apostle and Evangelist,
whom the Lord loved, lived Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 2^*
as yet in Asia, which did govern the Churches there, after he was returned
out of the Isle, from banishement, after the death of Domitian. And a little
after he says, That he went being desired, ad vicina Gentium loca, vt partim
constitueret Episcopos, partim tota^ ecclesias componeret, partim clerum ex his
quos spiritus sanctus iudicasset sort deligeret: Unto the places of the
Gentiles adjoining, partly that he might appoynte Bishops, partly that he
might establishe whole Churches, partly that he might by lotte choose such
into the Clergy, as the holy Ghost should assygne. So that whether he had
the name of Archbishop, or no, certain it is, that he had the government and
direction of the rest, and that he appointed Bishops and other Ministers.
Eusebius does not say that he ordained Bishops in every Church, for his
words be as I have reported them. But if he had so said, it had not made any
thing to your purpose, but against you. For he appointed them, not all the
Apostles, nor the people, and he governed and directed them as their Archbishop.

These two Anacletus and Anicetus you say are I say not only suspected, but
that they are not without just cause suspected
suspected, why do you say suspected, when as they have bin convinced and
condemned, and stand upon the pillorie with the cause of forgerie written in
great letters, that he which runs may read. Some of the Papists them
selves have suspected them, but those which maynteyne the truth, have
condemned them as full of popery, full of blasphemy, and as those in whom
was the very spirit of contradiction to the Apostles and their doctrine.

And do you mark what you say, when you say that these are but suspected?
Thus much you say that it is suspected or in doubt, whether the whole body of
Popery and Antichristianitie were in the Apostles time, or soon after, or no.
For Clement was in the Apostles time, and their scholar* and so you leave it in
doubt whether the Apostles appointed and were the authors of popery or no. I
think if ever you had read the Epistles, you would never have cited their
authorities, nor have spoken so favorably of them as you do.

Io. Whitgifte.
I say that they are not without just cause suspected, which you have left
out, and therefore it appears that you have laid aside sincerity. I have
alleged them with as little credit unto them, as either master Calvin, or
any other does. You your self have sundry times in this Reply used (as I
have said) as forged authors as these be, with less defacing of them. Turpe
est doctori. etc. I can show good proof that I have read their Epistles: but I
am not disposed either to boast of my own reading, or to deface other men's: I

But that notable and famous Council of Nice, must be, and is of all wise and
learned men next unto the scriptures themselves reverenced, esteemed, and
embraced. That Council celebrated Anno Domini. 330. (when as the Bishops of
Rome were as yet learned Council. Nice.
and godly men) does not only allow of the name, but also of the office of
Metropolitan, Archbishop, Archdeacon. etc.

In the sixte Canon of that Council it is thus written: This Metropolitan.

Bishops. So is it likewise in the. 26. and. 27. Canons of the same Council.

T. C. Page 70. Sect. 3.
You come after to the Council of Nice, wherein I will not stick with you that
you say it was holden the. 330. year of the Lord, when it may appear by
Eusebius his computation, that it was holden Anno Domini. 320.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know that there is some variety among the writers, for the time of this
Council. Uar^tie concerning the time of ye Nicen Council.
Musculus in his common places says, that it was celebrated Anno Domini. 313
the writers of the Magd. History, centu. 4. cap. 9. affirm (as they say) out
of Eusebius that it was Anno Dom. 320. Master Fox Tom. 1. fol. 12 thinks
that it was Anno Dom. 340. and so does Illyricus him self in his defense of
the Magd. History, though he seem to be of a contrary judgment in the
History it self. Pantaleon in his Cronographie places it Anno Do. 330. Some
there be that say it was. 324. etc. So that to differ in the year is no such
matter as deserves any such nippe. But if all circumstances be well
considered. It will fall out that Eusebius himself confirms that which I
have set down, touching the time of that Council. For Constantine began his
reign according to Eusebius his Cronicle. Anno. 311. and this is noted also
Cent. 4. fol. 62. But the Nicene Council according to the said Centurie fol.
617. was holden Anno. 17. Constantini. So that it must needs be by their own
collection Anno. 328. or very near. But if we admit Eusebius Cronicle for
the beginning of Constantines reign videlicet Anno. 311. it will fall out by
Eusebius himself upon the time which I have appointed, for Lib. 4. de vita
Constantini, he says that the Nicene Council was holden Anno vicesimo imperij
Constable. So that it must needs be Anno. 330. or in the beginning. 331. at the
uttermost, but under it cannot be.

And here you take so great a leap, that it is enough to break the
Archbyshops neck, to skippe at once. 300. years without any testimonye of
any, either father or story of faith and credit which makes once mention
of an Archbishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
This leap shall not hurt him one whit. For if there were no other testimony
but Archbyshops and Metropolitanes long before the Nicene Council. Council.
Niceni. Can. 6.
that Council, it were of sufficient credit, and ability both to save his
neck, and his body from all kind of harm. For seeing it is thus written in
the sixth Canon of that Council Antiqua consuetudo seruetur per Aegyptu^,
Libyam and Pentapolim, vt Alexandrinus Episcopus horum omnium habeat
potestatem, quia and vrbis Romae Episcopo parilis mos. est. etc. Let the
ancient custom be kept throughout Aegipt Libia and Pentapolis that the
Bishop of Alexandria have the government of all these, for the Bishop of the
city of Rome has the same order. Likewise in Antioche and other Provinces,
let every Church retain her privileges. But this is generally plain that if
any be made Bishop without the consent of his Metropolitan, the great Synod
has decreed that he ought to be no Bishop. And in the seventh Canon, Quia
consuetudo obtinuit and antiqua traditio, vt Aeliae Can. 7.
Episcopus honoretur, habeat honoris consequentiam salua metropolis dignitate.
For as much as custom and ancient tradition has been such, that the Bishop
of Jerusalem be honored, let him have honor accordingly, not impairing the
dignity of the Metropolitan city. It is plain that Archbyshops and their
office were long before the Council of Nice, for else why should the Canon
say, Let the old custom be observed. etc. And M. Fox tom. 1. Page 12.
reporting these two Canons says thus. First in the Council of M. Fox.
Nice which was the year of our Lord. 340. and in the sixth Canon of the said
Council we find it is so decreed that in every Province, or Precinct some one
Church and Bishop of the same was appointed and set up to have the inspection
and regiment of other Churches about him, Secundum morem antiquum, that is,
after the ancient custom, as the words of the Council do purport. So that
the Bishop of Alexandria should have power of Libia, and Pentapolis in Egypt,
for as much as the Bishop of the City of Rome has the like or same manner.
Now if I might as safely allege the Canons of the Apostles as you do, then
could I tell you that in the. 33. Canon (which Canon is alleged as good
authority against the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome) you shall find
Archbyshops. For that Canon setting an order among Bishops wills the Bishops
of every nation to know their first or chief Bishop, and him to be taken for
the head of them. The words of the Canon be these. Cuiusque gentis Episcopos
oportet sc^re, quisnam Cano. Apo. 33. alias. 35.
inter ipsos primus sit, habereque ipsum quodammodo pro capite, neque sine
illius voluntate quicquam agere insolitum. The Bishops of every country must
know who is chief among them, and must take him as it were for their head,
neither must they do any unaccustomed thing without his will, and every one
must do those things alone by him self which belong to his parish and to the
places that be under him: But neither must he do any thing without the will of
all them, for so shall concord be kept, and God shall be glorified through our
Lord in the holy Ghost. Now I pray you tell me what difference there is betwixt
the first or chief Bishop, or head of the rest and Archbishop: And least you
should think this Canon to be of small force (as suspected) you shall hear
it almost verbatim repeated and confirmed by the Council of Antioche, In every
country it is convenient that Council. Antioc^. Can. 9.
the Bishops should know that their Metropolitan Bishop bears the care of
the whole Province. Wherefore let all those that have any business repair to
the Metropolitan city. And for this cause it is thought good that he both
should excel in honor, and that the other Bishops do no unaccustomed thing
without him, according to the ancient rule appointed of our fathers, saving
those things only which belong to their own Diocese and to the places that
are under them. For every Bishop has power over his own parish to rule them
according to reverence meet for every one, and to provide for all the
country that are under his city, so that he ordeyne both Priests and Deacons
and contain all things with his judgment. But further let him attempt nothing
without the Metropolitan, neither let the Metropolitan do any thing without
the advice of the other. You have now the Canon of the Apostles confirming
Archbyshops, and the Council of Nyce and Antioche alleging old custom for
them, and confirming them also. And a little before In the. 7. Division before.
I declared unto you out of M. Fox that there were Archbyshops here in England
Anno. 180. So that their fall cannot be very great.

What? no mention of him in Theophilus Bishop of Antioche, none in Ignatius,
none in Clemens Alexandrinus, none in Iustine Martyr, in Ireneus, in
Tertullian, in Origin, in Cyprian, none in all those old Historiographers,
out of the which Eusebius gathers his story? was it for his baseness and
smalnesse, that he could not be seen among the Bishops, Elders and Deacons,
being the chief and principal of them all? Can the Cedar of Libanon be hyd
among ye Box trees? Aristotle in his Rhethoricke ad Theodecten says that it
is a token of contempt to forget the name of an other. Belike therefore if
there were any Archbishop, he had no chair in the Church, but was as it
seems digging at the metalles, for otherwise they that have filled their
book with the often mentioning of Bishops, would have no doubt remembered him.

Io. Whitgifte.
And what then? is not the Council of Nice, and of Antioche of as good credit
as all these? Shall not Athanasius, Epiphanius, Ambrose, Hierome, Chrysostom,
Sozomene, etc. counteruaile them? and yet if you had read these authors, you
might have learned that in the most of them, the office of an Archbishop is
expressed, as my answer following declares. But still you use negative
reasons ab authoritate, and that humane. Your tauntes and frumpes I let pass:
they are confutation sufficient to them selves.

Chap. 2. the. 20. Division.

But let us hear what the Council of Nyce has for these titles.

In the sixth Canon mention is made of a Metropolitan Bishop, what is that to
the Metropolitan which now is? either to the name or to the office. Of the
office it shall appear afterward. In the name I think there is a great
difference between a Metropolitan Bishop, and Metropolitan of England or of
all England. A Metropolitan Bishop was nothing else but a Bishop of that
place, which it pleased the Emperor or Magistrate, to make the chief city of
the Diocese or shire, aad as for this name, An untruth contrary to the
manifest words of the Council of Nice.
it makes no more difference between Bishop and Bishop, than when I say a
Minister of London and a Minister of Nuington. There is no man that is well
advised, which will gather of this saying, that there is as great difference in
pre-eminence between those two Ministers as is between London and Nuington. For
his office and pre-eminence we shall see hereafter.

Io. Whitgifte.
For the full answering of this it shall be sufficient to set down the
judgment of certain of the learned writers of our time, touching the true
meaning of that Canon The judgment of learned writers of the. 6. can. con.
N^cem. Calvin.
of the Council of Nyce, as the practice of the Church before that time, at
that time, and since that time, have expounded it.

M. Calvin in his Institutions Chap. 8. Sect 54. says thus. That every
province had among their Bishops an Archbishop, And that the Council of Nice
did appoint Patriarchs which should be in order and dignity above Archbyshops:
it was for the preservation of discipline. M. Calvin says the Council of
Nyce did appoint Patriarchs which should be in order and dignity above
Archbyshops. He says also that every Province had among their Bishops an
Archbishop.

Il^yricus in his cataloge testium veritatis speaking of this Council says
thus: Constituit Illyricus.
quoque haec Synodus, vt singularum prouinciarum Metropolitani, potestatem
habeant in suos Episcopos, sacerdotes and ecclesias, Alexandrinus in Aegypto,
Antiochenus in Syria. etc. This Synod also appointed that the Metropolitanes
of every province should have authority over their Bishops, Priests, and
Churches: The Bishop of Alexandria in Egypt, and the Bishop of Antioche in
Syria. etc. And in his book that he entituleth a refutation of the innectiue
of Brunus against the Centuries, he does interpret this Canon on this manner.
Here we see plainly that the Nicene Council first in this Canon does give a
primacie to the Metropolitan in every Province, and does make subject unto
him all the Bishops and Priests of his province. Moreover, that it makes all
the Metropolitan Bishops, as of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioche, and of other
Provinces altogether of equal authority amongst them selves. And last, that
the subjects (if that I may so say) of an other, may not appeal to any other
Metropolitan, and after this manner the sixth Council of Carthage does
understand, allege, and urge the foresaid Canon in the former Epistle.

M. Fox who has very diligently, and faithfully labored in this matter, and
searched out the truth of it as learnedly, as I know any man to have done, in
his first Tom. Page 11. writes thus. Then followed the Council of Nyce
wherein it was decreed M. Fox.
that throughout the university of Christ's Church which was now far spread
over the world, certain Provinces and Precinctes to the number of four were
appointed every one to have his head Church and chief Bishop, called them
Metropolitanes or Patriarchs to have the oversight of such Churches as did lie
about him: and Page 12. he speaks to the same effect as it may appear in
his words which I have before recited. And in the same Page he says:
Wherefore as we must needs grant the Bishop of Rome to be called a
Metropolitan or an Archbishop by the Council of Nyce: so we will not greatly
stick in this also, to have him numbered with Patriarchs or Primates. etc.

But the very words of the Canon it self does condemn you of a great
oversight, T. C. condemned of un truth by the words of the Canon. Can. 6.
For this is the Canon, antiqua consuetudo seruetur per Aegyptu^ Libyam and
Pentapolim: ita vt Alexandrinus Episcopus horum omnium habeat potestatem etc.
Let the ancient custom be kept throughout Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, that
the Bishop of Alexandria have the government of all these. etc. as is said
before.

How say you now? is not this for the name and for the office also of our
Metropolitanes and Archbyshops? had not they jurisdiction of whole Provinces,
as ours have? The authority of ^ ^tropo. ^ane.
were not all other Bishops and Ministers of the Church subject to them, as
they be to ours? were not they Metropolitanes of Provinces and countries as
ours be? And is this no more to differ, than a Minister of London and a
Minister of Nuington? Truly I marvel that you can be carried unto so manifest
untruths, and palpable errors. But for the further declaration of the
authority of a Metropolitan Bishop, though this which I have said be
sufficient, it may please you to take pains to peruse, in the Con. Antioc^.
Council of Antioche the. 9. Canon. Per singulas prouincias Episcopos conuenit
nosse Metropolitanum Episcopum, solicitudinem totius prouinciae gerere. In
every province it is convenient that Bishops should know, that the
Metropolitan Bishop has the caryng for of the whole province. etc. as is
mentioned before, in the first Canon of the Council of Ephesus. It is also
evident that the Metropolitan of the Province (for so is he there called) had
authority over all the Bishops in the same province. But to make short because
I shall have other occasion to speak of this matter, M. Fox in the treatise
before recited concludes thus, Whereby it is to be concluded, that to be
false that Clement and Anacletus and Anicetus be reported (but falsely) to put a
difference between Primates or Patriarchs, Metropolitanes, or Archbyshops,
whereas by sufficient authority (...) is to be proved, that in the old
Church both Primates, first Bishops, Bishops of the first seat, Patriarchs,
Metropolitanes, Bishops of the mother City, and Archbyshops, were all one.
First that Primates and Metropolitanes were both one, is before declared in the
Canons of the Apostles, and by the Council of Antioche aforesaid. The same does

affirm in his book de statu primitiuae ecclesiae. Fol. 26. and proves it
out of Socrates very manifestly: that is, that Metropolitanes and Patriarchs
were all one at the first. I am not ignorant but there is some controversy
among both the Ciuilians and Canonistes whether a Metropolitan or an
Archbishop be all one or no, but in the end this is the opinion of the most,
so far as I can read or learn, that they be idem re, the same in deed, but
differ nomine in name. For he is called an Archbishop in respect of the other
Bishops of whom he is the chief. But he is called Metropolitan in respect of
the Cities that be within his Province. But of Archbyshops and Metropolitanes
more must be spoken hereafter.

by the words of the Canons, but by the judgment of those, whose learning and
Religion was never as yet stained. I know that there is no small controversy
about the number of the Canons of that Synod. In the book of the Councils
there are only twenty, in Ruffine. 22. Athanasius in an Epistle that he (as
some think) with the other Bishops of Egypt writ to Marcus Bishop of Rome
(if any credit is to be given unto Canons ascribed to the Nicene council, not
found in the number extant. Con. Arelat.
that Epistle) writes that there were first. 80. and afterward the same
brought into 70. Canons. Isodorus in his preface to the Council, says that in
the decrees of Pope Julius, there is mention made of. 70. Canons, so that for
the number of the Canons there is great difference in the writers.

Concilium Arelatense the second, Canon the. 24. does recite a Canon of the
Council of Nice, touching infamous libels, which is not to be found among
the. 20.

Hierome in his preface upon the book of Judith says that the Council of
Nice did Hieronymus.
reckon that book in the number of the holy scriptures, and yet there is no
such thing to be found among those. 20. Canons.

Ambrose Lib. 10. the Epistle. 82. attributes another Canon to the Council of
Nice Ambrose.
concerning second Marriages in clerks, I could recite more Canons alleged by
good writers out of that Council, which are not to be found in those. 20. or.
22. but it shall not need.

Wherefore though I have alleged more Canons than are to be found in the
volume of Councels: yet I have done nothing which is strange, neither have I
alleged any Canon that is not agreeable to the sixth and seventh, whereof there
is no doubt: and according to the true meaning of those two Canons, as they be
interpreted by the The. 25. 26. 27. Canons differ only in number, not in
substance from the true Canons.

the very same with the. 6. and. 7. differing only in number, wherein I
followed the author that so placed them. And in the. 13. Canon the name of
Archbishop is added, whereof more shall be spoken hereafter (God willing).

M. Hardings. 44. Canon is plain repugnant to the sixth Canon, and therefore
without all doubt a counterfeite. But the Canons that I have alleged agree
both with the sixth and seventh, and therefore not unlike to be truly
attributed to that Council, in these points wherein I have alleged them.

Io. Whitgifte.
Fear not I warrant you, I have alleged nothing which I am not hable by
sufficient testimony to prove, that I have read my self. And therefore your
surmise is but grounded upon your own practice.

Whatsoever the Bishop of Salisbury says in his reply against Harding touching
the Canon alleged by him is most true, and I do most willingly acknowlenge it
so to be, neither do I take any Canon of that Council as undoubtedly tru^,

Ambrose also that old and learned father, both allows the name Ambrose.

T. C. Page 71. Sect. 2.
If Ambrose i^ little beholding to you, that cannot be accepted for a wi^nesse.
all should be allowed of that S. Ambrose allows of, then besides other
things which he holds corruptly, the marriage of the Ministers should go very
hard: but it is worthy to be observed with what words Ambrose does allow of
the Archbishop, that all men may understand, 1. Lib. offi. cap. 50.
how low it goes with M. Doctor, for his defense of the Archbishop: and how
the Archbishop is so out of credit, that there cannot be gotten any to be
suertie for his honesty. Ambrose complaining of the Ministers or Bishops in
those days says, if a man ask them who preferred them to be Priests, answer
is made by and by that the In those words Ambrose does not dissa low the
office, but the abuse of it by the person.
Archbishop for an hundred shillings ordained me Bishop, to whom I gave an
hundred shillings that I might get the favor to be Bishop, which if I had not
given I had not been Bishop: and afterward he says that this grieved him,
that the Archbishop ordained Bishops carnally or for some carnal respect, and
this is all the allowance that Ambrose shows of an Archbishop. Your
Archbishop takes all things in good part, so that his very dispraise he
expounds to his commendation.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know no man whose writings and works are so perfect (the writers of the
Canonical scriptures excepted) that all things in their books are to be
allowed. But God forbid that we should therefore reject that which they have
well and truly spoken: you will do little for Ambrose if you will not allow
him for an historical witness of that which was in his time, this is
therefore a shifting answer, but nothing commendable. It evidently appears
by that place, that in his time there were Archbyshops, for what though he
reprove the abuse of some Archbyshops in ordeyning Bishops and Ministers for
money, does he therefore disalowe, either the name or the office? Nay this is
rather to be concluded, that there were Archbyshops in Ambroses time, which had
authority to ordeine Bishops, because Ambrose does reprove such Archbyshops
as for carnal respects ordained Bishops.

Your undutiful and arrogant frumpes and scoffs I pass over. It seems by
your so often using them, that you are afraid, least you should be taken for a
modest Christian.

And there is great An unlikely likelyhoode void of truth.
likelyhoode, that the Archbishop which Ambrose makes mention of was no other
than he which for the time ruled the action wherein Bishops were ordained, and
after the action ended, had no more authority than the rest.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you had read any ancient story or father: yea if you had but perused M.
Caluines Institutions the. 8. Chapter, or any writer entreating of this matter,
you would never have uttered this vain conjecture, nor showed so manifest a
token of great ignorance, and no reading. For it shall appear by sufficient
testimony, that neither the name nor office of an Archbishop was any thing at
all straimge in this time. And the authors of the Centuries: Cent. 4. can tell
you that Ambrose himself was Metropolitanus Ambrose a Metropolitan. Cent. 4.
cap. 10
plurium coniunctarum ecclesiarum administratione fungens, A Metropolitan
governing many Churches adjoining together.

Your conjecture that this Archbishop should be no other, than he which for the
time ruled the action, wherein Bishops were ordained and after the action ended,
had no more authority than the rest, is a mere fancy of your own,
contrary to all authority, and without any ground or similitude of reason,
and yet you often repeat it, and make it the foundation of this your building.
But let us hear your conjectures.

Chap. 2. the. 24. Division.
T. C. Page 71. Sect. 4.
And I am moved so to think, First because it is not like, that one only
ordained Bishops, being contrary to the old Canons of the best Councels: but
that there were other, and that this who^ Ambrose calls Archbishop, did
gather the voices. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have showed before, that it was not so strange at this time for the Bishop
alone to ordeine Ministers. And yet Ambrose in this place signifies that the
people had Ambrose.
somewhat to do in this matter, for he calls them populum nugacem and
indoctum, qui talem sibi asciuerunt sacerdotem: a people that trifeleth and is
unlearned, that has gotten unto them such a priest. But I pray you where is
now your distinction betwixt election and ordination? For Ambrose speaks in
this place of ordeyning and not of electing. If you will needs so distinguishe
them that they may not be at any time, nor in any place confounded, then have
you answered your self here, and with one conjecture overthrown an other.
But howesoeuer it is, conjectures can not prevail against so manifest a
truth, being so silly conjectures. For tell me where you ever read that he
was called an Archbishop that did only gather the voices, or that this name was
attributed to any during the action only, and no longer. This is very new
Divinity unheard of in any good Author that I have readde, or can hear of.

Secondly, because it was very unlike that there was any absolutely above S.
Ambrose in those parts where he complayneth of evil bishops or ministers made.

Io. Whitgifte.
Why, to whom or for whom did Ambrose write this book? for his own province
or Diocese only? therein are you deceived, that you think Ambrose to have
written this book for his own Province only, when he writ it to profit
the whole Church, as it may appear in the first Chapter of that Book.
Neither does he complain of such evil Bishops or ministers as were under
him (for then should he have complained of himself, being their
Metropolitan) but of such he complayneth, as were in other places and
Provinces, as may be seen by these words of his. Ita vt videas in Ecclesia
passim, quos non merita sed pecuniae ad Episcopatus De dig. Sacer cap. 5.
ordinem prouexerunt, So that a man may see every where in the Church such
as are promoted to the order of a Bishop, not by deserts but by money, and
therefore this conjecture is soon answered.

Chap. 2. the. 26. Division.
T. C. Page 71. Sect. 6.
Thirdly, for that Ambrose in an other place (which you after cite) deuidyng
all the Church into the clergy and laytie, does subdeuide the clergy into
Bishops, Elders, and Deacons, and therefore it is not like, that there was
any which had any continual function of archebyshoppe: But as he was called
(...) or leader of the dance which comes first, and after coming in again
in the second or third place, is no more so called, so that bishop was called
Archbishop, which for the time present did gather the voices of the rest of
the bishops, which he by and by laid down, with the dissoluyng of the
meetyng. And that this is not my conjecture only, that there was no ordinarye
or absolute Archbishop Where, or which centurie^
let the Centuries be seen Untruth.
which allege that place of Ambrose to prove that the office of an archbishop
was not then come into the Church, which was four hundred years after
Christ, and more also.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a dancing devise in deed, without any shadow of truth, as it may
appear by that which already is alleged, and shall do more and more by that
which follows. You are marvelous circumspect in your quotations least you
should be tripped, and therefore you say let the Centuries be seen, but you
tell not where. Surely you do very untruly report the Centuries, for I have
read them where they do allege that place of Ambrose, and there is not to
be found any such matter, but the clean contrary, as is to be seen in that
place Cent. 4 cap. 7.
by you alleged of the fourth Cent. the words be these: Episcopi and
Metropolitani dicebantur a praecipuis seu primarijs ciuitatibus, sicut Basilium
Metropolitanu^ Capadocu^, Zozomenus vocat lib. 3. cap. 16. Et Archiepiscopi,
qualem Seleuciae fuisse Simeonem, idem retulit lib. 2. cap. 8. Patriarcha,
totius alicuius prouinciae diceba^ur Episcopus, vt Socrates indica^ Lib. 5.
cap. 8. Bishops and Metropolianes were named of the chief and princip^ll
Cities, as Zozomenus calls Basile the Metropolitan of Cappadocia, lib. 3.
cap. 16. and Archebishoppes, such as he reports that Simeon was of Seleucia
lib. 2. cap. 8. Patriarch of some whole province was called a Bishop, as
Socrates shows lib. 5. cap. 8. Wherefore it is too much boldness in you to
auouche so manifest untruths. Neither is it any marvel though you quote not the
places, for forgerie seeks corners. Forgerie seeks corn^rs.


And although that which has bin hitherto alleged out of the Counsels of
Nice, and Antioche, with the judgment of so many learned men interpretyng
the same, might serve to persuade any reasonable man, that the office and name
of Archebishoppe and Metropolitan is both of great antiquity and not for
one action only, or a dauncyng office (as you would have it) but fixed and
permanent: yet because I have to do with quarellers, before I go any further
in confuting, I will (...) down the judgment of other aunciente and famous
writers also, who allow both of these names and offices: And first I will
recite such as have the names expressed with the offices, then such as speak
of the very thing it self without the names. I will begin with Councels.

The Council of Nice, as you have heard, has the name of Metropolitan,
Councels of the name and o^ice of Metropolitan an^ Archbishop. etc. Con.
Ni^en. Can. 4. ^. 7.
and does limitte unto ^ym certain Provinces, to govern and take the care
of. It has bin declared that both M. Calvin, Illyricus, M. Fox, and others
do acknowledge the names and office of Patriarchs and Archbishoppes. etc. in
the same Canon to be contained. Neither do they, nor any other learned writer
deny these names and offices to have been in the primitive Church, and that
fixed to certain places and persons, not mouable by actions, nor practiced by
course. Likewise you have heard, how that Council by this clause Secundum
morem antiquum, according to the ancient custom, does signify that these
names and offices have been in the Church of long time, or else it would not
have bin said to be an old custom.

Moreover, the nynthe Canon of the Council of Antioche before alleged is Con.
Antiocb. can. 9.
most plain and evident, both for the name and the thing, together with the
long continuance of them in the Church.

The. 20. Canon of the same Council of Antioche says directly, that no
Bishops Can. 20.
may call a several Council without the consent of their Metropolitanes.

In the sixth and. 37. Canons Concilij Arelatensis, mention is made of the
Metropolitan, Con. Arelat. cano. 6. and. 37.
of his authority in ordering of bishops, and of the authority of his
Synod.

The like both for the name and the matter also, touching ordeynyng of Con.
L^odic. can. 12. Con Cartb. 2. Can 12.
Bishops is in the twelsth Canon of the Council of Laodicea.

In the second Council of Carthage in the twelfthe Canon it is evident, that
there was a Primate in every Province, and that without his commandment it
was not lawful for any to be ordained Bishop.

In the. 13. and. 17. and diverse other Canons of the general Council of
Carchage Con. Carth. can. 13.* 17. etc Con. Chalcedo.
as it is in the Greek copy the authority of the Primate is also expressed.

In the Council of Chalcedon the name of Archebishoppe is sundry times used:
Flauianus is there called Archbishop of Constantinople, Dioscorus Archbishop
of Alexandria and one Atticus bishop of Nicopolis, does call the said
Dioscorus Archi^piscopum nostrum, our Archbishop. Leo is called Archbishop of
Rome. etc.

Of the Councels that followed there is no doubt, and it were but superfluous
for me to stand in reciting of them, and therefore this shall suffice for the
Councels, to show that both the name of Metropolitan or Archbishop, and also
the authority is not unheard of in the Church of Christ, or a flitting or
slyding office. Fathers and (...) of the name and (...) ^t Archbishop.
E^phanius.


Now to the fathers and stories. Epiphanius Lib. 2. tom. 2. haeri. 68. calls
one Peter Archebishoppe of Alexandria. And that it may fully appear, that it
was both a continual office and of great authority and jurisdiction, I will
set town his words.

Et Meletius quidem in carcere detentus erat vna cum praedictis Martyribus, ac
Petro Alexandriae Arc^iepiscopo. etc. And Meletius truly was kept in prison
together with the forenamed Martyrs, and Peter the Archbishop of Alexandria:
and Meletius seemed to excel the other bishops of Egypt, for he had the
second place after Peter in his Archbishoprike, as being under him to help
him, and looking to Ecclesiastical matters under him: For this is the custom,
that the Bishop of Alexandria has the Ecclesiastical gouernmente of all
Aegypte, Thebais, and Mareota, and Libya, and Ammonica, and Mareotis, and
Pentapolis.

In the same leaf he calls this Peter Archbishop three times. This Peter
lived in the year of our Lord three hundred and four, twenty years at the
least before Peter, Arch^bishop of Alexandria about twenty years before the
Council of Nice. Idem.
the Council of Nice.

The same Epiphanius in the same Book and Tome baere. 69. writes thus:
Quotquot enim Ecclesiae in Alexandria catholicae Ecclesiae sunt, sub vno
Archiepiscopo sunt. All the Churches that are Catholic Churches in Alexandria,
are under one Archebyshoppe. And a little after he calls Meletius
Archebyshoppe of Aegypte, but yet subject to Alexander the Archebyshoppe of
Alexandria, and all this was before the Council ot Nice.

What can be spoken more aptely, and more plainly to my purpose? And if T. C.
will cavil at the authority of the author (which is the poorest shifte that
can be, especially when the author is so generally allowed) then for
breuities sake, I do refer him to the Epistle of Ianus Cornarius prefixed
before this Book, and to that which after ward I have alleged in his
defense out of the Centuries.

Athanasius was called Archebyshoppe of Alexandria: and that it may appear
that it was not a bare title, but an office of Government, you shall find
these words in his second Apology:

Iscbaras quidam, vt nequaquam clericus, ita moribus improbissimus conatus est
sui pagi insulas decipere, iactans sese clericum esse. Id vbi resciuisset eius
loci Presbyter, mibi tum Ecclesias Atbanas. Apol. 2.
perlustranti renunciauit: ego igitur. etc. A certain man named Ischaras, as
he was no Clearke, so was he most wicked in manners, who went about to
deceive the yles of his precinct, boasting that he was a Clarke: when the
Priest of that place understood thereof, he told it unto me, when I was
visiting my Churches, so I sent the same man together with Macharius the
Priest to fetch unto me Ischaras, whom when they found sick in his
chamber, they commanded his father to warn his son, that he attempted no
such thing as was reported of him. And after in the same place follows
Ischaras Letters of submission to Athanasius. In the same Apology there are
Letters of submission written by Arsennius Bishop of Hipsell, and the
Ministers and Deacons of the same Diecesse to Athanasius: the beginning of the
Letters is this: Et nos quoque diligentes pacem and vnanimitatem cum ecclesia
catholica, cui tu per Dei gratiam praefectus es, volensque ecclesiastico
Canoni, pro veteri instituto, subijci, scribimus tibi (Papa dilecte)
promittimusque in nomine Domini nos deinceps non communicaturos cum
schismaticis. etc. And we also loving peace, and concord with the Catholic
Church over which thou art by the grace of God appointed, and willing
according to the old custom to be subject to the Ecclesiastical Canon,
write to thee (loving father) and in the name of the Lord promise, that we
hences orth will not communicate with the Schismatikes.

By this it is plain that Athanasius had great jurisdiction over many Bishops,
and other Ministers, and ecclesiastical persons. Again in the same Apology
mention is made of an Archbishop.

In the same Book the Priests and Deacons of the Churches of Mareota, in an
Epistle that they writ to the Synod, besides that they call Athanasius,
Episcopum nostrum, our Bishop, they show that he used to visit the
Church solemnlye accompanied. Their words are woorthe the notyng, and be
these following: Vtpote qui non longis finibus ab Episcopo distemus, and comites
in lustranda Marioteei cohasimus, nunquam enim ille solus visitandi causa
itinera obire solet: sed comites secum trabere, Presbyteros and Diaconos and
non paucos ex plebe. Because we dwell not far from the Bishop, and we
accompanied him whilst he visited Mariotes, for he is never wont alone to take
iourneyes in visitations, but to take companions with him, Priests and
Deacons, and many of the people. And his own words a little before that
Epistle speaking of these Priests, and Deacons, be these: Et mecum Prouincias
lustrabant, And they visited the Provinces with me. Whereby also it is evident,
that he had a large jurisdiction, and that he did visit his Provinces. The
same Athanasius in that. Apology, declaring what this place called Mariotes
is, says: Mariotes ager est in Alexandria, quo in loco nunquam fuit Episcopus:
imo ne Chorepiscopus quidem, sed vniuer sae eius loci Ecclesiae Episcopo
Alexandrino subiacent: tamen vt singuli pagi, suos presbyteros habeant.
Mariotes is a territory of Alexandria, where there was never Bishop, no not so
much as a Bishops deputy, but all the Churches of that place are under the
Bishop of Alexandria, yet so that every village have their Priests.

In his Epistle Ad solitariam vitam degentes, he calls Lucius Metropolitan
of Sardinia, and Dionysius Metropolitan of Mediolane.

Socrates Lib. 5. cap. 8. says, that in the Council of Constantinople, They
confirmed Socrates.
the faith of the Nicene Council, and appointed Patriarchs, assigning their
Provinces, that the Bishops of one Dioces should not intermedle in other
Churches (for this before was indifferently used by reason of persecution) And
to Nectarius was allotted Megalopolis, and Thracia. etc.

The same is to be seen in the Canons of that Council of Constantinople.
Justinian. Illyricus. Cent. 4.


I omit Justinian the Emperor, who so often mentions these names and
offices in his Constitutions. I also omit that Illyricus calls Cyprian
Metropolitan of Carthage: and the fourth Centurie, where Ambrose is called
Metropolitan, having gouernmente of many Churches. Neither shall I need to
repeat the places of Calvin, M. Fox, M. Beza Lib. conf. cap. 5. or other
late writers judgments, who directely confess, that these names were usual
in the Primitive Church, and that the office was permanente: for this that is
spoken, may suafice.

I will come to those Authors and places, where the office and jurisdiction is
The office of Metropolitan and Archbishop without the name. Cyprian. Greg. Nazi.
spoken of, though the name be not expressed.

Cyprian Lib. 4. Epist. 8. says, that he had a large Province, Habet enim
Numidiam and Mauritaniam sibi cobaerentes, for it has Numidia and Mauritania
annexed unto it. And Gregory Nazianzene in the Oration that he made in the
commendation of Cyprian says, that he did rule and govern not only the
Churches of Carthage or Affrike, sed and Hesperiae vniuersae: imo Orienti fere
ipsi ad finem vsque meridiei and Septentrionis: but of all Spain, and almost
of the whole East, unto the end of the Southe and the North. And what was
this else, but to be an Archebyshop?

Eusebius Lib. 6. cap. 1. says, that Demetrius was Bishop of the Parishes of
Alexandria, Eusebius.
and of Egypt, and this Demetrius lived Anno Domini. 191. Eusebius testifyeth
there likewise that one Iulianus was before him in the same room.

Athanasius in an Epistle that he writ De sente^tia Dionysij Episcopi
Alexand. contra Arrianos, Atbanasius.
affirms, ad Dionysium Alexandria* Episcopum curam etiam Ecclesiarum in
Pentapoli superioris Libyae pertinuisse, that unto Dionysius Bishop of
Alexandria the care of the Churches in Pentapolis of the higher Libya
perteyned. And it is manyfeste in the same Epistle, that these Churches had
their Bishop besides. For Eusebius Lib. 7. cap. 26. Eusebius.
writes, that Basilides was Bishop of the parishes of Pentapolis while
Dionysius lived: so that it is evident that Dionyfius was an Archebyshoppe. And
this is that Dionysius that is called Alexandrinus, whose works be extante,
and is one of the most ancient writers. The same Eusebius says, that Gregory
did govern the Churches throughout Pontus.

Sozomen. Lib. 7. cap. 19. says, that though there be many cities in Sythia;
yet they Sozom.
have but one bishop.

Theodoret. lib. 4. cap. 11. testifyeth, that Amphilochius to whom the
Metropolitan city of Licaonia was committed to be governed, did also govern
that whole countreye, and did drive from thence the heresy of the Messalians:
And in the same Chapter we Theodoret.
read that Letoius governor of the Churches of Militia, burned Monasteries
infected with that heresy: which declares that Bishops had then great
authority in government.

Aurelius Bishop of Carthage in the Council of Affrike said, that he had the
ouersyght and care of many Churches.

T. C. Page. 71. Sect. vlt.
Basil you say, the great Metropolitan of Cappadocia. I have showed what the
word Metropolitan signifies, and how there was not then, such a
Metropolitan as we have now, and as the Admonition speaks against. You
play as he whithe is noted, as none of the wysest among the merchants,
which thought that every ship that approached the haven was his ship. For so
you think that wheresoever you read Metropolitan or Archebishoppe*
forthwith you think, there is your Metropolitan, or your Archbishop, where
as it shall appear, that besides the name, they are no more like, than a
bishop with us is like a minister.

Io. Whitgifte.
What this word Metropolitan signifies, what office and jurisdiction he had,
is before sufficiently declared, and may more at large appear in the
constitutions of Justinian. Likewise whether our Metropolitans in office any
thing at all differ from them. Surely he that shall well consider your unapt
answers and your vtopicall iestes, may think that you wear the liuerie of
those marchantes you talk of, and may very well sail in their ships.

Chap. 2. the. 27. Division.
T. C. Page 72. Sect. 1.
I can not tell whether you would abuse your reader here with the fallation of
the accent, because this word great is so placed between Basile and
Metropolitan, that it may be as well referred to the Metropolitan, as to
Basil, and so you having put no comma, it seems you had as lieue have your
reader, read great Metropolitan as great Basil. But that the simpler sort be
not deceived thereby, it is not out of the way to let the reader understand
what a great Metropolitan this was, which appears, for that when he was
threatened by the magistrate confiscation, of his Sozom. 6. l. e. 16.
goods, answered, that he was not afraid of the threatenings, and that all his
goods were a very few books, and an old gown: such were then those
Metropolitanes, under whose shadows M. Doctor goes about to shroude all this
pomp and princely magnificence of Archbishops.

Io. Whitgifte.
You search very narowly when you miss not a comma, but you know what
nugator signifies. All men of learning can tell that Basile is in common
speech called Basile the great. And yet if he were called great Metropolitan,
the title might very well agree unto him: for he had large and ample
jurisdiction, being bishop of Cappadocia, as Athanasius does also witness
in his Epistle written to Palladius.

The contention is for the name and the office, not for the riches, al^houghe I
think that there both are and have been Bishops in England as poor as Basile
if they had ^en taken so soon after they were placed in their bishoprikes, as
Basile was now at this time.

T. C. Page 72. Sect 2. 3. 4.
As for Symeon Archbishop of Sele^cia, I will not deny, but at that time was
the name of Archbishops. For then An unadvised answer.
Satan had made thorough the titles of Archbishops, Pr^ates, and Patriarchs,
as it were three stairs, whereby Antichrist might clyme up into his cursed
seat, notwithstanding there wanted not good decrees of godly councelles which
did strike at these proud names, and went about to keep them down. But the
swelling waters of the ambition of diverse, could not by any banks be kept in,
which having once broken out in certain places, afterward covered almost the
face of the whole earth.

This ^deuour of godly men may appear in the Council of Carthage, which
decreed, that the Con. Car^. cap. 39.
bishop of the first seat should not be called (...), that is, either the chief
of the priests, or the high priest, or any such thing, by which words
(any such thing) he shuts out the name of Archbishop, and all such hau^e
titles.

The same decree also was made in the Africane council, and if you say that
it was made against Con. tom. 1 cap. 6.
the Pope of Rome, or to forbid that any man should be called Archbishop,
show me where there was either bishop of Rome, or any other that ever made any
such title or chal^nge to be the general Bishop of all at that time, when this
council of Carthage was holden, when as the first of those which did make any
such challenge, was the bishop of Constantinople, which notwithstanding An
untruth.
challenged not the pre-eminence first over all, but that he might ordeyne
bishops of Asia, Pontus, Thracia, which were before appointed by their
Synodes, and this was in the council of Chalcedon, which was long after that
council of Carthage before remembered.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is before sufficiently declared, that these names and offices were allowed
and confirmed by the Council of Nice, and therefore not brought in by Satan.
Moreover this Symeon Archbishop of Seleucia, lived as it may appear by most
Chronicles about the time of the Council of Nice, and was martyred by Sapores
the king of Persia.

Which peradventure if you had understood, you would not have burste out
into this heat of words, for then might you have made the same answer to
Ambrose his authority which was long after him, and so kept secret your own
fond devise.

The Council of Carthage and also of Affrike was at that time, wherein the
Bishop of Rome by his Legates did claim the right of hearing of appeals,
from whom soever they were made, and for his purpose alleged a counterfeit
Canon of the Council of Nice. Wherefore it is most certain, that then the
Bishop of Rome began at the least to claim the super^oritie over all
Churches, and to take upon him as it were the name of universal Bishop: and
therefore this canon is made against him.

And that this is true, the Epistle of the Council of Affrike written to
Celestinus, then Bishop of Rome declares. For after that they have ^esyred
him that he would admit no such appeals, nor absolve such as they should
excominunicate, because that was to do against the decrees of the Council of
Nice, and to abridge them of their jurisdiction and liberty: they add and
say:

Both because this privilege has bin taken from the Church of Aphrike by no
constitution of the fathers, and also the decrees of the council of Nice has
committed both the inferior Clearkes and the Bishops themselves unto their
Metropolitanes: for it was discretely and rightly considered, that all matters
are to be determined in the places, where they began. and that no province can
lack the grace of the holy ghost, whereby the priest of Christ may be hable,
both wisely to see, and also constantly to mainteyn the right: especially for
that it is lawful, for every man that shall mislike the discretion of the
judges, to appeal either to particular councels within the same province, or
else to an universal council: unless perchance some man will think, that
God is able to inspire the trial of justice into one man alone, and will not
inspire the same into a great number of priests meeting together in Council.
And how may such beyond sea judgment be thought good, whereunto the persons
of the witnesses which in trial of truth are thought necessary either for that
they be women, or for the infirmity of their age, or for many other incident
letts, cannot be brought. Now that any should be sent abroad as it were from
your holiness side, we find it not decreed in any Council. And a little
after, And send you not any your Clerks hither to execute justice at any man's
request, least we seem to bring the smokie puff of the world into the Church
of Christ. etc.

Whereby it is plain, that they only prohibit that title of universality and
of general jurisdiction, that the Bishop of Rome now claymed and at that time
began to claim over all Churches, and not the names of superiority due unto
any in their own province. For that perogatiue of jurisdiction over. Bishops
and other ministers they acknowledge to be due to the Metropolitan, as it is
evident in the words of that same epistle, which I have recited.

Moreover it is manifest that this name Archbishop was then used, and after
that The name of Primate allowed in the Council of Carthage. M. Fox.
time continued and not disalowed by any, as it may appear by that which has
bin hitherto written. And this name Primate (which is as hautie as the name of
Archbishop) is allowed even in that council of Carthage, as may appear in
the. 13. 17. and. 23. canons, as it is in the Greek copye. Wherefore in my
opinion M. Fox does aptly decide this controversy, in that learned treatise
of his first tome, where he speaking of this same Council and of this Canon
which you have recited, (for I suppose you did borrow it there) signifies in
effect that neither the name of Primate, Archbishop or Metropolitan, is by
that Canon prohibited, but rather these ambitious titles of uniuersall Bishop,
prince of all priests, head of all priests, and such like. Which names seem
to derogate authority both of jurisdiction and office from all other priests,
and therefore alittle after he says. Thus then these titles above recited, as
Bishop, Metropolitan, Bishop of the first seat, Primate, Patriarch,
Archbishop, that is to mean, chief bishop or headbishop ^o other bishops of
his province, we deny not but were then in old time applied and might be
applied to the Bishop of Rome, like as the same also were applied to other
Patriarks in other chief cities and provinces. And in the same place, after he
^athe declared this title ( summus orbis Pontifex) as it is now used in Rome to
be unhard of in the primitive time of the Church, that is five hundred years
after Christ. He says the like is to be affirmed also of other presumptuous
titles of like ambition, as the head of the universal Church, the vicar of
Christ in earth, Prince of priests, with such like, which be all new found
terms. etc. so that it is plain, that these general titles of universal
jurisdiction over all, and not the particular names of superiority over
several Churches, is by this Council forbidden.

This farther appears in the fyfth Council of Constantinople where John not
Con. Const^n. ^ alias the. 2.
being content with the name of Patriarch of Constantinople would needs have
it ratifyed by the council that he should be called Oecumenicus Patriarcha,
that is universal Patriarch. Against which title not of Patriach but of
universal Patriarch, both Pelagius and Gregory at that time bishops of Rome,
the one succeeding the other, did earnestly write, and this is the true meaning
of that Canon.

Ignatius immediately after the Apostles time calls a Bishop principem
sacerdotum, Ignatius epist. ad Smirn. Ambros. in. 4. Ephesians.
the Prince of priests, or chief Priest: and so does Ambrose in the fourth ad
Ephesios. But this they do not attribute to any one as having universal
authority over all, but to every bishop in respect of such as be under him.

Touching the bishop of Constantinople, your are deceived very much, and
declare in him the same unskillfulness that you have done in the other. For it
is evident that he required this name and title of universal Patriarch
ambitiously as being desirous to be superior to all the Patriarchs in the
world. This to be true Distinct. 99.
is manifest by the decree of Pellagius Distinct. 99. Canon Nullus. And by the
Epistles of Gregory written purposely of that m^atter. Neither do I read in
any approved author to the contrary.

Again you are deceived greatly in the Council. For though the Bishop of
Constantinople did challenge in the Council of Chalcedon the right of ordering
Metropolitanes in those places, yet does he not in that Council challenge the
title of universal Patriarch, which notwithstanding was offered to the
Bishop of Rome in that Council of Chalcedon, but first given to the
Patriarch of Constantinople, in the second Council of Constantinople: or as
it is termed in the book of Con. tom. 2.
Councels, the fifte, because it was the fiftegenerall Council, as it may
appear in the same council. Moreover whereas you say, that the Bishop of
Constantinople required that he might ordeyne Bishops in Asia. etc. if you
mark the words diligently, you shall perceive that he re quired therein nothing
but according to the sixth Canon of the Council of Nice, which is also there
alleged for that purpose: but I have showed before how the Bishop of Rome made
this challenge of universality in effect, and indeed, even in that Council of
Carthage, where this Canon by you alleged is, and therefore I need not stand
any longer upon this point.

Damasus calls Stephen an Archdeacon. Archdeacons


Hierome in his epistle ad Euagrium has this name Archdeacon.

Sextus in his decrees says that Laurence the Martyr was an Archdeacon.

Sozomenus lib. 7. cap. 19. makes mention of an Archdeacon reading the
scriptures.

Socrates in the seventh book of his ecclesiastical history speaks of one
Timothy an Archdeacon.

T. C. Page 72. Sect. 5. 6. 7.
For to prove ye lawfulness of the name of an Archdeacon, the antiquity, the
necessity of it, the testimonies of (a) four are brought, which neither

I doubt not therefore that this is but a forger upon whom you would father
the Archdeacon: For that Damasus in whose place you put this forger lived Anno.

which are fathered of him do pretend. And if this be enough to prove

Sozomene, Socrates. etc. monks almost in every page, and hereupon it is more
lawful for me to conclude, that monks, subdeacons, exorcists, acoluthes,
ostiarij, lectores, are necessary ecclesiastical orders in the Church, as you
conclude the necessity of the Archdeacon.

I perceive you care not whether the Archdeacon fall or no, that you bestow so
little cost of him, and leave him so nakedly. And if I would be but half so
bold in What have you else but co^iectures?
comectures and diuinations as you are, I could say that this slight handling
of the Archdeacon, and sweating so much about the Archbishop, is there upon,
that you would be loath to come from being Deane to be an Archdeacon, and you
live in some hope of being Archbishop: but I will not enter so far: and
surely for any thing that I see, you might have trussed up the Archbishop as
short as you do the Archdeacon, for they stand upon one pin, and those
reasons which establish the one establish the other. Whereupon also comes to
pass that all those reasons which were before alleged against the Archbishop,
may be drawn against the Archdeacon.

Io. Whitgifte. The untoward dealing of the replier, and his vnsufficie^t
answer.

My purpose in that place is (as you might have seen if you would) to prove
that the names of Archbyshops Archdeacon. etc. be not Antichristian names, that
is, names invented by Antichriste, but most ancient, for those be my very
words, and as I have proved that to be most true in Metrapolitanes and
Archbyshops, by showing that they were in the Church, before the Pope was
Antichrist, so I do the like of Archdeacons. And where I have brought in five
witnesses, you say I have brought in four. Damasus, Hierome, Sixtus, Sozomene
and Socrates be in number five, and of these five you have answered only two,
and that after your usual manner, by rejecting the Authors. What is falsely
attributed to Damasus in other matters is no answer to this, that he reports
of Archdeacons, which also the third Centurie alleges as true. And though he
were Bishop of Rome, yet was he a virtuous, learned, and godly Bishop. So was
Sixtus in like manner, who lived Bishop of Rome Anno. 265. So that Damasus was
neither the first nor the best. For Sixtus was martyred for the Gospel, so was
not Damasus. They speak as much for Archdeacons as I require, that is that
their names were not invented by Antichrist: and if there were then no such
tyranny in the Church of Rome, as you here mislike, and yet this name in that
Church, it is not like to be a tyrannical name.

But I marvel you will deal so barely in this matter, knewing that Hierome,
who lived in Damasus his time, has this name Archdeacon oftener than twice or
thrice. Without doubt you do not well consider what you write.

This Answer of yours was never as yet approved of any learned man. For what if
Eusebius make mention of Subdeacons, Acoluthes. etc. which were peradventure
profitable offices in the Church at that time, does it therefore follow that it
is unlawful to have Archdeacons? I conclude no necessity of the Archdeacon,
but I conclude his antiquity, and because you cannot answer that, you fall to
scoffing and unseemly jesting as your manner is, and so do you shift off three
of my witnesses.

Having therefore before proved the unlawfulness of them, I will here set
down the difference between those Archdeacons that were in times past, and
those which are now, whereby it may appear they are nothing like but in name.

They were no ministers as appears in Untruth, no such thing appears.
Sozomene, ours are.

Io. Whitgifte.
What one reason have you used to prove the unlawfulness of them. If you mean
such reasons as you have against Archbyshops, they be fully answered.

Not one word is there in the seventh book and nineteenth Chapter of Sozomene
to prove that Archdeacons either then were not, or now may not be ministers.
For all that he speaks in that chapter is this. And this also is a strange
thing in the Church of Alexandria, whiles the Gospells are a reading, the
Bishop does not rise up, which I have hard of others. This holy book a Monk
that is an Archdeacon reads there, in other places Deacons: in many Churches
the priests only: but in principal feasts Bishops. How you can conclude that
Archdeacons were not then ministers by any thing here spoken, surely I know
not, for if you mean, because he says that in some churches only Priests did
read, you can no more thereof conclude that Archdeacons were then no Priests,
than you may that they were no Deacons, or that Bishops be no Priests, neither
is it necessary that they should be now ministers, it is sufficient if they
be Deacons: yet may they be ministers and meet it is that they should so be,
and you cannot prove the contrary.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no other words in that book and chap. of Sozomene touching
Archdeacons, than these which I have before recited: what they make for your
purpose let the reader judge. Your Vrbanum Concilium is very obscure, for there
is none such to be found in all the volumes of Councels. But to put you out of
doubt, we have no Archdeacons, but such as be tied to one Church, though they
have the names sometimes of the Shire, wherein their jurisdiction lies.

They were chosen by all the deacons of the Church where they be Archdeacons,

Io. Whitgifte.
There can be no such custom gathered of Hieroms words in that place, only he
using an example to declare what the manner of choosing their Bishop was in the
Church of Alexandria says, that they elected one from among themselves whom
they placing in an higher room called him a Bishop, as if the soldiers should
choose their captain, or Deacons should choose one of them whom they know to
be painful, and name him archdeacon. You can no more hereof conclude, that it
was then usual for deacons to choose their Archdeacon, than you may that it
was also usual for soldiers to choose their captain: neither can you here by
prove that our Archdeacons are not like unto theirs (if this were true) no more
than you can, that our Captains are not like unto theirs, because the
Soldiers do not choose them. But what create matter is it, if they were then
chosen by Deacons and be not so now? and does not the Bishop appoint them and
is not the Bishop more than a Deacon?

They were subject to the minister of the word, ours are above them, and rule

Io. Whitgifte.
There is not one word of Archdeacons in the fourtaenth Canon of the Council

reader. That which is in that place is spoken of Deacons only, and is at this
day observed in this Church.

It was counted to them great arrogancy if they preferred themselves to any
minister or elder of the Church: ours will not take the best ministers of the
Church as their equals. If therefore Archdeacons will have any benefit by the
Archdeacons of old time, it is meet they should content themselves with that
place which they were in.

Io. Whitgifte.
No such thing is in that epistle of Hierome: only he speaks of deacons,
touching that matter, whom he also she weth in the Church of Rome to have bin
in certain points preferred before ministers, neither is there one word of
Archdeacons in that book of Augustines, but only of Deacons. You must learn
to make a distinction betwixt an Archdeacon and a Deacon, and not to make the
reader believe that the authors you quote in the margente, speak of
Archdeacons, when they only speak of Deacons. My witnesses how few so ever
they be, are sufficient to withstand this cowardly assault of yours, wherein
there is neither strength nor truth.

Augustine in his first book de moribus ecclesiae Catholicae, makes mention
of Deanes.
Deanes, and their offices.

T. C. Page 73. Sect. 6.
As for the office of a deane, as it is used with us it is therefore Untruths.
unlawful, for that he being minister, has Untruths.
noseuerall charge or Congregation appointed wherein he may exercise his
ministry, and Untruths.
for that he is ruler and as it were master of diverse other ministers in his
College, which likewise have no several charges of congregatio^s, and for
that (which is most intolerable) both he himself oftentimes having a several
Church or benefice (as they call it,) is under the color of his deaneship
absent from his Church, and suffers also those that are underneath him, to be
likewise absent from their Churches. And whereas M. Doctor alleges S.
Augustine to prove this office to be ancient: indeed the name is there found,
but besides the name, not one property of that deane which we have. For
Augustine speaking of the monks of those days, says that the money which
they gate with the labor of their hands, they gave to their deane, which did
provide them meat and drink and cloth and all things necessary for them: So
that their monks should not be drawn away from their studies and
meditations, through the care of worldly things: So that this Deane which he
speaks of, was servant and steward and cater to the Monks, and therefore
only called Deane, because he was steward and cater to ten Monks. Now let it be
seen what Augustines deane makes for the deane which is theirs, and what
faith and trust M. Doctor uses, in reciting of the old fathers.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is but your own sansies taken for principles and grounds. For
first it is untrue that every Minister must of necessity have some several
Tractat. 4.
charge, as I have declared before. Secondly it is as untrue, that a Deane
has no several charge or congregation, wherein to exercise his ministry.
For there is no Cathedral Church without a congregation and charge. The
third that follows, is builded of the same grounds that these two first be,
and may as well be spoken against the masterships of such Colleges in the
universities, wherein any preachers or ministers be maynteyned. Which argues
that you mean the same to Colleges that you do to Cathedral Churches, and
that you would have ministers free from subjection. Last of all, that which
you say is most intellerable, you speak without any tolerable reason: For
Master Deane and his Prebendaries do more good both in the Church of England
generally, and in their several Churches particularly, and take more pains in
one month, than you and your companions (whereof some notwithstanding are
content without doing any duty at all, to enjoy prebendes more than one) in
one whole year. And if either Master Deane or the Prebendaries neglect their
duties, there be superiors and laws to reform them.

The place of Augustine proves the name of a Deane: it proves a College and
society, whereof he is Deane: it argues a superiority and gouernmente, for
he says they be called Decani, ideo quod sint denis praepositi, Deanes,
because they are set over ten: it shows an office to care and provide for
them, and see that they have all things necessary: it declares daily exercise
of praying and teaching: for he adds thus. Conueniunt autem diei tempore
extremo de suis quisque habitaculis, dum adhuc ieiuni sunt, ad audiendum illum
patrem, and conueniunt ad singulos patres terna ad minimum hominum milia: Nam
etiam multo numerosiores sub vno agunt. They come together at night every man
from his lodging whilst yet they are fasting, to hear that father: and they
Aug. de moribus ecclesiae.
come together to every father, three thousand men at the least, for a great
meanie more live under one. etc.

Now sir if God of his singular goodness has to the great and unspeakable
benefyte of his Church, moved the hearts of princes and men of wealth, so to
indue such places with possessions and revenues, that they having things
necessary provided for them, may bestow that time in studying, praying,
preaching, and other godly exercises, which these that Saint Augustine
speaks of, did in laboring with their hands, is Master Deanes name or
office ever the worse? howsoever it pleases you to term these companies,
that Saint Augustine here speaks of: Yet were they Godly societies, and do
very aptly set forth the utility, and the antiquity of Churches and
Colleges: the Deanes and Masters whereof, have indeed the chief and special
care of all external things perteyning to them, whether it be lands,
provisions, or any thing else that is necessary: And therefore the liker to
Saint Augustines Deane, and the place more aptly alleged to prove the
antiquity of this name and office. If Master Doctor should use no more faith
in reciting the Doctors than you do, I would he were whipped at the cross in
Cheap.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 67. Sect. 4.
Nytherto Antichrist had not invaded the Church of Rome. But what should I
trouble you with any more authorities? those that be learned may easily
understand that these names Metropolitan, Archbishop, Archdeacon, Primate,
Patriarch, and such like, be most ancient and approved of the eldest, best,
and worthyest Counsels, fathers, and writers.

T. C. Page 73. Sect. 7.
And unto the end that these testimonies might be more autenticall, and have
some waighte in them, Master Doctor adds, that hitherto Antichrist had not
invaded the seat of Rome. You shall have much a do to prove that Antichrist
had not invaded the sce of Rome, when your Clement Anaclete, Anicete, and
Damasus wrote: nay it is most certain, that then he had possessed it: but what
is that to the purpose, although there was no one singular head appeared or
lifted up, yet corruption of doctrine and of the sacraments, hurtful
ceremonies, dominion and pomp of ye Clergy, new orders, and functions of ye
ministry, which were the hands that pulled him, ye feet which brought him,
the shoulders that lifted and heaued him up into that seat, were in the Church.
Neither while you do thus speak, do you seem to remember, that this monster
needed not nine months, but almost nine hundred years, to be framed and
fashioned, or ever he could with all his parts be brought to light. And
although the lover of this Antichristian building were not set up: yet the
foundations thereof being secretly and under the ground laid in the Apostles
time: you might easily know that in those times that you spoke of, ye building
was wonderfully advanced and grown very high, and being a very dangerous
thing to ground any order or policy of the Church upon men at all, which in
deed ought to have their standing upon the doctrine and orders of the
Apostles, I will show, what great injury M. Doctor does, to send us for our
examples and patterns of government to these times which he does dicette us
unto.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words, the same might be also spoken of the Apostles times. For
Antichrist began in the Apostles tunes 2 Thessalonians. 2. 1. Io. 2.
enen then Paul speaking of Antichrist said, Nam mysterium nuncagit
iniquitatis, for the mystery of iniquity does already work: And S. John said
that there then began to be many Antichrists: but does this detract any thing
from the truth taught in that time? or shall we therefore refuse to take such
examples of it, as is convenient for our time? There is no man of learning and
modesty which will without manifest proof condemn any order, especially
touching the government of the Church, that was used and allowed during the
time of the primitive Church, which was the next. 500. years after Christ,
within the which time, most of my authorities are contained. Neither was there
any function or office brought into the Church during all that time, allowed by
any general Council or credible writer, which was not most meet for that
time, and allowable by the word of God.

I grant that Antichrist was working all this time, and grew more and more,
for else could there never have been so many sects and heresies from time to
time spread in the Church, which was the cause of so many singular and notable
Councels, so many profitable and necessary books, written by such learned and
godly Doctors, as did with might and maine strive against them. Out of the
which Councels and fathers, and best witnesses what was done in those times, I
have fetched my proofs: even out of them (I say) that did with might and maine
labor to keep out Antichrist from the possession of the Church, and therefore
not to be suspected to consent to Antichrist.

I know that those sects and heresies gave strength unto Antichriste, and at
the length were one special means of placing him in his throne, even as I am
also persuaded Antichrist works in England by contentious persons.
that he works as effectually at this day by your styrres and contentions,
whereby he has and will more prevail against this Church of England, than by
any other means whatsoever. Therefore it behooves you to take heed, how you
divide the army of Christ, which should vnanimiter fight against that
Antichrist. As for us we must follow the examples of those good fathers, and
labor, accordingly to restore unity, and to preserve it.

Eusebius out of Egesippus writes, ye as long as the Apostles lived, ye Church
remained a pure virgin, for that if there were any that went about to corrupt
the holy rule that was preached, they Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 32.
did it in the dark, and as it were digging underneath the earth. But after
the death of the Apostles, and that generation was paste, which God vouchsaued
to hear the divine wisdom with their own ears, then the placing of wicked
error began to come into the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is evident in diverse places of the Scripture, namely in the first Epistle
to the Corruptions in the church in the Apostles time*
Corinthians, and the Epistle to the Galath, that there were many gross and
great corruptions openly professed in the Church, by diverse, not only in
manners, but also in doctrine, even in the Apostles time, and Eusebius himself
declares that there Eusebius. lib. 2. Cap. 13. Ide^. Lib. 3.
was one Simon mentioned Acts. 8. whom he calls the author of all heresy,
Lib. 2. Cap. 13. Likewise he shows Lib. 3. that Ebion, Cerinthus, and the
Nicholaites, all horrible heretics were in the Apostles time. Wherefore if
this be a good reason, then is it not safe for us to follow, no not the

Element also in a certain place, to confirm that there was corruption of

Io. Whitgifte.
I can find no such thing in Clement, but the matter is not great whether he
say so or no. The argument is stark naught: for if this follow, that we may
take no example, pattern, or testimony of government, out of that time,
because it was corrupt, then by the same reason must we not take examples of
any time, no not out of the Apostles time, because that was also corrupt as I
have said. Your arguments be passing strong, surely I marvel with what
boldness you write them.

leauyng the sacred function were degenerate to a secular rule or dominion,
whereupon we see, that it is safe for us to go to the Scriptures, and to the
Apostles times, for to fetch our government and order: and that it is very
dangerous to draw from those ryuers the fountaynes whereof, are troubled and
corrupted, especially when as the ways whereby they run are muddier and more
fennie, than is the head itself.

Io. Whitgifte.
You falsify the words of Socrates, for thus be says, For even till that
time the Nouatians flourished maruellously at Rome, and had many Churches and
had gathered Socra. lib. 7. Cap. 11.
much people. But envy took hold of them, when as the Byshopprike of Rome
and of Alexandria now a good while was passed beyond the Limits of
Priesthood to an outward Dominion. He says not leaving the sacred function,
were degenerate to a secular rule and dominion, as you translate it.

But why does Socrates burste out into this reprehension of them, even because
Socrates a favorer of ye Nouatians. Niceph. lib. 6. Cap. 37. and. lib. 9. 13.
they expelled the Nouatian heretics, of whom Socrates was a fautor, as it
may appear in Nicephorus, wherefore he dothein that place affectionately, and
unjustly reprove both the Bishop of Rome, and Alexandria, for stoutly resisting
those heretics and expelling them from their Churches, especially they now
increasing to so great a multitude, as it may seem by Socrates words they
did. And although the words of Socrates which I have already recyted
justify this to be true, yet does his words followyng declare the same more

Primate, Patriarch, be most ancient, and approved of the eldest, best,

If I were not acquainted with this spirit, it would make me muse at such
evident and manifest untruths, joined with so profane iestes and tauntes. If
I had alleged no more authorities but only the Council of Nice, it had been
sufficient to have disproued this so bold assertion of yours. But seeing I
have alleged other testimonies also, which evidently prove my purpose, I must
needs think you not to be a man that greatly cares for your own credit, but
if you think they are few, and therefore account them for none, I have now I
trust in this Chapter. 25. Division supplied their want, and made up the number.

What Scriptures I have appears afterward. It is sufficient if I find there
the office of an Archbishop, as I doubt not but I shall, and therefore I say

great penury of reading the ancient writers.

And for as much as the original and beginning of these names Metropolitan,
Archbishop, Archdeacon, Primate, Patriarch, and such like (such is their
antiquity) cannot be found so far as I have read, it is to be supposed they
have their original from the Apostles themselves. For as I remember S.
Augustine has this rule in his August*
118. Epist. ad Ianuar. Those things that be not expressed in the Scriptures
and yet by tradition observed of the whole Church, come either from the
Apostles or from general Councels, as the observing of Easter, the celebrating
of the day of the ascension, and of the coming of the holy Ghost, and such
like. Uery unlearned therefore and ignorant be those which so boldly affirm
that these names used in the purest time of the church, be Antichristian.

remembers, in the. 118. Epistle to January, that the original of them is from
the Apostles themselves.

Here This is from the matter.
M. Doctor seems to seek after some glory of a good memory, as though he
had net Augustine by him when he wrote this sentence, and yet he maruellously
forgets himself, for he used this place before in his. 23. Page, and cyteth
it there precisely and absolutely, where also I have showed, how unadvisedly
that sentence of Augustine is approved: and how that thereby a window is open
to bring in all Popery, and whatsoever other corrupt opinions. That the names
of Lords and honor as they are used in this Realm, are not meet to be given
to the Ministers of the Gospel, there has been spoken before.

Io. Whitgifte.
This place of Augustine is of greater force and credit with those that be
learned, than that it can be shifted off. I have answered whatsoever you say
against it in that place, and showed of what credit it is with some famous
writers of our time, namely with Master Zuinglius, Master Calvin, and Master
Gualter. And surely I think no learned man does dissent from them.

Your iestes are to usual and unseemly for a Divine, especially when you
abuse the scripture to make sport withal. I might have said also of you, yt you
sought after some glory of a good memory, when as you used the like kind of

As for Prelate of the Garter, if it be a needful office, there are inowe to
execute it besides the Ministers, which for as much as they be appointed to
watch over the souls of men, purchased with the blood of Christ, all men
understand that it is not meet that they should attend upon the body, much
less upon the leg, and least of al upon the Garter. It is not unlawful for
Princes to have Ministers of their honor, but also it is not lawful to take
those that God has appointed for another end, to use to such purposes.

Thou see here good reader that M. Doctor keeps his old wont, of Untruth.
manifest perverting of the words and meaning of the authors of the
Admonition. For whereas they say that the name of Earl, County Palatine,
Justice of peace and Quorum, Commissioner, are Antichristian, when they are
given to the ministers of the Church, whose calling will not agree with such
titles, he concludes simply, that they say they be altogether unlawful, and
simply antichristian, as if I should reason, that it is not meet that the
Queens Majesty should preach or minister the Sacraments, therefore it is
not meet that there should be any preaching or Ministering of the Sacraments.

Now letting pass all your hard words and unbrotherly speeches, with your
uncharitable prognostications, and cold prophesies, I will come to examine,
whether you have any better hap in proving the office, than you have had in
proving the name.

Io. Whitgifte.
I see no cause why he that is prelate of the garter, may not also
sufficiently discharge his duty in watching over the soul, for I think the
garter does not require such continual or great attendance. Those that are
appointed to watch over ye soul are not exempted from bodily service to their
Prince, except you will take from the Prince, not only authority in
Ecclesiastical matters, as you have done, but over Ecclesiastical persons
also, as by this and such other like assertions you seem to do* But here of
more in place. I pervert not the words of the Admonition, as appears by
their manifest words: what their meaning is God knows. But how little
authority these offices should have, if your plat form were framed, shall be
declared when I come to your seigniorie: neither the names nor offices that
come from a Christian Prince, that detesteth Antichrist, can be called
Antichristian, upon whom soever they be bestowed. Whereunto this your example
tends of the Queens Majesty, wise men may easily conjecture. It smells of
that Papisticall cauillation, Scilicet that we give to her Majesty authority
to preach and to administer the sacraments, because we acknowledge her lawful
authority in Ecclesiastical causes.

I pray God my prognostications be not to true: the more I consider of your
book, the more I am driven to suspect it. My hard speeches be within the
bonds of modesty, but yours may better beseem the order you talk of, then a
man of your profession.

You would speak as much of names of honor and reverence in other persons if

Now it follows to prove that the offices signified by these names are not

in the same continuance even to this day: as partlye if may be gathered by
that which I have spoken before, and most manifestly by all histories and
learned writers from before that Council of Nyce to this instant hour: and
therefore they little considered what they writ, when they set it down that
these names and offices were strange and unheard of in the Church of Christ.

These men contemning ancient writers never read them, and that is the cause
of such unlearned assertions.

T. C. Page 75. Sect. 1.
And whereas in the former treatise of the name of the Archbishop, he blew the
trumpet before the victory: here in this of the office he blows it before
he comes into the field, or strikes one stroke, saying that they little
consider what they write, that they are contemners of ancient writers and that
they never read them, and that they are unlearned which deny these things
which he affirms. Well what we read and how unlearned we are, is not the
matter which we strive for, the judgment thereof is first with God* then
with the Churches, and in their judgments we are content to rest. But if you
be so greatly learned, and we so unlearned and smally read, then the truth of
our cause shall more appear that is maynteined with so small learning and
reading, against men of such profound knowledge and great reading. And yet I
know not why if we be not tooidle, we should not be hable to read as much as
you, which may have leisure to read a good long writer, or ever you can ride
only to see and salute your houses and livings, being so many and so far
distant one from an other. And if we be so unlearned and hold such dangerous
opinions of Papistrie and anabaptisme, as you bear men in hand we do, why do
you not by the example of the Ministers in Germany, procure a public
disputation, where you may both win your spurs and such detestable
opinions with the ignorance of the authors, may be displayed unto the whole
world? But let us hear what is said.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have said nothing of the authors of the Admonition, which their own doings
proves not to be true, and if you will also take it unto your self, who can
let you. If notwithstanding al my iourneys to see and salute my houses and
lyuings, I be found to discharge my duty there, and also to have read as
much as you, that have such leisure, it is at the least an argument that I am
not idle. I love not to boast of my self. Your too too arrogante and
contemptuous speeches provoke me further than modesty requires. I am not
ashamed of my readyng, and yet I will make no comparisons.

says on this sort, Neque enim aliunde haereses obortae sunt, aut na ta

Priest for the time in the Church, and one Judge for the time in the stead of
Christ thought upon, to whom if the whole brotherhoode vvoulde be obedient,
according to Gods teaching, no man would move any thing against the College
of Priests.

Cornelius being Bishop of Rome, and having excommunicated Cyprian expounded.
certain notorious wicked men, and afterward being threatened and ill used at
their hands, began to faynte and to be weerie of his office: Cyprian hearing
thereof, wrote comfortably unto him, and willed him in any wise to proceed,
she wing further what sects and schisms ensues in any Province or Diocese,
whereas the Bishops authority is despised. For in these words he speaks not
of the usurped authority of the Bishop of Rome over all Churches, but against
the insolency of some, which despising their Metropolitan, or Archbishop,
did with their factiousnesse trouble the Church. For he would have an
Archbishop in every Province, which should bear the chief rule over the
rest of the Clergy, and so do the godlyest and best learned expound Cyprian.

The same Cyprian writing to one Florentius Pupianus, speaking Auhoritie of
Archbishops.
in his own behalf being Bishop of Carthage, says on this sort: Vnde
schismata and haereses obortae sunt and oriuntur, nisi dum Episcopus qui vnus
est, and ecclesiae praeest, superba quorundam praesumptione contemnitur, and
homo dignatione Dei honoratus, ab hominibus indignis iudicatur? From whence
have heresies and schisms sprung heretofore, and whereof spring they now,
but that the Bishop which is one, and governs the Church, by the
presumpiuous disdain of certain is despised, and a man preferred by Gods
allowance, is examined and judged by unworthy men. For it is the chief and
principal office of an Archbishop to keep unity in the Church to compounde
contentions, to redress heresies, schisms, factions, to see that Bishops, and
all other of the Clergy which be under him do their duty. etc.

T. C. Page 75. Sect. 2. 3.
Cyprian (says he) speaking of the office of an Archbishop. etc. This is
rather to make sport, than to confute
Unless (good Reader) thou will first believe that Cyprian speaks of an
Archbishop, and haste before concerned a strong imagination of it, M. Doctor
can prove nothing. Aristotle says* that vncumming paynters write the names of
the beasts which they paynt in their tables, for because otherwise it could
not be known what they paynt: So M. Doctor mistrusting that the Archbishop
will not be known by his description, writes first the name of that he will
paynt out.

This is it which we strive about, whereof the controversy is, and this M.
Doctor takes for granted. He accuses the authors of the Admonition for
faulting in the petition of the principle, or desiring to have that granted
which is denied, and yet I am sure that in the whole Admonition there is not
such a gross petition as this is. Where or in what words does S. Cyprian
speak of the office of an Archbishop?

Io. Whitgifte.
It is the chief and principal office of the Archbishop, to provide that
peace and The principal office of an archbishop.
unity be kept in the Church, to suppress schisms and heresies. etc. This
does Cyprian in this place signify in plain words.

That he means of an Archbishop and Metropolitan, though he express not the
name, it is evident by his words: for in the first place he speaks of
Cornelius, then Bishop of Rome, who had government over that whole Province.
And in the second place he speaks of him self, who had a very ample and
large jurisdiction. For being Cyprian a Metropolitan.
Bishop of Carthage, he had the charge and oversight of the Churches in
Affrike, in Numidia, and in both the Mauritanies, as he him self does
testify. lib. 4. Epist. 8* And as I have before showed out of Gregory
Nazianzene, he did not only rule the Church of Carthage, but also of Affrike,
of Spain, and almost of the whole East Cap. 2. diui. 25
parts: for the which cause Illyricus as I also said before, does call him
Metropolitan. And therefore I have truly affirmed, that in those places he
speaks of the office of a Metropolitan or Archbishop: neither is this a
petition of the principle: but a true principle: but it is strange to see how
you forget your self, for afterward in the. 95. page of your book, you
acknowledge that Cyprian was a Metropolitan Page 95. sec. 2.
Bishop, which sufficiently justifies my second place out of Cyprian.

And here by the way it is to be observed of the Reader, how near a kin
the pope and the Archbishop be. For this office is confirmed by the same Truly.
places that the Falsely.
popes is. The places and arguments which are brought against him are soluted
with the same solutions that they use which maynteyne the Papacy. For these
places of Cyprian be alleged for the popes supremacy, and In deed you know
this is untrue.
in deed they make as much for the pope as the Archbishop. For although they
be two heads, yet they stand upon one neck, and therefore the reformed
Churches which cut right did strike them both of at one blow.

Io. Whitgifte.
This argues either wilful ignorance, or professed malice: for you can not
but know that Cyprian means of the subjection that ought to be given to
Cornelius in his own Province, and that the Papists wrest the same to prove
his universal jurisdiction over all Christendom. Now if a man may not
allege that truly, according to the true sense and meaning of the author,
which the Papists abuse to serve their turn, then must we abstain from
alleging diverse places of the Scripture.

It is true that the Papists use this place for the Popes supremacy, but
falsely: for Cyprian only means of the superiority of a Metropolitan or
Bishop in his Province or Diocese. And the Papists them selves have given
over their hold, that they took of those places of Cyprian, confessing that
he meant of every several Bishop in his own Diocese or Province, as appears
in Dormans and Hardings latter books, and others. And is this kind of reason
so near a kin to the Papists, which utterly overthrows one of their
strongest arguments? Surely I marvel that your desire is so much to write
against the person, that in the mean time you neglect the common cause, and
give strength as much as lies in you to the reason of the adversary, whylest
you say, that this place makes as much for the Pope, as it does for the
Archbishop. But the truth of this your Reply shall appear, when I have
answered your other cauilles.

T. C. Page. 75. Sect. 3.
In neither of the sentences here alleged out of Cyprian, nor in all his
works as has bin before noted, is there one word of an Archbishop, and yet
M. Doctor says, that he speaks of an Archbishop: before he showed the name
without the office, and now he goes about to show the office without the name:
so that he can never make both the name and the office meet together. To shape
out an Archbishop here, you must needs interpret the words Bishop and priest,
Archbishop and high priest: for Cyprian makes mention of no other name of
ministry in those places, and if you may have this scope of interpreting, it
will not be hard for you to prove that stones be bread, and that chalk is
cheese.

Io. Whitgifte.
Epiphanius lib. 2 tom. 2. haer. 69. does call the Bishop of Alexandria
sometime Bishop, Epiphanius. Council. Calc.
and sometime Archbishop. The Council of Calceden in like manner calls the
same men, as Flauianus, Dioscorus, Leo, and other, sometimes Bishops, and
sometimes Archebishops: the like is to be seen in other authors and writers.
So that the omitting of the title is no reason at all to disprove the thing. It
is certain that in Cyprians time, this name Papa was a common name to many
Bishops, those especially that were of fame, as M. Fox at large declares,
tom. 1. fol. 11. And yet does not Cyprian use that title commonly when he
writes to Cornelius, or to any other Bishop. This therefore is but a feeble
argument.

Chap. 3. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page. 75. Sect. 3.
Let us see what is a Bishop or Priest, I use the name of priest against my
will, but because it is sacerdos, and you so translate it, that it may better
be understood what I answer to you, I am content to follow you so far. I
say, let us consider what is a Bishop or priest by S. Ciprian, and thereby we
shall know what an Archbishop he sets forth unto us, which thing may
appear manyfestly, by that which he says in the same Epistle, that the Bishop
that is appointed into the place of him that is dead, is chosen peaceably, by
the voyee of all the people. A cavil.
I think you will not say, that all the people throughout the whole Province,
or throughout a whole Diocese (as we count a Diocese) met together, for that
had bin both a great disorder and confusion, a great charge to the Church, and
in the time of persecution as that was, to have offered the whole Church in all
the province into the mouth of the wolf.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you had read Ecclesiastical histories, then should you understand that
the Metropolitanes and Bishops of every Province and Diocese, were chosen in
the presence of the people of that place and city, whereof they had their
names, and that the consent of no other of the people in that Province or
Diocese was required. So Cyprian himself, though he had so ample a charge as
I have showed before: yet was he chosen only by the people of Carthage. The
same is to be seen also in other such elections: and especially of the Bishop
of Rome, after that he was in his greatest glory, and therefore this is a
poor argument. The Bishop of Rome or of Carthage were chosen by the consent of
the Citizens only, and not of the people in other places of the Province, Ergo
their authority and jurisdiction extended no farther than these Cities: and
yet the whole Diocese, that is, the Christians in the Diocese (such I mean
as were appointed for that purpose) might have met in that time without
peril, or any other such inconvenience as you speak of, for such a purpose,
as well as they did in the same time to Synodes, which were frequent both in
Cyprians time, and before.

Chap. 3. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page 75. Sect. vlt.
And least peradventure you should have this hole to hide your self in, saying
that it might be procured, that in every Church or parish throughout either the
Province or Diocesie, the consent of the people might be asked, and they tarry
in their places where they dwell, Cyprian in the next Epistle does put the
matter out of all question, saying that the priest (whom he after calls
Bishop) is chosen in the presence of the people, and in the eyes of all. So
that Cyprians Bishop whom you will needs have an Archbishop, had neither
province nor dioces, as we call a dioces, out only a Church orcongregatio^, such
as the ministers and pastors with us, which are appointed unto several towns:
which may further appear in that Cyprian says, that out of Untruth, for
Cyprian names not a Province.
one province there were. 90. Bishops which condemned Priuatus. Now if there
were. 90. Bishops in one province met, and yet not all that were in that
province (as may appear out of the same Epistle) all men do understand, that
the scope that Cyprians Bishop or Archbishop, as you will have him, had, was no
such thing as a Dioces or a province. I could bring infinite testimonies out
of Cyprian to prove that the Bishop in his time was nothing else but S. Paul's
Bishop, that is, one that had cure and charge of one flock, which was so
placed as it might be taught of him, and ouerseene by him, and governed by him,
and of whom in matters perteyning to God it might depend.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your proofs go very low when you use such slender ones: the words of
Cyprian in that Epistle be these: Quod and ipsum videmus de diuina authoritate
descendere vt 1. Lib. Epi. 4.
sacerdos, plebe praesente, sub omnium oculis delegatur. etc. The which thing
we see to discende from the authority of God, that the Priest be chosen the
people being present before them all. etc. What can you else gather of this,
but that a Priest must be chosen in presence of the people, and that then he is
said to be chosen sub omnium oculis, before al their eyes, when he is chosen
publicly, and openly in the sight of many. But what is this to the
strayghtning of his charge? A man might as well reason thus: All the Citizens
of Rome were not at Cornelius election, therefore he is not Bishop of all the
City of Rome. But to the end that you may understand, the vanity of this
your assertion, and that it may appear that Cyprian makes the Bishop in
degree to be above a Priest, and also that at the election of the Bishop of
Rome, more were present than those of the City: I will set down his words as
they be. Lib. 4. Epist. 2. Cypr. lib. 4. Epist. 2.
I come now unto the person of our fellow Cornelius, that you may more truly
know him, as well as we, not by the lies of malicious men and backbyters, but

fellow Bishops, the whole All the Bishops agreed to Cornelius his election.
number whereof through all the world did jointly agree. For (which thing did
greatly commend our well-beloved Cornelius unto God, and to Christ, and his

by all degrees of religion. Then afterward he neither desired nor would have
the Bishopric it self, neither as others use which are puffed up with pride
and arrogancy, did he invade the Sea by force: but being quiet and modest,
and such a one as they use to be which are chosen unto this place by God, for
the moderation of his chaste conscience, and the humbleness of his natural

he might be made Bishop, but suffered violence, that he might by Cornelius

compulsion be driven to receive the Bishopric. And he was made Bishop of
many of our fellow Bishops, which were then at Rome, and which sent very
honorable and commendable letters unto us of his ordination. But Cornelius was
made Bishop by the judgment of God, and his Christ, by the testimony almost
of all Clearks, by the suffrages of the people which was then present, and by
the College of the ancient Priests, and of good men.

In these words first it is to be noted that he says Cornelius was made
Bishop Collections out of Cyprian.
by the testimony of his fellow Bishops: Quorum numerus vniuersus per totum
mundum concordi vnanimitate consensit, The whole number whereof through all the
world did jointly agree* Secondly that he was promoted to the high dignity
of Priesthood, per omnia ecclesiastica officia and cunctis religionis
gradibus: Through all ecclesiastical offices* and by all degrees of religion,
and then afterward was made Bishop. Thirdly, that Cornelius was made Bishop by
the judgment of God and Christ, by the testimony almost of all Clearkes, and
by the suffrages of the people, which was then present, and by the College of
ancient Priests, and good men. How far these things differ from your
collections, and how far from Cyprians meaning you gather your conjectures,
let the Reader judge. I have before sufficiently proved by ancient
testimonies, that the Bishop of Rome, Carthage, and other, had not one City
only to govern, or one parish, but diverse places, whole Provinces and
Countries, as Cyprians own words before rehearsed makes manifest. Wherefore
all this you do but speak of pleasure.

If you had told me in what place Cyprian says, that out of one Province
there was 90. Bishops that condemned Priuatus, I would have said something to
it: but seeing you have kept the place secret to your self, you give your
Reader occasion to suspecte, either that it is forged, or else not faithfully
alleged. If it be that which is lib. 1. epist. 3. then truly antiquum
obtines. For these be Cyprians words: Per Foelicianu^ Cypr. lib. 1. Epist. 3.

and being also most sharply reprehended by the letters of my predecessors
Fabianus and Donatus (as your conscience knows.)

Here is not one word of so many Bishops being in one Province, neither yet
any Province or Diocese mentioned wherein they should be. Surely this is too
much, so often to offend in falsifying: but be it there were so many Bishops in
one province, what conclude you thereof, that Bishops then had but one town or
parish limited unto them? As though there be not Provinces of that largeness
that they may conteyne so many Bishops, and yet the several parishes furnished
with peculiar pastors. Massaeus lib. 16. says, that there are. 160.
Bishoprics subject to the Patriarche of Antioche.

But there can no such thing as you affirm be gathered of Cyprians words,
neither shall you ever be able to prove out of Cyprian, or any other ancient
writer, that such Bishops as Cyprian and Cornelius were, had only government
of one town, or as we call it, parish: but the contrary is most evident, as
I have before declared.

Chap. 3. the. 7. Division.

Furthermore, to shape the Archbishop by these places of Cyprian, you must be
driven to expound this word (Church) Province. The Papists which cite this
place for the Pope as you do for the Archbishop, they expound the word
Church here to be the whole Church universal and Catholic. And in deed
although it be falsely expounded so in this place, yet may they do it with
more probability and likelyhoode, than to expound it a Province, for so much
as these words (the Church) is oftener read both in the Scripture, and old
writers, to signify the whole Church, than any province of one Realm: but
let Cyprian expound him self what he means by a Church here, although
that may easily appear by that which is spoken of S. Cyprian his Bishop,
whereas Cyprian declares that Cornelius the Bishop of the Church which was in
Rome, would not let Felicissimum a Nouatian heretic, being cast out by the
Bishops of Affrike, to enter into the Church, he declares sufficiently that
he means that company of the faithful which were gathered together at Rome,
to hear the word, and to communicate at the sacraments. A cavil*
For it was not Cornelius part to shut him out of the Province, neither in
deed could he himself, being not able without hazard by reason of the
persecution that then was, to tarry in any part of the province. Again speaking
against ye Nouatian heretic, he shows that through his wicked opinion of
denying of repentance to those that were fallen, the confession of faults in
the Church was hindered. Now it is manifest that confession was not made
throughout the province, but in that particular Church, where the party dwelte
that committed the fault. Therefore Cyprian understands by the name of the
Church, neither Dioces, as we call Dioces, and much less a whole province.
And in the same Epistle, speaking of those which had fallen, he says, that
they durst not come so much as to the thresholde or entry of the Church, where
he also opposes the Church to the Province, saying that they roue about the
Province, and run about to deceive the brethren.

Io. Whitgifte.
I expound this word (Church) in this place no otherwise than al learned
writers expound it, that is, for that province and diocese whereof Cornelius
was Bishop, and it is no unaccustomed thing, to call the Church which is
extended through a province, by the name of the chief City or Metropolitan
seat of the Province, as the Church of Rome all that that is subject to the
Bishop of Rome: the Church of Carthage, all that that is belonging to the
Bishop of Carthage. And this is truly to expound the places of Cyprian, and
may be justified both by examples and authorities, as I have proved before,
whereas your interpretation has no shadow or show of truth. But you had rather
justify the Papists interpretation, than seem to relent to the The zeal of
the Replier.
authority of an Archbishop. Such is your zeal.

Cyprians words touching Cornelius dealing with Felicissimus the Nouatian, be
these: Likewise that thou might know of Felicissimus the author of the
sedition: Lib. 1. Epist. 3.
who also is contained in the letters of our fellow Bishops, written of late
unto them, which Felicissimus is not only driven from hence by them, Sed abs
te illic nuper de ecclesia nullus est: but is there of late expelled by thee
out of the Church. Of these words you gather this argument: Cyprian
signifies that Cornelius had banished Felicissimus from the Church of Rome:
Ergo, Cornelius was Bishop but of one Parish or City, or therefore a Church
in that place signifies one only particular congregation gathered together in
one Town. What kind of conjectures call you these? And what though Cornelius
could not shut him out of the Province? might he not therefore by
excommunication seclude him from the congregation of the faithful throughout
the Province: Do you think that he forceably shut him out of the local
Church of Rome, or rather dealte with him according to the ecclesiastical
Censures? You may delude simple readers that believe whatsoever you say, but
such as be able to examine your doings, can not (if they will search) but
find passing forgerie.

Again you say, speaking against the Nouatian heretics. etc. Cyprians words
touching that matter be these: Quibus etiam non satis fuit ab Euangelio
recessisse, spem lapsis Ibidem.
satisfactionis and poenitentiae sustulisse, fraudibus inuolutos vel adulterijs
commaculatos, and sacrificiorum funesta contagione pollutos, ne Deum rogarent,
ne in ecclesia exomologesiu criminum facerent, The Nouatian heresy.
ab omni sensu and fructu remouisse: To whom it was not inoughe to have
departed from the Gospel, to have taken away hope and satisfaction, and
repentance from those that have fallen, to have removed from all feeling and
fruit of repentance those that are taken in snares, or defiled with
adulteries, or polluted with the deadly contagion of sacrifices, that they
should not pray to God, nor make confession of their sins in the
congregation. What does Cyprian else mean by these words, but that Nouatus
denied repentance to such as were fallen, and would not receive them agayns
into the Church, that is, not this or that parish, but the Church of Christ,
the congregation of the faithful, for that was Nouatus herefie, negare veniam
lapsis, to deny forgiveness to those that fell. And therefore also he denied
unto them the fruits of repentance, as confession of their offenses in the
congregation of the faithful. etc. For Nouatus opinion was not that such
should only be secluded from this or that congregation, but generally from
the Church of Christ, and hope of salvation: And therefore in that place of
Cyprian is meant that Church, extra quam non est salus, without the which there
is no salvation.

And to what purpose do you proceed and go on forward, saying: That in the
same Epistle, speaking of those that had fallen. etc. What proves it? but that
those heretics had cast them into such a despair of forgiveness, that they
durst not offer them selves to be received into the Church, that is, to
repentance? And that the same Heretics being them selves excommunicated,
wandered up and down, sowing the pestilent seed of their doctrine. This is to
oppose Heretics and Schismatikes, (which run up and down in corners) to
the true members of the Church. But it is not to oppose the Church to the
Province. For the Province (if it be Chrystened) is the Church, although it
conteyne in it several congregations, which be also Churches, and yet being
members of it, are subject to one Bishop, and so does the whole Epistle of
Cyprian declare, neither can there anything be gathered out of it to the
contrary: for a testimony whereof I call to witness these your weak
collections, which you would not have used, if you could have found any better.

Chap. 3. the. 8. Division.

Seeing therefore A weak con clusion of false principles.
the Bishop which Cyprian speaks of, is nothing else but such as we call
pastor, or as the common name with us is parson: and his Church whereof he is
a Bishop, is neither dioces nor province* but a congregation which meet
together in one place, and to be taught of one man, what should M. Doctor mean
to put on this great name of Archbishop upon so small a Bishopric? as it were
Saules great harness upon David his little body, or as if a man should set a
wide huge porche before a little house.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where the premises be naught, how should the conclusion be good? I would to
God your argument were in his right form, that we might see upon what
substantial posts your conclusion does stand. But let the Reader consider
your grounds which I have opened before.

I might here tell you again that Cyprian in plain and manifest words, Lib.
4. Epist. 1. does make a Bishop superior in degree to him that you call
pastor: his words I have repeated before. I might also put you in mind of
Cyprians jurisdiction over the churches of Carthage, Numidia, and Mauritanie,
according to his own testimony. lib. 4. Epi. 8. in which respect Illyricus
does call him Metropolitan: Likewise I might tell you that the most writers
of that age, as Tertullian de Coro. militis, and de Fuga in pers. Origin hom.
2. in Numer. and. 11. in Hierem. do make three degrees of Ministers: Deacons,
Priests, and Bishops. To be short, I could bid you look Eusebius. lib. 6. cap.
1. and you should sinde that Demetrius, who lived Anno. 191. was Bishop
Paroeciaru^ Alexandriae and Aegypti, of the parishes of Alexandria and Egypt,
and refer you to many such examples used before, which utterly overthrow
this conclusion, and even hiss it out of the doors.

Chap. 3. the. 9 Division.
T. C. Page 76. Sect. 3.
And least that M. Doctor should say, that notwithstanding the Bishops had
but several churches: yet one of them might have either a title more excellent
than the rest, or authority and government over the rest: that shall likewise
be considered out of Cyprian. And first for the title and honor of archbishop,
it appears how Cyprian held that as a proud name, for he obiecteth to
Florentius as a presumptuous thing: for that in believing certain evil
reports of him, and misiudging ^. 4. ^p. 9
of him, he did appoint himself Bishop of a Bishop, and judge over him which
was for the time appointed of God to be judge.

Io. Whitgifte.
Pupianus to whom Cyprian wrote that Epistle, had greatly misused Cyprian, in
believing certain false rumors and reports of him, and upon the same giving
sentence against him: for this cause Cyprian reproves Pupianus, saying: Quis
autem nostrum Ionge est ab bumilitate, vt^umne ego, qui quotidie fratribus
seruio, and venientes ad ecclesiam singulos benign, and cu^ voto and gaudio
suscipio: an tu qui te Episcopu^ Episcopi, and iudice^ iudicis ad te^pus a Deo
dati constituis, etc. Whether of us is further from humility, I which serve
my brethren daily, and receive every one that comes unto the Church ge^tly,
and with desire and joy, or thou which make thy self the Bishop of the
Bishop, and the judge of the judge, given of God for the time. It appears
rather in these words, that Florentius is reproved for taking upon him to judge
Cyprian, to who^ he ought obedience: so that this place does not deregate any
thing from any lawful authority, that one Bishop has over another, but it
condemns the rash and presumptuous judgment of those, that will take upon
them rashly to give sentence of their superiors and betters, as Pupianus did.
For in that he finds fault with him, for making himself (as it were) Bishop
of the Bishop, and judge of the judge, he plainly declares, that he himself
was both Bshop and judge of Pupianus: neither does he object this to Pupianus
as a proud name, but as a proud deed.

Chap. 3. the. 10. Division.
T. C. Page 76. Sect. 4.
And herein also I may use the same reasons, which the godly writers of our
time use against the Pope, to prove that he had no superiority in those days
over other Bishops, for that the other Bishops called him brother, and he them,
called him fellow Bishop, and he them. For so does Cyprian call the Bishops of
that province in his Epistle, his fellow Bishops, and in diverse places his
brethren. And in the sentence which he spoke in the Council of Carthage, he
says, none of us does take him self to be Bishop of Bishops.

Io. Whitgifte.
Every Bishop was chief in his own Province, and not subject to any. The
Bishop of Rome had no jurisdiction over the Bishop of Carthage, but they were
of equal power and authority, as others were also of the like seats. In that
Cyprian called the Bishops of his province, fellow Bishops and brethren, he
declared that the function and ministry was all one: he like wise uttered his
humble mind and spirit. But this proves not that he had no superiority over
them. S. Peter in his first Epist. chap. 5. 1. Pet. cap. 5.
calls himself fellow minister with those whom he then exhorted, which were
all pastors, and such as were ministers of the word, and yet you acknowledge
an Apostle to be the highest in the Church, and above all the other degrees
mentioned ad Ephe. 4.

Cyprians words in the Council of Carthage, I have spoken of in another place:
he means the title of universal Bishop, and such as seek tyrannically and
unlawfully to rule, and especially such as will of necessity bind all other
men to their opinions in all things, for his words be: Tyrannico terrore ad
obsequendi necessitatem collegas suos adigat: None of us enforces his fellows
by tyrannical fear to the necessity of obeying.

Chap. 3. the. 11. Division.
T. C. Page. 77. Sect. 1.
Now, that there was no authority of one Bishop over an other, and that there
was none such as when controversies rose, took upon him the compounding of
them, or any one, to whom it apperteyned, to see the unity of the Church kept,
and to see that all other Bishops and the Clergy did their duty, as M.
Doctor bears us in hand, it may clearly be seen in diverse places of
Cyprian, and first of all in that sentence which he spoke in the Council of
Carthage, where he proceeds further after this sort, that none of them did
by any tyrannical fear bind his fellows in office, or any fellow Bishops,
to any necessity of obedience, seeing that every Bishop has for his free
liberty and power his own judgment, and discretion, as one which can not be
judged of an other, as he also him self can not judge an other, but says he,
we ought to tarry and wait for the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
only and alone has power to fet us over his Church, and to judge of our doing.
And in the same Epistle, wherout the first place is taken by M. Doctor he
says, that unto every one a portion of the flock is appointed, which every
one must rule and govern, as he that shall render an account of his deed unto
the Lord. And in an other place he says: Li. 2^ ep. 1.
we do not use any compulsion or violence over any, nor appoint no law to
any, seeing that every one that is set over the Church, has in the government
the free disposition of his own will, whereof he shall give an account unto the
Lord. And yet Cyprian was the Bishop of the Metropolitan or chief seat, and
one whom for his learning and godliness, the rest no doubt had in great
reverence, and gave great honor unto.

Io. Whitgifte.
Because so much ado is made of the words of Cyprian in that erroneous Council
The words of Cyprian discussed. Tom. 1. Con. Carth.
of Carthage, wherein Cyprian himself also was the chief author of the
error, I will recite the words as I do there find them: Neque enim quisquam
nostrum episcopu^ se esse episcoporum constituit, aut tyrannico terrore, ad
obsequendi necessitatem Collegas suos adigit, cum habeat omnis episcopus
licentiam libertatis, and potestatis suae arbitrium proprium, tanqua^ iudicari
ab alio non possit, cum nec ipse possit alterum iudicare, sed expectemus
vniuersi iudicium Domini nostri Jesus Christi, qui vnus and solus habet
potestatem, and praeponendi nos in ecclesiae suae gubernatione, and de actu
nostro iudicandi: Neither does any of us make him self Bishop of Bishops, or
enforces his fellows to the necessity of obeying by tyrannical fear,
because every Bishop has freedom of liberty and free judgment of his own
power, as he who can be judged of no other, neither can him self judge another
Bishop: but let us all wait for the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
alone has power both to place us in the government of the Church, and to
judge of our doing. It were very absurd, to think that Cyprians words are
generaily to be understood of all kind of judgment, or that a Bishop in all
things should be left to his own free liberty: and discretion, or that be is
free from all controlement. For what if he be an heretic? what if he be
otherwise criminous? shall he not be judged by man, but left only to the
judgment of Christ The words of Cyprian if they be as you understand them,
The meaning of Cyprian.
take authority of judgment as well from Synodes, as from Archbishops. Cyprian
therefore means as the words themselves do teach, that one Bishop should not
tyrannically rule over an other, and at his pleasure abridge the liberty of an
other in uttering his judgment, especially in a Synod, or rashly condenme an
other. For Cyprian in that Council propounding the controversy of
rebaptization, requires every man's judgment thereof, protesting (as it were)
not to condemn, or to excommunicate any that should dissent from him in that
matter, and thereupon says, Neque enim quisquam nostrum. etc. so that he
means that to be tyrannicum, to compeil other Bishops necessarily to agree to
his opinion in*all things, and these words, lice^tia libertalis and potestatis
suae arbitriu^ propriu^, are not m^nt of jurisdiction, but of judgment and
opinion. For one man is not of necessity bound to frame him self to the
judgment and opinion of an other, but therein has freedom and liberty,
neither will any man allow this authority in any Archbishop.

Touching jurisdiction, every Bishop in this church has free government over
his stock, in all things that belongs unto him: if any thing happen that he
can not end, then the Archbishop intermedleth, if that will not serve, it is
referred to a Synod. The words of Cyprian can in no respect derogate any thing
from the jurisdiction of Archebishops. For concerning jurisdiction they be
bound to laws themselves, and do but execute laws made, not of their own
private authority, but by Parliament, and by the Prince. Neither can they
control the worst minister in their Dioces, if he observe the laws and rules
prescribed. Therefore except your meaning be, to have Bishops and ministers
free from all laws and from all subjection to any superior, Prince or other
(which is most like) I do not know why you should take this saying of
Cyprian in that sense you do. Sure I am that the words doc not favor your
Anarchie, and that may the Reader easily perceive.

In that Cyprian says, unto every one a portion of the flock is appointed, he
says truly, but yet does he not thereby exempte Bishops, Pastors, and
Ministers from obedience and subjection to their lawful governors. For due
obedience does not hinder any duty that is owing toward their flock.

In the place that you allege out of Cyprians second book and first Epistle,
you have omitted that which goes before, and declares what Cyprian means
by the words that you have recited. His words be these: Caeterum scimus
quosdam quod Lib. 2. Epist. 1.
semel imbiberunt nolle deponere, nec propositum suum facile mutare: etc. But
we know that certain will never lay away that which once they have taken:
neither easily change their purpose, but do reteyne certain things peculiar
to them selves, which once they have used: yet not breaking the bond of peace
and concord among their fellows, wherein we neither compel any man, nor
appoynte any law, since every governor has free judgment of his will in
the government of the Church, and shall render an account of his deed to the
Lord. Cyprian in the words before, shows his opinion concerning such, as
being Ministers of the word had sacrificed to Idols, and when he has so
done, thus he speaks to Stephane to whom he writ the Epistle: Haec ad
conscientiam tuam (frater charissime). etc. Then follows, Caeterum scimus.
etc. as I have before recyted, wherein Cyprian signifies, that he will not
take upon him to judge or to condemn other Churches, which have a contrary
custom, so that they keep the bond of peace. But he means undoubtedly
such Churches and Bishops, as he had nothing to do with, else it is manifest,
that within his own charge he would not have suffered any such thing to be
done, and this place answers all that Cyprian has spoken any where touching
Tract. 3. cap. 2. Sect. 5.
not receyuyng into the ministry such as had sacrificed to Idols, whereof I
have spoken before.

Chap. 3. the. 12. Division.
T. C. Page 77. Sect. 2. 3. 4.
And whereas it is said for the preservation of unity, one must be over al, S.
Cyprian shows Li. 4. epi. 9
that the unity of the Church is conserved not by having one Bishop over all,
but by the agreement of the Bishops one with another. For so he writes, that
the church is knit and coupled together (as it were with the give) of the
Bishops consenting one with an other. And as for the compounding of
controversies, it is manifest, that it was not done by one Bishop in a
province, but those bishops which were near the place where the schism or
heresy sprang.

For speaking of the appeasing of controversies and schisms, and showing how
diverse Bishops Li. 1. epi. 4
were drawn into the heresy of Nouatus, he says that the virtue and strength
of the Christians, was not so decayed or ^anguished, but that there was a
portion of Priests which did not give place unto those rumes and shipwrackes of
faith.

And in another place he says: therefore (most dear brother) the plentyfull
body or company Li. 3. epi. 1^
of the pr^ests, are as it were with the g^ue of mutual concord and band of
unity joined together, that if any of our company be author of an heresy, and
go about to destroy and rent the flock of Christ, the rest should help, and
as profitable and merciful shepherds, gather together the sheep of the
Lord. Whereby it is many fest, that the appeasing and composing of
controversies and heresies, was not then thought to be most fit to be in one
bishops hand: but in as many as could conuemently assemble together,
according to the danger of the heresy which sprang, or deep root which it
had taken, or was like to take.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Bishops agree not one whit the worse, when they have a superior, by whom
they may be called together, and put in mind of their office and duty.
Neither does Cyprian deny this when he affirms the other. For though the
chief cause of unity is the consent and agreement of the Bishops one with
another: yet to have one that shall have the chief care thereof, must needs
be a great help thereunto, even as it is in other societies. For if the Bishops
were divided among themselves, and at variance, and had no superior, who
should compounde the controversies?

Our Archbishops do not take upon them (neither can they) to decide any
controversy How far our Archbishops deal in controversies.
in doctrine and religion of their own authority, but therein do they deal
either according to the laws of the Church provided for that purpose, or else
expecte a new Parliament or Synod. Neither does any Bishop in his Dioces,
otherwise meddle in such matters, than by the common consent of the Church is
appointed unto him: and yet it was never otherwise taught by any, but that a
Bishop in his own Diocese, or an Archbishop in his Province, might use
persuasions to end controversies, and execute the laws provided for the same:
other kind of deciding controversies, by any private authority I know none
in this Church of England. Wherefore al these allegations be but in vain, for
surely not in Cyprians time, was the determining of such controversies
committed to the Pastor and Seigniorie of every Parish, neither does Cyprian
make mention of any such matter, if he did, yet for government the diversity
of the time, and state of the Church is to be considered, Tract. 2. and. 3.
as I have before noted.

Chap. 3. the. 13. Division.
T. C. Page 77. Sect. 4.
And that there was in his time no such authority given, as that any one might
remove the causes or controversies which rose, as now we see there is, when the
Bishop of the Di^es takes the matters in controversy which rise in any Church
within his Dioces from the minister and Elders, to whom the decision
perteyneth, and as when the archbishop takes it away from the Bishop, it may
appear in the same third Epistle of the first book, where he says after
this sort: It is ordained, and it is equal and right, that every man's cause
should be there heard, where the fault was committed. And a little after he
says: It is meet to handle the matter there where they may have both
accusers and witnesses of the fault, which although it be spoken of them
which fled out of Affrike unto Rome: yet the reason is general, and does
as well serve against these ecclesiastical persons, which will take unto them
the deciding of those controversies, that were done a hundred mile of them.

Io. Whitgifte.
Cyprian as I said, speaks not one word of your Seigniorie, and in that
place by you alleages, he speaks of the several Province* (...) Dioces of
every bishop, and would have every matter ended in that Province (...) Diocese
where it is committed, and therefore he speaks there of such as fled out of
Africa into Italy, to have their matters heard, so that this place is soluted
by your own self. It is meet that the matter should be there handled where
there may be had both accusers and witnesses: And that was one of the reasons
that the Council of Africa ^sed against the Bishop of Rome, clayming interest
in hearing appeals from thence. But there is no Province in England so large,
but that both the accusers and witnesses may be brought into any part of it
from any other part. This reason of yours may serve better against
Westminster hall, which is but one place to serve the whole Realm for deciding
of controversies, and yet I think it very necessary*

You may not wrest that to your purpose or proof of Seigniorie, or authority
thereof, which Cyprian speaks of diverse Provinces: yea diverse Countries and
Nations. This is no good reason, Cyprian mislyked the translating of causes
from Africa to Rome, Ergo, there may be no causes removed from Northampton to
London.

Chap. 3. the. 13. Division.
T. C. Page. 77. Sect. 5.
And whereas M. Doctor in both places of Cyprian seems to stand much upon
the words (one Bishop and priest) the reason thereof does appear in another
place of Cyprian most manyfestly, L^. 3. epi. 13
and that it makes no more to prove that there ought to be one archbishop
over a whole province, than to say, that there ought to be but one husband
proves, that therefore there should be but one husband in every country or
province, which should see that all the rest of the husbands do their duties
to their wives. For this was the case, a Nouatian heretic being condemned and
cast out of the Churches of Africa by the consent of the Bishops, and not able
by embassage sent to them, to obtain to be received to their communion and
fellowship again, ^oeth afterward to Rome, and being likewise there
repelled, in time gets himself by certain which favored his heresy, to
be chosen Bishop there at Rome (Cornelius being the Bishop or pastor of those
which were there godly minded) whereupon it comes that Cyprian urges (one
Bishop, one priest in the church) because at Rome there was two, whereof one was
a wolf, which ought not to have bin there, considering there was but one
church which was gathered under the government of Cornelius, and therefore by
that place of Cyprian it can not be gathered, that there ought to be but one
Bishop in one city, if the multitude of professors require more, and that all
can not well gather them selves together in one congregation, to be taught of
one man, much less can it serve to prove that there should be but one in a
whole Diocese or province. I grant that in latter times, and which went more
from the simplicity of the pri^itiue church, they took occasion of these
words to decree, that there should be but one Bishop in a city, This is to pre
^erre your own judgment before the judgment of worthy Councels.
but that can never be concluded of Cyprians words, if it be understood why
he urges (one Bishop, and one priest.) If therefore neither word (Bishop nor
priest) do make any thing to prove an archbishop, nor this word (church) does
imply any province, nor in these words (one Bishop, one priest) there is
nothing less meant than that there should be one archbishop over all the
Bishops and clearg^e in a province, and if Cyprian will neither allow of the
title of an archbishop, nor of the authority and office, but in plain words
speaks against both, we may conclude that M. Doctor has done very
unadvisedly to lay so great weight of the archbishop upon S. Cyprians
shoulders, that will not only not bear any thing of him, but which has
done all that could be, to make him go afoo^e, and hand in hand with his
fellows.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Doctor stands not upon these words, (one Bishop, and one priest) although
the words serve very well for his purpose: Neither is your shifte of a
Noua^ian, being chosen Bishop in Rome, any thing to the matter. For though it
might seem partly to interpret Cyprians meaning in his Epistle to Cornelius,
yet can it not perteine to that that he writes of Florentius Pupianus. And be
it that Cyprian meant to seclude Nouatus, when he said, Du^ Episcopus qui vnus
est. etc. when as the Bishop which is one* etc. What can be spoken more to my
purpose* for Cyprian would have but one Bishop in one city to govern the
Church, as his words manifestly declare.

And whereas you say, that it can not be gathered by that place of Cyprian,
that there ought to be but one Bishop in one city if the multitude of
professors require more. etc. the Epistle of Cornelius in Eusebius, lib, 6.
cap. 43. does convince you of vanity in so saying. For Eusebius. Lib. 6. Cap.
43. The number of Christians in Rome great in Cyprians time.
in that Epistle he declares, that there was then in Rome. 46. Priests, seven
Deacons, seven Subdeacons. 42. Acoluthes. 52. Erorcistes, readers,
doorekeepers. 1500. widows and diseased: and therefore it is to be presupposed
that the number of other Christians there, was very great, seeing that the
Clergy, and those which were found of the Church, amounted to the number
of. 1654. and most like that there were several congregations, for it was not
possible for them to meet in one place, and yet was there then but one Bishop.
For Cornelius in the same Epistle, speaking of Nouatus says, Itaque vindex
ille Euangelij ignorauit vnum esse debere Episcopum in catholica ecclesia, This
defender of the Gospel was ignorant that there ought to be one Bishop in a
catholic Church.

The old Canons and ancient Fathers do testify, that in one City there
ought to be but one Bishop. Chrysostom told Sisinius, that one city must
have but one Socrat. lib. 6. cap. ^2.
Bishop, as we read, lib. 6. cap. 22. of Socrates. Neither are you able to
show from Christ's time, that ever there was allowed to be two Bishops in one
city. Wherefore the words of Cyprian are yet in force (for any thing you have
alleged to the contrary) to prove the office of an Archbishop, or
metropolitan to be, to compounde schisms, and provide that there be unity in
the Church. etc.

There are other reasons which M. Doctor uses, as this, a notable one. S.
Cyprian speaks This argument is of your own joining, and not M. Doctors.
not of the usurped power of the Bishop of Rome, therefore he speaks of the
office of an Archbishop and Metropolitan. It is hard to call this argument
to any head of fallation, for it has not so much as a color of a reason. I
think it can deceive no body but your self.

Io. Whitgifte.
I tell you that the place is not to be understood of the usurped authority
of the Bishop of Rome, but of the authority of the Archbishop in his
Province, or Bishop in his Diocese. I do not make any argument of it: does
it grieve you to hear that Cyprian does not speak of the usurped authority
of the Bishop of Rome? or does every man make an argument when he does
interpret? But this dealing of yours is not strange, I must be content to
bear with it.

An other reason is, that all the godlyest and best learned men do expound
the place of Cyprian in the third Epistle of the first book, of an
Archbishop. The vanity of this saying, that the godly and learned writers so
expound it, I have showed before, and here it comes to be considered
again. I will not say that no godly nor learned writer expounds the place of
Cyprian of the authority of an Archbishop.

But first I desire M. Doctor to set down but one, and then I will leave it
to thy consideration (gentle Reader) to think whether M. Doctor has read any
learned or godly man's exposition to be such, when he has not read those
which are nearest him, I mean our own countrymen. I say he has not read
them, because I would think charitably so of him, rather than that he should
have read them, and yet speak untruly of them, and father those things of
them which they never spoke.

M. Jewel the Bishop of Sarisburie expounded this place, and yet did Untruth,
as will appear.
never expound it In his (...) book. 4. article, and in (...), 5*
of the office and authority of an Archbishop of all the Bishops, and Clergy
of the province, but clean contrariwise applies it to the authority that
every Bishop had in his Dioces. His words are these. Now therefore to draw
that thing by violence to one only Bishop, that is generally spoken of all
Bishops, is a guylefull fetch to misleade the Reader, and no simple nor plain
dealing. Here you see that M. Jewel does not understand this of any
Archbishop, but of every Bishope

M. Nowell Deane of Paul's having occasion to talk of this place says on this
sort. So that (b) M Nowell will wi^ esse against you.

when he speaks (meaning Cyprian) of one Bishop, one Judge, in the Church,
for the time, or of the Bishop which is one, and rules the Church absolutely,
he means every Bishop in his own Diocese, without exception, if he speak
specially, he means the Bishop of the city or Diocese whereof he
entreats, whether it be the Bishop of Rome, Carthage, or any other place.

M. Fox also expounds this of every Bishop within his own Church or
Diocese. You Fol. 93.
hear the judgment of these three writers, that cannot pick out neither the
name nor the office of an Archbishop out of Cyprians place, and yet I think
you will not deny, but these were learned and godly writers.

Now I have showed you three. I ask once again of you, one godly and learned
writer, that expounds it as you do. And by this time I suppose all men
understand what a smallfriend S. Cyprianis either to the name or office of an
Archbishop. Let us hear whether Hierome make any more for the Archbishop then
did Cyprian.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Jewel Bishop of Sarisburie expounding the place of Cyprian in the fourth
article M. Jewel.
5. Division. 228. page of his first book has these words. Upon occasion
hereof he shows (meaning Cyprian) what hurt and confusion of sects and
scismes ensues in any province or diocese whereas the Bishops authority and
ecclesiastical discipline is despised. I pray you what call you that Bishop
that has government of a province? Is he not a Metropolitan or Archbishop?
and does not my L. of Sarisbury as well speak of a province, as he does of a
diocese? I do not deny, but that Cyprians words may be fitly applied to every
Bishop in his diocese: but is the Archbishop therefore secluded? seeing he of
whom, Cyprian did write was a Metropolitan, or Archbishop. That which is the
office of the Archbishop in his province, is also the office of a Bishop in his
diocese, and therefore that which is spoken of the province, in respect of
the Archbishop, is also spoken of the Diocese in respect of the Bishop. And
page 230. he says that vniuersa fraternitas, is taken for one whole particular

brotherhoode, within one province or diocese: so that your first witness
testifies with me, else would he not have named a province.

M. Nowell fol. 22. 23. 24. does expound this place of the authority of every
Bishop M. Nowell.
in his own Diocese, which is sufficient for me, and is as much against you
as can be, for you would have no Bishops over Diocesses, but only pastors in
several towns. That which he speaks of a Bishop in his Diocese, he also
means of an Archbishop in his Province, whose both name and office he does
allow, as it is manifest in these words of his in his third book against
Dorman, fol. 320 where he answering Idem.
this question of Dormans, whether he will condemn the whole Church for making
of Archbishops, says thus. I answer I much commend the Church for so doing,
so far of is it that I will condemn the whole Church therefore. But what shall
I need to use any circumstances, seeing he does most evidently apply this place
of Cyprian to that purpose which you will not acknowledge, yea even unto the
office of an Archbishop in his Province, for thus he writes fol. 33. of his
first book (speaking of this epistle of Cyprian to Cornelius, and confuting
Dormans argument taken out of it for the Popes supremacy, which is grounded
upon this place, Non aliunde haereses obortae sunt. etc.) Concerning the
avoiding and quieting of schisms and troubles in the Church, We say that as
the several Kings of every kingdom, the several governors of every country
and city. etc. are able to ouersee their several charges, and to keep their
people in civil order and peace, so are the several Bishops of every
Diocese, and the several chief Prelates of every Province, able to avoid or
to appease if they rise al Schisms and troubles ecclesiastical, as S. Cyprian
out of whom this reason is borrowed, and falsely wrested by them to an other
purpose, does most plainly teach saying thus. Cum statutum sit omnibus nobis.
etc. What call you chief prelates of every Province? Be they not Archbyshops?
Likewise fol. 60. and, 61. in the same book, speaking of this and such like
places he says, And further whatsoever M. Dorman either out of Deutero* or any
other place of Scripture does untruly apply to the proof of the Supremacy of
one head, to wit the Bishop of Rome, the same does S. Cyprian, M. Dormans
own usual witness, every where allege for the proof of the superiorite of
every Bishop in his own Diocese, and for the obedience due unto him there,
he does never apply it as does M. Dorman to the Supremacy of one Bishop over
all other, but rather against such supremacy of one: and it agrees very well
with the estate of the jews, that as they being one nation had one chief
Priest, so is it good likewise that every Christian nation have their chief
Priest or Bishop: it agrees not that because the Jews (one nation) had one
high Priest to govern them in doubts, therefore all nations throughout the
world should have one high Priest over all other, for not only the
vnlikelyhood between these two, but the impossiblitie of the latter is most
evident.

The words of M. Fox in that place speaking against the Papisticall
interpretation M Fox. Tom. 1. fol. 93.
of Cyprians words be these, when their meaning is otherwise, how that every
one catholic Church or Diocese, ought to have one Bishop over it: which also
iustifyeth my interpretation. For if it be understood of one Bishop over one
Diocese, then is it in like manner of one Archbishop over one Province: For the
reason is all one, and you deny them both alike: For you would have no Bishops
but in several Parishes. Now therefore you see that even these authors whom
you would abuse against me, do make wholly and fully against you, and with me.
For they confess the two places of Cyprian to be meant of Cornelius, and of
himself, who were both Archbyshops and Metropolitanes, and had ample
jurisdiction, especially Cyprian as I have declared. And M. Fexe himself Tom.
1. Fol 21. says that the sea of Rome was a Patriarchall Idem.
sea appointed by the primitive Church, and the Bishop thereof, an Archbishop,
limited within his own bordering Churches: so that the one place being meant of
Cornelius Archbishop of Rome, the other of Cyprian Archbishop of Carthage (for
so they were in deed though they were not in those places so called), S.
Cyprian may well be said in both places to speak of an Archbishop, though he
express not his name. And that which is there spoken of Cornelius or Cyprian
within their Provinces, may most aptly also be understood of every Bishop
within his Diocese, and therefore my L. of Sarum expounding this place
speaks of them both under these names of Province and Diocese: and so does
M. Nowell under the name of chief Prelate and Province, and M. Fox also under
the word Diocese, being plain and evident, that they allow of the office.

That learned man and godly Martyr M. Philpot, as it is recorded in the book
of M. Philpot exam. 5.
Acts and Monumentes in his fifte examination answering this place of Cyprian
objected unto him by D. Sauerson, answers most plainly in these words: And
now for the understanding of that place, you do misconstrue it, to take the
high Priest only for the Bishop of Rome, and otherwise than it was in his
time. For there were by Nicene Council four Patriarchs appointed, the
Patriarche of Jerusalem, the Patriarche of Constantinople, the Patriarche of
Alexandria, and the Patriarche of Rome, of which four the Patriarche of Rome
was placed lowest in the Council, and so continued many years, for the time
of seven or eight general Councels as I am able to show. Therefore S. Cyprian
writing to Cornelius Patriarch of Rome, whom he calls fellow Bishop,
finds himself offended that certain heretics being justly excommunicated
by him (as the Nouatian, were) did fly from his Diocese which was their
chief Bishop (refusing to be obedient unto him and to be reformed) to the
Bishop of Rome and to the Patriarch of Constantinople, and there were received
in communion of congregation in derogation of good order, and discipline in the
Church, and to the mainteining of heresies and schisms. And that heresies did
spring up and schisms daily arise hereof, that obedience was not given to the
Priest of God, nor once considered him to be in the Church for the time the
Priest, and for the time the judge in Christ's stead (as in decree of Nicene
Council was appointed) not meaning
the Bishop of Rome only, but every Patriarch in his precinct, who had every
one of them a college or a Cathedral Church of learned priests in hearing of
whom, by a convocation of all his fellow Bishops, with the consent of the
people, all heresies were determined by the word of God, and this is the
meaning of S. Cyprian, hitherto M. Philpot. Thus the reader may easily perceive
how you have dalied about this place of Cyprian, and that this interpretation
is not mine alone.

And therefore Hierome writing upon the first to Titus says, that Hierome.
in the beginning a Bishop and a Priest was all one. But after that there began
to rise factions in Religion, and some said they held of Apollo, some of
Paul, some of Cephas, and some of Christ, it was decreed that one should be
chosen to bear rule over the rest, to who^ the chief care of the Church
should apperteine, and by whom sects and schisms should be cut of.

Here a man may reason thus. The distinction of degrees began in the Church,
when men began to say I hold of Paul, I hold of Apollo. etc. But this was in
the Apostles time, the. 1. Cor. 1. Therefore these distinctions of degrees
beganin the Apostles time.

The same Hierom in his Epistle ad Euagrium teaches, that the cause why one
was chosen amongst the Bishops to rule over the rest, was in schismatis
remedium, ne vnusquisque ad se trahens Christi ecclesiam rumperet, to meet
with Schisms, least every one according to his own fancy should tear in
pieces the Church of Christ, and says further, that in Alexandria, from S.
Mark unto Heracla and Dionisius Bishops, the Ministers used to elect one
among themselves whom they placing in a higher degree, called a Bishop, even
as an army should choose their Captain, or Deacons should choose one of
themselves whom they knevv to be painful, and call him an Archdeacon. Haec
Hieronymus.

In all these places Hierome does not maynteine the authority of one man over
the whole Church, but thinks it necessary that in every Province there be
one to be chief over the rest, for unity sake, and for rooting out of
contentio^s and sects. And therefore contra Luciferianos he says that unless
this superiority were, there would be as many schisms in the Church as there
be priests.

The Hebrews do derive the name of time of a verb, which signifies to
corrupt, because in deed it does corrupt all, and as the times are so are me^
which live in them: that eue^ very good men carry the note of ye infection of

such sincerity at Hieromes hand, Which we found in S. Cyprian, considering yt
he lived, some ages after Cyprian, what time Satan had a great deal more
darkened ye clear light of the Sun of the Gospel, than it was in S.
Cyprians time. For as those yt came nearest unto the Apostles times, because
they were nearest the light did sce best, so those that were further of from
these lights, had until ye time of the manifestation of the son of
perdition, their heavens more dark and cloudy, and consequently did see more
diuiely, which is diligently ^ be observed of ye reader, both the better to
understand ye state of this question, and all other controversies, which lie
between us and the Papists.

And although Hierome besides his other faults, might have also in this
matter spoken more soundly, yet we shall easily perceive yt he is a great deal
further, from either the title or office of an Archbishop, or else from ye
authority, that a Bishop has with us, than he is from the simplicity of the
ministerio which ought to be, and is commended unto us by the word of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is but a poor refuge, when you cannot answer to discredit the author:
it is evident that Hierome says nothing touching this matter, but that which
is both consonant to the scriptures, and confirmed by the practice of the
Church, long before his time, as appears by that which is said before. And I
pray you what difference is there, betwixt that which Hierome speaks in this
place, and that which Cyprian has s^id before? For Cyp^ian said, That heresies
and schisms have sprung and do spring of this, because the priest of God is
not obeyed. etc. And because the Bishop which is one, and is set over the
church, is through the proud presumption of some contemned. etc. And Hierome
says that ye cause why among ye Bishops one was chosen to govern ye rest, was
to remedy schisms. Do you not perceive how these two fathers join in one
truth, and directly affirm ye self same matter? It is true yt time
corrupts, and therefore much more occasion is offered to appoint government
according to ye times, least the corruptions prevail and get the upper hand,
and for this cause, Hierome says that upon these corruptions of time, the
Church was constreined to appoint this order.

And here I must put M. Doctor in remembrance, how unfitly he has dedicated
his book unto ye church, which has so patched it and peeced it of a number of
shreddes of the Doctors, yt a sentence of A frivolous di^ from the matter.
the scripture either truly or fal^ly alleged, is as it were a Phoenix in this
book. If he would have had ye church believe him, he ought to have settled
their judgment, and grounded their faith upon the scriptures, which are ye
only fou^dations whereupon ye church may build. Now he does not only not give
the^ ground to stand of: but he leads them into ways which they cannot
follow, nor come after him. For except it be those which are learned, and
besides have the means and ability, to have the books which are here cited

these things be true, which are alleged, and as I have said if they could
know, yet have they nothing to stay themselves upon, and quiet their
conscience, in allowing ye which M. Doctor would so feign have them like of.
Therefore he might have much more fitly dedicated his book unto ye ^earned and

M. Doctor has brought more scriptures tha^ you have answered, as in the

Hierome says, ye at the first a Bishop and an elder (which you call a priest)
were all one, but afterward through factions and schisms, it was decreed yt
one should rule over ye rest. Now I say against this order, that ye Bishop
should bear rule over all, ye which our savior Christ says unto ye
Phariseis, from ye beginning it was not so, and therefore I require that ye
first order may stand, which was Contr^ Prax.
that a Bishop and elder were all one. And if you place so great authority
against the institution of God in a mortal man, hear what Tertullian says
unto you.

That is true, whatsoever is first, and that is false whatsoever is latter.

Hierome and you confess yt this was first, that ye Bishop was all one with ye
elder, and first also by ye Tertullians meaning falsified,
word of God, the^ I conclude yt, that is true. You both do likewise confess,
yt it came after that one bare rule over the rest, then I conclude, ye that is
false: for all that is false, that is latter. Furthermore Hierome in the same
place of Titus says after this sort. As ye elders know themselves to be
subject by a custom of the Church, unto him that is set over them, so the
Bishops must know, that they are greater than the elders, rather by custom,
than by any truth of the instatution of the Lord, and so they ought to govern
the Church in common.

Io. Whitgifte.
It follows after in my answer to the Admonition, that there was
superiority among the ministers of the word, e^e^ in the Apostles time, which
I (...) by the ^riptures and other testimonies, it is also (...) that great
factions and schi^mes did (...) the Church eue^ in the Apostles time: and

admit these were not true (which you will never be able to prove) yet your
argument is of no force, and the place of Tertullian is not understood, for
Tertullian in that book, after he has repeated the rule of faith, which is to
believe in (...)*
one God, and in his son Jesus Christ. etc. he says, that this rule has
come from the beginning of the Gospel even before all former heretics, much
more before (...) that was but yesterdaye, as well the posterity of all
heretics as the very novelty of (...) which was of late will prove. Whereby
judgment may hereof be indifferently given against all heresies, that that is
true whatsoever is first, and that count^rfeit, whatsoever is last. Whereby it
is e^ident that Tertullians rule is to be understood in matters of salvation,
(...) is to be (...) s^ode. (...) gin. veland.
and of faith, and not in matters of ceremonies, and kinds of government: which
thing he himself in plain words declares in his book de virginibus

adds this law of ^aith remaining, other things of discipline and
conversation admit newness of correction, the grace of God working and going
forward, even to the end. So that Tertullian thinks that matters of
ceremonies and discipline may be altered (ye rule of faith remaining (...))
notwithstanding his former rule.

If you will not have this to be the meaning of Tertullia^, then will I reason
thus. The reason of the (...) against (...)
In the beginning there were Apostles, therefore there must be Apostles now: in

manifest that Tertullian speaks of matters of faith, and necessary to
salvation, and therefore these arguments, and yours also with such like, be
stark naught.

Now seeing that Hierome confesses yt a Bishop and an elder, by God his

institution, for y^ taking away of this custom, and restoring of the Lords
institution, I say as our savior Christ said, why do you break the
commandments Math 15.
of God, to establish your own traditions* for the one is the institution of
God, and the other the tradition of the Church, and if a man's testimony be so
much with M. Doctor, let him hear what y^ same Develand. virg.
Tertullian says, whatsoever sauoreth against the truth, shall be accounted
heresy, even although it be an old custom.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your whole book is grounded upon the sands, yt is upon fou^datio^s not
proved, as this is. For you should first have proved, that Christ has so
commanded equality of Ministers in government and ecclesiastical policy,
that one of them may not be above the other: the contrary is to be seen in
scripture, both in words and examples, as I have after declared, so far of is
it, that you can show any commandment to the contrary. This text of ye. 15.
of. Mat. did the Anabaptists, object unto Zuinglius in the like case, as it
appears in his book de Baptismo. But he answered the^ as I must answer you,
I speak Zuing. de (...)
not as you feyne me to speak, I speak only of external and indifferent
things, whereof there be many which are neither commanded nor forbidden by any
express word of God. etc. and again, for this that we speak of is not
necessarrie unto salvation, but it is external, of the which things many may be
found omitted in the scriptures. etc. Wherefore except you can prove, that we
bring into the Church some thing as necessary unto salvation which is not
expressed in the scriptures, this text is no more aptly applied by you against
me, than it was by the Anabaptists, against Zuinglius.

The words of Tertullian are true, and make nothing for your purpose, for you
must first prove that these degrees be against the truth.

Now I will turn M. Doctors own argument upon his head, after this sort. A

I will severally answer your arguments, that the reader may the better
understand the pith of them. And first I deny this argument, because it is
neither in mode A (...) argument dis^ (...).
nor sigure. For first you must call to memory, that in the third figure where
you would seem to place it, the Minor may not be negative as yours is. Secondly
there is more in the conclusion then there is in the premises which is against
al rules of sillogismes. If you had concluded according to your former
propositions, you should have said thus, Ergo when there are Archbishops
there are no schisms. For this is the true conclusion of that false
sillogisme. Thirdly Minus extremum should be subiectum conclusionis, and in
this argument it is praedicatu^. Seeing therefore that your argument has no true
form in any respect, I deny it, until it be better framed.

That there was none in the yt Apostles times, thus it may appear. If there
were any they were either ordained by the Apostles, and their authority, or
else without and besides their authority. If there were any without and
besides their authority; then they are therefore to be condemned yt more,
because in their time they starie up without their warrant. And if the Apostles
did ordeine them, there was some use of them, to that whereunto they were
ordained, but there was no use of them to that whereunto they were ordained,
therefore the Apostles did not ordeine them. The use whereunto M. Doctor says
they were ordained, was to compose controversies and end schisms, but to this
they were not used: whereupon it follows, that if there were any they were
unprofitable. That they were not used to any such end it shall be perceived by
that which follows.

Io. Whitgifte.
This should be the proof of your former Minor, if the argument had been good:
but be it as you would have it, here is yet no sufficient proof of your Minor.
They are but only your own bare words, which may as easily be rejected, as
they be barely by you affirmed. But least the ignorant reader should think
that I shifte of matters with such quidities as they understand not, I will
set a side the deformed face of your argument, and come to the matter, and (as
I think) your meaning, which is this. Controversies were compounded in the
Apostles time without an Archbishop, Ergo they may likewise be so now, so that
there is no need of any Archbishop. This is the controversy, whether the
Church be bound to the same kind of external government at all times, that was
used in ye Apostles times. I have proved hitherto that it is not. And more is
to be The office of an archbishop in ye Apostles. Ad. 4. 15. 18. 1 Cor. 3. 4.
5. ^* l'traque id tim. epi ad Tit. Eusebius. lib 3. Cap. 23. Epibha. lib. 1. Tom.
2.
said of the same afterward. In the mean time this I give you to understand,
that although the Apostles had not this name of Archbishop among them, yet
they had the same authority and office. For they had the government and
direction of diverse Churches, both in matters of doctrine and discipline: they
ended controuesies, repressed errors, kept them in quietness: ordained them
Bishops, and visited them, as appears Act. 14. 15. 18. 1. Cor. 3. 4. 5. ^.
and in the Epistle to Timothy and Titus. Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 23. declares of
John the Evangelist, that after he returned from Pathmos, he visited and
governed sundry Churches, and ordained them Ministers. The like does Epiphanius
report of Peter in Pontus and Bithinia Lib. 1. Tom. 2. And what other office
then those has the Archbishop. Therefore though the name of Archbishop was not
among the Apostles, yet was his office and function. And notwithstanding that
part of the office of the Apostles is ceased which consisted in planting and
founding of Churches, throughout ye world: yet this part of government and
direction of Churches remains still and is committed to Bishops. Therefore
says Ambrose in the. 4. ad Ephe. Apostoli Episcopi sunt, Apostles are Bishops,
Ambro. in. 4. Ephe.
because Bishops do succeed them in preaching the word, and governing ye
church.

Now if I shall also prove by good authority that among the Apostles themselves
Superiority among the Apostles.
and in their times, there was one chief (though he were not called
Archbishop) then I suppose that it will not seem strange unto you, that in
this state of the Church, it should be convenient to have the like in every
Province or Diocese. Jerome in his first Ierom. aduers. Ioni. lib. 1.
book aduersus Iouinianum says thus. Yet among the twelve one is chosen, that
a head being appointed, occasion of schism might be removed. And least ye
should wipe this away with your accustomed deprauing of the Author, I will
join unto him the testimony of M. Calvin in his Institutions Cap. 8. who
writes thus. That the twelve Calvin.
Apostles had one among them to govern the rest, it was no marueyle, for
nature requires it, and the disposition of man will so have it, that in every
company (although they be all equal in power) yet that there be one as
governor, by whom the rest may be directed. There is no court without a
Consul, no Senate without a Praetor, no College without a president, no
society without a master. M. Bucer likewise in his book, De regno Christi,
has these words. Now we see by the perpetual observation of the Churches

the Apostles themselves, that it has pleased the holy Ghost, that among the
Ministers to whom especially the government of the Church is committed, one
should have the chief ear, both of the Churches and whole ministry, and
that he should go before all other in that care and diligence, for the which
cause the name of a Bishop is peculiarly given to such chief governors of
Churches, etc. Again upon the. 4. to the Ephe. he says as before is alleged.
Paul in the Acts called the same men, Bishops and Ministers, when he called
for the Idem.
Ministers of Ephesus to Miletum, yet because one among them did rule, and had
the chief ear of the Church, the name of a Bishop did properly belong unto
him. Neither was his age always considered, so that he were virtuous and
learned, as we have an example in Timothy being a young man. Thus then you see,
that even amongst the Apostles themselves, and in the Churches in their times,
there were some, that had the chief authority over the rest, and to this end
especially, that schisms and contentions might be compounded, and the rest
might be directed, which are the chief parts of the Archbishops office: and
therefore all this that you have here said, falls flat to the ground: And
yet still I do affirm, that if it had not been so in the Apostles time, yet
might it have been both lawfully and necessarily, at other times.

At Antioch there rose a great and dangerous heresy, that had in a manner
infected all the Churches which shaked the very foundation of the salvation of
gods childe^, that was, whether faith were sufficient to justify without
circumcision. The matter was disputed of both sides, it could not be agreed of.
What do they now? Do they ordein some Archbishop, Archprophet, Archapostle, or
any one chief to who^ they will refer the coutrouersie, or upon who^ they will
depend? Nothing less. And if they would have had the controversies ended by
one, what divine was there ever, or shall there be more fitter for that purpose
than S. Paul, which was amongst them? Why do they send abroad for remedy,
when they had it at home? Why with great charges and long iourneyes, which they
might have had without charges, or one foot set out of the door? what do they
then? They send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, as if the lesser towns
should send to the Churches of the Uniuersities, and of London, to desire their
help in the determining of the controversy. And what is Paul and Barnabas
embassage, is it to desire the judgment or mind of some one? It must needs be
answered with S. Luke, that they came to know the resolution of the Church, and
yet there were the Apostles, whereof every one was better able both sharply
to see, and to judge incorruptly without affection, than any Archbishop that
ever was. If therefore in so great abundance and ouerflowing of the gifts of
God, and in that time when as controuersyes might have been referred without
danger of error unto one only, this ministry of one above all, was not
thought good: now when the gifts are less, and the danger of error more; to
make an Archbishop for the deciding of controuersyes, and avoiding of schisms,
is a thing so strange, that I am not able to see the reason of it. For to
which soever of the Apostles the controversy had been referred, it is certain
that he would have given a true sentence of it.

him to determine matters of doctrine in controversy: But if any such
contention arise, either he determines the matter according to the law, and
rule already by the Church established, or else with the consent of the Prince
does he set an order in the same by a provincial and lawful Synod: in the
which he is the chief, as some one of the Apostles were in such like
assemblies, according to that which I have before declared: and therefore all
this speech might well have been spared. Your argument also is faulty in two
respects: first it is Ab authoritate negative, or a non facto ad non ius,
which is good Neque in diuinis neque in humanis, neither in divine nor in
humane matters: Secondly, you go about to conclude an universal doctrine of
one particular and singular example: which at no time, nor in any matter is
tolerable.

but that it behooves them in such weighty matters, to resort to the chief
Church, as they now did to Jerusalem. This example therefore, if you well
consider it, is directly against you: neither does it in any respect prove,
that there was then no chief governor or guide of the rest, to supply that
place and office which now the Archbishop has.

And if any can show me one man in these times, of whom we may be assured, that
he will pronounce The Archbishop has (...) to thank you for your gentleness
the truth of every question which shall arise, he shall make me somewhat more
favorable to the Archbishop, than presently I am. For although there were found
one such as could not err, yet I could not consent that the matter should lie
only upon his hand, seeing that the Apostles which could not err in these
matters, would not take that upon them, and seeing that by that means the
judgment of the Church should be contemned, and further, for that the
judgment of one man in a controversy, is not so strong to pull up errors that
are rooted in men's minds, as the judgment and consent of many. For, that the
judgment of many is very apt either to confirm a truth, or to confute
falsehoode, it is evident that S. Paul does hold forth, as it were a buckler
against the frowardness of certain, the authority of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
You take great pains in fighting without an adversary, and because otherwise
(as it should seem) you lack matter to lengthen your book, therefore you
devise matter of your own to strive against. For who has affirmed that, which
you so earnestly seek in this place to overthrow? It has been told twice
already, that neither of our Archbishops takes upon him to compounde
controversies in doctrine by himself alone, neither is it their office so to
do. The Archbishops authority in this The authority of Archbishops in our

same: this is his principal charge (as I take it) against the which you have
not as yet spoken any thing, but devise with your self, to improve that which
no man affirms: this is but very shifting and dallying.

Furthermore, if this distinction came up in the Apostles time, and by them,
how comes it to pass, that they never mention it, nay how comes it to
pass that even S. Paul in that very Epistle where these voices are found (I
hold of Paul, I of Apollo, I of Cephas which are 1. Cor. 14.
said to be the cause of the Archbishop) ordeyneth a clean contrary to this
that M. doctor commends? A place far se^ched to improve the office of the
Archbishop.
For when two or three Prophets have expounded the scriptures, he appoynteth
that all the rest that are there, should judge whether they have done well or
no.

Io. Whitgifte.
I contend not that the name of the Archbishop was in the Apostles time, but
you have not yet proved that the office was not then, or that there was then no
superiority among the Clergy, which you notwithstanding deny. Your negative
reason proves nothing, as you have been oftentimes told.

The place in the. 1. Cor. 14. is far fetched, it speaks not of gournment,

discipline, or external policy of the Church, but of expounding the
Scriptures. And what a reason call you this S. Paul, says. 1. Cor. 14.
Prophet^ duo aut tres loquantur, caete^i dijudicent: Let two or three Prophets
speak, and let the other judge, Ergo he speaks against an Archbishop? Surely
if the Authors of the Admonition had not been detected of their unskillful
allegations of Scriptures, I should have had as much a do with you in that
point: for even of these few which you have used, there is not almost one
rightly and truly applied. S. Paul in that place to the Corinthians shows,
that the hearers must judge of the doctrine of the Prophets, whether it be
according to the word of God or no, as those did which are commended in the.
17. of the Acts: but what is this to an Archbishop?

standing of five parts, wherein he makes mention, not one word of an
Archbishop: and says further, that that ministry is able to enterteyne the
perfect unity, and knitting together of the Church? Do not all these things
speak or rather cry, that there was not so much as a step of an Archbishop in
the Apostles times?

Io. Whitgifte.
How often have you alleged this place to ye same purpose? If I should do the
like, you The place Ephesians. 4. no per^ect pater^
would bestow one whole side in jesting at it. But I answer you as I did
before. In this place the Apostle as you confess, recites offices that be but
temporal, as Apostle, Prophet, etc. he leaves out those offices which you say
are perpetual, as Deacon, and Senior. Therefore it is no such perfect
pattern, as you would have it. And if you say that these offices are contained
under the names of Pastors and Doctors, then I say that Bishops and Archbishops
be so in like manner. If you will have the Apostle to speak of these
ministeries only, which are occupied in the word and sacraments, then I say
unto you, that an Archbishop is a name of Jurisdiction and government

committed to a Bishop, Pastor or Minister of the word, as necessary for the
good government of the Church, but not as any new ministry, as you untruly
both now, and also before have surmised. But to let all this pass: in those
offices which S. Paul here recites is the office of an Archbishop contained,
though it be not named, and namely under the Apostles and Pastors as I have
before showed.

Chap. 3. the. 26. Division.
T. C. Page 81. Sect. 1.
And if you will say, that the Apostles did ordeyne Archbishops (as you have
indeed said, and do now again) when as there is not one word in the writings
of them, I pray you tell us, how we shall hold out of the Church the unwritten
verities of the Papists? For my part if it be true that you say, I cannot tell
what to answer unto them. For our answer is to them, the Apostles have left a
perfect rule of ordering the Church written, and therefore we reject their
traditions, if for no other cause, yet because they are superfluous and more
than need. Now this degree of Archbishop being not only not mentioned in the
scriptures, but also manifestly oppugned, it is to bold, and hard^ a speech
(that I say no more) to ^et the petegree of the Archbishop from the Apostles
times, and from the Apostles themselves.

Io. Whitgifte.
I must answer you still as Zuinglius answered the Anabaptists in the like
objection, and as I have answered you before: the Papists make their traditions
necessary unto salvation, and therefore they are to be rejected, because the
word of God conteyneth all things necessary to salvation. I make those
offices part of decency, order, Ecclesiastical government and policy,
which admits alteration as the times and persons require, and are not
particularly expressed in the Scriptures, no more than diverse other things be
in the same kind, as I have proved before. And that this may seem no
strange matter, or any thing favoring the Papists unwritten verities, you may
call to remembrance that which M. Calvin says of such traditions Calvin.
upon these words. 1. Cor. 11. Quemadmodum tradidi vobis instituta tenetis. I
do not deny (says he) but that there were some traditions of the Apostles not
written etc. as I Tract. 2.
have before recyted, speaking of Ceremonies not expressed in the word. And
you may see that wise and learned men are not so scrupulous in Apostolical
traditions not written, so that they be not such as are made necessary unto
salvation: neither is any learned man of contrary judgment. And therefore
Archbishops may well be brought from the Apostles times, without any danger of
admitting the unwritten verities of the Papists. You have not yet proved that
either the name or office of Archbishoppes is in any respect oppugned in the
word of God, and therefore that is but feyned.

Chap. 3. the. 27. Division.

But all this time M. doctor has forgotten his question, which was to prove an
Archbishop, whereas all these testimonies which he alleges, make mention
only of a bishop, and therefore this may rather confirm the state of the
bishop in this realm, than the Archbishop. But in the answer unto them it
shall appear, that as there is not in these places so much as the name of an
Archbishop mentioned, so except only the name of a Bishop, there shall be
found very little agreement between the Bishops in those days, and those
which are called Bishops in our time, and with us.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Doctor remembers that the Authors of the Admonition as well deny the
office of a Bishop, as the office of an Archbishop, and he is not ignorant,
that the proof of the one is the confirmation of the other, and therefore he
uses such testimonies as perteyne to them both: of the which nature those
places be that he has hitherto alleged. For you must understand, that I
spoke before of the name, and now according to my promise I speak of the
office, which is not so far distant from the Bishops, but that in most
things they be confounded: But let us now hear how you perform your promise.

And consequently, although M. doctor thought with one whiting box to have
whited two walls (by establishing our Archbishop and Bishop by the same
testimonies of the fathers) yet it shall be plain, that in going about to

Let us therefore come first to examine Ieromes reasons, why one must be over
the rest, for in the testimony of men that is only to be regarded which is

grounded of the scripture: otherwise, if he speak without either scripture or
reason, he is as ^asily rejected as alleged. One (says he) being chosen to be

And admit it were so, yet the peace which is without truth, is more execrable
than a thousand contentions. For as by stryking of two flintes together, there
comes out fire, so it may be, that sometimes by contention, the truth which
is hidden in a dark peace may come to light, which by a peace in naughtiness
and wickedness being as it were buried under the ground, does not appear.

Io. Whitgifte.
Jerome being a man of such singular learning, and great credit among those
that be learned, in a matter of History as this (for he reports when one
Bishop was T. C. descredueth the author whom he cannot answe^e.
placed over the rest, and for what cause) is more to be believed without
reasons, than you with all your popular and frivolous arguments. Let the reader
again consider whether this be your manner or no, by vain reasons to shake the
credit of the author, when you cannot otherwise answer.

The reasons that you use for the popular or Aristocraticall government of the
Church, when they come among the people, will be easily transferred to the
state of the common weal, and peradventure breed that misliking of civil
government, that you would now have of Ecclesiastical, to a further
inconvenience and mischief, than you and all yours will be able to remedy. In
the mean time you utterly overthrow T. C. ouer^ ^he (...) of the (...) in

the Queens authority in Ecclesiastical matters, given unto her by the laws
of God, as hereafter shall be proved. For if the state must either be popular
or Aristocraticall, then must there be no one supreme gouerner in Church
matters, but I will come to your reasons.

First you ask whether the Church be not in as great danger when all is done
at the pleasure and lust of one man, and when one carries all into error. etc.
Here you do either ignorantly Difference betwixt a king and a tyrant.
or wilfully confound Monarchiam with tyranny. For betwixt a king and a
tyrant, this is one difference, that a king rules according to the laws that
are prescribed for him to rule by, and according to equity and reason: a
tyrant does what him list, follows his own affections, contemns laws, and
says, Sic volo, sic iubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas. So I will, so I
command, my pleasure stands for reason. Now therefore to use those reasons
to overthrow a lawful Monarchy, which are only proper to wicked tyranny, is
either closely to accuse the government of this Church of England of tyranny,
or maliciously by subtle dealing, and confounding of states, to procure the
The ecclesiastical government in this Church not tyrannical but lawful.
misliking of the same in the hearts of the subjects. There is neither Prince
nor Prelate in this land that rules after their pleasure and lust, but
according to those laws and orders that are appointed by the common consent of
the whole realm in Parliament, and by such laws of this Monarchy as never
hitherto any good subject has mislyked: and therefore your ground being
false: how can the rest of your building stand? It has been said before that
the Archbishop has not this absolute authority, given unto him, to do all
things alone, or as him lust. He is by law prescribed both what to do, and
how to proceed in his doings. Moreover this Church of England (Gods name
be praised therefore) has all points of necessary doctrine certainly
determined, Ceremonies and orders e^presly prescribed, from the which neither
Archbyshoppe nor Bishop may swerve, and according to the which, they must
be directed, to the observing of the which also, their duty is to constreyne
all those that ^ee under them. So that whosoever shall wilfully and s^ubburnely
sever himself from obedience, either to Archbyshoppe or Bishop in such
matters, may justly be called a Schismatike, or a disturber of the Church. And
in this respect is that saying of Cyprian now most true: For neither do
Heresies Li^. Epist. 3.
arise, nor Schisms spring of any other thing, but hereof, that the Priest of
God is not obeyed. And so is this of Ieromes in like manner. Ecclesiae salus in
summi Sacerdotis pendet Contra Luciscrianos.
dignitate, cui si non exors and ab omnibus eminens detur potestas, tot in
Ecclesia efficiuntur schismata, quot sacerdotes. The safety of the Church
depends upon the dignity of the high Priest, to whom unless a singular
and peerless power be given, there will be, as many schisms in the Church,
as there be Priests.

You say that it is harder to draw many into an error than one, etc. which is
not true, The government of one by law, more safe than of many without law.
when that one rules and governs by law. For the mind of man even of the
best may be ouerruled by affection, but so cannot the law. Wherefore a wicked
man directed by law governs more indifferently, than multitudes without
law, be they never so godly. Moreover one Godly, wise, and learned man is
much more hardly moved to any error, than is the multitude, which naturally
is prone and bent to the same: in whom not only Philosophers, but singular
Divines also have noted great inconstancy and a disposition most vnmeet^ to
govern. The s^ilitude of water returned against the Replier.


Your similitude of water holds not: for a little water in a grauelly or
stony Well or River is not so soon troubled and corrupted, as are multitudes
of waters in Fennishe and Marrishe grounds. Again, a little water in a
running River or Fourde is at all times more pure and clear, than is a great
quantity in standing Puddelles: to be short, is not the water of those little
springs, and Cundite heads, (which being safely locked up, and enclosed in
stone and Lead, do minister great relief to whole Cities) much more
pleasant, hardlyer corrupted, less troubled, than the great waters in the
Thames. Therefore is a little water proceeding from a good Fountain, by stones
and Lead kept from things that may hurt it, hardlier putrifyed and corrupted,
than all the Fennishe waters in a whole Country, than mighty Pooles, yea than
the Thames it self. So is one wise and prudent man governed and directed by
order and by law, further from corruption and error in government, than
whole multitudes of people, of what sort soever they be.

You further say, that this Ecclesiastical monarchy has been the cause of
discord, etc. I answer, that it has been the cause of the contrary,
until such time as it was turned into tyranny, as by all Ecclesiastical
stories and writers it may appear, and namely by these two, Cyprian and Jerome.

against any form of government used by the Archbyshoppe in this Church of
England, but in plain and manifest words both the name and office of the
Archebishoppe is there mainteyned and approved. And I wish that the learned
Reader would peruse over all that part of Gratian, then should he easily
perceive your faythfulnesse in alleging Authorities. And though it be
somewhat tedious, yet that the unlearned also may have some taste of your
dealing, I will set down some Canons contained in that part of Gratian. Out
of the Council of Pope Martine he cyteth this Canon. Per singulas prouincias
oportet Episcopos cognoscere. etc. In every Province the Bishops must know
their Metropolitan to have the chief authority, and that they ought to do
nothing without him, according to the old and ancient Canons of our
forefathers, for the which cause also the Metropolitan must take upon him
nothing presumptuously without the council of other Bishops. And out of the
council of Antioch, he has this. Per singulas prouincias Episcopos singulos
scire oportet, etc. In every province the Bishops must know their Metropolitan
which governs, to have the chief care of the whole province: and therefore
those that have any causes must resort to the Metropolitan city. etc. In all
the rest of the Canons he manifestly attributes superiority and government to
the Archbishop and Metropolitan, even the same that we do in this Church, only
he denies that the Metropolitan or Archbishop has such absolute authority,
that he can deal any thing in criminal causes against a Bishop, or in other
common matters without the consent of other Bishops, which is not against any
thing by me affirmed, or contrary to any authority claymed by the Archbishop,
for it has been from the beginning denied that the Archbishop of his own
absolute authority can determine any thing in matters doubtful, and not
determined by the laws and orders of this Church, to the which the whole
realm has consented. Can. apost. 33.


The. 33. Canon of the Apostles quoted in the margent is this: Episcopos
singularum gentium scire conuenit quis inter eos primus babeatur, quem velut
existiment. etc. It behooves the Bishops of every province to know who is
chief among the^, whom they must esteem as their head, and do nothing without
his knowledge, save such things only as pertayne to their own parish and
villages, which are under it, neither shall he do any thing without the
knowledge of all. For so shall unity be kept and God shall be glorified
through Christ in the holy Ghost. What have you gotten by this Canon? you see
here manifestly that in every province or nation there must be one chief
Bishop, that is Archbishop, to whom the rest must submit themselves, and do
nothing without his knowledge. This is as much as I require: And if this Canon
was made by the Apostles (whereof you seem not to doubt) then is the name and
authority of an Archbishop, of greater antiquity than you would gladly have
it, and the reason and saying of S. Jerome most true.

Both of this Canon, and of the Canon of the council of Antioch confirming it,
I have spoken before. Your Passim in the margent, if it be meant of such like
plac^s as this, I grant it: but if of any other popular or Aristocraticall
state and kind of government, or to the improuing of the office and authority
of an Archbishop, it will fall out to be nusquam. You say, that it appears in
the decretalls themselves that this kind of government has been the
wellspryng of most horrible schism. Show one place: why are you not ashamed to
utter manifest untruths? Show one sentence there tending to that end. I have
recited some Canons out of that place, and I have showed the intent of Gratian
both in them, and in the rest. They all signify that an Archbishop may not do
any thing of his own authority without the consent of the other Bishops,
which no man denies, and this is the whole scope of that question.

Our peace is in truth and due obedience, we have the true doctrine of the
word of God: and the right administration of the Sacraments: and therefore to
make contention in this Church, and to disturb the quietness and peate, cannot
be but mere schismatic, I will say no worse. Zuinglius in his Ecclesiastes
says, that the Anabaptists went about to defend their contentions then,
after the same manner that you do yours now. But I answer you as he answered
them: your contention is not against Infidels, Papists, and such like: but
against the faithful, against the true professors of the Gospel, and in the
Church of Christ, and therefore as it is of it self wicked, so is it the
cause of contempt, disobedience, and much other ungodliness. And the two
flintstones may be in such time and place stricken together, that the sparks of
fire which comes from them, may consume and burn the whole city and
country too. And surely he is but a mad man that will smite fire to light a
candle to see by at noone day, when the sun shines most clearly.

If therefore superiority and domination of one above the rest have such force
to keep men from schisms, when they be in the truth, it has as great force
to keep them together in error, and so besides that one is easier to be
corrupted than many, this power of one brings as great inco^moditie in keeping
them in error, if they fall into it, as in the truth, if they are in it.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is as though you should say, that if a Monarchy be an excellent kind
of government, and in deed the best, when the laws rule and not man (as
Aristotle says) then also is it the worste, when affection rules and not the
law, which is true: for that is the worst state of government which is opposed
to the best. But if you will therefore conclude, that a Monarchy is not the
best state, your argument has no reason in it: even so is it in the government
of the Church, if the chief governor thereof should follow his own appetite
and be ruled by his private affections: but it is far otherwise when he
rules according to the laws whereunto he himself is subject.

Institutions Cap. 8. Sect. 95. That which is profitable in one nation, cannot
by any reason be extended to the whole world, for there is great difference
betwixt the whole world and one nation. And a little after, it is even as
though a man should affirm, that the whole world may be governed by one King,
because one field or town has but one ruler or Master. And again, that
which is of force among few, may not by and by be drawn to the whole world,

all why the same proportion may not be kept between the Pope and the rest of
the Bishops of Christendom, that is between the Archbishop and the other
Bishops of the province? I answer, you might as well ask, why the same
proportion may not be kept between one Emperor of all the world, and all
the Princes of the world to be under him, that is between the King of one
realm and his Lords under him. The reason that the same proportion can not be
kept, is first, because there is no like proportion at all between the
ability of man's wit and power (being but weak) to govern one province, and
his ability to govern the whole Church, and all Churches throughout the
world, which no one man can have knowledge of, much less can have ability to
rule them. Secondly you can bring no such proportion of antiquity for your
Pope to be chief head of the whole Church, as is to be showed for Archbishops
to be the chief Bishops in their own provinces, etc. Hitherto M. Nowell. I

Prince, the Pope of Rome will say that Constantine or Phocas which was Emperor
of al Christendom, did grant him his authority over all Churches. But you
will say that is a lie, but the Pope will set as good a face, and make as great
a show therein, as you do in diverse points here. But admit it to be, yet I
say further, that it may come to pass, and it has been, that there may be one
Christian Caesar over all the realms which have Churches. What if he then will
give that authority to one over all, that one king grants in his land, may
any man accept and take at his hands such authority? and if it be not lawful
for him to take that authority, tell me what fault you can find in him which
may not be found in them?

Io. Whitgifte.
The Pope does challenge much of his temporalties from Constantinus and Phocas:
but his supremacy and jurisdiction over all Churches he claymeth from Peter,
and from Christ: wherein his claim is more intolerable being most false, and
his jurisdiction more usurped being wrongfully challenged: you err therefore in
that ^oynt greatly. The Archbishop does exercise his jurisdiction under the
Prince, and by the Princes authority. For the Prince having the supreme
government of the realm, in all causes, and over all persons, as she does
exercise the one by the Lord Chancellor, so does she the other by the
Archbishops.

Your supposition of one Caesar over all realms that have Churches is but
supposed, and therefore of no weight: but admit it were true, yet is there not
the like reason for one Archbishop to be over all those Churches, and over one
province: the reasons I have alleged before out of M. Calvin, and other,
neither is there any man not wilfully blinded, or papistically affected, that
sees not what great diversity there is betwixt one province and many
kingdoms: the government of the one, and the government of the other. Si vnus
duodecim bominibus praefuit, an propterea sequetur vnum debere Inst. cap. 8.

therefore follow, that one may be appointed over an hundred thousand men? Says
M. Calvin.

It will be said that no one is able to do the office of a Bishop, unto all the
whole Church, neither is there any one able to do the office of a bishop to the
whole Church of England, for when those which have been most excellent in
knowledge and wisdom, and most ready and quick, in doing and dispatching
matters, being always present, have found enough to do to rule and govern
one several congregation: what is he which absent, is able to discharge his
duty toward so many thousand churches? And if you take exception, that
although they be absent, yet they may do by under ministers, as Archdeacons,
Ehauncellors, Officials, Commissaries, and such other kind of people, what do
you else say, than the Pope, which says, that by his Cardinals, and
Archbishops, and Legates, and other such like, he does all things? For with
their hands he rules all, and by their feet he is present every where, and
with their eyes he sees what is done in all places. Let them take heed
therefore, least if they have a common defense with the Pope, that they be not
also joined nearer with him in the cause, than peradventure they be aware of.
Who can believe you mean^ good faith*
Truly it is against my will, that I am constrained to make such comparisons,
not that I think there is so great diversity between the Popedom and the
Archbyshopricke, but because there being great resemblance between them, I
mean having regard to the bare functio^s, without respecting the doctrine good
or bad which they uphold, that I say there being great resemblance between
them, there is yet as I am persuaded, great difference between the persons that
execute them. The which good opinion conceived of them, I do most humbly
beseech them by the glory of God, by the liberty of the Church purchased by
the precious blood of our savior Christ, and by their own salvation, that
they would not deceive, by reteyning so hard, such excessive and unjust
dominion over the Church of the living God.

Io. Whitgifte.
But one man may do the office of an Archbishop in one province, every several
diocese whereof has a Bishop. And one man may do the office of a Bishop in
one diocese, every several parish whereof has a several Pastor. The
Archbishop has a general charge over the province to see that unity be kept
among the Bishops, and that the Bishops do their duties according to the laws
and order of the Church, or else to see them reformed according to the said
laws and orders, if they shall be co^playned of to have neglected the same.
The like care have the Bishops over the several Pastors of their diocese, and
other persons. Neither does their office consiste in preaching only, but in
governing also: in the respect whereof they are over and above the rest. This
office of government may be well executed in one province, so much and so far
as by the laws is required, and as is convenient for the state of the Church,
but it could not be so over all Christendom.

It may be that some Pastors having small charges, and busy heads, may find
and procure more matters and controversies than either they be able or willing
to compound: such busy Pastors there be in England: but their unquietness, or
lack of ability to dispatch those controversies which they themselves are the
authors and causes of, does not prove but that either the Archbishop or Bishop
may do those things sufficiently, and well, that do apperteyne to their office
and calling.

So much may they do by under ministers as Archdeacons, Chauncellors, etc. as
by the rules of the Church are permitted unto them, and may be convenient for
the time and persons. But the office of preaching, of ordeyning ministers, of
suppressing heresies and schisms, with such like, they do not commit unto
them, but execute them themselves, the which because they cannot do throughout
all Churches, as they may in one Province, therefore your reason is no reason.
Moreover a Bishop of one diocese or province, may have conference with his
Archdeacons and Chauncellor, and be privy to all and singular their doings: So
cannot the Pope with his Cardinals, Archbyshops, and Legates etc. dispersed
thorough out whole Christendom. And therefore an Archbishop or Bishop may well
govern a province or diocese, and use the heipe of Archdeacons, Chauncellors
etc. but so cannot the Pope do whole Christendom, what help or deputies
soever he have.

If against your will you were constrained to make such comparisons, why do you
make Difference between the Pope and our Archbishops.
them when there is no cause? why do you forge that which is untrue? why do you
join together offices which in no point are like. The Pope chalengeth
authority over all Christendom: so do not our Archbishops. The Pope exalts
himself above Kings and Princes: so do not our Archbishops, but with all
reverence acknowledge their subjection to the Prince. The Pope says, that to
be subject unto him, is of necessity to salvation, so do not our Archbishops.
The Pope makes his Decrees equal to the word of God, our Archbishops think
nothing less of theirs. To be short, the Pope oppresses and persecutetth the
Gospel: they earnestly profess it, and have suffered persecution for it.
Therefore your comparison is odious, and your riotous speech more presumptuous
than becomes a man pretending your simplicity.

Your good opinion conceived of them, is well uttered in your book: what
spirit has taught you thus to dissemble? surely even the same that has
falsified Scriptures, and writers in your book: that has uttered so many
proud and contemptuous speeches against your superiors: that has moved you
to make contention in the Church: even spiritus mendax, spiritus arrogantiae
and superbiae, a lying spirit, the spirit of arrogancy, and pride, for such
fruits cannot proceed from any other spirit.

But Jerome says that this distinction of a Bishop, and a minister or elder,
was from S. Mark his time, unto Dionysius time, whereby M. Doctor would make
us believe, that Mark was the author of this distinction: but that cannot be
gathered by Ieromes words. For besides that things being ordered then by the
suffrages of the ministers and Elders, it might (as it falls out oftentimes)
be done without the approbation of S. Mark: the words from Mark may be
rather taken exclusiuely, to shut out S. Mark, and the time wherein he lived,
than inclusiuely, to shut him in the time wherein this distinction rose.

Howsoever it be, it is certain that S. Mark did not distinguishe, and make
those things diverse, which the holy ghost made all one. For then (which the
Lord forbid) he should make the story of the Gospel, which he wrote suspected.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is no answer to Ieromes words, but a dallying with them: the place is
evident: he says, from the time of Mark the Evangelist, whom undoubtedly he
would not have named, unless the same manner had been in his time. But be it
that the words (from Mark) be taken exclusiuely (which no man of Judgment
will grant) yet does it argue a great antiquity of this distinction, even
from the most pure and best time of the Church.

It is certain that these things were not otherwise distinguished than the
holy Ghost had appointed: and therefore your (for then etc.) is an ungodly
collection, and unbeseeming your person in any respect, to imagine of the
glorious Gospel written by that holy Evangelist.

Again it is to be observed that Jerome says it was so in Alexandria,
signifying thereby, An absurd collection.
that in other Churches it was not so. And indeed it may appear in diverse
places of the ancient fathers, that they confounded Priest and Bishop, and
took them for all one, as Eusebius out of Ireneus calls Ani^ete, Pius,
Telesphorus, Higinus, Xystus, (...), Lib. 5. 16. De dignitate sacerdotali.
Elders, and presidents. Cyprian confounds Priest and Bishop in the Epistles
before recited, so does Ambrose in the place alleged before by M. Doctor, and
yet it is one thing with us, to be a priest (as M. Doctor speaks) and an
other thing to be a Bishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
This argument passes of all that ever I heard, Jerome says, there was a
Bishop The passing Logike of T. C.
in Alexandria above the other ministers, from S. Marks time, therefore there
was no Bishop in any place else. God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Ergo, he is no bodies God else: he is the God of the Jews, Ergo, not of the
Gentiles. There be Bishops in England, Ergo, there are none in any other place.
No marueyle it is, though you riot in your Logike, when such stuff is set
abroad. Like unto this are the other: Eusebius out of Ireneus, calls Anitete,
Pius, Telesphorus, etc. elders, and presidents, and Cyprian confounds Priest,
and Bishop, and so does Ambrose, Ergo, every Priest is such a Bishop as Jerome
here speaks of. These be pretty arguments.

Every Bishop is a Priest, but every Priest has not the name and title of a
Bishop, Difference betwixt bishop and priest. Hieronymus ad Euagrium.
in that meaning that Jerome in this place takes the name of a Bishop. For his
words be these: Nam Alexandriae a Marco Euangelista vsque ad Heraclam etc. At
Alexandria from Mark the Evangelist, until Heracla and Dionysius Bishops, the
ministers always chose one from among themselves, and placing him in a higher
degree of dignity, called him a Bishop: as if an army should make a Captain*
etc. Neither shall you find this word ( Episcopus) commonly used, but for
that Priest that is in degree over and above the rest, notwithstanding (
Episcopus) be oftentimes called Presbyter, because Presbyter is the more
general name: so that M. Doctor says truly, that it is with us one thing to
be a Bishop, an other thing to be a priest, because every Bishop is a Priest,
but every Priest is not a Bishop.

I know these names be confounded in the Scriptures, but I speak according to
the manner and custom of the Church, even since the Apostles time. And this is
not only my opinion, but other learned men affirm it in like manner: as M.
Bucer in his book De regno Christi, and upon the. 4. Ephesians. Whose words I
have before rehearsed. Thus you see that M. Doctors distinction is with better
authority confirmed, than you have any to overthrow it.

one that was ruler of the rest. Therefore we ought rather to follow these
Churches being many, in keeping us to the institution of the Apostles, than
Alexandria being but one Church and departing from that institution, and if
there had been any one set over all the rest in other places, it would have made
much for the distinction that Icrome had recited.

James was bishop of Jerusalem, and in authority above all other ministers
there. Bishops at Jerusalem in the Apostles time. Eusebius, lib. 2. cap. 23.
Eusebius so reports of him out of Egesippus, who lived immediately after ye
Apostles time, his words out of Egesippus be these: Ecclesiam gubernandam post
Apostolos Iacobus frater Domini accepit: James the brother of the Lord had the
government of the Church after the Apostles, Lib. 2. Cap. 23. And in the
beginning of that chapter Eusebius speaking of this James says thus, Cui
Hierosolymis ab Apostolis Episcopalis seeds concredita fuerat: to whom the
Bishops seat at Jerusalem was committed by the Apostles. In the first chapter
of that book: he says out of Clement, that Peter and John after the
ascension of Christ. Constituerunt Iacobum Iustum Hierosolymorum Episcopum,
did appoint James the Lib. 2. Ca. 1.
Just, Bishop of Jerusalem. The same thing do all Ecclesiastical histories
and writers (that make any mention of this matter) affirm of him. After James,
was Simeon the son of Cleop^as appointed Bishop there, as the same Eusebius
reports, lib. 3. cap. 11. Idem.
and lib. 4 cap. 22. Therefore you are greatly deceived in saying that there was
no one over the rest at Jerusalem: although if there had been none, yet would
it not have served your turn, because the Apostles as yet being alive, this
office of Bishops was less needful: But it is certain that they placed
Bishops in all great and famous Churches, after they had planted them, as
Zuinglius says in his Ecclesiastes: and ancient authors do testify.

Linus was Bishop of Rome as Eusebius witnesses Lib. 3. cap. 2. and he lived
in Other bishops in the apostles time. Eus. Li. 3. cap. 2. and 4.
the Apostles time. Timothy bishop at Ephesus, Titus at Creta, Dyonisius
Areopagit^ at Athens etc. as he also writes in the same book cap. 4. But this
thing is so manifest and so well known to all that read Ecclesiastical
histories, that I am sure they will maruayle at your gross oversight in
denying the same. Wherefore Ieromes distinction stands.

But against this distinction of S. Jerome, I will use no other reason than
that which Jerome uses in the same epistle to Euagrius. Jerome in that Epistle
takes up very sharply the Archdeacon Jerome speaks not in that place of an
Arch deacon, but of a deacon.
that he preferred himself before the Elder, and the reason is, because by the
Scripture the Deacon is inferior unto the Elder. Now therefore Jerome himself
confessing that by the scripture, a Bishop and an Elder are equal, by Ieromes
own reason, the bishop is to be sharply reprehended, because he lifts
himself above the Elder.

Io. Whitgifte.
Without doubt you forget your self, else would you not reason in this manner:
The Archdeacon is inferior to the elder, therefore the bishop is not superior
to the elder in any respect: I see no sequel in this reason, neither yet any
likelyhoode. Besides that, you untruly report of Hierome, for he speaks of
a Deacon, and not of an Archedeacon. But it is your manner so to deal: suerly
I marueyle that you will utter so manifest untruths. But if Hierome should so
say, yet is your argument nothing: for though an Archedeacon be inferior to a
minister (whom you call Elder) yet does not that prove but that there may be
degrees among the ministers, and that the cheifest of them in authority, may
be called a Bishop, as Hierome also in that Epistle declares. And although
Hierome confess that by the scripture, Presbyter and Episcopus is all one, (as
in deed they be quoad ministerium.) yet does he acknowledge a superiority of
the Bishop before the minister. For besides these places that I have alleged
in my Answer to the Admonition, he says thus in the same Epistle. Presbyter
and Episcopus aliud Ad Euagr.
^tatis, aliud dignitatis est nomen, the one is a name of age, and the other of
dignity. And a little after: In Episcopo and Presbyter continetur, the Elder or
minister is contained in the Bishop. Therefore no doubt this is Ieromes mind,
that a Bishop in degree and dignity is above the minister, though he be one
and the self same with him in the office of ministering the word and
sacraments: and therefore he says, presbyter continetur in episcopo: because
every Bishop is presbyter, but every presbyter is not Bishop.

But what helps it you that there was a Bishop of Alexandria, which urge an
Archbishop, or what auantageth it you, that there was one chief, called a
Bishop in every several congregation, which would prove that there ought to be
one Bishop chief over a thousand congregations? What could have bin brought
more strong to pull down the Archbishop out of his throne, then that which
Ierom faith there, when he affirms that the Bishop of the obscurest village
or hamlet, has as great authority and dignity as the Bishop of Rome? Erasmus
did see this, and said (...), that is, But in the same place speaking in
earnest he a^firmeth a^ much as I r^ quire.
testingly, that Hierome spoke that of the Bishops of his time, but if the had
seen how the Metropolitanes of our age excel other Bishops, he would have
spoken otherwise. And what could have been more fit to have confuted the large
dominion and superiority of our realm, than that that Jerome says, when he
appoints the Bishops sea in an vplandish town, or in a poor village or
hamlet, Untrue.
declaring thereby that in every town there was a Bishop, and that the Bishop
that he speaks of, differs nothing at all from an elder, but that the
Bishop had the ordeyning of ye ministers, whereupon it does appear (which I
promised to show) that by this place of Jerome, there is neither name of
Archbishop, nor so much as the shadow of his authority, and that the
Bishops which are now, have besides the name, no similitude almost with
the Bishopes that were in Ieromes time. As for his reason ad Luciferanos, it is
the same which he has ad Euagr. and to Titus, and is already answ^red.

Io. Whitgifte.
If this be true that you say, why have you then hitherto sought so to deface
this worthy writer? why did you not in the beginning tell us, that this saying
of Jerome made nothing against you, because he only speaks of Pastors in
several parishes, and not of one to have charge and government over one whole
dioces? But full Ieromes bishop differs from an elder in dignity and rule.
Hier. in Tit. 1.
well knew you the vanity of this your fancy, and how unlike it is to stand
with Ieromes words: For in his commentaries upon ye epistle to Titus, he says
that Postque v^usquisque eos quos baptizauerat. etc. After that every one did
think those to be his, and not Chri stes, whom he had baptized, it was decreed
throughout the whole world, that one of the ministers being chosen should be
set over the rest, unto whom the whole care of the church should aperteyn,
and the seeds of schisms be taken away. Do you think yt this is meant of the
Pastor of every town? To what purpose should Jerome say so? For the pastor
of every several town, had from the beginning his a^thorite over his flock,
without any such constitution. Moreover, there are not in every several
congregation many pastors or priests, over whom one should be placed as chief.
But Jerome speaks of a Bishop that must govern the other Priests, and
procure that unity be kept among them, and therefore his jurisdiction must of
necessity extend to many parishes, because it is over many pastors. He says
likewise, that the care of the whole was committed unto him. In his epistle ad
Euagrium, he utters his meaning as plainly, For he says, That the Priests
did choose one among themselves, whom they placing Ide^ ad Eu^gr.
in a higher degree called a Bishop: Whereby it apeareth yt he had authority
over many Pastors, and therefore over many congregations, for you will not deny
but that every presbyter, that is minister of the word had his several
flock. This he declares more evidently by the examples there used, of
soldiers choosing their Captain, for though the Captain before was a common
soldier, yet now being ^hus preferred, he rules and governs the rest of
the soldiers, even so the Bishop being before a minister equal with other,
yet being chosen to that degree, he is their guide and gouernoure, a governor
I say of those that did elect him, that is it of Priests or ministers, and
therefore of diverse congregations.

This does yet more euidentely appear in these words of the same Epistle,
That one was afterward chosen to rule the rest, it was a remedy against
schisms, least every one drawing to himself the Church, should break the
same. And in his book Ibidem. Idem contr^ Lucifer.
contra Luciferianos, he says that except the chief authority were given to
one, tot essent schismata quot sacerdotes, there would be as many schisms as
priests. By which places it is certain that Ieromes meaning is to have some one
in a province or dioces over the rest (proprely called a Bishop) who should
have chief authority, least every man in his own several parish being
permitted to do what he list, might in the end fill the Church with schisms,
vt tot essent schismata quot sacerdotes. And surely it is impossible to
expound Jerome otherwise.

But you ask me, what this helps for the Archbishop. etc? very much. For if
it be so necessary to have one Bishop over diverse Priests in every several
dioces, for the avoiding of schism and contention, it is also necessary in
every province to have an archbish^p for the direction of diverse Bishops, and
the avoiding of schism among them. And therefore says Jerome again in his
epistle ad Rusticu^ monachu^, every ecclesiastical Hiero ad Rusticum.
order is subject to her governors.

You ask what could have been brought more strong to pull down the Archbishop
out of his throne, than that which Ierom says there, when he affirms that
the bishop of the obscurest village or hamlet, has as great authority and
dignity as the bishop of Rome? I answer, that this nothing at alderogateth
from the Archbishop. For it is not denied, but that every bishop, and every
minister are equal quoad ministerium, but not quoad ordinem and politiam: and
this is that which Jerome says, eiusdem sunt meriti and sacerdotij, they be of
the same merit and priesthod yt is, their ministry and office in preaching
the word, and administering ye sacraments, is al one. And their authority also
toward such as were under their iu^isdiction: Metropolitanes etc. in Jerome his
time.
but he does nor say, ye one Bishop has not more ample and large jurisdiction
tha^ the other, for the contrary of that is manifest. And in S. Ieroms time
there were Metropolitanes, Archbishops. etc. as you may read in the defe^se of
the Apol. edit. 2. page 121.

These obscure towns do derogate nothing from the authority of a bishop: for
we see it oftentimes come to pass, yt the Bishops seat is but in obscure
towns, as it is in diverse places of England: and yet is the bishops
jurisdiction in his dioces no whit the less. If we respect the places,
Canterbury is far inferior to London. And therefore Ieroms meaning is, yt the
place neither adds any thing, or takes any thing away from the worthiness,
authority, and office of a Bishop. Wheresoever a Bishop is in city or in
town, he is of the same authority and worthiness.

Erasmus in his Scholies upon that epistle of Hierome has these words: Certe
Metropolitanus Erasmus.
habet aliquid dignitatis etc. Surely the Metropolitan has some dignity and
iurisdi^tion above the other bishops, therefore that he here makes the Bishops
of base cities equal with the rest, it is to be referred unto the deacons,
which in some places were preferred before the ministers, whom he does in a
manner make equal with Bishops. And in an other place he says, that the
ministers, succeed into the place of the Apostles, the Bishop into the place of
Christ. In this thing therefore are Bishops and ministers equal, that
wheresoever they are, they are to be preferred before Deacons. Here Erasmus
speaks in good earnest howsoever he iested before. He she weth that these
obscure villages or hamlets (as you term them) were cities, and no doubt, as
good as either Ely, or Peterborough: but in the respect of Rome, contemptible,
as these be in respect of Lonto^. And yet the Bishops of every one of them
eiusdem meriti and sacer dotij. of the same merit, priesthood and authority.
Erasmus also here tells in what respect he has made this comparison betwixt
Bishops and other ministers, in the respect of Deacons. For both Bishops and
Priests are to be preferred equally before Deacons, because of their ministry
and office, which is above the office of a Deacon. Nam ex Diacono ordinatur
presbyter. For a minister or priest is made of a Deacon, not ex presbytero
diaconus, the Deacon of the priest. It is most evident (neither can it be so
unknown unto you) ye Jerome in all these places means to have one bishop
governor of many priests. And therefore this interpretation of yours is
without all probability, or shadow of truth, that Hieromes meaning is to have
such a Bishop in every town.

I trust the reader will note with what vain reasons you first went about to
shake The shift of T. C. in his answer to Hierom.
the credit of this writer: Then, how without reason, you took upon you to
answer his reasons: and now in the end, how impossible an interpretation you
feine of his words: which if he well consider, he shall note in you great
audacitie, small judgment, and no truth. For the author is of great learning
and worthynesse, his reasons strong, and his words plain and evident for the
authority of the Bishop over the rest of the Clergy.

Chrysostom writing upon the twentieth of Mathevve says, that Chrysostom,
the rebellious nature of man caused these distinctions of degrees, that one.
should be an Apostle, an other a Bishop, an other a minister, an other a lay
man. And that unless there were such distinctions of persons, there could
be no discipline.

And upon the. 13. to the Romans he says, that because equality enge^dreth
strife and conte^tion, therefore superiority and degrees of persons were
appointed.

T. C. Page. 83. Sect. 1.
What is that to the purpose, that Chrysostom says, there must be degrees?
who denies that there are degrees of functions? we confess there is, and
ought to be a degree of pastors, an other of Doctors, the third of those which
are called Elders, the fourth of Deacons. And where he says, there should be
one degree of Bishop, an other of a minister, another of the lay man, It
proves that there are degrees among ministers of the word, which you deny.
what proves that for the office of an Archbishop, which is your purpose to
show? how often times must you be called ad Rhombum? and that he means
nothing less, than to make any such difference between a bishop, and a
minister, as is with us, which you would feign make your reader believe, I
will send you to Chrysostom, upon the third chapter. 1. Epistle to Timothy,
where he says: the office of a bishop differs little or nothing from an
Elders, and a little after, that a bishop disierreth nothing from an Elder or
minister, but by the ordination only. Still M. Doctor goes forward in killing
a dead man, that is in confuting that which all men condemn, and proving that
which no man denye^h, that there must be superioritte amongst men, and that
equality of all men alike confounds all, and overthrows all.

Io. Whitgifte.
Chrysostom in that place makes degrees in the ministry, and places the
Bishop in degree above the minister, which utterly overthrows your equality.
As for your distinction of degrees it has a small ground in the scripture to
warrant it, as can be, and in deed it is but your own inue^tion. For the
Pastor, doctor, and elder in office are all one, as the most and best writers
thinck. Howsoever it is, you have them not thus distinguished in the Scripture,
that the Pastor should be first, the Doctor next, the Elder third, and the
deacon last: and it is strange that you will invent a new order of ministers,
without the express warrant of Gods word, misliking the same so much in
other.

This superiority that Chrysostom talks of, overthrows that part of the
Admonition that I confute, for they do not only disallow the office of the
Archbishop, but of the Bishop also, and would have a mere equality among the
ministers: this I refel, as well as the other: and indeed the overthrow of
this, is the overthrow of the other. And therefore this place of Chrysostom
serves my turn very well, and aptly.

Chrysostom upon that. 3. chapter of the first to Timothy, gives as much
superiority to the Bishop as I do: and makes as much difference betwixt him
and the minister: for I grant that quoad ministerium, they be all one, but yt
there be degrees of dignity, and so says Chrysostom, that there is little
difference betwixta Bishop and a priest, but that a Bishop has authority to
ordain priests, and all other things that the Bishop may do, the priest also
may do, that excepted: so that Chrysostom here speaks only of the ministry
of the Bishop, not of his authority, in the ecclesiastical government, for of
that he spoke in the place before alledger, where he says that In: 20. Math.
there is one degree of the Bishop, and other of the minister. etc. which
distinction of degrees was long before Chrysostomes time, as I have declared.

To prove these degrees of superiority among ministers, is to prove ye which
both the Admonition, and you deny, and which is the ground of this
controversy: and therefore I have not herein gone about to kill a dead man
except you count the ground of your assertion dead.

If there must be superiority amongst men, and that equality of all men alyke
confounds all, and overthrows (as you confess, and is most true) then
equality of ministers confounds all among them: and therefore it is
requisite, that in that state also there be supe^iours to avoid confusion:
which being granted, what have you to say, either against Archbishops or
Bishops, except you have some new devise of your own? which is not unlike,
because nothing does please you but your own.

Chap. 3. the. 40. Division.
T. C. Page 83. Sect. 2.
This is a notable argument, there must be some superior amongst men, ergo one
minister must be superior to an other: again there must be in ye ecclesiastical
functions some degrees, ergo there must be an archbishop over ye whole province,
or a Bishop over ye whole dioces. And albert M. Doctor takes great pain to
prove yt which no man denies, yet he does it so (...), and so vn^itly, as that
i^ a man had no better proofs than he brings, the degrees of ye
ecclesiastical functions might fall to the ground. For here to prove the
degrees of the ecclesiastical functions he brings in that, that Chrysostom
says there must be magistrate and subject, him that commands and him that
obeys.

Io. Whitgifte.
The argument is good, and follows very well. For as superiority and
government is Superiority convenient among ministers.
necessary in all other states and degrees of men, so is it in ye ministry
also: for ministers be not angels, nor they are not of yt perfection, yt they
may safely be left in their own absolute government. That which Chrysostom in
this place speaks of government in the civil state, the same does he speak in
the. 13. to the Hebrews of ye ecclesias^ical in like manner: for expounding
these words, Parete his qui praesunt vobis. etc. which is understood of
Bishops, he says, that there be three evils which oue^throw the church, and
Chrysostom.
all other societies. The first whereof is, to have no superior, none to rule:
and this he proves by diverse examples, as of a Quier without a Chaunter, an
army of soldiers without a captain, a ship without a master, a ^locke of
sheep without a shepeheard. Now if superiority be so needful among the
clergy, then why may not one Bishop be over one diocese, and one ^rchbishop
over one Province? Wherefore I conclude thus: It is necessary yt among the
cler^ie some should be in authority over the rest and therefore there may be
both Archbishops and Bishops: but I know you will answer yt there may be
government without these degrees: then say I unto you again, stand not so much
in your own c^ceyt, this order is most ancient in the Church, it is confirmed
by the best and noblest Councels, it is allowed by the best learned fathers, it
has the pattern from the practice of the Apostles (a^l which has bin showed
before) it is most meet for this state and kingdom: and therefore be no^ wilful
in a new devise, the trial whereof was never as yet, the manner whereof is
unknown to your self, and the end no doubt mere confusion. Your welfauoured
and (...) speeches together with your accustomed contempt, I omit here, as I
do in other places.

The most therefore that he can conclude of this, for the ministry, is that
there must be minister that shall rule, and people that shall be obedient, and
hereby he can 1. of prove, that there should be any degrees amongst the
ministers and ecclesiastical governors, unless he will say peradventure, that
as there are under magistrates, and a king above them all, so there should be
under ministers, and one minister above all. * But he must remember that it is
not necessary in a common Note this suspicious speech of the kind of
government.
wealth, that there should be one over all: for that there are other good
common wealths, wherein many have like power and authority. And further if
because there is one king in a land above all, he will conclude there should be
one Archbishop over all. I say as I have said, that it is not against any word
of God, which I know (although it be inconvenient) but that there may be one
Caesar over all the world, and yet I think M. Doctor will not say, that there
may be one Archbishop over all the world.

Io. Whitgifte. Why there ought to be superiority among ministers as well as
other. The gouernmente of the church in a Christi^n common wealth ought to
be according to the form there in used.

Yes, I will conclude that there ought to be degrees of superiority among ye
ministers also, because they labor of imperfections as well as other me^ do,
and especally of pride, arrogancy vainglorie, which engender schisms,
heres^es, contentions, as the examples of all times and ages even from the
Apostles to this time declare.

I am persuaded yt the external government of the church under a christian
Magistrate, must be according to the kind and form of the government used in
the common wealth, else how can you make the Prince supreme governor of all
states and causes ecclesiastical? will you so divide the government of ye
Church from the government of the common wealth, that the one being a
monarchy, the other must be a Democratie, or an Aristocratie: this were to
divide one realm into two, and to spoils the Prince of the one half of her
jurisdiction and authority. If you will therefore have the Queen of England
rule as Monarche over all her dominions, then must you also give her leave to
use one kind and form of government, in all and every part of the same: and
so to govern the Church in Ecclesiastical affairs, as she does the common
wealth in civil.

But you say, that I must remember that it is not necessary in a commonwealth,
that there T. C. speaks suspiciously of government.
should be one over all: and I say, that you must remember that in this common
wealth it is necessary, yt one should be over al, except you will tra^sform
as well ye state of ye kingdom as you would of ye church: which is not unlike to
be your meaning, for not long after you add that the common wealth must be
stamed a^cording to ye church, as the hangyngs to the house, and the government
thereof with her government, etc. and not contrary: meaning yt the government of
the common wealth, ought not to be monarchical, but either democratical, or
Aristocratical, because (as you say) the government of the Church ought to be
such. What this in time will breed in this common wealth, especially when it
comes to the understanding of the people, who naturally are so desirous of
innouations, I refer it to the judgment of those that can and ought best to
consider it.

The unlike linesse that is betwixt one Caesar being over all the world, and of
one archbishop being over all the world. I have showed before, they be most
unlike, and yet this is but a frivolous and vain supposition, and M. Calvin in
his Inst. cap. 8. sect. 96. does say, that it is absurdissimum, most absurd.

power to preach the word, to minister the sacraments, that is to say, the word
preached, or the sacraments ministered, is as effectual in one (in respect of
the ministry) as it is in an other. But quoad ordinem and politiam, touching
order and government, there always has bin and must be degrees and superiority
among them. For the church of God is not a co^fused congregation, but ruled
and directed as well by discipline and policy in matters of regiment, as by the
word of God in matters of faith.

Now M. Doctor comes to his old hole, where he would fayn hide himself, and
with him all the ambition, tyranny, and excess of authorttie which is joined
with these functions of Archbishop and bishop, as they are now used: and this
his hole is, that all the ministers are equal with bishops and Archbishops, as
touching the ministry o^ the word and sacraments, but not as touching
policy and government. The Papists use the very self same This distinction is
allowed of those that be sarre from Papistrie.
distinction for the maintenance of the Popes tyranny and ambition, and other
their hierarchy.

M. Doctor has put out the mark and concealed the name of the Papists, and so
with a little change of words, as it were with certain new colors he would
deceive us. For the Papists say, that every sir John or hedge Priest has
as great authority to sacrifyce, and offer for the quycke and the dead, and
to minister the Sacraments, as the Pope of Rome has, but for government, and
for order, the Bishop is above a Priest, the Archebishoppe above a bishop,
and the Pope above them all. But I have You have no^ yet declared (...),
neither can you.
declared before out of the Scriptures, h^we vain a disrinction it is: and it
appears out of Cyprian, that as all the Bishops were equal one to another,
so he says that to every one was given a portion of the Lords flock not only
to feed with the word and sacraments, but to rule and govern, not as they
which shall make any account unto an archbishop, or be judged of him, but as
they which can not be judged of any but of God. And Jerome upon Cituz says,
that the elder or minister But you con (...) that which follows.
did govern and rule in common with the Bishops, the Church whereof he was
elder or minister.

Io. Whitgifte. The distinetion (quoad ministerium, and quoad ordinem)
tustisyed. Calvin. Beza. Lib. con. cap. 7 art. 12.

The distinction is good and true, allowed of the best writers, though the
Papists wrongfully apply it. M. Calvin upon the 2. Cor. 10. has the same
distinction. Quamuis (says he) commune sit omnibus verbi ministris idemque
officium, sunt tamen honoris gradus: Although there is one office common to all the ministers of the word, yet are there degrees of ho nour. M. Beza likewise
lib. conf. cap. 7. says thus: that pastors in process of time were distinct into
Metropolitanes, Bishops, and those we now call curates, it was not in
therespect of the ministry of the word, but rather in respect of
jurisdiction and discipline. Therefore concerning the office of preaching the
word and administrating the Sacraments, there is no difference betwixt
Archbishops, Bishops, and curates. etc. The same distinction does Hemingius use
in his Enchiridion, (...) the. 72. (...) of this chapter.
as shall be seen hereafter. What say you now? is this a starting hole, or
rather a true distinction, allowed by such as are far from Papistrie? except
you will accuse M Calvin and Beza for Papists. You are not able to improve this
distinction with all the learning you boast of: and bitterness of words will
not carry away the matter.

You have declared nothing tending to the improuing of this distinction, and
the words both of Cyprian and of Hicrom do manifestly confirm it: for they
both would have one chief among the ministers to govern the rest, as it is
said before. You deal corruptly in reciting Hieroms words: for you have left
out his purpose and meaning, I will set them down as they be in deed. Ide^ est
ergo presbyter. etc. Wherefore the minister Heir. ad Tit. 1.
and bishop are al one, and before that through the instinct of the devil,
there were divisions in religion, and that it was said among the people, I hold
of Paul, I of Apollo, and I of Cephas, the churches were ruled in common by
the counsel of the ministers: But after that every one accounted those whom he
baptized to be his, and not Christ's, it was decreed thorowout the whole world,
that one being chosen from among the ministers should be placed over the rest,
to whom the whole care of the church should appertein, and the seeds of
schisms be taken away. Will you not leave off to deal thus guilefully with
your Reader? have you no care to deal plainly and simply? Jerome in that place
verifieth this distinction, and she weth that it was for order and policy,
that among the ministers there was one bishop appointed, ad que^ omnia ecclesiae
cura pertineret, and schismatu^ semina tollere^tur. And what can be spoken more
directly to the purpose? But one thing here I note, that you would be controlled
of none but of God, that is, you would be exempted from all authority of man,
even as the Pope himself is.

After follows M. Calvin, a great patron forsooth, of the Archbishop, or of
this kind of bishop, which is used amongst us here in England. And here to
pass over your strange citations and quota tions which you make, to put your
answerer to pain, sending him sometimes to Musculus common places for one
sentence, to Augustins works, to Chrysostoms works, to Cyril, to M. Fox, and
here sending him to ye. 8. chapter of ye Institutio^s ^.
as though you had never red Caluins institutions, but took she sentence of
some body else, without any examination, whereby it seems that you were
loath, that ever any man should answer your book, letting I say all this pass:
what makes this either to prone, that there should be one Archbishop over all
the ministers in the province, or one Bishop over all in the diocese, that
amongst twelve that were gathered together into one place, there was one which
ruled the action for which they met.

Io. Whitgifte. A practis worcester thy the noting

This is to be obserned throughout your whole book, as I have noted in other
places, that when any authority is alleged that pincheth you, then you fall
to cauilling by and by I have no where referred you to Justinians code, to
Gratians decrees, to Augustines works, to diverse councels, to Theodorete, to
the centuries. etc. Without noting either book, Chapter, distinction, number,
Canon, or such like, as you usually deal with me: and yet these be far more
tedious to read over, than is the. 8. Chap. of Caluines Institutions. I do not
remember that I referred you to Augustine, Chrysostom, or any other writers,
for any matter in controversy (Cyrill, Museulus, and M. Fox only in one
place excepted) but I quoted the places, as particularly as I coule. And why
will you then so untruly report of me? undoubtedly I never red a book for the
quantity of it, so pestered with slanderous reports, false accusations, and
contentious deriding speeches, as this your book is. But let it go. Diverse
editions of Caluines institutions.


This book of institutions which is distinguished into Chapters and not into
books, I red and noted thorough before you (as it should seem) knew whether
there were any such book or no, and because I have labored in it, noted it,
and am well acquainted with it, therefore I use it, and follow it, and so will
I do still: Neither are you ignorant I am sure, that there be sundry editions
of those institutions: although you seem to dissemble the matter in this
place, I might say of purpose (for you have answered after your manner places
before, out of the same book quoted in like manner) but let it be of
ignorance, you take occasion by it, to utter your cynicall (...), but to your
own shame.

The place alleged makes much for my purpose, for it proves superiority to
have (...) among the Apostles, and therefore that it may be among ministers,
which you deny* and I affirm: which also being granted (as it cannot be
denied) whatsoever I affirm either of Archbyshops or Bishops, will soon be
proned. But let us hear the proof of this new devise of yours in soluting
this, and such like places: that one ruled the action. etc.

Chap. 3. the. 44. Division.
T. C. Page. 84. Sect. 3.
And that it may appear what superiority it is, which is lawful amongst the
ministers, and what it is that M. Calvin speaks of, what also the fathers
and councels do mean, when they give more to the Bishop of any one Church,
than to the elder of the same Church, and that no man be deceived by the name
of gouernoure, or ruler over the rest, to fansic any such authority and
domination or Lordship, as we see used in our Church, it is to be understood,
that amongst the pastors, elders and beacons of every particular Church, and in
the meetings and companies of the ministers, or elders of diverse Churches This
is a devise never hard or before.
there was one chosen by the voices and suffrages of them all, or the most
pare, which did propound the matters that were to be handied, whether they were
difficulties to be soluted, or punishments and censures to be decreed upon
those which had faulted, or whether there were elections to be made, or what
other matter soever occasion was given to entreat of: the which also gathered
the voices and reasons of those which had interest to speak in such cases,
which also did pronounce according to the number of the voices which were
given, which was also the mouth of the rest, to admonish, or to comfort, or to
rebuke sharply, such as were to receule admonishment, consolation, or rebuke,
and which in a word did moderate that whole action, which was done for the time
they were assembled. Which thing we do not deny, may be, but affirm that it
is fit and necessary to be, to the avoiding of confusion.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is spoken of your own head, and a devise without proof or reason
as yet, and contrary to the testimonies of all histories, Councels and fathers:
affirmed by no learned writer, as it may appear by that which I have hitherto
alleged out of the canons attributed to the Apostles, the Council also of
Nice, Antioch, Arelat, Carthage, Calcedon, likewise out of Cyprian, Eusebius,
Epiphanius, Athanasius, Gregory Nazian. Ambrose, Jerome, Socrates, Sozom.
Theodoret, Calvin, Illiricus: All which manifestly declare that the office of
an Archbishop, and jurisdiction of a Bishop is permanent, and affixed to
certain places, not moveable, nor during one action only. And undoubtedly I
maruayle what urges you to such absurd and unlearned paradoxes: unless it be
ignorance and lack of reading. But let us hear your reasons.

Chap. 3. the. 45. Division.
T. C. Page 84. Sect. 3.
For it were an absurd hearing that many should at once attempt to speak.

be done without great reproach, that many men beginning to speak, some should
be bidden to hold their peace, which would come to pass, if there should be
no order kept, nor none to appoint when every one should speak, or not, to put
them to silence, when they attempted confusedly to speak, and out of order.
Moreover when many ministers meet together, and in so great diversity of
gifts as the Lord has given to his Church, there be found that excel in
memory, facility of tongue, and expedition or quickness to dispatch matters
more than the rest: and therefore it is fit, that the brethren, that have
that dexterity, should especially be preferred unto this office, that the
action may be the better, and more speedily made an end of.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely and your devise of saluing it, is as absurd: for there would be as
great contention at such elections, as there is confusion in the former
equality: and the rather because there is none to direct them therein. For who
shall call them together before this election be made? where shall they meet?
who shall declare unto them the cause of their meeting? or what remedy if they
cannot agree of some one that has this dexterity, but are drawn into diverse
parts, some thinking one most meet, and some another, other some the third.
etc? how if there be sects and schisms among them, as there is at this time?
an hundredth inconveniences are there in this devise of yours: and to tell you
the truth, it may be used in places where there is no government, no laws, no
form of a common wealth, no order: But in a kingdom, in a Church under civil
government, in a place of order. etc. it is the very high way to subversion and
confusion.

Chap. 3. the. 46. Division.
T. C. Page 85. Sect. 1.
And if any man will call this And what scripture hau^ you for this*
a rule or presidentship, and him that executes this office ^ president or
moderator, or a governor, we will not strive, so that it be with these
cautions, that he be not called simply governor, or moderator, but governor
or moderator of that action, and for that time, and subject to the orders that
others be, and to be censured by the company of the brethren, as well as
others, if he be judged any way faulty. And that after that action ended, and
meeting dissolved, he sit him down in his old place, and set himself in
equal estate with the rest of the ministers. Thirdly, that this government or
presidentship, or whatsoever like name you will give it, be not so tied unto
that minister, but that at the next meeting it shall be lawful to take
another, if another be thought meeter.

Io. Whitgifte.
These cautions are meet for such a devise, and apt for a tumultuous company
and a congregation of proud and arrogant persons, that cannot abide any
superiority or government. This I am well assured of, and it is evident both
by that which is already spoken, and that which is to be said herea^ter, that
there can neither pattern nor Bishops governors simply, not of one action
only.
form be found of it in any Church since the Apostles time, recorded in any
writer of credit, but the clean contrary for ecclesiastical writers do both
call Bishops governors simply, and manifestly also declare, that their office
of government was not for one action only, but during their life or at the
least during their continuance in that seat or byshopricke* and it is plain
by that which I have said before, that the office of the Metropolitan (which
was to call Synods, and to moderate them, to ordeyne The (...) the (...) ^ixed

and the. 5. of the general council of Constantinople, the. 12 of the second
council of Carthage, the. 21. Concilij Mileuitani: the. 11. of the general
council of Chalcedon: to be short all these testimonies and examples alleged
of me before, out of Cyprian. etc. and the continual practice of the Church.
And therefore such new cautions here by you set down, be only meet for such a
strange and misshapen platform and kind of government as is by you and your
faction devised.

Chap. 3. the. 47. Division.
T. C. Page 85. Sect. 2. 3. 4.
Of this order and policy of the Church, if we will see a lively image, and
perfect pattern, let us set before ou^ eyes the most ancient and gospellike
Church that ever was or shall be.

In the first of the Acts the Church being gathered together, for the election
of an Apostle into the place of Judas the traitor, when as the interest of
election belonged unto all, and to the Apostles especially above the rest, out
of the whole company Peter rises up. tells the cause of their coming
together, with what cautions and qualities they ought to choose another,
conceyueth the prayer, whereby the help of God in that election, and his
direction is begged, and no doubt ex^cuted the resi^ue of the things which
perteyned unto the whole action.

In the. ^. of the Acts all the Apostles are accused of dronke^nesse. Peter
answer^d for them all, wypeth away the infamy they were charged with. But you
will say, where are the voices of the rest, which did choose Peter unto this?
What is this but a mere con (...), or ^ather an imagine^ answer o^ your ow^e*
First you must kn^w that the scripture sets not down every circumstance,
and then surely you do Peter great injury, that ask whether he were chosen
unto it: for is it to be thought, that Peter would thrust in himself to this
office or dignity, without the consent and allowance of his fellows, and
prevent his fellows of this preheininence? undoubtedly if it had not bin done
arrogantly, yet it must needs hau^ a great show of arrogancy, if he had done
this without the consent of his fellows. And here you shall hear what the
scholiast says which gathers the judgment of greek diumes, This is not
^poken o^ cho^ing ^eter to be speaker, but of ^lecting Matthias, which pe^eyned
not to Peter alone.
(...) (speaking of Peter) (...). Behold how he does all with their common
consent. And if any man hervpon will say, that Peter exercised domination over
the rest, or gat any ar^hapostleship, beside that the whole story of the Acts
of the Apostles, and his whole course of life does refute that, the same
scholiast which I made mention of in the same place, says he did nothing
(...), imp^riously, nothing (...), with dominion or power: further I will
admonish him to take heed, least if he s^riue so far for the Archbishop, he
slide or ever he be aware into the ^entes of the Papists, which use these
places to prove that Peter had authority, and rule over the rest of the
Apostles.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a rodd to beat your self with, for it is evident even by these
words of yours, that your devise is most farthest from the Apostolical form:
for Peter in all Peter chee^e in Apostolical assemblies.
such assemblies is the chief, speaks the first and moderateth the rest, in
which respect most of the old ecclesiastical writers count him the chief of
the Apos^les, neither do the la^e writers diss^nt from them in that point, and
yet is there no danger of sliding into the Papists tents, who by this would
prove the Popes supremacy, whose arguments you have used, and I have confuted
before.

To prevent subtily that question which neither yo^ do^, nor can answer, that
is, where it is in scripture mentioned that at every action, or at any time
Peter was chosen to speak before the rest, or to govern the action? ^ou say,
that first I must know that the scripture sets not down, every
circumstance, and then that I do Peter great injury that ask whether he were
chosen to it. etc. To the first I answer, that you ought to know, how wicked
and ungodly a thing it is, to ground the alteration of any lawful kind of
g^uernment so long continued, and in the best times of the Church practiced,
upon your own fond devise and conjectures, without any ground of scripture,
yea to make that Peter not cho sen in every action to be chee^e.
your foundation which you cannot find in the whole scripture, but the clean
contrary. For show me one piece of a text that does but insinuate Peter, to
have bin at any time in any action chosen to direct the action: I can show you
the contrary, especially in the second of the Acts, where Peter suddenly
answered with a notable apology in the presence of the Apostles, the
accusation of drunkenness laid against him, and them: neither can it be that
he should expect the voices of the rest, to choose him to be the chief, for
that time in that action.

Whosoever shall well consider the first of the Acts, and the. 15. and other
places where mention is made of Peter's speaking, as he shall perceive that this
was Peter's peculiar office, and always apperteyning unto him, from the
ascensio^ of Christ to his dying day, so shall he also easily understand, that
he was not at any time chosen to that office by voices, much less at every
particular meeting or singular action. And dare you presume upon vain
conjectures, without warrant of scripture, to bild the foundation of your kind
of government, which you before said is a matter of faith and salvation? is
not this to open a way to unwritten veri^ies, and fantastical
interpretatious? if your words be of such weighte with the Reader, that
because you speak them, therefore he will be^aeue them, per me* licebit: but
this I will assure him of, that he shall believe that, that is neither grounded
upon Scripture, nor any learned or aunciente authority.

To the second, that is, that I do Peter great injury. etc. I say that I
do him no injury at all, when I affirm that of him, that the scripture
does, and presume not of mine own brain, for the mainteyning of an evil
cause, to imagine that of him, which I have my self devised besides the word of
God, as you do most manifestly.

Peter did not thrust himself into any office or dignity, which was not
appoyuted unto him by God, neither did he otherwise use himself therein, than
his office and duty required: and it is impiety thus to dally and trifle in
Gods matters. We are w^ll assured in scripture that Peter did this, and had
this pre-eminence, and therefore you must know that he was lawfully called
unto it, and did lawfully execute it.

The Greek Scholiast says, that Peter in such assemblies did conclude nothing
The scholiast plays not ye part which is laid upon him.
without the consent of the rest, the which also the scripture it self does
plainly declare. But the Greek Scholiast no where says that Peter was at
every assembly, or at any time chosen by the voices of the rest, to speak
first, and to moderate the action: which is your assertion. For in the place by
you cited, he speaks not of the election of Peter to his prolocutorship, but
of the choosing of Matthias to the Apostleship. Wherein Peter took not that
pre-eminence to himself to appoint him alone, but communicated the matter with
the rest of the disciples. So that you have either wittingly, or ignorantly
applied the Scholiast to a wrong matter.

It is true that Peter did nothing imperiously, nothing with dominion or power:
no more does any man that executes lawful jurisdiction, and governs by law,
^quitie, and order, no not the king himself: for in superiority there is
humility, and in rule and authority there is servitude: as I have before
showed in the exposition of the places in the. 20 of Matthew. 22. Luke. etc. And
yet does the Greek Scholiast in the same place say, that Peter rose up and not
lames, as being more fervent, (...), Tract. 1.
and as having received the presidentship of the Apostles. Your admo^ishment of
falling into the tents of the Papists, how necessary it is for your self,
which use their manner of reasoning upon this example of Peter, and upon
devised interpretations of the scripture, I have touched before. As for my
self I refuse no warning* But I trust it is not so necessary, for I know what
they have said, and what they can say in that matter.

It is evident by the story of the Acts of the Apostles, that this function
remained to Peter, so long as the Apostles continued together, and that he did
execute the same when soever they met: and therefore it is untrue that this
off^ce was not tied to one man: the. 15. of the Acts helps you nothing: for
even there, Peter keeps his accustomed manner in making the first oration:
and in that place it may appear, that he did it as chief in that assembly,
for the text says, that when there had bin great Acts. 15.
disputation, Peter rose up and said unto them. etc. so that Peter as one
having authority to appease the tumult and bitter contention, rose up and said
unto them. etc. Then spoke Barnabas and Paul, after them, James, not as
moderator or gouer^oure of the whole action, but as one having interest to
speak as the rest of the Apostles had, and because he had spoken that which
the rest well liked of, therefore they consented to his opinion, and judgment.
This is no more to give pre-eminence ^o James in moderating that action, than
it is to give the speakership in the Parliament to him that speaks last in a
matter, and whose oration has most persuaded, ^o whom also the whole house
consents. So that Peter keeps his prerog^tiue still for any thing that is
here spoken to the contrary: which may also evidently appe^re by this, The
of^ice o^ the ^peaker o^ (...).
that when there was great contention among them about the matter, the cause
whereof is like to be, for that they did not understand the state of the cause,
Peter stood up, and in hoc maxim insistit, vt statum quaestionis
demonstraret, and stood especially upon this point, that he might declare the
state of the question, as M. Calvin says, which is the office of the speaker
or moderatour: wherefore not James, but Peter did moderate the action.

But best as you would have it, that James did moderate the action: it makes
most against The example o^ James (...) the Re plyer.
you, for if we believe the ancient writers, and namely the greek Scholiast
upon the. 15. of the Acts, James was now Bishop of Jerusalem: and therefore the
Synod being ^ithin his charge, it was not (...), that he according to his
office, should moderate the same, as other bishops did in their several
Churches.

The. 21. of the Acts is nothing to your purpose, but Paul coming to
Jerusalem, went with certain other in unto James, and told him and all the
rest that were gathered together, what God had wrought among the Gentiles by
his ministration. What is this to prove your purpose? Peter is not here, and
James was now (...) op of Jerusalem, as the note in the margent of the ^ible
printed at Geneua does testify. The place in no respect proves your assertion,
but the contrary: for there is no doubt, but that James was the chief
governor of the Church of Jerusalem in all actions, during his life, after
that he was once placed in the Byshopricke.

You talk in another place of raking of Doctors to prove my purpose, but if
these be not rakings of scriptures, gathered together to no purpose, for the
co^firming of your fond devises, I know not what you should mean by the name
of rakings.

Io. Whitgifte.
Indeed this is one part of the office of the Archbishop and Bishop, but not
the whole, no more than it was of James being Bishop of Jerusalem, nor of him
whom Iustine calls (...): But your chief purpose now is to prove that this
office is not perpetual, but changeable at every action, and durable only
continuing that action, which how soundly you have done, and with what strange
arguments every child that has discretion may judge.

And therefore M. Calvin, does warely say, that one amongst the Apostles
indefinitely, not any one singular person, as Peter, had the moderation and
rule of the other: and further shadoweth out what rule that was, by the example
of the The Archbishop contenteth himself with less authori^ie than the
Co^suls had.
Consul of Rome, whose authority was to gather the Senate together, and to
tell of the matters which were to be handled, to gather the voices, to pronounce
the sentence. And although the Antichrist of Rome had perverted all good order,
and taken all liberty of the Church into his hands, the Cardinals,
Archbyshops, and Bishops, yet there are some cold and light footings of it in
our synods, which are holden with the Parliament: where amongst all the
ministers which are assembled, out of all the whole realm, by the more part of
voices, one is chosen which should go before the rest, propound the causes,
gather the voices, and be as it were the mouth of the whole company, whom they
term the prolocutor. Such great force has the truth that in the utter ruins
of Popery, it could never be so pulled up by the roots, that a man could
never know the place thereof no more, or that it should not leave such marks
and prints behind it, whereby it might afterward recover it self, and come
again to the knowledge of men.

Io. Whitgifte.
It follows in the same place of M. Calvin immediately. Sic nihil absurdi
esset Instit. cap. 8.
si fateremur Apostolos detulisse Petro talem primatum. Sed quod inter paucos
valet non protenus trahendum est ad vniuersum o^bem terrarum, ad quem regendum
nemo vnus sufficit. So should it be no absurdity if we should confess that
the Apostles did give this kind of pre-eminence unto Peter. But yet that
which avails among few, must not by and by be drawn to the whole world,
to the ruling whereof no one man can suffice. You see therefore that M. Calvin
speaks of one singular person, even of Peter him self, and yet does he not
slide into the tents of the Papists, but teaches rather how to beware of
them, and yet to acknowledge the truth of Peter.

We give no greater authority either to Archbishop or Bishop, than the The
example of T. C. against himself. Consuls, and their authority.
Consul, or Praetor had among the Romans, or a Master and president in a
college: for the Consuls (upon whose authority you seem so much to stay)
were appointed to govern the common wealth of the Romans, after they had
banished their kings, and they were called Consuls, quia plurimum reipublicae
consulebant: because they profited the common wealth very much: whose
authority in this did differ from the authority of a king, that there might
be appeal from them, and that they could^ not put to death any citizen of
Rome, without the consent of the people: but they might otherwise punish
them, and ^ast them into prison: They had authorite also to make free th^se
that were in bondage, they were of the greatest honor ( si nullus esset
Dictat^r) if there were no Dictator) in the common wealth, and their authority
was offorce, not only in the Senate, but else where. And it is manifest that
they had not only authority to call the Senate, to tell those matters that
were to be handled, and to take their voices, but to command that none
should depart out of the City, that had any v^yce in the Senate and to
elect Senators. etc. It appears that you little knew what the office of a
Consul was, when you writ this. If you take advantage of this, that the
office of the Consul was annual and not perpetual, yet it helps not you
anything, for he was moderator and ruler not of one action only, but of so
many, as were by occasion, either ordinary, or extraordinary in the whole
year of ^ys Consulshyp. For my part I do not think that the Archbishop,
either has, or ought to have that authority in his province, that the Consul
had in Rome.

A Master of a College (the which example also Master Calvin does use) has a
Masters of Colleges and their authority.
perpetual office, he is chief governor of that society, and all the
members thereof owe duty and obedience unto him, as to their head: he has
authority to puni^he and to see laws executed: neither do I think that
either Archbishop or Bishop claymeth greater authority and jurisdiction over
their Provinces and Diocese, than is due to the Master within his College.
And therefore those examples of Master Calvin do confute your assertion, they
do in no point confirm it.

In Synodes though there be chosen a prolocutor for the inferior sort of the
Clergy, yet does the Archbishop reteyne still both his office, place, and
authority: even as the Prince does, or the Lord Keeper, notwythstanding it
be permitted to the lower house of Parliament to choose them a Speaker, and
therefore this is nothing, nor alleged to any purpose: except you will say
that in the civil state all was equal, and that there was no superior, but in
eueryaction some chosen by the multitude, to govern the action, because in the
lower house of Parliament they choose a Speaker, whose office continues but
during that Parliament. You pass not what you allege, so you may seem to
allege something.

Now you see what authority we allow amongst the Ministers, both in their

excessive power which now is in the Church, so we are by the grace of God as
far from confusion and disorder, wherein you travel so much to make us to
seem guilty.

Io. Whitgifte.
I see you allow much more authority in words, that is in the examples you
have used, than you will willingly acknowledge: I see also that this
authority, which you call tyranny and excessive, is moderate and lawful,
and according both to the laws of God and man. To conclude, I see that you
are as far from order, and a right form of government, as you are from
modesty and due obedience, and that the end you shoot at, is nothing else
but a mere confusion, not only of the Church, but of the common wealth
also: the government whereof you would have framed, according to your platform
of the Church: that is, you would have it brought from a Monarchy, to a
popular or Aristocraticall kind of gouernmente, even as you would have the
Church.

Paul was superior both to Timothy and Titus, as it may easily be gathered

T. C. Page. 86. Sect. 3.
M. Doctor reasons again, that Paul an Apostle, and in the highest degree

was superior to Timothy and Titus Evangelists, and so in a lower degree of
ministry, therefore one Minister is superior to another, one Bishop to
another Bishop, which are all one office* and one function. As if I should
say my Lord Mayor of London is above the Sherifes, therefore one Sheriff is
superior to another.

There was no difference betwixt them in respect of preaching the Gospel and

administering the sacraments, but in respect of government, therefore among
Ministers of the word, and Sacraments there may be degrees of dignity, and
superiority, and one may rule over another: which is the ground of my
assertion, and the overthrow of yours. And this does the example of Paul prove
evidently, even as the example of my Lord Mayor does prove, that there is
superiority in government among the Citizens. For thus you should have
reasoned: as my Lord Mayor his authority above the rest of the Citizens,
declares, that there is superiority in the civil state, and one subject to
another, even so Paul's superiority over Timothy, Titus, and other Ministers
declares, that there may be superiority in the state Ecclesiastical, and
that one of them may and ought to be subject to another: thus you should have
applied the similitude if you had truly applied it.

Again another argument he has of the same strength. Titus being an
Evangelist was superior to all the pastors in Crete, which was a degree under
the Evangelists, therefore one (...)* must be superior unto another pastor. And
that he was superior he proves, because he had authority ordeine pastors: so
that the print of the Archbishop is so deeply set in his head, that he (...)

Io. Whitgifte.
Titus was a Bishop as it shall be proved: and you have not one word in

men, that imagine Titus, to have been Archbishop of Creta: scoff at them.

Chap. 3. the. 54. Division.

I have showed before, how these words are to be taken of Saint Paul. And
for so much as M. Doctor burdeneth us with the authority of Calvin so often,
I will send him to Caluines own interpretation upon this place, where he You

shows that Titus did not ordeyne by his own authority: For Saint Paul
would not grant Titus leave to do that which he himself would not, and
shows that to say that Titus should make the election of Pastors by
himself, is to give unto him a princely authority, and to take away the
election from the Church, and the judgment of the insufficiency of the
Minister from the company of the pastors, which were (says he) to profane
the whole government of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is to set Calvin against Calvin, and not to answer him: and yet this
is nothing contrary to that which I have alleged out of him: for in the
place that I have alleged he gathers upon these words vt constituas
oppidatim presbyteros. The shifts of the Replyer*
etc. that there was not such equality among the Ministers of the Church,
but that one both in authority, and Council did rule over another. You to
avoid this testimony of Calvin for superiority, tell me that Calvin says
upon this place, that Titus did not ordeyne Ministers by his own authority.
etc. which is no answer to the place that I have alleged, but a very
quarrel pickte out, to avoid the answering of it. Master Calvin says that
among the Ministers there was one ruled over another, authoritate and consilio:
by authority and Council. And he does gather it out of the text by me
alleged: either answer it, or give place unto it, or deny it. Of electing
Ministers I have spoken before, it is now out of place to speak of it again,
and it is to no purpose, but to shift of an Answer.

Chap. 3. the. 55. Division.
T. C. Page 86. Sect. 5.
I marvel therefore what M. Doctor means, to be so busye with M. Calvin,
and to seek confirmation of his Archbishop and Bishop at him, which would
have shaken at the namyng of the one, and trembled at the office of the other,
unless it be because he would feign have his plaster, where he received his
wound. But I bare assure him, that in his garden he shall never find the
herb that will heal him. And because that the Scriptures, when they make for
our cause, receive this answer commonly, that they served but for the
Apostles times, and Master Caluines authority will weye nothing as I think
with M. Doctor, when he is alleged by us against him, I will send him to the
Greek S choliast, which upon this place of Titus says after this sort. He
would not (speaking of Saint Paul) have the whole Isle of Crete, ministered
and governed by one, but that every one should have his proper charge and
care: for so should Titus have a lighter labor and the people that are
governed, should enjoy greater attendance of the pastor, whylest he that
teaches them does not run about the gouernmente of many congregations,
but attends unto one and garnisheth that.

Io. Whitgifte.
What opinion Master Calvin has of Archbyshops, and of Superiority amongst
Pastors and Ministers, may appear in his words that I have alleged in my
Answer. I think Master Calvin never uttered in word or writing his
mislyking of the present gouernmente of this Church of England, by
Archbyshops and Bishops, what he has spoken against the abuse of them in the
Popes Church, is not to be wrested against the right use of them in the true
Church of Christ.

I have answered the Scriptures by you alleged, truly, and directly. You have
not as yet urged me with that authority of Master Calvin, that I have so
shifted of, as you have done this last.

The Scholiast means that every City should have his Pastor, in the Isle of
Creta, and that Titus should govern them as Bishop, not as having the whole
Titus Archbishop.
and sole charge of every several town or City: which may evidently appear
to be true, by these words of Theodoret placed in the same author. Titus was a
notable Diseiple of Paul, but was ordained Bishop of Creta, which was a very
large Isle, and Theodoret. in arg. Epist. Tit. apud Scholiast.
it was permitted and committed unto him, that he might ordeine (...), Bishops
that were under him. Whereby it may be gathered that every City in Creta had a
Bishop, which had the several charge, and that Titus governed them as
Archbishop. The like does Chrysostom (whom the Greek Scholiast does
especially follow) affirm of Timothy in. 1. Tim. 5. upon these words
aduersus presbyterum. etc. Timotheo credita fuerat ecclesia, imo gens fere tota
Asiatica: The Church, yea almost Chrysostom.
the whole people of Asia was committed to Timothy. But what need I use many
words, when Chrysostom himself affirms the same directly of Titus. 1. Idem.
ad Titum: neque eius profecto illi. etc. Truly Paul would not have
committed the whole Isle to him, neither would he have commanded those things
to be supplied which were wanting, (for he says that thou myghtest correct
those things which are wanting) neither would he have committed unto him the
Judgment of so many Bishops, if he had not trusted him very well.

Chap. 3. the. 56. Division.
T. C. Page. 87. Sect. 1.
Now M. Doctor may see by this, that Titus was not as he fansyeth, the
Archbishop of all Crete: but that he had one flock, whereupon for the time he
was there, he attended, and that where it is said he ordained Ministers: it is
nothing else but that he was the chief, and the moderator in the election of
the ministers, as I have declared before by many examples. And it is no
marvel, although the rest granted him this preheunnence, when he had both
most excellent gifts, and was a degree above the Pastors, being an Evangelist.

Io. Whitgifte.
This I may see, that first you have no conscience in falsifying and
corruptyng of authors: Secondly, that you speak contraryes, even in these few
lines: for you say that Titus had one flock in Creta, whereupon he did
attend for the time he T. C. contrary to himself.
was there* which must needs prove him to be a Pastor: and yet you
afterward deny him to be a Pastor, affirming him to be an Evangelist, and
you take the office of an Evangelist to be so distinct from the office of a
Pastor, that they may not meet together in one man. Thirdly, I see that you
confidentlye take upon you, to expound Paul's meaning against his plain
words, and against the Judgment of the old interpreters, and diverse of
the new, as I have showed before in the election of Ministers. Besides these,
I see nothing answered to this example of Titus.

Chap. 3. the. 57. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 72. Sect. 3.
Timothy bare rule over all the other Ministers of the Church Timothies
authority*
of Ephesus: for Paul says unto him. 1. Timo. 5. aduersus presbyterum
accusationem. etc. Against a Minister receive no accusation, unless there be
two or three vvitnesses. In which words Paul makes him a Judge over the rest
of the Ministers.

T. C. Page. 87. Sect. 2.
Unto the place of Timothy, where he wylleth him not to admit an accusation
against an Elder, under two or three witnesses, I answer as* I have done
before to the place of Titus: that is, that as the ordination of the Pastors is
attributed unto* Titus, and Timothy, because they governed, and moderated that
action, and were the first in it, so also is the deposyng, or other censures
of them, and that for as much as he writes his Epistles unto Timothy and
Titus, he tells them how they should behave them selves in their office,
and does not shut out other from this censure and Judgment. And it is more
agreeable to the inscription of the Epistles that he should say admit not
thou, or ordeyne not thou, writing unto one: than if he should say ordeyne
not ye, or admit not ye, as if he should write to many, for so should
neither the endyng agree with the beginning, nor ye myddest with them both. And
if this be a good rule, that because Paul byddeth Timothy and Titus to Judge
of the faults of the pastors, and to ordeyne Pastors, therefore none else did
but they: then A meeres* uill.
whereas Saint Paul byddeth Timothy that he should command, and teach,
that godliness is profitable to all things, and admonishes him to be an
example of the whole flock, by your reason he will have no other of the
Ministers of Ephesus, or of the Isle of Creta, to teach that doctrine, or to
be examples to their flocks, and an hundredth such things in the Epistles of
Timothy and Titus, which although they be there particularly directed unto
Timothy and Titus, yet do they agree, and are common to them, with all other
Ministers, yea sometimes unto the whole flock.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have certain common shifts, to put of such places as you can not
answer, among which this is one, that you use in this place. But it will not
serve, being grounded neither upon authority nor reason. These words of
Saint Paul in deed be not spoken to Timothy alone, but to all other Bishops
of like authority: for that which is prescribed to Timothy is also
prescribed to all other in the like function, which argues that this
authority given to Timothy over all the Ministers of the Church of Ephesus,
does perteyne also to all other Bishops, over the Ministers of their
several Diecesse. But as Saint Paul in these Epistles writes only to
Bishops, and Pastors, so are the precepts given therein properly perteyning
to the office of Bishops and Pastors, and therefore not to be wrested to any
other. And how can the Papists more grossly abuse the Scriptures, in
interpretyng them to serve their turn, and to shifte of their authority
alleged against them, than you do in this and such other places, against
the whole scope of the Epistle, and the plain and euidente words of the
text? for what is this, but to give Timothy superiority and government over
the other Ministers of Ephesus, to say unto him, aduersus presbyterum, Against
a Minister receive no occusation etc? and as this authority of Judgment is
not only given unto Timothy, but to all Bishops, of like calling, so that
also of teaching (that godliness is profitable to all things. etc.) perteyneth
to all Ministers of the word generally, and not to Timothy alone. This is
only the difference, that the first is common to Timothy with all other
Bishops of like jurisdiction: the other common to him with all other ministers
of the word.

You know that every Pastor, or other Minister of the word, has not other
Pastors and Ministers of the word under him, that it may be said unto him
aduersus presbyteros. etc. as it is here said to Timothy, for I have proved
before that presbyter does signify the Ministers of the word and
Sacraments, and shall have occasion to speak more of it hereafter.

You say that there is an hundredth such things in the Epistles of Timothy
and Titus* I think that there is not one hundredth several precepts in all
the three Epistles. These stout and hyperbolicall bragges, with so manifest
resisting of the plain sense and meaning of the Scriptures, argues an evil
conscience, and a mind so addicted to error, that it will not be reformed.
Many things in these Epistles perteyne to all Christians, many things be
proper to Bishops, such as Timothy was, and many common to all Ministers. But
this aduersus presbyteros* etc. must needs to proper be those that have under
them other Ministers, committed to their government, which every Pastor has
not.

over the rest, by this self same place.

T. C. Page 87. Sect. 3.
As for Epiphanius, This is your practice to discredit the author that
speaks against you.
it is known of what authority he is in this place, when as by Aerius sides,
he goes about to prick at the Apostle* whilst he goes about to confute the
Apostle, which makes a distinction and difference between those which the
Apostle makes one, that is a Bishop and elder, and to spare the credit of
Epiphanius, it were better lay that opinion upon some Pseudepiphanius, which we
may do not without great probability, seeing (*) Augustine says, that the Ad
quod vult deum.
true Epiphamus utters all after a story fashion, and does not use any
disputation, or reasoning for the truth against the falsehood, and this
Epiphanius is very full of arguments and reasons, the choice whereof M. Doctor
has taken.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have not heard any probable reason alleged of any, why these books of
Epiphanius The writings of Epiphanius contra. 80. haereses, not counterfeite.
should be suspected, whether they be his or no, seeing they be both learned
and very ancient, mentioned also of sundry old writers. But to omit all
other proofs I will only use the judgment (at this time) of the authors of
the Centuries who are to be credited in such matters, because they have
diligently and carefully labored in them: their opinion of these books of
Epiphanius, Cent. 4 cap. 10. is this, Nunc de scriptis. etc. Now we will
speak of his books: of the which that work against Cent. 4. cap. 10.
the four score heresies is most noble: which book he himself in his Epistle
to Acacius, and Paulus Ministers, And in his book called Anacephaleosis,
calls (...). etc. Of the which writing Augustine in his book ad
quod-vult-deum, makes this mention. Our Epiphanius Bishop of Cyrus (says he)
which dyed not long since, speaking of four score heresies, wrote also
himself six Books making mention of all things after an Historical manner,
and disputing nothing either against the falsehood, or with the truth: They be
but short books, and if they were all made in one, yet were it not to be
compared to ours, or to diverse other men's books in length. Out of the which
words it is evident, that Augustine neither had, nor at any time did see that
work which Epiphanius entitled Panarium, for Epiphanius is very long in
recountyng the history, as concerning the beginning, the endeavor and country
of the heretics, the occasion of the heresy, the success, increase, and
such like throughout every heresy. Then is he very long in confuting and
condemning the heresies by true Scriptures, and the interpretation of them:
wherefore it should seem that Augustine had belyke only the arguments prefixed
before the Tomes of books of Epiphanius, which he does therefore call short
books, or at the least, had his book called Anacephaleosis, (which is the
sum of his work called Panarium) Cornarius that writes Cornarius.
the Preface before this book of Epiphanius, is of the same judgment, and
adds these words: Wherefore either Augustine did not see this work of
Epiphanius, or the right work of Augustine is not extant, but lost, or else
Augustine did not in deed perform that which he promised. I can read of
none that doubts whether these books were Epiphanius his, or no. And
certaynely this kind of answering is next the worst, especially when it is
used against such approved authors.

And because all men may understand, what Epiphanius words and reasons be
Aerius here sie in denying the difference betwixt a Be shop and priell* Epi.
li. 3. (...). ^ haeres. 75*
(which in deed pinche you very near, for he calls you heretics) I will
declare them as I have there found them. First he sets down the heresy of
Ae^rius in these words: His talk was more outrageous than beco^med a man: and
he said, what is a Bishop to a Priest? he nothing differs from him: for there
is but one order, and the same honor and dignity. The Bishop lays on his
hands, and so does the Priest: the Bishop ministers baptism, and so does
the priest: the Bishop says divine service, and so does the Priest: the Bishop
sits in his throne, and so does the Priest. In this he has deceived many,
and they use him for their captain. Then does he a little after confute this
heresy with Aerius reasons, on this sort: To say that a Bishop and a Priest
is equal, how can it be possible? for the order of Bishops, is the begetter
of fathers, for it ingendreth fathers to the Church: the order of Priests not
being able to beget fathers, does beget sons to the Church, by the
sacrament of Baptism, but not fathers or teachers: and how is it possible for
him to ordeyne a Priest, not having imposition of hands to elect, or to say
that he is equal with a Bishop? but phantasticalnesse and emulation deceived
the foresaid Aerius: he proves his error, and the error of those that hear
him by this, that the Apostle writ to Priests and Deacons, and did not write
to Bishops. And to the Bishop he says: neglect not the gift that is in thee,
which thou have received by the hands of the Presbytery. And again in
another place he writes to Bishops and Deacons: wherefore (says he) a Bishop
and a Priest is all one: and he knows not, which is ignorante of the sequel
of the truth, and has not read profounde stories, that when the preaching
was but newely begone, the holy Apostle writ according to the state of
things as they were then: for where there were Bishops appointed he writ to
Bishops and Deacons: for the Apostle could not by and by at the first appoynte
all things: for there was need of Priests and Deacons, because by those two,
ecclesiastical matters may be complete. And where there was not any found
worthy a Bishopric, there the place remained without a Bishop, but where
there was need, and worthy men to be Bishops, there were Bishops appointed.
And when there was not so many that there could be found amongst them meet
to be Priests, they were content with one Bishop in an appointed place, but it
is impossible for a Bishop to be without a Deacon, and the holy Apostle had a
care that Deacons should be where the Bishop was, for the ministry. So did
the Church receive the fullness of dispensation, such was then the state and
condition of the places. For every thing had not the perfection from the
beginning, but in process of time those things which were necessary to
perfection were added. etc. The Apostle teaches who is a Bishop, and who is a
Priest, when he says to Timothy that was a Bishop, chide not a Priest, but
exhort him as a father: what should a Bishop have to do, not to chide a
Priest, if he had not authority above a Priest. As he also says again,
against a Priest admit no accusation suddenly, without two or three witnesses,
and he said not to any Priest, admit no accusation against a Bishop: neither
did he write to any Priest, that he should not rebuke a Bishop. Thus may
thou see good Reader, that it is not for naught, that T. C. so storms against
Epiphanius, and so irreverently uses him.

But I will give him as much cause to deal in like manner with Augustine, who
August. ad Quod-vult.
in this matter fully joins with Epiphanius: and in that book of his, de
haeresibus ad quod-vult-deum (quoted by T. C. in his margent) attributes this
also as heresy to the said Acrius, adding that the cause of this and other of
his heresies was, because he himself was not made Bishop.

Chap. 3. the. 59. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 72. Sect. 4.
That this word (presbyter) in this place of the Apostle, signifies a
minister of the word, both Ambrose, Calvin, and other learned writers
declare.

T. C. Page. 87. Sect. 4.
And whereas M. Doctor cites Ambrose, Calvin, and other godly writers, to
prove that the minister is understood by the word Elder or Presbyter, he
keeps his old wont, by bringing sticks into the wood, and proving always
that which no man denies, and yet with the minister of the word, he also
understands the Elder of the Church which rules, and does not labor in
the word: But therein is not the matter, for I do grant that by Presbyter
the minister of the word is understood, and yet nothing proved of that which
M. Doctor would so feign prove.

Io. Whitgifte.
I add this interpretation, that the Reader may understand Timothy to have
authority over Bishops and Ministers of the word, least you by cauilling
should shifte off this place, with your signification of Seniors, which were
not ministers of the word, as you say.

All this while have I looked for the performance of your promise, to prove
that That Timothy was Bishop.
Timothy and Titus were no Bishops: But because I perceive that you are
content to forget it, I will here perform mine (least I fall into the same
fault with you) repeating only that which I have before added to my answer in
the 2. edition, least I should put the Reader both to cost and pains in
searching for it there.

First therefore that Timothy was Bishop of Ephesus, the whole course of the 1
The course of the Epistle.
two Epistles written unto him declares, wherein is contained the office and
duty of a Bishop, and diverse precepts peculiarly perteyning to that function,
as it is manifest: neither were those Epistles written to Timothy for the
instruction of other only, but for the instruction of him self also, as the
whole course of both the Epistles do declare, and all learned expositours
confess.

Secondly, the subscription of the second Epistle is this: (...). 2 The
subscrip tion.
The second (Epistle) was written from Rome to Timothy, who was ordained the
first Bishop of the Church of Ephesus, when Paul appeared before the Emperor
Nero the second time. Which although it be left out in some Greek
Testamentes, yet is it in the most, the best, and the auncientest, yea almost
in all: neither is this a sufficient answer to say, that the subscription of
some one or two Epistles seem to be untrue, therefore this is untrue: For the
subscription, as it is (no doubt) of great antiquity, so is it consonant to al
old ancient authority.

Thirdly, the universal consent of histories conclude him to be Bishop at
Ephesus. 3 Consent of hystories.
Eusebius lib. 3. cap. 4. says, that Timothy was the first Bishop of Ephesus.

Dorotheus who lived in Dioclesians time, writes that Paul made him Bishop of
Ephesus.

Nicephorus lib. 2. cap. 34. says, that Paul made him Bishop of Ephesus,
before he writ his first Epistle unto him.

Hierome in catalog. scripto. Ecclesi. says, that he was made Bishop of
Ephesus by Paul.

Isidorus de Patribus noui Testamenti, says also that he was Bishop of Ephesus.

Antoninus part. 1. titulo. 6. cap. 1. affyrmeth the same out of Polycrates.
So does Supplementum chroni. So does also Volaterane, lib. 20. where he
calls him Praesulem Ephesinum. And all the Histories that I have read, which
make any mention of him.

Historia Magdel. centu. 1. lib. 2. cap. 10. in vita Joan. Euang. has these
words: Constat Paulum Ephesinae ecclesiae Timotheum dedisse pastorem: It is
certain that Paul appointed Timothy Pastor of the Church of Ephesus.

Surely it is the general consent of all hystories, that Timothy was Bishop
of Ephesus.

Fourthly, the fathers affirm the same. 4 Content of fathers.


Dionisius Areopagita (so called of some men) who lived in the Apostles time,
writes his book De diuinis nominibus, to Timothy Bishop of Ephesus.

Epiphanius lib. 3. tom. 1. affirms that Timothy was Bishop of Ephesus.

Ambrose says the same in his Preface to the first Epistle written to Timothy.

Chrysostom in his argument of the same Epistle gives this reason why Paul
of all his Disciples writ only to Timothy and Titus, because he had
committed to them the government and care of the Church: and the other he
carried about with him. The same Chrysostom upon the fourth to the Ephe.
speaking of Pastors and Doctors, uses Timothy and Titus for an example.

Occumenius like wise upon the fourth to the Ephe. calls Timothy and Titus
Bishops. And upon. 1. Timoth. 1. he says, that Paul ordained Timothy Bishop
of Ephesus. And in the fifth Chapter upon these words, Manus cito nemini
imponas. he says, Mandat de ordinationibus, Episcopo enim scribebat: he gives
precepts of ordeyning, for he wrote to a Bishop.

Theodoret, upon the first to Timothy, affirms in plain words, that
Timothy had cure of souls committed unto him.

But to be short, there is not one old writer which speaking of this matter,
does not testify that Timothy was Bishop of Ephesus.

Last of all, I prove him to be Bishop there, by the consent of the late
writers. 5 Consent of late writers.


Erasmus in his annotations, says that Paul made him Bishop: so says he
likewise in his Paraphr. 1. Timoth. 4.

Pellicane says the same. 1. Tim. 1.

Zuinglius in his book called Ecclesiastes, says directly that Timothy was a
Bishop*

Bucer says the same, writing upon the. 4. chapter of the Epistle to the Ephe.

Calvin upon. 1. Tim. 1. calls him Pastor of the Church of Ephesus. And in
the 1. Timoth. 4. expounding these words, Ne donum quod in te est. etc. he
says, Spiritus sanctus oraculo Timotheum destinauerat, vt in ordinem pastorum
cooptaretur: The holy Ghost by oracle did appoint Timothy, that he should be
chosen into the order of Pastors. And in the. 2. Timoth. 4. says, that he did
excel Vulgares pastores, common Pastors. meaning that he was an excellent
Pastor, endued with more singular and notable gifts, and of greater authority
than the common sort of Pastors be. And in the same chapter speaking of Paul's
sending for Timothy from Ephesus to Rome, he says, That there was no small
cause why Paul sent for Timothy from that Church which he ruled and
governed, and that so far off: Hereby we may gather (says he) how
profitable conference is with such men: for it might be profitable to all
Churches, which Timothy might learn in a small time: so that the absence of
half a year, or a whole year, is nothing in comparison of the commodity that
comes thereby. And again in the same place he says, That Paul sent
Tichicus to Ephesus, when he sent for Timothy to Rome, in the mean time to
supply Tymothies absence. By all these places it is manifest that Calvin
takes Timothy to be Pastor and Bishop of Ephesus, as I have beforesayde.

Bullinger upon these words also, ne neglexeris quod in te est donum, etc
notes three things to be observed in the ordering of a Bishop: and proves
thereby that Timothy was lawfully called to his Bishopric. And upon these
words. 2. Tim. 1. Quamobrem co^monefacio te vt suscites donum. etc. he says,
that per donu^ Dei, Paul understands the gift of Prophesying, and
functionem Episcopalem, the office of a Bishop to the which the Lord called
Timothy, but by the ministry of Paul. What can be spoken more playner?

Illyricus in his epistle dedicatorie to the new Testament says, that Paul
praised Timothy his Bishop, and in his Preface to the epistle written to
Timothy, he calls Timothy and Titus praestantes doctores, multarumque
ecclesiarum Episcopos: Notable Doctors, and Bishops of many Churches.

Of the same judgment is Musculus, and all the rest of the late writers that I
have read, one only excepted, who notwithstanding in effect confesses also
that he was Bishop at Ephesus: for in his annotations. 1. Tim. 4. upon these
words, vsquedum venero. etc. he says, that when Paul sent for the ministers
of Ephesus to Miletum. Acts. 20. he sent for Timothy especially. Cuius
ministros (meaning of Ephesus) ac proinde Timotheum inprimis Miletum
accersiuit. But it is manifest Act. 20. that they were all Pastors and
Bishops: therefore Timothy was a Bishop. The same author upon these words. 1.
Timoth. 5. aduersus presbyterum. etc. says, Timotheum in Ephesino presbyterio
tum fuisse (...). 1. Antistite^, vt vocat Justinius. And adds, that it is
manifest by Cyprian, that the Bishop did rule in the College of Seniors. Then
if he that was chief in the College of Seniors, was a Bishop, and Timothy
was chief in the College of Seniors, it must needs follow that Timothy was
a Bishop.

But it may appear how little learning and learned men be esteemed of those,
which to maynteyne contention, are not ashamed to deny that which all
learned men agree upon. The chief reasons to the contrary answered.


Their reasons as in number they be not many, so in substance they be nothing:
I will recite the chief, and leave the rest to children to be discussed.

The first, is taken out of the. 2. Ti. 4. where Paul says to Timothy, Opus
perage 1 The place. 2. Tim. 4. answered. The work of an Evangelist.
Euangelistae: do the work of an Evangelist. Their reason is this: Paul
bids Timothy do the work of an Evangelist, Ergo, Timothy was not Bishop.

First therefore we must search out what Opus Euangelistae is, and then try
whether it be incident to the office of a Bishop, or no.

Bullinger upon that place says, that he does the work of an Evangelist,
which preaches the Gospel purely, and is not by any persecutions or
adversity driven from his calling,

Hemingius says, that opus Euangelistae, generally taken, is to preach the
Gospel.

Musculus in locis commun. ticulo de verbi ministris, says, that he is
Euangelista, either that preaches, or that writes the Gospel, and that Paul
in the first sense speaks to Timothy, saying, opus fac euangelistae.

And in the same place among other things that Paul requires of a Bishop, he
affirms this to be one, vt opus peragat Euangelistae. So says Illyricus
likewise.

Zuinglius also is of the same judgment in his book called Ecclesiastes, and
proves by that text of Paul, that the work of an Evangelist and of a Bishop
is all one. Now how this reason does follow, Paul did bid Timothy preach
the Gospel purely and constantly, Ergo, Timothy was not a Bishop, let every
man judge.

The second reason is taken out of the. 4. to the Ephe. Et ipse dedit alios
quidem Apostolos, 2 The place Ephe. 4. answered.
alios vero Prophetas, alios autem Euangelistas, alios autem pastores ac
doctores: He therefore gave some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some
Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers. The reason is framed on this
sort: An Evangelist and a Bishop were distinct offices, and could not be
both joined in one. But Timothy was an Evangelist, Ergo, he was not a Bishop.
This argument is very feeble in every The mayor false.
part: For first the mayor is utterly false, for those offices named by Paul
were not so distinct, but that diverse of them may concur in one man, as may
easily be proved. Paul was an Apostle and also a Doctor. 2. Timoth. 1. Matthew
and John being Apostles were also Evangelists, as the consent of al writers
does testify.

Timothy was according to M. Beza his judgment both an Evangelist and also a
prophet: Look his notes in the fourth chap. of the first to Timothy.

Zuinglius in his book called Ecclesiastes, says, that an Evangelist is
nothing else but a Bishop or a pastor, as it is manifest (says he) by the
words of Paul which he speaks to Timothy, saying, opus fac Euangelistae,
and Timothy at that time when Paul writ this Epistle unto him, was a
Bishop: And therefore it is certain that according to Faule his sentence, the
office of an Evangelist and of a Bishop is all one. These be the very words of
Zuinglius.

Bullinger expounding this place in the fourth to the Ephe. has these words:
There is no man which sees not these names to be confounded, and one to be
taken for an other: for an Apostle is also a Prophet, a Doctor, an Evangelist,
a Minister, and a Bishop: and a Bishop is an Evangelist and a Prophet: A
Prophet is a Doctor, a Minister, and an Evangelist. Therefore the Apostle Paul
by these sundry names, does signify these diverse gifts which God has
bestowed upon his Church to salvation. And in that he so often uses this
disjunction; alios atque alios, he has signified that all gifts are not given
to one man, but that diverse men have diverse gifts of the spirit, whereof he
has spoken more in the. 12. to the Romans and the. 1. to the Cor. 12. chapter.
Hitherto Bullinger.

Pellicane in the same place is of the same judgment.

These offices therefore or gifts may well concur in one man, so that the
mayor is false, and this conclusion follows not. Timothy was an Evangelist,
Ergo, he was no Bishop.

The minor (which is this, Timothy was an Evangelist) is very doubtful: For
The mind doubtful,
first it may be doubted what an Evangelist is. The common opinion of old
writers, and also of diverse late writers is, that those were properly called
Evangelists which writ the Gospels. Other say, that he is an Evangelist
which preaches the Gospel. Some say that he was an Evangelist that was
occupied in teaching the people plainly and simply. Calvin and some other
think, that they were next unto the Apostles in degree, and helpers of them,
and such as supplied their office oftentimes. Diverse other opinions there are
of Evangelists, and scarce two agree in one opinion touching the office of an
Evangelist. The most say (which also the etymology of the name does
importe) that those were Evangelists which either preached or writ the
Gospel.

Saint Augustine in his second book contra Faustum Manichae. writes hereof
on this sort: Narratores originis, factorum, dictorum, passionum domini nostri
Jesus Christi proprie dicti sunt Euangelistae: They are properly called
Evangelists, which are the declarers of the birthe, deeds, sayings, and
sufferings of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ Which may be done both by
preaching and writing the Gospel, as I said before.

Now if Timothy be an Evangelist because he preached the Gospel, there is no
cause why he may not be a Bishop also. And it is certain that when Paul said
unto him, do the work of an Evangelist, he meant the preaching of the Gospel.

If an Evangelist be taken in any other signification, how can it be proved
that Timothy was an Evangelist? For this proves it not, fac opus
Euangelistae, a man may do the work of an Evangelist though he be not an
Evangelist, a man may do the work of a pastor, though he be not a pastor.

To be short the conclusion is not necessary, howsoever the premises be true,
for The conclu sion not necessary.
although it should be granted that both the mayor and minor were true, yet
the conclusion does not follow: for Timothy might first be an Evangelist,
and after a Bishop, as Zuinglius in his book called Ecclesiastes, says, That
Philip the Evangelist being a Deacon, was afterward Bishop and pastor of
Cesarea: James the younger being an Apostle, as Hierome and all the old
fathers do testify, was after Bishop of Jerusalem, and there remained: and
diverse of the Apostles when they left off going from place to place, became in
the end Bishops, and remained in one place, as it appears in old hystories.

So that although one man could not be both an Evangelist and a Bishop at one
time, and if it be granted that Timothy was an Evangelist, yet does it not
prove but that he was a Bishop also.

But certain it is, that one man at one time might be both an Evangelist and a
Bishop: and most certain it is that Timothy was a Bishop, how certain
soever it be whether he were an Evangelist, or no.

But here it may be said that Timothy no more returned to Ephesus, after he
had bin the second time with Paul at Rome, and therefore not to be like that
he was Bishop there. This argument is only coniecturall, and of no force to
prove any such matter. Howbeit if we will credit stories, whereby in such
cases we must be directed, it is certain that Timothy returned to Ephesus,
and there dyed.

Dorotheus says that he died at Ephesus, and was there buried.

Polycrates testifies that he was stoned to death at Ephesus.

Isidorus in his book de Patribus noui Testamenti, writes that he was buried
at Ephesus in the mount Pyon.

Symeon Metaphrastes testifies the same.

Nicephorus li. 10. ca. (...). testifies, that Julian the Apostara did torment
one Artemius for translating the bones of Andrewe, Luke, and Timothy from
Patra, Achaia, and Ephesus, to Constantinople. But it is certain that Andrew
was crucified at Patra by Aegeas the Proconsull: and ancient writers testify
that Luke was buried in Achaia: therefore the bones that were brought from
Ephesus, must needs be Timothies.

Hereby it may appear that Timothy not only returned from Rome to Ephesus,
but also continued there even to his death. And therefore certain it is that
he was Bishop at Ephesus. But now to my purpose.

Chap. 3. the. 60. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 72. Sect. vlt.
Ignatius who was S. John his scholar, and lived in Christ's Ignatius.
time, in his Epistle ad Trallianos, speaks thus of the authority of a
Bishop over the rest: Quid aliud est Episcopus quam quidam obtinens
principatum, The bishops ^uthoritie.
and potestatem supra omnes? What is a Bishop, but one having power and rule
over all? And in his Epistle ad Smyrnenses, he writes on this sort: Honora
quidem Deum vt authorem vniuersorum and Dominum: Episcopum autem, vt Sacerdotum
Principem, imagi^em Dei ferentem: Dei quidem per Principatum: Christi vero per
Sacerdotium. Honor God as the author and Lord of all things, and a Bishop as
the chief of Priests, bearing the Image of God: of God because of his
superiority: of Christ by reason of his Priesthood. And a little after: Let
lay men be subject to Deacons, Deacons to Priests: and Priests to Bishops,
the Bishop to Christ. And again: Let no man do any thing which perteyneth
to the Church, without the consent of the Bishop. And again: He that
atte^pteth to do any thing without the Bishop, breaks peace, and confounds
good order. The like saying he has in his Epistle ad Magnesianos. These three
Epistles does Eusebius make mention of Lib. 3. cap. 35. and. 36. and Hiero. de
viris illustribus.

T. C. Page 87. Sect. 4.
It is no marvel although you take up the authors of the Admonition for want
of Logike, for you utter great skill your self in writing, which keep no
order, but confound your Reader in that thing which even the common Logike of
the country, which is reason, might have directed you in: for what a confusion
of times is this, to begin with Cyprian, and then come to Jerome and
Chrysostom, and after to the Scripture, and back again to Ignatius that was
before Cyprian: which times are ill disposed of you, and that in a matter
wherein it stood you upon to have observed the order of the times.

Io. Whitgifte.
Be patient a while, the matter is not great, the Authors be known, and the

antiquity of them, my mind is of the matter: and there is reason why I
should^ thus place them. Cyprian tells the necessity of such superiority,
and so does Chrysostom: Hierome, the cause and the original: Paul,
Timothy, and Titus be examples hereof: Ignatius and the rest are brought in as
witnesses of the continuance of such offices and superiority in the Church,
even from the Apostles. Now first to prove the name of these offices not to be
Antichristian, then to show the necessity of the offices, thirdly the cause,
and last of all to declare the use of the same to have been in the Church even
from S. Paul's time to this hour, is to keep a better order, than you shall
be able to disorder, with all the Logike, Rhetorike, and hot Eloquence you
have.

Chap. 3. the. 61. Division.
T. C. Page 87. Sect. 4.
But as for Ignatius place, it is sufficiently answered before, in that which
was answered to Cyprian his place, for when he says the Bishop has rule over
all, he means no more all in the province, than in all the world, but means
that flock and congregation, whereof he is Bishop or minister. And when be
calls him Prince of the priests, although the title be to excessive and big,
condemned by Cyprian and the council of Carthage, yet he means no more the
prince of all in the diocese as we take it, or of the province, than he
means the Prince of all the priests in the world, but he means those
fellow ministers and elders, that had the rule and government of that
particular Church and congregation, whereof he is a Bishop, as the great
churches have for the most part, both Elders which govern only, and ministers
also to aid one an other, and the principality that he which they called the
Bishop had over the rest, has been before at large declared.

Io. Whitgifte.
You very lightly shake of Ignatius words, but they have more pyth in them, if
it please you better to consider of them. For he makes degrees of ministers,
and the Bishop to be the chief: he places Deacons under Priests, and Priests
under Bishops, so that he gives to the Bishop superiority and government over
both Priests and Deacons, which is the ground of this cause: and it being
granted (as it must needs, neither can this authority of Ignatius be
avoided) Aerius Heresy falls, and so does your whole assertion.

What is meant by Prince of Priests, Ignatius himself declares, saying:
Obtinens principatum and potestatem supra omnes: having chieftie and power over
all.

How this name may be well used, I have showed before, where I have also
declared the meaning of Cyprians words, uttered in the heretical Council of
Carthage, and therefore not coumpted in the number of those Councels.

Chap. 3. the. 62. Division.
T. C. Page 88. Sect. 1. 2.
But M. Doctor does not remember, that whylest he thus reasons for the
authority of the Bishop, he overthrows his Archbishop quite and clean. For
Ignatius will have none above the Bishop but Christ, and he will have an
Archbishop.

I see a man cannot well serve two masters, but either he must displease the
one and please the other, or by pleasing of one offend the other. For M. Doctor
would feign please and uphold both, and yet his proo^es are such, that every
proppe that he sets under one, is an axe to strike at the other.

Io. Whitgifte.
I remember it very well: and I know that an Archbishop is a Bishop, and that
therefore there may be superiority among Bishops, and yet nothing detracted
from the words of Ignatius, I know likewise that as well the one as the other
is condemned by you: and I am well assured that the proof of the one is the
proof of the other, and therefore. M. Doctor may well serve two masters, but
they be such as be not only not contrary, one to the other, but so nearly
linked and joined together, that what soever pleases the one, does also please
the other. M. Doctors proppes and proofs are such: as M. T. C. is compelled to
use railing and flouting, in stead of answering, which is a shift, but how
honest and Christian let the world judge.

Chap. 3. the. 63. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 73. Sect. 1.
Justinius Martyr one of the most ancient writers of the Greeks, Iustine
Martyr.
in his second Apology ad Antoninum Pium, allows this superiority, and
calls him that bare rule over the other ministers (...).

T. C. Page 88. Sect. 2.
But that M. Doctor deliteth always where he might fetch at the fountain, to
be raking in ditches, he needed not to have gone to Iustine Martyr for (...),
when as S. Paul calls 1. Tim. 5*
the ministers and Elders by this title. And if this place of Iustine make for
an Archbishop, then in stead of an Archbishop in every province we shall have
one in every congregation. For Iustine declares there, the leyturgie or manner
of serving God that was in every church used of the Christians. And I pray you
let it be considered what is the office of that (...), and see whether there be
any resemblance in the world between him and an Archbishop. For he places his
office to be in preaching, in conceyuing prayers, in ministering of the
sacraments: of any commandment which he had over the rest of the ministers,
or of any such privileges as the Archbishop has, he makes not one word. It
may be that the same might have the pre-eminence of calling the rest together,
and propounding the matter to the rest of the company, and such like, as is
before declared. As soon as ever you found (...), you snatched that by and
by, and went your ways and so deceive your self and others. But if you had
read the whole treatise you should have found that he was (...) of the people,
for thus it is written in the same Apollogie, (...). Afterward bread is brought
to the president of the brethren, calling the people as S. Paul does
continually brethren: And therefore these are Nay, they are yours, and like to
the rest.
M. Doctors arguments out of Martyrs place. There was a minister which did
stand before, or was president of the rest in every particular Church and
congregation, therefore there was an Archbishop over all the province. And
again there was one which ruled the people in every congregation, therefore
there was one that ruled all the ministers throughout the whole province. And
albeit things were in great purity in the days that Iustine lived, in respect
of the times which followed, Antiquum obtinet.
yet as there was in other things which appear in his works, and even in the
ministration of the Sacraments spoken of in that place corruption, in that they
mingled water and wine together, so even in the ministry there began to peep
out some thing which went from the simplicity of the gospel: as that the name
of (...) which was common to the Elders with the ministers of the word, was
(as it seems) appropriated unto one.

Io. Whitgifte.
Though notable and famous doctors be ditches with T. C. yet are they pleasant
and clear rivers with men of more liberal sciences. S. Paul 1. Timoth. 5.
has these words (...). etc. which derogate nothing from any thing, that I
have alleged, but justifies the same, for there it signifies rule and
government, but yet in Iustine it signifies some one that had the chief rule
and government over the rest, as M. Beza notes upon these words, 1. Ti. 5.
Aduersus presbyterum etc. Praeterea Beza.
notandu^ est ex hoc loco Timotheum in Ephesino Presbyterio tum fuisse (...) id
est, Antistitem vt vocat Justinius. Furthermore it is to be noted out of this
place that Timothy in the presbytery, or college of ministers at Ephesus was
(...), that is to say, the prelate or Bishop, as Justinius calls it. You may
say unto him as well as to me, that he deliteth where he might search at the
fountain, to be raking in ditches, because he might have had the same words
spoken of all ministers in the same chapter of that Epistle to Timothy.

Furthermore that Justinius Martyr does use this word for him that has
authority (...) over ministers as well as over the people. Idem.
over the rest, not only of the people, but of such also as be presbyteri: the
same M. Beza testifies upon the first to the Philip. saying: Haec igitur olim
erat Episcoporum appellatio, donec qui politiae causa reliquis fratribus in
caetu praeerat, quem Justinius (...) vocat peculiariter dici Episcopus coepit.
This therefore was the common name of Bishops, until he which for policy
sake did govern the rest in the company, whom Iustine calls (...), began to
be called peculiarly a Bishop. In which words M. Beza testifies that he whom
Justinius called (...) did govern as well the other ministers, as he did the
people. And whosoever does duly consider Iustines words, and peruse that
whole place, he shall easily understand, that those whom he there calls
Brethren, were ministers and Deacons: for afterward speaking of the people, he
calls them by the name of people, as it is there to be seen.

I know that Iustine speaks of their manner of liturgy, but that does not
improve any thing that I have affirmed, for I speak of the name (...), in that
signification that Iustine does use it, which is for one that does govern the
rest. Wherefore this is my Argument, there was one among the ministers in
Iustines time that did rule and govern the rest: Ergo, there was then
superiority among the ministers of the Church, and one was above an other,
which is the overthrow of your ground of equality, at the which I shoot: and
the which being overthrown, the superiority of Bishops and Archbishops is
soon proved. And again I say, that in Iustines time there was one that
governed the rest of the ministers, Ergo, there may be one to do the same now
in like manner. These be my reasons, as for yours they be like to the rest of
your own. But your best refuge is to discredit the Author, which you do in
Iustine, as you have done in the rest. There is no antiquity of any credit
with you, no not in in a matter of History as this is. For Justinius does but
declare the manner used in the Church in his time. It is well, that in the
end you confess this name (...), to signify in Iustine the authority of one
minister: This because you are constrained to acknowledge, you will do it with
nipping and biting the Author, after your manner. Ignatius who was before
Iustine, as you have heard, uses a more lofty word, for he does call him,
Princeps Sacerdotum: the Prince or chief of Priests.

Cyrillus calls him (...). Cyrill.

An other of M. Doctors reasons, for to prove the Archbishop, is that, Cyrill
makes mention of an high priest, where unto I answer, that he that brings
in a priest into the church, goes about to bury our savior Christ: for
although it might be proved that the word Priest were the same with the Greeks
(...), yet (as shall appear in his place) is the use of this word (priest)
for a minister of the Gospel very dangerous. And as for him that brings in
an high priest into the Church, he goes about to put our savior Christ out
of his office, who is proved in the Epistle to the Hebrews to be the only high
priest, and that there can be no more as long as the world endures. And yet if
all this were granted, you are not yet come to that which you desire to prove,
that is an Archbishop. For if you look in In what book *
. Theodoret you shall find this word (...), which signifies the high
priesthood, to be nothing else but a byshopryke and in the seventh chapter of
that book, and so forth diverse times, you shall have (...) taken for a Bishop,
as speaking of the council of Nice, he says that there was 318. (...) high
priests. Now I think you will not say there were 318. Archbishops, if you do,
you are confuted, by all Ecclesiastical writers that ever I read, which
speaking of them calls them Bishops.

Io. Whitgifte.
This name Priest is vsuallly applied to the minister of the Gospel, in all
Histories, fathers and writers of antiquity. And the most of the latest
writers do use it, and make no great serupulositie in it, neither does the name
Priest, bury our Savior Christ, as long as it is used for a minister of the
Gospel: neither is there any danger in it at all, as long as the office is
lawful.

Not only Cyrill uses this name ( high Priest) but Tertull. also in his book
De Tertull.
Baptismo, where he says that Episcopus, is, summus sacerdos, The Bishop is
the hie Priest, and in like manner Theodorete, as you here say, and yet none
of them meant to derogate any thing from the office of Christ.

I told you before how names proper to Christ, may be also attributed to men:
this being granted, I have as much as I desire: for as the Bishop is called
(...) in the respect of other Priests that be inferior unto him, so is the
chief Bishop called Archiepiscopus, in respect of other Bishops that be
governed and directed by him. And as among the ministers there is one chief
which is called a Bishop, so among the Bishops there is one chief also that is
called an Archbishop: and this is that ordo that Augustine speaks of, as I
have said in my Answer to the Admoni^ion, in the words of M. Fox.

of Constantinople, did not only rule that Church, but the Churches also in
Thracia in Asia, and in Pontus.

T. C. Page 88. Sect 4.
Chrysostom follows, which as M. Doctor says, ruled not only the church of
Constantinople, but the churches of Thracia, Asia, and Pontus, and he says it
out of Theodorete. But herein it may appear, that either M. Doctor has a very
evil conscience in falsifying writers, and that in the points which lie in
controversy, Or else you pluck your self by the nose.
or else he has taken his stuff of certain, at the second hand without any
examination of it at all. For here he has set down in stead of (had care of
the churches of Thracia, etc.) ruled the churches, the Greek is, The words of
Theodoret clipped.
(...), it is translated also (prospexit): so that it appears he fetched it
neither from Theodorete in Greek nor in Latin. And what is this to prove an
Archbishop, that he had care of these churches: there is no minister but ought
to have care over all the churches thorough christendom, and to show that
care for them in comforting or admonishing of them, by writing or by visiting
them, What scrip ture expresses these conditions and cautions*
if the necessity so require, and it is thought good by the churches, and
leave obtained of the place where he is minister, upon some notable and
especial cause, being some man of singular gifts, whose learning and credit
may profit much to the bringing to pass of that thing, for the which he is to
be sent. After this sort. As it ap^ peareth by diverse epistles of his.
S. Cyprian being in Afrike had care over Rome in Europe, and wrote unto the
church there. After this sort also was Ireneus Bishop of Lions sent by the
french Churches, unto the churches in Untrue.
Phrygia, and after this sort have M. Calvin, and M. Bez^ been sent from

Io. Whitgifte.
It shall appear God willing, whether M. Doctors memory or yours be worse: The
falsifying of Theodoret returned upon the Replier.
whether he has an evil conscience in falsifying writers, or you in
slaundering of him: whether he takes his stuff at the second hand, or you
rather, that have borrowed of other me^^ collections, almost whatsoever you
have heaped together in your book. All this I say shall appear, even to try
your corrupt and untrue dealing in this place: and certainly I cannot but
marvel what affection has so gotten the upper hand of you, that it provoke
you to such outrage^us speeches in a matter so manifestly counterfeit. If you
have not seen the Author I will ascribe it to negligent ignorance, but if you
have seen him, I cannot ascribe it to any other thing, than to vnsha^efast
malice. The whole story as it is in Theodoret is this: (...) Theodor. lib. 5.
cap. 28.
(...). John the great having received the stern of the Church, reproved the
injuries of certain boldly, and counsayled the king and the Queen things
c^uenient, and exhorted the Priest^ ^o walk according to the laws appointed.
But such as were not afraid to break them, he suffered not to come to the
table, saying it was not meet that those should enjoy the honor of Priests,
which would not follow the conversation of true Priests. And this care (...)
used not only over that city, but also over whole Thracia, which co^teyneth
six provinces, and over all Asia, which is governed under eleven rulers: and
moreover he governed the Church of Pontus with these laws, in which country
are as many rulers as in Asia. First he says that Chrysostom took the stern^
or government of the Church, then that he did freely reprehend vice. Thirdly,
that he commanded the Priests to live according to the laws. Fourthly, that
he did excommunicate and deprive of their priestly honor such as durst
transgress. Is not this to rule? what Archbishop in England does execute
greater jurisdiction? Then it follows immediately in Theodor. and with this
care he did provide for, or embrace not only his city, but the Churches of
Thracia, etc. Where it is to be noted that Theodorete says with this care etc.
meaning that as he had the government of the Church of Constantinople, and did
there reprehend vice, commanded the Priests to live according to the laws,
excommunicate them that did not, and put them from their office, so did he also
in the Churches of Thracia, Asia, and Pontus. Theodoretes words be (...) etc.
and you have craftily left out (...) that you might the rather cloak
Theodoretes plain meaning. Besides this Theodoret says in plain words,
that he governed the Churches in Pontus with these laws, the Greek word is
(...).

I shall most heartily desire the Reader to consider this dealing of yours:
surely I think few Papists would have dealt in like manner. And if the
words of themselves were not plain (as they be most plain) yet very reason
might have taught you, that this was Theodoretes meaning, for if he should not
have meant some special care of these Churches, wherefore should he rather make
particular me^tio^ of them, tha^ of other Churches? do you not think that wise
me^ can easily epsy your gross shifts?

Cyprians care over Rome, was not like the care that he had over his own
Churches, it could not be said that he embraced Rome with the same care of
government, of reproving, of excommunicating such as durst offend etc. that he
did Carthage, and other places committed unto him, as it is here said of
Chrysostom.

I omit your oversight in saying that Ireneus was sent to the Churches in
Phrygia: for Eusebius lib. 5. cap. 3. and 4. (which places you quote in your
margent to prove it) has no such thing: only he says that Ireneus was sent to
Rome to Eleutherius.

Chap. 3. the. 66. Division.
T. C Page 89. Sect. 1.
Now if you will conclude hereupon that Cyprian ruled the church of Rome, or
Ireneus the Church of Phrigia, or M. Calvin, or M. Beza the churches of
France, or that they were Bishops or Archbishops of those places, you shall
but conclude as you were wont to do: but yet all men understand, that here is
nothing less than an Archbishop, or any such Bishop as we have and use in our
church. And if so be that Chrysostom should be Bishop or Archbishop of al
these churches, which were in all Asia, Pontus, Thracia, as you would give the
reader to understand, you make him Bishop of Or else you are deceived.
more churches than ever the Pope of Rome was, when he was in his greatest
pride, and his empire largest. For there were six presidentships in Thracia,
and in Asia there were an eleven princes, and had several regions or
governments, and in Pontus as many, and if he were Bishop or Archbishop of all
the churches within these dominions, he had need of a long spone to feed with
all. An untruth as will appear.
It is certain therefore that he was Bishop only of the church in
Constantinople, and had an eye and a care to those other churches. And that he
was Bishop of one city or of one church, it may appear by that which I have
before alleged out of the Greek Scholiast upon Titus, who cites there
Chrysostom, where it is said that S. Paul did not mean to make one over the
whole I Will, The words of the Scholiast perverted.
but that every one should have his proper congregation etc. And in another
place he shows the difference between the Emperor and the Bishop, that the
one is over the 3. Hom. Act.
world, and the other, that is the Bishop, is over one city.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your examples prove nothing, neither be they any thing like to this of
Chrysostom, Thracia, etc. annexed to the bishoprike of Constantinople.
for Theodorete does mention these Churches as places annexed to the
Bishopric of Constantinople, and properly apperteyning to the care and charge
of Chrysostom the Bishop of that city. Socrates speaking of a council
assembled at Constantinople, says thus: They do again establish the faith of
the Counsel of Nice: and dividing provinces Socrates, li. 5. cap. 8.
they appoint Patriarchs, there was therefore allotted unto Nectarius, the great
and ample city of Constantinople and Thracia, etc. And this Nectarius was
Patriarch of Constantinople next before Chrysostom, so that it is manifest
that Chrysostom was Patriarch or Archbishop both of Constantinople and also of
Thracia, etc. Sozomenus Sozom. lib. 8. cap. 6.
shows evidently that Chrysostom had jurisdiction over all Asia, and of
other places also, and that he executed jurisdiction there accordingly: For he
deposed to the Chrysostom ^xerciseth Archiepiscopal iuris^ictio^ in Asia.
number of 13. Bishops, some in Lycia, some in Phrygia, some in Asia, because
they sold benefices and bestowed them for favor, and for reward. And if you
were not either very ignorant, or wilfully bent, you might have read in
Ecclesiastical histories, that one Bishop had authority and charge over
diverse Churches, long before Chrysostomes time, the which thing I have also
before proved by diverse examples.

That Chrysostom was Archbishop of all those Churches (although it be
sufficiently proved by the testimony of Theodorete a worthy writer and
notable divine: and by Sozomene also) yet will I add (as a full confutation of
all your phansies in this matter) the judgment of the writers and collectors
of the Centuries, who being many learned, and trauayling especially in such
matters, deserve great credit: In their 5. Centurie. cap. 10. they write thus
of Chrysostom: Non autem tantum istius Ecclesiae Pastorem Cent. 5. cap. 10.
Chrysostom Archbishop of Thracia, Asi^, etc.
egit etc. But he was not only Pastor of this Church (meaning Constantinople)
but was Archbishop also or ouerseer of other Churches in Thracia, which was
divided into six presidentships, in Asia which was ruled of eleven pretors,
and in the region of Pontus, which is likewise divided into eleven
presidentships. If ^o report of any historiographer will please you, what
remedy: though you remain wilful still, yet I trust the tractable Reader may
here find sufficient to satisfy him. For a further proof that the Bishops of
Constantinople were called Archbishops, I could refer you to the general
Council of Calcedon which was Anno. 453. where Flauianus is called Archbishop
Act. 16.
of Constantinople sundry times. Where also it appears that the Archbishop of
Constantinople, had the ordeyning, allowing and disallowing of the Bishops in
Pontus, Asia, and Thracia. You are greatly deceived in saying that if he were
Archbishop of al these Churches, he was Bishop of m^e Churches, than ever the
Pope was in his greatest pride: for even all these Churches, and all other
Churches were made subject to him, when by Phocas he was made the head of the
Church and universal Bishop: and though he had not possession of all, yet did
he claim interest in all, and jurisdiction over all, or at the least over so
many of them as professed Christianity.

You say, it is certain therefore that he was Bishop only of the Church in
Constantinople, and had an eye and care to those other Churches: and against
this your own certayntie without any ground or authority, I have brought in
Theodoret, Sozomene, the Council of Calcedon, and the Centuries: although in
effect you confess as much as I desire: for there is neither Archbishop nor
Bishop in this Church, but he has his peculiar sea and Church, and yet care of
government over other also, even as Chrysostom had.

You have alleged nothing, neither can you, to prove that Chrysostom had not
government over mo Churches than one. The Greek Scholiast (whom I have
answered) has not one word to that purpose: for every several parish has a
Pastor, The Scholiast falsified by T. C. and to what purpose.
notwithstanding the Bishop has the care of government of them, even as Titus
had in Creta. The words of the author be, Sed singulas civitates suum habere
Pastorem, but every city should have her Pastor, And you have translated it,
that every one should have his proper congregation: whereby you mean scant
good faith, but covertly go about to make your reader believe; that the
Scholiast would have no ministers without a proper congregation. But of this
and many other of your like corruptions, I trust the reader is already
sufficiently instructed.

The words of Chrysostom Hom. 3. in Act. be these: N^nne imperium orbis
terraru^ tenet imperator? Hic autem vnius ciuitatis Episcopus est. Does not the
Emperor govern the world? but this man is Bishop of one City. The which
words are spoken of Chrysostom in this sense, that he which is but Bishop of
one City, is as much subject to affections and troubles as the Emperor is,
that governs the whole world. This to be Chrysostomes meaning the words
following do declare: wherefore he does not in that place show any difference
betwixt the Emperor and a Bishop, in the largnes or straightness of their
charges, and places of government (as you say) but in the troubles, in the
opprobries and slanders that they be subject unto, wherewith the Bishop of one
city is more tossed, tha^ the Emperor of the whole world: which Chrysostom
speaks hyperbolycally, for there was not one Emperor over the whole world
at any time, and he himself being Bishop had the care and charge of diverse
Cities, wherefore he must be understood secundum subiectam materiam: as the
matter in hand requires.

Io. Whitgifte.
In the convocation holden in the first year of Queen Marie, the testimony
of Theodorete can have no credit either with the Papists, or with the Replier.
this Theodoret, being alleged against transubstantiation, D. Watson because
he could not answer the authority, denied the Author, accusing him to be a
Nestorian. To whom reply was made, that it was but a lewd refuge, when he
could not answer, to deny the Author. The same may be said to you, dealing
in the self same manner. For this Theodorete as he is a notable
Hystoriographer, and of great credit in the reporting of things done by other,
and before his time, so is there no cause at all why he should be suspected
speaking of him self. And he himself does report of himself in that Epistle
written by him to Leo, that he had not only governed these 800. Churches, but
so governed them by the space of. 26. years, that he sustained no reproach or
blame of the bishops of Antioche: whereof I might also truly gather, that the
Bishop of Antioche was as it were his Archbishop or Metropolitan. This
authority or rather example of Theodorete is so plain, that you are driven to
seek unlawful shifts to deface a worthy writer: but let us see how justly.

You say, that the Bishops of Egypt cried in the Council of Calcedon, that he
was no Bishop, and you note in the margent the. 1. Act. of that Council: and I
say unto you again, that the whole Council in the. 8. Action, cried out and
said, Theodoretus dignus Act. 8. Con. Cal^ed.
est sede Ecclesiae, orthodoxum Ecclesia pastorem recipiat. Theodoret is
worthy the seat of the Church (that is the Bishoprike) let the Church receive
him as a Catholic Pastor.

You add, that Theodosius and Ualentinian, writ unto Dioscorus Bishop of
Alexandria, The corrupt dealing of T. C.
that he had commanded Theodoret Bishop of Cyrus, that he should keep
himself to his own Church only, etc. To this I answer, that you have here
dealt, as commonly you do, that is, very corruptly: for the words that follow
in the same Epistle do evidently declare, that the Emperors meaning was, that
Theodorete should keep himself at home, and not come to the Synod, unless
it should please the whole Synod to accept of him, and to admit him. The which
also appears in another Epistle of the Emperors to Dioscorus in that first
Act of the Council of Calcedon (in the which Epistle the Emperor calls the
Bishop of Jerusalem Archbishop) It appears that Theodorete was first by the
Emperors commandment inhibited from coming to that Synod, which was called
the second Council of Ephesus, and afterward that he was con^mned in the
same Synod in his absence, and not called to answer for himself, as he
declares in his Epistle written to Leo. But he was restored in this general
Council of Calcedon, and that second Council of Ephasus was afterward
condemned: so that all this that you speak to the discredit of Theodorete is
but a frivolous, and yet a corrupt shift.

You do but as you are wont, when you expound that which Theodorete speaks
of his 800. Churches being without tares, of hypocrites and evil men. If you
had read the author your self, I think you would not so grossly have erred:
his words be these. By Gods help I delivered more than a thousand souls from
Martions heresy, Theod. in Epist. ad Leone^.
and I converted many to Christ the Lord from the sect of Arius, and Eunomius,
and vt in octingentis Ecclesijs pastor essem, mibi sortito obtigit: tot enim
paroecias, habet Cyrus: and it was allotted to me to be pastor in 800.
Churches, for Cyrus has so many parishes: in the which How Theodorete le^t no
tares in his 800. churches
through your prayers there did not remain one tare: sed ab omnierrore
haeretico liberatus fuit grex noster, but our flock was delivered from all
heretical error. Theodorete therefore means heresy, he means not
hypocrisy, there was not one heretic in all his Bishoprike, he does not say
one hypocrite or evil man: so that you are far wide and do Theodorete double
injury, for you do both slander him, and misconstrue him.

Now, that it may appear what great likelihoode there is between this
Theodoret, and our Lord Bishops and Archbishops, it is to be considered which
he writes of himself in the Epistle unto Leo, that is, that he having been.
26. years Bishop, was known of all those that dwelt in those parts, that he
had never house of his own, nor field, nor halfepenn^e, not so much as a
place to be buried in, but had willingly contented himself with a poor
estate, be^yke he had a very leene Archbishoprike, and if the fat morsels of
our Bishoprikes, and Archbishoprikes were taken and employed to their uses of
maintenance of the poor, and of the Ministers, and of the Uniuersities, which
are the seed of the ministry, I think the heat of the disputation, and
contention for Archbishops and Bishops would be well cooled.

Io. Whitgifte.
We speak^ of the office and authority, not of the living, to the spoil of
the which, Comparison made in office, not in riches.
you and most of your fautors have more respect, than you have to the office,
though you pretend the contrary: and yet it follows not, but that
Theodorete had living sufficient, and might have been more welthie, but as it
seems he professed voluntary poverty of purpose, for he gave away that also
which was left unto him of his parents, as he in that Epistle testifyeth
saying, Sed sponte electam amplexus sum paupertatem: but I embraced poverty
which I chose willingly. His Bishoprike might be of large revenues, and yet he
poor, seeing that he had chosen, and professed poverty. But if Bishops be
better now provided for, than they were then, it is their parts to be
thankful unto God and the Prince for it, and to use it well. It is not your
duty to envy their prosperity, because you are not in case your self.

But what shall I need to use such proofs in a matter so plain, and evident
to all such as have read any thing of antiquity? The best learned men of our
days, and diligentest preferrers of the Gospel of Christ do with one consent

distinction of degrees, and superiority in the government of the Church; is a
thing most convenient and necessary.

had among their Bishops an Archbishop, and that the Council of Nice did
appoint Patriarchs which should be in order and dignity above Archbishops,
it was for the preservation of discipline: Therefore for this cause especially
were those degrees appointed, that if any thing should happen in any
particular Church which could not there be decided, it might be removed to a
provincial Synod: If the greatness or difficulty of the cause required
greater consultation, then was there added Patriarchs together with the
Synodes, from whom there was no appeal but unto a general Counsel* This kind
of government some called Hierarchiam, an improper name and not used in the
scriptures: for the spirit of God vvil not have us to dream of dominion and
rule in the government of the Church: But if (omitting the name) we shall
consider the thing it self, we shall find that these old Bishops did not
frame any other kind of government in the Church, from that which the Lord
has prescribed in his word. Calvin here mislyketh this name Hierarchia, but
he allows the names and authority of Patriarchs and Archbishops, and
thinks the government of the Church then used, not to differ from that which
God in his word prescribes.

T. C. Page 89. Sect. vlt. and Page 90. Sect. 1. 2.
M. Calvin first is cyted to prove those offices of Archbishop, Primate,
Patriarch: The names whereof he cannot abide, and as for him he approves
only, that there should be some, which when difficult causes arise, which
cannot be ended in the particular Churches might refer the matters to Synodes
and provincial Councelles, and which might do the offices which I have spoken
of before of gathering voices. etc.

But that he likes not of those dominations and large jurisdictions, or at all
of the Bishops or Archbishops, which we have now, it may appear plainly
enough both in that place, when as he will have his words drawn to no other
than the old Bishops, shutting out thereby the Bishops that now are, as also
in other places, and namely upon the Philippians, where reasoning against Phil.
1.
this distinction between Pastor and Bishop, and showing that giving the name
of Bishop, to one man only in a church, was the occasion why he afterward
usurped do^ination over the rest, he says after this sort: In deed I grant
(says he) as the dispositions and manners of men are, order cannot stand
amongst the ministers of the word, unless one be over the rest, I mean
(says he) of every several and singular body, not of a whole province, much
less of the whole world.

Now if you will needs have M. Caluins Archbishop, you must not have him
neither over a Province nor Diocese, but only over one singular and
particular congregation: how much better therefore were it for you to seek
some other shelter against the storm than M. Caluins, which will not suffer
you by any means to cover your self under his wings, but thrusts you out
always as soon as you enter upon him forceably.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin affirms directly, that every province among their Bishops had

an Archbishop, and that the Council of Nice did a ppoynt Patriarchs: he
says that these degrees were appointed for the preservation of discipline,
and by calling of Synodes to end controversies that arise in particular
Churches he well lyketh this kind of government: only he mislyketh the name
(Hierarchia) what can be plainlyer spoken both of the name and office of the
Archbishop? As for your fond devise that it should be his office only to
gather voices, etc. it is singular to your self, you have not one learned
writer (that I can read) with you.

The Bishops that now are in this Church, neither have, nor challenge to have
more jurisdiction than the old Bishops had, nay they have not so much, as it
is evidently to be seen in the old Canons: and therefore M. Calvin allowing
of them, does allow of ours also.

His place to the Philippians makes against you, for he allows one to be
superior amongst the ministers, and to rule the rest, and says. that as the
nature and disposition of men now is, there could be no order except it were
so: which does utterly overthrow the equality that you and the Admonition
dream of. He says that he speaks de singulis corporibus. which he cannot
understand of particular parishes, for every particular parish has not many
ministers: so that of necessity he must have many senerall Churches to make
the body he speaks of: and therefore a Diocese or a province. I think M.
Calvin did think Geneua, and the towns thereunto adjoining and belonging to
be but one body: so do I think London and the Diocese thereunto perteyning
to be but one particular body. And likewise the Province of Canterbury,
distinguished into diverse parts and members, to be but one body in like
manner. Neither do I think that master Calvin ever showed his mislyking of
these degrees in this Church as they be now used: for (as I said before) the
great abuse of them under the Pope, made him more to mislyke of them, than he
would have done, but in these words that I have repeated of his, he
testifyeth as T. C. lets that slip, that makes against him.
much as I desire, that is the antiquity and the cause, and use of those
offices, and (that which you omit and skip over) that herein the old Bishops
did frame no kind of government in the Church, diverse from that which the
Lord has prescribed in his word: which neither you nor your adherents can
abide to hear of.

But here I cannot let pass M. Doctors ill dealing, which recyting so much

cutteth him off in the waste, and leaves quite out that which made against
him, that is which M. Calvin says in these words: Although (says he)
in this disputation, it may not be passed over that this office of Archbishop
or Patriarch, was most rarely and seldom used, which dealing seems to
proceed of a very evil conscience.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know not what perfection is in your book, more than in mine, but I am sure
that I have followed mine own book faithfully and truly, neither have I
omitted one word that makes either with me or against me: and therefore you
have unjustly charged me. The book that I follow was printed Anno. 1553.
wherein there are no such words, that this office (...) Archbishop or
Patriarch was most rarely and seldom used. Neither is there cause why. M.
Calvin should so say, for he could not but know that these offices have had
continuance in the Church, at the least, since before the Council of Nice,
for there are these words, mos antiquus perduret, etc. and that they were
continually affixed to the Bishoprikes of certain Cities, as Rome, Antioch.
etc.

In deed in the last edition of his institutions, he has these words,
quanquam in hac disputatione praeteriri non potest, quod rarissimi erat vsus,
which words he refers to The use of the Patriarch rare, in what sense*
the office of a Patriarch, whom he says the Nicene Council did place in
dignity and order above Archbishops, for the preservation of discipline,
neither does he say that the office of a Patriarch was moveable, or chosen at
every action, (for then should he affirm that which is repugnant to all
Hystoryes, Councelles* and ancient writers that speak of Patriarchs) but his
meaning is, that there was but seldom times occasion offered for Patriarchs,
to exercise the authority they had over Archbishoppes, which is the occasion
that the most authors do confound them, and think them to be all one: other
meaning than this, his words neither can nor do admit.

Hemingius in his Enchirid. shows, that these degrees in the Hemingi^*
Church be necessary, and that discipline cannot be kept without them. And he
adds that their Church keeps this form, Necmouetur (says he)
Anabaptistarum ac Libertinoru^ effreni libidine, qui ecclesiam Christi
barbaricum quendam bominu^ caetum, sine ordine fingunt, cu^ habeat nostra
ecclesia non solu^ exemplu^ Apostolicae and purioris ecclesiae, verum etiam
mandatum spiritus sancti omnia ordinate and decenter ad aedificationem
faciendi. Neither is our Church moved with the licencious liberty of
Anabaptists and Libertines, which feine the Church of Christ to be a barbarous
confused society without order, seeing that our Church has not only the
example of the Apostolical and most pure Church, but also the commandment of
the spirit of God, to do all things orderly and decently to edify.

T. C. Page 90. Sect. 4.
Then follows Hemingius, who you say approves these degrees of Archbishop,
Metropolitan, Bishop, Archdeacon, for so you must needs mean, when you say
he approves these Cap. 10. 3. class. lib. Enchirid. where also among the
popish orders he reckeneth the (...).
degrees, or else you say nothing, for thereupon is the question. Now how
untruly you speak, let it be judged by that which follows. First he says
that our Savior Christ in S. Luke distinguishes, and puts a difference
between the office of a Prince, and the office of the Minister of the Church,
leaving dominion to the Princes, and taking it altogether from the Ministers*
here you see, not only how he is against you, in your exposition in the place
of S. Luke, which would have it nothing else but a prohibition of ambition,
but also how at a word, he cutteth the throat of your Archbishop, and
Bishop as it is now used. And afterward speaking of the Churches of
Denmark, he says they have Christ for their head, and for the outward
discipline, they have Magistrates to punish with the sword, and for to
exercise the ecclesiastical discipline, they have Bishops, Pastors,
Doctors, which may keep men under with the word, without using any corporal
punishment. Here is no mention of Archbyshoppes, Primates, Metropolitanes. And
although he shows that they keep the distinction between Bishops and
Ministers, against which there has been before spoken, yet he says that the
authority which they have, is as the authority of a father, not as the power
of a master, which is far otherwise here. So is the condition of a good
servant under a good master, much better than the condition of an unruly son
under a wise father.
For the condition of many servant under their masters, is much more free
than the condition of a Minister under his Bishop. And afterward he shows
wherein that authority or dignity of the Bishop over the Minister lies, that
is in exhorting of him, in chyding of him* as he does the lay people, and yet
he will have also the Minister, although not with such authority, after a
modest sort to do the same unto the Bishop. And so he concludes, that they
reteyne these orders, notwithstanding the Anabaptists. Now let the reader
judge whether Hemingius be truly or faithfully alleged or no, or whether
Hemingius do say that they have in their Church Archbishoppes, Primates;
Metropolitanes, Archdeacons, or whether the Bishops in the Churches of
Denmark are any thing like ours. For I (...) omit that he speaks there

Io. Whitgifte.
Hemin. in that very place quoted in your marge^t has first these words:
Praeterea cu^ hic c^tus, etc. Furthermore seeing this society is ruled by the
word of god, there are in it two sorts of men, that is to say the preachers of
the word, and their hearers, which do reverence and Hemingius allows

love one another as fathers and children. But in the Ministers there is great
diversity: for although the authority of all Ministers in respect of
spiritual regiment is all one (for of external discipline shall be spoken in
the proper place) yet there are diverse orders and degrees of honor and
dignity: and that partly by the word of God, partly by the approbation and
allowance of the Church. Where first he allows this distinction which you so
greatly mislyke that all Ministers be equal touching spiritual jurisdiction,
that is their ministry, but not concerning external discipline: then does he
allow degrees of dignity and superiority among the Clergy: the which after
that he has proved by the Scripture, as namely the. 4. to the Ephesians, and
by the examples of Paul, Hemingius acknowledges Patriarchs in the primitive
Church. The office of Patriaches in the primative Church.
Timothy, and Titus, he proceeds and goes on forward: and says, Ecclesia.
etc. The Church, to whom the Lord has given power unto edification, has
ordained an order of ministeries for her profit, that all things might be
rightly ordained for the reedifying of the body of Christ. Hereof the
Primitive Church following the times of the Apostles, did appoint some
Patriarchs, whose office it was to provide that the Bishops of every (...)
should be rightly ordained and elected: that the Bishops should do their
duty truly: and that the Clergy and people should obey them in those
things that perteyned to the Lord: it appointed also Chorepiscopos, (that is
coadiutors of Bishops whom we now call Prouostes) some Pastors, and
Catechistes. This was the ordination of the Primitive Church. Wherein he
plainly declares these degrees that I speak of (for under the name of
Patriarchs, it is evident that he comprehends Archbyshops or Metropolitanes)
to have been in the Primitive Church, immediately after the Apostles time, and
in the purest time of the Church: than the which what can be spoken more
directly for my purpose, whose chief intent is, to prove the antiquity of
these names and offices?

After this he shows the abuses of these offices in the corruption of
doctrine under the Pope, and he does not only name Archbishops, but Bishops
also, Curates, and other, and therefore the note in your margent, is but a note
of a special spyte against the Archbishops. In the end speaking of Bishops,
Pastors, and Doctors, he says thus. Inter hos ministros, etc. Amongst these
ministers also our Church acknowledges degrees To take away degrees is

and orders of dignity, for the diversity of gifts, the greatness of
labor, and the worthiness of their calling: and judges it to be barbarous,
to will to take this order out of the Church: It judges that other Ministers
ought to obey their Bishops in all things that tend Ministers subject to
Bishops.
to the edification of the Church, according to the word of God, and the
profitable order of the Church: It judges that the Bishops have authority
over the other ministers of the Church, not such as is of masters, but of
fathers. Whereby he acknowledges distinction of degrees and superiority among
Ministers, and the jurisdiction of Bishops over other Ministers: After all this
he concludes with these words contained in mine answer: Now let the reader
judge whether I have otherwise reported of Himingius than he himself in that
Chapter affirms: and whether he consent unto me that would have distinction
of degrees among the Ministers, or to you that would have an equality which he
calls an Anabaptisticall and barbarous confusion.

Touching your notes gathered out of him, I will briefly answer: first, in the
exposition of the. 22. of Luke, he is not against me, for I would not have
Archbishops or Bishops. etc. to take from Kings their rule and dominion as does
the Pope: neither would I have them to reign over the people as Kings and
Princes do. And I do not think but that the authority and superiority that
they have, is a ministry for the quietness of the Church, and the commodity
of other, and yet a government to: for the Apostle says, ad Hebr. 13. Obedite
his qui praesunt vobis, Obey them that Heb. 13.
bear rule over you etc. Hemingius in that place especially deals against
the two swords of the Bishop of Rome, and his excessive pomp.

For the kind of authority that the Bishop has over the Ministers, that it
should What kind of authority the Bishos exercise.
be of a father, and not of a master, I agree with him, and I know that all
you speak to the contrary in the government of this Church, is most untrue:
For undoubtedly if they have offended in any thing, it is in to much lenity,
which is a fault even in a father. The authority that Hemingius gives to the
civil Magistrate, we acknowledge with him to be most due, and I would to God
you also did in heart and mouth confess the same. Thus you see that Hemingius
and we agree, and that there is nothing ascribed unto him, which is not
plainly to be found in him.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 75. Lin. 11. and Sect. 1.
Wherefore thus I conclude with the very words of that worthy M. Fox*
man, (who has so well deserved of this Church of England) Master Fox: In
the ecclesiastical estate we take not away the distinction of ordinary
degrees, such as by the Scripture be appointed, or by the Primitive Church
allowed, as Patriarchs or Archebishops, Bishops, ministers, and deacons, for
of these four we especially read as chief: in which four degrees as
vvegraunt diversity of office, so we admit in the same also diversity of
dignity: neither denying that which is due to each degree, neither yet
maynteyning the ambition of any singular person. For as we give to the
minister place above the Deacon, to the Bishop above the minister, to the
Archbishop above the Bishop, so we see no cause of inequality, why one
minister should be above another minister, one Bishop in his degree above
another Bishop to deal in his dioces: or an Archbishop above an other
Archbishop: and this is to keep an order duly and truly in the Church,
according to the true nature and definition of order by the authority of
Augustine, lib. de Ciui. Ordo est parium dispariumque rerum sua cuique loca
tribuens dispositio. Hitherto M. Fox.

Now let the indifferent Reader judge whether these offices be strange and
unheard of in the Church of Christ, or no.

T. C. Page 90. Sect. vlt.
M. Doctor closes up this matter with M. Fox, but either for fear that the
place should be found, that there might be answer, or for fear that M. Fox
should give me the solution which has given you the obiecion, he would
neither quote the place of the book, nor the book it self, he having written
diverse. You can not speak so much good of M. Fox, which I will not
wyllingly subscribe unto: and if it be any declaration of good will, and of
honor, that one bears to another, to read that which he writes, I think I

I have read more of him, than you. For I have read over his book of Martyrs,

you the forgery of these Epistles, whereout you fetch your authorities, and
would have showed you that the distinguishing of the orders of Metropolitanes,
Bishops, and other degrees, which you say sometimes had their beginnings in
the Apostles times, sometimes you can not tell when, were not in Higinus time,
which was. 180. years after Christ. I A suspicious head.
perceive you fear M. Fox is an enemy unto your Archbishop and primate, and
therefore it seems you went about to corrupt him with his praise, and to
seek to draw him, if it were possible, vnt^ the Archbishop, and if not, yet
at the least that he would be no enemy, if he would not, nor could not be
his friend. You make me suspect that your praise is not hearty, but pretended,
because you do so often and so bitterly speak against all those that will not
receive the cappe, and surplesse, and other ceremonies, whereof M. Fox
declares his great misliking. For answer unto the place, because I remember
it not, nor mean not to read over the whole book to seek it, I say first as
I said before, that there may be somethyng before or after, which may give the
solution to this plac^, especially seeing M. Fox in another place page. 96.
proving the Epistles of Stephanus to be counterfeyt, he uses this reason,
because the fyft canon of the said Epistles, solemnly entreats of the
difference between, Primates, Metropolitanes, and Archbishops, which
distinction (says he) of titles and degrees, savor more of ambition than
persecution. Moreover I say, that M. Fox writing a story, does take greater
pain, and looks more diligently to declare what is done, and in what time,
and by whom, than how justly or bniustly, how conveniently or inconueniently
it is done. Last of all, if any thing be spoken there to the hinderance of the
sincerity of the Gospel, I am well assured that M. Fox, which has
traueled so much and so profitably to that end, will not have his authority
or name therein to bring any prejudice. Now will I also join with you, and
leave it to the judgment of the indifferent Reader, how well out of the
Scriptures, Councels, writers old and new, you have proved either the
lawfulness at all of the names of Archbishops, Patriarchs, Archdeacons,
Primates, or of the lawfulness of the office of them, and of Bishops which be
in our times.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you had so diligently read M. Fox his book of Martyrs, as you boast and
brag that you have done, then could not this place have been so strange unto
you, for it is in the, 20. page of his first tome, where he has an whole
treatise touching the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, and speaks of this
matter at large. The words be his own, and express his own judgment of these
degrees and offices in this Church of England. It had been some token of
modesty, so to have commended your self, and your own reading, that you had
not depraved any other man's: But to commend your self, and to detract from an
other, is either arrogant foolishness, or foolishs arrogancy. I can bring
forth good testimonies of my reading of these books, though I make no vragge
thereof, or vain comparisons.

I have alleged none of these Epistles other wise than M. Fox him self has
alleged them.

M. Fox has showed him self (in the place by me cited out of his book) to
be no (...) either to Archbishop, Private, or Bishop, for I am sure he speaks
as he thinks. He is not a man like to be corrupted with praise, and therefore
in so saying, you do us both great injury.

You may not judge my heart: I think of M. Fox as of one that I love and
reverence, I will not utter all that I could, least I should seem to flatter.

There is nothing that goes either before that place, or follows after it,
that can procure any other sense to his words, than that in the which I have
set them down. I do not allege M. Fox for the original of these names and
offices, but for the allowance of them. These words that I have recited are not
spoken in the way of any history, but of the order of government of this
Church, which he allows, and I dare say for him, that he has heereinspoken
nothing, which he thinks may hurt the (...) of the Gospel. And I am right
well content to let the godly Reader judge of both our proofs.

Reader why T. C. takes these words so grievously: even because they touch
him self. For the man is of that humility and patience, that if there be
never so little signification given of any unskillfulness or lack of learning
in him self, he roareth like a lion, and swells like the sea: for none of
that faction can in any case abide to have their learning touched: The

and they will not stick in commending them selves, to deface all other, yea
even that notable Iuell, whose both labor and learning they do envy, and
among them selves deprave, as I have heard with mine own ears, and a number
more besides. For further proof whereof I do but refer you to the report,
that by this faction was spread of him after his last Sermon at Paul's cross,
because he did confirm the doctrine before preached by a famous and learned
man, touching obedience to the Prince and laws. It was then strange to me to
hear so notable a Bishop, so learned a man; so stout a champion of true
religion, so paynefull a Prelate, so ungratefully, and spitefully used, by a
sort of wavering, wicked, and wretched tongues. But it is their manner; except
you please their humor in all things, be you never so well learned, never so
paynfull, so zealous, so vertuons, all is nothing with them, but they will
deprave you, rail on you, backbite you, inuentlyes of you, and spread false
rumors, as though you were the vilest persons in the whole earth.

And consider whether T. C. be not even now in that vain: for how
maliciously The Bishop maliciously staundered by T. C.
does he slander that so Reverend Bishop, saying, that he calls ye doctrine
of the Gospel wantonness, when he speaks of their childishe and
fantastical devises, except all were Gospel that they speak, or that
comes from them. Pardon me, though I speak something earnestly: it is in
the behalf of a Iuell, that is contemned and defaced by contentious and
ungrateful persons. If it had pleased God to have suffered him to live unto
this day, in answering this Reply, he should no doubt have proved his biting
and sharp words, (as they be called) to be most true. But seeing that he is
at rest, and not here to answer for him self, though in respect of him I am
far unmeet to intermedle in his doings, yet in respect of the cause and
adversary, I will be bold to justify his answers.

The answer of the Bishop of Sarisburie.
How know you that the fourth chapter ad Ephe. is a perfect pattern Eius

of all ecclesiastical government? we have now neither Apostles, nor The.
4. Ephesians* no perfect plat form of all ecclesiastical government.
Evangelists, nor Prophets, and yet are they the chief in that pattern,
neither have we there either Bishop, or Presbyter, or Diaconus or Catechista,
or Lector, and yet are these necessary parts in ecclesiastical government:
Therefore that pattern is not perfect to hold for ever, neither were there
then any public Churches or Pulpits, or Schools, or Universities, etc. S.
Paul names neither Pope nor Archbishop I grant, and the Church is not
governed by names, but by offices. Every Bishop then was called Papa: and
Anacletus, that was next after Peter, (if there be any weight in his words)
names Archbishops.

T. C. Page 91. Sect. 1.
Unto the place of the. 4. of the Ephesians before alleged he answers clean
contrary to that which M. Doctor says, that we have now neither Apostles, nor
Evangelists, nor prophets, whereupon he would conclude that that place is no
perfect pattern of the ministry in the Church. In deed it is true, we have
not, neither is it needful that we should. It was therefore sufficient that
there were once, and for a time, so that the want of those now, is no cause
why the ministeryes there recyted be not sufficient, for the accomplishment and
full finishing of the church, nor cause why any other ministeries should be
added, besides those which are there recyted.

Io. Whitgifte.
Not one word contrary to any thing that I have spoken, for I told you
before Tract. 4. cap. ^ diuis. 1.
in what respect it may be said these offices to remain, and in what respect
they be ceased: there is now no planting of Churches, nor going through the

world, there is no writing of new Gospels, no prophesying of things to
come, but there is governing of Churches, visiting of them, reforming of
Pastors, and dyrecting of them, which is a portion of the Apostolical
function: there is preaching of the Gospel, expounding and interpreting the
Scriptures, which be incident to the Evangelist and Prophet. Against this no
learned man (as I think) speaks.

But now to my Lord of Sarisburie his argument, which is this: that, from
The Bishops argument.
the which somewhat must be taken, and unto the which somewhat must be
added, is no perfect pattern, but Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, are taken
away from the fourth to the Ephesians, and Deacons and Elders as you your self
say must be added, Ergo, it is no perfect pattern: neither do you, neither can
you answer this argument. But I will come to your accustomed shifts.

Chap. 4. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 91. Sect. 2.
Afterward he says, that neither Bishop nor Elder are reckoned in that place.
The pastor is there reckoned up, and I have showed, that the pastor and Bishop
are all one, and are but diverse names to signify one thing. And as for those
Elders which do only govern, they are made mention of in other places, and
therefore the Bishop and Elder are there contained, which thing also M. Doctor
grants.

Io. Whitgifte.
If the Bishop be contained under the Pastor, why may not the Archbishop be so
likewise: but if the Elders (which you say do only govern) be not there
contained, and yet a necessary function in the Church (as you think) how can
it then be a perfect platform? or why may not Archbishops and Archdeacons be
also necessary, though they be not in that place named: but you say that
those Elders be in other places mentioned. That is no answer to this place,
but a reason rather to prove it no perfect pattern.

M. Doctor grants a Bishop to be contained under the name of a pastor. But
he does not grant that your Elder is so, or every Presbyter (to whom the
ministry of the word of God and sacraments is committed) to be a Pastor.

Chap. 4. the. 4. Division.

does it perteyne to any other in the church, and publicly to teach the
youth in the rudiments of religion, than unto the pastor, howsoever in some
times and places they have made a several office of it.

Io. Whitgifte.
If a pastor and a Catechiste may be in one, why may not a Bishop and a
governor Catechist and pastor distinguished.
also be one, and so your Elders shut out of the doors? But you may learn in
ancient writers, that the office of a Catechiste was necessary in the
Church, and distinct from the Pastor. Origene was a Catechist in the Church
of Alexandria, as Eusebius in his sixte book does in sundry places declare,
and yet he was not then a Pastor.

Chap. 4. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 92. Sect. 1.
And where he says that there is neither Deacon nor Reader mentioned: for the
Deacon I have answered, that S. Paul speaks there only of those functions
which are occupied both in teaching and governing the Churches, and therefore
there was no place there to speak of a Deacon: and as for the Reader it is no
such office in the Church which the minister may not do. Where have you
scri^ture for this gear.
And if either he have not leisure, or his strength and voice will not serve
him first to read some long time, and afterward to preach, it is an easy
matter to appoint some of the Elders, or Deacons, or some other grave man in
the Church to that purpose, as it has been practiced in the Churches in times
past, and is in the Churches reformed in our days, without making any new
order or office of the ministry.

Io. Whitgifte.
This distinction helps not here: for if you say the offices or names of
Deacons be left out in this place because Saint Paul speaks not of such
offices, as be occupied only in government: first I answer, that the same
may be said of Archebisho^s and Archedeacons, who have those names, only in
the respect of government. Secondly, I tell you that the office of a Deacon is
also to preach, as is Tract. 14.
hereafter proved. And last of all, that the office of a Deacon (especially as
you restrain it) is neither office nor name of government, but of simple and
absolute ministry and service.

Your starting holes will not hyde you: and this argument of the Bishop will
not he answered. You have said nothing to prove this place to be a perfect
pattern of all ecclesiastical functions: neither do you say any thing for
omitting the names of Bishop, Deacon, Presbyter. etc. but we may say the same
for the names of Archbishop, Archedeacon. etc.

The Reader has been counted a necessary office in the Church, and is of
great antiquity, and I know that the Deacon, or any other grave person upon
occasion may be admitted to read. But I pray you, where do you find any such
thing in the scripture, T. C. takes greater liberty to himself than he will
allow to whole churches.
especially of those which you call Elders, which be in no degree of the
ministry? for it is great presumption for you to appoint any such office in
the Church, not having your warrant in Gods word, seeing you find such
fault with whole Churches for allowing offices used in the best time of the
Church, confirmed by the best Councels, and approved by all ancient writers,
because their names be not expressed in the scripture: and seeing also that you
your self a little before said, that only the pastor ought publicly in the
Church to teach the youth, and not a Catechist, and I take publyke reading in
the Church to be as solemn a matter as Catechizing the youth. But you have
liberty to coin what order you list, without either Scripture, or any other
approved writer: we must make you another Pythagoras.

In times past it was a peculiar office, and he that had it was called Lector,
and therefore you can not say (as it has been practiced in times past)
except you will confess that name and office of Lector, and so also grant
some name and office profitable for the Church, to be omitted in the fourth
Chapter to the Ephesians.

Chap. 4. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page. 92. Sect. 1. 2.
Where he says that by this reason we should have no Churches, pulpits,
schools, nor universities: it is first easily answered that S. Paul speaks
not in the. 4. to the Ephesians of all things necessary for the Church, but
only of all necessary ecclesiastical functions, which do both teach and
govern in the Church, and then I have already showed that there were both
Churches and pulpits.

As for schools and Uniuersities, it is sufficient I grant, but not out of

commandment of them, in that it is commanded that both the Magistrates and
pastors should be learned, for he that commands that they should be
learned, commands those things and those means, whereby they may most
conveniently come to that learning. And we have also examples of them commended
unto us in the old Iud. 51.
Testament. As in the book of the Judges when Debora commends the
University men, and those which handled the pen of the writer, that they
came out to help in the battle against the enemies of God. And in the first
book of Samuel: and in the second book of the Kings: 1. Sam. 19.
when Naioth and Bethel, Jericho, and a place beyond Jordan are specified
places which were 2. Rg. 2.
schools or Uniuersities, where the scholars of the Prophets were brought up in
the fear of God, and good learning: the continuance of which schools and
universities amongst the people of God, Act. 6.
may be easily gathered of that which S. Luke writes in the Acts, where it
may appear, that in Jerusalem there were certain Colleges appointed for
several country men, so that there was one College to receive the Jews and
Proselites, which came out of Cilicia, another for those that came out of
Alexandria. etc. to study at Jerusalem. And if any man be able to show such
evidence for Archbishops and Archedeacons, as these are for universities and
schools, I will not deny but it is as lawful to have them as these.

Io. Whitgifte.
Yet says he truly, for in those times in Christian congregations there were
neither public Churches, or Pulpits, or schools, or Universities, etc. and yet
these do apperteyne to the gouernmente of the Church. In deed S. Paul
speaks only there of such ecclesiastical functions as do teach and
preach the word, and not of such as do only govern, and therefore it can
not be a perfect platfourme for ever, as I have before declared: and yet
diverse of these things mentioned by the Bishop of Sarisburie, perteyne both
to the office of teaching and governing.

That which you say of Schools, and Uniuersities, I mind not to examine,
because I know they be necessary for the Church, how aptely soever you prove
them. But this is the matter: they be necessary in the Church both for the

of governing and teaching, and yet they be not expressed in the fourth to the
Ephesians, therefore in that fourth to the Ephesians there is no perfect
pattern of all ecclesiastical government: for that is the thing that the
Bishop of Sarisburie affirms, and thereunto you answer not one word.

Not one of these places that you allege, proves that in this text to the
Ephesians, either Schools or Universities be mentioned: though it be certain,
that they perteyne both to teaching and governing, and therefore all this
speech of yours is Ignorantia Elenchi.

Furthermore he says, that the Church is not governed by names, but by
offices, so is it in deed. And if the office of an Archbishop or Archdeacon
can be showed, we will not strive for the name, but for so much as all the
needful offices of the Church together with their names are mentioned in the
the Scripture, it is truly said that both the offices and names of
Archbishop and Archedeacons, being not only not contained in them (but also
condemned) ought to be banished out of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have before showed, that the office of visiting Churches, of ouerseeing many
Pastors The office of archbyshops and archde^cons contemed in scripture.
and Bishops, of suppressing schisms. etc. was in the Apostles, and is in the
scriptures: But in these things does the office of an Archbishop consist, and
in part of them the office of an Archdeacon, therefore the offices of
Archbyshops and Archdeacons be contained in the scriptures, and were in the
Apostles time. For although (as I then said) that this part of the
Apostolical office, which did consist in planting and founding Churches
through the whole world, is ceased: yet the manner of government by placing
Bishops in every City, by moderating and governing them, by visiting the
Churches, by cutting of schisms and contentions, by ordering Ministers,
remains still, and shall continue, and is in this Church in the Archbyshops
and Bishops as most meet men to execute the same. Wherefore seeing the offices
be in the scriptures, there is no cause why the names should be mislyked, much
less banished and cast out of the church.

Last of all he says that Anacletus (if there be any wayght in his words)
names an Archbishop. I have before showed what weight there is in his words,

gives us in the handling of the article of the supremacy, and in the. 223.

The second Reason. Secunda ratio*

The Synagogue of the Jews was a figure of the Church of Christ. And God to
the perfection of that Church omitted nothing.

The Answer of the Bishop.
I see not what you vvoulde conclude: perhaps you will say they had Eius
solutio.
not the names of Pope or Archbishop. So had they not this name Episcopus in
all Moses law, yet were not all Priests of like aunciencie in government.
They had other names that were equivalent with Archbyshops: as Principes
Synagogae: Principes sanctuarij: Principes familiarum Leuiticarum: Principes
familiarum sacerdotalium: Principes Sacerdotum: Principes domus Dei: Pontifex:
Summus Pontifex: Summus sacerdos. etc. Therefore this negative reason is but
vveake. Again whereas it is said that to the perfection of the Synagogue
there vvanted nothing, it may be ansvvered, that to the perfection thereof
there vvanted many things, as it is known and confessed. And as the Synagogue
had not the names of Pope and Archbishop, so had it not the name of Apostle, o^
Evangelist. etc.

T. C. Page 92. Sect. 5.
The second reason which says that the church of God under the law, had all
all things needefu^* appointed by ye commandment of God, the Bishop says he
knows not what could be concluded of it: I have showed before that there is
nothing less meant, than that the Church under the Gospel should have al those
things that ye Church had, or should have nothing which that had not. But this
there upon is concluded, that the Lord which was so careful for that, as not to
omit the least, would not be so careless for this Church under the Gospel,
as to omit the greatest.

Io. Whitgifte. Tract. 2. cap. 6 diuis. 3.

I told you before, that this which you call the perfection of the Synagogue,
was rather a burden than a perfection: for God therefore prescribed unto them a
prescript form of external things, that it might be a means to keep them
from further inconvenience, but to us in such things he has left a greater
liberty: and the perfection of the Church does not consist in outward
appearance, but in spiritual gifts, and therein has the Lord much more
plentifully and gratiou^ly showed his care for the Church under the Gospel,
than he did for it under the law.

Touching external orders both of ceremonies and government he has left the
disposition thereof to his Church in many things, as I have proved in the
beginning of Tract. 2.
this book.

And where he says that there was then which was called high priest, and was
over all the rest, he did well know that ye cause thereof was This was one
cause, but not the only cause.
because he was a figure of Christ, and did represent unto the people, the
chieftie and superiority of our Savior Christ, which was to come: and that
our ^amour Christ, being come, there is now no cause why there should be any
such pre-eminence given unto one, and further that it is unlawful that there
should be any such, A Popish non sequitur.
unless it be lawful to have one head Bishop over all the Church, for it is
known, that that priest was the head priest over all the whole Church, which
was during his time, unto our Savior Christ.

Io. Whitgifte.
The high priest was a figure of Christ, so was David and Solomon: but yet was
the high priest also appointed to govern other for order and policy, and so
was David and Solomon. The figure is taken a way and the kind of Sacrifice:
but the office of governing remains still, and is to be observed as the state
of the Church requires. Christ being come, the office of sacrificing cease
but not the office of governing: for Christ by his coming did not take away
government, and policy, no notfrom the (...) state.

This reason of yours, that that priest was the head priest over all the
Church, therefore if by A popish reason used by the Replyer.
his example we will have an Archbishop he must be such a one as shall govern
the whole church, is in deed a plain confirmation of the Papists reason for
ye supremacy, who think that they may reason in lik^ manner. But I answer you
as M. Calvin answers the^ Lib. inst. cap. 8. Sect. 87. There is no reason
that compels to extend that unto the whole Calvin.
world, which was profitable in one nation: nay rather there is a great
diversity betwixt one nation and the whole world. Because the Jews were
compassed in on every side with Idolaters, least they should be withdrawn
through the variety of Religion, God did place the seat of his worship in the
midst of the earth: there he appointed over them one prelate, whom all should
look upon, that they might the better be contained in unity. Now when as true
Religion is dispersed through out the whole world, who does not see it to be
absurd, that the government of both the East and West, should be given to
one? it is like as if one would say, because one precinct of ground has not
many governors, therefore the whole world ought to be ruled of one president
or governor.

I know that he makes another answer likewise: even the same that you have
borrowed of him, touching the figure, but his first answer is more direct in
my opinion. And M. Nowell, against Dorman reasoning as you do, gives him this
answer, Nowell.
It agrees very well with the estate of the Jews, that as they being one
nation had one chief Lib. 1. 63.
Priest, so is it good likewise that every Christian nation have their chief
Priest or Bishop. It agrees not that because the Jews, one nation, had one
high Priest to govern them in doubts, therefore all nations through the world
should have one high priest over al other: for not only the vnlikelyhood
between these two, but the impossibili^ie of the latter is most evident. Other
learned men also there be, as Hyp^rius Lib. 3 Method Theolog and d^uers others,
who answering this same argument of the Papists, say, that by it we may well
prove that one Archbishop or Metropolitan may govern one Province, or one
kingdom, but that it is to weak to prove that one Pope may govern all the
world. Now be it you had rather give strength to the adversary, than lack
arguments to the defense of your cause.

And as for those titles chief of the Synagogue, chief of the s^nctuarie,
chief of the house of God. I say that that makes much against Archbishops and
Archbeacons, for when as in stead of the Synagogue, and of the sanc^uarie, and
of the house of God or tempee, are come part^cular churches and congregations,
by this reason it follows, that there should be some ch^f, not in every
province or dioesse, but in every congreg^tion, and in deed so ought there to
be cer^ain chief in euer^ congregation, which should govern and rule the rest.
And as for the chief of the families of the Levites, and chief of the families
of the priests, the same was observed in all other tribes of Israel, and by
all these Princes over every tribe and fam^le, as by the Prince of the whole
l^nde God did as it were by diverse lively pictures imprint in their
understanding the chiet^ie and domination of our Savior Christ. Besides this
the order which was appointed in this point, was observed in all the tribes.

Moreover these orders and policies touching the distribution of the offices
of the Levites and priests, and touching the appoin^ment of their governors,
were done of David by the (*) advise 2. Chro. 19.
of the Prophets, Gad and Nathan, which received of the Lord by commandment;
that which they delivered unto David. And if so be that it can be showed, that
Archbishops and Archdeacons came into the church by any commandment of the
Lord, then this allegation has some force, but now being not only not (...),
but also (as I have showed) forbidden, every man does see that this reason has
no place, but serves to the utter overthrow of the Archbishop and Archdeacon.
For if David being such a notable personage, and as it were an Angel of God,
durst not take upon him to bring into the Church, any orders or policies, not
only not against the word of God, but not without a precise word and
commandment of God, who shall dare be so bold as to take upon him the
institution of the chief office of the Church, and to alter the policy that
God has appointed by his servants the Apostles?

Io. Whitgifte.
You run away with the matter, as though all were clear when as it is not
so. You affirm, yt David did apoint these orders and policies touching ye
distribution of the offices of the levites and Priests. etc. by the eduise of
Gad, and Nathan the prophets of God. And for proof hereof you quote in the
margent. 2. Chron. 19. where there is not one word for your purpose, or
signifying any such thing. In deed in the 2. chro. 29. there is affirmed the
like thing. But my L. of Sarisburie has answered you, that such negative
reasons are very weak. And if you will deny it to be a negative reason from
authority, yet can you not deny but that it is as feeble an argument as
almost can be. For what if David did appoint these orders touching the
distribution of the offices of the levites and priests etc. does it therefore
follow that the church at no time may appointe such offices as shall be
thought meet for the government of it, according to the time, places, and
persons? where have you learned of a singular example to make a general rule,
or to frame an argument ex solis particularibus?

In the. 2. Chro. 19. which you have quoted in the margent, there is a not able
place Scripture alleged against himself.
against you: for there express mention is made that Iehosaphat set in
Jerusalem of the Levites, and of the Priests. etc. for the judgment and cause
of the Lord, and made Amariah the Priest chief over them: neither were they

discredit that which that notable Bishop has spoken: but that which I have
alleged of Iehosaphat, 2. Chro. 19. does manifestly iustifye my Lord of
Sarisburies saying, and condemns youres. For there it is to be seen that in
matters of government, orders were appointed which neither were commanded by
any express commandment of God, neither yet expressed in the word of God.

The Answer of the Bishop.
First, this (...) is not proved: for it may well be doubted, whether the

of Religion is the same now that it was then: the difference if there be

substance and accidents was not needful. In the primitive Church God raised
up Apostles, and Prophets, and gave them power ex^, as the gift of tongues,
the gift of healing, the gift of government, etc. In place vvher of he has

And as for the answer which the Bishop makes, that in place of Apostles,
Prophets, ye gifts of tongues, of healing, and of government, are brought in
universities, schools, Bishops and Archbishops: for schools and universities, I
have shewco they have bin always, and therefore cannot come in, to supply the
room of the Apostles and prophets. And whether a man consider the scholars
that learn, or the scholemasters which teach, or the orders appointed for the
government of ye schools, they shall be found to be rather civil than
Ecclesiastical, and therefore can not come in stead of any Ecclesiastical
ministry. If the Bishop do mean that they come in place of the gift of the
tongs, and knowledge of the Gospel that was first given miraculously, I grant
it, and then it makes nothing to this question.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have not showed that schools and universities were always in the Church
of Christ nor you cannot show that there were any universities or schools of
Christians in the Apostles time. I am not disposed to contrary any thing yt is
alleged for universities or schools: neither would I have you to deny this
truth affirmed by my L. of Sarum for it is certain that God works now in the
Church by means of universities and schools, that which he wrought in the
Apostles time myraculously, by his Apostles and prophets. And those gifts of
tongs, healing, government. etc. which he then inspired at once without
teaching, does he now give by little and little using ye ministry of schools,
universities, and such like: wherefore it is true that the Bishop has said.

And whereas you say ye schools whether a man consider ye scholars that learn,
or the scholemasters which teach, or orders appointed for ye government of ye
schools, they shall be found rather civil than Ecclesiastical: If you speak
of schools in a profane or heathenishe common wealth, it is true. But if you
speak of a Christian kingdom it is most untrue. For in a Christian common
wealth, schools are the first nurses, that bring up children in ye true
knowledge of God, and of his word, and prepare many of the^ to the ministry,
both which are Ecclesiastical. Moreover if you talk of universities, such
especially as be in this Realm of England, then whether you consider either ye
masters, fellows, or scholars, or rules or orders appointed for ye government
of them, they be for ye most part Ecclesiastical, and therefore those things
make greatly for the purpose, and you have said nothing that can overthrow them.

As for Bishops they can not come in place of Apostles or prophets, for as much
as they were when the Apostles, Evangelists and prophets were, and are one of
those ministeries, which S. Paul mentions in the. 4. to the Ephesians, being
the same that is the pastor.

Io. Whitgifte.
I told you before, that ye part of the Apostles office which consisted in
government, is now remaining in Archbishops and Bishops, as to visit Churches,
to reform disorders, to suppress contentions and such like: which also they
practiced in the Apostles time, in such places as were committed unto them by
the Apostles, as it is evident in Timothy and Titus.

That Bishops do succeed the Apostles in this function of government it may
appear Bishops succeed Apostles in government. Cyprian.
by sundry learned writers Cyprian Lib. 3. Epist. 9. writes thus. But Deacons
must remember that the Lord has chosen Apostles, that is to say Bishops and
chief governors, but the Apostles after the Ascension of the Lord into heaven
did appoint unto themselves Deacons, Ministers, of their Bishopric, and of
the Church. And Ambrose in. 4. ad Ephe. Ambrose. Zuinglius.
says, Apostoli Episcopi sunt: Apostles are Bishops. Zuinglius also in his
Ecclesiastes says that the Apostles when they left of going from place to
place, and remained in one Church, were no more called Apostles but Bishops,
as James at Jerusalem, and John at Ephesus. Whereby it may appear that it
seems strange neither to the old writers, nor to to the new, to say that
Bishops succeed the Apostles and come in place of the^.

There remains therefore the Archebishoppe, which if he came in place of the
Prophets and Apostles (as the Bishop says) how comes it to pass, that
the bishop says by and by out of the authority of Erasmus that Titus was an
archebishoppe: for at that time there was both Apostles, Prophets, and
Evangelists. If it be so therefore, that the Archbyshoppe must supplye the
want of Apostles. etc. how comes it to pass, he wayteth not his time
whylest they were dead, but comes in like unto one which is borne out of
time, and like the untimely and hastye fruit, which is seldom or never
holesom. And for one to come into the Apostles or Prophets place, requirerh
the authority of him which ordained the Apostles. etc. which is the Lord,
and his institution in his word, which is that which we desire to be showed.
But hereof I have spoken before at large.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is not unknown to such as be willing to learn, that where the Apostles
could not be present themselves, there they appointed some other to govern
the Churches for them: as the Apostle Paul did Titus at Creta. Therefore this
reason of yours is soon answered. And in that that the Apostles did appoint
Bishops in Churches which they had planted, and gave unto them such
authority, it is evident that therein they made them their successors, which
they did not without sufficient testimony and warrant of the spirit of God:
and therefore you do but talk, you prove nothing.

The necessity of Deanes I do not acknowledge, and I have already spoken of
them. Touching Prebendaties I shall have occasion to speak a word hereafter.
For Earls and Dukes and such like titles of honor they are civil, neither
does it follow, that because there may new titles or new offices be
brought into the civil government, that therefore the same may be attempted
in the Church. For God has left a greater liberty in instituting things in
the common wealth than in the Church.

For, for so much as there be diverse Common wealths, and diverse forms of
common wealths, and all good, it falls out, that the offices and dignities
which are good in one common wealth, are not good in an other: as those which
are good in a Monarchy, are not good in Aristocratie: and those which are
good in Aristocratie: are not good in a popular state: But that can not be
said of the Church which is but one and uniform, and has the same laws,
and form of government thorough out the world.

In common wealths also, there are conuersions, one form being changed into
an other which can not be in the true Church of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your acknowledging or not acknowledgyng the necessity of Deanes. etc. is not
greatly material: they depend not upon you. To the example of king Saul the
first king of Israel, you say nothing, and yet it is material. There is no
such difference betwixt the civil government of the common wealth, and the
external government of the Church, but that the one in many things may be
used as an example for the other. And it is untrue yt the external form of
government in the Church ought to be one, and the self same thorough out the
world in all times and places, as it shall hereafter more fully appear. But
still I would have the Reader to note Tract. 17.
what kind of gouernmente of the Church you do allow: and join the same
with that assertion of yours, that the government of the common wealth must
be framed according to the gouernmente of the Church, as the hangyngs to the
house.

As for Erasmus authority which says that Titus was an archbishop, I have
answered to it. And where as Chrysostom says, that the judgment of many
Bishops was committed to Titus, untrue, for you have not as yet spoken one
word of it.
I have declared in what sort it is to be understood, and yet upon these
words the Bishop can hardly conclude, that which he does: that Titus had
the gouernmente of many Bishops. For it is one thing to say, the judgment
of many was committed unto Titus, and an other thing to say, that he had the
government of many.

Io. Whitgifte.
And shall the same answer serve for Lyra too? Well I have answered your
answer to Erasmus. And I trust that these authorities with the Godly Reader
shall have the more credit, because this Reverend Father does herein
confirm their opinions: whose judgment for his singular virtue and learning,
ought to be more esteemed, than a number such as you are.

You neither have answered, nor do answer, nor can answer these words of
Chrysostom, and it is but a very poor shifte, to make such a distinction
betwixt judgment and government. For what is it else to have the judgment
of many Bishops committed unto him, but to have the government? show a
difference if you can: No doubt you would have done it, if you could.
Wherefore this authority of Chrysostom remains untouched: and it confirms
my answer to the Greek Scholiast, who borrowed his words of him. Neither
would you have thus dalyed in this place, if you had looked upon Chrysostomes
words, who there affirms, that Paul did commytte to Titus, the whole isle
of Creta.

The fourth Reason.
The Ecclesiastical and Civil government may not be confounded, or be

in one person. But to be a chief or a ruler is a civil power Ergo it can not
be exercised by any Ecclesiastical person.

The answer of the Bishop.
Both these gouernmentes were confounded in Moses: Therefore Eius solutio.
they may be confounded. And the priests of Israel had the judgment and
government of the people. And Saint Augustine was troubled with hearing and
determining of causes, as it appears by Possidonius.

And where you say to be a chief or a ruler is a civil government, nay in
Ecclesiastical causes it is ecclesiastical government and not civil. And
these differences of government may not so unadvisedly be confounded. This is
the key of ecclesiastical correction, and belongs only to the ecclesiastical
officer, and to none other. Hereof S. Paul says, Seniorem ne corripueris nisi
sub. etc. Tradidi illum Satanae. etc. This jurisdiction is not civil but
ecclesiastical, and therefore may be exercised by any ecclesiastical person.

T. C. Page. 94. Sect. 3.
The answer of the Bishop unto the fourth supposed reason, perteyneth unto
an other question, that is, whether Ecclesiastical persons ought to exercise
civil jurisdiction, whereunto I will answer by Gods grace when I come to
speak upon occasion of M. Doctors book of that question. In the mean time I
will desire the reader to consider what weak grounds the Archebishoppe and
Archedeacon stand upon, seeing that the Bishop of Sarum, being so learned a
man, and of so great readyng, could say no more in their defense, which
notwithstanding in the controversies against Doctor Harding is so pythie and so
plentyfull.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Bishop of Sarum has said much more than you have answered unto: and in
the respect of the reasons he has said fully enough. You may not think but
that if he had bin disposed to have dealt of purpose in this cause, he could
have said much more. But your secret and privy nippes, whereby y^u (...) to
the Reader, that he would willingly defend a false cause, shall never be able
to deface so worthy a Prelate. You may perceive by this his conclusion ((...)
touches you so near) that he took no great care or time for answering these
weak reasons: for thus he concludes, I beseech you to take these sudden
answers in good part: As for these reasons, in my judgment they are not made
to build up, and they are to vveake to pull down. Stultitia nata est in cord
pueri, and virga disciplinae fugabit illam. Proverb. 22. It is but

Thus have I answered in his behalf, who both in this and other like
controversies, might have been a great stay to this Church of England, if we
had been worthy of him. But whilst he lived, and especially after his
notable and most profitable travails, he received the same reward of wicked
and ungrateful tongues, that other men be exercised with, and all must look
for, that will do their duty. But now again to T. C.

The causes of Archbishops and of their prerogatives, and the estate of the
old Bishops, (assigned by T. C.) examined.

Now I have showed how little those things which M. Doctor brings, make for
proof of that wherefore he alleges them, I will for the better understanding
of the reader se^e down what were the causes why the Archbishops were first
ordained* and what were their prerogatives and preheminences before other
Bishops, and the estate also of the old Bishops, which lived in those times,
wherein although there were great corruptions, yet the Church was (...) some
tolerable estate, to the intent it may appear, partly how (...) we have of
them now, and partly also how great difference there is between ours and
them. O^ the names of Metropolitanes it has been spoken, how that he should
not be called the chief o^ priests, or the high priest, or Bishop of Bishops:
Now I will set down their office and power, which they had more than the
Bishops.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you have no more truth in your words following, than y^u utter in the
beginning of these: or if you deal no soundlyer in them, than you have done in
the other, M. Doctors proofs shall serve the turn. But it is in vain to
answer words, I will therefore come to your matter.

In the Council of Antioche it appears that the Bishop of the Metropolitan
seat, called An vnt^ (...)* (...) there is no such thing in that much cano^*
Chap. 9.
Synodes, and propounded the matters which were to be handled, etc. The
archbishop does not ^ew call Synodes, but the Prince does, forasmuch as there
is no convocation without a parliament, and he does not propounde the matters,
and gather the voices, but an other chosen, which is called prolocutor:
therefore in the respect that an Archbishop, and Metropolitan was tyrst
ordained, we have no need of an Archbishop or Metropolitan. Again, an other
cause also appears there An (...) truth.
which was to see that the Bishops kept them selves within their own di^
cesse, and brake not into an others Diocese, but first this may be done
without an Archebishoppe, and then it is not done of the Archbishop
himself, giving licenses unto the wandering ministers to go thoroughout not
so few as a dosen diocese: therefore the office of an archbishop is not
necessary in this respect, and if it were, yet it must be other than it is
now.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no Council more flat against you, than is that Council of
Antioche, nor any Canon that overthrows your assertion more directely than
that ninth Canon, the words whereof I have repeated before, but your untrue
allegation in a manner compels me to repeat them again, that the Reader
may see before his eyes, what truth there is in your doings. And although it
do perteyne to the office of the Metropolitan or Archebishoppe to call
Synodes, yet is there not one word thereof in this Cannon, nor yet of
propounding any matters in Synodes, or of seeing Bishops keep themselves
within their own diocese, as you do here auouche without all truth: and
notwithstanding as I said before, those things do perteine to the office of
the Archebishoppe: yet if they were also comprehended in that Canon, it were
rather a confirmation of that office, than otherwise.

The contents of that Canon be only these: first it says, that it behooves
the Bishops of every country or province to know their Metropolitan
Bishop to have the care and ouersighte, or government over the whole
Province. By the which words, the authority and name of a Metropolitan or
Archebishoppe is most pl^ynely confirmed, and proved to be a permanent off^ce:
Secondly, this Canon wills all those that have any business to do, to
resort to the Metropolitan city. Whereby also is given to the Metropolitan
Bishop great pre-eminence: and therefore it follows immediately, that he
should excel all the rest in honor: and that the other Bishops should
do nothing of importance without him: according to the old rule made by their
forefathers, but only those things which perteyne to their own diocese: and
those places and possessions that perteine unto the same. In which words who
sees not what pre-eminence is given to the Metropolitan over all the
Bishops in his Province: and what jurisdiction to the Bishop in his own
diocese and places perteyning unto it? where also it is to be noted that the
Council says, secundion antiquam a patribus nostris regulam constitutam:
according to the ancient rule appointed of our forefathers. Which argues a
great antiquity of this office. Then it follows: for every Bishop has
authority over his own Diocese, to rule and govern it, iuxta reuerentiam
singulis competentem, according to the reverence due unto every one of them,
and that he has especial care of that whole region that i^ subject to his
City, so that he may ordeyne Priests and Deaeons, and singulasuo iuditio
comprehendat. But he may not attempt any other thing without the Metropolitan
Bishop, nor the Metropolitan do any thing without the counsel of the other
Priests.

What can be more plain, either for the authority of the Arche bishop, or
jurisdiction of the Bishop? and what one word of this Canon have you truly
alleged? and yet it is quoted in your margent.

But if we imagine those things to be true, which you say, how will you
conclude? forsooth, that the Metropolitan did then call Synodes, and
propounded the matters, but now he does not call Synodes, and propounde the
matters: Therefore there is now no need of a Metropolitan. First it is
untrue, that Metropolitanes did then call either all Synodes, or that they
called them of their own authority without the consent of the Prince, and
Civil Magistrate: which thing is evident when the Magistrates were christened.

The Council of Nice was summoned by the commandment of Constantine Co^cels
sum moned by Princes. Euse de vita Constan lib. 3.
the Emperor, Eusebius de vita Constanti. lib. 3. Constantius called the
Council which was in Sardica ciuitate. The Bishops in the Council of
Constanti. confess, that they came together by the Emperoures writ. Ambrose
in the Council of Aquileia, speaking of him (...) and of other Bishops
says, that they were assembled out at Aquileia, by the commandment of the
Emperor: The same does Hierome testifye concerning a Council holden at
Rome, In Epita. Pauli. Pope Iulio Epist. 9. ad Theodos. desires the Emperor,
that by his authority there might be a Council in Italye. Zozomen. libr. 6.
cap. 7. shows how certain Catholyke Bishops entreated the Emperor, that
they might have leave to gather together for the redressing of certain
erroures. But that shall I need to labor in a matter most manifest? No man
can be ignorant that reads Ecclesiastical stories, but that the Emperoures
authority was r^quired in summoning Councels and Synodes, not only general,
but provincial also. Secondly, it is untrue that the Metropolitan in this
Church does not call Synodes, or propounds not the matters in them. etc.
For he does both, although he calls no Provincial Synod, without the
commaund^ment of the Prince, no more than other Metropolitanes have ^oone in
the best time of the Church under christ^an Princes. Last of all, though
all this were true, that is ^eere untruly affirmed, yet were the office of an
Archebishoppe necessary, for it does not only consiste in calling Synodes,
but in sundry things beside, as I have showed before, and this council of
Antioche manyfestly declares. And surely if you would prove any thing hereof
directely, it should be this, that eyth^r the Archebishoppe does not exercise
that jurisdiction which he ought to do, or else can not do that which
perteyneth to his office, and so should you speak for the amendment of the
Archbishops jurisdiction.

Again, you say an other cause appears there, which was to see that the
Bishops kept themselves within their own diocese. etc. but first this may be
done without an Archbishop. etc. I tell you there is no such thing in that
nynthe Canon: I say further, that it may best an^ mos^e orderly be done by
an Archebis^oppe. Thirdely, I answer as before, that it is but one part of
his office. Fourthely, I say unto you, that this is a simple Argument, the
Archebishoppe does not keep such old Canons as be not in use in this
Church, therefore there is no need of his office. Last of all, you ought to
know, that th^se whom^ y^u call wandering ministers, be fai^hefull Preachers a
number of them: And such as labor diligentely in preaching the word, and
have not a little profyted the flock of Christ, so that your conclusion is
not woor^h a straw.

Again the cause why the Metropolitan differed from the rest, and why the
calling of the Synod was given to him, as it appears in the same Council,
was for that the Chap. 9.
greatest concour^e was to that place, and most assembly of men, whereunto
also may be added, for that there was the best commodity of lodgyng and of
vittayling, and for that as it appears in other Counsels, it was the place
and fear of the Empire. But with us neither the greatest conc^urse nor
assembly of men, nor the greatest commodity of lodgyng and vittayi^g, neither
yet the seat of the kingdom is in the Metropolitan city, therefore with us
there is no such cause of a Metropolitan or Archbishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is not alleged as a cause why there should be a Metropolitan, or why
he differed from ye rest, or why the calling of the Synod was given unto him,
but rather why he was placed in the chief city: so that these words touch
not the Metropolitan or his office, but the aptness of the place where he
should continue. And yet if credit be to be given ^yther to interpreters, or
to the gloss in Gratian, cause. 9. quae. 3. per singulas, the words be not as
you interpret them, for thus they be set down in the book of Councels, Tom.
1. Pr^pter quod ad Metropolim omnes vndique qui negoti^ videntur habere
concurrant, For the which let all that have any business have recourse from
all places into the Metropolitan city. An other ^ranslation is thus: Propter
quod ad Metropolitanam ciuitatem ab his qui causas habent con^urratur. And this
last interpretation the authors of the Centuries do use. Cent. 4. Of which
words there can be no such thing gathered, as you do imagine, but far
otherwise. And the meaning of the Council is, that such as have causes to be
heard, may resort to the Metropolitan city where the Metropolitan is.

And you must understand that it was in the power of the Emperor, and other
Princes, to appoint the seat of the Metropolitan, where it pleased them, as it
appears in the. 12. cap. of the Council of Chalcedon, and in the. 17. Hom. of
Chrysostom, Ad populum Antiochenum.

In the Council of Carthage holden in Cyprians time, it appears that no
Bishop had authority over an other, to compel an other, or to condemn an
other, but every Bishop was left at his own liberty to answer unto God, and
to make his accounte unto Christ, and if any thing were done against any
Bishop, it was done by the consent of all the bishops in the province, or
as many as could conuemently assemble. Therefore Cyprian which was the
Metropolitan bishop, had then no authority over the rest, and yet then there
being no christian magistrate T C con^esseth Cyprian to be a Metropolitan.
which would punish the disorders which were committed of the christian
bishops, there was greatest, need that there should have been some one, which
might have had the correction of the rest. If therefore when there was most
need of this absolute authority, there neither was nor might be any such, it
follows that now we have a Christian magistrate, which may and ought to
punyshe the disorders of the Ecclesiastical persons, and may and ought to call
them to account for their faults, that there should be no such need of an
Archbishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
You here fall into the same fault that a little before you ascribed to me,
for you come back from the Council of Antioche, which was Anno. 360. to the
Council of Carthage, being Anno. 260. I omit to tell you, that that Council
concluded an heresy for the which only it was assembled. And therefore though
it be in the book of the Counsels, yet is it not reckened among the Councels:
Only I demand the words of that Council that do signify one Bishop not
to have had authority over an other. I told you before out of Cyprian
himself, and out of Gregory Nazianzene, that he had ample and large
jurisdiction. The words of Cyprian in that Council, which seem to touch
the matter you talk of, I have expounded and answered before, they make not
for your purpose.

It is no reason to prove that a Bishop must not be subject to any, because
he is left at his own liberty to answer to God, and to make his account
unto Christ, For by the same reason he might be exempled from the authority
of the Civil Magistrate, and from all Laws and orders touching Church
matters, and so might every private man in like manner. But you must remember
that a Bishop is so left to his own liberty, to answer unto God, and make
account unto Christ, that he must also acknowledge his duty toward man:
and be subject to orders and laws.

What do you say for the freedom of a Bishop from obedience unto the
Archbishop, but it may be said likewise of his freedom from subjection to
his Prince in like matters: and of every Anabaptist, for his deliverance from
subjection to all superiors* Wherefore you wring Cyprians words to an evil
sense.

You have bin often told that no Archbishop has such power over either Bishop
or inferioure minister, that of his own authority he can do any thing
against them. The laws of the realm will not suffer it, no the Canon law
does by no means permit it: And therefore you do but dream of an authority
that is not.

Cyprian being a Metropolitan had authority over the rest.

The civil Magistrate does govern the ecclesiastical state, punishes
disorders among them, calls them to account for their faults by Archbyshops,
Bishops, and other officers, as he does the same in the civil state, by civil
magistrates. Your meaning is not (I dare say) to have the Prince hear al
matters her self: You will give her leave to appoint under officers, as Moses,
David, Solomon, Iehosaphat, and other good kings have done. If you will not
allow the Magistrate so to do, let us understand your reasons, for surely I
believe there is some such toy in your head.

The moderation of their authority in the ancient times may appear first, by

it ordeyneth one Primate in every nation over the rest, and will not suffer

and he nothing to do with him in it. But as it seems the meaning of the
canon was, that if there were any weighty matter to be concluded for all the
Churches in the nation, then the bishops of every parish should not enterprise
any thing without calling him to council. Now we see that the Archbishop
medleth with that which every Bishop does in his own dioces, and has his
visitations for that purpose, and will take any matter out of their hands,
concludes also of diverse matters, never making the Bishops once privy to his
doings.

Io. Whitgifte.
If it be a false canon or falsely given to the Apostles, why do you use it as
a proof? I might ^ay unto you, as you said before unto me: have you such
penury of proofs, that you are constrained to allege false canons? if it be
a canon of the Council of Antioch, show what canon it is: if it be within that
Council, undoubtedly it is the. 9. canon before by you alleged, and how much
that proves your cause the very ignorant reader may judge.

But let us hear this canon be it true or false, and consider your collections
of it: The canon alleged against himself.
the words I have recited before, but I will set them down again, that your
pythy reasons (reasoning altogyther against your self) may appear. The
Bishops of every nation or country must know who amongst them is chief, whom
they ought to esteem Can. Apost. 34.
as their head, and do nothing without his council, besides those things only,
which belong unto their own parish, and the places which are under it: neither
ought he to do any thing without the advice of them all: for so shall there be
concord, and God shall be glorified by Christ Jesus in the holy Ghost. etc.
Here first there must be a Primate or chief Bishop (that is Archbishop) of
every nation or country, whom the rest of the bishops must acknowledge as it
were for their head. Secondly, the Bishops must do nothing unaccustomed without
him. Thirdly, that the other Bishops may do those things only quae ad parochiam
eius, and regiones ei subditas pertinent: Which perteine unto his parish, and
places subject unto it which last words you leave out. Last of all, that this
Primate must do nothing without their consents: what has the Archbishop lost
by this canon? surely not one jot: I think verily he does not require so much*
Every bishop may do as much in his own dioces now, (the authority of the
Prince and her laws reserved) as he might do by that canon, for the Archbishop
does not rule by will, but by law, not of himself, but under the Prince, to
whom both he and all other bishops be subject.

You hit nothing less than the meaning of the canon: nay undoubtedly you
imagine a sense contrary to the express words of the canon.

When the Archbishop does visit, it is not to make new laws, or appointe
new orders (except he be commanded so to do by greater authority) but to
see those orders and laws kept, that all Bishops and other are bound unto,
and therefore he does nothing in their diocese contrary to that which they are
bound to do, neither does he conclude any thing without them, which by their
consent and authority of the law and Prince is not given unto him.

Higinus or as some think Pelagius (I speak here as Platina reports, not
thinking that Platina cap Higin.
in Higinus time, there was any Metropolitan) ordained that no Metropolitan
should condemn any Bishop, unless the matter were first both heard, and
discussed by the bishops of that province, at what time, and after a great
while, a bishop was the A gross petitio of the principle, or rather an untruth.
same we call a minister. Now the Archbishop will without any further
assistance or discussion by others suspend him, and in the end also throw him
out of his charge, and if he have the same authority over a bishop, as a
bishop over the minister, (as it is said) he may do the like unto him also.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is another forged witness (such sound proofs the man has that
reprooues other men for the like) and yet God knows his witness makes
nothing for him. For who gives authority to the Archbishop to deprive either
Bishop or inferior minister, without due proof and examination of the cause?
touching consent of other, if he deal with him according to law, then deals
he with the consent, not of the other Bishops only, but of all the realm:
because that which is done by law: is done by the consent of all that consented
either to the confirming or making of that law. Your glaunces by the way, (that
there was then no Metropolitan: that then the same were bishops which we now
call ministers) because they be but barely affirmed, it shall be sufficient as
flatly to deny them, and for proof thereof to refer the Reader unto that
which has bin spoken before.

Chap. 5. the. 7. Division.

The council of Antioch ordained, that if the voices of the bishops were even,
and that if Can. 17.

half did condemn him, and half clear him, that then the Metropolitan
bishop should call of the next province some other bishops, which should make
an end of the controversy: whereby appears that the Metropolitan had so
small authority and power over and above the rest, that he had not so much as
the casting voice, when both sides were even. And therefore it appears that
besides the names of Metropolitan, there was little or no resemblance between
those that were then, and those which be now.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have written in the margent the. 17. canon of that council, in the which
there are no such words, nor any thing tending to that purpose: it is the. 14.
canon, that I think you mean, for in that cano^ it is thus determined: that if
a Bishop be judged for Con. Antio. ca. 14.
certain crimes and it happen that the other bishops of the same province
vary in judgment, some thinking him to be innocent, some guilty, for the
resolving of all doubt, it pleased the holy Synod, that the Metropolitan
bishop shall call for other judges out of the next province, to end the
controversy, who together with the Bishops of the same province, shall approve
that which is just and right. Here is no mention of equality in voices, but
only of disagreeing in judgment among the Bishops of the same province.
Likewise in this canon it appears that a Metropolitan had authority over
more provinces than one, for he might call the Bishops of another province to
decide the matter, if the Bishops of the same province could not agree.

I see not how this canon can any thing help you: for now neither the
Metropolitan, The authority of Archbyshops and bishops, less, than in times
past.
nor all the Bishops in the province can deprive any Bishop without the consent
of ye Prince: so that in that point the authority of the Metropolitan is
nothing increased, nor yet the authority of the Bishops. For then as it
appears in the* (...) canon of that council, if a Priest or a Deacon had bin
condemned of his own bishop, o^ a bishop of a Synod, it was not lawful for
them to complain to the Emperor: if they Can. 12.
had complained, it was determined in the same canon, that they should never be
pardoned, nor have any place of satisfaction, nor hope of restitution. But now
it is far otherwise. The. 11. canon of the same council is much to the same
effect. Wherefore the Can. 11.
authority of the Metropolitan and other Bishops is not increased as you
prese^d, but both the Metropolitan and other Bishops had as much authority
then over other priests, ministers, and deacons, as they have now, as appears
by sundry canons of the same council.

In the. 4. canon it is decreede, that if a Bishop condemned by a Synod, or a
priest, or Canon. 4.
a Deacon condemned by his own Bishop, shall take upon him to exercise any
mini^terie, he shall be without all hope of restitution, and who soever does
communicate with him, shall be excommunicated. In the. 5 canon it is thus
determined: If any priest or deacon Canon. 5.
contemning his proper Bishop, has separated himself from the Church, and
gathering people apart, has erected an altar, and has not obeyed the
admonition of his Bishop, neither has consented and agreed unto him calling
him back diverse times, let this man be condemned, and deposed by all means,
and let him not obtain any remedy afterward, because he cannot receive again
his dignity. But if he persist to trouble the Church, let him be corrected by
the outward power as a seditious person. By these canons it is evident that the
Bishop of every several diocese had authority by himself to excommunicate,
to deprive, and to seclude from the ministry any priest, deacon, or any other
of the clergy in more ample and large manner, than he has at this day. The
which thing also may be seen in the. 6. and. 12. canons of the same Council:
so that you have sought for help at the Council, which is one of the greatest
enemies to this your assertion, and does flatly condemn it. Diverse canons of
the which Council, if they were practiced, would soon remedy the sects and
schisms which you have stirred.

Now, to consider how the Bishops which are now, differ from the Bishops, which
were in times past, I must call to thy remembrance (gentle reader) that which I
have spoken before, which was that then there was, as appears out of Cyprian,
and Jerome and others, one Bishop in every Many untruths heaped together
parish or congregation: now one is over a thousand, then every Bishop had a
several Church where he preached and ministered the sacraments: now he has
none, then he ruled that one Church (as I showed out of Jerome) in common with
the elders of the same: now he rules a thousand by himself, shutting out the
ministers, to whom the rule and government belongs: then he ordained not any
minister of the Church, except he were first chosen by the presbytery, and
approved by the people of that place whereunto he was ordained: now he
ordeyneth where there is no place void, and of his private authority, without
either choice or approbation of presbytery or people. Then he excommunicated
not, nor received the excommunicated, but by sentences of the eldership, and
consent of the people, as shall appear afterward: now he does both. And thus
you see that contrary to the word of God, he has gotten into his own hand,
and pulled to himself both the prehemine^ce of the other ministers, and the
liberties of the Church, which God by his word had given.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is scarce one word of all this true, and surely I much marvel that
you dare be so bold so manifestly to speak against your own conscience and
knowledge. I have before sufficiently proved all that is here by you avouched,
to be clean contrary for the most part. It shall be therefore sufficient, as
briefly now to answer, as you do propound. Demetrius was Bishop of all the
dioces in Egypt and Alexandria. Euse. li. 6. cap. 1 Cypr. li. 4. ep. 8
Chrysostom.
Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 1. Cyprian was Bishop of Carthage, Numidia, Mauritania,

testifyeth ad Tit. 1. I^ aue before by sundry Idem.
examples and testimonies, by diverse councels, and especially the council of
Nice, (...) the vanity and untruth of this that is here affirmed, that is,
that there was one Bishop in every parish and congregation: and the words of
Cyprian and Jerome be clean ^rary: for they both make a difference between a
Bishop, to whom the government of many pastors is committed, and a pastor that
has but one several flock or charge. For further understanding whereof, I
refer ye Reader to that, which is spoken before.

The bishops have now as several churches to preach and minister the
sacraments in, as they had then. They have no more authority in government
now, than they had at that time, nor so much: and yet if they had more
authority than they either have now, or had then, I think it were more for
the commodity of the Church, the state of the time, and conditions of men
considered.

As for ruling every several church by those, which you call Elders, you
have showed no such thing out of Jerome, neither can you. For Jerome in that
place you mean, by presbyteri means Priests, as he does in all other places
that I remember. Neither does he there speak of particular parishes.

Touching the electing and ordeyning of ministers, sufficient has bin spoken
before. Tract. 3.
The Bishop does nothing therein, but that which he may justly by the word of
God, and testimony of the best and most worthy writers.

Of excommunication we shall speak hereafter, you do glance at it now out of
Tract. 18.
place. And thus he that is an indifferent Reader may understand that the
Bishops in these days in this Church of England have no other authority, than
the word of God does give unto them: The Bishops of the primitive Church have
pract^sed: ye liberty of the Church well bears: and the state of the time,
and condition of men requires.

And as for the offices wherein there is any labor or travail, those they
have turned unto the other ministers, as for example in tunes past A worthy
council.
it was not lawful for him that was then an Hispal. con. ca.
elder, to preach or minister the sacraments in the presence of the Bishop,
because the Bishop himself should do it, and now those which they call elders,
may preach and minister the sacraments by the Bishops good license, although he
be present.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no just cause of complaint for most of the Bishops in that behalf.
For I think the time has not bin, wherein there were more preaching Bishops,
than are at this day, in this Church. But do you think that a minister may not
preach or minister the sacraments in the presence of the Bishop? Or do you so
well allow of A corrupt council alleged.
that Council and canon quoted in your margent? It was the second council
called Hispalense concilium, it was not general, but provincial, celebrated
Anno. Dom. 659. the contents of the canon by you alleged are these. That a
Priest may not consecrate alters, but only the Bishop: that a Priest and
Chorepiscopi may not consecrate virgins, erect altars, Hisp. Con. 2. Can. 7.
bless and anoint them, hallow churches, make holy oil, and such like, but
only the Bishop. Likewise that no priest may baptize, say Mass* teach the
people, or bless them in the presence of the Bishop. Surely this is a worthy
Council, and a notable canon, especially for you to allege, that have so
depraved other worthy writers for some imperfections found in them.

But what does it make for your purpose? They might both preach and minister
The council alleged against himself
the sacraments in the presence of the Bishop, if he willed them, and so is the
canon. This law was made for the increasing of the Bishops pomp and dignity:
for no man might presume to speak or do any thing in their presence, without
their leave and license: so were they esteemed the^, and such authority had
they. But if our Bishops should claim the like, you would say that it were an
intolerable arrogancy and pride.

I would to God all those that be deluded by you, would consider your
allegations, and the grounds of your proofs. Surely I would be loath to
allege any Council of that time to prove any thing in controversy. Much more
loath would I be to (...) so corrupt a canon: but lothest of all to allege

make this difference betwixt our Bishops and those of the primitive church, if
they were true, yet were they no saults in the office, but in the men: as for

began to make a Bishop of a whole dioces, and of a thousand congregations.

Io. Whitgifte.
If the pomp began as you say, then began it in the Apostles time, for then
began they to make one Bishop over a whole diocese, as Timothy almost over
all Asia, and Titus over all Creta, as I have declared. Which order has bin
from that day to this observed throughout all Christendom, as it may appear
by that, which is already said.

Bishop in every parish, and upon how corrupt and evil consideration one Bishop
was set over a whole diocese. No doubt, those that were authors of this, had
learned to well our old proverb, the fewer the better cheer, but the more
Bishops, the merier it had bin with Gods people.

Io. Whitgifte.
This epistle was written by Pope Zachary to one Boniface which was Bishop in
France, and not to Pope Boniface: moreover it is in the. 2. tome of Councels,
and you have quoted in your margent the third. But to the matter.

You have not one word in that epistle to prove that there was wont at any time
The Epistle of Pope Zachary falsified
to be in every parish a Bishop. And you have falsely alleged the words of
the epistle: for these words (least they should wax vile through the
multitude) are not there to be found. The words of the Epistle be there. For you
must remember what we are commanded by the old canons to observe, that we
ought not to ordein Bishops in villages, and small cities, least the name of a
Bishop should wax vile. What one word is there here of placing Bishops in
every parish? Zachary tells Boniface, that it is according to the old
canons that Bishops should not be placed in such small cities, but in more ample
and large cities, because the contemptiblenesse of the place, does oftentimes
bring contempt to the person, and a Bishop ought to be esteemed and reverenced.
If you had red the epistle, you should have perceived that this Boniface had
lately converted to christianity interiorem Germaniam, and that he had
ordained among them certain Bishops to govern them, whom he desired Pope
Zachary by his authority to confirm, to whom Pope Zachary answering,
wills him to consider whether the places be so convenient, or the number of
the people so great, vt Episcopos habere mereantur. Meminerimus enim (says he)
quid in sacris canonibus. etc. as I have rehearsed them before* And a little
after he names the places, where he will have the bishops seats (...) that
there is nothing less meant, than that there was in every parish a Bishop,
(...) much as there was there before no Bishop in any parish: but this is all
that may be gathered, that the seats of Bishops were by the old canons
appointed to be in the best cities, and most famous places: which to be true you
may soon perceive in those canons themselves, mentioned here by Zachary: they
are to be found. did. 80.

And they might with as good reason hinder the sun from shining in all
places, and the rain (...) falling upon al grounds, for fear they should not

pretense of delivering the Bishop from contempt, they sought nothing else but
an ambitious and stately Lordship over those, which had not that title of
Bishop that they had, although they did the office of a Bishop better than they
did. And what intolerable presumption is this, to change the institution of
God, as though he When, or where did God ordeyne this?
which ordained not one only, but some number more or less of Bishops in every
Church, did not sufficiently foresee, that the multitude and plenty of Bishops
could breed no contempt of the office. And it may be as well ordained that the
children of poor men should not call them that begar them, fathers and
mothers, but only the children of the rich, and of the noble, least that if
every man that has children, should be called a father, fathers should be set
nothing by.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is a marvelous matter that you delight to run so fast upon a false
string: I tell you once again, that you never red that Epistle, neither yet
those canons that it speaks of. If you had red them, you would never have
affirmed (if there be any modesty left in you) that the multitude of Bishops
is alleged there as a cause of contempt, no such thing being mentioned. The
canons have a very good consideration, and be not wicked, but wise and godly.
This superiority of Bishops is Gods own institution, and it has a necessary
use in the Church of God, as is showed before. It has bin, and may be abused:
and it is, and may be well used. All these glorious words of yours, are but
very words, and therefore as words, I will commit them to the wind.

This one thing I cannot let pass that you say, God ordained not one only,
but some But one Bishop in a city
number more or less of Bishops in every Church. What scripture have you to
prove that there should be more Bishops than one in one Church? What one
example in all the primitive Church have you to warrant this your assertion? Nay
you have the whole practice of the Church to the contrary, even from the
beginning. James alone was Bishop of Jerusalem, Timothy of Ephesus, Titus of
Creta, Clemens of Rome. etc. and it has bin always compted as monstrous to
have two Bishops of one city, as to have two heads of one body But such bold
assertions without proof, are meet principles for such a ruinous and totering
platform, as you dream of.

And here let us observe by what degrees and stayers, Satan lifted the child
of perdition unto that proud title of universal Bishop. First In what place of
scripture*
where the Lord did ordeyne that there should be diverse pastors, elders, or
Bishops in every congregation, Is not this soundly proved*
Satan wrought first, that there should be but one in every Church: this was
no doubt the first step. Afterward he pushed further, and stirred up diverse
not to content themselves to be Bishops of one Church, but to desire to be
Bishops of a dioces, whereunto although it seems that there was resistance (in
that it is said, that it was decreede often) yet in the end this wicked attempt
prevailed, and this was another step: then were there Archbyshops of whole
provinces, which was the third stayer unto the seat of Antichrist.
Afterward they were patriarchs of one of the four corners of the whole
world, the whole Church being assigned to the jurisdiction of four, that is to
say of the Roman, Constantinopolitane, Antiochene, and Alexandrine Bishops,
and these four stayers being laid of Satan, there was but an easy stride
for the Bishop of Rome into that chair of pestilence, wherein he now sits.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is as coldely proved, as it is boldly affirmed, for here is neither
scripture, doctor, story, Council, or any thing else, but ipse dixit. How
prove you that the Lord ordained that there should be in every congregation
diverse pastors, elders, or Bishops? The place of scripture (if there be any)
had bin soon quoted. Or how prove you that Satan wrought first that there
should be but one in every Church? Is it Satha^s work Satan not the cause of
one Bishop in one church.
that one Church should have but one pastor? This is strange doctrine, and far
from an Apostolical spirit: contrary to the practice of the Apostles, and of
the Church even from the beginning. But seeing you have so barely set it down
without any kind of proof, I will pass it over, by putting you to your
proof. But yet tell me, did Satan stir up Timothy and Titus, who were
Bishops of one whole diocese? Did he stir up the other ancient fathers and
godly Bishops of whom I have spoken? Whither will this slanderous mouth
reach? whom will this venomous tongue spare, if it speak so spitefully of
such worthy Pastors?

Your collection of resistance that has been to such superiority (being
grounded of the place, that you never saw nor red) is rash and unadvised. For
if you had seen either that Epistle, or those Canons, you would (or at the
least you might) have learned another lesson.

Archbishops, Patriarchs, etc. were allowed by the Council of Nice, the
godlyest, and the most perfect Council (since the Apostles time) that ever
was. And did Satan rule there also and prevail? O that Arius were alive to
hear it. These steps whereof you make Satan the author, and whereby you
say, the Bishop of Rome has ascended into the Chair of pestilence, etc. have
been the best, and most convenient kind of government, that ever was in the
Church since the Apostles time: approved and allowed by the best Councels, and
the next means to have kept Antichrist out of his seat, if in all places they
had remained in their full force and authority.

But this I may not pass over, that you in effect confess your kind of
government by elders to have ceased before the Council of Nice, and also one
Bishop to have been over one whole Diocese before that time, in that you say
that the child of perdition was lifted up by these degrees, the last whereof
was allowed in the Nicene Council.

A man would have thought that you being so great an enemy to those degrees,
would not have thus concluded upon so small proof, and the same utterly
untrue: using only for your ground the Epistle of Pope Zachary, which makes
nothing for your purpose. Now let us see, how far the Bishops of our time are

And here I call to remembrance, that which was spoken of the poor estate of
Basil, and Theodorete: and if M. Doctor will say (as he does indeed in a
certain place) that then was a time of persecution, and this is a time of
peace, it is easily answered, that although Basil were under persecution, yet
Theodorete lived under good Emperors. But that shall appear better by the
Canons which were rules given for the Bishops to frame themselves by.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is for lack of other examples, that you are constreyned to repeat these:
To the poorness of Theodorete I have answered: there may be as poor Bishops
now, as there was then, and there might be as rich Bishops then, as there are
now. It is not one or two examples that can prove the contrary.

In the. 52. and. 53. Canons of the same Council, Clearkes, how learned so
ever they be in Gods word, are willed to get their living by some occupation,
or by husbandry, but I think you will not have them so to do now at this

Church. If God has dealt now more bountifully with his Church in external
benefits, if he has put into the hearts of Christian Princes thus to deal
with the ministers of the word: and if this state and condition be necessary
for this time, and people, why should you envy it? Riches and fair houses be
no hindrances, but helps, if they be used accordingly: and commonly
hypocrisy and pride, lies hid under the name of poverty and simplicity.

cupbordes are laden with plate, whose tables and diets, are furnished with
multitude and diversity of dishes, whose daily dinners are feasts, let them I
say be compared together, and they shall be found so unlike, that if those old
Bishops were alive, they would not know each other. For they would think that
ours were Princes, and ours would think that they were some hedge Priests,
not worthy of their acquaintance or fellowship.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you mean the first Tyronense Concilium, there is no such thing to be found

profitable admonition for you and such as you are, for it forbids under the
pain of excommunication, that any being a Clearke should leave of his calling,
and become a lay man. If you mean the second Tyronense Concilium. I make you
the like answer. Belike your collector has deceived you, but what if it were
so? This only might be gathered, that unless Bishops then had been welthie,
there should not have needed a decree against feasting. If our Bishops should
make the like now, it would be thought they did it for sparing. And I think
that, and such like Canons meet not only for Bishops, but for all states and
degrees of men.

state of the Country is to be observed. Let our Bishops be compared with
them in truth of doctrine, in honesty of life, in diligent walking in their
vocation, and in knowledge (I speak of the most in both ages) and I think
the difference will not be so great, but that they may both know one
another, and very well agree among themselves: this only excepted, that the
doctrine of the Gospel is now much more purely professed by our Bishops, than
it was at that time by them, for both the Councels are in sundry points very
corrupt.

Io. Whitgifte.
A poor quarrel: though this humility is to be required in all Bishops, yet
is it to be used with discretion: for thus to deal with a proud and hawtie
stomach, were but to give nourishment to arrogancy and contempt. It is meet
that every man have that honor and reverence given unto him, which his place,
his office, and his person requires. And as it is humility in him to remitte
any part of it: even so it is an intolerable contempt and pride for those that
be inferiors, so to look for such equality, that in the mean time they
refuse to do that, which civility, good manners, and duty requires. But
let all men consider those notes and tokens of your hawtie stomachs, and
persuade themselves, that it would not be long before you would challenge the
same equality, with other states and degrees in like manner.

Church and common wealth also with all kind of disorders, and greater
incommodities, than I mind to speak of, because it is not my purpose.

In Eusebius it is said that Paulus Samosatenus used to walk publicly in the
market places reading letters and boasting himself, being accompanied with a
number (...), that is accompanied with spearemen, and halbardes. The example of

of Soldiers some before him and some behind him, more like to a Captain
than a Bishop. If any of our Bishops walk in the streets to be seen, or
stand in the market places, or other open and public assemblies reading of
letters, accompanied with Soldiers and men of war, then may it be truly
said of them, that is here truly spoken of Paulus Samosatenus. But if they
being far from such vanity, keep that countenance and retinue of men, which
their place, the manner of their Country, the honor of the Prince, the state
of the Church requires, then do you uncharitably and unjustly apply this
example against them. But unless Paulus Samosatenus had been rich and
wealthy, how could this pomp of his have been mainteyned? Wherefore this
example is rather against you, than for you: neither does it condemn wealth
and riches in Bishops, but pride, vainglorie, and lightness. For they accuse
him of spoiling the Church, and thereby enriching himself.

In the example of George, whom you ^all Gregory, mentioned in ^uffine, there
is no word spoken of any serving men, or soldiers: only he is there
reproved, because he got his Bishoprike by violence, and thought that the
office of judgment in Rufsin. lib. 1. cap. 23.
civil causes was rather committed unto him, than the Priesthood. etc. If any
Bishop offend in the like with us, it is the fault of the man, not of the
office. By this example also it may appear, that Bishops in those days had
riches and authority: For this abusing of their wealth and authority, does
argue that they had both, which they might have used rightly and well.

And here I will note another cause which brought in this pomp, and princely
estate of Bishops, wherein although I will say more in a word for the pompous
estate, than M. doctor has done in all his treatise: yet I will show that
although it were more tolerable at the first, now it is by no means to be
borne with. Theo. li. ^ cap. 8.
In the Ecclesiastical Story we read that the inscriptions of diverse
Epistles sent unto Bishops were (...). Li. eodem cap. 18.
We read also of (...) house of salutations, which Ambrose Bishop of Millayn
had. As for the title of (most honorable Lords) it was not so great, nor so
stately, as the name of a Lord or knight in our Country, for all those that
know the manner of the speech of the Grecians do well understand, how they
used to call every one of any mean countenance in the common wealth where he
lived (...); that is Lord, so we see also the Evangelists turn Rabbi which
signifies master by the Gre^ke word (...) Lord, as likewise in France they
call every one that is a Gentleman, or has any honest place Monseur, and so
they will say also, saving your honor. Now we know this word (Lord) in our
Country is used otherwise, to note some great personage, either by reason of
birth, or by reason of some high dignity in the common wealth, which he
occupies, and therefore those tytles although they were somewhat excessive,
yet were they nothing so swelling and stately as ours are.

most honorable Lord, for that title was only given to such as were of great
dignity and authority: as it is in the place of Theodorete (by you quoted)
given to Bishops: and therefore you have made an objection, which you cannot
answer. This word Lord, does signify pre-eminence and superiority, and
having this title ( most honorable,) joined with it, it cannot but signify
some great state and degree of authority.

The same I answer to that, which follows. And yet Rabbi was a name given

which were Rabbi.
endued with some honor: and in that the Evangelists do translate it Lord,
it is manifest that this name, Lord, signified then a degree of superiority:
but having (as I said) this title ( most honorable) added unto it, as it is
in that place of Theodorete, it cannot but signify some especial
pre-eminence, and therefore equivalent with the titles now used. Master Calvin
upon the. 20. of John. verse. 16, says that ( Rabboni) Calvin.
which is there interpreted (master) is nomen non modo ^onorificum: not only
an honouble name, but also, quod professionem continet obedientiae, such as
conteyneth a profession of obedience.

But do the tytles of honor, and degree given unto Bishops so much trouble
your hawtie stomach? Surely you are not then of that spirit, that the old
ancient Uerie honorable titles given to bishops.
fathers were, who disdeyned not to call Bishops by as honorable tytles as
we do: look in Atha. his. 2. Apol you shall there find the Synod gathered

are called domini preciosissimi, most excellent or worthy Lords. And it is
evident in the same book, that there was no other title given to the Emperor
himself, for there he is only called ( Lord) and so were other of his
Nobles in like manner. So that in those days it was not grudged at, to give
unto Bishops the same ty^les of honor, that was given to the Emperor and
other Nobles. The name of ( most reverend) is as much as the name of most
honorable, and yet was that name also given unto Bishops in Athanasius time,
as appears in the same book in sundry places. For Athanasius him self is
called by his Priests and Deacons reuerendissimus Episcopus.

answer to them that say they do help the Church by this means, I will
refer the reader to that, which Jerome writes in an Epistle ad Nepotianum

Your answer for Ambrose his house has no probability in it, for the words

from whence such unlikely assertions without any show of proof do come.

The Uniuersityes are much beholding to you for your care over them: but what
reasons have you used against the lyuings and houses of Bishops, that may not
also be used against their lands and Colleges: for in times past, when that
Council of Carthage (before by you alleged) was holden, there were nosuche
Colleges endued with such possessions, as there are now. Neither are there
(as I have heard) in Christendom the like Colleges, and the like livings for
Studie^es, as are in this Realm of England. Wherefore if such examples and
conditions of Countries, times, and persons be sufficient to overthrow
Bishops houses and lands, I see not how Colleges can stand long after
them, and therefore we pray you speak for your self, we require not the help
of so evil a Proctour. Would you seek to mainteyne learning with the spoil

such like which at all times are in like manner to be condemned. But does he
that reproves the abuse, condemn the thing? It is a fault by covetous or
unjust dealing to wax rich: but yet it is no fault to be rich. Pride in
apparel is to be condemned: but yet every man may lawfully wear that
apparel, that is meet for his degree. No man allows gluttony or immoderate
seasting: neither does any wise man condenme a plentiful table, and good house
keeping. It is not good dealing to apply that which is spoken against the
abuse of a thing, to the condemning and quite ever throw of the thing it self,

By this which I have cyted it appears, what was one cause of this excess

we see in that point the nature of man is to ready to follow, if they see any

trim houses, which they had built them selves of their own charge before they
were Bishops, that therefore they should come out of their chambers or narrow
houses into courts and palaces, builded of the Churches costs.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where have you showed any such thing by Ambrose his example? or how does it
appear that by such means the pomp of the Bishops (as you call it) was
brought in? That which you speak of Ambrose house is most untrue: it was
perteyning to the Bishop, and no part of Ambrose his proper possessions, as it
is evident by this, that it was near unto the Church, even within the limits,
of the Church, as I have said before.

Another reason of this pomp and stateliness of the Bishops was, that which
almost brought in all poison and popish corruption into the church, and that is
a foolish emulation of the manners and fashions of the idolatrous nations. For
as this was the craft of Satan to draw away the Israelites from the true
service of God, by their fond desire they had to conform themselves to the
fashions of the Gentiles, so to punish unthankful receiving of the Gospel,
and to fulfill the Prophecies touching the man of sin; the Lord suffered those
that professed Christ to corrupt their ways, by the same sleyght of the Devil.

Io. Whitgifte.
If it be enough to say without any kind of proof, then you have said some
thing: T. C. still offende^h (...) petitione princip^.
but if words without proofs be but light, then are these words so to be
esteemed, and not otherwise. I know the Papists through foolish imitation of
the Gentiles, have brought in sundry superstitions of the Gentiles. But I
speak of the matter we have in hand, that is inequality of degrees; and
authority among the ministers of the Church, and the names and offices of
Archbishop, Bishop, Archdeacon, etc. which you neither have showed, nor can
show to be brought into the Church, by any imitation of the Gentiles, and
therefore you do still Petere principium.

be priests, and that they might be in great estimation gave each of them a
train of men to follow them: A (...) collection.
and now the Christians and Christian Emperors thinking that that would
promote the Christian religion, that promoted superstition, and not remembering
that it is often times abominable before God, which is esteemed in the eyes of
men* endeavored to make their Bishops encounter and match with those idolatrous
priests, and to cause that they should not be inferior to them in wealth and
outward pomp. And therefore I conclude, that seeing the causes and fountaynes,
from whence this pomp and stateliness of Bishops have come, are so corrupt
and naught, the thing it self which has risen of such causes can not be good.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no such thing in that place of Eusebius quoted in your margent: for
in that book and chapter of Eusebius, he only shows that Inchaunters and
Sorcerers were greatly esteemed of Maximinus, and that he builded Churches of
Idols in every City, and appointed idolatrous Priests in every place, also
that he placed in every province one to be chief over the rest, and furnished
him with soldiers and servants: but there is not one word, that any
Christian Prince took any example of him to do the like in Christianity. It
rather appears that Maximinus did in this point imitate the Christians, who
had their Metropolitanes, and one chief Bishop in every province long before
this time, as I have declared before. And I see no cause why you should say
that Christians did follow the Gentiles rather in providing for the ministers
of the Gospel sufficiently, than in buylding of Churches in every City, and
placing ministers in them, for Maximinus did this as well as he did the other.
This I am well assured of, that there is no such signification in that place of
Eusebius, that any Christian Prince should follow this example. And therefore
your conclusion being collected and gathered of such false and untrue
conjectures, must needs be like unto them.

I do not speak to maintain any excessive or outrageous pomp, but I speak
of the ^egrees in the Ecclesiastical state, and of the manners and conditions
of the persons, as they be now according to the laws and customs allowed in
this Church of England.

And thus will I make an end^, leaving to the consideration and indifferent
waying of the indifferent reader, how true it is that I have before propounded,
that our Archbishops, Metropolitanes, Archdeacons, Bishops, have besides the
names almost nothing common (...) those, which have been in ^lder times,
before the sun of the Gospel began to be maruelously darkened, by the
stinking mistes which the Devil sent forth out of the bottomless pit, to
blind the eyes of men, that they should not see the shame and nakedness of
that purpled whore, which in the person of the Clergy, long before she gatte
into her seat, prepared her self by payntyng hi^ writhen face, with the
colors of these gorgeous titles, and with the show of magnificall and worldly
pomp. For the Devil knew well enough, that if he should have set up one
only Bishop in that seat of perdition, and left all the rest in that
simplicity, wherein God had appointed them, that his eldest son should
neither have had any way to get into that, and when he had gotten it, yet being
as it were an owl amongst a sort of birds, should have been quickly
discovered.

Io. Whitgifte.
And I also leave it to the judgment of the learned and indifferent Reader,
(...) consider by that, which I have said before, how untrue all this is, that
you here affirm, (I speak of these degrees and offices as they be now used
in this Church of England) if there be any difference, it is because they have
not so large and ample jurisdiction and authority now, as they had then.

purpose. Under the pretense of zeal, he has engendered sects and schisms:
under the title of purity and perfection, he has brought in heresy: under
the cloak of simplicity, he has spread abroad many kinds of idolatry and
superstition: under the shadow of humility, he has covered intolerable
ambition, and marvelous arrogancy: and what soever he brings to pass,
commonly he does it under the color of virtue, and of that which is good: and
therefore I think that even under the names and titles of lawful degrees and
calling, he has established unlawful authority: but neither is true zeal,
purity, perfection, simplicity, humility, nor yet lawful degrees and

must not therefore the less esteem of virtue, but rather learn prudently to
discern what is the difference betwixt the one and the other. If we have not
learned this lesson, what state in the common wealth, what office, what degree
of person, nay what kind of government shall we allow? it is the greatest
folly in the world to condemn the thing it self, because of the abuse.

should allege their examples, to confirm the Archbishops and Bishops that
now are.

Other things concerning the offices and authority of our Clergy, of

Concerning the offices of an high commissioner and justice of peace, how
necessarily they be committed to some of the best and wisest of the Clergy,
what vice by them is bridled, what inconvenience met with, what necessary

affairs and government. There is no word of God to prove why these offices
may not concur in one man. But it is the commission that troubles these men,
as for peace they are at defiance with it.

Concerning the offices of co^missionership, and how unmeet it is that

And until that (afterward) be performed, will I also differ that, which is
further to be said in this matter.

Chap. 6. the. 2. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 76. Sect. 1. 2. 3. and Page 77. Sect. 1.
To be short, they say that all these offices be plainly in Gods word
forbidden, and they allege Math. 23. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 4. 1. Pet. 5. The places
of Matthew and Luke be answered before. Christ beats Tract. 1.
down ambition and pride, and desire of bearing rule, as he did before, when
he said, be ye not called Rabbi, and call no man father, be not called
Doctors, he does not condemn the names, but the ambition of the mind.

In the. 1. Cor. 4. it is thus written, Let a man thus think of us, as of the
ministers of Christ, etc. The ministers of the word in deed are not to be
esteemed as Gods, but as the ministers of God. Some among the Corinthians
gloried in their ministers, and attributed to much unto them. Here of came
these factio^s, I hold of Paul, I of Apollo, etc. This teaches your
adherentes and disciples, not to attribute to much to you, and such as you are,
or any other minister of Gods word. It makes nothing against the names or
authorities either of Archbishop, Lordbishop, or any other that you have named,
who be the ministers of Christ, and ought so to be esteemed.

The place of S. Peter cap. 5. is this, Feed the flock of God, etc. not as
though you were Lords over the flock, etc. Peter here condemns hautinesse,
contempt, and tyranny of pastors toward their flocks, he does not take away
lawful government. The Pastor has rule and superiority over his flock, but
it must not be tyrannical.

These be but very slender proofs that the names and offices of Archbyshops,
Lordbysh. etc. be plainly forbidden by the word of God.

Surely you had thought that no man would have ever taken pains to examine
your margent.

T. C. Page 98. Sect. vlt.
To your answer also unto the places of S. Matthew and Luke the reply is made
before. The place of the fourth of the first to the Corinthians is well
alleged, for it teaches a moderate estimation of the ministers, and a mean
between the contempt and excessive estimation: neither can there be any
readier way to breed that disorder, which was amongst the Corinthians, as to
say I hold of such a one, and I of such a one, and I of such another, than to
set up certain ministers in so high titles, and great show of worldly honor:
for so comes it to pass that the people will say, I will believe my Lord,
and my Lord Archbishop, what soever our person say, for they be wise men and
learned, as we ^ee it came to pass amongst the Corinthians. For the false
Apostles because they had a show and outward pomp of speech, they carried away
the people. For although S. Paul says that some said I hold of Paul, I
hold of Apollo, I of Cephas, yet as it appears in his fourth chapter, they
held one of this brave eloquent teacher, and another of that. For he
translated these speeches unto him and his fellows by a figure. All that rule
is tyrannical which is not lawful, and is more than it ought to be. And
therefore the place of S. Peter is fitly alleged, whereof also I have spoken
some thing before.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Corinthians did not brust out into these factions and parts taking, in
respect of any title or office committed to any of their preachers: but it was
a partial affection that they had toward their teachers in preferring them
(for their supposed virtue and learning) before other of whom they had not
conceived so good an opinion. A more lively example whereof can not be, than
the dissentio^ that is at this day, wherein some of your fautors forgetting all
modesty, do so greatly (...) you, and your companions, that nothing may be
heard, that is spoken to the contrary: nay in comparison, all other men be
flatterers, worldlinges, unlearned, doltes, and asses. So do some sort of men
extol you, and contemn other: so did the Corinthians extol and magniffe
their false Prophets, and deprave the true preachers. Wherefore to take away
this partial affection and judgment, the Apostle says, Sic nos aestimet
homo, etc. Let a man so esteem 1. Cor. 4.
of us, as of the ministers of Christ, etc. You will not (I am sure)
acknowledge that at this time among the Corinthians there was any such
difference of titles, or degrees of superiority. Wherefore you cannot (speaking
as you think) say that the Apostle in this place means any such matter. But
well you wotte that these affections (which I have spoken of) were rife among
them, and therefore it is most certain that the Apostle laboreth for the
suppression of them. So that the interpretation, that I have given of this
place in mine Answer, is true, neither have you refelled it.

The rule that a Bishop has over other ministers in his diocese is lawful:
neither is it such tyrannical rule as the word (...) (used by S. Peter, and
spoken of before) does signify, that is to rule with oppression: and therefore
the place is unaptly alleged.

And I have showed how untruly you have reported of me. Hemingius allows

the beginninges and procedings of the Anabaptists, you shall perceive that
they first began with the ministry, in the self same manner and form that
you now do.

The Pharesies when our savior Christ inueighed against their ambiti^, accused

Archbishop, etc. neighbors unto the civil magistrates, and yet they almost
dwell as far a sunder as Rome and Jerusalem, and as Sion and S. Peter's Church
there, so that the house of the Archbishop may be burnte stick and stone, when
not so much as the smoke shall approach the house of the civil magistrate.

Io. Whitgifte.
In the star that is in your forehead, in the accustomed practices of the
Anabaptists, Equality of ministers will pull on the equality of other estates.
Page 144. Sect. 1.
in the places of scripture alleged by the Admonition for the equality of all
ministers, which very same the Anabaptists do also use against the civil
magistrate. To be short, I see it in your own words, where you say that the
government of the common wealth must be framed according to the government of
the church, and what kind of government you would have in the Church, who
knows not? I do not take upon me to prophecy, but ex antecedentibus colligo
consequentia, I gather that we shall have storms, by the black clouds. You
are not Christ, neither is your cause like unto his, and therefore you make a
very unequal comparison. To whom the name of Pharisie does most aptly agree,
is showed in my Answer to the Admonition.

The self same reasons overthrow the civil magistrate, that overthrows the
Ecclesiastical. And therefore the fire kindled against the one, must needs
be very dangerous for the other.

In stead of the Seniors in Romans 12. 8.
every Church the Pope has brought in, and yet we mainteyne the Lordship of
one man over sundry Churches, yea over many shyres.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 116. Sect. 1. 2.
I have proved before in my answer to your. 13. and 14. reason, that this
lordship of one man (as you term it) but in deed lawful jurisdiction over
sundry churches, was not the invention of any Pope, but of great antiquity in
the church of Christ, allowed by that famous Council of Nice, and practiced
since of most godly and learned fathers.

In the. 9. Canon. Council. Antioch it is thus written: Per singulas regiones
Episcopos conuenit nosse Metropolitanum Episcopum solicitudinem totius
prouinciae gerere, propter quod ad Metropolim omnes vndique qui negotia
videntur habere, concurrant, vnde placuit ^um and bonore praecellere, and nibil
amplius praeter eum caeteros Episcopos agere, secundum antiquam a patribus
nostris regulam constitutam, nisi ea tantum, quae ad suam Dioecesim pertinent,
etc. It behooves the Bishops in every country to know their Metropolitan
Bishop to have care over the whole province, and therefore all such as have any
business must come to their Metropolitan City: wherefore it pleases this
Council, that he also excel in honor, and that the other Bishops do nothing
without him, according to the ancient rule prescribed by our forefathers, but
those things only which perteyne to his own diocese, etc. This Council
was about the year of our Lord. 345.

T. C. Page 99. Sect. 4. 5.
In the. 116. page, for the authority of the Archbishop, is alleged the. 9.
Canon of the council of Antioche, which I have before alleged to prove how
far different the authority of the Metropolitan in those times, was from
that which is now. For there the Counsel shows that every Bishop in his
diocese has the ordering of all the matters within the circuit thereof, and
therefore the meaning of the Council to be, that if there be any affairs that
touch the whole Church in any land, that the Bishops should do nothing without
making the Metropolitan privy, as also the Metropolitan might do nothing
without making the other Bishops a Counsel of that, which he attempted, which
M. Doctor does clean leave out.

And if this authority which the Council gives to the Metropolitan being
nothing so excessive, as the authority of our Metropolitanes now, had not been
over much, or had been justifiable, what needed men father this Canon (which
was ordained in this Council) of the Apostles, for the seeking falsely of the
name of the Apostles, to give credit unto this Canon, does carry with it a
note of evil and of shame, which they would have covered as it were with the
garment of the Apostles authority.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no Canon that makes more directly against you than this does, all
the shifts that you have to avoid it, I have answered before. There is as
great authority given to the Metropolitan in that Canon, as now he either
uses or requires. For every Bishop observing the laws of the realm, and of
the Church, has the ordering of al matters within his diocese: and the
Metropolitan in this Church may attempt no new thing, or any matter of great
importance, not already by law established, though he have the consent of all
the Bishops, so far is he from having authority to do any such thing without
their consent.

That Canon of the Apostles is repeated and confirmed in this Council, as
diverse Canons of the Council of Nice are in like manner repeated and confirmed
by diverse Councels following. This is so far from discrediting that Canon
with wise men, that it rather adds great authority unto it: but you keep
your old wont, in discrediting the authority, which you cannot answer.

Chap. 6. the. 6. Division.
Admonition.
Now then, if you will restore the Church to his ancient officers, this you
must do. In stead of an Archbishop, or Lord bishop, you must make 2. Cor. 1^.
7. Colos. 1. 1.
equality of ministers.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 123.
I have proved before that as well the name as office of an Archbishop is both
most ancient, and also most necessary in the Church of Christ: and that this
equality of ministers, which you require, is both flatly against the
scriptures, and al ancient authority of councels and learned men, and the
example of all Churches, even from Christ's time, as more plainly appears by
these words of M. Bucer in his book De ^egno Christi. Iam ex perpetua
Ecclesiarum obseruatione, ab ipsis iam Apostolis videmus, visum ^ucer.
and hoc esse spiritui sancto, vt inter Presbyteros, quibus Ecclesiarum
procuratio potissimum est commissa, vnus Ecclesiarum, and totius sacri
ministerij curam gerat singularem: eaque cura and solicitudine cunctis praeeat
alijs. Qua de causa Episcopi nomen huiusmodi summis Ecclesiarum curatoribus est
peculiariter attributum. etc. Now we see by the perpetual observation of
the Churches, even from the Apostles themselves, that it has pleased the holy
ghost, that amongst the ministers to whom the government of the Church
especially is committed, one should have the chief care both of the Churches,
and of the whole ministry, and that he should go before all other in that
care and diligence, for the which cause the name of a Bishop is peculiarly
given to such chief governors of Churches, etc. Furthermore I have declared
that it engenders schisms, factions, and contentions in the Church, and
brings in a mere confusion, and is a branche of Anabaptisme.

T. C. Page 99. Sect. 6. 7.
and in the (...) twenty and three page, to that which M. Bucer says, yt in
the Churches there has been one, which has been (...) over the rest of the
Ministers, if he mean one chief in every particular Church, (...) one chief
over the Ministers of diverse Churches meeting at one Synod, and (...) for the
(...), and for such respects as I have before showed, then I am of that mind
which he is: and if he mean any other chief, or after any other sort, I
deny that any such chiefe^ was from the Apostles times, or that any such (...)
pleases the holy Ghost, whereof I have before showed the (...).

And whereas M. Bucer seenieth to allow, that the name of a Bishop, which the
holy Ghost^ expressly gives to all the Ministers of the word indifferently,
was appropriated to certain chief governors of the Church, I have before
showed by diverse reasons, how that was not done without great presumption and
manifest danger, and in the end great hurt to the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Bucers words are plain, there is no cause why you should make such (I^s)
but only that you may be thought able to say some thing, how contrary to
truth and reason soever it be. Your own bare denial of M. Bucers judgment,
will weigh little with any wise or learned man, considering what difference
there is betwixt your knowledge and his: the trial that has been of him, and
the trial that has been of you: his experience, and yours. But what should I
compare together things so unlike? That M. Bucer is directly against you in
this assertion of yours, it does not appear only in these words of his, but
in others also, which he speaks to the like effect, as in the. 4. to the Ephesians.
as I have before declared. And again upon the same chapter Bucer. ^n. 4. Ephe.
he says, The third part of discipline is obedience, which is first to be
rendered of al to the Bishop and Minister, then of every clearke, to those that
be in degree above him, and to such as may help him to the well executing of
his ministry. Last of all of Bishops to synodes, and to their Metropolitan
Bishops, and to all other, to whom a more ample charge of the churches is
committed. And in the same commentaries after that he has proved by sundry
examples and apt reasons, yt this superiority among Ecclesiastical persons is
convenient and profitable, and showed that these degrees in the Church, Bishop,
Archbishop, Metropolitan, Primate, Patria^ke, be not only most ancient, but
also necessary, he concludes on this sort. Because it is necessary that
every one of the clergy should Idem.
have their rulers and governors, the authority, power, vigilancie, and
severity of Bishops, Archdeacons, and all other, by what name soever they be
called (to whom any portion of keeping and gouernin^ the clergy is committed)
should or ought to be restored, least there be any in this order out of rule,
and without government. How think you now of M. Bucers judgment? Is it not
directly against you? be not his words plain?

these be the words of the Apostle. Look ye on things after the appearance? If
any trust in him felfe that he is Christ's, let him consider this again of
himself, that as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. How conclude you
of these words your equality? I promise you it passes my cunning to wring
out of them any such sense: rather the contrary may be gathered out of the
words following, which be these: For though I should boast somevvhat more of
our authority, which the Lord. etc. I should have no shame. M. Calvin
expounding Calvin.
these words says on this sort, It was for modesty that he joined him self
to their number, whom he did far excel: and yet he would not be so
modest, but that he would keep his authority safe: therefore he adds that
he spoke less than of right he might have done. For he was not of the common
sort of ministers, but one of the chief among the Apostles* and Degrees of
honor in the ministry.
therefore he says, if I boaste more, I need not be ashamed, for I have good
cause. And a little after: Quamuis enim commune sit omnibus verbi ministris
idemque officium, sunt tamen bonoris gradus: Although the selfsame office be
common to all the Ministers of the word, yet there is degrees of honor.

Thus you see Calvin far otherwise to gather of this place than you do.

T. C. Page 100. Sect. 1.
And if M. Doctor delight thus to oppose men's authority to the authority of
the holy ghost, and to the reasons which are grounded out of the scripture,
M. Calvin does openly mislike of the making of that name proper and peculiar
to certain, which the holy ghost makes common to mo. And where as of M.
Caluines words, which says that there be degrees of honor in the
ministry, Here he defends not the admonition, but shifteth it or by
^auilling.
M. Doctor would gather an Archbishop, if he had understood that an Apostle
is above an Euange^ste, an Euangeliste above a Pastor, a Pastor above a Doctor,
and he above an Elder that rules only, he neded never have gone to the
popish Hierarchy to seek his diuersiti^s of degrees* which he might have
found in S. Paul. And whereas upon M. Caluines words, which says that Paul
was one of the chief amongst the Apostles, he would seem to conclude an
Archbishop amongst the bishops, he should have remembered that S. Paul's
chiefetie amongst the Apostles, consisted not in having any authoriti^ or
dominion over the rest, but in laboring and suffering more than the rest, and
in gifts more excellent than the rest.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do not oppose men's authority to ye authority of ye holy ghost, and to the
reasons, which are grounded out of the scripture, but I oppose them to your
authority, and to your reasons, who spurn against that order, which the
holy ghost has placed in the Church, and most shamefully abuse the
scripture to maintain your errors: an example whereof is this present text
alleged by the Admonition. which you pass over in silence, condemning thereby
their lewdness in abusing the same. It is you and yours that abuse the name
and authority of the holy ghost: it is you that wring and wreste the
Scriptures vntollerably: it is you that falsify authorities of learned men,
and corruptly allege them: It is you I say, that deprave and discredit such
writers as have been, and be notable instruments in the church of Christ,
and all this you do to maintain your erroneous opinions and false doctrine,
wherewith you endeavor to subuerte this church of England.

M. Caluines words be plain, and they directly overthrow your equality of
ministers, and show the fondnes of the Admonition in alleging that place of
scripture to prove any such equality. M. Caluines words be these: Qu^muis
commune sit omnibu^ verbi ministris, idemque officium, sunt tamen bonoris
gradus: Although the self same office be common to all the ministers of the
word, yet there are degrees of honor. Which words disprove the equality of
ministers by the admonition affirmed, and confirmed with this portion of
scripture by M. Calvin here interpreted, that is. 2. Cor. 10. verse. 7.

If there were degrees of honor in the Apostles time among those which had
idem (...), the self same office, as M. Calvin affirms, why should there
not be so now T. C. contra^ie to himself
likewise? But will you see how unlike you are unto your self, even in these
few lines? first you say that M. Caluines meaning is that an Apostle is above
an Euangeliste, an Evangelist is above a Pastor. etc. and by and by after you
confess that there was chieftie even among the Apostles, but it consisted in
laboring and suffering more than the rest, and in gifts more excellent than
the rest.

To omit these contrarieties of yours, into the which the plainness of
Master Caluin^s words has driven you: this inequality that you confess to
have been in these offices (which notwithstanding you speak of your own head
without any warrant of Gods word) argues that there may be superiority
among the ministers of the Church. And the degrees of honor that you
acknowledge to have been among the Apostles, quite cast^th down your confused
^qualitie. As for your saluing the matter in saying, that this chiefetie among
the Apostles consisted not in having any superiority above the rest, but in
laboring. etc. it may please unskillful persons, but it will not satisfy men
of discr^tion and wisdom. For it is to be thought that every one of ye
Apostles labored in their calling to the uttermost of their powers, that they
suffered whatsoever God laid upon them, that they had all gifts most
abundantly necessary for their functions. Wherefore in all these things there
was summa aequalitas, and no m^n sought such pre-eminence, or received it being
offered unto him, but according to their own doctrine every one thought of
another better than of (...). Wherefore it could not be for this respect, but it
was for order and pollici^ to a^oyde confusion.

I have told you before why you labor so much to have honor and dignity
distributed according to the excellency of gifts, for then you persuade your
self, that the chiefetie would light on your own neck, but you may
peradventure be deceived.

And now I add, that you desire this equality, not because you Why ye
Admonitors desire equality.
would not rule (for it is manifest that you seek it most ambitiously in your
manner) but because you contemn and disdain to be ruled, and to be in
subjection. In deed your meaning is (as I said before) to rule and not to be
ruled, to do what you list in your several cures, without controlement of
Prince, Bishop, or any other. And therefore pretending equality, most
disorderly you seek dominion. I speak that I know by experience in some of
you.

Now whereas he says that we desire to pull the rule from others, that the
rule might be in our hands, and we might do what we list, and that we seek
to withdraw our selves from controlement of Prince and Bishop; and all: first
he may learn, if he will, that we desire no o^r authority, than that which
is to the edifying of the Church, and which is grounded of the wo^e of God:
which if any Minister shall abuse to his (...) or ambition, then he ought to
abide not ^ely the controlment of ye other Ministers, yea of the brethren, but
also further the punishment of the Magistrates according to the quantity of
the fault.

And seeing you charge the brethren so sore, you must be put in remembrance,
that this unreasonable authority over the rest of the ministers and clergy,
An vntruth^* for the lawful authority o^ Bishops and Archbyshops was long
before.
came to the Bishops and Archbyshops, when as the Pope did exempte his
^hauelings from the obedience, subiec^on, and jurisdiction of Princes. Now
therefore that we be ready to give that subjection unto the prince, and offer
our selves to the princes correction in things wherein we shall do amiss, do
you think it an unreasonable thing that we desire to be disburdened of the
Bishops and Archbishops yoke, which the Pope has laid upon our necks?

Io. Whitgifte.
Your answer makes the matter more suspicious: for this authority you speak
of Excessive authority is sought under pretense of equality,
which you say* is to the edifying of the Church, and grounded of the word of
God, is as it pleases you to interpret it. For what so ever you fancy, and
whatsoever authority you usurp, shall have the same pretense: and if the
Prince seek to restrain you, or to break your will, you and your Seniors
will excommunicate her if she be of your parish. Fu^thermore the greatest
preeminence she can have, is to be one of your seigniorie, and then must M.
Pastor be the chief, and so in authority above ye Prince and consequently a
Pope, but of this more in due place shall be spoken.

This authority, which the Bishops and Archbishops now exercise, came first
from (...) authority of Bishops and Archbishops came not from the (...).
the Apostolical Church, then from the example of the primitive Church for ye
space of five hundred years after the Apostles time. Thirdly, from the
Councels of Nyce, Antioche, Constantinople, and all the best and purest
Councels that ever were. And last of all from the authority of the Prince, and
by the consent of this whole Church and Realm of England, and therefore not
from the Pope, who has rather diminished it (by taking all to himself) than
in any respect increased it. Wherefore you also in exempting your self, from the
authority and jurisdiction of the Archbishop and Bishop, resist God in his
Ministers, the Prince in her officers, and the laws of the Church and Realm
in their executors. And as for your protested obedience, it is so enwrapped
with conditions and prouisoes (as in other places of your book more plainly
appears) that when it should come to the trial (if your platform were
builded) it would prove as little, as ^uer the Popish Bishops was, in their
greatest pride.

The place in the first to the Coloss. verse. 1. is this, Paul an Apostle of
Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother. Surely your mind
was not of equality (I think) when you quoted these places to prove it. But
it is your usual manner without al discretion and judgment to dally and play
with the scriptures. For what sequel is there in this reason, Paul calls
Timothy brother, Ergo in all respects there must be equality? As though
there were not distinction of degrees even among brethren.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 208. Sect. 1.
Both of the names, and also of the offices of Archbyshops, Archdeacons,
Scriptures wreasted.
Lord Bishops. etc. I have spoken before sufficiently, and fully answered
those places quoted in this margent, saving the. 2. to the Galat. the. 5. to
the Hebrews. Ezech. 34. 2. Cor. 1. for these places have been found out since,
and thought meet now to be alleged, but how discretely, by examination it
will appear. The words of the Apostle to the Galat. 2. verse. 6. be these. And
of them which seemed to be great I was not taught (what they were in time
passed, it makes no matter to me, God accepts no man's person) nevertheless
they that are the chief, did communicate nothing with me. The Apostle in
these words does declare, that he received not the Gospel, which he preached,
of men, no not of the Apostles, but of Jesus Christ, and that the Gospel
preached by him ought to be no less credited, than the Gospel preached by
them. So that in those words he declares that the truth of the doctrine
does not depend of any man's person. He speaks nothing against superiority
quoad ordinem, conc^rning order, but does rather acknowledge it, for he says,
they that are the chief, etc. But it is true that Master Calvin notes on
this place. Hic non est certamen ambitionis, quia nequaquam de personis agitur.
The contention is not for ambition, for it is not understood of the persons.
Now I pray you consider this argument, Paul received the Gospel that he
preached, not of the Apostles, but of Christ: or the Gospel preached by Paul,
is equivalent with the Gospel preached by other of the Apostles: therefore the
names of Archbyshops, Archdeacons, etc. are drawn out of the Popes shop
together with their offices, or this. Paul says that they that were the
chief did communicate nothing with him: Ergo, the names and offices of
Archbyshops be taken out of the Popes shop.

T. C. Page 100. Sect. 4.
And in the. 207. page unto the midst of the. 214. page this matter is again
handled, where first M. Doctor would draw the place of Galatians the
second; This is an untruth, for it is only proved that the place is not
against the Archbishop. etc
to prove an Archbishop and that by a Here you rashely accuse the translation
of the Bible printed at Geneua, and others:
false translation, for (...), which is they that seemed, or appeared, he has
translated they that are the chief, and although the place of the Galatians
may be thought of some not so pregnant, nor so full against the Archbishop,
yet all must needs confess, that it makes more against him, than for him.
For Saint Paul's purpose is to prove there, that he was not inferior to any of
the Apostles, and brings one argument thereof, that he had not his Gospel
from them, but from Christ immediately, and therefore if the Apostles that
were esteemed most of, and supposed by the Galatians and others to be the
chief, had no superiority over S. Paul, but were equal with him, it
follows that there was none that had rule over the rest. And if there needed
no one of the Apostles to be ruler over the rest, there seems to be no need
that one Bishop should rule over the rest.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have set down the words of the Apostle as they be translated in the English
Bible printed at Geneua, not altering one title, and therefore if there be any
falsehood in the translation, it is in that Bible not in me. How truly you
have translated (...), (...) translated. Beza.

note. I did very carefully search (says he) what that should be that he said (

adds, Qui videba^tur esse colunmae, they which were accounted to be pillars.
Hitherto Hierom: whereby he does evidently declare, that he had not read in this
place (...): But in such sort notwithstanding, that he seems not to have

those, who are of great estimation with all men. And this ignorance of the
Greek tongue, as I think, was the cause that the old interpreter (being more
bolder than Hierom) did add, aliquid esse. And Erasmus in his annotations

upon the same place agrees with M. Beza herein (...) absolut^ dicuntur
Graecis, qui magnae sunt aut^oritatis: they which are of great authority, are
of the Grecians absolutely called (...). Budeus also says, that the Apostle in
this place takes this word Bude^s.
(...), for (...). And both M. Beza himself and Erasmus translate it, as it is
in the Geneua Bible. Wherefore here your cunning fails you, and you had not
well considered the matter before you entered this accusation of falsifying.

The true sense and meaning of this place to the Galat. I have set down in my
Answer: and it is according to the interpretation of the best writers,
justified by the words of M. Calvin there alleged, and not confuted by you.
Wherefore the conclusion remains as it did.

That there was superiority among the Apostles, ordinis and politiae causa, I
have showed before.

This place to the Galatians is not brought in by me to prove the authority of
the Archbishop (although it might well be alleged to prove degrees of honor
in the ministry) but it is quoted in the Admonition fondly and foolishely, to
prove that the names of Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lordbishops. etc. are drawn
out of the Popes shop together with their offices. And of this dalying with
the Scriptures, you speak not one word, for you care not how they be
profaned, so it be for the maintenance of your own cause.

to any function, except he be there unto called by God. But what makes this
against any lawful function or authority? or what conclusion call you this?
Christ did not take unto him that office, whereunto he was not called, or no man
must take upon him that, whereunto he is not called: Ergo Archbishops. etc. and
their offices came out of the Popes shop. you should first prove that which

But that I run not back to that I have handled before, I will not here so

as I will not do also yt of the Hebrews which follows, and yet the argument
is stronger than that M. Doctor could answer. For if the writer to the Hebrews
do prove our Savior Christ's vocation to be just and lawful, Untrue.
because his calling was contained in the scriptures, as appears in ye 5.
and. 6. verse, then it follows, that ye calling of the Archbishop, which is
not comprehended there, is neither just nor lawful. For that no man (says the
Apostle) takes the honor unto himself, but he that is called of God. etc. But
I say, having before sufficiently spoken of the reasons, which overthrow the
Archbishop, I will let pass these and other places, answering only that which
M. Doctor brings for the establishment of them.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a cleanly and handsome shift to avoid ye defense of these gross and
unapt allegations The (...) proves not yt which is deuyed.
of scriptures. I have answered the argument grounded upon the. 5. to ye
Hebrews, and required the proof of the minor, which is this, that
Archbishops, Lordbishops. etc. intrude them selfs into their offices without
any lawful calling, which both they and you have omitted: and therefore I
have answered sufficiently, until you have proved that which is by me denied.

It is not true, that the Apostle to the Hebrews proves the vocation of our
savior Jesus Christ to be just and lawful, because his calling was contained
in the scriptures: he only shows by evident testimonies of the Scriptures,
that Christ did not intrude him self, but was called of God. And if you will
have no man to execute any function in the Church, but him that has such
special and personal testimonies of the scriptures to show for him self, I
see not how any man can justify his calling. It is therefore sufficient if
his calling be generally contained in the Scripture, as al lawful and ordinary
functions are, even the offices of Archebishops, and Lordebishops, etc.

Therefore Archbishops. etc. and their offices come out of the Popes shop.
These fellows neither care for mayor, minor, nor conclusion, so they say
something, and vaynely paynt their margent, with shamefully abusing the

The words of Ezech. Chap. 34. verse. 4. be these. The vveake have ye not

Kings and Magistrates, as it does Archbishops: although in deed it condemns
no office or superiority, but the abuse of the same, that is, the man abusing
the office, and not the office it self.

In the. 2. Cor. 1. verse. 24. the Apostle speaks thus unto them: Not that
we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy, for by
faith you stand. S. Paul here says, that he has no authority to alter
true religion, or to rule over their consciences, but how proves this, that
Archbishops. etc. came out of the Popes shop? Paul says that he had no
power over the consciences of the Corinthians, therefore Archbishops. etc and
their offices were drawn out of the Popes shop. If you had been more studious
when you were a Sophister (if ever you were any) you would have learned better
to frame an argument, and have had better judgment in the sequel of the same.
If you had not troubled your margent with these quotations, you had less

Admonition.
And as safely may we by the warrant of Gods word subscribe to allow the
dominion of the pope, universally to reygne over the Church of God, as of an
archbishop over a whole province, or a Lord bishop over a Dioces, which
conteyneth many shires and parishes. For the dominion that they exercise, the
Archbishop above them, and they above the rest of their brethren, is
unlawful, and expressly forbidden by the word of God.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 210. Sect. 2.
In that you say, that you may as safely by the warrante of Gods word
subscribe to allow the dominion of the Pope universally to reygne over the
Church of God, as of an Archbishop over an whole Province. etc. You express
but your heat, I suppose you think not so: can the Pope as well govern the
whole Church, as the Archbishop one Province, and a Lord bishop one Dioces? Is
one king as well able to govern the whole world, as he may be to govern one
kingdom? Or because you can rule one parish well, can you therefore in like
manner well govern twenty parishes? Surely an Archbishop may well govern one
Province, An archebyshop may govern one pro uince, but the Pope not all the
world.
but the Pope can never well govern the whole Church. And yet an Archbishop
has not the charge of government over the whole Province generally, but only
in cases exempted, and therefore may do it more easily.

T. C. Page 100. Sect. 4.
He says therefore afterward that although one man be not able to be Bishop
over all the Church, yet he may be Bishop over a whole Dioces, or of a
province. Now if I would say the one is as impossible as the other, and for
proof thereof allege that which the philosophers say, that as there are no
degrees in that which is infinite, so that of things which are infinite, one
thing can not be more infinite than another, so there are no degrees in
impossibility, that of things which are impossible, one thing should be more
impossible than another. If I should thus reason, I think I should put you to
some pain. But I will not draw the reader to such thorny and subtle
questions, it is enough for us that the one and the other be impossible,
although one should be more impossible than the other. And that it is
impossible for one man to be Bishop over a whole province, or over a whole
Dioces, I leave it to be considered of that which is before said in the
description of the office of a Bishop, pastor, or minister, where I speak of
the necessity of the residence of the Bishop in his Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
In so saying I say but as other learned men have said, and especially M.
Calvin, in the place afterward alleged in my answer: and as the practice of
the Church has been in the best state, and under the best Bishops, as it may
appear by that which has been hitherto spoken. Your Philosophical argument
is sone answered without any great pain. For to govern one Province in that
manner and form that is required of an Archbishop, is neither infinite, nor
impossible. But it is great lack of judgment to think that because one man
can not well govern the whole world, therefore he can not well govern a
province or dioces. I have showed the practice of the Church to be contrary
in the Apostles time, and since their time.

As a Prince may rule a whole Realm, such as France or England, This is

so may he rule the whole world by officers and Magistrates appointed
underneath him. And there have been diu^rs Princes, which have had as many
lands under their power, as the Pope has had Churches, and although it be
somewhat inconvenient, yet I know not why they might not so have, coming
lawfully by them. Now I would gladly hear, whether you would say the same of
a Bishop, and if you dare not, then why do you bring the similitude of the
government of a prince over a land, to prove that a^ Archbishop may be over an
whole province? M. Doctor dare boldly say, that there may be one Bishop over a
whole province, but he dare not say that there may be a bishop over the whole
Church. But what better warrant for the one than for the other? Again If the
sky fall. etc.
if the whole Church be in one province, or in one realm, which has been,
and is Yes surely, as the state is now.
not impossible to be again, if there may be now one bishop over a realm or
province: then there may be one bishop over all the Church, so that in
traveling with an Archbishop, he has brought forth a Pope.

Io. Whitgifte.
The self same reason you had before, and I answer it now as I did then. The
Supra, cap. 3. diuis. 31. 32. 33.
causes by me there alleged be sufficient to prove the difference betwixt the
government of a Prince, and the government of a Bishop. And yet no man will
deny but that one Prince shall better be able to govern one kingdom, than
the whole world. And to affirm that the whole world may be contained in one
Monarchy, learned men say is multis modis absurdissimum, In diverse respects
most absurd. I bring the Call. Inst. cap. 8. Sect. 92.
example of a King, because other writers use the like examples in the like
matter to confute such unlikely reasons, and namely M. Calvin in the words
following.

That which M. Doctor affirms of one bishop over one whole province, and of
one Bishop over the whole world, no man will deny. A warrant for the one are
the examples of Timothy and Titus, and the continual practice of the Church
without contradiction in the best times: but there is no warrant for the other
of any credit or sufficience, being only in the most corrupt time of the
Church, and contrary to all former examples and Canons.

You say, if the whole Church be in one province. etc. I say, that if the sky
fall you may catch larkes, as the common prruerbe is. Moreover, if it were
possible so to be (as now it is not) then it were no absurdity the Bishop of
that Province still to remain Bishop of the same. But what moves you to such
strange suppositions? The replyers (if) turned upon him self.
I might as well say, if the whole Church were in one City, or Town, or
Parish, as it was in Jerusalem after Christ's ascension, and one Bishop or
Pastor might be over that city, or town, or parish, then one Bishop or
Pastor should be over the The Church cannot be shut up in one province now.
whole Church: and so you likewise in traveling with a pastor to be in one
Church, at the length bring forth a Pope. But do you not know that the
Church of Christ is dispersed throughout the whole world, and can not now be
shut up in one kingdom? much less in one province, except you will become
Donatistes. He that is not wilfully blind may see into what streights you are
driven, when you are constreyned to utter such impossibilities for reasons.

T. C. Page 101. Sect. 2.
But he says that an Archbishop has not the charge of government over the
whole pro^ince generally, but in cases exempted, and so may do it more easily.
But he should have remembered, that he assigned before the offices of
Archbishop and bishop, to be in all those things which other ministers are,
and that beside those offices, he gives them particular charges. So that where
the office of the minister, is but to preach, pray, and minister the
sacraments in his parish, the office of archbishop and bishop, is to do the
same, and more too in the whole province or dioces: And so it follows that it
is easier for a minister to discharge his duty in his parish, than for an
archebyshop or bishop to discharge their duties in any one parish of their
province or dioces: for they have in every parish more to do, and greater
charge, than the minister of the parish has, then much^ less are they able
to do their duties in all the parishes of their provinces or dioces.

Io. Whitgifte.
I speak of the office of government, and so be my words. Every particular
parish has a particular pastor to preach, pray, and mynister the sacraments.
The Bishop has to procure (so much as lies in him) that all things be done in
his Dioces, according to the laws and orders of the Church. The Archbishop
has not only to see that ye Bishops do their duties, but to help the^ in
reforming that, which by themselves they cannot do. The office of preaching
they exercise, where and when they see it most convenient. The whole charge of
preaching and of governing rests neither upon the Archbishop, neither upon
the Bish^p: but the one is a help unto the other, and they together with the
pastors teach the flock of Christ faithfully and truly, and govern them
according to the laws prescribed And therefore the whole government of the
province does not rest in the Archbishop, for the which cause he may with
less difficulty execute that, that does apperteyne unto him.

Whatsoever any other minister may do, the same may ye Archbishop do also, but
it does not therefore follow, that he is bound to ye same particular parish. The
pastor may preach, so may the Archbishop, but the pastors charge is particular,
the Archbishops more general. And this is a very evil consequent, the
Archbishop may minister the sacraments, and preach the word, therefore he
must do it in every particular congregation.

You borrowed these arguments from the very Papists, who by Arguments
borrowed of the papists.
the self same reasons go about to prove the Popes supremacy, for thus they
argue

Among the Israclites there was one high Priest, which had authority over the
rest, therefore there must be one high Priest (which is the Pope) over the
whole Church of Christ. Master Calvin in his Institutions, chap. 8. does
answer this reason on this sort: Calvin.
Quod in vna natione fuit vtile, id in vniuersum (...) ext^dere nulla ratio
cogit: imo gentis vnius and totius orbis long diuersa erit ratio. That which
is profitable to one nation, can not by any reason be extended to the whole
world, for there is great difference betwixt the whole world and one
nation. And a little after: Perinde enim est acsi quis contendat, totum mundum
a praefecto vno debere regi, quia ager vnus non plures praefectos habeat: It is
even as though a man should affirm, that the whole world may be governed
of one King, because one field or town has but one ruler or master.

T. C. Page 101. Sect. 3. and Page 102. Sect. 1.
After M. Doctor translateth out of M. Calvin the Papists reasons for the
supremacy of the Pope, and M. Caluines solutions. For what purpose he knows,
I can not tell, unless it be to blotte paper, I know not what he should mean,
and the quarrel also which ^e is not pieked, but offered
he picketh, to translate this place, is yet more strange. For he says, that
the authors of the Admonition borrowed their arguments from the Papists, when
the contrary is true, that they use the reasons which they of the Gospel use
against the supremacy of the pope, to overthrow the archbishop: And M.
Doctor does use reasons to defend the archbishop, Being truly alleged.
which the Papists use to maynteyne ye pope In ali^aging them falsely.
. For M. Doctor would prove V^true, for he never used that for a rea^o^.
that for because there is one king over a realm, therefore there may be one
Bishop over a province, and the Papists use the same reason to prove the Pope
to be a Bishop of the whole Church. Show now one reason that the authors of the
Admonition brought of the papists, to prove that there should be no
archbishop. But now I perceive his meaning, and that is, that he thought to
get some comfort for the archbishop in M. Caluines solutions made unto the
papists reasons for the supremacy. And therefore he has haled and pulled in
as it were by the shoulders, this disputation between the protestants and the
papists touching the supremacy. And what is it, that M. Calvin says for the
archbishop? It has been before showed, what his judgment was touching having
one minister over all the ministers of a province, and that he does simply
condemn it in his co^mentarie upon the first chapter of the Philip. Now let it
be considered, whether in these sentences he has said any thing against
himself. The Papists object that for so much as there was one high priest
in Jury over all the Church, therefore there should be one Bishop over all. To
whom M. Calvin answers that the reason follows not: for says he, there is
no reason to extend that to all the world, which was profitable in one nation.
Here upon M. Doctor would conclude, that M. Calvin allows one Archbishop
over a whole province.

If one going about to prove that he may have as many wives as he list, would
allege Jacob for an example, which had two wives, and M. Doctor should answer
and say, that although he might have two wives, yet it follows not that he
may have as many as he list, would not M. Doctor think that he had great
injury, if a man should conclude of these words, that his opinion is, that a
man may have two wiaes? I think that he would suppose that he had great wrong,
and yet thus would he conclude of M. Caluines words in this first sentence,
where as in deed M. Calinne declares a little after, a special reason why
there was but one high Priest in the whole land of Iewry, which is because he
was a figure of Christ, and that thereby should be shadowed out his sole
mediation between God and his Church. And therefore (...) for he ^heweth no
such thing.
shows that for so much as there is none to represent or figure our savior
Christ, that his judgment is, that as there should be no one over all the
churches, so should there be no one over any nation.

Io. Whitgifte.
The authors of the Admonition say, that they may as sa^ely by the warrant of
Gods word subscribe to allow the dominion of the Pope, universally to reign
over the Church of God, as of an Archbishop over an whole province, or a Lord
bishop over a dioces, which contains many shires ^ parishes. This I confute
by M. Caluines answer to the arguments of the Papists, wherein it appears
evidently how far from reason this and such like assertions are, that there may
as well be one pope over ye whole Church, as one Bishop over one province or
dioces.

Now therefore you may see if you list, that I have translated these reasons
and solutions out of M. Calvin to some purpose. And although I might have had
the same solutions out of other learned writers, yet I thought it best to use
M. Calvin, as one of whom you have conceived a better opinion.

I may truly say, that the authors of the Admonition, borrowed this of the
Papists, that there may be as well one Pope over ye whole world, as one bishop
over one province or dioces. The reasons for the Archbishop are solutio^s
against the Pope.


The reasons that I use for the defense of the Archbishop, are the solutions of
the arguments used from the Pope: and such solutions as are used by all learned
men that write against the Pope (as the solution of the places of Cyprian
before mentioned, and now these that follow) to the strongest arguments of the
Papists. Wherefore I confess that I use some of the same arguments, but not to
the same end, nor in like manner. For they use them untruly, against reason,
and the true meaning of the Author: I use them truly, according to reason, and
their proper sense. And my using of them to the purpose that I do, is the
direct answer and plain overthrow of all the arguments of the Papists. It is
not therefore good dealing, to make the simple believe that the same arguments
confirm the Pope, that confirm the Archbishop, when as the application of
them to the one, is the quite overthrow of the other.

M. Doctor never went about to prove that because there is one king over a
realine, therefore there may be one Bishop over aprouince: and in uttering these
and such like untruths willingly and wittingly as you do, you declare of what
spirit you are. But M. Doctor has reasoned clean c^ntrarie, that it is no
good argument to say, that because one king may well rule one kingdom,
therefore he may also well rule the whole world, or because one Bishop may be
over one province, therefore one Pope may be over all Christendom. These be
papisticall reasons, these M. Doctor dissolueth and con^uteth: neythrr can you
be ignorant of it, but malice is blind. God forgive you: for your whole drift
is to bring M. Doctor into hatred and contempt, by such lying means, but God
that sees the hearts of al, will one day detect your deep dissembled
hypocrisy, and reveal that lu^pe of arrogancy and ambition, which is now
cloaked with a counterfeit desire of reformation.

I have told you for what purpose I have used these solutions of M. Caluines,
whose opinion also I have showed before concerning those names and offices.
Calvin allows one to rule over the test of ministers,


In the place to the Philippians now again repeated (and yet this Replier can
abide no repetitions in others, though he use almost nothing else him self) M.
Calvin overthrows your equality, for thus he says: Truly I grant, that
(as the manners and conditions of men are) there can no order remain among the
ministers of the word, ^xcept one do rule over the rest. And he adds that he
speaks de singulis corporibus, non de totis prouincijs, multo autem minus de
orb vniuerso: of several bodies, not of whole provinces, much less of the
whole world, meaning, as I suppose, such provinces as be under What is me^te
by a body in Calvin.
diverse governors: for one province in one particular Church, in one kingdom,
under one Prince, is but one body, and therefore M. Calvin says nothing to the
contrary, but that one may praeesse reliquis ministris, rule over the rest of
the ministers in such a province. Undoubtedly he can not mean that in every
several parish or town there should be one, qui praesit reliquis, because
the most parishes and towns, have but one minister, and he that rules must
have some to rule over. If you will say that M. Calvin means of such
ministers as be in cities where there be many, and not of the Country, where
there is in every several town but one: then I answer, that it were against
reason to bring the ministers of the city under the government of one, and to
suffer the ministers of the country to live as they list. The same causes that
require a ruler or governor for the one, requires the same also for ye other,
except you would have uniformity in the city, and confusion in the country.
Wherefore M. Caluines meaning is, as I have said. But you have subtly kept in
his words, both here and before, because you know that they made much more
against your equality, than they do against the Archbishop. It had been
vprighter dealing to have set down his words, but you will neither use that
playnnesse your self, nor allow of it in other men.

M. Calvin uses two answers to that objection of the Papists, the first
whereof is this, that I have reported in my Answer. And surely he would never
have used y^ solution, and caused it to be printed, if he had not allowed it,
and thought well of it. And not he alone, but other of singular religion and
zeal, have used the same, as Hyperius in the place before by me alleged: so
does M. Nowell against Dorman in his first book, Fol. 50. whose words (because
they be wholly to my purpose, and an evident declaration that such testimonies
may lawfully be used for the authority of the Bishops, that are Supra cap. 3.
the. 15. diuis.
unlawfully abused for the authority of the Pope) I have set down before.
Whereby also the Reader may understand how we agree both among onr selves, and
to our selves, which are desirous to keep the peace of the Church, and that
these places now used in the defense of the Archbishops and Bishops authority,
are no otherwise applied by us, than they were before any such controversy
began.

M. Calvin makes no doubt of the matter, but sets it down as an apt
answer, and by him allowed. And therefore your objection of Jacobs two wives
may serve for a jest, but little to the purpose.

It follows not that if a man make two answers to one argument he disaloweth
the one: for they may both be true. Touching M. Caluines second answer: I have
spoken before, and declared wherein that high Priest was a figure of Christ. M.
Calvin in that place has not these words, that his judgment is, that as
there should be no one over all Churches, so should there be no one over any
nation. And therefore you keep your accustomed manner of falsifying.

Chap. 6. the. 17. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 211. Sect. 3.
Another of their reasons is this: Peter was the chief among the Calvin. Inst.
cap. 8.
Apostles, therefore there ought to be one chief over the whole Church. The
same M. Calvin in the book and chapter before rehearsed, makes his own
answer to that argument: Vnus inter Apostolos summus fuit, nempe quia pauci
erant numero. Si vnus duodecim hominibus praefuit, an proptere^ sequetur, vnum
debere centum millibus, hominum praefici? There was one chief among the
Apostles, because they were but fevve in number, but if one man rule over
twelve, shall it therefore follow that one man may rule over an hundredth
thousand? And a little after: Quod inter paucos valet, non protenu^ tr^bendum
est ad vniuersum terraru^ orb^m, ad quem regendum nemo vnus sufficit, That
which is offorce among few, may not by and by be drawn to the whole world,
the which no one man can govern. Every hiue of Bees has one chief master Be,
every company of Cranes has one principal guide, must there be therefore but
one Be, and one Crane to direct all the Bees and the Cranes that be in the
world? You see therefore how weak this reason is. The rest of this reason I
have answered before.

T. C. Page 102. Sect. 1.
To the Papists obiecting for the supremacy ye S. Peter was the prince and
chief of the Apostles M. Calvin answers, first by denying yt Peter was so,
and brings many places to prove yt he was equal to ye other Apostles,
afterward he says, although it be granted, yt Peter was chief, yet follows
it not because one may bear rule over twelve, being but a few in number, that
therefore one may rule over an hundredth thousand, and that it follows not,
that that which is good amongst a few, is forthwith good in ^ll the world,
Now let all men judge, with what conscience and trust, M. Doctor citcth M.
Calnine for to prove the office of the Archbishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin in the same place has these words, It is not to be marvelled
that Call. inst. ca. 8.
the twelve had one amongst them, that might govern the rest. For this thing
does nature allow, and the disposition of man require, that in every society,
though all be equal in power, yet some should be as it were moderator of the
rest, upon who^ the other might depend. There is no court without a Consul, no
session of judges without a Praetor or justice, no College without a governor,
no society without a master: so should it not be any absurdity, if we
should confess, that the Apostles gave such prehemine^ce unto Peter. Now let
the Reader judge whether it be Caluines meaning in good earnest or no, yt there
was one chief among the Apostles: which being true (as it is) M. Doctor may
with good conscience use this answer of M. Calvin both against the Papists,
and the authors of the Admonition also, reasoning not much unlike unto them.

Chap. 6. the. 18. Division.
T. C. Page. 102. Sect. 1.
But I marvel yt he could not also see that which M. Calvin writes in ye next
sentence almost, where he says, yt Christ is only the head of the church, and
that the church does cleave unto another under his (...), but by what means?
According (says he) to ye order and form of policy, which he has
prescribed, but he has prescribed no such form of policy, yt one Bishop
should be over all ye ministers and Churches in a whole dioces, or one
Archbishop over all the ministers and churches in a whole province, therefore
this form of policy which is by Archbishops and such Bishops as we have is not
ye means to knit us one to an other in unity under the dominion of Christ.
Touching ye titles and names of honor which are given to the Ecclesiastical
persons with us, and how that princes and (...) Magistrates may and ought to
have the title which cannot be given to the ministers, I have spoken before,
and therefore of Archbishops, Archdeaco^s, and the Lord bishops thus far.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin in the next section after that he has answered to other arguments
of Call. insti. ca 8.
the Papists says thus: But let it be as they would have it, that it is good
and profitable that the whole world should be contained in one monarchy, which
notwithstanding is most absurd, but let it be so: yet I will not therefore
grant, that it does likewise hold in the government of the church. For the
church has Christ her only head, under whose government we are knit together
acording to that order and form of policy which he himself has prescribed.
Wherefore they do Christ notable (...), which under this pretense will have one
man to rule over the whole church, because she can not want a head, for Christ
is the head, whereby the whole body being compacted and coupled by every joint
of government, does according to the operation in the measure of every member,
iucrease to a perfect body. Al which I agree unto as most true, but nothing
at all perteyniug to your purpose. (...) says, that under the government of
Christ we cleave together among our selves, according to that order and that
form of policy, which he has himself prescribed: And who denies this?
But Quorsum? This he speaks of the spiritual regiment and policy, not of the
external: and yet that external regiment and policy is also (...) by him,
which is profitable for his Church according to time, place, and pers^ns,
though it be not particularly expressed in his word, as partly has bin
declared before, and shall be hereafter more at large upon particular occasion.

Thus have you (after so many years travel in this controversy) uttered all
your skill against the Archbishop, poured out alyour malice, exercised your
gibes and jests, whetted your slanderous tongue: and yet besides corrupt and
false allegati^ns of writers: fond and toyish distinctions of your own,
contrary to al practice and learning: unchristian speeches and heathenish
floutes and frumpes, you have uttered nothing. And I protest unto the whole
Church before God, yt your unfaithfulness in handeling the matter, your vain
and frivolous reasons, have much more animated me to the defense of those
ancient, reverend, profitable, and necessary offices. I speak of the offices
as they be used in this church. And I shall most heartily desire the Reader to
weigh and consider the authorities and reasons on both parties indifferently,
and to judge thereof according to the truth.

A brief collection of such authorities, as are used in this defense of the
authority of Archbishops and Bishops.
Ca. 7.
Timothy was Bishop of Ephesus, and Chrysostom says in. 1. Ti. 5. yt gens
fere tota Testimonies of the Apostles times, and thereunto adjoining.
Asiatica, almost the whole country of Asia was committed to him. And upon
the. 2. to Timo. chap. 4. he says, that Paul had committed to Timothy
gubernacula ecclesiae gentis totiu^ the government over the church of the whole
nation, meaning Asia.

Titus was Bishop of Creta, not of one city only, but of the whole Is^e. So
says Chrysostom in his commentaries upon the first to Titus. And Lyra,
Erasmns, Pelican and others write, that S. Paul made him Archbishop of Creta.
And Illyricus calls him and Timothy, multarum Ecclesiaru^ Episcopos, Bishops
of many churches.

S. John (as Eusebius reports lib. 3. cap. 23.) after his return from
Pathm^s, did govern the Churches in Asia, and ordained Ministers and Bishops.

James was made by the Apostles Bishop of Jerusalem, and the government of that
church was committed to him. Eusebius. lib. 2. cap. 23.

The. 33. or as some count. 34. of the Canons attributed to the Apostles
apointeth one head and chief Bishop to be in every nation or country, to whom
all other Bishops of the same nation must be subject.

Dionysius Areopagita was Archbishop of Athens, appointed thereunto by S. Paul
as Volusianus a godly and learned writer testifies.

Polycarpus was by S. John made Bishop of Smyrna. Tertull. de praescript.

In the Church of Alexandria from the time of S. Mark the ministers had always
a Bishop to govern them. Hiero. ad Euagrium.

Ignatius who lived in the Apostles time does call a Bishop principem
Sacerdotum, the prince of Priests, in epist. ad Smyrnenses.

In Eleutherius ^is time, which was Anno. 180. when this realm of England

Demetrius who lived Anno. 191. was Bishop of Alexandria, and of Egypt. Eusebius.
libr. 6. cap. 1. 191.


Cyprian who was Anno. 235. being Bishop of Carthage, had under him Numidia 235.
and Mauritania, as he himself says, Lib. 4. Epist. 8. And Gregory
Nazianzene in an oration that, he made of Cyprian says, that he ruled and
governed not only the churches of Carthage and Aphrike, but of Spain also,
and of the whole East church. And for this cause does Illyricus call him a
Metropolitan: the which name T. C. also does give unto him in his Reply. Page
95. sect. 2.

Dionysius called Alexandrinus, who lived Anno. 250. being Bishop of
Alexandria 250.
had also under his jurisdiction all the Churches in Pentapolis, as
Athanasius testifyeth in a certainepistle Apol. 2. and yet had these Churches
their proper Bishop, as Eusebius does witness lib. 7. cap. 26. Wherefore the
Bishop of Alexandria did govern them as Archbishop.

Gregory being Bishop, did govern all the Churches through Pontus, An. 270
270.
Eus. lib. 7. cap. 14.

Epiphanius li. 2. to. 2. haeri. 68. makes mention of one Peter, who lived An.
304. whom be calls Archbishop of Alexandria, and declares that Meletius then
Bishop in Egypt 304.
was under him: where also he has these words: Hic enim mos obtinet vt
Alexandriae Episcopus, totius Aegypti, ac Thebaidis, Mariotaeque ac Lybiae,
Ammonicaeque ac Mariotidis, ac Pentapolis ecclesiasticam habeat
administrationem. For this custom has prevailed, that the Bishop of
Alexandria should have the Ecclesiastical government of all Egypt, Thebai^,
Mariota, Lybia, Ammonica, Mariotis, and Pentapolis. And haere. 69. he says,
Quotquot enim ecclesiae in Alexandri^ cat^olicae ecclesiae sunt, sub vno
Archiepiscopo sunt, For all the Churches in Alexandria that be Catholic, are
under one Archbishop.

The same Epiphanius in the same place does call Meletius, Archbishop of Egypt,
304.
but yet he says that he was subject to the Archbishop of Alexandria. And this
Meletius lived also Anno. 304.

The Council of Nice An. 330. in the. 4. Canon says that the confirmation of
Bishops 3^0.
does pertein to the Metropolitan of every province: and in the. 6. mention is
made of Metropolitanes to be in every province, and that sec^ndum antiquum
morem, according to the old custom. And it is further said, that the Bishop
of Alexandria has the regiment of Libya and Pentapolis in Egypt.

In the. 6. and. 37. Canons of the second Council of Arelat. it is decreed
that no Bishop may be ordained without the consent of the Metropolitan: nor
any thing to be attempted 335.
against the great Synod of the Metropolitan.

The Council of Antioch in the. 9. Canon wills yt in every province ye
Bishops be subject to their Metropolitan bishop which has ye care of the
whole province. etc. And in that Canon is this clause also. Secundum antiquam a
patribus nostris regulam constitutam, 344.
according to the ancient rule appointed by our forefathers.

Athanasius was Archbishop of Alexandria, and had jurisdiction over the rest of
the clergy, to whom also Mariotes was subject. Atbana. apo. 2.

Amphilochius Metropolitan of Lycaonia governed y^ whole country. Theod. lib.
4. ca. 11.

Zozomene li. 7. ca. 19. writes that though there be many cities in Scythia,
yet they have but one Bishop.

Aurelius bishop of Carthage in the council of Aphrica says, that he had the
oversight and care of many churches.

Ambrose li. de dig. sacer. ca. 5. makes mention of Archbishops, and he
himself was a Metropolitan, having charge and government of many churches, as
the authors of the Centuries testify in their fourth Centurie.

Simeon was Archbishop of Seleucia Zozo. lib. 2. cap. 8. he lived about the
time of the Nicene Council. Basile Metropolitan of Capadocia. Zozo. lib. 3.
cap. 16.

In the council of Constantinople, which is one of the. 4. general Councels in
the. ^ An. 38^.
and. 5. Canons this authority and regiment of Primates, Metropolitanes and
Archbishops is conteine^. Which thing also Socrates does note in the same
Council lib. 5. cap. 8.

In the. ^. Counce^l of Carthage Canon. 12. etc. it is evident that in every
Province An. 415.
there was a primate.

In the council of Chalcedon, Flauianus is called Archbishop of
Constantinople: Dioscorus An. 453.
Archbishop of Alexandria: Leo Archbishop of Rome, and the authorities of these
offices and degrees there in diverse points specified.

In the first Canon of the council of Ephesus it may manifestly be gathered, yt
all An. 468.
other Bishops of ye same Province were then subject to their Metropolitan
Bishop.

Hierome ad Rusticum Monachu^ says: Singuli ecclesiarum Episcopi, singuli
Archipresbyteri, singuli archidiaconi. etc. I omit his other places ad Lucif.
ad Titum. etc.

Ambrose in 4^ d Ephe. says that all orders be in a Bishop, because he is
primus sacerdos, hoc est princeps sacerdotum, the chief Priest, that is, Prince
of priests.

Augustine in his questions in vetas and nouum test. cap 101. says, Quid est
Episcopus, nisi primus presbyter, hoc est Summus sacerdos?

Chrysostom being Archbishop of Constantinople did also govern the Churches in
Thracia, Asia, and Pontus. Tbeodo. lib. 5. cap. 28 The authors of the Centuries
affirm the same, and call him Archbishop. Cent. 5. cap. 10.

Theodorete being bishop of Cyrus had under his government. 800. Churches, as
he himself t^stifieth in his Epistle to Leo.

Gennadius Bishop of Constantinople writes to the Bishop of Rome thus, Curet
Rufsi. libr. 1. cap. 29.
sanctitas tua vniuersas tuas custodias, tibique subiectos Episcopos.

Infinite testimonies and examples there are of this sort, and no man that is
of any reading can be ignorant but that these degrees of superiority, and this
kind of regiment has bin in the Church continually, even from the Apostles
time.

M. Bucer upon the fourth to the Ephesians. shows that these de^rees in the
church Bishop, Archbishop, Metropolitan, Primate, Patriarch, be not only
most ancient, but also necessary.

M. Calvin in his Instit. cap. 8. Sect. 52. upon the place of Hierome in the
Epistle ad Euagriu says, that in the old time there was to every city
appointed acertain region, Province, or Dioces, Quae presbyteros inde sumeret,
and velut corpori illius ecclesia accenseretur, and that y^ same also was under
the Bishop of the city. Quod si amplior erat ager, qui sub eius episcopatu
erat, quam vt sufficere omnibus episcopi munijs vbique possit: per ipsum agrum
designabantur certis locis presbyteri, qui in minoribus negotijs eius vices
obirent, eos vocabant ^borepiscopos, quod per ipsam prouinciam episcopum
representabant.

M. Beza lib. conf cap. 7 calls the names of Archbishops, Bishops. etc. Holy
names: for thus he says, That Pastors in process of time were distinct into
Metropolitanes, Bishops, and those whom they now call Curates (that is, such
as be appointed to every Parish) was not in the respect of the ministry of
the word, but rather in respect of jurisdiction and discipline. Therefore
concerning the office of preaching the word, and administering the Sacraments,
there is no difference betwixt Archebishops, Bishops, and Curates, for all are
bound to feed their flock with the same bread, and therefore by one common
name in the Scriptures they be called Pastors and Bishops. But what
impudency is there in those men (meaning the Papists) to use those holy
names, and therefore to glory of the succession of the Apostles and true
Bishops. In the same chapter, he makes two kynds of degrees used in the
Papistical Church: the one unknown to the Apostles, and to the primitine
church, the other taken out of the word of God and from the primitive Church:
In this second order he places Archebishops, Curates, Can^ns, Seniors or
Ministers, Archedeacons, Deanes, Subdeacons, Clearkes.

But what should I stand longer in this matter? There is not one writer of
credit yt denies this superiority to have bin always among the clergy, and
these degrees to come even from the best time of the Church since the Apostles,
and so be both most^ ancient and general. Wherefore I can not but count such
as deny so manifest a truth, either unlearned and unskillful persons, or else
very wranglers, and men desirous of contention.

A brief comparison betwixt the Bishops of our time, and the Bishops of the
primitive Church.
Chap. 8
I Know that comparisons be odious, neither would I use them at this time, but
that I am thereunto (as it were) compelled by the uncharitable dealing of T. C.
who by comparing the Bishops of our time with the Bishops in the old Church,
has sought by that means to disgrace them, if it were possible. I may
peradventure in this point see me to some to flatter, but the true judgment
thereof I leave to him, that knows the secrets of the heart. In the mean
time I will affirm nothing, which is not evident to all those that be learned
divines, and not over ruled with affection. My compar^ion shall consist in these
three points: Truth of doctrine, Honesty of lise, and right use of external
things.

Touching the first, that is truth of doctrine, I shall not need much to
labor. For I think T. C. and his adherents will not deny but that the doctrine
taught and professed by our Bishops at this day, is much more perfect and
sounder, than it commonly was in any age after the Apostles time. For the most
part of the auncientest Bishops were deceived with that gross opinion of a
thousand years after the resurrection, wherein Euse. lib. 3. cap. 39. and. 35.
the kingdom of Christ should here remain upon earth: The fautors whereof
were called M^llenarij. Papias who lived in Polycarpus and Ignatius his time,
being Bishop of ^erusalem, was the first author of this error, and almost all
the most ancient fat^ers were infected with the same.

Cyprian and the whole Council of Carthage erred in rebaptisatio^, and Cyprian
himself To. con. 1. Lib. epi. 2. ep. 3.
also was greatly ouerseene in making it a matter so necessary in the
celebration of the Lords Supper, to have water mingled with wine, which was no
doubt at y^ time common to more than to him: but the other opinion which he
confuteth, of vsyng water only, is more absurd, and yet it had at that time
patrones among the Bishops.

How greatly were almost all the Bishops and learned writers of the greek
church, yea and the Latins also for the most part, spotted with doctrines of
freewill, of merits, of invocation of Saints, and such like? Surely you are
not able to reckon in any age since the Apostles time, any company of Bishops,
that taught and held so sound and perfect doctrine in all points, as the
Bishops of England do at this time.

If you speak of Ceremonies, and of the sincere administration of the
sacraments, you shall find the like difference: for compare the cerenionies
that Tertullian sapet^ lib. decoro. mil. then to be used in the Church about
the Sacraments, and otherwise: or those that Basile reherseth Lib. de Sancto
spi. or such as we may read to have bin in S. Augustins time, with those that
we now retain in this Church, and you can not but acknowledge, that therein
we are come to a far greater perfection.

I mean not to stand in particulars, I think T. C. and his companions will
not contend with me in this point, for if they do, it is but to
maynteyncontention. Seeing then that in the truth of doctrine, which is the
chief and principal point, our Bishops be not only comparable with the old
Bishops, but in many degrees to be preferred before them, we think there is
tootoo great injury done unto them, and to this doctrine which they profess,
when as they are so odiously compared, and so contemptuously entreated by T. C.
and his Colleags.

2 Touching honesty of life, which is the second point, I will not say much, I
do not think but that therein they may be compared with the old Bishops also:
and in some points preferred: every age has some imperfectio^s in it, and the
best men are most subject to the slanderous tongue. Great contention there was
among the Bishops in the Council of Nice, insomuch that even in the presence
of the Emperor they ceased not to libell one against an other. What
bitterness and cursing was there betwixt Epiphanius and Chrysostom? what
affectionate dealyng of Theophilus against the same Chrysostom? what iarring
betwixt Hierome and Augustine? But I will not prosecute this. Men, be they never
so godly, yet they be men. and the co^m^n sort of people, when they wax
weary of the word of God truly preached, then do they begin to deprave the
true and chief ministers of the same.

3 For the third point, that is, the use of external things, if the ^ishops
now have more land and living than Bishops had then, it is the blessing of God
upon his church: and it is commodious for the state and time. If any man abuse
himself therein, let him be reformed, let not his fault be made a pretense to
cloak a mind desirous to spoil. I see not how those lands and livings can be
employed to more bene^ite of ye church, commodity of the common wealth, and
honor of the Prince, than they be now in state and condition wherein they
remain. Bishops shall not now need to live by pilling and polling, Amb. de dig.
sacerd. August. lib. 3. aduer. Permenia.
as it seemed they did in Cyprians time, for he complains thereof. Ser. de
lapsis. Nor as some did in Ambrose or Augustins. They have (God be thanked)
living sufficient with out any such unlawful means, and I doubt not but if
their expenses shall be compared with their predecessors, it shall appear that
they be according to the proportion that God has limited unto them. But an
eye dimmed with malice, or bente to the spoil, can see nothing that may hinder
the desired purpose. God root out of the hearts of men such ravening
affections and greedy desires.

C.
Chap. 1. the. 1. Division.
T. C. Page. 102. Sect. 2.
Before I come to speak of prayers, I will treat of the faults that arecomitted
almost throughout the whole Lyturgie, and public Service of the Church of
England, whereof one is that, which is often objected by the authors of the
Admonition, that the form of it is taken from the Church of Antichriste, as
the reading of the Epistles and Gospels so cut and mangled, as the most of
the prayers, the manner of ministering the Sacraments, of marriage, of burial,
Confirmation, translated as it were word for word, saving that the gross
errors and manifest impieties be taken away. For although the forms and
ceremonies which they used were not unlawful, and that they contained nothing
which is not agreeable to the word of God, (which I would they did not) yet
notwithstanding neither the word of God, nor reason, nor the examples of the
eldest Churches, both Jewish and Christian do permit us, to use the same
forms and ceremonies, being neither commanded of God, neither such, as there
may not as good as they, and rather better be established.

Io. Whitgifte.
In these words are contained two false principles, the one is that the form
and manner of prayer used in the Church of England, is taken from the church
of Antichrist: the other, that it is not lawful to use the same forms (of
prayer) and ceremonies, that the Papists did: this latter I have already proved
to be otherwise, in the beginning Tract. 7. cap. 5 diui. 3. 4. etc.
where I spoke of Ceremonies, and intend hereafter to answer such arguments as
shall be used to prove the contrary: the first will appear to be most untrue,
being manifest that such things as we now use in the book of Common prayer
(though some of them have been used in the time of Papistrie) were appointed in
the church by godly and learned men, before the Pope was Antichrist, or the
Church of Rome greatly corrupted, as the reading of the Epistle and gospel,
which is of very long continuance in the Church, even whilst the church of
Rome was as yet, in the principal points Reading of gospels and epistles very
ancient.
of doctrine pure, being also chosen places of scriptures apt for the time, and
most to edifying, which no honest heart and godly disposed person, can
discommende.

For the word of God I have showed before, both by the example of the Apostles
conforming the Gentiles unto the Jews in their ceremonies, and not
contrariwise the Jews to the Gentiles and by that the wisdom of God has
thought it a good way to keep his people from the infection of idolatry and
superstition to sever them from idolaters by outward ceremonies, and therefore
has forbidden them to do things which are in themselves very lawful to be
done.

Io. Whitgifte.
What you have spoken in any place of your book concerning this matter, is
there answered, where it is spoken: but you have not as yet to my remembrance
any where showed yt God ever has forbidden his people to do things in
themselves very lawful to be done, Tract. 7. cap. 5
because the same were used by Idolaters, I have before proved the contrary,
both by the manifest words of the scripture, and by the testimony of Saint
Augustine, and diverse other learned writers.

Now I will add this further, that when as the Lord was careful to sever them
by ceremonies from other nations, yet was he not so careful to sever them from
any, as from the Egyptians amongst whom they lived, and from those nations
which were next neighbors unto them, because from them was the greatest fear
of infection. Therefore by this constant and perpetual wisdom which God
uses to keep his people from idolatry, it follows that the religion of God
should not only in matter and substance, but also as far as may be inform
and fashion differ from that of the idolaters, and especially the Papists which
are round about us, and amongst us. An vnadu^sed (...).
For in deed it were more safe for us to conform our indifferent ceremonies
to the Turks which are ^arre off, than to the papists which are so near.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Egyptians and Idolatrous gentiles neither worshipped, nor preteuded to The
Gentiles and Papists not like in all respects.
worship the God of Israel, and therefore no marvel though in rites, and
ceremonies they were utterly severed from them: but the Papists either worship
or pretend to worship the same God which we do, and therefore there is no such
cause in all points of rites and ceremonies to differ from them. And it is
most untrue that The Jews and the Gentiles in some respect agreed in ceremo^ies
God so severed his people from the Egyptians or other nations near adjoining,
that they had nothing common with them, or no ceremonies like unto theirs: for
they were like in many things touching the external form. The Gentiles had
sacrifices and so had they: The Gentiles in worshipping their Gods used
external pomp of garments, of golden and silver vessels and such like, and so
did they, yea diverse learned men be of this judgment, that God did prescribe
unto the Israelites that solemn manner and form of worshipping him by
external rites and ceremonies, shortly after their return out of Egypt, that
they being therewith not only occupied, but also delighted, should have no
desire to return into Egypt, or to worship their Gods whom they had seen
with great solemnity of ceremonies and external rites adored. And therefore
you ground your talk upon false principles, which you have not proved, but
imagined.

Now if we may have ceremonies common with them, or like unto them, from whom
we wholly differ in matter and substance of religion, as we do from the
Gentiles, and from the Turks, much more may we have Ceremonies common with
them, or like unto them, from whom we do not wholly diff^r in mat^er and
substance, but in certain material and substantial points. As for this your
saying, That it were better for us to conform our indifferent Ceremonies to
the Turks which are far off, than to the Papists which are so near. I take
it to be but spoken in a heat, and that you will otherwise think when you
have better considered the matter: the one being a professed enemy unto
Christ, and the name of Christ, the other pretending the contrary. But to put
you out of doubt, we do not in any kind of ceremonies, conform We conform

our selves to the Papists, but using Christian liberty in external things,
and knowing that al things be clean to those that be clean, such things as we
find instituted by learned and godly men, and profitable to the Church as
perteyni^g to e^ifying, or comeliness and order (though abused of the Papists)
we retain in our Churches, and restore to the right use: as our forefathers
did the Temples of Idols, turning Tract. 7 cap 5 diuis 3. 4. and^
them to Christian Churches, and revenues consecrated to Idols, transposing
them to find the ministers of the Church, and such like, as I have declared in
an other place.

Common reason also does teach, that contraries are cured by their contraries:
now Christianity and Antichristianitie, the Gospel and popery, be
contraries, therefore Antichristianitie must be cured not by it self, but by
that which is (as much as may be) contrary unto it. Therefore a meddled and
mingled estate of the order of the Gospel, and the ceremonies of popery, is
not the best way to banish popery, and therefore as to abolish the infection
of false doctrine of the Papists, it is necessary to establish a diverse
doctrine, and to abolish the tyranny of the popish government, necessary to
plant the discipline of Christ: so to heal the infection that has crepte into
men's minds by reason of the popish order of service, it is meet that the other
order were put in place thereof.

Io. Whitgifte.
Contraries must be cured by contraries in all things wherein they be contrary.

and Antichristianitie: the Gospel and popery be not in all things contrary,
touching outward profession: and therefore no necessity of aba^doning all
things from Christianity that was used in Antichristianitie. So much of the
papistical doctrine as is contrary to the Gospel: that kind of government in
the Popes Church, that is repugnant to the word of God: all such order of
service or kind of prayer, as is ungodly and superstitious, is to be removed
and cured with the contrary, but as they have some truth in doctrine, so have
they some lawful kind of government, and good and godly prayers, all which
being restored to their own purity, are to be retained: for no abuse can so
defile any thing that is good, that the same thing may not be used, the abuse
being taken away.

And yet, if you would speak the truth, you cannot say, but that the order of
the popish The order of popish service clean altered in this church
service is clean altered in this Church: for what similituds has the vulgar
tongue with a tongue unknown? What likelihoode is there betwixt the multitude of
ceremonies used by the Papists, and the fewnes of such as are now retained? How
much does the simplicity used in our service, differ from the pomp and
gorgeousness used in theirs? How contrary is our communion to their Mass?
What diversity is there in the celebration of our sacraments and theirs? To be
short, the difference is as much as either the word of God, or the state and
condition of the Church requires: the which you might see if you were
disposed: but as I have said before, Caeca malitia non videt apertissima: Blind
malice sees not those things that are most manifest.

Philosophy which is nothing else but reason, teaches, that if a man will
draw one from vice which is an extreme, unto virtue which is the mean, that
it is the best way to bring him as far from that vice as may be, and that it
is safer and less harm for him to be led somewhat to far, than he should be
suffered to remain within the borders and confynes of that vice wherewith he
i^ infected. As if a man would bring a dronken man to sobriety, the best and
neatest way is to carry him as far from his excess in drink as may be, and
if a man could not keep a mean, it were better to fault in prescribing less
than he should drink, than to fault in giving him more than he ought, as we
see to bring a stick, which is A crooked rule.
crooked, to be straight, we do not only how it so far until it come to be
straight, but we bend it so far until we make it so crooked of the other
side, as it was before of the first side, to this end that at the last it may
stand straight and as it were in the mid way between both the crokes: which I
do not therefore speak, as though we ought to abolish one evil and hurtful
ceremony for another, but that I would show, how it is more dangerous for us
that have bin plunged in the mire of Popery, to use the ceremonies of it, than
of any other idolatrous and sperstitious service of God.

Io. Whitgifte. The Replyer prescribes a heathenish rule of retormation. Romans

Philosophy also teaches, that both the extremes be vices, and therefore
your rule does teach that a man must go from one vice to another, if he will
come to virtue, which is a mean: but Saint Paul teaches the contrary,
saying, Non est faciendum malum, vt inde veniat bonum. We must not do evil
that good may come thereof. Wherefore as your rule is heathenish and naught, so
do you as naughtily (...) it Is there no way for the prodigal man to come to

The ordinary means whereby a Christian man must come from vice to vert^e,

from an e^treme to a mean, is the diligent reading and hearing o^ the word of
God, joined with earnest and hearty prayers. The best way therefore to bring a
dronken man to sobriety is, not to persuade him to a superstitious kind of
abstinence or fasting, but to lay before him out of the word of God the
horriblenes of that sin, and the punishment due unto the same. The similitude
of a crooked stick is a^t to set forth so crooked a precept, but not so apt to
make manifest the way unto virtue. But I may not blame you for using and
allowing those profane rules, which you so aptly follow, and so commonly
practice in all your doings.

This wisdom of not conforming it self unto the ceremonies of the Idolaters
in things indifferent, has the Church followed in times passed.

Tertullian says, O says he, better is the religion of the heathen, for they
use no solemnity of the Christians* neither the Lords day, neither the
Pentecost, and if they knew them, they would Lib. de Ido latria.
have nothing to do with them, for they would be afraid, least they should
seem Christians, but we are not afraid to be called heathen.

Io. Whitgifte.
Tertullian in that place speaks against such Christians, as celebrated the
feasts of the Gentiles together with them remaining in their wicked abuse, as
it appears in the words that go before, which are as follows. Nobis quibus
sabbata extranea Lib. de Idolatria.
sunt and neomenia, and feriae aliqua^do a Deo dilectae, Saturnalia and
lanuariae and Brumae and Matro^ales frequentantur, munera commeant, strenae
consonant, lusus, conuiuia constrepunt. O melior fides nationum in suam sectam.
etc. The feasts of Saturn, of Ianus, of Bacchus, and of Juno are frequented of
us, unto whom the sabbats, new mones, and holydays sometimes beloved of God,
are strange, gifts and presents are very ri^e, sportes and banquets keep a
stir. O better is the faith of the Gentiles in their sect. etc. Wherefore
this saying of Tertullian may aptly be alleged against those, that frequent
the popish solemnities together with them, come to their Churches, communicate
with them in worshipping their idols, and yet profess the knowledge of the
Gospel, but it can by no means be drawn unto such, as withdrawing themselves
from such kind of communicating with them, do in their several Churches use
those good things well, which the Papists have abused: as the scripture, the
sacraments, prayers and such like. Wherefore you do not well to allege
Tertullians words, omitting the circumstances which declare his meaning.

A man being pr^sent at Idolatrous service must needs give great suspicion
that he is an Idolater, and therefore no man ought to be present at it, which in
heart condemns it. But as there is no honest and godly man, which can call
our service Idolatrous or Papisticall, so is there none that can suspect us to
be Idolaters or Papists. The whole world knowing that both our practice and
profession is to the contrary.

Constantine the Emperor speaking of the keeping of the feast of Easter,
says that it is an unworthy thing to have any thing common with that most
spiteful company of the Jews. And a little after he says, that it is most
absurd and against reason, that the Jews shou^de vaunt and glory, that the
Christians could not keep those things without their doc^rine. And in another
Socrat. ^. li. cap. 9.
place it is said after this sort: It is conuement so to order the matter, that
we have nothing common with that nation.

Io. Whitgifte.
Constantine speaks of the feast of Easter, which he would not have observed
according to the manner of the Jews, and yet you know that the Churches in
Asia, following the examples of Philip and John the Apostles, and of
Polycarpus, and many other godly men, did celebrate that feast together with
the Jews, as it is to be seen in the fifth book o^ Eusebius eccle. history.
Wherefore the matter was not of so great Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 23. 24. and. 25. 26.
importance, before it was for quietness sake determined by the Church:
neither does Constantine in either of the places mean, that we should have
nothing common with the Jews, but only that we should have no such things
common with them, as are repugnant to Christian liberty, or to the truth of
the Gospel, or such as may co^^rme them in their obstinacy and error. For if
his meaning had bin generally and simply, then might he have utterly abrogated
the feast of Easter, being no commandment sor it in the new testament. As
therefore Constantine thought that the Church had not the feast of Easter
common with the Jews, not because the thing it self was abrogated, but the
^ay altered: Even so the Church of England cannot be said to have any thing
common with the P^pisticall Church, though it retain something used in the
same, because the manner is changed, and certain circumstances altered: ^or
whereas before it was in a strange tongue, now it is in a tongue known: and
whereas it was before abused and mixed with superstition, now it is rightly used
and purged from all corruption. And therefore, although the thing remain, yet
because the circumstances be altered, it is not the same, no more than our
Sabbat is the Jews Sabbat, and our Easter the Jews Easter.

The Councels although they did not observe themselves always in making of
decrees this rule, yet have kept this consideration continually in making their
laws, that they would have the Christians differ from others in their
ceremonies.

Council, decreed, Tom. 1. con Lao. can. 38

communicate with their (...).

Also it was decreed in another Council, that they should not deck their

leaves, and green boughs, because the Paganes did use so, and that they
should not rest from their labors those days that the Paganes did, that they
should not keep the first day of every month as they did.

Io. Whitgifte.
What is all this to your purpose? who says that either we must use all
things that the Jews and gentiles did, or that the Church has not authority
to take order therein as shall be thought most convenient? the Church at this
time, did perceive inconveniences in these customs and ceremonies, and
therefore did by ordinaris authority abrogate them. In like manner and upon
like considerations has this Church of England abandoned great numbers of
Papisticall rites and ceremonies, but because it refuses some, may it
therefore retain none? or because it rejects those which be wicked and
unprofitable, may it not therefore keep still such as be godly and perteine
to order and decency?

The Canon of the Council of Laodicea is this. Non (...) a Iudaeis azyma
accipere, Canon. 38.
aut communicare impietatibus eorum. That we ought not to take unleavened bread
of the ^ewes, or communicate with their impiety. And surely, I marvel what
you can conclude of it: for no man (as I suppose) does think that we may use
ceremonies proper to the Jews, and abrogated by Christ, or that it is lawful
to communicate with their impiety.

That Canon which you call. 73. of the Council of Bracar: is not to be found
in any such Council, for there are not so many Canons in any Council so
called: but the Canon that you mean (as I think) is among the Canons
collected out of the Greek Synods by S. Martin, and in number. 74. The words
be these. Let it not be lawful to use wicked observations of the calends, and
to keep the gentiles holy days, nor to deck houses with bays or green
^oughes, for all this is an heathenish observation.

To what purpose do you allege this canon? what does it prove? Christians are
inhibited from observing days and times and other frivolous superstitions,
after the manner of the Gentiles: But what is this to godly prayers, grounded
upon the word of God, or comely and decent orders and ceremonies?

feasts on the birth days of the mar^yrs, because it was the manner of the
heathen: whereby it appears that both of singular Afric. conc. ca. 17.
men, and of Councels in making or abolishing of ceremonies, heed has bin
taken that the Christians should not be like unto the idolaters, no not in
those things which of themselves are most indifferent to be used or not used.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is marvelous to behold your dealing, and to consider how under the
pretense of avoiding (I know not what) in reciting the words of such Authors as
you allege, you delude the Reader with an untrue sense: as it evidently
appears in this cannon of the Council of Afrike, the words whereof be these.
This is also to be desired (of Con. Afric. Can. 27.
the Emperors) that such feasts as contrary to the commandments of God are
kept in many places, which have bin drawn from the error of the Gentiles (so
that now Christians are compelled by the paganes to celebrate them, whereby
another persecution in the time of Christian Emperors seems covertly to be
raised) might be by their commandment forbidden, and the pain laid upon
cities and possessions prohibited: especially seeing they are not afraid to
commit such things in some cities even upon the birth days of blessed martyrs,
and in the holy places. Upon which days also (which is a shame to tell) they
use most wicked dauncings throughout the streates, so that the honor of
matrones, and the chaste shamefastness of many women which come devoutly unto
that holyday, is by their lascivious injuries invaded, in so much that those
religious meetings are almost shunned. In these words the heathenish feasts of
the gentiles which are against the commandment of God, being full of impiety
and uncleanness, are forbidden to be used of Christians in the birth days of
martyrs, or at any other time. How this can be applied to your purpose, I know
not, except that you count all that for fish that co^mes ^o net.

Now let the Reader consider, what weighty reasons you have hitherto used,
against our order of prayer: nay rather how unaptly you have alleged both your
rea sons and authorities. And whereas you seem to insinuate that the things
you have spoken of be most indifferent, that is nothing so, for the most of
those things prohibited by these canons, be things least indifferent, as it
may appear by that which is already spoken of them, and even in the very
canons themselves.

It were not hard to show the same considerations in the several things which
are mentioned o^ in this Admonition, as for example in the ceremonies of

difference as can be (...) between the people of God and others which are not,
I shall not need to show the same in the particulars.

Io. Whitgifte.
If it were not too hard, I doubt not but that you would say something more in
the matter, than you have done. I know not to what purpose you have alleged
Tertul^ian for not sitting after prayer. etc. except your meaning be, that we
shall not kneel in praying, because the Papists did use that gesture. Howbeit
there is no such thing to be found in that book of Tertullian. Wherefore you
are to careless in alleging your Authors, and give to much credit (as it
should seem) to other men's collections. In his book de oratione, He reproves
certain that used to sit after prayer, alleging for their Author Hermas to
whom the book called Pastor is ascribed, he shesheth that no such thing can
be gathered of Hermas his words, and further adds, that this gesture is to be
reproved, not only because idolaters did use it in worshipping their idols,
but also because it is an vnreuerent gesture. His words be these. Eo Tertullian.
apponitur and irreuerentiae crimen. etc. Hereunto is added the fault of
irreverence, that might be understood even of the gentiles themselves, if they
were wise: for it is an vnreuerente thing to sit in the sight, and against the
face of him, whom thou would especially reverence and worship, how much
more is this deed most profane in the sight of the living God, his Angel
being as yet present at this prayer. Truly your general reasons hitherto used,
are neither of sufficient policy ^or might to deface a book, with so great
wisdom, learning and zeal collected and approved. If your particular reasons
be no better, a small confutation will serve.

Furthermore as the wisdom of God has thought it the best way, to keep his
people from infection of idolatry, to make them most unlike the idolaters: so
has the same wisdom of God thought good that to keep his people in the
unity of the truth, there is no better way, than that they should be most like
one to another, and that as much as possibly may be, they should have all the
same ceremonies. And therefore Saint Paul to establish this order in the
Church of Corinth, 1. Cor. 16.
that they should make their gat^erings for the poor upon the first day of
the Sabbath (which is our Sunday) alleges this for a reason, that he had so
ordained in other Churches, so that as children of one father, and scruantes of
one family he will have all the Churches, not only have one diet, in that they
have one word, but also wear (as it were) one liuerie in using the same
ceremonies.

Io. Whitgifte.
You take upon you to tell what the wisdom of God is, without any warrante
of gods word, which is presumption. I told you before, that in outward show and
^orme the Israelites had many things like unto the Gentiles, which cannot be
denied. Unity of Ceremonies is to be wished in all Churches, though it be not
so necessary: for from the beginning there has bin therein great variety: but
s^eing it is a thing so greatly to be desired, why are you an occasion of the
contrary? why do you not submit your self to the Church, that unity in all
things may be observed.

cause the Churches to dissent one with another, but yet it makes much to the
avoiding of dissension, that there be amongst them an unity, not only in
doctrine, but also in ceremonies.

them, and a certain kind of contumacie pricketh them forward. In the mean
time, Sa^han has that which he desires, that the minds of the godly being

from white. Therefore this mischief is first to be avoided, that none

wickedness he delude with the names of godly me^.

M. Gualter also upon these words. 1. Cor. 14. An a vobis ser^o Dei profectus
est? writes Gualter i^ 1. Cor. 14.
thus: Who can think their insolency to be tolerable, that usurp
authority over all Churches, and will have them seruilely to be subject unto
them? Therefore that which Paul here presently faith to the Corinthians, the
selfsame may at this day with better right be spoken to the Romish Clergy,
which will have all men subject to their laws, and say that it is necessary
unto salvation, that all souls should be subject to the Bishop of Rome. These
things may also be applied against those, which compel every man to swear
unto the opinion of their master, as though it were sin never so little to
disagree from those things which he has once uttered. And their ambition also
is no less here reproved, which go about to bring all Churches unto the
form of their order and discipline: and cry out that there is no discipline
where all things are not correspondent to their orders and statutes: but these
men receive a just reward of their arrogancy, when as they which come from
them to other countries, do go beyond all other in sausy malopartnesse,
neither bring they any thing with them from home, but a vain and intolerable
contempt of all good men, neither can they abide that they should be corrected
by ^nye admonition of others etc.

Beware of ambitious morositie, and take heed of a new Popedom. I think no
Church is so bound to the example of an other, but that in external rites
and ceremonies there is free liberty given unto it, to appoint what shall be
for the present state and time most convenient. You may not bind us to
follow any particular Church, neither ought you to consent to any such new

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a strange collection, that the book of Common prayer maynteyneth an
^preaching ministry, because it appoynteth a number of Psalms and other
prayers and chapters to be read, which may occupy the time that is to be
spent in preaching. Would you have prea ching only, and neither reading nor
praying in the public congregation? or do you think that the chapters and
prayers that are read occupy too long time? or are you persuaded that there
comes no profit by rea^ing and praying? If you mean the first, you have the
examples of the Churches in all places, and at all times against you: if you
mean the (...) the time is not so long that is spent in praying and reading,
but that there may be preaching also: the longest time (if there b^ no
Communion) is not more than an hour, and can you spend that hour better than
in praying and hearing the scriptures read? If you mean the third, I shall
have oc^asion to speak more of it hereafter.

But you say it does not so much maynteyne an unpreaching ministry in that

point, as for that it requires nothing necessarily to be done by the
minister, which a child of ten years old can not do as well, and as
lawfully, as that man wherewith the book contenteth it self. It requires of
him (besides plain and distinct reading) the administration of the
Sacraments: and may a child of ten years old do that also? Who sees not,
that you are of purpose set to deface the book, though it be with chyldishe
reasons? Because a child may read the book, does it therefore maynteyne an
unpreaching ministry? you might as well say, that because a child of ten
years old can read the Bible translated into English, therefore the Bible
translated into English maynteyneth an unpreaching ministry. This argument
is a non caus^.

Neither can it be shifted in saying this is done for want of able men to be
ministers, for it may be easily answered, that first the want of sufficient
ministers ought to be no cause for men to break the unchangeable laws of
God, which be, that none may be made minister of the Church, which can not
teach, that none minister the sacraments, which do not preach, for although
it might be granted (which thing I would not deny, no not when there are
inoughe sufficient ministers) that they may appoint some godly grave man, which
can ^oe nothing else but read, to be a reader in the Church, yet that may not
be granted that they may make of one that can do nothing but read, a minister
of the Gospel, or one which may have power to minister the sacraments.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where is that unchangeable law of God, that none may minister the sacraments
Some may minister the sacraments which do no^ preach. C^rysost.
which do not preach? what Scripture or authority have you for it?
Chrysostom Hom. 3. 1. Cor. 1. upon these words: Non enim misit me Christus vt
baptizarem. etc. says thus: He says not, I was forbidden, but I am not sent
to do this, but to do that which was more necessary. Euangelizare enim
perp^ucorum est, baptizare autem cuiuslibe^, modo fungatur sacerdotio: for few
can preach the Gospel, but every man may baptize that i^ a priest.

And Ambrose upon the same words and chapter, says thus: Non omni^ qui
baptizat Ambrose.
idoneus est euangelizare, verba enims^lennia sunt quae dicuntur in Baptismate.
etc. Every one which baptizeth, is not apt to preach the Gospel, for the
words that are spoken in baptism are usual: to conclude, the Apostle Peter
commanded other to baptize Cornelius, neither did he vouchsafe to do it
himself, other ministers being present, etc.

Peter Martyr writing upon the same words of the Apostle, says likewise:
Therefore Peter (...)
the office of baptizing was committed to every one in the Church, but not the
office of preaching. Neither is it to be doubted but the Apostles themselves
would have baptized, if there had lacked other ministers. But seeing there was
many who^ they might win to the Gospel by preaching, they committed them to
other to be baptized.

So says M. Calvin also upon the same words: Few there were to whom the

disciples administered Zuinglius.

does not disallowe that manner, but allows it.

And M. Beza lib conf. cap. 5. says: That it was the office of Pastors and

to dispense the word, and to pray, under the which also we comprehend the
administration of sacraments, and the celebration of marriage, according to the
continual custom of the Church: although deacons in these things oftentimes
supplied the office of pastors. And to prove this he quoteth. 1. Cor. 1. verse.
14. 15. etc. and Ioh. 4. verse. 2.

So do other learned men in like manner: who also bring for their purpose, that
which is written. ^. Tim. 5. Qui been praesunt presbyteri. etc. So that you may
understand that learned men be of this judgment, that some may be admitted to
administer the sacraments, which are not admitted to preach.

I know it to be true, that there may be some appointed to read in the
Church, which be not admitted, either to preach, or to administer the
Sacraments. For so it was in the primitive Church, as it is to be seen in
ancient stories and wr^ters: But because you would have nothing used in the
Church, especially no office appointed without a commandment in the word
of GOD, I pray you tell where you have either commandment or example for
such kind of Readers? I do but demand this that the Reader may
understand what liberty you challenge unto your self of allowing and
disalowing what you list, and when you list, without that warrant of Gods
word, to the which you so straightly hind all other.

Besyd^s that, how can they say that it is for want of sufficient ministers,
when as there be put out of the ministry men that be able to serve God in
that calling, and those put in their rooms, which are not able, when there are
numbers also which are fit to serve, and never sought for, nor once required to
take any ministry upon them? If therefore it were lawful to plead want of
able ministers, for this do^be ministry, which is altogether unlawful, yet
would this plea never be good, until such time as both those were restored
which are put out, and all other sought ^oorth, and called upon which are
fit for that purpose.

such of necessity (if by no means they can be kept in order) must be

neither must you that so well allow of discipline, burden other men with it,

from his ministry but upon just causes, and ministers must be subject to

thereunto, if they be known: but it is you and your company which labor by
all means possible to dehorte men from the ministry, persuading them that
the calling is not ordinary and lawful. And surely your meaning is to make
this Church destitute of ministers, that it may of necessity be driven to
admit your platform and government. But you shall never be able to bring it to
pass: the more you labor the more you are detected. And those wise men that
seek the truth in sincerity of conscience, will epsy your purposes daily
more and more, and be moved to a just mis^iking of them.

The restitution of those that be put out of the ministry, I think is soon
obtained, if they will submit themselves to the order of the Church, which they
ought of duty to do, both the laws of God, and man requiring the same.

Again it can not be said justly, that they have taken these reading
ministers, until such time as better may be gotten, for if the Church could
procure able ministers, and should desire that they might be ordained over
them, they can not obtain that, considering that these reading ministers have
a free hold, and an estate for term of their lives in those Churches, of the
which they are such ministers: so that by this means the sheep are not
only committed to an Idol shepherd. I might say a wolf, and speak no
otherwise than Augustine speaks, in that a not preaching minister has
entrance into the Church, but the door also is shut upon him, and sparred
against any able minister that might happily be found out.

Io. Whitgifte.
And would you so gladly intrude your selves into some of their rooms? surely
I believe it, and it is not unknown but that some of you have labored to do
it: Well, I hau^ before told you the judgment of the reformed Churches
touching such ministers as be not able to preach, being otherwise virtuous and
godly. I have also set down the opinion of diverse learned and godly men,
concerning ministers admitted to minister the sacraments, which
notwithstanding can not preach. If any man use him self in his ministry
leau^ly, or otherwise than beseems him, his estate for term of life is not
so sure, but that he may be dispossessed of the same. Otherwise if he use him
self honestly, and as it becomes him, though he have not the gift of
preaching, (which notwithstanding is to be wyshed) God forbid that either you
or any man else, should seek to displace him, that you might enjoy the room
your selves. And surely if the minister were but tenant at will, or of
Courtesy (as you would seem to have him) his state should be most slauishe
and mis^rable, and he and his family ready to go a begging, when soever he
displeases his parish.

If you had told me where Augustine speaks that, I should have quickly let
you understand his meaning, but his books be many and large, the sentence you
allege short, and therefore it were to much for me to search^ it out.
Moreover it improueth nothing now in question. But with what face can you
^loute and jest at me, for once or twice not quoting the chapter or leaf: your
self so often offending in quoting neither chapter, leaf, book, nor tome?

There is a third fault which likewise appears almost in ye whole body of
this service and Lyturgie of England, and that is, that the pro^ite which might
have come by it unto the people is not reaped, whereof the cause is, for that
he which reads is not in some place heard, and in the most places not
understood of the people, through the distance of place between the people
and the minister, so that a great part of the people can not of knowledge
tell, whether he has cursed them or blessed them, whether he has read in
Latme or in English, all the which ryseth upon the word^s of* the book of
service, which are that the minister should stand in the accustomed place, for
thereupon the minister in saying Morning and Evening prayer, sytteth in the
Chauncel with his back to the people, as though he had some secret talk with
God which the people might not hear. And hereupon it is likewise, that after
Morning prayer, for saying another number of prayers he clymeth up to the
further end of the Chauncel, and runs as far from the people as the wall
will let him, as though there were some variance between the people and the
minister, or as though he were afraid of some infection of plague, and in
deed it renueth ye memory of the Leuitical priesthood, which did withdraw
him self from the people into the place called the holiest place, where he
talked with God, and offered for the sins of the people.

Io. Whitgifte.
This nothing touches the order or substance of the book, and therefore no
sufficient reason against it, if it were true. But you herein deal as you
have done in other matters, that is, corruptly and untruly. For you do not

and argues great impadencie, that you are not ashamed, to report untruly in
so public a cause. The words of the book be these: The Morning and Evening
prayer shall be used in the accustomed place of the Church, Chapel or
Chauncell, except it shall be otherwise determined by the Ordinary of the
place. And you leaving out all the rest, say, that the words of the book of
service are, that the minister should stand in the accustomed place: as though
it bound him of necessity to the Chauncell, which is nothing so. But you
Errors and ^isorder maynteyned by falsifying,

maynteyned, but by falsifying. I think there are but few Churches in England
where the By: shops have not taken a very good order for the place of prayer,
if any Bishop have neglected it, the fault is in the Bishop, not in the book.

But still I must desire the Reader to note the weightinesse of the reasons,
where by you go about to deface the book of common prayer.

Likewise ^or marriage he comes back again into the body of the Church,
and for baptism unto the Church door, what comeliness, what decency, what
edifying is this? Decency (I say) in running and trudging from place to
place: edifying, in standing in that place, and after that sort, where he can
worst be heard and understood. S. Luke shows that in the (...) Church
both the prayers and preachings, and the whole exercise of religion was done
otherwise. For he shows how S. Peter sytting amongst the rest, to the end
he might be the better heard, rose, and not that only, but that he stood in
the midst of the people, that his voice might as much as might be, come
indifferently to all their ear^s, and so standing both (...) and preached.
Now if it be said for the Chapters and Letanie, there is commandment given
that they should be read in the body of the Church, in deed it is true, and
thereof is easily perceived this disorder which is in saying the rest of the
prayers, partly in the hither end, and partly in ye ^urther end of the
Chauncel: for ^eeing that those are read in the body of the Church, that the
people may both hear and vnderst^nd what is read, what should be the cause why
the rest should be read further of. Unless it be, that either those things are
not to be heard of them, or at the least not so necessary for them to be
heard, as the other which are recited in the body or midst of the Church.
And if it be further said, that the book leaves that to the discretion of
the Ordinary, and that he may reform it, if there be any thing amiss, then
it is easily answered again, that besides that it is against reason, that the
commodity and edifying of the Church should depend upon the pleasure of one
man, so that upon his either good or evil advise and discretion, it should be
well or evil with the Church: Besides this (I sa^) we s^e by experience of the
disorders which ar^ in many Churches and Dioceses in this behalf, how that if
it were lawful to commit such authority unto one man, yet that it is not safe
so to do, considering that they have so evil q^tten them selves in their
charges, and that in a matter the inconvenience whereof is so easily seen, and
so easily reformed, there is notwithstanding so great and so general an abuse.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be passing weyghtie arguments to overthrow the book, and come from a
Weighty reasons against the book.
deep and profounde judgment: If I should use the like, you would wype
them away with scoffing. The book appoynteth, that the persons to be married
shall come into the body of the Church with their f^iendes and neighbors
there to be married: and what fault can you find in this? Is not the midst
of the Church the most meet place for such a matter? The book speaks
neither of the coming back of the minister, nor his going forward, these be
but your iestes: and yet must he go both backwarde and forward, if he will
either come into the Church, or go out of it. For baptism, ye book appoynteth
no place, but because there is no just cause known why the fon^e should be
removed, therefore the minister does stand where that is placed, which is
somewhere in one place, somewhere in another, for I know diverse plac^s where it
is in the midst of the Church, some place where it is in the nethermost
part, I know no place where it stands at the Church door. And therefore in
saying that for baptism the minister goes to the Church door, you do but
counterfeyte.

No man denies but that both praying and preaching. etc. ought to be in that
place where it may be best heard of all: and therefore the book does
prudently leave it to the discretion of the Bishop. But the midst is not the
fittest place for that purpose: He that stands in the midst of the Church
has some behind him, some before him, and some of each side of him, those
which be behind, or on the sides, can not so well hear, as those that be
before, as experience teaches in Sermons at the Spittle, at the Cross in
Paul's, and other places. Wherefore in my opinion that place in the Church is
most fittest, both for praying and preaching, where the minister may have the
people before him, except the Church be so great, and the people so many, that
he cannot be heard of them, then there ought to be some regard thereof.

S. Luke tells what S. Peter did in the congregation, he does not prescribe
any general rule: Every circumstance that is told in the scriptures, is not
streightway to be made an inviolable rule of all men to be followed. The place
is not material, so that it be such as the people may well hear and
understand that which is read and preached.

Concerning the lessons which are to be read, the book prescribes no place,
only it wills the minister to stand and to turn him so, as he may best be
heard of all such as be present. And are you offended at that? neither does y^
book appoint any certain place for the Le^anie to be said in, and therefore
you do but dally and trifle.

The Ordinary is the meetest man to whose discr^tion those things should be
le^t: both for his learning and wisdom, and also that there may be one
uniform or (...) his diocese: if any Ordinary be careless in such matters,
if you will complain of him, I am sure you shall be heard. But your delight and
pleasure is to be gyrding at Bishops, though the cause be forged.

the end: why does the book^ admit alteration? do you not see your solfe
manifestly convinced by the book? I believe, and I am well assured, that the
end is edification, whatsoever you imagine to the contrary. And undoubtedly
you have found out marvelous weighty and witty reasons against the whole
Lyturgie, or the most part of it: And the faults you have noted be very many
and exceeding great. But have you no conscience in calling good evil? or are
you not afraid upon so light quarrels to make such a schism in the Church,
and to bring so worthy a book into so great contempt? Well, you will one day
be better advised, I doubt not: which truly I wish for, and hope for, how
discourteously so ever you have used me.

That which M Doctor says, so unskillfully and unlike a divine, he has learned
of better and more skillful divines, than either of us both be: that is, of
Ambrose and of Calvin: for the one says: Omne verum a quocunque dicitur a

^eru^ vsus, quaru^ vitiosa est origo. The use of many things is pure, whose
beginning is vicious and vnpure. But M. Doctors bare affirmation (if he had so
used it) is of as good credit, as your bare negation: But when he has learned

To prove that ministers were not so tied to any form of prayer, invented by

Timo. 1. In the eight to the Romans the words be these: Likewise also the
spirit helps our infirmities, for we know not what to pray, as we
ought, but the spirit it self makes request for us, with fighes which cannot
be expressed. This place speaks nothing against any prescript form of
prayer, for then it should disallow the Lords prayer, but it teaches us that
it is the spirit of God that sturreth us up to pray, and makes us earnestly
pour out our supplications unto God. And thus the spirit works as well by
prescript prayers as by prayers suddenly invented. The words to Timothy Epist.

these. Unto Timothy my natural son in the faith, grace mercy and peace from

If you mean by prayers invented by man, such prayers as man inuenteth against
the word of God, as prayer for the dead, prayer unto saints, and such like,
then it is true that you say. But if you mean such prayers as by godly men be
framed according to the holy scriptures, whether they be for matters perteyning
to the life to come, or to this life, then you show your ignorance, for it is
manifest, that there has been always in the Church of Christ, a prescript
form of public prayer, as it appears in Justinius Martyr. Apol. 2. Pro

It is not to any purpose, that M. Doctor sets himself to prove that there
may be a prescript order of prayer by Iustine Martyrs testimony, which
notwithstanding has not one word of prescript form of prayers, only he says
there were prayers, he says in deed the ancient fathers say that there has
been always such kind of prayers in the Churches, and although they do say
so, yet all men may understand easily, that M. Doctor speaks this rather by
contecture, or that he has heard other men say so: for so much as that Doctor
which he has chosen out to speak for ^ll the rest, has no such thing, as he
fathereth on him. He says that after they have baptized, they pray for
themselves, and for him that is baptized, and for all men that they may be
meet to learn the truth, and to express it in their honest conversation, and
that they be found to keep the ^mmaundementes, that they may atteyne to
eternal life, but is this to say that there was a prescript form of prayer,
when he shows nothing else, but the chief points, upon the which they
conceived their prayers? If you had alleged this to prove what were the
matters or principal points that the Primitive Church used to pray for, you
had alleged this to purpose, but to allege it for a proof of a prescript
form of prayer, when there is not there mentioned so much as the essential
form of prayer (which is the asking of our petitions in the name and thorough
the intercession of our Savior Christ) without the which there is not, nor
cannot be any prayer, argues that either you little know what the form of
prayer is, or that you thought (as you charge the authors of the Admonition so
often) that this gear of yours should never have come to the examination.

But for as much as we agree of a prescript form of prayer to be used in the
Church, let that go: this that I have said is to show that when M. Doctor
happens of a good cause, which is very seldom in this book, yet then he
marreth it in the handling.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have the less labored in this point, because it is a thing so generally
allowed of in all Churches, in all times, and so unlearnedly impugned by the
authors of the Admonition.

Justinius Martyr makes much for my purpose, for in that he does rehearse those
chief points of their prayers then used, it is manifest that they had a
prescript order and form of prayer, the which no man can deny that reads
the place. I grant that these words prescript form of prayer, are not there
to be found: Yet is there a prescript order and form by him generally
described: whereby it is more than probable, that at that time, there was used
a prescript form of prayer. In the 3. Council Con^. Carth. 3 Can. 23.
of Carthage we find this Canon: Let no man use the forms of prayer which he
has framed to himself, without conference with brethren, that are better
learned. Whereby it may evidently be gathered, that at that time there was a
prescript form of prayer used, and that it was not lawful to use any new
form of private prayers, except the same were allowed by the brethren. But for
as much as in this point you consent with me, and grant that there may be a
prescript form of prayer: I will omit whatsoever I had purposed to have
said more in that matter: and so I will do also your taunts, respecting the
matter, rather than Lucians Rhetoric.

the same things in our prayers, but we may not speak contrary things.

After he a^irmeth, that there can be nothing showed in the whole book which
is not agreeable to the word of God.

I am very loath to enter into this field, albeit M. Doctor does thus provoke
me, both because the Papists will lightly take occasion of evil speaking,
when they understand that we do not agree amongst our selves in every point,
as for that some few professoures of the Gospelt being private men, boldened
upon such treatises, take such ways sometimes, and break forth into such
speeches, as are not meet, nor convenient.

Io. Whitgifte.
In so saying I do fully agree with such as have learnedly and truly written
against the common adversaries of this Book: among whom there is one that
wrote a Book Entitled: A sparing restraynt of many lauishe untruths, which
M. Doctor Harding does challenge in the first Article of my Lord of Sarisburies
Replye. The A sparing re^trayne.
Author of that book writes thus. O M. Harding turn again your writings,
examino your authorities, consider your Councels, apply your examples, look
if any line be blameable in our service, and take hold of your advantage. I
think M. Jewel will accept it for an Article. And a little after: Our service
is good and godly, every title grounded on holy Scriptures, and with what face
do you call it darkness? This was his opinion then of our service. And it
both was then, and is now my full persuasion: and I will (God willing) perform
that against you, which he offered in M. Jewel his name against Harding.

Your ^othnesse to enter into this field, is but dissembled: your continual
barking The Repliet his words contrary to his deeds.
against the state and form of this Church of England, does convince you of
the contrary. Neither have you any respect or regard for giving occasion o^
evil speech to the Papists, much less of provoking your adherentes to
undutiful speeches (as you pretend) your book tending wholly to the contrary.

Notwithstanding my duty of defending the truth, and love which I have first
toward God, and then toward my country, constrayneth me being thus provoked
to speak a few words more particularly of the form of prayer, that when the
blemishes thereof do appear, it may please the Queens inaiestie and her
honorable council, with those of the Parliament, whom the Lord has vs^o as
singular instruments to d^liuer this realm from the hot furnace and iron
yoke of the popish Egipte, to procure also, that the corruptions which we have
brought from them (as those with which we being so deeply died and stained,
have not so easily shaken of) may be removed from amongst us, to the end that
we being necrclicr both joined unto the sincerity of the gospel, and the
^ollicie of other reformed Churches, may thereby be joined nearer with the
Lord, and may be se^te so far from Rome, that both we may comfort our selves
in the hope, that we shall never return thither again, and our adversaries
which desire it, and by this to much agreement with them, and to little with
the reformed Churches, hope for it, may not only be deceived of their
expectation, but also being out of all hope, of that which they desire, may the
sooner yield themselves unto the truth, whereunto they are now disobedient.

Io. Whitgifte.
What duty can there be in defacing a known and received truth? what love, in
flaundering your country unjustly, and renting it in pieces with sects and
Schisms, and provoking the subjects to have mislikyng of their Magistrates,
and such as be placed in authority over them? these be but clokes to cover an
evil and ungodly purpose. If you shall be able to show any such blemishes in
the book of Common prayers, they shall not be covered for me: but if not, than
are you not a man to be credited.

I have told you M. Caluines, and M. Gualters opinion, touching the ambitious

morositie of such, as would have all Churches framed, after the example of
some one: and now I tell you again, that there is no cause why this Church
of England, either for truth of doctrine, sincerity of public divine
service, and other policy should give place to any church in Christendom:
and sure I am, that we are as (...) joined with the Lord our God, as the
members are to the body, and the body to the head.

Our adversaries have ^o such hope upon any such occasion as you pretend: if

their hope be any, it is especially in your contentions.

Wherein do we agree with the Papists, or wherein do we dissent from the
reformed Churches? with these we have all points of doctrine and substance
common: from the other we dissent, in the most part both of doctrine and
ceremonies. From what spirit come these bold and untrue speeches?

ministers of the word of God, and to the magistrates that which apperteyneth
unto them.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is true of the Papists: but they deal in their controversies more
circumspectly and warely, though they dissent in matters of far greater
importance, and in the chief points of their own Religion.

To the professors of the Gospel you give better Council than you have taken
your self: and you show an example contrary to your words: and therefore how
shall they believe you. But now to the matter: for hitherto you have uttered
nothing but words.

To come therefore to touch this matter. I answer that there is fault in the

that ought not to be, and things there are wanting in the order that should be.
Of the first sort is, that we may evermore be defended The collect of

from all adversity.

Io. Whitgifte.
The first fault that you find in the matter of prayer, is a portion of the
Collect of Trinity Sunday, wherein we pray, That we may evermore be defended
from al adversity: And is this the matter you mislike? let us then consider
your reason.

Chap. 2. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page 107. Sect. 1.
Now for as much, as there is no promise in the scripture, that we should be
free from all ad^ersitie, and that evermore, it scemeth that this prayer might
have been better conceived, being no prayer of faith, or of the which we ca^
assure our selves that we shall obtain it. For if it be said, that ^y the word
(adversity) is meante all evil, we know that it has no such signification
neither in this tongue of ours, neither in other tongues which use the same
word in common with us, but that it signifies trouble, vexation, and
cala^tie, from all the which we may not desire always to be deliuared. And
whatsoever can be alleged for the defense of it, yet every one that is not
contentio^s, may see that it needs some caution or exception.

Io. Whitgifte.
I think no man will contend with you for the signification of this word
(...): for it properly signifies all affliction or trouble that perteyneth
either to the body, or to the mind. And it is species mali, a kind of evil,
for Malum does conteyne not only vice and sin, but adversity also and
affliction.

But to come to your reason: you say, there is n^ promise in Scripture that we
should The argument retorted.
be fre^rom all adversity: and therefore we may not pray to be free from all
adversity. If this be a good argument then will I also reason thus: there is
no promise in Scripture that we should be free from all sin: therefore we may
not pray that we should be free from all sin. There is no promise in
Scripture, that we should be free from persecution but the contrary rather,
and therefore we may not pray against persecution. Likewise there is no promise
that we shall be always delivered from pouertic, and from diverse other
particular evils. To be short, if this rule and reason be good, then must we
pray for nothing, except first we search in the Scriptures, whether there be
any promise for the same or no.

But you and all Christians ought to understand, that our prayers and faith

to them, are grounded upon these promises. Whatsoever you ask in my name,
that will I do. And again: If you ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

n^me, he will give it you. Upon these promises is both our faith and prayers
grounded. John. 16.
But for because in asking of extern^ll things, we be uncertain whether they

be profitable for us or no, therefore we ask them with a condition (which
although if be not expressed, yet it is always understood) if it be Gods
will: being certaynely persuaded, that if those things we ask be profitable
for us, we shall obtain them for his promise sake. And for as much as all good
things come of God, whether they perteyne to the body, or to the soul, and
at all times to be delivered from adversity is on^ of his singular benefits,
we may no doubt beg the same at his hands, referring not withstanding the
granting of it to him, who knows what is better for us than we do our
selves. If you will spoil us of this liberty in praying, you shall not only
bring prayer into a narrow room, but depri^e us of one of the greatest and
most singular r^nsolations, that a Christian man can have in this world. We
cannot assure our selves that we shall obtain any external benefits by
prayer at Gods hands: because we know not whether that which we ask be
profitable for us or no: and yet God forbid, that we should cease from
praying even for such things. David being put out of his kingdom by his Son
Absolon, was not assured that he ^. Samuel. 15.
should be restored agay^e, and yet did he pray for it, with this condition, if
it pleased God. Christ himself prayed to have the cup of his passion
removed from him, Mattb. 26.
which undoubtedly he knew before would not be granted unto him. Many examples
there be in the Psalms, of prayers made for external things, of the obteyning
whereof the Prophet could not assure himself. Well says S. Augustine, When
Augustine.
thou do ask of God health of the body, if he know it be profitable for
thee, he will give it unto thee: if he give it not, then it is not profitable
for thee to have it. Therefore we may lawfully ask any external ben^fite at
Gods hand, because he has willed us so to do: and the same petition or
prayer, is a prayer of faith, because it has ^ promise in the Scripture to
ground upon, which is, Whatsoever you shall ask my Iobn. 16.
father in my name, etc. and such like. But the success of our prayer we must
commit to him of whom we ask, as David did.

And why should this manner of speaking seem so strange unto you, do we not
read in the. 91. Psalm, that a promise is made to those that love God in this
manner. Psal^. 91
There shall no eui^l come unto thee, neither shall any plague come nighe unto
thy dwelling. Is not this as much as though he should have said, thou shall
ever be defended from all adversity? for as learned interpreters say,
dictione mali omnis generis afflictiones, miserias, and aerumn as complectitur,
The Psalmist in that place by this word evil, does comprehend all kind of
afflictions, miseries and calamities: so that you have here the very words
expressed, that you find fault with in the prayer used on Trinity Sunday.
Wherefore they may still remain without any caution or exception. And I would
to God, you were as far from contention as those be that think so.

I might here add and say, that we are delivered from all adversity after
two Deliverance from adversity of two sorts.
sorts, that is, bodily and spiritually: Bodily, when we are not temporally
and externally afflicted with them. Spiritually, when we are not overcome by
them, or caused to decline from God, or to mistruste in his mercies. That we
may pray to be delivered from all adversity, in the first signification, I
have proved: that we ought so to do in the latter signification, there is no
Christian man that doubts.

Chap. 2. the. 10. Division.
T. C. Page 107. Sect. 2.
In the collect upon the twelfth sunday after Trinity Sunday, and likewise in
one of those which are to be said after the offertorie (as it is termed) is
done, request is made, that God would give those things, which we for our
unworthiness ^are not ask: for it carries with it still the note of the popy
she servile fear, and sauoureth not of that confidence and reverent
fam^liaritie, that the children of God have through Christ, with their
heavenly father, for as we dare not without our savior Christ ask so much as
a crumme of bread, so there is nothing which in his name we ^are not ask,
being needful for us, and if it be not needful why should we ask it?

Io. Whitgifte.
I pray you whether does ^he prayer of the Pharisey, that so extolled
himself, Humiliti^ (...) prayer.
or of the Publicane that so humbled himself like you better? bylike you
prefer the Luc. 18.
Pharisees prayer, else would you never find fault with us, for acknowledging
our own unworthiness, which is the root and ground of humility, one of the
principal ornaments of prayer. We are not worthy of the least benefit that
God bestows upon us: And therefore duty requires that we should not for
desert desire any thing at his hands: and humility says, that in desiring
we ought to acknowledge our own unworthiness. If a man be desirous to obtain
any thing at his father or fre^des hand, of whom he has received many
things, and not recompensed the least, is not this a meet kind of speech for
him to use? there is something necessary for me to have, but I dare not ask it
at your hands for my unworthiness, who have received so much already without
any kind of recompen^e: surely this is both the next way for him to obtain
that which he desires, and a good token not of servile fear, but of true
humility, and of that due reverence that a good child owes to a most
natural and loving father. The Publicane durst not come nighe, nor lift up
his eyes: so did he acknowledge his unworthiness, such was his humility. And
yet you know what Christ did pronounce of him, and what general rule he
groundeth Luc. 18.
upon that example, even this. Omnis qui se exaltat etc. Every one that
exalts himself shall be brought low. etc. You know also what the prodigal
son said to his own father after his father had embraced him, and
received him into mercy. Luc. 15.
Neque posthac sum dignus qui vocer filius tuus. And I am no more worthy to be
called thy son.

God forbid that we should so presume of our selves, that we should shut
humility, and the acknowledging of our own unworthiness, from faithful and
heartye prayer. In that therefore we say ( for our own unworthiness we dare
not ask it) we both ask it, and yet with all humility acknowledge our own
unworthiness: which if it be spoken unfeignedly, cannot be but greatly
accepted of God. And surely this kind of begging is most effectual and it is
used toward those to whom we think our selves most bound, and whom (for
their benefits bestowed upon us) we love most derely. Neither does this kind
of prayer sauoure of mistruste, but rather of great confidence, in the mercy
of God, at whose hands we crave those things, which we are of our selves
unworthy to ask, or receive.

not we pray to be delivered from perilles and dangers, except they be

say in our daily prayer libera nos a malo, deliver us from evil? What know
we when there is any danger of thundering and lightning: have we not
examples of diverse that have suddenly perished with the same? Is it not
therefore necessary to pray for deliverance from thunder and lightning, as
well as from other dangers, though they be not present? well, men may see
whereunto this gear tends, if Magnificar and Nunc dimittis etc.
they be not blind. Benedictus also, Nunc dimi^tis and Magnificat, be great
motes in your eyes, but you show no reason worthy to be answered: only in
derision you say, except some of them were ready to die, or would celebrate
the memory of the Virgin, or John Baptiste. As though these Hymns or Psalms
were not profitable for all men, as the rest of the holy scripture is, but
these especially, because they contain the mystery of our salvation, and the
praise of God for the same. By this your reason we may not use any of the
Psalms, until we be in like case as David was, or other, when they were first
made. But I think now the time is come, when those shall correct Magnificat,
Qui nesciunt quid significat. Truly this your doing is a mere profanation of
holy scriptures.

T. C. Page 107. Sect. 2.
And if all the prayers were gathered together, and referred to these two
heads of Gods glory, and of the things which perteyne to this present life,
I can make no Geometrical and exact measure, but verily I believe, there shall
be found more than a third part of the prayers which are not Psalms and
textes of scripture, spent in ^raying for, and praying against the
incommodities of this life, which is contrary to all the arguments or
contents of the prayers of the church which are ^et down in the scripture,
and especially of our savior Christ's prayers, b^ the which ours ought to be
directed, which of seven petitions bestows one only that ways: And that
these fo^esayde prayers do not onel^ in general words, but by de^uctyng the
commodities and incommodities of this life i^to their particular kinds, and
that we pray for the avoiding of those dangers which are noth^g near us, as
from lightning and thundering in the myddest of winter, from stor^e and tempest,
when the weather is most fair, and the seas most calm. etc. It is true that
upon some urgent calamities prayer may and ought to be fra^ed, which may beg
either the commodity, for want whereof the church is in distress, or the
turning away of that mischief, which either approaches, or which is already
upon it, but to make those prayers which are for the present time and danger,
ordynary and daily prayers, I cannot hitherto see any either scrupture or
example of the primitive church. And here for the symples sake, I will set
down after what sort this abuse crept into the church.

Io. Whitgifte.
I think you do confess and acknowledge that it is lawefull to pray for
things which perteine to this present life: if you should deny it, I could
confute you by the prayer that Jacob made to be delivered from the hands of
his brother Esau, Ge, 32. and by sundry of the Psalms, and diverse examples in
the Gospel, of such as craved the like things at Christ's hands, and
obtained their desire: how many such prayers be in the book of common prayer,
it skilleth not, so long as you cannot prove them to be other than godly and
necessary.

If in every prayer we make some petition for temporal things, we do but
imitate and follow that prayer which Christ has prescribed unto us, both as
a most necessary prayer, and as a rule also to frame and form all our
prayers by. You might as well prove that we ought not so often to ask
remission and forgiveness of our sins, because of seven petitions, there is
but one only bestowed that way. How far therefore this reason is from
godliness and reason, the godly and reasonable Reader may i^dge. All things to
be prayed for tend to the glory of God.


All things we pray for tend to the glo^ie of God, who is the author and
giver of all things, both eternal and temporal. Things that are to be prayed
for, are of two sorts, the o^e temporal, the other eternal: but they both
perteyne to the glory of God though not equally and in like manner.

shall we not pray to be delivered from thundering and lightening, stormeand

and danger, these things being in Gods hands to punish us with, even in a
moment, and when we think it most unlike? have we not sundry examples of
such as have suddenly perished with thundering and lightening, and some sithence

credited vpyour bare word against so many grave, learned, wise and godly men,

order and reason: and it is to great presumption for you with so light and
slender reasons to go about the overthrow of that, which so many godly and
learned men have both liked and allowed, except they had allowed that which the
scriptures do disalowe.

There was one Mamereus bishop of Vienna, which in the time of great
earthquakes which were Plat. cap. Leo.
in France, instituted certain supplications, which the Grecians and we of
them, call the Letany, which concerned that matter, there is no doubt but as
other discommodities rose in other countries, they likewise had prayers
accordingly. Now pope Gregor^e either made himself, or gathered the
su^plications that were made against the calamities of every country, and made
of them a great Letany or supplication, as Platina calls it, and gave it to
be used in all churches, which thing albeit all churches might do for the time,
in respect of the case of the calamity which the churches suffered, yet there
is no cause why it should be perpetual, that was ordained but for a time, and
why all lands should pray to be delivered from the incommodities that some
land has vin troubled with.

Io. Whitgifte.
As though we were not at all times subject to these perilles and dangers: and
as though we ought not by the calamity of other nations, to be moved earnestly
to pray against the like, which might also happen to us.

It is not to be doubted, but that the prayer of the just is acceptable to
God, and that of his mercy he being thereby moved, does stay from plaguing us
with earthquakes, thundering and lightenyng and such like calamities, wherewith
he would otherwise punish us.

Truly your reasons be marvelous profane, and they might as well be alleged,
The reason used against the Letanie is of the same force against the psalms.
against any of the Psalms, which all were made at the first upon some
special occasion, and yet are profitable for ever, in all states of the
Church to be used. Whatsoever good and godly prayer, in the time of any common
misery and calamity has been invented, the same is at other times profitable
to be used in the Church, because the like punishments and plagues, are in Gods
hands, at all times to execute upon sinners, and therefore continually to be
prayed against.

The like may be said of the Gloria patri, and the Athanasius Creed, it was

the detestable opinion of Arius and his Disciples, wherewith at that time
maruelously swarmed almost the whole Christendom, A weak reason.
now that it has pleased the Lord, to quench that fire, there is no such
cause why these things should be in the Church, at the least why that Gloria

Trinity, such as is necessary for all Christian men to learn and know: and
therefore he that is offended with the often repetition or saying of either of
them, I cannot tell what I should judge of him. But undoubtedly there is great
cause why I should suspect him at the least of singularity and unquietness.
Shall we not oftentimes rehearse the Articles of our belief in God the Father,
the Son, and the holy Ghost, because all men be now persuaded therein, and
none known that makes any doubt? the reason is all one, and preuayleth as
well against the repeating of this, as of the other. I think your meaning is,
that we know to much, and therefore now we must learn to forget.

Well your authority is little, and your reasons much less, and therefore
they are like to stand in Statu quo: and this is most sure, that harm they
do none, but much good, because a good thing cannot be to often said or heard.

Moreover to make Benedictus, Magnificat, and Nunc dimittis, ordinary and
daily prayers, seems to be a thing not so convenient, considering that they
do no more concern us, than all other scriptures do, and than does the Aue
Maria, as they called it. For although they were prayers of thanks giving in
Simeon, Zachary, and the blessed virgin Mary, yet can they not be so in us,
which have not received like benefits, they may be added to the number of
Psalms, and so song as they be, but to make daily and ordinary prayers of
them, is not without some inconvenience and disorder.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here is no reason showed, nor any thing answered to that I have alleged to
prove the contrary. Your objection of the Aue Maria is vain, for it
perteyneth to the virgin only, and is spoken to her persons. But if it were
not so: what kind of reasoning call you this? The Church does not use daily
in public prayer to say Aue Maria, Ergo it may not say Benedictus,
Magnificat or Nunc dimittis, these three are most metest for us, for they
contain (as I have said in my Answer) the mystery of our salvation and the
praise of God for the same, and therefore cannot be to often either said or
song.

answered unto those things, which are contained in the. 202. 203. pages,
saving that I must admonish the reader, that whereas you will prove that we
ought to have an ordinary prayer, to be delivered from danger of Thunder,
Lightninges. etc. because there are examples of certain that have been killed
thereby, you might as well bring in a prayer, that men may not have fails
from their horses, may not fall into the hands of robbers, may not fall into
waters, and a number such more sudden deaths, wherewith a greater number are
taken away, than by thunderinges or lighteninges, and such like, and so there
should be never any end of begging these earthly commodities, which is
contrary to the form of prayer, appointed by our Savior Christ.

Io. Whitgifte.
The punishment of God by thundering and lightening, is more notorious and
terrible, not by any help of man to be repelled: where as the other things
that you speak of, come oftentimes and most commonly through negligence,
wylfulnes, unruliness, to much boldness, vndiscretenes of the parties themselves:
besides this there are ordinary means to avoid them, and yet I think it
most convenient, that we should pray against those euilles, and so does the
Church daily in the last collect, used in the morning prayer: which thing
also is most consonant to the Lords prayer, petitions to the like end and
purpose, being there expressed.

And whereas you allege the petition of the Lords prayer (deliver us from
evil) to prove this prayer against thunder, etc. besides that, all the
commodities and discommodities of this life are prayed for, and prayed against
in that petition, whereby we desire our daily bread, it is very strange to
apply that to the thunder, that is understood of the Devil, as the article
(...) does declare, and it is a marvelous conclusion that for so much, as we
ought daily and ordinarily, and publicly desire to be delivered from the
Devil, Ergo we ought daily, and ordinarily, and publicly d^syre to be
delivered from thunder: it is one thing to correct Magnificat, and an other
thing to show the abuse of it. And therefore I fee no cause why you should use
this allusion between Magnificat and significat, unless it be for that you
purposing to set out all your learning in this book, would not so much as
forget an old rotten proverb, which trotted amongst the monks in their
cloisters, of whom I may justly say which Tully said in an other thing, Nec
quicquam ingenium potest monasterium: that is, the cloister could never bring
forth any witty thing, for here although there be Rythmus, yet it is sine

otherwise you would be more upright and sincere in your dealing. The effect of
my Answer to the Admonition is, that for as much as this word malum in the

it perteyne to the body or to the mind, therefore all such prayers as are for
our deliverance, from external perilles and dangers, being grounded upon that
petition, are lawful, whether they be daily used or otherwise, in which
sort and kind those prayers are, wherein we desire to be delivered from
thundering and lightning, the dangers thereof being so frequente, and so
terrible.

And whereas you say, that the word Evil, does there signify the Devil, and
therefore not adversity, and external evil that happens to the body, you
shall understand your error, by the expositions both of the old and new
writers. Cyprian in his exposition upon the Lords prayer interpreting these
words says thus. In the last Cyprian.
place we put. But delivers us from evil: comprehending all kind of
adversities, which the enemy works against us in this world. And a
little after: But when we say, deliver us from evil, there remains nothing
which ought further to be desired, seeing we pray at once for the protection of
God against evil, which being obtained, we stand secure and safe, against all
things which the world and Devil works.

Augustine likewise in his Epistle ad Probam viduam in number. 121. and Cap.
11. expounds Augustinus.
the same words in like sort. When we say deliver us from evil: we admonish
to consider that we are not as yet in that good (estate) where we shall suffer
no evil: and this which is last placed in the Lords prayer, is extended so
far, and so plainly, that a Christian man moved with any kind of
tribulation, may in this petition sigh, in this shed his tears, begin
herein, continue herein, and end his prayer herein.

M Bucer expounding the same words in his Commentaries upon the. 6. of Matthew,
Bucer.
says. Satan is therefore called a tempter, because he does tempte and
exercise us: especially laboring for this, that he may withdraw us from a
right faith in God: but if he cannot bring that to pass (such is his hatred)
then he does rejoice in afflicting and molesting us, with external evils, as
we read that he has done against Job and other holy men. And a little after:
Wherefore for as much as Satan is (as it were our tormenter, by whose
ministry God does also outwardly exercise us) in this respect, the prayer, to
be delivered from bodily evils, is included in this last petition. In like
manner does Musculus expound the same: and do you think that these men did
not understand their Pater noster? You see therefore that although the word
signify the Devil, yet it nothing hinders my interpretation, but makes much
for it, because the Devil is the Author of all evil, that comes either to
the body or to the soul, and therefore being delivered from him, there is no
cause why we should be any longer careful.

There is no abuse of Magnificat as yet showed, but there is a very unlearned
reason in the Admonition put, why it should not be used, to the Answer whereof
you have not replied, and therefore I may justly say of their correcting of
Magnificat, that which I have said: and the Proverb is meet for such
unskillful persons: but your childish or rather profane iestes and scoffs be
not seeming for a Divine, and him that would he counted so greatly learned and
mortified.

As these are diverse things more than ought to be conveniently, so want there
some things in the prayers: there are prayers set forth to be said in the
common calamities, and universal scourges of the realm, as plague, famine,
etc. And in deed so it ought to be, by the word of God, joined with a public
fast commanded, not only when we are in any calamity, but also when any the
churches round about us, or in any country receive any general plague, or
grievous chastisement at the Lords hand. But as such prayers are needful
whereby we beg release from our distresses, so there ought to be as
necessarily prayers of thanks giving, when we have received those things, at
the Lords hand, which we asked in our prayers. And thus much touching the
matter of the Great faults in little matters.

Io. Whitgifte.
If any thing lack in the book, that derogateth nothing from that which is
good and godly in the same: neither is it any cause why any man should deprave
it or make such a stir and schism in the Church for it.

It is meet that we should as well give thanks for the benefits received, as
to pray for the receiving of them: neither is the book void of any such
kind of prayers. These be vut very small quarrels against the book, and
slender faults (if they were faults) to make so great a schism for. But as I
said with S. Augustine, August. Epist. 121.
against the Authors of the Admonition, so say I unto you. If thou runnest
through all the words of the holy prayers, I suppose thou shall find nothing
which the Lords prayer does not conteyne: therefore we may in other words
speak the same things in our prayers, but we may not speak contrary things.
You have not as yet, neither will you ever be able to show one line in any
prayer contained in that book, to be contrary to the word of God, or not
consonant or agreeable unto the same. And this dealing of yours against it upon
so weak reasons (or rather none at all) argues that you seek only
contention, and that your chief quarrel is at the mainteyners of the book,
and not at the matter.

Concerning the form, there is also to be misliked: a great cause whereof is
the following of the form used in Popery, against which I have before spoken.
For whylest that service was set in many points as a pattern of this, it
comes to pass, that in stead of such prayers as the primitive Churches have
used, and those that be reformed now use, we have diverse These are ^seemely
term* for Godly prayers, be they re^ so sho^t
short curtes and shreddings, which may be better called wishes than prayers.
And that no man think that this is some idle fancy, and that it is no matter
of weight what form of prayer we use, so that the prayers be good, it must be
understood, that as it is not sufficient to preach the same doctrine which
our Savior Christ and his Apostles have preached, Where learn you that*
unless the same form of doctrine, and of teaching be likewise kept: so is it
not enough that the matter of our prayer be such as is in the word of God,
unless that the form also be agreeable unto the forms of prayers in the
scripture. Now we have no such forms in the scripture as that we should pray
in two or The Lords prayer is not much more: the prayers of the publican, of
Steven, and of Christ on the Cross, are much less.
three lines, and then after having read a while some other thing come and pray
as much more, and so to the. xx. and. xxx. tune, with pawses between.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have very aptly answered your self, though you would seem to make it
an objection, and to wipe it away: for undoubtedly when you thought that other
men would count this d^uise of yours an idle fancy, you thought truly, and
your own thought therein condemns you. But I add that it is not only an
idle fancy, but an untrue surmise: for first, which be those prayers that the
primitive Church used, in stead whereof we have but short cuttes and
shreddings? Why do you not name them? Will you still speak without proof?
Will you raise up a general slander, and show no particulars?

Touching your charging us with following of the form used in Popery, I have
answered before, where you have in like manner objected it, and only objected
it.

How prove you that it is not sufficient, to preach the same doctrine that
our Savior The fensie of the ^plyer concerning the form of preaching.
Christ and his Apostles have preached, unless the same form of teaching be
likewise kept? For I take that to be an idle fancy, and utterly untrue. I am
persuaded that if the same doctrine be preached, the manner and form of
preaching is left for every one to use, according to the gift that God has
given unto him, as he shall think it to be most expedient to edifying: but
this is an old fancy of yours, partly grounded upon an arrogant opinion of
your self, whose manner and form of preaching you would bind all men: unto
partly of emulation and envy, because you have perceived other men's manner and
kind of preaching, to have been much better lyked than yours. But to let this
pass, Christ and his Apostles did not usually pray before nor after their
Sermons, or at the least it is not expressed in Scripture that they did: they
when they preached did not usually take any one certain place or portion of
Scripture to entreat of: and it is manifest that they used not any uniform
manner of preaching, but they spoke as God gave them utterance: neither did they
labor or study for their Sermons, but preached as present occasion served:
and therefore for my part, until I hear very good reasons of this new
devise, I must needs account it a very fond imagination.

Show me wherein the form of our prayers does differ from the manner and form
of praying contained in the Scripture? Or show me in the Scripture, any
prescript form of public and daily prayers commanded, the Lords prayer
only excepted. Or let me understand what scripture you can allege why in the
public congregation, we may not sometime pray, and sometimes read the
scriptures: and what do we else in the whole order of our service? will you
still more and more utter your contempt against God, against his Church against
a most pure and godly kind of public prayer and service, and that with such
irreverent speeches? But I omit the^, it is enough to have noted the^ in the
margent, for they are co^futation to themselves.

If a man should come to a Prince and keep such order in making his petitions
unto him, that having very many things to demand, after he had demanded one
thing he would stay a long time, and then demand another, and so the third,
the Prince might well think, that either he came to ask, before he knew what
he had need of, or that he had forgotten some piece of his suit, or that he
were distracted in his understanding, or some other such like cause of the
disorder of his supplication. And therefore how much more convenient were it,
that according to the manner of the reformed Churches: first the minister with
an humble and general confession of faults, should desire the assistance of
the Lord, for the fruteful handling and receiving of the word of God, and then
after that we have heard the Lord speak unto us in his word, by his
minister, the Church should likewise speak unto the Lord, and present all
those petitions and suits at once, both for the whole Church, and for the
Prince, and all other estates which shall be thought needful.

As much differencs as there is betwixt man and God: so far is your

from proving your purpose: except you will admit the like similitude used by
the Papists, to prove praying to Saints: for the one has as much strength to
prove ani^ thing as the other, and yet neither of them both worth a rush. And
here you do injury to God, to compare him to an earthly Prince, especially in
this behalf. For what Prince would not think himself abused, if a man
should daily and hourly sue unto him? But it is not so with God: for we have
a commandment to pray continually. Luke. 18. 1. These. 5. and he does not
respect the form of words, but the affection of the heart. And in very deed
it is most convenient that reading of the scriptures and praying should be
intermingled.

All the scripture that you have to allege is the reformed Churches, let other
men think what they will, I verily believe that in our manner and kind of
worshipping God, in our public and common prayers, there is no cause why we
should think our selves one whit inferior unto them: they also or the must
part of them, have allowed the same order of ours, at what time the like
contention was about the same book, among our English me^ which were in Q.
Mary's time banished for the gospel.

And if any will say that there are short prayers found in the Acts, it may be
answered that S. Luke does not express the whole prayers at large, but only
set down the sums of them and their chief points. And further it may be
answered, that always those prayers were continued together, and not cut off,
and shred into diverse small pieces.

Io. Whitgifte.
How know you that S. Luke does not express the whole prafers at large, but
only set down the sums of the^ and their chief points? What scripture have you
that teaches you so to think? and if this be a sufficient answer to say, the
scripture has not expressed the whole. etc. Why is it not also a sufficient
answer for me to that which follows, that the scripture The scripture has
not prescribed any form of public prayer*
has not expressed any certain, or determinate form of public prayer to be
used in all Churches (as in deed it has not) but only in the Lords prayer
given certain general points, according to the which all our prayers must be
framed? Surely your fancy is strong, but your arguments be exceeding weak.
For tell me I pray you, where have you in the whole new testament (the Lords
prayer only excepted) any form of public prayer used in the Church
described? If you cannot show this, why do you so childishly dally?

Another fault is that all the people are appointed in diverse places, to say
after the Minister, whereby not only the time is unprofitably wasted, and a
confused voice of the people, one speaking after another caused, but an opinion
bred in their heads, that those only be their prayers which they say and
pronounce with their own mouths. Which causes them to give the less heed
to the rest of the prayers which they rehearse not after the Minister, which
notwithstanding are as well their prayers, as those which they pronounce after
the Minister, otherwise than the order which is left unto the Church, of God
does bear. For God has ordained the Minister to this end, that as in public
meetings, he only is the mouth of the Lord from him to the people, even so he
ought to be Untruth*
only the mouth of the people from them unto the Lord, and that all the
people should attend to that which is said by the Minister, and in the end
both declare their consent to that which is said, and their hope that it shall
so be and come to pass which is prayed, by the word Amen. As S. Paul
declares in the Epistle to the Corinthians. And Iustine Martyr 1. Cor. 14. 1.
Apol. pro Christianis.
shows to have been the custom of the Churches in his time.

Io. Whitgifte.
God be thanked, that the book is so per^te, that you are constreyned for
saving your credit with your Disciples, thus triflingly to deal with it: you
unchristianly say, that the time is unprofitably wasted, which is spent in
prayer: you imagine that of the people, that never entered into their thoughts:
you call it a confused voice, that is a most acceptable sound unto the Lord:
and if to surmise or to imagine be sufficient, then may we imagine your
doctrine to tend to the contempt of prayer, and the ouerthwarting of all good
and godly order. But you must know that there is more special cause, why the
people should rather rehearse after the Minister those things that the book
appoynteth them so to do, than the other prayers, because they conteyne a
general confession of sins, which all Christians together as well in voice,
as in heart, ought to confess: neither does the book prescribe the people to
say any thing after the Minister (the Lords prayer after the Communion only
excepted) but these general Muscul. in (...) Math.
and public confessions: and yet if it did, I see not how you can justly
therefore reprove it. Musculus expounding these words, Et cum bymnum
cecinissent. etc. thinks it not unlikely ipsum ita praeloquutu^ esse, vt
verba ipsius ab illis sint excepta and vicissim reddita. That Christ did in
that order speak before his Disciples, that they repeated his words after
him. Whereby it appears that he was so far from thinking this order to be
on unprofitable wasting of time, that he doubts not to ascribe it to our
Savior Christ and his Apostles. But if it be such an unprofitable wasting of
time, to rehearse prayer after the Minister, how happens it, that you and all
other your partners that be preachers, use to cause the people to pray after
you in your Sermons? Is it lawful for you so to do in the Pulpite, and is it
not lawful for the Minister to do the same in the Church? Belike nothing is
well done that you do not your selves, or are not the Authors of.

But here I cannot omit that which you so boldly affirm, of the Minister, whom
The ministes not the only mouth of the people.
you say God has ordained to be the only mouth of the people from them unto
the Lord in public meetings: are you of that opinion, that the people may
join with the minister in pronouncing public prayers, at no time? Or that
they should only attend to that which is said by the Minister, and in the
end give their consent by this word Amen? Has God ordained this? I pray you
where find you this ordinance? Sure I am that the place by you alleged does
not prove it. For although it be true that the Minister is the mouth of the
people to God, yet does it not follow, that he is the only mouth of the
people unto the Lord* And although we read that the people used to give their
consent unto the prayer pronounced of the Minister, by this word Amen: yet if
you will hereof conclude that they ought only to say Amen: and at no time
join as well in voice as in heart, with the Minister (which you seem to
affirm in saying he is the only mouth) then besides the weakness of your
conclusion, the practice of the Church of God will sufficiently confute you.
We read that when Peter and John were let go, after their examination before
the Priests and Elders, for healing the man that was lame from his mothers
womb, they came to the rest of his Disciples, and declared to them what had
happened, and when they heard that, Act. 4.
they lift up their voices to God with one accord, and said, Lord thou art
God, etc. So that the Minister here was not the only mouth of the people, but
the whole company that was assembled joined together in this prayer, lifted up
their voices and spoke with one accord. And surely it is not unlike, that they
used herein that order which you before accounted an unprofitable wasting of
time: for seeing that this prayer was framed according to the present occasion,
I am persuaded that the rest did rather repeat the words after him that
conceived the prayer, than that they all miraculously joined upon the sodeyne
in one and the same for me of words. Pliny in an Epistle to Plinius Epist.
lib. 10.
Traiane the Emperor concerning the Christians, writes that their custom was
stato die ante lucem conuenire carmenque Christo quasi Deo dicere, secum
inuicem, etc. to meet together early at an appointed day, and to sing together
a song unto Christ as unto God. Chrysostom going about to prove that in some
respect there is no difference betwixt the Priest and people, uses this for an
example, that in public prayer they sometime join together. His words be
these, Quin and precibus. etc. A man may also see the people Chrysostom. hom. 18.
in. 2. Cor.
to offer many prayers together for those that are possessed and penetenciaries
(as they term them) for common supplications are made both of the Priest, and
of them, and they all say one prayer, etc. And again, quid miraris si cum
sacerdote populus loquitur? why do thou marvel if the people speak
together with the priest, etc. You can not be ignorant (I am sure) that Basil
likeneth the sound of men, women, and children praying in the Church, to the
roaring of the waves against the Sea banks. This Basil. Hexam.
might you have seen also even in that place of Iustine Martyr which you
quote: for 4. Apol. 2.
there describing the liturgy, he says, that after the exhortation or Sermon,
Omnes surgimus and compre^amur, we do all rise and pray together, etc. This you
skipped over, and took that which followed, because it made more for your
purpose: for indeed Iustine does describe both, that is both the prayer of the
whole Church together, and of the Bishop alone the people giving their consent
by this word Amen. I need not to use mo testimonies, these may suffice to
declare by the practice of the Church, that the Minister is not the only mouth
of the people in public meetings, which you have only set down without any
proof, for what purpose, you know best your self, surely I cannot
conjecture, except it be that the people should wholly depend upon the
Ministers words, and as it were hang upon his lips, which where unto it
would in time grow, wise men can consider.

But what need I to stand so long upon this point, seeing you your self

affirm as much* For finding fault with the order of singing Psalms side by
side, you have these words. From whence soever it came, it cannot be good,
consydering that when it is granted that all the people may praise God (as it
is in singing of Psalms) there this ought not to be restreyned unto a few,
and where it is lawful both with heart and voice, to sing the whole Psalm,
there it is not meet that they should sing but the one half with their heart
and voice, and the other with their heart only. For where they may both with
heart and voice sing, there the heart is not enough. Than the which, what can
be more contrary to this, that the Minister ought to be the only mouth of the
people to the Lord? For here you affirm that all the people may praise God,
and sing Psalms, not with heart only, but with voice, and so to be their own
mouth unto the Lord. How you can reconcile this geere I see not: sure I am
that truth is not contrary to it self.

Although these blottes in the common prayer be such, as may easily enough

But you say, a number of things contrary unto Gods word are contained in
this book, as baptism by women. etc.

Here is not one prayer in all the Communion book found fault with, and yet
your quarrel is against a prescript form of prayers invented by man.

You marvelously forget your self, and confusedly go from matter to matter,
without any consideration.

Digressing therefore from prayers contained in the Communion book, you come
to other matters in the same, against Gods word (as you say) and first you
allege baptising by women.

I deny baptising by women to be expressed in that book, and when you have
proved it to be necessarily gathered out of the same, then shall you hear my
judgment thereof.

T. C. Page 109. Sect. 4.
Master Doctor requires that it should be proved unto him, that by pryuate
Baptism is meant, Baptism by women. First it is meant that it should be done
by some other than the Minister, for that the Minister is bid to give them
warning, that they should not baptize the child at home in their house,
without great cause and necessity: secondarily, I would gladly ask him who
they be that are present, when the child is so shortly after it is borne, in
great danger of death, and last of all Master Doctor does not see, how he
accuses all the Magistrates of this Realm of the neglect of their duty, in
that they allow of the daily practicing by women in baptising children, if so
be that the book did not so appoint it, or permit it. If he ^nt plainly herein
there needed not so much a do.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here is nothing said which the Authors of the Admonition have not alleged
before, either in their book or in their Additions, and therefore the same
answer that was made unto them, will serve for you. I told you there Why
baptism is called private.
that the book of Common prayer does call it private Baptism, in respect of
the place, which is a private house, and not in respect of the Minister: which
evidently appears in these words, which you your self allege in this
place, that is, that the Minister is bid to give them warning, that they
should not baptize the child at home in their house. etc. but you cannot
thereof conclude the meaning of the Book to be, that women should baptize:
for even in that necessity, the Curate may be sent for, or some other minister
that may sooner be come by.

Your question is soon answered, for no man doubts of the persons that be
present at such a time: but I have told you, that when such necessity
requires, the Curate, or the next Minister is soon sent for, as often times
he is in as great extremities as that: and what a reason call you this, women
be present when the child that is borne is in great danger of death,
therefore the Minister cannot be sent for to baptize the child?

To your objection (of the Magistrates allowing the practice of Baptising by
women) I answer first, that your general proposition is untrue (as I think)
for all the Magistrates of this Realm, do not so. Secondly, that if they did,
yet it follows not that they do it by the authority of the Book: for many
things be permitted as tolerable, which are not established by any law: and
therefore if you had done well, you should rather have reproved the custom
that does use it, than the book that speaks never a word of it.

I deal as plainly as I can, for I keep me to the Book. But your vain
conjectures and frivolous reasons against that book, may not be yielded unto,
but opened, that they may appear in their colors.

force to prove your purpose. Christ in the. 28. of Matthew, said to his
disciples, Go and teach all nations, baptisyng them in the name of the father.

than this does: Ergo pastors may not baptize, for it is manifest that an
Apostle is dislincte from a Pastor.

The place of the. 28. of Saint Matthew is as strong against women's baptizing
as it is against their preaching. For Untruth, (...) has (...)
the ministry of the word and Sacraments can not be pulled in sunder, which
ye Lord has joined together from time to time. For These examples prove not
the purpose.
Noah which was a preacher unto the old world of the will of God, was
ordained also of God to make the Arc, which was a Sacrament and seal of his
preaching, touching the destruction of the world. And These examples prove not
the purpose.
Abraham whom the Lord would have to be the Doctor of his church, which was
then in his family, was also commanded to minister the Sacrament of
circumcision unto his family. The These examples prove not the purpose.
Priests and Levites which were appointed to teach the people, were also
appointed to sacrifice and to minister other sacraments in the Church.
Likewise the same Prophets which God stirred up to preach, he also ordained to
confirm the same by signs and Sacraments. The These examples prove not the
purpose.
same may be also drawn throughout the new Testament, as unto every of the
twelve, and afterward to the seventy, power was given both to preach the
Gospel, and also to confirm with signs and miracles, which were seals of
their Doctrine. And These examples prove not the purpose.
Saint Paul by the commandment that our Savior Christ gave him to
preach, undertook also to baptize, although there were no express words
that licenced him thereunto, for he knew right well that it was the
perpetual ordinance of God, that the same should be the ministers of the
word and Sacraments. Whereupon it follows, that forasmuch as women may
not prcache the Gospel, no not by the laws of the realine, that they ought
not to minister Baptism.

Io. Whitgifte.
My reason alleged in my Answer to the Admonition, why this place does not
make any necessary conclusion against the baptizyng by Women, is not answered:
but there is a new collection made of the same place, which is of as great
force as the other: for you might as well conclude thus: Ergo, Pastors may not
preach, because Pastors be not Apostles. I speak of the Argument, not of
the thing. For I would not have the Scriptures abused to confirm, no not a
truth, least it make men the bolder to wreast them at their pleasure, and for
the confirming of error. M. Zuinglius in his book De Baptism says, that
Christ did Zuinglius.
not in this place of Mathewe, institute baptism nor prescribe either time,
place, or any other circumstance, perteyning to the same.

I have proved before, that the administration of the Sacraments, may be
committed to some, to whom the public preaching of the word is not
committed, and your examples here alleged do not prove the contrary,
except you will Tract. 9. ca. 1. sect. 15.
have us to ground points of doctrine, upon bare examples: which if we
should do, many inconveniences would follow, yea even baptizyng by women,

were preachers of the word. But they cannot prove that it was only committed
unto them, and to no other. It is not required of you to prove whither he that
may preach, may also administer the sacraments, but whither it be of
necessity, that none should be admitted to minister the sacraments except the
same also be admitted to preach: the contrary whereof I have showed before.

The second place you do allege is. 1. Cor. 14. where Paul says it is a
shame for Women to speak in the congregation: Paul says not, it is a shame
for women to speak at home in private houses, for women may instruct their
families, yea and they may speak also in the Congregation, in time of
necessity, if there be none else there, that can or will preach Christ, and
hereof we have examples.

T. C. Page 110. Lin. 13. and. Sect. 1.
But M. Doctor rises up, and says that a woman in time of necessity, and
where there is none other that either can or will preach, may preach the
Gospel in the Church.

This is strange doctrine, and such as strengthens the Anabaptists hands,
and sauoureth stronger that ways, than any one thing, in all the Admonition,
which is so often condemned of Anabaptisme. His first reason to prove it, is
that there are examples thereof. When we allege the examples How vain this
brag is, has bin showed Tract. 3.
of all the churches of the Apostles times, to prove the election of the
minister by the Church, and in other cases which are general examples,
approved and executed by the Apostles, contrary to no commandment nor
institution of God, yea, and as has bin proved according to the commandment
of God, M. Doctor gives us our answer in a word, that examples prove not: now
that the question is to make good women's preaching in the Church, examples, I
will not say of all churches, but of no one Church, only of a few singular
persons, not according to the 1. Cor. 14. 1. Tim. 2.
commandment of the word of God, but clean contrary to the prescript word of
God: I say now examples, and such singular examples are good proofs and strong
arguments.

Io. Whitgifte.
In what point does he strengthen the Anabaptists? If you could have told I
trust it should not have bin kept in silence. I have charged the Authors of the
Admonition with nothing, but I have showed my author for it, deal you with me

precepts make no general or necessary rule: but they sometimes declare what
was done, and what may be done extraordinarily, upon like occasion, and the

Women were the first that preached Christ's resurrection: A woman was the

Now, if the speech be a true messenger of the heart, I perceive master
Doctor is of (...).
this mind, that he would have women preach in the Church of England at this
time: for he cannot deny, and he also confesses it sometimes that this is the
time of necessity: and indeed it must be needs an extreme necessity, that
drives to make one man Pastor of two churches, especially so far distant,
that drives to make men, which are not able to teach, ministers, and diverse
more things, which are contrary to the word of God: Therefore this being a time
of necessity, by M. Doctors judgment we ought to have women to preach.
Besides this he says if neither none other can or will preach, that then women
may preach, but in the most churches of this realm, there is none that either
can or will preach, therefore there, and in those churches, women (at the
least if they be able) may preach the Gospel, and consequently minister the
sacraments.

Io. Whitgifte.
You wander from the matter and do but seek occasion to quarrel: there is no
such necessity in this Church (God be thanked) as M. Doctor speaks of: for
there is none in any place or corner thereof, that be ignorante of Christ, or
do not profess the name of Christ: In all places they have the scriptures red
unto them, which contain matter sufficient to salvation, and therefore there
is no cause why women should take upon them to preach in the congregation:
neither does M. Doctor mean any such thing, as you know very well, but that it
is your pleasure to dally. He means In what time a woman may preach Christ.

Admonition.
Women that may 1. Co. 14. 34 1. Tim. 2. 11
not speak in a congregation, may yet in time of necessity minister the
Sacrament of Baptism, and that in a private house.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 186. Sect. vlt.
You say, women that may not speak in a congregation, may yet in time of
necessity, minister the sacrament of baptism, and that in a private house.
And to prove that women may not speak in a congregation, you quote. 1. Cor.
14. 1. Ti. 2. whereas you should rather have proved, that women may not in time
of necessity, minister baptism, for that is the question, and not the other.
Women may speak in the congregation, if necessary occasion do require, as M.
Calvin teaches in his institutions. Chap. 13. Sect. 32.

T. C. Page 110. Sect. 3.
In the. 187. Page, he cites M. Calvin in the. 13. Chap. Section. 32. to
prove that women may teach: wherein An argument of your ignorance.
I marvel, what he means, so to allege M. Calvin continually: he
alleges the. 13. Chap. and no book, as though he had written but one book,
and indeed there is no such thing, in no such chapter of any book of his
institutions, or many other place throughout his whole works, as I am
persuaded. If this fault had bin but twice or thrice, I would have thought it
had bin the Printers, but now that it is continual, and so oftentimes, surely
he gives great suspicion that either some body, has mocked him with these
places, or else he would abuse others, and especially him that should answer
his book, setting him to seek that he should never find.

Io. Whitgifte.
You plead ignorance, of such an edition of M. Caluines institutions, but it
is because you cannot answer the place (for other places which I have in like
manner alleged, for the which you might have any color of answering, you have
found out at the first: yea and this self same place now in question) but when
there is no shifte to avoid that which is alleged, then you quarrel with the
book, and suspect, that either Page 19. Sect.. ^
some body has mocked him, or that he would abuse others. etc. No, no, T. C. I
thank god I use no such dealing, I do allege nothing which I have not red in
the Authors themselves. I study not to encounter the Answer, for either I set
down the whole place, or else quote it so, that it may easily be found.
Touching this book of institutions of M. Caluines, which I now follow, I have
spoken before, and declared why I do use it rather than any other: I have
labored it, noted it, I am acquainted with it, and belike, I red it, before
you knew whether there was any such book or no: and if there be no such book
of M. Caluines institutions, only divided into chapters and sections, and not
into books, I will give you all M. Caluines works, because you so complain of
lack of books.

But to come to the thing it self, M. Calvin in that place speaking of such
laws and orders in the Church, as are not perpetual but alterable, as
occasion serves, uses this commandment of S. Paul's touching the silence of
women in the Church, for one example to make the matter more manifest: his
words be these. Or is the commandment touching her silence such, as it may
not be broken without wickedness? Chap. 1^. Sect. 32.
And alittle after. Et est, vbi loqui no^ minus opportunum illi sit, quam alibi
tacere, And there is a time and place, when and where it is as fit for her to
speak, as else where to hold ^ir peace. These words be plain, and do
sufficiently answer all, that you can object to the contrary.

Chap. 3. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page 110. Sect. 4.
As for M. Caluines judgment what it is of women's preaching, it may appear by
that he 4. Li. institut. cap. 15. Sect. 20.
will not by no means, no not in time of necessity (as they term it) suffer
either woman, or any lay man to baptize, or minister any sacrament, and
therefore not to preach.

Io. Whitgifte.
I doubt not of M. Caluines judgment in that point, and yet I know other
learned and notable men that think otherwise, and namely Zuinglius in his
book de baptismo, neither do I go about to teach that women may preach. I tell
you only what extreme necessity may extraordinarily permit, without just
cause of reprehension.

Chap. 3. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page 110. Sect. vlt.
And as for the examples of Mary the sister of Moses, of Olda, of Anna, and
the daughters of Philip the Evangelist, which are all called prophetesses (tor
I think M. Doctor means these examples) as for them I say, it will be hard
for to show that they ever prophesied or taught openly in any public me^ng or
congregation. But the surer answer is, that although the Lord do sometimes,
not being under any law, change the order which he has set, in raising up
certain women, partly to the shame of men and to humble them, partly to let
them understand that he can if he would, want their ministry: yet it is not
lawful for us to draw that into example and to follow it: or that for as much
as he breaks the law which is not subject unto it, and which he made not for
himself, that therefore we may break the law whereunto we be subject and to
whom it is given. But we must go in the broad high way of the commandment,
and of the ordinary usage of God, in governing his Church, and not in the
byepath of certain singular examples, which have bin in dtuers ages. And as
often as God has used this extraordinary means of the ministry of women,
so often also has he confirmed their calling either by miracle, or some
wonderful issue, or with some other singular note and mark, whereby he has
made their calling otherwise strange and monstrous, most certain and undoubted
to all men.

Io. Whitgifte.
There be other examples also besides these, and yet these be sufficient to
prove any thing that I have spoken touching this matter: he that well
co^sidereth what is written of Mary the Sister of Moses. Number. 12. or of Olda.
2. Reg. 22. will not doubt whether they spoke openly in the congregation or
no: but you will not stick upon this point. And in your second answer I
agree with you in this, that we must make no general rule of these particular
examples: and that women may not presume to preach in the congregation, except
they be extraordinarily called thereunto, and have certain and sure signs of
their calling. And surely I muse what you mean to spend so much labor about
this matter, wherein there is no controversy. I might say unto you, as it
has pleased you to say unto me, that you have some old rusty notes which you
would gladly utter, and you know not how otherwise to make merchandise of them,
than by picking such a quarrel to utter them.

T. C. Page 111. Sect. 1.
There is a greater difficulty than M. Doctor mentions in the words of S.
Paul, where 1. Cor. II.
he says, a ^ oman praying or prophesing ought to be vayled, and have her head
covered, in which words it seems that the Apostle licenceth a woman to
prophecy, so that she do it, with her head covered, but to him that shall
diligently consider the place, it shall appear that the women of Corinth, did
pass the bounds of modesty and of shamefastness, two ways, whereof one was
that they came into the congregation contrary to the custom of those countries
with their heads and faces uncovered: another was, that they also took upon
them to speak in the congregation, both which faults S. Paul condemned, but
in their several and proper places. Although therefore speaking against the
abuse of uncovering their head, he does not condemn their boldness in
teaching, yet he did not therefore approve it, the confutation whereof he
reserved to a more commodious place.

Io. Whitgifte.
To what end bring you in this saying of S. Paul? I do not remember that I
have at any time used it, for any proof: and yet you have objected more than
you can well answer: Howbeit, because it pertains not to improve any thing
that I affirm, I will not examine your answer (and yet not yours but M.
Caluins) nor trouble the Reader with frivolous and vain digressions.

If women do baptize, they baptize in private houses not in the congregation.

Surely you are able to mar a good matter for lack of skillful handling.

T. C. Page 111. Sect. 12.
But says he if women do baptize it is in private houses. I have showed before
that they may not baptize at all, therefore not in private houses: besides that
that I have in the Reply unto the section in the one and twenty page showed,
how it is not lawful, neither to preach the word, nor to minister the
sacraments in private corners.

Io. Whitgifte.
I answer to their argument, and go not about to confirm the baptising by
women. I say this argument follows not. Saint Paul forbids them to
speak in the congregation. Ergo they may not baptize, for they baptize in
private houses, not in public places, and Saint Paul does bid them to
speak in private places. Whatsoever yon have replied unto, I have there
answered where you have replied: and it is manifest that both the word may be
preached, and the sacraments ministered in private places, upon just occasion.

Chap. 3. the. 10. Division.
T. C. Page 111. Sect. 2. 3. 4.
For the which matter of not ministering the sacraments in private houses, to
the Authors of the Admonition, citing the cleuenth Chapter of the first
epistle unto the Corinthtans. M. Doctor answers, that he reproves the
profanation of the supper, by banqueting, and contempt of their brethren, and
exhorts to tarry one for another.

But what is this to the purpose? we ask not M. Doctor the interpretation of
this place, as we do not of all the rest which he interprets, where there is
no occasion in the world to interpret The places be interpreted to show how
far out of square they be alleged in the Admonition
them, being of themselves very clear, and the interpretation which is brought
never almost making any thing for the solution of that which is objected: which
I desire the Reader to mark throughout his whole book. For what if S. Paul
reprove the profanation of the supper of the Lord, does it follow therefore
that he does not give to understand, that the sacrament should be administered
in a common assembly? What if he exhort to tarry one for another, therefore
does he not dehort from celebrating of the sacrament in a private house?

And surely me think you cannot be so ignoraunte as you make your self, that
you should not understand their argument, and therefore I think you do
rather dissemble it, as you do in diverse other places: for all men may easily
perceive, that as Saint Paul opposes the supper of the Lord, to the common
supper: his banquet to the common banquet: so he opposes there manifestly, the
Church and congregation unto the private house: and declares that as the
common supper or banquet, ought to be kept at their houses, so the Lords
supper, and his banquet, ought to be celebrated in the congregation.

Io. Whitgifte.
I think indeed that M. Doctors interpretations, trouble you shrewdly: for
they detect much of your vanity, and make manifest the lack of discretion and
learning in the authors of the Admonition. I say lack of discretion and
learning, for otherwise to evidently and so often to abuse the scriptures were
great dishonestie or rather impiety. If I have missed in interpreting, or
wrongfully accused them, why do not you make it known as occasion is offered
It stands you upon, for it is much to your dishonestie, and a great discredit
to your whole cause.

Touching this place of S. Paul. 1. Cor. 11. I say. as I said before: and I
add, that he only reproves such abuses as were used among them in their
public assemblies, he speaks not of celebrating the communion in private
places.

S. Paul makes no such opposition in that place as you speak of, neither
does he speak any thing sounding that way, only he reproves the abuse which
was the^ crept into the supper of the Lord, among the Corinthians, Quod sacro
and spirituali epulo profana symposia permiscerent, idque cum pauperum
contumelia, In that they mingled profane Call. in. 1. Co. 11
banquetts with that holy and spiritual feast, and that with the contumely of
the poor, as M* Calvin says. Wherefore it appears that either you are
disposed to make good whatsoever they have written be it never so absure, or
else you wittingly dissemble the true sense and meaning of this place.

You say in your margent, that Uictor Anno. 198. did first appoint that women

any time in any place, whether it be in the sea, or in a river, or in a pond,

Mark, and. 1. Cor. II. which places of scripture prove, that John did baptize
openly, and that the Lords Supper was ministered in the public congregation,
but neither of them both conclude, that these Sacraments may not also be
ministered upon any occasion in private houses: for what sequel is there in
this reason, all the c^ untrey of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, went out unto

baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins: Ergo baptism
may not be ministered upon any occasion in private houses? you may as well
conclude, that none ought to be baptized but in the river of Jordan, and none
but such as be able to confess their sins, and so you should seclude
children from Baptism, as the Anabaptists do.

T. C. Page. 111. Sect. vlt.
To the admonition obiecting in the nintie and two page, that John baptized
openly, amongst the congregation, he answers and says, that it may be as
well concluded, that we should baptize only in the river of Iordane, and none
but those that be of age, by which saying he gives to understand Nay I give
you to (...) the fondness of the argument.
that to baptize in the Church, has no greater necessity, than ye baptizing
in Jordan, nor it skilleth no more, whether baptism be ministered in the
public assembly, than it is necessatie or skilleth, whether we be baptized in
the river of Jordan, and that the baptism of young infants has no better
grounds than private baptism has. The latter whereof, (both being absurd) is
tootoo (...) unto the baptism of young infantes. For as of our Savior Christ's
preaching in public places, and refusyng private places, we do gather that
the preaching of the word, ought to be public. Even so of S. John's preaching
and baptizing in open meetings, we conclude that both preaching and baptizing,
ought to be in public assemblies.

Io. Whitgifte.
I refer it to the learned Reader to judge whether this be a good argument
or no: John baptized openly in the River Jordan, Ergo baptism^ may at no time
upon any occasion be ministered in a private house. And if any will judge it to
be good, the^ will I demand of them, why this should not be as good: John did
baptize in Iordane: Ergo, none ought to be baptized but in the river Iordane.
Or this. John baptized such as confessed their sins, Ergo none must be
baptized, but such as are able to make a confession of their sins. This is
that unskillful kinte of reasoning, that Zuinglius so often reproves the
Anabaptists for, and he calls it an argument a facto ad ius. I do not in
any respect speak against baptizing in the Church, but do greatly
commend it, as a thing most conueniente: but I do not so tie the Sacrament
to the place, or public congregation, that I make it of the necessity of the
Sacrament, so that it may not upon any occasion be ministered in a private
house. I compare not baptizing in the Church, and in the river Iordane
together: neither do I say that baptizing of young infantes has no better
grounds than private baptism has: but I disallowe this kind of proof,
which the A^monition uses: and I see not why it is not of like force in all
other the circumstances of that place, and those examples that I have alleged.

Christ preached both privately and publicly: in the temple, and in private
families: in great assemblies, and severally to his own disciples, and at all
times as occasion served: and therefore you can not conclude by the example of
Christ, that the preaching of the Gospel, ought only to be public in the open
congregation, and at no time private upon any occasion.

And although to some one action there concur diverse things, which partly are

whose authority he would be loath to reiecte I am sure, least he should lose
the opinion of his studiousnesse of the old writers, which he hunteth so
diligently after in this book, and whereof he makes the authors of the
Admonition so great contemners. And it is not hard to show the same in twenty
places more, as in the tenth of S. Math. and S. Luke, where as there are diverse
things not to be followed of the ministers now, other things indifferent to be
followed, so are there also other things that be as well commanded to all the
ministers that now are, as they were then either to the. 12. or. 70. disciples.

Io. Whitgifte.
And of those circumstances whereof there is no comm^aundement, how prove you
which be indifferent, which be unlawful or not convenient to be followed,
which necessary? why is it not as necessary by this example of John, that they
should be baptized in Ioroane, or that they should confess their sins,
before they be baptized, as it is that they should be publicly baptized? If
you take upon you to interpret without authority and ground ofscripture, it
is meet that you should show very good and substanciall reason. I demand
the like touching the places alleged out of the Acts, where you reteyn what
you list, refuse what you list, alter as you list, as though you were lord
over the Scripture, and had omnia iura tam diuina quam humana in scrinio
pectoris, all laws as well divine as humane in the coffer of your breast, like
to the Pope. But to these places of the Acts I have answered in their due
place. Your s^ffes make not your cause one whit the better.

Of twenty places you recite not one: And of diverse things some indifferent,
some not to be followed, other some commanded to all ministers spoken to the
twelve or scuentie disciples in the. 10. of Matthew and Luke you name none:
speaking without ground or reason is but prattling. I know that in one action
there be diverse circumstances, of diverse conditions and natures, but if any of
them be necessary at all times to be obseiued, the Necessary cir cumsta^ces
are commanded.
same is contained in some commandment in the Scriptures, and therefore well
says Zuinglius that an argument a facto ad ius, is then strong, when as we are
able to show, that that which is done, is done according to some rule or
commandment. Now if you can show me either rule or commandment in
scripture, that upon no occasion we may preach or baptize in private
families, I yield unto you. What examples do prove without commandment.
But if you can not this do, your examples prove what was then done, and what
in the like cause may be done now, but they make not any general and
perpetual rule.

Now touching these and such like circumstances in my opinion, M, Zuinglius
in his book de baptismo, makes a full resolution, which may satisfye any
reasonable Zuinglius.
man. His words be these: There is here three errors about circumstances,
that is, the elements of the world. The first is of the time, for they
thought that baptism was not rightly administered, except it were in the first
day: for the time is of no great weight, so that we take diligent heed of
this, that none rashly or negligently differ it, longer than is convenient,
for by this occasion, it may come to pass, that the baptism of children might
be taken away. An other error is touching the circumstance of the person: for
they thought that baptism could not be administered of no other than of a
priest: when as notwithstanding every man may minister it, even a woman, if
necessity require: the third error is in the circumstance of the place,
because it is not necessary that the insant should only be baptized in the
Church.

Baptism was ministered in Cornelius house, Acts. 10. The place is not of the

To the. 1. Cor. II. it is answered before. Surely this church of England

does not permit the sacraments to be ministered in private places, except
there be a congregation, and then not usually, but only in certain cases.

T. C. Page 112. Sect. 1.
An other reason he adds there, that S. Peter baptized in Cornelius house.
But M. Doctor makes not the best choice of his arguments. For S. Paul's
baptizing in the house of the Iayler, had been more fit for him, for unto his
place it may be easyly answered, that Cornelius having so great a family, as
it is like he had, and besides that diverse soldiers underneath him, and
further his friends and his acquayntance which he had called, had a competente
number, and as many as would make a congregation, and as could co^mmodiously be
preached unto in one place. But the answer to both these examples, and other
such like, as that S. Paul baptized in the house of Stephana is easy. For
there being persecutions at that time, so that it was not safe neither for the
minister nor for the people to be seen, it was meet that they should do it
in houses, which otherwise they would have done in open places: and then those
houses which receive the congregation, are not as I have showed for the time
to be counted private houses: and further in places where the gospel has not
been received, nor no church gathered, but one only householde, embracing the
Gospel, I say in such a case, and especially in the time of persecution, where
should the Ministers preach, or minister the Sacraments, more conveniently
than in that house where those professors of the gospel be? now to draw
this into our churches, which may safely come into open places, and where the
church and congregation stands of diverse houscholdes, is a token of great
want of judgment, in shuffelyng those things together, which for the great
diversity of their natures will not be myngled.

Io. Whitgifte.
The example of Peter's baptizing in Cornelius house, is sufficient to prove
that then it was lawful to baptize in private families: the example of Paul
baptizyng the iaylour and his family, proves the same: But it ministers a
more ready answer to a quareller, because Paul then being prisoner, had not
such liberty to make cheise of his place, as Peter had. But they are both
very fit examples for my purpose, the bigness of Cornelius family or the
smalnesse, is not material to this question, for we speak of the place, not
of the persons. And whereas you say, that in Cornelius house, there was a
competent number, and as many as would make a congregation, I answer that so it
is with us when baptism is ministered in private families: for wheresoever
Math. 18,
two or three be gathered together in the name of Christ, there is a
congregation.

To your second answer of the difference of time, because that was in time of
persecution. etc. I say that as persecution was then a cause why baptism ^ as
usually mistred in private houses, so necessity is now yt cause, why the same
is ministered some times in private families. Neither do I mayntein or allow
the administering of the sacraments in private families, to be usual or without
urgent cause, but only upon extreme necessity of sickness, peril of death and

sacraments in such places, so are not you able to show, either scripture,
doctor or reason to yt contrary, and whatsoever you say of ye tune of
persecution touching ye matter, yt same may be said of the time of necessity
also. But here I would have the Reader to note, yt you are now driven to
confess a difference in the Church betwixt the time of persecution, and the
time of prosperity, and that to be convenient in the one, which is not
convenient for the other: which distinction and diversity of times, you would
not before acknowledge to make any difference in the election of ministers, and
government of the Church, and yet the case is all one.

example of the Apostles themselves, who did minister the supper in private
houses, especially if that place be understood of the supper, which is in

And in the page. 152. he brings other reasons to prove that the Sacraments
may be ministered in a private house, whereof the first is, that our Savior
Christ celebrated his Supper in a private house, and in an inner parlour, the
reason whereof is easyly to be known, for the law of God ordained, that every
householder in his house should eat the passover with his own family. If it
were so great, as that they might well eat up a whole lamb.

Io. Whitgifte.
That is a reason why Christ did eat the passover in a private house: but it
is no reason why he did celebrate his Supper there in like manner. Wherefore my
reason holds as yet.

Chap. 4. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 112. Sect. 3.
Our savior Christ therefore with his household, observes this law, and for
because he would declare, that the passover had his end, and that his holy
Sacrament should come in place thereof, he does forthwith celebrate his supper
in the same place, which if he had not done, neither could he have done it at
al, the hour of his apprehension then approaching, neither should it so lively
have appeared, that either the passover was abolished, or that the Supper came
in place of it, being celebrated both at an other time, and in an other place.

Io. Whitgifte.
Our Savior Christ's example of instituting and ministering his supper in a
private family, giving afterward no commandment to the contrary, is a
manifest proof that the place is not of the substance of the sacrament, and
that upon occasion it may be ministered in a private house. You show a reason

For the celebrating of the Supper in houses in the Apostles times, and in
Justinius and Tertullians times, which were times of persecution, I have spoken
before, where also I declared, that such houses for the time are not private
but public.

Io. Whitgifte.
This answer is as fit for me, as it is for you, for admit that the
Sacraments may be administered in private families in the case of necessity,
and I ask no m^^^. For if persecution be a necessary cause, why is not
sickness and peril of d^^th so in like manner? again, if a private house be
no private but a public place, when for the fear of persecution the
Sacraments be ministered in it, why is it not so likewise, when they be there
ministered for extremity of sickness and fear of death the reason is all
one, and the case of necessity like: and therefore you have not said any thing
against me, but with me.

the which I might add, that circumcision was celebrated in private families,

He has certain other Untruth, for I use no reasons to that end.
to prove that women may baptize, whereof the first is in the. 93. page, and
that is that Sephora Moses wife, circumcised her child, whereunto I have
answered partly before, that particular examples especially contrary, to
general rules, are not to be followed, and will further answer if I first
admonish the Reader, whereupon this baptism of midwiues, and in private houses
rose, that when we know of how rotten a stock it came, the fruit it self may
be more loathsome unto us. It first therefore rose upon a false interpretation
of the place of S. John. V nlesse a man be borne again of water and of the
spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. 3. John.
Where certain do interpret the word water, for the material and elementall
water, wherewith men are washed, when as our savior Christ takes water
there, by a translation or borrowed speech, for the spirit of God, the effect
whereof it shadoweth out. For even as in another place by the fire and spirit,
he means nothing but the spirit of God, which purges and purifyeth as the 3.
Math.
fire does: so in this place, by the water and the spirit, he means nothing
else but the spirit of God, which cleanses the filth of sin, and cools the
broyling heat of an unquiet conscience, as water washes the thing which is
foul, and quenches the heat of the fire. Secondarily, this error came by a
false and unnecessary conclusion drawn of that place. For although the
scripture should say, that none can be saved, but those which have the spirit
of God, and are baptized with material and elementall water, yet ought it to
be understood of those which can conveniently and orderly be brought to
baptism, as the Scripture saying, that who so does not believe the gospel, is
John. 3.
already condemned, means this sentence of those which can hear the gospel,
and have discretion to understand it, when they hear it, and cannot here shut
under this condemnation, either those that be borne deaf, and so remain, or
little infants, or natural fools that have no wit to conceive what is
preached.

And hereupon S. Augustine concludes, that all not baptized are condemned,
which is as absurdly 106. Epist. ad Bonifac. in lib. de meritis and remissi.
pec^ cat. 1. ca. ^4
concluded of him, as that of our savior Christ's words: except one eat the
flesh of the son of man, he has not life, he concludes, that whatsoever he
be which receives not the Sacrament of the Supper, is damned.

Upon this false conclusion of S. Augustine, has risen this profanation of
the sacrament of baptism, in being ministered in private houses, and by women
or lay men, as also upon his other absurd conclusion, sprung a horrible abuse
of the Lords supper, whilst they did thrust the bread and wine, into young
infantes mouths, for that men were persuaded, that otherwise if their
children should die, before they were baptized, or had received the supper,
that they were damned for ever. And what better token can there be, that this
was the cause of this blind baptism, than that the Papists, from whom this
baptism by women is translated, were of the same judgment, and for that cause
brought in their baptism by women. Hereunto may be added another cause, which
is, that as (when the Church began not only to decline, but to fall away from
the sincerity of religion) it borrowed a number of other prophanations of the
heathen: so also it borrowed this. For as the heathen had women priests, so it
would have also her women priests, and Li. 3. ca. 9.
that this was another occasion of bringing in the baptism by women, it
appears by your Clement, if he can speak any truth.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is untrue that I use any reasons at all to prove, that women may baptize:
only I bring this and such like examples to improve this general assertion of
the Admonition, that then sacraments were ministrred by ministers only, and not
by midwiues or deacons. For Deaco^s then did baptize, and Moses wife long
before that time did circumcise. I know that particular examples make no
general rules: but you are not ignorant that Particular examples may sometimes
be followed.
particular examples may in the like cases and circumstances be followed, when
there is no rule to the contrary.

The place in the. 3. of John by you alleged has diverse interpretations, and
the most part of the ancient writers, do take water in that place, for
material and elementall water: as Augustine, Chrysostom, Ambrose, Cyrill, and
sundry others, even as Chr. in. 3. Io. 3. lib. de spirit. sanct. lib. 2. de
Abrabam patriar. Cyri. in. 3. Io.
many of the ancient fathers, as I have red upon that text. But because I do
mislike as much as you the opinion of those that think infants to be
condemned, which are not baptized, therefore I will not contend with you,
either in the interpretation of that place, or in any other thing that you
have spoken touching this error: only this I say, that you must take heed,
least in avoiding an error, you fall into an heresy, and give place to
Anabaptists, in not baptising infants. And I know not what you can say
against private baptism, in that case of necessity, which they do not in
like manner allege against the baptising of young Infantes. Master Calvin in
his Introduction Aduersus Anabap. though he allow not this error, which
condemns children not baptized, yet does he approve and allow the necessity
of baptizing infantes: His words be these. But some man will say, that the
grace of God toward us, is not diminished Calvin ^uers (...).
if infantes be not admitted to Baptism, so that it be not denied, that God is
as merciful unto them as unto the children of the Jews, but I will show that
it is much diminished: for we must esteem the grace of God, especially by the
declaration thereof which he makes both by his word and Sacraments. Seeing
therefore Baptism is now ordained, that the promise of salvation may be
sealed in our bodies, as it was in times past in the people of the Jews:
Christians should be deprived of a singular consolation, if their children
should be secluded from this confirmation, which all the faithful have at all
times enjoyed, that they should have the visible sign, whereby the Lord does
show and witness that he receives their children into the Communion and
fellowship of the Church.

If the Authors of the Admonition say truly, that Victor who lived Anno. 198.
did first appoint that women might Baptize, then came it neither from the
Papists, nor yet from the Gentiles. But whenever this began, or from whom
soever it was taken, the baptizing of infantes has always been thought
necessary in the Church, by all such, as have not divided themselves by any
Schism or Heresy from the same.

would have midwiues baptize in the presence of the Bishop, or the minister,

of the fore skin of the Infant not of mind to obey the commandment of
God, or for the salvation of the child, but in a choler only, to the end
that her husband might be eased, and have release: which mind appears in
her, both by her words, and by casting away in anger, the foreskinne which
she had cut of. And if it be said, that the event declared that the act
pleased God, because that Moses forthwith waxed better and was recovered of his
sickness, I have showed before, how if we measure things by the event, we
shall oftentimes justify the wicked, and take the righteousness of the
rightuous from them.

In the. 170. Page of your book, you say that God took the Priesthode from
Moses, Page 170. Sect. 1.
and gave it to Aaron, and now you seem to affirm the contrary in saying,
that Moses was a Prophet of the Lord, to whom that office of circumcision
did apperteyne, for hereby you do insinuate that Moses was a Priest. Moreover,
Moses at this time was extreemely sick, and therefore could not execute that
office himself? And in the Geneua Bible, there is this note: that it was
extraordinary, for Moses was sore sick, and God even then required it.
Sephora therefore did circumcise in a point of extremity Baptism true though

The event does oftentimes declare the thing, Exitus acta probat, though not
necessarily: but this is certain that these euentes are better reasons to
justify the fact, than you can she we any out of that place to the contrary.

An other reason he has which is, that the dignity of the sacraments does
not depend upon the man, whether he be minister or no minister, good or evil.

the being of the Sacrament, so that I take the baptism of women, to be no more
the holy Sacrament of baptism, than I take any other daily or ordinary
washing of the child, neither let any man think that I have at unawares
slipped into this asseueration, or that I have forgotten, that soon after the
times of the Apostles, it was the use of certain Churches, that Deacons
should baptize in the time of necessity (as they call it) for as for the
Baptism of Deacons, I hold it to be lawful, for because although (as it is
with us) they give him the name of Deacon, Urge hoc etc.
yet in deed he is as he then was in the elder times a minister, and not a
Deacon. And although he did then provide for the poor, and so had two
functions (which was not meet) yet his office ought to be esteemed, of the
principal part of his function, which was preaching and ministering of the
Sacraments, in certain cases. And as for the baptising by lay men,
considering that it is not only against the word of God, but also founded
upon a false ground, and upon an imagined necessity (which is none in deed)
it moves me nothing at all, although it be very ancient, for so much as the
substance of the Sacrament depends chiefly of the institution and word of
God, which is the form, and as it were the life of the sacrament, of which
institution this is one, and of the chief parts, that it should be celebrated
by a minister.

of Christians, which were never baptized: for besides diverse that have been
baptized by women, some there are, and not a few, that have been baptized by
such as have taken upon them the ministry, not being thereunto either

proved himself to be no Christian.

And surely if you peruse all the writings of the ancient Fathers, and of the

proposition affirmed, for although diverse, both old and new, do not allow
that Lay men should be suffered to baptize, yet is there none of them (such

sacrament so to depend upon the minister, that Baptism by lay men. Tertull.

it is no sacrament if it be not celebrated by a minister. Tertull. in his
book De Baptismo says, That lay men may Baptize. Ambrose in the. 4. ad

Jerome, ad Luciferianos affirms, that it is lawful for Lay men to Baptize
if necessity do require. And hereunto also does S. Augustine agree, in his 2.
Book, against the Epistle of Parmenian, the. 13. Chapter. M. Zuinglius in the
place before by me alleged: VVriteth that the second error in the
circumstances of Baptism is about the person, because they think that
Baptism can not be given of any but of a Priest only, whereas if necessity
do require any man may do it. And a little after he says, That this and such
like circumstances are not De ipsa Baptismi essentia, Not of the being of the
Sacrament. Which is directly contrary to your assertion. M. Calvin also in
his Institutions Cap. 17. Sect. 16. does sufficiently Calvin.
confute this error in these words: Now if it be true that we have set
down, the Sacrament is not to be esteemed of his hand, by whom it is
ministered, but as it were of the hand of God, from whom it certaynely
comes: hereof we may gather, that nothing is added or taken from the dignity
of it, by him by whom it is ministered. And therefore among men if an Epistle
be sent, so that the hand and seal be known, it skilleth not who or what
manner of person caryeth it: even so it is sufficient for us, to know the
hand and seal of the Lord in his Sacraments, by whomesoeuer they be
delivered. Hereby is the error of the Donatistes confuted, who measured the
virtue and woorthynesse of the Sacrament by the worthynesse of the minister.
Such be now a days our Anabaptists, which deny us to be rightly baptized,
because we were baptized by wicked and idolatrous persons in the Popos Church.
And therefore they furiously urge rebaptisation: against whose folly we shall
sufficiently be defended, if we think that we were baptized not in the name of
any man, but in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost,
and therefore baptism not to be of man but of God, by whom soever it be
ministered. Haec Caluinus.

Undoubtedly if this your assertion were true there had need be some general
rebaptisation throughout all Christendom, as well of men as of children, for
certain it is, that that Sacrament has been ministered to many by such, as be
in no degree of the ministry.

Your opinion of a Deacon, that he should nothing differ from a minister, is
very strange, and unheard of in any writer old or new. Show any author, any
example, any Scripture, that proves or allows it: Diaconus and Presbyter or
Sacerdos be distinct in all Authors. But I know wherefore this is affirmed of
you, even to stop a gappe, but it will not serve. I will say no more: the
opinion is very absurd and unlearned, contrary to the Scriptures, and all
learned Authors. Neither do you show any reason of your Paradoxe, which you
ought to do, seeing it is Contra opinionem omnium, contrary to all men's
opinions, not one excepted.

Against baptising by lay men in time of necessity you have no Scripture. But
Baptism by Lay men not condemned us Scripture.
for the allowing of it, you have the authority of learned men, even such as
were far from the opinion of Augustine in condemning infantes not baptized,
as namely Zuinglius, who also in the place before recited, sufficiently
answered, whatsoever is here by you barely without any kind of proof set
down.

You have also examples thereof in Ecclesiastical histories, Socrates Lib. 1.
cap. Examples of baptism by lay men.
14. and Sozom. lib. 2. cap. 17. write: That Alexander Bishop of Alexandria

but a child, to certain other children, to be true baptism, and not to be
itterated, because Sozomen.
after examination he was found to have used the words, and right form of
baptism. ^hanasius being a child baptized.
Whereby it is plain, that the opinion of the Church at that time was, the
minister not to be of the substance or being of baptism. There is recited a
story in the Centuries, Cent. 2. cap. 6.
of a Jew baptized in the case of necessity by Lay men, and with sand,
because there was no water. Afterward the Bishop of Alexandria being demanded
of the matter, De sententia Ecclesiae respondit, baptizatum esse Iudaeum si
modo aqua denuo perfunderetur, He answered by the judgment of the Church,
that the Jew was baptized, if so be he were again sprinkled with water. This
argues that the Church then made no doubt in the respect of the persons that
ministered this Baptism, but only because there lacked water. This story is
cited out of Nicephorus lib. 3. cap. 37. and alleged by the Authors of the
Centuries, to prove the simplicity of the Church at that time, about
Baptism, neither do they in any respect show any misliking of it. And surely
I know not wherein this opinion of yours does differ from the Donatistes, or
Anabaptists, except it be in this, that you speak of Lay men, and they of
Ministers.

And whereas you say, that the minister is one of the chief parts, and as it

been well if you had used some authority of Scripture or testimony of learned

and of the holy Ghost, which form being observed, the Sacrament remains in
full force and strength of whom soever it be ministered, or howsoever by
Ceremonies or other additio^s it is corrupted. This I am sure is the answer of
Zuinglius, both in his book De Baptismo, and in his Elench. contra Anabap. to
the Anabaptists, who would have them all to be rebaptised that have been
baptized in the Popes Church. And the same is the opinion of M. Calvin in the
place before recited, and of all other learned men that I have read.

And certaynely if the boyng of the Sacrament depended upon man in any respect,

we were but in a miserable case, for we should be always in doubt whether
we were rightly baptized or no: but it is most true, that the force and
strength of the Sacrament, is not in the man be he minister or not minister, be
he good or evil, but in God himself, in his spirit, in his free and
effectual operation. And therefore says S. Paul, What is Paul, what is
Apollo, etc. This I speak not to bring co^fusio^ into the Church (for as I
said before, let men take heed that they usurp not an office, whereunto they
be not called, for God will call them to an account for so doing) but to teach
a truth, to take a yoke of doubtfulnesse from men's consciences, and to resist
an error, not much differing from Donatisme and Anabaptisme.

For although part of the institution, in that the name of the holy Trinity is
called upon, be observed: yet if the whole institution be not, it is no more a
Sacrament, than the Papists communion was, which celebrating it in one kind,
took a part of the institution, and left the other.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you can show as manifest Scripture that the minister is of the substance of
Baptism, as I can do that the cup is one of the essential parts of the
supper, then it is something that you say: but if there be no likelyhode
betwixt the one and the other, than can you not want just reprehension, for so
confidently auouching that which you cannot prove.

The distribution of the cup in the Lords supper, is commanded in manifest
and express words as a part of the Supper, but you cannot show me the like
commandment that only a minister shall celebrate Baptism, or else that it is
no Baptism. We know that circumcision, the figure of Baptism, was ministered
sometimes by such as were no Priests: and yet right and true circumcision.

S. (...) in that 10. chapt. to the Romans speaks of the extraordinary calling
to the office of preaching, so says M. Martyr in his Commentaries, upon this
place. Martyr.
And although Paul entreats in this place of calling, and sending, and this
is as I said ordinary and extraordinary: there is no doubt but that he now
speaks of the extraordinary calling, etc. And M. Calvin likewise upon the
same place says, that Paul Calvin.
does not there speak, De legitima cuius que vocatione, of the lawful calling
of every man. Wherefore if you will ground any such reason upon this place, it
must be thus: S. Paul says that a man cannot preach which is not sent, and
he means of an extraordinary sending, therefore no man may preach unless he
be extraordinarily called thereunto: and so consequently not minister baptism,
except he be called in like manner. If you will reason thus, then do you
confirm the baptizing by lay men, who do it not ordinarily but
extraordinarily upon necessity.

S. Paul does not say, that a man cannot preach which is not sent, no not

speaks the words of the scripture, and interpret them. These words be so
added by you, that the simple and ignorant, may think they be the words of
S. Paul. He that speaks the words of the scripture, and does interpret
them, preaches, though he be not there unto called, and it is the true word
of God he preaches, if he truly interpret, but he intrudeth himself into a
vocation where unto he is not called, and therefore Usurpers both in preaching
and ministering the Sacraments offend God.
offends God: but that does derogate nothing from the word preached. The
same reason is of the administration of the Sacraments, for as the word of
God, is the word of God, by whom so ever it be preached minister or other: so
is the Sacrament of Baptism, true baptism by whom soever it be celebrated:
the usurper of the office has to answer for his intrusion, but the Sacrament
is not thereby defiled.

It is no hard matter to show that in the primitive Church, lay men were
suff^d Lay men su^fred to preach. Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 20.
to preach: you know that Eusebius. says that Origene being a lay man was sent
into Arabia to preach the Gospel which he also did, both before and after in
the Church of Alexandria, and likewise in Cesarea. And although Demetrius then
Bishop of Alexandria, found fault that Origene being a lay man should
preach in the presence of Bishops at Cesarea. Yet is it manifest that he
allowed lay men to preach, if Bishops were not present. And in the same chapt.
by diverse examples it is showed (as of Euelpis at Laranda, of Paulinus at
Iconium, of Theodorus at Synada) that the custom of the Churches both then and
before that time was, that lay men might preach even in the presence of
Bishops, so that you have erred both in applying the place of S. Paul, and in
saying that lay men may not preach the word upon occasion, and so
consequently Baptize.

effectual, and yet I think that M. Doctor will not say, that therefore an
heretical minister may baptize, and that it is lawful for Herctikes to
baptize in the Church. And therefore men must not only take heed (as M. Doctor
says) that they usurp not, that which they are not called unto, but they must
also take heed, that they receive not functions and charges upon them, whereof
they are not capable, although they be thereunto called.

Io. Whitgifte.
There are mo difficulties in this question than you can well determine: and
therefore it had been best, either not to have spoken of it at all, or else to
have handled it more substantially: but the scarcity of matter and reasons,
argues the weakness and faintness of the cause. I pass over your words:
I go not about to prove that women may baptize, only I withstand this
error, that the Substance and being of the Sacraments depends upon the man
in any respect. I say that baptism ministered Baptism true baptism though
vulawfully ministered.
by women is true Baptism, though it be not lawful for women to baptize, as
the baptism also ministered by heretics is true baptism, though they be
usurpers of that office. And the same, S. Augustine affirms of baptism by
lay men in the place August. lib. 2. contr. Epist. Parmea. ca. 13.
before alleged: Although (says he) it be usurped without necessity, and is
given of any man to any man, that which is given cannot be said not to be
given, although it may be rightly said not to be rightly given. And I further
say, that if the baptisime, ministered by heretical ministers, which be no
members of the Church, be notwithstanding good and effectual, I see no cause
why it should not be so rather, if it be ministered by lay men, which are
members and parts of the Church.

In the 153. page, M. Bucers censure upon the communion book is cited, for the

of your cause, if you had showed that out of those writings, which are
published and known to be his, and not out of those, whereof men may doubt,
whether ever he wrote any such or no: And if he wrote, whether they be
corrupted by those into whose hands they came. And if you would take any
advantage of M. Bucers testimony, considering that a witness is a public
person, you should have brought him out of your study into the stationers
shop, where he might have been common to others, as well as to you, whereby
his style and manner of writing as it were by his gestures, and countenaunces,
and by those things that go before, and come after, as it were by his head, and
by his fecte, we might the better know whether it were the true Bucer or no.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is very gross courtesy that you show to so worthy and learned a man:
modesty The reverence which T. C. gives to learned men.
and charity would not have been so rash as to answer that which he well
speaks, in opprobriously obiecting unto him his other errors, which you call
gross absurdities. But this is the reverence that you give to all learning,
and learned men, that are contrary to your opinions. I have sometimes heard a
Papiste burst out into this rage, against M. Bucer being pressed with his
authority: But you are the first professor of the Gospel, that ever I heard
so churlishly to use so reverent, so learned, so paynefull, so sound a father,
being also an earnest and zealous professor. It causes me the less to regard
what you speak of me, when I hear such bitterness against all other, be they
never so zealous and excellent. Well Bucers reasons (which touch the quick)
would have been reasonably answered without spyte: and you should rather have
considered them, than the author. There is nothing in these words by him
affirmed, which is not in as plain terms avouched by Zuinglius, in the
words before recited. The book of M. Bucers is forth coming to be showed,
and he affirms nothing therein contrary to his books published: he had more
special occasion here offered to speak both of this and other matters now in
controversy, and therefore the more he is to be credited.

Chap. 5. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page 114. Sect. 2.
For although I will not say but that this may be Bucers doing, yet it seems
very strange, that Bucer should not only contrary to the learned writers
now, but also contrary to all learned antiquity, and contrary to the
practice of the Church, whilst there was any tolerable estate, allow of
women's baptizing. De virgin. velan.
Tertullian says it is not permitted to a woman to speak in the Church, nor
to teach or to baptize, nor to do any work of a man, much less of a
minister. Lib. de Baptis.
And in an other place, although he do permit it to be done by Lay men, in the
time of necessity (as it is termed) yet he gives not that license to the
woman. Epiph. li. 1. contra haeres.
Epiphanius vpbraydeth Marcion that he suffered women to baptize. And Lib. ^.
Vbi de Phry gib. and Priscil.
in an other book he derideth them that they made women Bishops. And Lib. 3.
in an other book he says, it was not granted unto the holy mother of
Christ to baptize her Son.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Bucer speaks not one word in this place of baptising by women: but of
private Baptism, which neither Tertullian, nor Epiphanius in these places by
you alleged do disallow.

yet in the time of necessity (as it is called) he does not allow either of
baptism in private houses, or by women, but when there was danger the women
hasted to carry the children unto the Church, and although he do seem to
allow of the baptism of a Lay man, in the time of necessity, yet there also
he mentions not women's baptism. And further he doubts whether the child
should be baptized again, which was baptized by a lay man.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where does S. Augustine disallow baptising by women, or in private houses? he
utters no such thing in any of the places quoted in the margente. Will you
still counterfeit? is there no end with you of falsifying? In his second
book contra Epistolam Parmeniani, Cap. 13. he does not only say that a lay
man may baptize in the time of necessity, but he also adds, that if it be
ministered without necessity, yet notwithstanding that it is baptism: as
appears in these words (as I have before said) But although it be usurped
(he means baptism by lay men) without necessity, Aug. lib. 2. contra Epist.

and is given of any man to any man, that which is given can not be said not
to be given, although it may be rightly said, that it is not lawfully given.
And he does make the same manifest by two pretty similitudes following, which
I omit for to avoid tediousness. The learned Reader may in that place of
Augustine soon perceive, what an error this is to say, that the Minister is
of the substance and being of the Sacrament: neither does he in either of the
places, either disallowe baptism by women, or in private houses, as you
affirm, but ad Fortunatum he says thus: In Aug. ad Fortunatum.

The authors of the Admonition object that necessity of salvation is tied to
the Sacraments by this means, and that men are confirmed in that old error
that no man can be saved without baptism, which in deed is true. For must
it not be thought to be done of necessity, and upon great extremity, for the
doing whereof the orders that God has let, that it should be done in the
congregation, and by the Minister of the Gospel, are broken? Yes verily. And I
will further say, that although that the Infants which dye without baptism
should be assuredly damned (which is most false) yet ought not the orders
which God has set in his Church, to be broken after this sort. For as the
salvation of men ought to be bear unto us: so the glory of God, which
consists in that his orders be kept, ought to be much more dear, that if
at any time the controversy could be between his glory and our salvation,
our salvation ought to fall that his glory may stand.

sacramental signs, are seals of Gods promises, and whosoever refuses the
same, shall never enjoy the promises, and although the necessity of salvation

think that the external signs of the sacraments are but bare ceremonies,
and in no sense necessary to salvation, which must in time bring in a
contempt of the sacraments, and especially of baptism for Infants.

M. Zuinglius, Bucer, and Calvin as you heard before, although they do not
think children without baptism to be damned, yet do they judge the baptism
of children to be necessary, and that for just causes, as is before declared.
And what Christian would willingly suffer his child to dye without the
sacrament of regeneration, the lack whereof (though it be not a necessary)
yet may it seem to be a probable token and sign of reprobation.

What either order of God, or commandment is broken in private baptism? or
where has God appointed that baptism must be ministered in the open
congregation only, and not upon any cause in private families? Will you yet
deal on this sort without ground or proof? In private baptism used upon
necessity there is neither order nor commandment of God broken. If there be,
show it.

The Admonition.
And yet this is not to tie necessity of salvation to the sacraments, nor to
nousell men up in that opinion. This is agreeable with the scriptures, and
therefore when they bring the baptized child they are received with this
special commendation: I certify you that you have done well and according to
due order. etc.

But now we speak in good earnest, when they answer this, let them tell us
how this gear agrees with the scriptures, and whether it be not repugnant or
against the word of God?

Answer to the Admonition. Page 187. Sect. 1.
And yet (you say) this is not to tie necessity of salvation to the
sacraments, nor to nousell men up in that opinion. etc. No surely, no more
than it is to teach, that children ought to be baptized, and not to tarry
until such time as they be able to answer for themselves.

T. C. Page 115. Sect. 1.
Now in the. 187. page, M. Doctor answers hereunto, that this implies no
more, that the salvation is tied to the sacraments, than when it is taught that
Infants must be baptized, and not tarry until they come to the age of
discretion. The which how truly it is spoken, when as the one has ground of
the scripture, the other has none, the one approved by the continual, and
almost the general practice of the Church, the other used only in the corrupt
and rotten estate thereof, let all men judge.

Io. Whitgifte.
This verifieth my saying, for if baptism of children be grounded upon the
scriptures, as it is, then is the necessity of baptising them, the more: so
that if not for fear of damnation, yet because of Gods commandment and
institution, children are of necessity to be baptized: and this is a received
opinion in the Church, even from the beginning, and therefore lay men in the
time of necessity, from the beginning have been permitted to baptize, as may
appear by the authors before alleged.

T. C. Page 115. Sect. 1.
Therefore for so much as the ministry of the word and Sacraments go
together, and that the ministry of the word may not be committed unto women,
and for that this evil custom has risen first of a false understanding of
the Scripture, and then of a false conclusion of that untrue understanding,
which is, that they can not be saved which are not baptized, and for that the
authors them selves of that error did never seek no remedy of the mischief
in women's or private baptism: And last of all, for that if there were any
remedy, against the mischief in such kind of baptism, yet it ought not to
be used, being against the institution of God, and his glory. I conclude that
the private baptism, and by women is utterly unlawful.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be all petitions of principles, or the most of them: for I have showed
before, that the administration of baptism has been and may be committed to
some, even in the public congregation, to whom the preaching of the word is
not committed: and now in like manner I have proved, that lay men in the time
of necessity may baptize: which both are denied by you without any kind of
proof. I have also showed, how that the necessity of baptising Infants is
vehemently defended of those, that be not of S. Augustines judgment touching
their damnation, if they he not baptized, and I have set down their words,
which conteyne their reasons. Last of all, I have put you to prove that
Private baptism in time of necessity is against any commandment or
institution of Christ's: for I deny it. So that notwithstanding I suspende my
judgment for baptizing by women: yet I am out o^ doubt for private baptism.

I know not what you mean by private Communion: if you (...).
mean the receiving of one alone, there is none such allowed in the book: if
you mean because it is ministered sometime upon occasion in private houses, I
see not how you can call it private in respect of the place, if the number of

what you mean.

There is nothing in the communion book touching the Communion, contrary to
the place of S. Paul by you quoted, to my 1. Cor. 11. ^.
knowledge.

T. C. Page. 105. Sect. 1.
There follows the private Communion, which is found fault with, both for
the place wherein it is ministered, and for the small number of Communicants,
which are admitted by the book of service. Touching the place before is
spoken sufficiently, it rests to consider of the number. But before I come to
that, I will speak something of the causes and beginning of receiving in
houses, and of the ministering of the Communion unto sick folks. It is not to
be denied, but that this abuse is very ancient, and was in Iustine Martyrs
time, in Tertullians and Cyprians time, even as also there were other abuses
crepte into the Supper of the Lord, and that very gross, as the mingling of
water with wine, and therein also a necessity and great mystery placed, as it
may appear both by Iustine Martyr, and Cyprian, which I therefore by the way
do admonish the Reader of, that the antiquity of this abuse of private
Communion, be not prejudicial to the truth, no more than the mingling of
water with that opinion of necessity that those fathers had of it, is or ought
to be prejudicial to that that we use in ministering the cup with pure wine,
according to the institution.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is your accustomed manner (but it is besides all good manners) to wype away

ancient and learned authority, by obiecting unto the authors, some
imperfection in their writings, or errors in their times. Is this a good
reason, water was of necessity required in Cypryans time in the administration
of the supper, and that was an error, therefore the communion at that time,
and long before, ministered unto the sick, and carried to private persons
being absent, was unlawful? Such be your arguments, and this is your kind
of answering: which may be plausible to the ignorant people, but nothing
pleasant to such as be learned. This one thing More sincerity in the mi
nistratio^ now than in the ancient Church.
I will desire the Reader to consider (that seeing our sacraments now be more
sincerely ministered than they were in Iustines, Tertullians, and Cyprians time,
being so near the Apostles) what cause there should be for you, so bitterly
to inu^ygh against this Church in that respect.

Chap. 6. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page 115. toward the end.
I say therefore that this abuse was ancient, and rose upon these causes. First
of all in the primitive Church, the discipline of the Church was so severe,
and so extreme, that if any which professed the truth, and were of the body
of the Church, did through infyrmitie denic the truth, and joined himself
unto the Idolatrous service, although he repenting came again unto the
Church, yet was he not received to the communion of the Lords supper any more.
And yet lying in extremity of sickness, and ready to depart this life, if
they did require the Communion in token that the Church had forgiven the fault,
and was reconciled altogether unto that person that had so fallen, they
granted that he might be partaker of it, as may appear by the Euscb. li. 6.
cap. 4^
story of Serapton.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is true, for sometime they had three, six, or ten years space of
repentance before they were admitted to the sacrament, and after that time was
expired, they came as other did to the Communion, if they lived to it: if not,
they received it on their death bed. This is for my purpose, for it
manifestly declares, that then the Communion was ministered unto the sick,
which is our question, it can by no means be drawn against me.

Chap. 6. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page. 116. Lin. 2.
An other cause was that which was before alleged, which is, the false
opinion, which they had conceived, that all those were condemned, that received
not the supper of the Lord, and therefore when as those that were as they
called them Cathecumeni, which is young Nouices in religion, never admitted to
the supper, or young children fell sick daungerously, they ministered the supper
of the Lord unto them, least they should want their voyage victual (as they
termed it) which abuse notwithstanding was neither so ancient as the other,
nor so general.

Io. Whitgifte.
This was the cause that moved some so to do: howbeit, neither was it the
only cause, neither the general and usual cause, but the general and usual
cause was the institution of Christ, and the fruits and effects of that
Supper, the which whosoever does consider accordingly, will neither cease
from requiring it, in time of extremity, neither withholde it from such as
faithfully and earnestly desire the same, and it is an easy matter to show,
that this manner of communicating in private families, is of very great
antiquity, even in Justinius Martyrs time, as appears in his second
Apology, and is by you confessed.

Chap. 6. the. 4. Division.
T. C. Page 116. Lin. 8.
And there wanted not good men, which declared their misliking, and did decree
against both the abuses, and against all manner communicating in private
houses. As in the Council of Tom. 1. ^n. 58.
Laodicea, it was ordained that neither Bishop nor Elder, should make any
oblation, that was, minister any Communion in houses.

Io. Whitgifte.
This Council does speak against the usual manner of celebrating the
Communion in private houses, without any respect of necessity: which abuse
was grown in some places in the time of Hierome and Damasus, about whose time
this The Communion ministered to the sick.
Council was: but there is neither Council, nor learned Father, that ever
opened their mouths against ministering the Communion to the sick in pryuate
families, or upon any other vrgente or necessary occasion. The In the Greek

12. Canon of the Council of Nice, does determine directly, that the
Communion ought to be ministered to the sick.

Chap. 6. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 116. Lin. 12.
Besides therefore that I have before showed the unlawfulness generally of
ministering the Sacrament in private places, seeing that the custom of
ministering this Supper unto the sick, rose upon corrupt causes and rotten
foundations, and consydering also (God be praised) in these times there are non
driven by fear to renounce the truth, whereupon any such excommunication
should ensue, which in the extremity of sickness should be mitigated after
this sort (for no man now that is in extreme sickness, is cast down, or
else assaulted with this temptation, that he is cut off from the Church) I
say these things considered, it follows, that this ministering of Communion
in private houses, and to the sick, is unlawful, as that which rose upon
evil grounds: and if it were lawful, yet that now in these times of peace,
and when the sick are not excommunicated, there is no use of it. And so it
appears how little the custom of the old Church, does help M. Doctor in
this point.

Io. Whitgifte.
This was one cause, but not the only cause why the Communion was ministered to
the sick: the chief and principal cause was (as I have said) the fruits and
effects of that Sacrament, which is remission of sins, peace of conscience,
and effectual applying of the death and passion of Christ unto the
Communicants, and an assurance of Gods promises, whereof that sacrament is an
effectual seal.

And as for that he says Peter Martyr, and Bucer do allow the Communion

else he means some odd thing, that he has written, and laid up in some

well inoughe agree with the holy Scriptures: for to receive the Communion of

comfort of afflicted consciences, if it be received according to the Lords
institution.

M. Martyrs allowing of the same, is added in that place.

the sick, is retained in diverse reformed Churches, for this end, that the
sick persons thereby may be strengthened in faith, made stronger against the
temptations of Satan, and the better armed to bear the pains of death.
Neither do I see any reason (if the superstitious opinion of the Papists be
rooted out) why any man in that case should be deprived of these benefits.

Chap. 6. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page. 116. Sect. 2.
Now remains to be spoken of the number of communicantes, and that there is
saulte in the appoynting of the Service book, not only for that it admits
in the time of plague, that one with the Minister may celebrate the Supper of
the Lord in the house, but for that it ordeyneth a Communion in the Church,
when of a great number which assemble there, it admytteth thrce or four. The
abuse and inconvenience whereof may thus be considered. The holy Sacrament of
the Supper of the Lord is not only a seal, and confirmation of the promises
of God unto us, but also a profession of our comunction, as well with Christ
our savior, and with God, as also (as 1. C^. 10
S. Paul teaches) a declaration and profession that we are at one with our
brethren: so that it is first a sacrament, of the knytting of all the body
generally, and of every member particularly with the head, and then of the
members of the body one with an other. Now therefore seeing that every
particular Church and body of Gods people, is a representation, and as it were
a lively portrayture of the whole Church and body of Christ, it follows that
which we can not do with all the Church scattered throughout the whole
world, for the distaunces of places whereby we are severed, we ought to do
with that Church whereunto God has raunged us, as much as possibly or
conuentently may be. The departing therefore of the rest of the Church, from
those three or four is an open profession that they have no communion,
fellowship, nor unity with them that do communicate: and likewise of those
three or four, that they have none with the rest that join not themselves
thereunto: when as both by the many grapes making one cup, and corns making
one loaf, that whole Church being many persons, are called as to the unity
which they have one with an other, and altogether among them selves: so to the
declaration and profession of it, by receiving one with another, and altogether
amongst themselves. And as if so be, that we do not celebrate as we may
possibly and conveniently, the supper of the Lord, we thereby utter our want
of love toward the Lord, which has redeemed us: so if we do not
communicate together with the Church, so far forth as we may do
conveniently we betray the want of our love, that we have one toward an
other. And therefore S. 1. C^. 11
Paul driving hereunto, wysheth that one should tarry for an other,
reprehending that when one preuenteth, and comes before an other, saying:
that that is to take every man his own supper, and not to celebrate the Lords
Supper, not that so many men or women as there came, so many tables were, for
that had not been possible in so great assemblies, but that they sorted them
selves into certain companies, and that they came scattering one after an
other, and that in stead of making one Supper of the Lord, they did make
diverse.

Io. Whitgifte.
You can not be ignorant, that the whole drifte of the Communion book, is to

all men to often communicating, and that together, as it manifestly appears
in the first exhortation in the book prescribed to be read, when the Curate
shall see the people negligent in coming to the Communion, the which if you
had well peruse^ you would have (as I think) cut off much of this talk. If
the book should appoint that three or four should communicate together, and
no more, or if it did not allow that Communion best wherein most of the Church
do participate: then were your reasoning to some end: but seeing that it is
appointed that there should not be fewer than three or four, to the end that
it might be a Communion, and have no similitude with the Papisticall Mass,
there is no cause why you should take this pains. And surely he that shall
compare that exhortation in the book with this discourse of yours, it will be
no hard matter for him to judge, how much more pithily and effectually Three or
four a sufficient number, if other will not communicate.
this matter is there handled, than it is here by you. But that three or four
should be a sufficient number to communicate if other will not, there is good
cause: for seeing the holy Sacrament is a Seal and confirmation of Gods
promises, and an effectual applying of the death and passion of Christ unto
us, and therefore a singular comfort and relief to the afflicted conscience
and mind touched with the feeling Three or four a congregation. Math. 18.
of sin, why should those that be desirous of it being a congregation (as
three or four is, according to the saying of Christ, where two or three be
gathered together in my name, etc.) be debarred from their Godly desire, and
that singular comfort, for the carelessness, security, negligence, or lack of
such feeling of others? Shall none communicate because all will not? Or shall
not three or four because the rest refuse? Or is it lack of love toward our
neighbor, or any token thereof if we resort to the Lords table, when other
will not? Where learn you that?

The place of S. Paul. 1. Cor. 11. is not aptly applied. For the Apostle in
that place, reproves only such as contemptuously or contentiously did
separate themselves from other as well in the public feasts called Love
feasts, and then used in the Church, as in the Supper of the Lord. But he
rather means of the first than of the Martyr. in. 1. Cor. 11.
latter, and therefore says M. Martyr upon that place. The Supper is here
called private: either because some did challenge to themselves privately that
which belonged to all: or else because every one after the receiving of the
holy mysteries, did take again to himself those things, which he had offered
at the Lords table, and made that his own which by right belonged to all.
And again he says, that the Corinthians be there reproved, Because they
pampered their belly, and contemned their brethren. I told you before what M.
Calvin thought of this place: it can in no respect tend to the disallowing of
any order appointed in the book of common prayer, because no man is secluded
from the Communion that will come, and those that come when other men will not,
do it not of contempt or of contention, but of conscience and piety. Moreover,
we have no such banquettes or feasts, either before or after the Communion,
as the Corinthians had, and therefore in that respect, there can be no such
abuse as the Apostle there reproves.

Chap. 6. the. 8. Division.
Admonition.
Sixthly, in this book three or four are allowed for a fit number to receive
the Communion, and the Priest alone together with one more, or with the sick
man alone, may in time of necessity, that is, when there is any common plague,
or in time of other visitation minister it to the sick man, and if he require
it, it may not be denied. This is not I am sure, like in effect to a private
Mass: that Scripture Mat. 26. 27 Mar. 14. 23
drink ye all of this, makes not against this, and private Communion, is not
against the Scriptures.

Answer to the Adm onition. Page 185. Sect. 1.
How untruly these men charge the Church with private Communions I have showed
before. The place of scripture here alleged to prove that three or four be
not a sufficient number to communicate No number determined to be at the
Communion.
is this, drink ye all of this. Mat. 26. Mark. 14. which may as well be
applied to prove that ten, twenty, forty, is no sufficient number: I know not
what your meaning is except you think no number sufficient, unless al do
communicate together, because Christ said drink ye all of this. This text
proves that all ought to be partakers of the Lords Cup, but it does not
determine any certain number of Communicants. I know there be some of the
old fathers as Basilius Basil would have. xii. at the least.
Magnus, which would not have fewer Communicants than. xii. But of the number
of Communicants there is nothing determined in Scripture, neither is it
material so that there be a number, that it may be a Communion.

T. C. Page 117. Sect. 1.
These things being considered, the reason which the Admonition uses in the.
185. page, where this matter is spoken of, which is, drink you al of this, is
not so ridiculous, as M. doctor makes it. For although it do neither prove
that. 12. or. 20. or any other definite number must of necessity receive, yet
it proves that as all they which were present did communicate: so as many as
in the Church are fit to receive the Sacraments, or may conuetently receive
them together, should follow that example in celebrating the supper together.

Io. Whitgifte.
The book of common prayer does greatly commend, and like the receyning of the
whole Church together, but if that can not be obtained (as it cannot, and they
will not have men compelled unto it) it secludeth not those that be well
disposed: so they be a competent number. And the book does exhort those to
depart which do not communicate, with a warning from whence they depart, so
that you may well understand, that the meaning of the Book is, that all that
be present should communicate. Neither can this place of scripture be drawn to
improve the decree of ye Church therein. For Christ had. 70. other disciples and
his mother, with diverse other which followed him, that were not present at that
Supper: as no doubt they should have been, if by that example he had meant to
have made a law, that there may be no Communion unless the whole congregation
of every particular Church do communicate together.

Chap. 6. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page 117. Sect. 1.
And it is probably to be thought, that if our Savior Christ had not been
restreyned by the law of God, touching the Passover unto his own family
being twelve, and therefore a competent number to ear up a lamb by
themselves, that he would have celebrated his supper, not only amongst his.
xii. disciples, which They were made Apostles before, and so called.
afterward he made Apostles, but also amongst other of his disciples, and
professors of his doctrine. But for so much as it was meet that he should
celebrate his supper there and then, where and when he did celebrate his
Passover, for the cause before by me alleged, it pleased him to keep his
first Supper with twelve only, for that the law of Communication unto the
Passover which was joined with the supper, would not admit any greater number
of Communicants, they being sufficient and enough to eat up the passover.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is only a conjecture: but it overthrows your argument: for by your
saying, Christ had his twelve Apostles there at Supper, because the law
touching the Passcouer did bind him thereunto, not because he would signify
that there should be no Communion except the whole Church do communicate.

The disciples were made Apostles before the institution of the Supper, and
were so called, as it is evident. Math. 10. and Mark. 3. and therefore I
marvel what you mean Math. 10. Mark. 3.
in saying, which afterward he made Apostles.

Chap. 6. the. 10. Division.
T. C. Page 117. Sect. 2.
And although it be clear and plain, that when it is said drink ye all of
this, and ta^ie one for another, these sayings are meant of that particular
congregation or assembly which assemble themselves together to be taught by
one mouth of the Minister, yet I have therefore put this caution of (as much as
may be possible) least any man should cavil, as though I would have no
Communion, until all the godly through the world should meet together.
Likewise I have put this caution (as much as may be conveniently) for although
it be possible, that any particular Church may communicate at one table, in one
day, and together, yet may the same be inconvenient for diverse causes. As if
the number should be very great, so that to have them all communicate
together, it would require such a long time, as the tarry ng out of the whole
action, would hazard either the life, or at least the health of diverse there.
Again forasmuch as other some being at the Church it is meet that other
should be at home upon occasion of infantes and such like things, as require
the presence of some to tar^e at home. In these cases and such like the
inconveniences do deliver us from the gilt of uncharitableness and forsaking
the fellowship of the Church, for that we do not here sever onr selves, but are
by good and just causes severed, which gilt we shall never escape, if besides
such necessary causes we pretend those that are not, or having not so much as
a pretense, yet notwithstanding separate our selves, as the daily practice
through the Church does show.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you be content to admit so many cautions, and exceptions, then is the
question soon decyded, and you make it no such commandment, but that upon
occasion it may be altered. In deed the words of Christ do signify, that the
cup of the Supper, and the whole Supper is common to all, as well of the laytie
(as we term them) as of the clergy, but it does not prescribe what number
shall be present at every several Communion. I do not excuse those that
withdraw themselves from that Supper, except it be upon necessary and just
occasion, but I deny that the negligence or lawful occasion of some ought to
hinder or stay other from communicating: this you should have proved, but you
do not, and your cautions, and exceptions (which I very well allow) declare
the contrary.

Chap. 6. the. 11. Division.
T. C. Page. 117. Sect. 3.
But it may be objected, that in this point the book of common prayer is not
in fault, which does not only not forbid that all the Church should receive
together, but also by a good and godly exhortation moves those that be
present, that they should not depart but communicate altogether. It is true
that it does not forbid, and that there is godly exhortation for that purpose,
but that (I say) is not enough, for neither should it suffer that three or
four should have a Communion by themselves (so many being in the Church meet
to receive, and to whom the Supper of the Lord does of like right apperteyne)
and it ought to provide that those which would withdraw themselves, should be
by ecclesiastical discipline at all times, and now also under a godly Prince
by civil punishment This is clean^ contrary to the Admonition. page 109.
brought to communicate with their brethren. And this is the law of God, and
this is now and has been heretofore the practice of Churches reformed. All
men understand that the Passover was a figure of the Lords Supper, and that
there should be as straight bonds to bind men to celebrate the remembrance
of our spiritual deliverance, as there was to remember the deliverance out of
Egypt. But whosoever did not then communicate with the rest at that time, when
the Passover was eaten, was excommunicated, as it may appear in the Numbers,
Number. 9.
where he says, that whosoever did not communicate being clean, This is not
excommunication, but putting to death.
his soul should be cut of from amongst the people of God, therefore this
neglect or contempt rather of the Lords Supper ought to be punished with no
less punishment, especially when as (after the Church has proceeded in that
order which our Savior Christ appoynteth of admonishing) they be not sorry for
their fault, and promise amendment. And that this was the custom of the
Churches, it may appear by Conc. Apo. Can. 9.
the. 9. of those Cannons which are fathered of the Apostles, where it is
decreed that all the faithful that entered into the congregation, and heard the
Scriptures read, and did not tarry out the prayers and the holy Communion,
should be as those which were cause^s of disorders in the Church, separated
from the Church (or as it is translated of an other) deprived of the Communion.
Also in the council of Braccara, it was decreed, that if any entering into the
Church of God, heard the Scriptures, Con. 2. Bracca. cap. 83. ^om. 2.
and afterward of wantonness or losenesse, withdrew himself from the
Communion of the Sacrament and so brake the rule of discipline in the reverend
Sacraments, should be put out of the church, till such time as he had by good
fruits declared his repentance.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do not much disagree from this, saving that I see no reason, that three or
four should be debarred from so comfortable and fruteful a Sacrament, either
for the negligence or necessary impediments of others: except also your
misundersta^ding of the 9. of Numbers: for delere animam eius de populis suis
is there not to excommunicate, (as you interpret it, but to put to death and
to kill, which were a hard punishment for such as be negligent in coming to
the Communion. Convenient discipline I think very necessary in this point,
and therefore I will not stand with you in other circumstances of this
portion, only I will desire the Reader to note how far the Authors The
Admonition and the (...) agr^ not.
of the Admonition vary from you in this assertion, who Page 102. say, That we
thrust them in their sin to the Lords table, and page 109. that it should
be provided, that Papists nor other, neither constraynedly nor customable
communicate in the mysteryes of salvation, which cannot otherwise be meant,
than that we compel them by punishments to come to the Lords table. But how
much more cause should they have so to say: if we were as severe in punishing
as you here require. But the negligence of the common sort, in not oftener
frequenting the Lords supper is lamentable, the punishment appointed for such,
in all places not so well executed, and therefore as I said before, I think
convenient, discipline and due execution of the same, very necessary.

An other thing also I would have the Reader to mark, that you here allege
for proof the Canons of the Apostles; which are as much doubted of to have
been the Apostles, as the Epistles either of Clement, or Anacletus.

Chap. 6. the. 12. Division.
T. C. Page 118. Sect. 1.
But here also may rise another doubt of the former words of Moses, in the
book of Numbers. For seeing that he makes this exception (if they be clean)
it may be said that those that depart, do not feel themselves meet to
receive, and therefore depart, the other three or four, or mo, feel
themselves meet and disposed for that purpose, whereupon it may seem that it
is neither reason to compel those to come, which feel not themselves meet,
nor to reject them that feel that good disposition and preparation in
themselves. For answer whereunto we must understand, that the uncleanness
which Moses speaks of was such as men could not easily avoid. And whereunto
they might fall sometimes, by necessary duty, as by handling their dead,
which they were by the rule of charity bound to bury, sometimes by touching
at unawares a dead body, or by sitting in the place where some unclean body
had sitten, or by touching such things, which the law judged unclean, which
thing cannot be alleged in those that are now of the Church: for as many as
be of it, and withal of such discretion, as are able to prove and examine
themselves, can have no excuse at all if they may be at the Church, to
withdraw themselves from the holy Supper of the Lord. For if they will say,
that they be not meet, it may be answered unto them, that it is their own
fault, and further if they be not meet to receive the holy Sacrament of the
Supper, they are not meet to hear the word of God, they are not meet to be
partakers of the prayers of the Church, and if they be for one, they are also
for the other, for with that boldness, and with that duty or lawfulness, (I
speak of those which are of the Church, and of discretion to examine them
selves) I say This is not true as shall be showed.
with what lawfulness they may offer themselves to the prayers, and to the
hearing of the word of God, they may also offer themselves unto the Lords
Supper. And to whom soever of them the Lord will communicate himself by
preaching the word unto the same he will not refuse to communicate himself by
receiving of the Sacraments, for whosoever is of Gods householde and family, he
need not be afraid to come to the Lords table, nor doubt but that the Lord
will feed him there, and whatsoever he be, that is a member of the body of
Christ, may be assured that he receives life from Christ the head, as well by
the arteries and conduites of the Supper of the Lord, as by the preaching of
the word of God: so that it must needs follow, that the not receiving of
those which depart out of the Church, when there is any Communion celebrated,
proceeds either of vain and supersticious fear, growing of gross ignorance
of themselves and of the holy Sacraments, or else of an intolerable negligence
or rather contempt, of the which neither the one, nor the other should be
either borne with or nourished, either by permitting three or four to
communicate alone, or else in letting them which depart go so easily away with
so great a fault which ought to be severely punished.

Io. Whitgifte,
Neither do I differ from you in the substance of this that you here set down,
which is (as I take it) to cut off frivolous and vain excuses, used by such as
either neglect or contemn the holy Communion, but in certain circumstances
here used, I do not altogether agree with you. For first, the uncleanness that
Moses speaks of is but ceremonial and external, and therefore may more
easily be avoided: but weakness of faith, and uncleanness of life (which may
and ought for a time withdraw men from the Communion) is natural and inward,
and therefore with greater difficulty shunned.

Secondly a Christian man and a true member of the Church may take benefit Me^
not mete to communicate, may be admitted to the hearing of the from and pray^.
by prayer and hearing of the word of God, which yet for diverse respects is
not meet to receive the holy Communion: and indeed praying and preaching be
means to prepare men, and make them apt to communicate: besides this he that
is weak in faith, corrupt in judgment, ignorant in the right use of the
Sacrament, may be admitted to prayer, and to the hearing of the word, that he
may be instructed (for fides ex auditu, faith comes by hearing) so may he
not, to the receiving Rom 10
of the Supper: thirdely, no man may presume to receive the Supper except he
has first tried and examined himself: but he ought to come to the hearing of
the word of God, that he may first learn how to examine himself. Wherefore
this is not true that with what lawfulness they may offer themselves to the
prayers and to the hearing of the T. C. contrary to himself, page 35. ^n. 10
and page 133. li^. 19.
word of God, they may also offer themselves unto the Lords Supper. And you
affirm the contrary. Page 35. For there you say that the Magistrate ought to
compel such as be Papists and excommunicate persons to hear Sermons, and
Page 133. you affirm the same in playner words, showing a reason why such
may be admitted to the hearing of the word, and yet not to the participation
of the Lords Supper. Lastly, I deny that any such persuasion is nourished in
them, by suffering three or four to communicate, but the contrary rather, for
the Godly example of these few may either provoke the rest to the like
diligence, or else confound them and make them ashamed, especially if either
that Godly exhortation contained in the book, be read unto them, or they be
otherwise put in mind of their slacknesse by a Godly and careful Minister.
These circumstances excepted, in the rest of the matter in this part I agree
with you.

Chap. 6. the. 13. Division.
T. C. Page. 118. Sect. 1.
And upon this either contempt or superstitious fear, drawn from the Papists
lenton preparation of forty days, eare^hrift, displing, etc. it comes to
pass that men receiving the Supper of the Lord but seldom, when they fall
sick must have the Supper ministered unto them in their houses, which otherwise
being once every week received before should not breed any such
unquietness in them, when they cannot come to receive it, although as I have
before showed, if they had never received it before, yet that private receiving
were not at any hand to be suffered. And thus having declared what I think to
be faulty, in the Communion book in this point, and the reasons why, and
withal answered to that which either M. Doctor alleges in this place of the
80. and 81. and likewise in the 152. and 185. pages touching this matter, I
come now unto that which is called the Jewish purifying by the Admonition, and
by the service book before time, the purifycation of women.

Io. Whitgifte.
I see not how this in any point is true: for lenton fast was then used when
the Communion was most diligently and often frequented, and indeed the rare
and seldom receiving, came in with private Massing, which had the beginning
long after the lenton fast.

To receive once every week is a thing to be wished if it might conveniently
be, And yet notwithstanding were not the Communion to be denied to the sick:
for it oftentimes comes to pass, that men through infirmity and sickness
are not able to come to the Church in whole months and years, whom this
weekly communicating could nothing help, and it were against all reason to
debar them of this seal of Gods promises, this effectual manner and kind of
applying of the death of Christ unto themselves, this assurance of the
forgiveness of sins, and this Sacrament of comfort, especially in time of
extremity and sickness, if they be desirous of it. And thus you have declared
what you think to be faulty in the Communion book in this point, and the
reasons why: but of what force your reasons are, and how justly in this point
you charge the book, the Reader may now judge.

Of the Churching of women.
Chap. 7. the. 1. Division.

forth a child was holden Srife about words.
unclean, until such time as she came to the temple to show hirselfe, after
she had brought forth a man or a woman: so this term of churching of her can
seem to import nothing else, than a banishment (and as it were) a certain
excommunication from the Church during the space that is between the time of
her delivery, and of her coming unto the Church. For what does else this
churching implie; but a restoring her unto the Church, which cannot be without
some bar or shutting forth presupposed. It is also called the thanks giving,
but the principal title which is the directorie of this part of the Liturgy,
and placed in the top of the leaf, as that which the translator best lyked of,
is (Churching of women.) To pass by that, that it will have them come as nigh
the Communion table as may be, as they came before to the high altar (because
I had spoken once generally against such ceremonies) that of all other is most
Jewish, and approaches nearest to the Jewish purifycation, that she is
commanded to offer accustomed offerings, wherein besides that the very word
offering caryeth with it a strong sent and suspicion of a sacryfice (especially
being uttered symply without any addition) it cannot be without danger that
the book makes the custom of the Popish Church (which was so corrupt) to be
the rule and measure of this offering. And although the meaning of the book is
not, that it should be any offering for sin, yet this manner of speaking, may
be a stumbling stock in the way of the ignorant and simple, and the wicked and
obstinate thereby are confirmed and hardened in their corruptious. The best
which can be answered in this case is, that it is for the relief of the
minister, but then it should be remembered, first that the minister lives not
any more of offerings: secondarily, that the payment of the ministers wages is
not so convenient, either in the Church, or before all the people: and thirdly,
that thereby we fall into that fault which we condemn in Popery, and that is,
that besides the ordinary living appointed for the service of the Priests in
the whole, they took for their several services of Mass, Baptism, Burying,
Churching, etc. several rewards, which thing being of the service book, well
abolished in certains other things, I cannot see, what good cause there should
be to retain it in this and certain other.

about words and terms, when they cannot reprove any thing in the matter it
self. For in all these faults here pretended there is not one that touches
the matter of the book, only the title in the top of the leaf, the coming
of women so near to the Communion table, the paying of the accustomed offerings
to the Curate, are in this place reproved, as matters of great importance,
being all of themselves not worth the talking off: and yet being (as comely
and decent orders) prescribed by the Church, may not be contemned and despised,
without the crime of stubbornness and disobedience. But that your quarelling
may the rather appear, I will answer your cauilles in as few words as I can,
and first for the title which is this. The thanks giving of women after
childbirth, commonly called the Churching of women. Now sir you see, that the
proper title The people hardly brought to leave accustomed terms
is this. The thanks giving of women after Childebirth. The other is the
common name customably used of the common people, who will not be taught to
speak by you, or any man, but keep their accustomed names and terms:
therefore they call the Lords day Sunday, and the next day unto it Monday,
profane and ethnicall names, and yet nothing derogating from the days and
times. Likewise they call the Morning and Evening prayer, Mattens and Euensong,
neither can they be brought to the contrary, and yet the prayers be not the
worse: so they call the day of Christ's nativity Christmasse, etc. what is
this to condemn the things themselves?

But you say this term does import nothing else than a banishment from the
Church. etc. so might you say that these names Sunday and Monday do import yt
we dedicate those days to the Sun and Moon: and so likewise might you say of
the other names retained in the common and usual speech: but all men would
then epsy your folly even as they may do now, if they be disposed. The
absence of the woman after her delyuerie, is neither banishment nor
excommunication (as you term it) but a withdrawing The true cause of the

of the party from the Church by reason of that infirmity and danger, that
God has laid upon woman kind in punishment of the first sin, which
danger she knows not whether she shall escape or no: and therefore after
she has not only escaped it, but also brought a child into the world, to
the increase of Gods people, and after such time as the comeliness of nature
may bear, she comes first into The cause of her thanksgiving.
the Church to give thanks for the same, and for the deliverance by Christ
from that sin, whereof that infirmity is a perpetual testimony. And this
being done, not Iewishly, but Christianly, not of custom, but of duty, not to
make the act of lawful matrimony unclean, but to give thanks to God for
deliverance from so manifold perilles, what Christian heart can for the
names sake, thus disallowe of it, as you do?

The coming so near the communion table, is a very small matter to carpe at,
it is thought to be the most convenient place, both for the minister and for
the woman, especially if she be disposed to receive the holy Communion. But
such trifling quarrels argue an extreme penury of good and substantial
reasons.

The paying of her accustomed offerings which you seem most to mislike (as
your self confess the meaning of the book to be) has no such purpose and
intent, as you would make the Reader to believe, neither can it: for she neither
offers Lamb, Turtles, or Leuit. 12,
young Pigeons, as the law requires, but pays to the Curate his accustomed
duty, which both she may as lawfully give, and he receive, as the other
tenthes may be paid and received. It is a portion of the Pastors living
appointed and limited unto him by the Church, and therefore he may lawfully
receive it, as it is appointed unto him. And all your objections to the
contrary, are hereby answered fully.

The third is, the Iewishe purifyings (as you term it) you cite for that
purpose Act. 15. where Peter speaking against certain of the Pharisees, which
believed and taught that it was nedeful for the Gentiles which were converted,
to be circumcised, and to observe Moses law, says on this sort: Now
therefore why tempte ye God, Act. 15.
to lay a yoke on the disciples necks. etc. How any thing here contained,
prohibiteth women after they be delivered from the great danger and pains of
child bearing, to give in the congregation thanks for their deliverance, let
the godly Reader judge. Surely this is no Iewishe purifying, but Christian
giving of thanks, most consonant and agreeable to the word of God. But hereof
also some thing more is to be spoken in an other place.

T. C. Page 119. lin. 24.
Now whereas M. Doctor says that the place of the 15. of the Acts alleged
by the Admonition, makes nothing against this, he should have considered, that
if it be a Iewyshe ceremony (as they suppose it) it is to be abolished utterly.
For it being showed there, that all the Ceremonial law of Moses is done away
through our Savior Christ, this also a part thereof must needs be therein
comprysed.

Io. Whitgifte.
The place nothing perteyneth to this purpose, neither is giving of thanks a
Iewysh Ceremony, and therefore their supposition is but vain.

Chap. 7. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 119. in the midst.
And whereas he says that it being nothing else but a thanksgiving for hit
deliverance, cannot be therefore but Christian and very godly: I answer, that
if there should be solemn and express giving of thanks in the Church for
every benefit, either equal or greater than this, which any singular person
in the Church does receive, we should not only have no preaching of the
Theod. li. 4 cap. 11.
word, nor ministering of the Sacraments, but we should not have so much
leisure, as to do any corporal or bodily work, but should be like unto those
heretykes, which were called of the Syriake word Messalians or continual
prayers and which did nothing else but pray.

Io. Whitgifte.
Truth is never contrary unto it self: before you reproved the book of
Common prayer for want of thanksgiving for benefits received: and now you
reprove it for appointing thanks to be given for deliverance from sin, from
manifold perils Page 108. Sect. 3.
and dangers, and for the increase of Gods people, all which things are
public, although thanks be given by a private person: for in deed the
punishment and danger laid upon all womankinde, for disobedience is not only
common, but very notorious, and a perpetual testimony of our subjection unto
sin, and therefore requires a solemn thanksgiving at such time as it
pleases God to show his mercy therein, and to deliver from ill. And yet if
it were not so, where read you that any private person is forbidden to give
thanks in the public congregation, for some especial benefit received,
namely if the Church think it convenient, and agree thereunto, as it does to
this?

Theodoret says, that the Messalian heretics had these errors: first, they
being The errors of the Messalians Theod. lib. 4. cap. 11.
possessed with a Devil, which they thought to be the holy spirit, did
condemn all bodily labor as wicked: secondly, they being given to much
sleep, did name the visions of their dreams prophesies: thirdly, they said
that the supper of the Lord and Baptism, did neither good nor harm to any
man: fourthlye, when they were charged with such things, they would not stand
to them, but impudently deny them: last of all, they taught that every man when
he is borne, does take of his parents as the nature, so likewise the servitude
of Devils, which being driven out by dilligent prayer, the holy spirit entered
in. etc. This is all that Theodoret in that place reports of those heretics:
the which how much it makes against either diligent or continual prayers,
Luc. 18. Romans 12. Epbe. 6. Coll. 4.
or thanksgiving for benefits received, the Reader may consider. Christ and
the Apostle S. Paul, require continual prayer and thanksgiving, but not in
the same sense and meaning that the Messalians did.

For the Psalm. 121. spoken of in the. 155. page, it being showed that it is
not meet to have any such solemn thanksgiving, it is nedelesse to debate of
the Psalm, wherewith the thanksgiving should be made.

Io. Whitgifte.
A short answer, and to small purpose: the Psalm is most apt for that end,
and thanksgiving in such cases most godly, as I have declared both in my
Answer to the Admonition and to your Reply.

Admonition.
The twelfte. Churching of women after child birth, smells of Iewishe
purification: their other rites and custom in their lying in, and coming to
church, is foolish and superstitious, as it is used. She must lie in with a
white sheet upon her bed, and come covered with a veil, as ashamed of some
folly. She must offer, but these are matters of custom, and not in the book:
but this Psalm (as is noted before) is childishly abused. I Psalm. 121.
have lifted up mine eyes unto the hiis, from whence comes my help. The
Sun shall not burn thee by day, nor the Moon by night.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 155. and. 202. for the which T. C. has
quoted. 101. and. 102. page.
In the hundredth fifty five, these be my words. That women should come in
vayles is not contained in the book, no more in deed is the wafer cake, and
therefore you might well have left these two out of your reason being thrust
in without all reason. To ye which nothing is answered.

In the. 202. page thus I say. For their lying in, I can say little. I am not
skillful in women's matters, neither is it in the book, no more is her white
sheet, nor her veil: let the women them selves answer these matters.

T. C. Page 119. lin. 38.
And whereas in the. 101. and. 102. pages unto the Admonition, obiecting that
the coming in the veil to the church more then, than at other times, is a
token of shame, or of some folly committed, M. Doctor iestingly leueth the
matter to the women's answer, a little true knowledge of divinity, would have
taught him, that the bringing in or usurping without authority any ceremony in
the congregation, is both an earnester matter than may be iested at, and a
weightier than should be permitted unto the discretion of every woman,
consydering that the same has been so horribly abused in the time of popery.

Io. Whitgifte.
The answer is fit for so frivolous an objection: and a little true reason

of malicious carping, would have taught you that this is rather a civil
manner and custom of our country, than a ceremony of the church, and the
wearing of new gloves (as many at that time, and especally at the time of
marriages do) is as much a ceremony as those: for the wearing of the veil,
first began of that weakness and sickness, that nature in that danger does
bring most women unto, thereby to keep them the more from the air, and
therefore (as I have said) in this country it was taken up as a custom of
the people, and not as a ceremony of the Church. But I perceive you will
play small game before you sit out, and pick out very small trifles (though
without the book) to braule and bark at, rather than you would lack matter.

Fourthly, you mislyke observing of holydays: And you allege Holidays.

in the holy scriptures. And I would to God it were better looked unto. But to
absteyne any day from bodily labor, that we may labor spiritually in hearing
the word of God, magnifying his name and practicing the works of charity, is
not either against this, or any other commandment. For I think the meaning
of this commandment is not so to tie men to bodily labor, that they may not
intermitte the same to labor spiritually. For then how could we preachers
and students excuse our selves? How might the people lawfully come to our
Sermons and Lectures in any of the six days? But of this thing also occasion
will be ministered to speak more hereafter.

T. C. Page 119. Sect. 1.
The holy days follow, of which M. Doctor says that so they be not used
superstitiouflye, or unprofitably, they may be commanded. I have showed before
that they were, if they were so indifferent as they are made, yet being kept of
the Papists, which are the enemies of God, they ought to be abolished. And if
it were as easy a matter to pull out the superstition of the obseruyng of those
holidays out of men's hearts, as it is to protest and to teach that they are
not commanded for any Religion to be put in them, or for any to make
conscience of the observing of them, as though there were some necessary
worship of God, in the keeping of them: then were they much more tolerable,
but when as the continuance of them does nourishe wicked superstition in the
minds of men, and that the doctrine which should remedy the superstition
through the few^nesse and scarcity of able ministers, cannot come to the most
part of them which are infected with this disease, and that also where it is
preached, the fruit thereof is in part hyndred whylest the common people
attend oftentimes rather to that which is done, than to that which is taught,
being a thing indifferent (as it is said) it ought to be abolyshed, as that
which is not only not fyttest to hold the people in the sincere worshypping
of God, but also as that which keeps them in their former blyndnesse and
corrupt opinions, which they have conceived of such holidays.

Things that be good and profitable and have a necessary use, tending to the

edifying of the Church, and the worshyppyng of God, are not to be utterly
removed for the abuses crepte in, but the abuse must be taken away and the
thing still remain. If all things should be abrogated because they were kept
of the Papists, there would be a marvelous alteration, both in the Church
and in the common weal. But I have showed before how far this is from the
truth, even in some Tract. 7. ca. 5.
things invented by Popes, much more in such things as were agreed upon in
the primitive Church (as many of the holydays were) before the Popes tyranny,
though afterward greatly abused.

from superstition of the days them selves, but from all other kinds of
superstition whatsoever: for then is God in the public congregation truly
worshipped, the Sacraments rightly ministered, the scriptures and other godly
Homilies read, the word of God faithfully preached: all which be the chief
and principal means to withdraw men, not only from superstition, but all
kind of error likewise.

And if they had been never abused, neither by the Papists, nor by the Jews
(as they have been and are daily) yet such making of holidays is never
without some great danger of brynging in some evil and corrupt opinions into
the minds of men.

Io. Whitgifte.
Imaginations and gheasses may not go for reasons, and I have showed before
that the holidays now observed in the Church of England, be means to
root evil and corrupt opinions out of the hearts of men: so far are they
from ingendring the contrary.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 120. Lin. 5.
I will use an example in one, and that the chief of holidays, and most
generally, and of longest time observed in the Church, which is the feast of
Easter, which was kept of some more days, of some fewer. How many thousands
are there, I will not say of the ignorant Papists, but of those also which
profess the Gospel, which when they have celebrated those days with diligent
heed taken unto their life, and with some earnest devotion in praying and
hearing the word of God, do not by and by think that they have well
celebrated the feast of Easter, and yet have they thus notably deceived them
selves. For Saint Paul teaches the celebratyng of the feast of the 1. Cor. 5.
Christians Easter, is not as the Jews Easter was, for certain days, but
shows that we must keep this feast all the days of our life, in the
unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth, by which we see that the
observing of the feast of Easter for certain days in the year, does pull out
of our minds or ever we be aware, the doctrine of the Gospel, and causes
us to rest in that near consyderation of our duties for the space of a few
days, which should be extended to all our life.

Io. Whitgifte.
What? do you condemn the feast of Easter also? would you have it abrogated
The apostles observed Easter.
because it has been abused? do you not know that the Apostles them selves
observed it, and the Church ever sithence their time? read Eusebius lib. 5.
cap. 23. and you shall find it to be a tradition of the Apostles: per use the.
24. and 25. chapter of the same Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 23. 24. 29.
book, and you shall understand by the testimony of Polycrates, and all the
other bishops in Asia, that Philip the Apostle, John the Evangelist, Polycarpus
his scholar, and other bishops likewise of greatest antiquity, kept sole^ly
the feast of Easter. But why should I labor to prove that, that all histories,
all ancient fathers, al late writers, al learned men confess? and especially
seeing that S. Augustine ad Ianu. 119. says that the observation of Easter
has the authority from the scriptures, and seeing also that the same feast
with others is allowed by the confession of the Churches in Heluetia? The
words of which confession be these. Moreover if Churches, as they may by
Christian liberty Confess. Helue.
keep religiouslye the remembrance of Christ his birth, circumcision,
passion, resurrection, ascension into heaven, and sending his holy ghost unto
his disciples, we well allow it. Therefore I cannot but marueyle, that you so
boldly without ground, for abuse sake, condemn even the feast used and
allowed by the Apostles, and continued in the Church without contradiction, of
any one worthy of credit, to this day. Surely you may as well reason that the
scriptures are not to be read, because that heretics have so greatly abused
them.

Th place of S. Paul. 1. Cor. 5. is nothing to your purpose, for though he
borrows a Metaphor of the Jews passover, to move the Corinthia^s to pureness
and integrity of life, yet does he not abrogate the feast of Easter: if he
had meant any such thing (as he did not) yet must it have been understood of
the Jews passover, not of celebration of the memory of Christ's
resurrection, which we commonly call Easter. Does he that says the whole
life of a Christian man ought to be a perpetual fast, deny that there may
be any day or time appointed to fast in? A Christian man must ever serve
God and worship him, shall there not therefore be certain days appointed
for the same? This is a very simple argument. Saint Paul wylleth us to purge
out the old leven, that we may be a new lump. etc. also to keep the feast
not with old leven, neither with the leven of malitiousnesse. etc. therefore
we may not celebrate the feast of Easter, once in the year. I deny this
argument.

The observing of Easter, does rather put us in mind of the doctrine of the
Gospel, and draw us to a more nere consyderation of the benefits that we
have received by the death, passion and resurrection of Christ, and I suppose
that there are few godly disposed Christians, that do not think it most
convenient and profitable, that such feasts especially should be in the
Church retained, neither is every contentious persons imagination and surmyse
what may happen, to be so greatly regarded, that it should be sufficient
to condemn any thing, that may have a profitable use in the Church, by
whom so ever it is invented, much less if it has been used of the Apostles
them selves, and ever sythence their time continued in the Church, as I have
showed this feast to have been. The weakness of man is great, therefore as
he is continuallye to be taught that he should at all times remember his
duty, so is it very necessary to have certain feasts wherein by the
readyng and hearing of the Scriptures, men may be particularlye styrred to the
remembrance and deep consyderation of the principal parts of our Religion,
and the good and godly examples of the Saints of God in doing their duty
therein.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.

But besides the incommodities that vyse of making such holidays, and
continuyng of those which are so horribly abused, where it is confessed that
they are not necessary: besides this I say the matter is not so indifferent as
it is made, I confess that it is in the power of the Church, to appoint so
many days in the week or in the year, in the which the congregation shall
assemble to hear the word of God, and receive the Sacraments, and offer up
prayers unto God, as it shall think good, according to those rules which are
before alleged. But that it has power to make so many holidays (as we
have) wherein no man may work any part of the day, and wherein men are
commanded to cease from their daily vocations, of Plowyng, and exercisyng
their handye crafts. etc. that I deny to be in the power of the church. For
proof whereof, I will take the fourth commandment and no other
interpretation of it than M. Doctor allows of in the. 174. page, which is,
that God lycenseth and leaves it at the liberty of every man to work six
days in the week, so that he rest the seventh day. Seeing that therefore, that
the Lord has left it to all men at liberty, that they might labor, if they
think good six days: I say the Church, nor You draw from the Magistrate
his law^ authority, and give to the people too much carnal liberty.
no man can take away this liberty from them, and drive them to a necessary
rest of the body.

Io. Whitgifte.
The same God that gave that liberty in that commandment, did appoint other
solemn feast days besides the Sabbath: as the feast of Easter, of Pentecoste,
of Tabernacles. etc. without any restraynte of this liberty. Therefore the
interpretation given by me page. 174. of that place, does not leave it to
every private man's free liberty, against the authority of the Magistrate, or
of the Church, but it gives liberty rather to such as be in authority, and
to the Church to appoint therein what shall be convenient.

The Magistrate has power and authority over his subjects in all external

matters, and bodily affairs: Wherefore he may call them from bodily labor,
or compel them unto it, as shall be thought to him most convenient. The
liberty that God gives to man, which no man ought to take from him, nor can
if he would, is liberty of conscience, and not of worldly affairs. In bodily
business he is to be governed by Magistrates and laws. This doctrine of yours
is very licentious, and tends too much to carnal and corporal liberty,
and in deed is a very perilous doctrine for all states. Not one title in Gods
word does constrayne either the Magistrate, or the Church from turning
carnal liberty to the spiritual service of God, or bodily labor to divine
worship, as those do that cause men to abstain from corporal labor, that
they may hear the word of God, and worship him in the congregation.

And why may not the Church as well restrain them from working any part
of the day, as it may do the most part of it, for you confess, that it is
in the power of the Church to appoynte so many days in the week, or in the
year, in the which the congregation should assemble to hear the word of
God, and receive the Sacraments, and offer up prayers unto God, as it shall
think good, according to those rules which are before alleged: and this it
can not do, unless in the same days during all that time, (which is no
small portion of the day) it restrain them from bodily labor.

Wherefore this being no commandment, that they shall labor six days in
the week, but a signification that so many days they may labor: as the same
God that gave this commandment has done before in the old law, so may
the Churches likewise for the increase of godliness and virtue, and
edification, appoint some of those six days, to be bestowed in prayers,
hearing the word, administration of the sacraments, and other holy actions.

Chap. 1. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 120. about the midst.
And if it be lawful to abridge the liberty of the Church in this point,
and in stead that the Lord says: Six days thou may labor if thou
will, to say, Thou shalt not labor six days: I do not see why the
Church may not as well, where as the Lord says, thou shall rest the
seventh day, command, that thou shalt not rest the seventh day: for if the
Church may restrain the liberty that God has given them, it may take away
the yoke also that God has put upon them.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Church is not abridged of her liberty in this point, but uses her
liberty in appoynting some of these days to the worshipping of GOD, and the
instruction of his people: which should not be counted a bondage or servitude
to any man.

To rest the seventh day is commanded: to labor six days is but permitted:
he that for bids rest on the seventh day, does directly against the
commandment: so does not he that restrayneth men from bodily labor in any
of the six days, and therefore the reason is not like. And yet the
commandment of bodily rest upon the seventh day, in sundry cases may of a
man's self, much more at a lawful commandment of a Magistrate in necessity
be broken.

In things indifferent private men's wills are subject to such as have
authority over them, therefore they ought to consent to their determination in
such matters, except they will show them selves to be wilful, which is a
great fault, and deserves much punishment.

But hitherto you have not replied to any Answer made to the Admonition.

Chap. 1. the. 6. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 173. in the latter end.
This is no restraynt for any man from serving of God any day in the week
else. For the Jews had diverse other feasts, which they by Gods appointment
observed, notwithstanding these words, Six days. etc.

T. C. Page 120. Sect. 1.
And where as you say in the. 173. page, that notwithstanding this fourth
commandment, the Jews had certain other feasts which they observed: In
deed the Lord which gave this general law, might make as many exceptions
as he thought good, and so long as he thought good: but it follows not
because the Lord did it, that therefore the Church may do it, unless it
has commandment and authority from God so to do. As when there is any
general plague or judgment of God, either upon the Church, or coming
toward it, the Lord commands in such a case, that they should sanctify
a general fast, and proclayme ghnatsarah, which signifies 2. Joel.
a prohibition or forbydding of ordinary works, and is the same Hebrew word
wherewith those feast days are noted in the law, wherein they should rest: the
reason of which commandment of the Lord was, that as they abstayned that day,
as much as might be conveniently from meat, so they might abstain from their
daily works, to the end they might bestow the whole day in hearing the word
of God, and humbling them selves in the congregation, confessyng their faults,
and desiring the Lord to turn away from his fearce wrath. In this case the
Church having commandment to make a holyday, may and ought to do it, as
the Church which was in Babylon did, during the time of their captivity. But
where it is destitute of a commandment, it may not presume by any decree to
restrain that liberty which the Lord has given.

Io. Whitgifte.
When you are convinced by manifest Scripture, as you are in this matter, then
you fly to your newly devised distinctions, as you do in this place, saying:
The Lord which gave this general law, might make as many exceptions as he
thought good, but to no purpose, for you can not show in the whole Scripture,
where God has made any law or ordinance against his own commandment. And
surely in this point you have greatly ouershotte your self, being content
rather to grant contrariety to be in the Scripture, than to yield to a
manifest and known truth. The Church in appoynting holidays, does follow
the example of God him self, and therefore Tract. 2.
has sufficient ground and warrant for her doings, and of the authority of
the Church No man's liberty restreyned.
in such matters I have spoken in an other place: And I have also a little
before declared, what kind of liberty the Church may not restrain: and I
add that every private man's consent, is in the consent of ye Church, as it is
in the consent of the Parliament, The Replyer brings authority against him
self.
and therefore no man's liberty otherwise restrained than he has consented unto.

That in the second of the Prophet Ioell makes against you directly: for it
shows that upon just occasion, the Church may inhibite men from labor
even in the sire days, notwithstanding it be said, Six days thou shalt
labor. etc. And to The Jews aponynted to them selves holy days*
the intent no man should doubt of the liberty of the Church heerem, or of
the practice of this liberty, let the nynthe chapter of Esther be perused, and
therein it will appear that in remembrance of their great delivery from the
treason of Haman, the Jews by the commandment of Mordecai, did solemnize and
keep holydaye the fourtenth and fyftenth day of the month Ader, every year.
But if neither the ordinances of God himself, nor the words of his Prophets,
nor the examples of his Apostles, nor the practice of his Church from the
beginning will take any place with you, you are no man for me to deal with.

Of Saints days.
Chap. 2. the. 1. Division.
T. C. Page. 120. Sect. vlt.
Now that I have spoken generally of holydays, I come unto the Apostles and
other saints days, which are kept with us. And though it were lawful for
the Church to ordain holidays to our savior Christ, or to the blessed
Trinity, yet it is not therefore lawful to institute holidays to the
Apostles and other Samctes, or to their remembrance. For although I confess
as much as you say in the. 153. page, that the Church of England does not
mean by this keeping of holidays, that the Saints should be honored, or as
you allege in. 175. and 176. pages, that with us the Saints are not prayed
unto, or that it does propounde them as meritorious, yet that is not inoughe.
For as we reason against the Popish purgatory, that it is therefore naught,
for as much as neither in the old Testament, nor in the new, there is any
mention of prayer at any time for the dead, Argum. ab auth ritate nogatiue.
so may it be reasoned against these holidays ordained for the remembrance of
the Saints, that for so much as the old people did never keep any feast or
holyday for ye remembrance either of Moses, or Daniel, or Job, or Abraham, or
David, or any other how holy or excellent soever they were: nor the Apostles,
nor the Churches in their time never* instituted any, either to keep the
remembrance of Stephen, or of the Uirgin Mary, or of John Baptist, or of any
other notable and rare personage, that the instituting and erecting of them
now, and this attempt by the Churches which followed, which have not such
certain and undoubted interpreters of the will of God, as the Prophets and
Apostles were, which lived in those Churches, is not without some note of
presumption, for that it undertakes those things which the Primitive Church
in the Apostles times (having greater gifts of the spirit of God, than they
that followed them had) durst not venture upon.

Io. Whitgifte.
Purgatory is made a matter of salvation or damnation, as all other doctrines
of the Popes be: and therefore a negative reason (such as you use) is
sufficient inoughe to improve it: But holidays in our Church have no such
necessity ascribed unto them, only they are thought very profitable to the
edifying of Gods people, and therefore such negative reasons prevail not
against them, no more than they do against other constitutions of the Church
perteyning to edifying, order, or comeliness, whereof there is no mention made
in the word of God. And therefore nothing that is here spoken by you can take
any hold.

respect, than that the Scriptures which that day are read in the Church,
be concerning that Saint, and conteyne either his calling, preaching,
persecution, martyrdom, or such like.

T. C. Page 121. Sect. 1.
Moreover, I have showed before, what force the name of every thing has, to
cause men to think so of every thing, as it is named, and therefore although
you say in the. 175. page that in calling these holidays the days of such
or such a Saint, there is nothing else inent, but that the Scriptures which
are that day read concern that Saint, and conteyne either his calling,
preaching, persecution, Martyrdom. etc. yet every one does not understand so
much. For besides that the corrupt custom of Popery has carried their
minds to an other interpretation, the very name and appellation of the day
teaches otherwise. For seeing that by the days dedicated to the Trinity, and
those that are consecrate to our savior Christ, are in that they be called
Trinity day, or the Nativity day of our savior Christ by and by taken to
be instituted to the honor of our savior Christ, and of the Trinity, so
likewise the people when it is called saint Paul's day, or the blessed Uirgin
Mary's day, can understand nothing thereby, but that they are instituted to
the honor of saint Paul, or of the Uyrgin Mary, unless they be otherwise
taught. And if you say, let them so be taught, I have answered, that the
teaching in this land, can not by any order which is yet taken, come to the
most part of those which have drunk this poison, and where it is taught,
yet were it good that the names were abolished, that they should not help to
vnteache that which the preaching teaches in this behalf.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have so dismembered my book, in taking here a piece and there a piece, to
answer as it pleases you, and in leaving out what you list, that you rather
make a new discourse of your own, than a Reply to any thing that I have set
down.

Touching the names of the holidays (which you mislike) I have told the
cause why they be so called, which cause you can not improve, and therefore
you fall again to your accustomed conjectures, and suppositions, which are
but very simple and slender arguments. What if every one does not understand
so much? must the Church alter her decrees and orders, for every particular
man's abusing or not understanding them? He that is most ignorant may learn
and know why they be so called, if he be disposed: if he be not, the fault is
his own, the name of the day is not the worse to be lyked. You might much
better reason against the names of Sunday, Monday, and Saturday, which be
Heathenishe and profane names, yet I suppose that there is no man so mad, as
to think that those days be instituted and used of Christians to the honor
of the Sun, of the Moon, and of Saturn. This is but to play the part of a
quareller (as I have sundry times told you) to cavil at the name, when you
can not reprove the matter. Those days be rather retained in the Church, to
root out such superstitious opinions, by the preaching of the word, and the
reading of the Scriptures: Neither can any man that understands English, and
frequenteth the common and public prayers, in those holidays (except he be
wilful) be so affected as you seem to suspect.

Trinity sunday, the Nativity of our Savior Christ, and such like,
although we honor the Trinity, and our Savior Christ in them, as we do in
all other, yet have they their names especially, because the Scriptures then
read in the Church, concern the Trinity, and the Nativity of our Savior
Christ. Augustine ad Ianuar. 119. says thus of the day of the Nativity of
Christ: Here first August.
it behooves that thou know the day of the Nativity of the Lord, not to be
celebrated in a Sacrament or figure, but only that it is called back into
remembrance, that he is borne, and for this there needs nothing, but that
the day yearly be signified by solemn devotion, wherein the thing was done.

There is no place in this land so destitute of instructions, either by
preaching or reading, that any man can justly plead ignorance in such
matters, and therefore seeing you have no other arguments against holidays,
but conjectures, and surmises, and they false and untrue, or at the least not
sufficient to alter a profitable order in the Church, holidays may still
remain and stand in their former force and strength.

Furthermore seeing the holidays be ceremonies of the Church, I see not why

to have more than double as many holidays as they had. And as for all the
commodities which we receive by them, whereby M. Doctor goes about to prove
the goodness and lawfulness of their institution, as that the Scriptures are
there read and expounded, the patience of those Saints in their persecution
and martyrdom, is to the edifying of the Church remembered, and yearly
renewed. I say that we might have all those commodities without all those
dangers which I have spoken of, and without any keeping of yearly memory of

of the keeping of Easter, that it tyeth, and (as it were) fettereth a
meditation of the Easter to a sewe days, which should reach to all our age
and time of our life: so those celebrations of the memories of Saints and
Martyrs, streyghten our consideration of them unto those days which should
continually be thought of, and daily as long as we live. And if that it be
thought so good and profitable a thing that this remembrance of them should
be upon those days wherein they are supposed to have dyed, yet it follows
not therefore, that after this remembrance is celebrated by hearing the
Scriptures concerning them, and prayers made to follow their constancy, that
all the rest of the day should be kept holy in such sort, as men should be
debarred of their bodily labors, and of exercising their daily vocations.

used in particular Churches, neither grounded of the Scriptures, determined by
Councels, nor confirmed by the custom of the whole Church. But the holidays
that we reteyne, being not only confirmed by the custom of the whole
Church, but also profitable for the instruction of the people, and used for
public prayer, administration of the Sacraments, and preaching the word, can
not be called burdens, except it be a burden to serve God in praying, in
celebrating his sacraments, and in hearing his word.

And whereas you say, that if their holydays and ours be accounted, we shall be
found to have The Jews had me holidays than we.
more tha^ double as many holydays as they had, you speak that which you are
not able to justify. In the. 23, of Leuiticus there is appointed unto the
Jews the feast of Easter: the feast of unleavened bread: the feast of first
fruits: Whitsontide: the feast of trumpets: the feast of reconciliation, and
the feast of Tabernacles: whereof the feast of unleavened bread, and the feast
of Tabernacles had each of them seven days annexed unto them. And if you will
add to these, Iudiths feast, chap. 16. the Machabies feast. 1. Macha. chap. 4.
which continued eight days together, and Hesters feast, chap. 9. which
continued two days, you shall find that our holidays be some what short in
number of theirs: so far are we from having more than double as many as they
had. But your spirit is acquaynted with such untrue assertions.

But you say, we might have all these commodities without all those dangers.
etc. and why not as well this way which the whole Church has from time to
time allowed, as that way which certain particular persons, of their own
heads have devised? There is nothing that you have to say against these
days, but only their names, and that those memories of Martyrs strayghten our
consideration of them unto those days, etc. and that men be inhibited from
bodily labor, to serve God: al which I have answered before, and the latter in
part you confess: for you would have certain days appointed for public
prayer, the celebration of the sacraments, and hearing the word, and you seem
not to deny but that the remembrance of Saints and Martyrs may be kept, only
you mislike, that in the rest of the day men should be debarred from their
bodily labors, and exercising their daily vocations. Well I perceeue that
something you would find fault with, if you knew what. They are not so
bound from labor (as it appears in the laws of this Church) but that they
may do their necessary business: and in deed they are so far from
scrupulositie in this point, that all the punishments appointed can not keep
a number of them from their worldly affairs, not in the very time of public
prayers, and preaching of the word: and yet I see no cause why they may not
justly be wholly debarred (except some urgent occasion require sometime the
contrary) from their bodily labors in such days: for are not the
householders bound of duty as well to instruct their families, as the Pastor
is bound to instruct them? and when is there a more convenient time than in
such days? If you have such a regard to their worldly affairs, is it not
more commodious for them to abstain wholly from work upon these Holidays,
when they fall, than twice or thrice every week half the day? Therefore this
reason of yours as it is worldly, so is it weak, both in the respect of God,
and of the world also.

Your imagination that the keeping of Easter does fetter the meditation of
Easter to a A bayne reason.
few days. etc. and so likewise the rest of the Holidays, I have answered
before, it is a most vain reason, and you might as well say, that there
ought to be no certain times appointed for the receiving of the holy
Communion, because the meditation of the death and passion of Christ, and the
application of the same, is fettered to these certain days, which should
continually be thought of, and daily as long as we live. The same might you
say likewise of the Sabbath day. But you ought to know that the especial
celebrating of the memory of Christ's resurrection, once in the year, is no
more a fettering of our meditation thereof to that day only, than the
receiving of the Communion once in the month, is a strayghting of our
consideration of the death and passion of Christ, to that time only, wherein
we receive the holy Sacrament: By this reason of yours we must either have
such memories celebrated at all times, or at no time. But wise men can
consider how far you wander for want of reason.

sort: If it be not lavvfull to observe days, months, times, and years, we
also fall into the like fault which observe the passion of Christ, the Sabbath
day, and the time of Lent, the feasts of Easter, and of Pentecoste, and other
times appointed to Martyrs, according to the manner and custom of every nation,
to the which he that will answer simply, will say, that our observing of
days is not the same with the Jewish observing, for we do not celebrate
the feast of unleavened bread, but of the resurrection and death of Christ.
etc. And least the confused gathering together of the people should diminishe
the faith in Christ, therefore certain days are appointed that we might all
meet together in one place, not because those days be more holy, but to the
intent that in what day soever we meet, we may rejoice to see one another.
etc.

Augustine in like manner Lib. 18. de ciuitate Dei, cap. 27. says, That we

truth, even to death. etc.

The same Augustine in his book Contra Adamantum Manachaei Discip. ca. 16.
expounding the words of the Apostle: Ye observe days, years and times,
writes thus. But one may think that he speaks of the Sabbath: do not we
say that those times ought not to be observed, but the things rather that are
signified by them? for they did observe them seruilely, not understanding what
they did signify and prefigurate, this is that that the Apostle reproves in
the^, and in all those that serve the creature rather than the Creator: for we
also, solemnly celebrate the Sabbath day, and Easter, and all other festival
days of Christians: but because we understand whereunto they do appertain,
we observe not the times but those things which are signified by the times,
etc.

T. C Page 122. Sect. 1.
Now whereas M. Doctor cites Augustine and Jerome to prove that in the
Churches in their times, there were holy days kept besides the Lords day, he
might have also cyted Ignatius, and Tertullian, and Cyprian, which are of
greater aunctencie, and would have made more for the credit of his cause,
seeing he measures all his truth almost through the whole book, by the
crooked measure and yard of time. For it is not to be denied but this keeping
of Holidays (especially of the Easter and Pentecoste) are very ancient, and
that these holidays, for the remembrance of Martyrs were used of long time,
but these abuses were no auncienter than other were, grosser also than this
was, as I have before declared and were easy further to be showed if need
required, and therefore An unlearned shifte.
I appeal from these examples to the Scriptures, and to the examples of the
perfectest Church that ever was, which was that in the Apostles times.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know that I might have alleged many other authorities for the proof of

this matter, but I thought these two sufficient (as they be in deed) in such
a matter as this is, and your lightly rejecting of them will win no credit
to your cause, among wise and learned men. You may easily perceive by the
words of both these Authors that these days in their time were rightly and
without all superstition used. But you do well to appeal from these examples,
and from all other ancient authority of learned men: for you know full
well your lack of ability to maynteyne this and other your opinions by the
testimonies of ancient writers: nay you can not but confess that the old
learned Fathers are utterly against you, which is the cause why you appeal
from them: but it is an unlearned shirt.

And yet also I have to say that the observation of those feasts, first of
all was much better than of later times. For Socrates confesting that neither
our Savior Christ, nor the Apostles li. 5. ca. 22.
did decree or institute any holidays, or lay any yoke of bondage upon the
necks of those which came to the preaching, adds further that they did use
first to observe the holidays by custom, and Socrates words untruly
reported.
that as every man was disposed at home: which thing if it had remained in that
freedom, that it was done by custom and not by commandment, at the will of
every one, and not by constraynt, it had been much better than it is now, and
had not drawn such dangers upon the posterity, as did after ensue and we
have the experience of.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely they were never better, nor more pure from al supersticion, and other
errors than they be now in this Church: and therefore in that respect there
is no cause to complain.

You do not truly report Socrates words, nor yet his meaning, for he does not
say Socrat. Lib. ^. Cap* 22.
that every man at home kept those days as he was disposed: but thus he
says, Wherefore neither the Apostle, nor the Gospel, do at any time lay a
yoke of bondage upon them, which come unto the preaching of the Gospel, but
men themselves every one in their country, according as they thought good,
celebrated the feast of Easter, and other holidays of custom, for the
intermission of their labors, and remembrance of the healthful passion: his
meaning is not, that every private man in his own house kept Easter, and the
other feasts as him lysted: but that every Church appointed such an order and
time for the same, as it thought convenient: and that this is his meaning, that
which follows in that Chapter, and expresses his own opinion of this
matter, does evidently declare. His words be these: Surely I am of this
opinion, that as many other things in diverse places have been brought in of
custom, so the feast of Easter had a private or peculiar observation with
every particular people of custom, because none of the Apostles (as I have
said) did make any law hereof, etc. For his whole drifte is to prove that the
feast of Easter concerning the day and time, was diversely observed in diverse
Churches and Countries: but he neither can prove, nor goes about to prove,
that there was any Church wherein it was not observed. And I have before
declared that the feast of Easter was observed by the Apostles, and sithence
that time continued.

Other reformed Churches also have days ascribed to Sainets Bullinger.
as well as we, as it may appear by these words of Bullinger writing Observing
of holidays in other reformed churches
upon the. 14. to the Romans In the ancient vvriters, as Eusebius and Augustine,
thou may find certain memorials appointed to certain holy men, but
after an other manner, not much differing from ours which we as yet reteyne
in our Church of Tigurie, for we celebrate the nativity of Christ, his
Circumcision, Resurrection, and Ascension, the coming of the holy Ghost, the
feasts also of the virgin Mary, John Baptiste, Magdalene, Stephen, and the
other Apostles: yet not condemning those which observe none, but only the
Sabbath day. For perusing old Monumentes, we find that this has alvvayes
been left free to the Churches, that every one should follow that in these
things, that should be most best and convenient.

M. Bucer in his Epistle to master Alasco, speaking of holidays, Bucer.
says: That in the Scriptures there is no express commandment of them: it
is gathered notvvithstanding ( says he) from the example of the old people,
that they are profitable for us, to the increase of godliness, which thing
also experience proves.

To be short, Illyricus writing upon the fourth to the Galat. makes Observing
of days considered four ways.
this division of observing days and times.

The first is natural, as of somer, spryng time, winter, etc. time of
planting, time of sovvyng, time of reaping, etc. 1
The second is civil. 2
The third Ecclesiastical, as the Sabbath day, and other days, wherein 3
is celebrated the memory of the chief histories or acts of Christ, which
be profitable for the instruction of the simple, that they may the better
remember when the Lord was borne, when he suffered, when he ascended up
into heaven, and be further taught in the same. The fourth superstitious, when
we put a necessity, worshipping, merit 4
or righteousness in the observing of time: and this kind of observing days
and times is only forbidden in this place.
Thus you see by the judgments of all these learned men, that days
ascrybed unto Saints, is no such matter, as ought to make men separate
themselves from the Church, and absteyne from allowing by subscription, so
worthy and godly a book, as the book of common prayer is, much less to make
a Schism in the Church for the same.

T. C. Page 122. Sect. 2. 3.
As touching M. Bucers, M. Bullingers, and Illyricus allowance of them, if they
mean such a celebration of them, as that in those days the people may be
assembled, and those parts of the Scriptures which concern them whose
remembrance is solemnised, read and expounded, and yet men not debarred after
from their daily works, it is so much the less matter: if otherwise that good
leave they give the Churches to dissent from them in that point. I do take it
granted unto me, being by the grace of God one of the Church.

Although as touching M. Bullinger, it is to be observed, since the time that
he wrote that upon the Romans, there are about. 35. years, sithence which
time although he hold still that the feasts kept unto the Lord, as of the
Nativity, Easter and Pentecoste, dedicated unto the Lord may be kept, yet he
demeth flatly, that it is lawful to keep holy the days of the Apostles, as
Confessio Ecclesiae Tigur. and alianim Eccles. cap. 24.
it appears in the confession of the Tiguryne Church joined with others.

Io. Whitgifte.
How perfect an Answer this is, to these learned men's authorities, let the
learned Reader judge. You are not a Church, but a member of the Church, and
therefore seeing the matter is such as the Church may take an order in, you
ought to submit your self to the determination of that Church in such
matters, whereof you are a member.

What M. Bullinger has in any other place consented unto, I know not, but
certain it is that these be his own words, And that when he writ them he
was of the same opinion that we are at this time in this Church of England.

Chap. 2. the. 7. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 177. Sect. 2.
Calvin in like manner writing upon the fourth to the Galatians, Calvin.
does not disallow this kind of observing days, his words be these: When as
holiness is attributed to days, when as one day is discerned from an other
for religion sake, when days are made a piece of divine worship, then days
are wickedly observed, etc. But when we have a difference of days, laying
no burden of necessity on men's consciences, we make no difference of days,
as though one were more holy than an other, we put no religion in them, nor
worshipping of God, but only we observe them for order and concord sake, so
that the observing of days with us is free, and without all superstition.
And again upon the. 2. to the Colloss. But some will say, that we as yet
have some kind of observing days: I answer that we observe them not, as
though there were any religion in them, or as though it were not then
lavvfull to labor, but we have a respect of pollycie and orders, not of
days. And in his Institutions upon the fourth commandment, Neither do I so
speak of the seventh day, that I would bind the Church only unto it, for I
do not condemn those Churches which have other solemn days to meet in, so
that they be void of superstition, which shall be if they be ordained only
for the observing of discipline and order.

T. C. Page 122. Sect. 4.
As for M. Calvin, at the practice of him and the Church where he lined was
and i^, to admit no one holy day besides the Lords day, so can it not be
showed out of any part of his works (as I think) that he approved those holy
days which are now in question. He says in deed in his Institution: that
he will not condemn those Churches which use them: no more do we the Church
of England, neither in this nor in other things which are meet to be
reformed. For it is one thing to mistike, an other thing to condemn, and it is
one thing to condemn some thing in the Church, and an other to condemn the
Church for it. And as for the places cited out of the Epistle to the
Galatians, and Collossians, there is no mention of any holidays either to
Saints, or to any other, and it appears also that he defends not other
Churches, but the church of Geneua, and answers not to those which obiecte
against the keeping of Saints days, or any holidays (as they are called)
besides the Lords day, but against those which would not have the lords
day kept still as a day of rest from bodily labor, as it may appear both by
his place upon the Collossians, and especially in that which is alleged out of
his Institutions: and that he means nothing less, than such holidays as you
take upon you to detende, it may appear first in the place of the Collossians,
where he says, that the days of rest which are used of them are used for
policy sake. Now it is well known, that as it is pollycie and a way to
preserve the estate of things and to keep them in a good continuance and
success, that as well the beasts as the men which labor six days should
rest the seventh: so it tends to no policy nor wealth of the people, or
preservation of good order, that there should be so many days, wherein men
should cease from work, being a thing which breeds idleness, and
consequently poverty, besides other disorders and vices, which always go in
company with idleness. And in the place of his Institutions he declares
himself yet more plainly when he says, that those odd holidays, then are
without superstition, when they be ordained only for the observing of
discipline and order, whereby he gives to understand, that he would have them
no further holidays, than for the time which is bestowed in the exercise of
the discipline and order of the church, and that for the rest, they should be
altogether as other days free to be labored in. And so it appears, that the
holidays ascribed unto Saints by the service book, is a just cause why a
man cannot safely without exception subscribe unto the service book.

Io. Whitgifte.
What soever M Caluines practice was in the Church of Geneua, yet in these
places does his judgment evidently appear, neither does a man always use
that himself, which he allows in an other: for there may be circumstances to
make that commendable in one place, that is not so in an other.

He that condemns the thing as unlawful, must also condemn the Churches
that use the same, though not wholly, yet in that point. For as much therefore
as M. Calvin did not condemn other Churches for observing such days, it is
a manifest argument that he condemned not the observing of those days in those
Churches. In deed it is one thing to mislike, an other thing to condemn, but
he that makes such a stir in the Church for these matters, as you do, and
that so disorderly, can not be said only to mislyke, but also to condemn.

The place of M. Calvin, out of the Epistle to the Galat. is not mente only
of the Lords day, but of other days also observed in other reformed
Churches, and in that place he makes a general answer as it were for them
all, as it is soon perceived by such as will read that place. He also that
shall per use his words upon the second chapter to the Collossians, shall
find the like sense in them. In that he says they be used for order and
policy, we do not dissent from him, but think so in like manner, howbeit
we understand as he does Ecclesiastical order and policy, for in the
words that go before the place to the Galatians, he says, that the observing
of days does also perteyne, ad Regimen Ecclesiae, to the government Calvin.
in 4. Gal.
of the Church. What better order and policy can there be, than to have
certain days appointed wherein the people may rest from bodily labor, to
labor spiritually, to hear the word of God, etc. which M. Calvin called
order and policy, and not the external rest of the Sabbath day, which is a
commandment of God, and no constitution of the Church, neither has the
Church any respect to worldly policy in appoynting of Holidays, but to
Ecclesiastical policy, which consists in hearing the words, ministering
the Sacraments, public Prayers, and other such like godly actions.

The place in his Institutions, convince all your shifting conjectures of mere
folly, for therein he plainly declares his allowing in other Churches of ^o
Holidays than the Sunday, which you have denied to be his opinion in the
former two places. I have told you what he means by discipline and order or
policy: whereby he gives to understand nothing less than that which you
would conclude, being but your own devise to serve for a poor shifte at a
need. And although the matter is not great, whether they labor or no, yet
the law of the Prince, and the order of the Church is to be observed. And so
it appears that there is no reasonable cause as yet proved, why you ought not
to subscribe to the service Book.

In the end you add: (patched if not altogether, yet the greatest piece out
of the Popes Portuis.)

To this I answer briefly, it makes no matter of whom it was invented, in
what Book it is contained: so that it be good and profitable, and consonant to
Gods word. Well says Ambrose, Omne verum a quocunque dicitur a spiritu
Sancto est. All truth, of whom soever it is spoken is of the holy ghost.

T. C. Page 123. Lin. 6.
Now whereas M. Doctor says, it makes no matter wither these things be
taken out of the Portuis, so they be good etc. I have proved first they are not
good, then if they were yet being not necessary, and abused horribly by the
Papists, other being as good and better than they, ought not to remain in the
church.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your reasons be not sufficient to prove them not to be good: the abuse has
not been such, but that it being removed, the thing may still remain as
profitable and The (...) be (...) to (...) judgment.
convenient: the judgment of the Church in determining what is best and most
fittest in matters of order, policy, and government (not being against the

imagination.

And as for Ambrose saying, all truth of whom soever it be said, is of the
holy ghost: if I were disposed to move questions, I could demand of him
which cares not of whom he have Mark. 1.
the truth, so he have it, what our Savior Christ meant to refuse the
testimony of Devils, when they gave a clear testimony* that he was the Son
of God, and the holy one? And what S. Paul meant to be angry, and to take it
so grievously, that the Pithonisse said, he and his companion Act. 16.
were the servants of the high God, which preached unto them the way of
salvation? Here* was truth and yet rejected, and I would know whether M.
Doctor would say, that these spoke by the spirit of God. Thus whilst without
all judgment, he snatcheth here a sentence and there another out of the
Doctoures, and that of the worste, as if a man should of purpose choose out the
brosse, and leave the silver, within a while he will make no great difference,
not only between the Prophets and Apostles, and profane writers, as
Aristotle, and Plato, but not between them and those, which speak not by the
conduyte and leading of the holy ghost, but by the violent thrusting of the
wicked spirit.

Io. Whitgifte.
Christ liked not the truth being uttered of the Devil, because he spoke it
of an evil meaning: but he liked very well the same testimony of truth
afterward uttered by Peter sincerely. Math. 16. Mar. 8. Neither did he
mislike the words because they were abused by the Devil before. But I will
leave Devils, and speak of men, of whom I think Ambrose mente, although the
truth is truth of whom soever it is uttered: but to Answer for Ambrose: he
has said nothing in that sentence which may not be justified.

M. Calvin ( upon these words, 1. Corinthians. 12. And no man can say that
Jesus is the Calvin.
Lord, but by the holy Ghost) says thus. It may be demanded, whether the
wicked have the Spirit of God, seeing they sometime testify plainly and well
of Christ. I answer that there is no doubt but that they have, so much as
concerns that effect: but it is an other thing to have the gift of
regeneration, than to have the gift of bare understanding, wherewith Judas was
endued, when he preached the Gospel.

M. Martyr also upon the same words, after he has recited the opinions of
other, P. Martyr.
makes this resolution. But when I weygh this matter with my self, I perceive
that the Apostle here does speak, not of the Spirit which does regenerate,
or of that grace which justifies, but of the gifts which are freely given
which may happen as well to the good as to the evil. Therefore I think that
Paul spoke simply, that he might declare, that by what means soever we speak
well of Christ, it is of the holy Ghost, of whom Omne verum a spiritu sancto
est.
comes all truth, as all untruth proceeds of the Devil who is the father
of lies. You see therefore that Ambrose is not of this judgment alone, and
that his saying is very true.

The Doctoures that I have used, in this cause, be Jerome and Augustine, which
be not the worst, but comparable with the best. I have rehearsed out of them
whole sentences, and perfect, the which you are not able to answer: the rest
of your opprobrious words, wherewith you conclude this question of holy
days, I leave for other to consider of, as notes of your spirit.

And to the intent that the Reader may understand, that it was not for naught,
that you set not down my Book together with your Reply, I will here set
down such portions of my book touching this matter, as you have not answered
unto, but closely passed over, not thinking that any man should have espied
your lack of ability to answer them.

They should first prove that holy days ascribed to Sayncts, prescript

Answer to the Admonition. Page 153. Sect. 4. and Page 154. Sect. 1.
Holy days ascribed to Saints, wherein not the Saints, but God is
honored, and the people edified, by reading and hearing such stories and
places of Scripture, as perteyne to the martyrdom, calling* and function of
such Saints, or any other thing mentioned of them in Scripture, must needs
be according to Gods word. For to honor God, to worship him, to be edified by
the stories and examples of Saints out of the Scripture, cannot be but
consonant to the Scripture. The prescript secuice for them is all taken out of
Gods word, and not one piece thereof, but it is most consonant unto the same.
If there be any that is repugnant, set it down, that we may understand it.

I told you before, that touching the days and times and other Ceremonies,
the church has authority to determine what is most convenient, as it has
done from time to time. S. August. in his epistle Augustine.
ad Ian. in ye place before of me recited says, that the passion of Christ,
his resurrection, his asce^tion, and the day of the coming of the holy ghost
(which we commonly call Whitsontide) is celebrated, not by any commandment
written, but by the determination of the church. And it is the judgment of al
learned writers, that the church has authority in these things so that
nothing be done against the word of God. But of this I have spoken partly
before, and intend to speak more largely thereof in the place following, where
you again make mention of it.

this, that seeing God has permitted unto us six days to do our own works in, we
ought the seventh day wholly to serve him.

Every man has not bodily labor to do, but may serve God as well in these six
days, as in the seventh. And certainly he does not by any means break this
commandment, which absteineth in any of these six days from bodily labor to
serve god* For this is the commandment, Remember that thou keep holy the
Sabbath day: as for this ( Six days thou shall work) is no commandment, but
tends rather to the constitution of the Saboth, tha^ to the prohibiting of

he should say: Six days thou may work: and so do some translate the Hebrewe
word.

The place alleged out of the first of Esaias is far from the purpose, there is

considered, First, that their Saints days were appointed for the honoring and
worshipping of the Saints, by whose names they were called: ours be ordained
for the honoring of God, for public prayer, and edifying the people by readyng
the Scriptures, and preaching. 2 The Papists in their Saints days prayed
unto the Saints: we only pray unto God in Christ's name. 3 They had all
things done in a strange tongue without any edifying at all: we have the prayers
and the Scriptures red in a tongue known, which can not be without great
commodity to the hearers. 4 To be short, they in observing their days,
think they merit thereby something at Gods hands: We in observing our days,
are taught far otherwise.


The Church even from the beginning has observed such feasts, as it may
appear in good writers.

Touching fasting on the euens of such feasts, or rather absteyning from
flesh, you know it is not for religion, but for policy, and as I think, the
same is protested in that Act, where such kind of absteyning is established:

These be but words of pleasure: God be thanked there be ministers (and
such as you mislyke of) which feed their flocks diligently, and preach in
time, and out of time, according both to S. Peter's and S. Paul's meaning.

But you must understand, that he does not always feed the Who teaches best.

preaches most learnedly, most pithyly, most orderly, most discretely, most to

It may be that he which preaches but once in the month, takes One learned

more pains for his sermon, has more pithe and learning in his sermon,
edifieth more by his sermon, than you do for all your sermons, in all your
sermons, or by all the sermons that you make in the whole year, be they never
so many. For what is it to preach every Frivolous and contentious sermons*
day, and to spend the time with words only, or with bitter inuectiues against
certain trifles, and against superiors? Such sermons do not edify, but
destroy, do not work in the hearts of the hearers faith and charity, but
either contempt of religion, or else contempt of superiors, contempt of good
orders, yea hatred, malice, indiscreet wrath, colored with a pretense of
zeal. Truly such sermons seldom or never work any good effect: many women in
London could on that sort occupy the time. Wherefore I am fully persuaded, that
he comes nerer to the fulfilling of the mind of the Apostle, which diligently
studying and laboring continually for knowledge, does orderly, learnedly, and
effectually preach once in the month, tha^ such as backbiting at other men's
tables, running all the day long up and down the streets, seldom or never
studying, do negligently, unorderly, verbally (if I may so term it) preach
every day twice. And yet I know the oftener a man does preach (the former
circumstances being considered) the better it is. But of every one it will be
required according to his talent: and not he that speaks most, but labors
most to speak, not he that preaches most often, but that preaches most
painfully, truly, and diligently, shall in that day be best accepted.

That learned and ancient father M. Whithead has sundry times lamented in my
hearing (and I think there be other of his friends has heard the same) the
loose, frivolous, and unprofitable preaching of diverse ministers in London. And
I would to God it were better looked unto: then I think verily we should have
less contention and more religion.

T. C. Page 123. Sect. 1.
Here M. Doctor would feign (as it seems) if he durst, interpret diligent
preaching and preaching in season, and out of season, to be preaching once a
month. But because he dare not say so directly, he compasses it about, and
first puts the case of one preaching twice a day, verbally, and with small
substance of matter, and of an other preaching but once in a month, and does
it pythyly, and orderly, and discretely, and concludes, that such a Sermon
once in a monethe, is nearer the mind of the Apostle, than all those other
Sermons made twice every day: and yet the case is not so clear, as he makes
it. For grauntyng that those (which he calls verbal sermons) have some
goodness and edifying, it must be very simple and slender meat, which is not
better being given every day, than the best and dayntiest meat once only in a
month. For with the one a man may live although he be not lyking, with the
other he being once fed, is afterward fai^shed. But how if the case be put,
that the monthly and long labored sermons, as they are called, have as
little, and less good wholesome doctrine in them, than the sermons which are
preached every day. Assuredly for the most of those that go so long with a
Sermon, and which I know and have heard: when they come to bring it forth:
bring forth oftentimes more wy^e, and unprofitable matter, than any good and
tymely fruit, or wholesome substantial doctrine. And no marvel, for therein
the word of God is fulfilled, which declares that the talentes of Gods gifts
and grace, are increased by continual use, and laying out of them, and of the
other side diminished, and in the end taken quite away, when as they are
suffered to lie so long rusting, as it were dug in the ground.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Doctors words he plain: your dealyng with them can not obscure them:
That which I have spoken of verbal Sermons, is notoriously known There is
not the like reason of external and spiritual food.
to be true. What I have said of monthly Sermons, I refer to other men's
judgment. The similitude betwixt the external meat that feeds the body,
and the word of God that feeds the soul, does fail in many things, and
especially in these: that the meat of the body remains not in the stomach,
but passes thorough: the word of God continues and indureth in the mind for
ever. The meat of the body, the better it is digested, the lesser while it
does continue: The word of God the better it is understood and remembered,
the longer it remains. The meat of the body once taken, serves but for ye
present time, be it never so good and wholesome: The word of God once
preached, and faithfully received, does nourishe and feed continually:
therefore one learned, effectual, orderly Sermon, preached once in a Month,
conteyneth more nouryshemente in it, feeds longer, woorketh more in the
hearts of the hearers, edifyeth more, than all the vnorderlye, and verbal
Sermons, I might also add contentious, that some preach in one whole year.
But you compare the word of God, and the nutriment of the body together in
most grosest manner, and in that wherein they are nothing like.

What you think of those monthly, and long labored sermons (as you call
them) it skilleth not much, for you are in a heat, which hinders true
judgment. But I would have you, and all other to understand, that this
which I speak of monthly sermons, I speak it in compar^son, and not that I
would have a man that is otherwise able, to preach but once in a month. I
have showed the contrary in my Answer. Every man shall render an account of his
labor according to his talent. Wherefore you and your company which are so
greatly delighted in spreading false rumors of other men, and seek to win
credit unto your selves, by diffaming of them, shall answer one day, to God
and to me, for the great injury you have done me in that behalf. If it were
lawful for me to boast of my self, I might justly say and prove it, that I
have preached as many sermons as the most of you: God forgive me for my
boasting, but you compel me. Well I confess that I have done no more than I
ought to have done: And I beseech God to grant me no longer life, or joy in
this world, than I desire to be vigilante and profitable in his Church. I
would not be dumb and without a function as you are, and upon that occasion,
for all the goods in England: For surely if those that preach not being able
and once called thereunto, shall have an hard judgment: what shall become of
such, as not only not preach themselves, but deface other men that preach,
by backbiting and slaundering, and spreading abroad false rumors upon them, to
discredit both their persons, and doctrine: and with sects and schisms rent
in pieces the Church of Christ, and violently pluck down whatsoever other men
have builded. O. T. C. these things would be considered in time.

The second Division.
T. C. Page 123. Sect. 2.
And here M. Doctor takes occasion to utter his stomach against London*
flynging of one side against the women, of the other side against the
Ministers, whose diligence because it makes M. Doctors negligence more to
appear, as a dark and dus^she color, matched with that which is clear and
lightsome, he does go about to deface, with the untrue and slanderous
surmyse, of loose, negligente and unprofitable preaching. If there be some one
such or two in London, ^t is too great injury therefore, to charge
indefinitely the company of the ministers of London. Besides that, M. Doctor
does not see how first he accuses the* Bishop or ever he beaware, both in
ordeyning such ministers, and not in reforming them, being so far out of
order, and then the Archbishop, which does not require this disorder at the
Bishops hand, (...) (as he says) this is so godly and heavenly an order, to
have one Bishop over many ministers, and one Archbishop over diverse* Bishops,
and if we shall esteem the pythinesse and fastness of preaching* by the
fruits, as by the knowledge and sear* of God in the people of London, and by
faithful and true hearts toward the Prince, and the Realm, I thynk that that
which he terms (...), loose, and unprofitable preaching, wit fall out to be
waightyer, and to leave a deeper printe behind them, than those monthly
sermons, which he speaks of. And tte Ministers of London better ministers,
which preach twice a day, than those which make the words of God novel and
daynties, and as M. Latimer pleasantly said, Strawberies coming only at
certain times of the year.

Io. Whitgifte.
I speak first of the Authors of the Admonition. Then I report M. Whithead
his saying of diverse preachers in London: which if you could have improued, I
think you would.

I know there be many grave, learned, wise and go^re Preachers in London,
which have greatly profited that place, and as instruments have wroughte
those good effects you speak of, in the hearts of many^. But I know also,
there be some others far unlike unto them in all respects, who by their
vndiscreate and loose dealyng, have as much as ^yeth in them, wroughte the
contrary.

If they have been suffered either through the negligence of Archbishop, or
Bishop, I excuse neither of them: I think they have good cause to take better
heed hereafter.

Touching the women of London, I have not said any thing to their disprayse, I
know a number very honest and godly, and I know none that is evil. Only
I require that modesty in some of them, that beseems sober matrones, and
women pro^essyng the Gospel. It is not seemly for a woman to speak in the
Church, no not that which is good: much less comely is it for her to sc^lde
openly in the streates, or to be a common deprauer of others at tables, and
other meetings.

There is no cause why I should bear a stomach (...) London, which place I
have always honored, where I have many friends, to the which I have showed
as many tokens of good will, as any one man of my ability: But if I admonish
some of the Citezens, and bid them take heed, that they abuse not the
Gospel to serve their affections, that they make it not a cloak for their
contentions, that they wax not weary of it, and desire strange Doctrines,
that they heap not up such Preachers unto themselves, as may serve their
humors, that they show themselves more thankful for the Gospel, the which
they have so long received, that they study for peace and quietness, that
they grieve not the Prince in seeking alterations, by whom they enjoy the pure
word of God, true use of his Sacraments, and syncers woorshyppyng of him: To
be short, if I move them to brotherly love, true obedience to their
Superiors, and hatred of sects, and schisms, whereunto diverse of them be too
much drawn by such as you are: Do I utter my stomach against them? If either
they or you take it so* then I answer that I must obey God rather than man:
and prefer my Prince, before all my friends: But this is a piece of your
Rhetorike, to draw into hatred: which I doubt not the godly will easyly
epsy, and judge of your spirit accordingly.

Nay some in the fullness of their blasphemy have said it, that much

But if any has said, that some of those which use to preach often, by their
loose, negligente, verbal, and unlearned Sermons, have brought the word of
God into contempt, or that four godly, learned, pithy, diligent and
discreet preachers, might do more good in London, than forty contentious,
unlearned, verbal, and rash Preachers, they have said truly, and their
saying might well be justified. Howbeit take heed that you slander no man,
or unjustly seek the discredit of any, whylest you seek to utter your
malice against that godly book. None that favors Gods word (as I think)
denies that hearing the word of God, is the usual and ordinary means,
whereby God uses to work faith in us, And that therefore Preachers be
necessary.

It is but your pleasure thus generally to say: That then pastors sought their
flocks, now they seek theirs: for it is well known that there be Pastors
which seek their flocks, and not theirs.

Hitherto (thanks be unto God) in all this discourse, there is not one piece of
false doctrine of any substance ascribed to this Church of England by these
libellers, and therefore it has (as God will) the first note of the true church
of Christ, that is, purity of doctrine.

Princes pleasures. etc. be? well, it is true yt follows in that part of my
Answer: for there is nothing said to the contrary.

Admonition.
These and a great many other abuses are in the ministry remaining, which
unless they be removed, and the truth brought in, not only Gods justice
shall be poured forth, but also Gods Church in this realm shall never be
builded. For if they which seem to be workine^, are no workmen indeed, but in
name, or elfe work not so diligently and in such order as the workmaster
commands, it is not only unlikely that the building shall go forward, but
altogether impossible that ever it shall be perfited. The way therefore to
avoid these inconveniences, and to reform these deformities, is this: Your
wisdoms have to remove Aduousons, Patronages, Impropriatio^s, and Bishops
authority, clayming to themselves thereby right to ordeyne ministers, and to
bring in that old and true election, which was accustomed to be Act. 1. 26.

ministers already placed, and in their rooms appoynte such as both can and
will by Gods assistance 1* Pet. 5. ^.

restitution, the Court of Faculties, from whence not only licenses to enjoy
many benefices are obtained, as pluralities, Trialities, Totquots. etc. but all
things for the most part, as in the Court of Rome are set on sale, licenses to
marry, to eat flesh in times prohibited, 1. Pet. 5. 2.
to lie from benefices and charges, and a great number beside, of such like

look that they preach, not quarterly or monthly, but continually: not for
filthy lucre sake, but of a ready mind. So God shall be glorified, your
consciences discharged, and the flock of Christ (purchased Acts. 20. 28

What that lawful eccles asticall government of those which (you say) God has

seen, when we come to that part of your Reply. Certain it is that you would
transfer both the authority of the Prince, Archbishop, and Bishop, to your
selves, and your seniors* for that is the lawful ecclesiastical government
you mean. And those be the persons whom you think God to have appointed in
his word, as it will fall out more evidently hereafter.

causes of these clamors, and outcries, that M. Doctor makes, is nothing else,
but the fear of the overthrow, of that honor which is to the dishonor of
God, and ignomune of his Church, and which makes to the good dispensing of
these goods, for the ayd^ and help of the Church, which now serve to oppress
it.

It shall be sufficient to refer the consideration of this your answer to
such as be in authority, who can best consider of both our meanings.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 88. Sect. 1.
Touching the Court of faculties I cannot say much, for I have no great
experience of it, and less knowledge in the law, notwithstanding The Court of

because by lawful authority, it is allowed in this Realm, I cannot but
reverently judge of it, for in such matters I think it a point of modesty to
suppose the best, and to abstain from co^demning of that government, which is
allowed as convenient. If there be faults in the officers, they may be
corrected.

T. C. Page 124. Sect. 2.
As for the Court of faculties, the corruptions thereof, being so clear that
all men see them, and so gross that they which cannot see, may grope them. M.
Doctor answers that he knows not what it means, and therefore is moved of
modesty to think the best of it, which is but a simple shift. For besides
that that the Admonition speaks nothing of it, but that the streates, and
high ways talk of: if there had bin any defense for it, it is not to be
thought that M. Doctor would have bin so negligent an advocate, as to have
omitted it, seeing if he were ignorant, he might have had so easily, and with
so little cost, the knowledge of it. As for his modesty, his bold asseueration
of things which are doubtful, which are false, which are altogyther unlikely,
which are impossible for him to know, does sufficiently bewray, and make so
well known, that no such visard, or paynting can serve to make men believe,
that mere modesty shut up his mouth, from speaking for the Court of faculties,
which has opened his mouth so wide, for the defense of those things, wherein
as it falls out, he has declared himself, to have less skill and
understanding than he has of that Court.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have spoken my conscience of that Court, neither did I co^ferre with any to
give me any instructions concerning it. And surely as I thought then, so do I
think now. I have affirmed nothing which I will not stand to, except you can
convince me by better reasons, than I have heard any as yet. That Court has
the original and authority from the Prince: it is established and confirmed by
Parliament: it medleth nothing with that, that perteyneth to the office either
of Bishop or Pastor. The principal officers be the Lord Chancellor and the
Archbishop. It maynteyneth the Queens prerogative in causes ecclesiastical,
and was erected the. 25. rear of King Henry the eight by authority of
Parlia^ment, to the suppressing and utter abolishing of the Bishop of Romes
jurisdiction. It medleth not (for any thing that I know) with matters, that by
learning can be proved to be against the word of God: and in some points it
cannot without inconvenience be missed. But this is a matter of policy, and
therefore I leave the further consideration of it, to such as God has
committed the gouernmente of this realm unto, to whom it does especially
apperteyne.

Of preaching before the administration of the Sacraments. Tract. 12.

Now to the second point which concerns ministration of sacraments. In the

of the Sacraments sincerely: you would prove that this Church of England has
not the Sacraments sincerely ministered: first by three general reasons
perteyning to both the sacraments: then by certain abuses which you find
severally in either of them.

The first general reason is this: In old time the word was preached before
the Sacraments were ministered, now it is supposed to be sufficient, if it be
red.

To prove that the word was preached before the Sacraments were ministered, you
allege the third of Matthew, verse. 12. Which has his fan in his hand, and
will make clean his flovver, and gather his wheat into his garner, but
will burn up the chafe with unquenchable fire. I understand not how you can
of this place conclude, that there must be of necessity preaching and not
reading before the administration of the Sacraments: If you say, John preached
unto such as came unto his baptism, and read not unto them, therefore of
necessity there must be preaching and not reading: I deny the argument, for A
general doctrine may not he concluded of a singular example.
it is a common rule, that we may not conclude a general doctrine, of a
singular or particular example: and I am sure it is against all rule of Logic.

T. C. Page 124. Sect. vlt.
Whereas unto the Admonition proving out of the third of S. Matthew, that
preaching must go before the ministering of the Sacraments, you answer first,
that it is against al logic to conclude a general ^ule upon a particular
example: you shall understand that that which John did in that point, he did
it not as a singular person, or as the son of Zachary, but as the minister
of the gospel, and therefore it apperteyneth as well to all other ministers,
as unto him. For as it is a good conclusion, that for so much as Peter in that
he is a man is borne to have, and by common course of nature has two legs,
therefore John, and Thomas, and all the rest have so: even so, for so much as
John by reason of his ministry, had need first to preach, then to baptize,
it follows that all others, that have that ministry committed unto them,
must do the like.

Io. Whitgifte.
So did John not as a private man, but as a minister of the Gospel preach in
the wilderness, baptize in Jordan, must therefore all other ministers of the
Gospel do the same? This is no orderly kind of reasoning to say, Peter in
that he is a man is borne to have two legs, Ergo every man has two legs:
but the due form of reasoning is this: Every man by nature has two legs,
Peter is a man and therefore by nature has two legs. Therefore if the
argument had bin framed on this sort, it is the office of every minister of
the Gospel to preach before baptism: John, Peter, and Thomas be ministers of
the Gospel, Ergo they ought to preach before baptism. It had bin in some good
order touching the form, though in the matter there had bin some fault. But you
must think that to preach before the administration of baptism, is not so
natural to a minister of the Gospel, nor so much of the substance of his
office, as to have two legs is to a man. For he may be a true, faithful, and
perfect minister of the Gospel, though he never preach before the
administration of Baptism: But he cannot be a perfect man, touching his body,
that lacks the one or both of his legs. It is an undoubted rule in the
Scriptures, that a general doctrine, may not be concluded of particular
examples, except the same examples be according to some general rule or
commandment.

The Apostles in that they were ministers of the word, preached in all places,
cured diseases, wrought miracles. etc. But it does not therefore follow that
all other ministers must do so likewise. Howbeit if the case were now with

of the Gospel, as it was then with John, that is, if they had to baptize only
men of years and discretion, and such as believed not in Christ, as John had:
then it were most necessary that they should preach before they did baptize.
But seeing the case is clean altered and there is now no occasion to minister
the sacrament of baptism to any but to young infants, that understand not the
word preached, I cannot perceive how that example of John can be aptly applied,
for he preached to such as were yet to be baptized. But the Reader may note,
that you are content to pass over the unapt allegation of the Scripture, used
by the authors of the Admonition in this place.

preaching unto them? In that third Chap. of Matthew verse. 5. and. 6. we read
that all Jerusalem and al Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, went
out to be baptized of him, and that they were baptized of him in Jordan,
confessing their sins: but we read not, that he did immediately before preach
unto them.

T. C. Page 125. Lin. 5.
Secondarily you say that it does not appear, that he preached immediately
before he baptized them with water, And yet S. Matthew after that he had showed,
that he preached repentance, (which the other Evangelists call the baptism of
repentance) he adds, that then the people were baptized of him, which also
may appear by the. 19. of the Acts, verse. 5. where S. Paul notes this order
to have bin kept. For although between the story of his preaching, and that
which is said, of his baptising, there is enterlaced a description of his
diet, and of his apparel, yet these words (then came unto him. etc.) must
needs be referred unto the time which followed his preaching.

Io. Whitgifte.
I doubt not but that John preached unto them oftener than once, or twice before
he did baptize them: for else should he have baptized them being infidels: but
it may well be gathered by those places of Saint Matthew, that he did not
immediately preach unto them before baptism, which is that that I affirm. For
the authors of the Admonition seem to condemn the administration of our
sacraments, because the word is not always preached immediately before they be
ministered.

I understand not how you can gather any such order out of that. 19. of Acts,
verse. 5. except you call questioning preaching. For S. Paul there does question
with them, asking them whither they had received the holy Ghost, or no, and
unto what they were baptized? there is no mention of any sermon preached, for
any thing that I can epsy. Moreover it is dangerous to understand that place
of the Sacrament of baptism, The place. 19 Act. may not be interpreted of ye

least we should seem to admit rebaptisation, and to fall into the heresy of
the Anabaptists, who use this plars for that purpose or else think that there
is so great difference betwixt the baptism of John, and the baptism of
Christ, that such as were baptized with the baptism of John, had need again
(...) baptized with the baptism of Christ, which opinion some hold being
deceived by this place: Therefore that it may appear how unaptly you have
alleged this place for your purpose, and what suspicion you have given either
of the Anabaptisticall rebaptisation, or Papisticall difference betwixt the
baptism of John, and the baptism of Christ, I will recite unto you the
judgment of some learned men concerning this place. M. Calvin upon the same
verse and sentence writes thus: But now it may be asked whether it be lawful
to reiterate baptism, and furious men of our time using this testimony, have
gone about to bring in Anabaptisme. Some men by the name of baptism understand
a new institution: unto whom I do not assent, because their exposition as it
is enforced, sauoureth of a shift. Others deny that Baptism was reiterated,
because they had Calvin in. 19. Acto.
bin baptized, of some folish imitator of John. But because their gheasse has
no color of truth, nay rather the words of Paul do testify that they were the
very true disciples of John, and Luke very honorably calls them the disciples
of Christ: I do not subscribe unto this sentence, and yet I deny the baptism
of water to have bin reiterated, because the words of Luke do sound nothing
else, but that they were baptized with the spirit. First it is no new The name
of baptism transferred to the gifts of the spirit.
thing to transfer the name of baptism to the gifts of the spirit, as we
have seen in the first and. 11. Chap. where Luke said that Christ, when he
promised to the Apostles the visible sending of the holy Ghost, called it
baptism, and again when the holy Ghost descended upon Cornelius, that Peter
remembered the words of the Lord, you shall be baptized with the holy Ghost.
Then we see that it is here namely entreated of the visible gifts, and that
they are conferred and given with baptism. But whereas it follows immediately,
that when he had laid his hands upon them, the holy Ghost came. I interpret
that to be put in the way of exposition, for it is the usual and familiar
manner of speaking in the scripture, to propound a matter briefly, and after to
explicate it more plainly. That therefore which for brevity was somewhat
obscure, Luke does better express, and more largely expound, saying, that the
holy Ghost was given them by the imposition of hands. If any man obiecte, that
the name of baptism, when it is used for the gifts of the holy Ghost, is not
put simply, but with addition, I answer that the meaning of Luke is evident
enough by the text. And further, that Luke alludeth to baptism, whereof he had
before made mention. And surely if you should take it for the external sign,
it will be absurd that it was given unto them, without any better instruction.
But if metaphorically of the institution, the phrase would yet be more hard,
and the story would not agree, that after they were taught, the holy Ghost
descended upon them.

But be it as other some learned men also interpret this place, that in the
former part of the Chapter, the baptism of John is taken for the doctrine of
John, and in this place for the sacrament of baptism: and that Paul preached
before he did administer the same, yet does it not follow, that of necessity
there must be preaching before the administration of baptism. The Anabaptists
abused this place to the same effect, but M. Bullinger does answer them in this
manner. Whereas the Catabaptists ^ullin. in. 19. Acto.
object here, Therefore doctrine goes before baptism: no man denies it, but
yet in those that be of years of discretion, and with whom the name of Christ
has not bin published. But again whereas the name of Christ has bin heard of,
no man can deny, but that there the parents being careful for the salvation
of their children, do offer them unto holy baptism, because they hear that
God is also, the God of infants: but baptism (...) self to be nothing else,
but the sign of the people of God.

that our Savior Christ was baptized, when Luke. 3.

savior Christ was baptized after yt he had heard John preach. And it is very
probable, that our savior Christ which did honor the ministry of God by the
hand of men so far, as he would vouchsafe to be baptized of John, would not
neglect or pass by his ministry of the word, being more precious than that of
the Sacrament, as it appears by John, that our Savior Christ was present

First S. Mathewe makes no mention of it, neither can it be gathered by any
circumstance of the place. Secondly, Luke does not say that John preached
immediately before he baptized. But the contrary rather appears, if S. Luke
write the story orderly. Thirdly, to what purpose should he preach to Christ
before he baptized him? Lastly, in the first of John, there is not one sentence
to prove that Christ was present at any of John's sermones, for those words (

But if it had been so necessary a matter as you make it, and of the substance

What do you say then, or wherefore contend you? no man ever denied preaching
to be very convenient. But the Authors of the Admonition say: That in the

the Sacraments be ministered? so that you would seem to say something in

life of the Sacraments depend upon Gods promises expressed in his word, and
neither upon preaching nor upon reading. If this doctrine of yours be true,
then be the sacramites dead sacraments, and without effect, except the word
be preached when they be ministered. And so in deed do some of your adherentes
in plain terms affirm, saying that they are seals without writing, and
plain blankes. Which doctrine sauoureth very strongly of Anabaptisme, and
does deprive those of the effects and fruits of the Sacraments, which have
been partakers of them without the word preached when they were ministered, and
so consequently even your self, for it is not like that there was a sermon at

flat Anabaptisticall. For if that baptism be without life, at the which the
word of God is not preached, then can it not regenerate or be effectual to
those that were therewith baptized? And therefore must of necessity be
iterated, that it may be lively.

Again isbaptisme be dead, at the which the word of God is not preached, then
can it do no good to such as have no understanding of the word of God
preached, that is, to infantes. For if the preaching of the word be so
necessarily joined with the administration of the Sacraments, it is in the
respect of those that are to receive the sacraments, and then must it needs
follow ye the sarame^ts may be ministered to none, but to such as be able to
hear the word of God: whereby infantes must be secluded from baptism. And in
deed this is one of the strongest arguments that the Anabaptists use against
the baptising of infantes, as shall hereafter apeare. For of this the Reader

I will note one or two places out of Zuinglius, touching this matter. In his
book De baptismo, speaking against this self same assertion of the
Anabaptists, he says thus: The disciples did minister the baptism of water
in times past without any doctrine, and without giving the holy Ghost, for they
baptized when as Christ taught and did not baptize, as we have before showed
out of the. 4. of John, and out of the: 1. Cor. 1. for Paul Zuinglius.
says, Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach, therefore some taught,
and other baptized. But we may gather out of the sixth of John, that baptism
was used before that men being endued with true faith, did stick unto the
doctrine, for there we read that many forsook Christ, whom notwithstanding no
man doubts to have bin before baptized. Again entreating of these words. (
Euntes docete omnes gentes. etc. Math. 28. which the Anabaptists use for an
argument to improve the baptism of infantes, because Christ said there
Docete, before he said Baptizate, whereof they gather your assertion, that
preaching must go before baptism, and therefore conclude that infantes may not
be baptized because they can not be taught) says thus: By these words they
which deny baptism unto infantes do not only seduce them selves, but draw
others also into great errors, and Laberinthes: for urging of the bare order of
the words of Christ, they have nothing else in their mouths but only this:
Docete and baptizate, teach and baptize. Behold say they the commandment
of Christ. In the mean time, they do not mark (nay in deed they will not
mark) that the same thing that they so much cry upon, doctrine, is afterward
also set after, when as he says, Docentes eos seruare. etc. teaching them to
observe all those things, which I have commanded you. By the which words,
it is manifest that baptism is a sign whereby we give our names, and have our
first entrance unto Christ, the which being given and received, yet
notwithstanding those things are to be taught and to be learned, which Christ
would have us to keep: but these men urging the bare letter, Cry still, that
Christ said, Docete and baptizate, teach and baptize. Wherefore I will also
urge the same bare letter, but for their causes only, if by any means I might
withdraw them from their desire to contend. Sirs you urge that saying, Go and
teach al nations, baptizing the^ in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the holy Ghost: and I say this, Baptize them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things,
whatsoever I have commanded you. Wherefore now I ask, whither of us has
the word more plain and apert, that concerns doctrine? you verily bring the
word of God, which proves that men should be taught, but what kind of
doctrine that is, is not in those your words expressed. But we have the word
of God more clear and plain than yours, which is, Teaching them to observe
all those things, whatsoever I have commanded you, and these words are put
after, and not set before baptism. And a little after. Although we grant that
this order of words has some force in this place, yet these things perteine
nothing unto young children and infantes, that they should not be baptized
before doctrine: for these words perteine unto those that are instructed in
doctrine and the outward word: but it is manifest that infantes are not
taught, therefore these words can not so be referred unto children, that they
ought not to be baptized.

And in the same book, speaking of this. 3. chap. of Mathewe by you alleged
When preaching is necessary before (...).
and used of the Anabaptists to the same purpose, he grants that John did
preach before he did baptize, For necessity so required, that by teaching he
should expound to the people the causes of baptism. For except doctrine were
preached, no man would in these our days have their children baptized. But
after they were of years of discretion, and had received faith through the
ministry of the doctrine, (as we read that it was done of them in old time)
they brought their children also to be baptized. And in the end he concludes
thus: In the mean time, we do willingly grant this unto them, that doctrine
and instruction ought to go before, if at any time we come unto infidels, for
none of the Heathen ought to be baptized, but he which has heard and believed
that doctrine, which was before unknown unto them and theirs.

Thus then you see, how nere your opinion of the necessity of preaching
before the administration of the Sacraments, approaches to the heresy of the
Anabaptists. If you would shifte off the matter, as though you required not
this necessity of preaching before the administration of the Sacraments
always in respect of those which are to receive them, but in respect of the
rest which are present, as this would be but a shifte, so can it not agree with
your assertion: for the life of the sacraments, perteyneth not to those that
be present, but unto those that are partakers of them. Wherefore M. Doctor
needs not his egles eyes to espy your errors (that I say no worse) but with
dimmer sight than he has, might easily see, that you in this doctrine have
plainly joined hands with the Anabaptists.

And yet I would not have any man think that I mislyke preaching in the

affirm, that it is not so necessarily joined with the administration of the
sacraments, but that they may be rightly administered, though the word be not
at the same time preached.

S. Paul says, that faith comes by hearing, and hearing of the word
preached, so that the ordinary and especial means to work faith by, is

I have affirmed nothing so boldly, which I have not as strongly by good
authorities, and reasons confirmed, to the which you have not answered, but in
this manner of brawling. If you did understand that there are diverse kinds of
preachings (as M. Bucer declares) upon the. 4. to the Ephesians. and that reading
of the scriptures is one of them, which also the same Bucer there affirms,
then would you have absteyned from giving this sentence. That if reading be
preaching, than is the comparison of the profitte and efficacy between one and
the other absurd: for one kind of preaching may be compared to an other,
without any absurdity.

I say that S. Paul in that chapter to the Romans, by preaching does

comprehends reading, as well as it does that which you call preaching, and it
is greatly against the dignity and majesty of the scriptures, it also
greatly confirms the error of the Papists, touching the obscurity of the
scriptures and debarring the people from reading them, to say, that faith
comes not by reading, for that is to make them dumb and unprofitable.

in this manner. Reading of the holy scriptures was appointed to this end, that
both the phrase, and manner of speaking of the scripture, and the scripture it
self, might be more known and more familiar to the people, when as they which
did interpret the scriptures, could not finish one little part thereof in one
whole year. In the mean time by the only reading of the scriptures, the
people were maruelously confirmed in the knowledge of all the points and
doctrine of salvation. For they be in every book oftentimes repeated, and
expounded with diverse words, that the people of that which followed might
understand many things, which in that that went before, they could not
sometime perceive: and by that means, the judgment of the people was
confirmed in all points of religion, so that they were able to judge of the
interpretation of the scriptures, and of all doctrine which was taught them by
their own Curates and teachers, or by any other. And therefore in ancient
Churches, this bare reading of the scriptures was greatly esteemed. Of reading
of scriptures (God be thanked) it is very well appointed in the Church of
England. etc. Thus far M. Bucer. Surely I marvel what is meant by this your
strange kind of doctrine, except you would have the people through ignorance
of the scriptures, brought again to this point, that they must only depend

efficacy be compated to the preaching of the word of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
Reading of the scriptures does not only nouryshe faith, but ingendreth faith
also: Reading does not only nourish faith, but ^ge^dreth also.
as I have proved in my Answer to the Admonition, both by the scriptures and
other learned writers. If it were otherwise, then were the power of persuasion
to be ascribed to the preacher and manner of teaching, not to the word which
is against that saying of Christ, Scrutamini scripturas. etc. search the
scriptures, for in them you think to have eternal life. etc. and of the
Apostle. The whole scripture is given by inspiration of John. 5. 2. Tim. 3
God, and is profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, and to instruct in
righteousness, that the man of God may be absolute etc.

I deny not but that preaching is the most ordinary and usual means, that
God uses to work by in the hearts of the hearers, because the people be for
the most Preaching ye most ordinary means: and why.
part ignorant, and dull of understanding, and therefore have need of
scholemaisters and teachers to open and declare the scriptures unto them, and
to deal with them according to their capacity: but this does nothing derogate
from the might and power of the word of God being read of them, or to them
that understand it, and set their heart upon it. If reading were so simple a
thing and so little profitable as you would make it, why was the Gospel
committed to writing? why is it thought so expedient to have it in a tongue
known to the people? why do men printe their sermons, which they have
preached? why did God by Moses command the law to be read? why did the
Prophet Jeremy will Baruch to write out his sermons, and to read them ^o the
people?

Do you think that there comes no more knowledge or profit by reading the
scriptures, than does by beholding of Gods creatures? Then let us have Images
again, that they may be lay men's books, as the Papists call them: no doubt
attributing as much to the external and visible creature, as they did to the
reading of the eternal word of God, wherein you join with them, for any
thing that I yet see.

And to know that the word of God preached, has more force, and is more
effecuall than when it is read, it is to be observed, whereunto the preaching is
compared. It is called a lifting or heauing John. 3.
up of our Savior Christ. Like unto the displaying of a banner, as the Serpent
was lift up in the wilderness. As therefore that which is lifted up on high is
better and easilyer seen of a greater company, than when it stands or lies
upon the ground, or in some valley or some low place: so the preaching of the
gospel, does offer sooner, and easilyer the truth thereof unto the faith,
(which is the eye of the hearer) than when it is read.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where is there any such comparison in that third Chapter of John? If you mean
these words, Et nem^ ascendit in caelum, etc. Et sicut Moses exaltauit
Serpentem. etc. As Moses Iobn. 3.
lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness. etc. as you can mean no other, then
I think you were not well advised or little cared for your credit, when you
abused them for this purpose, to prove that the word of God is more effectual
when it is preached, than when it is read, Surely if you fetch your similitudes
so far, and imagine that which was never meant, and make the scripture a nose
of ware as the Papists do, you may conclude what you list. For how hangs this
together: No man ascends up into heaven, but he that descended down from
heaven, the son of man which is in heaven. Ergo says comes by preaching of
the word of God, and not by reading of it? Or this. As Moses lifted up the
Serpent in the desert, so must the son of man be lifted up, that all that
believe in him. etc: Therefore the word of God has more force when it is
preached, than when it is read. This gear is to profound for me, I cannot
understand it, except I will imagine that which is not: and it may be that you
were in some other deep meditation when you wrote it, and so applied this text
to a wrong matter: for in that place, Christ foretells of his death and
passion, whereof the lifting up of the Serpent Number. 21.
in the wilderness was a figure. And although I am not ignorant that some do
allegory upon this place, saying that Christ is lifted up, by the preaching of
the Gospel, yet that makes nothing against me, who no where deny this effect
of preaching. And it is a very hard collection to say: Christ is lifted up by
preaching, therefore reading lets him lie on the ground, as though by
reading the Gospel, Christ is not also lifted up, and made manifest unto the
eyes of the faithful.

It is called also a sweet Savor, and therefore as the spyces being brayed
and (...), smell 2. Cor. 2
sweeter and stronger, than when they be whole and unbroken: so the word by
interpretation being broken and bruysed, caryeth a sweeter savor unto the
understanding, than when it is by reading given gross, and whole, the same
also may be said in that the preaching is called a cutting of the word of
God, for as when the meat is cut and shred, it nourishes more than when it is
not 2. Tim. 2.
so: so likewise it is in preaching and reading.

Io. Whitgifte.
Saint Paul speaking of himself, and of the ministers of the word, says
thus. For we are unto God the sweet savor of Christ in them that are saved.
etc. and 2. Tim. 2. Cor. 2. 2. Tim. 2.
he admonishes Timothy to cut the word of truth rightly, that is prudently,
and according to the capacity of the hearers. What conclude you of this? Or
what one word is there in either of those places that derogateth any thing
from reading? Do you think that the praise of preaching, is the disprayse of
reading? As though they were one contrary to an other, and not rather both of
them most profitable. Is not the word of God when it is read, a sweet savor?
Is there not prudencie and discretion required in reading the Scriptures?
Surely I am sorry that the Papists shall have so just cause to jest at your so
unapt alleging of the Scriptures, and that they shall be animated in their
ridiculous applications of the same, by these and such like untoward
allegations of yours.

And that which is brought by the Authors of the Admonition, and so
scornefully hurled away of M. doctor, that Saint Paul compares the preaching
unto pianting and watering, is a 1. Cor. 3.
very Surely you will make a notable conclusion
notable place to prove that there is no salvation, without preaching. For as
the husband man receives no fruit, unless he both plant, and water that
which is planted: Even so there is no salvation to be looked for, where there
is no preaching. It may be that God does sometimes work says by reading
only, especially where preaching cannot be, and so he does sometimes without
reading, by a wonderful wor^e of his spirit: but the ordinary ways, whereby
God regener^teth his children, is by the word of God, which is preached. And
therefore Solomon says, Prou. 29.
that where prophecy, (which is not a bare reading, but an exposition and
application of the Scriptures) fails, there the people perish.

Io. Whitgifte.
Saint Paul says, I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.
1. Cor. 3. ver. 6.
Erg^ there is no salvation without preaching: is not this good stuff, and a
strong argument to build a matter of salvation vpp^n? Saint Paul there
declares, that the preaching of the word is not effectual, except God give
the increase, and that we ought not to attribute our salvation to the
Ministers of the word but only to God. He makes no comparison betwi^t
reading and preaching, neither is there any thing there spoken, either of
tilling, or watering, which may not also be applied to attentive and diligent
reading. If your distinction of quoting Scriptures, some times for the matter,
sometimes for the phrase, serve at any time to excuse the unskillfulness of the
Authors of the Admonition, it must either serve now or n^uer: else I
understand not to what purpose it can be alleged. It may be that God does not
only work faith by reading, but it is commonly so, especially in such as
read with understanding. And yet this derogateth nothing from preaching, for
God works by both.

Solomon says. That where there is no vision the people decay. And most tru^
(...). 29.
it is. For where there is no true doctrine, nor faithful Ministers to preach
the same, there the people must needs decay in Godliness, and true knowledge:
but this derogateth nothing from reading.

Both reading and preaching be necessary in the Church, and most prof^table,
the commendation of the one does not take any thing from the other. But
Preaching profits m^ than reading, and why?
preaching does profit mo than reading does, because it is more apt sor the
ignorant and unlearned: and if in this respect you prefer preaching to
reading, because it does more commonly profit, and serves more to ye
instruction of those which are ignorant, because it more plainly expresses the
meaning of the Scripture and applies the same, then have you also bestowed a
great time in proving that which is not denied of any, which ^ult you found
with me before (though unjustly) even in this treatise. But we may Many
conuer^ed by ^ding.
not make so light of reading, whereby so many have come to the knowledge of
the truth, whereby also daily mo are converted, even such as very seldom or
never hear the word preached: both preaching therefore and reading be means
whereby God does call to salvation those that be his, he uses them both,
jointly and severally as it pleases him, and where the one is publicly
received, there is the other never refused.

It is true, the word both preached and read is all one, as the fire covered
with ashes, is the same when it is discovered. But This (...) of (...).
as when the fire is stirred up and discovered, it gives more heat, than when
it is not: so the word of God by preaching and interpreting (as it were
stirred up and blown) makes a greater ^ame in the hearts of the hearers,
than when it is read. The reason whereof is not in the word, which is all one
read and preached, but in that it pleases the Lord to work more effectually
with the one, than with the other, thereby approving and authorizing that
means and ways, which he especially ordained for us to be saved by.

Of infinite examples take one of the Eunuch, which although he had been at
Jerusalem, and Acts. 8.
returning home, was reading of the Prophet Esaias, yet he bel^eued not until
Philip came and preached unto him, which I neither say to disallow reading of
the scriptures (which is ver^e profitable) nor yet to strengthen the hands of
the Papists, which to banish the reading of the Scriptures, object the
hardness and difficulty of the Scriptures, as Master doctor does most
slanderously, and unbrotherly surmise of the Authors of the Admonition: but
that it may appear what a gross and a palpable error this is, that the
reading of the Scripture should be as effectual as the preaching of it, which
God has appointed to be the especial and singular means, ^o save those whom
he has appointed to salvation.

Io. Whitgifte.
What is this else but together with the Papists to condemn the Scriptures T.
C. (...) with the Papists.
of obscurity: as though all things necessary to salvation were not plainly
and clearly expressed in them? I grant you that every man vnderst andeth
them not, for it is the spirit of God that opens the heart of man, both to
understand the Scriptures read and preached: and to him that understands
them, they are as hot and as lightsome read as preached: neither shall you
ever be able to prove the contrary. And the places that you have hythertoo
alleged, being so far from the purpose, convince you of a marvelous great
scarcity of proofs.

One example of infinite, is as few as may be. But if that one make not for
your purpose, then must you be feign to seek some other, seeing you have such
store. The Eunuche did not understand the Scripture, that he read, as it
appears in the same place of the Acts: but I speak of such as understand
that which they read, and therefore this place is soon answered. Neither do
I speak of such in the commendation of reading, to disprove in any respect,
the necessity and utility of preaching. But neither you, nor the Authors of
the Admonition can avoid the strengthening the hands of the Papists in their
erroneous opinions, not only of the hardness and difficulty, but also of the
unprofitableness of the Scriptures. How palpaple an error it is that I
defend, may appear by your mighty reasons against it, and your learned
answer to those proofs that I have brought for it.

And although this be very gross, yet in the. 163. page, where he goes about
to show the profit of reading the Scriptures in the Church, he ^s yet more
absurd. For there he says that it may be, that some men be more ^difyed by
the simple reading of the Scriptures, than by Sermons. In deed if a man sleep
the Sermon time, and wake the reading time, or be otherwise deaf at the one,
and attentive and heed^e at the other. I will not deny but he may be more
edisyed at the simple reading, than at the Sermon, unless it be in this and
such like case, I know not how it may be true that M. Doctor says. And
indeed it is as much to say that it may be, that the means that God has
ordained to be the fittest and meetest, to call men to salvation, is not the
fittest and meetest means, which a man should not once so much as think of,
without trembling and shaking every joint of him.

Io. Whitgifte.
As absurd as it is, Musculus does affirm it in his common places. titu. de
Lectio. sacrae script. And as his saying, I report it in mine answer:
believing it to be most true. And therefore (if your malice had not been
wholly bent against me) you should have ascribed this absurdity to him, or at
least have divided it betwixt us, and so my back should have been somewhat
eased of the burden of absurdityas, wherewith you would so gladly ouercharge me.

God works by reading the Scriptures as well as he does by preaching, and God
uses reading as a means as well as preaching.
uses that also as a means to call men to salvation. Read Augustine. lib.
con. 8. cap. 12. and you shall see that God used reading as a means to convert
him. And surely I marvel that you professing the Gospel, can without
trembling and shaking speak so basely of reading the word of God, being a
thing so precious, and so singular a means of our salvation: but for the thing
it self, I refer it to the judgment Reading somtune preuayleth more than
preaching.
of those, that have not drunk so deeply of the cup of contention as you
have, whither it may not sometimes so happen. Or whither they which are
quietly affected may not receive more edifying by the simple reading of the
Sciptures which they understand, than by the Sermons of diverse contentious
preachers, whose hot and bitter inuectiues, (which savor more of malice, than
of love: of contention, than of peace the fruit of the Gospel) may breed in
the hearts of those that are studious of peace, and quietly minded, some
suspicion of the truth of their doctrine. Or lastly, whither some misdoubting
the truth of the doctrine of the preachers of the Gospel, and conceyuing a
preindicate opinion against them (as diverse Papists do) may not be more
edifyed, by diligent reading of the Scriptures, of whose authority they do
not doubt, than by hearing of the Preacher, whose words they do either
mistrust, or not regard, by reason of their preiudicate opinion against all
Preachers: and in the end perceiving by reading of the Scriptures the truth of
their doctrine, may be thereby established, which were not by the Sermons once
moved. And for this cause Christ said. John. 5. Search the John. 5.

That Reading is Preaching.

And now I think by this time M. Doctor knows his answer to his second
question, which is whether reading be not preaching* And if this be not
sufficient that I have said, I would ask gladly of him, A mere cauil.
whether all Readers be Preachers, and whether whosoever reads, preaches,
for if it be true (which he says) that reading is preaching, then that is
likewise true, that all those which read, preach, and so a child of. 4. or.
5. years old, is able to preach, because he is able to read.

Io. Whitgifte.
I know an answer in deed, such as it is: but it is much more fit for a
Papist or Atheist, than for a professor of the Gospel. If preaching be taken
generally for every How reading is preaching.
kind of instructing or teaching by the word of God, as it is ad Romans 10.
then is reading preaching. But if it be taken in the usual signification, for
him that interprets the Scripture, teaches, and exhorts in the
Congregation, by discoursing upon the scriptures, and applying them as occasion
serves, then it is not so: and yet no less profitable to edifying, to such as
understand that which is read, than preaching. To read the Scriptures is not
to preach, or teach, in respect of him that reads, but in the respect of
Gods spirit, which thereby works knowledge in the heart of the Reader or
Hearer. For we must think it to be true that Cyprian says. When we read the
Scripture God speaks unto us: and in this sense a child that can read, may
preach, that is, God by his word read of a child, may, and does oftentimes
teach us. And hereof we have (God be thanked) many examples in England, of
those which being not able to read themselves, by the means of their
children reading to them at home, receive instruction and edifying. And if you
had been disposed to have called to remembrance, that which you say you have
so diligently read in M. Fox, you might have known that diverse in the
beginning came to the light of the Gospel only by reading, and hearing the
new Testament in English read: which I am sure you will confess to have been
to them a preaching and instruction.

By the word of God it is an office of preaching, they make it an office of
reading.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 159. Sect. 1.
But where does the book make the ministry an office of reading only? Or
what contrariety is there betwixt reading and preaching? Nay what difference
is there betwixt them? If a man A written sermon is preaching.
should write his Sermon, and read it in the book to his flock, does he not
preach? Is there no Sermons but such as be said without book? I think to
preach the Gospel is to teach and instruct the people, in faith and good
manners, be it by writing, reading or speaking without book: and I am sure the
spirit of God, does work as effectually by the one of these ways, as it does
by the other. Did not Saint Paul preach to the Romans when he writ to
them? Was not the reading of Deuteronomie to the people a preaching? 2. Reg.

Scripture, being a thing so fruitful and necessary?

T. C. Page 127. Lin. 18.
And least he should seem to be thus evil advised, without some reason in
the. 159. Page, he asks whether (if a man write his Sermon and after read it
in the book) that reading be preaching. Here is hard shift, what if I granted
that it is preaching, yet I deny that therefore he that reads an other
man's Sermon preaches: and further I say, that if there be any such, as
being able to preach for his knowledge, yet for fault either of utterance or
memory, can not do it, but by reading that which he has written: It is not
convenient that he should be a Minister in the Church. For Saint Paul does
not require only, that the 1. (...). 3.
Bishop or Minister should be learned in the mysteries of the Gospel, and
such a one as is able to set down in writing in his study, the sense of the
Scripture, but one which is apt and fit to teach. And the Prophet Malachie
shows, that he must have the law, not in his papers, Mal. 2.
but in his lips, noting thereby that it is necessary to have the gift of
utterance: And Esaias the Prophet saying that God had given him the tongue of
the learned, does thereby declare, Esaias. 50.
that it is not sufficient that he be well instructed in the mystery of
salvation, but that he have also the gift of utterance.

Io. Whitgifte.
And why does not he which reads an other man's Sermon preach, as well as he
does when he reads his own? What if he pronounce another man's Sermon in the
Pulpit without book, does he not preach, because it is not his own? I do not
speak this to defend any such ignorant Pastor, that should need so to
depend upon other men's labors: I do but put a case. It may be that a learned
Pastor having both memory and utterance, sometime upon occasion may read a
Sermon. And I nothing doubt, but in so doing he preaches. And surely he shall
the more redily have the law in his lips, if he have it first in his Papers.
And yet if he read, he must use his lips. Jeremy the Prophet as it
appears in the. 36. Chapter, was commanded to write that which the Lord had
commanded him to say to the people of Iere. 36.
Judah, and of Jerusalem, and to cause it to be read unto them, and so it was in
the open congregation, and in the house of the Lord, in the hearing of all the
people. And so did Baruch in like manner write that which he had to say to
Iechonia, and to Bar. 1.
all the people, and read the same in the open congregation Bar. 1. and surely
both these books were Sermons.

Afterward M. Doctor asks whether S. Paul did not preach to the Romans,
when he wrote unto them. No forsooth, his writing to the Romans, was no more
preaching than S. Romans 1.
Paul's hand, or his pen. which were his instruments to write with, were his
tongue, or his lights, or any other parts, which were his instruments to
speak with. And S. Paul himself writing to the Romans, puts a
difference between his writing and his preaching, when although he wrote unto
them, yet he excuses himself that he could not come to preach unto them,
saying, that he was ready, as much as lay in him to preach unto them.

Io. Whitgifte.
Forsooth and I think verily, that the same Epistle did them more good, and
wrought more with them, than if the self same matter, had been preached unto
them, and not written. And if you will but peruse the. 15. and. 16. verse. of
the. 15. Chapter of that Epistle, I think that you shall hear the Apostle
call this written Epistle in effect, preaching. I do not perceive that in the
first Chapter of this Epistle, he makes any such difference between his
writing unto them, and his preaching. If you mean the. 15. verse, he therein
only signifies, that so much as lies in him, he is ready personally to
preach the Gospel among them, as well as he does it now by his letters: and
therefore to say that this his writing is no more preaching than his hand or
his pen, was his tongue or his lights, is a proper jest, but not so apt for
the purpose, nor so fit for your person. A man's mind is commonly much better
expressed by writing than by word, and that which is written continues.

words of the law? Why did Josiah after he had found this book, cause it to
be read, before all the people? if readyng had not been effectual, and of as
great force to persuade as preaching, that is, if readyng in effect had not
been preaching. If the eight chapter of Nehemias Nehem. 8.
be well considered, and the true meaning of the. 4. and. 7. verses, according
to learned and godly interpreters weighed and pondered, this controversy will
soon be at an end, and it will there appear in express words, that readyng
is preaching.

And in the. 162. page, he alleges that in the. 15. of the Acts. S. Luke

seemings and conjectures were taken away, there would be few reasons left.
seeming and conjecture, to set down so certainly, and undoubtedly, that
reading is preaching, and then there is no one letter nor syllable that
vpholdeth any such comecture. For S. James says that Moses (meaning the
law) read every Sabbath thorough out every town in the Sinagogue, was also
preached, or had those that preached it, setting forth the order which was used
in all the ^hurches amongst the people of God: that always, when they met
upon the Sabbath days, they had the scriptures first read, and then preached
of and expounded, which is that the Authors of the Admonition do desire, and
therefore complain, for that after readyng follows no preaching, which any
indifferent man may easily understand, by that that they say: In the old
time the word was preached, now it is supposed to be sufficient if it be read.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely the place of it self is evident, neither can I read any interpreter,
that does otherwise understand it, than of reading, and the occasion of
uttering these words imports the same. For S. James does use this for a
reason, why the ceremonies of the law could not by and by be abolished among
the Jews, because Moses was of so great authority with them, being read every
Sabbath day in their Churches. Therefore having the words of the Scripture
with me, I must rest in my opinion, until I hear some proof or authority to
the contrary. Howbeit the weight of the cause lies not upon this text, this
is but one reason among diverse.

How does it then happen that you have not salued the matter, by setting down
their words, and declaring how I have mistaken them? seeing you have omitted
that, men may well think that this is not uttered of you in good earnest. Now

Tertullian. says, when we come together to the reading of the holy

of England, M. Harding calls reading of the Scriptures to the people in the

For reading ministers you bid us view these places. Mala. 2. verse. 7. Esaias.
56. 10. Zachar. 11. 15. Matthew. 15. 14. 1. Timoth. 3. 3. The Prophet Malachie
in the second chapter, and seventh verse, says on this sort: For the

the Prophet does signify, that the Priests ought to be learned in the law
and able to instruct, which no man denies, and if there be any crepte into the
ministry, which a^ not able so to do, it is to be ascribed, either to the

t^me. But here is nothing spoken against reading, for any thing that I can
gather: and if any man should come unto me, and demand of me, any question
touching the law of God, I think I should better satisfy him, if I did
read the words of the law unto him, than if I should make a long tedious
discourse of mine own, to little or no purpose. It is the word it self that
pearceth and mou^th the conscience.

I speak not this against interpreting of the Scriptures, or preaching Page
162. Sect. 1. 2.
(for I know they be both necessary) but against such as be enemies to the
reading of them.

The places in the. 56. of Esaias, and in the eleventh of zachary, tend to the
same purpose, they all speak against ignorant, foolish, slothful governors
and pastors, there is nothing in them that condemns or disaloweth readyng of
the Scriptures, or reading of Prayers: No more is there in the fiftenth of
Matthew, nor. 1. Timo. 3. read the places and you shall soon see, with how
little judgment they be quoted against such ministers, as use to read the
scriptures and prayers to the people. If you had said against dumb and
unlearned ministers, view these places, you had said something. For Reading
ministers. 1. Tim. 4.
For reading ministers that is, for reading the Scriptures publicly in the
church by ministers, view you these places. 1. Tim. 4. Til I come give
attendance to readyng, to exhortation, to doctrine. In the which words as
Musculus says: Exprimit ordinem Ecclesiasticum, quo primum ex Musculus.
sacris Scripturis aliquid legebatur, deinde exhortatio and doctrina
subijciebatur. He expresses the Ecclesiastical order, wherein first there
is some thing read out of the Scriptures, then follovveth exhortation and
doctrine. Luke. 4. Where we learn that Christ being at Nazareth, as his
custom Christ read the scripture.
was, went into the Sinagogue on the Saboth day, and stood up to read. etc.

And yet you say, Reading is not feedyng, but it is as evil as playing Page
163, Lin. 2. and Sect. 1. 2. 3. 4.
upon a stage, and worse to, for players yet learn their parts without
book and these a many of them, can scarcely read within book.

That reading is feedyng, Musculus gives these reasons: First, Reading is
feeding. Musculus.
because it makes the people expert and cunning, in the Scriptures, so that
they can not be so easily deceived with false teachers. And therefore Josephus
Lib. 2. contra Appion. speaking of this commodity of having the Scriptures
read, says on this sort: In vnaquaque septimana ad legem audiendam
conueniunt vniuersi. Nostrorum quilibet de legibus interrogatus, facilius quam
nomen suum recitat. vniuersas quippe mox a primo sensu discentes in animo velut
inscriptas habemus. Every week all the people come together to hear the
Law. Every one of us demanded any question of the law, can answer
readily, as he can tell his own name. For we learning the law even from
our youth, have it, as it were written in our memory.

Secondly the public reading of the Scripture, is good for such as can not
read themselves: to such likewise as can read, but yet have not the books
of the holy Scripture at home in their houses.

Thirdly, it makes the people better to understand the Sermons preached unto
them: because through the continual hearing of the Scriptures read, they be
acquainted with the words and phrases of the same.

Last of all, it may be that some men be more edified by the simple reading of
the scriptures, than by sermons.

If you join with them in that also, then I have to say unto you with S.
Augustine: In his quae aperte in Scripturis posita sunt inueniuntur illa omnia

In those things that be plain and manifest in the Scriptures, are all such

scripserunt paucis, sed vniuerso populo. As the Apostles write so did the
Lord, that is, he spoke by his Gospels, not that a fevve, but that all might
understand. Plato vvritte, but he vvritte to fevv, not to the people, for
scarce three do understand him: these, that is the Apostles vvritte not to
fevv, but to the whole people. But I think you doubt not of this matter.

If the readyng of the scriptures edify not, what needed Chrysostom

declaring not only the commodity of them, but the easiness also to be

We read in the eight of the Acts, that Philip being a Deacon Philip deacon

did Baptize.

T. C. Page 128. Lin. 1.
Of ministering of the sacraments in private places and by women, I have spoken
before, there remains therefore only in this section to speak of the Deacons,
that they ought not to minister the sacrament. Which although I have done
partly before, and partly afterward will do, when I shall show that it
apperteyneth not to them to minister the word, and therefore not the
sacraments (being things the ministry whereof ought not to be severed) yet I
will in a word answer, those arguments, that M. Doctor brings for to prove,
that they may minister the sacraments, whereof the first is, that Philip in
the. 8. of the Acts baptized. But I would gladly ask M. Doctor how he is able
to prove, that that was Philip the Deacon, and not rather Philip the Apostle,
seeing that S. Luke when he speaks of Philip that was the Deacon, speaks of
him, with that title and addition of Deaconship, and there is great doubt
amongst writers, which Philip that was, that S. Luke mentions in the eight
chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. But let it be that Philip that was the
Deacon. I answer that he was no Deacon then, for the Church of Jerusalem
whereof he was Deacon, being scattered, he could be no more Deacon of it, or
distribute the money that was collected for the poor of that Church. And
further I answer that he was afterward an Evangelist, and therefore preached
not by virtue of his Deaconship, (whose calling is not to preach) but by that
he was an Evangelist, whose office put upon him a necessity of preaching.

Io. Whitgifte.
In the beginning of that. 8. chap. of the Acts. S. Luke declares, that all
the Apostles Philip that baptized Samaria, was a Deacon.
did still remain at Jerusalem, wherefore it could not be Philip the Apostle
which was now at Jerusalem: but it must needs be Philip the Deacon that was
dispersed with the rest and came to Samaria, where he now preached and
baptized. And of this indgement is M. Calvin whose words upon the same place
and chapt. be these: Calvin.
Seeing Luke had before declared, that the Apostles did not stir from
Jerusalem, it is probable, that one of the seven Deacons, whose daughters also
did Prophecy is here mentioned. M. Gualter writing upon the same place says
thus. This Philip was not the Apostle, Gualter.
but he which was reckened before among the Deacons, as the ancient
Ecclesiastical writers do with one consent testify: especially Epiphanius
writing De Simone and Simoniacis. That this Philip still remained Deacon, and
that he was called an Evangelist, in respect that he preached the Gospel
though he were but a Deacon, Act. 21.
it appears Act. 21. Where S. Luke speaks of him in this manner. And we
entering into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven,
etc. And further, that he still remained Deacon, although he was now departed
from Gualter.
Jerusalem, M. Gualter declares in the eight of the Acts, in these words:
Although it was the office of Deacons to take charge of the common treasures
of the Church, and of the poor, yet was it heerewith permitted unto them to
take the office of preaching, if at anyttme necessity required, as we have
hitherto seen in the example of Stephen. And peradventure there was not so
great need of Deacons at Jerusalem, when the Church was through persecution
dispersed: and therefore they which before werc stewardes of the Church
goods, did give them selves wholly to the ministry of the word. The Epipha.
de Simone and Simoniac.
words of Epiphanius, whom M. Gualter mentions, be these: For when Philip
being a Deacon had not authority to lay on hands, that thereby he might
give the holy Ghost, etc. Whereby it is plain, that Philip being Deacon did
baptize, though he had not authority imponendi manus, to lay on hands.

Augustine also in his questions, speaking of Philip, says thus: Et iternm
mnltum Aug. in quaest. ex vtroque test.
distare inter Diaconum and Sacerdotem, liber approbat quem dicimus actus
Apostolorum etc. Again the book, which we call the Acts of the Apostles,
does prove that a Deacon differs much from a Priest, for when they of
Samaria believed the preaching of Philip the Deacon, they sent (says he) unto
them Peter and John. etc.

The second division.
T. C. Page. 128. Lin. 19. and Sect. 1.
After you say that Deacons are not permitted with us to celebrate the Lords
supper, and why then should they be suffered to minister baptism? as if the
one Sacrament were not as precious as the other. This is a miserable rending in
sunder of those things which God has joined together, not only to separate
the ministry of the Sacraments from the word, but also the ministry of one
sacrament from an other.

And what reason is there, that it should be granted unto one that can not
preach (being as they Why* do you account him no minister* this gear would
be marked.
call him a minister) to minister both the sacraments, when as the same is not
permitted unto a Deacon (as they call him) which is able to preach? I do not
speak it, for that I would have those which be deacons in deed, that is,
which have charge to provide for the poor of some one congregation, should
either preach or minister the sacraments, but I say that it is against all
reason to permit the ministry of the sacraments to those which can not
preach, and to deny it to those which are able to preach.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do but in that point agree with the Scriptures, and all other writers, for
the most part, both old and new, who testify that Deacons did preach the
word, and minister the Sacrament of Baptism. But I can not read in any
author, where they ministered the Communion, and therefore I am bold to speak
as I have learned out of the holy Scriptures, and other godly writers: neither
is this to rende in sunder either the Sacraments from the word, or the
Sacraments from them selves: but to keep the order used in the Church in the
Apostles time, and since their time.

No man that is able to preach, being for his other qualities also meet, is
debarred from ministering the Sacraments, if he be in the ministry: but no man
be he never so able in all respects, may presume to take an office upon him,
whereunto he is not called. Therefore he that can not preach, and yet by the
order of the Tract. 6. and cap. 1. Tract. 9. cap. 1 diuis. 15.
Church is admitted to minister the Sacraments, is a lawful minister of the
same: and he that can preach, except by order he be thereunto called, may
not intrude him self into any function of the ministry. I have also declared
before, that even from the beginning, the administration of the Sacraments
have been committed to some, to whom the preaching of the word has not
been committed.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 118. Sect. 2.
It is true that in the primitive Church, the office of a Deacon was to
collect and provide for the poor, but not only, for it was also their office
to preach, and to baptize. For Stephen and Philip being Deacons did preach
the Gospel. Acts. 6. 7. 8. And Philip did baptize the Eunuche. Act. 8.

T. C. Page 128. Sect. 1.
In the. 118. page, unto the example of Philip he adds S. Stephen, which was
one of the Deacons, which he affirms to have preached. But I deny it: for
all that long oration which he has in the seventh of the Acts, is no sermon,
but a de^ense of him self, against those accusations which were laid against
him, as No such thing to be found in Beza his annotations.
M. Beza does very learnedly and substantially prove in his annotations upon
those places of S. Stephens disputations and defense. Now to defend himself
being accused, is lawful not for the Deacons only, but for any other
Christian, and we read nothing that Stephen did there, either touching the
defense of his cause, or the sharp rebuking of the obstinate Pharisees and
Priests, but that the holy Martyrs of God which were no deacons nor ministers
have done with us, when they have been conuented before their persecutors: and
whereas he ^ayth, that Philip baptized, I have showed before by what authority
he did it, that is, not in that he was a Deacon, but for (...) he was an
Evangelist.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a hard and new devised shifte. You imagine (as I think) that you are
in Stephen his oration a serm^n.
the Logike or Philosophy schools, where you may feyne what distinctions you
list, but al will not serve. The accusations are contained in the. 13. and. 14.
verse of the. 6. chap. let the Reader compare his sermon with them, and judge
whether he spoke in the way of preaching, or of defending himself. Although a
man may make his Apology in preaching, and answer accusations in a sermon:
and surely that sharp and severe repr^hension, that he concludes with,
beginning at the. 51. verse, does evidently declare that it was a sermon:
Moreover it was in the Synagogue which was called the Synagogue of the
Libertines. etc. The end of it was to prove true religion, and the true
worshipping of God, to be affixed neither to the Temple, nor to external
ceremonies, but to consist of faith in God. And yet I do not deny but that
Stephen also did use this sermon as an answer to those matters, whereof he was
accused: but he answered in the way of preaching, and not of pleading. And that
does M. Gualter directly affirm: for Gualter.
although he call this an oration, and a defense, yet in the. 8. chap. he
proves by this example of Stephen, that Deaco^s were permitted together with
the charge of the goods of the Church, and of the poor, to preach, as I have
showed before. And the Authors of the Centuries, speaking of that time, say
thus: It appears also out of the. 6. and 8. of the Acts Cent. 1. lib. 2. cap.
7.
that Deacons did teach. And in the same book and chap. Others were Deacons,
whose office was to serve the tables at Jerusalem, so long as there was there a
co^munitie of goods. Act. 6. notwithstanding it appears by Steven, Act. 6.
and by Philip, Act. 8. that they did teach and work miracles, and every where
in other Churches, the office of Deacons was to teach and minister.

I can not find in M. Beza his Annotatio^s any such thing, as you here
affirm. Although if it were so, yet does it not improve this to be a sermon:
for then was the oration of Peter's no sermon. Act. 2. wherein he answered to
those that accused the Apostles of drunkenness: neither can Paul be said to
have preached. Act. 24. If this be true that an Apology may not be made by the
way of preaching. If it be lawful thus to invent distinctions to shift off so
manifest examples of Scriptures, then it is an easy matter to shift off any
thing that shall be propounded.

I have proved by the Scripture it self, by Epiphanius, and by M. Gualter, and
by the authors of the Centuries, that Philip being a Deacon did both baptize
and preach, and you only deny it, without either author or reason.

The. 4. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 118. Sect. 2.
Justinius Martyr one of the most ancient writers, in his second Deacons
helped in the ministration of the supper.
Apology says, that in the administration of the Supper, Deacons did
distribute the bread and the wine to the people. The same does M. Calvin
affirm of Deacons in his Institutions. chap. 19.

T. C. Page. 128. Sect. 1. 2. 3.
He adds further out of Iustine Martyr, that the Deacons did distribute the
bread and the wine, in the administration of the Supper. Tully says in a
certain place, that it is as great a point of wisdom in an advocate, or
pleader of causes, to hold back and to keep close that which is hurtful to
his cause, as it is to speak that which is profitable.

M. Doctor observes none of these points, for besides that the things which he
brought for the defense of the service book, are such, as they have before
appeared: in seeking to defend it, he manifestly oppugneth it. For before h^
said, that the book of service does not permit Deacons to minister the
supper of the Lord, and that by way of allowing of the book, and here proves
that the Deacons did minister the sacrament of the Supper, and that also as a
thing which he does allow of.

But to let that pass, I beseech thee (good Reader) mark, what a An (...) ^
(...) cavil.
ministering of the Supper this is, which Iustine makes mention of, and note
with what conscience M. Doctor handles this cause. Iustine says, that after
the Scriptures are read, and preached of, and prayers made, bread and wine, and
water was brought forth, and that the minister made prayers and thanksgiving
in the hearing of the people, (which is that which the Evangelists call the
blessing, and has been of later times called the consecration) and after that
the people were partakers of them, that then this being done, the Deacons do
carry of that which was left unto those which were not present (for that
corruption of sending the Communion unto the houses was then in the Church,
against which I have before spoken) now if to carry to a private house the
bread and wine which was blessed, or set aparte by prayers, and by obeying the
institution of Christ by the minister, be to minister the sacrament of the
Supper, than Serapions boy, of whom mention is made by Eusebius, ministered the
sacrament. For Serapion being sick, as Li. 6. ca. 43
I have before showed; and sending his boy to the minister for the sacrament,
received the same at the hands of his boy, for that the minister being sick,
could not come him self. So by M. Doctors reason Serapions boy ministered the
sacrament.

Io. Whitgifte.
Where does M. Doctor say that Deacons did minister the Lords supper? set
down his words: Is there no end of your falsifying and untrue gathering? Let
the Reader compare the words that I have recited out of Justinius Martyr with
your collection, and then judge of the honesty and sincerity of your dealing.
The Admonition so speaks of Deacons as though their office in the primitive
Church, had been only to gather, and to distribute alms. This I deny, and
prove that Deacons did then also preach, baptize, and distribute the bread and
the wine in the administration of the Lords Supper. I no where say, neither
do I believe that they did at any time minister the Lords Supper, and you
might have understood, that to distribute the bread and wine to the people in
the administration of the Supper, is not to minister the Sacrament of the
Supper. For these Deacons of whom Justinius Martyr speaks, yea and Serapions
boy also did the one, but they did not the other: and therefore the spirit of
cauilling has driven you to this surmise.

A man would not think, that one that has been the Queens Masesties public

divinity in Cambridge, should not know to distinguish, and put a difference
between ministering the sacrament, and helping to distribute the bread and the
cup of the sacrament. And if M. Doctor could not learn this in books, yet
he might have either seen it, or at least heard tell of it, in all reformed
Churches almost, where the Deacons do assist the minister in helping of him to
distribute the cup, and in some places also the bread, for the quicker and
speedier dispatche of the people, being so many in number, that if they should
al receive the bread and the cup at the ministers hand, they should not make an
end in eight hours, which by that assistance may be finished in two, which is
that that M. Calvin says. For he says, the deacons did reach the cup, and
makes no mention of the bread. And if this be to minister the sacrament, then
they that cut the loaf in pieces, they that fetch ye wine for the supper, they
that pour it forth from greater vessels into glasses and cups, or whosoever
aydeth any thing in this action, do minister the sacrament, than the which
thing there can be nothing more ridiculous.

Io. Whitgifte.
A man would not have thought, that one which has ambitiously desired to be
the Queens Majesty's divinity reader, and yet prete^deth such purity and

I pass all over quietly, desiring only the Reader to take these and such like

In the end M. Doctor to shut up this matter, says, that it is the first
step to the ministry, and so joined of S. Paul in the third chapter and
first Epistle to Timothy. But what a reason is this? to be a Deacon is the
first step to the ministry, therefore the Deacon may preach and minister the
sacraments, when as the contrary rather follows. For if it be a step to the
ministry, then it is not the ministry, but dyffereth from it, and so ought
not to do the things that belong to the minister.

can not so be understood, which is for that as the functions of a Deacon, or
a minister ^te (...): so are the gyfts also, whereby those functions are
executed likewise diverse, and therefore there may be some men for their wisdom
and gravity, discretion and faythfulnesse, ^ whatsoever other gyfts are
required in him that should do this office of providing for the poor and to be
a good de^co^: (...) notwithstanding for some impediment in his tongue, or for

minister of the word, and therefore the (...) being diverse, (...) those

Paul appoynteth that the (...) should be (as it were) the seed or frye of the
ministers, or that he mean^th by those words, that the deaconship is a step to
the pastorship. Which may yet also further appear, by the (...) offpecche
which the Apostle uses, for he does not say, that they that do the office of
a deaconship well, shall come to, or get a good standing, but he says, that in
so doing they doc get them (...) a good standing, that is, they get them
selves authority and estimation in the Church, whereby they may be both the
bolder to do their office, and whereby they may do it with more sruite, whereas
when they (...) naughtily, they neither dare do oftentimes that which they
should do, nor yet that which they do well takes so good effect, because of
the dyscredite, which comes by their evil (...). And so I conclude that M.
Doctor has brought hither to nothing, to prove why either Deacons ought, or
else have wont either to preach, or to minister the sacraments.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is not necessary that every one which is a Deacon, should be preferred to
the A deaconsh (...) a step into the ministerie^
ministry: for it may be that he shall so evil use him self in that
function, that he be thought unmeet further to be preferred. But you have not
read, as I think, sithence the Apostles time, of any that has been orderly
preferred to the ministry, not being D^acon before.

Ambrose, Chrysostom, the Greek Paraphrast, Bullinger, Gualter, Hemingi^s,
and diverse other do so expound these words of Paul. 1. Ti. 3. ( Qui been
ministraueru^t. gradu^ sibi honu^ ^cquirunt. etc.) that they make the
deaconship a step to the ministry. And therefore your reason had need be
very good, that shall convince all these of unskillfulness.

S. Paul does not make much difference betwixt the gyfts that are to be
required (...) a Bishop, and the gyfts that are to be required in a Deacon, as
it appears, 1. Tim. 3. and in deed if you respect the gyfts, required in
the^ both, there is not much difference between them, and therefore your reason
is not so strong, as you make it. Moreover I never heard that an impediment in
the tongue, or some want of utterance were sufficient cau^ to debar a man
(otherwise meet) from the ministry. In deed S. Paul requires that he
should be aptus ad docendu^, which he may be, though he has some impe^iment in
speech. For S. Paul does not mean by these words, volubilitie of tongue, but
wisdom, discretion, and order in teaching. If you mean such a one, as either
cannot speak at al, or not utter his mind in such sort, as he may be
understood, him I think neither to be sit for to be minister, nor a deacon,
but (as I told you before it is not necessary, that whosoever is deacon should
after be minister, no more than it is that a Bacheler of Art should be a Master
of Art, or a Bacheler of divinity a Doctor, for there may be just causes to
stay the^ from proceeding any further. And therefore says S. Paul 1. Tim. ^.
Qui been ministr au^rint, (...) bonu^ acquirunt. etc. They which have
ministered well, get themselves a good degree. So that this reason of yours is
easily pushed away. I know (...) ^o exp^unde the words of S. Paul as you ^o,
and the interpretation is not amiss: yet are not the reasons sufficient to
improve the other, to the which I most incline, because it is allowed of
most learned men, and the words themselves do very fitly bear it. But the
matter does not depend only upon these words of S. Paul, but upon the
continual practice of the Church also from time to time.

And albeit M. Doctor be not able to show it, yet I confess that it has
been in times past, permitted unto them in some Churches to baptize, in other
some to preach and baptize, and sometimes also to minister the supper: but I
say also that this was a corruption, and used at those times, when there were
very many other gross and intolerable abuses, from the which I do appeal
unto that, which was first, that is, the institution of the Apostles, which
limited and bounded every function within his several limits and borders,
which it ought not to pass.

little more. Tertullian in his book de baptismo has these words, Baptizandi

Diaconi, non tamen sine Episcopi authoritate, propter Ecclesiae honorem: The
high Priest, which is the Bishop, has authority to baptize, so have the

They had no introite, for Celestinus a Pope brought it in, about the year.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 94. Sect. 1. 2.
What you understand here by the Introite, certaynely I know The introite.
not. The first thing that we say at the Communion is the Lords prayer, which
Celestinus did not invent, but Christ. Matthew. 6. nor The Apostles began the
Lords supper with the Lords prayer,
first use in the celebration of the Lords Supper, but the Apostles, as we
read in good Chronicles: next unto that is a very godly and necessary prayer,
worthy to be said in the celebration of such a mystery, and therefore no
matter at all who invented it, or brought it in: And yet Celestinus was a
godly Bishop, and the Church of Rome, at that time had the substance of the
sacraments, according to Gods word, neither was there any superstition mixed
with them: notwithstanding I know not any Introite of Celestinus inue^tion,
that Celestinus introite what it was.
we have in our order of the Communion: for the Introite that he appointed was
one of the psalms, as Volateranus, Gratianus, and Polydorus Vergiliu^ do
testify. And we have not any psalm in the celebratio^ of the supper: if we
had, it were not to be reproved.

This I am sure of, that it is not evil, because it is in the Mass book,
except it be repugnant to the word of God: for the Lords prayer The epistle and
Gospel.
some of the psalms, the Gospells and Epistles, the Nicene creed etc. be in
the Mass book, and yet good, so is there some other good prayers in it also.

The second* They read no fragments of the Epistle and Gospel, we use both.

Answer Page 94. Sect. vlt. and. Page 95. Sect. 1.
And what fault can you find in that? is not the whole scripture, and every
piece of it profitable to edify? can the scripture at any time in the open
congregation be read out of season, being in a known tongue? but I think your
quarrel is at reading, not against the Epistle and the Gospel.

Always in the Church there has bin red the scriptures in the celebration of
the mysteries, and I am sure, the Gospel was not wont to be read from the one
end to the other at one time. Well, Reading of scriptures at the communion.

it is but your opinion without reason, that the Epistle and Gospel ought
not to be read at that time: for you bring no proof, and I think the

word of God, it was collected by that famous Council of Nice, to confound
that detestable heresy of the Arrians, and therefore meet to be read in all
Christian congregations, neither can any mislyke it, but Arrians and such
like, of the which sect you give just suspicions that you be fautors. This
Creed in this form was not framed in the Apostles time, because the heresy
of Arrius was not then hatched. And therefore no good reason to say it was not
read in the Apostles time at the communion: Ergo it ought not to be read now.
But this argument is intolerable, the Nicene Creed is read at the communion,
therefore the communion is not sincerely ministered. All these three reasons be
taken ab authoritate negative: and therefore of no force, except we will also
grant these to be true, and such like, scilicet, Then they had no Christian
Princes, and therefore we may have no Christian Princes. Then they had no
civil or politic laws, Ergo we ought to have none. Then the Church had no
external peace, but was under persecution, Ergo it should have no peace now.
Then Christians had propriety in nothing, but all things were common: Ergo no
man may have any thing of his own, but common to other: we do not read
expressly, that Children were then baptized, therefore they ought not to be
baptized now (for so do the Anabaptists reason) neither do we read that women
did then receive the supper, therefore they ought not to do it now: with
infinite other as absurd as these.

fragments of the Epistles and Gospels, and the rehearsal of the Nicene
creed, I have declared before the causes of our misliking, neither mean I to
stand to refute the slanderous surmises, which M. Doctor raises of the authors
of the Admonition, whereby he would bring them into the suspicion of
Arrianisme, to whom all those that fear God bear witness, that they are
most far from. He him self notwithstanding once again in the last of
these three sections. 96. page does lay the manyfeste foundations of that part
of Anabaptisme, which stands in having all things common, saying directly
against S. Peter, that in 5. Act.
the time of the Apostles, Christians had propriety in nothing. And further
giving great cause of triumph of the one side to the Eatabaptists, and such as
deny the baptism of young infants, in matching that with those things which
the church may (although not without incommoditie, yet without impiety) be
without: and of the other side unto the Papists, whylest he says that we
read not of any women which received the Lords supper in the Apostles time.
For this is that they allege to prove their unwritten verities, when as it is
easyly answered both to the Papists, and M. Doctor, that forsomuche as the
Apostle does witness, that the Churches of Corinthe consisting of men and
women did receive, that therefore women also did receive, and were partakers of
the Lords table. Thus it is manifest that M. Doctor only to displease the
authors of the Admonition, sticks not to He pleasureth them in declaring the
absurdities of their arguments.
pleasure three notable heretics, Anabaptists, Catabaptistes, and Papists.

Io. Whitgifte.
Yet you should here have excused their ignorance, in certain points and their
absurd reasoning: but seeing you are content so lightly to pass all this over,
and leaving the defense of the Admonition, seek to confute my collections, I
am content also that it stand untouched, and will answer that which you
only seem to misselyke.

I do not otherwise suspect them of Arrianisme, than they have given just
occasion, by dislyking the public reading of that Creed, which was purposely
made to overthrow Arrianisme. I trust there is a great number of such as fear
God in the Church of England that know not them, but yet for their rashness
in this point, have them in some suspiition.

By these examples of negative arguments from the Scriptures, I overthrow all
the Anabaptists reasons, that they do, or can use in the defense of their
errors, so do I likewise yours, used against this Church of England, neither
speak I any otherwise of the baptism of infantes, or of women's receiving the
Communion, than M Zuinglius does in his Elench. against the Anabaptists, and
M. Calvin also in his book written against them.

But this answer sore troubles you, and therefore you only reply against it
with slanderous words: but least you should by such means abuse the Reader,
I will set^e down both Zuinglius and Caluines words. M. Zuinglius in his
Elench. contra Zuinglius.
Anabap. says thus: You can find no hole to escape at. For you foolyshly
reason negatiuely from deeds and examples, nay from no deeds and no
examples. For what do you else when you say, we read not that the Apostles
did baptize infantes, Ergo, infantes ought not to be baptized? Does not all
the force of your reasons consyste herein? And again: Wherefore it is to be
marvelled at, with what face they dare measure the Baptism of Infantes by the
Scripture, or rather by not scripture, for they have nothing in the Scripture
whereunto they may trust, but they make only the negative their foundation,
when they say: we read not that the Apostles baptized infantes, therefore
they ought not to be baptized. etc. And in his book de Baptismo: of the
baptism of infantes and the first original thereof neither I, nor any other
man can otherwise affirm (if we respect the express and evident word of God)
than that it is that true and only baptism of Christ. For we may find many
things of this sort, whereof although there be no express and plain
testimony of God, yet they are not repugnant to his will, but rather agrees
with the same: of this sort is that, that we make women partakers of the Lords
supper, when as notwithstanding we read of none that sat down in that Supper
which Christ did institute. And M. Calvin in his book aduersus Anabaptist.
says in like Calvin.
manner, They have nothing to say against the Baptism of infantes, but that
there is no where any mention made that the Apostles did use it: to this I
answer, that no more do we read in any place, that they did at any time
minister the Supper of our Lord to any woman. And yet these two be neither
Anabaptists* Catabaptistes, nor Papists, but valiant captains against them
all.

Chap. 1. the second Division.
Admonition.
The fourth. There was then accustomed to be an examination of the
communicantes, which now is neglected.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 96. Sect. 2. 3.
How prove you that there was then any examination of communicantes?
Examination of communicantes.
If there had been either commandment or example for it in Scriptures, I
am sure you would not have left it vnquoted in the margent. Saint Paul
says. 1. Cor. 11. Probet 1. Cor. 11.
bomo seipsum. Let a man examine him self. etc. But he speaks of no other
examination: wherefore this reason of youres is altogether frivolous and
without reason.

And yet I do not disallowe the examination of communicants, so there be a
discreet respect had of the persons, places, and other circumstances, neither
is it neglected in this Church of England, but by learned and discrete
ministers, with learning and discretion used. But note I pray you the force of
this argument: some ministers neglecte to examine the communicantes, Ergo, the
Communion is not rightly and syncerely ministered, as though the examination of
the communicantes were of the substance of the sacrament. If you would reason
after your accustomed manner, you should rather conclude thus, the Apostles
were not examined when they received the communion, neither is it expressed in
Scriptures that they examined others, therefore there ought to be no such
examination: this is your usual manner of reasonyng, but it is chyldish, unless
it were to conclude damnation or salvation.

T. C. Page 130. Sect. 2.
M. Doctor asks how it is proved that there was any examination of the
communicantes. After this sort, all things necessary were vsee in the
churches of God in the Apostles times, but examination of those, whose
knowledge of the mystery of the Gospel was not known or doubted of, was a
necessary thing, therefore it was used in the churches of God which were in
the Apostles time.

Io. Whitgifte.
I deny your minor, first, because no such at that time would offer
themselves to receive the communion. Secondly, because if any such did offer
themselves, not being known, the fault is particular to themselves, and
touches them only, not the whole Church. Thirdly, because if it had been so
necessary a thing, Saint Paul would not have omitted it, especially when
he had an especial cause to speak of it, as he had when he spoke of private
examination of a man's self, 1. Cor. 11. Probet autem seipsum home. etc. Of
the which words M. Calvin speaking in ^. Cor. 11. Calvin.
his book against the Anabaptists says thus: But what need we so to dispute?
seeing the Apostle himself in an other place treating of the manner, how every
man should be prepared to the receyning of the Supper of the Lord (as it
behooves him) does not bid every one too examine the faults of his
neighbor, but speaks after this manner, Probet seipsum bomo. etc. Let a
man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this
cup: for he that cateth and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks his
own damnation. In which words there are two things to be observed. First,
that to communicate with those that are unworthy, is not to eat the bread of
the Lord unworthily, Two things worthy the noting, for those which shall
communicate.
but not to prepare himself as he ought to do, and not to expend and consider
his own faith and repentance. The second, that when the supper is to be
received, we begin not with other men to examine them, but that we try
ourselves: and surely if all things were exactly considered, even they which
have so much leisure to enquire of other men's behavior, are for the most part
negligent, and forgetful of their own duties. So that it is necessary for
every man to examine himself, and not so necessary for one man to examine
another. But what I think of this kind of examining by other, I have declared
in my Answer to the Admonition.

examine themselves, that they may be ready to eat the passover, according to

Priests, nor the Levites did did ever use any such kind of examination before
the eating of the Passover, as you would insinuate, and therefore as yet you
are utterly destitute of a commandment.

this argument. S. Paul commands that every man should prove him self, ergo,
there is no commandment, that the ministers should prove and examine them? so
I may say, that every man is a spiritual king to govern himself, therefore he
may not be governed by others. The authors of the Admonition do not mean that
every one should be examined, as those whose understanding in the Gospel is
well known, or which do examine themselves, and so they interpret
themselves, in the. 108. page.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely it holds as the most part of your arguments do, that is loosely:
for it is your reason, it is not mine: If I have framed any such argument, it
will appear in my Answer. But this is your manner peuishly to pervert my
words, and therefore have you concealed my book, least your Reader should
epsy you, as he must needs do, if he has any judgment.

Neither do I mislyke, that there should be examination of the communicantes,

as I have said in my Answer: but I mislyke this wrangling at the
administration of the sacraments used in this church without cause: neither
would I have this kind of examination counted as necessary, seeing it is no

primitive Church.

allege it to prove that the Supper may be ministered with bread only: But
learned interpreters, and especially M. Calvin, deny this place to be mente
of the ministration of the supper: how soever it is understood, it does not
necessarily prove, that the Sacrament was then ministered in common and usual
bread, for there is no mention made of the kind of bread.

If any think better of one kind of bread than of an other, in the
ministration of the Sacrament, it is their error, and derogateth nothing
from the order of administration.

M. Calvin in his Institutions cap. 19. sect. 72. touching this ma ter writes
on this sort: Caeterum in manum accipiant fideles necne: inter se diuidant, an

These be indifferente things, and put in the liberty of the Church.

is reported in some writers that he appointed unleavened bread to be used in
the Euchariste, because that Christ himself used the same according to the
law written Exodus 12. Deuteron. 16. But that he brought in wafer cakes, or
appointed any certain form of bread, you can not prove, neither does any
credible author write it.

Io. Whitgifte.
To all this there is not one word answered.

Chap. 1. the. 6. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 97. Sect. 2. and Page 98. Sect. 1.
The truth is, that it skils not what kind of bread is used, leuened or
unleavened so it be bread, although it were to be wished for the auoydyng of
superstition, that common and usual bread were used, Usual bread.
and also that the form were altered, and the quantity increased. But these
things are not de substantia Sacramenti, and therefore not sufficient to prove
that the Supper is not sincerely ministered.

M. Bucer likewise in his censure upon the book of Common prayers is of the
same judgment, his words be these: The third chapter M. Bucers opinion.
is of the substance, form, and breaking of bread, which all do well
enough agree with the institution of Christ, whom it is manifest to have
used unleavened bread, and easy to be broken, for he brake it, and gave to his
disciples pieces of the bread broken. Touching the form and figure, whether
it were round or square, there is nothing declared of the Evangelists. And
because this bread is used only for a sign, and not for corporal
nourishemente, I see not, what can be reprehended in this description of the
bread which is in this book, except some vvoulde peradventure have it
thicker, that it may the more fully represente the form of true bread.

T. C. Page 130. Sect. vlt.
I have spoken of this bread before in general, and if M. Doctor did not
disagree with himself, we are here well agreed. For first he fay the, it
skilleth not what bread we have (...) by and by he says, that he wishes it
were common bread, and assigns a great cause, which the book of service
likewise assigns, which is, to avoid superstition, and it is certainly known
by experience that in diverse places, the ignorant people that have bin misseled
in popery, have (...) kneeled unto it, and held up their hands whilst the
minister has given it not those only which have received it, but those
which have bin in the Church and looked on. I speak of that which I know,
and have seen with my eyes. Another reason is alleged by M. Bucer, which
is, that there being some thicker substance of bread, and such as should move
and stir up the taste better, the consideration of the mind which is conneyed
by the senses, might be also the more effectual, and so the fruit of receiving
greater. By the way note that either Or else you speak of a matter you know
not.
Bucers censures upon the book of service be falsely ascribed unto him, or be
corrupted, or else were not even in his own time here thought good,
substantial and sufficient, when there is some cause by act of Parliament
afterward found (I mean in the second book of King Edward) to mislike water
cakes, and to change them into common bread. Howsoever it be, that circumstance
would be well marked, that it was one thing to talk of a water cake in the use
of ye supper in King Edwards dais before they were justly abolished, and
another thing, now being revoked, after they were renioued.

Io. Whitgifte.
I am constant and agree with my self in the truth I thank God for it. I
know the kind of bread to be indifferents my private judgment I have in my
Answer uttered. But in such matters I submit my self to the determination of
the Church, to whom God does give his spirit most abundantly, so long as it
follows and embraces the truth.

The danger that you speak of, is in the form, and figure of the bread, not
in the other qualities, nor in the substance: and therefore not perteyning to
any thing that I have spoken. For the question is of leauened, or unleavened
bread, not of roundnesse or squarenesse. etc. Although the form and figure
also is indifferente, and in the power of the Church to appoint: wherefore
there may no schism or division in the Church be made for it.

M. Bucers censures were upon the first book in King Edwards time, not upon
Bucers censure upon the first book (...) King Edwards days.
the second, therefore you are deceived. The Church has authority in things
indifferent to abolish or revoke as occasion serves: and therefore that
circumstance is not worth the noting.

Besides that, we be called by the example of our sa^ionce Christ to vse^ the

2. Chro. 35. before alleged, it seems you would, then must we make it a
matter of necessity, to have unleavened bread: but as that is (...), so is
this also: for the kind of bread is indifferent, although (as M. Bucer says)
it comes nearer to the institution The kind of bread of itself indifferent
of Christ to use vnle^uened bread, because he did celebrate his supper with
it, if there were not other circumstances and reasons to move the Church
sometimes to use the contrary.

But this is a gross oversight of M. Doctor, both (...) this section and that
which goes (...) fore, that he has not learned to make a difference between
that which is not ^ncerely done, and that which is not at al done, For in the
former (...) upon the Admonition because they conclude that for as much as
there is no examination therefore it is not (...) and sincerely ministered. For
says he, the examination of the communicantes, is not of the Iubstaunce of
the sacrament, and in this section he says, that for as much as it is not of
the substance of the sacrament whether there be leauened or unleavened bread,
therefore it is not sufficiently proved that the sacrament is not sincerely
ministered: but he ought to have understood, that if either the matter of the
sacrament as bread and wine, or the form of it, which is the institution
(which things are only substantial parts) were wanting, that then there should
have bin no sacrament ministered at all, but they being retained, and yet other
things used which are not convenient, the sacrament is ministered but not
sincerely. For example in the popish baptism, there was the substance of
baptism, but there being used spittle and cream, and candels and such
beggarly trumperie, it was not sincerely ministered, therefore it is one thing
to minister sincerely and another thing to minister, so that that which is of
the substance should be wanting. But of this distinction I have spoken in
another place, whereinto although M. Doctor falls in the next section, and in
other places, yet this shall be an answer for all.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is as grossly replied unto: but my belief is, that the sacrament is as
purely and sincerely ministered, with the one, as it is with the other. For not
every fond, superstitious or vain opinion of every private person in this or
that ceremony, ^erogateth any thing, from the pure and sincere administration
of the sacraments, except it can be showed that the things used be wicked,
unlawful or superstitious of themselves. Wherefore this is a gross quarrel of
yours, it is no ouersighte of mine, for I am well assured of the right and
sincere administration of the sacraments in this Church, both touching
substance, ceremonies, and other circumstances. And it is too much injury that
you do to this Church of England, in comparing the ceremenies thereof (which he
pure) to the corrupt and superstitious ceremonies of the Papists used in
baptism. But how should you otherwise utter your contempt or great spite
against it.

Chap. 1. the. 9. Division.
Answer to the Admonition Page 99. Sect. 1.
These words that you use ( like their God of the altar) be slanderous and
false, we are as far from thinking the bread to be our God as you, and teach
as sound doctrine touching this sacrament: And therefore you show of what
spirit you be.

T. C. Page 131. Sect. 2.
The meaning of the Admonition in saying (their God of the Altar) is plain
enough, that it is understood of the Papists, but that M. Doctor does set
himself to draw the authors of it into hatred, and he cannot be ignorant, that
when a man speaks of things which are (...) known, he often uses (the, or
that, or their,) without naming the things which he speaks of.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of the Admonition be these: Then they ministered with common and
usual bread now with wafer cakes brought in by Pope Alexander, being in form,
fashion and substance like their God of the Altar. Now let the Reader judge
whether I charge them (...) or no. Your excuse is but for a fashion, their
opinion of this whole Church, is as peeuishly and opprobriously uttered in
sundry other places of their book, as it is in this. And therefore there is no
great doubt of their meaning or if their meaning be not so, yet was it
unadvisedly set down in that order, that me may justly suspect their meaning
to be so.

sitting: we kneeling according to Honorius decree.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 99. Sect. 1. 2. 3.
The places of scripture that you quote in the margente to prove sitting at the
communion, declare that Christ and his disciples sat Kneeling and sitting at
the Communion.
at the table, but that proves nothing. For you might as well have said,
they received after supper, we before dinner: they at night, we in the
morning: they after meat, we before meat, they in a private house we in the
open Church, they being all men and in number twelve, we together with women,
not strictly observing the number of twelve or any other number above three or
four.

This your argument touches them as well as it does us, which receive it
standing or walking. But to sit, stand, kneel or walk be not of the
substance of the Sacrament: and therefore no impediments why it may not be
sincerely ministered.

It be houeth humble and meek spirits, in such indifferent matters to submit
themselves to the order of the Church, appointed by lawful authority, and
not to make schisms and contentions in the Church for the satisfying of their
own fantasies.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nothing answered.

Chap. 1. the. II. Division.
Answer to the Admonition Page 99. Sect. vlt. and. Page 100. Sect. 1.
Kneeling the meetest gesture.

Touching kneeling at the communion it forces not who did first appoint it
(although I can find no such decree made by Honorius) it is the meetest manner
of receiving this sacrament in mine opinion, being commonly used in praying and
giving of thanks, both which are annexed to this sacrament, and are to be
required in the co^municants, and therefore I think this to be a good reason:
the meet est gesture for praying and tha^ksgiuing is kneeling, but those that
receive the Eucharist pray and give thanks, Ergo the meetest gesture for them
is kneeling.

The only peril is adoration, which may as well be committed sitting or
standing. But wherefore then serves preaching? there is as much danger of
contempt the one way, as there is of adoration the other way. In such matters
Christian magistrates have authority to appointe what they think most
convenient, and the same must be observed of those that be pacifici, and not
contentiosi. But of sitting and kneeling at the communion more is to be spoken
hereafter in the second part.

T. C. Page 131. Sect. 3.
Although it be not of necessity that we should receive the communion sitting,
yet there is the same cause of abolishing kneeling, that there is of removing
the wafer cake, and if there be danger of superstition in one (as M. Doctor
confesses) why is there not danger in the other? and if there be men that take
occasion to fall at the one, and that by superstition, how comes it to pass
that M. Doctor in the. 180. page says ye neither gospeller, nor Papists,
obstinate nor simple, can superstitiosly offend in this kneeling, when as the
kneeling carries a greater show of worship, and imprinteth in the minds of
the ignorant a stronger opinion, and a deeper print of adoration, than the
sight of a round cake. And if kneeling be so void of all fault, as M. Doctor
would make us believe, how came it to pass, that in King Edwards days, there
was a protestation added in the book of prayer, to clear that gesture from
adoration.

Io. Whitgifte.
If this be a sufficient argument, to alter and change so decent and comely an
order and gesture in praising God, then what order can stand in the church,
seeing there is nothing that may not be abused? My words in the. 180. page be
true, and as yet unanswered. I will set them down in their place, that the
Reader may perceive how little you are able to say against them.

The protestation made in king Edwards days touching this gesture, was to
satissye (if it might be) such quarellers as you are, and to take away all
occasion of cauilling, not for any great sear of adoration.

Chap. 1. the. 12. Division.
T. C. Page 131. Sect. vlt.
Another reason why kneeling should be taken away, is for that sitting agrees
better with the action of the supper, whereunto M. Doctor takes exception,
both in this place, and where he speaks again of it, that for so much as this
sacrament is a sacrament of thanksgiving, and thanksgiving a prayer, therefore
kneeling to be most fit, as that which we use ordinarily when we pray.

Io. Whitgifte.
If this be a good reason, then let the sacrament be ministered at night, for
that does most of all agree with the supper, let there be also other meat, and
let it be made a supper in all points. But are you come now to the gross
imagination of the manner and form of an earthly and terrestrial supper?
Christ does will us in the celebration Math. 26.
of this sacrament to express his death and passion until he come, and not
the manner of his sitting at the table. But to such unapt reasons does the
absurdity of your cause drive you, and therefore you are to be pitied rather
than confuted.

Chap. 1. the. 13. Division.
T. C. Page 132. Sect. 1.
But he should have remembered that that thanksgiving may well come after we
have received the sacrament, and that whilst we receive the bread and wine of
the sacrament, we are not then most fit to speak, they being in our mouths,
and during the time we receive them, our mind is occupied in considering the
inestimable benefit which the Lord has bestowed upon us, and to meditate of
the fruit which we receive thereby, by the Analogy and comparison, between the
bodily nourishment and the spiritual, that by these consyderations our minds
may be more enflamed, and set on fire, and our mouths may be filled, with the
praise of God, after we have received.

Io. Whitgifte.
And you should have learned that the whole action of this supper is a
thanksgyuing, and therefore it is called Eucharistia, so that kneeling is a
convenient gesture for it, during the whole time of the celebration: Moreover
who can be void of thanks, when he is in that consideration you speak of^can
any Christian heart think of the unspeakable benefyts of the death and passion
of Christ, exhibited unto him in this sacrament, and not together be moved in
heart and mind to give thanks? for thankfulness is as well in heart and
thought, as it is in word: and a man may give most hearty thanks unto God, who
understands his cogitations, though he speak not one word, Ah dally not,
dally not in Gods mysteries, seek not for vain reason against most meet and
convenient orders.

Chap. 1. the. 14. Division.
T. C. Page 132. Sect. 1.
And further if this be a good reason, that therefore it is meet we should
kneel at the supper for as much as we give thanks, then it follows that when
soever we have supped or dined, it is meet that we should kneel, when as yet
we do say grace sitting. And by this he accuses our Savior Christ, and his
Apostles, as those which did not use that which was most fit, for in his
judgment he says kneeling is the fittest site, or position of the body which
can be, and if our Savior Christ had bin of that judgment, undoubtedly he
would have also kneeled, and caused his Apostles so to do.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do not speak of every private man's gesture in every private place. I know
that a man may also pray sitting, lying, standing, walking and riding. I speak
of the public gesture most meet to be used in praying and thanksgiving in the
public congregation: and therefore I say again that in the public Church,
though kneeling be not the only, yet it is the fittest gesture for praying:
neither can you more object the sitting of Christ against it, than you may
his supping at night, against our receiving in the morning.

Chap. 1. the. 15. Division.
Admonition.
The fourth reason. In this book we are enjoined to receive the communion
kneeling, which beside that it has in it a ( 1. The. 5. 22 Exo. 12. 11.
) show of Papistrie, does not so well express the mystery of this holy
supper. For as in the old testament eating the Pascall lamb standing,
signified a readynesse to pass, even so in the receiving of it now sytting (
Mat. 26. 20 Mar. 14. 18 Luc. 22. ^4. John. 13. 28
) according to the example of Christ, we signify rest, that is, a full
finishing through Christ ( Gala. 4. 10. Ga. 5. 3. 4. 5 Hebr. in many places.
of all the ceremonial law, and a perfect work of redemption wrought, that
gives rest for ever. And so we avoid also the danger of idolatry, which
was in times past to common, and yet is in the hearts of many, who have not as
yet forgotten their breaden God, so slenderly have they been instructed.
Against which we may set the commandment, Thou ( Exo. 20. 5.
) shall not bow down to it, nor worship it.

Answer Page 180. Sect. vlt. etc.
You say, sitting is the most meetest gesture, because it signifies rest, that
is a full finishing thorough Christ of all the ceremonial law. etc. What? are
you now come to The Admonitors fly to allegories.
allegories and to significations? Surely this is a very papisticall reason:
nay then we can give you a great deal better significations of the surples, of
crossing, of the ring in marriage, and many other ceremonies, tha^ this is of
sitting. I pray you in the whole scripture where does sitting signify a full
finishing of the ceremonial law, and a perfect work of redemption that gives
rest for ever? If allegories please you so well, let us have either standing
which signifies a readiness to pass (used also in the eating of the passover)
or kneeling, which is the proper gesture for prayer, and thanksgiving, and
signifies the submission and humbleness of the mind. But you say, Christ sat
at his supper, therefore we must sit at the receiving of the supper. You may as
well say, Christ did celebrate his supper at night, after supper, to twelve,
only men and no women, in a parloure, within a private house, the thursday at
night before Easter, therefore we ought to receive the communion at night,
after supper, being twelve in number, and only men, in a parlour, within a
private house, the thursday at night before Easter. But who sees not the Non
sequitur of this argument?

T. C. Page 132. Sect. 1.
In the. 181. page unto the Admonition saying that sitting is most fit,
because it betokens rest, and accomplishment of the ceremonies in our
savior Christ, M. Doctor says it is a Papistical lreason, and triumphs
over the Authors of the Admonition, because they allegory, when as
notwithstanding the surples before, crossing, and rings, etc. afterward are
defended by nothing but with vain allegories, which have nothing so good
grounds as this has. But let it be that this is not sound a reason (as indeed
for my part I will not defend it, and the authors themselves have corrected it)
yet M. Doctor might have dealt easilier withal than to call it a papistic^ll
reason, In liturgia eccle. pere.
which is far from popery, and the reason of two notable learned and zealous
men Johannes Alasco, and of M. Hooper in his commentary upon the Prophet Jonas.

Io. Whitgifte.
I call it Papisticall, because the Papists ground the most points of their
doctrine upon allegories, as the authors of the Admonition do their sitting. I
neither defend surplis nor any thing else by allegories, but I show that I
might do it, much better than they do sitting at the Communion.

Answer to the Admonition Page 180 Sect. 3.
You say kneeling is a show of evil, and for proof thereof you allege. 1.
Thessa. 5. Absteyne from all appearance of evil. How follows this, The
Apostle wills us to absteyne, from all appearance of evil: therefore kneeling
at the communion is a show of evil? But your meaning is, that because the
Papists kneeled at the sacring of the Mass (as they called it) therefore we
may not kneel at the receiving of the communion: you may as well say, they
prayed to images and saints kneeling, therefore we may not pray kneeling.

The places written in your margent to prove, that Christ did sit at Page 181.
sect. 1. and. 2.
supper be needelesse, and were used for the same purpose before, where I have
also spoken my opinion of kneeling.

If you cite the Galat. 4. and. 5. and the Epistle to the Hebrews in many
places, to prove that sitting signifies rest, that is, a full finishing of the
ceremonial law: you do but delude the Readers, and abuse the Scriptures, for
there is no such matter to be found in them. If you allege them to prove that
Christ is the full finishing of the the Ceremonial law, you take upon you to
prove that which no man doubts of, and is very far from your purpose.

You note also the. 20. of Exodus: Thou shalt not bow down to Page 182.
sect. 1
them, nor worship them, to prove that we may not kneel at the communion: but
how fitly, every child may judge. For what sequel is there in this argument?
God in the second commandment forbids worshipping of images, therefore we
may not receive the communion kneelyng.

T. C. Page 132. Sect. 1.
For the rest which he has here, or in the. 180. and. 181. page, it is either
answered before (as that the danger of adoration may be taken away) or has no
matter worthy the answeryng. I only admonish the Reader, that sytting at the
communion is not holden to be necessary, but only I think that kneeling is
very dangerous, for the causes before alleged.

Io. Whitgifte.
An easy kind of answering, and a very slender defense for the crooked
handeling of the scriptures, by the authors of the Admonition. But it is
wittily done, so to pass over that which you can not mainteyn. Surely the
authors of the Admonition are very little beholding to you, for in most places
you leave them to answer for themselves.

If sitting at the communion be not holden to be necessary, why do you then
make a schism Contention about external rites become not the church of God.
1. Cor. 11.
in the church for it? do not you know yt M. Calvin, M. Bullinger, and others,
writing against the Anabaptists, do especially condemn them for making a
tumulte in the Church about external and indifferente things? S. Paul
says, If any lust to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the
Churches of God, and he means in external rites. But the question is whether
the church must give place to you, or you to the church, in that thing that by
your own confession may be used.

The seventh. Then it was delivered generally, and indefinitely. Take ye ( Mat.

words take thou, eat thou. etc. The plural number includes the singular.


Answer to the Admonition. Page 100. Sect. 3. 4.
Here is a high matter in a low house, he that says, Take ye and eat ye,
does he not also say in effect, take thou and eat thou? Does not the
Plural number include the singular? Christ, Matthew. 6. says: Ad hunc igitur
modum orate vos, Pray ye on this manner: may we not therefore say, pray thou
on this manner if we speak to one singular person? so speaking to all his
Apostles he says: Ite in vniuersum mundum, Go into all the world.

We use the plural number when we speak to many ioyntely, we use the singular
number when we speak to one severally.

And for as much as every one that receives this sacrament, Every one must
apply the sacrament to him self.
has to apply unto himself the benefits of Christ's death and passion,
therefore it is convenient to be said to every one: Take thou, eat thou. But
this objection is so ridiculous, that it is more worthy to be hissed at, than
to be confuted.

T. C. Page 132. Sect. 2.
Unto the three next sections contained in the. 100. and. 101. page. I have
spoken already, when as I showed the general faults of the service book, only
that is to be noted that M. Doctor still privily pyncheth or ever he be aware,
at our savior Christ's action in the first of these sections, when as he
commends rather this form of speaking, take thou, than that which our
savior Christ used in saying, take ye. And if it be a good argument to prove,
that therefore we must rather say, take thou, than take ye, because the
sacrament is an application of the benefits of Christ, then for as much as
preaching is the applying of the benefits of Christ, it behooves that the
Preacher should direct his admonitions particularly one after an other, unto
all those which hear his sermon, which is a thing absurd: and therefore
besides that it is good to leave the popish form in those things, which we
may so conveniently do, it is best to come as near the manner of celebration of
the supper which our savior Christ used, as may be.

Io. Whitgifte.
I see no difference betwixt them, but only in number, for the which I have
given some reason before, whereunto you have made no answer. The similitude of
preaching that you here use to improve my latter reason, is very unapt, for
there is great difference betwixt the means of exhibiting the benefits of
Christ by his Sacraments, and by preaching of his word. And yet there is none
doubts, Particular exhortations move more than general.
but that a man is more moved by that which is spoken to him particularly,
than he is with that which is spoken generally as well to other, as to him
self. And therefore we may commonly note that godly and zealous Preachers, even
in their general exhortations, use oftentimes the singular number, and second
person, as though they spoke to every particular man severally. Therefore, be
the commandments given in that number and person, as Thou shall have no other
Gods but me etc. And Christ does use the same manner of speech oftentimes in
his sermon. Matthew. 5. 6. and. 7. If thou bring thy gift to the alter. etc.
Agree with thine adversary quickly. etc. It is usual in all exhortations, and
it is a manner of speaking that gives every man occasion to apply that unto him
self, which is spoken. Neither do I herein pinc^e at our savior Christ's
action, as you surmise, for he spoke generally to them all, and therefore used
that form of words, which was most convenient for that purpose.

From whence soever these words were borrowed, they were well Of the words The

and puts the Communicants in mind of the effect of Christ's passion
exhibited unto them by that sacrament, and sealed with the same, if it be
worthily received.

It makes no matter from whom we receive any thing, so it be godly,
profitable, and consonant to the scriptures. But I pray you tell us what Pope

Answer to the Admonition. Page 102. Sect. 3. 4.
This is but your presumptuous and arrogant judgment, who dare take upon you
to give this general sentence, so generally upon this whole Church of
England, for you make no exception, but set us ad oppositum to them.

If you say some take it without conscience, I think you say truly, and so
did some of them, as Judas. But if you say all or the most part, you go
beyond your commission, and make your selves Judges of other men's consciences,
contrary to the rule of Christ. Mat. 7. Luke. 6. and of Paul. Romans 2. and. 14.
1. Cor. 4. and of James. 4.

T. C. Page 132. Sect. 3.
When as many receive they know not what, some other without any examination,
either of the^ selves, or by others, how they come, with what faith in Christ,
with what love toward their brethren, I see not against what rule of our
fauiour Christ it is, or what rash judgment to say, that they come rather of
custom than of conscience, when neither they speak generally of all, nor
singularly of any one particular person.

Io. Whitgifte.
Generally to charge the whole Church with that, which is but the fault of
some, and thus boldly to enter into many men's consciences, must needs be
both lack of great discretion, and also against those rules of Scripture that
I have quoted in my Answer to the Admonition.

The eleventh. They shut men by reason of their ( 1. Co. 5. 11.
) sins, from the Lords supper: we thrust them in their sin to the Lords

Answer to the Admonition. Page 102. Sect. 6. 7.
The place that you allege out of the fifte chapter of the first to the
Corinthians, which is this ( But now I have written unto you that you
company not together: if any that is called a brother be a fornicatour. etc.)
does not particularly touch the secluding of men by reason of their sins
from the Communion, but generally prohibiteth true Christians to have any
familiarity or friendship with any such notorious offendour.

If you were not with malice blinded, you might easily understand, that by
the order and rules of this Church of England, all notorious and known
offenders, even such as S. Paul here The Admonito^ gratify the Papists.
speaks of, are secluded from the Lords supper. But peradventure your
meaning is, that no man should be compelled to the Communion at any time,
wherein you greatly gratify the Papists, and show your self a good patron
of theirs. When you show any reason why men may not be compelled to come to
the Communion: then you shall be answered: In the mean time you are worthy of
your fee.

T. C. Page 132. Sect. vlt.
If the place of the. 5. to the Corinth. do forbid that we should have any
familiarity with notorious offenders, it does much more forbid that they
should be received to the Communion.

Io. Whitgifte.
I will Answer you as M. Calvin answered the Anabaptists obiecting the same

place of S. Paul. 1. Cor. 5. in effect to the same end and purpose, that the
Authors of the Admonition do, and using the like collection that you do in
this place. But whereas ( says he) Paul does forbid to eat, with those that
live dissolutely, that perteyneth to private conversation, not to the public
Communion, but some will say: if it be not lawful for a Christian man to
keep company with him that is wicked for corporal meat, much less may he
receive with them the Lords bread. I answer that it is in our power, whether
we will be familiarly conversant with the wicked, or no, and therefore every
one ought to fly from them: But it is not so in our power to receive the
Communion, or not to receive it, therefore the reason is not all one, we must
therefore note, that if the Church do tolerate and suffer an unworthy man, he
shall do well, that (knowing him to be such a one) does abstain from his
company as much as he can: so that his doing make no schism or separation
in the Church. This I speak only touching the true understanding of that
place of S. Paul to the Corinthians: and not because I would have the Church
to suffer any such notorious offenders to receive the Communion.

Chap. 2. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page 132. Sect. vlt.
And therefore Papists being such, as which are notoriously known to hold
heretical opinions, ought not to be admitted, much less compelled to the
supper. For seeing that our savior Christ, did institute his supper amongst
his Disciples, and those only which were, as S. Paul speaks within, it is
evident that the Papists being without, and foreners and strangers from the
Church of God, ought no to be received if they would offer themselves, and that
minister that shall give the supper of the Lord to him which is known to be a
Papist, and which has never made any clear renouncing of popery, with
which he has been defiled, does profane the table of the Lord, and does
give the meat that is prepared for the children, to dogs, and he brings
into the pasture, which is provided for the sheep, swyne and unclean
beasts, contrary to the faith and trust that ought to be in a steward of the
Lords house, as he is. For albeit that I doubt not, but many of those which
are now papists, perteyne to the election of God, which God also in his good
time, will call to the knowledge of his truth: yet notwithstanding they ought
to be unto the minister, and unto the Church, touching the ministering of the
sacraments, as strangers, and as unclean beasts. And as for the Papists
howsoever they receive it, whether as their popish breaden God, as some do,
or as common and ordinary bread, as other some do, or as a thing they know
not what, as some other: they do nothing else but eat and drink their own
condemnation, the weight whereof they shall one day assuredly feel, unless
they do repent them of such horrible profaning of the Lords most holy
mysteries.

Io. Whitgifte.
When our savior Christ did institute his supper, Judas was present, and
partaker thereof with the rest, as it is evident in the Evangelists: and yet
was not Judas of the Church, but without the Church, and a reprobate. You
allege S. Paul, but there is neither Epistle, nor chapter, nor any other
place quoted, which argues a guyltie conscience, and willing to use untrue
allegations, or at the least unapt.

I do not allow that Papists being notoriously known, and continuing in
their popery, should be admitted to receive the Communion, neither are they
admitted thereunto in this Church. And being such as you speak of, I think
they would not come, although they were compelled.

Chap. 2. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page. 133. Lin. 16.
And if this be to gratisie the Papists, to show that they ought not to be
compelled to receive the supper of the Lord, as long as they continue in their
Popery, I am well content to show them this pleasure, so that both they and
you forget not what I have before said, You said before, that if they be not
meet to receive the co^ munion, neither are they meet to hear the word Page
118. Sect. 1.
that the Magistrate ought to compel them to hear the word of God, and if
they profit not, nor with suffycient teaching correct not them selves, that
then they should be punyshed. And if you do ask why they should be more
compelled unto ye sermons, than unto the supper of the Lord, or why they are
not as well to be admitted unto the one as unto the other: you see ye like done
in the sacrament of baptism, which may not be ministered unto all to whom the
word may be preached.

The reason also is at hand, for the preaching of the word of God to the
Papists, is an offer of the grace of God, which may be made to those which
are strangers from God, but the ministering of the holy sacraments unto them is
a declaration and seal of Gods favor and reconciliation with them, and a
plain preaching, partly that they be washed already from their sins, partly
that they are of the household of God, and such as the Lord will feed to
eternal life, which is not lawful to be done to those, which are not of the
household of faith. And therefore I conclude, that the compelling of Papists
unto the Communion, and the dismissing and letting of them go, when as they be
to be punished, for their stubbornness in Popery (with this condition if they
will receive the Communion) is very unlawful, when as although they would
receive it, yet they ought to be kept back, until such time as by their
religious and gospellike behavior, they have purged them selves of that
suspicion of Popery, which their former life and conversation has caused to
be conceived.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is directly contrary to that which you before affirmed, page. 118. For
there Page 118. sect. 1
you say, that those which are not meet to receive the holy sacrament of the
Supper, are not meet to hear the word of God: if they be meet for the one,
they be meet for the other, and that with what lawfulness they may offer them
selves to the prayers, and to the hearing of the word of God, they may also
offer them selves to the Lords supper, and to whom so ever of them the Lord
will communicate him self by preaching the word, unto the same he will not
refuse to communicate him self by receiving of the Sacraments. These be your
words there, and now you sing another song, going about to prove, that the
Magistrate may and ought to compel those to the hearing of the word, who are
not meet to be received to the Lords supper. Surely this is great
inconstancy, but I agree with you in this place, and I Men persisting in
wickeanesse and errors are not to be compelled.
have before declared the untruth of your assertion in the other place. This
only I must let you understand, that when I speak of compelling either
Papists or other to the communion, I do not mean that they persisting in
their wickedness and errors, should be constrained to come to the Lords
supper, but that all ordinary means of persuasion being used, if they still
continue in their stubbornness, and refuse to communicate with us, such
discipline should be used toward them, as is convenient for their
wilfulness and contempt of the truth.

Your self before, page 117. said, that such as wythdrawe them selves from
the Communion, The Replye^ agrees not with the ^monition.
should both by ecclesiastical discipline, and civil punishment be brought
to communicate with their brethren, the same do I affirm also. But the
Authors of the Admonition say, that this is to drive men in their sins to
the Lords supper, and therefore page. 1^9, they would neither have Papists
nor other constrained to communicate in the mysteries of The (...) would have

salvation: meaning (as I think) that they would have no correction nor
discipline (for that is to compel) used against such as refuse to
communicate. I think in deed the especial quarrel is their own, because
they have separated them selves from the Church, and would not be constrained
to communicate with us, but they make their doctrine general, thereby to cloak
their intent. Wherefore whether they do it to gratify the Papists, or no, it
may be doubted, but certain it is that the Papists could not have had better
Proctours.

As for the fee that M. Doctor says we be worthy of (for showing our selves
(as he faith) so good patrons of the Pap^stes) he has given us well to
understand, what it should be if he were the paymaster: but as we serve the
Lord in this work, so we look for reward at his hand, not fearing but that
the Lord will in the end give such blessing unto our labors, as we shall
not need greatly to ^eare at the hands of those which God has placed in
authority, the reward which you do so often call for.

peradventure should it not be by the twenty part so sharp, as the fee that
you would bestow upon me, if it were in your power. Howbeit, I commit my
self to him, by whom hitherto I have been protected (notwithstanding all the
devises, and practices of slanderous tongues, and hateful countenances) and I
nothing doubt but that in the end God will turn all to his glory, and

This is a very slender reason to prove that the sacrament of the Supper is not
sincerely ministered, because there is singing, pyping, surplesse and Cope: when
you show your reasons against that pomp, which is now used in the
celebration of that Sacrament, you shall hear what I have to say in defense
of the same. I think that there is nothing used in the administration thereof,
that does in any respect contaminate it, or make it impure. As for pyping, it
is not prescribed to be used at the Communion by any rule, that I know.
Synging I am sure you do not disallowe, being used Singing used in all

praising of God by David. Of Surplesse and Cope I have spoken before, and will
speak more hereafter as occasionis ministered.

There is no such inventions or devises of man mixed with the Supper of the
Lord as can make it sinful, being all perteyning to edifying, and to good
and decent order, and nothing there appointed to be done contrary or not
agreeable to the Scriptures. Calvin Calvin.
him self says in his Institutions, Lib. 4. Cap. 10. That those things
which be parts of decency, commended unto us by the Apostle, though Decent
orders be Gods traditions.
they be prescribed by man, yet are they Gods traditions, and not man's, as
kneeling at solemn prayer, and such like. The Supper it self in all points
of any moment is ministered now in this Church of England, even as Christ
delivered it, as the Apostles used, and as the Primitive Church continued the
same.

These be all the reasons you use to prove that the Sacrament of the Supper is
not rightly and sincerely ministered, whereof some be impious, some ridiculous,
and all of them unworthy any confutation.

Unto that which is contained in the two next sections in the. 103. and a

that M. Doctor will not defend the pyping and Organes, nor no other synging
than is used in the re^rmed Churches, which is, in the synging of two Psalms,
one in the beginning, and an other in the ending, in a plain tune, easy both
to be song of those which have no art in singing, and understood of those,
which because they can not read, can not sing with the rest of the Church.

And as for baptism, it was enough with them, if they ( Act. 8. 35. 36. 37.
Act. 10. 47.
) had water, and the party to be baptized, faith, and the Minister to preach
the word and minister the Sacraments. Now, we must have Surplesses devised
by Pope Adrian, Interrogatories ministered to the Intant, Godfathers and
Godmothers, brought in by Higinus, holy fontes invented by Pope Pius, crossing
and such like pieces of Popery, which the Church of God in the Apostles time
never knew (and therefore not to be used) nay (which we are sure of) were and
are man's devises brought in long after the purity of the primitive Church.

Interrogatories to be ministered to the infant, be not strange,
Interrogatories ministered to infantes. Dionysius Areopag.
neither lately invented, but of great antiquity. For Dionysius Areopagita in
his book entitled De caelest. Hierar. and seventh chapter, speaking of the
baptising of infantes, and of their sureties or godfathers, and answering to
certain profane deriders (as he terms them) which said that one was
baptized for an other, because the Godfather did promise and answer for the
child, speaks thus in the name of the Godfather. Neque enim hoc ille ai^,
Ego pro puero abrenunciationes facio, aut fidei Sacramenta prositeor, sed ita
puer renunciat and profitetur, id est, spondeo puerum inducturum, cum ad sacram
intelligentiam venerit, sedulis adhortationibus meis, vt abrenuntiet contrarijs
omnino, profiteaturque, and peragat diuina quae pollicetur. Neither does he say
this, I renounce for the child, or profess the Sacraments of faith, but in
this sort the child does renounce or profess, that is to say, I promise so to
instruct the child, when he comes to the years of discretion, with daily
exhortacions, that he shall renounce all contrary things, and profess and
perform those heavenly things, which he does promise.

T. C. Page 133. Sect. vlt. and Page 134. Sect. 1.
There follows the interrogatories or demaundes ministered unto the infantes
in baptism, for the proof whereof is brought, in the first place Dionysius
Areopagita, a worthy cover for such a cup. For to let pass that M. Doctor
alleges the celestial Hierarchy in stead that he should have cited the
ecclesiastical Hierarchy, this testimony being found in the one and in the
other, dare M, Doctor be so bold as to delude the world in so great light,
with such babies as this? does he think that the Author of these books of
Hierarchies, being so full of subtle speculations, vain and idle fantasies,
wicked blasphemies, making one order of Popes, an other of Prelates, the third
of Sacrifie^s, and then of Monks, (some of which orders came not many hundred
years after that time wherein Denise the Areopagite lived) which mentions
many foolish ceremonies and corruptions, (that no other Author neither Greek
nor Latin stories, nor other diverse hundredth years after does make mention of
besides him) I say does he think to abuse men, and to give them such dross
in stead of Silver, such chafe in stead of corn, as to make us believe,
that he that wrote these books of Hierarchy, was S. Paul's scholar? for the
better blasing of this Denis arms, I will send the reader unto that which
Erasmus writes of this Denis of M. Doctors, upon the. 17. of the Aetes of the
Apostles, where he also shows together with his own judgment, the judgment
of Laurentius Ualla. I am not ignorant what Nicephorus a fabulous
Historiographer and of no credit in such matters (in those matters especially
which might like or mislyke those times wherein he wrote) says of S. Paul's
communicating with Denis, and 2. Lib. 20. cap.
an other concerning the heavenly and ecclesiastical hierarchy. But because I
think M. Doctor be now ashamed of his Deuis, I will follow it no further.

By this it may appear that M. Doctors Dionysius, being a counterfeit and start
up, these Interrogatories and demaundes ministered unto infantes have not so
many graye hears, as he would make us believe, although in deed the question
lies not in the antiquity. As for reasons he has none, but only as one which
has learned his aequipollences very evil, he makes it all one to say (I
renounce) and to say (I will teach another to renounce.)

Io. Whitgifte.
I know there is contrary opinions of learned men touching the authority, and
Author of these books. And yet it cannot be denied, but that they be very
ancient, neither is it any shame for me to allege his authority, seeing the

prove reading of Defense of the Apolog. Part. 5.
the Scriptures in the Church, with as great credit as I do. Howbeit, I will
not take upon me the defense of them, neither do I doubt, but that something
may be thrust in unto them, but of all other things this is the least to be
suspected, that I have in this place alleged. Neither am I any more ashamed of
him, than you are of so often alleging the Canons of the Apostles, Hyginus,
etc. the which authorities are as much doubted of as the books of Dionysius.
His reason is to be considered, agreing fully with the true meaning of this
Church of England, but you wipe it away with a floute, as your manner is,
when you are driven to a pinche.

Augustine. The Answer to the same.
he is brought to baptism, and the question is asked of those that offer him
to be baptized, whither the infant believe or no, they answer that he does
believe, says on this sort: Nisi sacramenta quandam haberent similitudinem,
etc. Except Sacraments had a certain similitude, and likeness of those
things whereof they be Sacraments, they were no Sacraments at all, and by
reason of this same similitude oftentimes they are called by the names of the
things themselves, therefore as after a crtayne manner of speaking, the
Sacrament of the body of Christ is the body of Christ, the Sacrament of the
blood of Christ is the blood of Christ, so the Sacrament of the faith is
faith, neither is it anything else to believe, than to have faith: and therefore
when answer is made, that the infant does believe, not having as yet faith
in deed, it is ansvvered that he does believe for the Sacrament of faith, and
that he does convert himself unto God for the Sacrament of conversion, because
the answer it self does perteyne to the celebration of the Sacrament. And a
little after he says: Itaque paruulum, etsi nondum fides illa quae in
credentium voluntate consistit, iam tamen ipsius fidei Sacramentum, fidelem
facit. Nam sicut credere respondetur, ita etiam fidelis vocatur, non rem ipsa
mente annuendo, sed ipsius rei Sacramentum percipiendo. Therefore although that
faith which consists in the will of the believers, does not make the
ehylde faithful, yet does the Sacrament of that faith make him faithful: for
even as it is ansvvered that he does believe, so is he also called faithful,
not by signifying the thing it self in his mind, but by receiving the
Sacrament of the thing.

By these two authorities it is manifest that Interrogatories were ministered to
infantes, at the time of their Baptism, and that they had sureties, which we
call godfathers, that answered for them and in their name.

T. C. Page 134. Sect. 1.
As for S. Augustines place (although I can ^.
not allow his reason that he makes, nor the proportion that is between the
sacrament of the body and blood of our Savior Christ, and his body and
blood it self of one side, and between the sacrament of Baptism and faith of
the other side: saying that as the sacrament of the body of Christ, after a
sort is the body: so the baptism of the sacrament of faith, is after a sort
faith, ^.
whereas he should have said, that as the supper being the sacrament of the
body of Christ, is after a sorre the body of Christ, so baptism being a
sacrament of the blood of Christ, is after a sort the blood of Christ. For
faith is not the subject of Baptism, as the body and blood of Christ is the
matter of the supper.) Yet I say that S. Augustine has no one word to approve
this abuse of answering in the childs name, and in his person, but goes about
to establishe, an other abuse, which was, that it was lawful for those that
presented the child, to say, that it believed, so that it is like, that the
minister did ask those which presented the infant, whither they thought that
it was faithful, and did believe, and those which presented it, said it was
so: whereupon this question rose, whither it was lawful to say, that the
child believed.

Io. Whitgifte.
I never heard that any learned man as yet mislyked this place of Augustine,
but I know they have used it as a most manifest testimony, against
Transubstantiation, and the Real presence, and as a true declaration wherefore
the sacramental bread and wine be called the body and blood of Christ,
being but the sacraments of the body and blood of Christ. And now you with
unwashed hands not understanding the place, presume to give a blind and
unlearned censure, upon so worthy and learned a Father, even there where he
speaks most soundly and learnedly: But how should your arrogancy else
appear? The supper is a sacrament both of the body and blood of Christ, the
bread of the body and the ^. Romans 4.
wine of the blood, as S. Augustine there says: and Baptism is truly called
by him the Sacrament of faith, because it is Signaculum iustitiae fidei, as
Circumcision the figure of Baptism was, according to the word of the Apostle
ad Romans 4. and therefore in reproving S. Augustine, for calling it the
Sacrament of faith, you seem to be ignorant of this place of the Apostle. To
this saying of Augustine, does that of Tertullian in his book De Poenitentia
very well agree, where he speaking of Baptism Tertull.

faith, neither did ever any man before you mislike this kind and phrase of
speech, that baptism is the sacrament of faith.

S. Augustines words be evident, that there were questions in Baptism moved
in the name of the infant, which could not be, unless there were also
answering to the same.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
Admonition.
Thyrdely, they profane holy Baptism, in toying foolishely, for that they
ask questions of an infant, which can not answer, and speak unto them, as
was wont to be spoken unto men, and unto such as being converted, answered for
themselves, and were Baptized. Which is but a mockery ( Gal, 6. 7.
) of God, and therefore against the holy Scriptures.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 192. Sect. 1. 2.
To the third superstitious toy (as you call it) that is, the questions
demanded of the Infant, at the time of Baptism, I have also answered
Augustine allows questions to the infant.
out of S. Augustine, in the first part: where it may also appear, that this
manner of questionyng was used in the Baptising of Infantes long before
Augustines time, for Dionysius Areopagita makes mention of them in like manner.

To prove that this questioning with the infant is a mocking of God, you quote
Galat. 6. verse. 7. Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man
sows that shall he reap. Paul in this place takes away excuses, which
worldlinges use to make for not nourishing their pastors, for no feyned excuse
will serve because God is not mocked: But what is this to the questionyng with
infantes? how follows this? God is not mocked, Ergo, he that questioneth
with Infantes mocketh God. Truly you mock God when you so dally with his
Scriptures, and seek rather the glory of quoting of many places of Scripture,
than the true applying of any one.

T. C. Page 134. Sect. 2.
In the. 191. and. 192. pages he speaks of this again, but he both nothing
else, but repeat, in both places that which is here, only he says that it
is a mockyng of God to use the place of the Galatians, (God is not mocked)
against this abuse, and his reason is, because S. Paul speaks there against
those, that by feyned excuses seek to defraude the Pastor of his living, as
who should say S. Paul did not conclude that particular conclusion, thou
shalt not by frivolous excuses defraude the minister, with this general
saying (God is not mocked) for his reason is, God is not mocked at all or in
any matter, therefore he is not mocked in this, or as who should say, because
our Savior Christ saying that it is not lawful to separate that which God
has joined speaking of divorce, it is not lawful to use this sentence, being
a general rule, in other things, when as we know it is as well and properly
used against the Papists, which severe the cup from the bread, as against the
Jews, which put away their wives for every small and triflyng cause.

Io. Whitgifte.
In deed it is a very mocking of God thus to abuse the Scriptures, for the
Authors of the Admonition allege this text to prove, that to question with
Infantes is to mock God, when there is not one word in that place spoken of
questioning with infantes, and therefore this text is alleged without
purpose, except you will say that it is quoted only for the Phrase and manner
of speaking. It is true that God is not mocked, but this proves not that
questioning in Baptism is to mock God, and therefore vaynely it is applied.
Those which sever the cup from the bread, in the Lords Supper do separate
that which God has coupled, and therefore that text may well be alleged
against them, but such as question in Baptism, in the name of those that are
to be baptized do not mock God, and therefore that text is in the Admonition
altogether abused.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.
T. C. Page 134. Sect. vlt.
And as for this questioning it can be little better termed, than a very
triflying and ioying, for first of all children have not nor cannot have any
faith, having no understanding of the word of God. I will not deny but
children have the spirit of God, which works in them after a wonderful
fashion. But I deny that they can have faith which comes by hearing, and
understanding, which is not in them.

Secondarily, if children could have faith, yet they that present the child,
can not precisely tell whether that particular child has faith or no, and
therefore can not so absolutely answer that it believes: Because it is
comprehended in the covenant, and is the child of faithful parents, or at
least of one of the Parents, there is warrant unto the presenters to offer it
unto Baptism, and to the minister for to baptize it. And further we have to
think charitably and to hope, that it is one of the Church. But it can be no
more precisely said, that it has faith, than it may be said precisely
elected, An vntru^.
(for in deed it is all one to say, that it is elect, and to say that it
believes) and this I think the Authors of the Admonition do mean, when they
say, that they require a promise of the godfathers, which is not in them to
perform.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have told you before out of Dionysius and Augustine, in what sense the
answer is made in the name of the infant, and therefore this is no reason: for
though the infant have not faith that comes by hearing and understanding the
word of God, yet may the Godfathers promise, that they will endeavor so much
as lies in them, that the infant may be instructed in that faith, that they
have professed in his name. Likewise as Augustine says, It may be said to
believe, propter Sacramentum fidei, For the Sacrament of faith.

Your second reason is all one with the former reason, and therefore one
answer Not al one to say it believes, and it is elected. Act. 8.
does serve them both: saving that you here add a manifest untruth, for it
is not all one to say, that it is elect, and to say it believes: for the
Scripture Actor. 8. says that Simon Magus believed, yet was he not elected.

Chap. 1. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 135. Lin. 7.
Thirdly, if both those things were true, that is that infantes had faith, and
that it might be precisely said that it believes, yet ought not the minister
demand this of the child, whom he knows cannot answer him, nor those
that answer for the child, ought to demand to be baptized, when they
neither mean, nor may be, (being already baptized,) but it is meet, that all
things should be done gravely, simply and plainly in the Church. And so (if
those other two things were lawful) it ought to be done, as seems to have
been done in S. Augustines times, when the minister asked those that presented
the infant, and not the infant, whither it were faithful, and those which
presented answered in their own persons, and not in the childs, that it was
faithful.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be mere cauilles and unworthy the name of reasons. Those that shall
read the book of Common prayer touching that matter, may easily perceive that
this reason might well have been blotted out of your book. For the minister
speaking to those that answer for the child says thus: Wherefore after
this promise made by Christ, these infantes must also faithfully for their
part, promise by you that be their sureties, that they will forsake the Devil
and al his works, and constantly believe Gods holy word, and obediently keep
his commandments: whereby you may understand, what is meant both by those
questions, and answers. But what will not malice quarrel with? and what is
there so good and profitable, that may not be (by contentious persons) drawn
into question? the question is asked in the name of the child, the Godfathers
answer in their own persons, signifying thereby that they will labor and
endeavor so much as in them lies, to bring that to pass in the child, which
they have promised for it, and in the name of it.

And why is it not as lawful for such questions to be asked in the name of
the child, as it is for the child to make a rehearsal of his faith, and to
desire to be baptized in the same, by the mouth of the Parent, or some other in
the Parents name, as the Admonition affirms fol. 109. in these words? That
the parties to be Baptized, if they be of the years of discretion, by
themselves and in their own persons, or if they be infantes by their parents,
(in whose room if upon necessary occasion they be absent, some one of the
congregation knowing the good behavior and sound faith of the Parents) may
both make rehearsal of their faith, and also if their faith be sound, and
agreeable to the holy Scriptures, desire to be in the same Baptized. Is it not
as much for the infant to profess his faith (which you say he has not) by
his Parents and by him also, to desire to be Baptized, as it is for the
Godfather to answer interrogatories ministered unto him, in the name of the
Child?

make that promise, which I think they perform sufficiently, if they
pretermit nothing that lies in them to the perfourmance thereof: and so says
Dionysius, for such promises are not made absolutely, but Quantum in nobis est.
So much as lies in us.

To prove that it is not in the Godfathers to perform that which they
promise, you quote the saying of S. Paul to the Romans cap. 7. verse. 15. I
allow not that which I do, for what I vvoulde that I do not, but what I
hate, that I do. And verse. 18. For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh,
dwells no good thing, for to will is present with me, but I find no
means. etc. And verse. 21. I find then by the law, that when I vvoulde do
good, evil is present with me. In all these places Infirmities be in all men.
the Apostle declares, that infirmities remain even in the faithful by
reason of the flesh, and that they can not come to such perfection in this
life, as they do desire. But how do these places prove, that Godfathers are
not able to perform that which they promise for the infant? Truly these
proofs are to far fetched for my understanding. In the ninth to the
Romans, the Apostle says, That it is not in him that wills, nor in him
that runs, but in God that shows mercy. In the which words he shows,
that the cause of our election is not in our selves, but in the mercy of God.
But what is this to the promise of Godfathers made at the baptising of
Infantes? If you would have a man to promise nothing but that which is in his
power to perform, then must you simply condemn all promises made by man,
for there is nothing in his power to perform, no not moving of his foot, not
coming to dinner or supper. etc. Therefore as all other promises be made
Conditional promises.
with these secret conditions, if God will, so much as lies in me, to the
vttermoste of my power, if I live. etc. So is the promise in baptism made, by
the Godfathers likewise.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is nothing answered to this.

Chap. 2. the. 2. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 107. Sect. 2. and Page 193. Sect. 1.
It is also manifest by these authorities, that Godfathers or suretyes were
required at the baptising of Infantes: which Tertullian also signifies in his
book de Baptismo. But you your self Of Godfathers.
confess Godfathers to be of great antiqnitie in the Church of Christ, for
you say that Higinus brought them in, and Higinus was the ninth Bishop of Rome,
and lived. Anno. 141,

Touching the last, which you Rhetorically say, you will speak nothing of,
that is, the evil choice of witnesses; I think in part it is true, but you
speak that without the book, and therefore without my compass of defense:
For I mean not to take upon me the defense of any abuse within the book (if
there be any) much less without the book.

T. C. Page 135. Sect. 1.
For Godfathers there is no controversy between the Admonition, and master
Doctors book, which appears not only in their corrections, but plainly in
the. 188. page, where they declare that they rather condemn the abuse, whilst
it is urged more than greater matters, and which are in deed necessary, this
being a thing arbitrarie, and left to the discretion of the Church, Godfathers
allowed by T. C.
and whylest there is so evil choice for the most part of Godfathers, which is
expressedly mentioned of the Admonition, and whilst it is used almost for
nothing else but as a mean for one friend to gratify an other, without
having any regard to the solemn promise made before God and the congregation,
of seeing the child brought up in the nurture and fear of the Lord. For the
thing it self, considering that it is so generally received of all the
Churches, they do not mislike of it.

Io. Whitgifte.
Peradventure they are better advised now than they were when they wrote the
Admonition. But it is good for the Reader to note that you make Godfathers a
thing arbitrarie, and left to the discretion of the Church: and yet was it
invented Godfathers allowed though brought in by Pope Higinus.
(as the Authors of the Admonition say) by Pope Higinus. So that some thing
belike of the Popes inventions may remain in the Church, though the same be
not expressed in the word of God. Indeed this is the liberty that you
challenge, to allow what you list, and disallowe at your pleasure: all is
perfect that you confirm of whom soever it was borrowed. And why may not I
say the same for interrogatories ministered to the Infant? You add this reason
in the end (Considering it is so generally received of all Churches) and yet

Answer to the Admonition. Page 107. Sect. vlt.
You may as well find fault with Pulpit and Church, as with Of fontes. The
Apostles baptized not in Basins.
the fontes, and the reason is all one. In the time of the Apostles they did
not baptize in Basins, as you do now, but in Rivers and other common waters,
neither was there in the Apostles time any Churches for Christians, or Pulpits
to preach in, and therefore you had best to pluck down Churches, and
Pulpits, and to baptize in common rivers and waters.

T. C. Page 135. Sect. 2.
As for Fontes I have spoken of before, both particularly, and in general. But
whereas M. Doctor says, in the Ipostles times they baptized in no Basins but
in ryuers, and common waters, I would know whether there was a river or common
water in Cornelius, and in the Iaylers houses, where Paul and Peter baptized.

Io. Whitgifte.
And I would also gladly learn, how you can prove that they did baptize in
Basins there: I do not say that they always baptized in Rivers and common
waters, but that they did so and that most commonly, which no man can deny.
But I require one syllable in Scripture to prove that they did baptize in
Basins, not that I The replyer put to the proof of his ceremonies.

perform, that in your Ceremonies, which you require in ours, that is, to prove
them directly by the word of God.

Touching crossing in baptism, I will only recite unto you the Of crossing in

opinion of M. Bucer, which is this. Signam hoc non tam quod est vsus in
Ecclesijs antiquissimi, quam quod est admodum simplex, and presentis
admonitionis crucis Christi, adbiberi, nec indecens, nec inutile existimo: si
adhibeatur modo pure intellectum, and religiose excipiatur, nulla nec
superstitione adiuncta, nec elements seruitute, nec lenitate, aut vulgari
consuetudine. I think it neither uncomely nor unprofitable to use the sign of
the Cross, not only because the use thereof is very ancient, but also because
it has an express signification of the passion of Christ: so that it be
purely understood and religiously received without any superstition or
servitude of the element, or leuitie, or common custom.

T. C. Page 135. Sect. 3.
To prove crossing in Baptism, M. Bucers authority is brought. I have said
before what injury it is to leave the public works of Bucer, and to fly
unto the Apochryphas, wherein also they might drive us to use the like, and to
set down likewise his words which we find in his private letters. But it is
first of all to be observed of the reader, how and with what name those notes
are called, which are cyted of M. Doctor for the defense of these corruptions:
they are called by M. Doctors own confession (Censures) which word signifies
and implies, as much as corrections and controlments of the book of service,
and therefore we may take this for a general rule throughout the whole book
of Service, that in whatsoever things in controversy M. Doctor does not bring
Bucers authority, to confirm them that those things Bucer mislyked of, as for
example in private Baptism, and Communions ministerd in houses, for
interrogatories ministered to Infants, and such like, for so much as they are
not confirmed here by M. Bucers judgment, it may be thought that he mislyked
of them, and no doubt, if either M. Bucers notes had not either condemned or
misliked of diverse things in the Service book, we should have had the notes
printed and set forth to the full. This I thought in a word to admonish the
reader of.

Io. Whitgifte.
To your first cavil, I have answered before, where you made the same. To your
second of master Bucers Censures (though the book be not so entitled) the M.
Bucers Censures upon the first book in king Edwardes time.
answer is short and plain, it was his judgment upon the first Communion
book, in the time of king Edward wherein he misliked some things: but
allows both private Baptism, and the Communion ministered to the sick, as I
before declared, and you might have remembered, if your memory had not failed
you.

Chap. 3. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 135. Sect. 4.
Unto M. Bucers authority I could here oppose men of as great authority, yea
the authority of all the reformed Churches, which shall also be done
afterward. And if there were nothing to oppose but the word of God, which
will have the Sacraments ministered simply, and in that sincerity that they be
left unto us, it is enough to make all men to cover their faces, and to be
ashamed, if that which thy shall speak be not agreeable to that simplicity.

The reasons which M. Bucer brings I will answer, which in this matter of
crossing are two: first that it is ancient, and so it is in deed: For
Tertullian makes mention of this usage. Li. de resurrect. carnis.
And if this be sufficient to prove the goodness of it, then there is no
cause, why we should mislyke of the other superstitions and corruptions which
were likewise used in those times. For the same Li. de corona militis.
Tertullian shows that they used also at baptism to taste of milk, and
honey, and not to wash all the week after they had ministered baptism.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words without proof, Crossing in that manner and form, that we
use it, very well agrees with the simplicity of the word of God. If it do
not so, show any word against it.

Your answer to that reason is very base, for it is not only ancient, but it
has continued, and been generally received: which you allowed before as a
sufficient reason for Godfathers. As for milk and honey, the use of them was
neither continued long, nor yet general: and therefore the reason of them, and
of the other is not like.

Chap. 3. the. 4. Division.
T. C. Page 135 Sect. vlt.
But here I will note the cause, whereupon I suppose, this use of crossing
came up in the Primitive Church, whereby shall appear, how there is no cause
now why it it should be retained, if there were any why it should be used in
the Primitive Church. It is known to all that have read the Ecclesiastical
stories, that the Heathen did object to the Christians in times past in
reproach, that the God which they believed of was hanged upon a Cross. And
they thought good to testify that they were not ashamed therefore of the same
God, by the often using of the sign of the Cross, which carfulness and good
mind to keep amongst them an open profession of Christ crucified, although
it be to be commended: yet is not this means so: for they might otherwise have
kept it, and with less danger, than by this use of crossing, and if they
thought the use of the Cross to be the best means, yet they should not have
been so bold, as to have brought it into the holy Sacrament of Baptism, and
so mingle the ceremonies and inventions of men, with the Sacraments and
institution of God. And as it was brought in upon no good ground, so the Lord
left a mark of his curse of it, and whereby it might be perceived to come out
of the forge of man's brain, in that it began forthwith, while it was yet in
the swaddling cloutes to be superstitiously abused. For it appears by
Tertullian also in the same book de Corona militis, that the Christians had
such a superstition in it, that they would do nothing, nor take nothing in
hand, unless they had crossed them, when they went out, when they came in,
when they sat or lay down, and when they rose, and as Superstition is always
strengthened, and spreddeth it self with the time, so it came from crossing of
men unto crossing of every thing that they used. Whereupon Chrysostom
commends the crossing of the Cup before a man drink, Upon the 1. Tim. 4.
cap.
and of the meat before it was eaten. But if it were granted that upon this
consideration which I have before mentioned, the ancient Christians did well,
yet it follows not, that we should so do: for we live not amongst those
Nations which do cast us in the teeth or reproach us with the Cross of
Christ. If we lived amongst the Turks it were an other matter, and then there
might peradventure some question be, whether we should do as they did, and
having the same sore, use the same plaster. But now we live among the
Papists, that do not contemn the cross of Christ, but which esteem more of
the wooden cross, than of the true cross of Christ, (which is his
sufferings,) we ought now to do clean contrariewise to the old Chrystians,
and abolishe all use of these crosses, for contrary diseases, must have
contrary remedies: if therefore the old Christians to deliver the cross of
Christ from contempt, did often use the cross, the Christians now to take
away the superstitious estimation of it, ought to take away the use of it.

Io. Whitgifte.
I think your supposition in part to be true: I am also persuaded that the
original cause of using this sign was lawful and good, and yet the thing if
self afterward abused, and the cause of using is clean altered, and wholly
converted to superstition: but the abuse being taken away, I see no cause why
it may not be used in Baptism, in that manner and form, as it is in this
Church of England, that is, In token that hereafter he shall not be ashamed
to confess the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under his
banner, against sin, the world, and the devil, and to continue Christ's
faithful Soldier and servant unto his lives end. And though there be no
Turks among us or Jews, yet is it lawful to use such Christian ceremonies
to put us in mind of our duty. And notwithstanding the same might be done by
other means, yet it has pleased the Church to think this means also
convenient, and therefore has used her liberty therein. As for Papists,

we are far enough off from them, for they pictured the sign of the cross
and did worship it, so do not we: they used it to drive away spirits and
devils, so do not we: they attributed power and virtue unto it, so do not we:
they had it in their Churches, so have not we: they used it daily and nightly
for religion sake, we only in Baptism for a sign and token, as I have said
before: so that their abusing of it is sufficiently corrected. Neither is there
any man that knows not to what end and purpose we use it.

Concerning the other reason of the profitable signification of the Cross, I
have showed that that makes the thing a great deal worse, and brings in a
new word into the Church, whereas there ought to be no Doctor heard in the
Church but only our Savior Christ. For (...) ^ese significations be good,
then the Papists have to answer us, that their Ceremonies be ^ot dumb,
which have as likely and as glorious significations as these are, and so
indeed they ^ay that their ceremonies are not dumb ceremonies, for so much as

being used in the Church without any declaration of such signification, and
therefore they might worthily be counted dumb, and unprofitable, but it is not
so in this, for the signification is joined with the sign, and published in a
tongue known. The Papisticall Ceremonies were in number many, and they had
annexed unto them an opinion of worship, and a necessity unto salvation. etc.
which made them wicked, but all these be far from this, and other Ceremonies
used by us, and for as much as there is no word of God against it, and it has
a profitable signification, the Church may use it though it be not expressed in

Answer to the Admonition. Page 192. Sect. 3.
Concerning the fourth toy, that is Crossing the child in the forehead, which
you call wicked and superstitious, I have before declared Master Bucers
opinion: It may be left, and it has been used in the Primitive Church, and
may be so still, without either superstition or wickedness. Neither does it
any more make a Sacrament (because Crossing (...) Sacra^.

law. etc. I think you know that every Ceremony betokening something, is
not by and by a Sacrament, and therefore here is as yet no wicked divorce of
the word and Sacraments, except it be made by you.

T. C. Page 134. Sect. vlt.
In the. 192. page, unto the Admonition obiectiing that by this significafion
it is made a Sacrament. M. Doctor answers that euerte ceremony which
betokens something is not a Sacrament. I would know what makes a
Sacrament, if a doctrine annexed unto an outward sign does not make a
Sacrament. And I am sure there was no outward sign neither in the old
Testament, nor i^ the new which has a doctrine ^oyned with it, which is not a
Sacrament. For if he will take the nature of the Sacrament so straightly as
Augustine does, and that there be no Sacraments but when as to the element,
there comes the word, A monifest (...),
the Circu^eision can be no sacrament: besides that, seeing that master Doctor
has condemned the allegory and signifycation of sytting at the Lords supper,
saying that it is Papistieall, I marvel what privilege he has or special
license, that he may allow that in him self and in his own assertions, which
he says is unlawful and papisticall in others, especially seeing the
allegory of the sytting was never used by the Papists, but this of crossing
is. And if the license of allegories be allowed, I see not why Oil may not be
brought into the Sacrament, as well as crossing, both because it has beone a
Sacrament of God before, and for that the signifycation thereof (betokening the
gifts of the holy Ghost, and shadowing out the power and efficacy of those
gifts) caryeth as great a show of wisdom and Christian instruction, as does
the crossing.

Io. Whitgifte.
You are not ignorant, I am sure, that to the making of a Sacrament, besides
What is required to the making of a sacrament.
the external element, there is required a commandment of God in his word,
that it should be done, and a promise annexed unto it, where of the Sacrament
is a seal: so it was in circumcision, and so it is in the Supper and Baptism.
And surely I marvel at this your saying, If we will take the nature of the
sacrament straightly Circumcision a Sacrament according to Augustines rule.
as Augustine does, and that there be no sacraments, but where as to the
element, there comes the word, the Circumcision can be no sacrament. I
think you are not well advised, for what does Saint Augustine require in a
Sacrament? Does he not requir^ the word, and an external element? And are not
both these to be found in circumcision? The external element is the
foreskinne: it is commanded in Genesis. 17. And there is the promise annexed,
whereof it is a seal and a Sacrament: Genesis 17.
and what does Saint Augustine require more in a Sacrament? But I will impute
this saying of yours rather to some oversight or lack of due consideration,
than to ignorance, for I think it impossible that a man of your profession
should be ignorant in the nature and definition of a Sacrament. A Sacrament, I
mean not in the largest signification, but as it is properly used, and as we
call the Lords Supper and Baptism Sacraments. For Sacraments in the proper
signification, be mystical signs ordained by God himself, consisting in the
word of The proper signification of sacraments
God, in figures and in things signified, whereby he keeps in man's memory,
and sometimes renueth his large benefits bestowed upon his Church, whereby
also he seals or assures his promises, and shows outwardly, and as it were
lays before our eyes those things to behold which inwardly he works in
us: yea by them he strengthens and increases our faith, by the holy Ghost
working in our hearts. And to be short, by his Sacraments he separateth us
from all other people, from all other religions, consecrating us and binding us
to him only, and signifies what he requires of us to be done. Now every
ceremony signifying any thing, has not these conditions and propertyes, Every
signifying ceremony is not a ^acrament.
Wherefore every ceremony signifying any thing, is not a Sacrament, and
therefore crossing in Baptism though it signifies some thing, yet it is no
Sacrament.

The allegory of sitting is dombe and speaks nothing: but to the sign of the
cross is added the signification in express words, as I have before
declared, wherefore there is more cause to condemn the one, than there is to
condemn the other: More^uer sitting at the Lords supper has not been used in
the Church that I can read of, but crossing in baptising has, wherefore that
were to invent a new Ceremony, and this is to reteyne the old, so that the
reason of their allegory and of this Ceremony is not like.

Of refusing ^yle in baptism, the Church has just cause: and it uses her
liberty in reteyning crossing: neither will it burden the Sacraments with a
multitude of unnecessary and unprofitable Ceremonies, and yet reteyne such as
shall be thought most convenient.

Chap. 3. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page 137. Lin. 3.
And to conclude, I see no cause why some crosses should be unlawful, and
other some commendable: and why it should be a monument of Popery in wood and
metal, and yet a Christian badge in the forehead of a man, why we should not
like of it in streates and hyghewayes, and yet allow of it in the church.

Io. Whitgifte.
As there is great difference betwixt the paynting of an Image, to set forth
an history, and placing of it in the Church to be worshipped, so is there
also as great difference, or more, betwixt crossing a child in the forehead at
the time of baptism, with expressing the cause and use of it, and the placing
of crosses in Churches or highways and streates.

The crossing of the childs forehead, is but for a moment, the cross of wood
and stone remains and continues: the cross in the childs forehead is not
made to be adored and worshipped, neither was ever any man so mad, as to
imagine any such thing of it: but the crosses in churches, streates, and
highwayes, of metal and wood, were erected to be worshipped, and were so
accordingly, and therefore there is no like peril in the one, as there is in
the other.

And because I would have all those things together that touch this matter of
baptisine, I come to that which he has in the next Section and in. III. page,
where after his old manner, he^ wrangleth and quarrelleth. For although the
Admonition speaks so plainly and so clearly, that as Hesiod. says, it
might (...) satisfy Momus, yet M. Doctor goes about there, to bring it in
suspicion of Anabaptisme, because allowing in plain words the baptism of
infantes, they add that if the parties be of discretion and years, them
selves in their own persons, should demand to be baptized. For says he in
this Church they tarry not for baptism so long: But is there no cause or may
there not be, when they that be of age may be baptized? It may be there are
Jews in England, which understanding their blyndnes and confessing their
sin, may desire to be baptized, and ^here be diverse Mores in noble men's and
gentlemen's houses, which are sometimes brought to the knowledge of Christ,
whereby th^re is some use and practice of this case.

those that walk in steps so like unto it. And yet I speak nothing in that
place, that may bring the A^thours of the Admonition into suspicion of
Anabaptisme, unless they suspect them selves, or that you would have them
suspected: for you know the old proverb. Conscius ipse sibi. etc. It may be
in deed that there be Jews in England, and Mores, and Turks (...) and that
some of them being converted to the faith, be afterward^ baptized, and (...) it
is so, but the case is very rare, and there is no man that doubts but (...)
to be examined in their faith before they be admitted to baptism. This is

answer me this one question: If a child be found whose father and mother be
unknown (as it has happened sometimes in our remembrance) will you not
baptize it because the Parents be not forth coming, to make a confession of
their faith? or because the sound faith of the Parents is unknown? but
hereof I have spoken in another place.

does make of the holy Sacrament of baptism (which is an entri^ into the house
of God) and whereby only the family of God must enter, a common passage
whereby he will have clean and unclean, holy and profane, as well those that
are without the couenan^e, as those that be within it, to pass by: and so
makes the church no household, but an Inn to receive whosoever comes.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is but a declaration of your modesty, and a signification of the
mildness of your spirit, and therefore I will pass it over and leave it to
the Reader to be considered of. Only I must tell you, that I make the holy
Sacrament of baptism no other kind of passage, than God him self has made
it, and the Church of Christ has ever used it. Good and evil, clean and
unclean, holy and profane, must needs pass by it, except you will in deed
in more ample and large manner tie the grace of God unto it, than ever did the
Papists, and say that all that be baptized be also saved: or else join with
the Anabaptists in this, that after baptism a man cannot sin.

Who can tell whither he be holy or unholy, good or evil, clean or unclean,
elect or reprobate, of the household of the Church, or not of the Church,
that is baptized, be he infant, or at the years of discretion? I tell you
plain this assertion of yours sauoureth very strongly of heresy in my opinion:
but let us come to your reasons if you have any.

Chap. 4. the. 3. Division.

I will answer therefore almost in as many words as the questions be asked.
If one of the Parents be neither drunkarde nor adulterer, the child is holy
by virtue of the couenante, for one of the Parents sakes. If they be both, and
yet not obstinate in their sin, whereby the Church has not proceeded to
excommunication, (them selves being yet of the Church) their child cannot,
nor ought not to be refused. To the second question, wherein he asks what if
the child be of Papists or heretykes. If both be Papists or condemned
heretics (if so be I may distinguishe Papists from heretics) and cut of from
the church, their children cannot be received, because they are not in the
coucnant, if either of them be faithful, I have answered before that it ought
to be received.

To other questions wherein he asks, what if they err in some points of
matters of faith. If it be but an error, and be not in those points which raze
the foundations of faith, because they still, notwithstanding their error are
to be counted amongst the faithful, their children pertcyne unto the promise,
and therefore to the sacrament of the promise.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely these be very short answers for so weighty questions, and so necessary

points of doctrine: will you presume thus to determine in matters of
salvation and danmation, the doctrine being so strange and unheard of, without
either scripture, reason, or other authority? are we now come to ( ipse
dixit)? nay it may not be so, you have no such authority or credit ye I know.
But let us a little better consider your assertions, and mark your drifte,
Page. 34. you say that there are no whoremongers, nor Page 34. Sect. 1
drunkardes in the church that are knowem, because the church does
excommunicate them, whereby you seem to run headlong into this heresye of the
Anabaptists, that, that is not the Church of Christ, in the which are
known drunkardes and whoremongers, and no excommunication used against them.
The which heresye is well and learnedlye Calvin. Bullinger.
confuted by M. Calvin in his book against the Anabap. and by M. Bullinger
likewise, Lib. 6. cap. 10. aduersus Anabap.

Moreover this your assertion seems to bring in rebaptisation. For if
whoremongers, The assertion of the Replier tends to rebaptisation.
drunkardes, and such like wicked persons by excommunication be so cut of from
the Church, that their children may not be baptized, then must it follow that
their baptism is cut of also: which if it be true, how can they upon
repentance be admitted again except they be rebaptised? and what is this else
but to make baptism, to be iterated as the Lord* supper is, when as by the
consent of all the Churches, Baptism once ministered remains per petuall.
there is but one baptism, wherewith it is sufficient once to be Christened,
seeing that baptism once received does endure for ever, as a perpetual sign
of our adoption. And how can you allow the baptism of heretics to be good,
if you disallowe the baptising of their children that be excommunicated? may an
heretic excommunicated baptize, and is that baptism good, and may not the
children of him that is excommunicated receive the sacrament of baptism? can
any fault of the parents, having once received the scale of the covenant,
seclude their children from rcceyuing the same seal? you have neither example
nor precept in scripture to justify your assertion with: it is against the
nature of the sacrament, the practice of the Church, and the whole consent of
learned writers (some few excepted which erred in rebaptisation) and yet you
boldly here set it down, without any further proof at all.

S. Augustine in his book Contraepist. Parme. reasons wholly to the contrary,
for there he proves that heretics which cut of them selves from the Church,
do neither Heretics loose not their baptism.
amittere baptismum, nor ius dandi baptismum, that is, neither leese their
baptism, nor authority to baptize: and thereupon concludes against
rebaptisation, which must needs follow if either of the other be taken away.
The Donatistes them selves were at the length compelled to confess, that
heretics divided from the church, did not amitte^e bapt^smum, leese their
baptism. And in the same book August. has this general sentence, That the
fault of such heretics, is in cutting of them selves from the church, which
may be corrected by returning again to the church, non in sacramentis quae
vbicunque sunt, ipsa vera sunt, not in the sacraments, which wheresoever they
are, are true. This being so (as it is) then are you very nere to Donatisme,
nay far beyond it, in The Replier nere to Donatis^e.
saying that the children of the heretykes, and such as by excommunication are
cut of from the Church, may not be baptized. Surely if the Parents being
heretics and cut of from the Church, do notwithstanding Retinere baptismum,
keep still their baptism, (as Saint Augustine says) I see not how by any
means you can justify the secluding of their children from being baptized: or
if otherwise I can not see how a Papiste being converted, can be received
into the Church, without he be anewe baptized, or how such children of
known Papists, and excommunicate persons, as have been baptized in this
Church of England or else ^ here, from the beginning of the Gospel to this
day, can be coumpted Christians, unless they be rebaptised.

And concerning Papists, whom you have denied to be in the Church, Page 34.
Sect. vii.
and to whose children also you here deny baptism, I will ask you but this
one question, what you think of all those, which are not only children to
professed and known Papists, but baptized also in the Romish Church? for if
the children of known Papists, may not be baptized, what shall we say of
our selves, and of our Parents and predecessors, who all, or the most of
them were professed Papists? is not this the ground of Rebaptisation, and
Anabaptisme?

But that the Reader may the better understand your error, and the rather
believe it to be an error in dee^, I will set down M. Beza his opinion of
this matter, from whom you are loathe (I am sure) to be thought to dissent. In
his book of Epistles, Epist. 10 answering this question ( whether the infantes
of such as are excommunicated Beza li. Epist. Epist. 10.
may be baptized, and in whose faith, when as they of whom they are begotten,
are not members of the Church) determines thus.

God forbid that we should judge all one and a like of all such as are not
called the members of the Church, for there are four kinds of men far
differing among them selves. One is of them, which neither by election,
neither in them selves are by any means the members of Christ, whom we call
by the word of God reprobate and the vessels of anger, and appointed to
destruction, although many of them sometime in appearance, that is in outward
profession, yea and a certain semblance of faith, continuing for a time,
wherewith they mock both them selves and other, are reckened among the members
of the Church, of whom John says, if they had been of us, they would have
tarried with us.

The second is of those, which are chosen in Christ by eternal election,
and therefore are the members of Christ, yet by purpose only not in deed:
in which sense Paul says that he was severed from his mothers womb, when as
notwithstanding, he was a long time the member of Satan persecuting Christ:
and in an other place says, that grace was given us in Christ before
everlasting times: and again, that God loved us when we were his enemies.

In the third kind we count them, that both by election and in deed are
the sons of God, because as the Apostle says, they are ruled by the spirit
of God.

Finally, in the fourth place we reckon those, who whereas they appertain to
the election of God, and be engraffed in Christ, yet because having fallen in
some thing (as men often do) they be an offense to the other members,
therefore least the wound should be deadlye, which Satan and the flesh has
given them, need a more sharp remedy, and are therefore excommunicated or
delivered to Satan, not that they should peryshe (for it is not possible that
they should peryshe which are the members of Christ) But that godly
sorowefulnesse may cause repentance, either that their flesh (that is the old
man) dying, their spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.

These therefore be they whom we call excommunicated, and who for two
respects are not members of the Church, one according to men, because they
are excluded from the holy fellowship of the faithful: the other according to
God, because that saying of Christ is sure, that, that is bound in heaven,
which is ryghtlye bound of the Church in the earth.

But it is an other thing truly to be bound in heaven, than to be cast out
of that true kingdom of heaven, which never happens to any of the elect.
For that saying of Christ stands, that those shall never be cast out whom
the Father has given the Son: and that of Lohn, if they had been of us, they
would have tarried with us: and that of the Apostle, the foundation of God
stands sure, having this seal, the Lord knows who be ^is. Therefore as
touching Christ, these are said not to be his, nor members of the Church, not
as the first which are reprobate and damned, but because for a time as
concerning the force and efficacy of the spirit, they are without him, as
being so engraffed in him, that they receive not that lyuelye nouryshement of
the spirit of Christ for a time, that is, till grace of repentance be given
them. To conclude, the difference betwixt these and the first is such, as is
between a leg of wood joined cunninglye to a true body (which
notwithstanding is not a leg in deed, neither is truly called a part of
that man) and betwyxt a true leg, that yet for a time receives not
nouryshement in such sort, that unless it be refreshed by the strength of
some sharp medicine, it will necessaryly putrific and clean peryshe.
Wherefore seeing these things be thus, and charity byddeth us to hope well
of all, yea and also to take care for them, which are held as captives in the
snare of the Devil: God forbydde that the Parents being excommunicated, we
should conclude that their posterity belongs not to the kingdom of God.
Furthermore, there is great difference between those, which although they be
notorious offenders, nevertheless depart not from the Church, and between
those that are manifest rennegates, joining them selves with the enemies to
oppress the truth of the Gospel. Further, it were unreasonable to esteem of
Papists, much less Christians excommunicated, no otherwise than of Turks:
for although it be impossible to serve the Pope and Christ together, yet it is
certain that Popery is an erring of the Christian Church. Wherefore the
Lord has in the midst of that goulfe of Papistrie preserved Baptism, that
is the first entering into the Church: whereby it appears (as also the thing
it self proves in us) that although Papisme be not the Church, yet the
Church has been and is (as it were) drowned or covered in it: which can not
by any means be said of the Turks, which never gave their names to
Christ. Lastly, for so much as the goodness of God is extended to a thousand
generations, that is (as it were) without end, it were hard if we should
judge of the children, whether they belong to the covenant of God or no, by the
profession of their last Parents. Therefore of all these arguments joined
together, we conclude that the children of persons excommunicate, abiding yet
in the Church of God, can by no right be debarred from Baptism, if in case a
meet surety be had, which will make promise to the Church that they shall
be virtuously brought up, which I think ought to be done of the Ministers them
selves, and other Godly men, rather than their Baptism should any longer be
deferred. Yet it shall not be amiss, if the Minister before he baptize the
infant, taking hereof occasion, earnestly exhort the father that is
excommunicated being present, to ^epentance before the assembly, which is
oftentimes practiced in our Churches. Hitherto Beza.

And in the. 193. page, he asks what if the Parents of the child be
unknown, if it be, yet if godly men will present it to baptism, with promise
of seeing it brought up in the fear of the Lord, for so much as it is found
in a place where the church is, and therefore by likelyhoode to apperteyne to
some that was of the church, I think it may be baptized, if the church
think it good in this last case.

Io. Whitgifte.
And why should you but think so? what reason is there why it should not be
baptized? But yet this answer of yours does nothing justify the Aomonition:
Which would, The parents to present their children, if conuentently, making
an open confession of that faith, wherein he would have his child baptized:
For this can not be done where the Parents be unknown, neither is (in such
case) any other man able to testify of what faith or behavior the parents
were.

Chap. 4. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 137. Sect. vlt.
Then he goes forth in the. III. Page to prove that the children of those,
which he has reckened may be baptized, and demands whither a wicked father
may have a good child, a Papist or Heretic father a believing child? yes
verily may they. So may have, and has the Turk and the Jew, and yet their
children are not to be received unless their faith does fitste appear by
confession, But you say the Papiste an Heretic be Baptized, and so are not the
Jews and Turks. Their baptism being cut of from the Church, makes them as
much strangers unto it, as was Ismaell and Esau, which albeit they were
circumcised, yet being cast out of the Church, they were no more to be
accounted to be of the body of Gods people, then those which never were in the
Church. Now you see It is poison in deed, and the same whi^he I suspected.
the poison (as you term it) which lies hid under these words, and if it
be as you say poison, let us have some of your triacle. In all the rest of
that section, there is nothing but that, which he spoke of before, only the
Eldership is ^amed, which comes to be entreated of in the next section.

Io. Whitgifte.
If their baptism be so cut of, that it also takes away the privilege from
their children, how can they be admitted again into the Church without
rebaptisation? S. Augustine in the place before recited, says that Heretics
though they be cut of from the Church yet they do retain their Baptism,
which being true, there is no reason to seclude their children from it. I
cannot learn but that the Sons of Ismaell were circumcised: for it is
written of the Egyptians (as P. Martyr does note) P. Martyr in 4. Romans
that they circumcided at. 14. years of age, because Ismael was then
circumcised: Which time of circumcision the Arabians observed in like manner.
And therefore it is not unlike but that the Posterity of Ismael was
circumcised. And as for the Sons of Esau it is not like that they were
debarred from circumcision, seeing Esau himself received the sign of the
covenant, notwithstanding he was before rejected. Romans 9.
And that his posterity were not so far estraunged from the people of God as
those that never were in the Church, it may appear by that which is written
in Deutronomie, where the Israelites are willed to acknowledge them for their
Deuteronomy. 23. verse. 7. 8. The papists ly^e ^o the (...) v^der Ieroboani etc.
Brethren, and to admit their children in the third Generation, into the
congregation of the Lord. And yet are not the Papists like unto Ismael and
Esau: but rather the same with the Israelites under Jeroboam, etc. for as they
professed the law of Moses, had circumcision, and were not in all points
strange from the faith of the Jews: but yet joined thereunto Idolatry, and
the false worshipping of God: even so the Papists pretend the law of God,
use the Sacraments, profess Christianity, and are not in all points
strange from Christian faith, but yet have corrupted the same with idolatrous
worshipping, and diverse other kinds of superstition, and errors. Therefore
says M. Beza very well in the words before recited, Beza Epist. 10.
Papismus est Ecclesiae Christianae aberratio. Papisme is the erring of the
Christian Church: And Ecclesia est velut immersa in Papatu, quod de Turcis
dici nullo modo potest, qui nunquam Cbristo nomen dederunt: the Church is as
it were covered or drowned in Papisme, which can by no means be said of
Turks, which never gave their names to Christ or professed Christianity.
Wherefore if you had made a right comparison, you should not have compared them
to Ismaell and Esau, but to the reuolting Israelites, as M. Martyr does,
saying thus expressly, Quales olim Israelitae, etc. Such are the Martyr. in. 3.
cap. 1. Reg.
Papists at this day, if they be compared with the professors of the Gospel,
as were the Israelites in respect of the Jews. But full well you knew that in
so doing, your error would soon have been espied: for though the Israelites
were separated from the true Church, yet were not their children cut of from
the covenant, or debarred from the sign thereof.

The poison which (you say) we now see, and that lies hid under these
words, is, The poison that is hid in the Repliers doctrine.
the debarring of children from Baptism for their parents offenses being
baptized, and rebaptisation: Both which you do in more plain manner affirm
than the Admonition does, and therefore for triacle to cure these venomous
diseases I send you to the learned works of S. August. Contra epist.
Parmeniani: de Baptis. contra Donatistas: of M. Bullinger, Zuinglius, Calvin
and others, which have written against these poisoned points of the
Anabaptists and Donatistes.

Of the Seigniorie or government by Seniors. Tract. 17.
Whether there were such as the Admonition calls Seniors, in every
Congregation.
Chap. 1. the. 1. Division.
T. C. Page 138.. Sect. 1.
As though M. Doctor were at utter defiaunce with all good order, and method
of writing, Of Seniors.
that which was given him orderly by the Admonition, he has turned
vpsidedowne. For where the Admonition speaks first of the Elders, then of
that which is annexed unto them, which is the discipline (whereof
excommunication is a part) considering that the subject is in nature before
that which is annexed unto it, M. Doctor has turned it clean contrary, and
first speaks of excommunication, and then of the Elders. I will therefore
(that the reader may the easelier understand that which is said) follow the
order of the Admonition, and first of all speak of the Elders or Seniors which
ought to be in the Church, and in speaking of them, I must call to
remembrance that division which I made mention on before, that is, of those
which have care and govern the whole congregation, some there be which do
both teach the word and govern also: some which do not teach, but only
govern and be ayders in the government, unto those which do teach. This
division is most manifestly set forth in the Epistle unto Timothe: where he
says, the Elders 1. Tim. 5.
which rule well, are worthy of double honor, and especially those which
labor in the word and doctrine, where he makes by plain and express words
two sorts of Elders, the one which does both govern and teach: the other
which governs only. These therefore are the Seniors which are meant, whose
office is in helping the Pastor or Bishop, in the government of that particular
Church, where they be placed Pastors and Elders.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is no rare matter in handling any thing, first to entreat of that which is
natura posterius: and we see it commonly so used by Logicians, who first
treat of that part which is called Iudicium, then of the other which is
called Inuentio, notwithstanding Inuentio in nature is before Iudicium. But I
will not spend incke and paper in answering so vain a cauillation. The truth
is, that I in mine Answer follow the order of the Admonition. For I prove that
it was not the office of those Seniors to govern the Church, etc. because they
had nothing to do with excommunication being the chiefest discipline in the
Church, seeing the execution thereof was committed to the Minister of the word
only. So that I first take away authority from their Seniors, and then
answer the places which they abuse for the establishing of their authority.

My words be these: What Scripture have you to prove that such Seniors as you
mean, and Deacons had any thing to do in Ecclesiastical discipline? but all
this is from the purpose. Your division of Seniors, though I know that it has
learned Patrones, yet do I not understand how it agrees with the word of
God: for if we consider the writings of the Apostles, it will evidently
appear that Presbyter is usually taken for Episcopus, or Minister, or Pastor,
Presbyter usually taken for a minister. 1. Pet. 5. Act. 20. Tit. 1.
as 1. Pet. 5. Presbyteros qui inter vos sunt bortor, qui sum and ipse
Presbyter: etc. pascite. etc. The Elders which are among you, I beseech, which
am my self also an Elder. etc Feed the the flock. etc. And in the Act. S.
Paul calls the same men Seniors and Bishops: and by Seniors means none
other than Bishops and Pastors, as it is evident in that place. Likewise ad
Titum. 1. he says, that Titus was left at Creta, vt constituat opidatim
presbyteros, That he should appoint Elders in every city. And declaring what
qualities they ought to have, he adds: Oportet Episcopum immunem esse a
crimine. etc. A Bishop must be unreprovable: etc. Whereby it is manifest that
he takes them both for one.

The only place that has any show for the proof of your distinction, is
that, Two kinds of Presbyteri. 1. Tim. 5.
1. Tim. 5. Presbyteri qui been praesunt, etc. The Elders that rule well are
worthy double honor, specially they which labor in the word and doctrine.
Where although S. Paul makes a distinction of Seniors, yet it is certain,
that under the name of Seniors, he does comprehend such only as be Ministers
of the word or Sacraments. Tract. 9. cap. 1. the. 15. division. and Tract.
6. Cap. 1.
And I have before sufficiently proved that the administration of the
Sacraments may be committed to some, to whom the preaching of the word of
God is not committed. And this distinction of Ministers does this place. 1.
Timot. 5. very well justify: for unless the Apostle S. Paul had meant, that
of Ministers some preached, some only ministered the Sacraments, he would not
have said, Maxim qui laborant sermon and doctrina only, but, qui laborant
sermon and administratione Sacramentorum: for so should he plainly have
declared that there were some Presbyteri which did neither labor in
Preaching, nor in the Administration of the Sacraments. This same distinction
of ministers is also justified by that which the Apostle speaks. 1. Corinthians.
1. Non misit me Christus vt Baptizarem. etc. Meaning 1. Cor. 1.
because the word was the greater, therefore he might not leave the greater
for the less. Now if all they that baptized had the gift of preaching also,
why might not and ought not they in like manner to say, Christ sent us not to
baptize, but to preach?

S. Ambrose writing upon these words: Aduersus Presbyterum, etc. Against an
Ambrose. 1. Tim. 5.
Elder receive no accusation. etc. Which immediately follow the other, does
understand thereby Ministers and Priests only, for he calls them Vicarios
Christi, Christ's vicars, and Antistites Dei: Gods Prelates. So does M. Calvin
in like manner expound Calvin. in. 1. Tim. 5.
the same word of Pastors, and Teachers. I know that in the exposition of
this sentence, Qui been praesunt presbyteri, etc. he makes two kinds of
Seniors, but yet does he Instit. Cap. 8. Sect. 52. (where he purposely speaks
of Seniors) say that they were all preachers. Neither do I see any cause, why
this word Presbyter should not in both these places be taken in one and the
same signification. Chrysostom also (if Chrysostom.
his words be well marked) upon this place of Timoth. Presbyteri qui been
praesunt, etc. it will appear that he does not extend this word Presbyter
to any other, than to Ministers of the word and Sacraments.

The words of Jerome be plain, for expounding these words, Maxim qui
laborant Jerome.
etc. He says thus: Non dixit omnium qui habent verbum, sed qui laborant in
verbo: Caeterum omnes habentes praecipit ordinare. He says not of all that
have the word, but that labor in the word: But he commanded him to ordeyne,
all that have the word. And surely I have not read this word in any ancient
History or Father, commonly taken in any other signification.

In stead of Chancelours, Archdeacons, Officialls, Commissaries, Proctors,

But I pray you do thus much for me, first prove that there was Certain
questions deman^ded to be proved.
in every congregation such as you call Seniors: when you have done that, the^
show me that that office and kind of regiment ought to be perpetual, and not
rather to be altered according to the state and condition of the Church: last
of all, that those Seniors were lay men as we call them, and not rather
ministers of the word, and Bishops. When you have satisfied my request in
these three points, then will I proceed further in this matter.

T. C. Page 138. In the midst.
Now that it is known what these Seniors be, in entreating of them I am
content to answer M. Doctor three requests which he makes in the, 125. page,
where he desires that one would do so much for him, as first to show that
these Seniors were in every congregation: secondarily, he will have it proved
that this regiment is perpetual, and not to be altered: last of all, he
desires to know, whether these Seniors werelay men, and not rather ministers
of the word and Bishops. This last is a fond request, and such as is already
answered, but he must be followed.

For the first therefore, which is that there were Seniors in every
congregation, although M. Doctor in the. 114. page, and in the. 132. page
constrained by Ambrose authority, confesses it in plain words, yet because
he requires it to be showed and makes a jest at those places, which are
alleged out of the scripture to prove it, some thing must be spoken thereof.

Io. Whitgifte.
You build your platform upon marvelous slender proofs, and except the
Reader will believe your bare words, he shall find great scarcity of any
other arguments. For where have you as yet proved your opinion of Seniors to
be true? The place of S. Paul. 1. Tm. 5 does not help you, being otherwise
taken and expounded of the ancient fathers: but I will follow your raze. The
last question you say is fond and already answered: Answered as yet it is not,
and the fondness of it will appear, by the wisdom of your answer hereafter.

The words of Ambrose be, that the Synagogue, and after the church, had
Seniors. etc. in 1. Tim. 5.
but he says not that every several congregation had Seniors: for it was not
so among the Jews. Therefore it cannot be gathered of Ambrose, that every
particular parish had Seniors. Neither is there any ancient Author that
affirms it. Touching the having of Seniors in the Church, why it was then
convenient, and is not so now, I have declared in the Answer to the Admonition.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.

The first place is in the Acts, which is that Paul and Barnabas did appoint
by election. Elders Act. 14.
in every congregation, but it is A (...).
not like they did appoint diverse ministers or Bishops, which preached in
every congregation, which were not to be had for such a number of congregations
as were then to be preached unto: therefore in every congregation there were
besides those that preached, other Elders which did only in government assist
the pastors which preached. And what should we follow conjectures here, when S.
Paul does in the place before alleged declare, 1. Tim. 9.
what these elders are?

Io. Whitgifte.
If you have no stronger place to confirm your Seniors by, than this, they
will fall The place Acts. 14. proves nothing for Seniors.
flat to the ground. For it is most certain that Luke in this place by
Presbyteros, does only mean Pastors and Preachers of the word, as he does
also through the whole Acts speaking of Christians: and it is a strange
matter that you dare be bold to ground any point of government or doctrine
upon so simple and slender conjectures. For what reason call you this: Paul
and Barnabas did appoint by election elders in every congregation. etc. but it
is not like they did appoint diverse ministers or Bishops which preached in
every congregation, etc. therefore in every congregation there were besides
those that preached, other elders, etc. First I say, that this argument does
consist only upon a vain conjecture, for it might be that the number of
Preachers were such, that every congregation where Paul and Barnabas had to
do, might have mo preachers than one. But Lord what moves you, to play the
Sophister in so serious a cause? and so to dally in a matter so manifest? for
how can you conclude by any thing here spoken, that Paul and Barnabas did
ordeyne mo than one Pastor or Presbyter in one congregation? for this that is
said, that they ordained Elders or ministers in every congregation, does not
importe that they ordained mo than one, in every congregation, but that they
ordained for diverse congregations, diverse ministers, that is, for every
congregation a Pastor. Does not the Apostle S. Paul ad Tit. 1. use the like
kind of speech when he said Tit. 1.
unto him, For this cause I left thee at Creta, etc. Vt constituas opidatim
presbyteros, etc? Where it is manifest, as I said before, that he means
Bishops and Pastors: and yet his intent was not that Titus should appoint for
every congregation many Pastors. This is mere cauilling: but to cut of all
other doubts, M. Calvin is sufficient to determine this controversy, who
expounding this place of the. 14. Acto. does understand it of Pastors only and
Preachers. His words be these: Presbyteros bic vocari interpretor, Calvin.
quibus iniunctum erat docendi munus. I interpret those here to be called
Presbyteros, unto whom the office of preaching was committed. And a little
after: Now whereas Luke says that they were appointed over several churches,
thereof may the difference between their office and the office of the Apostles
be gathered, for the Apostles had in no place any certain abiding, but went
from place to place always to found new churches: but Pastors were every where
addicted to their proper Churches. So says Brentius likewise: Constituerunt
Brentius.
per singulas Ecclesias Presbyteros, quos alias scriptura Episcopos, alias
Pastores vocat. They appointed thorough every congregation Elders, whom the
scripture sometimes calls Bishops, sometimes Pastors. So that this place of
the Acts speaks not one word of your Seniors. And therefore you cannot
expound it by that in the. 1. Tim. 5. though it served your purpose, as it does
not. For Luke (to my remembrance) no where in the Acts, does take this word
Presbyter for any other than such as have authority, to preach the word and
minister the sacraments, except he means ye elders of the Jews.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.
Admonition.
Let us come now to the third part, which concerns ecclesiastical
discipline: the officers that have to deal in this charge, are chiefly three,
Ministers, Preachers or Pastors, of whom before. Seniors or Elders and Deacons.
Concerning Seniors, not only their office, but their name also is out of this
English Church utterly removed. Their office was to ( Act. 14. 4. 1. Cor. 12.
28.
) govern the church with the rest of the Ministers, to consulte, to admonish,
to correct, and to order all things apperteyning to the state of the
congregation.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 113. Somevvhat past the midst.
To prove that the office of Seniors was to govern the Church with the rest
of the ministers, to consulte, to admonish, to correct and to order al things
apperteyning, to the state of the congregation, you allege Act. 14. and the.
1. Corinthians. 12. In the 14. of the Acts it is written that Paul and Barnabas
ordained Elders at Antioche in every Church, but there is not one word spoken
of their office, and therefore that text serves not your purpose. You have
alleged this self same place twice before, to prove that no minister of the
word ought to be placed in any congregation, but by consent of the people, and
that the election of ministers ought to be by the congregation: now you allege
it to prove the office of your Seniors: can it both be meant of Seniors, and of
the ministers of the word, being as you say, distinct offices? will you thus
dally with the scripture, and make it a nose of wax (as the Papists term it)
to wreast and wryth it which way you list? here you must needs confess either
contradiction in your selves, or falsification.

T. C. Page 138. Toward the end.
But M. Doctor says that there is no mention made of the office of such an
Elder: therefore that place makes nothing to prove that there should be such
Elders in every congregation: so M. Doctor write, he cares not what he write.
Belike he thinks the credit of his degree of Doctorship, will give weight to
that which is light, and pith to that which is frothe, or else he would never
answer thus. For then I will, if this be a good reason, say, that for so much
as S. Luke does not in that place, describe the office of the Pastor or Bishop
which preaches the word, therefore that place proves not that in every
congregation there should be a bishop or a Pastor. Besides that M. Doctor
takes up the Authors of the Admonition for reasoning negatiuely of the
testimony of all the Scriptures, and yet he reasons negatiuely of one only
sentence in the Scripture. An untruth, for he makes no such conclusion.
For the would conclude, that for so much as there is no duty of a Senior
described in that place, therefore there is no duty at all, and consequently
no Senior.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Authors of the Admonition Fol. 112. to prove that the office of the Senior
was, to govern the Church with the rest of the ministers, to c^nsulte, to
admonish, to correct and to order all things apperteyning to the state of the
congregation, allege the. 14. of the Acts, verse. 4. 1. Cor. 12. verse. 28. I
declare in mine Answer how unaptly these places are alleged for that purpose,
being not one word there spoken of any such office of Seniors: as it may
appear in the words themselves, being placed before. Now whether I make any
such reason as you frame in my name, or no, let the Reader judge. The places
be quoted in the Admonition to prove the office of Seniors, and not to prove
that there were Seniors in every congregation: and you being not able to salve
that their unskillfulness, make M. Doctor speak what you please, and shifte of
the matter after your accustomed manner. I make not that conclusion you charge
me with: if I do, set down my words and convince me: if I do not, who has
taught you to speak untruly? my words I have expressed: let the Reader
consider of them, and here also take a note of your truth and honesty.

Chap. 2. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 139. Sect. 1.
Afterward he says, that for so much as this place has been used to prove
a Pastor or Bi^hop in every church: therefore it cannot be used to prove these
Elders, so that (says he) there must needs be either a contradiction, or
else a falsification. The place is rightly alleged for both, ^he one and the
other, and yet neither contradiction to themselves, nor falsification of the
place: but only a miste before M. Doctors eyes, which will not let him see a
plain and evident truth, which is, the word (Elder) is general and
comprehends both those Elders which teach and govern, and those which
govern only, as has been showed out of S. Paul.

Io. Whitgifte.
If it had these two significations, (as I have proved that it has not) yet
that it is so taken in the. 14. of the Acts, I cannot read in any writer, and
I have showed M. Caluines and M. Brentius judgments to the contrary, which in
any wise man's opinion are able to counteruayle your credit and bare denial.
And surely in that place it cannot be taken but in one and the self same
signification, except you will say that the spirit of God speaks ambiguously,
and uses aequiuocations. Which were to derogate much from the simplicity and
plainness of the Scriptures. Wherefore the Authors of the Admonition in
alleging that text in some place to prove the election of Pastors, and in some
other place to prove the office of Seniors, speak they know not what, and
dally with the Scriptures, even as you do in like manner, when you take upon
you the defense of so manifest a contradiction.

Chap. 1. the. 6. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 114. Sect. 1.
In the. 1. Corin. 12. S. Paul says, that God has ordained in the Go^rnours
in the church.
Church first Apostles, then Prophets, thirdly teachers, then them that do
miracles, after that the gifts of healing, helpers, governors, diversities of
tongues: here is not one word of the office of Seniors, neither yet of their
names: for this word, governors, teaches us, that Christ has ordained in
his church, some to bear rule and govern, but whether one in every
congregation or more: whether ministers of the word or other: whether
Magistrates or Seniors, it is not here expressed: howsoever it is, it makes
nothing for your purpose.

And whereas M. Doctor says, that the place of the Corinths may be

whole Church, and not of every particular Church, and finally any thing,
rather than that whereof it is in dee^e understood: I say first that he still
stumbleth at one stone, which is, that he can not put a difference between
the Church and common wealth: and so between the Church officers, which he
there speaks of, and the officers of the common wealth, those which are
^cclesiasticall, and those which are civil. Then that he means not the
minister which preaches, it may appear, for that he had noted them before in
the word (teachers) and last of all he can not mean governor of the whole
Church, unless he should mean ^ Pope, and if he will say he means an
Archbishop which governs a whole Province, besides that it is a bold speech
without all warrant, I have showed before, that the word of God allows of no
such office, and therefore it remains, that it must be understood of this
office of Elders.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here have you manyfestly fals^yed my book, and greatly abused me. For I have
not these words, of governors of the whole Church, and not of every
particular Church: neither any thing sounding that way: the Reader has my
words before his eyes, let him consider whether you have reported them truly,
or no. Surely if there were nothing else, your often leasings might sufficiently
convince your doctrine of mere vanity and forgerie.

But to return to your Reply.

First, I can not put any such difference betwixt the Church and a Christian
common wealth, the Church officers and christian Magistrates, that they may not
be comprehended under this word used in this place by the Apostle. For I
utterly renounce that distinction invented by Papists, and maynteyned by you,
which is, that Christian The Papists opinion of christian Magistrates.
Magistrates do govern, not in the respect they be Christians, but in the
respect they be men: and that they govern Christians, not in that they be
Christians, but in that they be men. Which is, to give no more authority to a
Christian Magistrate in the Church of Christ, than to the great Turk. I am
fully persuaded therefore, that there is no such distinction betwixt the
Church of Christ, and a Christian common wealth, as you and the Papists
dream of. And therefore there is no cause why the Apostl^ may not in this
place, under this word, Governors, comprehend as well civil Magistrates, as
ecclesiastical. The which notwithstanding, I do not determinately affirm,
as likewise I have not done in mine Answer: for I would be glad to learn, and
to hear some reason to the contrary. Master Gualter seems to ^auour this
opinion, for expounding this place, he says: He comprehends seventhly
Gualter in. ^ Cor. 12.
in this order, governors, under whom are contained civil persons, which in
worldly matters did aid all men, and had the hearing of causes, if any fell
out amongst the Christians. And a little after: There is no need of such
publicly now a days, seeing there are christian Magistrates, by whose
authority all these things may be better provided for. Moreover the Apostle
may mean in that place Bishops or Pastors, of whom he made no mention before.
For you will not have the office of a Pastor, and of a Doctor confounded,
wherefore you forget your self in saying, that in this word, teachers, he
means the minister that teaches, that is, the Pastor, for of him I am sure
you mean. Last of all, I have no where said, that he means one governor of
the whole Church, neither have I written one word tending to that end, but
this I say again, whether the Apostle means one ruler in every congregation,
or mo, is not here determined: and I see no cause, as I have said, why in
this place of the Apostle, this word, Governors, may not either signify the
Christian Magistrates o^ Ecclesiastical, as Archbishops, Bishops, or
whatsoever other by lawful authority are appointed in the Church: neither is
there any reason to be showed, why he should rather mean your Seniors, than
any other Magistrates. Sure I am that there be learned men which think that
the Apostle in this word does comprehend Ecclesiae gubernatores, tum
ciuiles; tum ecclesiastic^s: The governors of the Church as well civil as
ecclesiastical. Howsoever it is, the place being doubtful, it can not esta
blishe the office of your Seniors, as perpetual.

Chap. 1. the. 7. Division.
Admonition.
In stead of these Seniors in ( Romans 1^. 8
) every Church the Pope has brought in, and yet we maynteyne the Lordship of
one man over sundry churches, yea over many shyres.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 115. Sect. vlt.
You allege in the margent these words in the. 12. to the Romans ( He that
exhorts, let him wait on exhortation: he that distribute^h, let him do it
with simplicity: he that rules, with diligence: he that shows mercy,
with cherefulnesse.) To prove that in stead of these Seniors in every
Church, the Pope has brought in, and we yet maynteyne the Lordship of one man
over many Churches. etc. I know not how this gear hangs together, or to what
purpose you should allege that place: it neither proves, that in every
Church there was Elders, neither that in place of them the Pope has brought
in the the Lordship of one man over many Churches.

T. C. Page 139. Sect. 1.
The same answer may be made unto that which he says of the place to the
Romans, where Cap. 12.
speaking of the offices of the Church, after that he had set forth the office
of the pastor, and of the Doctor, he adds those other two offices of the
Church, whereof one was occupied in the government only, the other in providing
for the poor, and helping the sick. And if besides the manifest words of the
Apostle in both these places, I should add the sentences of the writers upon
those places, as M. Calvin, M. Beza. M. Martyr, M. Bucer. etc. It should
easily appear, what just cause M. Doctor has to say, that it is to dally with
the scriptures, and to make them a nose of wax, in alleging of these to prove
the Elders, that al men might understand, what terrible outc^ies he makes, as
in this place, so almost in all other, when there is cause, that he should lay
his hand upon his mouth.

Io. Whitgifte.
The like answer do I make to that place also that I made to ye former. M.
Calvin Calvin.
says, that these words of the Apostle, Qui pr^est in diligentia: he that
rules with diligence, may generally be extended ad praefecturas omne genus: to
all kind of rule or government. And M. Martyr upon the same words, says, that
he doubts not, multas fuisse in Martyr. Beza.
ecclesia praefecturas: that there were many governments in the Church. M. Beza
likewise although he says that the Apostle in this word understands
presbyteros, yet he adds, qui and ipsi interdu^ doctrinae verbo praeerant:
which also sometime did preach the word. M. Bucer says plainly, Est praeterea
qui praeest, qui pascendi and regendi ecclesia^ mun^ accepit: Bucer.
Furthermore he does rule, which has received the office of feeding and
governing the Church. Whereby he must needs understand the Pastor, and not any
unpreaching Senior. But what kind of argument call you this? he that rules,
must do it with diligence, Ergo, there must be Seniors in every parish. You
should rather conclude thus, therefore those to whom God has committed any
office of government, must do the same diligently and carefully.

So that although these learned me^ do understand this place of Seniors, yet do
they The place Romans 12. is general.
think, yt it may also be understood of other magistrates and governors: and
therefore upon their interpretatio^s you can not conclude any certentie of your
Seniors. And M. Beza seems by ye name of Seniors, to understand the ministers
of the word, that is, Bishops and pastors: and there is no doubt, but that ye
Apostle in this place does admonish al to be dilligent in their office, that
have any kind of government committed unto the^. Wherefore you may not restrain
this to any one particular kind of government, which y^ Apostle has generally
spoken of al: for that were in deed to dally with the scriptures, and to abuse
them as the Papists do, yea to make the^ a nose of wax, as I have said before.

Chap. 1. the. 8. Division.
T. C. Page 139. Sect. 2.
This I am compelled to write, not so much to pro^e that there were Seniors in
every Church (which is a thing confessed) as to redeem those places from M.
Doctors false and corrupt interpretations, for as for the proof of Elders in
every congregation, ^esides his confession, I need have no more but his own
reason. For he says that the office of these Elders in every Church* was in
that tun^ wherein there were no christian Magistrates, and when there was
perfecution, but in the Apostles times there was both persecution, and no
christian Magistrates, therefore in their time the office of these Elders was in
every congregation.

Io. Whitgifte.
If this be a good argument, S. Paul ad Romans 12. says, he that ^uleth, must
do it diligently: Ergo, every particular congregation must of necessity be
governed by Seniors: Or this, the Apostle. 1. Cor. 12. says, that God has
placed in his Church governors, Ergo, every parish must have a Seigniorie: Or
this, Paul and Barnabas in every Church ordained pastors, therefore in every
Church there must be a company of Seniors, to whom the whole government of the
parish is to be committed: If (I say) these be good and sure arguments, then
have I corruptly interpreted those places. But if these arguments be not
sound, if they have no sequel in them, if they be against the practice of the
Church ever since it had christian Magistrates, and long before, especially for
such Elders as you mean, if this kind of government in many reformed
Churches be not thought convenient, if it spoil the Christian Magistrate of
the authority given unto him by the word of God, and finally, if it bring in
confusion, then have I truly interpreted those places, and according to my
duty and calling delivered them from your corruptions. But the truth of this
matter shall more evidently appear in that which follows.

That which I have said of the being of Seniors in every Church, I say
still: neither is that the question, for I ask y^ question of your Seniors,
not of Ministers, (whom I call Seniors) neither did I mean that in every
particular parish, there was such a Seigniorie, but in every chief City, nor
that it was at all times in persecution, and where there was no Christian
Magistrate, but ^ometimes: neither that this kind of government must be in
such times, but that it may be. And therefore you had done well, if you had
not been so sparing of your proofs, for all my grant.

Whether the government by Seniors ought to be perpetual.
Chap. 2. the first Division.
T. C. Page 139. Sect. 2.
I come therefore to the second point, wherein the question especially lies,
which is, whether this function be perpetual, and ought to remain always in
the Church. And it is to be observed by the way, that whereas there are
diverse sorts of adversaries to this discipline o^ the Church, M. Doctor is
amongst the worste. For there be that say, that this order may be used or not
used now, at the liberty of the Churches: But M. Doctor says that this order
is not for these times, but only for those times when there were no Christian
Magistrates, and so does flatly pynche at those Churches, which having
Christian Magistrates, yet notwithstanding reteyne this order still.

Io. Whitgifte.
I say so still, and I am able to defend my saying, against all that you have
showed to the contrary. And yet do I not pinche at any Church that uses it
(if there be any such) so that they have the consent of the civil Magistrate,
who may if he will depart from his right, and abridge himself of the authority
committed unto him by God. But he need not so do except he list: and whether
it be well done or no, I will not determine: this I am well assured of, that in
a Monarchy, and in a kingdom such as this Realm of England is, it can not be
practiced, without intolerable contention, and extreme confusion: except you
could devise to make every several parish a kingdom within it self, and
exempt it from all ecclestastical and civil jurisdiction, of Prince, Prelate,
and whomsoever? which undoubtedly may seem to be your seeking, as will appear
hereafter.

Chap. 2. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page 139. Sect. vlt. and Page 140. Sect. 1.
And to the end that the vanity of this distinction, which is, that there
ought to be Seniors or Ancients in the times of persecution, and not of peace:
under tyrants, and not under christian Magistrates may appear: the cause why
these Seniors or ancients were appointed in the Church; is to be considered,
which must needs be granted to be, for that the Pastor not being able to
ouersee al himself, and to have his eyes in every corner of the church, and
places where ye Churches abode, might be helped of the Ancients. Wherein the
wonderful love of God toward his church does manifestly appear, that for
the greater assurance of the salvation of his, did not content himself to
appoint one only ourseer of every church, but many over every church.

And therefore seeing that the Pastor is now in the time of peace, and under a
christian Magistrate not able to ouersee al himself, nor his eyes can not be
in every place of the parish present to behold the behavior of the people, it
follows that as well now as in the time of persecution, as well under a
christian Prince, as under a tyrant, the office of an Ancient or Senior is
required. Unless you will say that God has less care of his church, in the
time of peace, and under a godly magistrate, than he has in the time of
persecution, and under a tyrante.

Io. Whitgifte.
I say there may be Seniors in the time of persecution, when there is no
christian Magistrate, not that there ought of necessity to be. God has
provided the civil Magistrate, and other gonernours, to punish and to correct
vice and other disorders in the Church: who has his officers and deputies in
every place for that purpose, neither may the Pastor, or any other, to whom
that charge is not committed by the civil magistrate, usurp that office unto
them selves. Wherefore that cause by you alleged, is no cause at all why there
should be any such Seniors, where there are christian Magistrates, neither is
that kind of government any part of the Pastors charge.

The Pastor if he be a meet man, is able to ^o all that, that is required of a
Pastor, else might it be said (which you before denied) that God appointed
offices and functio^s, and gave not sufficient gifts to execute and do them.
Neither can it be said, that God has ^esse care of his Church, when he places
civil and Christian Magistrates in the stead of Seniors, than when he places
Seniors, and leaves it destitute of Christian Mastrates. For one of the most
^ingular benefits that God bestows on his Church in this world is, that he
gives unto it christian Kings and Princes, from whose office and authority,
whosoever does detract and withdraw we any thing, iniurieth the ordinance of
God, and shows him self unthankful for so great a benefit.

Chap. 2. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 140. Sect. 1.
In deed if so be the Auncientes in the time of persecution, and under a
tyrant, had meddled with any office of a magistrate, or had supplied the room
of a godly magistrate, in handling of any of those things which belonged unto
him, then there had been some cause why a godly magistrate being i^ the
church, the office of the Senior, or at the least so much as he exercised of
the office of a magistrate, should have ceased. But when as the ancient
neither did, nor by any manner might meddle with those things which belonged
unto a magistrate, no more under a tyrante, than under a godly magistrate,
there is no reason why the magistrate entering into the church, the elder
should be therefore thrust out. Where find you this in all the scriptures
For the Elders office was to admonish severally, those that did amiss, to
comfort those which he saw weak and shaking, and to have need of comfort,
to assist the Pastor in ecclesiastical censures of reprehensions, sharper or
mylder, as the faults required, also to assiste in the suspentions from the
supper of the Lord, until some trial were had of the repentance of that
party which had confessed him self to have offended, or else if he remained
stubborn, to assist him in the excommunication. These were those things which
the Elder did, which for so much as they may do as well under a christian
magistrate, as under a tyrant, as well in the time of peace, as in the time of
persecution, it follows that as touching the office of Elders, there is no
distinction in the times of peace and persecution, of a christian Prince, and
of a tyrant.

Io. Whitgifte.
I would gladly know by what place of scripture you can i^stifie this office
that you The office ascri^ed to Seniors, (...) the ^gistrate o^ his authoriti^
in ecclesiastical matters.
here appoint unto Seniors. In so weighty a matter in my judgment you
should have done well to have used some authority of scripture, or other
ancient writer. The Admonition says, that the office of Seniors was to
govern the Church with the rest of the ministers, to consult, to admo^sh, to
correct, and to order all things apperteyning to the state of the congregation:
Which if it be true, I pray you what authority remains to the civil
Magistrate in ecclesiastical and Church matters? In d^ede if you make such a
distinction betwixt the Church and the common wealth, the ci^ill Magistrate and
the ecclesiastical, as you do throughout your whole book, it is no mar^ell

the office of Seniors to be perpetual. For you give no more authority to a
Christian Magistrate in ecclesiastical government, tha^ you would do to the
Turk, if you were under him. And therefore according to your platform, the
government of the Church is all one under a christian Magistrate, and under the
great Turk. But to l^aue the Admonition: what have you spoken of the office of
Seniors, which is not either proper to the Pastor, or common to all Christians,
or such as may be much better brought to pass, by the authority of the civil
Magistrate, than by the ignorance, simplicity, and rudeness of the most of
your Seniors? But first let us hear more of your (...) before we come to utter
the absurdity of your cause.

Chap. 2. the. 4. Division.
T. C. Page 140. in the midst.
But I will yet come nearer. That without the which the principal offices of
charity cannot be exercised, is necessary and always to be kept in the
Church: but the office of Ancients and Elders are such as without which the
principal offices of charity can not be exercised, therefore it follows that
this office is necessary. That the principal offices of charity cannot be
exercised without this order of Ancients, it may appear, for that he which
has faulted, and ame^deth not after he be admonished once pri^ately, and then
before one witness or two, cannot further be proceeded against, Math. 18.
according to the commandment of our savior Christ, unless there be in the
Church Ancients ^d Elders, therefore this principal office of charity which
tends to the amendment of him which has not pr^ofited by those two former
admonitions, can not be exercised without them. For it is commanded of our
savior Christ, that in such a case when a brother does not proffite by these
two warnings, it should be told the Church. Now I would ask who be meant by
the Church here, if he say by the Church, are meant al ye people, then I will
ask how a man can conveniently complayn^ to all the whole congregation, or how
can the whole congregation conveniently meet to decide of this matter. I do
not deny but the people have an interest in the excommunication, as shall be
noted hereafter, bu^ the matter is not so far come, for he must first refuse
to obey the admonition of the Church, or ever they can proceed so far. Well,
if it be not the people that be meant by the Church. who is it? I hear M.
Doctor say it is the Pastor, but if he will say so, and speak so straungely,
he must warrant it with some other places of scripture, where the Church is
taken for one, which is as much to say as one man is many, one member is a
body, one alone is a company. And besides this strangeness of speech, it is
clean contrary to the meaning of our savior Christ, and destroys the
soueraintie of the medicine which our savior Christ prepared for such a
festred sore, as would neither be healed with priu^te admonition, neither with
admonition before one or two witnesses. For as ye fault grows, so our savior
Christ would have the number of those, before who^ he should be checked and
rebuked likewise grow. Therefore from a private admonition he rises unto the
admonitian before two or three, and from the^ to the church, which if we should
say it is but one, then to a dangerouser wound should be laid an easier
plaster, and therefore our savior does not rise from two to one (for that were
not to rise, but to fall, nor to proceed, but to go backwarde) but to many.
Seeing then that the church here is neither the whole congregation, nor the
pastor alone, it follows that by the church here he means the pastor, with
the Ancients or Elders. Or else whom can he mean? And as for this manner of
speech wherein by the church is understood the chief governors and Elders of
the church, it is oftentimes used in the old Testament, from the which our
savior borrowed this manner of speaking, as in Exodus it is said, that Moses
wrought his miracles before ye 4. chap.
people, when mention is made before, only of the Elders of the people, whom
Moses had called together. And most manifestly in Iosue, where it is said that
he that killed a man at vnwates, shall ^0. chap.
return unto the city until he stand before the congregation to be judged.
Where by the congregation, he means the governors of the congregation, for
it did not appertain to all to judge of this case. Likewise in the Cronicles,
and diverse other places. and therefore I conclude, that for so 1. li. 13. cha.
much as those be necessary and perpetual which are spoken of in those words
(tell the Church) and that under those words are comprehended the Elders or
Ancients, that the Elders and ancients be necessary and perpetual officers
in the church.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here are many words without matter, and a great thing pretended to no
purpose: for the principal offices of charity, both has bin and may be well
exercised without your Seniors: Dic ecclesiae interpreted.
the place Mat. 18. does in no respect prove the contrary. For it only
teaches an order how to proceed charitably in private offenses, and not in
public, as I have showed before. Moreover to tell the Church, is either
publikly to reprove those that have bin privately in that manner admonished, and
will not repent, or else to complain unto such as have authority in the
Church, according to that which I said before of this place, in my Answer to
ye Admonition. And herein you join with me, in that you take the Church
there, for the chief governors of the Church, though we differ in ye persons.
Church, for the governors of the church.
For you will have it only meant of the Pastor and Seniors, and I think it
signifies more generally any, which are lawfully appointed to govern the
church. But whether it be one or more that has this authority committed unto
him, it is more to tell him than it is to tell twenty besides: because he
being in authority, does bear the office of a public Magistrate, who has
power publicly to correct that which was privately committed: and therefore he
that tells one such, may well be said to tell the Church, because he tells
such a one as has authority in the Church, and is a public person. So that
he rises from private admonition to open complaint: from private witnesses, to
a public Magistrate: and therefore this is to rise, not to fall, to proceed, not
to go backwarde.

But admit that mo than one is understood by the name of the Church (which I
also confess) yet does it not follow, that it should be your Seigniorie,
which you would have in every congregation to consiste of the Pastor, and some
other of his parish, but rather such as Chrysostom calls Prelates and
Presidents, which are Bishops Hom. 61. in Matthew.
and such other chief governors. But be it that this place admitted ye same
sense, that you would have it to do, yet do I answer you as M. Musculus
answered ye Papists obiecting these words in effect to the same end that you
do, that is, to spoil the Christian Magistrate of his authority in
ecclesiastical matters. Obijciunt illud Christi, dic Musc. tit. de Magist. in
lo. ^om.
ecclesiae: Et, si ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi velut Ethnicus and
Publicanus. Respondeo, Ecclesiae dei tum Magistratu pio ac fideli
d^stituebantur. etc. They object (says he) that place of Christ, Dic
ecclesiae: tell the Church: and if he hear not the Church, let him be to thee
as an heathen and publicane. I answer, The Churches of God were then destitut^
of a godly and faithful Magistrate: wherefore the judgments between brethren
and brethren were exercised by Seniors in an ecclesiastical assembly, as it was
also usual in christian Churches planted by the Apostles. But there is a far
diverse condition of those Churches which by the benefit of God have obtained
Princes and christian Magistrates, who have the chieftie, power, the making of
laws, and government, not only in profane matters, but also in divine. But
that is a most pestilent error, whereby diverse men think no otherwise of the
christian Magistrate, than of a profane government, whose authority is to be
acknowledged only in profane matters. And surely you do not one jot in this
point differ from the opinion of the Papists. Truth it is, that the place of
Matthew may be understood of Seniors: but it may as well be understood of
any other that by the order of the church have authority in the Church. And
seeing that it admits diverse interpretations (as it does) there can no
such platform of necessity be grounded upon it.

Moreover when Christ said, Dic Ecclesiae, there was no christian Church
establis^ed, but he speaks according to the state of the Jews Church that
then was under the Heathenish Magistrates: as he also does when he says: If
thy brother Matthew. 5.
trespass against thee etc. leave thine offering before the alter. etc. And to
this does M. Calvin agree in his Harmony expou^ding ye same place. And surely
as of this place you may not conclude, that in the Church of Christ there
ought to be such offerings and alters, so may you not on the other place
conclude, that there ought always to be Seniors. Nay much less this, than
the other: for this is doubtful, and the other is plain.

Furthermore S. Paul having entreated throughout ye whole first epistle to
Timothy, of ye orders which ought to be in ye church of God, and of the
government, as himself witnesses in the ^hird 1. Tim. 6.
chapter of that Epistle, when he says he wrote that Epistle to teach Timothy
how he should behave himself in the house of God) and having set forth both
Bishop, and Elder, and Deacons, as ministers and officers of the Church, in the
shutting up of his Epistle he for the observation of all the orders of that
Epistle, adiureth Timothy, and with the invocation of the name of God
straightly charge him to observe those things which he had prescribed in that
epistle, I charge thee says he) before God which quickn^th all things, and
before Jesus Christ which witnessed under Pontius Pilate a good profession,
that thou keep this commandment without spot or blemish, until the appearing
of our Lord Jesus Christ. The weight of which sentence for the observing of
those things which are mentioned in this epistle, that it may be the better
understood, I will note the words severally.

First therefore it is to be noted, that he says (I denounceor I charge) he
does not say (I exhort or give counsel) leaving it to the liberty of Timothy.

Secondarily it is to be noted, that he calls This cannot be true as shall be
declared.
the whole Epistle a commandment, and therefore it is no permission, so that
it may be lawful for the churches to leave it, or to keep it.

Thirdly, when he makes mention of ^e living God, and of Christ which
witnessed a good profession under Pontius Pilate, he shows that the things
contained in this Epistl are such, as for the maintenance thereof we ought not
to doubt to give our lives, and that they be not such as we ought to keep, so
that we have them without strife and without sweat, or easily, but such as for
the keeping of them, if we have them, and for the obteyning of them if we have
them not, I will not say ^ur honors, or our commodi^ies and wealth, but as I
have said, our lives ought not to be dear unto us. For therefore does he make
mention of the confession of Christ unto death that he might show us an
example, and forthwith speaks of God, which rayseth from the dead, that by
this means he might comfort Timothy if he should be brought into any trouble
for the de^ense of any of these things.

Fourthly, if we refer those words without spot or blemish unto the
commandment (as I for my part think they ought to be) then there is a weight
in these words not to be passed over, which is, that the Apostle will not
only have the rules here contained, not trodden under the feet, or broken in
pieces, but he will not have them so much as in any one small point or specke
neglected. But I see how M. Doctor will wipe away all this, and say that these
things, or some of them were to be observed thus necessaryly and precisely
until there were christian princes and peace in the church, but the print is
deeper than that it will be so washed away, and therefore it is to be observed,
what he says in the latter end of the sentence, where he charge Timothy,
and in him al, that he should keep all these things, not until the time of
peace, or to the times of christian princes, but even until the coming or
appearing of our savior Christ, which is as long as the world lasts. And
therefore I conclude that the Seigniors or Elders of the Church (being a part
of that order and government of the Church, which S. Paul appoints in this
Epistle) are necessary, perpetual, and by no means to be changed.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is but to blind ye eyes of the Reader, being indeed without all pith
and gr^u^d. The office of Seniors not mentioned in the. 1. Tim. much less
commanded.
For first where has the Apostle in all that Epistle spoken one word of the
office of your Seniors, which you distinguish from a minister of ye word? where
does he give any such commandment concerning his office? Where does he
prescribe any such for me or kind of government? if he keep silence in this
matter thr^ugh ye whole epistle, how dare you presume to say that to be
commanded which is not mentioned, and to make so much ado about nothing?
surely if this kind of government had bin so necessary, and for ever to be
^bserued, S. Paul would not have omitted it in this Epistle especially. You say
that he has set forth, in that Epistle the office of an elder: if by an elder
you mean a Bishop or a Pastor, it is true. If you mean your own elder, such
as must govern only and neither preach nor minister the sacraments, it is very
untrue: and you have no conscience in speaking untruth: for he speaks not one
word of that senior or of his office. If you reply or object that which is
written. 1. Tim. 5. qui been praesunt (...). etc. I answer as I did before,
that by presbyter in that place he means such as be in the ministry, and no
other. If he do mean any other, yet does he not describe the office of that
Senior, neither gives any precept of his continuance, or rule of any such kind
of ^me^nt: and therefore cannot be included in that precept which you so greatly
amplify: for the words of the Apostle be these, vt serves hoc praeceptum, so
that you have labored much to prove a thing that is not, and therefore you
have labored in vain. Secondly, The whole epistle to (...). ^. ^s not that
commandment.
you cannot extend these words of the Apostle to the whole Epistle, as though
it were given generally of the whole, and of every thing therein contein^d: for
then must you of necessity bring in widows and their office into the
Church again: because the Apostle does not only describe their office in that
epistle, but also gives direct precepts of them, and so does he not of your
Seniors. Likewise his precepte of drinking wine, which he gives there also,
must of necessity be observed of all ministers, which have the like
infirmity. These and such other gross absurdities must of necessity
follow, if you will have all things in that Epistle necessarily for ever to be
observed, and the whole epistle to be that commandment, that the Apostle here
enioyneth to Timothy. cap. 6.

Neither can I perceive that any learned interpreter does refer this
commandment Whereunto that commandment is referred.
to any other things contained in this Epistle, than to those only that do
appertain to the pastoral office of Timothy: and some there be, that
restrain it to those things only which are before spoken of in this. 6.
chapter, and especially to ye precept against covetousness. Chrysostom
expounding this place says thus: What is it to keep the commandment pure?
Vt neque vitae, neque dogmatu^ gratia aliquid maculae contra^as, Chrysostom.
Calvin.
That neither in respect of life or doctrine thou have any spot. To conclude M.
Calvin interpreting it, says on this sort: By this word commandment, he
signifies those things which he had hitherto spoken of the office of
Timothy: whereof this is the sum, that he should show himself a faithful
minister to Christ and to the church. For what need is there to exte^d this to
the whole law? except peradventure some m^ had rather to take this simplye for
the function committed unto him: for when we are appointed ministers of the
church, God does therewith prescribe unto us what he would have us to do. So
that seruare mandatum, to keep the commandment is nothing else, but
faithfully to execute the office committed unto him: surely I do wholly refer
it to the ministry of Timothy. Whereby it is evident, that under this
commandment every thing in this epistle is not contained, but yt only which
does appertain to ye office of Timothy. That which follows ( immaculatus and
irreprehensibilis) according to the most and best interpreters, is referred to
Timothy, and not to the commandment, contrary to your judgment: wherefore I
also conclude, that nothing in this Epistle makes one jot for your Seigniorie.

So that we have not only now the (...) of al ye primi^iue churches (which
ought to move us if there were no commandment) but we have also a straight
commandment, I say the only examples ought to move us, for what way can we
s^felyer follow tha^ ye common high way, beaten and trode^ by ^ steps of al ye
Apostles, and of all the churches? Things also grounded, and being preserved by
the same means by the which they were engendered, why should we think but yt
the churches now will prosper by ye government, whereby it first came up? But I
say we have not only the examples of the churches, but we have also
commandment and straight charge to keep this office of elders and ancients in
the church, and therefore it is not only rashness in leaving the way that the
aposties, and churches by the apostles advise have gone, but disobedience also
to depart from their commandment, and to mainteyn and defend that we may do
so, I can almost give it no gentler name than rebellion.

Io. Whitgifte.
Examples of churches there may be some, but not of your kind of Seniors.
Precept and commandment for this kind of government, there is not one in ye
whole scripture, or any other approved authority. For I have before showed how
little y^ authority serue^h your purpose, y^ which you would have us think to
be so express a commandment. Wherefore it is no rebellion to disallow of your
order in the time of Christian magistrates, but it is rebellion to contend for
it, to the abridging of that authority that God has to Christian Princes
committed.

Chap. 2. the seventh Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 114. Sect. 2. etc.
I know yt in the primitive church they had in every church certain Seniors, to
whom the gouernmente of the congregation was committed, but that was before
there was any Christian Prince or magistrate that openly professed the Gospel,
and before there was any Church by public authority established, or under
Civil government: I told you before, that the diversity of time and state ^*
of the church requires diversity of government in the same. It can not be
governed in time of prosperity, as it is in time of persecution: It may not be
governed under a Christian Prince, which does nourishe and maynteyne it, as it
may be under a Tyrant, when it is constrained to (...) and seek corners. It
can not be governed in a w^ole realm, as it may be in one little city or
town: it cannot be governed when it is dispersed through many places, as it
may be when it is collected into some one narow and certain place: To be
short, it can not be governed when it is full of hypocrites, Papists, Atheis^s,
and other wicked persons, as when it has very few or none such: as commonly
it has not in time of persecution, when the gold is as it were by fire tried
from the dross. He that according to this diversity of the form, state, and
time of the church, does not allow a diversity of government, does confound
and not edify. I pray you what Seniors could you have in most parishes in
England fit for that office? But wise, not wilful men, have to consider this:
God has given the chief government of his church, to the christian magistrate,
who has to consider what is most convenient: and we must therewith be content,
so that nothing be done against faith, and the commandment of God.

TC. Page 142. Sect. 1.
Now I will come to M. Doctors reasons which he has in the hundredth and
fourteen, and a hundred and fiftene pages, where he grants that there were
elders in every Church in times past, but says that it ought not now so to
be. For says he, the times alter the government, and it cannot be governed in
the time of prosperity, as in the time of persecution, under a christian
prince as under a tyrant. Thus he says, but shows no reason, brings no
proof, declares not how^ nor why prosperity will not bear the elders, as
well as persecution, neither why they may not be under a godly prince as well
as under a tyrant, v^lesse this be a reason, that because the godly prince
does nourish the church as a civil Magistrate, therefore the Ancients may not
nourishe it as ecclesiastical overseers

Io. Whitgifte.
My reason why it may not be governed under a Christian Prince, as it may The
Church may no^ be governed under ^ (...) stian Prince as (...) a tyrant.
under a tyrant, is this: God has given the chief authority in the
gouernmente of his church to the Christian magistrate, which could not so be if
your Seignorie might as well retein their authority under a Christian Prince,
and in the time of peace, as under a tyrant, and in the time of persecution.
For tell me I pray you what authority ecclesiastical remains to the civil
Magistrate, where this Seignorie is established? But that the Reader may
understand this not to be my judgment alone, but the judgment also of famous
learned men, and the practice of w^ll reformed churches. I thought good in this
place before I proceed any further, to report the opinions of Musculus and
Gualter, touching this matter. Musculus in his common places, titulo de
Magistratibus, affirms, that notwithstanding in the (...) time, the Musculus.
churches were ruled by Seniors, yet they may not so be under christian rulers
and Magistrates, who have authority not in civil matters only, but in
ecclesiastical also. His words I have recited before. M. Gualter in his
commentaries upon. 1. Cor. 5. Supra in the 4. division. ^
does at large entreat of this matter: whose words because they have pith in
them, and proceed from him which is both learned and godly, and of great
experience, I will reher^e them as I find them.

There are also others which although they have true christian princes, and
want no laws whereby licentious manners are corrected, yet they say they need an
ecclesiastical senate, Gualter. in. 1. Cor. 5.
which might punish every man, and have authority also over Princes, that it
might seclude them fr^ the Lords supper (if they have given any public
offense) and not to admit them again unto the fellowship of the Church, but
upon their allowa^ce after public satisfaction. And if any man do contrary
them in their opinion, by and by they cry out upon him as the enemy of all
discipline, and as one unworthy to have any place in the Church: as though
there could no other form of discipline be appointed, but that which they
have invented. But they must pardone us, and let them not condemn us rashly,
which do dissent from them not without good reason. You see therefore how your
Seigniorie and kind of gouernmente is liked, even of zealous and godly
ministers of reformed churches. Neither do I remember that I ever read any
authoure that does of necessity require it: scripture (I know) you have none
for it.

Chap. 2. the. 8. Division.
T. C. Page 142 Sect. 2.
Now seeing M. Doctor can show us no cause why they may not as well be now, as
in the time of the Apostles, as well under a Christian prince ^s under a
Tyrant, I will show him that although they be always necessary, yet there is
better cause why they should rather be now, than in the Apostles times, greater
necessity under a Christian prince, than under a tyrant. First of all in the
Apostles times it is known that the gifts of the spirit of wisdom,
discretion, knowledge, enduring of travail, were poured forth more
plentifully, then ever they were either before, or shall be after. By reason
whereof, the Pastors and ministers of the churches that were then, were (I
speak generally, and of the estate of the whole Church) better furnished with
the gifts needful for their ministry, than are the ministers of these days.
Whereupon I conclude that if the aid and assistance of the Pastor, by the
Elders, was thought necessary by the Apostles in those times, when the
ministers were so well, and so richly replenished with such gifts, much more is
that aid and assistance meet for the ministers of these days, wherein their
gifts of discretion, and knowledge, and diligence are not so plentiful. For if
they whose eye sight was so clear to perceive, whose hands so nimble to
execute, had need for their aid, of other eyes and other hands, then the
ministers now, whose eyes are dimmer, and hands heavier than theirs were, have
much more need of this aid than they had.

Io. Whitgifte.
This reason is answered two ways, and that briefly: The first is, because
there is not at this time in every congregation so meet men, for that office
of Seniors, as there was then: for God has not now so plentifully poured the
gifts of the spirit of wisdom, discretion, knowledge. etc. upon so many in
every congregation according to your own confession, as he did then: and
therefore nothing so easy to fiad in every congregation meet men to govern*
a^ it was then. Secondly, the civil and Christian The civil ma gistrate a
better help to the minister, than the Seniors.
Magistrate has that whole authoritts now, that Seniors had the^, and much
more, for he may punish with corporal punishment, and so could not they: he
may compel and coustrayne, and so could not they: so that the Pastor may be
much better aided and assisted in doing his duty, and in suppressing vice by
the authority of the Christian Magistrate, than he either was then or could be
now by the Seniors. Therefore this reason of yours is no reason at all, but
makes directly against you, if it be well considered.

Chap. 2. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page 142. Sect. 3. 4.
Again if S. Paul did charge the persecuted, and therefore poor churches,
with the finding and providing for the Seniors in every Church (as it appears
in yt Epistle to Timothy, where 1. Epistle. 5.
he says that Elders which rule well, are worthy double honor, whereby he
signifies a plentiful reward, and such as may be fully sufficient for them
and their households, as when he bids that the widow which served the Church
in attending upon the sick, and upon the strangers, should be honored, that
is, have that wherewith she might honestly and soberly live) if I say S. Paul
would charge the churches then with mainteyning the Elders, which being poor,
were The question is not of the abilirie to find Seni ors, but of the
necesti^ie of ha^ing them.
not sometimes able to live without some relief from the Church, because they
were compelled oftentimes to leave their own affairs to wait of the affairs
of the Church, how much more ought there now to be Seniors, when the churches
be in peace, and therefore not so poor, and when there may be chosen such for
the most part throughout the real^e, as are able to live without charging the
Church any whit, as the practice of these days does manifestly declare.

And if S. Paul that was so desirous to have the Gospel (...), that is free
and without charges as much as is possible, and soloth to lay any burden upon
the churches, especially those which were poor, did notwithstanding enjoin
the maintenance of the Elders, unto the churches poor and persecuted, how much
more shall we think, that his mind was that the churches which live in peace,
and are rich, and may have this office without charge, ought to receive this
order of ancients.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is a poor and feeble reason: the Church found Seniors in the time of
persecution, Ergo, there ought rather to be Seniors under a Christian prince
than in the time of persecution. Or this: the Church is now better able to
find Seniors, Ergo, it ought now rather to be governed by Seniors. You may
make the same reasons also for wydowes and diaconisses, and as well induce the
necessity of them. But we ask not what the Church was able to do then, or
what it is able to do now, but whether the same government ought to be now that
was then: and whether a Christian magistrate have no more authority in the
government of ye Church now, than the heathenish and persecuting magistrate had
then. Although if you consider the ability of some Parishes, and the
unwillingness of other some, you shall find that they be hardly able or
willing to find a fit Pastor, much less would they be able or willing to
find a number of Seniors besides their Pastor.

The place of S. Paul 1. Tim. 5. is untruly alleged for your purpose, for the
Apostle means of the Minister in every congregation, and not of any number of
Seniors, as I have before declared. Neither have yon one place of Scripture to
warrant your interpretation, or application of that place.

God has much better provided for his church, by placing in it civil and
Christian God has provided better for his church by giuyng chri stian
magistrates, then by Seniors.
magistrates, whose authority is so ample and large, than by placing Seniors:
wherefore where Christian magistrates be, the government of Seniors is
superfluous, and the Church may not be burdened with unnecessary and
unprofitable charges: neither may the authority which God has given to the
Christian magistrate, be writhen out of his hand, by a rude company of Seniors
in several parishes.

Chap. 2. the tenth Division.
T. C. Page 142. the last line. etc.
Moreover those that belearned know, that the government of the Church which
was in the Apostles times, being partly in respect of the people that had to do
in the elections and other things popular: partly in respect of the Pastors and
Ancients Aristocratical, that is the rule of the best: I say they know that
these gouernmentes do easyly decline into their contraries, and by reason
thereof both the government of those which were most virtuous might easily be
changed into the government of few of the richest, or of greatest power, and
the popular estate might easily pass to a confused tumult. Now this
inco^moditie were they more subject unto under a tyrant, than under a godly
prince. For they had no civil magistrate, which might correct and reform
those declinings when they happened. For the tyrants did not know of it, and if
they have known of it, they would have been glad to see the churches go to
wrack: therefore now we have a godly civil magistrate which both will and
ought to remedy such declinations and conuersions of good government into
evil, it follows that this estate and government by Ancients, is rather to
be used under a Christian prince than under a tyrant.

Io. Whitgifte.
Those that be learned know, that the government of the church is neither
populare, nor The government of the church monar chicall.
Aristocratical* (as it is before declared where you have affirmed the like)
but a Monarchy. For in every particular church where there is a christian
Magistrate, he is chief and principal over the rest: and you your self
confess, that the Pastor is the chief of the Seigniorie, which ought not to
be if the state were either Popular, or Aristocraticall. Of the universal
church only Christ is the head and chief, and therefore the state of it is
Monarchical. But of the state and kind of gouernmente of Tract. 8.
the church in every kingdom or province, I have particularly, and at large
spoken in the treatise of Archbishops.

I shall not need to will the Reader once again to mark how you bend your
force against a Monarchy. For your principle is, that the government of the
common wealth C. T. bends his force against a monarchy.
must be framed according to the government of the church: And therefore it
may not be a kingdom, but rather a Popular estate, or Aristocraticall,
because the government of the Church (as you say) is so. But be it as you
would have it: what then? Forsooth it may easylyer decline from a popular
estate to a confused tumulte, and from an Aristocratical state to the
gouernmente of a few, when there is no Christian Magistrate, than when there
is a Christian magistrate, therefore it is more meet for the gouernmente of
the Church, to be populare or Aristocraticall under a Christian Magistrate,
than under a tyrant. First, I deny your argument as being void of all sense
and reason. Secondly, I say that no Christian Magistrate is bound to suffer in
his dominion, so many several and distinct kinds of government: and to have
one kind of government in the Church, and an other in the common wealth,
seeing that God has committed the chief care of them both to one and the self
same person. Thirdly, I deny your antecedent: that is, that a popular or
Aristocraticall qinde of gouernyng the church does more easyly decline into
their contaries under a tyrant than under a Christian magistrate: for men being
in persecution, and in daily expectation of death, are not so desirous to
procure unto themselves authority and dominion, as they be in the time of
peace and prosperity, Moreover under a tyrant and in the time of persecution,
those that be appointed governors of the Church, be but for a time only, and
during the pleasure of such as appointed them, and therefore can not usurp any
unlawful jurisdiction over the rest against their wills. In such times of the
Church rather disobedience and stubbornness in the common sort, than tyranny
or oppression in the governors, is to be feared. Surely you would feign have
reason for your popular cause, if you could tell where to find it.

And let the Reader note the might of this your reason: the popular and
Aristocratical kind of government may more easyly decline to their contraries
under a tyrant than under a Christian magistrate: therefore ye government of the
church must be popular or Aristocratical rather under a Christian magistrate,
tha^ under a tyrant. Nowsoeuer the antecedent is true, there is no sequel in
the argument. For under a tyrant necessity does drive the Church oftentimes to
one of these two kinds of government, but when there is a Christian
Magistrate, God has appointed it to be subject to him.

Chap. 2. the eleventh Division.
T. C. Page 143. Sect. 1.
Besides this, in the time of persecution all assemblies of diverse together
were dangerous, and put them all in hazard of their life which did make those
assemblies, and therefore if the pastor alone might have ordered and determined
of things perteining to the church by himself, it had been less danger to him,
and more saftie for others of the church. And therefore if the seniors were
then thought mere to govern the church, when they could not come together to
exercise their functions without danger, much more ought they to be under a
Christian prince, when they may mete together without danger.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be the homeliest reasons that ever I heard, and the lightest to be used
in so weighty a matter. For first, the Seniors might as safely meet together
in the time of persecution, to exercise discipline, as the whole church to
hear the word of God and to pray. Secondly, it was not so dangerous for four
or five to meet together. Thirdly, no danger ought to be feared when a man
seeks to do his duty. Fourthly, what kind of reason call you this? the
Seniors may with less danger meet together to execute their fuuctions under a
Christian Prince than under a tyrant: therefore there ought rather to be Seniors
under a Christian prince than under a tyrant. I statly deny the argument. For
under a tyrant the church must have that kind of government, that it may most
conveniently enjoy, with what danger so ever it be joined: under a Christian
Magistrate it must be subject to his authority, and governed by him, seeing
that God has co^mmitted unto him the chief care and government thereof:
Wherefore the office of Seniors is nothing necessary where there is a Christian
magistrate, but it is usurpation rather of the office of the Magistrate, and a
detracting from his authority: neither has God in any place of the
Scriptures commanded obedience to those your Seniors, or described their
office: but he has done both expressly, touching the civil Magistrate.

Chap. 2. the. 12. Division.
T. C. Page 143. Sect. 2.
M. Doctor proceeds and says, it can not be governed in a whole realm, as it
may be in a city or town. This government by Seniors is not only in one
city, but also has bin of late throughout the whole realm of France, where
there were any churches: and M. Doctor confesses, that it was in all the
prinutiue Churches, and therefore not only in one realm, but almost
thoroughout the whole world: and therefore the large spreading of the Church,
can not hinder it. So that the difference lies still in the peace and
persecution of the church, and not in the capacity and largeness of the
place where the churches abide. So might one reason against the lawful
estate of a Monarchy: for he might say that although the rule of one be
needful and conuement in a household, yet it is not convenient in a town, and
although it be convenient in a town, yet it is not in a city, and although in
a city, yet not in a realm.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you will so divide these several cities, and Churches in one kingdom, that
they be not under one gouernoure, ruled by the same laws, members of one
kingdom, but every one of them as it were a common wealth within it self, (as
it is in Scon^ spoil^ (...) of (...).
several Churches within one kingdom in the time of persecution) then it is
true that you say, and in this case were the primitive Churches, and so were
the Churches in France. But when as all the Towns and Churches in one
kingdom, be subject as well in causes Ecclesiastical as civil, to one prince,
ruled by the same laws etc. then can you not establish this your Seigniorie
without great confusion, and intolerable injury to the minister of God: I
mean the Christian Magistrate.

The authority of the Master of the household over his family derogateth
nothing from the authority of the Prince, but does confirm and establish it
rather. But the authority of your Seniors in every congregation, spoyleth the
prince of his Jurisdiction, and makes him subject where he ought to be ruler,
and therefore your reason is not like.

To be short says he, when he can say no more, it cannot be governed when it
is full of hypocrites Papists, Atheists, and other wicked persons, as in the
times of persecution when there were few or none such. I have showed before how
great want of knowledge it bewrays, to say that Papists and Atheists be of
the Church, and I love not as M. Doctor both to use often reperition, but if
there be now more hypocrites and other wicked and unruly persons in the Church,
than there were in the time of persecution (which I will not deny) then there
is greater cause noro why there should be Seniors in every Church, than there
was then when there were fewer. For the more naughty persons, and the greater
disorders there be, the more aid and help has the pastor need to have both
to find out their disorders, and also when they have found them out, to judge
of the quality of them, and after also to correct them with the censutes of
the Church, which stands in such reprehensions private and open, and
excommunication, as I have before rehearsed.

Io. Whitgifte.
What M. Doctor was able to say more, was unknown to you. If he would allege
as vain reasons as you do, and spend paper in uttering his own fancies
without either scripture or other authorities, as your usual manner is, he
would at the least have seemed to say much, as you do, who indeed say nothing
at all.

Church, both Papists, Atheists, drunkards. etc. and your denial of it I have
showed before to be vain. I say surther that those and such like offenders,
may best be reformed by the civil Magistrate, and by corporal punishment: as
for your Seniors they will not set a straw by them. For as M. Gualter says:
They which cannot be brought into order by the authority of a lawful
magistrate, and by laws, will much less suffer themselves to be punished by
the commandment of Seniors, or of an Ecclesiastical senate, whom with all
their solemnity they will laugh to scorn.

Afterward he asks what Seniors may be had in most of the parish in
England fit for that office? he asks the same question in the. 133. page,
where he also adds Pastors, asking where may be gotten such Pastors as the
authors of the Admonition require, when as they require no other than those
which the word of God requires. Well then if this be a good reason why there
should be no Elders in any Church, because fit men are not to be gotten in all
parishes: it follows by M. Doctors reason, that for as much as we have not fit
and able Pastors for every Church, that therefore we ought to have no able
Pastor in any Church.

And if he will grant that we ought to have able Pastors in as many places as
they may be gotten: how can he deny that we should have Elders in those
Churches where fit men may be had.

Io. Whitgifte.
The question is necessary and cannot be so shifted of: But you are still like
unto Difference between the necessity of Pastors and of Seniors.
your self. The reason of having Pastors and of having Seniors is nothing
like: For the office of a Pastor is perpetual, so is not the office of your
Senior. Pastors be necessary in the Church of Christ, as well for the
administration of the sacraments, as for the preaching of the word, and other
Ecelesiasticall functions: so be not Seniors. The office of a Pastor is not
only described in the scriptures, but commanded also: show where the office of
your Senior is so. The office of a Pastor derogateth nothing from the
authority of the Christian Magistrate: but the office of your Seniors spoyleth
him of the one half, and in a manner of the whole, as shall hereafter more
plainly appear. Wherefore this may well be true, that although such Pastors
as are to be wished cannot be provided for every place, yet there must be such
as may be conveniently come by. But the same is not true in Seniors, being
neither necessary, nor (where a Chistian Magistrate is) profitable, but the
contrary.

And these reasons will serve to deny that of Seniors, which we grant of
Pastors, seeing the office of a Pastor is commanded as necessary and
perpetual: and not the office of a Senior.

Chap. 2. the. 15. Division.
T. C. Page 144. Lin. 2.
And I say further, where we have an express commandment laid upon us to do
a thing, there all disputations must cease, of hardness, of impossibility, of
profit, or else of peace. For first God has not commanded any orders in his
Church, which are impossible, and if they seem hard, it must be remembered,
that the best and excellentest things are hardest, and that there is nothing so
hard, which diligence and travail to bring it to pass, will not overcome:
which thing if it be proved true in worldly affairs, the truth thereof will
much more appear in the matters perteyning unto God, considering that if God
with his blessing do surmounte all the difficulties in worldly matters, which
are otherwise hard to be compassed, he will in his own matters and matters
perteyning to his glory, fill up the valleys, although they be never so low,
bring down the hilies, although they be never so high, plain the ways be they
never so rough, so that he will make of a way not passable in the eyes of
flesh, a way tracked and easy to go in, and to walk toward that kingdom,
whereunto he calls us.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words of course to no purpose. For first you should have proved
The office of (...) no (...) com^.
that the office of your Seniors is commanded, which I utterly deny. Then
should you have declared that the same commandment is perpetual: for many
things are commanded in the new testament, which be not perpetnall, as the
washing of feet, John. 13. to abstain a sanguine and suffocat^. Act. 15. to
elect and choose wydowes, to (...). 13. (...). 15. ^. (...). 5.
minister in the Church. 1. Timo. 5. and such like. So that you have craftily
passed over two principal points, and those which ought to be the grounds
of your cause. First therefore I deny that this office of Saeniors is
commanded any where in the new Testamente: then I say that if it were
commanded, yet is it but a tempor ill commandment. Those two points not
being by you proved, the words you utter are but in vain.

Besides that, I answer wheresoever there is a Church, there are the riches
of the spirit of God, there is with knowledge, discretion, and wisdom, and
there are such as S. Paul calls wise and can discern and judge. And we see
that when men are called to a lawful and profyt^ble calling, and especially to
a public calling, God does pour on his gifts of that person which is so
called so plentyfully that he is as it were suddenly made a new man, which if
he dee in the wicked as Saul was, there is no doubt but he will do it in
those which are with the testimony 1. Sam. 10.
of the church, and with experience of their former godly behavior, chosen to
such offices of weight. So that there is not nor can not be any want to obey
Gods commandment, and to establish the order in the Church which God has
appointed, but our own either negligence and slouthfulnes, or fearfulness or
ambition^or some other leaven which we nourishe within our selves.

Io. Whitgifte.
This lacks proose: for sometimes the church of God is, where there is
neither good Pastor, nor meet governor, as in the time of Elias. And though
God somtymes bestow his gifts upon y^ person that is called to a lawful and a
public function as he did upon Saul, yet does he not always so. God does not
of necessity tie his graces to God bestoa weth his gifts by means.
offices: for as he in the beginning of his church miraculously bestowed his
gifts: so does he now leave the same, by outward means in part to be
obtained, as by education, learning, instruction, reading, studying. etc. which
means being neglected, God does of his justice permit evil Magistrates and
officers, which he also sometimes does for the offenses of the people, as may
be seen in the most part of the kings of Judah, and of Jerusalem, and almost
in all christian princes and governors under the Popes tyranny: For I suppose
you mean such gifts as be profitable for the Church.

Surely if this were true that you here so boldly without proof affirm, then
should it not much skill what kind of men were chosen to be either Pastors, or
Magistrates, for howsoever they were before furnished with gifts, yet when they
be once The absurdity of the R^plye.
called, God will miraculously pour upon them gifts necessary, though they be
the rudest and ignorantest men in a whole country. Is not this to boast of the
spirit as the Anabaptists do? but I think the Reader understands, that God
now works by ord^narie means, not by miracles. And though it be certain
that God does endue magistrates, such as fear him with singular gifts, yet
does he it by means as is said, and it is not at all times so, nor in all
persons, but when, where, and in whom it pleases him. Therefore to ground any
general doctrine upon singular examples: or to stablish an external kind of
government upon Gods inward and secret working: to bind God unto that of
necessity, that he does bestow of grace and mercy: to make that common to al,
which he of his infinite wisdom bestows upon some: is not the part of a
skillful divine.

But to let all this pass: you do still petere principium, and take that as
granted, which you cannot prove, that is, that the office of Seniors is an
office established in the Church by the commandment of God, and not to be
altered: which I for my part can never grant unto you, except you have more
pithie reasons to prove it, than any that you have as yet uttered.

Chap. 2. the. 17. Division.
T. C. Page 144. Lin. 26. and. Sect. 1. 2.
It is true, that we ought to be obedient unto the civil magistrate, which
governs the church of God in that office which is committed unto him, and
according to that calling. But it must be remembered, that (...) magistrates
must gouerns it according to the rules of God prescribed in his word, and that
as they are nourises, so they be servants unto the church, and as they rule
in the church, so they must remember to subject themselves unto the church, to
submit their scepters, to throw down their crowns, before the church: yea
as the prophet speaks, to lick Esaias. 49.
the dust of the feet of the church. Wherein I mean not, that the church does
either wring the scepters out of princes hands, or takes their crowns from
their heads, or that it requires princes to lick the dust of her feet (as
the pope under this pretense has done) but I mean as the prophet means,
that what soever magnificence or excellency, or pomp, is either in them, or
in their estates and common wealths, which does not agree with the
simplicity and (in the judgment of the world) poor and contemptible estate
of the Church, that that they will be content to lay down.

And here comes to my mind, that wherewith the world is now dec^iued, and
wherewith M. Doctor goes about both to deceive himself and others too, in
that he thinks that the Church must be framed according to the common wealth,
and the Church government according to the ^uill government, A dangerous
doctrine.
which is as much to say, as if a man should fashion his house according to his
hangings when as indeed it is clean contrary, that as the hangings are made
fit for the house, so the common wealth must be made to agree with the Church,
and the gouernmente thereof with her government. For as the house is before the
hangings, and therefore the hangings which come after, must be framed to the
house which was before: so the Church being before there was ^y common wealth,
and the common wealth coming after, must be fashioned and made suitable unto
the Church. Otherwise God is made to give place to men, heaven to earth, and
religion is made (as it were) a rule of Lesbia, to be applied unto any estate
of common wealth whatsoever. Seeing An obscu^e, and deformed argument.
that good men, that is to say, the Church are as it were the foundation of the
world, it is meet that the common wealth which is builded upon that
foundation, should be framed according to the Church, and therefore those
voices ought not to be heard, this order will not agree with our common wealth,
that law of God is not for our state, this form of government will not match
with the policy of this realm.

Io. Whitgifte.
These words would be well considered, for they contain the overthrow of the
The overthrow of the princes autho ritie contained in the Reply.
princes authority both in ecclesiastical and civil matters. But I will only
give a brief note of them in this place, meaning to set forth this matter
more at large elsewhere. When he says that the civil magistrate must govern
according to his calling, and according to the rules of God prescribed in his
word. etc. although the words be true, ^et if you mark upon what occasion
they be spoken, you shall perceive the venom that lies hid under them: for he
does thereby insinuate, that the civil Magistrate may not intermedle with the
office of the Senior, that is, with ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, for he takes
Seniors to be the officers appointed by God for that purpose: which is to be
reaue the civil Magistrate of his authority, and to give that to Seniors
which the Pope under the like pretense does arrogate unto himself. And
therefore w^ll and truly says M. Gualter in the place before recited. Those
men (meaning such as Gualter.
call for Seniors when they have a Christian Magistrate) do distinguish
between the Ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction in respect of the
punishmente of sins, and the discipline of manners. But this distinction is
taken out of the Popes shop, and in the holy scriptures it is no where to be
found. For there is the same reason of the magistrate in the new Testament,
that was in times past in the old, for so much as Christ has said that he
came not to break the law, but to fulfill it: But in times past the Judges and
kings, had power to punish those that offended, neither did the priests or
prophets thrust themselves into that business, but so far forth as perteyned
to admonitions and reprehensions, which they applied out of the word of God
according to the quality of the offenses: Therefore the same must be observed
in the new Testament, neither is it needful that the ministers of the word
should have a peculiar senate, or that they should challenge unto themselves by
any means those things that belong to the civil Magistrate. M. Gualters
meaning is, that the ministers of the word cannot challenge the authority of
pu^shing vice (otherwise than by admonitions and reprehensions, that is, that
they cannot challenge this kind of government of a Seigniorie) by the word of
God, because all such authority is committed to the civil Magistrate: So that
if Bishops have it, they must have it from him, as it is in this Church of
England. And therefore well says M Gualter in the same place: there may be
appointed such as shall have the correction of manners in such countries where
the ordinary magistrates cannot do all themselves, but those must be appointed
by the magistrate, and do all at his commandment: and not vsurp any distinct
Jurisdiction from the ordinary magistrate.

The second point to be noted is, when he says that Christian princes must
subject The prince made subject to Seniors by the Replyer.
themselves to the Church, submit their scepters, throw down their crowns
before the Church. etc. the which kind of speech, the Pope himself uses,
and under the same pretense has trodden kings under his feet. And although T.
C. seem to mislike this excessive using of authority by the Pope, yet would
be have the same jurisdiction to remain to his Seniors s^il, whom be
understands by the name of the Church, as appears in that which he spoke
before of these words of Christ Dic Ecclesiae: so Page 140. in the latter end.
that he would have the Prince, subject her self to the Seniors of the
Church, and throw down her crown before them, that is, to be con^ent to be
ruled and governed, to be punished and corrected, to be excommunicated and
absolved by their discretion, and at their pleasure. This no doubt is his
meaning, neither can it otherwise be: for if this kind of government be once
admitted, the Prince must needs be of some peculiar Church and congregation,
and therefore subject to the Seigniorie of that Church, except it please
master Pastor (who is the chief) and the rest of his neighbors the
parishioners, to elect the Prince into the Seigniorie, and make him one of
them: and yet must the Pastor be his superior, and have authority to call him
to consultations, and to direct him in matters of discipline, and whether he
will or no he must be ordered and ruled by the Pastor and most part of the
Seniors. And yet now I remember my self, the Prince cannot be of the
Seigniorie, for T. C. al^ttle Pa. 146. sect. 1.
after grau^teth that his Seniors be no lay men but Ecclesiastic^ll: so that
indeed the Prince must be a servant no master a subject no Prince, under
government no gouernoure in matters perteyning to the Church.

And least any man should think that this is but my collection, (though it be
most Gualter.
true, and I will justify it so to be) I have she wed before that which M.
Gualter affirms upon the. 1. Cor. 5. as he also does upon the. 12. Chapter of
the same Epistle saying, there be some which according to the example of the
old and primitive Church would have Seniors, and an Ecclesiastical senate, that
should have authority over magistrates, if they at any time do not their duty.
And in deed this is one of the chief causes why our men would so gladly have
a Seigniorie: for they would gladly be in hand with magistrates to make them
stoop and bow down unto them.

The third point is in this, that he would have, the government of the common
wealth The Replyer seeks the ^uerthrow of monarchtes.
and the common wealth it self, framed to the Church, and the gouernmente
thereof, as the hangings are made fit for the house, whereby as it may seem he
would have all monarchies overthrown and reduced either to a popular or an
Aristocraticall estate: for these two kinds of government he only allows of,
in the Church, as it appears by that which he has thereof oltener than once
or twice spoken before.

Now the laws of man will bear this, I know not, but I am well assured the
Christ and the Gospel ^o enin^les so (...).
law of God will not suffer it. For Christ came not to overthrow kinds of
government, and civil policy, neither does the Gospel dissolve kingdoms,
for S. Peter says. 1. Epist. 2. Proinde subditiestote cuiuis ordinationi
^umanae propter dominum, sieve Reg 1. 1. Pet. 2.
etc. Submit yourselues unto all manner ordinance of man for the Lords sake,
whether it be unto the king, as to the superior. And so Paul. 1. Tim. 2. to
the exhort him to pray for 1. Timo. 2.
kings, which he would not have done if the state of a kingdom could not agree
with the state of the Church.

But I will not amplify this matter. Let such consider of it, to whom it does
specially perteine. This is your reason to prove that the gouernmente of the
common wealth, ought to be framed according to the gouernmente of the Church:
because there was a Church before there was a common wealth: but I deny the
argument: and your similitude (of house and hangings) does not prove it. All
the Examples in the Scripture of common wealths, being also the Churches of
God, declare the contrary, neither can you she we any state altered in this
manner, but only among the Anabaptists.

Of like weyghtis your other reason, which is this: Good men, that is the
Church, are as it were the foundation of the world, the common wealth is
builded upon that foundation, therefore the gouernmente of the common wealth
must be framed according to the gouernmente of the Church. This gere is to
subtle for every body to understand: but the argument is without all fashion,
and it is neither true in matter nor form. For how pr^e y^u that good men
are the foundation of the world? The first men were grievous
transgressoures, the most of them. The evil men in multitude and worldely
prosperity, have from time to time in the world ouergrowen them. Moreover,
the Church visible conteyneth both good and badde: and so does the common
wealth, and therefore it can not be said to be builded of good men more than
of evil men. To conclude, if all this were true, yet does not the argument
follow. For the foundation gives strength, but it gives not the whole form
or fashion to that which is builded upon it. For a man may make alterations
in his house, though he do not once move or stir the foundation. And surely
howesoeuer you will dally off these Collections upon your manifest words,
similitudes, and reasons, with some devised interpretation and shifte (for it
will stand you in hand so to do) yet what occasion you have given thereby to
the common people, and other that be contentious, to mislyke of this present
state and gouernmente, wise men can consider. And to tell you plain, except
you have some mystical sense in them, (which I can not conceive) I see not
how they can stand with your alleagiance. I speak of the words as you have
uttered them: I will not enter into the depth of your meaning: And I will hope
the best until I understand further of your mind.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 133. Lin. 1.
Neither is there any authority in the whole Bible, that enforces or
prescribes that kind of government as necessary or convenient for all times:
no more than there is to prove that in the Church there must be always such as
have power to work miracles, or that have the gift of healing and such like:
which offices notwithstanding are mentioned as well as governors in the first
to the Cor. 12.

T. C. Page 144. Sect. vlt.
Now to come again to M. Doctors reasons, he says in the. 133. page, that if
they urge governors because they are spoken of in the. 1^. to the Cor. then
they may as well urge the power ^o work miracles, the gift of healing. etc. for
that they are likewise reckned up in the same place. But does not M. Doccor
know, that although some things be extraordinary, and for a time, yet other
some things are ordinary and to endure always? will he say for that the gifts
of miracles and of healing are extraordinary, therefore the teachers which are
there reckned together with the gift of working miracles and of healing are
extraordinary? has he forgotten that he (in deed untruly) made before the
office of Apostles and prophets and evangelists, a perpetual office, and yet
they are there joined with these gifts which were but for a time, and therefore
it is a very absurd argument to say, that for that some thing reckened with
governors, is for a time, and extraordinary, therefore the governors also be
so.

Io. Whitgifte.
And how prove you, that the office of Seniors is more ordinary, or of longer
continuance than the office of Apostles, Prophets, the power of working
miracles, and of healing, which be in that place recited as well as those
governors be, whom you call Seniors? You ought to have proved the office of
Seniors to be perpetual: for that I deny and show my reason, that it can not
be proved out of that place because other offices mentioned in that place to
the Corinthians be temporal. But this being most material, you pass it
over, because you are not able to prove it. I hane told you before in what
sense there may be both Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists. And if I can not
necessarily conclude, yt the office of Seniors is temporal, because it is
rehearsed among those offices and gifts yt be temporal, much less can you
conclude that it is perpetual, the most of the offices and gifts with it
expressed, being temporal.

Well says Musculus in his common places, tit. de Magist. Si reuocas temporum

T. C. Page. 145. Lin. 11.
As for Musculus authority, which is, that the times do change the orders,
besides that I have answered before, and besides that he does not speak it of
the Elders, I have proved that it can have no place here, for so much as the
Elders are necessary, and commanded in the scripture.

Io. Whitgifte.
Musculus in that place speaks of the government of the Church, and of the
authority of the civil Magistrate in matters ecclesiastical: And proves
that the government of the Church may not be now, as it was in the Apostles
time.

And a little before speaking of the Seigniorie, he affirms as much, as it
appears in his words before recited. You have not as yet proved, either the
office of Seniors now to be necessary, or the same to be commanded in the
Scripture.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 133. in the midst.
You say it is more easy for the wicked by bribing to pervert and corrupt one
man, than to pervert and overthrow the faith and piety of a zealous and godly
company: and therefore better the government of the Church to be committed to
many, than to one. If this Retortion (...) absurdi^*
reason be good, then the more there be that rule, the better is the
government, and so popularis status erit optimus reipublicae status: against
all both divinity and Philosophy: for we see that God him self in his common
weal of Israel, did always allow the government and superiority of one
over the rest, both in the time of Judges, and after in the time of the Kings.
And in the new Testament we may also see that kind of government most allowed
of. 1. Pet. 2. But I will not here reason with you in this matter, and call
that into question, which has bin by so many learned men determined, and by
the examples of all good commonweals confirmed.

T. C. Page 145. Sect. 1.
Unto the Authors of ye Admonition, saying yt it is easier to overthrow by
bribing one man, than the faith and piety of a godly company, he answers,
that so it should come to pass, that the more yt ruled the better estate it
should be, and so the popular estate should be the best. But where do the
authors of the Admonition say, that the more that rule, the better it is? Is it
all one to say, that the government of a few of the best is better than the
government of one, and to say, the more that rule the better? If it were to
the purpose, it might be showed both by Divinity and by Philosophy, which M.
Doctor speaks of, that that estate which he means is not the best, and I
have in a word before spoken of, where I declared that the mixed estate is
best, both by the example of the kingdom of Christ, and also of this our
realm.

Io. Whitgifte.
But if this be a g^od reason against the rule and government of one, that the
Admonition uses, then the more that rule the better it is, and this is all that
I charge the^ with. Whereunto you answer not one word, but dally off the
matter, by asking where do the authors of the Admonition say, that the more that
rule the better it is. I might dally with you in like manner, and say: where
does any man charge them with so saying? yet does the same necessarily follow
upon their reason. They say not, the government of a few of the best, but of a
company: which signifies many: and why should not this argument be good? if
the government of a few godly men be better than the government of one,
because one is easier overthrown by bribing than more, then is also the
government of many godly men, better than the government of a few, because a
few may sooner be corrupted than many: and consequently by the same reason, the
more that govern the better. This reason you have glaunced by, and not touched:
and yet it enforces a manifest absurdity, against the Authors of the
Admonition. For it is too absurd to say that a Popular estate is the best
state: neither will any affirm it, but those which would be Popular.

You are never able to show either by Divinity or Philosophy, that there are
more There are no more lawful kinds of government than three.
lawful kinds of government than three: that is, Democraticall,
Aristocratical, and Monarchical, and of these, both the Scripture and
Philosophy allows of the Monarchy, as simply the best.

The government of this kingdom is a right and true Monarchy. Neither do you

know what a Monarchy is, when you call it a mixed estate: for that is called a
Monarchy, where the chief care and government of the common wealth is
committed to one, as it is in this kingdom in every respect.

Chap. 2. the. 21. Division.
T. C. Page 145. Sect. 1.
It is sufficient now to admonish you, that although it be granted that the
government of (...) be the best in the common wealth, yet it can not be in the
Church: for the Prince may well be Monarche immediately between God and the
common wealth, but no man can be Monarch between God and his Church but
Christ, which is the only head thereof. Therefore the Monarchy over the whole
Church and over every particular Church, and over every singular member in the
Church, is in Christ alone.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you mean of the universal Church, only Christ is the head, neither has
he Christ the only head of his universal church.
any Uicegerent to supply that universal care over the whole Church. But if
you speak of particular Churches, as the Church of England, the Church of
Denmark. etc. then as the Prince is chief governor and head of the common
wealth The Prince head of a particular church
under God, so is he of the Church likewise. For it is certain that the
christian Magistrate under Christ, has as great authority, as the Magistrate
had under ye law: But then the civil Magistrates had chief authority both
in matters of the common wealth, and of the Church also (as hereafter it
shall more plainly appear) therefore the Magistrate ought to have the same
now in like manner. T. C. does but T. C. glaunceth at the magistrate.
glaunce at the Magistrate, because he dare not speak plainly: but such
licentious speeches (though void of all reason and ground) may peradventure
sink deeper into the heart of the subjects, especially of the Papist (who
has already conceived the same opinion of the civil Magistrate) than will be
rooted out in short time: so careful are these men in procuring to the Prince
due obedience, and so faithful are they in maynteyning her authority,
according to their oath and duty.

Both the names and offices of Seniors were extinguished before Ambrose time,

In deed as Ambrose says, writing upon the fyfth of the first to Timothy,
The Synagogue, and after, the Church had Seniors, without whose counsel
nothing was done in the Church, but that was before his time, and before
there was any christian Magistrates, or any Church established.

Last of al Untrue, for it is not alleged for that (...)
to prove that there ought to be no Seniors in the church under a christian
Prince, he cites Ambrose authority both in the. 114. and. 132. pages, which
says that the Synagogue or Church of the Jews, and after that the Church of
the Christians had Seniors, without whose counsel nothing was done in the
Church: whereupon he concludes, that for as much as they were not in Ambrose
time, therefore they were not under a christian Prince.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is most untrue. I allege not Ambrose in either of those places to prove
that Seniors ought not to be under a christian Prince, as the Reader may
understand evidently by my words. Only I confess that there was Seniors, and
I allege Ambrose partly for that purpose, partly to show that both their
names and offices were extinguished before his time: no man living can gather
any other sense out of my words. Wherefore that conclusion upon Ambrose words
is yours, it is not mine: and I am sorry that malice has thrown you so deep
into ye pit of untruth, that you can not be gotten out of it. No cloak or
shadow can cover this deformity of yours.

And here M. Doctor has in one sentence proclaimed both his great ignorance
in the whole story of the Church, and withal cyther a marvelous abusion, and
(...) him self to be mislead by some unadvised, prompter, or subtle fox,
that thought to deceive him, or else a notable cuill conscience, which
wrastleth against the truth. His ignorance does appear, partly in that he
sayththat because there were no Seniors in Ambrose Church, and in those
Churches about him, therefore there was none at all: but most manifestly in
that he says, for so much as there were no Seniors in Ambrose time, therefore
there was none under a christian Prince, as though there were not many years
before Ambrose time christian Emperors, when as between the time of S.
Ambrose being Bishop, and the time of Philip, the son of Gordias the first
christian Emperor, there is more than. 150. years, and between the time of
Constantine the Emperor, and the time of Ambrose being Bishop, there be
above. 80. years. And if M. Doctor had ever read the Ecclesiastical stories,
he might have An untruth, else name your stories.
found easily the Eldership most flourishing in Constantines time, and other
times, when as the peace of the Christians was greatest.

Io. Whitgifte.
Except it were to set forth your own knowledge, and to leave a public
testimony of your great humility and modesty, you would not so immodestly
accuse M. Doctor of ignorance, though you had co^uinced him of it, as you
neither have done, nor are able to do^, in that that he professes. Likewise
except your self used prompters, and patched your book with other men's
collectio^s, you would never so often charge me with ye same.

I did not say, as I told you before, that because there was no Seniors in
Ambrose time, therefore there was none under a christian Prince, but this I say,
that ye Seniors which Ambrose speaks of, were extinguished before Ambrose
time, and were not in the time of christian Princes.

To what purpose do you account y^ time betwixt Philip and Ambrose, or
Constantine and Ambrose? you should rather prove that this kind of government
by Seniors was in Philips dominion, if he were christened (which may be
doubted) or under Constantinus.

You say, if I had ever read the ecclesiastical stories, I might have found
easily the Eldership most flourishing in Constantinus time, and other times,
when as the peace of the Christians was greatest. You have read the
Ecclesiastical stories, how chance that you show it not. It is your part to
prove: you hold the affirmative. Bring forth one Ecclesiastical history that
affirms this kind of government to have bin under Constantinus. You might at
the least have quoted the Author (with the book and chapter) that so says,
though you had disdayned to set down his words. I deny not but it might be
so in some time, and in some place under a christian Prince (and yet I know not
how you will be able to prove it) but that is not the question. For our
contention is, whether this kind of government ought of necessity to be under
a christian Prince, or not, and whether it be convenient so to be, though it be
not necessary, and not whether it has bin (which notwithstanding can not be
proved) or may be.

And that the Presbytery or Eldership endured in the Church after Ambrose
time, and in the time of peace, and as it is very like in Ambrose time,
although not where he was, it may be showed 4. Tom. 2. lib. in Isaia^.
plainly by Hierome (which followed Ambrose immediately) who in his third
chapter upon I say It is in the. 5. tom. not in the. 4
says, that they had also the Presbytery or Eldership in the church.

Io. Whitgifte.
Jerome speaks not one word of your Presbytery, his words be these: Et nos
habemus Hier. 2. lib. in Isaiam.
in ecclesia senatu^ nostru^, coetu^ presbyteroru^: And we have in the Church
our Senate, a company of Elders. Which he means of Priests, and of Colleges
of Cathedral Churches, that were then in every city, and not of a Seigniorie
in every congregation, whereby What Presbytery Iero^ means.
every several parish was governed. That this was Ieromes meaning, it
appears in the same place upon these words, Hariolum and senem, where he
interprets the word Presbyter, says they be such as S. Paul describes in
his Epistle to Tim. and those be ministers of the word and sacraments. So may
we say that we have senatum and coetum presbyterorum in this Church of England,
whether you will mean it of Synodes and conuocations, or of Cathedral and
Collegiate Churches, which consist ex coetu presbyteroru^: of a company of
ministers. And therefore Duarenus a learned writer speaking Duarenus.
of this Seigniorie, says thus: And it is to be noted that there was a
certain College of those Elders (he means Priests, as it is evident in that
which goes before) in every city, over whom the Bishop had rule, such as is
at this day the College of Canons, which seem to have succeeded into their
place. And this company of Priests does Jerome call the senate of the Church.

This Senate consists of Priests: yours of me^ in no degree of the
ministry: This Difference betwixt Ieroms presbytery* and that the Replyer
would establishe.
Senate was only in every city, and the Bishop was the chief, yours must be
in every parish, and directed by ye Pastor. We read not of any such
jurisdiction that this Senate had over any, but over the Clergy, yours must
have authority both over clergy and laytie: wherefore this place of Jerome
does not help you one whit. But be it that this Seigniorie was ye same that
you mean of, and that it was in Ieromes church, yet for as much as it was not
in Ambrose his church also, it manifestly appears to be a thing indifferent,
and not of necessity to be urged.

The same might be showed by diverse other testimonies, which I omit, because
that it may appear by the former treatise touching the election of the
minister, that this order of Eldership continued in the Church diverse hundred
years after Ambrose time, even as long almost as there was any sound part of
the church, from the head to the heel.

Io. Whitgifte.
But seeing that you have hitherto brought forth so few testimonies, scil. one
only, and that to small purpose, it had bin well if you had not passed the rest
over so lightly. For it is soon said, that diverse other testimonies might
have bin showed: but it had bin much for your credit if you had recited but
one (...), that we might at the least have had two witnesses, but in deed you
are not able. In your treatise of the election of ministers no such thing
appears, except you will have whole parishes of the Seigniorie, and the same
to be without a Pastor, who should be the guide. For parishes do not usually
choose their Pastor until they be destitute. Neither is there any mention made
by you, or proof in that treatise, that there was a Seigniorie in every
parish, to whom the election was committed, and therefore you do but speak
this, pro forma tantum.

Chap. 2. the. 26. Division.

Now I have showed the ignorance, it remains to show how that either M.
Doctor was maruellously himself abused, or else desires to abuse either. For if
where as he took half Ambrose sentence, he had taken the other half with
him, and had not suddenly stopped his breath, that he should speak no more, in
stead of a false witness against the Eldership, he should have brought forth
as clear and as ^lat a witness for the proof of them, as a man could desire
out of an ancient writer. The whole sentence is this speaking of this office
of Elders (although not upon so good occasion) Ambrose upon. 1. Ti. cap. 5.
thus he says: Whereupon the Synagogue, and after the Church had Elders,
without whose council nothing was done in the Church, which Elders I know not
by what negligence they are worn out, unless it be through the slothfulness
of the Doctors, or rather through their pride, whylest they only would seem
to be somewhat.

Io. Whitgifte.
But if you be not able to allege one place to prove that your seigniorie was
in the time of christian Princes, except only that place of Hieronie, M.
Doctors ignorance is not so great, especially seeing that Ambrose, Hieronis
ancient denies the same to have bin in his time. But if having one only
testimony, and that making nothing for your purpose, but against you rather
(because it establishes Collegiate Churches, which you would gladly throw
down) then M. Doctors knowledge in this matter, is more than you can with all
your lofty speeches and immodest words obscure.

I have alleged so much of Ambrose faithfully and truly, as proves that
which I allege him for: Neither have I left out one word that makes against
that my purpose: for if you remember your self, you can not but see and
understand that I only allege Ambrose to prove, that there was sometime a
Seigniorie, but yet dissolved and abrogated before his time. If that which
follows in Ambrose disprove this, then in deed you may say, that either I am
abused, or desire to abuse other. But if it nothing derogate from my intent and
purpose, then why do you falsely charge me, or why pick you a quarrel against me
for omitting that which neither does me harm nor good. Disprove any thing by
any words of Ambrose that I have alleged Ambrose for, if you can: if you can
not, then temper your immoderate speeches, and frame them according to the
truth.

If Ambrose so misliked ye abrogating of this Seigniorie, why did he not labor
to restore it again: surely if it had bin a matter so necessary, he being so
godly and zealous a Bishop, would never have suffered his Church to be spoiled
of it, but it is evident by his words that it had not bin in practice long time
before.

Now that I have showed the place, I will say no more, I will leave it to M.
Doctor to think of it in his chamber by himself, and so will conclude this
question: that for so much as this order is such, as without which the
principal offices of charity can not be exercised, and that which is
commanded by the scriptures, approved and received by all the Churches in the
Apostles times, and many hundred years after in the most flourishing churches,
both in time of peace, and in time of persecution, and that there are greater
causes why it should be in the time of peace, than in time of persecution, why
rather under a christian prince, than under a tyrant, why rather now, than in
the Apostles times, that in consideration of these things the Eldership is
necessary, and such an order as the Church ought not be without.

Io. Whitgifte.
It forces not greatly whether you say any more of it, or no: for as it
nothing hinders my purpose, so wins it no credit unto yours. And for
as much as the Church may much better be governed, and the principal offices
of charity much better exercised, by the civil Magistrate, than by these
Seniors: and seeing that this kind of government is neither commanded in the
scriptures, nor practiced in the Church as a kind of government not to be
altered, seeing also that it brings in confusion, derogateth from that
authority that God has given to the civil Magistrate, howsoever it has
heretofore bin used, yet is there no cause, why it should now, or at any time
under Christian Princes, be of necessity retained.

Chap. 2. the. 28. Division.

And so also is answered the third question, that for so much as they were
Church officers (a) The place Heb. 13. is quoted only for the phrase, for it
pro ueth nothing in question.
and over the people in matters perteyning to God, and such as watched over the
souls of men (a) Heb. 13.
that therefore although they were not Pastors to preach the word, yet were
they no lay men (as they term them) but ecclesiastical persons.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Beza in an Epistle, that is prefixed before the confession of the Churches
in Beza.
Hel^tia, speaking of the Seigniorie, says, that there must be a great
consideration had, that Princes and noble men, and such as have authority and
pre-eminence in the Church, be chosen to be of the Seigniorie: and will you
make noble men and Princes ecclesiastical persons, and such as must watch
over the souls of men? in deed those that be called Presbyteri, in the
Scriptures be Ecclesiastical persons, for they be ministers of the word and
Sacraments. And M. Calvin Institut. cap. 8. sect. 52. Calvin.
says, that all the Seniors were ministers of the word. His words be these:
Habebant ergo singulae Civitates Presbyteroru^ collegium, qui pastores erant
and Doctores: nam and apud populu^ munus docendi, exhortandi and corrigendi,
quod Paulus Episcopis iniungit, OMNES obibant: for every City had a College
of Seniors, which were Pastors and teachers: for they did all exercise among
the people, the office of teaching, exhorting, and correcting, which Paul
does inioyne to Bishops. But how can you make your Seniors ecclesiastical,
seeing your Seigniorie must consist of noble men, gentlemen, marchauntmen,
husbandmen, handycraftesmen, as Tailors, Shomakers, Carpenters. etc. even such
as the most part of the Parish will choose?

Admonition.
Then the sentence was tempred according 1. Ti. 1. 20.
to the notoriousnesse of the fact. Now on the one (...) either hatred against
some persons carries men headlong into rash and cruel judgment: or else
favor, affection or money mitigateth the rigor of the same, and all this
comes to pass because the regiment left of Christ Mat. 18. 7. 1. Co. 12. 28
Romans 12. 8. 1. Ti. 5. 17. Act. 15. 2. 4 6. 22. 23.

easy for the wicked by bribing to pervert, than to overthrow the faith and
piety of a zealous and godly company, for such manner of men in deed Exodus
18. 21 Deuteronomy. 1. 13.
should the Seniors be.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 130. Sect. vlt. and Page 131. 132. and Page
133. Lin. vlt. and Page 134. Sect. 1.
You say, all this comes to pass because the regiment left of Christ to his
Church, is committed unto one man's hands: and for the proof of this, you note
in the margent the. 18. of Mat. the. 12. of the first to the Corin. the. 12. to
the Romans the. 5. of the first to Timoth. the. 15. of the Acts, which places
being examined, let the discrete Reader judge how aptly they serve for your
purpose.

In the. 18. of Math. Christ says on this sort: If thy brother trespass
against thee, go and tell him his fault betvveene him and thee alone, etc. In
the which place it is by the consent of all interpreters manifest, that Christ
prescribes a rule of correcting private and secret sins, and not of such
as be open and known to others. For he would not have pryuate and secret
sins blased abroad and publicly reprehended, before the party offending be
in this order first privately admonished: this makes nothing for your purpose,
it takes away authority of judging and condemning from private men, and not
from public magistrates.

In the. 12. of the first to the Corinth. verse. 28. these be the words of the
Apostle: And God has ordained some in the Church: as first Apostles, secondly
Prophets, thirdly teachers, then them that do miracles, after that the gift
of healing, helpers, governors, diversity of tounges. How can you gather of
these words, that all this comes to pass (that is, hatred, favor,
corruption by money, and affection in judgment) because the regiment left of
Christ to his Church, is committed to one man's hands? In these words the
Apostle declares that Christ has left in his Church governors, and thereof
you may well conclude, that in the Church there must be some which should
have authority over the rest. The Apostle does not here An imperfect reason.
say that in every particular congregation Christ has left many governors, no
more than he says that he has left many pastors for one flock: but in his
Church he has ordained governors.

The government of the whole universal Church, is not by Christ committed
to one Bishop, or one Prince, nor the government of the whole world, to one
Emperor: for no one man can discharge such a cure, and therefore he has
appointed in his Church diverse Bishops, diverse Princes, many governors. But
one Prince may suffice to govern one kingdom, and one Archbishop one
Province, as chief and principal over the rest, one Bishop one Diocese, one
Pastor one parish, neither does the Apostle speak any thing to the contrary.

In the. 12. to the Romans it is thus written: he that rules with
diligence. What makes this for your purpose, or how ca^ you wring it to your
assertion?

In the. 5. of the. 1. to Timothy. The Elders that rule well are worthy of
double honor. etc. Paul shows in these words that such are worthy their
stipende and reward, which rule well in the Church, and do their duties
diligently: But what is that to your assertion?

The places alleged out of the fiftenth of the Acts, be of the like sort.
Wheresoever mention is made in the Scriptures of governors Lack of discretion
in al^ging of scriptures.
or Elders, that you allege to improve the government of one man, wherein you
show a great want of judgment. And yet there is no one person in this Realm
(the Prince only excepted) which has such absolute jurisdiction, as you would
make your disciples believe. But your meaning is, that Christ left the whole
government of his Church to the Pastor, and to some four of five of the
Parish besides, which you are not able to prove; and your places of scripture
alleged signify no such matter. In those places yt be governed by many, do you
not see what contention there is? what enimitie? what factio^s? what parts
taking? what confusion? what little good order observed? what carelessness and
dissolutnesse in all manner of behavior? I could make this manifest by
examples, if I were disposed.

In the. 18. of Exodus, which (place you quote to prove that Seniors ought to
be zealous and godly) Iethro gives Moses counsel not to weary himself in
hearing all matters that be brought unto him, but rather to commit the hearing
and determining of smaller matters to others: And therefore verse. 21. he
says: Provide thou among all the people, men of courage, fearing God, men
dealyng truly, having covetousness, and appoint such over them to be rulers
over thousands, rulers over hundredes, rulers over fifties, and rulers over
tennes. etc. This makes nothing for Seniors: Moses here was chief, these were
but his under officers placed by himself. This place serves well for the
government of one Prince over one whole realm, and gives him good counsel
what under officers he ought to choose. To the same effect and purpose is that
spoken and written which you cite out of the first of Deuteron. verse. 13.

T. C. Page 146. Sect. 1.
The rest comprehended in these sections, is answered before, being matter
which perteyned unto the Archbishop.

Io. Whitgifte.
Uery little of it perteyneth to the Archbishop. The Authors of y^ Admonition
bring in all these places of Scripture, to prove the government of your
Seniors, but how aptly it app^areth, in that you cannot salve their follies in
so unapt allegatio^s. There be other things that require answer, but you have
shifted of all in saying, that they perteyne to the Archbishop and be answered
before: when as neither of both is true: for they perteyne to your Seniors and
be no where as yet answered. But I leave it to the Reader here to consider, why
you have not set down my book in your Reply.

The inconvenience of the Seigniorie in the time of Christian Princes,
especially in the state of this Church. Chap. 3.
Now that you have spoken all that you can for your Seniors, give me leave a
little to declare the absurdities and inconveniences that must of necessity
follow, that kind of government. 1. Difference and disagrement in orders and
religion.


First, every several parish must be as it were a several Church, governed by
several orders, and ceremonies, yea and peradventure profess several points
of doctrine: for there must be equality among ministers, and one of them
must not have to do with another parish. The whole government of the Parish
must remain in the minister and certain Seniors, who shall have authority to
correct vice, abolishe ceremonies, appoint orders, abregate customs, make
Ecclesiastical laws, as they shall think good for that congregation. So that
whatsoever the Pastor and his Seniors devise and agree upon, be it good or
evil, common or singular, it must be obeyed under the pain of Excommunication.

Secondly, that Seigniorie being choosen by the Pastor and the parish, if the
Prince or 2. Confusion of (...).
any other noble man be of that congregation and choosen to that office by the
most part, he must not refuse it, but attend upon it, be at M. Pastors
calling who is the chief of the Seigniorie, and in that respect above Earl,
Duke, Ring, or whosoever: moreover he must be contented to be lincked and
joined in commission, with the basest sort of the people, if it please the
parish to appoint to him such Colleags, as it is like they will: Yea and if
they be in matters of discipline and government by such simple Seniors
ouerruled, (as it is most like they shall) they must therewith be contented.

Thirdly, it burdeneth the parish more than they are able to bear, for whereas
now 3. Burden and charge of parishes.
they repine at the finding of their Pastors, then they must be enforced
besides the Pastor to nourish Deacons, and six or seven Seniors with widows
also.

Fourthly, it brings in a new Popedom, and tyra^nie into the Church, for it
gives 4. Tyranny.
to the Pastor and his fellow Seniors authority to exercise discipline, by
Excommunication, or otherwise against Prince, Nobles, and whosoever being of
that congregation. So that unless the Prince and Nobles be (as it were) at
their beck, and ready at al times to accomplish their desire, they will send
out their thunderboltes of Excommunication against them, even as the Pope was
wont to do, after he had gotten that Jurisdiction into his hand that this
Seigniorie claymeth.

Fifthly, it smells of Anabaptisme, as M. Gualter notes. 1. Cor. 11 in these
words, 5. It smells of Anabaptisme* Gualter.
The Donatists of our time ought to consider these things more diligently,
which do over rashly condemn whole cities and countries wherein the word of
God is preached* Sacraments rightly administered, public prayer celebrated, the
poor sufficiently provided for, and finally where vice is by good and holy
laws forbidden and punished. All these things they esteem as nothing, except
there be a certain new Magistracy appointed, which should have authority over
Princes also, not only to reprove, but also to excommunicate them.

It takes from the Prince al authority in Ecclesiastical matters, and it
gives unto 6. Spoiling the Prince of hi^ authority in cases Ecclesiastical.
him only potestatem facti, not Iuris, as the Papists do: for the Prince must
maintain and see executed, such laws, orders, and ceremonies, as ye Pastor
with his Seniors make and decree: But in making and appointing orders and
ceremonies, he may in no case meddle, as will hereafter more plainly appear.
7. Subversion of the state and government of the common wealth.


It transformeth the state and government of the common wealth into a mere
popularitie, for they say in their second Admonition Page 55. that some must
be governed by all, and not all by some, whereunto if that be joined which T. C.
so often repeateth, that is, the government of the common wealth must be
framed to the government of the church, as the hanginges to the house, it may
be easily coniectured what they shoot at. Second Admonition. Page 144.


The deciding of matters in controversy, by this Seigniorie, will be a great
occasion of partial and affectionate dealing: of contention and discord,
while some shall incline one way, and some another. For it cannot be unknown,
that there are many lightheaded 8. Contention and parcialitic.
and unconstant ministers, and that the common sort of people are not much
better affected, so that alteratio^s in doctrine, parciall dealing in
discipline, indiscreet exhortations, and admonitions, would trouble the whole
Church, and set all the land together by the ears.

How conte^ptible in the end this kind of government would be, and how little
esteemed, 9. It will in the end be conte^ned, and so good order neglected.
wise men can consider. And M. Gualter well sets out this inconvenience in
these words: For they which cannot be brought into good order by the
authority of a lawful magistrate, and by laws, much less will suffer
themselves to be punished, by the commandment of Seniors, and of an
Ecclesiastical senate, whom with all their solemnity they will Gualter in. ^.
Cor. 5.
laugh to scorn. On the other side, they which among the magistrates were
remiss in executing the discipline of ma^ners, and were too favorable, will
now be glad that this burden is transferred from them to others, and will wholly
neglect it. And what will the Seniors do, when these men will not meddle?
surely they will be a laughing stock to a great many:

Whiles Hares will prescribe to Lions a law,
And weaklinges would keep fierce tyrants in awe. as the Poet records.
Many also of the magistrates will not only wincke at this, but will laugh in
their sleeves at the weak and ridiculous Domination of the new Senate. It will
therefore so come to pass, that whereas before there was at the least some
discipline, and sometimes some were terrified by mulctes and examples of
punishments, now (that also being taken away) impunitie will begin to reygne,
with a great and public contempt of the sacred ministry. Neither do I
speak these things unadvisedly, for examples do teach us that these things
are done, which are so notoriously known to all men, that I need not to
speak any more of these things. But if in this immoderate licentiousness,
those Seniors should proceed to excommunicate all those, which set themselves
against them, it is to be feared least at the length there be a greater number
of excommunicated persons, tha^ of those which do communicate with the church.
Wherefore let the Seniors tell me what they think meet then to be done: I
suppose they will answer: it shall the^ be needeful to have the authority of
the magistrates that he might correct those wicked men, which by their
malepertnesse and rashness do overthrow the Church. I agree also to this
counsel: But if this thing ought then to be done, when as it can scarce be
without public danger, why is not the authority left wholly unto the
magistrate, and the whole government of public discipline committed to him
before the matter come to this extremity? Hitherto Gualter.

It would bring in, too great extremity of punishment: for whereas neither God
nor 10. Double punishment for one fault.
man, nor any law does punish one man twice for one and ye self same fact, and
it is against ye liberty of well ordered countries, to be subject to the
punishment of two diverse magistrates: by establishing this Seigniorie, this
burden must be laid upon the peoples necks. For let the Magistrate punish
according to the laws as severely as he can, yet ye Seigniorie will remit
nothing of their censures, but proceed according to their manner, as it may be
seen in the. 2. Admonition: fol. 47. And surely as M. Gualter Gualter in 1.
Cor. 5.
says speaking of this inco^uenie^ce of the Seigniorie in the former place:
It seems to us altogether very dangerous, to appoint two magistrates over
one people: neither see we any example whereby this may be proved: and surely I
willingly and freely confess that I cannot perceive how profitable it would be.

I omit to put you in mind how dangerous (namely in these days) alteratio^s
of 11. Alteration in this time dangerous, etc.
government and change of states is in established common wealths: likewise
how unreasonable a thing it is, to enforce the civil Magistrate to suffer in
his dominion so many several kinds of governments, orders, ceremonies, etc.
in the Church, as there be parishes. Also how unseemly it is, to deliver his
sword out of his own hands and to commit it to the discretion of the common
sort and multitude in every several parish, to displace noble men, gentlemen,
wise, learned, and discrete men, and commit the whole government of the Church
to M. Pastor and his ignorant neighbors. The absurdity and incoueniences that
of necessity must ensue of this kind of government, where there is a
Christian magistrate, be infinite, and wise men may easily co^ceyue the rest,
by that which I have here already spoken. Yet would I not have any man to
think that I condemn any churches, where this government is lawfully and
without danger received, only I have regard to whole kingdoms, especially
this Realm, where it cannot but be dangerous.

That there is no one certain kind of Government in the Church which must of
necessity be perpetually observed. Chap. 4.
I know it will be objected that ye ordinance of God must take place, whatsoever
inco^uenie^ces follow, and that this kind of government is the ordinance of
God, and therefore may not for any respect be omitted. But I have denied, and
sufficiently declared before, yt this kind of Government is no where in
scripture commanded, and that it neither is, nor can be perpetual. And
although I have sufficiently proved this, in one, or two places before (and the
contrary is yet unproven) as I had occasion to speak of it, yet I trust it
shall not be grievous to the Reader, if in a word or two, I here knit up the
matter.

First, I affirm that there is not one sentence in the whole scripture,
wherevpo^ ye 1. No commandment hereof in scripture.
perpetuity or the necessity of this kind of government, may be grounded.
For the place in. 1. Tim. 5. does neither command any such kind of
government, nor prescribe any form or manner of it: besides, the place is
doubtful and diversely expounded: and therefore no such perpetual rule can be
gathered of it. Moreover ye Apostle only in that place shows, that such as
rule well are worthy of double honor, etc. so that I marvel how any man can
of those words conclude either such a Seigniorie as now is Chap. 1. the. 1.
Division.
imagined, or any perpetuity of it. But of this place I have spoken before.

Secondly, it is well know, that the manner and form of government used in the
Apostles 2. The government in the Apostles time cannot now be exercised.
time, and expressed in the scriptures, neither is now, nor ca^ or ought to be
observed, either touching the persons or the functions: for we have neither
Apostles, Prophets, workers of miracles, gifts of healing, diversity of
tounges, widows, or such like, all which perteyned to the government of the
Church in the Apostles time, and were parts of it, as appears* 1. Cor. 12.
Ephesians. 4. 1. Tim. 5. And seeing that the Church is not bound to this form, so
plainly expressed in these places of scripture, I see not how you can bind it,
to the self same form of government used in the Apostles time.

Thirdly, this word gubernationes mentioned, 1. Cor. 12. whereupon you would
ground 3. The word ( gubernationes) implies not the Seigniorie, but by
conjecture.
your Seigniorie, may (as some learned men think) signify any kind of
government: cue^ the civil Magistrate. Certain it is, that only by mere
conjectures it is drawn to signify this new devised Seigniorie, and therefore
cannot infer any necessary co^clusio^. Furthermore it is by the spirit of
God placed among those functions yt be temporal, and by the judgment of all
learned men ceased: for thus the Apostle says: Deinde potestates, deinde dona
sanationum opitulationes, gubernationes. genera linguarum: now it were 1. Cor.
12.
a very strange matter, that all the rest should be temporal, and only
gubernationes perpetual: sure I am that the argument which so concludes, may
easily be denied, and by no probability proved.

Fourthly, we see manifestly, that in sundry points, the government of ye
Church, 4. The Apostolical government has of necessity been altered.
used in the Apostles time, is, and has been of necessity altered, and that
it neither may nor can be revoked: whereby it is plain, that any one certain
form or kind of external government perpetually to be observed, is no where
in the Scripture prescribed to the Church: but the charge thereof is left to
the Christian Magistrate, so that nothing be done contrary to the word of
God.

This is theopinion of the best writers, neither do I know any learned man of a
5. The general opinion of the best writers. Musculus. loc. Com. tit. de Magist.
contrary judgment. M. Musculus speaking of those Seniors says that they
were used in those Churches only, that were destitute of Christian Magistrates:
which have the chieftie and power, etc. not only in profane, but in divine
matters. And after answering an objection of 1. Cor. 6. he says: that we must
needs distinguish between the state of the Church in those days, and that
whichis now. I have before declared M. Gualters judgment of this matter in his
Commentaries upon the. 1. Cor. 5. And upon the. 11. chapt. Gualter. hom. 56.
in. 1. Cor.
speaking generally of the government of the Church, he says thus:
Wherefore as concerning the doctrine of faith and salvation, we acknowledge no
traditions of the Apostles, but those which are contained in the creed, etc.
But as concerning the external form of the Church, we deny not that they
have taught every where, many things of the order of Ecclesiastical
assemblies, of the administration of Sacraments, and of the whole government of
the Church. Whereof because there cannot be one form in every place
observed, they did in such sort appoint them, as they saw to be requisite
for the condition of any City or Country. And it is certain that the
Churches in all ages have used their liberty in these things: and therefore
they are to injurious which at this day either under the name of the traditions
of the Apostles, or for any other pretense, go about to bind all Churches to
one and the self same form. And upon the. 12. chapter, where he again
speaks of the Seigniorie, he Idem.
says, There be diverse which will needs institute Elders, or an
Ecclesiastical ^enate according to the example of the old and primitive
Church, which also should have authority, over the Magistrates themselves, if
at any time they did not their duty. But it behooves them first to show that
those their Seniors have this power, whereof Paul does presently speak, which
thing seeing it does by no means appear, and yet notwithstanding they deliver
unto Satan whom they will, they do like as if some would go about to cleanse the
leprous, raise the dead, and work other miracles because these things were
usually done in the primitive Church. And y^ which he speaks touching this
matter also upon the. 14. chapt. of ye same Epistle is not unworthy ye noting:
whereof I have before made mention, That their ambition Idem.
is (there) reproved which go about to bring all churches, to the form of
their discipline and government, and cry out that there is no discipline
there, where al things are not agreeable to their traditions and orders: But
these me^ receive a just reward of their arroga^cie, when as they that come
from the^ to other countries, do go beyond all me^ in sauciness, neither bring
they any thing with the^ from home, but a vain and intolerable contempt of
all good men, neither can they abide to be corrected by any admonition of
others.

M. Calvin speaking of the government of the Church Instit. Cap. 8. Sect. 120.
says thus: Scimus politiam pro varietate temporu^ recipere, imo exigere,
varias mutationes. We know that the policy (of the Church) does receive, nay
rather does require diverse alterations. Calvin. Beza.
M. Beza likewise Lib. confess. Cap. 5. Sect. 17 is of the same mind touching
the government of the Church: There was another cause of the Ecclesiastical
assemblies, that they might ordeyne canons of Ecclesiastical discipline, and
(that I may co^prehende many things in few words) that they might appoint
ecclesiastical policy, for the diverse circumstances of times, places, and
persons. For it is necessary all things should be done orderly in the house
of God: of the which order there is one general reason to be taken out of the
word of God, but not one and the same form agreeable to all circumstances. And
Section. 32. speaking of this Seigniorie, he shows that it was necessary in
the Church, whilst there was no Christian magistrate. For so he writes: But
there Idem.
were Elders chosen by suffrages, or at least by the approbation of the whole
company, as it is very evident out of Ambrose, which complayneth, that
certain men had transferred this authority to themselves: and ^ut of Cyprian
likewise, by whom we may also understand, that the Bishop did rule over the
college of Elders, not that he should there reygne, but that by their consent
he might rule the Policy of the church, especially for so much as at that time
the Churches of Africa were not helped of the Magistrate, but were rather
cruelly vexed of them. And Sect. 35. speaking generally of the government of
the Church, he says: Neither must we simply look what was done of the
Apostles in the Government Idem.
of the church, seeing there are most diverse circumstances, and therefore
without preposterous zeal, all things cannot in all places and times be
called to one and the same form: but rather the end and inuariable purpose of
them must be looked unto, and that manner and form of doing things is to be
chosen, which does directly tend thereunto. This is the judgment of these
learned men, neither do I know any that thinks the contrary, except such as
make post haste to that branch of Anabaptisme.

Sixthly, either we must admit another form now of governing the Church than
6. The iurisdietion of the christian magistrate implies a change of the first
kind of government.
was in the Apostles time, or else we must seclude the Christian magistrate,
from all authority in Ecclesiastical matters, and attribute no more to him
therein, than was attributed to Nero in the Apostles time: for in those days
there was no Christian Prince to govern the church. But Christian Princes have
and must have, ye chief care and government of the Church next under God: Ergo,
the same form of government cannot be now, nor ought to be, that was in the
Apostles time.

Thus it is evident that the ground whereof T. C. has builded his whole
book, is a false ground, contrary to the Scriptures, the practice of the
Church, the opinions The ground of the Reply.
of learned men, and the lawful and just authority of christian Princes, and
therefore the building is ruinous and cannot stand.

Of certain matters concerning discipline in the Church. Tract. 18.
Of Excommunication, and in whom the execution thereof does consist.
Chap. 1. the. 1. Division.
Admonition.
Let us come now to the third part, which concerns ecclesiastical
discipline: the officers that have to deal in this charge, are chiefly three,
Ministers, Preachers, or Pastors, of wheme before. Seniors or Elders, and
Deacons. Concerning Seniors, not only their office, but their name also is out
of this English Church utterly removed. Their office was to Act. 14. 4. 1. Cor.
1^. 28.
govern the church with the rest of the Ministers, to consulte, to admonish,
to correct, and to order all things apperteyning to the state of the
congregation.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 112. Sect. 3.
What Scripture have you to prove that such Seniors as you mean, and Deacons
had any thing to do in Ecclesiastical discipline? I think the only discipline
that we have in the whole new testament (except you will make admonition and
exhortation a part of it) is Excommunication: and the execution of that is only
committed to the ministers of the word. Math. 16. John. 20. Examples hereof
we have Only (...) misters may excommunicate*
1. Cor. 5. 1. Tim. 1. and ad Titum. 3.

T. C. Page 146. Sect. 2.
Now I return back again to excommunication, which M. Doctor thinks to be
ye only discipline in the church, but he should understand, that beside y^
part of private discipline (which is ordinarily and daily to be exercised by
every one of ye pastors and elders, as admonition and reprehension) there are
three principal parts which are exercised of the^ jointly and together, whereof
the first is the election or choice, and the abdication or putting out of
ecclesiastical officers. The second is in excommunication of the stubborn or
absolution of the repentant. The third is the decision of all such matters as
do rise in the church, either touching corrupt manners or perverse doctrine.

Io. Whitgifte.
I speak of ye public discipline of ye church, not of private admonition and
reprehension, which may be called by ye name of Discipline, but neither are
they properly, nor usually so called, except you will also say ye public
preaching and reading of ye scriptures is discipline: these be things annexed
to discipline, but improperly termed by ye name Wherein discipline consists
of discipline. Your partition of discipline into those three parts, in my
poor judgment, is very unskillful: for discipline consists in punishing and
correcting of vice: neither yet is the deciding of controversies in matters
doubtful, properly called discipline, for discipline is exercised in punishing
and correcting ye persons, not decioing ye causes. Wherefore I think you have
forgotten your self, and in stead of ye part, have divided ye whole, that is,
you have made a division of government, whereas you took upon you to divide
discipline, which is but a part of ecclesiastical policy or government.

Read the general confession, of ye Christian churches in Heluetia, and tell
me what it differs from any thing ye I have said. Call to your remembrance
that which your self Page 1. 4. li^. 9
have spoken, page 14. where you call other censures of the church, but
forerunners to excommunication, but this is a contention only about words, and
therefore enough is said of it.

Chap. 1. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page 146. Sect. 3.
As touching the election, and consequently ye throwing out, it has been
showed before, that together with the church, the Eldership has the principal
swaye. For ye decision of controversies when they rise, it may apeare in the.
15. of the Acts, yt the Presbytery or Eldership of the church has to
determine of that also. Now it remains here, that whereas M. Doctor says,
that the excommunication and consequently the absolution or restoring to the
church again, does perteme only to the minister. ye I show that the presbytery
or eldership, and the whole church also, has interest in the excommunication,
and consequently in the absolution or restoring unto the church. But here by
the way it is to be (...) not worthy the noting.
noted, that in saying that it belongs to ye minister, he confesses ye
disorder in our church, wherein this power is taken away from the minister and
given to the Bishop and his officers.

Io. Whitgifte.
Of Election of ministers, and so of their reiection, and throwing out,
sufficient has bin spoken Tract. 3.
before, and your manner of electing by better reasons confuted, than it was by
you proved: for the decisions of controversies when they arise, it may appear
in the. 15. of ye Acts, that the best way is to call Synodes and Councels of
learned me^, as it was there practiced, and not to commit such matters to the
pastor of every several parish, and certain of his neighbors whom you call
the Seigniorie: for if it had bin so, what needed Paul and Barnabas have taken
so long a journey from Antioche to Jerusalem for ye deciding of their
controversies, seeing yt they and the Seigniorie (if there had bin any such)
might have ended the same at home in Antioche? This place undoubtedly
overthrows your Seigniorie, except now you will take it (as it is in
ecclesiastical writers oftentimes taken) for a Synod or co^uocatio^ of bishops
and priests: so ye not your Seigniorie which is in every parish, but general
or prouincial Councils and Synodes must have ye deciding of controversies: else
as I said before, why should Paul and Barnabas come from Antioche to Jerusalem
to have their controversies determined?

Your note by the way, is not worth a rushe, for when I say yt the execution of
discipline is only committed to the ministers of the word, you cannot
thereupon conclude, that every minister has authority to exercise it in the
church. It is one thing to say, only ministers have authority to
excommunicate, and to say that all ministers have authority so to do: only
ministers may be Bishops, and yet all ministers be not Bishops: only Lawyers
may be Judges, and yet all Lawyers be not Judges: only citezens may be
Aldermen, Sherifes, and Majors, and yet all be not so: wherefore by the way
here you ouersot your self. And yet I think that all ministers have power to
excommunicate, if the Church think it good, to commit that authority unto
them.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page. 146. Sect. 4.
Now that this charge of excommunication belongs not unto one, or to the
minister, but chiefly to the Eldership and Pastor, it appears by that which
the authors of the Admonition allege out of S. Matthew, which place I have
proved before to be necessarily understood of the elders of the 18. Chap.
church.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have told you before, how that place of Matthew is to be understood, and
what it is, to tell the Church, namely either to reprove the party openly
before the congregation or else to complain to such as have authority in the
church, and to whom ye executing of discipline is committed, which is by the
order of the church of England, the Bishop. And therefore the Bishop alone
both by the laws of God, and of this church of England (which has given unto
him by consent in Parliament that authority) may exercise this discipline.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.
Admonition.
Then it was said tell Math. 18. 17
the church: now it is spoken, complain to my Lords grace, Primate and
Metropolitan of all England, or to his inferior, my Lord Bishop of the
Diocese, if not to him, show the Chancellor, or Official, or Commissarie,
or Doctor.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 135. Sect. 1.
As it was said then, so ought you and may you say now: in private offenses,
if private admonitions will not serve, then must you declare them to the
church, either by reprehending of them publicly, before the whole congregation
(if you be called thereunto) for that is Church signifies those that have
authority in the church.
one kind of telling the church, or else by complaining to such as have
authority in. the church, for in that place of Mathewe (as all learned
interpretours both old and new do determine) the church signifies such as
have authority in the church. Therefore when you complain to my Lords
grace, Lord Bishop of the Dioces, or their Chauncellors, Commissaries. etc.
You tell the church, that is, such as be appointed to be public Magistrates
in the church, according to the very true sense and interpretation of that
place.

T. C. Page 146. Sect. vlt.
It is most absurdly said of M. doctor in the. 135. page, that by the church
is understood either my Lords grace, or the Bishop of the Dioces, or the
Chauncellor or Commissarie. And that when a man complayneth unto one of these,
he may be well said to complain unto the church, which is the more
intolerable, for that being so strange a saying, and such as may astonyshe
at that hear it, he neither confirms it by no reason, by no like phrase of
scripture, by no authority of any Godly or approved writer, old or new,
which notwithstanding he seeks for so diligently, and turns the
commentaries in his study so paynefully, when he can have but one against
twenty, and but a syllable where he cannot have a sentence.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have showed sufficient authority for my saying, even the consent of all
learned interpreters: who by the church in that place understand such as have
chief authority in the church, which in this church of England (as I have
said) are bishops. Chrysostom Chryso^t. Hom. 61. in Math.
says as much as I do, so that it need not to seem so strange that it
should astonishe all thee hear it, his words be these: Dic ecclesiae,
Praesulibus scilicet, and Praesidentibus. Tell the church, that is, the
Prelates, and Presidents. But you think to ouerlode me with unseemly words,
howbeit that will not carry away the cause: I am so used to them by you and
yours, both in speech and writing, that I esteem them now (I thank God) as I
do the dust of my feet. If I seek the writers so diligently, and turn the
commentaries in my study so painfully, why do you so often accuse me of
ignorance, and want of reading, and taking my pleasure? Ex ore tuo te iudico.
etc. and mendacem memorem esse oportet.

Chap. 1. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 146. Sect. vlt. etc.
It may be the clerelier understood, that the presbytery or eldership, had
the chief stroke in this excommunication, if it be observed that this was the
policy and discipline of the Jews, and of the Synagogue from whence our
savior Christ took this, and translated it unto his church, that when any man
had done any thing that they held for a taulte, that then the same was
punished and censured by the elders of the church, according to the quality of
the fault, as it may appear in S. Matthew, for although it be of some (and
those very learned) expounded of the civil judgment, vet for Cap. 5.
so much as the Jews had nothing to do with civil judgments, (the same
being altogethe^ in the hands of the Romans) and that the word Sanedrim,
corrupted of the Greek word (...) which S. Matthew uses, is known by those
that have skill in the Rabbines, and especially the Jews Talmud to signify
the ecclesiastical governors, there can be no doubt but he means the
ecclesiastical censures. And if the fault were judged very great, then the
sentence of excommunication Cap. 9.
was awarded by the same Elders as appears in S. John. And this was ye cause
why our savior Christ spoke so shortly without noting the circumstances more
at large, for that he spoke of a thing which was well known and used amongst
the Jews whom he spoke unto.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is very unlike that our savior Christ would borow any such manner or form
of government from the Jews: seeing the same was neither before prescribed
unto them by God, nor yet at that time rightly used, but most shamefully
abused: and yet (if it were so) it quite overthrows your purpose. For the
Jews Seigniorie was only at Ierusalen, yours must be in every parish: besides
that, there is a great differ^ce in the persons.

Howbeit I do not understand how you can draw the place in the. 5. of Matthew
to your purpose, for if you mean these words ( Quicunque dixerit fratri suo
Racha, obnoxious Math. 5.
erit concilio: He that calls his brother Racha, shall be in danger of a
council) as I am sure you do, Christ does not there prescribe any form of
government or order of punishing, but he declares the degrees of uncharitable
dealing toward our brethren, and the increase of punishments according to
the same.

M. Bullinger in his Commentaries upon that place says, that the word (...),
(...) Bullinger.
does signify consessum Iudicum and buiusmodi consessum qualis apud Graecos
erat Amphictyonum qui de grauissimis solebant consultare causis. And he adds,
that Christ hereby signifies, that as the fault increases, so does the
punishment also.

M. Calvin likewise in his harmony upon the Gospel says that Christ in this
place, Calvin.
alluding to earthly judgments does testify, that God will be judge even of
secret anger to punish it. And because he proceeds further, which utters
his anger in bitter speech, he says that he is guilty, coram toto coelesti
consessu, before the celestial assembly, that he may sustain the greater
punishment.

Noua Glossa says, that (...) does signify an assembly of judges, and that
in such Noua Glossa.
assemblies as at Athens in the court of Mars, weightier causes were wont to be
handeled, and punishments for offenders, consulted upon. There, says that
commentary, Christ by the name of a council, alluding to the manners and
customs of men, teaches that those are more grievously to be punished, which
more utter and express their anger.

Beza says, that (...) signifies that kind of government, wherein there was.
23. Beza.
Judges, to whom did apperteine the hearing of weighty causes. And the
marginall note of the Geneua bible upon this place is this: Like judgment
almost, the Romans observed, for Triumuiri had the examination of small
matters, the Council of. 23. of greater causes, and finally great matters of
importance were decided by the senate of. 71. judges, which here is compared
to the judgment of God, or to be punished with hell fire. Which fully agrees
with M. Beza his interpretation, who says also: that it is according to the
Hebrewe commentaries.

Now how you can pull this to your Seigniorie, or to Ecclesiastical governors
only, and especially to excommunication, I cannot learn or read in any
writer: and these whom I have here named, teach a far other sense and
meaning of the words of Christ than you do.

Chap. 1. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page 147. Lin. 15.
And that this was the meaning of our savior Christ in those words it may
appear by ye practice which is set forth in the Epistles to the Corinthians.
For it is certain that S. Paul did both understand and observe the rule of
our Savior Christ. But he communicates this power of excommunication with
the church, and therefore it must needs be the meaning of our Savior
Christ, that the excommunication should be by many, and not by one, and by the
church and not by the minister of the church alone. For he bids the church
of Corinthe twice in the first Epistle, 1. Cor. 5.
once by a metaphore, another time in plain words, that they should
excommunicate the incestuous person. By metaphore, saying This is not (...) of
the in (...) person
purge out your old leaven, in plain and flat words when he says, take away
that wicked man from amongst you. And in the second Epistle understanding of
the repentance 2. Cor. 2.
of that man, he entreats them that they would receive him in again, showing
that he was content to release the bond and chain of his excommunication, so
that they would do the same, and therefore considering the absolution or
reconciliation of the excommunicate, does pertayne unto ye church, it follows
that the excommunication does in like manner apperteine unto it.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin speaking of the words of Christ, Math. 18. wherein I am sure you
will have the same order of government to be expressed, that is in this place
of Math. 5. does make great difference betwixt the order there prescribed by
Christ, and that practiced by the Apostle. 1. Cor. 5. because in that place,
Christ commits the matter to a few, and in this place the Apostle seems to
commit it to the whole multitude. M. Caluines words be these, A question may be
asked what he means by the name of the Church: for Paul Calvin in. 18.
Math.
commands the incestuous Corinthian to be excommunicated not of any chosen
number, but of the whole company of the godly: wherefore it is probable that
here the judgment is committed to the whole people: But because then as yet
there was no church which professed Christ, neither any such order appointed,
and the Lord speaks according to the usual and received custom: There is no
doubt, but that he alludeth unto the order of the old church, as also in other
places, he frames his talk according to the known and usual manner. So
that, that excommunication used in the church of the Corinthians, can in no
respect be the practice of the rule of Christ in either of the places, neither
yet according unto it: wherefore you write without judgment, you wot not what.

S. Paul did publicly excommunicate in the presence of the whole church, and
used them as witnesses of his just dealing: but his words be plain that the
right and power of excommunication remained in him self.

When S. Paul says unto the Corinthians, Expurgate vetus fermentum. etc.
purge out the old leaven, he speaks not of the incostuous Corinthian, but
exhorts them 1. Cor. 5.
to newnes of life: you shall hear how M. Calvin expounds that place:
Because he had borrowed a similitude of leaven, he reteyneth it still: although
he does digress from the Calui. 1. Cor. 5.
matter which he has in hand unto a general doctrine, for he speaks no
more of the incestuous person, but generally exhorts them unto purity of
life. etc.

Lord how careless you are in perverting the true sense and meaning of the
scripture, that you may violently draw them to your purpose.

When he says: Put away that wicked man from among you, he does not will them
to excommunicate him, but to shun and avoid his company, and not to suffer
him to come among them because he was excommunicate. And as he in this place
moves them to a detestation of him, so in that place of the second Cor. 2.
after his repentance and receiving again into the church, he exhorts them to
embrace him and to love him This may and ought to be done, the authority of
excommunication resting in one, for the people without such exhortations will
hardly conceive a good opinion of him whom they have known to be so grievous an
offendour.

Wherefore the Apostle here moves them to forgive him, and to love him: he
does not give them any authority to deliver him from the bond of
excommunication, for that he did himself, as it may evidently appear by the
circumstance of the place.

Chap. 1. the. 7. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 113. Lin. 10.
I read in the fifth chapter of the first to the Corinthians, that the
incestuous Corinthian was excommunicated publicly in the presence of the whole
congregation. But I read neither of Senior nor Deacon, called as officers to
the same. S Paul himself says: Paul alone had lus exco^municandi.
Ego quidem vt absens corpore, presens spiritu, iam decreui tanquam presens, vt
is. etc. I truly as absent in the body, but present in spirit, have
determined as present, that he. etc. Which manifestly argues, that Ius
excommunicandi, was in Paul and not 1. Corinthians. 5.
in the rest. But all is scripture that you speak, how far soever it is
from the true meaning and sense of the scripture.

T. C. page 147. Sect. 1.
Now, whereas M. Doctor upon those words of S. Paul, that he being absent in
body, and present in spirit, had determined. etc. concludes that the right of
excommunication was in S. Paul, and not in the rest, it is as much as if he
should say, S. Paul Maledict^ glossa quae corumpit textum.
as much as lay in him excommunicated, therefore S. Paul excommunicated: or
S. Paul excommunicated, therefore the church did not. For what if S. Paul did
excommunicate him so much as lay in him, should he therefore have been
excommunicated, if the church of Corinthe and the minister there would have
admitted him to the supper, and not abstain from samiliar companying with him?
You will say he should have been bound in heaven and before God, although the
church of Corinthe had not put him forth. It is true that the Apostles
denunciation of Gods vengeance upon the impenitent sinner, is ratified in
heaven, and so should he also have been* if S. Paul had said nothing, and yet
S. Paul did not excommnnicate the incestuous person, but so much as lay in
him, and as far as his right stretched: not being therefore yet
excommunicated by S. Paul, it follows that the church had a stroke in the
excommunication.

Io. Whitgifte.
S. Paul did excommunicate him, and if the church of Corinthe had kept him in
amongst them notwithstanding, yet had he been excommunicated before God: and
they should have showed the^ selves, to have been a stubborn and rebellious
people: In deed, if you Excommunication is more than excluding from the
eternal society.
take excommunication for excluding from the external society of the church
only, then the people if they be stubborn and wilful, may stop and hinder
the execution of that discipline, but in so doing they forget their duty. But
if by excommunication you understand bynding in heaven (as you ought to do)
then had the incestuous person been truly excommunicated, though both the
minister and the people had said the contrary. Wherefore it is true that the
right of excommunicating remained in Paul, though the people did give their
consent unto it, by secluding him from their company, and from the sacraments.

Chap. 1. the. 8. Division.
T. C. Page 147. toward the end.
Again to prove that the church has nothing to do with excommunication, it is
not enough to say, that S. Paul had the right of excommunication: But you
should have showed that he only had opinions should no otherwise be put to
silence, than by excommunication, and ought no further to be punished, do not
reason sufficiently and aptly. For there is one duty of the Bishop, and
another of the Magistrate. Paul writing unto Titus does not entreat of the
office of a magistrate, but shows what is convenient for a Bishop. Although a
moderate mean is always best: that they which are not past care, be not so
much kept in order by force, as by ecclesiastical discipline. But you think
your own word to be a sufficient warrant against all men. You may well study
the words of the Scripture, but me think you do not greatly pass for the

I confess the name to be mistaken: it is an oversight, and yet no greater
than In his Epistle Sect. 8*
yours is in alleging Josias for Ezechias. And both this, and that which
follows of Theodorete for Theodotus, were corrected as well in the books of
the first edition, as in the second, before I had your warning. The placing of
one name for another is not so great an oversight, but that it may sometime
happen to those which are very circumspect, and even unto your self, as
Josias for Ezechias, in the beginning, (*) and Gregory for George, afterward:
so that herein you are not inferior to me, and the Page 97. Sect. 3 Ambrose.
one may well be set against the other. But let these tryfles go: it is Ambrose
in his book de Officijs cap. 27. whose words be these: Let the Bishop use the
Clearkes, and especially the Ministers which are indeed his sons, as his
own members: let him assign every one to that office whereunto he shall see
him to be meet. The part also of the body which putrifyeth is with grief cut
off, and it is long looked unto; if it can be cured with medicines* but if it
cannot, the^ is it cut away by a good Physician. So it is the property of a
good Bishop, that he be desirous to heal the weak, to take away sores that
creep on, to burn some, and not to cut them away: last, to cut away with
grief that which cannot be cured.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 113. Lin. 5. Theodorus alone excommunicated.

Theodorete Bishop of Laodicea, did by himself alone excommunicate both
Appolinaries for keeping company with that wicked Sophister Epiphanius, as
Sozomenus writes Lib. 6. cap. 25.

T. C. Page 148. Sect. 2.
As for Theodoretus Bishop of Laodicea, which Sozomene makes mention of, in
his sixth book, I find none such, but there is mentioned of one Theodotus,
who is said to have separated or excommunicated Apollinaris, but it does not
appear there that he alone of his own authority did excommunicate him. And
there be great reasons in that Chapter, to prove that he did it not of his own
authority, for immediately after his heresy was known, Damasus bishop of
Rome, and Peter Bishop of Alexandria, caused a Synod to be gathered at Rome,
where his heresy was condemned. Now for so much as the custom of Synodes and
Councelles is, when they condemn the heresies, to excommunicate the heretics,
You understand not the story: for at this time Apollinaris was not fallen into
his heresy.
it is to be thought that that Council did excommunicate him, and that
Theodotus Bishop of Laodicea, did execute that decree and excommunication. And
in deed Sozomene does so expound himself, when immediately after he had said
that he did excommunicate him Untruth, for these words are not spoken of
Theodorus, but of Georgius his (...), who excomunicated Apollinaris the second
(...).
he adds (...), which is that he declared him excommunicate, which indeed
properly belongs to the Minister, when the excommunication is decreed by
those to whom it apperteyneth, which thing may yet better appear by the manner
of speech, which is used in another place, where speaking of Uictor
exco^municating Theodotus, he utters it by this (...) which is to promulgate
or pronounce the sentence which was decreed by others.

Io. Whitgifte.
Sozomene in that Chapter does plainly declare that both the Apollinaries were
Both the Apollinaries excommunicated by Theodotus.
excommunicated by Theodotus, not for any heresy, but because they kept
company with Epiphanius that wicked Sophister. Neither was Apollinaris as yet
fallen to his heresy, as it is manifest in the story: for being upon
repentance absolved by Theodotus, he was afterward again excommunicated by
one George, the successor of Theodotus in his Bishoprike, because he kept
company with Athanasius, whom George being an Arrian could not abide. In
this time of his excommunication, because he could not by any entreaty
persuade George to receive him into the Church again, of purpose he published
an heresy, for the which he was afterward condemned Sozom. lib. 6. Cap. 25.
in a Synod at Rome. And therefore says the story: If George had received
Apollinaris being repentant, like as Theodotus had done before, I suppose that
this heresy had not been raised of him. So that you are far wide, and give
great suspicion that either you have not read the story, or else of purpose
mean to delude the Reader.

The words that the story uses to signify, Theodotus excommunicating them,
be these, (...): did separate them from the Church. The words which you have
recyted be not spoken of Theodotus, but of George his successor, who also did
excommunicate Apollinaris, not both the father and the son, as Theodotus did,
but only the son (as I have said) before he fell into his heresy, and
therefore before he was condemned at Rome. So that he did not (as you say)
execute the decree of that Council, but did himself excommunicate.

Neither do the words help you one whitte by any means, for what other
thing can you gather thereof, but that he pronounced the sentence of
excommunication against him? even as it is the manner in our Church, though he
be excommunicated by the same person only, which pronounces the sentence. And
if that the right of excommunication had not been in George only, why is
there mention that he would by no means be entreated to absolve him? For I
am sure that you will Page 147. lin. 29.
grant (and indeed you have before so affirmed) that absolution is of the
same quality in this respect with excommunication: and it is there witnessed,
that Apollinaris did oftentimes desire him to receive him again into the
fellowship of the Church. So that it is manifest, that in those days, the
Bishop alone did excommunicate.

Chap. 1. the. 14. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 113. Lin. 9. Ambrose excommunicated.

So did Ambrose excommunicate Theodosius the Emperor, and is therefore in all
stories greatly commended.

T. C. Page 148. in the end.
As for Ambrose although he be greatly commended for excommunicating the
Emperor, yet he was never commended for that he did excommunicate him himself
alone, and if he did excommunicate him himself alone, yet his fault was the
less, for so much as he being desirous of an Eldership, could not as it
seems by his complaint which I have spoken of before obtain one. And
although the stories do not make mention that there were others whose
authority came into this excommunication, yet it follows not, that there
were no other. And how often will you stumble at that which you do so sharply
reprove in others, which is in making of arguments of authority negatiuely?
And if you will not grant this manner of reasoning in the Scripture, in matters
perteyning to the government of the Church, which are all comprehended in the
scripture, how would you reason of a common story, which neither can nor
does profess to speak all those things, which fall into that matter which it
writes of? But what if so be it be proved, that Ambrose did not this of his
own authority, but by the authority also of others, will you then confess
that he is commended of all those which write stories for so doing, and
confess that the use and practice of the primitive Church was far from this
that is now? For proof whereof I will give you a place which Ambrose the best
witness of this matter has in one of his Epistles, where Epist. 38.
he shows that as soon as the murder which Theodosius had caused to be done
at the City of Ambrose falsisyed.
Thessalonica was heard, by and by the Bishops of France came, and there was
holden a Synod, where also Ambrose says, that his communicating with
Theodosius could not absolve him, for that as it may appear, the Bishops in
that Synod had in excommunicating him, ordained that he should not be
absolved, until such time as he had done repentance, which he did afterward
Amb. li* de obitu Theo.
with confession of his fault before the Congregation, and asking forgiveness
of it. So it appears that that which he did, he did it by the sentence of the
Synod, and not of his own authority alone.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is not to be read in any story, or other writer, that Ambrose ever sought
to have an Eldership in his Church: for if he had so done, it is not like but
that he might have obtained it, being of that credit and authority with the
Emperor: only in speaking of the Eldership which consists of Priests
only: he says that he cannot tell upon what occasion it grew out of use.
etc. but this is from the purpose.

Ambrose is commended for excommunicating Theodosius, and* for excommunicating
him Ambrose excommunicateth alone.
alone, as it may appear in Theodorete lib. 5. cap. 18. and Sozomene lib. 7.
cap: 24. For if he had used the assistance of other, the commendation of his
courage and boldness, had not been so notorious and famous: neither is it
like that the people durst join with their Bishop in such an enterprise
against their Emperor, and if it had been done by any council of Bishops or
Synod, to what end and purpose should Ambrose carry away all the fame and
commendation, not one word once mentioned in any story of any other
assistante unto him in that action? But what need I use these words, seeing
the history reported both by Theodorete and Sozomene do very plainly
testify the same.

My argument is not negative from authority, but affirmative: for all stories
that I have read do attribute this whole action of excommunicating Theodosius
to Ambrose alone. Read the places of Theodoret and Sozomene, before mentioned,
and you shall see that a man may safely conclude affirmatively, that Ambrose
alone did both excommunicate and absolve him. Some of the late writers that
have occasion to speak of this matter, do testify the same, as namely Master
Gualter upon the. 1. Cor. 5. and therefore reproves Ambrose his fact. But
because you here charge me with so often reasoning from authority negatiuely,
name one unto me that I have so used, or tell me why hitherto you have only
espied this? Remember that you are a divine of whom it is required to speak
truly. The Synod dso not excommunicate


But say you: what if it be proved that Ambrose did not this of his own
authority? and I say what if it be manifestly laid before your eyes, that you
have not rightly Theodosius.
collected of those places of Ambrose, and that they make not for your purpose,
which you have here alleged for your proof? First your quotation in the
margent is false: for Ambrose has not one word of that matter in his. 38.
Epistle, but that might be the fault of the Printer. That which he says, is in
his. 28. Epistle, the which also you have falsified, for there is not one
word spoken of any excommunication used by that Synod, against Theodosius:
only Ambrose says, that when the Synod heard of it, every man lamented it,
and took it in evil part: and that he himself could not admit him into his
Communion, nor absolve him from that offense without due repentance. And that
is his meaning when he says: Non erat facti tui absolutio in Ambrosij
communione. Which also the words following and the scope of the whole Epistle
does declare. For in that Epistle Ambrose does exhort Theodosius to repentance
for that fact, and after these words that I have recyted, follows
immediately this sentence: The grieuousnesse also of the fault should be Amb.
Epist. 28.
laid unto my charge the more, if no man should say that the reconciliation
of our God were necessary. Art thou ashamed to do that, O Emperor, that the
kingly Prophet David did? Whereby it is plain, that Ambrose in his letters
signifies unto the Emperor, that he must first repent him and be reconcyled
unto God, before he may admit him to communicate with him. Neither does
Ambrose say: that these Bishops were by and by gathered together as soon as
this murder was heard of: neither was there any such cause of that Synod: but
they being gathered together upon other occasions and before the murder was
committed (as it will appear if you mark the words of Ambrose well) news
was brought unto them of the murder, which they greatly lamented as I said
before. There is not one word it that Epistle, whereof it can be gathered that
either that Synod did excommunicate him, or ordeyne that he should not be
absolved, until such time as he had done repentance: how much betwere it for
you to repeat the words of the Author: but then should you spill your grace
in counterfeyting.

The second place of Ambrose lib de obitu Theodos. alleged to prove that
Theodosius afterward confessed his fault before the congregation, and asked
forgiveness of it, is more than needs: for that is not denied of any man: and
Theodorete lib. 5. cap. 18. does set that his submission and confession out in
these words. So in the end Theod. li. 5. 18.
Saint Ambrose absolved him, and the most faithful Emperor being bold to
enter into the Church, prayed, not standing or kneeling, but lying prostrate
upon the ground he uttered these words of David: My soul cleaves unto the
dust, quicken me according to thy word. And pulling his hear with his
hands, and beating his face, and watring the ground with the drops of his
tears, he asked forgiveness. But this proves not that the people had any
authority in excommunicating of him. In this Church of England, though the
Bishop alone do excommunicate, Excommunicate persons not received before
public confession and repentance.
yet he that is excommunicated for any notorious crime, is not received into
the Church again, before he have made a public confession in the open
Congregation, and asked pardon and forgiveness of his offense. Wherefore there
is nothing yet alleged of any such force, to prove that Ambrose alone did not
excommunicate Theodosius.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 220. Sect. 1.
And first you show yourselfe greatly offended, that the Pastor is spoiled of
his lawful jurisdiction over his flock: and therefore you brust out into these
words of heat, ravening rablers, horrible, sacrllegiously, and such like. It
had been well if you had told us, what that lawful jurisdiction of the Pastor
over his flock given by the word had been: For the places of Scripture which
you quote for that purpose, do not plainly enough set out that matter. In the.
18. of Matthew verse. 17. after certain admonitions in private offenses, Christ
says: Dir Ecclesiae: tell the Church. In which place (as I told you before)
the Church does signify such as have authority in the Church, or else public
reprehension in the open congregation by such as be called thereunto. It gives
not any peculiar jurisdiction to the Pastor, for any thing that I can learn.
And in the same Chapter. 18. verse, where Christ says: what soever ye bind
on earth, shall be bound in heaven, etc. according to your judgment uttered
before, it is meant of the whole Church, and not of the Pastor only. You have
before denied that one man can excommunicate, and therefore this place makes
nothing for your assertion.

T. C. Page 149. Lin. 21.
In the. 220. and. 221. pages, he speaks of this thing afresh, but has no
new matter, but makes a bare rehearsal of the places of the Admonition,
asking after his accustomed manner of confuting, what makes this, or what
proves that? only whereas he said before, and proved (as he thought) that
the Minister had only to do with excommunication, being pressed there by the
Admonition either to defend or renounce his Chauncelors, etc. He had rather
deny both the truth and himself, than he would have any of that horrible
confusion and profanation of the holy discipline of God brought in by Popery,
threatening the overthrow of the whole Church, and serving for nothing but for
the nourishing of the ambition and idleness of a few, to be driven out of the
Church. Of the which I will upon occasion speak a word, if first I show that
the use of the ancient Church has been not to permit the excommunication to
one, but that the sentence thereof should come from the governors and elders
of the Church, unto whom that did especially apperteyne. Although I cannot
posse by that which master Doctor says, that for so much as the Authors of
the Admonition had alleged the words (tell the Church) to prove the interest
of the Church in excommunication, that therefore they could not use the same
to prove the interest of the Pastor, as who should say that the Pastor is not
one of the Church. But of the absurdity of this, I have spoken sufficiently
before, and how all men do see the vanity of this reason, that because the
people have an interest by this place, therefore the Pastor has none.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do indeed speak of this matter there again after a sort: for I am driven
unto it by the order of the Admonition. But in all those words there by me
uttered, touching exco^municatio^, I do not once ask, what makes this, or
what makes that (as you charge me) although I might justly use these kind of
questions, as sufficient answers, to such unskillful quotations, as they paint
their margent with: and sometimes indeed I make such demaundes, but it is to
show the fondness of their allegations.

I defend no Chauncelors. etc. that usurp any office, whereunto they be not
lawfully called, but I would not have the Scriptures abused to confute them,
least thereby (seeing the weakness of our reasons) they be animated rather to
proceed, than persuaded to leave of. I do not think that Chauncellours ought
to excommunicate (with this kind of excommunication, that we talk of) except
they be Ministers, and so much have I uttered in my Answer: but I will not
disquiet the Church for it, by seeking reformation extraordinarily, neither
will I be wilful, if I can hear any sound reasons to remove me from this
persuasion: wherefore you do in this cause, and in this place unjustly charge
me.

The place in the eighteenth of Saint Matthew, is understood of those, to
whom the discipline of the Church, is by the authority of the Church
committed, that is in this church of England, the Bishop. And therefore that
place can not prove that there is any injury done to the Pastor, or that he
is spoiled of his lawful: jurisdiction: and this is the effect of my answer,
whereat you only cavil as your nature is.

I say in deed that this place was before alleged in the Admonition to prove
that the whole Church should excommunicate, and not one man only, and
therefore I see not, how the same place may aptly be alleged, to prove
any jurisdiction of the Pastor over his flock, seeing it gives to the flock
equal jurisdiction with the Pastor, and not to the Pastor any superiority
over them, if the interpretation used in the Admonition be true.

Let the Reader consider the words of my Answer to the Admonition: and try
whether there be any such absurdities in them or no. Surely it is a fault both
in you and the Admonitors, to make the Scripture so pliable to your fancies,
and the same place to serve as many turns as you list.

Chap. 1. the. 16. Division.
T. C. Page 149. past the middst.
But I come to show the use of the primitive Church in this matter, whereof we
have a manifest This place of Tertullian is very corruptly alleged. as will
appear*
testimony in Tertullian. If (says he) there be any which have committed
such a Tertull. in Apol. 39. c.
saulte, that he is to be put away from the partaking of the prayer of the
church, and from all holy matters or affairs, there do bear rule or be
presidentes certain of the most approved auncientes or elders, which have
obtained this honor, not by money, but by good report.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here you have separated those things which Tertullian has joined, and you
join together in one sentence that which Tertullian has separated, for thus
he writes: And it is a great argument and example of the latter judgment,
if any man Tertull. in Apolog. cap. 39.
has so offended that he is banished from the communication of prayer, of
company, and of all holy affairs. Here Tertullian makes a full point: and
beginning a new sentence he says: Approved seniors have authority to rule,
which have obtained this honor, not by money, but by a good report. etc. And
these words be so distinguished from the other, that B. Rhenanus places his
commentary betwixt them. And yet you join them with a piece of the former
sentence, which you have also mangled: and so make as though Tertullian
should say, that these Seniors did excommunicate, where as there can no
such matter be gathered of his words. For there were other points of
Discipline for them to execute, and other matters of gouernmente to look unto.
And he that shall well weigh the words of Tertullian, shall perceive that he
means by these approved elders, none other but ministers which do govern
the congregation, when they come together to prayer, and other holy actions,
the whole order whereof, he does in that place describe.

But be it, that they had to do also in excommunication (which I will not
deny) for I did never so give the authority of excommunicating to the Bishop
alone, that The Bishop may have assistance joined with him.
I think he may not have other assistance joined unto him for the execution of
it, (if the order of the Church so require:) yet this proves not, but that
the Bishop may excommunicate alone, if that authority be given unto him by
the order of the church. This place rather makes against you, for first it
is like, that these Seniors were ministers of the word and Sacraments: then
it is certain that the multitude had not to do in the execution of this
Disciplyne, which you labor to prove. There can no great certaynetie be
gathered of this place, whether one or more did excommunicate: except you will
also conclude that Churchewardens and sydemen (because they be officers to see
good rule kept in the Church) have interest in excommunications, together with
the Bishop. Wherefore I do require a more manyfeste proof of you: For this
place may with more probability be otherwise expounded, and therefore
enforces nothing.

Chap. 1. the. 17. Division.
T. C. Page 149. toward the end.
And that the Auncientes had the ordering of these things, and the peoples
consent was required, and that if the case were a very difficulte case, it
was referred unto the Synodes or Counsels, and that the ministers did not take
upon them of their own authority to excommunicate, and that those which did
receive the excommunicate without the knowledge and consent Lib. 3. ep. 8. 10.
14. 19. 1. lib. 3. ep.
of the church were reprehended, it may appear almost in every page of
Cyprians Epistles, and namely in these, which I have noted in the margent.

Io. Whitgifte.
Thus you drive me to seek that which in those Epistles by you quoted, I can
not find, how much better dealing had it bin to have set down the words
of Cyprian, that they might have been viewed and considered.

In the. 8. Epistle of the third book, Cyprian does find himself greened
with one Therapius, because he gave peace to one Uictor a Priest, before he had
showed himself fully repentant, and had satisfied for his offense: before also
the time was come appointed unto him to make satisfaction, likewise without the
request and knowledge of the people. Whereby it appears that Therapius did
absolve Uictor before the time appointed, and secretly without the knowledge
of the people: but this proves not your purpose. Therapius is justly reproved
for breaking the order appointed by the Church, and for absoluyng Uictor
before his time, and in a corner, without the knowledge of the people: but this
proves not that the Bishop may not excommunicate: but the contrary rather,
for Cyprian in the end thought this absolution to be sufficient, as it
appears in these words. But weyghing the matter by long advise, it seemed
sufficient to chyde our fellow Lib. 3. epi. 8.
Therapius, for that he did this thing unadvisedly, and to have instructed
him that hereafter he commit not the like. But yet we thought not good to
withdraw the peace which was once given, (howesoeuer) of a Priest of God: and
for this cause we have permitted unto Victor, to use the Communion delivered
unto him. Whereby it is manyfeste, that the absolution of Therapius was
thought good, and that he had authority to absolve alone, but that it was
done not according to the order then in the church appointed.

In the tenth Epistle there is nothing spoken of Excommunication or absolution:
Epist. 10.
only Cyprian says, that he made no answer to the Letters of Donatus and
Nouatus, and Gordius, because at his first entrance into his Bishopryke, he
had determined to do nothing without their Council, meaning the Priests, and
Deacons to whom he writ, and without the consent of the people. What can you
conclude hereof touching excommunication? Cyprian here shows him self to
have jurisdiction over other Churches, and authority over other Ministers, and
that he will do nothing in doubtful matters in their churches, without the
consent of the ministers and people. But this is nothing toiuchng
excommunication, neither does it prove but that he might do things without
their consentes, for why should he else say: statui: I have determined:
signifying thereby, that it was in his power to do otherwise if he would.

In the. 14. Epistle he reproves certain Priests, for receyuyng into the
church Epist. 14.
without the consent of their Bishop, such as had fallen in the time of
persecution, and that before they had any just trial of their repentance,
adding that none ought so to be received, but Per manus impositionem Episcopi
and Cleri: by the imposition of the hands of the Bishop and Clergy. I can
not see any thing in this Epistle, that gives the people any interest in
excommunicating or absoluyng. But this is evidently to be collected out of it,
that no such thing ought to be done without the authority of the Bishop.

In the. 19. Epistle he writes, that he will not take upon himself alone to
restore Epist. 9.
those to the Church again, who falling in the time of persecution, were
condemned by the judgment of all the Clergy. I know not how you will frame
this to your purpose: for who ever denied but that the Synodes might
excommunicate? and who will grant, that such as be orderly and lawfully
excommunicated by many, should be absolved and reconciled only by one: and
yet in that they desire this at Cyprians hands alone, it argues, that the
manner was at that time for one man to absolve: but Cyprian refused to do it,
for that it was a common cause, and they had bin Excommunicated by the common
consent of the Clergy.

In the third Epistle of his first Book, I find nothing that makes for
you, or against me, wherefore you must take the pains to recite his words,
before you Lib. 1. epist. 3.
can deserve any credit. Thus whylest you would seem to say much, you do
but abuse the Reader, and in the end say nothing perteining to the
controversy.

In Augustines time it appears also, that the consent of the Church was
required: for in 3. Lib. contra epi. Parmen.
the third book against the epistle of Parmenian, he shows that if the
multitude of the church be not in that fault, for which one is to be
excommunicated: that then it helps much to make the party both afraid and
ashamed, that he be excommunicated or anathematised (as he calls it) by
all the church, and in his books de Bap. contra Donatistas, in diverse places,
he is so far from permitting the excommunication to one man that he seems
to fall into the other extremity, which is to make the estate of the church
to popular, and the people to have to great a sway. For there he shows, that
if the most of the people be infected with the fault, which is to be
punished by excommunication, that then no excommunication ought to be
attempted, for An untruth.
because a sufficient number of voices will not be obtained for the
excommunication. By which testimonies, besides the institution of God, and the
practice of the churches in the Apostles times, appears manifestly what has been the use of the churches touching excommunication, as long as there was any
purity in the church.

Io. Whitgifte.
Augustine in that third book contra epistolam Parmeniani, says, that he
would have When excommunication should be used.
excommunication then used, when the use thereof can make no schism in the
church. that is, when the crime for the which a man is excommunicated, is
such, as al men for the most part, do abhor and detest: so that the
offender can not have so many Aug. lib. 3. contra episto. Parm.
fautours as are able to make a schism in the church: for then (says S.
Augustine) may this discipline be executed without the breach of peace and
unity, and without the hurt of the people, when the multitude of the
congregation of the church is free from that crime, that is excommunicated. For
then (the multitude) help rather the Bishop reproving, than the wicked party
resisting, than it profitably absteineth from his company, so that no man does
so much as eat with him, not for raging envy, but for brotherly correction
and then also is the party himself stricken with fear, and healed through
shame, when as (seeing himself accursed of the whole church) he can find no
companions amongst the multitude, with whom he might rejoice in his sin, and
insult over good men.

Whereby it is evident that S. Augustine means him to be excommunicated of the
How ye whole church is said to excommunicate.
whole church, not whom the whole church does ex officio excommunicate, but
whose Excommunication the whole Church does well like of, whose fact the
whole Church does deteste, and whose company and fellowshippe the whole
Church does avoid and eschew. Surely if a man mark the words of Augustine
diligently, he may well perceive that Saint Augustine gives Ius
excommunicandi, to the Bishop: for else why should he say, that when the
people be free from that crime: they rather help the Bishop correctyng, than
the wicked person resistyng: But the discrete Reader may soon understand how
far Saint Augustine is in this place from confirming your assertion.

S. Augustine writes seven books De baptism contra Donatistas, and will you
not vouchesafe to name one of them unto me? nor yet to recite his words, that I
might know whereupon you ground this popular kind of government falsely
ascribed unto him? it may be that Augustine in your understanding, attributes
more to the people than he does in deed: and it is not unlike, but that lack
of diligent reading has driven you into this judgment of him. But I will
give you a medicine How Augustine is to be understood in ascribing binding
and l^syng to the people.
for this disease, even out of these books that you name. In the sixte Book
and fourth Chapter, he seems to give authority to all Christian people to
remit and to retain sins, and these words of Christ: Si cui dimiseritis
peccata, dimittuntur ei. etc. To whom soever you forgive sins, they are
forgiven unto him. etc. to be spoken to all Christians, but he opens his own
meaning, and teaches you how to understand all such like kind of speeches:
for thus he says in the same Book and chapter. When sins are remitted
unto him that is truly converted unto God, August. lib. 6. contra Donatist.
cap. 4.
they are remitted by those, to whom he is joined by his true conversion, for
the same holy spirit does forgive them, which is given to all Saints,
joined in love among them selves, whether they know one an other corporally or
not: likewise when any man's sins are retained, they be retained of those
from whom he that has his sins retained, does separate himself by
dissimilitude of life, and wickedness of heart, whether they know him
corporally, or know him not. Here you may learn what Saint Augustine means
by his popular state, and how he is to be understood, when he says, that
either the whole Church, or the people do excommunicate, or absolve.

I would you had noted unto me, where I might find this saying of Saint
Augustine, that if the most of the people be infected with the fault which is
to be punished by excommunication, that then no excommunication ought to be
attempted, for because a sufficient number of voices will not be obtained for
the excommunication. For I promise you I can not as yet come to the sight of it
in those books of S. Augustine by you named: neither can you tell me (as I
think) where to find it: but this is your usual manner and custom.

In deed in his third book contra Epist* Parmeniani, and second chapt. he
has a place August. lib. 3. con^ ^p. Par men. cap. 2.
somethyng like to this of yours, but it is from your purpose, neither does it
tend to any such end as you allege it, for the words be these: Re vera si
contagio peccandi multitudinem inuaserit, diuinae disciplinae seuera
misericordia necessaria est, nam consilia separationis and inania sunt, and
perniti^sa, atque sacrilega, quia and impia and superba fiunt, and plus
perturbant infirmos bonos, quam corrigunt animosos malos, Verily if the
contagion of sin has infected the multitude, the severe mercy of godly
discipline is necessary, for the purpose of separation is both vain,
pernicious and sacrilegious, because they are both wicked and presumptuous,
and do more trouble the good that be weak, than correct or amend the evil
that be stubborn. Saint Augustine does not here allege this for a cause,
that sufficient voices can not be obtained for excommunication. as you
pretend: but he thinks Excommunication to be altogether in vain, where the
infection is general.

But that it may further appear the doctrine that I affirm touching the
authority Ex^mmunication by bishops proved by the practice of the primi^
church.
of Bishops in excommunicating to be true, and to have been the usual practice
of the Church in the best time and state of it: I thought good in this place
to add to my former testimonies and answers, the authority of certain
Councels, wherein the practyse of the Church does euidentely show it self.

And first to begin with the Canons attributed to the Apostles, and so often
alleged by T. C.

In the. 32. or as it is in some books the. 33. of those Canons, it is thus
decreed: Can. Apost. 32.
If any Priest or Deacon be excommunicated of his Bishop, it may not be
lawful for any other to receive him, but only the party that has separated
him, except that Bishop dye which has excommunicated him: in this Canon power
to excommunicate, and also to absolve, is in plain words committed to the
Bishop alone.

The fifte Canon of the Council of Nice speaks of this matter in these
words: Con. Nicae. can. 5.
Concerning those that are separated from the Communion, be they Clearkes or
lay men, by the Bishops which are in every province, Let the sentence
stand according to the canon which does pronounce those that are eiected of
some, not to be admitted of other. But let it be examined whether the
parties be excommunicated through the indignation, or contention, or
frowardness of the Bishop: and for this cause, that the examination may be
duly had, let there be in every Province a Synod celebrated twice in the
year. The words be manyfeste: and what need such pr^sion for to examine the
doings of the Bishop, if he had not authority to Excommunicate alone?

The sixte Canon of the Council of Antic^he is this: If any man has been
excommunicated Con. Anti^ch. Can. 6.
of his own Bishop, let him not be received of any other, before he be
absolved of his own Bishop, or shall defend himself in a Synod, and (the
Synod being persuaded) receive an other sentence. The same decree is to be
observed against lay men, and Priests and Deacons, and those that be in the
number of the Clergy: Why should the Council say? ^ee that is
excommunicated of his own Bishop. etc. if the authority and power of
excommunicatyng did not belong to the Bishop alone?

In the second Council of Carthage, Canon. 8. it is likewise determined, That
Con. Carthag. 2. can. 8.
if a Priest being excommunicated or punished by his own Bishop, shall presume
to celebrate, he shall be accurssed.

In the sixte Council of Carthage Can. 10. the same is affirmed. Con. Carthag.
6. can. 10.


In the Council holden at Sardica Can. 13. (or as it is in some ^ookes. 16.)
it is in like manner decreed: That if a De^con or a Priest, or any of the
^leargie be excommunicated Con. Sardic. Can. 13.
of his own Bishop, and shall flee to an other Bishop, understanding that he
is excommunicated of his own Bishop, he may not give unto him the communion,
dooyng thereby injury to his brother and fellow Bishop.

By all these Canons and ancient Councels it is evident, that from time to
time even in the best and purest state of the church, Bishops alone have had
authority to excommunicate.

And least T. C. should here flee to his old shifte, and newly devised
distinction, The Bishop did excommunicate alone, not as ^rator of the action.
that this is attributed to the Bishop, because he was the chief of the
action, and did moderate it, and not because the authority and power of
excommunicatyng remained in him alone, although the manifest words of the
Counsels over* throw it, and it is not to be justified by any learning or
good authority, yet that the Con. Sard.
Reader may the better understand the vanity of it, I will recite the. 14.
Canon (or can. 14.
as it is in some books the. 17. canon) of this Council of Sardica, wherein
it does plainly appear, that the Bishop alone did excommunicate. The canon is
this: If there shall be found a Bishop prone to anger (which ought not to be
in such a man) and being soon moved against a Priest or a Deacon, shall cast
him out of the church, or excommunicate him, it must be foreseen, that he be
nor rashly condemned and excommunicated: therefore let him that is cast out,
have liberty to complain to the Metropolitan of the same Province: if he be
absent, then to the next Bishop. etc. and that Bishop which has justly or
unjustly secluded him, must be content to have his doings examined, and his
sentence either confirmed or corrected, etc. What need these affections be
seared in the Bishop, if he could not excommunicate without the consent of a
Seigniorie, or of the people? For the Seigniorie might well enough withstand
this his hastynesse. Wherefore it is plain that the Bishop alone may
excommunicate.

But yet to cut off all further cauilling, I would have you to understand
that I do not so give the authority of Excommunicating to the Bishop alone,
The authority of excommunication ascrided to the Bishop not in^nite, but l^ces.
or to any one manne, that I think he may excommunicate when he list,
without just cause and due proof of the same: my meaning is not to make him
both accuser and Judge: I do not think that he ought to excommunicate any
before the party be orderly and lawfully convicted of such crime or crimes,
as are to be punished by that Censure. And that you may know that I affirm
nothing herein but the very same that Saint Augustine has affirmed before
me, The practice in Augustins time.
and to the intent the world may see that my opinion in this point is not
strange or void of sufficient authority, I will set down his words, as
I find them in his book De vtilitate and necessitate poenitentiae, and
reported of Beda in Augustinus. To. 10. ho. 50.
his Commentaries upon the first Corinth. 5. Although some things be true,
yet the judge must not believe them, unless they be sufficiently proved. And
we can forbid no man from the communion (although this prohibition be not
mortal but medicinable) except he either willingly confess it, or be accused
and convicted, either in some secular or ecclesiastical court: for who dare
take unto himself to be both accuser and judge? And this is my judgment of
the authority of Bishops in excommunicating.

The abuses crept into this Church in the executing of it, I do not defend
(as it is manyfeste in my Answer) but wish them by due order and authority
with speed reformed.

Chap. 1. the. 19. Division.
T. C. Page 150. Lin. 7.
And it is to be observed here, that both in this part of the discipline,
and also in all other parts of it (as I have showed) as in harder and
difficulter causes, things were referred unto the Synodes provincial,
national or general, as the case required: so if the elders of any Church
shall determine any thing contrary to the word of God, or inconueniently in any
matter that falls into their determination, the parties which are grieved may
have recourse for remedy, unto the elders and Pastors of diverse Churches, that
is to say unto Synods of Shires, or dioceses, or provinces, or nations of as
great or of as small compass as shall be thought conuentent by the Church,
according to the difficulty or weight of the matters, which are in
controversy, which meetings ought to be as often as can be conveniently, not
only for the decision of such difficulties which the several presoyteries
cannot so well judge of, but also to the end that common counsel might be
taken for the best remedy of the vices or incommodities which either the
Churches be in, or in danger to be in. And as those things which cannot be
decided by the eldership of the Churches, are to be reserved unto the knowledge
of some Synod of a shire or diocese, so those which for their hardness cannot
be there decided, must be brought into the Synods of larger compass, as I have
showed to have bin done in the Apostles times, and in the Churches which
followed them long after.

Io. Whitgifte.
So shall there be turbarum and contentionum satis: much unquietness: for one
or two busy Pastors, such as your schole can yield good store of, would
invent matter enough The tumultuous and dis orderly order propounded by ye
Replyer.
to trouble the whole Church: and Pastors should then be compelled to be as
much absent from their benefyces, by reason of those Synods, as they be now
upon other occasions. Lord what a tumultuous Church would this be, if this plat
for me might take place? In the mean while the Prince should be a cyphar, and
only wait to understand what kind of Religion ceremonies, and government
these Seigniories and their Synodes would prescribe unto her to mainteyne and
defend: for the must have potestatem facti only, not Iuris: she must take
laws, she must give none: she must execute whatsoever it pleases master
Pastors and their Seniors to command her, else will they stir up the whole
country against her, at the least she must be excommunicated: me thinks I
see the very beginning of a new Popedom.

Have you showed this co^fused order to have bin in ye Apostles time or in ye
primitive Church? T. C. ascribes his own devise to the Apostles.
Where have you showed it? or when will you prove it? Synodes there were
indeed: and necessary it is that when occasion serves they should be: but
your Seigniorie in every Town or parish under a Christian Prince never was,
neither is it possible that without confusion it should be, as I have before
declared. But what audacitie is this, to ascribe an order invented by your
self (upon the which, scarce three of you do agree, if you were well
examined, and in the which your self, or ever it were long, would epsy some
thing to be altered) unto the Apostles?

Of Bishops Courts, and their officers.
Chap. 2. the. 1. Division.
T. C. Page 150. Sect. 1.
These things standing in this sort, al those courts of Bishops and Archbyshops
must needs fall, which were by Antichrist erected, against this lawful
jurisdiction of eldership, as the court of faculties, and those which are
holden by Chauncellours, commissaries, officialls, and such like, the
describing of the corruptions whereof, would require a whole book, of which I
will note the principal heads and sums.

Io. Whitgifte.
And not these courts only, but all the courts in England would be devoured up
of your Seigniorie: yea each the Princes regal authority, as may appear
partly by that which is said before, and partly by that which shall follow
hereafter. For what jurisdiction will not your Seigniorie vsurp? what matters
would it not presume to determine? what degree of person would it not tread
under foot? but let us hear what you say of these courts.

Chap. 2. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page 150. Sect. 2.
First for that they enter into an office, which perteyneth not unto them, but
to every particular Church, and especially to the eldership and governors of
the Church, and therefore although they should do nothing but that which were
good, lawful and godly, yet can they not approve their labors unto men, much
less to God, putting their sickle in another man's harvest. For neither by the
truth of the word of God, does that apperteyne unto them, neither by M. Doctors
own judgment (if his yea were yea, and his nay nay) considering that he said
before, that this jurisdiction belongs to the ministers. And although it
should perteyne unto the Bishop (as he is called) to whom notwithstanding it
does not apperteyne, yet were it not lawful for him to translate this office
unto another, and to appoint one to do it, when he lists, no more than he can
appoint them to do his other offices of ministering, as preaching the word and
ministering the sacraments.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your several government by eldership in every parish, I utterly reject: as
neither justifiable by Gods word, nor any example of any church at any time,
under a Christian prince, in that manner and form by you prescribed.

The court of faculties medleth not with excommunications.

The courts of Chauncellours. etc. have many more matters to deal withal than
excommunication, for that is but one part of discipline, that they use or
ought to use, only upon an extremity, concerning the which discipline and the
ministers thereof, I am of the self same same judgment that I was before, and
my yea is yea, Gualter in.1* Cor. 5.
and my nay is nay. And yet it I will tell you what I have read since in M
Gualters commentaries upon the. 1. Cor. 5. If any would appoint some kind of
separation, or shuttyng out, which should be executed by a lawful magistrate,
and should rather be civil A kind of civil excommunication.
than ecclesiastical, we will not be against them. For the laws of our cities
also do punish them with excommunication, which are very negligent in hearing
sermons, and in the use of the Lords supper, and furthermore which do offend
the Church with their wicked life. For such if they live in the city, they are
thrown out of the fellowship of the wards or companies so that they can buy
and sell with no man: neither are they capable of any honor or public
office: But if they dwell in the country, they are kept from the use of the
common pastnres and woods. And this way is most meet for us, let other cities
and countries do that which they think to be most profitable for their people:
for so much as it is evident, that the same form of discipline cannot be
appointed and observed in all places. I wish the other removed from those
Courts, and this in the place of it. But that Bishops may lawfully use the
true ecclesiastical excommunication, I have proved before. Deny it you as often
as you will, you can show no sound reason or ground of your denial.

Chap. 2. the third Division.
T. C. Page 150. Sect. 3.
And other thing is, that in these courts (which they call spiritual) they
take the knowledge of matters which are ^eere civil, thereby not only
perverting the order which God has appointed in seuering the civil causes
from ye ecclesiastical, but A manifest untruth.
iustling also with the civil Magistrate, and thrusting him from the
jurisdiction, which apperteyneth unto him, as the causes of the contracts of
marriage, of divorces, of wills and testaments, with diverse other such like
things. For although it apperteme to the Church and the governors thereof, to
show out of the word of God which is a lawful contract or just cause of
divorce, and so forth, yet the judicial determination, and definitive
sentences of all these, do apperteine unto the civil Magistrate. Hereunto may
be added, that all their punishments almost are penalties of money, which can
by no means apperteyne to the Church, but is a thing merely civil.

Io. Whitgifte.
We give to the civil magistrate authority in ecclesiastical causes: and we
acknowledge Ecclesiastical courts executed in the prin ces name.
all jurisdiction, that any court in England has or does exercise, be it
civil or ecclesiastical, to be executed in her majesty's name and right, and
to come from her as supreme gouernoure, so far are we off from iustling with
her, or thrusting her from the jurisdiction which perteyneth unto her: neither
do we make any such distinction betwixt civil and ecclesiastical causes, as
the Pope and you do. And therefore we Who they are that iustle with the civil
magistrate.
are not they that detract any thing from the civil magistrate, but it is the
Pope and you: who both thrust him from the jurisdiction, that by the law of God
and all equity he ought to have in Ecclesiastical matters. God has not so
severed civil causes from Ecclesiastical, but that one man may be judge in
them both: and if it perteine to the Church to declare what is a lawful
contract, and which be the just causes of divorce, by what reason can you prove
that the judicial determination and definitive sentence of those matters, does
perteine to the civil magistrate only? For is not he most meet to judge in
these causes, which best understands them? but both this and that which
follows, you speak without reason, and therefore the custom of the Church,
and the laws appointed for the same, now also received and confirmed by the
civil magistrate, with the consent of the whole Realm, must be of greater
force than your single words.

Thirdly as they handle matters which do not apperteyne unto the Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, so those which do apperteyne unto the Church, they do turn from
their lawful institution, unto other ends not sufferable, which M. Doctor
himself does confess in excommunicating for money. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
So I do indeed: but it is the fault of the man not of the law.

Chap. 2. the. 5. Division.
T. C. Page 151. Sect. 1.
Last of all they take upon them those things, which are neither lawful for
civil nor ecclesiastical jurisdiction, nor simply for any man to do, of which
sort diverse are reckened up by the Abmonition and some confessed by M. Doctor.
I will not here speak of the unfitness of those which are chief officers in
these courts, that the most of the^ are either Papists, or bribers, or
drunkerds, (I know what I write) or Epicures and such as live of benefices and
Prebends, in England and in Irelande, doing nothing of those things which
apperteyne unto them, and of other such naughty persons, which are not only
not meet to be governors in the Church, but which in any reformed Church,
should not be so much as of the Church. I speak not of all, I doubt not but
there be some do that which they do of conscience, and with mind to help
forward the Church, which I trust will (when the Lord shall give them more
knowledge) keep themselves in their vocations, and being men, for their gifts
apt and able either to serve the Church or the common wealth, in some other
calling, will rather occupy their gifts there, than where they have no ground
to assure themselves, that they do please God.

Io. Whitgifte.
For as much as you refer us to the Admonition to know what these things be
that Chancellours. etc. take upon the^, being lawful neither for civil nor
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, I will also refer you to my Answer made to that
part of the Admonition.

Your slanderous and opprobrious speeches against the men (having little to
say A taste of the Repliers divinity.
against their offices) they must take in good part until you come forth
namely to accuse them: but I am sorry that they (being as you say such
persons) shall have little occasion to be persuaded to amendment of life by
you, whom they see as factious in religion, as they are peevish in condition:
as corrupt with affections, as they be with bribes: as deep in spite and
malice, as they be in drunkenness: What divinity call you this, thus to
libell against men in authority, whom you dare not accuse to their faces? I
defend them not if there be any such, nay I wish them severely punished: but you
utter nothing less than the fruits of divinity, and I would have you come
forth to accuse them. Touching their benefices and prebendes, they will defend
themselves by the examples of your adherentes: whereof some have shaken off the
ministry, and yet keep their Prebends, some misliking the state of this
Church, crying out of the Canon law, the Court of faculties. etc. take
notwithstanding all the benefyte thereby that they can, some of them reteyning
two, some 4. etc. and yet do full little duty, nay raze up rather than plant.

But why do I fall into this vain, which I mislike in you? I am thereunto
forced by your intolerable outrageousnesse, the which howsoever I suffer
against my self, yet may I be bold something to say unto you, thus swelling
and raging against other.

Admonition.
These Seniors then, because their charge was not overmuch, did execute their
office in their own persons, without substitutes. Our lord Bishops have their
under officers, as Suffraganes, Chauncellours, Archdeacons, Officials,
Commissaries, and such like.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 117. Sect. 2. 3. 4.
You barely affirm without any proof, that these Seniors then Of substitutes
or vicares.
did execute their offices in their own persons without substitutes: but your
bare word is not of sufficient credit, although I think you will make a great
difference betwixt Seniors and Bishops: for they whom you call Seniors had no
authority to preach, or to minister the Sacraments as Bishops have.

That Bishops might have substitutes and had so, it is manifest in the. 13.
Canon. Ancyrani Concilij, which was about the year of our Lord three hundred
and eight, and before Nicene council, where we read on this sort: Vicarijs
Episcoporum (quos Graeci Chorepiscopos vocant) non licet vel presbyteros
Council. Ancyran.
vel diaconos ordinare, sed nec presbyteris Ciuitatis, sine Episcopi praecepto,
amplius aliquid ordinare, nec sine authoritate literaru^ eius in vnaquaque
parochia aliquid agere. It is not lawful for Bishops substitutes, (whom the
Grecia^s do call fellow Bishops or coadiutors) to order either priests or
Deacons, neither is it lawful to the priests of the city, without the Bishops
authority to command any thing else, or without the authority of his letters
to do any thing in any parish.

It is manifest hereby that Bishops then had Deputies, whether you will call
them Chauncellours, Commissaries etc. the matter is not great. To contend for
the name, when the thing is certain, is a note of a contentious person.

T. C. Page 151. Sect. 1.
Now I will take a short survey of that which M. Doctor alleges to prove
his offices of M. of faculties, Chauncellours etc. First he says in the. 117.
page out of the Ancyran council, that there were vicares of Bishops, where
although the name be not found of Chancellours. etc. yet there is (says he)
the office. What vicar S. Paul's Bishop may have and in what case, I have
showed before, where I have proved the necessary residence of every Pastor in
his flock. But I will note here how M. Doctor does go about to abuse his Reader
in these vicares. And first where there were three editions, of which one only
makes mention of these vicares, he took that and left the other, which is to
be observed, for that this variety of editions rose of the diverse
understanding of the Greek word ((...)) which may be taken either for him that
is bishop for another and in his place, or for him that is Bishop in the
country, that is in some town which is no city, so that Chorepiscopus, was
opposed unto the Bishop which was of some city. And if it be so taken, then
here is no proof for the vicares of Bishops. But howsoever it be, it shall
appear that the names of Chauncellours, and Chorepiscopos do not so much
differ, as the offices and functions of them. For it appears in the same
council and Canon, An untruth, for there is no such thing in that canon nor
council.
that they were like the. 70. disciples, that they had also some care to
provide for the poor, and that they were such as did minister the sacraments.
And in another council they have authority given them to make Antioch cap. 10.
Subdeacons, exorcists, and readers. I know this was a corruption of the
ministry, but yet all men see, how M. Doctor looks as it were a far of
upon things, and therefore takes a man for a ^olehill, when he would make us
believe that these were Chancellours. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
My purpose is to prove that which the Admonition denies, that is, that
Bishops had their substitutes, call them by what name you will: neither do I
speak either of the names, or office of Chauncellours in that place, but I
reprove the Authors of the Admonition of ignorance, for saying that Bishops
had then no substitutes.

You have showed nothing hitherto which proves that Bishops may have no
substitutes, but you have declared rather the contrary, as it is by me in that
place noted.

How I abuse the reader in these vicares, and what choice I make of these three
editions, (...) Bishops vicares.
let the Authors of the Centuries judge: who speaking of the same matter Cent.
4. cap. 7. write thus: Episcoporum vicarios Canones conciliorum Ancyrani
Neocaesariensis and Antiocheni (si quam fidem habent) Chorepiscopos nominant.
etc. The canons of the counsels of Ancyra, Neocaesarea, and Antioch (if they
bear any credit) do call Cent. 4. cap. 7.
the vicares of Bishops Chorepiscopos, which word also is extant in the. 54.
epist. of Basile And Sozom. lib. 2. cap. 14. calls one Maureandas
Chorepiscopum of Bicoris Bishop of the Persians. M Calvin in his Instit. cap.
8. Sect. 52. is of the same judgment. Every College (says he) only for the
preservation of order Calvin.
and concord, was subject to one Bishop, which did so excel the rest in
dignity, that notwithstanding, he was subject to the company of brethren. But
if the circuit which was under his Byshopricke was larger, tha^ that he could
sufficiently perform the office of a Bishop in all places, there were priests
appointed in certain places thorough the country which supplied his room in
smaller matters. These they called Chorepiscopos, because through the province
they represented the Bishops.

You may therefore now understand, that I have not gone about to abuse the
Reader by using this word Uicares, but rather that your self did not, or
would not understand what was meant by this word Chorepiscopus.

You say it appears in the same council and Canon, (meaning the council of
Ancyran and 13. Canon) that they were like the. 70. disciples, that they had
also some care to protude for the poor, and that they were such as did
minister the sacraments: and yet there is not one word of this in that Canon or
in that council: whereby it appears that some man has deceived you with
his collections, and that you have not read the Canon or the council your
self. The Canon I have reported wholly and truly, in my Answer to the
Admonition. Let the Reader measure your great skill and reading, by such
gross errors. Indeed in the council of Neocaesarea and. 13. Canon: there
are the like words to be found.

All that which you speak to prove that the office of these Chorepiscopi, does
differ from the office of Chauncellours is needelesse: (although it is no good
reason to says they differ in some points, Ergo, they agree in no points) my
purpose only in this place is to prove against the Admonition (as I have said)
that bishops had substitutes, which being granted, it will soon fallout that
they may as well have Chauncellours.

discreet, the Lord increase the number of them: but on the other side you
must know, that some there be (and that not the smallest number) that think
better of themselves than they deserve: And I suppose that no man will deny
the most part to be unfit for such functions: and that even of those that are

there are other things also necessarily required in such as take upon them the
government of others: except you will say with the Anabaptists, Christianis non
est opus magistratu: Christians have no need of a magistrate. There may be
therefore in every Church, wise, learned, and discreet men, in matters
perteyning to themselves, and to their own salvation, and yet not meet to

(...) besides that the choysest are to be taken to this office, this ought not

quaue^ire, and poisoned plash of all the abominations that do infect the whole
Realm. We speak not of licenses granted out of this Court, to marry in
forbidden times, as in Lent, in Aduent, in the gang week, when ban^ers and
belles, with the Priest in his surplesse, singing Gospels and making crosses,
raungeth about in many places, upon the ember days and to forbidden persons,
and in exempt places. We make no mention of licenses, to eat white meat, and

with money, nor we say nothing how dearly men pay for them. ^s for dispensations
with beneficed voyes, tollerations for non reudents, bulls to have two
benefices, to have three, to have more, and as many as they list or can get,
these are so common, that all godly and good men are compelled with grief of
heart, to cry out upon such abominations. We omit excommunication for money,
absolution for the same, and that by absoluing one for another, which how
contrary it is to the Scriptures, the complaints of many learned men by
propositions in open schools proposed, by wrytings in printed books set out,
and by preaching in open (...), have been sufficiently witnessed. To conclude,
this ^ilthie Court has full power, together with the authority of this petty
Pope, Metropolitan and primate of all England, to dispense in all causes
wherein the Pope was wont to dispense, under which are contained more cases and
causes, than we are able to reckon. As for my Lords grace of York, we deal
not with him. We refer him to that learned Epistle which Beza wrote unto him
about these matters.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 228. Sect. 1. 2. and page 229.
I think this Court to be necessary for the state of this Church and Realm:
and if there be abuses in it, either in the law it self, or in the persons, I
wish it were reformed. But the whole order of the Court is not therefore to be
condemned, no more than it is of other Courts, which cannot be missed, and yet
have abuses in them. I confess my self to have little experience in such
matters, and therefore I will speak the less thereof.

As I do mislike that there should be any time forbidden to marry in (for that
can have no good meaning) or any dispensations for boys to keep benefices, or
excommunications and absolutions for money, for one man to be absolved for
another, and if there be any other such like abuse: so do I utterly condemn
your unseemly and unchristian terms, as filthy quauemire, poisoned plash of
al abhominatio^s, filthy Court, especially considering whereof they be spoken,
to whom, and by whom: they argue a scolding nature, and a stomach boiling with
contempt of laws The Church ^aundered by the Admonitors.
and superiors. Neither can I suffer you to slander not that Court, but this
Church, with manifest untruths, as you do when you say that banners, belles,
and making of crosses, be allowed to be used in the gangweeke, and that the
Archbishops court has full power to dispense in all causes, wherein the Pope
was wont to dispense: which both be most untrue. I think in dispensations this
Court goes no further, than the laws of the Realm do permit.

Agreeable to this spirit is your co^temtuous speech, used to both the
Archbishops, me^ to be reuere^ced not only in the respect of their years and
authority, but of their singular wisdom, gravity, learning, and sound
religion also. Howbeit you reverence them, as you do all other that be in
authority, except some, whom you do but seek to use, to bring your intentes
to pass, I will say no more.

I think you have abused master Beza with your false reports, Beza and
others ^used by salse information^.
which has caused him to write otherwise than he would do, if he knew the
whole state of the controversy: So you have also abused other notable learned
men, and caused them to write, according to yourfansie, which since that time
(being truly informed) have by their letters (which are to be seen) both
condemned your co^tentiousnesse, and their own to much credulity. But our
faith and Church, dependes neither upon M. Beza, nor any other man, neither do
they look for any such prerogative. But still you are without the book.

T. C. Page 152. Sect. 1.
In the. 228. page he thinks the Archbishops Court necessary, but brings
no reason, and further confesses himself ignorant of the estate of it, and
therefore I know not from whence that good opinion of his should come, unless
it be from thence, that he likes of al things be they never so evil which the
Admonition misliketh. The rest which M. Doctor has of this matter, is nothing
else but great and high words. And as for the Canon law, it is known what a
stroke it bears with us, and that a few cases excep^ed, it remains in his
former effect.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have showed better reasons for it, than you have done against it as yet. For
it (...) made (...) ^e overthrown but by very strong reasons.
is a reason for me sufficient, that the Court is established by the authority
of the Prince, and the whole Realm, and fit it is, that very strong reasons
should be used, before this reason be rejected. For in matters of government,
place must be given to the governors, law makers, and to the state: except
there can be showed invincible reasons to the contrary, whereof you have not
in this place uttered one.

Chap. 1. the. 1. Division.

It was before showed that of the governors of the Church, there were some
whose charge perteyned unto the whole Church, of the which we have spoken: some
other whose charges extend but to a part of the Church, that is unto the poor,
and these are the Deacons. And as in the former part I showed there were two
kinds, so in this latter part the same is to be noted, that of those whose
charge was over the poor, some had charge over all the poor of the Church (as
those which are called Deacons) some had charge over the poor strangers, and
those poor which were sick only, and those S. Paul calls in one place
Diaconisses and in an other place widows. 16. Romans
For the Deacons did distribute unto the necessities as well of the poor

as unto the other poor of the Church. And the widows did employ their labors
to she washing of the feet of ye strangers, and attending upon the poor which
were sick, and had no friends to keep the^.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is no great matter in all this, saving only that I would gladly learn
where the office of widows and Diaconesses is restreyned to poor strangers
only, and such as be sick: feeing that the other poor, that be neither
strangers nor sick, may need their help in sundry things as well as they:
and seeing also that neither in the. 16. to the Romans nor in the. 1. Tim. 5.
(which you quoted in the margent) there is any such restraynt made, or to be
gathered, but the contrary almost in express words.

Touching Deacons though their names be remaining, yet is the office foully

and idle vagabonds. Now it is the first step to the ministry, nay rather a
mere order of Priesthood.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 118. Sect. 2.
In the whole. 12. Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, there is More
perteyneth to the office of Deacons, than provision for the poor.
not one word to prove the office of a Deacon to consist in gathering alms,
and distributing the same, neither yet does he speak there of the office of a
Deacon, no more does he in the third Chapter of the second Epistle to the
Thessalo. Lord God what mean you thus to play with the Scriptures?

T. C. Page 152. Sect. 2.
First I will speak of the Deacons, and whereas M. Doctor cries out of
daliying with the scriptures for alleging the. 8. verse of the twelfe unto the
Romans, to prove Deacons, affirming that there is no word of them? Truly I
can find no words to set forth this so gross ignorance. And had it not been
enough, for master Doctor to have uttered this ignorance, but he must also with
an outcrie proclaim it, and as it were spread the banner of it? What do these
words note (he that distributeth in simplicity) but the office of the
Deaconship: for in that place S. Paul reekeneth vy all the ordinary and
perpetual offices of the Church, as the office of the Doctor, of the Pastor,
of the Deacon, of the elder, and leaves not out so much as the widow, which he
notes in these words (showing mercy.) If the Authors of the Admonition do
dally with the scriptures in this place, surely Master Calvin, Master Beza,
Master Bucer, Peter Martyr. etc. do dally with them. And shall all these be
esteemed to play with the Scriptures. And Master Doctor only to handle them
seriously?

Io. Whitgifte.
I think rather this clause: he that distributeth, let him do it with
simplicity, is Romans 12. 8.
spoken to such as be able to help the poor, that they should do it willingly
and simply for Christ's sake, not for vain glory, or any other like respect.
For the whole scope of that Chapter is to move such as believe in Christ to
good life, and conversation, neither does the Apostle speak of the Ministers
of the Church only, but of all Christians of what vocation or calling so ever
they be. And therefore this sentence being general and spoken to all of
ability, it may also include Deacons, but I see not how it can be particularly
restreyned to them. Origin upon this place says: The Origin. in. 12. Romans
Apostle says that he which gives, and bestows any thing upon the poor,
must do it in simplicity of heart, that is, that he seem not to benefit the
poor, and in heart seek the praise of men. Wherefore it is not simplicity,
if one thing seem to be done outwardly, and in heart another be sought for.
Chrysostom likewise expounding these words Chrysostom. in 12. Romans
says: It suffices not to give, but it must also be done bountifully. etc. So
does the Greek Scholiast, Theodorete, Theophilact, Ambrose, Hierome: all these
do understand this place, not of the Deacons, who distribute other men's alms,
but of such as give alms themselves, and relieve the poor with their own
substance.

Master Bullinger also does admit, and well allow this interpretation.
Wherefore you see, that I have good ground of my saying, when I said that he
did not speak there of the office of a Deacon.

You say that Paul reckeneth up here all ordinary and perpetual offices of
the Church, but you speak it only, you prove it not: he speaks here of
prophesying, and you deny the office of a Prophet to be perpetual. You say
he speaks here of Wydowes, and I deny their office to be perpetual.
Moreover it is certain that he speaks in this place of gifts profitable to
the Church, and some of them common, as well to Civil as to Ecclesiastical
persons, as all learned Fathers in their Commentaryes upon this place do
confess, and so does Master Bullinger in like manner, and so I think must
all other do that well consider the drift of S. Paul in that Chapter, and the
profitable lessons, the Apostle th^re gives to all and every sort of men.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
T. C. Page 152. Sect. 2.
And as Master Doctors ignorance appears in this place, so his mind not
(...) of the truth, but seeking to cavil, does as manifestly show it self.
For all men see that the Admonition alleges not the place to the
Thessalonians to prove the office of Deacons, but to show that idle vagabonds
might not have any of that relief, which belongs unto those which be poor
in deed, which thing appears, both by the placing of the quotation over
against that allegation, and by the letter which directs thereunto.

Io. Whitgifte.
Bilike that place was only quoted for the phrase, else I see not to what end
i^ serves, except it be to prove the office of a Deacon. For to what purpose
should they note it to prove that idle vagabondes should have none of that
relief, seeing that is not denied nor yet in question.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.
T. C. Page 152. Sect. 2.
And whereas Master Doctor says that the office of the Deacons is not only to
provide for the poor, but also to preach and minister the Sacraments, I have
showed before that it both not apperteync unto them, to do either the one or
the other. For the proof whereof, this place of the Romans, quoted by the
Admonition, is very fit and most proper. For S. Paul speaks there against
those which not contenting themselves with their own vocations, did break
into that which apperteyned unto others, as it the hand should take upon it
the office of the eye, or of some other member of the body, and therefore
Saint Paul does (as it were) bound and point the lymittes of every office in
the Church, and so places the Deacons office only in the provision for the
poor. This one thing I will add to that matter, that if the Apostles which
had such excellent and passing gifts, did find themselves (preaching of the
word, and attending to prayer) not able to provide for the poor, but thought
it necessary to discharge themselves of that office, to the end they might
do the other effectually, and frutefully, he that shall do both now, must
either do none well and profitably, or else he must have greater gifts than
the Apostles had.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have proved before manifestly that it perteyned to the office of a Deacon to
Tract. 14.
preach, and to minister the Sacrament of Baptism, and to help in other
business perteyning to the Church: I have alleged both manifest examples out
of the scripture to justify the same, and the practice of the primitive Church
together with the testimonies both of the ancient and late writers: and
undoubtedly you are driven to a great straight when you are enforced to use
this place of the. 12. to the Romans to prove the contrary, for though it
were meant of Deacons, yet does it not prove in any respect your purpose:
neither can you frame any argument of it to that end. Neither Steven nor
Philip, when they being Deacons preached, and the one ministered the Sacrament
of Baptism also, did break into that which apperteyned not unto them, being
incident to their office when they be thereunto called.

The Apostles were occupied in planting Churches, in going from place to place,
to spread abroad the word of God, and therefore they could not: so
conveniently provide for the posre: but the Deacons having no such occasion of
traveling and removing from place to place, might very well both preach the
Gospel and provide for the poor. Neither can I conceive any reason to the
contrary: for I think they spent no great time in turning over many
volumes, to provide for their Sermons, because God gave to them extraordinary
gifts of knowledge, utterance, and such like, necessary for their function.
And if you speak of Deacons now, I say unto you, that under a Christian
Prince in the time of peace, that part of their Some part of the Deacons office
not so needful in the time of christian magistrates
office to provide for the poor is not necessary, seeing that by other
lawful and politic means, they may much better be provided for. Wherefore
glory as much as you will in your own wit and reason, yet in these heavenly
and divine things, your reasons shall prove but vain and untoward.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 120.
O how aptly you have alleged the scriptures to prove that every congregation
had their Deacons? In the first to the Philip. these be Whether deacons were in

the words: Paul and Timotheus, etc. to all the Saints which are at
Philippi, with the Bishops and Deacons. Paul and Timotheus salute the Bishops
and Deacons which are at Philippi: Therefore in those days every congregation
had their Deacons: a strange kind of reasoning: you might well have thus
concluded, Ergo at Philippi there was Deacons: But surely this argument is to
much out of Unapt arguments.
square, there was Deacons at Philippi, therefore every congregation had their
Deacons.

In the. 13. of S. John. verse. 27. these be the words. And after the soppe,
Satan entered into him, then said Jesus unto him, that thou do, do
quickly. After Supper Satan entered into Judas, and Jesus said unto him, that
thou do, do quickly: Therefore every Congregation had their Deacons. No
marvel though your margent be pestred with Scriptures, when you take liberty
to make ex quolibet quidlibet. Peradventure you mean that Judas was a Deacon
(as he was not, but an Apostle) because he carried the bag, and that some of
the Apostles thought, that Christ had bid him give some what to the poor:
belike whosoever gives a penny to the poor at his masters commandment, is
with you a Deacon.

In the sixth of the Acts we learn that there were chosen seven Deacons, but
there is not one word to prove, that every congregation had their Deacons.

In the third of the first to Timothy S. Paul shows what qualities and
conditions a Deacon ought to have, but not one word of Deacons being in every
Congregation. This is great audacitie, thus manifestly to wring the Scriptures,
without all color or show of reason.

T. C. Page 152. Sect. vlt.
The second point is touching that there were Deacons in every Church, which is
well proved of the Admonition, both by the place of the Philippians, and of the
Acts, for although it be not there said, that the deacons were in every church,
yet for so much as the same use of the^ was in all Churches which was in
Jerusalem and at Philippes, and for that the Apostles (as has been before
touched) laboring after the vniformitte of the Church, ordained the same
officers in all Churches, the proof of one is the proof of all, and the
showing that there were Deacons in one Church, is the showing in all. The place
which they allege out of the first to Timothe, is of all other most proper^
for S. Paul there describing not how the Church of Ephesus, but simply and
generally how the Church must be governed, reckeneth there the order of
Deacons, whereunto may be added the continual practice of the Church long
after the Apostles times, which appears by the often superscriptions and
subscriptions in these words: the Bishop, Elders, and Deacons, of such a
Church, and unto the Bishops, Elders, and Deacons of such a Church. And by that
it is so oftentimes said in the councels where the Churches assembled, that
there were so many Bishops, so many Elders, so many deacons.

Io. Whitgifte.
And I say again, that they be most unapt reasons: for the Deacons office was
not so troublesome, but that the Deacons of one City, might serve all the
Churches and congregations belonging unto the same: neither have you read
either in scripture, or any ancient writer (except I be greatly deceived) that
Deacons were placed any where, but in Cities: and yet it is not to be thought,
but that there were Churches also, in meaner Towns. And surely no man without
blushing can defend this argument: there were Deacons at Jerusalem, and at
Philippos, Ergo there were in every congregation Deacons. It is like unto
this: there be Preachers in Cambridge and London: therefore in every parish in
England, there be preachers.

This is also untrue, that the Apostles ordained the same officers in all
Churches. For in chief and principal Cities they ordained Bishops to guide
and gouerns the rest of the ministers, which were in towns belonging to those
cities, as it is manifest by the examples of James, Timothy, and Titus, but
they did not ordeyne any such Bishops in every congregation: for further proof
of this, I refer the reader to that Tract. 8.
which I have spoken of Archbishops and Bishops.

The first to Timothy, the third, is as violently wrested to serve their
purpose. For S. Paul does not speak one word there of Deacons, being in
every congregation, only he tells what manner of man they ought to be. And
you are not able to show (as I have said) by the practice of the Church, that
there were Deacons in every congregation. These superscriptions and
subscriptions that you talk of, were then used, when letters were sent to the
Bishop, Ministers, and Deacons of chief Cities, where all these commonly
remained: and therefore cannot prove that every congregation had their
Deacons. The Deacons named in Councels were resident in Cities, not in every
congregation.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 121. Sect. 2.
I am sure you are not offended that there be Deacons in Cathedral Churches:
for if they ought to be in every Congregation, they ought to be there also: and
yet I know no such order now in Cathedral Churches, that they be more bound
to Deacons in the respect of reading the Gospel, than other Churches be: But

been.

T. C. page 153. Sect. 1.
The third point in this Deaconshyp is, whether it be a necessary office in
the church or for a time only, which controversy should not have been, if M.
Doctors English tongue had been agreeable with his latin. For in a certain
latin pamphlet of his, whereof I spoke before, he makes the Deaconship a
necessary office and such as ought not to be taken out of the church: here he

sings an other song, there, because he thought the necessity of the Deacon
made for him, he would needs have Deacons: here, because it makes against
him, he says there is no need of the^, whereby appears how small cause
there is that M. Doctor should vpbrayde the authors of the Admonition with
mutabilitie and discord with them selves. But that this office is durable and
perpetual, it may appear by that which I have alleged before out of the fixed
of Timothy, for the necessity of Elders, for the arguments serve to prove
the necessity of those orders which are there set forth, whereof the Deacon
is one.

Io. Whitgifte.
The only thing that is spoken in that latin book, touching the continuance
of Deacons in the Church, is this, that they are not mentioned in the fourth
to the Ephesians, and yet they may not be taken out of the Church. In my
Answer to the Admonition, I say that this part of the office of a Deacon
which consists in providing for the poor, is not so necessary now as it was
in the Apostles time. My english tongue agrees very well with my latin
tongue, for any signification of dissension that is here uttered. I am fully
persuaded that the office of a Deacon is to be retained in the church, for it
is a degree to the ministry, which consists in Preaching, Baptizing, and
helping the ministers in other functions of the church, as I have showed. But
yet I say that this part of the office, which consists in providing for
the poor, is not so necessary under a Christian prince, when better provision
is made, as it is under a Tyrant and in time of persecution. Therefore I sing
one and the self same song, but you would gladly espy out the contrary if it
were possible.

To your allegation out of the sixte of Timothy, I have answered fully: it is

Admonition.
And yet least the reformers of our time should seem utterly to take out of
Gods church this necessary function, they appoynte some thing to it concerning
the poor, and that is, to search for the sick, needy, and impotent people of
the paryshe, and to intimate their estates, names, and places where they dwell
to the Curate, that by his exhortation they may be relieved by the Parish, or
other convenient alms. And this you see is the nyghest part of his office,
and yet you must understand it to be in such places where there is a Curate
and Deacon: every paryshe cannot be at that cost to have both, nay, no
paryshe so far as can be gathered, at this present has.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 122. Sect. 1.
And what fault can you find herewith, is not this greatly to be commended?
If every paryshe can not be at the cost to have both Curate and Deacon, why
do you require them both in every parish? why do you not think well of such
laws as appoynte Collectours for the poor, which may as well provide for
them and better to, than could the Deacon, who must be sustained him self
with that which the poor should have.

T. C. Page 153. Sect. 1.
And whereas M. Doctor says, that every church is not able to find a Curate
(as he terms him) and a Deacon, I have before showed, intreatyng of the
Seniors, that the churches in the Apostles times might best have said this,
being poor and persecuted, although I see not why the church may not have a
Deacon or Deacons if mo be needful, with as small charges as they may have a
collector or collectors.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is the Admonition that says, Every paryshe cannot be at that cast to
have both. Whereupon I do but ask this question, why they require them both
in every paryshe, if every paryshe cannot be at the cost to have them both?
Bylike you make small account of the Admonition, in that you read it not, or
else you have forgotten that this question is demanded upon their confession.
But in deed I am of that opinion too, and have before answered your objection
of the Churches in the Apostles times, as for our Collectors, they be such as
put not the Church to one halfepenye charge, so could not your Deacons do.

necessity so require) minister the other Sacrament, likewise read the holy
Scriptures and homilies in the congregation, instruct the youth in the
Catechism, and also preach, if he be commanded by the Bishop.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 119. Sect. 2.
I know not what you mean by your Ponti. tit. in the margent of your book,
but if you mean the book entitled, the form and manner of making and
consecrating Bishops, etc. now allowed in this Church of England, then do
you untruly report it, for there is no mention of baptising in the presence
of a Bishop or Priest, neither yet of ministering the other Sacrament in their
absence if necessity require: only the book says, that a Deacon may
baptize or preach, if he be thereunto admitted by the Bishop, and that he may
so do by the word of God I have proved before. As for reading the holy
Scriptures, and Homelies in the Congregation, also for instructing the youth in
the Catechism, who doubts but that a Deacon may do them?

office must look to his office, and every man must keep himself within the
bonds and limits of his own vocation.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 126. Sect. 2.
Neither do we confound them, and yet Paul in the place by you quoted in the
margent, speaks not one word of confounding, or not confounding these
offices: So the poor be provided for, it forces not, whether provision be
made by Deacons or by Collectours: by the one it may be well done, by the other
it cannot be done in all places, as the state is now. But show any Scripture
to prove that the poor must only be provided for by Deacons, else not.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nothing answered to this.

Of the offices of Widows and their continuance.
Chap. 2.
T. C. Page 153. Sect. 2.
There remains to speak of the Widows, which were godly poor women in the
church above the age of three score years, for the avoiding of all suspicion
of evil, which might rise ^y sclaunderous tongues, it they had been younger.
These as they were nouryshed at the charges of the church being poor, so did
they serve the church, in attending upon poor strangers, and the poor
which were sick in the church whereof they were widows. This will not agree
with the doctrine you taught before. Page 1. 41.
Now although there is not so great use of these widows with us, as there was
in those places where the churches were first founded, and in that time wherein
this order of widows was instituted, part of the which necessity grew both
by the multitude of strangers through the persecution, and by the great hear
of those east countries, whereupon the washing and supplyng of their feet was
required, yet to: so much as there are poor which are sick in every church,
I do not see how a better and more convenient order can be devised, for the
attendaunce of them in their syckenesse and other infirmities, than this which
saint Paul apoynteth, that there should be (if there can be any gotten)
godly poor widows of ye age which S. Paul apointeth which should attend upon
such. For it there be any such poor wydowes of that age destitute of all
friends, it is manifest that she must needs iyue of the charge of the church,
and seeing she must needs do so, it is better she should do some duty for it
unto the church again, than the church should be at a new charge, to find
others to attend upon those which are sick and destitute of kepers, seeing
that there can be none so fit for that purpose as those women which saint
Paul does there describe, so that I conclude, that This condition cannot agree
with so precise ^ commandment as you have made it before.
(if such may be gotten) we ought also to keep that order of widows in the
church still. I know that there be learned men which think otherwise, but I
stand upon the authority of Gods word, and not upon the opinions of men be
they never so well learned, and if the matter also should be tried by the
judgment of men, I am able to show the judgment of as learned as this age
has brought forth, which thinks that the institution of widows is
perpetual, and ought to be where it may be had, and where such widows are
found. Indeed they are more rare now than in the Apostles times. For then by
reason of the persecution, those which had the gift of continency, did
abstain from marriage after the death of their husbands, for that the sole
life was an easyer estate and less dangerous and chargeable when they were
driven to fly, than the estate of those which were married.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here you are taken in your own trappe, and feign you would wrynge your The
Replie^ tripped and caught in his own net. Page 141.
self out if you could tell which way: for if all things contained in S.
Paul his first Epistle to Timothy be perpetual, and must be kept under the
great charge that be gave unto Timothy in the sixth chapter, as you have before
affirmed, then of necessity the church must needs still reteyne wydowes. You
know not in the world how to avoid this absurdity, and therefore some
times you say, that now there is not so great use of them with us as there
was in those places where the churches were first founded. etc. and by and by
you begin to call that back and say, that you do not see how a better and
more convenient order can be devised for the attendance of them in their
sickness and other infirmities. etc. and in the end you conclude that (if such
may be gotten) we ought also to keep that order of wydowes in the church
still. Surely if it be an order appointed of God to be perperpetuall, and
contained under that denunciation to Timothy in the sixth chapter, these (ifs)
and (ands) can take no place, for there are wydowes good store in this realm
of England, so that, that excuse will not serve. But it is a world to see,
what you dare auouche be it never so untrue, contrary both to the practice of
all reformed churches that I can hear of, and judgments of all learned men
that I have read of this matter.

But if the institution of widows be so necessay, why should they not be in
every congregation as well as Deacons: for the Apostle speaks as directly of
them in his epistle to Timothy, as he does of Deacons. Again if this be a
sufficient excuse why the church has no widows, to say that they cannot be
gotten, or there is none meet, why will not the excuse serve the church for
lack of your Seniors also. etc.

Of the Authority of the civil Magistrate in Ecclesiastical mattets. Tract.

And to these three jointly, that is, the Ministers, Seniors, and Deacons, is

magistrate, me think I hear you whisper that the Prince has no authority
in ecclesiastical matters: I know it is a received opinion among some of you,
and therein you shake hands also with the Papists and Anabaptists.

T. C. Page 153. Lin. vlt. etc.
Unto all the rest until the end of the first part of the Admonition. I
have answered already, yet there is a point or two which I must touch,
whereof the first is in the. 126. page where he would bear men in hand that
the authors of the Admonition and some other of their mind, would shut out
the civil magistrate and the prince from all authority in Ecclesiastical
matters. Which surmise although I see it is not so much, because either he
knows or suspecteth any such thing, as because he means hereby to lay a
bayte to entrappe withal, thinking that where Note these speeches,
he makes no conscience to give he cares not what authority to princes, we
will be loath to give more than the word of God will permit, whereby he hops
to draw us into displeasure with the prince: yet for because he shall
understand, we nourishe no opinons secretly, which we are ashamed to declare
openly, and for that we doubt not of the equity of the prince in this part,
which knows that although her authority be the greatest in the earth, yet it
is not infinite, but is lymited by the word of God, and of whom we are
persuaded, that as her majesty knows, so she will not unwillingly hear ye
truth in this behalf, these things I say being considered, I answer in the
name of the authors of the Admonition and those some other which you speak of,
that the prince and civil magistrate VVhatreversed? no more but to see them

has to see, that the laws of God touching his worship, and touching all
matters and orders of the church be executed and duly observed, and to see that
every ecclesiastical person do that office whereunto he is appointed, and to
punish those which fail in their office accordingly. The prince spoiled of
authority to make Ecclesiastical orders.
As for ye making of ye orders and ceremonies of the church, they do (where
there is a constituted and ordered church) perteyne unto the ministers of ye
church, and to the ecclesiastical governors, and that as they meddle not with
ye making of civil laws, and laws for the common wealth: so the civil
magistrate has not to ordeyne ceremonies perteining to the church: But if
those to whom that does apperteyne make any orders not meet, the magistrate
may and ought to hinder them, and drive them to better, for so much as the
civil magistrate has this charge to see that nothing be done against ye glory
of God in his dominion.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of the Admonition page 126. be these: and fo these three jointly,
that is, the The Admoni tors and T. C. join with the Papists against the
Queens supremacy in matters ecclesiastical.
Ministers, Seniors, and Deacons, is the whole regiment of the church to be
committed. Wherefore they spoil the civil magistrate of all government in
Ecclesiastical matters: for if the whole government of the church is to be
committed to Ministers, Seniors, and Deacons, what authority remains to the
civil magistrate in the government of it? Agreeable to this disobedient spirit
and erroneous and Papisticall doctrine, is that in the second Admonition Fol.
8. and. 9. where the authors of that book take from the civil magistrate all
supremacy in Ecclesiastical matters, and by evident circumstances, call his
authority used in those things usurped. page 57. they say, only mere civil
laws are to be made. And here in this place T. C. in express words takes
from the civil magistrate, all authority of making and appointing (...)
orders and ceremonies of the church, and gives the same only to ministers
and eccle^asticall gouerne^rs, he makes it the princes duty to see those
^awes executed which these eccle^asticall governors shall appoynte and
prescribe: and in his Preface he says that eiuill persons may not handle
ecclesiastical matters and Page 35. and. 145. ye the civil magistrate may not
be the head of the church in that common wealth whereof he is the head. Where
by (as I suppose he means (...)

54. he denies that the magistrate ought to prescribe what kind of apparel
ministers should (...). In diverse places, he makes such a distinction betwixt
the church of Christ, and a Christian common wealth yt has a Christian
magistrate, as he would do betwixt the church and a Heathenishe common wealth,
yt has a persecuting and an unbelieving magistrate, and separateth the common
wealth of England, as far from the church of England as he can do the
common wealth of Turcia, from the church of Christ in Turcia: all this I have
noted to this end, that the good subject and those that be careful for the
preservation of the state of this Realm, and the lawefull authority of her
Majesty, may the better consider and beware of this doctrine, the which
unless I prove to be the self same with the Papists in substance, let me
sustain that punishment that is due unto them whom I burden and charge with
forgetfulness of duty in this point.

Saunders in that traiterous book of his, writes thus. That has deceived
many, Saunders and the Rep^er agree.

manner, saying: That the godly Magistrate is the head of the common wealth,
but not of the church, meaning that particular church contained in the common

Christian Magistrate is but only a member of that particular church. And page

this place he would have the civil Magistrate no more to intermedle with
making Ecclesiastical laws and orders, than the ecclesiastical minister
should deal with civil: diverse such nippes and pinches he has at the civil
Magistrate: speaking no other wise of him than of a Turk or a Jew, and giving
him no more authority in the church of Christ and over Christians, than if
he were the great Turk, or wicked Nero. But I answer them both with the
words of M. Musculus in his common places Titu. de Magistratu. Let Ethnickes
and infidels which live not in the unity of truth, but in the confusion of
error, have their diverse laws Musculus.
and magistrates, some profane and some holy, whose whole life is profane,
whose religion is but ecclesiastical superstition and in the temple only.
Christian people are altogether hely, and dedicated to the name of Christ, not
in temples only and ecclesiastical rites, but in their whole life, in every
place at al times, in all things, in all deeds and studies, that according to
the admonition of the Apostle. 1. Cor. 10. whether he eat or drink, or
whatsoever he does all may be done to the glory of God, and Col. 3. whatsoever
he does in word or in deed, he do it in the name of the Lord. etc.
Wherefore that distinction of Ecclesiastical and profane laws, has no
place in it, because there is nothing in it that is profane, seeing it is a
people holy to the Lord God: and the Magistrate is holy and not profane, his
authority is holy, his laws are holy, his sword is holy, a revenger of the
wicked and ungodly, whereby he serves the Lord being the chief lawmaker, and
judge: our members are the members of Christ, and our bodies are the bodies of
the holy ghost: we are willed to glorify God not in our spirit only, but in
our body also 1. Cor. 6. Therefore this be sarre (...) authority Pap^ts give

from the church of Christ, that it should be partly holy, and partly profane,
holy before, and profane behind, like unto an Idol which shows beautiful

Again the Papists give to the Christian Magistrate in ecclesiastical
matters, Potestatem facti and not iuris, that is, to see those laws executed
and put in practice, that the Pope and his Clergy shall make, and to be as it
were their executioner, but not to make any laws or orders in Ecclesiastical
matters: for so writes Saunders in his book before named Fol. 64. Although I
do not deny but that the knowledge of a Saunders.
fact that belongs to the ecclesiastical law, may be committed to kings
and Magistrates, and before the ecclesiastical cause be determined, the king
may use his authority to this end, that there may be some quiet place
prepared, where the bishops shall co^sulte, and that the bishops be called to
the same place at a certain day, and that in the mean time while the matter is
in determining, common peace may be preserved even among the priests them
selves: to conclude, after the cause be determined and judged by the priests,
the king may punish him with the sword (which he carries not in vain) or by
some other corporal punishment which shall refuse to obey the sentence of the
priests. Therefore we do not deny but that kings have something to do, both
before, and at, and after the judgments of the bishops: but in the office of
judging, they have no more to do, than other private persons, for they may well
give council, and declare what they think, but they may not determine or
define what Gods laws or the ecclesiastical law does require. And does not T.

governors shall make any orders unmeet, the magistrate may drive them to
better. But what if they say they be meet, and will stand to it, as you do
now in this fond platform? will they not cry out upon the magistrate, and
say that he is a persecutour, a mainteiner of an unlawful authority, and of
that which is against the glory of God, if he withstand the^? as the authors
of the second Admonition do in plain terms, saying, For though the orders

authority should see every of these things put in practice, and punyshe those
that neglect them, making laws therefore: for the church may keep those
orders, but never in peace, except the comfortable and blessed assistance of
the states and governors imcke in to see them in their countries and used, for
otherwise the church may and must keep Gods orders, but always in troubles
and persecution which is like to light upon us, except a reformation of
religion, or a direct prouiso for us be made, for surely only this is God his
order, and ought to be used in his church, so that in conscience we are forced
to speak for it and to use it, and in conscience and in reverence of God we
are forced to speak as we do of that reformation, which we now use, not so
much for ought else, as to set out the deformities thereof, that we might
think upon the amending of them.

M. Musculus in the book and title before recited, sets out this Popish
opinion touching Musculus.
the authority of ye civil Magistrate in ecclesiastical matters briefly, but
plainly, in these words. Those whom they call Ecclesiastical persons, and
we call them Papists, will not commit to the magistrate any further authority
in religion, than to be the keeper and revenger of it, and of their
Ecclesiastical laws, that the ecclesiastical policy may remain
immouable, wherefore they deny him to have authority in that he is a
magistrate to make or to publyshe any Ecclesiastical laws, because such
things perteine to those that do represent the church, whose decrees and
constitutions must be mainteyned and defended by the authority of the
magistrate.

This I thought good to nete before I come to answering of his arguments, that
al men may understand that I no otherwise charged them in this point, than they
have well deserved, neither have I as yet detected all that they peruersly
think, of the authority of the civil magistrate: one thing I pray you
mark, that here is one note A note of Anabaptisme practiced by ye Rep^r.

Answer to the Admonition, for there I show that the Anabaptists accuse the

and there were other also appointed for the kings affairs, and for matters of

than could be applied to the use of the church, were set over civil causes,
being therefore most fit, for that they were best learned in the laws of
God, which were the polylike laws of that country. There he may learn if it
please him, that the making of orders and giving of judgments in civil and

behold something perteyned to the Bishop, other somethinges to the office of a

Lord of Sarisburie, fol. 118. of the defense of the Apology of the Church of
England, from whom I believe you have borrowed it. Do I not say truly that
you iumpe with the Papists? do you not both conspire against the Civil
Magistrate? and are you not content to use their very words and reasons?
great ado there is against me, because I use a place of Cyprian for the
authority of an Archbishop over his province, which the Papists abuse for
the authority of the Pope over all Christendom: and here you use the reason
not only of Papists, but of Traitors to the same end with them: that is,
against that lawful jurisdiction, which we have given to our Prince, and
which has hitherto been maynteyned, both by preaching and by burning.

But to let this rest in the consideration of the Reader, I will in few The

words declare that this place makes flat against you: for who placed
those Levites and Priests in Jerusalem for the judgment and cause of the
Lord? or who prescribed unto them what they should do? or who gave to them
that authority? did not Iehosaphat? the text is plain. Iehosaphat had chief
authority and government both in things perteyning to God, and in things
perteyning to the common wealth, but for better execution of them, the one he
did committee to be executed by Amaria the Priest, the other by Zabadiah a
ruler of the house of Judah: even as the Queens Majesty being supreme
governor in all causes, both Ecclesiastical and Temporal, commits the
hearing and iudgyng of Ecclesiastical matters to the Archbyshops and Bishops,
and of Temporal matters to the Lord Chancellor and other judges, neither
can you any more conclude that Iehosaphat had no authority in Ecclesiastical
causes because he made Amarias the Priest judge in the same, than you can that
he had nothing to do in Temporal affairs, because he appointed also Zabadiah
to hear and determine them. For if this reason be good, the Queen of England
has nothing to do with Ecclesiastical matters, because she has made the
Archbishops and Bishops judges in them, then is this as good, her Majesty has
no authority in Civil matters, because she has committed the same to the
Lord Chancellor and other Judges. Thus you see how both the Papists and
you are deceived in one and she self same reason.

That in the fifte to the Hebrews is far from the purpose, for the Apostle
in the same sentence declares what those things perteyning to God be: Even to
offer both gifts and sacrifices for him: I think you do not so maliciously
report of us as the Papists do: that we give to the Prince power to minisier
the Sacraments, and to preach the word: if you do not, this place can by no

The continual practice of Christian Churches (in the time of Christian
Magistrates) Christian Princes have exercised su^ authority in ecclesiastical
cases. Sozomenus. lib. 1. cap. 17.
before the usurpation of the Bishop of Rome, has been to give to Christian
Princes supreme authority in making Ecclesiastical orders and laws, yea and
that which is more, in deciding of matters of religion, even in the chief and
principal points. And that book and chapter of Sozomene by you quoted
declares the same. For the Bishops that came to the Council of Nyce,
committed the hearing and determining of their controversies to the Emperor,
which argues that it was then, a common and undoubted opinion received among
them, that the Emperor had authority to judge in their causes: and although
the Emperor of modesty refused so to do, saying, that it was not meet for
them, so to use themselves, that they should be judged of other, yet I am sure
you will not make this a rule to exempt the Clergy from the jurisdiction of
the Civil Magistrate, unless you will take hold with the Pope and say, We
must judge all and be judged of none* This modesty in Constantinus (in
refusing to hear the matters in controuersis among the Bishops) excepted,
there is nothing in that first book and, 17* chapter of Sozomene, that can by
any means serve your turn.

committed the same to the Synod and Council of Nice: I answer, that therein
be nothing at all abridged his authority.* but showed his wisdom and godly
care. For it is the part of a wise and godly Prince, to have such weighty
matters of doctrine (being in controversy) decreed and determined by such, as
for their authority, wisdom and learning, are most fit to entreat of
such matters. But alas how does this argument follow: Constantinus called the
Council of Nice to determine certain matters of religion in controversy,
therefore he had no authority to make Ecclesiastical orders and laws?

What Council of Constantinople was that? if you mean the. 5. being
celebrated Justinian made many Ecclesiastical laws.
Anno. 549. in the time of Iustinianus: it is a very late testimony for this
cause, the Bishops of Rome: being then in great authority, and yet manifest it
is, that no Emperor made mo Ecclesiastical laws, both concerning matters of
order, and also of doctrine, than did the Emperor Iustinianus, as may be seen
in the Code under these Titles, De summa trinitate and fide Catholica: De
sacrosanctis Ecclesijs: de Episcopis and Clericis: de Haereticis and Manichaeis
and Samaritanis: ne sanctum Baptisma iteretur: de statuis and imaginibus, and a
number such like.

If you mean the sixth Council of Constantinople, as it like you do: then are
you without my compass: for that Council was Anno. 681. and who will allege

any authority of that corrupt time for any such matter in controversy? and
yet it is certain that Constantinus the Emperor did govern that Council
and that the Bishops on both sides did plead before him at his appointment,
himself sitting as moderator: and this was in a matter of faith. But be it as
you say (though I can find no such thing in the first Action of that
Council) does it follow that because Emperors confirmed ordinances that
were made in Synodes and Councelles, therefore they have no authority to make
Ecclesiastical laws? surely I understand not how you can make any such
conclusion, for (as I said before) it is a point of great wisdom and
singular care, to provide that weighty matters in controversy be determined
with great deliberation and advise of such as be most skillful in them. But
this can be no argument to prove that Civil Magistrates may make no orders in
the Church, or Ecclesiastical Laws: for even those orders and laws which
were made in such Councels, were made by the authority of the Emperor, as
does very well appear in the same Councels, for when the matters were
concluded in the Council of Chalcedon, the Bishops brust out into these
voices. It is a true and a right judgment: long life to the Senate: many Conc.

such Councels was given to the Emperor, and that he was esteemed as the
chief judge: which appears also at large in the second book of Euagrius.

This is an other of M. Hardinges reasons against the authority of the civil

the answer made to the same in the defense of the Apology, by that reverend

and placed Heretics in their Churches, he thought it was lawful for him to do
what him listed etc. For this cause Ambrose refused him to be his judge, so
that he did not mislike his authority in causes Ecclesiastical, but only his
wilful ignorance and his tyranny: for that he knew his judgment was
corrupted and not indifferent. And if you had marked the beginning of his
Epistle, you might have perceived that he alleges for his chief defense, and
excuse for not appearing, the decree of Theodosius the Father of Ualentinian,
so that in not coming or appearing at the Emperors summon, he did but
challenge the privilege granted before of godly Emperors unto the Clergy.

And it is evident that the learned and ancient Fathers, have committed the

Athanasius his second Apology, where he committing himself and his cause to
the Emperor, says thus: We require that the Emperors most godly and most
religious Majesty, may have the hearing of the same matter, before whom we
may open both our churches right, and also our own: for we hope that his
godliness understanding our reasons, will Athanasius Apol. 2.
never condemn us.

Likewise S. Augustine Contra Epist Parme. Lib. 1. speaking to the Donatistes,
August. contra epist. Parmen. lib. 1.
says. Is it not lawful for the Emperor or his deputy to give sentence in
a matter of religion? wherefore then went your Ambassadoures to the Emperor?
why made they him judge of their cause?

Sozomene Lib. 4. Cap. 16. says that the Emperor commanded that ten
Bishops Sozom. lib. 4. 16.
of the East, and ten of the VVeste, chosen by the Council, should repair to
his court and open to him the decrees of the Council, that he might not only
consider whether they were agreed according to the Scriptures: but that he
might further determine and conclude what were best to be done.

Socrates Lib. 5. Cap. 10. says that Theodosius the Emperor for the
appeasing Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 10.
of contention commanded an assembly of Bishops, and best learned to appear
before him, and each part to write a confession of their faith and religion:
the which being done at a day appointed, they came to the Court and delivered
up their writings to the Emperor, who after earnest prayers made, perusing
the writings that were delivered, rent in pieces the confessions, made by the
Arians, and Eunomians, and allowed only and received the confession of the
Catholics.

The practice therefore of the authority of Princes in Ecclesiastical
matters, even in determining and judging controversies in Religion, you might
have learned by these examples in Ambrose time.

And by whom can the matters and orders of the Church be better ordained than
by the ministers of the Church? And if that be a good reason of M. Doctor in
the forty and seventh Page, that the Bishops ought therefore to ordeyne
ministers, because they are best able to judge An other argu meant of the
Papists to the same purpose.
of the learning and ability, of those which are the fittest, it is also as
good reason that therefore the ministers and governors of the Church should
appoint and decree of such ceremonies and orders as perteyne to the church,
for because it is to be supposed that they can best judge of those matters,
bestowing their studies that ways, and further best understanding the state of
the church about the which they are wholly occupied.

Io. Whitgifte.
This also is a reason of M. Hardinges in the same cause, but it only preueth
that it is most convenient and necessary, that Bishops and ministers of the
Church The debating and deciding of matters in religion by bishops, does not
derogate from the princes authority.
while they he learned and godly, may have the debating and deciding of matters
in religion, neither does this derogate any thing from the authority of the
Prince in the same causes: we see that matters in law are determined by judges
and lawyers: so be other civil matters by wise and prudent officers in like
manner, and yet is not the authority of the Prince thereby abridged: but what
if all the ministers of the Church or most of them be corrupt and ungodly, as
it was in the beginning of the reygnes of Ezechias and Josias, and as* it has
oftentimes been: must all be committed to them then also?

No godly Princes having godly Bishops and ministers of the Church, will alter
or change, determine or appoint any thing in matters of religion, without
their advise and counsel. But how if there be dissension among them, shall
not the Prince determine the controversies, as Constantinus, Theodosius, and
other godly Emperors did? wherefore the meetnesse of the Priests and Bishops
does not take away any authority, from godly Princes in matters of the Church.

The. 6. Division.

And this is not (M. Doctor It is nothing else, as will appear.
to shake hands with the Papists. For the Papists would exempt their Priests
from the subjection and from the punishment of the civil magistrate, which we
do not. And ye Papists would that whatsoever the clergy does determine, that
that sorthwith should be holden for good, and the Prince should be forthwith
compelled to maintain, and set forth that, be it good or evil, without
further inquitie: but we say Why then more than at eiher timess or hawe prove
you this*
that if there be no lawful ministry to set good orders, as in ruinous
decays and overthrows of religion, that then the Prince ought to do it, and
if when there is a lawful ministry it shall agree of any unlawful or
unmeet order, that the Prince ought to stay that order, and not to suffer it,
but to drive them to that which is lawful and meet, and if this be to shake
hands with the papists, then M. Doctor is to blame which has taught us once
or twice before, that the appoynting of ceremonies of the church, belongs
unto the church. And yet I know that there is one or two of the later writers
that think otherwise, but as I take no advantage of their authority which
think as I do, so I ought not to be prejudiced by those that think otherwise.
But for so much as we have M. Doctor yet of this judgment that the church
ceremonies should be ordained by the church, I will travail no further in
this matter, considering that the practice of this church, commonly is to
refer these matters unto the Ecclesiastical persons only this is the
difference, that where it is done now of one or a few, we desire that it may
be done by others also who have interest in that behalf.

Io. Whitgifte. The papists confese that the prince may punish priest, 5,
Harding.

Yes in good sooth is it: for M. Harding against the Apology, confesses that
the Civil Magistrate may punish with corporal punishment any estate or
degree of persons, offending either against the first or second table. And
Saunders says lib. 2. That Bishops in that they be men, be subject to civil
Magistrates: and therefore in that Saunders li, 2.
point the Papists grant as much as you.

Concerning the determination of matters in religion, I know not wherein you
differ from them: for though the Prince mislike your determination, yet can he
not him self conclude any thing, only he may compel you to go to it again
and The Replier gives to the Prince no more than potestatem facti.
take better hold: but if it shall please you to go forewarde in your
determination, or if you cannot agree among your selves, I see not what
authority you have given to the Civil Magistrate, to determine the matter:
but for ought that I can epsy, if you and your Seniors be disposed to be
peeuishe, either must the Prince have no Religion, or else that which you shall
appoint unto him: for potestatem facti, you give him, that is, you make him
your executioner, but potestatem iuris, you do as fully remove from him, as the
papists do: for he has not (as you say) any authority to make orders or laws
in Ecclesiastical matters.

Saunders says, and so say all the Papists, that he has authoritatem
promouendi Saunders.
religionem: authority to promote religion, but not constituendi, to appoynte:
and therefore undoubtedly I perceive not wherein you differ in this Article
from the Papists. In the chief point I am sure that you agree fully and
flatly with them: and use their arguments and none other: that is in this,
that you take from the eiuill Magistrate omnem potestatem iuris, in matters and
causes Ecclesiastical.

And what Scripture have you to prove that the civil Magistrates authority

is not as ample and as large in matters of religion, when there is a lawful
ministry, as when there is an unlawful ministry? In deed when he has the
one he may the more safely use their advise, and follow their counsel, which
he neither may nor ought to do when he has the other, but his authority is
all one over them both: and surely I marueyle that you will utter such
strange assertions, so peremptorily without any kind of proof. For you that
would have all things proved by the Scriptures, have not in this wayghtie
cause used one text of Scripture, but only one borrowed of the Papists, and
making directly against you.

When I say, that the Church has authority to appoint Ceremonies, I speak
generally of all states of the Church, as well under persecution as under a
Christian Magistrate, not secluding, but including, the Christian Magistrate as
the chief and principal governor of the Church committed to him next under
God: for I do not speak of a Christian Magistrate, as you and the Papists
would have me, to wit, as of Julius Caesar, Alexander, or Nero: but I speak
of him as one appointed by God to govern, not only in the common wealth, but
in the Church also. Yea I will go further with you, I make no difference
betwixt No such difference between a christian common wealth and the Church
as is pretended.
a Christian common wealth and the Church of Christ: wonder you as much at
it as you will: I have showed my reasons before, and you have not as yet used
any to the contrary, wherefore if you think no otherwise of this cause than I
have in these words taught you, the civil Magistrate shall be much more
beholden unto you, than he is.

Certaynely I know not of any of the late writers (one or two excepted) that
are of your judgment in this cause, and were it not that the same is learnedly
and fully handled almost of all the late writers, and namely of such as have
in our tongue notably and learnedly defended this truth of the Princes
authority in Ecclesiastical matters against the English Louanistes, who have
especially sought to impeach the same, I would in more ample manner have
prosecuted this cause. But for as much as their books are in every man's
hands, it shall be sufficient to refer the Reader to my Lord of Sarisburie
his defense of the Apology against Master Harding, my L. of Winchesters
answer to Master Fecknam, and Master Nowels books against Dorman, in all
which this matter is very learnedly and painefully handled.

what say you to the purity of doctrine in all points perteyning to salvation?
Is this no reformation with you? O intolerable unthankfulness.

T. C. Page 155. Sect. 1. 2.
The other point is in the. 138. page, where he most untruly and standerously
charge the Authors of the Admonition, and makes wonderful outcries, as
though they should deny that there had been any reformation at all sithence
the time that the Queens Majesty began to reign, manifestly contrary not
only to their meaning, but also to their very words, which appears in that
they move to a through reformation, and to contend, or to labor to
perfection, denying only that the reformation which has been made in her
Majesty's days, is through and perfect. We confess willingly, that next unto
the Lord God, that every one of us is most deeply bound to her Majesty,
whom he has used as an excellent instrument to deliver his church here, out
of the spiritual Egypt of Popery, and the common wealth also, and the whole
land out of the slavery and subjection of strangers, whereunto it was so near.
This I say we willingly confess before men, and do in our prayers daily give
most humble thanks to God therefore.

And by this humble suit and earnest desire, which we have for further
reformation, we are so far from unthankfulness unto her Majesty, that we
thereby desire the heap of her felicity, and the establishment of her Royal
throne amongst us, which then shall be most sure and unremoved, when our
Savior Christ sytteth wholly and fully, not only in his chair to teach, but
also in his throne to rule, not alone in the hearts of every one by his
spirit, but also generally and in the visible government of his church, by
those laws of discipline which he has prescribed.

and is it unprofitable for this Realm? To this I answering say, has there
been no reformation in the Church of England since the Queens Majesty's
reign etc. what wonderful outeryes these be, or how untrue slanders, let
the discrete Reader judge. Does not he that says (is a reformation good for
France, and can it be evil for England) insinuate that there is no
reformation in England? In the same place they say, that hitherto we have but
patched and peeced, my rather gone backwarde. Moreover to what end does their
book tend, but to the defacing of this reformation? What is it that either
they or you commend or like in this Church? nay what is it that you mislike
not? For, to the sincerity of doctrine, as it appears, you have little
regard: all things else you utterly cast down: neither the authority of the
Prince, the ministry, the government of the Church, the administration of
the Sacraments, the ceremonies, the discipline, the form or matter of public
prayers, nor The good they acknowledge of the Queen dissembled.
almost any thing else can please you: and howsoever now in words you
confess, that you are most deeply bound unto her Majesty. etc. yet both in
tongue and in deed, dyners of you declare, that your meaning is nothing less.
For why do you then so unorderly, so undoubtedly, so spitefully, publicly and
privately, in word and in writing deface her proceedings, slander her
government, deprave the reformation that she has made, with sects and
schisms divide the Realm, set dissension among the people, make the Papists
more stubborn, drive those back that were welnighe persuaded, thrust a
misliking of the state into the hearts of many Protestants, encourage her
adversaries, separate her faithful subjects one from another, and greatly
disquiet her self? But I will not prosecute this matter: only I desire of God
most heartily, that it would please him to work that mind and affection in you
in deed, that becomes dutiful subjects, and quiet members of the Church.

but that examples may be followed, and one ought to follow an other in that
which is good and convenient. But I have showed before, that one Church is not
bound of necessity in all things to follow an other: only the Church of Rome
is so arrogant and proud as to challenge that prerogative.

I have great cause to expostulate with you, for this your unchristian,
unbrotherly, and most unjust handling of me. For where, or in what words do I
pinche at their reformation? Wherein do I use any insultation upon the
afflicted, and against them? is this to pinche at them, or to insult against
them, to wish that touching religion, they were in that state and condition
that England is? to wish that unto them, that they groan for themselves?
Surely flesh and blood will hardely suffer me to put up this injury: But I am

think it much better, by removing you from your lyuings to offend you, than
by suffering you to enjoy them, to offend the Prince, the law, conscience,
and God. And before God I speak it, if I were persuaded as you seem to be, I
would rather quietly forsake all the livings I have, than be an occasion of
strife, and contention in the Church, and a cause of stumbling to the weak,
and rejoicing to the wicked. I know God would provide for me, if I did it,
bona conscientia: yea surely I would rather dye, than be an author of
schisms, a disturber of the common peace, and quietness of the Church and
state. There is no reformed Church that I can hear Every church has a
determinate order of ceremonies
tell of, but it has a certain prescript and determinate order, as well
touching ceremonies, and discipline, as doctrine, to the which all those are
constrained to give their consent, that will live under the protection of it:
and why then may not this Church of England have so in like manner? Is it
meet that every man should have his own fancy, or live as him list? Truly
I know not whereunto these your doings can tend, but either to Anabaptisme,
or to mere confusion. But now to the reasons that move you, not to subscribe
to those Articles ministered unto you, by her Majesty's high Commissioners.

Doctor was disposed to make him self, and his Reader merry, but it is with
the bagpipe or country mirth, not with the harp or lute, which the learned
were wont to handle. For he has packed by together the old tale of the cursed
wife, and of the thief that took away the Priests purse, very familiar and
homely gear: It might peradventure make M. Doctor hoppe about the house, but
the learned and the wise, can not dance by this instrument.

It pleases M. Doctor to compare those which be put out of their livings
without just cause, to heretics. cursed wives, and to thieves, but all men do
understand how rightly. What his troubles be within, and in his conscience,
the Lord God and he knows best, but as for the outward persecution which he
suffers, it is not such as he need thus to stoop and to groan, and to blow
underneath it, as though he had some great burden upon his shoulders. And if
he compain of the persecution of the tongue, to let pass his immoderate
heat of speech, which he uses with those that he has to do withal, the
tongue which is more intemperate than his is in all his book, shall hardely
be found.

Io. Whitgifte.
And I thank God, I can be merry with the bagpype, I am neither ashamed of the
Instrument, nor of the country. But what divinity call you this? alack poor
spite at the bagpipe. Surely you do me a pleasure when you tell me of it. You
have omitted nothing that by any means might serve you for a jest. O great
gravity. etc. But let us leave puerilia, pueris.

I know none of you put from your livings, without most just cause: if there
be any iniuried that ways (God be thanked) they may find justice. My
quietness within my conscience (I most humbly thank my God therefore) does
mitigate the heat of the slanderous generation, and makes me more willing to
deal against that sect, that can not be maynteyned without such kind of
uncharitable, and slanderous dealing. I remember what Cyprian says to
Cornelius Epist. lib. 1. Ecclesiastical Cyprian.
discipline is not therefore to be left of, nor the severity that becomes a
Priest to be slackned, because we are reviled and evil spoken of. etc. And
again: The opprobrious speeches of the wicked ought not to move us so, that we
decline from the right way, and the sure rule, seeing that the Apostle
instructs us, saying: If I *should please men, I were not the servant of
Christ. If the heat of my tongue be immoderate, what shall be said of yours?
But this kind of dealing is nothing meet for us. Wherefore if you continue in
this vain, you shall have the best game for me.

T. C. Page 156. Sect. 2.
And although it be unreasonable inoughe, that he should not give men leave
to complain of their troubles, when he glories in troubling them, yet that of
all is most intolerable, that besides the injury which he does them, he is
angry that they will not lay hands of them selves by casting themselves out of
their livings, or ever they be cast out by him. Tully makes mention of one C.
Fimbria, which when he had caused Q. Sceuola a singular man to be wounded, and
saw that he dyed not of it, conuented him before the Judges, and being asked
what he had to accuse him of, answered, for that he did not suffer the whole
weapon wherewith he was stricken, to enter into his body: even so M. Doctor
contenteth not him self only to do injuries unto men, but accuses them also,
that they will not do it unto them selves, or that they would not willingly
suffer his weapons enter so far, as he would have them.

Io. Whitgifte.
I trust there is not one that can justly say, I have without great cause
molested him: if there be any such, or whom I have by any means iniuried, I
refuse not to answer, and to satisfy him: yea it is my desire that it may
come to the trial, so shall many slanderous speeches, together with the
authors of them be found as they are.

C. Fimbria was a very proud, sedicious Roman, and one that disquieted the C.

state of the common wealth, and greatly envied his superiors. Q. Sceuola was
a wise and a prudent Senator, one that lived in authority, and observed laws
him self, and caused the same to be observed by other. Sceuola surely you can
not be, for you are neither of that credit, for wisdom, nor of that
authority in the common wealth, nor so diligent an obseruer of good orders and
laws: your conditions come nearer to Fimbria, I will not conclude, you shall
do it your self.

If I have done you any injury, prosecute it to the vttermoste, and spare not,
I never entreated you to hold your peace. The greatest injury that I
acknowledge my self guilty of, is unto the College, that I so long suffered
you contrary to your express oath, to usurp a place therein, to the great
hinderaunce and disquieting thereof.

T. C. Page 156. Sect. 2.
What conscience is there that binds a man to depart from his living, in that
place where he likes not of all the orders which are there used? Is it not
enough to abstain from them, if there be any evil in them, or to declare the
unlawfulness of the^, if his calling do suffer him, when as the reformation is
not in his power? And if either of this absteyning, or declaration of this
unlawfulness of them, troubles be moved, there is no more cause why they
should give place, than the other which like of those disorders, yea there is
less cause, for that they are not the causes of trouble but the other, and for
that by their departure out of their places, room is made for those which will
like of those disorders, which the other misliked, which is to the hurt of
that company, or congregation in such places.

Io. Whitgifte.
If he be sworn to keep those orders keeping his living: if as honest men as
he is will like of them: If his equals, or rather betters, might supply his
place: I think he ought rather to satisfy his oath, or to refuse his living,
if he will avoid perjury: yea though there were no such meet persons to
succeed him. But if the case be this, that a man shall directly swear, either
to do such a thing by such a time, or to leave his place, if by that time he
neither do the thing by oath required, nor leave his place, but still usurp
the same, at the least the space of five years: I think he ought to be
displaced for perjury: which is a greater matter than either cappe or
surplesse. I do but now put a case, that men may understand every man that
is displaced, not to be displaced without great and urgent occasion. I would
not enter into this vain, if I were not urged. Therefore to answer in one
word for all, I have put no man out of his living, but there is greater cause
why he should be ashamed to compain of injury, than I, to do according to
my oath and duty.

T. C. Page 156. toward the end.
And as for M. Doctors easiness to depart from his living, rather than he
would cause any trouble, he gives men great cause to doubt of, which having
diverse great livings, and amongst them a benefice, is very loath to go from
troubling of others, to do his duty at any of them. It is true that the
Church of England may have an order, whereunto it may justly require the
subscription of the ministers in England. And so is it likewise untrue, that
we desire that every one should have his own fancy, and live as him lists,
for we also desire an uniform order, but such, and in such sort, as we have
before declared. As for the old accusation of Anabaptisme and confusion, it is
answered before, therefore according to my promise, I will leave your words, and
if you have any matter, I will speak to that.

Io. Whitgifte.
This was objected and answered before: God knows my heart, and I am ready to
give mine account when I am thereunto by order called: orders you will
admit, but such as pleases you, that is, you will be in order, if you may
do what you list.

authorized by Parliament, and all and every contents therein, be such as are
not repugnant to the word of God.

Admonition.
Albeit, right Honorable and dearly beloved, we have at all times borne with
that which we could not amend in this book, and have used the same in our
ministry, so far forth as we might, reuerencing those times, and those
persons, in which and by whom it was first authorized, being studious of
peace, and of the buylding up of Christ's church, yet now being compelled by
subscription to allow the same, and to confess it not to be against the
word, of God in any point, but tolerable: we must needs say as follows,
that this book is an imperfect book, culled and picked out of the Popish
dunghill the Mass book, full of all abominations, for some, and many of the
contents therein, be such as are against the word of God, as by his grace
shall be proved unto you. And by the way we can not but much marvel at the
crafcie wiliness of those men, whose parts it had been first to have proved
each and every content therein, to be agreeable to the word of God, seeing
that they forcemen by subscription to consent unto it, or else send them
packing from their callings.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 149. Sect. 1.

of it by subscription, as you say, that you have hitherto done by using of it
in your ministry? Will you speak one thing, and do an other? Will you not
subscribe to that, which you publicly use, and give your consent unto?

T. C. Page 157. Sect. 1.
The Admonition has no such thing, as M. Doctor charge the authors thereof
with, that they did ever allow of the book of service. It says, they bare
with it, and used it so far, as they might, and therefore now when it came to
the approving of it by subscription, they refused, and there is no man which
can not understand, that it is one thing to beat with a thing, and an other
to approve it, and therefore to bear, and to use it so far as might be, may
well agree with their refusal of subscription, so that M. Doctors note is not
worth the noting. The Apostles did bear with the infirmity of the Jews
addicted to the observation of the ceremonial law, yet they never allowed
that infirmity, and they were so far from approving it by subscribing, that
they wrote against it.

Io. Whitgifte.
They say they have not only borne with it, but used it also in their
ministry. etc. and he that uses a thing does as much allow of it by using,
as he could do by subscribing. But I will not contend with you about a matter
of so small weight: for neither is their learning, discretion, or judgment
such, that the book is better or worse for their allowing or disallowing of
it. They show their natures bent to contention, and vnreuerent estimation of
the scriptures by abusing of them, and that is all that can be gathered out of
their book.

The Apostles refused not to subscribe unto such things as they permitted unto
the Jews for a time, neither did they bear with any thing, for their
infirmity, against the which they wrote. If they have done any such thing,
note the place.

Chap. 1. the. 2. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 149. Sect. 1.
If those persons by whom this book was first authorized, were studious of
peace, and of buylding up of Christ's Church, as you say they were, then you
that seek to deface it, are disturbers of peace, and destroyers of the Church
of Christ. They were singular learned men, zealous in Gods religion, blameless
in life, and Martyrs at their end, for either al, or the most part of them have
sealed this book with their blood. But by the A note by the way.
way this is to be noted, that you confess your selves to have allowed that
(by using of it) which you say is against the word of God.

T. C. Page 157. Sect. 1.
Those says M. Doctor which authorized this book, were studious of peace, and
of buylding of Christ's Church, therefore they that speak against it (which he
calls defacing) are disturbers of the peace, and destroyers of the Church. So
I will reason. Unequal com parisons For in these points they were not buylders
up of Christ's church.
Gedeon was studious of peace, and of building of the Church, therefore they
which spoke against the Ephod which he made were disturbers of the peace, and
destroyers of the church. We speak against Images in churches and
consubstantiation in the sacraments, and such like, which Luther being
studious of peace, and of the building of the church did hold, and yet we are
not therefore disturbers of peace, or destroyers of the church. Although they
were excellent personages, yet their knowledge was in part, and although they
brought many things to our light, yet they being sent out in ye morning, or
ever the sun of the Gospel was risen so high, might ouersee many things,
which those that are not so sharp of sight as they were, may see, for because
that which they want in the sharpness of sight, they have by the benefit and
clearness of the sun, and of the light. They sealed not the book of service
with their blood (as M. Doctor says) for some that suffered for the truth,
declared openly their misliking of certain things in it, and as for the other
they could never dye for that book, more than for the Lyturgie used in the
French church, or at Geneua. For they received not the sentence of
condemnation, because they approved that book, but because they improued the
articles drawn out of the Mass book. And if they had dyed for that book (as
in deed they dyed for the book of God) yet the authority of their martyrdom
could not take away from us this liberty that we have to enquire of the cause
of their death. Iustine and Cyprian were godly Martyrs, and yet a man may not
say, that they sealed their errors which they wrote with their blood, or with
this glory of their martyrdom, prejudice those which speak or write against
their errors, for this is to oppose the blood of men, to the blood of the
son of God.

Io. Whitgifte.
These be the words of the Admonition: they say that the Authors of that book
were studious of peace, and of the building up of Christ's Church. and
therefore upon their own words and confession, I ground mine argument. This
peace that they were studious of, and sought to maynteyne by collecting and
authorizing this book, was a godly peace, sought to be maynteyned by godly
means: and therefore such as shall deface that godly means, whereby they
procured peace, can not de judged otherwise, than disturbers of the same peace.

Gedeon by making the Ephod did not seek peace, but rather glory, for he
erected Gedeons Ephod.
it to be a monument of his victory: Gedeon erected the Ephod for an other
end and purpose than God did appoint it: the Ephod that Gedeon made, was the
cause of idolatry. Likewise Images are expressly forbidden in the word of God,
and there is a direct commandment against them: so is consubsta^tiation also.
But the book of common prayer is framed according to the scriptures, appointed
to the true worshipping of God, most repugnant to all Idolatry, and Idolatrous
worshipping: and therefore these similitudes and examples that you use be
nothing like: it is neither like to Gedeons Ephod* nor maynteineth Luthers
Images: or consubstantiation, but overthrows them all.

Their knowledge was in part, in that sense that the Apostle speaks. Ex
part The praise of the makers of the book.

prophecy in part. etc. But if they be compared unto men, I think for

judgment, most of the^ have not bin ouermatched, by any that has followed.
And surely their learning and judgment was singular. But no marvel it is,
though you make so small account of me poor wretch, when you so basely speak
of them. Undoubtedly in comparison of your selves, I think you conte^ne all
learned men both living and dead.

They may well be said to have sealed this book with their blood, How they
sea led the book with their blood.
because they were martyred for that religion that is contained in this book,
and according to the which this book was framed: and if they were condemned,
for improuing the articles drawn out of the Mass book* (as you say) why may
it not be likewise affirmed, that they received the sentence of condemnation,
for approving the Articles contained in the Communion book: I know the book
they dyed for, was the book of God, yet did not the adversary pretend that,
but the articles drawn out of this, and such like books, grounded upon the
word and book of God.

Name one of them, who at the time of his death, or in ye time of his
imprisonment, declared openly his misliking of certain things in this book. I
can show you the contrary: That notable vessel of God, for learning, zeal,
and virtue, inferior to none of our M. Ridleys testimony of the book of
common prayer
age, Master Ridley Bishop of London, in his (last farewell) as it is called,
looking daily and hourly when he should go to the stake, gives this
testimony of this same book of common prayers, the which the Church of
England now uses, and you so contemptuously reject. This Church (says he)
of England had of late, of the M. Fox.
infinite goodness, and abundant grace of almighty God, great substance,
great riches of heavenly treasure, plenty of Gods true and sincere word, the
true and wholsome administration of Christ's holy sacraments, the whole
profession of Christ's religion, truly and plainly set forth in baptism,
the plain declaration and understanding of the same taught in the holy*
Catechism, to have bin learned of all true Christians. This Church had also a
true and sincere form and manner of the Lords supper, wherein according to Jesus
Christ's ordinance and holy institution, Christ's commandments were executed
and done. For upon the bread and wine set upon the Lords table, thanks were
given, the commemoration of the Lords death was had, the bread in the
remembrance of Christ's body torn upon the cross, was broken: and the cup
in remembrance of Christ's blood was distributed, and both communicated unto
all that were present, and would receive them, and also they were exhorted of
the minister so to do.

All was done openly in the vulgar tongue, so that every thing might be both
easily heard, and plainly understood of all the people, to Gods high glory,
and the edification of the whole Church. This Church had of late the whole
divine service, all common and public prayers ordained to be said and heard
in the common congregarion, not only formed and fashioned to the true vain of
the holy Scripture, but also set forth according to the commandment of the
Lord, and S. Paul's doctrine, for the peoples edification in their vulgar
tongue.

But I know his testimony shall weigh with you, as all other men's do,
howbeit I trust it will pearce the hearts of the godly. Neither is this to
oppose the blood of men, to the blood of the son of God, when the martyrdom
of men is brought into bear witness unto the truth of God.

The imperfectness of this book, and such things in the fame as be culled and
picked out of that popish dunghill, the Mass book, with the contents therein
that be against the word of God, shall appear I am sure in your several
reasons, for it is not sufficient for you, barely to say so, without wit,
learning, or reason.

This you know right well, that in so saying you make the Papists Advantage gi

book, whylest they rest them, and lie as it were in sleep. O that the wise
men of this realm (such I mean as be in authority) see not this Popish
practice, and seek not with more earnestness to prevent it. Will ye suffer
the Papists to gather strength, and to multiply, by tollerating such
Libellers, under the pretense of reformation, to discredit so much as lies
in them, yea to overthrow the whole state, and substance of religion in this
Church? Be not secure, but watch, and remember the beginning and increase of
the Anabaptists of late in Germany, which I have described in my Preface to
this book.

You say, that you can not but much marvel at the crafty wiliness of those
men, whose parts it had been first to have proved each and every content
therein to be agreeable to Gods word. etc. Nay surely, but it were your parts
rather to prove The appone^t must prove, by rules of Logike.
that there is something therein contrary or not agreeable to Gods word. For
such as be learned, and know the manner of reasoning say, that the Opponent
must prove or improve, and not the answerer. They stand to the defense and
mayntenance of the book: you seek to overthrow it: it is your parts
therefore to justify your assertions, by reasons and arguments.

But their craft is plain: wherein they deceive them selves, standing so much
upon this word repugnant, as though nothing were repugnant or against the word

know well enough, and would confess, if either they were not blinded, or else
their hearts hardened, that in the circumstances, each content, (...) judgment.
wherewith we justly find fault, and they too contentiously for the love of

Answer to the Admonition. Page 156. and. 157. Sect. 1.
If they were disposed to be crafty, I think they might soon deceive you,
for any great circumspection or discretion that appears to be in you, by this
book. You find great fault, that we stand so much upon this word repugnant,
as though nothing were repugnant or against the word of God, but that which is
expressly forbidden by plain commandment, and herein (you say) we deceive
our selves. But you do not tell us how we are deceived, neither do you let us
understand, what you think this word (repugnant) does signify. This is but
slender dealing, to find a fault, and not to correct it: you should yet have
told us your opinion of the signification of this word, seeing so great a
matter does depend upon it. True it is, that this word (repugnant) or
(against the word of God) is to The word (repugnant) expounded.
be contrary to that which in the word is commanded or forbidden, not only
in manifest words, but also in sense and understanding: except you understand
this word (repugnant) on this sort, you will bring in many points of
dangerous doctrine: for we read in the Acts. 2. and. 4. that the Apostles had
all things common, and yet Christians have not al things common. Those that
were then converted to the Gospel, sold all they had, and laid it at the
Apostles feet. Act 4. Now it is far otherwise. Then Christ ministered his
supper at night, after supper, we in the morning before dinner: he in a private
house, we in the public Church: he to men only, we to women also, with a
great many of such apparent contrarieties, which be none in deed, because they
be not against any thing commanded or forbidden to be done, or not to be done,
either in express words, or in true sense. And therefore you are greatly
deceived, when you think that we are persuaded, that those things which you
find fault with, be against the word of God.

As for this your saying (If either they were not blinded, or else their hearts
hardened) I pray God it be not most aptly spoken of your selves, but I will not
take upon me to judge those secrets, that be only known to God and your
selves.

By the word of God it is an office of preaching, they make it an office of
reading. Christ said Mat. 26. 19 Mar. 16. 15
go preach.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 158. Sect. vlt.
You say, by the word of God the ministry is an office of preaching, and we
make it an office of reading. To prove it to be an office of preaching you note
in your margent, Matthew. 26. But I think your meaning is the. 28. and Mark 16.
where Christ says to his Disciples: Go therefore and teach all nations. etc.
What if a man should say unto you, that this commission was given only to the
Apostles? for he says: Go into the whole world, where as you teach now, that
no man may come into the ministry, except he first have a stock, and then
must he keep him with his flock, and go no further. If this doctrine be true,
then can not this place serve your turn: for as the office of Apostle is
ceased by your doctrine, so is this commission also, except you will have the
one part to stand, that is, Go and preach, and this to be abrogated, In

The second reason. In this book also it is appointed that after the Creed if
there be no sermon, an homily must follow either already set out, or hereafter
to be set out. This is scarce plain dealyng, that they would have us to
consent unto that which we never saw, and which is to be set out hereafter, we
having had such cause already to distrust them by that which is already set
out, being corrupt and strange to maynteyne an unlearned and reading

Homily must follow, either already set out, or hereafter to be set out, but
you know not what will hereafter be set out, therefore you will not subscribe.

You have no cause to suspect any thing touching religion set out by public
authority (for so is the book) or hereafter to be set out by common
authority. Hitherto you are not able to convince any Homily set out by common
authority, of any error, and therefore you ought not Our homilies cannot be
accused of any error.
to be suspicious of any that is to come. If any Homily shall hereafter be set
out, wherein you mislike any thing, you need not to read it, the book does
not appoint you this or that Homily to read, but some one which you like best.
But what need you to be scrupulous in this matter? if you be disposed to
preach, then need you read no Homily at all, therefore this is no reason.

T. C. Page 157. Sect. 2.
I answer that although it be meet, that as we hope that the Homilies which
are made already be godly, so those that shall be made hereafter, shall be
likewise: yet considering the mutabilitie of men, and that of tentimes to the
worse, it is not mere. nay, it is merely unlawful, to subscribe to a blancke,
seeing that we cannot witness or allow of those things which we have not seen
nor heard.

This assertion (that in the holy Scriptures is contained all fullness to
decide controversies) if you mean controversies in matters of faith, and in
matters touching salvation, is very true, but you have used little discretion in
quoting some places to prove the same.

I find no fault with you for cyting the sixte verse of the. 2. Tim. 3. for
the. 16. verse, that is but a small oversight, and it may be in the Printer:

Scripture is of any private motion: for this place only proves that the

The place unto the Corinthes, is the same unto the Romans, and M. Doctor
approving one has no cause to find fault with the other. For the hemilies,
first of all I have showed how absurd a saying, and how unlike a divine it is,
to match reading of homilies with preaching of sermons. For if the reading of
the holy Scriptures is nothing so fruitful as the preaching of them, much
less is the reading of homilies to be for their fruit matched with preaching
of sermons.

Io. Whitgifte.
Neither of both the places does prove directly that, for the which the Authors
of the Admonition do use them: and there be other places more manifest which
they have omitted.

I have answered in that place to all your Reply concerning this point: I do
not match reading of Homilies with Sermons simply, or with all sermons, but
with Reading of Scriptures a means to judge of sermons.
some: and to some sermons I do prefer the Reading of Homilies for the causes
contained in mine Answer to the Admonition. Both the reading and the preaching
of the Scriptures is necessary, and the one in diverse respects as
necessary, and in some respects more necessary than the other. For the
Scripture is the rule to discern and judge sermons and preachers by: Christ

Scriptures: those of Thessalonica are to be commended, for trying by the

wills them to hold him accursed that shall preach any other Gospel unto
them, which they can not do without that knowledge, which God does give unto
them by reading of the Scriptures. Infinite places there be, that tends to
this end, but I have spoken of this matter before. This is my opinion that
both reading and preaching be most necessary: but in some respects the one to
be preferred before the other.

There remains that I show briefly, that neither the Homilies nor the
Apocrypha, are at all to be read in the Church. Wherein first it is good to
consider the order which the Lord kept with his people in times past, when he
commanded that no vessel, nor no instrument, either besome, or flesh hook,
or pan, etc. should come into the temple* but those only which were
sanctified and set aparte for that use. And in Leuiticus, he will have no other
trumpets blown to call the Numb. 10.
people together, but those only which were set aparte for that purpose. What
should the meaning of this law be? The matter of other common vessels and
trumpets, was the same oftentimes which theirs was, the same form also, and
the other beesomes and hooks and trumpets hable to serne for the uses
ofsweeping and sounding. etc. as well as those of the temple, and as those
which were set aparte, wherefore might not these then as well be used in the
temple as others? Forsooth, because the Lord would by these rudime^ts and
pedagogie teach, that he would have nothing brought into the church, but that
which he had appointed, no, not although they seemed in the judgment of men,
as good as those things which God himself had placed there. Which thing is
much more to be observed in this matter, seeing that the Homelies read, be they
never so learned and pithie, neither the Apocrypha, are to be compared either
in goodness within themselves, either in fruit, or in effect toward the
hearer, with the authentical scriptures of God. Now if a man will say that the
Homilies do explane, and lay open the scriptures, I answer, that the word of
God also is plain and 19. Psalm.
easy to be understood, and such as gives understanding to Idiotes and to
the simple. And if 1. Prou.
there be hardness in them, yet the promise of the assistance of Gods spirit,
that God has given to the reading of the Scriptures in the church, which he
has not given to homilies* or to the Apocrypha, will be able to weygh with the
harduesse, and to over come it, so that there shall easily appear greater
profit to come unto the church by reading of the scriptures* than by reading
of homilies.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this of the vestels of the temple, the instruments, beesoms, flesh hooks,
trumpets, etc. is superstuous, and proves nothing, except it can be showed
that the Lord has commanded only the Canonical scriptures to be read in
the Church and nothing else: or that the Lord has as particularly expressed all
things to be used in the Church under the Gospel, as he did in the temple
under the law, the contrary whereof I have proved Tract. 2. and the kind of
reasoning that you use in this and other places Tract. 2. Cap. 6. Diu. 1. and.
2.
upon similitudes is not of sufficient force to prove any thing, only it
carries away the ignorant people. In the rest of this portion you argue
against your self: for you prove the excellentie, and the worthiness of the
Scriptures, and the great commodity that comes by reading of them, which I
have labored against the authors of the Admonition to verify. But what can
you thereupon conclude against Homilies, that may not be in like manner against
Sermons, or other interpretation of the Scriptures? and rather against the one,
(that is sermons) than against the other. For as I said before, I make this
only difference betwixt Homilies and Sermons, that the one is pronounced
within the book, the other not so. If you object and say that the Preacher is
directed by the spirit of God, I will answer that the writers of Homilies, be
so likewise. And what can you allege in this point for the one, that I can not
allege for the other? The promise of the assistance of Gods spirit, is as
well given to him that writes Homilies, and to those that hear them, as it is
to such as study for their sermons, and such as hear them. To the Scriptures
I give the chief pre-eminence, but yet both Sermons, and all other kinds of
teaching, publishing the doctrine contained in the Scriptures, have their
singular commodities, and necessary uses in the Church of God.

But either I understand you amiss, or else do you not well agree with your

self: for let the Reader consider the great commodity, that you truly give to
the reading of the Scripture in this place, with that abasing of the same, that
in the defense of the authors of the Admonition you use Page 173. which I will
also note when I come Page 173. Sect. vlt.
to that place.

T. C. Page 158. Sect. 1.
Besides this the policy of the church of God in times past is to be followed
herein, that for the expounding of darker places, places of more easiness
ought to be joined together, as in the persecution of Antiochus, where they
could not have the commodity of preaching, the Jews did appoint at their
meeting always a piece of the law to be read, and with all a piece of the
Prophets which expounded that piece of the law, rather than to bring in
interpretations of men to be read. And because I am entered into that matter,
here comes to be considered, the practice also of the church, both before our
savior Christ's coming, and after, that when the churches met together, there
is nothing mentioned but the reading of the Scriptures, for so is the Liturgy
described in the Acts. And it is not to be thought, but that they had those
which made expositions 13. Act.
of the law and the Prophets. And besides that they had Onkelos the Calday
paraprast, both Galatyne, 15. Act.
and Rabbi Moses (surnamed Maynion) write, that Jonathan an other of the Calday
paraphrasts flourished in our savior Christ's time, whose writings and
paraphrases upon the scriptures, are esteemed co^parable in that kind of
paraphrasticall writing, with any which has labored that ways, and if any
men's writings were to be read in the church, those paraphrases which in
explaning the scripture, go least from it, and which kept not only the number
of sentences, but almost the very number of words, were of all most fit to be
read in the church, seeing therefore (I say) the church of God then absteyned
from such interpretations in the church, and contented it self with the
scriptures, it can not be but a most dangerous attempt, to bring any thing
into the church to be read, besides the word of God. This practice Untruth
as will appear.
continued still in the Churches of God after the Apostles times, as may
appear by the second Apology of Iustine Martyr, which shows that their
manner was to read in the church the monuments of the Prophets, and of the
Apostles, and if they had read any thing else, it is to be supposed that he
would have set it down, considering that his purpose there, is to show the
whole order which was used in their churches then. The same may appear in the
first homily of Origin upon Exodus, and upon the Judges.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely in all this there is nothing spoken against reading of Homilies, that
may Sermons are of the same nature with Homilies.
not in like manner be alleged against preaching of sermons, and other godly
exercises of interpreting the scriptures: for if Homilies interpreting the
scriptures according to the true meaning, and sense of them, be the
interpretations of men, and therefore not to be read in the Church, whose
interpretations shall we call Sermons, and other readinges? The one as well as
the other is uttered by men, and by men in that order framed. But I think that
no right and true interpretation of the Scripture is to be The true
interpretation of the scripture is not to be accounted as of man.
compted man's, though it be written, read, or preached by man, for the spirit
of God is the Author of it, and man is but the instrument. The rest of your
proofs taken from the use of the Church (as you say) be all ab authoritate
negative: and most of them ab authoritate hominum: which kind of argument
your self have before utterly condemned. I have oftentimes could you that an
argument, a non facto, ad non ius (and it is M. Zuinglius and other men's
judgment, as well as mine) is good neither in divine, nor yet in humane
things.

So far as I can learn Jonathan the Calday Paraphrast, flourished not in

time, (as you say) but. 42. years before Christ was borne, and I think there
is none of these Paraphrastes so faithful, in interpreting, but that they
miss in some places: and you can not but acknowledge, that one good Sermon or
Homily of some learned man's, well and plainly read to the people, may edify
them more, than the reading of these Paraphrastes. And yet I suppose you know,
that the Jews have those Paraphrastes, as yet read in their Churches:
wherefore hitherto if you have spoken any thing it is against your self.

But you say, that this practice continued still in the Churches of god, etc.
and you prove it by Iustine Martyr, because he mentions nothing read in the
church, but Monuments of the Prophets, and Ipostles. Concerning your proof,
I have declared already of what force it is, being drawn ab authoritate humana
negative. Now that this practice continued not still in the Church, you shall
easily perceive if you peruse that which Eusebius writes The epistle of
Ciement read in the church.
out of an Epistle of Dionysius Corinthius to Soter Bishop of Rome, where he
writes after this sort. And in this epistle there is mention of an Epistle of
Clement written to the Corinthians, declaring that (according to the old
custom) it was read in the Eusebius. lib. 4* Cap. 2^.

Lord, wherein we read your Epistle, which we will always read for admonition
sake, in like sort as Dionysius lived about the year. 147.
the former epistle written to us from Clement. The Authors of the Centuries
writing of this Dionysius, think it not unlike that his Epistles were also
read in the Church, because Eusebius calls them Catholicas, Catholic. Their
words be these: Non videtur prae^ereundum, quod Eusebius basce epistolas
Catholicas vocet: forte quia in Ecc^esijs Cent. 2. cap. 10.
piorum solitae sunt legi, sicut Clementis. This thing would not be omitted,
that Eusebius calls these epistles Catholic: peradventure, because they were
wont to be read in the Churches of the faithful, as the Epistle of Clement
was. And this may testify of the practice of the Church in Justinius Martyrs

spoken before, now it shall be sufficient only to set down Master Bucers
judgment of this matter in his notes upon the Communion book, which is this.
It is better that where there lackes to expound the Scriptures unto the
people, there should be Godly and learned Homilyes read unto them, rather
than they should have no exhortation at all in the administration of the
Supper. And a little after: There be too fevve Homilies, and to fevve points of
Religion taught in them: when therefore the Lord shall bless this kingdom,
with some excellent Preachers, let them be commanded to make mo Homilyes of
the principal points of Religion, which may be read to the people, by those
Pastors, that can not make better themselves.

T. C. Page 158. Toward the end.
And as for Master Bucers authority, I have showed before how it ought to be
weighed, and here also it is suspicious, for that it is said that his advise
was, that when the Lord should bless the realm with mo learned preachers,
that then order should be taken to make more homilies, which should be read in
ye church unto the people. As if M. Bucer did not know. that there were then
learned preachers enough in the realm, which were able to make Homilies so
many as the volume of the^ might easily have exceeded the volume of the Bible,
if the multitude of Homilies, would have done so much good. And if the
authority of Master Bucer bear so great a swaye with Master Doctor, that upon
his credit only, without either Scripture or reason, or examples of the
Churches primitive, or those which are now, he dare thrust into the church
Homilies, then the authorities of the most ancient and best councels ought to
have been considered, which have given charge, that nothing should be read in
the church, but only the Canonical Scriptures.

Io. Whitgifte.
They are M. Bucers words in deed, neither is there any cause why you should
suspect them so to be. And it is not his judgment only, but other learned men's

of the M. Fox. to. 2. Page 1940.
principal virtues, which are commended in Scripture, and likewise other
Homilies against the most pernicious and capital vices, that uses (alas) to
reygne in this Church of England. And truly these authorities if I had no other
reason, prevail more with me than all that you, or any of your part had said,
or is able to say to the contrary.

For it was decreed in the council of Laodicea, that nothing should be read

as corruptions grew in the church* it was permitted that homilies might be
read by the Deacon, when the minister was sick, and could not preach, and it
was also in an other Council of Carthage permitted, that the martyrs lives

had (under preteuce whereof the Popish Legende, and Gregory's Council. vasense.

as may appear by the council of Colen, albeit otherwise Popish. And truly if
there were nothing else but this consideration, that the bringyng in of the
readyng of Martyrs lives into the church, and of the homilies of ancient
writers, has not only by this means iustled with the Bible, but also thrust
it clean out of the church, or into a corner where it was not read nor seen,
it ought to teach all men to beware of placing any writing or work of men in
the church of God, be they never so well learned, as long as the world should
endure.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is certain that the decree of the Council of Laodicea, can no more
condemn the reading of Homilies in the Church, than it may the readyng of
Prayers or Cathechismes, or any other interpretation of the Scriptures. The
meaning of the Nothing ought to be read in the church under the name of
Scriptures, but the canonical.
Council is only, that nothing be read in the Church as Scripture, or under
the name of Scripture, but that which is Canonical. And that does evidently
appear in the. 47. Canon of the third Council of Carthage, which does explane
this Canon. The words be these: Item placuit vt praeter Scripturas Canonicas,
nihil in Ecclesia legatur sub nomine diuinarum scripturarum. It is thought good
that nothing be read in the Church, under the name of the scriptures of God,
but the Canonical Scriptures. It does not therefore Con. Carth. 3. can. 47.

the same to be read. Concilium vasense (as it is before declared) appoints
Homilies Homilies appointed to be read.
to be read, when there is no Sermon, by reason of some infirmity or
sickness in the minister, which is a godly and profitable decree, neither
could it be the cause of any corruption.

I do not defend the reading of any thing in the Church which is not grounded
Nothing ought to be read not grounded of the scriptures
upon the word of God, therefore the decree of the Council of Carthage, or
any such like does nothing touch the cause that I defend: and yet I know not
in what sort or out of what story these lives of Martyrs were read. I like
very well of the decree of the council of Colen, for it inhibiteth the reading
in the Church of fabulous, and barbarous stories of the lives of Saints,
whereby it is like that the book called Legenda aurea is mente. But what is
this against godly Homilies, that conteyne the true interpretation of the
scriptures, godly exhortation to good life, and sound proofs of true doctrine,
which is as far from iustling the bible out of the church, or into corners, as
is preaching. And I muse that you can allege this for a cause, seeing you
think so slenderly of the reading of the Scriptures, and will have ye same
give place to your sermons.

object, that by this means also is shut out of the church the form of
ordinary Prayers to be said: I say the case is nothing like, for when we
pray, we can not use the words of the Scripture, as they orderly lie in the
text. But for so much as the church prays for diverse things necessary for
it, the which are not contained in one or two places of the scripture, and that
also there are some things which we have need of, whereof there is no express
prayer in the scripture, it is needful that there be a form of prayer drawn
forth out of the Scripture, which the church may use when it meets, as the
occasion of the time does require, which necessity can not be by no means
alleged in the reading of Homelies or Apocrypha. Whereupon appears, that it
is not so well ordained in the church of England, where both Homilies and
Apocrypha are read, especially when as diverse chapters of the books called
Apocrypha are lifted up so high, that they are sometime appointed for
extraordinary lessons upon feasts days, wherein the greatest assemblies be
made, and some of the chapters of the canonical Scripture, (as certain
chapters of the Apocalypse) quite left out, and not read at all.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have made an objection which you can not answer, and against the which
all these reasons that you have before used do as much prevail, as they do
against reading of Homilies: and whatsoever you can say for the one, may
likewise be said for the other. For when we interpret the Scriptures, when we
teach, or exhort, we can not use only the words of the scripture, as they
lie orderly in the text, but we must amplifye them, displace them, apply
them to the matter we speak of, entermingling them with our own words and
phrases. For except you will grant this to be lawful, as well in exhorting and
teaching, as in public preaching, you must (as I said before) as well condemn
Sermons, as Homilies.

The Apocrypha that we read in the Church, have been so used of long time, as
Apocrypha read in timepaste in the church.
it may appear in that third council of Carthage, and 47. Canon, where they be
reckened among the Canonical books of the Scripture. They may as well be
read in the Church, as counted portions of the old and new Testament: and
forasmuch as there is nothing in them contrary to the rest of the Scripture. I
see no inconvenience, but much commodity that may come by the reading of them.

Of the name (Priest) given to the ministers of the gospel.
Chap. 3. The first Division.

We speak not of the name of Priest, wherewith he defaceth the minister of
Christ, (because the Priest that translated it, would perhaps fame have the
minister of Christ to be joined with him) seeing the office of priesthood is
ended Christ being the last Priest that ever was. To cai us therefore Priests as
touching our office, is either to call back again the old priesthood of the
law, which is to deny Christ to be comen, or else to keep a memory of the
popish priesthode of abomination still amongst us. As for the first, it is by
Heb. 5. 1. 6. Heb. 9. 11.
Christ abolished, and for the second it is of Antichrist, and therefore we
have nothing to do with it. Such ought to have Eze. 44. 10 Ierem. 23. Heb. 5.

no place in our Church, neither are they ministers of Christ, sent to preach
his Gospel, but Priests of the Pope to sacrifice for the quick and the dead,
that is, to tread under their feet the blood of Christ. Such ought not to
have place amongst us, as the scriptures manifestly teach. Besides that we
never read in ye new Testament, that this word Priest, as touching office, is
used in y^ good part.

would seem to make it. I suppose it comes of this word Presbyter, not of
Sacerdos, and then the matter is not great.

T. C. Page 159. Sect. 2.
Although it will be hard for you to prove, that this word (Priest)
comes of the Greek word ((...)) yet that is not the matter, but the case
stands in this, that for so much as the common and usual speech of England
is, to note by the word (Priest) not a minister of the Gospel, but a
sacrificer, which the minister of the Gospel is not, therefore, we ought not
to call the ministers of the Gospel (priests) and that this is the english
speech, it appears by all ye english translations, which translate always
((...)) which were sacrificers (priests) and do not of the other side (for any
that ever I read,) translate (...) a priest. Seeing therefore a priest with us,
and in our tongue, does signify both by ye Papists judgment in respect of their
abhommable Mass, and also by the judgment of the protestant in respect of
the beasts which were offered in the law, a sacrificing office, which the
minister of the gospel neither does, nor can execute, it is manifest, that it
can not be without great offense so used.

Io. Whitgifte.
I am not greatly delightedwith the name, nor so desirous to maynteyne it, but
yet a truth is to be defended: I read in the old fathers, that these two
names Sacerdos and presbyter be confounded. I see also that the learned, and
the best of our English writers, such I mean as write in these our days,
translate this word presbyter, so: and the very word it self, as it is used
in our english tongue, sounds the word presbyter. As heretofore use has
made it to be taken for a sacrificer, so will use now alter that signification,
and make it to be taken for a minister of the Gospel. But it is mere vanity
to contend for the name, when we agree of the thing: the name may be used and
not used without any great offense.

The priest or priests that translated this book, be not so skornfully to be

them singular both in life, religion, and learning: speak not so

of the priesthood. I muse what you mean thus unnecessarily to paint your

the Hebrews is something to the purpose, but needless.

action, may be done without a Mass, they enioyn the married persons to receive
the communion, (as they do their Bishops and priests when they are made.) etc.
Other petty things out of the book we speak not of, as that women, contrary

to the rule of the Apostle, come, and are suffered to come bareheaded with
bagpipes and fiddlers before them, to disturb the congregation, and that they
must come in at the great door of the church, else all is marred.

Answer to the Admonition Page 194. Saect. 1. The ring in matrimony.

The first thing you mislyke in matrimony is the ryng, which you call a
sacramental sign, and untruly say, that we attribute the virtue of wedlock
thereunto: I know it is not material whether the ring be used or no, for it is
not of the substance of matrimony: neither yet a sacramental sign, no more
than sitting at Communion is, but only a Ceremony of the which M. Bucer
(writing his judgment upon the first Bucers opinion of (...) ring in marriage.
communion book set out in the time of king Edward) says on this sort:
Subijcitur alius ritus, vt a^nulum. etc. There is an other rite and ceremony
used that the bridegroom should lay upon the book the ring or any other sign
or token of wedlock, be it gold or silver, which he will give to his wife, and
from thence the minister taki^g it, does deliver it to the bridegrom, and he
delivers the same to the bride with a prescript form of words contained in
the book: this ceremony is very profitable, if the people be made to
understand what is thereby signified: as that the ring and other things first
laid upon the book* and afterward by the minister, given to the bridegroom to
be delivered to the bride, do signify that we ought to offer all that we have
to god before we use The fourth finger.
them, and to acknowledge that we do receive them at his hand to be used to his
glory. The putting of the ring upon the fourth finger of the womans left hand,
to the which as it is said, there comes a sinew of string from the heart,
does signify that the heart of the wife ought to be united to her husband,
and the roundnesse of the ring does signify, that the wife ought to be joined
to her husband with a perpetual band of love, as the ring it self is
without end. Hitherto M. Bucer.

T. C. Page 159. Sect. vlt.
If it be M. Bucers judgment which is alleged here for the ring, I see that
sometimes Homer slepeth. For first of al I have showed that it is not lawful to
institute new signs and sacraments, and then it is dangerous to do it,
especially in this which confirms the false and popish opinion of a
sacrament, as is alleged by the Admonition. And thirdly to make such fond
allegories of the laying down of the money, of the roundnesse of the ring, and
of the mystery of the fourth finger, is let me speak it with his good leave)
very ridiculous and far unlike himself. And fourthly, that he I do not
speak of the inconvenience that men are constrayn^d with charges to bring
their children oftentimes half a score miles for that (which if it were
needful) might be as well done at home in their own parishes. The third is
for that in the allegation of the second cause of the v^yng of the
confirmation, the book ^ayeth, that by the (...) of hands, and Prayer, the

the popish distinction, that the spirit of God is give at baptism unto ye
remission of sins, and in confirmation unto strength, the which very word
(strength) the book alleges, and all this M. Doctor con^uteth, by calling of
the authors of the Admonition pceuishe and arrogant.

Io. Whitgifte.
If that be a sufficient reason to abolishe it, because it hath^ been horribly
abused, then what shall you reteyne either in the church, or in the common
life of man. But Tract. 7. ca. 5. the. ^. diuiss. etc.
I have before in talking of apparel declared the vanity of this reason, and
yet the confirmation that is now used was never abused by the Papists, for
they had it not, neither any similitude of it, but only the name which can
not contaminate the thing.

It commes not from the Popes decretall Epistles, except you will say, that
these Epistles were connted authentical before Ieromes time: for he makes
mention of this confirmation, and allows of it, in his book aduersus
Luciferianos. I deny not Ierom. aduers. Luciferian^s.
(says he) this to be the custom of the churches, that the Bishop at the
in^ocation of the holy spirit, go to lay his hand upon those which have
been baptized as far off in lesser cities, by priests and deacons.

M. Bucer likewise writing upon the fourth to the Ephesians testifies, yt this
confirmation Bucer.
is ver^e ancient in the Church, and well lyketh and allows ye same.
Wherefore except you will give too much authority to the Popes decretall
Epistles, you can not say, that the confirming of children after baptism, had
the original in them.

The first step of popery in this Confirmation, (as you say) is laying on of
hands. etc. and yet you see by the testimony of Jerome and Bucer, that laying
on of hands has long before Ieromes time been used in confirming of children.
Neither can you say, that it confirms the opinion of it, that it is a
sacrament, more than imposition of hands does confirm the opinion of
ordeyning ministers that it is also a Sacrament: for I think that you will
not deny but that imposition of hands may be used in ordeyning of ministers.

You say, it is an untruth, that the confirmyng of children by the imposition
of hands came from the Apostles: but you only say it, you prove it not. Show
the first institution of it since the Apostles, and then you say something,
else the words of the book will bear with them better credit, than yours can
do.

To your second point, the authors before named, do sufficiently answer in
the places that I have before named. The words of Jerome be t^ese. If you
demand in Hiero aduers. Lucifer. ^om. 2
this place, wherefore he that is baptized in the Church does not receive the
holy Ghost but by the imposition of the hands of the Bishop: seeing we all
affirm that the holy Ghost is given in true baptism. Learn this observation
to come from this authority, that after the ascension of our Lord, the holy
Ghost came down upon the Apostles. And in many places we find the same thing
to be done, rather for the honor of priesthood than necessity of the law For
if the holy Ghost should come only at the prayer of the Bishop, those were to
be lamented, which in prison, or in castles, or in far places being baptized
by priests and Deacons die before the Bishop can visit them. The words of M.
Bucer be these. The Bucer. in. 4. Ephesians.
sign of imposition of hands, Bishops only did give, and that not without
reason: for whether the covenant of the Lord is to be confirmed to those that
are baptized, or whether they are to be reconciled that have grievously
offended, or whether the ministers of the Church are to be ordained: all these
ministeries do best become those to whom the chief care of the Church is
committed.

Your objection of men's charges in bringing their children to be confirmed, is
childish.

It cannot be denied but that by hearty and earnest prayers God does work these
eff^cts in thos^ children that be his: and hereof imposition of hands is a
sign. The ground of this is that promise whereupon all our prayers do depend,
that is, that we shall obtain whatsoever we ask the father in Christ's name:
neither can you more justly cavil in this respect, at the imposition of hands
at the confirmation of children, than you can do at the same in the ordeining
of ministers.

The Authors of the Admonition seem to allow of confirmation, but not as it
is now used, for the which, because they show no reason, it is a confutation
most meet for them, to say that they be both arrogant and peevish.

say, that we condemn burial, I would have him understand that we hold that
the body must be honestly and comely buried, and that it is meet that for that
cause some reasonable number of those which be the friends and neighbors about

lament the dead, and if the dignity of the person so require, we think it not
unlawful to use some way about the burial whereby that may appear, but yet
so that there be a measure kept both in the weeping, and in the charges,
considering that where as immoderate either weeping or pomp was never, no not
in the time of the law allowed, now in the time of the gospel, all that is not
lawful, which was permitted in the time of the law. For unto the people of
God under the law, weeping was by so much more, permitted unto them, than unto
us, by how much they had not so clear a revelation and plain sight of the
resurrection as we have, which was the cause also why it was lawful for them
to use more cost in the embaulming of the dead, thereby to nourish and to help
their hope touching the resurrection, whereof we have a greater pledge by the
resurrection of our savior Christ than they had.

that which is the duty of every christian, they tie alo^e to the mini^ter,

the prayers, where they pray that we with this our brother, and all other
departed in the true faith of thy holy name, may have our perfect consummation
and bliss, both in body and soul. We say nothing of the threefould peale,
because that it is rather licensed by iniunction, than commanded in the book,
nor of their strange mourning, by changing their garments, which if it be not
hypocraticall, yet it is superstitious and heatcrush, because it is used only
of custom: nor of burial Sermons, which are put in pl^ce of ^rentalls
whereout spring many abuses, and therefore in the best reformed Churches are
removed. As for the superstitions used both in country and city, for the
place of burial, which way they must lie, how they mu^t be fecched to Church
the Minister meeting them at Church st^le with surplesse, with a company of
greedy Clearks, that a Cross white or black must be set upon the dead corpse,
that bread must be given to the poor, and offerings in burial time used, and
cakes sent abroad to friends, because these are rather used of custom and
superstition than by the authority of the book. Small commandment will
serve for the accomplishing of such things. But great charge will hardly bring
the least good thing to pass, and therefore all is let alone, and the people
as blind and as ignorant, as ever they were. God be merciful unto us.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 198. Sect. 1.
It is true that we have a prescript kind of service to bury the dead, and that
we appointe that office to the minister, and what have you in the whole
scripture, against this? or whoeuer has found fault with either of these two
things (I mean prescript service to bury the dead, and the minister to execute
that office) but you alone? or when was it ever heretofore reproved by any, but
even by yourselues now of late?

very barren ^trone, which can say nothing for it. And although there be
enough said by the Admonition, yet because this bold and hardy ^peach is enough
to lead the simpler a^y, and to make them think that M. Doctor has a good
cause, therefore I will also say so^thing of these rites of bur^all.

Io. Whitgifte.
What one reason is there used in the Admonition? what one word of scripture?
what authoriti^ of writer? to improve a prescripte kind of service to bury the
dead, and the minister to execute that office. If there be any rehearse it: if
there be none why do you keep your old cu^ome of speaking untruly? for as much

it without proof, without reason, without gr^unde, the thing being known
so be good and godly, and pra^tised in the primitive Church (for we read in
Tertullian, that the dead were wont to be buried by the ministers, and with
prayer) and furthermore seeing it is established, and allowed by the Church,
what should I labor by reason or authority to confirm that, which, cannot
by any reason or authority be overthrown. Tertul. de Anima.
Wheresore I will only answer such bare assertions, as M. Zuinglius answered An
order received in the Church needs no proof, until by reason it be
overthrown. Zuinglius ad* Balt^a. resp.
(upon the like occasion) one Balthazar an Anabaptist. VVhilest you require
scripture and reason, you obtrude unto other that which you ought to perform
your selves, for you deny that this ought to be so, show therefore some
express testimony out of the scripture, to confirm your opinion. To this
effect spea^eth Zuinglius to Balthazar, who (without reason or scripture,
alleged to the contrary) required of Zuinglius the proof of those things
which without controle^ent of any (but Heretics) had continued in the Church
of long time, and then also allowed in the time of the Gospel: Even so the
received order established by this Church, carries with it authority and
credit sufficient, and needs not to be further by reason confirmed, except
it be first by reason overthrown, which because it is not per^ourmed by the
Admonition, my affirmation is sufficient reason, against their denial.

If this be M. Doctors simple shift throughout his book, I trust M. Doctor
that would^ have bin, has not omitted to note it, where he may find it, seeing
his eye sight is so sharp, that he can imagine himself to epsy it, where no
man else can find it. But let words go.

Answer to the Admonition Page 198. Sect. 2.
You say that thereby prayer for the dead is mainteyned, as may partly be
gathered out of some of the prayers, where we pray that we with this our
brother, and other departed in the true faith of thy holy name* etc. You know
full well what out doctrine Prayer for the dead not, mainteyned.
is concerning prayer for the dead, and you ought not thus boldly to utter a
manifest untruth, for in so doing you do but be wray your sinister affection
How prove you that a prescripte form of service for burying the dead, and the
minister only to bury them, does maintain prayer for the dead* when you have
showed your reason, you shall hea^e my answer.

In saying that these words gathered out of some of the prayers, Page 199.
(...) 1. 2. 3.
that we with this our brother. etc. import prayer for the dead, you do but
quarrel: E^position of a prayer at Burial.
when we say that we with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob may reygne in thy kingdom,
do we pray for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or ^ather wish ourselves to be where
they are?

In the like manner when we say, that we with this our brother, and all other
departed in the true faith of thy holy name, may have our perfect consummation,
and bliss both in body and soul, we pray not for our brother, and other that
be departed in the true faith, but we pray for ourselves, that we may have our
perfect consummation and bliss, as we are sure those shall have which die in
the true faith.

Now weigh this reason, there is a prescript form of burying the dead, and it
is madea portion of the ministers office, therefore you will not subscribe to
the communion book.

T. C. Page 161. Sect. 1.
And first o^ all as this almost is a general fault in them all, that they
maintain in the minds of the ignorant the opinion of praying for the dead: so
is this also another general fault, that these ceremonies are taken up
without any example either of the churches under the law, or of the purest
churches under the Gospel, that is of the churches in the Apostles times. For
when the Scripture describes the ceremonies or rites of burial amongst the
people of God so diligently, that it makes mention of the smallest things,
there is no doubt but the holy Ghost does thereby show us a pattern, whereunto
we should also frame our burialls. And therefore for so much as neither the
Church under the law nor under the Gospel, when it was in the greatest
purity, did ever use any prescript form of service in the burial of their
dead, it could not be but dangerous, to take up any such custom, and in the
time of the law it was not only not used, but utterly for for bidden: Leuit. 21.
for when the law did forbid that the priest should not be at the burial,
which ought to say or conceive the prayers there, it is clear that the Jews
might not have any such prescripte form, and yet they had most need of it,
for the causes of obscure knowledge, and weaker faith before alleged. Again
by this means a new charge is laid upon the minister, and a taking him away
from his necessary duties of feeding and governing the flock, which being so
great as a marvelous dilig^nce will scarsely overcome, ought not to be made
greater by this, being a thing so unnecessary. The Admonition does not say
that the prayers which are said are for the dead, but that they mainteyne an
opinion of prayer for the dead in the hearts of the simple, and that they
declare mamanifestly enough, when they say that it may be partly gathered. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
Your first reason to prove that there ought to be no prescripte form of
service to bury the The prescript form of service mainteyneth not pr^yer for
the dea^ but (...)
dead, and that the minister ought not to execute that office, is this: It
mainteyneth in the minds of the ignorant, an opinion of praying for the dead,
therefore there ought to be no prescripte form of service to bury the dead,
neither must the minister execute that office. Undoubtedly this is a very
ignorant argument, if a man deny your antecedent, how will you prove it? do
you think the people (whom you do so greatly in other places extol) to be so
rude, that they understand not the English tongue? Are they not able to
discern what it is to pray for the dead? Surely I do not think any to be so
simple, that hearing the manner and form of burying our dead, can or will
imagine that we pray for the dead. And I verily believe that the ignorantest
person in a whole country, will deride the babishnesse of the argument. The
prescripte form that is now used and the minister pronouncing the same, wi^
^ather persuade them to the contrary, for where as in times past, the minister
used to say mass and dirige for the souls of the dead, and sundry times move
standers by to pray for the dead, at the time of burial: now does he read
most wholesome scriptures, declaring the myserie of the life of man, the
shortness of his days, the happiness of those that dye in the Lord, and the
certeintie of the resurrection. And who can hereof gather any prayer for the
dead?

Your second reason is this, these ceremonies (that is a prescript form of
burying the dead. etc) are taken up without any example either of the Churches
under the law, or of the churches in the Apostles time. etc. therefore there
may be no prescripte form of service for burying the dead, and the minister
may not make it a piece of his office to bury them. I deny this argument: for
it is negative from authority, because you have neither warrant to say that
there was no such order in the Apostles time, neither if you had any such
warrant, does it follow that it may not be so in our time, seeing that in
ceremonies and diverse other orders and external things, we are not bound to
the form and manner of the Apostolical Church. And yet if I should say that
in the Apostles time, the minister used to bury the dead, and ground my reason
upon the place of S. Augustine before alleged, quod vniuersa tenet ecclesia.
etc. I know not what you would be able by any reason to say to the contrary.

Another argument you conclude thus: It was forbidden in the law that the
priest should be at the burial of the dead, therefore the Jews had no such
prescript form. Be The replyer had rather conform him self to the Jews than
^o this church
it so: but will you drive us to conform our selves to the Jews ceremonies?
do you think that touching the dead, or being at burialls will now make the
minister unclean? I understand not to what end you should allege any such
proofs, unless you would have us to return again to Iudaisme. This kind of
reasoning from the ceremonial law is not only of no force, but also very
dangerous, as though Christians were bound to behave themselves according to
that law. Surely it should seem that you could rather consent to the bringing
in of Iudaisme, than to the Christian orders now appointed in the Church. There
might be and so there was a prescripte form of burying the dead among the
Jews, although the Priest was absent: therefore, if this kind of reasoning
from the examples of the Jews were of any force, yet cannot this your argument
prove that there ought to be no prescripte form to bury the dead.

In the fourth place you reason thus: A new charge may not belayd upon the
minister, nor The duty of ministers not hindered by burying the dead.
he may not be taken from his necessary duties of feeding and governing his
flock. etc. but by burying the dead, a new charge is laid upon him, and he is
taken from his necessary duties. etc. therefore the minister may not bury the
dead. Your Minor is false, for it is no new charge, laid upon him: is it not
his duty to read the scriptures, to give thanks, to pray and to exhort in the
public congregation? does he not feed, when he so does? nay when is there a
more apt time of feeding? will you give him time to be Pa. 49. Se. vlt
absent from his flock upon his own business, as before you have done, and
shall he have no time to bury their dead? Surely I cannot conceive how this
function of burying the dead, should one jot hinder the minister f^o^ any one
part of his duty. And I think these reasons of yours too weak to allure any
man into your opinion, or to pluck down any thing that is already builded. If
you seek for alteration, you must use pro^ound and invincible proofs, for no
wise man will be moved to a change, without urgent and especial cause. I pass
over this and such like matters the more lightly, because I take the lightness
of your arguments to be such, as of themselves they be a sufficient discredit
to your cause, and add (with such a^ be learned, and not led by affection) a
greater strength and confirmation both to the doctrine, and also to the
government of this Church of England.

The threefolde peale, mourning apparel, burial sermons, the place of

sermons, give me leave to speak a little. It is no good reason to say, that
because mourning apparel is only used of custom, therefore it is
superstitious and heathenishe: many things be used of custom which be neither
superstitious nor heathenish, as to receive the communion before dinner, to
celebrate the Lords day on the Sunday, not on the Saturday, to preach in
pulpits, and such like. Mourning Mourning apparel ancient.
apparel is of great antiquity (as you know) and I think it is no matter
of religion, but of civility and order. If any man put religion in it, then no
doubt it is superstitious.

T. C. Page 161. Sect. 2.
For the mourning apparel, the Admonition Untruth, (...) their word^ be plain.
says not simply it is evil, because it is done of custom, but proves that
it is hypocritical oftentimes, for that it proceeds not from any sadness of
mind, which it does pretend, but worn only of ^ustome there being under a
mourning gown, oftentimes a merry heart. And considering that where there is
sorrow indeed for the dead, there it is very hard for a man to keep a
measure, that he do not lament too much: we ought not to use these means
whereby we might be further provoked to sorrow, and so go a great way beyond
the measure, which the Apostle appoints in mourning, no more than it was well
done of the Jews in the Gospel to provoke weeping and sorrow for their dead,
by some doleful noise, or 1. These. 4. Math. 9. John. 11.
sound of instrument, or then it was lawful for Mary Lazarus sister, to go to
her brothers grave, thereby to set the pri^t of her sorrow deeper in her mind.
Seeing therefore if there be no sorrow it is hypocritical to pretend it, and i^
there be* it is very dangerous to provoke it, or to carry the notes of
remembrance of it, it appears that this use of mourning apparel were much
better laid away than kept. And here M. Doctor th^eapes alittle kindness of
the authors of the Admonition, and Cyp. 4. sermon de mortalitate Augus. li.
2. de consolat. mortuorum
says that they know it is very anncient, whom before he denies to have any
knowledge of antiquity. Indeed it is very ancient, but M. Doctor is afraid
to show the a^ciencie of it, for Cyprian, and Augustine, inueigh vnhemently
against it, condemning it as unlawful and indecent.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of the Admonition be these. Nor of their strange mourning by
changing their garments (which if it be not hypocritical) yet is it
superstitious and heathenish, because it is used only of custom. Let the
Reader now judge, whether the Admonition does conclude this apparel to be
heathenish and superstitious, only because it is used of custom or no. Truly
in my simple judgment their words be playner, than that they can be excused.

Your reason of Hypocrisy is no more sufficient, to condemn mourning
apparel, than it is to condemn any other civil and decent o^der. By the like
reason I might improve your wearing of a turkey gown and a hat, because that
kind of apparel being a token of such persons, as mislike the gown and the
square cap, and pretend preciseness above the rest, is notwithstanding
commonly worn of such as in other places than in London, both wear and like
the other, and be precise neither in life nor doctrine. And what is it that I
cannot disprove, if this be a sufficient argument to say some me^ do abuse it,
or some men do hypocritically use it, Ergo it is not to be used.

Your other reason, that it provoke more service for the dead than is
convenient, if it were true that it so did (as you are not able to prove that
it is) yet must it receive the same answer, with the former argument, being
of the same nature: unless you will say, that we must not come near unto our
^riendes grave, or place where he is buried, we must not wear any of his
apparel, come in or near the place where he dyed, behold any thing that may
put us in mind of him, with an infinite such like things, because all these
move affections in a kind heart, and provoke it to weeping. But i^ is the
affection of the mind that is to be moderated and brideled, and not the
lawful use of decent and civil orders to be condemnad* For if we admit such
causes and excuses, I see not how any orders, either ecclesiastical or cy^ill,
especially in indifferent things, can be maintained. If any man wear such
apparel There is both a lawful and an vnl^w full use of mour^ing apparel.
of purpose to provoke sorrow, he is not to be excused: if for order and
civility, he is to be commended. And surely I see not why the wearing of
mourning apparel should not be profitable to put a man in mind of his own
mortality, seeing it carries a remembrance of death with it, and I think it
rather woorketh this effect in the wearer, than the other that you speak of.

The antiquity of this apparel appears in this, that (by your own
confession) it was in Cyprians time, as it appears in that 4. ser.
demortalitate, where he does not so much speak against the mourning apparel,
as he does against mourning immoderatly: and surely if the thing had bin so
greatly to be misliked, it should not still have had continuance in the Church
as it had, for Augustine likewise speaks of it sermon. 2. de consolat. mort. to
the same effect that Cyprian does. But there is no such immoderate mourning
for the dead in these days, the contrary rather appears.

and allow of them, as appears in the form of common prayers used of the
English Church in Geneua, and by him allowed.) But if it be so, I tell you
plainly, for my part I like not that reformation, except there be weightier
reasons than either you use, or I can perceive. I am sure that in ancient
churches of long time they have bin used, and the same you may see in the most
aunciente and best learned fathers.

Now touching the funeral sermons, M. Doctor takes on, and triumphs
maruellously, as though he had already gotten ye victory, but he that girdeth
his harness, should not boast as he that puts it of. There is more matter,
than peradventure M. Doctor is aware of, and that which is set down he
answers not, as that it nourishes an opinion that ye dead are the better for
it, which does appear in that there are none more desirous of funeral sermons
than ye Papists, which although they cannot abide the doctrine which is
preached, yet they will have such sermons, and those which will very seldom,
or not at all, be at other sermons, will not commonly miss one of these.
Furthermore for so much as the minister is driven oftentimes by this means to
preach upon a suddeyne, the word of God thereby is negligently handled,
especially of those whose gifts are not so great, as that they can provide in
so sma^l time, and by this negligent handling of the word of God, it is
brought into contempt.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely M. Doctor may well triumph, that so good a cause has no stronger
adversaries. Funeral sermons nourish not an opinion that the dead are the
better for them.
Your arguments are too too slender, and in deed very frivolous: The first is
this, that they nourishe an opinion that the dead are better for them, of the
which argument, because you are ashamed your self, you father it upon the
Admonition, wherein there is not one word spoken of any such reason. But why
does a funeral sermon nourish that opinion? forsooth, because the Papists be
most desirous of them. First, it is very strange to say that sermons nourishe
an opinion yt the dead are the better for them, when it is well known that
both he that preaches, thinks otherwise, and the end of preaching is to
root out of men's hearts such persuasions, which kind of sermons be most mete
at that time to be used, when such especial occasions be offered. Secondly, it
is as strange to think that Papists should for any such cause desire them,
who are persuaded the doctrine that is taught to be flat heresy, and the
preacher to be none of the church: and surely it is a strange fancy that can
imagine a Papiste to think that sermon to help the dead, which condemns
prayer for the dead, Purgatory, Masses, Diriges, Merits, and such like Popish
trashe, wherein the Papists place all their hope of help for the dead.
Wherefore if Papists be so desirous of these sermons (which I can not believe)
and in many of them it is indeed untrue, it is rather to avoid the suspicion
of Papistrie, than to procure any help to the dead.

The second argument you will have this, The minister is driven by this means

preach of a suddeyne, and thereby the word of God is negligently handled.
etc. and is this so good a reason? Do you remember what you answered before,
for the defense of preaching twyse in a day? you said it was a very simple
Sermon that had not some goodness Page. 123. Sect. 1.
and edyfying, and very slender meat, which is not better being given every
day, than the best and deyntyest meat once only in a month. etc. And how
can he be taken so unprovided, that is able to preach so often? or why should
the word of God be more negligently handled by a minister preaching a
funeral sermon upon suddeyne warning, than by the same minister preaching two
sermons every day? your memory waxes feeble toward the end of your book,
else would you not have so reasoned against your self. But why may not he that
preaches a funeral sermon have sufficient warning? or if he have not, why may
he not refuse to preach it? There is no order or law that does of necessity
bind him unto it.

Chap. 6. the. 6. Division.
T. C. Page 162. Sect. 2.
Moreover, considering that these funeral sermons are at the request of rich
men, and those which are in authority, and are very seldom at the burial of
the poor, there is brought into the church (contrary to the word of God) an
acceptance of persons, which ought not to be. For although the minister may
give to one more honor than to an other, according as the calling or degree
requires, yet in his ministry, and that which perteyueth unto his office, he
ought to show him self indifferent, and therefore preach as well at the death
of the poor, as of the rich, and because he cannot well do both, it is most
convenient to leave both.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is your third reason, but it touches only the person, and not the
cause, for it reproves the minister for not preaching as well at the burial
of the poor as of the rich: which if it be a fault it is the fault of the
man, not of the thing: and therefore no good reason to condemn funeral
sermons. But you say, he can not do both, and therefore it is most convenient
that he leave both: shall he at no time do good, because he can not do it at
all times? because he is not able to preach every day, shall he not therefore
preach once in the week? or if he be not able to preach once in the week,
shall he not therefore (being able) preach once in a fortnight? what kind of
reasoning call you this? And yet if your reason for preaching twyse a day
before mentioned, be good and allowable, I know not why ye minister may not be
able to preach at the burial, as well of the poor as of the rich, and yet
there may be sometimes more occasion, to preach at the burial of the rich,
than at the burial of the poor: neither is this that acceptatio^ of persons,
which is in scripture prohibited: for there be degrees of persons and several
dignities. Howbeit, funeral sermons be rather in the respect of the living than
of the dead.

Chap. 6. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page 162. Sect. 2.
If so be that M. Doctor will say, that it is good that notable and famous
men, should have their commendation, to the end that both the goodness of God
toward them, might be the better known, and others the sooner drawn to
follow their example, I grant it is so, and the scripture does both approve
it, and shows what mean is best to do that by. For so we read that Jeremy
2. Chro. 35. 2. sam. 1. and. 3.
the Prophet commended that godly and zealous Prince Josias in writing verses
of his death. He could have as easily preached, but this he thought the best
way. So did also David write verses at the death of Saul, and Jonathan, and
Abner, in which he commends their gifts and graces which the Lord had
bestowed upon them. There were in deed of ancient time funeral orations, as
appears in Gregory Nazianzene, but they sauoured of the manner of Athens,
where he was brought by: where also this custom of funeral orations was used,
as may be seen in the second book of Thucidides story by an oration of
Pericles. And although this custom was not in Nazianzens time so corrupt as
afterward: yet the departing from the examples of the purer churches, gave
occasion of further corruption which ensued. And to say the truth, it was
better used amongst the Athenians, than amongst the Christians. For there it
was merely civil, and the oration at the death of some notable personage, made
not by a minister, but by an orator appointed therefore: which I think may well
be done.

Io. Whitgifte.
Jeremy lamented Josias death, and writ verses upon it, David also writ
verses at the death of Saul, there were funeral orations in Nazianzens time,
and it is lawefull to have orations at the death of noble personages. etc.
therefore there may be no funeral sermons: this argument has neither
necessary nor probable conclusion, for they may both be used, and be so
commonly at the burial of notable personages. M. Fox reporting the use of the
The order of the Primitive church in funerals.
Primitive church in this matter, says thus. In funeralles priests then
flocked not together, selling Trentalles, and Diriges, for sweping of
purgatory, but only a funeral concion was used, with Psalms of praises and
songs of their worthy deeds: and alleluia sounding M. Fox par. 1 Page 146.
on high, which did shake the golden seelings of the temple, as witnesses
Nazianzene, Ambrose, and Jerome. etc.

Chap. 6. the. 8. Division.
T. C. Page 162. Sect. 2.
And if M. Doctor will say that there might be sermons although they be not
mentioned neither in the old Testament nor in the new, I have answered
before, that seeing the holy Ghost does describe so diligently the least
circumstances of burial, he would not have omitted that being the greatest.
And let it be observed, that this devise of man's brain, brings forth the
same fruit that other do, that is, dryueth quite away a necessary duty of
the minister, which is to comfort with the word of God, the parties which be
grieved at the death of their friends, that considering the sore is
particular, he apply unto it a particular plaster, which is very seldom or
never done, and yet a necessary duty, as of a good Christian, so especially
of the minister, which can best do it, and to whom it most apperteyneth.

Io. Whitgifte.
No, I say not only that, which you do not sufficiently improve, but this
also, that if there were none such then, yet may there be now, being a matter
perteyning to edifying, and to the preaching of the Gospel of Christ. And you
can no more prove by this argument, that there ought to be no funeral sermons,
than you can prove that there ought to be no women at the receiving of the
communion, or no baptism mininistred in churches, with diverse such like
things, whereof there is no express mention that they were in the Apostles time.

An other of your weighty arguments is this. The minister ought to comfort with
the word of God, the parties that be grieved at ye death of their friends,
therefore he may not preach a funeral sermon. I must still deny your argument,
being to too simple. For may he not do both if need require? may he not before
his sermon, in his sermon, and after his sermon Funeral sermons serve to
comfor^e those that are grieved.
comfort the parties grieved? That is one good use of funeral sermons,
especially when there are a number so grieved, whom he can not so well
particularly comfort, because of the number, as he may jointly, in a godly
and fruitful sermon: and I have not heard or red, but that God works as
effectually in the hearts of the hearers, by public sermons, as he does by
private exhortations, and that even in matters of salvation, and therefore much
more in matters of lesser importance. But as I said before, this preaching at
the burial, does nothing hinder this private exhortation, if he be so
disposed: and therefore of all other your arguments, this is one of the worste.

Chap. 6. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page 162. Sect. 2.
And where as M. Doctor asks, when there is a better time to speak of death
and of mortality, than at ^urial, surely if it had been so sit, the Prophets
and Apostles would never have lost that opportunity, or let pass that occasion
of aduauncing and making effectual their preaching. What if it be answered It
were very ^ondly answer*
that for as much as our life, is a continual meditation of death, it is not
sal^e to use this custom, ^or that it tieth our cogitation to so short a
time, as the tune of burial is, which ought to be extended to the whole
course of our life. But I answer that it may be well done without any such
funeral sermons, when the minister takes occasion of the death of any which
is lately departed, to speak of the vanity of the life of man.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Prophets and Apostles did not preach at burials, therefore it is not a
most convenient time to speak of death and of mortality. The antecedent is
doubtful, and not proved, and though it were true, the argument follows not,
for it is your usual kind of reasoning negatiuely of authority. But why have
you not made here any mention of the other things contained in my Answer to
the Admonition, which be necessary points to be entreated of, and most fit
for that tune: as purgatory, ^rentals. etc?

Again you reason thus: our life is a continual meditation of death, and by
funeral sermons An absurd argum^t against funeral sermons.
it is tied unto a short time as the tune of burial is, therefore funeral
sermons be not lawefull: the putting of us in mind of our mortality by
funeral sermens, is no hindraunce to our continual meditation of it, but an
help rather and a means to stir it up and to revive it. We ought at all
times to meditate of the death of Christ, but must we therefore refuse at some
times to receive the sacrament of the supper, whereby we are put in mind
thereof? or does the receiving of this sacrament once in a monthe, restrain our
meditation of Christ's death to that time only? does a sermon preached of the
death of Christ, at some times appointed, bind our cogitation to that time
only? surely then are we very unprofitable hearers. Wherefore although our life
be a con^inuall meditation of death, yet can it not be but most profitable for
us, to be put in mind thereof at some one time, more than at other some time,
and especially at that time when we see with our eyes that which we hear with
our ears. And what can this reason more prevail against sermons at burials,
than it may do against sermons at the administration of the Sacraments, or
any other appointed or set time? The like or the same kind of argument you
used before against the feast of Easter, (...). 120. (...). ^2
and other such like days, where I have in like manner answered the same. I
think verily that by this time you are ashamed of it.

At the length you say that it may be well done, without any such funeral
sermons, etc. and therefore there may be no funeral sermons. And I say it may
as well and better be done in and by funeral sermons, and therefore funeral
sermons may be, etc.

English church in Geneua had that in the book of common prayer, yet (as I
have heard of those which were there present) it was no^ so used. And if it had
been, yet thereby it is not proved that M. Calvin allowed of it. For with
things wherein there was no great and manifest disorder, M. Calvin did bear
that which he liked ^t of. And there being no Papists in all the city, and
all being well instructed, there was no such^ ^unger in a funeral sermon

the church of Geneua, which will not I am sure condemn our use in these

those places most necessary, where there are most Papists, because they
minister especial occasion to confute these errors, wherein the Papists be
most blinded, and from the which they are with most difficulty drawn. But we
must permit unto you your paradoxes, and your fancies, else all is marred.

You say you will not speak of the abuse of those that take nobles for such
Sermons, having otherwise to live, neither will I defend them if they either
exact it, or require it, or take it with offense. Yet if it be given unto them
by the will of the dead, or for the better solemnizing of the burials of such
as be noble or worshipful, I see no cause why it should be unlawful for them,
to take that which by such means is given unto them: otherwise I think it not
meet for preachers to make a common or usual gain of it.

That must be remembered (which I had almost forgotten) how untruly and
slaundero^slye M. doctor says that ye authors of the Admonition do compare the

If with that mind and sense you say, the holy Communion is in stead of the
Mass, that they say, burial Sermons are put in the place of trentals, you
say wickedly and ungodly: for they speak it in the evil part, to the
deprauing of those sermons: therefore I slander them not, but they
slanderously speak of the preaching of ye word of God. And for my upright
dealing with them in this point, I refuse not the judgment, of any man that
has judgment.

of it, seeing there has always been an appointed place for the same, even
from Abraham to this day.

T. C. Page 163. Lin. 10.
Touching the place of burial, I have spoken before. And although it be not to
be misliked, that there should be a common place to bury in yet the places
which M. doctor poynteth us unto, prove the clean contrary. For by the story
o^ Abraham's place of burial, it appears that ye manner was that every one
was buried in his own several ground, as may appear also by that, that the
Eua^geliste Math. 27.
says, that there was a field bought to bury the strangers in, which had no
place of their own, which was also used sometimes in the churches under the
Gospel, as appears by the story of Theodoret, which I have before recited,
and in the latter end of a funeral oration, which Gregory Naz^anzene made
of the death of his brother Cesarius. And so by this reason M. Doctor would
have every one buried in his own possession.

Io. Whitgifte.
There have been place^s always appointed to bury the dead in, dedicated to
that use only, and therefore there may be so now, neither have you one word
in any approved writer to the contrary. The conuenience of the place, and the
pointing of it out, is in the power of those that have authority, and be
governors of the common wealth and church, and with that place that by them
is thought most convenient we ought to be contented. Neither do I hear any
reason to prove that there ought to be any alteration of the places already
appointed.

Whatsoever you have spoken to the contrary in the other place, I have there

I know not what you mean by the half communion, I find no such word in
the Communion book: If you mean the communion in one kind, you speak
untruly and slanderously of the book, and of this whole church: if you mean
the scriptures and prayers appointed to be read when there is no Communion,
then do you unjustly liken them to the commemoration of the Mass, being most
fruitful scriptures, and godly prayers.

Admonition.
The eight. The public baptism, that also is full of childysh and
superstitious toys. First in their prayer they say, that God by the baptism
of his son Jesus Christ, did sanctify the flood Iordane, and all other
waters, to the mystical washing away of sin, attributing that to the sign
which is ( 1. John. 1. 7. Acts. 20. 28 Romans 3. 24.
) proper to the work of God in the blood of Christ, as though virtue were in
water to wash away sins.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 189. Sect. 6. 7. 8.
By the first you say, that we attribute to the sign that which is proper
to the work of God in the blood of Christ, as though virtue were in water to
wash away sin.

You know very well that we teach far otherwise, and that it is a certain
and true doctrine of all such as profess the Gospel, that the outward signs
of the Sacrament, do not contain in them Outward sacraments do not give grace
grace, neither yet that the grace of God is of necessity tied unto them, but
only that they be seals of Gods promyses, notes of Christianity, testimonies
and effectual signs of the grace of God, and of our redemption in Christ
Jesus, by the which the spirit of God does inuisiblye work in us, not only
the increase of faith, but confirmation also.

You understand likewise, that this difference there is betwixt these
external elements, being selected to be sacramental signs, Sacramental
signs.
(that is, betwixt water in baptism, and common water: bread and wine in the
Eucharist, and usual bread and wine) that these now be sacraments sanctified to
an other use, to a spiritual use, to the norishing of faith, and feeding of the
soul, to be instruments of the holy Ghost, by the which as by instruments we
be fed to eternal life. Furthermore, you can not be ignorant, that whosoever
co^temneth these external signs, and refuses them, can not be a member of
Christ, neither yet saved.

Last of all you have learned, that there is such a similitude betwixt Page
190. Sect. 1. 2.
the signs, and the thing signified, that they are not only in Scripture
usually called by the names of those things where of they be Sacraments (as
bread the body of Christ, and water regeneration) but also that the contumely
or contempt done to the one, does redounde to the other, that is, the
contempt of the signs, is the contempt of the things signified, and therefore
S. Paul says. 1. Cor. 11. He that eats and drinks vnvvorthily, eats and
drinks his own damnation, Non dijudicans corpus domini. And Christ, John.
3. Except a man be borne of water and the spirit, he can not enter into the
kingdom of heaven.

These things being considered, it is no superstitious toy, but a godly and
true saying, that Christ has sanctified all waters (used in Baptysyng) to
the mystical washyng away of sin: not ascrybing, or attributyng washyng
away of sin to the external elemente, any otherwise, than instrumentallye,
or in any other respect than for the similitude that Sacraments have with
the things whereof they be Sacraments: for we know that wicked men may
receive these external signs, and yet remain the members of Satan. It is
certainly true, that the mystical washing away of sin is proper to the work
God in the blood of Christ, and for that purpose you might have alleged much
more playner and directer places of Scripture, than most of these which you
have noted in your margent: but I think your meaning is not therefore to
condemn the outward signs and Sacraments, as the heretics called
Messalians, did.

confirm it. Whatsoever S. Paul requires in that place, is used in that
book of Service: for first the whole Service is in a tongue known (as S.
Paul there requires) that the people may understand and say Amen. Then are
the Scriptures read* the Sacraments ministered according to Christ's own
institution, those that be Godly disposed persons know what a manifest untruth
this is that you here utter.

But mad men, women and children, must have their words. etc.

If by tossing of Psalms, you mean the singing of them, alternatim, then do
you disallow that which is both commendable, and of great antiquity, as it
appears in an Epistle that Basilius Magnus, did write to the Ministers in
Neocaesaria, where he shows the self same order of singing Psalms to be
then used in the Church, that we use at this day.

If by tossing of Psalms like tennise balls, you mean the over hasty
reading or singing of them, it is indeed to be misliked: but it is no part of
the book, and therefore no cause why you should absteyne from subscribing to
it.

world believe, that this ^ocrat. 6* ^. 8. cap. Platin. cap. Damas. Theod. 2.

considering that when it is granted that all the people may praise God (as it
is in singing of Psalms) there this ought not to be restrained unto a few,

incommoditie which comes this way, in that being tossed after this sort, me^
cannot understand what is song, these other two inco^uemences come of this
form of singing. and therefore is banished in all reformed churches.

Io. Whitgifte.
To the slanderous untruth of the Admonition, or to my answer there unto, you
say nothing, but pass it over.

S. Paul used a profane proverb in very serious and divine matters, when he
said: Cretenses semper mendaces. etc. ad. Ti. 1. and therefore it well
beseems a Doctor of Tit. 1.
^itie, aptly and fitly applying it. But why do you not find fault with the
Authors of the Admonition who use a more profane proverb, (that is, tossing
of tennise balls) in as serious a matter?

You confess that singing of Psalms by course, and side after side is very
^uncient, and therefore I shall not need to labor in proving that: the
diversity of opinions touching the original of it, cannot prejudice the
thing: and yet if Ignatius were the Author of it, as Socrates lib. 6. cap. 8.
says, it is not the less to be esteemed, but I will examine your Socr. li. 6.
cap. 8
reasons. When it is granted (you say) that all the people may praise God, it
ought not to be restrained to a few: this is soon answered, for all the
people may sing if they can and will: and those that sing not in voice may sing
in heart, for the Psalms are soong in a tongue that is known: and some there be
that can neither read nor sing, such of necessity must hearken to those that
sing, and join with them in heart. You add, that where they may sing the
whole Psalm both with voice and heart, it is not meet they should sing with
heart only, for where they may both with heart and voice sing, there the heart
is not enoughe. Where learn you this in scripture? will you set down general
and absolute rules, and not tell us upon what authority they be grounded? This
is tootoo Popelike, whose words will stand for reason, whom none must ask
why does he so, or says so. The prayer of the heart alone when a man may also
pray with voice, is of great Prayer by heart only, effectual.
force, and very effectual, as the example of Anna in the first of Samuel
does declare. I grai^t that in the public congregation God is to be called
upon both in heart and voice, but yet if a man at some times either because of
the order appointed by the Church, or upon some other occasion do hold his
peace, and desire that in heart only, which other sing* or pray in voice, no
doubt he prays effectually. Saint Paul. 1. Cor. 14. speaking of praying and
thanksgiving in the public Congregation says: Else 1. Cor. 14.
when thou blessest with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the rowme
of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knows not what
thou say? Of the which words it may evidently be gathered, that one said
the prayers, and the rest of the people joined with him in heart, and therefore
said Amen, when he had ended his prayers. And so does M. Calvin interpret this
place. You see then how far your rule is wide from the rule of S. Paul. For
even in the public congregation, he allows one to pray in heart and voice,
and all the rest to pray in heart only. Wherefore, where they may both with
heart and voice sing, there to sing with the heart is enough. But Lord how you
forget your self: before you found fault with the book b^se ^
the people repeated their prayers after the minister, and that because the
Minister is the only mouth of the people to the Lord. etc. now (as though
you were not the same m^ but played some other part) you find fault with the
order of Service because they ^ not their own mouths to the Lord: then to
pray with heart was sufficient: now it is not enough: whence this co^trarietie
should spring I cannot imagine, except I should ascribe it to a froward and
preposterous desire that you have to deface this Church: ^
but because I have touched this more largely in the proper place, I will
content my self with the only noting of it in this place.

If you will say it was then the manner of the Church, that one should pronounce
the prayers, the rest harkening unto him, and therefore could not without the
breaking of order speak: the same I say unto you: that this has been of long
time the general order of the Church to s^g bysides, and therefore may not
without disorder be broken, so long as the Church does think it convenient to
be kept, as a lawful and convenient order.

The Psalms being song, may as well be understood as being said, and
better too. If it be otherwise, the fault is not in singing, but in the manner
of s^ging, which is the fault of the persons, not of the thing. And therefore
that is but a very weak reason, and it is a non causa.

VValking, talking, reading, private praying of the people in time of common
prayers, serving of two cures, games played in the after noone on the Sabbath
day, as lying for the whetstone, etc. be faults worthy of punishment, where
they be used, but they are not within the contents of the book, and they are

of all good men misliked. So you might have burdened Saint Paul, and other
Preachers, with the faults of the Churches of Corinth, and Galatians, and the
residue of the Apostles, with the superstitions of the Jews converted in the
primitive Church, and all good rulers with such faults as corruption of time
breeds.

Unto two very good reasons which the Admonition uses, to show the
inconvenience of making curte^e, and standing at the name of Jesus, and at the
Gospel rather than at other names of God, and the rest of the Scripture,
whereof the one is, that it is against decency and good order. which is broken
by scraping of the feet, and the other that it may breed a dangerous opinion
of the inequality either of the son of God, with the other persons, or of
the Gospels with other Scriptures. M. Doctor says that it is an indifferent
thing, and neither takes away their reasons, nor sets down any of his
own: this is a slender defense. And it is no malicious dealing to note those
faults which are so general and so open, and yet notwithstanding uncorrected
or unreformed by those, by whom M. Doctor would make us believe that the
Church is best governed. But I pray you tell me, why do you condemn the
serving of two cures, that allow the having of two benefices? If it be no fault
to have two benefices, how is it one, to have two cures? For the Curate is
better able to read his service in two places, than the Pastor to discharge his
office in two Churches.

Io. Whitgifte.
The first reason of hindering the word by the noise made with scraping the
see^ upon the ground, as it is used by them in derision, so is it of it self
ridiculeus, and not worthy to be answered: besides it is untrue, for it
hinders no more the word being read, than hawking and spitting bindereth
the same being preached. But Lord how sparing are you of time, that will not
spare so much as may serve a man to bow his knee in. Well it is but a pretense,
to help out with a merry argument: for I dare say neither they nor you are so
indiscreet, as to use it in good sadness.

Their second reason hash some more gravity in it, though not much more
weight, and your addition, that it may breed a dangerous opinion of the
inequality either of the Sanne of God with the other persons, or of the
Gospel with other Scriptures, is but supposed, and a man may suppose the Moon
to be made of green cheese. That gesture at the name of Jesus has hitherto
continued in the Church many hundred years, and yet never any was heard tell
of, that fell into either of these opinions by the means thereof.

One reason that moved Christians in the beginning the rather to bow at the Why
Christians bowed at the name of Jesus.
name of Jesus, than at any other name of God, was because this name was most
hated and most contemned of the wicked Jews, and other persecutors of such as
professed the name of Jesus: for the other names of God they had in reverence,
but this they could not abide: wherefore the Christians to signify their faith
in Jesus, and their obedience unto him, and to confute by open gesture the
wicked opinion of the Jews and other infidels, used to do bodily reverence,
at all times when they heard the name of Jesus, but especially when the Gospel
was read, which contained that glad tidings of salvation which is procured unto
man by Christ Jesus, whereupon also he is called Jesus, that is, a Savior.
Neither can it be against christianity to show bodily reverence, when he is
named by whom not only all the spiritual enemies of mankind are subdued, but
also the faithful be made partakers of the kingdom of heaven. Wherefore as I
bind no man of necessity to this reverence at the name of Jesus, so do I not
judge any man that (having knowledge) uses the same: for I will not holster
and defend superstitious ignorance.

It must needs be malicious dealing, to charge the common order and book of
public prayer, with particular faults of private men and places. If you know
where these abuses be, and will complain of them either to the Archbishop or
Bishop, I dare say they will reform them.

There is better reason why one Pastor may have two benefices, than one Curate
serve in two cures, for ministering of the Sacraments and reading public
prayers daily, does require more bodily attendance than the preaching of the
word. A man may better in one day preach at two Churches, than he can at them
both minister the Sacraments, and celebrate public prayers. That Pastor that
has two benefices, and two good Curates at them both, may with much more
facility do his duty, both toward his Churches particularly, and the whole
Church generally.

Of Cathedral Churches. etc. Tract. 22.
Admonition.
As for Organs and curi^ns singing, though they be proper to popish dens, I
mean to Cathedral Churches, yet some others also must have them. The Queens
Chapel, and these Churches must be paterns and presidents to the people of
all superstitions.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 206. Sect. 1.
Here it pleases you to call Cathedral Churches, Popish dens, As hap is
your words are no slander. But this brag I will make of Cathedral
Churches, and such as be now in them, I will offer unto you a dozen Cathedral
Churches in England (which I my self do know) the worst whereof in learning,
shall encounter with all Papists, Puritanes, Anabaptists, and what other sects
soever in England, for the defense of religion now professed, either by word
or writing. Without arrogancy be it spoken, I think there was never time
wherein these Churches were better furnished with wise, learned and godly men,
than they be at this day. I speak not this boastingly, but to Gods glory, the
honor of the Prince, the comfort of the godly, and the shame of slanderous
Papists, and disdainful Schismatikes.

Your slanderous speech of the Queens Majesty's Chapel, which you also say
to be a pattern and president to the people of all superstitions, is rather
severely to be punished, than with words to be confuted.

T. C. Page. 163. toward the end. and Page 164. Sect. 1.
As for the speech of the cathedral Churches, either it is nothing or else it
is false. For if he say that there is either in all those cathedral Churches
one, or in every of those 12. churches one, which is able to confute Papists.
etc. What great thing says he, which says no more of all these Churches, than
is to be found in one poor house of the university, whose rentes are scarce
300. pound by year? Yea what has he said of them which was not to be found
in them even in Queen Mary's time, when there was yet some one almost in every
Church, which for fear dissembling, was able notwithstanding to confute the
Papists, Anabaptists, Puritanes. And if he mean that in those twelve houses,
the worst of the Prebendaries are able to defend the truth against all
Papists, etc. all men do know the untruth of it, so that although this
sentence be very doubtfully put forth, yet how so ever it be taken, it is as
M. Doctor has rightly termed it, a mere brag. And yet I doubt not, and a^
well assured, that there be diverse godly learned men which have livings in
those places, but for all that they cease not therefore to be dens of
loyterers and idle persons, whilst there are nourished there some which serve
for no profitable use in the Church, their offices being such as bring no
commodity, but rather hurt, of which number certame are which the Admonition
speaks of in the. 224. page: some other which having charges in other places,
under the color of their Prebendes there, absent themselves from them: and
that which they spoil and raven in other places, there they spend and make
good cheer with, and therefore not without good cause called dens. Finally
there being nothing there, which might not be much better applied, and to the
greater commodity of the Church, whilst they might be turned into Colleges,
where young men might be brought up in good learning, and made fit for the
serutce of the Church and common wealth, the universities being not able to
receive that number of scholars, wherewith there need may be supplied.

And where M. D. says, that that which is spoken of the Queens majesty's
chapel, is worthy rather to be punished, than confuted, if so be that these
be abuses, the example of them in her matesties chapel, cannot be but most
dangerous, which with all humble submission and reverence, I beseech her
Majesty duly to consider.

Io. Whitgifte.
My speech is very plain and without all ambiguitie, I say there is a dozen
Cathedral Churches in England, the worst of the which Churches in learning
shall encounter with all papists. etc. My meaning can not be so dark as you
would seem to make it: but because your understanding is so dull, when any
thing is spoken to the commendation of any other than of your self, I will
more plainly declare my meaning: which is this, that there is not one of these
dozen Churches, but has a sufficient number of learned men, to perform
what so ever I have promised, how so ever boastinglye, which I acknowledge to
be my infirmity, but yet there unto constreyned by the arrogancy of such, qui
cupiunt soli videri aliquid esse. Your opprobrious speeches spoken of those
Churches, as mere slanders, and proceeding from a mind overcome with envy,
and contempt of other, I pass over, affirming still the same that is contained
in mine Answer to the Admonition, the which you may well snap and bite at in
words, but in deed you shall never be able to steyne those places: and
whatsoever you pretend to the universities, yet your good will is as much
toward the one as it is toward the other, they both depending upon one
threede.

But if there be abuses in her Majesty's Chapel (as you suppose) why have you
not sought the reformation thereof orderly? Why have you sought it
tumultuously? why have you libelled against it? why have you sought it with
spiteful words, with disquieting the Church, without all duty and order?

225. page as that they are necessary (which he does barely say) and that S.

instruments of those which desire the spoil of them, and that a man may as
well speak against Uniuersities and Colleges, as ag^ynst them, I have answered
before, saving that it is to be feared, that Colleges in Uniuersities (if M.
Doctor may work that which he goes about) will shortly be in little better

remedy be therefore provided.

Io. Whitgifte.
If I may work that which (you say I go about, I trust it shall be nothing that
derogateth either from the glory of God, the honor of the Prince, the peace of
the church, the commendation of the university, or the increase of godliness,
and learning. I thank god I neither have gone about any thing, nor intend to
do, whereof I am either ashamed The (...) the (...) hot and ^ter (...).
or afraid to make mine account. But who sees not your grief? In deed I may
not suffer those with whom I have to do, to disquiet ye University or College
with false doctrine and schismatic opinions: I may not suffer them openly to
break and contemn those laws and statutes which they are sworn to observe,
and I to execute: I may not suffer any man against the express words of his
oath, against all honesty and conscience to live under me, least I be partaker
of his perjury: these be the things that I have done, and these be the things
that I intend to do: whereby as hitherto I have kept the place where I am, in
some quiet and good order, so do I trust to continue it, both to the glory of
God, the honor of the Prince, the great increase of learning, the edifying of
Christ's Church, and the commendation both of the College and the whole
University.

And howsoever you have by word and writing sought to deface both me and The
college delivered from the slanderous Reply.
the College: yea the whole university for my sake (contrary to the express
words of your oath, as I said in the beginning) yet are you in act and deed
confuted, though I should not speak one word: for contrary to your
expectation and practice of your instruments, and earnest desire of all that be
factious, the College was never in better quietness, never replenished with
more toward scholars, never fuller of students of all degrees (I speak it to
Gods glory and to deliver it from your slanders) than it is at this present.
A great occasion of all these blissinges of God (as instruments and means) is
the gravity, the honesty, the wisdom, the learning, the discrete government
of those, whom you call non residentes: whom not I but the noble founders
statutes, ratified by the Queens Majesty's authority, and allowed of by the
wysest of the realm, for most just consideration, even for the better
government of the College, being otherwise full of youth, have licensed (being
in the number of the twelve preachers chosen according to statute) to continue
in their felowships with one living besides, to a certain valewe. If there
were the like provision in other places, and the same furnished with such kind
of men, the state of diverse Colleges in Cambridge, would not be so tumultuous,
as it is.

Touching the parties themselves, against whom you so bitterly whette your The

tongue, upon the same causes and quarrels you do against me, this I will
speak unfeignedly, as I shall answer before God and the world: they are
sober, honest, wise, quiet men, faithful and learned preachers, and that time
of absence which is given unto them by statute, they do carefully bestow in
their cures, and other places where there is need, according to their duty
and conscience, except the necessary government of the College, and public
utility do constrayne them to the contrary. The worste of them and he that is
most negligent, does more good in the Church and common wealth, than you do,
or any of your adherentes. I will not speak all that I might justly, least I
should seem to flatter, and in part to commend my self: but this is the
sum, none of us refuse trial, either of life, government, learning, living,
or what soever is to be required in the ministers of God, and dutiful
subjects toward their Prince.

It is an egregious slander when you say, they be pernicious examples of
riotous feastinges, etc. I know the contrary: and think not you, but God will
take due punishment of this your notorious malice, uttered upon private
quarrel, as it is well known to all this society. In deed they love one an
other, agree among themselves, obey laws, keep order, labor to suppress
Schisms, and this is that, that whetteth your tongue, and the tongues of other
disordered persons against them. I could requite all these your hard speeches,
if I were disposed to deal so maliciously: But I will temper my self,
desiring God not to impute these things unto you: the Reader I shall desire
either to judge the best, or to suspende his judgment until he have the

You say all these come from the Pope, etc. It is not material from whence

If you had read any ancient learned Authors (as your writings declare you

against Cathedral churches, which you may not as well speak against the
Colleges in the universities? They were not in the Apostles time neither yet
in the primitive Barbarism and confusion secretly intended.

all to confusion and barbarism.

You say, no reformed church in the world knows them, wherein I think you
speak more than you know. Can you name any reformed church that has plucked
them down? Peradventure in diverse places where the gospel is now preached,
they had never such rewards for learning. But what have we to do in such cases
with other reformed churches? we have to consider what is most meet for this
church, and state: and not to follow other, as though we were children: I see
no cause why other reformed churches should not rather follow us, than we them,
seeing in no respect we be inferior to them. Well, to conclude, your words be
but vain, and your proofs none at all: and therefore I doubt not but
Cathedral churches shall be able to withstand both your opprobrious speeches,
and the greediness of all their adversaries, so long as it shall please God to
bless this land with so virtuous and learned a Queen, and so wise and
discrete counselors.

Canons, Petycanons, prebe^daries, etc. come from ye Pope, it is, as if he

from the Devil: and where he adds this condition (if it be good. etc.) in
deed if of the eggs of a Cokatrice can be made wholesome meat to feed with,

But for so much as those ancient Collegiate churches were no more like unto
those which we have now, than things most unlike, our Cathedral churches have
not so much as this old worn cloak of Antiquity, to hide their nakedness,
and to keep out the shower. For the Collegiate churches in times past were a
Senate ecclesiastical, standing of godly learned ministers and elders, which
governed and watched over that flock which was in ye city or town where such
churches were, and for that in such great cities and towns commonly there were
the most learned pastors and ancients, therefore the towns and villages round
about in hard and difficuite causes, came and had their resolutions of their
doubts at their hands, even as also the Lord commanded in Deuteron^e, Deuteronomy.

that when there was any great matter in the country, which the Le^tes in
matters perteyning to God, and the judges in matters perteyning to the common
wealth, could not discuss, that then they should come to Jerusalem, where
there was a great number of Priests, Le^tes, and learned judges, of whom they
should have their questions dissolved, and this was the first use of Collegiate
churches.

Io. Whitgifte.
True it is, that in times past there was in every city, Collegium
presbyterorum cui In every city a college of (...).
praeerat Episcopus, a College of ministers over whom the Bishop bare rule,
the which lerome calls Senatum Ecclesiae, the Senate of the church: and the
same is now called a collegiate or Cathedral church. It is also evident that
these Presbyteri, were all Priests, and that they with the Bishop had the
deciding of al controversies in doctrine or ceremonies, and the direction of
diverse other matters in all those places that were under that city, that is in
all that shyre or Diocese: and therefore says M. Calvin (speaking Institut.
cap. 8. Sect. 52.
of the primitive church) Every city had a college of Seniors which were
Pastors and Doctors, for they all had the office of preaching to the people, of
exhorting, and of correcting, the which office S. Paul does commit to Bishops:
and this is that Seigniorie, whereof the ancient writers speak so much, and
which you untruly and without consideration say to have been in every parish,
and to consist as well of other as of Priests, and Ministers of the word, and
although that kind of government, which these churches had, is transferred to
the Civil Magistrate, to whom it is due, and to such as by him are appointed,
yet is it not so clean blotted out, as you would make us believe. For Our
Cathedral churches not much differing from those of ancient time.
the Bishop who was then, and is now the chief of that college or Church,
keeps his authority still, and may if he please call to gither those
ministers or Priests of the Cathedral Church to consult of such things as are

Afterward the honor which the smaller Churches gave unto them in asking them
council* they took unto themselves, and that which they had by the curtesy
and good will proceeding of a reverent estimation of them, they did not only
take unto them of right, but also dispossessed them of all authority of hearing
and determining any matters at all, And in the end they came to this which they
are now, which is a company that have strange names and strange offices,
unheard of of all the purer churches, of whom the greatest good that we can hope
of is, that they do no harm. For although there be diverse which do good, yet
in respect that they be Deanes, Prebendaries* Canons, Petycanons, etc. for my
part I see no profit but hurt come to the church by them.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is untrue, and your own enely imagination: for these Churches have
not increased their authority, but diminished it rather, as it is evident. The
names Tract. 8. Ca. 2.
and offices used in them, I have proved before in the title of Archbishops,
etc. to be neither strange nor unheard of in the purer and ancient Churches.
And though you see no profit that comes to the Church by them, yet those
that be quietly disposed in the Church, those that have a care for the good
government of the Church, those that have not by any schism divided themselves
from the Church, see great profit and singular commodity.

for holes and dens to keep them in, which either are unworthy to be kepce

only I add, that they were not counted only false Prophets which taught
corrupt doctrine, but those which made the people of God believe, that they
were happy when they were not, and that their estate was very good, when it
was corrupt. Of the which kind of false prophecy I say and Jeremy especially
do complain. And therefore unless M. Doctor amend his speech, and leave this
crying, peace, peace, all is well, when there are so many things out of order,
and that not by the judgment of the Admonition and favorers thereof only,
but even of all which are not willingly blind, I say if he do not amend
these speeches, the crime of false prophecy will sit closer unto him, than
he shall be ever able to shake of, in the terrible day of the Lord.

learning, and be learned, as there must be means to maynteyne men whiles
they be in learning. Grammar schools, and the Uniuersities serve for the one:
and Cathedral churches with such other preferments serve, for the other:
spoil the one and the other can not possibly stand. Your immodest and
uncharitable speeches work most discredit to your self.

That which I speak of other Churches by way of comparison, I speak for the
truth of the doctrine, sincere administration of the Sacraments, and all other
points of Religion, by public authority established in this Realm, wherein I
say again, that there is no cause why it should give place to any Church that
n^we is. And yet I do not defend the faults of men, or other corruptions
(from the which no Church is free.) But for the crime of false prophecy
wherewith you charge me, I trust it be far from me: I would pronenesse to
contention, and uncharitable judging* were as far from you. Howbeit we both
must stand or fall to our own Lord: and therefore it is no good judging before
the time.

Of civil Officies in Ecclesiastical persons. Tract. 23.
A trial of the places alleged by the Admonition, against such civil offices
as are exercised by Ecclesiastical persons in this realm.
Chap. 1. the. 1. Division.
T. C. Page 165. Sect. 3.
The places alleged by the Admonition to prone that ministers of the church
may not intermeddle with civil functions (one only excepted) are well and
fitly alleged: and most of them used to that end of writers, which if I
should name, Lord how low would you throw him down.
all would confess, that they are such as with whom M. Doctor is not worthy to
be so much as spoken of the same day.

Io. Whitgifte*
This is more than modesty would suffer, and tootoo outrageous: for whatsoever
the worthiness of these men is otherwise, yet am Ia minister of the word as
well as they: I am a member of the Church of Christ as well as they: I am
bought with his blood as well as they: and therefore to say, that I am not
worthy to be so much as spoken of the same day wherein they are named: is but
extreme immodestie, and passing contempt. There is not so much attributed to
Jesus Christ: nor the Popes flatterers, did never so excessiuely extol him.
Are they so worthy that a man may not be spoken of the same day that they are
named? who be they trow we, or what is their names? But belike you are afraid
to name them, least by speaking of me the same day you should do unto them
some great dishonor: in your judgment they are better than God himself, for
the simplest that is may be named the same day that God is. In deed a pretty
cloak to cover your vain bragging, for I think you would have named them,
if you had known them. But to the matter.

Moreover, in that they have ( Luc. 9. 60. 61. Luc. 12. 14. Romans 12. 7. 1. Tim.

civil offices joined to the Ecclesiastical, it is against the word of God.
As for an Archbishop to be a Lord president, a Lord Bishop to be a County
Palatine, a prelate of the Garter, who has much to do at S* Georges feast when
the Bible is carried before the Procession in the crosses place, a Justice of
peace, or Justice of Quorum, an high Commissioner. etc. And therefore they have
their prysons, as Clinkes, G^t: houses, Colehouses, towers and ^astles, which
is also against the Scriptures. This is not to have keys but swords, and
plain tokens they are, that they exercise that which they would so feign seem
to want, I mean dominion over their brethren.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 214. Sect. 2.
To prove that civil offices joined to the Ecclesiastical is against the
word of God, first you note Luke. 9. verse. 60. 61. where it is thus written.
And Jesus said unto him, let the dead bury the dead, but go thou and preach
the kingdom of God. Then an other said I will follow thee Lord, but let me
first go bid them farevvell which are at my house. How conclude you any thing
of these places against civil offices in Ecclesiastical persons? Christ's
meaning in this place is to teach us (I mean all Christians) that when he
calls us, we ought not to be hindered from following (and that forthwith) by
any excuse of doing duty toward our friends, or respect of worldly
commodity, or for fear of any pain or trouble, and this is spoken generally
to all Christians, and not alone to any one kind of men.

T. C. Page 165. Sect. 4.
For the first place if so be that the minister ought rather to leave
necessary duties of burying 9. Lu^.
his father, and saluting his friends undone, than that he should not
accomplish his ministry to the full, much more he ought not to take upon him
those things, which are not only not necessary duties, but as it shall
appear, do in no case belong unto him. And although it may be applied to all
Christians, yet it does most properly belong unto the ministers.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is no answer to that which I have said: for I say that the meaning of
Christ in this place is, that when we are called to eternal life by him we
ought not to protracte the time, nor to seek any delays, but leave all and
follow him: this is the meaning of Christ, and this is the sum of my Answer:
and to this you say nothing: but make a new collection, that the minister ought
rather to leave necessary duties of burying his father. etc. which (though it
be not the direct sense of this place) yet I grant it to be true: for such
civil offices as I allow in Ecclesiastical persons are helps for them to do
their duties. Wherefore as this place is unaptly applied by the Admonition, so
is it unanswered by you, and it may as well be used to debar anyother
Christians from civil functions, as ministers of the word.

Chap. 1. the. 3. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 215. Sect. 1..
Secondly, for the same purpose you use Luke. 12. verse. 14. where Christ
speaking to him that said unto him, Master bid my brother divide the
inheritance with me, answers on this sort, Man who made me a judge or a
deuider over you? Christ came in deed to be judged, and not to judge, he came
to work the work of our redemption, not to decide controversies touching
lands and possessions. But will you therefore take from Christian men
authority to judge? for this example of Christ can no more be applied to
Bishops than it may be to kings, because the doings of Christ is a pattern for
all Christians, and yet Christians may judge matters, and decide controversies
amongst their brethren. Look. 1. Cor. 6. The Anabaptists use this text for one

of their reasons to condemn magistratie among Christians: and therefore a very
learned and late writer, in his exposition of this place, writes thus: Hinc
colligitur quantopere insaniant, qui ex hoc loco magistratum inter Christianos
damnant: nam Christus non argumentatur a re ipsa, tanquam profana sit, sed a
vocatione sua, quod missus sit in alium finem, tametsi res erat per se satis
sancta and pia. Hereof may it be gathered, how greatly they dote which
condemn magistrates amongst Christians by this place, for Christ does not
reason of the thing it self, as though it were profane, but of his own
vocation, because he was sent to an other end, although the thing of it self
is holy and good.

T. C. Page 155. Sect. 4. and vlt.
And as for the other place of Luke touching our savior Christ's refusal to
divide the inheritance 12. Luke.
between the brethren, it is most aptly alleged to this purpose. For although
our savior Christ does not there take away from men authority to judge, yet
he shows thereby sufficiently, that it belongs not unto the ministers of
the word, to entermeddle in ye judgment of civil causes. For our savior
Christ framed that answer having respect to the bounds of his calling.

For as he being minister of the Gospel did all those things which were
perteyning to his ministry: so by refusing this office of judgment in civil
causes, he gave to understand, that it did not appertain unto the compass of
that office, which he exercised, which was ye ministry. And therefore it is
altogether out of season that M. Doctor here alleges, that ye Anabaptists
use this reason to prove that Christians may not have magistrates. For how
does this follow, that because this place of S. Luke proves not, that we ought
to have no Christian magistrates, that therefore it proves not, that the
minister should be no magistrate, as if there could be no civil magistrates,
unless ministers of the word were. And the place which he alleges out of
the learned man, does not only, not make any thing for him, but does quite
overthrow his cause. For he says that our savior Christ did not refuse this
as a thing in it self unlawful, but because it did not agree with his
vocation. Now the vocation of our savior Christ, was to be a minister of the
Gospel, therefore it does not agree with the vocation of a minister of the
gospel to judge or to intermedle in civil government. And if M. Doctor had
been so studious of M. Caluins works, as by his often 4. Lib. Inscit. 11. cap.
allegation of him, he would make the world believe, he might have read in him
this sentence cited for this purpose, to prove that the ministers have not to
do in civil things.

Io. Whitgifte.
Neither do you here reply to my Answer, for I told you that Christ came to
be judged, not to judge in matters of lands and possessions: I told you
likewise that this example of Christ perteyneth no more to Bishops than it
does to Kings, and therefore can no fitlyer be by you applied against Bishops,
than by the Anabaptists against Christian Magistrates. To all this in effect
you have said nothing. Your own collection is soon answered. First, no man
gives to Bishops authority to judge in matters of inheritance, for such
controversies are to be decided by law, which has other Judges appointed for
it. Secondly, Christ spoke this to declare that his kingdom was not of this
world, but of the world to come, not earthly, but heavenly, not temporal,
but eternal: and therefore he spoke it touching his own person only, and not
as a rule perteyning to other Christians. as the Anabaptists feyne. Thirdly,
the authority in civil matters that is committed to ministers in Civil
offices in our ministers tend to ye government of the church.
this Church, is committed unto them by the Prince, for the better government
of the Church, and the fuller satisfying of their duty, consisting for the
most part only in punishing and correcting sin. And lastly, it is not made
a thing incident to the ministry, or as part of that office, but it is added
as profitable, convenient, and necessary for the present state of the Church,
and fuller accomplishing of the ministers duty.

I have told you in my Answer to the Admonition, that this example of Christ
does no more perteyne unto Bishops, than to other Christians (which being
true and vnconfuted by you) then does it follow that the Anabaptists may
as well allege it against other Christians, as you may do against Bishops or
Ministers.

The learned man's interpretation does well agree with my cause: for Christ
refused it, because he came to be judged, and to suffer death, for the
redemption of the world, which is the vocation that this learned man speaks
of, and is only proper to Christ. I deny not but that M. Calvin may apply
this text to that purpose, but M. Calvin does expound him self, writing
upon this same place, when he says, that every man must respect his own
vocation, and quid illi sit aptum, and what is meet for it. Now the civil
authority that Ecclesiastical persons have in this Church, is meet for
theer vocation: And therefore M. Calvin speaks nothing against it. In the
same book and chapter, he alleges these words of Bernarde* which he writes
to Pope Eugenius of this matter: Ergo in criminibus non in possessionibus
potestas vestra. etc. Wherefore your power is in offenses, not in possessions.
And this conclusion he brings in upon the words of S. Luke chapter. 12.

I would not, as I said before, have Bishops Judges in controversies of
enheritance, Wherein the Bishops authority consists.
I do not affirm that they may in the right of their ministry, challenge any
civil authority, as the Bishop of Rome does. But forasmuch as the
authority is in Criminibus, in offenses, as Bernarde says, therefore if it
please the Prince to give it them, they may lawfully execute so much
authority civil, as shall further and help them in suppressing sin. And
this is against nothing that M. Calvin has said. For M. Calvin and other
learned writers of this age, do use this place of S. Luke and such like,
against the usurpation of Romish Bishops, chalenging such authority in
civil matters as due unto them, Iure diuino, and so placing them selves in
Princes offices, did esteem all their duty toward the Church to consist
therein, and did nothing else perteyning to the office of a Bishop. As for the
authority that our Bishops have in such matters, I think that neither M.
Calvin, nor any other godly man can disallowe of it.

Chap. 1. the. 4. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 215. Sect. 2.
In the third place you allege Romans 12. verse. 7. He that has an office,
let him wait on his office, or he that teaches, on teaching. What is this to
the purpose? He that has an office, must attend upon his office, and he that

not have civil offices. The office of a Bishop is as well to govern by
discipline, as by preaching: this is a very simple argument.

T. C. Page. 166. Lin. 9.
Furthermore M. Doctor asks what S. Paul's place to the Romans (where he
wylleth 12. Romans
that he which has an office, must wait of that office, he that teaches of
his teaching) makes to this purpose. Surely M. Doctor very much. Neither can
there be a place more properly I^ is certain that diverse of these gifts

that he may be apt for diverse functions: neither does the Apostle there tie
one man to one gift or function only.
alleged, both for the very playnenesse of the words, and also for the
circumstance of the place. For Saint Paul speaks there against those,
which would ouerreache their callinges, and having certain callinges,
contented not them selves with them, but would have an oar in every man's
boat, and would take more upon them than they were able to do, or the measure
of their gifts would stretche unto. And therefore shows that as the body is
best preserved when every member thereof does his office, and destroyed when
one member will take upon it to do the office of an other: so the Church is
then best governed, when every ecclesiastical person keeps him self within
the limits of his calling, not meddling with that which perteyneth unto an
other. But M. Doctor says, that the bishop governs as well by discipline, as
by preaching: so he does. But I pray you by what discipline? what a reason is
this, he governs by discipline, Ergo by civil discipline. You say in the
next sentence, that the authors of the Admonition either dote or dream. But if
these be your sharp disputations when you are awake, surely they are very
blunt when you dream. But I had rather judge the best, that M. Doctor was
ouerwatched.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely M. T. C. it makes nothing at all to that purpose, neither does S. Paul
speak it to that end: but he speaks it to move every one diligently and
truly to walk in his vocation and calling, and therefore in the same place he
says, qui praeest in diligentia: and as I have told you, this civil
authority that I speak of, is not claymed, but committed: is no hinderance,
but an help to the ecclesiastical function. Civil authority not claymed,
but commi^ted to our Bishops.
Neither is this to usurp any other man's vocation, but duetifully to use that
office that is given unto us by the Prince, to help us forward in our own
vocation, and calling.

An ecclesiastical Pastor must use that discipline that is appointed unto him
by the Magistrate and orders of that Church whereof he is minister, be it civil
or ecclesiastical, so that if the kind of discipline used in that Church be
civil, as it is in this Church for diverse crimes, then does he govern by
civil discipline, and the argument is good, neither will you be able to
answer it when you are best awake, howsoever I made it in my dream, or being
over watched.

This it that place that T. C. confesses to be alleged to no purpose: and
therefore here they are left to answer for themselves, as they be in the most
of their quotations.

suffer affliction as a good soldier of Jesus Christ: no man that vvarreth
entangleth him self with the affairs of this life, because he would please
him that has chosen him to be a soldier. This latter sentence is general,
and perteyneth to all men. The meaning is this, whosoever would be a soldier
under Christ, must leave all worldly things, and follow him. It speaks
nothing either of civil or ecclesiastical offices. For if you will know what
he there means by the affairs of this life, hear what M. Calvin says,
writing Calvin
upon that place: per negotia vitae intelligit familiae administr (...) cur^
and (...) occupationes: By the affairs of this life he understands the care
of governing his family, and other ordinary business.

If you will learn how this place is to be applied, the same M. (...)
Calvin teaches you like wise in these words following: Nunc applicanda est
comparatio ad rem praesentem, quod quisquis vult sub Christo mil the, (...)
relictis omnibus mundi tricis and auocamentis se illi totum suaque studia
addi^ere: Now this comparation is to be applied to the present purpose, that
whosoever will play the warrior under Christ, leaving all vvorldely
matters and impediments, must give him self wholy unto him. This therefore
is genetall, and perteyneth to all Christians, but chiefly and especially to
the ministers of the word, who may not occupy them selves in worldly
business, as other men do: that is, they must not be marchaunts, husbandmen,
crafts men, or hinder their vocation with Some civil offices rather helps
than hindrances to the (...) a Bishop.
such like worldly affairs. As for such civil offices as be committed to
them, they be rather helps to their vocation, than impediments: for the office
of a Justice of peace, of an high Commissioner, and such like, is to punish
vice and iniquity, to see good order kept in the common wealth, as well in
matters touching religion, as other common and public business. Wherefore as
these offices be not mere civil, but partly ecclesiastical, and be for
discipline and correction of sins: so in my opinion they be most meet to be
committed to some of the wysest and best of the Clergy, to the end that
such as by the word will not, by convenient dyscipline may be compelled to do
their duties. Neither are such offices to be accounted worldly affairs, but
rather heavenly and spiritual, forasmuch as they serve to the mayntenance of
religion and godliness, and to the suppressing of sin and wickedness. If it
be true that Augustine says: Seruiunt Reges Christo, leges ferendo pro
Christo. It is also true, Seruiunt Episcopi Christo, leges exequendo pro
Christo.

T. C. Page 166. in the midst.
The last place which is alleged by the Admonition, is out of the Epistle to
Tim. where it shows, that for so much as the state of a minister, is as that
of a soldier, and therefore as the 2. Epist. 2.
soldier, to the end he might the better please his captain, and do his
service of warfare, quitteth all those things which he loves, and whereof
otherwyfe he might have care, and might enio^ even so the minister ought to
dispatche him self, of all those things, which may be any let to the office
of his ministry, although he might otherwise lawfully use them. And if so be
for the performing of the ministry to the full, he must quite those things
which he may lawfully use, how much more might the Admonition conclude, that
he ought not to entangle him self with those things, which (out of the places
of S. Luke, and to the Romans) it had showed to be unlawful for him to
meddle with? And although M. Doctor say the sentence be general, yet it is
particularly meant, and most properly of the ministers, which M. Calvin
teaches M. Doctor in the same place, where he has cited his authority twice
to no purpose. For what although M. Calvin do not there apply in prescript
words this sentence to prove that ministers ought not to meddle with civil
offices, does it follow therefore that this place can not be used thereto? In
saying that he ought to abstain from all lets which may hinder his vocation
and ministry, he does consequently say, that he ought to abstain from all
civil offices, and if so be M. Doctor had been so well read in the ancient
Doctors (as he would seem) he might have known that this place is used of
Cyprian to the same purpose that it is alleged here. For Cyprian speaking
against an Elder which 9. Epist. 1. lib. ^.
had taken upon him to be executor to one which was dead, alleges this place.

Io. Whitgifte.
That which is spoken of a soldier perteyneth to all Christians as well as
to a minister: for every Christian man is a soldier: these civil functions
be helps to the ministry, and may be lawfully used as I have said before.
M. Calvin truly interprets the place, and his interpretation makes fully
for my purpose, and directly against you, as the Reader may easily perceive, so
that your many words are soon with this brevity answered.

Cyprian alleges the place to good purpose: for to be an executor is a
troublesome matter, and does oftentimes hinder men from their other callings,
so that sometimes even temporal men (as we call them) do avoid the same for
the trouble that thereupon commonly ensues: And yet I doubt whether you would
refuse to be an executor, or no, if it were offered unto you by some: neither
do I think it unlawful, so that the troublesomnesse of it be not too much,
and an hinderance in deed to weightier matters.

Chap. 1. the. 7. Division.
T. C. Page 166. toward the end.
To these reasons of the Admonition, may be added that which the Admonition
has in the. 230. page, that the regiment of the Church is spiritual, and
respects the conscience, and therefore has not to do with civil offices,
which respect properly the common wealth, and the outward, godly, honest, and
quiec behavior. And therefore their meaning is, that as the civil governor
does use such kind of punishmente as may bridle the outward man, and hold
him that he dare not offend in the open breach of that godliness, honesty,
and quietness which S. Paul commends 1. Tim. ^.
unto us: so the ecclesiastical regiment does use that kind of discipline,
whereby the conscience and inward man may be kept in that wylling obedience
unto Gods commandment, touching a godly, honest, and quiet life.

Io. Whitgifte.
The government of the Church in the respect of Christ, which by his holy
spirit rules in the heart and conscience of man, is only spiritual: but it
is not so in the respect of the visible Church, and earthly members, and
ministers of the same: for then must you of necessity shut out the civil
Magistrate from all kind of government in the Church, which is the matter you
shoot at, cloak it as much as you can. But of the regiment of the Church,
and of the untruth of this your assertion I have spoken before: and speak of
it also in that which follows.

Chap. 1. the. 8. Division.
Answer to the Admonition. Page 230. Sect. 1. 3.
You bid us in the margent (to prove that the regiment of the Church should be
spiritual) read Ephe. 1. verse. 23. 1. These. 5. verse. 13. 1. Tim 5. verse. 2.
Heb. 10. verse. 30.

In the. 1. These. 5. the Apostle beseeches them to love such for their
works sake, as labor among them, are over them in the Lord, and admonish
them. What argument call you this? S. Paul mou^s the These. to love their
Pastors: Ergo, the government of the Church is only spiritual.

T. C. Page. 166. in the end.
And to note the distinction of these regiments civil and spiritual, the
place unto the Thessal. 1. These. 5.
is well alleged: for by the words (such as rule over you in the Lord) the
Apostle does put a difference between the civil and ecclesiastical regiment.
For albeit that godly civil Magistrates do rule over us in the Lord, yet S.
Paul (...) that is, by excellency, ascribes that unto the ecclesiastical
governors, because that whereas the civil Magistrate, beside his care for the
salvation of the souls of his people, is occupied, in procuring also the
wealth and quietness of this life: the ecclesiastical governors have all
their whole care set upon that only, which perteyneth to the life to come.

Io. Whitgifte.
True it is that the civil government is distinguished from the
ecclesiastical: but there is some thing common to them both, as these civil
offices whereof we speak.

The place to the These. which the Authors of the Admonition use, page 227. to
prove that the government of the Church ought to be spiritual, can not be
used to make any distinction betwixt civil and ecclesiastical government. For
by your own confession this portion (are over you in the Lord) which you would
have to make this distinction, is as well spoken of the civil Magistrate, as it
is of the Pastor, and so it is in deed, and therefore this text is abused both
by them and you. The Apostle uses the same manner of speech; speaking of the
obedience of wives toward their husbands, Vxores subditae estote proprijs
viris, sicuti decet in Domino: VViues be subject unto your own Col. 3.
husbands, as it behooves you in the Lord. And yet you will not say that the
government of the husband over his wife is only spiritual. And therefore
howsoever you ^ally out the matter, with saying that S. Paul here (...)
ascribes this unto the ecclesiastical governors, yet it will not serve your
turn, for he ascribes it also to those that be civil. The ecclesiastical
governors have all their whole care set upon that only which perteyneth to
the life to come: True it is, and to the same end ten^eth the civil
government which they do exercise, as I have told you before.

In the. 1. Tim. 5. verse. 2. he wills Timothy to exhort the elder women

be exhorted as mothers, the younger as systers, with all pureness: Ergo, the
government of ye church must be spiritual.

T. C. Page 167. Lin. 5.
And to this end also is alleged by the Admonition the place of Tim. wherein
the Apostle teaches 1. Tim. 5.
part of the ecclesiastical discipline, which the minister may use, to consist
in reprehensions and rebukes, which must be tempered according as the estate
and age of every one does require. Their meaning is not (as M. Doctor does
untruly surmise) to shut out the civil Magistrate, or to debar him of
punishing the wicked, but that it apperteyneth not unto the ministers to deal
that ways, whose correction of faults lies partly in reprehensions and
admonitions, which he speaks of there, partly in excommunication, whereof is
spoken before.

Io. Whitgifte.
But how ap^ly this place is alleged to this end, every child may understand.
For what a collection call you this. S. Paul wills Tim, to exhort the elder
women as mothers, the younger as sisters, therefore the regiment of the Church is
only spiritual, and an ecclesiastical person may not intermeddle with any kind
of civil affairs? one Christian man must exhort an other, and reprove an other
also, as occasion requires, therefore he may not execute any civil office: the
reason is al one. Your defense of this place is very slender, and you might
with as much credit to them have passed it over, as you have done diverse
other.

other gouernoures that God has placed in his Church? It is subtly done of
you to quote the places only, and not to apply them, nor to conclude of them:
for surely if you had laid down the words, and applied them to your purpose,
not wise and learned only, but very children would have laughed you to scorn.

T. C. Page 167. Lin. 12.
Further touching the place of the Ephesians. for so much as our savior Christ as
he is head of his Church, is the spiritual governor thereof, it is meet that
their government which are appointed underneath him, as he is head, should be
likewise spiritual, as his is. For as for the cyuil 1. Cor. 11.
Magistrate, although he be appointed of Christ (as he is God) in which
respect there is none above Christ, yet he is not appointed of him, in respect
that he is head of the Church, in regard whereof God is above Christ, and as
the Apostle says, the head of him.

Io. Whitgifte.
Christ is the head of the Church, and spiritually governs the same in the
conscience, The government of the Church is not only spiritual
but because it has also an outward and visible form, therefore it requires
an outward and visible government, which Christ does execute as well by the
civil Magistrate, as he does by the ecclesiastical minister, and therefore
the government of the Church, in the respect of the external and visible
form of it, is not only spiritual. Christ governs by him self spiritually
only, and by his ministers both spiritually and externally, and therefore
your reason is nothing. But why do you not answer in this place, to that
which I charge them with, touching the civil T. C. content to pass ^y the
ab^dging of civil autho^.
Magistrate? In the former place where I spoke no such thing, you said that I
untruly surmised, that they shut out the civil Magistrate from punishing the
wicked: But here when I charge them, that by their application of this place,
they take away civil Magistrates and other governors, that God has placed in
his Church, you answer not one word. In deed both you and they by your
false interpretations of this and such like places, do altogether seclude the
civil Magistrate, from any government of the Church, and in effect say with
the Papists, that he does govern as he is man, and not as he is a Christian,
and that he governs men in that they be men, and not in that they be
Christian men: which may well be spoken of the Turk, having Christians subject
under him: but it is wickedness to think it of a Christian Magistrate, and it
does not much differ from the opinion of the Anabaptists.

In the. 10. Hebr. verse. 30. it is thus written: For we know him that has
said, vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompense says the Lord. And
again: The Lord shall judge his people.

Uengeance belongs to God, and he shall judge his people: Ergo, the
government of the Church must be spiritual. Fond arguments, and to no purpose.


I am ashamed of these reasons, and so will you be likewise, if you be not past
shame. If you mean that the government of the Church is spiritual, because
God by his spirit, gifts, and ministry of his word does govern it, you
say truly, although these places be unaptly alleged: but if you mean, that
therefore there need no civil Magistrates, no civil and politic laws, no
external discipline, no outward ceremonies and orders, you are greatly
deceived, and join with the Anabaptists, whose error in that point is
sufficiently by diverse learned men confuted. And therefore I will not as yet
intermeddle therewith, until I understand further of your meaning.

This is left unanswered.

The reasons which T. C. uses against civil offices in ecclesiastical
persons, examined.
Chap. 2. the first Division.
T. C. Page 167. Sect. 1.
Now that I have showed that the places quoted by the Admonition, are for the
most part to the purpose of that they be quoted for, I will add a reason or
two to this purpose, before I come to answer to those reasons which are
brought by M. Doctor. Here I must desire the Reader to remember (which I said
before, when I spoke against non residencie) the multitude and difficulty of
those things which are required of the minister of the word of God. And withal
I will leave to the consideration of every one, the great infirmity and
weakness which is in men, both the which considerations set together, it will
easily appear how unmeet a thing it is, that the minister should have any
other charge laid upon him, seeing that it being so weighty an office, as
will require all the gifts he has, be they never so great, it must needs
fall out, that so much as he does man other calling, so much he leaves
undone in this.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Reader may easily judge how fitly they were alleged, in that they needed
your commentary to teach the application of them, which otherwise would have
asked some cunning to make them to serve the turn. But as the places be
unfitly quoted by them, so are they in deed as slenderly defended by you: as
may appear in your Replies, and my Answers.

Your first argument why ecclesiastical persons may not exercise civil offices
is this: The multitude and difficulty of those things which are required of
the minister, are such, and the weakness and infirmity of man so great, that
the minister can not execute any other offices. etc. This had some likelyhoode
in it, if the minister should execute any office contrary or repugnant to his
ecclesiastical function. But seeing I have before declared that such civil
offices as be now committed to Bishops, and other of the Clergy, be
necessary helps to their other callings, and most profitable for the good
and quiet government of the Church, this argument of it self falls to the
ground. But why may you not as well reason thus? the multitude and greatness
of those things that are required of a Christian, be such, and the infirmity
and frayltie of man so great, that if he did nothing but give him self to
spiritual meditation, and never meddle with worldly affairs, he were not able
to do his full duty: therefore no Christian man may practice any such
thing, or meddle in worldly and civil matters. This argument is the root of
Anabaptisme.

Chap. 2. the. 2. Division.
T. C. Page 167. in the midst.
And what the hand of man is able to reach herein, it is to be considered in
the Apostles, whom if the office of the ministry did so wholly occupy and
set a work, that they could admit no other charge with it, yea and were
feign to cast of that which they had, it is clear that none of those which
live now can beside that function, admit any other public calling. The story
is known in the Acts, that the Apostles even during the tune that they kept
together at Jerusalem, Act. 6.
and taught the Church there, were feign, that they might the better attend
unto preaching and praying (by which two things S. Luke summarily sets
forth the office of the ministry) to give over the charge of providing for
the poor unto others, because they were not able to do both. Now for so much
as the Apostles endued with such gifts as none have been since, or shall be
hereafter, could not discharge together with the office of the minister that
also of the Deacon, how should any man be found, that together with that
office, can discharge the office of a civil Magistrate? And if the Apostles
would not have the office of a Deacon, which was ecclesiastical, and
therefore of the same kind with the ministry joined unto it, how much
less will they suffer that the ministry should be joined with a civil
office, and therefore of an other kind? For reason teaches that there is an
easier mingling of those which are of one kind, than of those which are of
diverse kinds.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is evident that the Apostles, from the ascension of Christ into heaven
until Why the Apo stles left of the Deaconship. Calvin.
this time, did execute both the office of the Apostles, and the office of
Deacons also. Whereby it is manifest that these offices may at sometimes meet
together in one, and the self same person. And M. Calvin upon the. 6. of the
Acts says: That they did not altogether cast off this care for the poor,
sed leuationem quaesijsse vt suo muneri intenti esse possent, but that they
sought an easing thereof, that they might be intentive unto their office. The
causes therefore that moved the Apostles to leave off from executing the one,
that is, the Deaconship, is to be considered. One cause was, the great increase
of the number of Christians, which was now grown to such a multitude, that
the Apostles could not well both make provision for the poor, and give them
selves also both to preaching and praying.

An other cause was the murmuring and grudging of the Gretians, who thought
that the Apostles had more regard to provide for their own country men the
Jews, than for the Erecians being strangers unto them. Wherefore the
Apostles being willing to eschew this grudging and repyning, did for avoiding
the suspicion of partiality, will the whole multitude to choose them Deacons:
and both those causes be expressed in the beginning of the. 6. ^hapter of the
Acts.

The third cause was, for that the Apostles knew, that they should shortly
be dispersed, and that their office was to go from place to place, to plant
Churches, and preach the Gospel, so that they could not now execute the
office of Deacons, as they did whilst they remained together.

This being so (as it can not be denied) there can be no likely argument
gathered of this place, that ecclesiastical persons may not have some kind of
civil functions. And if a man well consider how busy and troublesome an
office the Deaconship was at that time (the Church being in persecution, and
the number of poor great) he shall easily perceive, that there is no
comparison betwixt the troublesomnesse of that office then, and the civil
offices now committed to ecclesiastical persons, which be so far from
hindering their ecclesiastical functions, that they work the clean contrary
effect. And yet it is certain, that the Apostle S. Paul, and Titus, with
Luke, or as some think, Barnabas, did together with the office of preaching,
make collections for the poor. 2. Corinthians. 8.

Again, how can we justly reprove the Papists for the use of both the
swords, spiritual an^ material, when as we are found in the same fault our
selves? And surely howsoever long custom has caused it to seem, yet in deed
it is a very great and intolerable confusion, which may be the easelyer
understood, if so be we set before our eyes, how uncomely and disordered it
is, in the like, or rather in the very same case. For let us imaginethe Ma^or
or Bayliue of a town, or the King or Emperor of the land, to come into the
pulpit and make a sermon, afterward to minister the sacraments, and from the
Church to go with the scepter in his hand unto the place of judgment: who
would not be amassed to see this, and wonder at it, as at a s^au^ge and
monstrous light? assuredly the self same deformity it is, when as the minister
of the word is made a Justice of peace, of Quorum, a Commissioner, an Earl, or
any such like, to whom the judgment of matters perteyning to the court of the
civil Magistrate is committed, especially seeing there are God be ^raysed) of
the Nobility and Gentry of this realm, that are able to discharge these
offices much better, than those ecclesiastical persons to whom they are
committed.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Bishop of Rome does challenge unto him self the whole power and authority
The civil jurisdiction that the Pope ^ay meth, not like to that in use in this
church
of the civil Magistrate, and that (as he says) by the word of God. He
baasteth that temporal Princes have their authority from him: and that it is
in his power both to displace and place them. This we utterly and most justly
condemn: but that jurisdiction civil that we allow in ecclesiastical
persons, is not the whole power of the civil Magistrate, but only so much as
may help to the good government of the Church, and the suppression of vice.
Neither do we challenge it as due, but receive it from the civil Magistrate as
convenient, and execute it by his authority, not by our own. This you could
not but understand, if you had not bin disposed to qua^il.

You say, ^tis an intolerable confusion. etc. but this is a Popish surmise,
and the example used craftily to verify the same: for the Papists do imagine
(or at the (...) do maliciously spread abroad) that by giving to the Prince
chief authority in ecclesiastical matters, we also give unto her power to
minister the sacraments, and to preach the word: In like manner you would
insinuate unto the Reader, that by allowing civil functions in ecclesiastical
persons, we also allow them to execute all kind of civil functions: which is
spoken of you as well to deface the authority of the civil Magistrate in
matters ecclesiastical, as it is to improve civil offices in ecclesiastical
persons. It is neither confusion, nor vncomelynesse to come from the pulpit,
and administration of the Sacraments, to the punishment and correction of vice
and wickedness. Neither is it any monstrous or strange sight, for an
ecclesiastical person to execute that kind of discipline against offenders,
which by lawful authority is established in the Church, whether it be by
being Justice of peace and Quorum, or a Comm^issioner, or any other such like
office and function.

But remember I pray you what you said before in the treatise of Seni^rs: you
T. C. must (...). ^ther di^sent from Beza, or grant the controversy. Tract.
17. cap. diuis.
there set it down that they are ecclesiastical persons: and yet M. Beza (as
I have there declared) says that noble men and Princes may be of the (...),
wherefore either may civil and ecclesiastical offices meet together in
eccles^icall persons (which you deny) or else can not noble men and Princes
be of your Seigniorie, as M. Beza affirms: or if they be of your (...), they
must cast off their Baronries, Earldomes, and civil dominions (which I am
sure they will not) or else to conclude, your assertion is strange, and your
S^lorie con^used.

I doubt not but that many of the Nobility and Gen^rie of this Realm are more
fit for these things, than ecclesiastical men are: neither can I be
persuaded, but that they consider how expedient it is notwithstanding, that
such functions be committed to some of the clergy: and I am well assured that
they can not but easily epsy the deformity and confusion that your platform
would bring to this Monarchy.

And if so be that there fall out any question at any time which is to be
decyded by the word of God, and wherein the advise of the minister is
needful, there the ministers help may and Esra. 9.
ought to be required. For thereof we have not only an example in This place
makes against your self.
Esra, where the Princes Deuteronomy. 19.
in a matter of difficulty, came and asked the counsel of Esra, but we have a
plain commandment in Moses by the Lord, who commanded that the cause of
perjury should be heard before the Lord in the Sanctuary, at the hearing
whereof the high Priest should be present, by which commandment the Lord
does not by bringing this cause into the Sanctuar e declare, that the
judgment thereof did apperteyne unto the ecclesiastical court, but because
it being a matter which touched the glory of God very expressly, he would
have the Princes which were Judges there, to be the nearer touched, and the
deepelyer affected with the glory of God, whereof they sau e the sacrament
before their eyes, neither is the high Priest commanded to be present to this
end* that he should sit as judge of that matter, but that he might dissolve
the difficulties, if any rose of the understanding of the law, and that he
might prick forward, and stir up by admonition* the princes to whom the
judgment apperteyned, if so be he should see them cold and slack to revenge
the iniuried done unto the Lord. Which thing may the better appear, in that
the handling of the matter, is there appointed, not unto the priests, but unto
the Judges or princes only, and so likewise of matrimony and divorce,
although the judgment thereof apperteyne unto the civil Magistrate, yet the
minister, if there be any difficulty in knowing when it is a lawful contract,
and when the divorce is lawful, may and ought to be consulted with. Thus may
the common wealth and Church enjoy both the wisdom and searning which is in
the minister, and things may be done in that order which God has appointed,
without such confounding and iumbling of offices and jurisdictions together.

Io. Whitgifte.
You would not have a minister to enjoy any civil office, and yet would you
not A greater inrisdiction sought in disprouing the less.
have the civil Magistrate to determine any thing in matters of weight,
without the advice and counsel of the minister, that is, the Minister must
prescribe unto the civil Magistrate what he should do in all weyghtie and
doubtful cau. es. This is your drifte in this place, so far as I can gather:
else I know not to what purpose you should spend so many words, for they
conclude nothing against the cause, but with it rather. In deed I have heard
say, that in some Churches which some of you have gone about to reform, the
minister was all in all, and in all affairs his advise and consent was had,
else nothing could be done. Which authority surely passes all the civil
turisdiction, that I know any man has or desires in this Church. But you may
intermeddle in the offices of Majors, Bayliues, Justices of peace, and in deed
have an oar in every man's boat, and yet nothing hinder your Pastoral office:
such is the excellency of your wit and gifts above other men, that the same
thing may be lawful in you, a little portion whereof may not be permitted to
others.

You make a fair gloss upon the. 19. of Deuteronomie: but how aptly, the
Reader may consider if he mark the place well: the words of the text be these:
If a false Deuteronomy. 19.
witness rise up against a man to accuse him of trespass, then both the men
that strive together shall stand before the Lord, even before the Priests and
the Judges which shall be in those days, and the Judges shall make diligent
inquisition. etc. First here is no word of ye Sanctuary, for this that is
said (before the Lord) M. Calvin in his harmony does interpret on this sort:
Coram leboua. i. cora^ sacerdotibus and iudicibus qui fuerunt in diebus illis:
Before Iehoua, that is, before the Priests and Judges which were in those
days. And in deed God is said to be there present, where his true ministers
are assembled: wherefore your descanting of the Sanctuary* is without any
ground. Moreover it does not appear, by any thing in this place, but that the
Priest had as much to do in the matter, as the judge had: wherefore this
place can not serve your turae in any respect.

The place in the. 9. of Esoras makes altogether against you: for the rulers
came The Replyer overthrows his own cause.
to complain unto Esoras, that the people had married with the Gentiles, and
Esdras took upon him as one having authority, to reform it, and to separate
them from their wives, as it evidently appears in the tenth chapter, and. 4.
and. 5. verse. For certain of them came unto Esoras, and spoke unto him in
this manner: Arise, for the matter belongs unto thee. etc. It appears that
you have very small care what you allege, so it may seem to be something.

You add in the end, and say: and so likewise of matrimony and divorce. etc.
But the Reader must take heed that he imagine not this assertion of yours, to
be contained in any of these two places quoted by you. It is but your own bare
affirmation, you allege no authority for it.

For although Aristotle's (...) and Platoes (...) that is, instruments serving
to two purposes, be lawful in offices of the common wealth, where things are
more free, and left in greater liberty to be ordered at the judgment and
advise of men, especially considering that upon the diversity of the forms of

where things are brought to a strayghter rule, and which is but one and
uniform* the same may not be suffered. And yet even those common wealth
Philosophers, which do license upon occasion, that two offices may meet in
one man, hold that it is best, and conuenientest, that every one should have a
particular charge. For Aristotle says, it is most agreeable to nature, that

not content them selves with one, and they make the meeting of many functions

Io. Whitgifte.
These be but words only containing no sound proofs, and require but a short
answer, which is, that these civil and ecclesiastical offices, which we
join together in one person, tend to one and the same end, and serve for the
same purpose, that is, the quiet and good government of the Church, and the
suppression of Tract. 17. cap. vit.
vice and sin. I have proved before, that the external form and kind of
government in the Church is not one and uniform (as you here affirm) but
variable, according to place, person, and time.

Diverse offices may be committed to one man in a common wealth, though there be
more fit for the same, except you will make the state popular, and restrain
the Prince from the liberty of bestowing such offices upon such as she
thinks most meet for them, which, if it be well marked, is part of your
drifte. Belike you or some of your friends, lack offices, and therefore you
would gladly have a new distribution.

And although both be unlawful, yet as the case stands in our realm, it
is more tolerable that the civil Magistrate should do the office of a
minister, than that the minister should intermeddle with the function of the
Magistrate. For when the accounts shall be cast, it will fall out, that there
are more sufficient and able men to serve in the common wealth of this realm,
than in the Church, and greater want in the one, than in the other.

Io. Whitgifte.
This reason of yours if it were true does but accuse the Prince and her
Council of lack of due consideration of the state of this Realm: for this is
a reason of Policy, and not of Divinity. Undoubtedly you are set up in the
chair of controlement, and your gifts are so great, that you dare presume to
prescribe both new Divinity, and new Policy. I do nothing doubt but that
the state of this common wealth is better known and considered, than that
there shall need any of your aduertisementes for the government of it: and
therefore I pass over these words of yours, as void of reason, and full of
presumption, and such, whereby of stomach only you seek to discredit and
to disable the state of the Church, and ecclesiastical persons, against whom
you have conceived displeasure.

And if beside this, both authority of the word of God, and light of reason,
we will look unto the practice of the church many years after the time of the
Apostles, we shall find that the church has been very careful from tune to
time, that this order should be kept, that the ministers should not entangle
them selves with any thing beside their ministry, and those things which the
word of God does necessarily put upon them, least the strength of their mind,
and of their body, being distracted unto many things, they should be the
less able to accomplish their ministry unto the full. Which may also partly
appear by that which I have alleged out of Cyprian, which will not permit
them so much as to be executors of a Testament. And in the. 80. Canon of those
which are ascribed unto the Apostles, it is enjoined that they should not
entangle themselves with worldly offices, but attend upon their
ecclesiastical affairs.

Io. Whitgifte.
If you compare the state of the Church before the time of Christian Kings,
with the state of it under Christian Kings, you make an unequal comparison.
For how could ecclesiastical persons enjoy any civil function, when there
was no civil Magistrate christian to commit the same unto them? How could by
this means the government of the Church be thought to be helped by the Civil
Magistrate, when as it had no greater enemies than civil Magistrates, who
sought by all means to suppress and destroy it? but now to your reasons.

To ^yprians authority I have answered before.

The Canons of the Apostles have now been alleged by you at the least. 4.
or. 5. times, and yet is not their credit and authority so firm. But that
Canon means only such worldely causes as be impedimentes to their vocation:
and I have told you often that civil functions be necessary helps, to the
doing and full accomplishing of their ecclesiastical office. I have expressed
in my Answer to the Admonition, what worldly affairs a minister of the word
may not entangle him self with.

Further in the (*) council of Calcedon it was decreed, that, none of the

unless they were such as the laws did necessarily cast upon him, which it
calls inexcusable charges, meaning by all likelihoode the wardship of his

decree to have bin, for that there were certain ministers which were Stewards
to noble men. And (...) the. 7. canon of the same council it is decreed, that
none of the clergy should either go to warfare as soldiers or captains,
or should receive any secular honors, and if they did, they should be

The words of the third Canon be these: Relation is made unto this holy
Synod, Con. Calced. can. 3.
that certain amongst the clergy for filthy lucers sake hyer other men's
possessions, and take upon them the causes of secular business, and through
slothfulness separate themselves from divine functions, and run to the
houses of secular persons, and for covetousness take upon the^ the government
of their substance: therefore this holy universal and great Synod has
decreed, that none of these hereafter, that is, Bishop, or Clearke, or Monk,
shall hyer possessions, or intermeddle with secular possessions, except those
that by law are driven to take the tuition and care of such as be under age:
or those to whom the Bishop of the City has committed the government of
ecclesiastical things, and of Orphans and widows, which are without succor,
or of such persons which need the help of the Church for the fear of God.
etc.

This Canon conteyneth nothing contrary to my assertion, the words of the
Canon be plain: I shall not need to use any exposition of it. Only I would
have the Reader mark the weight of your argument, which is this. The Council
of Chalcedon says, that Clerks may not for filthy lucres sake hyre other
men's possessions, or take upon them for covetousness sake, the government of
other men's possessions, etc. therefore there may be no civil office
committed unto them. I will ask no better commentaries to the Canon of the
Apostles before alleged, or any other such like, than this very Canon of the
Council of Chalcedon.

To what purpose do you allege the. 7. Canon of that Council? did you ever
hear me say that I would have a minister to be a Soldier or a captain in

Now I come to M. Doctors arguments which he brings to establish this
disorder.

And first he says ministers of the word may not occupy themselves in
worldly business, as to be merchants, husbandmen, crafts men, and such like,
but they may exercise civil offices. Where first of all I perceive, M. Doctor is
of this mind, that the order of God is not to be broken for small gain, or
when a man must take great toil of the body to break it: but if it may be
broken with getting of honor, and doing of those things which may be done
without toil, and with great commendation, then it is lawful to break it. In
deed so the Poet (but in the person of an unjust and ambitious man) said,
(...). that is. If a man must do vniustiy, he must do it to bear rule.

Secondarily, I do see that M. Doctor will not be shackled and hindered from his
ministry, by a pair of iron fetters, but if he can get a pair of golden
fetters, he is contented to be hampered and entangled from doing the office of
ministry committed unto him. For unless these should be the causes which
should move him to take the one, and refuse the other, verily I see none.

Io. Whitgifte.
This is to deride, and not to answer. M Bucer writing upon the. 4. to the
Ephesians. Bucer.
rehearsing such worldly business as withdraw the minister from his function
and therefore be not meet for him to exercise, says thus: Such business, as
warfare, market affairs, merchandise, hucksters craft, the oversight of Innes,
Tauerns, and bathes: to exercise vnliberall crafts, as to dig metals and
stones, to burn lyme, to carry sand, to be schauengers, and such like. You
have not yet proved that Gods order is broken, if the civil offices which I
speak of be committed to Ecclesiastical persons. Your jesting tauntes I leave
to those that profess that cunning.

For whereas he says it is a help, and maynteyneth religion, in deed that is
the reason of the Lib. 4. cap. 11.
Papists which M. Calvin confuteth in his institution.

And although it be good and necessary to punish vice and iniquity, by
corporal punishments and by civil corrections, yet it does no more follow
that that should be done by the ministers, than it follows that for that
preaching and ministering the Sacraments, and excommunication are good and
necessary, therefore the same is fit to be executed by the civil magistrate.
I grant the ministers have also to punish vice, for as the civil magistrates
punish lighter faults with some penalty of money or loss of member: so the
church and the minister especially with the church, has to punish faults by
reprehensions and rebukes. And as the civil magistrate punishes greater
faults by death: so the minister with other which have interest, has with ye
sword of excommunication power to kill those which be rebellious, and to cut
them from the church, as the other does from the common wealth. And if it be a
help to the ministers office, that he should meddle with civil punishments,
why should it not be a help unto the Magistrates office that he should
excommunicate and do other things perteyning to the Ecclesiastical discipline?

Io. Whitgifte.
In what words does M. Calvin confute it, or by what reason? you cut of the
matter very short: in that book and chapt. of his Instit. which you have
quoted in the margent, there is no such reason either alleged or confuted.
Only in the. 9. Section, he speaks against the temporal dominion of the
Popish Bishops, which derive their excessive power not from the civil
Magistrate, but fco^ the Pope, cloking it with this pretense, that it is an
ornament and beutie to the kingdom of Christ: which is far from any thing
alleged by me, why it is convenient that our Bishops have civil authority
committed unto them.

I would gladly hear a reason either of the Scripture, or any other
authentical It is not so lawful for the Prince to preach, etc. as for a
minister to use corporal punishment.
writer, why it should be as lawful for a civil Magistrate to preach,
minister the Sacraments, and excommunicate, as for the Ecclesiastical minister
to use corporal punishment: it was lawful for Samuel to kill Agag, being the
office of Saul: but it was not lawful for Saul to offer up sacrifices, that
being the office of Samuel. The office and function of a mynister is not in
his own power to commit to whom he list: but the office of the civil
Magistrate may be committed to whom soever it shall 1. Sam. 15.
please him best to like of, and to think most fit for government. 1. Sam. 3.


True it is that excommunication is an Ecclesiastical censure which the
mynister Excommunication not the only punishment used in the Church. Gualter.
may exercise if the state of the Church will bear it (for reprehension is a
discipline lawful for every Christian to use) but it is not the only censure:
for the civil magistrate may appoint other, as shall be to the state of the
Church most convenient. You know what M. Gualter says. 1. Cor. 5. As the
Roman Bishops upon this place and such like, have grounded their
excommunication, which is the most effectual instrument of their tyranny,
whereby they have cruelly vexed not only private men, but also Kings and
Emperors, and have been the causes of civil wars and sedition: even so the
Anabaptists whilst they persuade themselves, that there can be no discipline
without excommunication, they trouble the churches every where, and make
themselves laughing stocks to all the world, etc. Let every church follow
that kind of discipline which is most meet for the country wherein they
live, and which may be most commodious in respect of time and place: and let
no man here rashly prescribe unto an other, or seek to bind all men to one
and the same form.

Of old time there has been other kind of punishments, than either
reprehensio^s or excommunication, as it may appear even in that Canon
attributed to the Apostles which you have before rehearsed: where the
punishment appointed, is deprivation, as it is also in the most of the other
Canons, and in diverse other councels.

You say that if it be a help to the ministers office, that he should meddle
with the civil punishments: why should it not be a help to the magistrates
office, that he should excommunicate, etc. The answer is soon made. The
Magistrate may do that by corporal punishment that the minister can not do by
Ecclesiastical discipline: neither is there any man so desperate, whom the
magistrate by his authority may not bridle, but such is ye time now that few
regard the greatest censures of the Church.

And whereas M. Doctor says they may not be husband men, crafts men. etc.
and yet may have civil offices, I think far otherwise, that although neither
be lawful, yet the one were more tolerable than the other. For seeing after
the ministry of the word there is no calling under the sun weightier, and
which requires greater exercise of the mind, than the office-of the
magistrate, it is against all reason to lay this heavy burden upon a man,
that is already laden, and has as much as he is able to bear. It were more
equal if they will needs add unto the weight of this burden, to lay some
lighter charge of exercising a handy craft, than to break his back with the
charge of a civil Magistrate.

Io. Whitgifte.
These wdrldly affairs of husbandry, occupations, etc. must needs withdraw
him from his book and so make him more unapt to do his duty: and they be not
at all incident to his office, nor meet for his calling: but the Civil
offices, that I speak of be both meet for his calling, perteyning to
discipline, and helps to his office and function, as I have said: wherefore
they be so far from breaking his back, that they make the rest of his
burden a great deal the easier.

And whereas in the policy of M. Doctor it seems a furtherance to the
Gospel to join these together which was also the policy of the Idolaters as
I have before declared) in the wisdom of God it has seemed far otherwise,
which I doubt not did therefore separate the ministry from this pomp, which
is commendable in the civil magistrate. least the efficacy and power of the
simplicity of the word of God and of the ministry should be obscured,
whilst men would attribute the conversion of souls unto the gospel (due unto
the word and to the spirit of God) to these glorious shows. And least
whilst the Minister have the word in one hand, and the swordem the other, men
should not be able to judge so well in their consciences* of the mighty
operation of the word of God in them. For they might doubt with themselves
whether these are and outward show of the minister, carried some stroke with
them in believing the word.

Io. Whitgifte.
One of your reasons contained in this place, in effect is this. If ministers
should enjoy civil functions, men would attribute the conversion of souls
unto these shows: but that ought they not to do: therefore. etc. I deny your
Mayor as a fond and vain imagination. An other reason you frame on this
sort: If the mynister have both civil and Ecclesiastical power* men should
not be able to judge in their consciences of the mighty operation of the word
of God in them: for they might doubt whether the fear of the outward show of
the minister carried The Repliers argument siniteth as well at the (...)
magistrate as at the Ecclesiastical.
some stroke with them, etc. This is as vain an imagination as is the other:
and they both may as aptly be applied against the authority of the civil
Magistrate, as against the civil jurisdiction of the minister: yea in deed
they serve to the overthrow of all kind of civil punishment. For if the
Magistrate make sharp laws for coming to the Church, hearing the word of
God, contemning religion, and such like, men that by such means are driven to
hear the word of God. etc. and so at the length converted, may doubt whether
the word has wrought this in them or the fear of outward punishment. Do
you not mark how he still smites at the Magistrate? Percey^te you not how
near he approaches to the opinion of the Anabaptists, who would have no kind
of discipline in the Church but only excommunication? God uses corporal
punishment as a means to salvation.


But to Answer you briefly, God uses corporal punishments as a means to
drive* even the elect to the hearing of the word of God, and to honesty of
life. He uses it also to bridle the wicked, that by their examples other men
might learn to beware, and that they themselves also may be kept in order.
And no man that is truly converted by the preaching of the word, can doubt
but that God by the working of his spirit, thorough the ministry of his
word, has wrought that good in him, though by external means (as fear of
punishment, and such like) he was first as it were enforced to hear the
word, and to keep himself in order. In deed if these reasons of yours were
of any force, the Magistrate might put up his sword, especially in
Ecclesiastical matters, and so might the minister lay aside his authority
also, least any thing be ascribed there unto Your glaunce (that this was also
the policy of the Idolaters) though you have no where proved it, yet have I
answered it before.

But M. Doctor says that civil offices are not to be counted worldly
affairs, but heavenly and spiritual* it is so: and yet when they are compared
with the Ecclesiastical offices. they may be called secular offices, for so
much as they to gether with the care of religion, procure and provide for the
things whereby we may quietly and commodiously live here, where the
Ecclesiastical offices are immediately and only bente to procure the glory of
God and the salvation of men, and in that signification of heavenly and
spiritual which you take, merchandise, husbandry, and the handycrafte be
heavenly, and spiritual, although not in the same degree. All lawful
callinges came from God, and return to him again, that is, he is both author
of them and they ought to be referred to his glory, so that if the mynister may
exercise all things which be heavenly and spiritual, you may as well bring him
down to the plough, as promote him to the court.

(...) M. Doctor says that the office of a commissioner is Ecclesiastical,
because it handles Ecclesiastical causes, I marvel that he is so ignorant,
that he can not put a difference between giving iudiciail sentences, and
appoynting bodily punishments, (which are mere civil) and between the
understanding the truth of every such cause according as the word of God
defines of it: which is a thing common as well unto the magistrate as unto the
mynister, and wherein the mynister because he ought to be most ready, ought (if
need be) consulted with.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely I think you scarce understand your self: for if the causes be
Ecclesiastical, why may not the punishment by the Magistrate appointed unto
them be executed by Ecclesiastical persons, having authority from the Prince
by commission so to do: and if the Ecclesiastical person may give sentence and
judgment in these Ecclesiastical causes, why may he not consent also to the
punishments appointed for the same? I do not mean he should be the Iaylor, or
tormentor himself, but to judge the person offending worthy of this or that
kind of punishment, and to give sentence of the crime that he has committed,
and to determine of the cause that is called into judgment.

An other of M. Doctors reasons is, that as kings do serve Christ by making
laws for him, so Bishops do serve Christ by executyng laws for him: as
though it perteyned not unto the Magistrates to execute laws as well as to
make them, and as if the magistrate were not therefore called a speaking law,
because by executing them he does cause the laws after a fashion to speak.
This is to divide the stake of the magistrate, between him and the Bishop, yea
to give the Bishop the best part of it. For we know that with us, the people
be at making of the laws, which may not meddle with the execution of them. And
if M. Doctor say, that he means not hereby, to shut the Prince from executing
the laws, then as his similitude (when it is at the best) proves nothing: so
by this means it halts down right, and is no similitude.

Io. Whitgifte.
The Prince executes his laws by himself, and he also executes them by
other to whom he has given that authority for the fuller and better
execution of them: in this number are the Bishops, for the authority they have
in such matters, they have from the Prince: and therefore their executing of
it is not to divide stake with the Cyuill Magistrate, but to do good service
both to God and the Magistrate.

What say you to Elye and Samuel, were they not both Priests Samuel priest
and judge.
and judges? what office did the Prophet Elias execute, when he killed the
false prophets of Baal. 1. Reg. 18. or Christ when he whipped the buyers and
sellers out of the temple? what office did Paul commit to Timothy, when he
said aduersus Presbyterum, etc?

I would not have a mynister to be a warrior, or a farmer, or a merchant, or
have any such like osfice, which consists in gain or bodily labor only. But
why he may not have such an office as is profitable to increase godliness,
and punish ungodliness, I hear as yet no reason. As for the office of an high
commissioner, it is Ecclesiastical, for they have to do only in causes
Ecclesiastical.

T. C. Page 170. Sect. 1.
And for Elye and Samuel, they are extraordinary examples, which may thereby
appear, for that both these offices first meeting in Melchisedech, and
afterward in Moses, were by the commandment of God severed, when as the
Lord took from Moses (being so wise and godly a man) the Priesthood and gave
it to Aaron, and to his successors. And so, for so much as when the Lord would
polishe his church and make it famous, and renoun^ed in the world he gave this
order: it appears that he would have this to be a perpetual rule unto his
church. And by so much it is the clearer, for that the Lord did not tarry
until Moses death, but took the priesthood away from Moses, which was a man
as able to execute both, as either Elye or Samuel.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is not certain whether Moses were ever Priest or no: for where it is said
It is doubtful whether Moses were priest.
in the. 99. Bsalme. Moses and Aaron in sacerdotibus eius, the Hebrewe word is
doubtful and signifies as well a Prince, as a Priest: and therefore upon this
place it cannot necessarily be concluded, that Moses was a Priest. Moreover at
that time the chief rulers and men of greatest authority were called
Priests: but you never read that Moses offered up any sacrifices for sin,
which was the proper office of the Priest: Neither can you tell us where he was
ever consecrated Priest. In deed Harding against the Apology does allege
this example at Moses, being as he says both a civil Magistrate and a
Priest, to prove that the Pope may be both King and Priest.

But be it as you say, that these two offices were distinguished in Moses and
Aaron, and that the Priests office which consists in offering oblations and
sacrifices was taken from him, yet did he keep still his former authority in
governing the church, and in prescribing to Aaron what he should do, even in
matters perteyning to the worship of God: so that these two offices (I mean
civil and Ecclesiastical) are not so distinct, but that they may both aptly
and well meet and join together. Further more Civil and ecclesiastical
offices met in one.
you know that howsoever the priesthood and civil Magistracy were divided in
Moses and Aaron, yet met they both together again not only in Elye and
Samuel, but in Es^ras, Nehemias, Mattathias and some other, which examples
prove that upon occasion these offices may meet together in one Person, and
they quite overthrow your allegation of Moses.

Chap. 3. the. 9. Division.
T. C. Page 170. Sect. 1.
And this may be also easily seen, for that in a manner always, where there
was any good and stayde estate of the church, these offices were ministered by
several persons, and then met and were mingled, when the estates were very
ruinous and miserable. And if this be a good reason to prove that ministers may
exercise civil offices, it is as good a reason to prove that princes may
preach, and minister the Sacraments. For if the ministers may exercise civil
offices, because Elye and Samuel (being ministers) did so: the Princes and
judges may preach the word and mynister the Sacraments because Elye and
Samuel (being Princes and judges) did so. And so we see how M. Doctor going
about to desend one confusion, brings in an other.

Io. Whitgifte.
Here you confess that which hitherto in your whole book you have denied, and
T. C. confesses the ground of all these controversies.
that which is in deed the whole ground of the chief matters in
controversy, that is, that the government of the Church may be diverse
according to the diversity of the time and state of the same: as in the time
of persecution it may be otherwise governed than in time of peace, otherwise
when the state is established, than when it is ruynous and in decay, for say
you: In a manner always where there was any good and stayed estate of the
church these offices were ministered by several persons, and then met and
were mingled, when the estates were very ruynous.

Thus have you granted of your own accord, that which hitherto you have so
stiffly and stoutly denied: such is the might and force of the truth. And yet
the church was in good state all Sainuels time, and the most part of Elyes
also, for any thing that I can read to the contrary.

I brought in those examples to prove that these offices have met together,
and The state of ye controueru^e altered by the Replier.
therefore be not so diverse as you would make them. I do not use them to this
end, that I would have a Priest to be a King, you know the state of our
question is only whether Bishops may exercise those civil functions of
Iusticeship of Peace, and such like, which the Prince commits unto them or
no, and not whether they may sit in the Princes throne, and take her Scepter
out of her hand whether she will or no, as the Pope does. And therefore whereas
you saythat by these examples of Elye and Samuel, I may as well conclude that
Princes may preach the word and minister the sacraments, as Priests and
ministers execute cruill offices: I think you do not consider that these
civil offices be but accidents to the priesthode, and therefore may well be
removed, as they were from Samuel, when Saul was chosen King: for Samuel
kept his Priesthood though he lost his civil authority: but the Priesthood
is not so to the cyuill magistrate, except he will be ordinarily and lawfully
admitted thereunto. I thuike that there is no degree of dignity that makes a
man unmeet for the ministry, if he be thereunto lawfully called, and have
other gifts meet for the same: wherefore as it follows not that a minister,
in the respect that he is a minister ought to have a civil office, but that he
may have one if he be by the civil Magistrate thereunto appointed, so it does
not follow that a civil Magistrate ought to be a minister of the word, but
that he may be if he be meet and thereunto ordinarily and lawfully called and
admitted. The Priest may not take upon him the office of the civil
Magistrate, unless he be called lawfully unto it: nor the civil Magistrate
may not take upon him the office of a Priest, unless he be ordinarily
thereunto admitted. And this is no confusion at all.

As for Elias killing the false Prophets, and our Savior Christ's whippyng out
of the temple, it is strange that M. Doctor will allege them, as things to
be followed, when he may as well teach, that we may call for fire from heaven,
as Elias did, and being demanded answer nothing, as our Savior did: as to
follow these actions which are most singular and extraordinary. And if
these one or two examples be enough to break the order that God has set, by
this a man may prove that the mynisters may be fishers, and tente makers,
because Peter and Paul (being ministers) did fish and make tents. And truly
these are not so extraordinary, and from the general rule as the other be. And
it was permitted in a Council, that rather than a minister should have two
benefices, he might labor with his hands to supply his want Tom. ^. (...)

Io. Whitgifte.
Yet by these examples, and especially by the examples of Christ, it may
appear, that Ecclesiastical persons have used corporal punishments, which
you call civil. I know examples make no rule, and therefore al your arguments
out of the scriptures, alleged before to prove that the election of ministers
ought to be popular, receive the same answer that you give to me in this
place: and yet examples if they be not against any commandment, or good order
established, declare what has been, and what upon the like occasions may be
done, but not what of necessity ought to be done. If you can prove any order
of God set down, that an Ecclesiastical person may by no means exercise
any civil offices, I yield unto you: if you can not do it, then do I allege
no examples tending to the breakyng of any order that God has set. I know not
why the ministers of the Gospel may not do as Peter and Paul did upon the
like occasion. And therefore your alleging of ye corrupt Council of Nice (which
not withstanding you have not (...) alleged) is not necess^ie. I have spoken
of that Canon before, and therefore will not trouble the Reader with it now,
being from this purpose.

When Saint Paul willed Tim. that he should not receive an accusation
against an elder, under two or three witnesses, he did commit nothing less,
than any civil office unto him. And M. Doctor himself has alleged it
before, as a thing incident to the office of a Bishop: and therefore he does
forget himself maruellously now, that makes this a civil office.

And does M. Doctor think that S. Paul made magistrates? Or is he of that
judgment, that the Church in the time of persecution, may make civil
officers? But it is true, that he that is once over the shoes, sticks not to
run over his boots.

Io. Whitgifte.
I alleged it before, to prove the superiority of Bishops over other
ministers: The iur^tion of Timothy in some respect civil.
Now I do allege it to prove that the same bishops may exercise that
jurisdiction which you call civil: for in that the judgment of such causes
were committed unto him, it argues his superiority: in that there is named
accusers, and witnesses, it declares a kind of eiuil jurisdiction, to the
which those words do perteine. So that Timothy being an ecclesiastical person
had prescribed unto him that kind of proceeding to judgment, that may be
called civil.

Answer to the Admonition Page. 218. Sect. 1.
It pleases you to say that it is against Gods word for Bishops to have
prisons, but your margent is very barren of proofs: for you have not quoted
one place of scripture to prove it: only you say that Popish Eugenius did
first bring them in, which is a very slender argument to prove them to be
against the word of God. Did not Peter punish Ananias and Saphira very
straightly for their dissimulation. Surely far more grievously than if he had
put them in prison, and yet their offense was not against any ordinary law
made in the Church or common weal. But where read you that Eugenius did
first invent them?

T. C. Page 170. Sect. vlt.
And last of all to prove that bishops may have prisons, he cites Peter which
punished Ananias and Saphira with death, M. Doctor must understand that this
was (...) power, and was done by virtue of that function which Sayncte Paul
calls (...), 1. Cor. 12.
which is one of those functions that the Lord places in his Church for a
time. But is this a good argument. Because Saint Peter punished with the
word, therefore the minister may punish with the sword? And because Saint
Peter did so once, therefore the Bishop may do so always? And because Saint
Peter did that which appertains to no civil magistrate* and which no
civil magistrate, by any means may or can do, therefore the minister may
do that which apperteyneth unto the Civil magistrate? For if there had bin
a civil magistrate, the same could not have punished this fault of
dissimulation which was not known, nor declared it self by any outewarde
action: So that if this example prove any thing, it proves that the minister
may do, that no man may do, but the Lord only, which is to punish faults
that are hid and unknown. If this be ignorance it is very gross, and if it
be against knowledge, it is more dangerous. I have determined with my self,
to leave unto M. Doctor his outcryes, and declamations, and if I should have
used them as often as he gives occasion, there would be no end of writing.
The Lord give M. Doctor either better knowledge, or better conscience.

Io. Whitgifte.
I use this example of Peter, to show that is not against Gods word for the
ministers Ministers may use temporal punishment.
of the Gospel to punish any by imprisonmente: For Peter being a minister of
the Gospel did punyshe with death, which is much more than to imprison: and
as Peter did this lawfully by an extraordinary power, so may the ministers of
the word punish by imprisonmente which is a far less kind of
punishment, being lawfully thereunto authorized by the civil Magistrate,
according to the orders of the common wealth and state of the Church. Therefore
my reason is this: Peter punished with temporal punishment, being a minister
of the word, and he did nothing repugnant to his vocation, therefore it is not
repugnant to the office of a minister of the word to punish with temporal
punishment. Again, Peter punished with death: therefore the minister may
punish with imprisonment: I speak de facto, of the deed done, not de modo,
of the manner of doing is. And I doubt not but that seeing it was lawful for
Peter to kill by an especial and extraordinary power: so it may be lawful
for the minister of the word to imprison, by an usual and ordinary power. And
so are all your Collections made in vain, and framed according to your own
pleasure, not so my meaning. If you have done it of ignorance, you are to be
excused: if of set purpose, you are to be blamed.

And whereas you say, that M. Doctor must understand, that this was
ecclesiastical powers Peter's punishing of Ananias was by civil jurisdiction*
Beza de Haeret. a Magist. puniendis.
I say on the other side that you must understand, that this was not
ecclesiastical but mere civil, which you might have learned of M. Beza in
diverse places of his book de Haereticis a Magistratu pun. For thus he writes.
Cedo igitur, Christus quo iure flagellum his corripuit? quo iure Petrus Ananiam
and Sapbiram occidit? quo iure Paulus Elymam excaecauit* Number ecclesiastici
ministerij? minime profecto: nisi iurisdictiones confundas. Ergo ciuilis
Magistratus iure: Nihil enim est tertium. Tell me therefore, by what law did
Christ take the whip in hand twice? by what law did Peter kill Ananias and
Saphira? by what right did Paul strike Elymas with blindness? did they those
things by the right of the ecclesiastical ministry? no truly, except you
will confound jurisdictions. They did it therefore by the right of civil
magistracy: for there is no mean. And to the same purpose does he speak
sundry times in that book.

What outcries I have used, or declamations which you have not in ample manner
requited, adding to the same al opprobrious kind of speeches, and jesting
taunts that you could devise, let the indifferent Reader judge: wherefore I
heartily wish unto you, both better knowledge, and better conscience.

Unto M. Doctor asking where it appears that Pope Eugensus brought in prisons
into the Church, as also unto the three or four such like demands* which he
makes in this book, the authors of the Admonition answer at once, that this,
and the other are found in Pantaleon, and M. Bales Chronicles.

Io. Whitgifte.
What authors do they allege for them? for both these be but very late
writers, and this is a matter of history, and therefore requires some great
antiquity nerer unto the time of Eugenius, who lived Anno. 650. but you know
very well that our Bishops claim not this authority by any constitution or
canon of the Pope: neither do they exercise it in their own name: but they
have it from the Prince, and in her name, and by her authority do they use it.

Both these governments were confounded in Moses. Therefore they may be

ecclesiastical, and therefore may be exercised by an ecclesiastical person.

T. C. Page 171. Sect. 1. 2.
Here I will take in that which the Bishop of Sarisburye has in the last page
of his half sheet touching this matter.

And first of all I well agree that he says, that to give unto Satan (which
is to excommunicate, and to correct an ecclesiastical person by reprehension,
or putting him out of the ministry, if the cause so require) is mere
ecclesiastical, and not civil, and that those things ought to be done of the
officers of the Church. This only I deny, that the ministers ought to meddle
with civil offices. For proof whereof, the Bishop alleges the example of
Augustine, which as Possidonius writes was troubled with the hearing and
determining of causes, Wherein Possidonius says nothing, but that I willingly
agree unto. For the minister with the elders ought both to hear and determine
of causes, but of such causes, as perteyne unto their knowledge, whereof I have
spoken before. And that Possidomus meant such causes as belonged unto Augustine,
as he was a minister, and not of civil affairs, it appears by that which he
writes immediately after, where he says: Being also consulted of by certain in
their worldly affairs, he wrote epistles to diverse, but he accounted of this,
as of compulsien, and resiraynte from his better busynesses. Whereby it
appears, that S. Augustine meddled not with those worldly affairs, further
than by way of giving counsel, which is not unlawful for a minister to do,
as one friend unto another, so that his ministry be not thereby hindered.

Io. Whitgifte.
What S. Augustine did in such matters, and whether he weroccupied in worldly
Augustine judge in worldely matters.
matters or no, and that he was not a counsel giver only, but also a judge, it
shall best appear by his own words spoken of himself, which are so plain
and evident, that after you have heard them, you will be ashamed of this
answer to Possidonius, and of your former assertion also. Augustine therefore
in his book de opere Aug. lib. de opere Monac.
Monachorum, of this matter writes thus: Who feeds a flock, and does not
receive of the milk of the flock? And yet I call to witness upon my soul
the Lord Jesus, in whose name I do boldly speak these things, that
touching mine own commodity, I had rather every day (as it is appointed
in well ordered Monasteries) to work some thing with my hands, and to have
the other hours free, to read, and to pray, or too do sum thing in the
Holy Scriptures, than too suffer the tumultuous perplexities of other men's
causes touching secular business, either in determinyng them by judging, or in
cutting them off by intreatyng: to the which troubles Augustine thinks that
the how ghost has bound Bishops to civil causes.
the Apostle has bound us, not by his own judgment, but by the judgment
of him which did speak in him, and yet he himself did not suffer these
troubles, for the discourse of his Apostleship was otherwise. Here in plain
words he declares, that it was secular business about the which he was
occupied: and although he seem to complain of the multitude of such
business, yet does he acknowledge the same to be lawful, just, and
conueniente, and therefore he adds, and says: Which labor
notwythstandyng, we suffer not without the consolation of the Lord, for the
hope of eternal life, that we may bring forth fruit with patience: for we
are servants of that Church, and especially to the weaker members, what
members soever we are, in the same body. And a little after he says, That
he could not omit those business, without the omittyng of his duty. To
the same effect does he speak in that Treatise that is among his Episiles in
number an hundredth and ten, where he desires the people that they would not
moleste him for the space of five days with their worldely matters, by reason
of certain business committed unto him, as it appears in these words: It
pleases me and you, for the care of the scriptures, which the brethren and
fathers, my fellow Bishops did vouchesafe to lay upon me in Ang. epi. 110.

Possidonius names no elders, but speaks only of Augustine, and whosoever
shall with diligence pervse the ninteenth chapter of Possidonius, shall be
enforced to confess that he means Augustine was occupied as well in civil,
as ecclesiastical matters, and in determinyng of them, as in writing of
letters for them, or in giuyng of counsel. Wherefore this example of Augustine
is most fitly alleged of the Bishop of Sarum, and manyfestly declares what
was the use in his days touching such matters.

And for the truth of this matter, that ministers ought not to meddle with
civil affairs, But you shall not find him contrary to him self, as you
surmyse.
I will appeal to no other, than to the Bishop himself, who does assume
plainly the same that the admonition here affirms.

Io. Whitgifte.
In that place the Bishop of Sarisburie speaks only of the Pope, who
usurps M. Jewel speaks not against civil o^ces in ministers simply but
allowed them by his own practice
the whole and full authority of a secular Prince, and does challenge the same
iure diuino, by the authority of Gods word. He speaks not of such Bishops,
to whom so much civil authority is committed by the Prince, as may serve
to the correction of vice, and good and quiet gouernmente of the Church:
for so much as he did himself exercise the same. And surely it is not well done
of you, thus to charge that worthy man with contrarieties unjustly. For does
he that confuteth the Popes unjust claim, and ungodly usurpation of both the
swords in that manner yt he claymeth and uses them, condemn al manner and kind
of civil iurisdctio^ by christian Princes committed to Bishops, being helps
unto them in doing their duty, and tendyng to the good and quiet gouernmente
of the Church? Surely you are good in confounding, but too bad in
distinguishing: wherefore you have untruly reported of that worthy Bishop.

And therefore I conclude that forsomuche as Wherefare you not asha med of
vutruthi
both the holy scriptures do teach, that ministers ought not to meddle with
civil offices, and reason, and the practice of the Church do confirm it, that
they ought to keep themselves within the limits of the ministry and
ecclesiastical functions, least whylest they break forth into the calling of a
Magistrate, in stead of showing them selves (...), that is overseers, they be
found to declare themselves (...) that is busy bodies, medlyng in things which
belong not unto them. And thus putting them in remembrance of that which they
know well mough that they ought (...)* (...).
that is to say, study to adorn that charge which they take in hand, and do
profess. I leave to speak any further of this matter.

Io. Whitgifte.
Melchisedech being a Priest did exercise civil jurisdiction, for he was king
of Salem. The scriptures teach that ecclesiastical persons may have civil
jurisdiction.
Gen 14. Aaron being a Priest did judge the whole people in temporal matters
even in causes of inheritance. Number. 27. In the. 17. of Deuteronomie, there is a
commandment, that civil matters of difficulty shall be referred to the
Priests and to the judge. Elye and Samuel Priests did judge the people in
matters temporal. Genesis 14. Nume. 27. Deuteronomy. 17. 1. Sam.
The people of Israel after their captivity were governed by Priests and
Prophets, as by Esdras, Nehemias, Mattathias. etc. The Scripture in no place
commands the contrary, nor moves unto it, and yet you are not ashamed to
say, that the holy scriptures do teach, that ministers ought not to meddle
with civil offices.

Likewise in Augustines time it is euidente by the words before recited, The
practice of the church concerning civil offices in ministers.
that it was not strange, but usual, and counted a piece of duty for
Bishops to deal in Civil causes, and that as Judges. The authors of the
Centuries, in the fourth Centur. chap. 7. say that Bishops in that age did give
sentence in civil causes, if any did appeal from the Civil courts to
their authority. Sozomene Lib. 1. cap. 9. Bishops gave sentence in civil
causes Cent. 4. cap. 7. Sozom. li. 1. cap. 9.
writes thus of Constantine the Emperor. This was a great argument of his
good affection toward Christian religion, that he made a law for the
freedom of clearkes in all places, and also he gave liberty for those that
were called into judgment to appeal to the Bishops, if they were disposed to
refuse the civil magistrates: and he commanded that their sentence should
stand, and be of more force, than the sentence of the Appeal grau^ ted from
civil magistrates to Bishops.
other judges, even as though it had proceeded from the Emperor himself. And
that the Magistrates and their ministers should see that acomplished, that was
determined and judged in such causes by the Bishops.

Nicephorns lib. 7. cap. 9. makes mention of one Philaeas a Bishop, that was
greatly Niceph. lib. 7. cap. 9.
commended, for his wisdom and dexteritic in determining civil matters
committed unto him. Sozomene lib. 6. cap. 32. testifies of Epiphanius Bishop
of Salamine Soz. li. 6. c. 32. Epiphanius busied with civil canses.
that together with his pastoral office, he was occupied, and that with great
commendation in civil and politic affairs.

Eusebius lib. 7. cap. 32. testifies, that Dorotheus being a Priest of the
Church of Eusebius. lib. 7. cap. 32.
Antioche, and well learned, did scrue the Emperor in civil business.

Theodosius the Emperor made a law, wherein it was decreed, that all civil
stryfes and controversies should be referred to the judgment of the church,
if either Dorotheus. Duaren. lib. 1.
of the parties did desire it. And the same law did Carolus Magnus, afterward
renew and confirm: and yet do you say, that the practice of the church
does confirm that Bishops may not meddle with civil offices.

If you flee to reason: is it not good reason, that a Bishop should have that
office, Some civil jurisdiction given to Bishops is agreeable to reason
and that authority, that may help him, in doing his duly, in correctyng
vice, in procuryng peace, in maynteyning good order, in cuttyng off sects,
schisms, and such like? in accomplyshing all which be that sees not how
much he is helped by such civil authority, as the Prince commits unto
him, is either void of reason, or wilfully blinded.

Wherefore I may most justly conclude, that for so much as the holy
Scriptures The conclusion of this matter.
do teach, that Ecclesiastical persons may meddle with civil effices, the
practyso of the Church confirms the same, and reason tells that it is
convenient: and seeing that such as practice them both in the manner and form
before declared, break not forth into any other man's calling, busy not
themselves in things which belong not unto them, but walk in their calling,
occupy themselves in matters incidents unto it, and do good service both to
God, their Prince, and their country: these offices may very aptely concur
and meet together in one person, and be profitably linked and joined together
in one man. This did Augustine confess, and acknowledges that the Apostle
has bound them to these troubles, not by his own judgment, but by Bishops
bound by the holy ghost to civil troubles
judgment of him that did speak in him: as I have before declared: This have
the godly Bishops, Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, etc. consented unto: this do the
grave, wise and learned Bishops in our time in this Church by experience know.

Unto the two sections I have spoken in that which has been said touching

this Church, and one of the principal causes of rude and ignorant people.

Io. Whitgifte.
I confess that the covetousness of some of them one way, and the
contentiousnesse of some of you an other way, has done much harm in the
Church, and brought no small hinderance to the Gospel. I pray God open the
hearts of all, that every man may espy his own deformity, and be thereof
ashamed.

Likewise unto the two next sections, I have answered before, in speaking
against the spiritual courts, which are now used, and unto the next after
that in speaking of the ordeyning of ministers.

Io. Whitgifte.
You have not answered to this contained page. 233. I will neitheriustifie
that which is amiss, nor condemn that which I know not. Only this I say,
that this taunting spirit of yours seeks rather defamation than reformation,
utters spitefulness of stomach rather than godly zeal: for what a
deriding of authority and disdayn toward the same is this? three of them
would be enough to sting a man to death, for why they are high commissioners.
What example have you of any godly man, that used thus to deride and floute
magistrates, you say all this springs out of that Pontifical, which you
must allow by subscription. etc. But it had bin well if you had told us out of

And unto that which is contained in the latter end of the. 234. and the

the book, yet we neither oppugn as enemies, nor are by the grace of God

call us. And to the prayer against disturbers of the Church, I say with all my

Admonition.
If this be not plain enough by that which is already set forth, we mind by
Gods grace to make it playner, and should do it better, if it were as lawful
for us (as for our adversaries) to publish our minds in print, then should
appear what slender stuff they bring that are so impudent by open writing to
defend it. And if it might please her Majesty, by the advice of you right
Honorable, in this high Court of Parliament, to hear us by writing or
otherwise, to defend ourselves, then (such is the equity of our cause) that we
would trust to find favor in her Majesty's sight: then those patched
Pamphlets, made by sodeine vpstarts, and new conuerts, should appear in their
colors, and truth have the victory, and God the glory: if this cannot be
obtained, we will by Gods grace address ourselves to defend his truth by
suffering, and willingly lay our heads to the block. And this shall be our
peace, to have quiet consciences with our God, whom we will abide for, with
all patience, until he make our full deliverance.

Answer to the Admonition Page 243.
And I will not spare my labor from time to time to utter my mind and
conscience in these matters: protesting that if by learning you can persuade
me, I will say again with Augustine, Errare possum, baereticus esse nolo. All
the rest of your stout and suspicious braggs, of your indecent and unseemly
words, I let pass, and leave them to be considered as notes of your spirit and
modesty. The Queens Majesty may assure her self that she has of learned
men a number sufficient, able by learning to maintain both her authority and
laws which her Majesty has hitherto used, and made for the further^e of the
Gospel, and mainteyning of good order and peace in the Church. The Lord of his
infinite goodness long preserve her, and give us thankful hearts to God for
her.

Unto the next section I have answered in the treatise of the apparel. And
unto the next after, in the treatise which declares to whom it does
appert^ine to make ceremonies and orders of the Church. And unto the section
contained in the. 243. page I say that M. Doctor being asked of oynions,
auswereth of garlike. For the Authors of the Admonition, desiring that it
might be as lawful for them to published by print their minds, or to be heard
dispute, or that their mind put in writing might be openly debated, M. Doctor
answers with Augustines sentence (which he has made the foot of his song)
nothing to the purpose, of that which they says, the performance of which
promise we will notwithstanding wait for.

Io. Whitgifte.
Why? what have they said there worth the answering, that I have not directly
answered unto? they boast of their writing and of their disputing: And I tell
them that I will not spare my labor from time to time, to utter my mind and
conscience in these matters also. What other answer would you have me to make
unto them? The saying of S. Augustine comes in due place: you call it the
foot of my song, and I am very well content you should so do, for I intend to
sing that song, so long as I live, neither can any mislike it, but such as
either be, or intend to be herelikes. I purpose God willing to perform all
the promises that I have made, and when I shrink from any of them, let me
hear of it.

Admonition.
For the Articles, concerning the substance of doctrine, using a godly
interpretation in a point Doctrine. The right government of the Church cannot
be separated from the doctrine. 1. Tim. 3. 2.
or two, which are either too sparely, or else too darkely set down, we were
and are ready, according to duty to subscribe unto them. We would to God that
as they hold the substance together with us, and we with them, so they would
not deny the effect and virtue thereof: then should not our words and works
be deuorced, but Christ should be suffered to reign, a true ministry
according to the word instituted, discipline exercised. Sacraments purely and
sincerely ministered: this is that we strive for, and about which we have
suffered, ( 1. Pet. 3. 17
) not as evil doers, but for resisting popery, and refusing to be stoong with
the tail of Antichristian infection, ready ( 2. Pet. 3. 15.
) to render a reason of our faith, to the stopping of all our enemies mouths.
We therefore for the Church of Gods sake, which ought to be most dear unto
you, beseech you, for our sovereigns sake, upon whom we pray that all Gods
blessing may be poured abundantly, we pray you to consider of these abuses, to
reform Gods Church according to your duties and callings: that as with one
mouth we confess one Christ, so with one consent this reign of Antichriste,
may be turned out headlong from amongst us, and Christ our Lord may reygne by
his word over us. So your seats shall be established and settled in great
assurance, you shall not need to fear your enemies, for God will turn away
his threatened plagues from us, which he in mercy do for his Christ's sake. Amen.

Answer to the Admonition. Page 245. 246.
It is very well, that you so like of the articles, but yet it pleases Of
subscribing to the Articles.
you not to subscribe unto them: you say because of a point or two which are
either too sparely, or else too darkly set down: but indeed your meaning is
to subscribe to nothing, which by authority you are required to do, and that
argues an arrogant mind, and a disposition that loves always to be singular.

You note in the margente that the right government of the Church The argument
of the adversary retorted against himself.
can never be separated from the doctrine: but by your own confession we have
the doctrine, Ergo of necessity we also have the right government. Here in
few words you have cast down whatsoever you seemed before to build, so do
commonly unskillful builders.

I would to God that for so much as (contrary to your former assertion) you now
confess that we have the verity of doctrine, you could be content to say,
down great heart, and submit your selves to the Queens Majesty, and her
laws, according to your duty: then no doubt Christ should without resistance
reign in this Church, and the fruits of the Gospel would much more appear.

You brag much of your suffering, you are little beholding to Persecution
pretended where none is.
your neighbors, when you are thus constreyned to praise your selves. But I
pray you whether does he persecute that modestly and soberly defends the
truth, or he that unlawfully reuengeth himself, with railing and backbi^ing?
you love very well to have the world know how greatly you be persecuted, and
therefore if one of you here in Cambridge be punished but twenty pence for his
open contempt of statutes to the which he is sworn, in post have it is
carried into all quarters, and especially to London, where great complaynte is
made of this grievous persecution, when as you and your disciples, cease not
(as I said) most falsely and slanderously to report of such as executing
good laws, discharge their conscience to God, and their duty toward the
Prince.

We therefore exhort you, if there be any fear of God before your eyes, any
reverence toward the Prince, any desire of promoting the Gospel, any loving
affection toward the Church of Christ, to submit your selves according to
your duties to godly orders, to leave off contentiousnesse, to join with us
in preaching of the word of God, and beating down the kingdom of Antichriste,
that this your division procure not Gods wrath to be poured upon us.

T. C. Page 172. Sect. 2.
Here M. Doctor contrary to the pretestation of the authors of the Admonition,
which declare that for the abuses and corruptions, they dare not simply
subscribe, says, that therefore they will not subscribe, because they are
required by lawful authority, which how both presumptuous and uncharitable a
judgment it is, let all men judge, especially upon this matter, which has
bin declared. And where M. Doctor would upon y^ marginal note pr^, yt we have
good discipline, because we have good doctrine, and there upon does wonderfully
triumph, he plays as he of whom it is said (...), that is having gotten
nothing holds it fast. For can M. Doctor be so ignorant, that this manner of
speech (doctrine and discipline cannot be s^uered) is used of that that they
ought not to be severed* when as we say (following S. Paul) that we can do
nothing against the truth, do we not mean that we ought to do nothing or can
do nothing lawfully against it? And do not all men know when we say that a man
cannot be separated from his wife, but for the cause of A^ultery, that we mean
he ought not, or he cannot lawfully? Therefore this is (as all men may see) a
mere cavil and triumph over his own shadow. There is no brag of suffering
made by the authors of the Admonition. The modesty wherewith he has defended
this cause, cannot be hidden. That he would have other men punished for well
doing, when he is not content that the open wrongs which he does, should be
once spoken of, I have showed how unreasonable it is.

Io. Whitgifte.
I speak of their denying to subscribe to the Articles concerning the
substance of doctrine, which they confess to be sound using a godly
interpretation in a point or two. etc. what other abuses so ever there be in
the book of common prayer, or in the Church, yet that is no sufficient cause,
why they should refuse to subscribe to the truth of doctrine professed in this
Church, and contained in those Articles. Wherefore seeing they confess them to
be sound, and yet deny to subscribe, who can otherwise judge of them, than I
have signified in my Answer.

I acknowledge my self to be ignorante that in this and such like phrases
this Can is not taken for ought, if it be spoken simply
word Can, is taken for ought. When Saint Paul says, that we can do nothing
against the truth, he means simply as he speaks, and does not there use
Can, for ought. For indeed we can do nothing against the truth, though we do
the worst we can. It is no usual phrase, but an improper kind of speech to
say, that a man cannot do a thing, when he should say that he ought not to do
it, except he add some thing, as he cannot do it lawfully, or well, or
orderly, and such like. Wherefore my dullness is such that I cannot understand
such dark speeches, until they be interpreted, and yet whether they would
so interpret themselves or no, it may be doubted.

If they brag not of persecution, whereunto tend these words of theirs,
this is that we strive for, about which we have suffered, not as evil doers.
etc. and quote in the margent to prove it. 1. Pet. 3. as though they were
persecuted by infidels?

How immodest soever I am in defending this cause, yet if it be compared either
to Schismatiks deserve to be sharply reproved.
their passing bitterness, or to your spiteful speeches, and unseemly
tauntes and iestes, I shall appear tootoo simple: and although I must needs
say thus much, that disturbers of the common peace of the Church, and
Schismatikes, deserve to be with sharp words reproved, yet have not I used
that sharpness and bitterness, which diverse learned men both old and
new have used in the like case.

If I have done any man wrong let him come forth and prove it, and I will
render unto him quadruple.

T. C. Page 172. Sect. 3.
Finally as you exhort us to submit ourselves to good order, which have bin
always, and yet are ready to do: to leave to be contentious, which never yet
began: to join with you in preaching the word of God, which have stopped our
mouths, and will not suffer us to preach: so we exhort you in Gods behalf,
and as you will once answer it before the just judge, that you will not
willingly shut your eyes against the truth, that if the Lord vouchsafe to open
it unto you, you kick not against it? Wherefore we pray you to take heed,
that neither the desire of keeping your wealth and honor which you are in,
nor the hope which you may have of any further promotion, nor yet the care of
keeping your estimation, by mainteining that which you have once set down,
nor the sleighey suggestion of crafty and wyly Papists, do drive you to
stumble against this truth of God, which touches the government of his Church,
and the purging of those corruptions which are amongst us, knowing that you
cannot stumble upon the word of God, but forthwith you run yourselfe against
Christ, which is the rock. And you know that he will not give back, but
breaks all to fitters, whatsoever that rusheth against him.

Io. Whitgifte.
You do not submit your selves to the order of the Church, which is a good and
decent order: you have filled the Church with marvelous contentions, and have
strangely divided, even such as profess the Gospel: your mouths are not
stopped but through your own procuring.

I do not withstand that which you untruly call the truth, for any such cause
as you surmise, (God who sees my heart knows) but because I see these your
devises to be set down by you without any sufficient warrant in the word of
God: against the practice and order of the primitive Church, tending also to
dangerous errors, and mere confusion both of the Church and of the common
wealth.

T. C. Page. 172. Sect. vlt.
And if the matter herein alleged, do not satisfye you, then I desire even
before the same GOD, that you confute it, not by passing over things which
you can not answer, or by stauing both the words and the meaning of the book,
and taking your own fancy to confuce, or by wrougling with the fault of the
print, or by carping at the translation, when the words being changed the
sense remains, or by alleging that such a one, or such another was of this
or that judgment, as you for the most part (having nothing but his bare name)
have done. All which things you have committed in this book* but that you
confute it, by the authority of the word of God, by good and sound reasons,
wholly, and not by peecemeale. And if you bring the practice of the churches, we

counterfeyte, and which were in the best and purest times. And if you think
that the credit of your Doctor ship or Deanery will bear out that which you

men will not be deluded with nothing, nor abused with visards, neither let it
embolden you which peradventure has made poli presume the more in* this
book) to write any thing upon hope, that no man dare answer it. For neither
the Queens Majesty nor her honorable counsel, as we are persuaded, will
deal so sharply with those, whom they know to be faithful, and lawful
subjects, which pray that all the treasures of Gods wisdom may be poured upon
them: neither have we cause to think, but that as the evil opinion which is
in part conceived of us, has grown upon false and untrue informations,
which you and such other have given in crying in their ears, that we be
Anabaptists, conspired with Papists, Puritanes, Donatists, bringers in of
confusion and anarchy, enemies to civil government, and I know not what: even
so when her Majesty, and their honors shall understand how far we are from
those wicked opinions, they will leave that opinion of us* and rather esteem
of us, by that we have preached, taught, and now write, than that which other
men report of us, being things which we never taught* spoke, or so much as
dreamed of.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is so far from satisfying me in any point, that it greatly confirms me
in some thing, where unto before I did but incline. Such is the weakness of
your grounds.

Your request made unto me is against all reason, for how can you require that

me toward you, which you have in no respect performed toward me? for
first, you have not set down my book, that the Reader might perceive, how
uprightly you deal with me: secondly, you have passed over many things and
left them unanswered: Thirdly, you have unreasonably wrested my words, and in
most places you do nothing but wrangle: you have mangled my book, and so skipt
from place to place, that the Reader shall hardly perceine, what you take or
what you leave: to be short, you have used few scriptures, and those
vntollerably wrested. How then can you require the contrary of me? But I have
satisfied your request to the full I trust: save only I do not intend to learn
of you how to answer, what authority to use, but if the authorities and
reasons that I bring shall be sound to be light, they shall the more easily by
you be removed.

I depend not upon the credit of my Doctorship or Deanery, neither would I wish
you too much to trust to the opinion of your own learning and wit: I say
with Saint Augustine, Let scripture be compared with scripture, reason with
reason, authority with authority, cause with cause, and let us both according
to the same be judged.

I doubt not of the answering of my book, neither do I fear it: you know
that Conference by writing has bin often offered to the Replier.
I have offered you diverse times this kind of conference, though not in this
public manner. I have spoken nothing against you, before her majesty, which
your books and doings, have not proved to be true. Her Majesty and their
honors know what they have to do, the Lord bliss them with his holy spirit,
and in all their doings guide them.

Beside that often thne^ M. Doctor does account the expositions and
explanations, corrections, he ^ueth us somewhat the less hope, that he will
correct his errors, for that he purfueth the authors of the Admonition so
hard, correcting their very small and few slips, which they have made,
calling this singular ^destie and commendable hum^tie amongst other reproaches,
dalying and inconstancy, when it is our profession every day to learn better
things. For unto what end should we live, if time, if experience, if reading,
^iusing, if conference should teach us nothing? And therefore when things are
printed again, it is good and praise worthy, to polishe those things which
are some what rud^, to mitigate these things which are too sharp, to make
plain and to give light to those things which seem darker, and to correct
that which is amiss. I think M. Doctor should not be ignorante, that wise men
have their (...), there second counsels, and those also wiser and better than
their first, as that sentence does declare. I will therefore say no more
hereof, but admonish M. Doctor that he receive more lovingly those which
correct themselves, seeing that the best defense to his book, must be, not a
correction here and there, but a clean blotting, or striking out, not an
amending, but a new making almost of his whole book. Other matter in his
censures, he has almost none at all worth the answering, saving that he has
a place or two, which touches the matters before entreated of.

their cunning: if this ought to be in humane matters, and in external affairs
of the life of man, how much more ought it to be in divine matters, and things
perteyning to the kingdom of heaven. I do not mislike that modesty and
humility, that is content to be corrected, and to acknowledge that which is
ami^e. But I can by no means allow that pride and arrogancy, that presuming
to condemn the whole state of a Church, and to prescribe unto the same a new
platform, is by and by after, through unskillfulness, and lack of discretion
at the first, constreyned to misselyke that new platform also, and to p^ce it
and patch it like a beggars cloak, with putting too and taking fro, with
altering and changing sometime this, and sometime that, like unto foolish and
unskillful buylders. It behooves such as will take upon them in church matters
to pluck down that which is already builded, and to prescribe a new
platform, to be certain of their ^ing, expert in their doings, grounded in
learning and experience: not yonglings and nouices, whose yea to day is nay to
morrow, whose heads are full of new toys and devises, who publish in print their
first cogitations and counsels, before they have any leisure to think of their
second. This is that which I misselyke, and reprove in the authors of the
Admonition: for (...).
if they had published their minds as scholars, and not as masters: as
learners, not as teachers: as putters in mind of that which best liked
themselves, not as prescribers what all other men ought of duty to follow,
their sudden corrections had been much more tolerable. But I will not
multiply words with you, neither will I require that which you
contemptuously enoughe have spoken of my self, only I admonish the Reader to
take heed how he does credit such rash and young buylders, which so soon
as they have ended their buylding, must be constrained to pluck down the same
again.

Answer to the Additions, detractions. etc. of the first part of the
Admonition.
In the preface, to Archbishops, Bishops, Suffraganes, Deanes. etc. they have
Doctors and Bachelors of diuin^ie mislyked.
added University Doctors, and Bachelors of divinity. It should seem that
they would have a confusion of degrees (which they call equality) as well in
universities, as in Parishes, and other their imagined congregations: mark
whether this gear tend not to the overthrow of universities, and of all good
learning.

T. C. Page 173. toward the end of the first Section.
For whereas he accuses the Authors of the Admonition in the first leaf, as
though they should condemn Doctors and Bachlers of divinity, and so bring in
confusion of degrees, he upon the. 5. leaf confesses that they allow of a
Doctor. Although he that takes away degrees of Doctor or Bachler of diumine,
does not bring in confusion, nor takes not away all degrees of schools,
especially seeing they are now made bare names without any offices, and
oftentimes they are admitted to these degrees, which neither can, nor will
teach.

Io. Whitgifte.
I say that belike they allow of a Doctor of law, because they have left that
title out in their second edition: and have in stead thereof placed Doctors,
and Bachlers of divinity. The cause why you leave so much unto them in this
barbarous opinion, The cause why the Replier joins against degrees in
diumitie.
may be coniectured, to be the repulse that you suffered when you earnestly
desired the one of them. If the degrees be bestowed upon unworthy persons
(which you are not able to prove at this day) the fault is in the persons that
so bestow them, not in the degrees, the taking away whereof, must needs in the
end bring in confusion and barbarism: and in deed they can by no means
stand with your platform, and therefore do you here insinuate that you are
content to allow all the degrees in schools, but only the degrees in
divinity, and yet as I said before, not long since you greatly desired even
the highest of them.

Additions, detractions, and alterations in the first part of the Admonition.
In the Preface.
In the margent, for the. 15. of Matthew. verse. 23. they have quoted the. 15. of
Math. verse. 13. to prove that tyrannous Lordship cannot stand with Christ's
kingdom: the words be these: But he ansvvered and said, enery plant which my
father has not planted, shall be rooted up, meaning that such as be not by
free adoption and grace grafted in Jesus Christ, shall be rooted up. But this
proves not their proposition: I do not allow tyrannous Lordship, but I disallow
such unapt reasons.

In the same Preface speaking of Bishops. etc. they have added these words:
they were once of our mind, but since their consecration they be so
transubstantiated, that they are become such as you see. It may be that
consideration of the time, place, state, condition, and other circumstances
has altered some of them in some points, as wise (and not wilful) men in such
matters by such circumstances be oftentimes altered: but that any one of them
were ever of your mind in most things uttered in those two treatises, I can
not be persuaded.

Fol. 1.
For the. 1. Act. verse. 12. is noted. Act. 2. verse. 2^. to prove that in the
old Church there was a try all had both of the Ministers ability to instruct,
and of their godly conversation also. The text is this: And it shall be that
whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Which is farther
from the purpose a great deal, than the other place is. There is also in the
same leaf left out, King Edwards Priests: which King Edwards priests left out.
argues with how little discretion, and less advise, the first Admonition
was pe^ed.

Speaking of learning master Nowels Catechism, these words be added: and so
first they consecrate them, and make them Ministers, and then they set them to

have been left out. And a little after, where it was before, then election was
made by the common consent of the whole Church: now it is thus corrected, A
correction of a place.
then election was made by the Elders, with the common consent of the whole
Church: which alters the matter something, but yet is not proved by the text
alleged out of the first of the Acts, and by me answered before.

Fol. 2.
For Act. 14. verse. 13. is quoted Act. 14. verse. 23. which oversight I my
self have corrected in my answer to that place.

There is also left out an Albe, which before was said to be required Albe
left out.
by the Pontifical in the ordering of ministers. As I said before, so I say
again, that in the book of ordering ministers, now used, and printed since
Anno dom. 1559. there is neither required albe, surples, vestiment, nor
pastoral staff.

This line is also added, these are required by their Pontifical, meaning
surplesse, vestiment. etc. which is untrue, as I have said before.

For the. 1. Tim. 1. verse. 14. now it is. 1. Tim. 1. verse. 19. but it is not
to prove any matter in controversy, only it is uncharitably and unjustly
applied.

For. 1. Sam. 9. verse. 28. is placed. 1. Sam. 9. verse. 18. the self same
place that I have answered before.

Where before it was thus written: Then ministers were not so tied to any form
of prayers invented by man: now these words invented by man be left out, and
there is added, as necessity of time required, so they might pour. etc. I
know not their meaning, except they would neither have us bound to the
Lords prayer, nor any other.

Fol. 3.
It was before, remove Homilies, Articles, Injunctions, a prescript order: now

it is that prescript order. Whereby it should seem that they have learned to
allow of a prescript order of prayers, but not of that prescript order which
is in the book of public prayers. This is no dallying, neither yet
inconstancy.

For the. 3. of Mat. ver. 12. is placed. 3. of Mat. ver. 1. to prove that in
the old time the word was preached before the sacraments were ministered: the
place now alleged is this: In those days John the Baptist came and preached
in the wilderness of Judea. This proves that Iohnpreached, but it proves
not, that whenever John did baptize, then he did preach.

Oueragaynst these words, the Nicene creed was not read in their communion, A
protestation by the way.
is written in the margent, Note that we condemn not the doctrine contained
therein. If you condemn not the doctrine therein, what do you then condemn? or
why mislike you the communion, because that creed containing true doctrine is
read at the celebration thereof? It is well that you make this protestation, if
you mean good faith.

Here is also added the. 42. ver. Act. 2. to prove that then the sacrament was
ministered with common and usual bread: which place I have answered before, in
answering to the. 46. verse of that chapter.

Where as before it was thus, interrogatories ministered to the Infant,
Godfathers They allow godfathers and godmothers at the last.
and Godmothers brought in by Higinus: now Godfathers and Godmothers brought
it by Higinus is left out. It is happy that you are sosoone persuaded to allow
of godfathers and godmothers: I perceive you took upon you to set down a
platform of a Church, before you had well considered of it.

Fol. 4.
For, some one of the congregation, is now, some of the congregation: whereby
they seem to allow mo godfathers than one, which they did not before.

For the. 14. of the Acts, verse. 4. is noted the. 15. of the Acts, verse. 4. to
prove that the office of Seniors was to govern the Church with the rest of the
ministers: but without reason. For it is only there written, that at Jerusalem
there was Apostles and Elders, and that Paul and Barnabas declared unto them
what things God had done by them. I deny not the thing it self (whereof I
have sufficiently spoken before) but the argument.

These Seniors then because their charge was not over much, did execute their
office in their own persons: Now these words, because their charge was not
over much be left out. Wherefore they have left them out I know not.

Fol. 5.
They have left out Doctors three times in this leaf, which before they
recited with Chauncelors, Archdeacons, Officials, Commissaries, Why Doctors of

Proctors. Belyke they have remembered that this word Doctor, is found in the
new Testament, and especially Doctor of law.

To prove equality of ministers, they have added Phil. 1. verse. 1. 1. These.
1. 1. The first place is this, Paul and Timotheus the servant of Jesus
Christ to all Saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the Bishops
and Deacons. The second is this: Paul and Syluanus and Timotheus unto the
Church of the Thessalonians. etc. Truly I know not how to conclude of those
places an equality of all ministers: I would to God you would set down your
places, and frame your arguments yourselues.

Fol. 6.
They have forgotten to quote Heb. 6. 1. and have left out the body and Tail

branch of Antichrist, and for the same have put in the tail: But these are
but trifles, and very slender corrections.

Io. Whitgifte.
To all these there is nothing said, belike the Authors of the Admonition
must answer for them selves, or else provide another Proctor.

Answer to the additions. etc. of the second part of the admonition.
Fol. 2.
For the first of Tim. 3. verse. 3. now they have quoted. 1. Tim. 3. verse. 6.
against reading ministers: Where S. Paul would not have a minister to be a young
scholar: but he speaks nothing against reading.

T. C. Page 173. Sect. 2.
Unto the second leaf of the addition of the second part of the Admonition,
M. Doctor says that because the. 3. to Titus, makes not against reading,
therefore it makes not against reading ministers, that is, ministers that can
do nothing but read.

Io. Whitgifte.
It is in the. 1. Tim. 3. and it makes against unlearned Ministers, not
against the reading of Ministers: for he may be a reading Minister, and yet
learned.

Answer to the Detractions. etc.
It was before reading is not feeding, now it is thus amended, for Correction
of a sodeyne.
bare reading of the word, and single service saying, is bare feeding: whereby
they now confess, that reading is feeding, although it be (as they say) but
bare feeding. We were in good case if the platform of our Church depended upon
these men, which alter their judgments so suddenly. It is a true saying,
Conueniet nulli qui secum dissidet ipse. How can he agree with other, that
does not agree with himself?

T. C. Page 173. Sect. vlt.
And where as he would pick out a contradiction in the words of the
Admonition, because they say bare reading is but bare feeding, the discord is
in his cares, not in their words. For when they said it was no feeding, they
meant such feeding as could save them, and so in calling it bare feeding, they
note that there is not This is anec^m, and contrary to that which ^ou have pa.
158. (...). 15. etc.
inaugh in that, to keep them from famishment. And indeed unless the Lord
work miraculously and extraordinarily (which is not to be looked for of us)
the bare reading of the scriptures without the preaching, cannot deliver so
much as one poor sheep from destruction, and from the wolf. And if some have
been converted wonderfully, yet. M. D. should remember that (...). That is, the
water does not always bear iron.

Io. Whitgifte.
Reading is not feeding, and reading is bear feeding, be both untruths, and
derogate from the Majesty and dignity of the word of God: but yet in these
speeches there is contrariety, for bare feeding is feeding. What they meant by,
not feeding, their words following do declare, for (say they) it is as evil
as playing upon a stage and worse to. etc. The Replier falls into
contrariety whiles he seeks to clear the Admonition of it.
whereof I have spoken before. But whilst-you go about to excuse them of
contrariety, you fall into it your self, for page. 158. of your book,
comparing the reading of the Scriptures, with reading of Homilies, yeu say,
that the word of God is also plain and easy to be understood, and such as
gives understanding to Idiots and to the simple. etc. And now you say, that
there is not enough in the reading of the scrptures, to keep the people from
famishment. etc. the which how far it differs, from your former words, no
man is so blind Page 158. Lin. 15. etc.
that can not see. Beside this, it is a Popish, and an ungodly opinion,
contrary to the worthiness and profitablenesse of the Scriptures: contrary
to the words of Christ Iobn. 5.
John. 5. Search the Scripture, etc. contrary to the words of the Apostle. 2.
Tim. 3. Omnis 2. Tim. 3. Tract. 13.

alleged before for the reading of the Scriptures, to the which for the further
confutation of this ungodly error, I do refer the Reader.

Priesthood or of the Priesthood of Christ. Here as I think they have
forgotten that which Peter speaks to all Christians, in his. 1. Epist. cap.

Priesthod to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, by Jesus Christ.
and ver. 9. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood. etc. And Apo.
1. And make us Kings and Priests unto God etc. I willed them before to show me
one place in the whole new Testament, where this word Priest as touching the
office, is taken in evil part: I may be deceived, but I desire to learn.

T. C. Page 174. Sect. 1.
And upon the. 3. leaf, where he gives instance in the Apocalips of the word
(Priest) to be taken otherwise, than for the Leuitical priesthood, and
priesthood of our savior Christ. M. D. cannot be ignorant that the Admonition
speaks of those which be priests in deed, and properly, and not by those
which are priests by a inctaphore and borrowed speech. And whereas he desires to
learn where the word, priest, is taken in evil part in all the new
testament. Although all men see how he asks this question of no mind to
learn, yet if he will learn (as he says) he shall find that in In what
Chapter*
the Acts of the Apostles it is taken diverse times in evil part. For seeing
that the office and function of (...), that is, of priests was (after our
savior christ's asce^tion) naught and ungodly: the name whereby they were
called, which did exercise that ungodly function, cannot be otherwise taken
than in the evil part.

Io. Whitgifte.
And what say you to the places of S. Peter, is not this word (priest) taken
in good part there also? I desired to have one place in all the new Testament
named unto me, where this word priest is taken in evil part, and you send me
over to the Acts of the Apostles naming neither text nor chapter: and yet that
satisfies not my request, for the Authors of the Admonition in their
corrections, except the Leuitical priesthood, and the priesthood of Christ,
whereof only there is mention made in the Acts of the Apostles, except it be
in the. 14. of the Acts, where Luke speaks of heathnish priests, as of the
priest of Jupiter: so that my question is as yet unanswered by you.

Answer to the Additions. etc.
Fol. 5.
But of the Bishops benediction by laying on of his hands hear master
Caluines judgment in this Instit. cap. 19. Section. 4. Talem manuum Imposition
of hands in confirmation allowed by Calvin.
impositionem quae simpliciter loco benedictionis fiat, laudo, and restitutam
hodie in purum vsum velim. Such imposition of hands as is simply made in the
stead of blessing, I do commend, and vvish that it were restored at this day
to the pure use. There shall you also read the very self same form and manner
of confirmation allowed, which is now used in this Church of England.

T. C. Page 174. Sect. 2.
Master Doctor upon the. 5. leaf, cyteth M. Caluins authority to prove that
the laying on of the hands upon young children, and the confirmation which is
here used is good. In the which place, although he allow of a kind of
confirmation, yet he does not commend^ that which we have. For he does plainly
reprove Jerome, for saying that it came from the Apostles, which
notwithstanding the confirmation with us does affirm. Besides that there are
other abuses which I have noted there, which M. Calvin does not by any word
allow. He allows indeed of a putting on of hands of the children, when they
come out of their childehoode, or begin to be young men, but as well as he does
allow of it, he was one of those which did thrust it out of the Chuch where he
was Pastor. And He re you make M. Calvin contrary to him self, but untruly.
so he allows of it, that he brings (in the sixth Section of the same
Chapter) a strong reason to abolish it. Where he asks what the imposition of
hands should do now, seeing that the gifts of the holy Ghost by that
ceremony is ceased. Therefore seeing that we have M. Caluins reason against
this imposition of hands, his name ought not to be prejudicial unto us:
especially seeing that we have experience of great inconuemences which come by
it, which master Calvin could not have, that thing being not in use in that
Church where he lived. Which inconvenience in things which are not necessary,
ought to be a just cause of abolishing of them: And this is not my indgement
only, but the judgment of the Churches of Heluetia, Berne, Tigurine, Geneua,
Scotland, and diverse others as appears in the. 19. Chap. of their confession.

Io. Whitgifte. The common refuge of the Replier is to discredit the Author.

Here you would shift of M. Caluins authority if you knew how: but being
ouerpressed with his manifest words, you fly to your common and usual refuge,
that is, to discredit the Author, by charging him with contrarieties in this
matter: for you confess that he allows a kind of confimation: you say also
that he allows in deed of a putting on of hands of the children, when they
come out of their childhoode or begin to be young men: and again you affirm:
that he was one of those, that did thrust it out of the Church where he was
Pastor: and that he brings in the 6. Section of the same Chapter a strong
reason to abolish it. Thus you set Master Calvin against himself, and that in
the same Calvin untruly charged with contrariety by the Replyer.
Chapter, which cannot but turn to his great discredit, if it were true: but
you greatly abuse both the Reader and him: for in the. 4. section which I have
alleged, he speaks of that manner of confirmation and imposition of hands
which was used in the old Church, and the same that is now used in the Church
of England, which he allows and wishes restored: In the fifth and sixth
sections he speaks of the manner and form of confirmation, and laying on of
hands used by the Papists, and disproueth that: as his own words, (which I
have for that purpose more at large set down) do plainly declare: for in the
fourth Section of the. 19. Chapter thus he writes. This was the manner in
times past, that the children of Christians should be Calvin inst. cap. 9
sect. 4.
set before the Bishop, after they were come to years of discretion, that they
might perform that, which was required of them, that being of age did offer
themselves to baptism. For these sat among the Catechumeni, until (being
rightly instructed in the mysteries of faith) they were able to utter a
confession of their faith, before the Bishop and the people. The insants

faith in the Church: at the end of their childehoode, or in the beginning of
their youth, they were again presented of their parents, and were examined of
the Bishop, according to a certain and common form of a Catechism. And to
the intent that this action (which otherwise ought of right to be grave and
holy) might have the greater reverence and estimation, there was added also the
ceremony of laying on of hands, so the child was dismissed, his faith being
approved with a solemn blessing. The ancient fathers make often mention of
this order. Pope Leo, If any man return from heretics, let him not again be
baptized, but let the virtue of the spirit (which was wanting) be given unto
him by the laying on of the Bishops hands. Here our adversaries will cry,
that it is rightly called a Sacrament, wherein the holy Ghost is given. But Leo
himself does in another place expound what he means by those words: He
that is baptized (says he) of heretics, let him not be rebaptised, but let
him be confirmed, with the invocation of the holy Ghost, by the imposition of
hands: because he received only the form of baptism without sanctification.
Hierome also makes mention hereof, contra Luciferianos. Although I do not
deny, that Herome is somewhat herein deceived, that he says that it is an
Apostolical observation: yet is he most far from these men's follies. And he
mittigateth it when he says that this blessing was granted only to the
Bishop, rather for the honor of priesthood, than by the necessity of the law.
Wherefore such an imposition of hands which is simply in stead of a blessing,
I commend, and would wish it were at these days restored to the pure use.

These words be evident, and declare a manner of confirmation correspondent to
ours.

In the fifth Section he writes thus. But the latter age have brought in a
counterfey^e The abuse of confirmation in the popish Church.
confirmation in stead of a Sacrament of God, the thing it self being almost
quite blotted out. They feyne this to be the virtue of confirmation, to give
the holy Ghost unto the increase of grace, which was given in baptism to
innocence of life, to confirm them unto battle, which in baptism were
regenerated unto life. This confirmation is wrought with anointing, and this
form of words: I sign the with the sign of the holy Ghost, and I confirm
thee with the ointment of salvation, in the name of the father, and of the
son, and of the holy ghost. etc. And in confuting this manner of confirmation,
and imposition of hands, he proceeds on in this fifth Section, and in the
sixth Section. Wherefore Master Calvin is not contrary to himself, neither
disalloweth that kind of confirmation and imposition of hands in the sixth
Section, which he allows in the fourth. But in the one he approves the manner
of the ancient and purer Church touching confirmation: in the other he
disproueth the use and doctrine of the papistical church, concerning the same.
This might you have seen, if you had bin disposed: but you care not whom you
discredit so that you may win credit to your self.

The confession of the Churches of Heluetia, Berne, etc. speak only of the
Popish The Repl^ viech that against our confirmation which is (...) of the
Papists. Confess. Heluet. cap. 19.
confirmation, which the Papists make one of their seven Sacraments, as it is
manifest by the words of the confession which be these. Confirmation and
extreme unction or anealing, are the inuentio^s of man, which the church may
want without any damage: Neither use we them in our churches, for they have
some things which we can not allow. Now to use that against Confirmation,
reformed and purged from these things which they mislike, which is spoken of
the Popish confirmation with all the abuses, can it be (think you) the part
of an honest, and plain dealing man?

Answer to the Additions. etc. Fol. 6.
In the end of that fiftenth article or reason, this is added: And which of
them have not preached against the Popes two swords: now whether they use
the^ not them selves? Touching the Popes two swords, we are of the same mind
still, for the Pope contrary to the word of God takes from Princes unto him
self, that authority which is due unto them by the word of God, and would
have them to receive that authority from him, which he has no power to give:
the Pope also requires the full authority of a civil magistrate, and
exempteth him self from all subjection, which is ^lat contrary to the word of
God: our Bishops Bishops do not use the ciuiil sword as the pope does.
in this church do not challenge (as of their own right) any such civil
authority, but only according to their duty execute that, that by the Prince,
and laws of this realm, for just considerations is laid upon them. Neither
do they meddle in all civil causes, or exercise all civil jurisdiction, but
such only as helps to discipline, and to the good government of this church
and state: wherefore we may safely preach against the Popes two swords, and
yet lawefully defend that jurisdiction and authority, that any Bishop has in
this church for any thing that I know.

T. C. Page. 174. Sect. 3.
Upon the sixth leaf M. Doctor says that the Pope takes the sword from
Princes, but our Bishops take it at their hands, and given of them: as though
challenge were not made against the Pope for using the material sword, and
not only for using it against the will of the Princes. For by that reason if
Princes would put their swords in his hand, as sometimes they have done; he
might lawefully use them. And whereas he says that our churchmen meddle not
with all civil causes, or exercise all civil jurisdiction, but such as
helps to discipline, and the good government of the church, and the estate.
What says he, that is not truly said of any civil magistrate in the realm.
For no one does meddle in all causes. And further I would gladly know what
civil jurisdiction is in this realm, which helps not unto the good
government of this church and estate. For if they meddle with all that, there is
none which they have not to do with.

Io. Whitgifte.
The thing it self declares and the practice of this church is evident, in
what sort Difference betwixt the civil jurisdiction of the Pope, and of our
Bishops.
and condition such civil offices are committed to ecclesiastical persons:
and that they do not rule as kings, but as subjects to kings, nor that they
challe^ge not this of any other authority, but from the Prince, and that they
use it to no other end than the good and godly government of the church:
whereas the Pope rules as Emperor and king, not as subject: challenges his
authority of duty, and by the word of God, not by the grant of Princes, and
uses it most Tyrannically, even to the placing and displacing of kings and
Empereurs at his pleasure. And this is that usurped jurisdiction which all good
men cry out of, and mislike, and not the other which is ordinary, usual and
lawefull. When I say that Bishops have that civil jurisdiction which
helps to discipline, and the good government of the church and state: all
men may understand that I mean such civil jurisdiction, as is meet for
them to execute, and agreeable to their vocation and calling.

Answer to the Additions. etc. Fol. 7.
Whereas before it was thus in the margent, and. 19. reason: To prove that the
regiment of the Church should be spiritual, read Ephesians. 1. 23. 1. These. 5.
13. 1. Tim. 5. 2. Heb. 10. 30. now it is thus altered: to prove that the
regiment of the church should be spiritual, read Calvin in his Commentaries
upon these places Ephe. 1. 23. 1. These. 5. 13. 1. Ti. 5. 2. Heb. 10. 30. Belike
because the scriptures them selves do not sufficiently prove your assertion,
therefore you would have us to leave them, and to rest upon Caluines
interpretation, which is nothing else but to prefer man's judgment before the
word of God, or to give M. Calvin authority to conclude that which is not
determined by the scripture. If this be not your meaning why fly you from
those places them selves to M. Caluines interpretation upon them? But what if
you now abuse M. Caluines Commentaries upon these places, as you did before the
places them selves? In his commentaries upon Ephe. 1. verse. 23. This is all that
he says touching this matter. Nam vtcunque Christus omnia perficiat, nutu
virtureque sua: tamen specialiter loquitur hic Paulus de spirituali ecclesiae
gubernatione. Quanqua^ nihil interea impedit quominus de universally mundi
gubernatione accipias. For hovvesoeuer Christ makes perfect all things with
his beck and by his power, yet Paul speaks here especially of the
spiritual government of the church. Although that in the mean time it is no
hinderance, why thou may not also understand it of the universal
government of the world. These words serve little for your purpose. There is
no man that doubts, but that Christ does spiritually govern his church, and
reign in the hearts of the faithful by his spirit: But your meaning is that
the government of the church is only spiritual, which you can no more gather
of these words of Calvin, than you may that of the government the whole world
ought only to be spiritual.

The same Calvin writing upon. 1. These. 5. verse. 12. for the which you have
noted the. 13. says on this sort: Hoc additum videtur, ad notandum spirituale
regimen, tameesi enim reges quoque and magistratus Dei ordinatione praesunt,
quia tamen ecclesiae gubernationem dominus peculiariter vult suam agnosci, ideo
nominatim praeesse in Domino dicuntur, qui Christi nomine and mandato ecclesia^
gubernant. This seems to be added to note the spiritual regiment, For
although kings also and magistrates do govern by the ordinance of God, yet
because the Lord would have the government of the church known peculiarly
to be his, therefore namely they are said to rule in the Lord, which
gouernethe the church in the name of Christ and by his commandment. Hitherto
Calvin also affirms that which no man denies, that God does by the
ministry of his word, spiritually govern his church. But this takes not
away the eiuill magistrate, neither yet civil laws made by the Magistrate
externally also to govern the church. In his Commentaries. 1.Ti. 5 verse. 2.
he speaks not one word of this matter for any thing that I can perceive.
Upon the place to the Hebrews, he only shows that God does govern his
church, the which I think no man is so wicked as to deny. You must more
plainly set it down what your meaning in this matter is, before you can be
fully answered. For to prove that God does spiritually govern his church is
nedelesse, being denied Anabaptisme after a sort ^fended.
of none, either Papiste or Protestante: but thereupon to conclude that the
civil Magistrate is secluded from the government of the church, or that there
needs no external regiment, is dangerous and sauoreth Anabaptisme.

T. C. Page. 174. Sect. vlt.
Upon the seventh leaf he says that he knows not the meaning of the
Admonition, when it proves that the government of the church is spiritual,
their meaning is plain enough and I have declared it more at large to be, not
only that our savior Christ rules by his spirit in the hearts of his elect,
(besides which government M. Doctor seems to know none) but that there is
also spiritual government, which is in the whole church visible and to be
seen, exercised by those whom God has appointed in his stead, called
spiritual, because whereas the civil government uses the sword, this uses
the word. and where the civil governor addresseth him self unto the body,
and has that for special matter to work on: the spiritual governors be
occupied in reforming the mind, and subduing that with those punishementes and
corrections which God has appointed for that purpose. Which signification of
spiritual government, M. Calvin does speak of in both the places alleged
by M. Doctor. and especially in the latter, unto whom the Admonition sent the
Reader, not thereby to give more weighte unto the truth, but that he might
have there a playner, and fuller understanding of that which is meant, and could
not for that brevity and shortness which it follows throughout, utter at
large. Whereby it is manifest, that the Admonition is so far from shutting
out either civil government or external government in the church, that it
teaches of an external government which M. doctor seems not to have heard
of, albert there be nothing either more common in the scriptures, or
ecclesiastical writers.

Io. Whitgifte.
You replye not to my answer, neither do you tell us why you have left out
the places of Scripture before quoted, and in place thereof put M Calvin:
Neither have you salued their unapt and unfit alleging of M. Calvin, who
is far from proving their purpose in those places which they have noted. In
deed the true spiritual government of the church is the ruling of Christ by
his spirit in the hearts of the elect: neither do I deny but that
admonition, exhortation, and excommunication The whole external government of
the church is not spiritual.
perteine also to the spiritual government of the church, because they
perteyne to the inward man, and use no corporal force or punishment: but I
d^nye the whole government of the church to consiste herein, for I have proved
before, and it cannot be denied, but that God has chiefly and principally
committed the gouernmente of his church to the Christian magistrate, by the
sword also, and by convenient laws and orders to govern the same with an
external kind of government: and therefore that which I deny, neither you nor
they have as yet proved, or can prove: that is, that the government of the
church is only spiritual. But still the Reader may note how you labor clean
to shut out the civil magistrate from the government of the church. The civil
magistrate excluded from government of ye church.
For if the government of it be only spiritual (which you labor to pro^e)
then what has the civil magistrate to do therewith? Admonish and exhort he
may not: excommunicate he cannot: and therefore has he by your doctrine no
more to do in the government of the church, which consists in these and such
like spiritual actions, than the poorest subject in this land. For when you
say that the Admonition is far from shutting out either civil government or
external government in the church, you speak Subtle sp^ch of ye Replier.
Governor in the church, not of the church.
subtly in saying in the church, not, of the church, for you confess that
the civil magistrate is a governor in the church, but not of the church, that
is, he governs the common wealth which is contained in the church, but he
does not govern the church. O how simply and plainly you deal.

In the margent over against the. 21. reason, there is this note: It conteyneth
manifest blasphemy as may appear. Ephesians. 1. 17. meaning this saying of the
Bishop to those that are admitted mynisters: Receive the holy Ghost. The place
in that chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians proves no such thing, these be
the words: I cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my
prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory, might
give unto you the spirit of wisdom, and revelation thorough the knowledge
of him. What sequel is there in this argument? S. Paul prayed that God would
give to the Ephesians the spirit of wisdom and revelation through the
knowledge of him: Ergo, this saying of the Bishop ( Receive the holy Ghost) to
those that are admitted into the mynisterie, conteyneth manifest blasphemy.
Such is your usual manner of reasoning.

T. C. Page 175. Sect. 1.
Upon the. 8. leaf, M. Doctor says he sees nothing how the place of the
Ephesians. makes any thing against this manner of speech of the Bishop; (Receive
the holy Ghost) and yet it makes thus much, that for as much as the Apostles
did use to pray that the grace of God might be given unto men, the Bishops
should not use this manner of speech, which conteyneth the form of a
commandment.

Io. Whitgifte,
This is far from proving the words to conteyne a manifest blasphemy. Of

All this is added: Neither is the controversy betwixt them and us as they
would bear the world in hand: as for a cap, a tippet, or a surplesse, but for
greater matters concerning a true ministry and regiment of the Church
according to the word. Which things once established, the other melt away of
themselves: and yet consider I pray you, whether their own argument does not
choke themselves, for even the very name of trifles does plainly declare that
they ought not to be maynteyned in Christ's church: and what shall our Bishops
win by it? forsooth that they be maynteyners of trifles, and trifling Bishops,
consuming the greatest part of their time in those trifles, whereas they should
be better occupied. We strive for true religion and government of the Church,
and show you the right way to throw out Antichrist both head and tail, and
that we will not so much as communicate with the tail of the beast: But they
after they have thrust out Antichriste by the head, go about to pull him in
again by the tail, cunningly coloring it, least any man should epsy his
foot steps, as Cacus did when he stole the oxen.

What other men have done, I know not, but for my part, I always suspected
and partly knew, that some of you had greater matters Great matters pretended
not yet uttered.
in hand, and of more importance than cap, tippet, and surplisse, which surely
was one of the first causes that moved me to be more earnest against you, than
I was accustomed: for I did understand that you were hatching opinions tending
not only to Anabaptisme, but to the overthrow of the Gospel, and disturbing
the quiet state of this church: and yet who knows not that you have made the
cappe, and surplisse your pretense hitherto, until now of late when you see
almost all men condemn your folly.

You say, we choke our selves with our own argument, for even the very name
of trifles does plainly declare, that they ought not to be maynteyned in
Christ's church. Surely of themselves they be but trifles, as all other
external Ceremonies and indifferent things be: it is the circumstances that
makes them no tryfles, but matters of weight: For things indifferent being
commanded thus or so to be used by the Magistrate (not as necessary to
salvation and iussification, but as convenient and necessary for order^ and
decency) be not now trifles. And whosoever without a lawful urgent cause, or
in a case of necessity does break the law made of them, shows himself a
disordered person, disobedient, a contemner of lawful authority, and a
wounder of his weak brothers conscience. And if any man shall say, that this
is to bring us again in bondage of the law, and to deprive us of our
liberty: I answer, no: for it is not a matter of justification but of order:
and to be under a law, is no taking away of Christian liberty. Christian
liberty what it is.
For the Christian liberty is not a license to do what thou list, but to serve
God in newness of mind, and that for love, not for servile fear. Of
themselves therefore they be but trifles, but being commanded by the
Magistrate to be used, or not to be used, they are no trifles, no more than it
was for women to come into the Church bareheaded, or a man to pray having his
cappe on his head, after that S. Paul had made an order to the contrary. And
therefore these scoffs and floutes ( And what shall our Bishops win by it?
forsooth that they be maynteyners of tryfles, and tryfling Bishops, consuming
the greatest part of their time in these tryfles, whereas they should be
better occupied) might with more commendation of your modesty have been well
forborne. They see your doings tend not only to contention but to confusion:
not only to disobedience toward the laws of the Prince, but also to
dangerous errors, yea to the overthrow of Religion: and therefore they are
neither maynteyners of tryfles, nor tryfling Bishops, but wise, discrete,
vigilant, and learned Fathers, which seek to maynteyne peace, preserve good
order, defend the authority of lawful laws, and in time suppress erroneous
doctrine.

You rather spend the time in trifles, when you might be better occupied, for
you (omitting all other necessary points of doctrine, and Inuectiue Sermons.
profitable exhortations to good life) stuff your sermons, and furnish your
table talk with nothing else, but with bitter inuectiues against those rytes,
as though they were matters of damnation, and against those learned and
discrete ministers of the word, who (according to their duty using of them)
seek in deed to beat down Antichrist to plant necessary points of
Religion in men's hearts, and to teach Unfrutefull sermons.

contentious dealyng, reioyseth the Papiste, discrediteth the sound and learned

Magistrates and superiors in the hearts of the hearers, destroys that which
other men build, and finally does good to none. For what fruit can there come
to the hearers, by inueighing continually against Cappe, Tippet, Surplesse,
Ring in marriage, women's white kerchers, baggepipes, funeral sermons, mourning

Upon the ninth leaf he has sundry grievous accusations and charges of
disorder, disobedience, and contempt, against those which refuse the aparel,
and labors to persuade that they are great and weighty matters. But his
proofs were spent before.

Io. Whitgifte.
The proofs that I have here used gawles you shrewdely, and will not be
answered with such disdain: let the learned Reader consider of them, and mark
how well you have spoken for your self.

Answer to the Additions. etc.
Fol. 1.
There is added Portuis, for where before they said that our book of Common
prayers was culled and picked out of that Popyshe dunghill the Massebooke, now
upon better aduisement, they say that it was culled out of the portuis and
Mass book. It derogateth nothing from the book of Common prayers, because
something therein is in the portuis and massebooke, no more than it derogateth
from the scriptures, that some portion of them, as the whole Psalms, and
certain other portions of the Epistles, Gospels, and other Scripture, be in
the same: neither are they allowed because they be in the portuis and
massebooke, but because they be either Scripture, or most agreeable thereunto.

They also add in the first reason, that the coming of women in vayles to be
Churched, is not commanded by law, but yet the abuse to be great, by reason
that superstition is grown thereby in the hearts of many, and other are
judged that use it not. This is an argument of their former rashness, but not
worthy any answer, especially being confessed to be without the book.

For the. 120. Psalm. is now quoted the. 121. Psalm, which I have also
corrected before.

Fol. 2.
For the. 26. of Math. is noted the. 28. And this also I corrected in answering
that place.

Where it was before, and minister a Sacrament, now is added, according to
their appointmente, to what purpose I know not.

There is also added in the same leaf these words: are not the people well
nodified think you, when the homely of sweeping the church is read unto them:

Surely such flouting terms are used of none but of nodies in deed, and such
as are more meet to be fools in plays, where they may jest, tha^ to be
platformers of churches, in whom wisdom, learning, gravity and godliness is
to be required: I know no Homely entitled of sweeping the Church, one there
is of repayring and keeping clean of churches: whether it edify or no, I
refer to the wise and discrete Reader to judge, when he has perused it.

Before it was in yt second reason, for the very name Apocrypha testifies that
they Fol. 3. Apocrypha*
ought rather to be kept close than to be uttered: Now it is, for the very name
Apocrypha testifies that they were read in secret, and not openly: This is
some correction of their former rashness. But of this matter, that is, of
reading Homelies in the Church, I have spoken before. I omit. 2. Tim. 3. verse.
6. which is now verse. 19. and 2. Pet. 1. verse. 20. which is now verse. 19. 20.
21. For these be not matters of any great importance, and they be quoted to
prove a matter not doubted of among us. In the former edition and fourth
reason, it is thus written: In this book we are enjoined to receive the
Communion kneeling, which beside that it has in it a show of papistrie, does
not so well express the mystery of this holy Supper. For as in the old
Testament eating the Paschall Lamb standing, signified a readiness to pass:
even so in receiving it now sitting, according to the example of Christ, we
signify a rest, that is, a full finishing thorough Christ, of all the
ceremonial law, and a perfect work of redemption wrought that gives rest
for ever, and so we avoid also the danger of Idolatry. In the second Edition
these words be thus altered: In this book we are enjoined to receive the
Communion kneeling, which beside that it has in it a show of popish Idolatry,
does not so well express a Supper, neither agrees it so well with the
institution of Christ, as sitting does: not that we make sitting a thing of
necessity belonging unto the Sacrament, neither al firm we that it may not be
received otherwise, but that it is more near the institution, and also a mean
to avoid the danger of Idolatry. Here is the signification Correction.
of sitting (which they before made) clean dashed out, as a thing unadvisedly
before put in. It is also here granted that the Communion may be received
otherwise than sitting, with other circumstances, whereof they have now better
considered. Surely this is a great alteration upon such a sudden: and I would
hardly have been persuaded that these men would so sone have discredited
themselves by their inconstancy. But peradventure the self same had not the
correction of the book which were the first penners of it, and therefore how
they will like of this correction, it may be doubted. But although the words
in the text be altered, yet the quotations in the margent remain still:
Belike they are to be applied as it pleases the platformers.

All this is added in the seventh reason: But some will say that the baptism
of Fol. 4.
women is not commanded by law, if it be not, why do you suffer it, and
wherefore are the children so baptized accordingly? common experience teaches
that it is used almost in all places, and few speak against it: and this I am
sure of, that when it was put in the book, that was the meaning of the most
part, that were the^ present, and so it was to be understood, as common
practice without co^trolement does plainly declare. All these be but
co^iectures. Diverse things be suffered and in many places used without
co^trolment, which notwithstanding by no law be commanded. What the meaning
was of those that penned the book, I know not, neither as I think do you. And
surely for common practice I can say little, but for mine own experience this I
dare affirm, that I have not known one child so baptized in places where I
have had to do, no not since the beginning of the Q. Majesty's reign. I speak
not of the thing it self, but only of your conjectures: I Baptizing by women
not collected out of the book.
think if the circumstances of the book be well considered, it will appear
that the meaning is, that private baptism is rather to be ministered by some
minister (which in ye time of necessity may soonest be come by) tha^ by any
woman. But in this point I submit my judgment to such as better know the
meaning of ye bok? (being pe^ners thereof) tha^ I do. In the same leaf and
ninth reason speaking of certain things used about marriage, they add these
words: With diverse other heathenishe toys, in sundry countries, Toys about
marriage.
as carrying of wheat sheafs on their heads, and casting of corn, with a number
of such like, whereby they make rather a maygame of marriage, tha^ a holy
institution of God. These be but toys in deed, used I know not where, not
contained in any part of the book of common prayers, and therefore without my
compass of defense. They lack matter when they stuff their book with such
vain and frivolous trifles.

In the. 10. reason to these words, ( as for confirmation) is added, which the
Fol. 5.
Papists and our men say was in times past Apostolical, grounding their
opinion perhaps upon some dream of Hierome: And in the same place these words
be left out: We speak not of other toys used in it, and how far it
differs, and is degenerated from the first institution, they themselves that
are learned can witness: And in the place hereof this is inserted, as though
baptism were not already perfect, but needed confirmation, or as though the
Bishop could give the holy Ghost. You your self in effect have confessed in
your first edition, that confirmation of children is very ancient, and that it
has been well instituted, for there you say that now it differs and is
degenerate Confirmation of children allowed at the last.
from the first institution: But upon better aduiseme^t you have left out these
words in your second Edition: as you have also left out these, with other
toys used in it, whereby you confess (contrary to your former sentence) that
the confirmation of Children now used is without any toys. Howsosoeuer it
pleases you to account Hieromes judgment (touching the antiquity of
confirmation) a dream: yet his dream may be of as much credit with wise men,
as your bare denial of the same. The words The end of confirmation.
that you have added in the second place might well have been spared: for you
know that confirmation now used in this Church is not to make baptism
perfect, but partly to try how the godfathers and Godmothers have performed yt
which was enjoined the^ when the children were baptized: partly that the
children themselves (now being at the years of discretion, and having learned
what their Godfathers and Godmothers promised for the^ in baptism) may with
their own mouth and with their own consent openly before the church ratify
and confirm the same, and also promise that by the grace of God they will
evermore endeavor themselves faithfully to observe ^ keep such things as they
by their own mouth and confession have assented unto. And this reason is
alleged among other eue^ in the book of common prayers. And that it is not to
make baptism perfect, ye book of common prayers it self declares in these
words: And that no man shall think any detrime^t shall come to Children by
deferring of their co^firmatio^, he shall know for truth that it is certain by
Gods word that children being baptized, have all things necessary for their
salvation, and be undoubtedly saved.

You add, as though the Bishop could give the holy Ghost: the Bishop may use
the ceremony used by the Apostles, that is, imposition of hands, and may
safely say this godly prayer contained in the book: Defend O Lord this child
with the heavenly grace, that he may continue thine for ever, and daily
increase in thy holy spirit, more and more, until he come unto thy everlasting
kingdom. Ame^. And other such godly prayers there co^teiued. Of any other kind
of giving ye holy ghost, there is no mention in that book, and therefore these
additions might very well have been leftout of your libel. To the end of the
eleventh reason, these words be added, and open our eyes that we may see what
that good and acceptable will of God is, and be more earnest to provoke his
glory: to the which I only answer, Amen.

In the end of the. 12. there is something left out which they have placed in
the. 13. reason: but it is answered before.

There is nothing added or altered worth the noting: only in the Fol. 6.
fiftenth reason, where they said before that we honored Bishops by the titles
of kings: now they have recanted that, and condemned themselves of an untruth,
for they have left out that title. Fol. 7.


In the seventh leaf and 19. reason these words be left out, banners and
belles: which argues that they were before untruly said to be used in gang
week: But to lie, is a small matter with these men.

For Lords grace of York, there is the Archbishop of York. The cause of Fol.

To these things ye Replier has given his consent as it should seem by his

Articles collected out of the former Admonition, and untruly said (of the
fautors of that Admonition) to be falsified.
To the end of the second Admonition there is joined A reprofe of certain
Articles, collected (as it is thought) by the Bishops, (for so they say) out of
a little book entitled, An Admonition to the Parliament. etc. But as I think,
it may rather be termed, a recantation, or (if you will) a reformation or
mitigatio^ of certain articles in that first admonition rashly setdowne, and
without learning or discretion printed.

1. Fol. 3. lib. 1. page 2. First they hold and affirm that we in England are
not yet Scarce the face of a Church.
come to the outward face of a church agreeable to Gods word. Here you find
fault that this word scarce is left out. Indeed this word scarce was written
in the margent of diverse copies of the first Admonition: whether it were so in
all, or no, I know not: no more do I whether any such collectio^ (as you
pretend) was made. But what need you so much stick in words, when the thing
is manifest? for in effect they deny as much as that proposition imports:
they wholly condemn the mynisterie, the ceremonies, and the government of this
church. They say the sacraments be full of corruptions: and in their second
Admonition Fol 42. they say that the sacraments are wickedly ma^gled and
profaned: they utterly condemn our order and manner of common prayer: yea in
effect our doctrine also, for in their second Admonition, Fol. 7 they say, that
although some truth be taught by some preachers, yet no preacher may without
danger of the laws, utter all truth comprised in the book of God. What can
be spoken more slenderly of the doctrine preached in this church? A man may
truly speak as much of the Romish church: for some truth is taught by some
Papists: yea some truth is taught by some Jew and Turk. When therefore you
say, that in this church neither the word is truly preached, nor the
sacraments sincerely ministered, nor yet Ecclesiastical discipline (which three
in the first Admonition Fol. 3. is said to be the outward marks, whereby a
true Christian church is known) and also condemn our mynisterie as Popish and
unlawful, with the whole government of Vix* signifies sometime non.
our Church (as you do in plain terms) may it not be truly said, that you
affirm us in England as yet not to be come to the outward face of a church
agreeable to Gods word? Furthermore what does this word scarce help the
matter, does it not importe as much? it is a rule in Philosophy, Quod vix fit
non fit, that which is scarce done is not done.

T. C. Page 175. Sect. 3. 4. 5.
As for Answer to the Articles collected out of the Admonition, it is made in
the Reply unto M. Doctors book, where I have showed how the Admonition is
misconstrued and taken otherwise, than eytherit meameth or speaks, whereunto
I will refer the Reader.

And albeit I have showed how untrue it is, that the Admonition, affirms that
there is no church in England, yet I can not pass by the secret Philosophy,
whereby M. Doctor would prove, that the Authors of the Admonition affirm it.
For says he by ye rule of Philosophy. Quod vix fit, non fit, that which is
scarce done is not done. I say this is secret, for it was never taught,
neither in Academia, nor in stoa, nor Lyceo, I have read Quod fere fit, non
fit, that which is almost done is not done. But I never remember any such rule
as M. Doctor speaks of.

And besides that in our tongue, those things which are said to be scarce, are
notwithstanding oftentimes supposed to be. As when a man says that there is
scarce a man alive, etc. the scripture also uses that phrase of speech, of
things which are, as when it says, the just man shall scarce be saved, it does
not mean, that just men shall not be saved. The rest of that I have answered.

Io. Whitgifte.
I prove by their own manifest words, that they in deed affirm that we in
England are not yet come to the outward face of a Church agreeable to Gods
word, all which proofs you omit and let pass cauilling only at this word
(scarce,) which is a manifest What y^ word ( vix) imports.
argument of a wrangler. And yet is not this manner of speaking. Quod vix sit,
non sit, so strange Philosophy, as you would gladly have it, for this word
( vix) either signifies with violence, and great difficulty to do a thing: or
else it is referred to the time: or else it signifies ( non) as in Ouide vix
Priamus tanti, that is, non tanti Priamus, as Donatus does expound it. I think
you will not have it to be taken in the first signification, by the Authors of
ye Admonition, for then there is no sense in their words: if it be taken in
either of the latter significations (as it must of necessity be) then the
Philosophy is not secret* but open and known to every young Grammarian.

In our English phrase, it is commonly taken for non, as when we say a thing is
Vix, in english commonly taken for ( non).
scarce done, we signify that is not yet done. Likewise when a man says that
he is scarce well, he means that he is not well. He has scarce made an end
of his sermon* yt is, he has not made an end of his sermon. It is scarce. ix.
of ye clock, that is, it is not yet ix. of the clock. Even so we are scarce

not yet come. etc. Every child yt ca^ speak knows this to be so.

When the scripture says, that a just man shall scarce be saved: this word (
vix) is taken in ye first signification, that is, with great difficulty, and
in this signification it is oftentimes taken in the scripture: but so can it
not be in their manner of speech.

Answer to certain Articles. etc.
2. They will have the mynisters to be called, allowed, and placed by the
people. You say, that this Article is falsified: and yet their words in that
place of their Admonition be these: Then election was made by the common
consent of the whole Church. And a little after: Then no mynister was placed in
any congregation without the consent of the people. Wherefore the collection is
very true, and they belike ashamed of their doings: and therefore they have
corrected these assertio^s in their second edition of the first Admonition on
this sort: Then election was made by the elders, with the common consent of
the whole church. Surely these men be past shame, else would they not deny
their own written assertions.

T. C. Page 175. Sect. 6.
And whereas he says that it is al one, to say that the election of the
mynister must be made by A manifest (...), (...) you leave out this word
(whole.)
the church, and to say, It must be made by the people: it is a great oversight
to make the part and whole all one, seeing ye people be but one part of the
church, and the mynister and the other governors are, albeit not the greatest,
yet the principallest part. I grant that sometimes a part is taken for the
whole, and so we do call sometimes the governors of the church, the church,
and sometimes the people: But where the question is of the propriety of these
speeches (the Church and the people) there all men that have any judgment, can
easily put a difference.

Io. Whitgifte.
What I have said, how truly you have reported my words, and how aptly you
have replied to my Answer, even the very simple Reader may easily understand:
and therefore for answers to this, I shall only desire him to compare our words
together: and then it shall easily appear how you have falsified my words:
for whereas I gather out of these words of ye Admonition, Election was made by
the common consent of the whole Church, therefore their collection is true which
say, that they would have the mynisters to be called, allowed, and placed by
the people, you either of purpose, or by oversight (which is very usual with
you) have left out ye word ( whole) and make as though I should say, that it
is all one to say that the election must be made by the church, and to say, it
must be made by the people: and should confound the people and the church, the
part with the whole: which is a manifest untruth. But by ye way it is to be
noted, yt you seem to separate the people from the election of mynisters, for
you will not have the word ( Church) in the Admonition to comprehend the
people, else why have you these words, when the question is of the propriety
of these speeches, (the church and the people)? and surely it may seem that
this is their meaning, because in their second edition they say the election
was made by the Elders, with the common consent of the people, so that, the
election should be made by the Elders, and the people only should consent to
the election: which is contrary to the rest of your assertion.

Answer to certain Articles. etc.
4. Lin. 9. They hold that a Bishop at no hand has authority to ordeyne
ministers. This Article you confess to be truly gathered: but now you make
this gloss ( not alone) and yet in their Admonition it is in flat terms, that
the ordering of mynisters does at no hand apperteyne to Bishops.

6. Lin. 28. They will have the mynisters at their own pleasure to preach
without license. This is true by your own confession, for you will have no
other license, but your calling to the ministry, which must be (as you say)
by the congregation. Here you shut out both the Princes license, and the
Bishops.

7. Lin. 13. fol. 17. Lin. 6. page 1. Whatsoever is set down in this Article is
manifestly affirmed in the Admonition, and your answer to it is frivolous, and
nothing to the purpose. For in the first part of the Admonition* Fol. 2. page
1. These be the words: In those days known by voice, learning and doctrine:
now they must be discerned from other, by Popish and Antichristian apparel, as
cap, gown, tippet, etc. And in the second part speaking of the apparel
prescribed to ministers, they say on this sort: There is no order in it but
confusion: no comeliness, but deformity: no obedience, but disobedience both
against God and the Prince. Are you not then ashamed to say, that this Article
( They will have the mynister discerned from others by no kind of apparel,
and the apparel appointed they term Antichristian, and the apparel appointed
by the Prince, disobedience against the Prince) is falsified?

Fol. 4. Lin. 1. Page 2. They will have all Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons,
etc. together with their offices, jurisdictions, courts, and livings clean
taken away, and with speed removed. You say that this is falsified in part,
because there is left out Lords grace, Justice of peace, and Quorum, etc.
Surely the Article is truly collected in every point, and plainly affirmed in
the. 2. leaf of the first part of that Admonition. As for your gibing words
that follow, they be but wind: I warrant you the co^futatio^ will abide the
light, and the Author will show his face, which you are ashamed to do.

9. Lin. 9. The Article is truly collected: look in the first part of that
Admonition, Fol. 2. Page 2. and Fol. 3. And in the second part of that
Admonition. Fol. 1. page 2. Fol. 5. page 1.

17. Lin. 12. The collection is true: for their words be these: They simply as
they received it from the Lord, we sinfuily mixed with man's inventions and
devises. And therefore you untruly say, that it is falsified.

19. Lin. 16. They will have no Godfathers nor Godmothers, you say that this
Article is also utterly falsified: what mean you so to forget your sslfe Is it
not thus written in the first part of ye first Admonition, ^o. 3 pa. 2.
Godfathers and Godmothers once disallowed and after reca^ted.
And as for Baptism it was enough with them if they had water, and the party
to be baptized, faith, and the mynister to preach the word, and mynister the
Sacraments. Now we must have surplesse devised by Pope Adrian,
Interrogatories mynistred to the infant, Godfathers and Godmothers brought in
by Higinus, etc? How say you? are not Godfathers and Godmothers here
disallowed? wherefore be they else in this place recyted? or why are they here
ascribed to Pope Higinus? will you now allow any thing in the Church invented
by the Pope? In deed in the second edition of this first Admonition, these
words, Godfathers and Godmothers brought in by Higinus, be clean left out, as
I have before noted. Wherefore either you have not read the diversity of their
editions, or else you are very impudent.

22. Fol 8. in fine. I marvel why you say, that this collection is falsified?
Look Fol. vlt. page 2. of the first part of the Admonition.

T. C. Page 175. Sect. 6.
The rest of those articles are answered in the discourse of the book. Besides
that, the fanlts which are found with the untrue gathering of them, are not
taken away by M. Doctor, but only in confident and bold asseuerations. And if
I should say any thing, I should but repeat their words.

Io. Whitgifte.
The judgment hereof must also be referred to the Reader, who may conjecture,
that you have little to say, against any thing that I have in this part
affirmed.

Out of the second treatise called A view of Popish abuses remaining.
Fol. 10. page 1 lin. 33. Reading of service or Homilies in the church is as
evil as playing on a stage, and worse too. You say that this is falsified. Lord
God what mean you? In the second leaf of that book these be their direct
words, Reading is not feeding, but it is as evil as playing upon a stage, and
worse too. To the same effect they speak diverse times, and so do the Authors
of the second Admonition. Surely either they are ashamed of their doings, or
else you have not with diligence read their books.

Thus briefly to have answered to your unjust accusation of falsely collecting
certain articles out of the book entitled. An Admonition. etc. shall be
sufficient. Other articles which you say be gathered out of the same book, and
confess to be true, I have omitted, because they be sufficiently answered by
me in the confutation: and your confirmation of them is usual and childishe.

I would wish that such as be wise men and in authority, would diligently
consider that which you answer to the Article, Fol 14. (as you quote it)
touching the government of the Church, and the authority of Princes and their
laws: and likewise that which is written concerning the same matters in the
second Admonition: I will make them neither better nor worse, but wish the
Magistrates, well to mark your judgments and opinions in these matters, and
to foresee the worst. The Lord bless this Realm of England with the
continuance of his Gospel, long life of the Queens majesty, and peace both
foreyne and domestical. Amen.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nothing answered.

A view of the second Admonition.
T. C. Page 175. Sect. vlt.
In the view of the second admonition M. Doctor does as it seems of purpose,
cul out those things which he has spoken on before, and in repeating of them,
refers his Reader unto his book. Diverse other matters there are of great
weight which he speaks not of, if he do approve them. Why have you not done
so your self (...) your Reply*
it had been well he had sign fyed his liking: if he do not, that he had
confuted them. And if he traveled so heavily of bringing forth of this book,
that it was as heavy a burden unto him, as Solomon says, a fond word is unto
an unwise man: he might have taken day to answer it. Now by this sle^der
answering or rather not answering at al, but only asking how this and that is
proved (whereas being proved it is unreproved of him) he does his cause more
harm than he is aware of. For unless his profes he joined with his
expulsions, imprisonme^ts, and with all that racket which he makes in
Cambridge, to the utter most of that his authority will stretch unto, he may
be well assured, that their driving out will draw in the truth, and their
imprisonment will set the truth at greater liberty, and thereby prove it self
to be neither Papistrie, nor Anabaptistrie, Donatistrie, Catharisme, nor any
other heresy, which are by due correction repressed. But as for the truth of
God, the more it is laden, the strayghter it stands, and the more it is kept
under, the more it euforceth it self to rise, and will undoubtedly get up,
how great so ever the stone be which is laid upon it.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have omitted no matter of substance unanswered in either of the Admonitions.
The words you here utter be contumelious: you only rail, you answer not. I
never expelled any of degree since my first coming to Trinity College, but
two: the one for pertinacie, the other for perjury. And yet I might have done
lawfully and justly, and intend to do if the statutes whereunto I have
sworn, do thereunto enforce me. But by your often obiecting this unto me, men
may understand what conscience it is that makes you so zealous, and what
divinity it is that you so carnestly profess: scil. a mind full of
reuengment, and a face puffed up with arrogancy and vayneglory.

A brief view of the second Admonition.
I have also received a second Admonition to the Parliament, the author
whereof undertakes to teach how to reform those things which the other
Admonition found fault with. I shall not need to make any long discourse of
it, neither will I. The answer to the first admonition is an answer to this
also. Only I thought it good to note unto you, that this book consists of
these points especially: first it justifies the authors of the first
Admonition, and seems to complain that they have not justice, because they
appealyng to the highest Court of Parliament, their appeal would not be
received. And therefore they say the Scripture is plain, that it shall be
easier for Sodom and Gomorra in the day of judgment* than for such a court,
meaning the court of Parliament, and they quote for that purpose in the margent
the. 10. of Matthew, verse. 14. 15. which is a shameful profanation of the
Scripture, and an egregious slander to that honorable court. The justness of
the appeal I leave to the Justices, and skillful Lawyers to be considered of,
for it is not within the compass of my faculty. Only I think that that
scroule can have no defense of Parliament: first, because it is a Libell:
secondly, because it was published in printe before the Parliament was made
privy unto it.

Io. Whitgifte.
Not one word said against this.

A view of the second Admonition.
In this part these words of theirs would be well considered, Politic Ma
cheuils.
there is no other thing to be looked for, than some speedy vengeance to
light upon the whole land, provide as well as the politic Macheuils of
England think they can, though God do his worste: It would be known whom
they mean by these politic Macheuils: for they envy all men of great
authority, wit, and policy.

T. C. Page 176. Sect. 1. 2.
And albeit he had no leisure to answer the matters which required his
answer, yet he carpeth at by matters, and asks who are meant by the politic
Macheuils.

What if they mean This is a clake, but their words will not hear it.
M. Doctor, and such other, which under the pretense of policy, would
overthrow the Church, and that by those things which have scarce a show of
policy, and in deed ouerturne the policy and government of the Lord. And I
pray you tell me M. Doctor, who be those superiors which contemn, hate,
discourage, and frumpe those which execute the laws of the Realm, of the
which you speak in the. 88. page. And where you add by and by, that they
envy all men of great authority, wit, and policy, I have answered this
speech before. And truly I think there is not in Mesheke so slanderous a
tongue to be found, as this is, nor the Juniper cotesare not comparable with
it.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nay they can not mean it of me, nor of such as I am: for I have not to do
with the politic affairs of this land, neither am I either of Court, or
Parliament. But I think their words following do clearly seclude me, and all
other of my degree, for thus they add immediately: But shut God out of your
assemblies, and (...) as hitherto in this last Parliament you have done nothing
therein as you ought, no though (...) been solicited, but have suffered them
that were your solicitours, to be molested. You shall (...) both that you ought
to have sought the kingdom of God first, and also you shall find, if (...)
consider not your own ways in your hearts, how you think it a time to
build seeled houses, to devise laws for the preservation and prosperity of
your common wealth, and neglect Gods Church, leave that wast. etc. These
words of theirs shuts me out from the number of their Macheuils. Well, it
is a point that would be considered. That which I speak in the. 88. page, I
am ready to give accounte of, when I am thereunto by due authority called.
Neither am I afraid in time and place, to speak that which I think. In the
rest of this Reply you do but utter your impatiencie, and vntemperatenesse of
your speech, and therefore I will dismiss you, as David did Shemei.

A vievve of the second Admonition.
The second part consists only of railing words, and slanderous Slander
(...) the Church of England.
accusations, first against this whole Church of England, for they say, that
we are scarce come to the outward face of a Church rightly reformed, and that
although some truth be taught by some preachers, yet no Preacher may without
great danger of the laws utter all truth comprised in the word of God. etc.
And a little after they add and say, that the truth in a manner does but
peep out behind the screene: which speeches as they be very untrue (for who
knows not that the Gospel is wholly, publicly, and freely preached in this
Church of England) so they be slanderous, neither can the Papists speak any
worse.

In this part also, to prove that this is no true saying in matters of policy
and government, it is not repugnant to the word of God, and therefore it may be
used: is alleged this saying of Christ. Mat. 12. He that is not with me, is
against me. But they have forgotten the words of Christ, Mat. 9. Qui non est
aduersus nos, pro nobis est: He that is not against us, is with us. Whereupon
we may much better conclude, that that which is not repugnant to the
Scripture, is consonant to the Scripture, than they can do the contrary of
the former place. Notwithstanding in both these places (as I think) Christ
speaks rather of men and persons, than of things them selves.

In the same part their speech of the Queens supremacy is very Supremacy
of the Queen secretly denied.
suspicious, and it would be demanded of them what they think in deed of her
Majesty's anthoritie in ecclesiastical matters, for in this poyut they have
hitherto dealt very subtly and closely: notwithstanding their meaning may
easily be perceived of such as diligently consider their books.

Likewise in this part they note certain contrarietics in this Church, as
betwixt the Communion book and Injunctions, touching wafers: the Communion
book and aduertisementes concerning Church vestures: the Canons and the
Pontifical, in not ordering of ministers sine titulo, and such like matters
of no importance, which justify rather this Church, than otherwise: for
surely if they had had weightier matters, they would no doubt have alleged
them. But in these same matters they are much deceived, for as I suppose, in
matters of ornaments of the Church, and of the ministers thereof, the Queens
Majesty, together with the Archbishop or the Commissioners in causes
ecclesiastical, have authority by Act of Parliament, to alter and appoint
such rites and ceremonies as shall from time to time be thought to them most
convenient. To be short, in that point they say, that in things of order one
Church may many times differ from another without offense, following the
general rules of Scripture for order, as in appoynting time and place for
prayers. etc. Which is a very true saying: and flat contrary to all that is
said either Contrariety in these men.
in the first Admonition, or in this second: for if such things may be
appointed in the Church, not being expressed in the word of God, but
depending upon this general rule, Let all things be done decently and in
order. 1 Corinthians. 14. then surely the Magistrate has authority in such
matters, to appoint what shall be thought unto them most convenient, so that it
be not repugnant to the word of God: except you will make this the question:
whether in such matters we ought to be directed by the Magistrates, and
governors of the Church, or by every private Pastor in his several charge.

Io. Whitgifte.
All this is let slip without answer.

The vievve of the second Admonition.
The third part of this book condemns the degrees of Doctors, Degrees in
the Uniuersities condemned.
Bachelors of Divinity, and Masters of Art in the Uniuersities, and
slanderously, untruly, and opprobriously speaks of the Uniuersities, and
such as be in them: presumptudusty prescribing a manner of reformation for the
same, when as I think verily they know not what Uniuersities mean. But here
we may note that they seek to overthrow all learning and degrees of
learning. The same part also very slaunderonsly and unchristianly rayleth on
some Bishops by name, and the rest of the Clergy, charging them most untruly
with sundry things: but because it is done by way of Libelling (a Diuelishe
kind of revenge) therefore I trust godly and wise men will esteem of it
accordingly. Besides slanderous reports, and opprobrious words, there is
nothing in this part worthy the answering.

T. C. Page 176. Sect. 2.
After he accuses the Admonition. as if it condemned schools and Uniuersities,
with all manner degrees, when it does but inueigh against degrees given of
custom rather than of right, rather by money, than by merit of learning, and
when titles of Doctorship be given to those which have not the office of a
Doctor, and oftentimes to those which can not do the office if they had it,
and when men do seek vayneglory in them and such like.

Io. Whitgifte.
Read and mark their words, page. 16. and. 17. and the conclusion they use
(after they have in most bitter manner inueighed against such degrees) which
is this: These vain names become such vain men, but the Church of God they
become not, and are forbidden by our Savior. etc. Their own words be a
sufficient declaration of their meaning, and so is yours uttered before, a
plain proof of your consenting unto Page 173. sec. 1.
them, and condemning of all degrees of Schole, properly perteyning to
Divinity.

A vievve of the second Admonition.
In the fourth part the Author takes upon him to set down A new plat form.
a platform of a Church, to prescribe the manner of electing ministers, of
their exercises, of their equality, of the government of the Church. etc.
Which surely being well considered, (...) appear not only a confused
platform, without any sound warraute of God word, but also a fantastical
devise, tending to the overthrow of learning, religion, yea the whole state
and government of the common wealth.

But because I have before in the confutation of the first Admonition, spoken
sufficiently of all these matters, therefore I will only note one or two
things in this part to let you understand that these platformers build
not upon that foundation that they would have others so strictly bound unto:
for let them tell me upon One minister not to meddle in another man's charge.
what Scripture this is grounded: Let no one minister meddle in any cure save
his own, but as he is appointed by common consent of the next conference, or
Councels Provincial or National, or further (if it may fall out so) general
of all Churches reformed* Or this: That the ministers must be equal, and that
some must be governed by all, and not all by some? Or that, The Pastor or
teacher in every congregation ought to be the Principal of the consistory of
their congregation? Or that, Many parishes may be joined in one, and have one
Pastor, and yet that it is unlawful for one Pastor to have many Parishes? Or
that, In the mean while till preachers increase to furnish the places
unfurnished, upon conference among the learned, some discrete man be appointed
to make some entyer prayer. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
Passed over in silence.

A vievve of the second Admonition.
Or that it is evil so often to repeat, Glory be to the father. etc. Lord
have mercy upon Repetition of prayer is not evil.
us. etc. Or the Lords prayer: for the text which they allege for the same,
Math. 6. is wickedly wrested, and corruptly alleged: for the words of Christ
be not (as they translate them) when you pray* use not vain repetitions, but
when you pray, use not much babbling: whereby not the often repetition of good
prayers, but vain babbling in prayers, that is, many words without faith, and
the inward affection of the mind, is forbidden. Paul. 1. These. 5. says,
Pray continually, And Christ Matthew. 6. says, Pray on this manner, Our father,
etc. So that of necessity we must oftentimes repeat the Lords prayer, if we
will believe Christ and his Apostle Paul. But Lord what strange doctrine is
this, to call Glory be to the father. etc. Lord have mercy upon us. etc. Our
father. etc. Popish? Surely these men (as I suppose) be not well in their wits.

T. C. Page 176. Sect. 3.
For the repetition of Gloria patri. etc. I have spoken sufficiently before:
but what spirit is it that calls this translation of the word (...) (use
not vain repetitions) a wicked wresting of S. Mathewes place in his sixth
chapter? what rasor is this that cueteth so sharp? Knows he against whom,
and against the excellent learning, and singular piety of how many he
^eaketh? For this is the translation of those learned and godly men, which
translated the Bible. which is commonly called the Geneua Bible: and is this a
wicked wresting? Admit it were not translated exactly, to the word of the
Evangelist: is it therefore a wresting, and a wicked wresting? (...) hat (I
will not say wicked) but false conclusion or doctrine can be grounded of this
tr^nslation? And they that translate it thus, have not only the authority of
the Lexicons to confirm their translation, w^ch show that this word was
taken up in reproach of a foolish Poet called Battus, which used to repeat
one thing many times: but they have also the circumstance of the place to
warrant it. For the reason which our ^auiour Christ uses to draw men from this
faul^, leads to this translation, and can not stand with that sense which M.
Doctor sets down. For how hang these together: you shall not babble many
words without faith. etc. because your heavenly father knows what you have
need of before you ask? It is unlike first, that our savior Christ would
speak thus (babble not many words without ^ayth. etc.) when as rather he would
have forbidden them to speak any one word without faith. etc. For if he
should speak thus, he should seem to have allowed a prayer without faith, so
that it were not conceived in many words. And again, if (as M. Doctor says)
this had been the proposition, which our savior Christ diswaded from, that
they should not babble many words without faith. etc. he would never have added
this reason (for your heavenly father knows. etc.) for neither is he father
unto any such. And he would rather have said as S. James in the first chap.
says, that they should be sure to receive nothing, because they ask not in
faith. Now as this reason can not stand with M. Doctors interpretation: so
does it well ag^ee with the translation of the Geneua Bible. For what could be
more fitly said to drive the disciples from this vain repetition, than to say
that the heavenly father knows. etc. and that it is not with the Lord as it
is with men, that must have a thing oftentimes spoken, or ever they can
understand it? Furthermore what a reason is ^his: we must repeat ye Lords
prayer oftentimes, therefore we must repeat it oftentimes in hal^e an hour,
and one in the neck of an other? And if S. Paul's place to the These. (pray
continually) be referred unto the saying of the Lords prayer (as M. Doctor
would bear us in hand) then it is not lawful for us to use any other words,
than those which our savior Christ used. But I could never yet learn that
those words bind us of necessit^e any more unto the repe^tion of the Lords
prayer word for word, than unto the repetition of any other godly prayer in
the scripture. And I would be loathe to say that it were simply necessary, to
use that just number of words, and neither more nor less any time, much
less oftentimes in so small a space. For our savior Christ does not there give
a pre^cript form of ^rayer whereunto he vindeth us: but gives us a rule, and
squire to frame all our prayers by, as I have before declared. I know it is
necessary to pray, and to pray often. I kn^we ^lso that in so few words it is
impossible for any man to frame so pithy a prayer: And I confess that the
Church does well in concluding their prayers with the Lords prayer: but I stand
upon this, that there is no necessity laid upon us to use these very words,
and no more, and especially that the place of S. P^le to the Thessalomans,
does least of all prove it. As for M. Doctors outcries he has so often worn
our ears with them, and that without cause, that I think by this tunc no man
regards them.

Io. Whitgifte.
I do not say that so to translate the place is a wicked wresting or corrupt
alleging of it: but this I say, that that place is wicke^ly wrested, and
corruptly alleged (...) inter^reted. Beza.
by the Adm^nition, to improve the often rep^titien of the Lords prayer. Neither
do I think that translation to be so apt, as the other is. M. Beza in his
notes upon this place of S. Mat. says thus: Ne sit is loquaces (...), be not
full of words. Vulg. Nolite multum loqui, do not babble much. Erasmus. Ne
^itis multiloqui, id est, (...) quo id^m declaratur. Longae tamen preces hic
non damna^tur, sed quae vanae sunt, inanes and super^titiosae. Longa enim non
est oration in qua nihil redundat: centra vero breuis esse non potest, quae non
proficiscitur ex ^nimo pio and fideli: Be not bablers or full of words, that is
(...) whereby the same thing is signified: yet are not long prayers here
condemned, but those that are vain, fond, and superstitious. For it is not a
long prayer, wherein nothing is to much: on the other side it can not be short
which proceeds not out of a godly and faithful mind.

And that this is the true interpretation of this word (...) it appears
Erasmus.
by that which follows in the same place, (...) for they think to be heard
for their much babbling. Upon the which words Erasmus gives this note: Hic
non est (...) sed proprio vsus est verbo (...), veluti exponens quid dixerit
(...): Here is not the word (...), but he uses the proper word (...), as it
were expounding, what he mente by (...). You see therefore that the one word
expeu^deth the other, which is the surest way of interpreting. M. Calvin upon
the same place says thus: Porro eoru^ stultitia^ reprehendit Calvin.
Chris^us, qui vt Deu^ persuadea^t and exorent, multum verborum profundunt.
Furthermore Christ reprehendeth their folly which do spend many words, that
they may persuade and Nou^ gl^ssa.
entreat God. And noua glossa ordinaria does interpret the word in like
manner. Ferunt Bat tum quendam fuisse in^ptum Poeta^, qui multis and vanis ad
nauseam vsque repetitis verbis Batt^s a ba^ (...).
poemata sua conscripserit, ad hoc vnum int^ntus vt multus esset in verbis:
vnde sumptum sit verbum Battologizare, pro inaniter esse multiloquum. It is
reported that there was a certain fooly she Poet called Battus, which wrote
his verses with many and vain repeting of words, even unto the lothing of any
man, being only bent unto this one thing, that he might have many words: of
whom this word Battologizare was taken, for him that is full of vain words.
By all which authorities and interpretations of these learned me^, Christ does
not speak against the often repetition of the Lords prayer or any other godly
prayers, but against vain babbling in prayers, and multiplying of words
without faith, whether it be by often repeating or multiplying of them. And
therefore also says M. Martyr, Quare at^e^dendum Martyr in 1. Sam. 1. Babbling
in prayer what it is.
est multiloquium tum adhiberi non cum diu precamur, sed cum citra fidem and
spiritum verbamultiplicamus: wherefore it is to be marked, that then is there
much babbling, not when we pray long, but when we multiply words without faith
and spirit. Neither is there any writer that does otherwise interpret this
place, not even those that translate it vain repetitions.

And the reasons whereby you would overthrow this sense be words only and not
reasons: Long o^yer ^r repetitions net (...), but babli^ of worde^ (...) our
fayt^. Math. 26.
for who can think yt Christ does here condemn long prayers or many words,
or the repetition of godly prayers (himself continuing in prayers a whole
night in the mountain, and oftentimes repeating one and the same prayer, not
long before he suffered his passion Math. 26 and willing us to pray
continually, and not to be weary?) But that only he forbids many words
without faith, whether it be as I said by multiplying or by repeating: but what
should we dally where the words of Christ be playne^ for he says, Verum
orantes ne sitis multiloqui ficut Ethneci: Putant enim fore vt ob multiloquiu^
suum Luke. 18.
exaudiantur, Ne igitur efficiamini similes ^storum, nouit enim pater vester.
etc. But when ye pray use not much babbling as the Heathen do, for they think
that they are heard for their much babbling: be ye not therefore like unto the^:
for your father knows whereof you have need Math. 6.
before you ask of him. The words be manifest, all interpreters agree upon
t^e^: and therefore this your dallying is but a profanation of them.

If we repeat the Lords prayer twenty times in half an hour, so it be done
in Christ uses repetition of ye same prayer. Math. 26. verse. 44.
faith and zeal, it is not this multilo quium or vain repetitions that
Chris^e speaks of in this place. Christ himself as I have said before,
repeated thrice one prayer in the same words as it is evident Math. 26. which
he would not have do^e if ye faithful and zealous repetition of prayers, had
bin this much babbling or vain repetitio^s, where of he speaks in this. 6. of
Math. I do not say that the place of S. Paul. 1. These. 5. is to be
understood only of the Lords prayer, but this is my saying, that for as much
as we are commanded to pray continually by S. Paul in that place, and the
Lord has said when ye pray, pray on this manner, Our father which art in
heaven. etc. Therefore the often repetition of this prayer being in faith and
zeal, can not be accounted vain repetition or much babbling. I know it is
lawful to use other godly prayers, besides it, neither have you ever heard me
utter one word to the contrary: I know likewise that it is not only a prayer
to be used, but also a rule to be followed in framing all our other prayers by,
whatsoever. And yet a prayer it is, and a necessary prayer to be used, as the
very words of Christ do declare.

A vievve of the second Admonition.
These and a number of other phansies they have in this book which they can
not ground upon any scriptures, but by wringing and wresting of them: and in
deed their seeking is, to have all things framed according to their fancies,
that they may be accounted planters and platformers of churches.

I omit this that the author boasts, that he and many others will set the^
selves against us, as the professed enemies of the church of Christ: For the
matter is not great, neither shall they in that point dea^e an^ otherwise with
us, than the Anabaptists, (...), (...) ^ther H^e likes have dealte with other
Churches. This shall be sufficient for an answer to y^ book, because all other
matters of substance are by me answered before in the former co^futatio^.

Io. Whitgifte.
Nothing answered, neither is this proclamation of defense solued.

A brief answer to certain Pamphlets spread abroad of late.
I have of late received three little Pamphlets, the first as it were a preface
to the other two, the second entitled, An exhortation to the Bishops, to deal
brotherly with their brethren: The third, An exhortation to the Bishops and
their clergy to answer a little book that came forth the last Parliament,
and to other brethren to judge of it by Gods word, until they see it answered,
and not be carried away with any respect of men.

The preface consists of these points especially: first by diverse examples
it is there declared, that the wicked and ungodly of this world, could never
away with such as would reprove them for their manifest sins and ungodliness.

Secondly, that this is the cause why these two treatises which were lately
written and imprinted in the last Parliament time. etc. were of so many
misliked, and the authors thereof so cruelly entreated and straightly imprisoned
etc.

Thirdly, it raileth on the bishops and such as be in authority, comparing
them to false prophets, and to Phariseis. etc. Last of all it co^cindeth with
threatening, that if they go forward in their sins, their doings shall be with
more bitterness of words, and plainness of speech thrown into their faces.

The first is nedelesse, for who knows not that from time to time it has bin
the manner of such as were desperately wicked, not to suffer their sins openly
to be reproved. The second is false, uncharitable, and slanderous, for the
cause why the books be not esteemed (especially of the wise and learned) is the
untrue doctrine contained in them, maintained with untrue and v^apt allegations
of the scriptures, and enterlaced with opprobrious terms and railing speeches
tending to the disquietnes of the church, and overthrow of true religion. The
authors thereof to be imprisoned, not for telling any man of his sins, but for
writing libels against this whole church of England, against the book of
common praer, against the ministry, against ye sacraments, finally against the
whole form and government of the church by the whole consent of this Realm
established, and according to the rule of Gods word. And with what face can you
say that they be imprisoned for telling men of their sins? where ever read
you or heard you, that any of the Prophets or Apostles told men of their
sins by libels? Surely Libelling is no true way of reforming.
that kind of dealing is not for the Apostles of Christ, but for the
ministers of Satan.

T C. Page 177. Sect. 1.
^here he says the authors of the Admomtion are not punished, or their book
misliked, for that it tells of the faults in the church. or of the sins of
men, but for yt it mainteineth false doctrine, and for that they preferred a
libel: for the doctrine, it appears by that which is said, what it is. And if
he would define what a libel were* it were easy to answer unto the other
point. If he mean because it was preferred without any name unto it, how will
he answer Forsoo^h, (...) you make ^ wicked comparison.
to the example of S. John in ye Apocalips, who reprehend^ng the ministers o^
diverse churches* did not A manifest untruth.
put to his name unto his book. And to the writer of the Epistle unto the
Hebrews* which was a singular instrument, and did not subscribe his epistle,
wherein notwithstanding he sharply rebukes diverse faults amongst the^. And yet
S. John nor the writer to the Hebrews were not the ministers of Satan. And if
he call it a libell, because it uses some sharper speeches, surely all men see
that his book deserves then to be called a Satyr, having for tart words,
bitter, and for one, twenty. But in what respect soever he calls it a libell,
he accuses not so much the authors of the Admonition for preferring of it, as
diverse of the honorable house of Parliament, which did allow it.

Io. Whitgifte.
The comparison is very unequal and odious, that you make betwixt the holy
books of the Scripture, indicted by the spirit of God, and reputed and taken as
portions of the canonical scriptures, wherein only we have to seek the
doctrine of salvation: and these railing, rude, uncharitable, and unlearned
Admonitions. And yet in the one of them, that is in the Revelation you are
foully ouershot, for the name of John sets his name to the Apocalips both in
the beginning and end.
the author of that book is expressed three times in the first chapter, and
that with such circumstances that it cannot well be doubted who the author was,
though you would cavil about the multiplicitie of the name. Likewise his name
is expressed in the latter chapter of the book: wherefore you were not well
advised when you set it down that S. John in the Apocalips did not put his
name to his book. He says in the. 1. cap. in the first verse, Seruo suo
Iohanni, and in the. 4. verse Ioannes. 7. ecclesijs quae sunt in Asia, and a
little after. Ego Ioannes frater vester. etc. and in the last chap. Ego Ioannes
qui audiui and vidi haec. The epistle to the Hebrews has no opprobrious and
slanderous words in it, neither does the author thereof seek to defame or
deface any body, as the authors of the Admonition do.

If my book be comparable to either of the Admonitions in sharp and
uncharitable speeches, prove it unto me by comparing them together, and surely
I will like the worse both of my book and of my self: and confess that I have
offended. Although I might excuse my self in saying that I have done it in the
defense of the truth, and vendicating this Church of England from such
intolerable slanders, as they burden it with.

If any of the honorable house of Parliament did consent to the publishing of
it in that manner and form that it was published (which I am sure they did
not, as you undutifully and untruly charge them) I will not excuse them: and
yet they cannot be said to be either the authors or the publishers of it:
neither can their allowing of it, excuse it from being a libell, being not
orderly in Parliament propounded, but disorderedly (I might say seditiously,)
spread abroad in corners to the defamation of this whole state and Church of
England, not to any reformation.

But to satisfye your desire that would so gladly know what a libell is, I will
tell A libell what it is.
you in few words. An infamous libell is that, that is written in verse, or in
prose, to yt infamy and slander of any man, to y^ which the author dare not set
his name. This is an infamous libel, and it most aptly agrees to y^ book
called an Admonition to ye Parliament: So that by this definition your
objection also of ye book of ye Apocalips, and of the epistle to the Hebrews
is soon answered: for all those books are not libells which are published
without the authors name, but those which are published to the infamy or
slander of others, to the which the authors dare not set their names.

An answer to certain Pamphlets.
The third comes of the same spirit that the second does, that is, The
libellers fitly compared to the Pharisees.
of the spirit of arrogancy and malice: for it compares godly, wise, zealous
and learned bishops to idolatrous Priests, and to Pharisees: but indeed the
conditions and qualities of the Phariseis do most aptly agree with ye authors
of these Libels, and their adhere^ts: for the Pharisees did all that they did,
to be seen of men, and sought the comme^dation Description of a Pharisie.
of the common people, as appears Math. 6. and. 23. and so do they: The
Pharisees when they fasted disfigured their faces, and these walking in the
streates, hang down their heads, look austerely, and in company sigh much,
and seldom, or never laugh: the Pharisees strayned out a gnat, and swallowed
down a camel. And these men think it an heinous offense to wear a cap or a
surplisse, but in slaundering and backbyting their brethren, in railing on them
by libels, in contemning of superiors, and discrediting such as be in
authority: to be short, in disquieting the Church and state, they have no
conscience. The Phariseis separated themselves from the common sort of men, as
more holy, and contemned the poor Publicanes as sinners: And therefore some
learned interpreters think, that they be called Pharisaei, quasi segregati,
quod vitae sanctimonia, a vulgi moribus and vita separati essent, non aliter
Fost^rus in dictionar. hebraico.
atque monachi, quos Chartusianos vocant. They be called Phariseis as separated
and divided from the common sort in holiness of life, much like unto the Monks,
which be called Carthusians. And Josephus says that they were called
Phariseis, because they seemed to be more holy than other, and more Lib. 1 cap.

cap. 3.
cunningly to expound the law. Also he says this to be one property of
theirs, that whatsoever their own reason persuades them, Id sequuntur
pertinaciter, that they stubbornly follow. Again he says that they be astutum
hominum genus, arrogans, and interdum Regibus quoque infestum, etc. A subtle
kind of men, arrogant, and sometimes enemies to kings and rulers: These men
separate themselves also from the congregation, and will communicate with us
neither in prayers, hearing the word nor sacraments: they contemn and despise
all those that be not of their sect, as polluted, and not worthy to be saluted,
or kept company with: and therefore some of them meeting their old
acquaintance, being godly preachers, have not only refused to salute them, but
spit in their faces, wishing the plague of God to light upon them, and saying
that they were damned, and that God had taken his spirit from them, and all
this, because they did wear a cappe: wherefore when they talk of Phariseis,
they pluck themselves by the noses. But Lord, what a strange time is this,
when such as they be, dare thus boldly publish libells against their superiors
for mainteining and executing good and godly laws.

The conclusion of this preface is a stout, presumptuous and malapert
threatening, in my opinion, not to be suffered: But howsoever your pen and
tongue walks, yet I pray you hold your hands, or else. etc.

T. C. Page 177. Sect. 1. 2.
Whereas M. Doctor compares us with the Phariseys, and says we do all to be
seen of men, and that we hold down our heads in the streates, and strain at
a gn^t swallowing down a Camel, because they are in all men's knowledge, I
will leave it to them to judge of the truth of those things. Where he says we
seldom or never laugh, it is not therefore that we think that it is not
lawful to laugh, but that the considerations of the calamities of other
churches, and of the ruins of ours, with the heavy judgments of the Lord
which hang over us, ought to turn our laughing into weeping, besides that a
man may laugh although he show not his teeth. And so Jerome Jerome ad Marcell*
in effect answers in an epistle which he wrote, where upon occasion that
certain used the same accusation that M. Doctor does, he says, because we do
not laugh with open mouth, therefore we are counted sad.

And where he says we separate our selves from all congregations, and are
ennimies to prince, and that we would seem to be holyer tha^ other, these and
such like slanders are answered before. And if there be any that refuse to
salute godly preachers, or spit in any man's face, or wish the plague of God to
light upon them, or say that they be damned, we defend not, nor allow of any
such behauioure. And it is unreasonable that the fault of one, should be
imputed to so many, and to those which do as much mislike of it as M. Doctor
himself. And what needed M. Doctor to bid the authors of these exhortations to
hold their hands, where do they in a word offer to strike? Belike his tongue
is his own, and therefore he speaks whatsoever he lists.

Io. Whitgifte.
I show how much more aptely the qualities and conditions of the Phariseys
agree to you and to your sect, than they can do to such as the authors of
those pamplets call phariseys.

I know you can both laugh, jest, and give, when you are among your selves, and
so could the Phariseys do: but I speak of your behauior in open places, and
before such as do not so well know you. It is unlike that you mourn for the
ruins or calamities of any Churches, seeing that you seek with might and
main the confusion of this, by stirring up schisms and contentions in it.
That which I speak of separating your selves from the congregation. etc. is
well known to be true, in a number of you: and the contemptuous behavior of
some of you (pretending most zeal) toward some of us, argues what spirit
you are of, and what your zeal is, even that that Zuinglius does charge the
Anabaptists with, when he says, Ira est non spiritus quo se venditant.

The answer to certain Pamphlets. etc.
In this portion entitled An exhortation to the Bishops to deal brotherly
with their brethren: there is no great matter contained worthy of answering,
only the author does excuse himself, for taking upon him that exhortation, and
moves the Bishops to deal brotherly with the authors of the Admonition.
First, because they be their ^rethren: secondly because they ought first to
have discovered unto the world by the word of God, how truly or falsely they
have written. Thyrdely, because they do but disclose the disorders of our
Church of England, and humbly desire a reformation of the same, according to
the rule of Gods word. etc. Fourthly, that Papists lie abroad in their dioces
untouched. etc. Fifthly, that many lewd light books, and balades fly abroad
printed, not only without reprehension, but Cum priuilegio.

Likewise in ye same book the author seems to justify the Admonition, and
to condemn the lordship and authority of Bishops, ascribing thereunto the stay
and hinderance of their pretenced reformation: charging them after a sort with
mangling the Scriptures of God, and with snaring the godly with such laws as
were purposely made for the wicked. These be the principal contents of that
book.

The first reason, that is, That they be their brethren, might as well be
alleged Brethren may be punished.
for the impunitie of Anabaptists, Arrians, and such like, who pretend the
sincerity of gods word, and would be counted brethren: yea it might as well be
alleged for many other malefactors, who be also brethren, and yet must not
therefore escape unpunished for their offenses. Shall not the Prince and the
magistrate execute laws upon such as break them, because they be their
brethren in Christ? Beware of such doctrine, and let not affection in private
men's causes carry you headlong into public errors. But I think you are in
this point deceived, for howsoever we account them our brethren: yet they
account not us their brethren, neither will they acknowledge us so to be, as
some of them both in open speech and manifest signs have declared. And
therefore when the Bishops deal with them, they deal with such as disdayn to
be called their brethren.

T. C. Page. 177. Sect. 3.
After M. Doctor confuteth his own shadow, for the exhortation does not
require that the name of a brother should deliver the authors of the Admonition
from punishment, if they deserved it, but desi^eth that it might work some
moderation of the rigor of it, and compassion to minister to their
necessities in prison. He says that the authors of the Admonition, take not
them for their brethren, yes verily, although unbrotherly handled, and for
fathers too, and so both love them, and reverence them, until (which we hope
will not be) they shall manyfestly for the vpholdi^g of their own kingdom and
profit, refuse to have Christ to reign over us, in whom this fatherhoode
and brotherhoode does consist.

Io. Whitgifte.
Let the readers judge whether it be one of their reasons or no: let them also
consider that which I have before alleged out of the second Admonition, page
35. and then tell me whether they take us for brethren, or no.

Can you so well please your selves in your own platform, yt except we admit
it, we refuse Christ to reign over us, I trust he has reigned over us
hitherto, and shall do to the end, though your platform be sunk to the
bottom of the sea.

An answer to certain Pamphlets.
To their second reason I answer, that I think they have bin talked with, and
heard what they have to say for them selves, but their hautie minds and good
opinion conceived of themselves, will not suffer them to see their errors. In
this reason you allege nothing for them, but that which may also be alleged
for the Papists, or any other sect of heretics. But it is an old saying, Turpe
est doctori etc. How happens it that they themselves have first defamed, not
the Bishops only, but also this whole Church of England with public libells,
before they have used brotherly and private conference? This is to epsy a
moate in an other man's eye. etc.

How true the third reason is, may appear in my answer to their Admonition,
but how true soever it were, yet their disordered disclosyng, by unlawful
means, (that is, by libelling) deserves as much punishment as hitherto they
have had: for the truth needs no such ungodly means of disclosyng.

If Papists go abroad unpunished, when by law they may be touched, surely
it is a great fault, and can not be excused, and I pray God it may be
better looked to. But this is no good and sufficient reason for the impunitie
of other: Because some Papists be not punished, shall therefore no disordered
persons be punished? Or because some in authority wink at some Papists, shall
therefore no laws be executed toward any offenders? Surely touching malice
against the form and state of this our Church, I see no great difference
betwixt them and the Papists, and I think verily they both conspire together.
The same answer I make to your first reason: shall no book be suppressed
because some be not? It is a fault I confess, to suffer lewd Ballades and
Books touching Ballets.
manners. But it were a greater fault to suffer books and Libells, disturbing
the peace of the Church, and defacing true religion.

Concerning the titles and offices of Bishops, I have spoken sufficiently
before.

In manglyng and wrestyng of the Scriptures, none offend so much as do the
authors of the Admonition, who in that point are comparable to the Papists, as
may be seen by the learned and diligent Reader.

If they whom they term godly do willingly offend against such laws as were
made for the wicked, they are to be punished according to the laws, neither
are they to be spared because they pretend Godliness bre^keth no law.
godliness: for there is no godliness in breaking of laws.

The third scroule, called, ( An Exhortation to the Bishops and to their
Clergy to answer a little book. etc.) is satisfied (I trus^e) for I have
(as it is there required) answered the short and peeuishe Pamphlet (as they
term it) I have disclosed their double and corrupt dealing, their wringing of
the Scriptures to serve their turn, and have declared the true sense and
meaning of the^: I have not bumbast^d it with rethorike, but in plain and
simple manner uttered my judgment, according to ^ uncient fathers contemned o^
^ned men.
the true meaning and sense of the Scriptures: notwithstanding I have in
sundry points declared the use of the Church of Christ in times past, and do
use the testimony of ancient Councels and learned fathers, which these
unlearned men unlearnedly contemn, a thing not heard of in any age or Church,
nor allowed of any learned man, but only of certain heretics, and especially
Anabaptists. To be short, I have not answered the book by pieces, but wholly.
Howbeit I must desire them to pardon me, for not making more speed with my
answer: their frivolous quotations so troubled me, and my other business,
that I could no sooner make an end of it. In all the rest of that deryding
Pamphlet, there is nothing of any moment, Augustine recor^ed upon the abu^tsary.
worth the answering. Therefore as they allege this portion of a sentence
taken out of S. Augustine in his Epistle ad Vinc^n. Si terrerentur and non
docerentur improba quasi dominatio videretur, If they should be feared and not
taught it might seem a wicked governance: so I con^lude with the other part of
the same sentence: Si docerentur, and non terrerentur, vetustate consuetudinis
^bdurarentur, and ad capescendam viam salutis pigrius mouerentur: If they
should be taught and not feared, in time they vvoulde vvaxestubburne, and bethe
hardlier moved to imbracethe way of salvation.

T. C. Page 177. Sect. vlt.
I know not whether they have been conferred with or no, but I think the first
reason which they had to persuade them, was that they should go to Newgate*
which is that which the Exhortation co^^layneth of after, that they are first
punished before they be taught. And in this beh^lfe M. Doctor has no cause to
complain as he does. For if he list he may learn or ever he go to prison.

Io. Whitgifte.
If they were so sent to that place, it was a meet reward for such disorderly
dealing, for ignorance may not excuse Libellers, if they libell but against a
private man, much less should it excuse them, slaundering in that manner this
whole Church and realm. I doubt not but that I shall learn to know my self,
and to do mydutie whilst I am out of prison, so that I shall not justly for
lack of duty and honesty deserve it.

T. C. Page 178. Lin. 2.
And as for the truth of the cause, and wresting and mangling of the
Scriptures, in most places where they are said to mangle and wrest, and how he
has answered the r^quest of the Exhortation, which is, to confute the
Admonition by the Scriptures, and how truly, ^ptly, and learnedly, M. Doctor
has behaved himself, in citing of the old Councels, and fathers: I leave it to
be esteemed, partly of that which I have said, and partly by the deeper
consideration of those, which because they can better judge, may see further
into M. Doctors faults-and rapfodyes than I can Although the truth is, that I
have because I would not make a long book, by heaping of one reprehension upon
an other, contented my self rather to trip, as it were, and to pass over with
a light foot, the heads and sums of things, than to number the faults,
which are almost as many as there are sentences in this book, more I am sure
than there are pages.

Io. Whitgifte.
I have confuted both them and you, according to the gifts and grace that God
has given me, with such authorityes both of Scriptures and other learned
Auth ours, as is fit to be used in the decyding of such controversies. And I
am well assured that you have not omitted the least blot in my book: and for
the most part you have feyned (against your own knowledge) those to be which
are not. I refuse no man's judgment of my dealing with the old Councels and
fathers, that is learned and will speak without affection what he thinks.
Your hyperbolicall conclusion or figure of lying, where with you close up your
book, I am well used unto, and therefore it does nothing trouble me, but
remains as a certain note of the spirit that possesses you, which is the
spirit of untruth.

THus have I, (according to that talent that God has committed unto me)
endeavored my self to defend the state of this Church of England, and the
orders and rites therein by publyke authority established, against the
slanderous libelles of certain unquiet persons, and this uncharitable reply
of T. C. If either I have omitted any thing, that might have been uttered (as
I have omitted many things) or not so fully answered every point, that all men
thereby may be satisfied, namely such as will be satisfied with reason, I doubt
not but that there be a great number of singular learning and knowledge which
will fulfill my want. The which I do desire them most heartily to do, even for
the love that they have to the peace of the Church: and not to suffer so common
and weighty a cause, to rest only upon one man's shoulder, so far inferior
to so many of them in all respects. The contrary part cease not to lay their
heads together, and to make it all their cases, which would more evidently
appear, if their might were according to their will. Therefore seeing that we
like and allow of the state, let us not suffer it to be defaced unjustly, and
without either learning or truth. And if it shall please the contrary part to
answer this my defense, then do I require no other thing of them, than the
self same, which the Author of the Reply has required of me, and the which I
have accordingly performed, that is, that they set down my words, and answer
me wholly: which unless they do, they shall not only with all wise men greatly
dis^redite themselves, and show the lack of truth to be on their side: but
also ease me of some pains: for I purpose not to answer Pamphlets, nor to
spend the time in confuting frivolous Libels. The Lord grant that my labors
may work that effect that I desire: that is, peace in the Church, and true
obedience in the hearts of the Subjects.

Amen.
An examination of the places cited in the end of the Reply touching matters
in controversy.
T. C.
ACcording to my promise made in my book, I have here set down the judgment of
the later writers, concerning these matters in controversy between us. VVherin
because I love not to translate out of other men's works whereby I might make
mine to grow: I have kept this moderation, that I neither set down all the
writers, nor all their places that I could, nor yet of every singular matter:
But the chiefest writers, and either of the chiefest points, or else of those,
wherein they are alleged against us by M. Doctor, and one only place of each
(as far as I could judge and chose out) most direct to that wherefore I
have alleged it. For otherwise if I would have spoken of all the points, and
of the judgment of all the writers, and gathered all the places that I could,
they would have been sufficient matter of an other book as big or rather
bigger than this. I must also admonish the Reader, that I have forborne in
certain of these titles to set down the judgments of M Beza. M. Bullinger
and M. Gualter: because they are comprehended in the confession of the
Churches. And thus partly upon those sentences which I have alleged in this
book, and partly upon these testimonies here set down: I leave to the
consideration of all men, how truly and justly it is said, that the learned
writers of thesetimes (one or two only excepted) are against us.

Io. Whitgifte.
Surely it had been more commendable in mine opinion, if you had set down
the very words of the Authors themselves, rather than your own collections
upon them: for so should their judgments more plainly have appear^, whereas
now you frame them as they may best serve for your purpose. It is no shame for
a man to translate out of other men's works, especially using their
testimonies: but it cannot be void of great reproach, for any man so to be
addicted to his own persua^on, that he should so lightly regard other men's
opinions.

I doubt not but that the Reader will conceive by these authorities that you
have here collected as chief, principal, and most evident for the
confirmation of your assertions, upon what slender pillars your building
stands. For truly (so far as I can gather) most of these places make
little for your purpose, and none of them enforce any such necessity as you
seem to urge, as it will fall out in the examination of them.

T. C.
1 That there ought now to be the same regiment of the Church, which was in
the Apostles time.
The confession of the Heluetian, Tygurin, Berne, Geneua, Polonia, Hungary,
and Scotland with others, in the 18. chapter speaking of the equality of
Ministers says, that no man may justly forbid to return to the old
constitution of the Church of God, and to recei^e it before the custom of man.

Io. Whitgifte.
The confession in that place, speaks not one word of having Seniors in every
Parish: neither yet of any other Seniors than those that be Ministers of the
word and Sacraments, for the whole chapter entreats of such.

Moreover it says not that we ought to return to that old government, but
that we may return: so that it is from your purpose, and makes more against
you than with you. For the question is not whyther we may return to that ^
ynde of government or no, if it seem good to the Christian Magistrate to whom
God has now committed the government of the Church, but whether the Christian
Magistrate ought of necessity to receive that kind of government, and no
other: which this confession does no where affirm.

T. C.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book. 3. chapter, and. 8. section,
speaking of the ancients which did assist the Pastors in every Church, says
that experience teaches that that order was not for one age, and that this
office of government is necessary to all ages.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin in that place shows what has been, and what may be in the
Church, but he does not make that kind of government so necessary that it
can not be altered. His meaning is, that that kind of government is necessary
for all ages, because in every age the Church in one place or other is in
persecution: but he no where says (as I remember) this kind of government to
be necessary in all states of the Church, nay he affirms the direct
contrary in the same book the seventh chapter, and. 15. section. Where he
speaking of the government of the Church, says thus: Scimus autem politiam
pro varietate temporum, recipere, imo exigere varias mutationes. We know that
the government of the Church (according to the diversity of times) does
receive, yea, require or exact diverse alterations.

T. C.
And in the. 12. chapter and first section of the same book, says as much of
Excommunication and other Ecclesiastical censures.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Calvin shows in that place, how necessary discipline is in the
Church, which is not denied: he speaks not in that section of any thing now
in controversy.

T. C.
Peter Martyr upon the third to the Romans, teaches that although the
common wealth change her government, yet the Church always keeps hirs still.

Io. Whitgifte.
Let the Reader peruse that place, and he shall perceive how cunning you are
in counterfeiting. For M. Martyr speaks there only of the laws of God
which be immutable, and shows that therein the Church of God does differ
from a common wealth, because the common wealth does often change her laws,
but the Church does not so, and he means such laws as be of the essence,
and being of the Church, and are of faith and of salvation. He speaks also of
the inward and essential form of the Church, not of the external and
accidental form of it, which is now in question, and of the spiritual
government, not of the external government. Certain it is, that no law of God
(not being personal or temporal) is to be altered. But I require to have that
law set down, which establishes this form of government for the which you
now contend.

T. C.
Bucer in his first book of the kingdom of Christ the. 15. chapter,
lamenteth that there were found amongst those which are counted of the
forwardest Christians, which would not have the same discipline used now,
that was in the times of the Apostles, obiecting the differences of times, and
of men.

Io. Whitgifte.
There is nothing in that chapter that makes any thing with you, or against
me: for who denies, but that the discipline that Christ has appointed ought
to be maintained and kept in his Church: our question is of the manner of
executing it, of the persons, and of certain other circumstances, whereof M.
Bucer in that chapter speaks not one word: and that the Reader may
understand how you seek to delude him, I will recite the words of M. Bucer
in that chapter, wherein he comprehends all that which is spoken in the same
chapter touching this matter. Out of all these testimonies of the holy
Scripture concerning Christ's kingdom, they that believe the word of God
shall easily understand, that what soever Christ the Lord bath commanded us
and appointed, the same to bring a sure and great help to our salvation, if it
be so observed as be bath commanded and appointed it: and that in all ages
howsoever men and times do vary: neither can we wittginly for any cause
intermitte or neglecte any of them, but we must therewith refuse and despise
Christ himself, and his whole kingdom. All which I grant: and they touch
not any thing now in controversy. Surely these be but slender testimonies to
prove that there ought now to be the same regiment of the church, which was
in the Apostles times, if you speak of the external regiment, which only is
now in question.

T. C.
2 That one minister ought not to have any dominion over an other
The foresaid Heluetian confession. etc. in the seuententh chapter says,
that Christ did most severely prohibit unto his Apostles, and their
successors primacie, and dominion, and in the eightenth chapter says, that
equal power, and function, is given unto all the ministers of of the Church,
and that from the beginning no one preferred himself to an other, saving only
that for order, some one did call them together, propound the matters that were
to be consulted of, and gathered the voices. etc.

Io. Whitgifte.
The words of the confession in the. 17. chapter be these: truly Christ is
present with his Church, and is a living head, who straightly forbad his
Apostles, and their successors, to challenge the primacie or supremacy in the
Church. This the confession speaks of such primacie and supremacy, as the
Bishop of Rome does challenge over the whole Church, for in that place it only
speaks of the Popes usurped authority, and not one word of that
superiority among Ministers which is now in controversy.

That which the confession affirms in the eightenth chapter makes nothing
against any superiority allowed in this Church of England, for we
acknowledge that there is one equal power and function of al Ministers, but
yet superiority also to be among them for order sake, and the same does the
Confession acknowledge in plain and manifest words, even in this place by you
alleged: whereby also that distinction is verifyed which you seem so greatly
to mislyke, to wit, that there is an equality of all Ministers of Gods word
quoad ministerium, touching the ministry, but degrees and superiority among
them, quoad ordinem and politiam, touching order and government.

T. C.
Musculus in his common places, in the chapter of the offices of the ministers
of the word says, that in the Apostolic Church, the ministers of the word
were none above another, nor subject to any head, or president, and mislyketh
the setting up of any one in higher degree than another: And further he says
upon the second chapter of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians, that the
honor of a Bishop, being taken from the rest of the ministers, and given to
one, was the first step to the papacy, howsoever in other places he speaks
otherwise.

Io. Whitgifte.
Musculus in those words of his common places, speaks of superiority quoad
officium and potestatem, touching office and power, (for these words does he
use) he speaks not of superiority touching order and policy, which is
now in question. The same power is in all ministers of the word of bynding,
losing, and administering the Sacraments, but not of governing in the external
policy of the Church. Moreover Musculus in that place speaks chiefly of the
usurped power of the Bishop of Rome, and of that authority which his Bishops
do chaleng and clai^e, from him, wherefore that place may not be wrested
against the lawful jurisdiction and superiority that is now used in this
Church of England.

Upon the second chapter of thee second Epistle to the Thessalonians, he
only shows how the Pope came to such excessive authority. No man doubts
but that such things as were well instituted and upon just considerations, may
by process of time abused: but does it therefore follow, that they may not be
restored to their right use again? A man might then much more strongly reason
against your equality, which by sufficient trial (as by Jerome in sundry
places it may appear) is proved to have been, and to be the cause of
schisms, sects, contentions, seditions, tumultes, murders, confusion of
Churches and commonweals. etc. Nothing is so well instituted but it may be
abused.

T. C.
3 That the election of Ministers, perteyneth not to one man.
The foresaid Heluetian confession, etc. in the eightenth chapter says, that
the ministers ought to be chosen of the Church, or by those which are lawfully
deputed of the Church, and afterward ordained with public prayers.

Io. Whitgifte.
This makes against you: for the confession allows that election of
Ministers which is made by those that are appointed to that office in the
Church: (for these be the words of the Confession) but our Bishops are
appointed to that office in this Church, therefore the Confession allows
Bishops to elect Ministers. The words that follow, that they should be
ordained with public prayers, is observed in our Church.

T. C.
M. Calvin in his fourth book of Institutions. 3. chapter. 15. section,
shows that the Church did choose, and that the Apostles did moderate the
election, and confuteth them which upon the places of Titus and Timothy
would prove, that the election belongs to one man.

Io. Whitgifte.
To this place of M. Calvin I have sufficiently answered in the third
treatise of election of Ministers, chap. 7. the. 1. division.

T. C.
4 That there ought new to be Elders to govern the Church with the Pastors,
and Deacons, to provide for the poor.
Touching Elders, the judgment of M. Calvin has been before declared in the
first of these propositions.

Io. Whitgifte.
And in the same place have I answered, that which is there by you alleged out
of M. Calvin.

T. C.
M. Beza in his book of Divorces page. 161. says, that the Eldership of the
Church ought to be where there is a Christian magistrate.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Beza does not say in that place, that the Eldership of the Church ought to
be where there is a Christian Magistrate, but that it may be: and that it has
been, which he only speaks and proves not. And yet if he mean that
Presbytery whereof the Canons speak (by him only in generality named) then
is it no other than we have at this day in this Church of England, in
Cathedral Churches and Colleges, for in the Canons presbyterium signifies
nothing else, but a College or company of Priests and Ministers of the word
and Sacraments, as I have further declared in the. 17. Tract. where I have also
showed, that M. Beza his opinion is that the government of the Church may
admit alteration, according to the diversities of times, place, and persons.
cap. vlt.

T. C.
Touching Deacons, M. Calvin. 4. book. 3. chapter. 9. section, after that he
had discribed what Deacons the Churches had in the Apostles times, says that
we, after their example ought to have the like.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Caluines words be these: En quales habuerit diaconos Apostolica ecclesia,
quales ad eius exemplum habere nos conueniat. Behold what Deacons the
Apostolical church had, even such as it is convenient we should have,
according to that example. He does not say that we ought to have them, but
that it is convenient to have the: he does not make them necessary but
convenient: and he must be understood to ^ke of that Church whereof he had
experience, not of this Church wherein he was (...) a stranger. Of Deacons,
and that their office was not only to provide for the poor, but to preach
also, and to baptize, I have proved Tract. 19. and Tract. 14.

T. C.
M. Beza in the. 5. chap. and. 23. section of his Confessio^s shows that the
office of the distribution of the goods of the church is an ordinary
function in a Church lawefully constituted, which office in the. 30. he
calls the Deaconship.

Io. Whitgifte.
In neither of these does M. Beza so tie providing for the poor to Deacons
that they must by them be provided for, and by no other: he only shows what
was done in this case in the Apostles time, and in the times immediately
following: but there is neither Scripture nor any learned writer that teaches
that the poor may be by no other provided for, than by Deacons. You prove that
which no man denies, and speak not one word of the matter in question, that
is, whether of necessity the poor must be provided for by Deacons and not
otherwise.

T. C.
Peter Martyr upon the. 11. to the Romans, speaking of the Elders, which did
assiste the Pastor in every Church, and of the Deacons, lamenteth that this
order is so fallen out of the Church, that the names of these functions do
scarce remain.

Io. Whitgifte.
That which Peter Martyr speaks in that place, is spoken generally of all
that the Apostle had before written touching the public ministers of the
Church, and therefore you do unjustly restrain it only to Elders and Deacons.
It may euidentlye appear that M. Martyr makes there a comparison betwixt the
gouerranent of the Church of Christ in the Apostles time, and the government
of the Popes Church in his time, as his words following declare, for thus he
adds immediately. In stead of these, they have brought in Taperbearers,
Acoluthes, and Subdeaco^ which with their light and stagelike gestures, serve
at their superstitious altar. So that you can not gather of this place that
your Seigniorie is perpetual, and must of necessity for ever remain in the
Church.

T. C.
M. Bucer in his first book of the kingdom of Christ, for the ancients of
the Church says, that the number of the Elders of every Church ought to be
increased according to the multitude of the people, and in the. 14. chapter of
the same book says that this order of Deaconship was religiously kept in the
Church until it was driven out by Antichriste.

Io. Whitgifte.
It had been well to have noted the chapter out of the which you gather that
first saying of M. Bucer, howebeit, the matter is not great, for the question
is not whether the number of the Elders of every Church ought to be increased
according to the number of the people, or no, in such places where this kind
of government is admitted: but whether this kind of government must of
necessity in all Churches and at all times be put in practice. I do not
remember that M. Bu^er any where affirms that. In deed in the fifth chapter
of the first book (speaking of these Seniors,) he says: Tales sane possunt
cum administris doctrinae and Sacramentorum Christi disciplinam exercere. etc.
Such may exercise the diseipline of Christ with the ministers of the word and
Sacraments. etc. He says they may do it, not that they ought to do it.

That which M. Bucer speaks of the Deaconshippe in the 14. chapter, is not
denied, but he nowhere says that the poor must of necessity he provided
for by Deacons, and by none other: and he teaches in the same chapter, that
mo things apperteyned to the office of the Deacon than to provide for the
poor: as namely to assiste the ministers in the administration of the
Sacraments and exercising of discipline.

What sufficient proofs these be to induce that necessity of the kind of
government so greatly urged by you, let the learned Reader judge.

T. C.
5 That excommunication pertayneth not to any one man in the Church.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book, and 11. Chapter, and. 6. Section,
teaches that excommunication porteyneth not to one man, and that it was to
wicked a fact that one man taking the authority which was common to other, to
himself alone, opened a way to tyranny, took from the Church her right,
and abrogated the Church Senate, ordained by the spirit of Christ. And in
the. 12 chapter and. 7. Section, he says further that it ought not to be done
without the knowledge and approbation of the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
We grant that no one man ought to take that unto him self which does not
apperteyne unto him: but I have proved Tract. 18. that excommunication
pertains to Bishops, and that this Church of England has consented there
unto: wherefore M. Ca^uine speaks against that excommunication which the
Pope violently and tyrannically usurps, and not against this which our
Bishops in this Church of England, both by the laws of God and consent of
the Church exercise. I speak of the thing it self and not of the abuse.

T. C.
M. Beza in his confessions 5. chapter. 43. Section, says, that this power of
excommunicating is given to no one man, except it please God to work
extraordinarily.

Peter Martyr upon the first to the Corinthes and fifth chapter, says that
it is very dangerous, to permit so weighty a matter as excommunication to
the discretion and will of any one man. And therefore, both that tyranny might
be avoided, and this censure execeuted with greater fruit and gravity, that
the order which the Apostles there uses is still to be observed.

Io. Whitgifte.
To M. Beza and M. Martyr, I answer as I did to M. Calvin: and yet M. Martyr
seems to expound him self in the same place where he speaking against the
committing of this authority of excommunicating to the Pope or to one Bishop,
and refelling this saying of the Papists, Episcopum esse totam ecclesia^
virtualiter, when as they be rather tora ecclesia vitialiter, as he there
affirms, he adds by and by, de malis haec intelligas and tyrannice
agentibus: Understand this of evil Dishops and such as deal tyrannically:
whereby he declares that he speaks against the committing of this discipline
to evil Bishops and such as use it tyrannically.

T. C.
M. Bucer of the kingdom of Christ. in the. 1. book and. 9. chapter says,
that Saint Paul accuses the Corinthians, for that the whole Church, did not
cast out of their company the incestuous person.

Io. Whitgifte.
The question is not whether the whole Church may have to do in
excommunication or no, but whither the consent thereof is al times therein to be
required. What the meaning of the Apostle is in that place to the Corinth. I
have declared. Tract. 15.

T. C.
6 That Chauncellours, Commissaries, Officials. etc. usurp authority in the
Church which belongs not to them.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book. 11. chap. 7. Sect. speaks against
the office of Officials, and alleges diverse reasons against them, as that
they exercise that part of the Bishops charge, and that they handle matters
which perteyne not to the spiritual jurisdiction.

Io. Whitgifie.
M. Calvin in that place alleges no reasons at al against those offices, only
he says that they exercise that part of the Bishops charge, and that they
handle matters which perteyne not to the spiritual jurisdiction, (this I say)
he speaks, but he does not prove it. In the rest of that Section, he
entreats of the abuses of such officers, wherein I do not dissent from him.

T. C.
M. Beza in hs book of Divorces, proving that the judicial deciding of
matrimonial causes apperteyneth unto the civil magistrate, says that
Officials, Proctors, end Promoters and in a word all the swinish filth, now of
long time has wasted the Church.

Io. Whitgifte.
I understand not by what reasons M. Beza in that place proves that the
judicial deciding of matrimonial causes apperteyneth to the civil
Magistrate. Howbeeit., Officials etc. in such cases deal not in this Church of
England without the consent and authority of the civil Magistrate. It is not
good dealing to apply those things which M. Beza and other speak of such
offices abused under the Pope., to the same offices now reformed under a
Christian Prince that professes the Gospel: But thus you dazell the peoples
eyes.

T. C.
Peter Martyr upon the. 13. Chap. to the Romans, speaking against the civil
jurisdiction of Bishops, does by the same reason condemn it in their Deputies
the Officials.

Io. Whitgifte.
Peter Martyr speaks not against the office, but against certain abuses in
the officers: this is not simple dealing to transfer that to the office, that
is spoken of the abuse of the office.

T. C.
7 That the Ministers of the word ought not to exercise any ^ill offices and
jurisdiction.
M. Calvin in his institutions. 4. book. 11. chap. 9. Sect. brings diverse
reasons to prove that Bishops may neither vs^rpe, nor take (...) given them,
either the right of the sword, or the knowledge of civil causes.

Io. Whitgifte.
The reasons that M. Calvin uses there, be neither many, nor greatly strong.
I have answered them fully. Tract. 23. and yet M. Calvin speaks only of
that princely power, which the Romish Bishops claim, not as committed unto
them by the Prince and and civil Magistrate, but due unto them by the word of
God, from the which challenge I have showed in the foresaid treatise, how
far our Bishops are.

T. C.
M. Beza in his Confessions Chap. 5. Sect. 32. says that the Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction is to be distinguished from the civil, and that although the
Bishops in the times of christian Emperors were troubled with the hearing of
civil causes, yet they did not that by any judicial power, which they
exercised, but by a friendly entreaty of the parties, which were at discord:
and says notwithstanding, that herein the Emperors did give to much to the
ambition of certain Bishops, whereupon by little and by little afterward all
things were confounded. And in the. 42. Section says that those corporal
punishments which the Apostles exercised were peculiar and extraordinary.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Beza his bare word is no sufficient proof against so many other
testimonies and reasons as are to the contrary, and I have sufficiently showed
Tract. 23. cap. 3. Diuis. vlt. that Bishops in times past did not only hear
civil causes, but also iudicially determine the same. Touching the corporal
punishments which the Apostles exercised, M. Beza in his book de Haereticis a
magistratu puniendis, does make them so ordinary that he uses them as
sufficient arguments to prove his purpose, and says plainly that the Apostles
did exercise these punishments, not by the right of the Ecclesiastical
ministry, but by the right of the civil Magistracy. as I have declared
Tract. 23. Cap. 3. Diuis. 12.

T. C.
Peter Martyr upon the. 13. to the Romans, speaking of this meetings of both
Ecclesiastical, and civil jurisdiction in one man, says that when both the
civil, and Ecclesiastical functions do so meet, that one hinder the other,
so that he which exercises the one cannot minister the other.

Io. Whitegifte.
M. Martyr speaks of an absolute jurisdiction civil, such as the Pope
claymeth, and not of this which is practiced by the Bishops in the Church of
England, whereof he had experience in the days of King Edward even in this
realm, and the which he also then allowed.

T. C.
M. Bucer upon the. 5. of Matthew, says, that there is no man so wise, and
holy, which is able to exercise both the civil, and the Ecclesiastical power,
and that therefore he which will exercise the one, must leave the other.

Io. Whitgifte.
I answer as I did to M. Martyr, for he also allowed that civil jurisdiction
that the Bishops in England did exercise in the time of King Edward.

T. C.
8 That the Sacraments ought not to be privately administered, nor by women.
The foresaid confession: C. 20. holds that baptism ought not to be
ministered by women or midwyues, to the which also may be joined the Liturgy of
the English Church at Geneua, which condemns the ministering of either of the
Sacraments in private houses, or by women.

I^. Whitgifte.
These be needless proofs, and yet are there learned me^ of the contrary
judgment. ^ow beit, no man says that women may baptize ordinarily, or that
the Sacramonts may be administered in private places, otherwise than upon urgent
occasion: and in that respect no learned man does condemn the ministering of
the Sacraments in private places.

T. C.
Peter Martyr upon the. 11. chapter of the. 1. Epistle to the Corinthes, in
describing the corruptions of the Lords Supper, notes this to be one, that
the Church did not communicate altogether, which corruption as it was in
diverse places in times past, so he complayneth that it is now.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Martyr in that place speaks against private Masses, and the complainte
that he makes, is concerning them, wherein we fully agree with him: neither
do we like or allow of such as withdraw themselves from the Lords table
when the Supper is celebrated. You never love to rehearse the authors words
(because they make not for you) but gather collections of your own, contrary
to the meaning of the author, as you do in this place, which the Reader shall
easily perceive, if it will please him to read M. Martyr himself, in that place
by you quoted. And surely it is too great injury, to wreste that to the order
of celebrating the Communion allowed off in this Church of England, which he
or any man else speaks against pryuate Masses, but such are your deep and
profounde collections.

T. C.
M. Bucer in his first book of the kingdom of Christ, and. 7. chapter proves
out of the 10. to the Corinthes, that the whole Church should receive the
Supper of the Lord together, and that the use of the Church of God in this
behalf, ought with great and diligent endeavor to be restored unto the
Churches, and that it is a contempt of the mysteries not to be partakers when
they are called.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Bucer speaks nothing in that place (touching this question) where unto I
agree not: he would have the Communion ministered in the public congregation,
and who denies that? except it be upon occasion of sickness. etc as I have
before declared: he would have all or the most part that be present to
communicate, and who defends the contrary? and yet if they will not, the
rest may not be secluded: his whole drift is to reprove such as will not
communicate, and not to prohibit the distribution of the Supper to those that
be willing, be they more, or be they fewer, so that there be a competent number,
that it may be a Communion.

T. C.
M. Beza against VVestphalus, shows that it is not decent, that baptism be
ministered but in the Church, and that at standing hours, and by the ministers,
and further, that upon no necessity (as it is called) it ought to be ministered
in private houses. And that if it might be ministered in private houses, yet not
otherwise than by Ministers.

Io. Whitgifte.
You untruly report M. Beza his words: he only shows in that place what
the order of the Church is, where he remains, he does not prescribe any
certain rule for all Churches, neither is it meet that he should, in such
cases. He so speaks of baptizing in private houses, that he does not simply
condemn it. But what soever his judgment is in that point, his mind is not (I
am sure) to bind all other Churches to the same, which think and teach as
soundly of this Sacrament, as he does, or can do, though they agree not with
him in all circumstances.

T. C.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book chapter. 15. sect. 20. 21. proves
that baptism ought not to be ministered by private men, or by any women.

Io. Whitgifte.
Only ministers of the Church are ye ordinary ministers of baptism, neither
may any other challenge that function unto themselves ordinarily, but yet if
upon occasion a private person do baptize, the baptism is good and lawful,
even as the circumcision was true circumcision that was ministered by Sephora.
As I have proved. Tract. 9. cap. 5.

T. C.
^ The judgment of those late writers touching ceremonies and apparel, whose
secret Epistles M. Doctor alleges, appears by these places following,
cited out of their works printed, and published by themselves. Whereof also some
are alleged by the answerer to the examiner, where are diverse other places to
this purpose, whereunto I refer the Reader.
M. Bucer upon the. 18. of Mathewe, says, that they say nothing which do
always object, that greater things must be urged, than the reformation of
ceremonies, thereby defending the relics of Antichrist, for as much as
ceremonies are testimonies of Religion: And that as there is no agreement
between Christ and Belial, so those which are sincere Christians, can abide
nothing of Antichrist.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Bucer says truly: for the reformation of ceremonies is to be sought and
not to be neglected, neither can sincere Christians abide any thing of
Antichriste, as it is Antichrists: but what is all this to the purpose? is
there no reformation of ceremonies in this Church of England, from the which
all Antichristian ceremonies are abandoned, and those that remain purged from
al opinion of Antichristianitie? And that M. Bucer meant nothing less than the
ceremonies now retained in this Church of England (as we use them) it may
evidently appear by that which I have alleged out of him. Tract. 7. cap. 5.
the. 5. division. and chap. 7. division. 4.

T. C.
Peter Martyr upon the. 10. chap. of the second book of the Kings says, that
the Lutherans must take heed, least whilst they cut off many Popish
errors, they follow Iehu by reteining also many Popish things. For they
defend still the real presence in the bread of the Supper, and Images, and
Vestiments. etc. and says that religion must be wholly reformed to the quick.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Martyr names the Popish things which the Lutherans observe, to be the
real presence, images, all the Popish apparel which they used in their Mass,
(for so does he mean) which this Church has refused. What his opinion is of
this apparel, that we retain, I have declared tract. 7. chap. 5. the. 4.
division. where he of purpose speaks concerning the same. God be thanked,
Religion is wholly reformed, even to the quick in this Church.

T. C.
Bullinger in his Decades. 5. Book, and ninth Sermon says, that our Savior
Christ and the Apostles used their accustomed apparel in the Supper, and that
although in times paste the Ministers put on a kind of cloak upon their
common apparel, yet that was done neither by the example of Christ, nor of
his Apostles, but by the tradition of man, and that in the end, after the
example of the Priests apparel in the old law, it was cast upon the
Ministers at the ministration of the Supper. But (says he) we have learned
long ago not only that all Leuiticall ceremonies are abrogated, but also that
they ought to be brought again into the Church of no man. And therefore seeing
we are in the light of the Gospel, and not under the shadow of the law, we
do worthily reiecte, that Massing Leuiticall apparel.

Io. Whitgifte.
Neither do we retain the massing Leuiticall apparel, but that apparel only
which Bullinger himself allows of in diverse Epistles written of purpose,
touching these matters, as I have expressed, Tract. 7. Chapter. 5. the. 6.
Division. etc.

T. C.
Gualter upon the. 21. of the Acts among others, brings this for one reason,
to improve Paul's shauing of his head, for that the Gospel had been preached
twenty years: and that therefore the infirmity of the Jews ought not to
have been borne with. And after he says, that that teaches how much the
superstitious Masters of ceremonies hurt the Gospel, which nourishe the
weakness of faith by the long keeping of ceremonies, and by their long bearing,
hinder the doings of those ministers, which are more fervent.

Io. Whitgifte.
M. Gualter in these words says nothing against any point of this Church: he
speaks truly and nothing to your purpose. M. Gualter has sufficiently
showed his opinion in these matters, not only in written Epistles, but in
printed books, as in his Epistle before his commentaries upon the first to the
Corinthians.

Surely, there is no such weight in these authorities for your purpose, that
you can take any great advantage of them: indeed your cause in my opinion
has won small credit by alleging of them.
