To the woorshipfull, and virtuous young Gentlevvoman, mistrisse Iayes Aston,
daughter to the right woorshipfull Sir Edward Aston knight.
MY very good cosyn, if I should follow the fancies of some writters, who are
accustomed in their dedycations, to glorify the parties whom they have chosen
to be patrons of their works, with many strained words and far sought for
phrases, then in seeking to praise your beauty. I should borrow colors for
your cheeks, from lillyes and red roses, for your lips cheryes: and pearls,
for your teeth, to figure forth your chastyty, wit and many other graces, I
must seek out Diana, Pallas, the Muses and diverse other helps both divine and
precious, and thus whilst I might be curious in blasing the perfections of your
body, I should utterly forget the beauty of your soul. Let this then suffice,
your beauty is not borrowed, and therefore without blemish; your body comely
neither bumbast nor bolstered, and therefore not helped by art, for the gifts
and qualities of your mind as they are many, so they are such as may well be
said to be both virtuous and godly: and now affyenge my self in your
courtious acceptaunce, I have made bold to present you with this historye, The
adventures of Brusanus* read it at your leisure, and what you mislike leave it
and blame me, or blame it and chide me, and you shall see that your gentle
rebuke shall be of importance, either to make me recante and so to ask
mercy, or otherwise to satisfye for my miss as it shall please you to inioyne
me: I have sought to shun indecent terms, vnfytting for your modesty, and
now commending altogether to be censured by your curtesye, I can but wish you
that happiness that your own virtue does worthily merit.

Your loving Cosyn who wishes you all happiness, Barnaby Rich,

The adventures of Brusanus Prince of Hungaria, pleasant for all to read and
profitable for some to follow, written by Barnaby Rich seven or eight years
since, and now published by the great entreaty of diverse of his friends.
The first Chapter.
Myletto King of Hungaria had a son and a daughter, the son called Brusanus
the daughter Leonida.

AT that time when the most renowned Liberius governed the empire of
Constantinople holding the parts of Cayre Soria, Calypha, and all Grecia in the
most christian and catholic faith, at that very instant there reigned likewise
in Hungaria ye noble king Myletto a prince of such justice as he never thought
him self privileged in being a prince, nor did measure greatness by any thing
but by goodness. This prince was so favored and fostered up by fortune, his
estate so established with honor, so beautified with wealth, so decked with the
diadem of dignity, and so endued with fortunate prosperity, that he ^^med to
want nothing which either fortune or the fates might aforde him, so that he was
honored with the sacred titles of good, just, merciful, with many other like
virtuous additions: But as the vices of children are swords which pass through
ye hearts of their parents, so the happiness of Myletto was greatly surcharged
with this heaviness, for having to wife a lady called Paulina, by birth royal,
by nature fair, by education learned, and by virtue mous, by this lady Myletto
in the prime of his years had two children, the one a son called Brusanus,
the other a daughter named Leonida* so perfect in complextion, so pure in
constitution, so adorned with outward beuty, and so endued with inward bounty,
as her very countenance was full of bashfulnesse, love and reverence. Brusanus
on the other side, was so contrary to his sister (though not in state of body,
yet in the stay of his mind) as it made al men marvel how two so contrary
stems could spring of a self same stock, yet his parsonage was most comely,
every lineament gallantly proportioned, his face and countenance sweet and
amiable, with an intising louelines to as many as did behold it: But in the
quality of his mind, he was so spotted with voluptuousness so nusled in
wantonness, so given over to licentiousness, so linked to wilfulness, and so
carried away with all kind of wickedness, that neither the fear of god, the
displeasure of his parents, the sundry admonitions of his careful and loving
friends, nor the regard of his own honor could make him desiste, or drive him
from this detestable kind of life: the day he consumed in such riot, excess,
dronkenesse, dicing, gaming, swearing and swashing, as whole millions of gold,
were insufficient to maintain the expenses of so witles prodigality: the night
he spent in masking, mu^ming, dancing, banqueting and hooring: do you think
then there wanted ruffians, roysters, flaterers, brokers, bawdes, and such
other like to follow him? O no be sure there will be to many counterfaites to
imitate the natural vice of princes but the good king his father having many
times wasted his wind in fruitles exhortations to his son, being still gauled
with this continual grief, fearing that after his death, his sons
lascyuious life would be the overthrow of his house, the consumer of the
kingdom, the wrack of the common weal, and the very man that should bring
the state to mischeife and misery, determined either to cut of the course of
his living or of his life, thinking it better to want a son, then never to
want sorrow, having so gracious a daughter to whom he might leave the
inheritance of his crown, in whose issue the kingdom might be made more
happy: but first determined to seek all other possible means. He caused his
son to be sent for, to whom he said as follows.

The second Chapter.
The fatherly exhortation of Myletto to Brusanus.

CAlling to mind ( Brusanus) first the royal race from whence thou art
descended, the virtuous education wherein thou have been nurtered, the sundry
wholesome precepts where with thou have been instructed: with the lewed and
shamles demeanure wherein thou art daily nusled, as I can but lament thy
misfortune, so I must more wonder at thy follye, and yet the more I think, the
more cause I have of thinking and the less hope of thy amendment. Have thy
friends hoped so long for a plentiful harvest, and now shall be constrained to
gather weeds, have thou from thy youth been trained up in learning, and after
thou have given a good soape to the payle, thou should kick it down
curstly with thy heels, O how much better had it been for thee never to have
rypened, then so soon to have rotted: thou see ( Brusanus) my white heaires
are blossoms for the grave, and thy fresh color, fruit for time and fortune,
so that it behooves me to think how to die, and for thee to care how to live: my
crown I must leave by death, and thou enjoy my kingdom by succession: it is
then requisite for thee so to fortify thy mind with strong reasons, grave
sentences, and learned precepts of wisdom, that thy weak seeds of virtue be
not drowned in the floudes of vain delights: For as the prince being the head
of his people, and most excelent of all: he must therefore by his good example
be a pattern to al. What honor is it for a prince, to go far beyond the
common sort in precious stones, beaten gold, coulloured silcks, and great
trains of servants, when he shall be inferior to all in virtues and honesty
of life: For to instruct his people by precepts, is a long and difficult way,
but to teach them by example, is very short, and of greater efficacy, for
where they shall see virtue after a lively sort imprinted in a visible
pattern, and that the princes life is such an example, they become wise of
their one accord, then is force, constraint or threatening, needless to bring
them to their duty: O consider my son the difference between a virtuous king
and a vicious prince, the one strives to enrich his subjects, the other to
destroy them, the one spares the honor of good women, the other triumphs in
their shame: the one takes pleasure to be freely admonished, the other
misliketh nothing so much as wise and virtuous council: the one makes great
acompt of the love of his people, the other is better pleased with their fear:
the one is never in doubt of his own subjects, the other stands in awe of
none more then them: the one burdeneth them but as little as may be upon
public necessity, the other gnaweth the flesh from their bones to satisfy
his vain pleasures, the one in time of war has no recourse but to his
subjects, the other keeps war but only with his subjects: the one is
honored in the time of his life and mourned for after his death: the other is
hated in his life with perpetual infamy after his death: A crewell prince
will make a slaughter house of his common wealth, a hooremaister will make it a
stews, a prodigal will suck the marowe of his subjects, to glut some half
dosine flattering parrisites, that will be about his parson, disguised in the
habit of fidelity: A good prince must not dedicate the common wealth to him
self, but must addicte him self to the common wealth, and because no man
asks account of him in his life, he ought to be so much the more stirred up
to demand a streighter rekoning of him self: be must live as it were upon an
open Theater where he is seen on every side, so that his life will be a
discipline and instruction of good or ill living unto others, therefore let him
seek to excel those whom he rules and to surmount them as far in virtue,
as he surpasses them in riches and honor. But what is to be hoped for from
that prince, that only accompanies him self with curtesans, flatterers,
drunckards, diceplaiers, dauncers and inuenters of pleasures, breiflie in the
midst of such caytiffes amongst whom he learneth nothing but pleasure,
delight, pride, vanity and such other. Why should thou make such account of
the beauty of thy body, which having enclosed in it the soul which is
defiled with ougly vice and monsterous sin, is nothing else but a proud
sepulcher under which is contained a stinking and putrified carrion: Forsake
such vain delights ( Brusanus) and let virtue be thy guide if thou will
attain to happy honor. For For honor is the only reward of virtue* and
only virtue must open the gates of honor.

The Romans builded two temples joined to gether, the one being dedicate to
virtue the other to honor: but yet in such sort, as no man could enter into
that of honor, except he first passed through that of virtue, which is the
only thing whereof all the greatness, glory and honor of men depends, and not
in the dignity wherein they are placed: A small want to brag of the
scutchyons and arms of our ancestors, when (to speak truly) there is no
right nobillitie but that which springs of virtue: He boasts in vain of
his great lineage, that seeks to be esteamed for the nobillitie and virtue of
his ancestors, and has no goodness in him self: for what is it to vaunt of
Hercules race, and not to follow his works, which made him so famous through
ye world: Despise not my son thy fathers loving admonitions, for (as the wise
man says) he that honoreth his father shall have joy of his own children,
and when he makes his prayer he shall be hard: he that fears the lord
honors his parents, and does service to his parents as to the lord: The
blessings of the fathers establish the houses of the children, and the mothers
curse rooteth out the foundations: He that forsakes his father shall come to
shame, and he that angreth his mother is cursed of god: To conclude, there is
no prayer which god hears more willingly then that of the father, which he
makes for his child: O my son while thou have yet time, apply thy self to
that now in thy youth, which will be profitable for thee in thy old age,
namely to the attaining of virtue and knowledge, which will procure unto thee,
honor, praise, safety, happiness, rest and tranquillity in this life, and will
in the end guide thee to eternal life.

Chapter third.
The demeanure of Brusanns after his fathers exhortations, and how he was
handeled by Petrona a curtizane.

THe careful old father, having discoursed thus far to his careless young
son, was here interrupted with the abundance of tears which streamed down
his cheeks, but Brusanus who that very morning had appointed with certain of
his companions, to meet in the City at a curtezans house, where great revel
was appointed for, was all this while so busyed in the contemplation of his
pleasures, that he understood never a word what his father had delivered, and
was therefore able to make him no manner of answer, but seeking his best
opportunity to give his father yt slip, in the end, conuaid himself away to his
appointed place, where he found his companions attending his coming: The
father wounderfully perplexed at his sons demeanure, had the narrower watch
to the rest of his proseedinges, and finding his course of life rather to wax
worse then any whit to better, resolved himself of this last experyment, which
was to cut him from all manner of means whereby to maintain his lavish
expenses, and not only by shutting up his own purse, but also by straight
proclamation through his whole kingdom, he prohibyted all under great
penalty, neither to lend him money, nor to render unto him any manner of
relief. But could there be a greater grief to Brusanus then so suddenly to be
brought to so extreme want, his father would afford him no manner of
allowance, the rest were restrained by the late proclamation, his companions
that hitherto had followed him in all his follyes, that were the very ministers
of all his mischiefs, amongst whom he had consumed whole millions of
treasure, and many of them made rich by his idle expenses, did not only refuse
to help him in this necessity, but also left him alone, and refused to come
in his company. Brusanus being now driven to his last refuge: calling to his
rememberance an old acquaintance, called by the name of Madona petrona, a
curtyzane that him self had advanced from base parentage, who by his
prodigalitye was wonderfully enriched, both in apparel, Iewelles, and great
store of money which she put out to vsurye, thinking to find her as kind of her
coin as she was of her honesty, he imparted unto her the extreamitye of his
want, but she having had former inteligence how matters had passed between
his father and him, and finding him now to be grown so bare, determined to
shake hands with his acquaintance, and notwithstanding the many benefits
which before he had bestowed of her, she rather resolved to see him beg, then
she would part with one crown to do him pleasure, but yet for her better
excuse she answers him thus: Three years are fully expired (my Lord Brusanus)
since you took the first fruits of my body, since which time I have remained
altogether at your disposition, so often as it pleased your self to command,
yet not without great infamye and slander to my person, being discredited
through the whole City, by your continual recourse and repair to my house,
and although I must confess you have bestowed of me many liberal rewards,
and from time to time have gratified me with rich and costly presents, yet sir
when you shall consider well of your penny worthes, I have greatest cause to
complain of my market, when the bargain has cost me the price of my
maidenhead, my pain of pleasant years spent at your devotion, with my name
and reputation for ever infamed: where otherwise my beauty might have proved a
bayte to have intangeled some amorous gentleman or other rich merchant, that
might have maintained me and made me his wife, where now that hope were more
then vain to look for: what rests then for poor Petrona but to hold that
she has, and to make account of no more, then what she does already
possess. Brusanus, who all this while had listened to he speeches, was not a
little pinched to hear her conclusion, but minding to make no other replye,
imbrasing her in his arms he gave her a friendly busse, adding these few words
as follows: I perceive my Petrona, the old proverb must be newly veryfied,
which says, that poverty will part good company, thou know I have loved
thee, and now I must leave thee, but if thou think I have bought thy chaffer
to cheap, blame but my fortune, which has rather conducted me to crave new
credit, then to pay old debts: with this he gave her an other friendly kiss,
making semblaunce as though he would have taken his leave, thinking that for a
farewell Petrona at the least would have relieved him with some five hundred
crowns, who had bestowed of her (at several times) a great many thousands,
but she more lauishe of her lips, then she was of her purse, to shift him
off by a prettyer mean replied in this manner. Alas Brusanus and must we
needs part, if (as you say) there be no other remedy, know this by the way,
Petrona cannot live by kisses, but if you love me as you have protested in
words, I hope I shall find it confirmed in your deeds, and being fitted now
by occation to make trial of your kindness, I stand in want at this instant
of a thousand crowns, the which (my Brusanus) I hope you will not deny me
for a farewell, being the last gift (as I perceive by your own words) that I
am ever like to receive at your hands.

Brusanus finding himself to be thus prevented, answered thus: Petrona, thy
former experience (I think) has taught thee, that my crowns have been ever
at thy commandment, my sword as ready to encounter thine enemies, my body as
willing to satisfy thy pleasures, nay wherein have I failed to fulfill all
duties proper to a lover, but Petrona the world is changed with Brusanus, have
thou not hard, my father is displeased with me, do thou not know my friends
have forsaken me, and do thou not see my servants have left me, Brusanus
has been honored as a prince, but now more despised then a poor pesaunt,
what speak thou of a thousand crowns ( Petrona) to him that is not
furnished of so many farthinges: yet the thing that does most grieve me, is to
part with thy sweet company, but there is no remydye. Brusanus may not stay,
Hungaria cannot hold him. Alas my Lord (said Petrona) and can you bestow
nothing for a farewell, if you be driven to so narrow a scantling, the
paringes of your nay.es shall suffyce to content your lover petrona, the which
as a relic in your rememberaunce, I would charily keep, persuading my self
that if you had had a better present, I know it would have fallen to my share.
Brusanus seeing the kindness of the loving worm, cutting of the paringes of his
nails he delivered them into her hand, vttring these words: Lo petrona, to
satisfy thy request, hold here the present, which I know thou have desired for
the love thou bear unto me, and although for thy sake I could heartily wish
them* to be Iewelles of inestimable price, yet knowing such wishes are ever
but wast, I assure thee if my ability would stretch as well to a whole million
of gold, I would as willingly bestow the one as I have reddely given the
other: And here withal pressinge toward her, thinking once a gain to have
taken a kindly kiss, she thrust him from her and said: Nay soft Brusanus you
mistake your text, I am sure every parish priest could learn you this lesson,
No penny no pater noster, and I have often hard it said, No longer piping no
longer daunsing, and now thou have nothing left, what should I do with thy
company, go vaunt thee now Brusanus, thy lover petrona would never leave thee,
so long as thou hadest but the paringes of thy nails left to bestow of her,
the best advise I can now afford thee is, I would with thee presently to go
hang thy self, by means whereof both thy ill fortune and thine ill life might
both finish in an ill death: This said she speedely flung away from him, goeing
into her chamber, where she shut fast the door, leaving Brusanus standing all
alone, who recounting with himself of these dispightfull taunts, had his
fantasy so assailed with fear, grief, despair, heat, collar, wrath, and
desire of revenge, that he raged against the gods, he railed on the destinies,
he defied love, he cursed all woman kind: and having thus given allarume as
well to all the powers of heaven as also to all the works of the earth, after
a little pause and that he had a while bitte on the bridell, he returned into
these speeches.

The fourth Chapter.
How Brusanus sorrowing his former misled life, resolves to travail.

ANd will thou now be discouraged Brunsaus, by remembering thine own
imperfections, seeing by labor and diligence thou may yet recover what thou
have hitherto lost, have thou seen so much and can thou practice nothing,
are thine eyes clear, and will thou still counterfeit blindness, have thou thy
right fences and will thou seem senseless, can thou not make profit of
thine own folly, learn with the be to gather sweetest honny from the
bitterest herbs, when both fortune, ocasion, and thine own industry may so
well help forward the matter, let thy vice make thy virtue more to shine, so
may thou think thy poverty a happy prosperity, yea most happy may thou
count thy mishap, that is the original of thy true hap, while thou did
flourish, how were thou fed with fair words, how many fained friends, fine
fauners and cunning flatterers did haunt thee, yea in thy wealth whole millions
of friends did compass thee, but now in thy want, do thou not see that both
pleasure and company does forsake thee, thou can not find one that will
afford thee so much as a good look. Since then Brusanus, thou find such
falshoode in felloweship, and such faithless deeds in such painted speches,
shake of these fauning curres with the flagge of defiance, and from henceforth
try ere thou trust: I but now to late to apply a plaster when the sore is
past cure, to cry Alarume when the City is sacked, to seek for covert, when
the storm is past, and now thou will cry cauy, when thy coin is consumed, and
beware of flatterers when thy wealth is wracked, to wax more chary when thou
have nothing in thy charge, and when thou have already received the maate,
thou seek by cunninge to make void the check: But now thou triest it true
that thy father foretold thee, that so long thou would be careless, that
at the last repentance would pull thee by the sleeue: but the flattering
pleasures of this world can promise no other bliss, for worldly prosperity (I
see) is a spur to wickedness, it carries men willingly to the pleasant court of
vanity. Leave of therefore Brusanus if not for shame yet to avoid sin: shake
of this incumbraunce, strive to be verteous, leave to be amorous, forsake
misdemeanure, and since thou have seen much, practice a little: it is a common
imperfection to offend, but an extraordinary perfection to amend, the first
springs by nature, the other from virtue, and how often has thy father told
thee that honor is only to be sought for by the means of virtue. It only
rests then that I embrace thee (o sweet repentance) by whose only means,
we are drawn to mercy, and without whose wings we cannot fly from vengance.
Brusanus thus thanked the Gods, that had wrought his honor out of his shame,
that had made his own finding to go amise, to be the best mean ever after to
hold him in the right paths, and although before he had showed himself a
brave gallante in the court of Venus, yet now he vowed himself a professed
soldier to march under the ensign of virtue, and calling to mind his former
mislede life, did not only detest and hate love, but so mightily contemned the
whole feminine sex, that his hatred did so much exceed, by how much he
remembered his present misfortunes. This was a sudden change, but sure a happy
chance, but Brusanus holding on a determinate mind to seek after honor,
resolved him self to travel, the which when his father had got intelligence
of the news, was half a salve to his sorrow, thinking that it would either
be a mean to end his life or mende his lewdnes, he therefore took secret
order to have him conveniently furnished as well with money as all manner of
other necessaries.

The fifth Chapter.
Brusanus iourneing through the country of Epirus, met with Leonarchus king of
that Region, disguised like a merchant, called himself Corynus, and what
speeches passed between them.

BRusanus being thus appointed, called to his remembrance the order of many
travelers, who after their return into their own country are commonly so
full fraught, with far fette follies, that they are utterly empty of their
home virtues, and can make no better return then their heads ouerburthened
with too many outlandishe vanities, he therefore armed him self with a
determinate mind, to gather a platform both of virtue and vice, imitating the
good in their commendable qualities, and abhorring the bad in their foolish
demeanures applyeng both presydents of good and bad to one virtuous purpose,
and wholly to endeavor him self in all honorable enterprises having thus
fortified him self with this virtuous imagination, directed his first course
toward Epirus, where Leonarchus then reigned king, a prince that was renowned
for his virtue, fortunate for his peaceable government, reverenced for his
gravity, obayed for his authority, loved for his mediocrity, and honored for
his liberality, administering justice with such sincerity, yet tempering the
extreamitie of the law with such limmite, as he gained the good will of
strangers in hearing his virtue, and won the hearts of his subjects in
feeling his bounty, counting him unworthy to bear the name of a sovereign
which knew not (according to deserte) both to cherishe and chastise his
subjects. This noble prince upon a private conceit to him self, disguised in
the habit of a merchant, had secretly left his court, and traveling through
many parts of his own dominions (being not other-wise taken then for a
merchant) called him self by the name of Corynus, the which name (because I
perceive he was other wise loath to be known) I will therefore use for the
time. Brusanus, who in the mean space had iurnied many days toward Epirus
was now come to the confines, and taking his direct course toward the famous
city of Doretta (where the court was still residente) he fortuned (in the way)
to ouer-take this kinglye marchante Corynus: and after friendly salutations
passed between them, Corynus taking a through vewe of this gallant young
prince, was wonderfully delighted in his comely personage, in his amiable
countenance, and in his modest regards: and perceiving by his apparel that he
was a stranger, to break of their unnecessary silence he said. Although
(courteous gentleman) it be no part of good manners to desire to know a
strangers secrets, yet if it pleased you but to recompt unto me what country
man you are borne, whether you are traveling, and what I might call your name,
if (to requite your curtisie) there be any thing wherein I may stead you, you
shall command me for a much greater matter then I have yet requested. Brusanus
having heard the mild motion of this grave marchaunte whose outward show of
countenance, did manifest an inward stay of mind answered thus? Sir, my
country is Hungaria, my name Brusanus, by birth a gentleman, by fortune a
traveler, and the cause standing of such nice points, as peradventure your
gravity may hardly brook: let this suffice, my young years (as you see)
subject to sundry impressions, at the last have taken holdfast in traveling
to unknown cities, led by this resolution, that in seeing many things, I
should learn some thing, and intised by the general report of the rare
virtues, the maiesticall gouernmente, and most renowned demeanure of
Leonarchus, who holds her the princely diadem, I have left mine own
country, and am traveling to his court to se if the bravery be correspondent
to the brute, and the demeanure of the countries, so commendable as is
reported. Corynus, secretly rejoicing to hear himself so praised, answered
thus. Truly, (curtious gentleman) the commendations you have given to
Leonarchus are so many, that my self (being as much affected toward him as
any subject may be to his sovereign) can devise to say no more, and for
that by your former speeches, I perceive your desire is to grow into the high
way of experience, being arrived here to se the fassions of our court,
whatsoever by eye your self shall perceive, I by my experience can something
lay open, having in my yoonger days ventured amongst the rest to become a
courtier, although not so formal as county Baldassare has figured. The court
here of Epirus, being so renowned (as you would make it) by the king that now
holds the scepter, as it is replenished with men of diverse calling, so it is
frequented by men of as sundry dispositions. Some repair thither hoping of
preferment by their virtuous endeavors, who by their good deseruinges are to
grow in favor, or by their valor and force of arms, are to be confirmed with
martial honor. Other again incited by vanity (having the rain in their one
necks) resort thither to satisfy their youthful humors with a little folish
bravery, where their brains are so continually combred with devising of new
fashions, that many times of comely personages, they transform them selves to
disguised puppittes. By this you may perceive that as the court is a school of
virtue to such as can bridell their minds with discretion, so it is a nursse
of vice to such as measure their wills with witless affection.

The sixte Chapter.
How Brusanus and this counterfaite Merchant were incountered by a courtier
called Gloriosus, and lodged at Vtica.

COrynus had not scare ended these speeches, but they were overtaken by a
Gentleman that was ridinge to the court, and a courtier he was, called by the
name of Signior Gloriosus, the loftines of his looks was much to be marueld
at, but the manner of his attire was more to be laughed at. On his head he
woare a hatte without a band like a Mallcontent, his hair hanging down to
both his shoulders, as they use to figure a hagge of hell, his beard cut peecke
a deuaunt, turnde up a little, like the vice of a play, his countenance
strained as far as it would stretch, like a great Monarcho: his collar turnde
down round about his neck that his throat might be seen, as one that were
going to hanging should make way for the hallter, his dublet holstered with
bumbast, as if he had been diseased with the dropsy: upon that he wore a
loose Mandilyon, like a counterfeit soldier, in his hand a fan of feathers,
like a demye harlot: Riding thus along by them, casting his eyes to and fro,
seming by his demenure, as if he had had, a whole common wealth in his head,
without any word speaking, Corynus who before had known him in the court, and
therefore best aquainted with his humor, said unto him: Gentleman, if I be not
much mistaken you are riding toward the court, whither (if it please you) we
will be glad to bear you company: Gloriosus bending his browe answered: thou
base borne fellow, what do thou think I would make a companion of thee, a
pedling merchant, more fit for a ware house then a princes court: Corynus
smiling to himself to hear the folly of this vain headed courtier mildly
made answer: Truly sir, I would not presume so far to make my self your
companion, but I have known right worshipful Gentle men thus riding by the
way, that would have been well pleased with good company: This soft replye
wonderfully qualified the fyerse nature of Gloriosus: whose colericke
complexion was as testy as a goose that has young goslinges, yet easy to be
pleased again with a handful of otes, so after a little more friendly
communication had between them, they were come to the gallant City of Vtica,
where they all agreed to test for that night, and after they were come to the
inn, Brusanus desirous to go visit the monuments of the City, and to take a
view of the bravery of the buildings, was accompanied by Corynus, Gloriosus
keeping his lodging as one disdaining to walk the streets with so simple
company: but after they had walked themselves weary, and were returned again to
their chamber, Corynus demanding of a servant what other strangers were in the
house, was answered there were two other, the one a soldier, called by the
name of Martianus, who was newly come from the court, the other called Castus,
a country man that was traveling toward the court: Corynus willed the
servant to entreat them both to come up, hoping to hear some news,
especially by Martianus, who was come from the court, the which both himself
and the rest desired.

The seventh Chapter.
What news Martianus brought from the court, how the king was missing, and how
the courtiers did generally bewail his loss.

BEing both come up into the chamber, after they had been very friendly
wellcomed, Corynus turning to Martianus said, as we understand you are lately
come from the court, and we being desirous to hear what noueltyes are new
coined, are to crave so much curtesy at your hands, to make us partakers of
your news, and for mine own part, I shall think my self greatly pleasured,
that am accustomed by such particular platformes, to gather an universal:
cogniseance either of good or bad: Martianus curtiouslye aunswereed: Truly
Gentlemen the news at the court are strange, yet not so strange as true,
yet not more true then generally lamented by as many as over hears them:
Twentye days are now fully expired, since our most virtuous and noble prince
Leonarchus has been missed at the court, no man knoweing what should become
of him, neither can it be immagined whether he be dead or alive, gone he is,
search there has been, inquiry is daily made every way, and by all means,
but no tidinges can be learned more then I have told you. The lamentable
clamours are universal, the grave counsailers sheades their tears for the
loss of their prince, the father of their counselers, the very stay and
principal pillar of all their consultations, the gallant courtiers have left
off their costly colors, betaking themselves to mourning hew, hanging their
heads, wringing their hands, lamenting the lack of him that was a prince to
defend them, a father to care for them, a companyon in their pleasures, a friend
to reliue their wants, what should I say, the doleful memory is generally
bewailed, some remembering the nobility of his birth, some his peaceable
government, some his liberality, some his justice, mixed with such mercy, some
the greatness of his authority, tempered with such familiar courtesies, that they
did more feel the fruits of his clemency, then the pompes of his greatness,
and all accounting him the father of his people, and the life of the country.
The only comfort that is left them, is the hope they have received of the
gracious young prince Dorestus, who immitating his fathers virtues, and in whom
they already shine so clear, that it is easy to discern him to be a blossom
of the same branch, a stem of the same stock, and a son of the same sire:
Ten days are over passed since (as well by the consent of the counsel, as
by the requests of the commons in general) they would have established him in
his fathers seat: but Dorestus more surcharged with sorrow, then covetous of a
kingdom, and more fit to furnishe a funeral, then to sit in a princes throne,
would in no wise consent to their requests, until he might hear what was
become of his father: But they never ceasing their suit, and he over woried
with their importunityes, to satisfy their requests, have adiorned the day of
his crownation for fyfueteene days, if in the mean time they can learn no
other tidinges, he is then content to receive the diadem, as his proper right
and due inheritance: I will not further enlarge the several conjectures that
are gathered of his absence, some immagininge him to be privily murdered,
some thinking him secretly vowed to some monestary or other religious house,
some thinking so many things, that some knows not well what to think, and
yet when they have all thought, the good king cannot be hard of, neither will I
trouble to tell you what several examinations has been taken, how many
inquiries has been made, and what continual posting there has been through
the whole realm, let this suffice, he cannot be found, and it is thought
necessary (and that by general opinion) that there should be a sovereign
governor, to redress wrongs, to punish vice, to correct abuse, to maintain
justice, and to chearish virtue: Dorestus (though against his own will, yet to
satisfy their requests) have assigned the day of his crownation (as I told
you) within fyueteene days, whereof there are yet five to come, if in the
mean time there come no other news, I have then breefly told you all the
news.

The eight Chapter.
The sorrow Brusanus made to hear this news, and how Gloriosus vaunted upon
this report.

COrynus who was nearest touched with this discourse, yet best pleased to here
the tale, wherein both Leonarchus the king, and Dorestus his son were so
virtuously commended, made neither semblaunce of joy nor grief, but listening
what other men would answer kept himself silent: But Brusanus, whose heavy
countenance bewraid his sudden passion said: And is it possible that so
renowned a king, so virtuous a prince, and so loving a sovereign, should be
thus consumed in his own realm, nay in his own court, nay more then that, in
his own privy chamber, and amongst his own subjects, and yet cannot be
learned how, well Brusanus thy hap is the harder, thou have left thy parents,
thy kindred and thy country to become a traveler, thy hope was to have
bettered thine own experience, by the example of him, whose virtues were so
famed through every nation, but thou find thy self prevented by unjust
fortune, and can thou not draw her freakes to a platform of thine own
profit, arm thy self against all her assaults, and beware how thou do
hereafter trust her, and esteem no better of these worldly honors, then as
slipperie joys, sliding pleasures, and transitory delights, and thus fixing
his heavy eyes upon the ground, he ceased further speech: Gloriosus, who was
all this while devising how to speak wisely, after that he had a little roused
himself, bending his brows and putting on his terrible countenance, said:
Well Leonarchus, if thy conspiring enymies, have shortened thy date, by
untimely cutting of thy thread of life, unhappy was thy chance that Signior
Gloriosus was absent, whose provident eye, to look into matters of state, is
enough to prevent all traiterous practices, convey they never so closly, whose
very looks are leueled with such auster aspect, that they are able to fray the
proudest practiser, from al unlawful attempts, and these arms, (that are the
ministers of my displeasure should I but discontentedly stretch them forth, oh,
who were able to abide it, neither strong Sampson amongst his philistians, nor
valiant Hercules against his vgely monsters, were half so terrible as angry
Gloriosus against the troops of traitors, then Leonarchus, nay, then
unfortunate Leonarchus, and in nothing so much unfortunate, as thus to be
sequestered from such a stay to thy state, from such a pillar of thy
preservation, and from such a castle of thy comfort, as might have prevented
all perilles, what so ever thou art happined into, after the whole company had
a little smiled to themselves, and had much ado to forbear open laughter,
Corynus said: it may be sir, you were unknown to Leonarchus, otherwise he was
shrewdly over seen, so much to neglect a gentleman of your quality: My friend
(answered Gloriosus) thou do press me to fare, I pray thee have care of thy
self, and seek not thine own dismembring, by to much vrginge my patience*
with thy unseasonable speeches, do thou think Gloriosus could be unknown to
Leonarchus, when his court has been beautified with my presence, and whose
palaces were adorned with my person: No, no, and therefore I tell thee (thou
manne of little understanding) thy words are to much prejudicial to the
prerogative of my reputation, but it pleases me to impute thine error, to
the want of knowledge, so that in beareing with the one, I am contented to
pardon the other, and therefore I admonish thee hereafter to take heed how
thou do place thy phrase, to a gentleman of the kings court: Well sir
answered Corynus, since I do find courtiers to be so captions, you shall see
hereafter that I will learn to speak more wiselier, when I have occation to
talk with them, in the mean time, me thinks here is a poor man that looks
heavily on the matter: then turning himself to Castus, he said, how now my
good friend, what news with you in the country, it seems by thy cheer, that
all should not be well.

The ninth Chapter.
The woeful discourse of Castus: what craft in the country amongst Lawyers, and
what adiorning amongst maiestrates.

CAstus, first breathing forth a pitious sigh, as the messenger of some
mishappe answered. Alas sir, a comfortles cause requires a careful
countenance, and a curelesse grief, a desperate mind, and if my news be
hapless that I have brought from the country, so now they be helpless by that
I hear from the court, when we be deprived (as I perceive) from our good king,
the only anker-holde of al my hope, that should have ministered right to my
infinite wrongs. And are your wrongs such (answered Corynus) that they are
not other wise to be remedied, then by the king himself, if I be not deceived,
there be laws in the country to determine your right, you have likewise
maiestrates to administer the law, in mine opinion your cause were very strange
if it should not be relieved by one or both. Very true sir (answered Castus)
my cause is strange indeed, and yet if I were'aswell stored with coin
wherewith to corrupt, as I am furnished with sorrow whereof to complain, I
needed not have traveled to the court for redress, neither have I omitted
(so far as my poor abillitye would stretche) both to atempt law, and to
fee aturnies, but mine adversary is wealthy, and therefore worshipfulll, whose
loftye countenance is enoughe to carry out his lewd conscience, and although the
law in it self, intends nothing but right, yet as it is ordered by some
that has the handeling of it, it is made the very instrument of wrong, yea
the most of them framing their plea thereafter as they be feed not according to
the truth, and for private advantage, or how many delays can they forge, from
court to court, from day to day, from time to time, yea from year to year:
then have they such distinctions, such errors, such demurs, such quillites,
such shifts, and so many deceites that the plaintiff shall pass a thousand
troubles, before he may proceed to one trial. Oh these golden dumb shows
are so mighty in working, that he that has them to give, they will make
judges them selves to become both deaf and blind. Thus rich men need speak
but a word, and all will hear them, when poor men may shead their tears but no
man pity them: But after that I had thus tried my self in the law, I
endeavored by petition to present my cause before the pitilesse maiestrates,
but alas there began my greater misery. For first even amongst their base and
seely porters I found a peuish pride, and such a scorneful demeanure, that I
might not be suffered to stand nere, muchlesse to enter their gates without a
bribe, but then again amongst their clerks: O what gaping for greater gifts,
and what loking after costly rewards, the which my poverty not able to search
unto, what found I then but coy countenances currish language, and other like
disdainful demeanure, thus leaving their comfortless houses, I was driven to
give attendance in the cold streates, where after long and tedious waiting,
the very horsekeepers would shoulder me from their master, who if perhaps
through my pitious exclamations, he chanced to cast his head aside, it was
either to afright me with his terrible looks, or utterly to dismaye me with
his churlish checkes. Thus having tried all, but finding none, to pity or
comfort my distress, I determined with my self to travel to the court,
hoping there to find some gentleman, attendant about his majesty, that might
prefer my suit to the king him self, who is accustomed to hear suitors with
more expedition, and to keep them with less expenses: but alas, I perceive my
purpose is prevented, and I left destitute of all hope for ever to be happy.

The tenth Chaper.
The answer of Martianus, whether it be better for a suter, the court or
country.

IT is but a bare comfort (answered Martianus) wherthe best choice has yet
assurance of doubtful end, you have ceast your playnt in the country, to become
a suitor in the court, and herein you may be compared to him that goes out of
gods blessing into the warm sun: do you think to find such curtisie
amongst courtiers: you say you go to complain of a wrong, and peradventure to
him that will give no man his right, you say you are poor and unable to give a
fee, but you shall hardly find him in the court, that will do any thing for
gods sake: in the country if you found such churlishe regardes, in the court
you shall find as proud looks: yea the very doorekeepers to these great men
in the court, will look for more cappes and courtesies then (I answer) you
have bin accustomed unto, and yet still receive your obaysance, without any
regard of your business: but do you complain of bribing in the country, and
would you come empty handed to the court: where there is no grace without gold,
nor no friend without a fee: and if your adversary be wealthy (as you have
said) and that he be able to send five hundred duccattes on his message, do
you not think them able to work wonders in the court, as the golden dumb
shows (you speak of) could ever do in the country, yes be sure, they are not
only able to make men blind and deaf, but they will open his lips that was
dumb, to present al manner of ^easinges, yea for a need before the king
himself. I am sorry my experience should serve me so well to display the court
of Epirus, but he that himself has been surely pricked, can bid others take
heed how they run amongst thorns, and I that have sped so ill with my
courting, can wish others to beware, how they come thither a sewing, if they
be not able to maintain bribing. It is now thirty years since I became a
soldier, from which time I have served the king in all occations against his
enemies in the field, the rest of the time I have continued in his garrisons:
in this mean space, I have spent what my friends left me, which was some
thing; I have lost part of my blood, which was more: and I have consumed my
prime of youth and flourishing years, which was most: and comforting my self
with some hope of happy reward (for my better help now in my declining years)
with this resolution I came to the court, what money I was able to make, I put
it in my pursse to bear my charges: I have there continued these six months,
with cappes and curtisies down to the ground, and some time, may it please
your honor, otherwhiles, I beseech your worship, but neither honorable, nor
worshipful, that I could find to better my state but I have spent my money, and
am come away as you see. And yet I must confess that for the king himsef,
there was never prince yt was more bountiful, nor liberal, nor that has given
oftiner or greater rewards. But alas poor king (if without arrogance I may
pity a king) he has been nothing more deceived then in bestowing his
rewards: for being driven to see with other men's eyes, to hear with other men's
ears, and to reward by other men's commendations, it is seen that promotion is
determined in such fort, as fancy rather confirms the election then
discretion, in so much that desert may now go a begging, when all the world is
guided by opinion, and many a one has been rewarded, and commended by some
noble man for his great service, that has but help him off with his hose when
he went to bed at night, or peradventure a ruffesetter, a bottel carier, a
news bringer, a parricite, a slaterer or some other such like minister of his
pleasure, and it may be, a bribe giver, for a hundred aungelles of gold, in
such a matter, are of greater virtue, then all the aungelles that be in heaven,
yet (as I have said) such a one (upon some noble man's commendations) shall
receive greater recompense, then the man of good deserte indeed, of any
condition or quality what soever: so that in the court, pleasinge of humors,
is found to be most profitable, where a fool shall glory of more savor, then
a wise man of acceptance. But I pray you sir (answered Corynus) why did you
not make your request to the king himself, who as it should seem by your own
words is forward enoughe, to recompense well doing. Very true (answered
Martianus) and to the king himself I presented my suit, who with most gracious
promises, and comfortable speeches, willed me to commit my cause to some noble
man, that might commend it to his majesty and get my disspatche: but alas,
our dainty nobles are so dangerous to be spoke with (...), that it is well if
in a months waiting, you may attain to three words speaking: for some times
if I met them in merry talk with my betters, my petitions came then out of
season to interrupt their pleasures, an other time if I met any of them
solitary by himself, my lord was then in some melancolly mood and out of
time to be spoken with all: thus between mirth and melancolly, poor suitors
may long enough watch their seasons, yet never find them in season to do
them any good: but could I once again have come to the presence of the king,
I would have made no doubt, of that recompense that now I never look after.
And why so (answered Corynus) if Dorestus be the man that he is taken for, good
deserte can never go unrewarded, god for bid he should sit in his fathers
seat, if he should neglect his fathers virtues.

The eleventh Chapter.
Corynus, Martianus, and Castus, are arrested of treason and brought to the
court to the young prince Dorestus, there to be tried.

GLoriosus, who had over heard all, and by their speeches did think himself
to be well furnished with suffitient matter to pick a thank (when he came to
the court) but specially of these last words spoken by Corynus, god forbid
that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seat) went presently to the criminal
judge of the city, charginge him in the behalf of the young prince Dorestus,
to apprehend, both Corynus, Martianus, and Castus, and to see them brought to
the court as traitors, where he himself would be ready to avouch against them,
treson to the king, slander to his court, and infamy to his whole
government, this said, without any longer stay, he took his journey toward
the prince (with great expedition) intending to aggrauate the matter as much
as might be, the rather to win himself reputation, in performing so notable a
piece of service, (as he supposed this would fall out to be) the maiestrates
understanding Gloriosus to be a courtier, hearing his words to importe a matter
of treson, and as it was thought the king being so long missing, was brought to
some casualtie by the practice of treson, accompanied therefore with some
convenient number he came to the Inn where he arested the foresaid three of
treason, and although the apprehension in this manner was some amasement to
their minds, yet it was most strange to Corynus to be thus taken for a traitor
to the king, but after that he had a while deliberated what might be the
matter, he requested the Offycer to let him understand, whether it were by
direction, information, or what other instruction he had thus to apprehende
them, the other aunsweared, sir you shall find mine own authority suffycient
to arrest a traitor, for the rest what there is farther to charge you withal,
you shall understand at your coming to the young Prince Dorestus, before
whom I mind presently to bring you: and having a suffycient company to guard
them, forwards they go, the prisoners every one comforting himself, knowing his
own conscience to be clear. Brusanus that had given good heed to every
accidente, and perceiving by the former circumstances that Corynus, Martianus
and Castus were mere strangers the one to the other, thought it therefore
impossible that there should be any compact of treason between them, and
having a special likinge to Corynus, desirous to see what might fall out
against* him he followed him, who when he had overtaken, he proffered any
courtesy wherein a stranger might steed him, whether with his traueil or his
purse, they were both at his commandment: Corynus again in as great a
league of likinge toward Brusanus, and desirous to do him some honor, before
he should leave the country, requested him to accept of a prisoners thanks,
and that he would not leave his company, till, it was determined what should
become of him, to which request Brusanus very willingly agreed unto: they
traueil so long that they come to the court, where Gloriosus was attending and
had quickly certified the Prince of their arrival, who commanded that the
prisoners should be safely kept until the next morninge, when himself would
be ready to hear their cause.

The twelfth Chapter.
Dorestus sits in judgment, Gloriosus accuses Castus.

THe next day, he being accompanied with the nobles that were in the court:
came into the common place of Justice, usually called by the name of The house
of reformation. This house of reformation, was a very large room, where the
kings of Epirus, in the ancient time were accustomed personally to sit, at the
least three times every week, to hear suitors and to dispatch, all manner of
causes and controversies, that were between their subjects, and to minister
Justice, to as many as were to demand it: and in this house of reformation it
was ever accustomed, that if there were many suitors, the complaints of the poor
were ever heard, before the requests of the rich: The Prince being come to
this place, after that he had given reverence to the throne of majesty, wherein
his father had been accustomed to sit, then sitting himself down in the next
seat, the noblemen likewise every one taking his place: the prisoners were
brought to the bar, where Gloriosus was likewise ready to inform, but before
they did proceed to the hearing of the matter, the young Prince delivered
these words: They make themselves guilty of great injustice, who being
appointed of God to persecute the wicked with the swoorde drawn, will yet
keep their hands clean from blood, whereas the wicked in the mean time
commits all manner of sin, and that uncontrolled: and it is no less cruelty to
punish no offense, then not to forgive any, the one being an abuse of
clemency, the true ornament of a Sovereign, and the other to turn authority
into tyranny: nevertheless maiestrates in the execution of Justice, ought to
take great heed least by over great severity, they hurt more then they heal,
for the seat of a Judge that is too severe seems to be a gibbet already
erected, we must then diligently note, that as it is the duty of all
maiestrates, to chastise and to punish every malefactor, so likewise they must
beware, least under pretense of exercising Justice, they fall into an other
kind of injustice through overmuch rigor, for too much severity, causes men
to be misled for cruelty, and belongs rather to a beastly and sauuage nature,
then to the nature of man: for clemency and compassion, never ought to be
separated from a good and just sentence, which is to hold small faults
excused, or but lightly to punish them (provided all way that justice be not
violated) for as the wise man says, that it was ill to be subject to a Prince
under whom nothing was tolerated, but worse where all things were left at
randon. Let us learn therefore for the conclusion of our discourse, so to use
justice with mediocrity, that neither we learn to over much severity, nor yet
may be ledd by too much lenity. Dorestus having thus ended his exhortation,
the whole company that heard it, were wonderfully delighted, some extollinge
his virtue, and other commending this his proceedinge: after a silence
commanded and that every man was hushed: Gloriosus was willed to say what he
had to infer against the prisoners, and according to the custom of the
place, Castus cause was first to be examined, he was therefore willed to
stand forth, and Gloriosus commanuded to proceed in that he had to charge
him: who after he had first cleared his throat, then castinge up his eyes to
the roof of the house, he discoursed thus: I shall not need (gracious Prince)
to traueil much by circumstances, or to use many words, to make my proof the
better against this wretched worm of the world, my credit beeinge such here
in the court, the testimony might seem sufficient, that Gloriosus having spoke
the word, it should not be gainesayde: to come to the purpose, as mine ears
then glowed to hear, so my heart now pants to think, what hateful speeches
were pronounced by this unhappy man Castus, so exclaiming of the lawyers, so
cryinge out against the maiestrate, so slaunderinge of them both, as though
there were neither law nor justice to be hadd within the whole dominions of
Epirus: the which being waid in a due consideration, is not a little stain to
your worthy fathers government. Stay there Gloriosus (said the Prince
Dorestus) I must not suffer you to mince the matter so fit to your purpose,
for it is not the Princes fault, if Justice be not ministered, when he has
appointed maiestrates for the same purpose, but it is his blame if he defer
punishment when he understands the contrary, the rest of your words
importe no other matter then an exclamation made by this poor man against the
maiestrates, and perhaps for want of Justice, but whatsoever be the cause, it
rests in himself to avoid the crime, for as the sovereign Prince,
acknowledges after God none greater then himself, so the maiestrate holds
his power after god of the souraigne prince, private men must therefore
acknowledge both the prince and maiestrate, every one in his place of
iurysdiction with all honor and reverence: Speak then Castus, what have thou
to allege in thine own excuse, for these matters imposed against thee here
by Gloriosus.

The 13 Chapter.
Castus answerch for himself

THe poor man being altogether surprised with an encounter of fear and
grief, was not able to speak one word, but wringing his hands, hanging
down his head, and casting his eyes in such sort, as who should say, alas,
if my cause be not to be pitied what should if avail me to aunsweare: but the
good Prince observing his demeanure, and minding to cut off his timorous
silence, spoke to him as follows: My good friend, let not this courtly
presence, dismay thy country plainness, but comfort thy self with hope of
this place: which distinguishes no persons either by fortunes faune: or
pouerties frown, neither yet to measure the person by his wealth, but justly
to pease the equity of his cause, mercy and justice are the means, where with I
mind to temper my proceedinges, but yet in such mediocrity as the one shall
not be confounded in the other: persuade thy self therefore that thou shall be
heard with equitye, and therefore spare not, but comfort thy self, and speak
boldly. When the prince with his encouragement had set the poor man's tongue at
liberty, he framed his complaint in this order: It is truth (most gracious
prince) that twenty years are fully over passed since my father deceassed, in
his life time called by the name of Codron, and after his death, leaving me his
heir to a poor country cottage, yet seated in a most pleasant orchard,
planted (by my said father) in the prime of his youth, yet alas in a most
unfortunate soil, though happy enough, both for the serenity of the air, and
fertility of the ground, but only unhappy in that it was seated to near an
ill neighbor, for but on the other side of the hedge, there dwelt a gentleman
whose living is great, whose credit is much, whose conscience is least, whose
name is Signior Orlando, who having many times taken survey of my poor plot,
the fruits whereof yielded the greatest relief wherewith to sustain my self,
my wife and children (but that which poor men take for their profits, is used
of gentlemen but for their pleasures) and thinking how commodious it lay for
his house, he was many times in hand with me to have bought the inheritance,
the which I as often denayd him, being the only succorse that I had to repose
in, but after that, o how many quarrels were picked upon small occasion, how was
I berated if a chicken had but flyen over the hedge, the legs of my cattle
were broken, if they strayed but forth of mine own gates, yea my self was
every day threatened by his servants, that in the end gladd to curry
favor, I came unto him desiring his freendship: offering him my orcharde for
his pleasure to walk in at all times, and to make a way through his own
ground, for his better passage, and for some part of the fruit that he best
liked off for his own eatinge, and my self at his commandment to do him any
service that I could, but all this would not serve, there was nothing would
please him, but the whole possession of mine orchard, the which in the end he
desired but for three years, and in the mean space to give an annual rent,
and although in very troth, I was not contented, yet glad to win his favor I
agreed, thinking to bear the brunt for so small a time, the which in deed, I
might the better have done, if he had paid me the rent he promised, but I had no
sooner given him place, voiding my self into a little room not far of, but
mine orchard was enclosed with a mighty ditch, seueralde into his own ground
but for the rent that was promised, although his three years are more then
three times expired, the day is yet to come that ever I could receive groat, to
conclude, he not only with holds my rent, but he likewise holds me out of
my house, and against all right, has kept me out of my own, these ten
years* I cannot deny but in this mean time I have attempted law, but I must
confess it is to my great charge, for his great store of crowns so over weied
my right amongst the lawiers, that in four years suing, I could not bring my
cause to one days hearing, but should I say now after I had bine thus cosined
amongst the lawiers, o no, I perceive it is offenciue, let me then say thus,
after I had bine consumed amongst them, and that I was not longer able to see
them, I made my complaint to the maiestrates, but if it be a fault to say I
found them pitilesse, I humbly crave pardon (most gracious prince) for this is
all that Signior Gloriosus is able to charge me with.

The fourteenth Chapter.
Gloriosus accuses Martian us, who answers his accusation.

THe poor man having thus finished his speech, was willed to stand by, and
Gloriosus was now to infer against Martianus, who proceeded in this wise.
Although I have found by the art of Logique, learned by the rules of
Rethorique, and gathered by the precepts of philosophy, what unnecessary
members these soldiers are in a well governed state (in so much that many wise
men deemeth them worthy of nothing then not to be) yet with all the learning I
have gathered out of my libraries, with all the examples I have seen in my
perigrinations, with all the experiments I have found in the court, nor with
all the art that is in my head, the very stoore-house of wisdom, and from
whence whole fountains, nay huge floods of eloquence does continually abound,
yet (as I have said) all this will not serve me, to reiterate the words
pronounced in disgrace of the whole court of Epirus, by this man of little
reputation, I mean this soldier. His sentences, although not artificially
couched, yet strained after a fulsome manner, to the very full sea marks of
reproach, his phrases very harshe, but more spiteful, his words unaptly
placed, yet according to the literal sense, all applied to a malicious
purpose, I could hear distinguish upon every syllable, and (I give god thanks
for it) I could (according to art) make division of his whole speeches into
several parts, and so examine the mayor and minor, of al his arguments, as I
might refell his propositions, and utterly deny his allegations: But this is
inoughe for Signior Gloriosus to conclud, Martianus has distained the court
with slander, and must cleanse it again with the price of his blood. The young
gallantes of the court, that stood by and had ouer-hearde all, wonderfully
commended Gloriosus, protesting, that he had spoken very wisely, thinking him a
very meet man to be a counceller, but ye young prince Dorestus said as
follows. So far as I can perceive Gloriosus, your learning is more then the
matter wherewith you have charged Martianus, the some of all your eloquence
concerns a slander to ye court, but how or in what manner there it still
rests, but say Martianus, what occation has led thee to speak ill of the
place: Martianus answered thus. Most gracious prince, if in my words I shall
not observe that reverence that I know is apertinente to this presence, I most
humbly crave pardon, and the rather for that my bringing up has not been so
much to direct my speeches to princes in their palaces, as to soldiers in
the fields: to answer then to the matter wherewith Gloriosus has charged
me, the beginning of whose tale is so spiced with such a deal of learning, that
I know not what to say to it, whereby I perceive many courtiers to be much more
fruitful then haares, for as it is said, when they have been at bucke,
within forty days after they lytter there leuerites, then again they go
proud, are conceived, and all at an instant: but these go proud every day in
the week, wax great with learning before they conceive it, and are delivered
of the full burden of their wit, at the least forty weeks before it is
begotten. Many wise men (says Gloriosus) so condemns soldiers, as they
forbid him to have place in a well governed state: and I never heard yet, but
an honest soldier, was a more profitable member to his country, then any vain
headed courtier: whose gentry (as it is written) comes from their parents;
whose wealth, is the harvest of their flattery; whose victories, are the fruits
of their soldiers: for the first, them selves blot with their vices; the
second, they consume with their vanity; the last, is attributed to more then
them selves, I can compare a courtier to nothing better then an ape, which no
man would keep but to procure laughter, and the use of the courtier, is all
for pleasure, naught for profit. It is further inferred against me by this
man of little wit, (this courtier I mean) how slanderous I have been to the
whole court of Epirus; I can not make so learned a demonstration of the matter
as Gloriosus has done, but according to a soldiers capacity. I will show
you by example: suppose I should say (as I trust I shall never have cause to
think) ye Gloriosus the courtier were a very wise man, now, you must
understand this (according to the interpretation of Gloriosus) to be spoken
in ye commendation of the whole court, and where my proposition includes but a
particular person he would infer a general conclusion. May it please your Grace
now to understand, I have served your (most renowned Father) these thirty
years as a Soldier, and comforting my self with some hope of reward, to help
me now in mine elder years. I came to the Court, where I became a suter, but
those eyes that look into all proceedings, and are watchful only to their
own profits, and loath that any fat should be licked from their own
fingers, will suffer no good turn to pass which they can hinder, neither can
I deny (most gracious Prince) but in lamenting mine own misfortune, that have
been so long a suter, that I am now become a beggar: I have complained that so
many drones grating on the princes purse, should eat up the honey from those that
best deserve it. For the punishment of mine trespass, I humbly appeal to your
gracious clemency, for I perceive, if Gloriosus were my Judge, no less would
content him, then the price of the blood in my belly, for a peniworth of
slander to his person. I will not tell you here, into what a pelting chafe
Gloriosus was driven into upon these speeches: I pray you imagine, that he was
wonderfully angry, and kept such a stur upon the matter, that there was no rule
with him, till in the end the prince himself willed him to hold his peace
like a fool. Well quoth Gloriosus, since your Grace speaks so gently unto me,
I am contented at your entreaty to bear with the matter, otherwise I protest
by Jupiter himself, he goes not upon two legs (if he bear the name of a
soldier) but I would have made him to have repented this presumption nine
hundred years hence.

The fifteenth Chapter.
Gloriosus accuses Corynus of treason against Dorestus, the circumstances
whereof are briefly laid open by Brusanus.

AFter the gentleman had been in this sort qualified, he was willed to infourme
what he had against Corynus, and in this wise he began to tell his tale.
Your Grace has already heard by that is past, how infamous the first has
been unto the Country Magistrate: The second has not feared to slander the
court: but this third, in plain terms, has presumed to touch your own
person. The circumstances are but short, and thus follows the words: God
forbid that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seat: the sense is plain, and I
will once again repeat the words: God forbid, that Dorestus should sit in his
fathers seat. Let me see now what gloss can they set to this text? what ifs or
ands can they patch to these speeches, to alter the sense from high Treason?
The whole company that stood by began altogether to cry treason, treason,
treason: but silence being commanded, Corynus was willed to speak for
himself: who in this sort answered. Prince Dorestus, Sophocles the Tragedian,
being accused before the magistrates of dotage, repeated unto them his Tragedy
of Oedipus Coloneus, (which at that instant he had made) so that his accusers
confounded in their own ouerweening, departed with a shameful repulse. So I am
likewise accused of treason, and I am willed to make mine answer: see here
worthy Prince, this wrinckled face, which many years has withered, and should
betoken staidnes: behold these hoarie hairs, whose color time has changed,
and should carry some experience: and although by experience, I could answer in
other circumstances, yet I hope this shall as well find grace to clear me of
treason, as the Tragedy of Sophocles to acquit him of dotage. This answer
seemed confused to the multitude, but the prince Dorestus who had marked the
grave aspectes of this ancient man Corynus, gathered a further meaning of his
words then the rest could well conceive, and whether it were by some secret
instincte of nature, or what other motion it was that moved him, he fell into a
most affection at liking of Corynus, but Brusanus that had stand by all this
while, pressing forth said as follows: Let not a strangers presumption breed
offense, (worthy prince Dorestus) that opposseth himself vncald for, to
testify a truth, and although the matter that I pretend might crave long
discourse, advised purpose, and seemly conueyaunce, yet the rare virtues which
I see to accompany your calling, the singular justice that I see to carry your
proceedinges, shall make me be the less tedious: My self (noble prince) being
led with delight to behold strange Cities, to discover unknown places, and to
better mine own experience, have left my native country, and betaken my self
to pretenced travel, and because I will leave nothing which the necessity of
the cause inforceth me to open, though (peradventure) (in a curtous conceit my
words might smell of flattery) true it is that the renown I have hard of this
country of Epirus, the wisdom of the Prince that governed it, the wise men
that inhabit it, the true Justice that rules it: though one of them were
sufficient to move admiration, yet the most of them have directed my travel
into this country, and bendinge my journey toward this place, by the way I
ouertooke this merchant Corynus: After salutations passed between us, we had
not rid far but we were likewise overtaken by this Gloriosus, what speeches
past between us, because they are neither fitting to our purpose, nor necessary
for the place, I will therefore omit them, but on we rid all together to the
City of Vtica, where determining to rest our selves, in our lodging we met
these other two Martianus and Castus: Martianus being new come from the court
(as himself reported) was the first that gave us to understand of the king
your fathers missing, Castus on the other side was traueling toward the court
(and as it should seem) to seek for justice, but now discouraged by these
late news, Martianus again relating his cause (as even now before this
presence) concluded likewise his little hope, to attain recompense for longs
service, mark now (virtuous prince) for here is the point of all this
treason: Corynus that had over hard all, comforted the poor man in these
speeches: It were pity my friend (said Corynus) that good desert should go
unrewarded, and god forbid that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seat, and
neglect his fathers virtues: I could farther enlearg touching the premises,
but what should I need, when I find your own virtue (worthy Prince) more
sufficient to consider of every necessary circumstance, then mine own little
skill is able to deliver it.

The sixteenth Chapter.
Brusanus is discovered to be the Prince of Hungaria, a combination of
freendship between Dorestus and him.

IN this mean time that Brusanus was thus discoursinge, a gentleman in the
company that sometimes had been in the court of Hungaria, whisperinge in the
Princes ear, assured him that the party which presented that speech, was
Brusanus, the only son of Myletto king of Hungaria: the which when Dorestus
understood, taking the better suruay of the man, and listening more attentively
to his speeches, although he were wonderfully delighted with his words, yet
he was a great deal better pleased with his personage, and having finished
his tale, Dorestus requested Brusanus to tell his name, and what countreyman he
was, Brusanus aunsweared, sir, I was borne in Hungaria, a gentleman by birth,
and by name Brusanus: It is not unlikely (quoth Dorestus) that Brusanus, the
Prince of Hungaria, should be any less then a gentleman, and if there be no
other occasion then I can imagine, Brusanus can be no less then welcome to
Dorestus. Brusanus seeing himself to be thus discovered, briefly made
aunsweare: and Brusanus desires no greater contentment, then to be an assured
friend to Dorestus. Dorestus then arisinge from his seat, and incountring with
Brusanus said: and in token of perpetual amitye with Brusanus, Dorestus here
gives his hand, and bids Brusanus most heartily welcome: the one of them
then imbracinge the other, with more then ordinary affection, the whole company
were delighted to see the courteous demeanure of these two gallant young Princes:
but above the rest Corynus especially rejoiced at the sight, for knowinge now
that Brusanus was the Prince of Hungaria, commended him in his imagination to
be the most rare and towardly young Prince that lived.

The seventeenth Chapter.
Dorestus proceeds to judgment, he makes choice of Corinus to direct him in
his counsayles.

AFter the two Princes had one the other thus entertained. Dorestus willing a
seat to be prepared, caused Brusanus to sit down next unto himself: and being
thus setteled: Dorestus mindinge to proceed in justice, delivered these
words: The Office of a good Prince is to defend the common wealth, to help
the innocent, to aid the simple, to correct the offender, to relieve the
poor, to honor the virtuous, to punish the vicious, to bridell the
ambitious, and by justice to give every one his own: and common wealths are
not lost, for that Princes live in pleasure, but because they have no care of
justice, neither do people murmr, when the Prince does recreate his person,
but when he is slack to redress wrongs. O that princes did know what it were
to take charge of a kingdom, he should find that to be just in himself, were
honor to his person, but to minister justice, is profit to the whole
commonwealth: it is not therefore enough for him to be virtuous in his own
person, but he is also bound to root al vices from amongst his people: But what
profit is it for a prince himself to be honest, and those that should
administer justice under him to be dissolute, For a prince to be true, and his
officers false, for a prince to be gentle and his officers cruel: And has it
not ben often known, that where the prince himself has been careful, those
that he has put most in trust, have been negligent: I will for a time
dissemble some thing of mine own knowledge, when we shall need no other
president at this time, then the complainte of this poor man Castus, in
redress of whose cause I do here decree, that Orlando shall speedily restore
him again to his house and orchard, and for the annual rent that was
concluded on between them, he shall restore it him four fold, and that for so
many years as are behind.

I do further ordain, that the Lawyers which have taken his money, and not
ending his cause, shall repay it double: the magistrate likewise that denied
him justice, I do here discharge him from bearing office, and for the small
regard that he has had to the complaint of the poor, I do ceaze him at
five hundred pound fine, to be distributed to the relief of the poor. For
thee Martianus that have served so long a soldier, it is not requisite, that
the virtue of valiancy should go unrewarded, for good soldiers must be
cherished, and in respect of thy long service, and to comfort thee now in thy
latter years, I do here bestow upon thee three hundred crowns, that shall
presently be paid unto thee, and I do further give thee a pension of three
hundred crowns by the year, to be paid unto thee during thy natural life.
Corynus, I do here acquit thee of treason, thy words rather proceeding of
honest affection: but if thou have committed a fault, it touched but my self,
and good Princes ought not so much to revenge their own injuries, as to defend
those that are iniuried: He should pardon wrongs that are done to his own
person, but revenge the least ill that is committed against the Commonwealth:
and for mine own part, since I came to the state of discretion, I have ever
had two things before mine eyes, which is, not to revenge with rigor upon mine
enemies, nor to be unthankful to my friends: and as it becomes a good
Prince, to have more regard to the benefit of his Country, then to the
delights of his person: yet for that they are often times negligent in many
things, not so much for that they have no desire to foresee, as because there
are none that dare warn them. I will that from hence forward thou be attendant
about me, my self allowing thee a sufficient stipend for thy maintenance: thy
office shall be to give me counsel in all my affairs, and to advertise me of
such faults and imperfections as thou shall see to appear in me, and if thou
shall see me to neglect my fathers proceedings, I will that thou shall reprove
me: and although there be many others, by whom I am counseled by, yet
amongst them all, I reserve my self to be familiar with thee, hoping by thy
grave looks, that thou will not advise me in any thing that shall not redound
as well to my honor as to my profit. The whole company did wonderfully commend
this censure of the prince, some noting his justice, some his courtesy, some
his liberality, others his clemency: but Corynus in this manner addressed his
speech. As your Graces authority to command, is full of virtue, wisdom, and
granity: so it belongs to me to obey with diligence, truth, and fidelity,
esteeming it much to my reputation to be commanded by your Grace, in whose
proceedings there is so great a testimony of virtue: and because to princes and
great Lords, we must minister our reasons by weight, and give our words by
mesure: yet because your wisdom deemeth it so reasonable to be advertised, I
beseech you turn not that to presumption that I shall present by duty and
office, and if my words shall derogate in any thing from your honor* let my
profession suffer indignity, by which I hold the countenance of my reputation:
and so I will wade no further in protestation, because great offers are oftener
performed in words than deeds.

The eighteenth Chapter.
Dorestus seeks to defer his establishment in the kingdom, Corynus
advises him not to refuse it.

THese premises thus concluded, every man remained satisfied, Dorestus
himself excepted, whose mind was still molested, with the memory of his
father, and whose spirits were daily troubled with this that now insueth. You
have partly heard that when Leonarchus was missing from the court, and that
after all means of inquiry had been made after him and could not yet be heard
of, it was desired by a general request, that Dorestus (according to his
right) should presently be crowned king, and although at that very instant it
was deferred by Dorestus, yet by their general importunity, he consented
within fifteen days to satisfy their desires, to the which request he the
rather granted for that he hoped in the mean time to hear some news of his
father, thirteen of the fifteen days are exspired, and Dorestus to give a
longer time, uses these words. O what trust may be hoped for in this
flattering world, whose custom is with a little gold to mix a great deal
of dross, under a resemblance of truth, it leads into many deceites: and to
over few and short delights, it ioynes infinite griefs and displeasures, to
whom it shows most favor, in him is most perril and destruction: and the
alurements of the world are but baits to beguile such as bite at them, when
princes them selves are so far deceived, for where they are thought to have
open liberty, they are kept in secret prison: when it is thought they have al
things, alas they have nothing: when they are thought in greatest safety, then
are they sonest assaulted with peril: so that truly we may bouldly say, that
he alone that is shut in the grave, is in safegarde from the inconstancy of
fortune: consider (I beseech you) my, cause of grief, and if you shall find my
complaints to be more then ordinary, you shall see the occasion to be no
less then extreme: but have your selves forgotten whom you have lost,
remember, remember Leonarchus your king what he was toward you, how
mercifully he governed you, how fatherly he loved you, how carefully he
preserved you, and how cherely he cherished you, and would you now with such
speed establishe an other in his place till it be assuredly known what is
become of himself: O god forbid that either you should be so ungrateful, or
that Dorestus should be so unnatural, and if you should thus forget your
Prince, it might be thought you were more in love with his fortune then with
himself, and a small show of hearty good will whom you seemed so much to
honor in his presence, that you should so suddenly forget in his absence:
But if ever you loved your Prince now publishe your gratfulnesse that it may
be seen to the world: and leave off to make further request in a matter that
so much concerns your own reproach and my dishonor. Corynus, who only
adressed himself to answer, said as follows: Although it might be deemed* a
sign of little wit and great folly, for a man to answer sudainely to every
proposition, yet for as much as it has pleased your grace to admit me to
speak, and remembering with what devotion you requested me to do it. I am
bound in like affection, with all humility to obey you: It is not unknown unto
us the cause you have of grief, but if you may lament the loss of a loving
father, we have no less reason to sorrow for the want of a gracious
sovereign, yet seeing the chances of mortal creatures, do show that all men
are subject to the law of nature and fortune, and albeit (there is no doubt)
but that your father might be a worthy prince, and there with all replenished
with every condition appertaining to the virtue, and condition of a king, yet
since in his creation he brought with him a subjection to worldly casualtyes, I
think your wisdom is too much, to make that grievous to you, which nature
ordains common to all, when there is nothing happened to your father,
otherwise then god has determined, who no sooner had created his body, but he
both directed the course of his life, and ordained the time of his death, for
god having made all mortal things, has authority to dispose them, even with
the same power wherewith he has created them, reserving only to himself
imortality, so that we must confess, that all things are guided and gourned
by the providence of god, who knows and orders casual things necessaryly,
and although in your father there was fully filled, the pattern of a good
prince, you can not in better sort express your zeal, then to suffer god to
have his will without grudge, let my words therefore but intimate thus much,
that as you cannot recall again those that be absent, so you must not be
careless of those that be present, and as no man is bound to those that are
dead, yet every man must give succors to them that are alive: you are left
here the right inheritour to the crown of Epirus, and by no other means then
god himself has appointed, refuse not then Dorestus, that intercession of thy
subjects, which is so much desired for their comfortes and thine honor.

The nineteenth Chapter
Dorestus what he replied, Corynus the merchant is become Leonarchus the king,
the joy that was made for his recovery

DOrestus, that was little stirred in the winding up of this discourse,
briefly made this answer, do thou call it honor Corynus, to put my father
from his crown, he is unworthy to have honor, that by infamous means will
seek after it, and the child that will unjustly take his fathers honor, ought
to loose his life, but if thou hadest so great regard to those vain
prehemineces or honorable dignities, lookd after by ambitious minds, o how
much should thou have respected mine honesty, which is the very first step
(indeed) to win honor, and without the which we can attain to no better then
vain glory, which is but a false shadow of true virtue, the liberty I gave
thee to speak, contained things indifferent, neither unmeet to be required,
nor worthy to be denaid, persuading altogether to bear more respect to my
frendshipe, then remembrance to my calling: the which since thou have
neglected, I do once again admonish thee hereafter to be more circumspect,
and as thou tenderest my good will, to be better advised what thou speak,
Corynus immediately answered thus: Well Dorestus if Leonarchus has left thee a
sorrowful son, thou have made Leonarchus a most joyful father: then sitting
himself down in the seat of majesty, he further said: it were but in vain
longer to conceal that, the knowledge whereof (I perceive) would turn to so
great comfort* See here Dorestus, the instabilitie of fortune, I was even now
a prisoner, then a Counsailer, now a king* and all at an instaunt. Dorestus,
who by this time had taken a better surnay of this counterfeit merchant, and
having now gathered assured knowledge who it was, falling down on both his
knees before him, he cried aloud, God save Leonarchus, my most redoubted king
and father: The rest of the Nobility, with the whole assembly there present,
altogether cried out, God save the king, God save the king: Do you not think
this sudden alteration bred as great admiration: yes I can assure you, and it
likewise brought with it no less contentation, for every man rejoiced in the
recovery again of their good king, but Brusanus, both wondered and triumphed in
his own imagination, to see the accident how strangly it fell out. Gloriosus
amongst the rest, seeing the merchant (whom he had accused of treason)
sitting under the cloth of estate, and remembering otherwise how he had
handled him in speeches, was half out of love with his own wit: but after a
convenient pause, that silence was commanded, the king in this wise began to
discourse.

The twentieth Chapter.
Leonarchus discourses what experience he has gathered in his late traueiles,
and first of the infections of his own Court.

AS it is the nature of vice, to put on a vizard, and to disguise and cover it
self with those shows that belong only unto virtue and being thus clothed
with the help of corruptible pleasures, it yoaketh base minded men (whose care
is (...) set upon the desire of earthly things) which it presents before
their eyes as their felicity, seeking to defend it self by reason, which
although they be altogether vain and frivolous, yet of great weight, in
regard of the weak flesh of man, which easily suffers it self to be a
bondslaue to sin: we are therefore to take good heed, that we suffer not our
selves to be surprised by so dangerous an enemy, nor to give him any access
or entrance into us. To know then the causes of evils, is the readiest way to
cure them, for a disease known is half cured, and many kingdoms are brought
to ruin by diverse causes, which if they were known to their princes and
governors, they might easily be prevented by providence and reason. The prince
that is careful to see and enquire for the damages of his Realm, it may be
said (if he provide not for them) that he can do no more, but to him that is
negligent to learn them (if he do not provide) it may be said he will do no
more. This has been the cause that thus disguised as you see, I have traueiled
through mine own dominions to see the demeanures of my subjects, that by
gathering a platform of common report, I might be the better able to reform a
common mischief: for the surest Counsailers that belongs to a prince, be his
own eyes and his ears, which must be always vigilaunt: and it is not decent,
that Princes should be Lords over many, and should communicate privately but
with few. By my traueile in the Country I have bettered my experience, to
learn the follies of mine own Court, and omitting to speak of many
alterations, I will but only glaunce at the superfluity of this our present
age, wherein al kind of excess, riot, weltering in pleasures, curiosity in
apparel, perfumes, frisling of hair, not used so much amongst women, as
practiced daily amongst vain men. Should I speak here what intemperance is
used in diet what curious dishes devised for appetite: nay, what filthy
conceits to provoke beastly desire, what several sorts of cates to furnish
forth a banquet, what exces and superfluity, both in meats and drinks, it were
to much for me to tell, and to shameful for you to hear. In the first ages,
the Hebrews used to eat but once a day, which was at diner, so the Gretians
vsd but only to sup, for this cause we read, that Plato being demanded
whether he had seen any strange thing in Sicilia, answered he had found a
monster in diet, which did eat twice a day, happy then might those days be
accounted, that esteemed not of any thing more then was needful, but where
as we have but hitherto looked into the vanity of their attire, and the
curiosity in their diets, with their external follies, let us now but a
little consider of the inward disposition of their minds, and we shall find that
the whole sort of them are desirous of reputation, but by what means do they
speak it, by flattering of Princes, by soothing of great men, by pleaseing of
humors, by carrieng of news, and other like servile demeanures, not fit for an
honest mind to apply it self unto, true honor (indeed) is by no other means
to be atchiued, then by virtuous indevoures: As for those honors that depend
upon the bare oppinion of Princes as they take their beginning without desert,
so they have their ending again at an instant: But as I have gathered by this
soldier Martianus, (in a discourse that he made, before we came to this
place) Princes that are constrained to rely on other men's reports, must use
great diligence, to discern flatterers, and disguisers of matters, and must
likewise use no less circumspection, in bestowing of offices, and giving
rewards: Princes many times gives preferment to their friends to recompense
their friendship, other whiles to their servants to requite their services, and
although it might be said that many Princes do err in distributing their
offices, yet they do not err, for that they would err, yea, and many times
it is seen in cases of promotion, high offices and dignities are rather bought
with money, then deserved by virtue: where in time past, there was no man
areared to honor, but he that deserved it: In former adges, men ofscience
were searched for in strange countries, but now, though they knock at our
gates, they are not suffered to enter, no our corruption and custom draws us
to other delights: This court in elder adge was counted a receptacle of wise
men, but now the common harbor for parasites and flatterers, but as no
vermin breeds where they find no warmth, no vultures stoop where they smell
no pray, no flies swarm where they see no flesh, no pilgrim creepes where
there is no cross, so there is no parasit will lurk where he finds no
gain, and therefore do flatterers praise us, because they would price us, but
I wonder that these great men that have authority in the courts of Princes
should be so generally seduced by flatterers, and so usually carried away, by
these creeping parasites: But being instructed as I am, I doubt not but ere
many days past, I will so scour that rabble from out of this court, that
they shall be glad to seeeke a new haunte: Pretermitting many other follies
entertained in the court, I will conclude with this example used by Alexander
Seuerus as a cauiat to courtiers. This good Emperor having a servant, whom he
much favored, but he abusing, his masters curtisie took great bribes of poor
suitors promising them to be-friende them in their requests: but the Emperor
binding him to a post, caused him to be chooked with smoke, making
proclamation, that they that sell smoke, should dye with smoke. If all the
smoke sellers in every Princes court were thus rewarded, and all the
parrasites in like manner banished, I think the courts of Princes would not
be so fully replenished, nor every greatman so mightily followed.

The one and twentieth Chapter.
The King proceeds in his discourse, what vices he has noted in the country.

BUt do you think that where the court is thus infected with vices, that the
country is not spiced with the same infirmities* O yes you may be sure, and
mine own eyes has been witnesses of many misdemeanurs: I have seen many men
live idly and so utterly unprofitable, some others neither idle nor yet well
occupied, and therefore not sufferable, and what usury does abound in the
City, what extortion and covetous hourding both in town and country, what
pride and ambition in the layty, what simmony and heaping of benefices in the
clargy, what plaintes at the bar, what delays on the benche, what malice to
those that be good, what boulstering of those that be ill, what lack of love
in those that be rich, and what oppression of the miserable poor. This I say
I have seen, and some things your selves have heard by complainte of this
pooreman, Castus, the maiestrat that we have appointed to execute justice* the
lawyer that by profession should be a minister of right; the one of them is
become negligent, the other careless, both corrupt and subject to lucre: they
refuse nothing that is given them openly, the bribe is as much as they can do
secretly, they grievously punish the offenses of the poor, they closelye
dissemble the faults of the rich, and without a (...) it avails no man to
ask justice: a peniles suitor, makes a (...) judge: Cicero complained of his
time, that many notable decrees of laws were corrupted and depraved by the
curicus heads of lawyers: what would he do if he were now alive and saw the
lawyers so vilie poluted, where a thousand cauiles and quidittes are
continually coined. Gainefull to wicked and faithles men that seeks nothing
but deceit, and very prejudicial to good men, who many times had rather
loose their right, then undo them selves by following with such delays, and so
long time by way of justice. To the end therefore, that the disorders whereby
all these vices have been brought into the coinmen wealth, may be plucked up
by the roots: let us all set to our handees, that the entrance may be shut
up against the wicked who are the norishers of all this corruption: for mine
own part, you shall see me so provide, that this sale of offices shall be
abolished, that both judgment and justice, shall be better executed: and that
the ancient and happy ordinances of our predecessors, shall be restored: Now
touching the complaints of my late accusation, I mean Martianus and Castus
my fellow prisoners: what has been awarded in their behalf I do here
ratefie, with a benevolence of a thousand crowns to be divided between them
out of mine own treasure. For thee Gloriosus, that have accused me of treson,
in whom I have found more majesty then good manners, more gravity then wit,
more prattell then proof, yet for that there is nothing beseeming a Prince, to
give place to any wrongs, than to those that are done to his own person: and
as those men are most unworthy their scepters, who cruelly revenge their own
injuries, and pardon such as are done to others: I do here freely forgive
thee for all manner of trespasses that thou have committed against my self:
but for the injury thou have done to these other two, by the wrongful
charging them with a false accusation; I do here presentlye banishe thee the
court, charging thee heare-after not to come within three leagues, until thou
have reformed thy self, in all thy demeanures, manners and conditions.

The two and twentieth Chapter.
How Brusanus was entertained by the King Leonarchus, and after some pleasante
time spent in the court, Brusanus and Dorestus betook themselves to trauaill.

THese things thus performed the people altogether fell into a general
commendation of their king, praising him to be so gentell in conversation, so
patient in injuries, so thankful of benifites, so good to the good, so severe
to the ill, that the king acknowledging their faithful love, thanking them for
their obedience, diligence and service, he arising from his seat, and taking
Brusanus in his arms assured him to be as heartelye welcome to the King
Leonarchus, as ever he had been before to the merchant Corynus: thus
accompanied with Brusanus, Dorestus, and the rest of his Nobility, he departed
to the Court, where he caused a most sumptuous lodgeing to be made ready for
Brusanus: he then proclaimed a general feast* and to be continued for twenty
days: in the mean time, the people had prepared theaters, scaffoulds, and
standings, whereon there was sometimes presented Commedies, Histories, and other
rare inventions: other whiles again the Tilt was frequented, by many brave
courageous knights, so strong and gallantly armed, as might have been judged
that they did rather prepare to incampe themselves for war, then to show
knightly exercises but in sport or pleasure. Brusanus and Dorestus, being
now grown to a mutual love, and both of them desirous to approve their own
valor, came into the listes amongst the rest gallantly mounted, and most
richly armed. Brusanus carrying for his device in a field azure, Cupid, with
both his arms fast pinioned like a malefactor, his bow and arrows broken,
his word was Inuidia Amoris* Dorestus had for his devise in a field argent,
the flying Daphne, in the figure of a Laurel, and the wise Apollo pursuing
Cassandria: his word was Amorvincit omnia: the one of them so quite contrary
to the other, the which although it fell out by adventure, yet sure it did
presage the sequel of that which was to follow.

I do not mean to set you down the sundry exployts performed by these
two gallant Princes: let this suffice, they continually carried away the prize,
to their great commendacion, and to no less wonder to as many as did behold
them, to see so brave incounters against so many hardy knights that were so
well approved, and of so long experience. The perfourmance of these noble
exploytes, did so imbou^^^^ them in their courageous desire, as loathing to
spend their lives in safe or slothful idleness, and more and more desirous to
increase their virtues and experience, determined both together to leave the
Court of Epirus, and to traueile through the world to seek knightly
adventures: with this resolution they came unto the king, craving his allowance
in their determinations: the which at the first, although it were very grievous
unto him, yet to appeaze their hautie desires, and hoping to beguile his
pensive thoughts, with the memory of their worthy acts, he granted to their
requests. There is no more now to be done, but for the princes to prepare
themselves with necessaries fit for their journey, and because they are now
making of their provision, I think it best for a little space to leave them
about their business, when they are ready to set forward, you shall as well
understand of that, as of the rest of their fortunes what happens unto them in
their traueile.

The end of the first Book.
The secon Book, of the adventures of Brusanus.
The first Chapter.
Brusanus and Dorestus after long iournies, ariue at the court of Ileria:
Astulpho King of that Region, has a Son called Antipholus, and a daughter
named Moderna, Moderna casts a liking toward Brusanus, Dorestus falls in
love with Moderna.

THese two princes were long in providing themselves, and now being ready, they
were as long in taking of their leave, and bidding their friends farewell: but
having accomplished all things necessarily, they take their iourny, and
passing through Phrigia, Misina, Leodicia, and Pannouia, they came to Illeria:
And although I post them thus hastily on their way, you must imagine they took
more leisure, and performed so many commendable exploits in their traueile,
that the report of their honorable actions, had a through recourse, even
amongst all Nations and kingdoms in that part of the world. There reigned
now in Illeria, a mighty Prince called by the name of Astulpho, who through
his prowess in all martial exploites, waxed so proud and tyrannous, using
such merciless cruelty to his foreign enemies, and such moodlesse rigor to
his native subjects, that it was doubtful whether he were more feared of his
foes for his cruelty, or hated of his friends for his tyranny: yet as the
worst weed springs up more bravely then the holsomest herb, and as the
crookedst tree, is commonly laden with most fruit: so this rigorous king, was
fostered up with great fortune, his estate established with no less worldly
honor, endued he was with wonderful wealth, and fortunate again with the
like prosperity, but most happiest of all, in a son and a daughter: the son
called by the name of Antipholus, a most gallant young Prince, loved for his
courtesy, reverenced for his virtue, and honored for both, and the heir
apparent to the Crown of Illeria. The daughter called by name Moderna: in
demeanure decent, in countenance so sweet, in face so amiable, in body so
comely, in all her parts so proportionable, that nature might not possibly
afford more beauty in any creature, nor art supply any defect in nature.
Besides all these exquisite perfections, she was the inheritrix to the kingdom
of Dalmatia, by the right of her mother called Persida, the only daughter and
heir to Vrbanus, the late king of Dalmatia, who before his death, gave his
laid daughter Persida unto Astulpho for a second wife, assuring for her dowry
(after his decease) the kingdom of Dalmatia to Astulpho during his life, and
so to the heirs of his body begotten of his daughter Persida, of whom
Astulpho had no other issue but only Moderna, at whose birth Persida died in
childebed, so leaving the inheritance of the kingdom to Moderna, who although
she were but the half sister to Antipholus, yet nature in respect of the
Symphatie of their minds, seemed to have planted but one and the self same
heart, they so entirely loved the one of them the other.

These two Princes being thus come unto the Illerian Court, were very well
welcomed by the King Astulpho, but most kindly entertained by the Prince
Antipholus; and although the honorable exploites of these two gallant Princes
was reported in the court of Illeria, long after their personal ariuall,
which won the hearers to love them before ever they saw them, yet now such
heroycall greatness showed in their eyes, such extraordinary majesty in all
their actions, but especially the goodly presence of Brusanus (in whom such
true valiaunce shined) bred a delight full admiration to all beholders, and now
insinuating themselves into the socrety of the gallant courtiers, they proved
to be in sport so pleasant, in talk so witty, in manners so modest, in
conceytes so cunning, in parle so pithy, and in all their conversation so
comely, that they were generally liked of all, and for a time there was no
other talk in the court, but in the commendation of the two Princes: But
Brusanus besides the beauty of his body, had such a natural dexterity in all
things, as in feats of arms who more hardy, in any exercise of the body,
who more active, in communication or any discourse, who more pleasant, and in
all manner of companies who better esteemed, so that there was no person, time,
or place, whereunto he aptly applied not himself, insomuch that the
familiaryty between himself and Antipholus, did more and more exceed, and it
fortuned that Moderna casting a glaunce, upon the beauty of Brusanus felt a
certain alteration in her affections, and as it were a sudaine assault within
her self, but having small practice in the prankes of love, she could not
conjecture the secret cause of these her sudaine passions, thinking it to be
but some toy lightly taken, and would be again as sudainly left, and upon
this she still rested her self, conceiving yet a good likeing toward
Brusanus, Dorestus on the other side having espied Moderna accompanied with
other Ladies, walking in the fields to take the air, contemplating himself
in the perfection of her beauty, he was taken prisoner before he had leisure
to arm himself, but lo how occasion offered it self to a further mischief:
Brusanus and Dorestus were invited (amongst many other) to a banquet prepared
by Moderna, there was likewise her brother the Prince Antipholus, with many
other Lords and Ladies of the court.

The second Chapter.
The perplexity of Dorestus for the love of Moderna, the like of Moderna for
the love of Brusanus.

DVring the time of this banquet, Dorestus being placed right over against
Moderna, and taking a better views of this perfect blossom of beauty, this
matchless parragon for personage, perfited by nature, and polished by nurture
he was so fettered in the snare of fancy, his fancy so entangled in the trap of
affecting, that his only bless, pleasure, joy, and delight was in
contemplating his eyes on the heavenly face of this Goddess, but alas her
beauty bred his bane, her looks his loss, her sight his sorrow, her exquisit
perfections, his extreme passions: Brusanus in this mean time now and then
enterlarding the dishes with pleasant discourse, was throughlye surueyd by
Moderna, who marking his manners, and musing at his modestye, notinge his
excellent courtesye, and wondering at his exquisit beauty, was so inflamed
with friendly affection toward this young Prince, that where before she
esteemed her likeing to be but the fruits of her gentle nature, she now gave
free scoape to those sweet thoughts, which by this had taken the full
possession of her heart: The banquete once ended, and every one departed,
Moderna shutting her self into her Chamber, discoursed thus: alas poor
Moderna, how art thou bewitched where is thy wonted virtue, have thou prepared
a banquet to entrap thy self with a more delicate dish, then any thou did
provide? have thou laid a bait, and thy self poisoned with the bane? have thou
bid him welcome, that has caught thee captive. Blush Moderna at thy Fortune,
thy thoughts, thy choice, thy love cannot be uttered without shame, nor thy
affections without discredit. But ah Brusanus, ah sweet Brusanus, thy beauty
Brusanus: but peace Moderna, blab not out that which thou may be ashamed to
reveal unto thy self: but thou do love Moderna, yea, and whom? a
stranger Prince, stragled out of his own Country, beautiful enough, but yet
perhaps not stayed in mind, and therefore not fit for thee to fancy. Cease
then Moderna, to look at Brusanus, much less to love him: be not ouer-taken
with these dissembling men, whose eyes are framed by art to allure. Die the^
Moderna, Moderna die: better were it for thee to perish with high desires, then
to live in base thoughts: thus throwing her self upon her bed, drawing the
Curtains, she turned too and fro, as if she would have hidden her self from
her own thoughts. Dorestus again who was departed from the banquet, with a
new field of fancies traueiling in his mind, went directly to his chamber, and
making fast the door, began in this sort to discourse. Ah Dorestus, art thou
alone? O no, not alone, when thou art accompanied with so many unacquainted
passions: alas, what hellish hagge does possess thee, or what frantique
fury does inchaunt thee, that so suddenly thy mind is perplexed with such
several passions? alate free, now fettered: alate swimming in rest, now
sincking in care: ere while in security, now in captivity. Ah Moderna, thy
courtly Majesty without coyness, thy perfect beauty without blemishe, thy
comely demeanure without curiosity, thy sweet and pleasant speeches seasoned
with wit, thy decent mirth tempered with modesty: It is thou, it is thou,
that have thus charmed me, it is thy beauty that has bewiched me. But I will
love, nay I must love, and I will obey because I must obey; ye and beauty must
be obayd, because it is beauty, and framed it was of the gods to feedthe eye,
but alas it formenteth the heart. O love, O divine love, feared of men,
because honored of the gods, not to be suppressed by wisdom, because not to
be comprehended by reason, without law, and therefore above all law, But how
now Dorestus, do thou blaze that with praise which thou should rather
condemn with disgrace, or will thou seem to bless, where thou have cause to
curse, and why should I curse love that am in love, the gods disdained not to
love, Jupiter loved Io, and why should not I then love Moderna: Dorestus, love
her, and in the contemplations let this be reserved in thy prayers, that it
would please the gods to grant Moderna to be still fair, never adged and
Dorestus to love assuredly, and to continue constant: with this resolution, he
bound himself within the limittes of his own chamber, suffering no other
thoughts to have familiarity within his brains, but that which presented
unto him the picture of his beloved.

The third Chapter.
Brusanus comes to visit Dorestus in his lodging, Dorestus makes him
aquainted with his love toward Moderna.

BRusanus, that could not joy out of the company of his dearest friend
Dorestus, and meruailing to find him so obstinent from wonted exercises, that
was accustomed to be so forward in all manner of commendable endeavors,
coming to his chamber, where he found him by himself he said. I have found
in you (worthy Prince Dorestus) a great slacking of your wonted virtues, and
you subject your self to solitariness, the very enemy to nature it self,
and the only hinderance of all good exercises: neither careing for company to
solace your sadness, nor accustoming your self to those delights that whylome
won you commendation, which makes the Gentlemen of the court to imagine they
know not what. Dorestus, although he knew his own fault, yet desirous for a
time to conceal his love: made this answer. I know not (my good Brusanus)
what it pleases the Gentlemen of the court to surmise by my solitarines,
neither would I wish them to impute it to any coy or curious statelines that
is in me, for in so doing they should do me wrong to conjecture of my disease
before they have cast my water. But this solitarines (said Brusanus) cannot
free you from suspicion, nor defend you from melancoly, being thus alone by
your self: and respecting our undertaken attempt, is it not time that we
leave the Illerian court, prosecuting our Iournye as we first pretended:
Dorestus who all this while had his mind fixed on an other devotion, hearing
Brusanus to speak of leaving the Illerian court, gave a sudaine start at the
very word, breathing out a pitious sighe, answered thus: O Brusanus, does not
the pleasure of the court render sufficient recompense for our time spent in
it, me thinks your very eyes should receive such contentment, that you should
not seek now to depart, when your only counsel may work my greater
relief, then mine own reason is able to render: Behold Brusanus, I do
challeng that courtesy at thy hands which erst thou did promise with thy
heart, in perfourmance whereof thou shall ease some part of my sorrow, and
prove thy self faithful to thy friend, these speeches he delivered with a
gesture governed by the force of his passions, thus ended his discourse
listining what Brusanus would answer, who noting his words spoken with such
vehemence, did rather increase new doubts, then give him ground to settell
any judgment, but yet wonderfully dismayed, to see this alteration in him whom
he so dearly loved, made this answrere. Where in may Brusanus steed you, that
you may not command him, but the manner of your speeches are so straung unto
me, as I know not where in I may pleasure you nor what I should answer you:
Ah Brusanus (said Dorestus) if the violence of love have ever taken hold of
you, I hope my case shall never want pity in your consideration, you would
have me leave this court, but alas I am so surely fettred that I can not away,
you would have me free, that am already so imprisoned as there is no other
redress to purchase liberty, but only by her mercy that has caught me
captive: Moderna, Brusanus Moderna, ah Moderna (without superstition be it
spoken) is the adored gooddesse of my amorous devotions, the emperious mistress
of my martired heart, whose beauty is my bliss, whose sweet countenance, is
my soul comfort, to whom more then to my self, I only desire to live.

The fourth Chapter.
Brusanus persuades Dorestus to shake off his fits of love, Dorestus resolves
to submit himself a prisoner to love and beauty.

BRusanus, who by this time had sounded the very deapth of his intention, both
what he said, and with what mind he spoke it, was stricken into a sudden
amazement, but immediately recovering his spirits, he said: Is this Dorestus
the only young prince of the world, noted for his virtue, that so suddenly
should martch under the banner of Venus, the very first down step to all grief
and sorrow. O Feminine love, what power hold thou in men's hearts, being
(indeed) so far off from love, that I rather think it a doting frenzy, rouing
headlong upon impossibilities, engendered indeed betwixt lust and idleness, his
associates and chiefest companions, are pain, travel, anger, rage, fury, dout,
grief, languish, threatening, despair, uncertain hope, his surest good, a
certain base weakness, his fruits are laborsome adventures, nay, rather
loathsome misaduentures, which either will bring forth il success, or no
success: so conclude, love is in nothing more constant, then in tormenting his
professors.O remember your self then Dorestus, if not for my sake that am sorry
to see your passions, yet for your own sake, that even now remains in
ieoperdy: purge your head of this infection, weaue not the web of your own
woe, spinne not the thread of your own thraldom, it is better to beware by
others mishappes, then by repentance of your own follies: hazard not at that
which cannot be had without harm, stretch not too far, wade not too deep,
use beauty but serve it not, taste wine but surfeit not, warm thee by the fire
but burn thee not. Take heed therefore, and dwell nor long in this temptation,
when it is neither convenient for your honor, your body, nor your profit.
Dorestus that was stricken in a dumpe with these admonitions, answered again.
You handle me Brusanus, as a crabbed mother, that when her child has caught a
fall, she whippes the tail to make amends, but if you find your self an
Apostata to love, or that you have displaied the flagge of defiance against
fancy: can you not use your liberty to your self, but you must use it, as if
you would vantingly martch over your friends misery: O Brusanus, things are
sone promised, but not so hastily performed, it is easy to sound the
victory, but very hard to obtain the conquest: all can say we would
overcome, but few or none return with triumph. Love is a God and will be
obaid, and looks to command, not to be conquered, and beauty cannot be
resisted: dare reason abide the brunt, where beauty bids the battle, can
wisdom win the field, where love commands as captain? O no, no: love is
without law, and therefore above all law: honored in heaven, feared in
earth, and a very terror to infernal ghosts. Lord how wise you be (answered
Brusanus) in framing propositions to deceive but your self: if love be
lawless (as you infer) it is lewd: if without limits, lascivious: if
contained within no bounds, beastly: if observed with no order, odious: so
that lawless love without reason, is the very loadstone to ruth and ruin.
How can you then imagine the effect to be good, when the subject is naught,
or how can you so clearkely defend your desperate motion, proceeding from
such a fond and foolish occasion: But you will say it was the perfection of
her comelye person, her exquisite feature and rare beauty that kind led your
desire. But remember Dorestus, beauty no sooner slorisheth, but it as quickly
fades, it is not fully ripe, before it begin to rot: it is no sooner out of the
budde, but it withers in the blossom. If then beauty be so fading, so
fickle, so momentarie, so withering, so wauing, sone passed and so sone
parched, is this the Jewel that you make so dear off, is this the Iemme that
you would purchase with so great danger, consider again, al beautiful
things are not precious, Mercury is milk white, but deadly poison: the
gloworme, is bright in the hedge, but black in the hand, the Panther has a
painted skin, but a devouring paunche: the Serpent is pleasing to the eye, but
pestilent to al our other parts: and he that takes to much delight to gaze on
beauty, shall sometimes be gauled with to much grief. Yet I say not nay, but
that love may have a certain childishe vehemence: but if lovers were not
charmed with some secret inchauntment, they would be able either to keep their
fancies for being inflamed, or else to cool desire being already blinded: for
the days they spend in thoughts the nights in dreams, both in griefs,
either beguylinge them of that they had, and promising, that they are never
like to find: their heads fraught with fantisies, fixed with ielosies,
troubled with both: yea so many inconveniences wait upon love, as were infinite
to reckon them all, and to much intolerable (for a reasonable man) to taste but
one: being always begun with grief, continued with sorrow, and ended with
death: and albeit the pleasure passes away in a trise, no sooner done but
forgotten, and the punishmente is permanent, yet so delightful is the present
sweet, that they never remember the following sour. The time is yet to com
wherein many thorns are not found amidst the roses of marriage. Marius the
Roman, asked Metellus why he would not take his daughter to wife, seeing she
was beautiful in body, staide in countenance, eloquent in speech, noble by
race, rich in doury, happy in good name and adorned with sundry virtues: to
whom the other replide that he knew all this to be true, yet (quoth he) I had
rather be mine own then hers. An other good fellow on a time, advised his
friend not to marrye his son before he were wise: (was thus answered) be not
deceived my friend (quoth the other) if my son once grow to be wise, he will
never marry: now Dorestus if you had a will that enticed you to love, recover
now a wit to se the error in love, better counsel can you not have, more
holsom advise I cannot give, if you carry an obstinat ear, you hurt but your
self, if you accept of my curtisie I profer it friendly, if you take it as I
mean it, you will follow it willingly. Dorestus that stood all this while
with a flea in his ear, at last made answer. I se Brusanus, that love and
beautye are little beholding to you but that eye that loatheth to behold
beauty, is unworthy to contemplate the heavens: what appetite more earnestly to
be sought after then beauty, which conceiueth no blemish and concerns the
light of the body. But fortune I now most humbly thank thee, for the
recomforting me with the delightful remembrance of the beauty of my mistress,
making me pertaker of that contemplation which is heavenly: the memory whereof
is a present restoritiue to all encumbrances that you have hitherto feared me
with, and a sufficient defensatiue, to any misfortune, that can heere-after
befall me: but it is against reason Brusanus, so uncharitably to exclaim
against those, without whom our life though never so luckie should seem most
loathsome, and so preiudicially to contemn those heavenly creatures, whose
only sight is a salve against all hellishe sorrows: If thou did know
Brusanus, the joy, the comfort, and recreation that is conuersante with
beautye, thou would do penance and marter thy self, for abusing so high
an estate as Cupid is. Truly (quoth Brusanus) thou art worthy Dorestus to be a
chapman, that will bid so well for thy chaffer: But I would mine own
experience had never served me to judge so well of wemens manners, that
sometimes adicted my self wholly to their service, and spent my life in the
lappes of Ladies, wasting my goods to maintain their bravery, and my wit to
follow their folly. Oh how curious have I been to please my Lady, but how
careless to serve my Lord, O that I had been more careful in avoiding wemens
company, and less cunning in disciphering their vanity: But if beauty be the
mark that you shoot at Dorestus, take heed, for many vices of the mind, are
covered under this veil of beauty, and it has brought commodity to very
few, but they are not to be numbered, that it has brought to utter
destruction: O shun Dorestus, shun I say this sugered mischief, be not
longer obstinat, let not your virtues decrease, shake of this collor of
incumberance, be not subjected by love, nor seduced by lust, no error shall
then mislead you, no foolish fancy shall feed you, no woman shall besotte you,
no vice shall withdraw you, no glaring beauty shall entice you, and what
knowledge but shall serve you: Dorestus that had his mind traveled with two
extreme passions, the one of love toward his mistress, the other of grief to
hear these words of Brusanus, after he had a while chafed to himself, he
mildly made this answer: It is pity Brusanus, that wit should be no better
employed, then in the contempt of beauty, the dispraise of love, the dispite
of women, and in the disparagement of their honors, but I cannot so lightly
be induced, to mislike of that sex of whom I was borne, of whom I received
life, by whom I have bin nursed and charely brought up, and women are framed
of nature, with as great perfections of the mind, for the exercise of virtue,
as men, but what soever fall out* I am fully resolved in my self, either to
win the spurs or loose the horse, to have the blossom or loose the fruit, to
enjoy the beauty of Moderna, or to ieoperd my best joint, and therefore, what
so ever the learning wills, I will consent to nature, what so ever the laws
of philosophy persuades me, I will at this time give the raines of liberty to
my amorous passions, and what so ever be the chance, I will cast at all, God
send you good fortune (said Brusanus) but I fear me it will never be in love:
By this time the yoonge Prince Antipholus was come to the chamber door, calling
both Brusanus and Dorestus, to walk out, and to use some exercise until it
were supper time, to the which Brusanus willingly agreed, but Dorestus framing
a slight excuse remained still in his chamber, and being thus alone, he
recalled to his mind the several speeches past between Brusanus and himself,
and now having better leisure to consider of every circumstaunce, resolved not
so slightly to let pass the reasons of Brusanus, but like a champion in the
defense of women, taking pene, incke and paper, thus he writes.

The fifth Chapter.
Dorestus Prince of Epirus, to Brusanus, the professed enemy to love and beauty.

THe philosophers ( Brusanus) amongst their preseptes of good counsels, were
accustomed very bitterly to reprehend the bouldnes of the tongue: this well
considered, were sufficient to condemn your bitter inuectiues, seeking to
bereue us of that comfort, without the which the depopulation of the world
would follow, you dispraise women, who at the first were created by the
almighty himself to be a helper unto man, does it not then follow that as the
creator, is more worthy they ye things created, tha^ the helper should in like
manner be of greater moment then the matter helped: The better to confirm our
argument and to prove women the more perfet creature, let us consider of the
substance whereof she was created: It cannot be denaid, but metal the oftener
it is fined, the purer it is made, then is it not as certain, that man being
framed of the dust of the earth, and was yet made good, that woman being drawn
from metal thus already purified, should be a great deal the better: here
is now to be considered, the goodness of the creator, that having framed a
pattern of such perfection, would cuple her as a companion to unthankful man,
whose proud nature, not able to brook equality, has even from that time,
until this very instant, sought to reign over women, with an usurped
prerogative, and to eclips their virtues, with slanderous and false reports:
it might have pleased god even then to have cupled man to a lion, to a tiger,
to a serpent, or some other such, but he linked him to a woman, he gave man a
woman to be a comfort unto him, to the intent therefore, and the rather that
man should be induced to their imbracementes, has not nature adorned them
with perfection of beauty, delicacy of body, excelency of wit, and such
sweetness in all their demeanures, that men of any judgment, and able to
discern of such inestimable riches, do they not whet their wits, their
wills, their tongues and all their whole inventions, how to comprehend their
favor, and to insinuate themselves into their grace: yea they do add
increase of courage to men of little hardines, making them to be more valiant
and venturous in arms, to be brief they are the very pictures of comelines,
the vesseles of sobriety the ornaments of beauty, and the very images of
continency modesty and virtue, whose natural property (in any injury done them)
is either to excuse or to pardon: and here making a sparing conclusion of
their unspeakable commendations, let me persuade thee Brusanus, to leave thy
misdeeming of so precious a treasure, for whom we are borne, and not for our
selves, and by whom we are again revived in our posterity, and not of our
selves: Dorestus, having finished this discourse, sealing it up in the manner
of a Letter, sent it the next day to Brusanus, who perusing the contents, and
having with Euripides, proclaimed himself an open enemy to woman-kinde, he
determined to stand fast by his takling, and to send Dorestus such an answer,
as he should not easily be able to avoid: and being thus rather fraught with
collar, then furnished with good matter: he betook himself to his pen,
where we will leave him for a while, and speak of other matters.

The sixth Chapter.
Dorestus bewraieth his love to Moderna, she utterly refuses he unfolds his
pretense to the king her father, who grants to give him Moderna for his wife.

DOrestus, that was now at leisure to cast about to bring his purpose to a
desired success, and wading between small hopes, and huge dispaires, yet
remembering that nothing could be atchiued that was never attempted, he
determined to give the on set: and finding Moderna in a place convenient,
nesling himself so near her as he might: to whom speaking in looks, for as
yet his tongue was not come to a through boldness, and yet by the many services
he proffered her, she might well perceive, that although he wanted power, yet
he wanted no will to please her: thus determining to present his suit, when
he came to the point, fear of offense, and dread of denial, disappointed his
purpose, that he remained mute: but at the last, perceiving delay bred
danger, houering between hope and fear, finding his mistres at so good
conuenience, he began in this manner to display to Moderna, the storehouse of
his deadly desires. My extreme affection (most worthy Princess Moderna) will
either break out in words, or break my heart with silence: but it has at the
last enforced me to appeal unto your courtesy, as the only medicine that may
cure my intolerable sickness: nay, incurable I may well call it: for unless
the fruitful shows of your mercy, do mittigate the fire of my fancy: the
drops of your princely favor, quench ye flame of my affection: and the guerdon
of your good will, give a sovereign plaster for my secret sore, I am like to
continue in endless misery. Since then my care proceeds from your beauty, let
my sore be cured by your bounty: since the perfection of your person has
wrought my bale, let the effect of your courtesy procure my bliss, and reject
him not with rigor, that respects you with reverence: loath him not with
hate, that loves you in heart: it is your beauty that has deprived me of
liberty, and it is your bounty that must redeem me from captivity: and if my
rashness be a fault in presuming thus to trouble you, let your beauty bear
the blame, which is the spur to mine enterprise. Moderna, that had vowed her
self to another saint, and hearing a fresh assault given to her heart which
was already conquered: thought it not good for his stomach, to give him a
surfeit of too much favor, answered thus. Sir, as I can perceive, your sickness
threatens no danger of death, and if it be but a love matter, the fit will
soon be past: but alas, your conueiance was nothing cleanly: if you had not
the outside of love to cover your inside of lust: but be it love, or be it
lust, Dorestus take this for an answer, I have vowed virginity, I mean to live
chaste, cease then to crave that cannot be gotten, seek not for vnpossibilities,
you say my beauty was the spur to your enterprise, let my words then make you
desire to leave of your suit. I will not feed you with delays, nor entertain
you with fair words, and foul deeds, but speak as I think, and so you
shall find it, and what soever you shall reply, my defense shall be to believe
nothing: but yet least you should think me too much unthankful, though I
cannot inwardly mittigate your miserye, I will yet teach you an outward
plaster, the which being applied, you shall find a great virtue, to assuage
the heat of that love, which you say is so pesterous and troublesome unto you,
and thus follows the medicine. Take two ounces of the sound of a bell when it
is roong for a man's soul that died for love, as much of the neighing of a
horse, that has brought his Master from Dunmo with a Flitche of Bacon, then
take the parings of any man's nails that is full four and twenty years old,
and never flattered woman: grind these to fine powder in a winde-mill that
stands in the bottom of a Fish-poole, then take half a pint of the water
that is wiped from a man's eyes at the burial of his wife, put to a handful of
a Lovers protestations made to his Lady without dissimulation: boil all these
together upon a few coals, then strain it through the lining of any man's
gown that has been married full out a year, and never quarrelled with his
wife, put to but one dram of good conscience, drawn from him that married his
wife more for love of her virtue, then for the lucre of her dowry: use this
plaster wise, laid warm to your left heel at night when you go to bed, and my
life for yours, it shall both bring you into quiet sleep, and rid you of this
incumbraunce that does so trouble your head with love. Dorestus, to whom every
syllable she pronounced was a thunderbolt, again answered. Alas, let not
certain immaginatiue rules, whose truth stands but on opinion, keep back
your pity and mercy. O Moderna, for thin own virtues sake, let not my miseries
be quited with disdain: I plainly lay my death before you: yea, the death of
him that loves you, the death of him whose life you may save: O tread not of a
soul that submits it self at your feet: let not your noble heart put a
doubt, till occasion be offered: mistrust not him whom you shall never find
haulting: If there has been a trothlesse Jason, yet there was found a trusty
Troylus: and as there has been a dissembling Damocles, was there not yet a
loyal Lelius: since then my safelye only consistes in your mercy, I humbly
beseech you to take pity upon him, who is either to be made happy or hapless,
as it shall please you to awarde. Moderna, not longer able to tarrye the
hearing of more words, arose from her seat and gave him this for a farewell:
Dorestus, to make you happy with mine own mishappe, I neither can nor
will, to love him whom I cannot like, were but to wrest against my self, to
flatter him whom I mean not to fancy, is but a trick of extreme folly: no
Dorestus, it is not possible to persuade me to enter league with fancy, that am
a foe to affection, or to follow Venus, that am vowed to Diana, I mean not to
love, least I live by the loss, and she that is free and will be fettered is a
fool, thus Dorestus you know my mind and so farewell: and away she goes
leaving Dorestus, at his meditations: who seeing the manner of Moderna, was
driven to use patience perforce, thinking her sharp answer very hard to be
disgested: but after he had a while paused on the matter, he burst out into
these speeches: But by the sweet, ( Dorestus) how should thou know the
sower: but by the black, how should thou know the white, he never
acompteth of prosperity, which has not been before pinched with adversity,
which perchance Moderna, means to make me try by experience: thinking to
feed me with bitter broathes, minding heere-after to give me a Cullice of
better comfort: first to daunte me with the ranging storms of denial, that
the calm of her consent may the more content me: to make me taste the bitter
pills of annoy, here-after to diet me with confections of sweeter joy: for the
chilling cold of winter, makes the spring time seem more pleasante: so the
frowning looks of Moderna, will make her smiling countenance seem more
cheerful: then cease not Dorestus to pursue thy suit with endless pain,
either to enjoy her curtisie, or taste of her crewelty, to thy great happiness,
or extreme heaviness: Dorestus being settled in his determination, thought it
convenient for his better speed, to break the matter to the king her father,
and to crave his consent and furtherance in the cause: hoping that if he could
win him, he should find Moderna the more tractable, and thinking it not for the
best to make long delay, he determined in the morning to put in practice his
pretense, and going to bed thinking to take his rest for that night, he was no
sooner laid down, but the picture of his beloved presented it self, to his
imagination, then calling again to his remembrance, her crabbed aunsweres,
and her flat denial to love: the hight of all ougly sorrows, did so horribly
appear before his amassed mind, that he could take no rest: then began he in
this manner to complain, O love, do thou not think the day torment
sufficient, but thou do envy me in the nights quiet: will thou give my
sorrows no truce: and Moderna, is thy beauty utterly void of pity, do
thou disdain to help his ague, whose Cotidian fit, is converted to a frenzy,
alas, love wanting desire makes the mind desperate, and fixed fancy bereaved
of love, turns into furye, the loyoll love I bear to Moderna, and the
loathsome fear of her ingratitude, the deep desire which inforceth my hope,
and the deadly despair which infringeth my hap, so trauelleth my mind with
contrary cogitations, that death were thrice more welcome then thus to linger
in dispairing hope: ceassing further speches, he lay all the rest of the might
tumbling, and tossing without any manner of sleep: in the morning very early,
making him self ready, and finding the king walking in a pleasant garden
(which usually he was wonted to do) he unfolded to the king, the love that he
bare to his daughter Moderna, humbly beseching his furtherance in his suit,
proffering so larg conditions, as pleased the king so well, that he not only
promised his own good will, but also assured him to win Moderna to consent.

The seventh Chapter.
Dorestus triumphs before the victory, the King persuades his daughter to
take Dorestus for her husband, she cunningly dissembleth with the King her
father.

DOrestus receiving these joyful news began in this manner to triumph: what
greater prosperity (quoth he) can happen unto any earthly wight, then if he be
crossed with care to find a medicine to cure his calamity, then if he be
pinched with pain, to get a plaster for his passion: if he be drenched in
distress, to find a means to mittigate his misery: which I see by proof
performed in my self, these comfortable speeches, having now salued my
forepassed sorrows, those honye sweet words have now so healed my wounds;
that where before I was plagued in perplexity, I am now placed in felicity;
wherbefore I was opressed with car, I am now refreshed with comfort, O
friendly fortune, if from henceforth thou furiously frown upon me, if thou
daunt me with disaster mishap: this thy friendly courtesy shall be sufficient to
counteruaill al future enormity In this manner Dorestus rejoiced to himself, I
will not say triumphed before the victory, the sequel will manifest yt to him
that he is desirous to understand. The king that was especially well pleased to
make Dorestus his son in law, and willing to let slip no time, the very same
day after dinner, sent for his daughter Moderna into his own chamber, to whom
he used these words. Moderna, as I have been careful to bring thee up a
virgin, so I am desirous to make thee a wife: for as I know, there is nothing
more commendable then virginity, so I am not ignorant, that there is nothing
more honorable then matrimony: for if virginity be pleasing to one marriage is
profitable to many: and as I have used these speeches to persuade thee to
marriage, so I would have him that should match with thee, to be such a one, in
whose society thou should not count marriage a bondage, but a freedom: not
a knot of restraint, but a bond of liberty: one whom thou should like for
his beauty, and love for his virtue. To come then from the general to a
particular, it is Dorestus which I wish to be thy husband, and thou to be his
wife: nay, Dorestus is the man that I am determined shall be thy husband, a
Prince worthy to be beloved, and the gemme which is gallant in color, and
perfect in virtue, is the more precious, the herb which has a fair bark,
and a sweet sap, is the rather to be esteemed: Thus thou know my mind
Moderna, and the only care that I now have, is to see thee married before I
die, and thou wax old: Moderna was driven into such a maze with this sudden
motion of her father, as she knew not what answer to shape, for she meant
nothing less the^ to yield to his request, having vowed in her conceit as
before you have heard. And to make denial, she thought would either incur
displeasure, or move superstition: but her father listening what she would
say, she thought in this manner to have stopped his mouth, and thus she answered.
Most sovereign Prince, and gracious father, as I know there is no greater bond
then duty, nor no straiter law then nature: for disobedience in youth, is
often galled with dispight in age: the commandment of the father, ought to
be a constraint to the child: for parents wills are laws, so they pass not al
laws, but this does especially make me to muse, that in my tender years, my
infancy being not able to receive your father lie counsel, your grace then
preferred virginity as the only ornament wherewith to adorn me, and now in
my riper years would you dissuade me from that, whereunto your self has
already settled my mind: pardon me sir, I beseech you, and give me leave to
continue this state which I now hold as the only thing that I account dear
and precious unto me: for although (as you say) marriage be honorable, yet
it is a thing that comes by course, whereas virginity is no less admirable,
and is a precious jewel given us by grace: To love, is the only thing that I
do hate* and I hope, the fatherly care you took in my youth to bring me up in
virtue, shall be still continued, finding me addicted to the same. Moderna
answered the king, what-soeuer persuasion I used in thine infancye, I know they
were such, as fitting for thy years: but thou art yet young, and I am old: and
age has taught me, that which thy youth cannot conceive: thy youth warns me
to prevent the worst, and mine age to provide the best: actions measured
betime, are seldom bitten with repentance: I confess virginity to be good,
but marriage is necessary: yield then to thy fathers persuasions which may
prevent thy perrils. I have chosen thee a husband, fair by nature, royal by
birth, famous by virtue, learned by education, Dorestus by name: he I say, the
Prince of Epirus, it is he, and no other that I have determined shall be thy
husband, settle thy self therefore to like of thy fathers choice, who knows
best what is fit for thee: thus leaving his daughter for the time, who
departing into her own chamber, where this new occurant gave her fresh
occasion, thus to revive her former lamentations. O virtue, either I have
hither too had but a shadow of thee, or thou thy self art but a shadow: but
seek Moderna, seek to assuage this flame and to quench this fire, which as it
comes without cause, so it will consume without reason, if thou will thus give
the rains of thy liberty to thy frantic affections, medicine will come to
late when the disease will grow incurable: but can I deny, what the destinies
have decreed, is it in my power to pervert that which the Planets have placed,
or to resist that which the stars have ordained: what need I use so many
words, I am not the first, neither shall I be the last, that have been thus
wroong with this fit of frenzy: thy father would be contented thou could
love, and thou therefore discontented because thou do love: I, but thy
father would have thee so to love Dorestus the Prince of Epirus: I, but thou
art in love with Brusanus, the Prince of Hungaria: Why, then thou love a
Prince as noble, as virtuous, as famous, as learned, as beautiful, and every
way as worthy as Dorestus is: Love him still then Moderna, love him still,
what, will thou prefer thy fathers will before thine own liking, or thy
fathers liking before thine own love? No, no, do not so: choose for thy
self, whatsoever be thy chance, follow thine own content, care not for the
rest, thou can but repent: but fool that thou art, where be thy wits? art
thou sure all this while, that Brusanus will like of thee? Thou love him, but
how do thou think he will requite it, thou stoopest without a stalle,
thou come without call, yea, and to an empty fist: O lawless love, O
witles will, O fancy full fraught with frenzy. But why do thou move doubts
Moderna? misdeeming either Brusanus or thy self: shall the reward of love be
loathing? does good will deserve hatred? or fancy defiaunce: or what is there
in thee that Brusanus should mislike. Art thou not a Princess, as he is a
Prince? I, but his perfection has made thee imperfect. But, art not thou the
next heir to the kingdom of Dalmatia, it is that Moderna, it is that: thou
have now hit it, that makes Dorestus so much to love, and will bring Brusanus
to stoop to thy lure, fear not then Moderna, for she is acceptable to every
man that brings a Crown for her dowry. Moderna settling her self in this
resolution, so much the more armed her determinations as she saw her self
assailed by her fathers constraint: yet still remembering she must wade
between constancy and courtesy: she therefore of policy used some better
countenance to Dorestus, sometime baiting his hope with a dish of little
certainty: neither comforting him with too much kindness, nor utterly
dismaying him with too rough repulses: and now her only care consisted, how
she might with modesty make her love known to Brusanus, the which with all
speed she intended to put in practice. In this mean while, Brusanus, who had
been long at his study, was prepared with an answer to send unto Dorestus:
the tenor whereof insueth in this manner.

The eight Chapter.
Brusanus Prince of Hungaria to Dorestus, a maintainer of feminine flattery.

I Perceive ( Dorestus) that between us the old saying is like to be
verified, which is, that one fable draws on another. And here I cannot a
little wonder to think, what humor should draw Dorestus to praise those for
the only paragons of the world, that in truth are the very out-castes of
nature, who since their first creation to this present, there was never any man
(of upright judgment) that durst be so foolish-hardy, as once to bestow of
them a general commendacion: those only excepted, whose foolish affections
drowned in the seas of folly, are thereby made partial, in the behalf of
their mistres: but where blind men must judge of colors, there is ill
painting, and where lovers dare speak in the behalf of women, there reason is
enforst to play banckrout. But if Dorestus, to try what he could do in a bad
matter, would therefore write in the praise of women, as Erasmus wrote a book
in the praise of folly: here is now the old proverb neglected. It were better
to be idle, then ill occupied: and although I mean but slightly to run over
your sorry allegations, yet I hope you will not turn my modesty unto want of
matter, but in seeking confirmation from the Philosophers for the commendations
of women, would seek the testimony of the Iurye that had al ready pronounced
him guiltye: or like a mad man that would power on a paile of water when he
meant to make the fire burn: But shall I make repetition of their several
opinions, and what they have written touching women in general. Marcus
Aurelius, that noble Emperor, and worthy orator has these sentences: There is
not so fierce and perilous an enemy to man, as his own wife: Women be of a
tender condition, they will complain of a small grief, and for less cause
will rise into great pride, hardye is that woman that dare give council to a
man, but he is a fool that will ask it, but he most foolish that will follow
it: It is natural for a woman, to despise those things that are proffered
unasked, so it is death to be denied of that she demands: There is no
creature that more desires honor and worse keeps it, then does a woman:
women for a little good, look for great hire, but for much evil, no
chasticement. Thus far Marcus Aurelius, and this might suffice, if men were not
wilful, but I know that neither the dignity of his person, being an
Emperor, nor the reputation of his wisdom, being a Philosopher were
sufficient to guarde him, but they would so taunt and rail at him, as he were
not worthy to wear his mistres colors, that could not find out some name of
reproach in disgrace of the Emperor: I will therefore accompany him, with
such accomplices, as shall be able to stand by him in all assaults, and we
will first begin with Senica, who has these words: Inconstancye is a common
infirmity both to children and women, the one through slendernes of wit, the
other as a natural sickness: Give thy wife no power over thee, for to day if
thou suffer her to treat upon thy foot, to morrow she will sure tread upon
thy head: Diogenes: they that had rather be conuersante with women then with
men, are like swine that had rather be rooting in dirt and mire, then in fair
and clean water: Beware of the baits of women, which are laid out to catch
men, for they are great hinderaunces, to him that desires wisdom: Plutarche
sweet savors and oiles are more fit for women then for men, because they smell
of folly: Hermes, beautye in wemens faces, and folly in their lives, be two
evils, that fretteth life, and rests goods: Protegines, in three points
women and fools be of like condition, for they are full fo vain affections,
curious and peuish to please, and very wilful in foolishnes: Plato: a woman is
a necessary evil, wemens company, a michseefe that cannot be shunned:
Socrates: women are more pitiful then men, more envious then a serpent, more
malicious then a tirante, more deceitful then the devil: Aristotle: women in
mischief are wiser then men: Chylon: he that haunteth much wemens company,
cannot be strong, nor he rich that delights in wine: Pithagoras: there are in
wemens eyes two kinds of tears the one of grief, the other of deceit:
Tertullian: a notable Doctor and pillar of the church with whom we will
conclude, says thus: woman was the first forsaken of Gods law, the discloser
of the forbiden tree, and the gate of the devil: Tell me now Dorestus, how
can you commend treachery for truth, vanity for verity, and ougly vice for
seemly virtue, or will you yet condemn me for an evil speaker: But because
woman was given to be a helper unto man, must it therefore follow that the
helper is more worthy then the thing helped: then must it needs fall out that
the grome that helps Dorestus of with his hose when he goes to bed at night,
is of better rekoning then Dorestus himself, and the slave that but carries
lime and stone to the building, is to be preferred before the master workman:
but I will grant Dorestus, that women he helpers, for he that follows them a
pace, they lightly help him to the devil: Your comparison for the fining of
metals, I cannot mislike, for that it has some affinity with the truth: for
in deed, the more mettales be fined the purer they prove, and gold before it
be brought to his perfection, is first cleansed from his earthlye substance, and
being once drawn from his ore and dros^e, it then remains a metal, but yet
vnpure, because it is mixed with brass or copper, wherefore of necessity there
must be a forced refining, and then the gold is perfect and remains in price:
the brass or copper is likewise a metal, though of a far baser condition,
and therefore is referred for our mean and ordinary necessity: (...) when
man was first framed from out the slime and dust of the earth, he was not yet
perfect gold, for why there remained brass and copper, that is humor and
passion, wherefore it was convenient there should be a second clensing, which
being once performed, man was then in full perfection, and of the grosser
substance there was framd a baser creature women being drawn from the parts
where our affections lie hiden, and as she was thus endued with infinite
passion, so it was necessary to take from her all force, for had she had
abillitie to have performed her cruelty and rage, all the deuels in hell had
not been able to have ruled her, and therefore (according to the old proverb)
God sendes a curste cow short horns: But was it such a benifit for man to be
cupled to a woman, rather then to a Lion, to a Tiger or a Serpent, no truly,
woman is more furious then a lion, more cruel then a tiger, more venimus then
a serpent, and more subtle then the devil: and by her figured charms brought
man from that blessedness in the which he was first created, when the devil
himself was not able to do it: But to what sort of men is it that women be so
acceptable, forsooth to lovers, let us directly then seek out whereto love
leads us: The love of men to women being a rage exceeding all other passions,
makes us forsake the love of God and to imagine our good to rest in them, as if
we should do worship to Idols, whose nature is under vain resemblances, to
corrupt the devotion of men, a thing so common in example, that (to a sencible
judgment) a slender rehearsal may suffice) and who so ever treads that
desperate laborinth of love, is in ordinary destiny, of a wise man to take the
habit of a fool, of a careful man to become negligent: of a valiant man to
become so weak as to stand in awe of a foolish woman's word, of a provident man
to loose all policy: of a young man to become withered, of a free man to
become miserably bound, of a mild man to bear the burden of an ass: of a
religious man to become an Idolater: of a rich man honored, a poor man
scorned: of a patient man to be a revenger of the filthy causes of his minio^:
to be brief both to forget god and loose ye knowledge of himself: I never knew
any one truly translated into the stat of a perfect lover, but after he had
possessed his actual felicity in love did not atend inward perplexities with
outward disquietnes, confused counsels, careless execution, broken speech,
unsound judgments, yea, such a general negligence in all his actions and
conversation of life, that in a due consideration of the affects of love, in
his example it might easily be discerned, there is more galle then honey,
less pleasure then pain, more care then comfort, and more want of courage,
then due commendation of a noble mind. I have heard of many that were mad for
love* yet I never heard of any that were wise in love, I have known the wise
have been besotted by fancy, yet I never knew fancy that made a wise man: for
it is no more possible, that love should be without passion, then the Sun
without light, fire without heat, or water without moisture, whose pleasant
motions are mixed with wonderful disquiet, his little pleasure with piles of
sorrow, his small brooks of transitory joy, with great rivers of extreme
anguish: In love, what seeeth the eye? lasciuiousnes: what hears the ear?
lasciuiousnes: what inureth the body? lasciuiousnes: the badge of love idleness,
the best rest corrupt delights* the final end repentance. Love is a bitter
sweet, a poisoned bait, a golden hook, a contumelious comfort, a devilish
intent. In love we misspend our time, consume our goods, wast our lands, yea,
we do corrupt both body and soul. By love, our hearts are blinded, our
understanding dulled, our memories mangled, our bodies distempered, and all
desire of wisdom is set at a bay. Thus the pore lover finds his pleasure
translated into a quality of bitterness, and his hope so turned into despair,
that he has no other refuge then in death, and yet in him he hardly finds
medicine. If he be but a little disgraced of his body, he becomes wild of
countenance, unquiet in mind: yea, his whole state so restless, as if he
were tormented with some hurtful spirit, and in the absence of his mistress,
you shall never see him settled in any company, or pla^^ of what value or
worthiness soever it be, but as vacabonds without a warraunt, or people fearing
the fall of the firmament, they run here and there, as though their safety
consisted only in the eye of their mistress: Peradventure, there be some that
will mistake my meaning, thinking this love that I would seem to disgrace, is
but dishonest liking, or rather as it may be termed lawless lust, such as is
practiced with every mercenarie woman: but take love when it is lawfully meant,
wherein it is best to be admitted, and use women in their purest kind,
whereunto they were first created, and you shall find, that there is not so
much care in the one, but there is as great combre in the other: and that the
one bredeth not so much wrack, but the other brings as much woe: and where
they both do but promise us a dram of delight they will surely pay us with
a pound of despite. For the institution of marriage, I confess it to be good:
nay further, I acknowledge it to be honorable, and it was first ordained to a
most godly purpose, which was to keep men from that filthy sin of
fornication: but what men, such as were not able to contain their fleshly
desires within the limits and bounds of chastity, for as it is said, chastity
is the beauty of man's souls, and it is further affirmed, that the first degree
of chastity is pure virginity, the second honest matrimony, so that marriage
has here but a second place: now by this we may conclude, that marriage was
ordained but as a mean or medicine, wherewith to allay our fleshly lusts: and
like as in all other our natural infirmities, when they oppress us, we by and
by seek the Physician, who to purge the humor, ministers unto us but an
Apothecaries drugge, the which by artificial means may well be made pleasant
in the receipt, but in operation and woorking, it so distempereth every part of
our body, as we shall never find rest nor quiet, so long as there is any
parcel of it remaining within us: so he that is infected with the sickness of
loathsome lust, he may well seek Physic, that is, he may take a wife to allay
the rage of his fleshly desires, but he shall find her but an Apothecaries
drugge: for though she seem pleasant in the first receipt, yet in the winding
up, she proves a continual torment, and his hastye attempt is ever rewarded
with a gnawing repentance. Marriage is termed by the name of a yoke, by
other-some it is called a bondage: and me thinks that these very names might
persuade us, that there is no great felicity to be sought for in his fruit. I
can most fitly compare lovers to hunters, that likes better of the sport, then
they do of the game it self when they have it: or like him that would needs
go a fishing, though he caught but a frogge: and my lover in the time of his
wooing, thinks there is no greater bliss, but having once attained the height
of his desire, his affections straight begins to decline. Thus you may
perceive, that in marriages there is not such sweet, but it is sauced with too
much sour, in love such government, which sauoureth not of folly, nor in
affection such foresight, which is not repented with great heart-breake. O
foolish therefore, that will suffer themselves to be conquered by a woman,
whom God at the first created but as an instrument to man's necessity: But it
is their beauty that be witcheth us, for with a pearce of their ein, there is
harbored such power, that with the nature of the Basilike, they so inuenome
every part of us, that no art will serve to purge it. Truly, the folly of
affection is wonderful, yet are the errors of beauty more admirable, when of
herself she is but a painted sepulcher, and in her actions, the diminisher of
all natural and moral reason: we praise beauty, what more vading, we honor
beauty, what more corrupt: we sorrow for beauty, what more foolish. In
green grass you shall find biting serpents, in glorious sepulchers, rotten
bones, in paineted pots, deadly poison: in fair women, false hearts. Their
immodest boldness many times makes them adventure of that which is both expressly
forbidden them, and also is most loathsome and contrary unto nature, as Myrrha,
to fall in love with her father. Phedra, with her son. Biblis, with her
brother. Pasiphe, with a Bull. The matrons of Rome in the time of Papirus,
prete^ding to have two husbands, did manifestly bewray their mordinate lust,
and is it not as likely that those dames, incroching further liberty, might
have sought for a third, and so for as many as they had list: but Dorestus, if
women were so virtuous as you would make them, their vanity would be less in
attire, and themselves not so popin-iae-like in their conversation: their
golden Calls would be set a side, which are more curious then comely, mor
precious then necessary, unless with the old superstition, we should deck
an artificial Idol, to draw the world to a vain worshipping: their curling
of hair so divided and laid into locks, that it seems to carry precepts and
propositions of Art, their maskes and vailes for their faces, that leads men in
imagination of greater beauty then indeed there is: yea, to what other
purpose are their Courtisans fannes, their huge Verdingals, with infinite other
vanities, but only to please men, and in pleasing of them, to be desired of
them: but would you know the very mysteries of these alluring curiosities: they
serve (indeed) for instruments to plead for that by show, which they would
be glad to speak for with their tongue, but for sooth they must do all
things with modesty. They would be seen to have many servants to sue unto
them, for that in their own fancy, is the cheifest testimony of their
beautye, and they have cunning to embrace every one with a particular
affection, and that with such slight as the wisest shall be lead in hope of
their good wills. They have with the Iugler change of entertainment for every
company, to persuade one with speech, to court an other with looks, to be
familiar with a third by signs, to allure a fourth by false trains of cloaked
honesty, feeding them all with uncertain hope, and him she makes the Ass to
bear the burden, that bears her most affection. One shall be her servant,
and he must wear her color, a second her partner, and wear her garter, a
third her Lover, and possess unchaste bed-pleasures, and though the two first,
be as lauashe of their expenses as the rest: yet they must be content to hold
the candle, while the third is offering to our Lady. They love above all things
to be solicited with great importunity, accounting him for a meacocke, that
will be repulsed with a first denial, affirming that a woman must say nay and
take it: and yet the more she sees you plagued in passion for her, the less
careful is she of your countenance, but the more you grow cold in your love,
the greater increases ye heat of her affections, like a disease, whose cure
comes by contrary medicin: such is ye violence of their spite, that with ye
Salimander they seem to have a felicity, in the torment of the pore fools that
serves them, whose presence they feed with a flattering hope, and in his
absence they make a scoff at his honest affections: Thus you may perceive they
have tongues to train, eyes to allure, tears to excuse, looks to atract,
smiles to flatter, imbracementes to provoke, frowns to delay, beckes to
recall, lips to inchaunt, kisses to inflame, bodies to perfume, and al these
to poison: By their slightes they have made Emperors idell as Anthony, strong
men feeble as Sampson, valient men effeminate as Hercules, wisemen dissolute as
Solomon, eloquent men lascivious as Aurelius: Will thou yet be married, when
thou must bear with all her inormities, her railing, her scoulding, her
curssing, her banning, her envy, her pride, her flattering, her frowning, her
cruelty, her spite, her wilines, her wantonness, her nicity, her slight, her
subtilty, her quesines, her disquietnes, her taunts, her scoffs, her floutes,
her perjury: but thou will say for increase females are good, very true, but
for decrease there are none so ill, for who so ever tastes of their
breathing will wax bedlem, but he that delights in their brauling, will
surely prove a beggar: Their commodity as it is got with care, so it is kept
with to much disquiet: have thou a wife and is she wise, then will she sure
make thee a fool, if she be folish, she will make thee ashamed; if she be
fair, toles on guest to thy house more then thou have need off: if she be
foul, she will afflight thee: if barren, thy woe is increased: if fruitful, she
heapeth upon thee either care to provide for a toward son, or sorrow to
preuente the practices of a wicked daughter: Thus may you se their company
does corrupt us, their vices without number, their virtues none at al, their
wit is will, their truth treachery, their trust treason, their faith fraud,
their curtisie cruelty, their simpryng civility, is body of al humanity: You
may se Dorestus, the subject I have taken in hand ministers such matter as I
know not how to make an end, yet here I will conclude, hoping that hereafter
you will be better advised, how you commend chalk for cheese, copper for
gold, or shrowes for saints: Acknowledge your folly, be sorry for your error,
it is the greatest sign of grace, for a man to confess his fault: Brusanus
having thus ended his lines, sent them immediately to Dorestus, who taking a
survay of the crciomstances, fell down of his knees, and holding up his hands
to Venus, craved mercy, thinking he committed more then sacrilege in reading
so horrible blasphemy to the diety of her son: Inioyning himself for
pennaunce to make a present answer, which immediately he set himself unto.

The ninth Chapter.
Moderna bewrays her love to Brusanus, he scoffeth at her passions, and
rejects her love.

IN this mean while, Moderna, transported with desire to whom she had already
bequeathed her self, wherefore after that she had with earnest and long
endeavor sought to resist vndesistable love, at the length taking courage,
bouldlye to persist, she enters with her self into these arguments: What
reason have thou Moderna to contend with love, that is both restless and
unreasonable, or what standst thou upon these over curious points, thy fathers
displeasure or thine own modesty, when the first may be pacified, and the
second nothing prejudiced: yea Moderna, thou may reverence as a daughter,
and love as a wife, and yet the latter not prejudicial to the first: But how
should I do now to make my love known to Brusanus, what shall I tell him, I
love him, and my self become a suter, for that every mean woman is ordinarily
required in, fie no, that were a bold part, why then thou should be noted
of lewdness, and generally condemned of to much lightness: and who shall
condemn thee for thine honest likeing, thou do not mean to practice
lawless lust, and lawful love is neither offenciue before God nor men, fear
not then Moderna, make thy love known to Brusanus, the hand of marriage once
confirmed, is inoughe to cover all faults: Speak then if thou mindest to
speed, sue to him for love, that perhaps would speak to thee, but that he
fears a repulse: Fortune (as it should seem) very favorable to further her
intent, for the very same euining as she was walking into a pleasant garden
to take the air: she found Brusanus sitting solitary by himself, debating
in his mind what success were like to follow his friend Dorestus in his love:
to whom coming with a pleasant countenance, and yet no other then stood with
modesty: she saluted in this manner: It seems (courteous Prince Brusanus) you
have some certain ceremonies to perform, you sit so sadly, what should move
your melancoly demeanure, if ought be here that mislikes you, forbid it, if any
thing that may delight you command, and it shall be had: Truly madame
(answered Brusanus) you are mistaken, for neither am I so holy as to meditate
so much, nor in so pleasant mood, to laugh at every conceit, for other
passion, if I seem a saint, I hope I shall escape the devil: I am the better
pleased (answered Moderna) if you be well contented, but how like you this
country of Illeria: As I should do Lady (answered Brusanus) it is pleasant in
climat, populous in Cities, plentious in dainties, and well stored with many
brave personages: But our women are nothing so fair here as they are in
Hungaria (answered Moderna) nor our ladies so well pleasing to your fancy, as
peradventure you have met withal in other places: It is the thing I least
care for (answered Brusanus) and yet if the perfections of their minds, be
answerable to the habitude of their bodies, I fear me there is no other
climate that can ouer-looke more beautiful, or afforde more wise, then I have
seen in Illeria: If your thoughts be answerable to your words (answered
Moderna) the end must thus follow, that where you allow so precisly, you must
love a little, or else in contemninge that you commend, we shall condemn you
in that you plead not guilty: That were to much extremity (answered
Brusanus) for so by the deeming of mine eye, I might be doomed to mine own
destruction: Moderna, that had thus preuily felt his repulse, although not
beating so amorously as she did wish: yet having opportunity to utter what she
would, not omitting therefore so good occacion, she says: It is no hard matter
( Brusanus) to bring inward liking to outward confession, and if you will not
think me to be more prodigal of my present, then your fancy will serve to take
in good part, know this that since thy first ariuall here at my fathers
court, mine eyes have been so daseled with the beams of thy beauty, and my
mind so snared with the view of thy virtues, that thou only thou, art the man
whom I like and love: and to cut off speeches, which might seem to savor
either of flattery or deceit, as thou art the first unto whom I have vowed my
love, so thou shall be the last, only requiring this for my good will that
thou take me to thy wife: for other-wise to practice pleasure without virtue, I
protest my mind is nothing less: here withal the tears streaming down her
eyes, gave her a short pause to this that follows: again she says: In
troth thou may think either my message is great, or my modesty little,
either that I take small care of my self, or repose great trust in thee, who
so unfitting for my calling, without any regard to my estate, do so
prodigally offer my self, to the disposition of thy judgment, to conceive of
me at thine own pleasure, being provoked there unto by the pureness of my love,
and the fidellity of my good will: honesty being the only guide of my conceits:
if I have then committed a fault, it is in loving thee to well: Here again
the tears stopped her words for a time, but having dried her eyes, she thus
proceeded: If you find ought immodestly escaping my tongue, impute the same to
the integrety of my love, and the necessity of speedye dispatche: my father
having already promised me in marriage, to your friend and companion Dorestus,
whom in my heart I could never fancy, and whom with all my soul I utterly
renounce, and have wholly settled my self to be thine only one: wherefore,
neither fear nor scorn to enjoy that which is thine, or at the leastwise,
let her presently understand thy pleasure, whose good or bad days, wholly
consists in thy good or bad answer: thus ending her speeches, she now again
begins to weep. Brusanus, that was almost out of his wits to hear this loving
discourse, returned this answer for her better comfort. Madame, when dogs
falls to snarling, serpents to hissing, and women to weeping: the one means
to bite, the other to sting, and the third to deceive: but do you look for an
answer: truly madame, I have no leisure to love, I must about other business,
and thus away he flinges, leaving Moderna in a pitiful plight (you may
imagine) who finding her self so shaken off, departed presently into her
chamber, and casting her self upon her bed, she closed her eyes, as if each
thing she saw had been a picture of her mishap, where she began thus to
exclaim. Alas (quoth she) disspised Moderna: is this the reward of thy given
away liberty? Why did thou not hold thy thoughts in their simple course, and
content thy self with the love of thine own virtue? O unkind Brusanus, could
thy force and courage find out no ^tter conquest, then to triumph over her
mishappes, who at the first sight did wish thee all happiness? shall it be
said, that the mirror of mankind has been the wrack and ruin of a Lady
that loved him? what triumph can thou make of this conquest? what spoils
will thou carry away of this my vnderserued overthrow? But O wicked mouth, how
dare thou blaspheme the ornament of the earth, the vessel of virtue, the
very object that all eyes owe reverence unto? and how may thou blame him? or
wherein has he offended thee? O no, no: there is no fault, but in thine own
imaginations, that would think that so high a perfection would stain it self
with so great impossibilities. Alas, he has then done thee no wrong, it
was thine own weakness that wrought thine own woe, thou may then begin to
hate thy self, but never leave to love him. But what a labyrinth am I entered
into, I disdain my fortune, and yet I reverence him that disdains me, I accuse
his vngratfulnes, and have his virtue in admiration. Oh heavens, I would his
unkindness could race out the deapth of my affection, or my affection could make
him to relent from his unkindness. Moderna thus taking to her self the weight
of her own woes, left off further speaking, and began to turn her self to
every thing: as if change of objects might help her invention, and although
she had a great while traueiled her thoghts, not settling any determination, in
the end she resolved from that time forward, to restrain the liberty of her
senses* not so much to look on the Sun, that had dimde her eyes with
brightness, Dorestus, that had been all this while busy at his pen, and being
now prepared of an answer to Brusanus, sent it immediately unto him in these
words.

The tenth Chapter.
Dorestus, Prince of Epirus, to Brusanus the common deprauer of Feminine virtue.

When the Fox does once begin to preach, good women then beware your Geese,
and where vanity dare oppose it self for verity, there vice may cry check,
but never give the mate. How miserable is the condition of those men, that will
make themselves guilty of their own mothers disgrace: and how unnatural may
that seed be accounted, which will show it self unthankful to the soil:
and although gross questions are to be answered with slender reasons, and adle
heads should be scoffed at with idle answers: yet to help simplicity, thus
beset with subtilty, I must not neglect the defense of so many innocent Dames,
for any respect of a deprauing friend. For your large exhortatorie, I let it
pass as frivolous: but we must not do women that wrong, to condemn them for
a little foolish Philosophy: for as the Philosophers were men, so they had many
faults: there were some of them Parasites, some Epicures, some Iesters, some
railers, some insected with pride, some with covetousness, but most lascinious:
and it is a custom of ill men, to defame women openly, when they have abused
them secretly. Such a one was your great Emperor, and worthy Philosopher
Marcus Aurelius, whom you so much account of: but who more dissolute in the
company of women, yet who more prodigal in defaming of women: in the
disordered demeanure of his own wife, Faustine did many times so disquiet him,
that he was not able to moderate himself, no not withal his precepts of
Philosophy. I do not speak this to confirm Brusanus in his opinion, that
women were thus able to martyr the minds of these learned Philosophers, but I
speak it as well to confute those bitter inuectiues pronounced by the
Philosophers, (peradventure in a fury) as also to confound their actions, that
notwithstanding their pretended knowledge, would suffer themselves to be
seduced, not only by women that live in suspect, but some of them most
notoriously known, as namely Layis of Corinth, whom Aristippus so nicely
courted, and to whom Demostines came to cheapen, but her ware was too hie
prized. Periander, chief Philosopher in Greece at the instaunt of a strumpet,
slew his honest wife. Anacharsis was so bewitched on his Curtisan Ielaua, that
he so instructed her in his knowledge of Philosophy, that on a time while he
lay sick, she supplied his place of reading in the school. Cleobulus, when
he was 60. years old, and had read Philosophy 45, years, climing up a
window, to have come to his beloved, fell down from the ladder, and died of
the bruise. Solon, that was accounted such a sage, was besotted of his own
bondwoman, whom he brought from the wars: Aristotle so much renowned for
his wit, at the fond request of his foolish mistress, made himself a silly
Ass, creeping about a chamber with a bridle in his mouth: where dame folly his
mistress, sitting on his back, (having appointed her companions in privy
corners to behold this pageant) made but a scorn of that learned Philosopher.
Terrence was hanged out of a window in a Basket. Socrates was crowned with a
pisse-pot by his own wife Zantippa. By this you may perceive, that these men,
notwithstanding their great philosophy, submitted themselves to the wills of
wemens of little modesty: and is it not like that such as will commit Idolatrye
with wicked women without care* may not after blaspheme all women without
cause, and that they will observe as little gravity in their unbridled fury,
as they observed reason in their disordered fantasy. But to make proof and
trial of metals, there is no better mean then to bring them to the touch,
then shall you find men to be furious, froward, ouer-thwart, rash, sullen,
boisterous, harsh, sturdye, and give them their best commendacions, you may
compare them but to Iron, which shows by his rust, the uneven temperature of
the elements, and malicious influence of the Planets in his composition,
prefiguring the ungodly estate of man, wasted by the flame of concupiscence,
and canker of loose life: where women by nature are mild, modest, sober,
silent, gentle, loving, humble, meek, lowly, and in every perfection as pliant
as the purest gold, whose property is neither yielding to the moystnes of the
water, nor consuming by the extreme fury of the fire, is the tipe of those,
who dispising all things, are afflicted for virtue: and where the countenance
of a man threatens nothing but cruelty, the very looks of a woman promises
mercy and pity: But I think there was never Lion so furious, never Tiger so
cruel, never Viper so infectious, never Aspicke so mortal, neither ever
Woolfe so ravenous, but the males will rather oppose themselves to defend their
Females, then any way to grieve them: and although these brute beasts are
bereaved of reason, yet in the conversation of their kind, they show
themselves more worthy then man: and was it not Adams own wretchedness, that
wrought his own fall in Paradise. Let Brusanus look better of his text, and
he shall find it to be so, and that Adam could never after have risen again,
but by the seed of a woman. And now I can but pity Brusanus, who has taken
such pains, framed such arguments, alleged such examples, gathered such
conclusions, and has induced so many reasons, and all in the disgrace of love,
under the shadow whereof he has figured the very substance of lust They are
evil acquainted with the nature of honest love, who will dispose him only
under a contentment so frail, being in himself so divine and wonderful. The
Philosophers, who in a deep in-sight, thinking to attain to the understanding
of nature, imagined love to be a most excellent form or plot exceeding
generallye the consideration of man: the accidents which often do happen
through the elements of fire and water, are many times perrillous, and yet to
hinder or take away their use, were to drive nature from her course, even so it
is in love, whose profession you wish us to leave for certain light
inconveniences accompanieng him by circumstance, without any consideration of
the sovereign benifites which secretly lie shrouded and hiden in him: and
therefore as love is a poison unto fools, so it is sweet to them that know
how to use him, for to love without reason, is a token of lust, and to live
without love an argument of follye: And therefore Brusanus you labor with
great wrong to exempt us from that divine amity which the almighty him
self has not only commended, but also straightly commanded unto us: If our
Creator has said it is not good for man to live alone, how dare we say we know
better what is meet for us then he that made us, if he has said, thou shall
leave father and mother and cleave to thy wife, dare we say she is but an
Apothicaries drugge, and marriage to be esteemed as a yooke or a bondage, but a
sweet yooke to be coupled to virtue, and a happy bondage to be linked to
beauty, but what greater honor then that we do owe to our parents, expressly
commanded: Honor thy father and mother, and yet this holy institution of
wedlock is more worthily dignified, Thou shall leave father and mother and
cleave to thy wife, when a man therefore betakes himself to wife he gives no
occation to be slaundered, but just occation to be honored.

But Brusanus, me think you skip a little beyond your skill thus to quarrel
with beauty, is the sun to be misliked because it is bright, the diamond to
be refused because it is clear, the pearl to be condemned because it is
orient, or women to be despised because they be beautiful, when it is the only
doury it has pleased God to bestow amongst them, the more to show the
majesty of his handy work: But you infer it causes men to dote, and to
whom do you impute the fault, would you have women to eclipse that perfection
which them selves cannot hide, without prejudice to their creator: but he that
stands to near the fire, let him blame but himself, if he be scorcht with
the flame: Marcus Aurelius, wrighting to the lady Lidia, proves by his
Philosophy, that it is a token of great simplicity, not to descry the
perfection of beauty, and an argument of greater folly, not to desire it: Now
you begin to quarrel with wemens apparel, but you are in this matter either
not well informed or else to forward in judgment, seeing this curiosity (as
you term it) is allowed to women, with more authority then you think, for
women being only created for the pleasure of man, why might it not be thought,
that God him self sturres that opinion in her, to give contentment to the eyes
of him, for whose sake she was created: Licurgus in his common wealth,
precislye ordained that maidens should go bare faced, to the end they might be
seen and desired, and by the same means, the married wives labors to
please (not the populer sort as Brusanus imagines) but her husband to whom she
is married, as it is written of the daughter of Augustus, who on a day being
attired above her wonted custom of modesty, where at her father taking no
great delight yet for the present, governing his iudgmente by silence, but
another time finding her in habit more convenient to his liking, Oh (says he)
how far more seemelye is this attire for the daughter of Augustus, then that
which she wore this other day to the disguising of nature, to whom she
answered and that with reverence: then sir I used my time to please the desire
of my husband, and now I stand to satisfy my duty toward my father: The like
example was used by the good lady Hester, when she protested before God that
the sumptious attires which sometimes she used, carried no other purpose, then
to feed the liking of that great king Assuerus, who had chosen her for his
own, and as the frocke makes the friar never the more devout, and so in the
attire of a woman lies no true argument of incontenency, and much less ought
her garments to breed any opinion of her leude life and although the
suspicious, be apt to speak ill, yet wemens consciences being clear, what
other rekoning have they to make of wicked speches, but that they are rather of
custom then of credit: Besides this, such is the malice to wemens behavior,
that if any one should attire her self contrary to the use of others, she
should be noted either disdainful of the fashion, or at least an hipocrite in
conversation: Women are further charged that they love to have many servants,
and how cunning they be in their chaung of entertainment unto such as be suitors
unto themselves. In high attempts and marciall excercises, our gallantes now
do practice nothing but to court Ladies and to tria^ll with Gentlewemen,
whose dissimuling dealing deserves a counterchaunge of like quality, no
marvel though women grow to be fond, when it is to please the fantesie of men
that be folish, or who can blame women though they iuggle a little with those
men, that practice nothing else but to play fast and loose with them: and
although Brusanus has thus generally exclaimed against all women, yet had he
but looked into every ordinary calender he might find out as many vigillies of
holy women, as feasts of devout men, and in his racking of the scriptures it
seemed his right eye was out and he could see but on the left side, for if he
can find me a Dalida, I can show him a Debora, if he can turn me to be a
Iesabell, I can seek out him a Judith, and although some men through women
has fallen into the rebuke of the world, has there not been as unfortunate
women that has been ruinated by the treason of men, as Medea by Jason; Philis
by Demophoon: Dido by Eneas: Ariadua by Thesius: with many others, if it were
needful here to rehearse them: The rest of your words, which serves to no
other purpose but to deprave, there needs no other answer but that they
were spoken of spite: and the woman of good life, fears no slanderous
tongues, and a clear conscience, neither needs excuse, nor fears
accusation: See now, what is become of this terrible tempest, where he many
malicious boults have been thundered for the against women, alas it is
ouer-paste without any danger, for the best substance were but puffes of
wind, such as might make a noise, but do no hurt at all: But what a
labyrinth should I now enter into, if I should take upon me to write in the
commendation of women, that have aspired in the deep capacity of arts and
sciences, and therein so profoundly, that men should not only have cause to
praise, but also to wonder at them. Histories are plentifully replenished,
where mention is made of Nycostrata, called also Carmenta, for the eloquence
she had in versifieng, of Lasterna and Axiothea, two worthy dames most highly
renowned amongst the scholars of Plato, of Arethea, that wrote forty several
books who read openly in the schoolles, and had a hundred and fifty
Philosophers that were his scholars, of Aspasia that instructed Pericles of
lelia Sabina so renowned in Rome for her letters of Amatasunta, and others like
learned in the latin. But wherein have women bin inferior to men in virtuous
life, who more framed then Aemelya, Claudia, Tusia, Nycaulia: For government
who more provident then Zenobia, for wisdom Saba that oposed Solomon: for
actiuity in war, Penthasile: for poesy, Sapho: for policy, Zoe: for poetry,
Thalia: for rethoricke, Helerna: for oratory, Cornelia: for eloquence,
Hortensia: amongst the elementall gods is there not (for matter of war)
as well the goddess Bellona, as the god Mars: and for science and wisdom, is
there not a Pallas as well as Apollo: for poesy, or verfifieng are not the nine
Muses as famous as Phoebus: By this you may see there was yet never man so
profound in any knowledge, but there has bin a woman to second him, further
more, these virtues of Justice, Temperaunce, Fortitude, Patience, Pity,
Mercy, Charity, Humility, and many other like, ar all of the feminie gender:
yea the very Church of god is compared to a woman, and figured forth in femall
shape. But yet a little better to make trial of wemens perfections, we will
examine their first creation, wherein is to be noted the substance whereof
they were formed, which was of the purified metal of man, the place where
they were created, which was paradise, the time of their creation, which was
the last, and therefore the perfittest handiworke of the creator, the cause why
they were created, which was to be comfortable assistantes to men: through the
sin of a man, death and damnation were incydent to all human posterity, by
the seed of a woman, life and salvation was purchaced to all true beleuers,
after Christ's nativity, during the time of his abode here on earth, who
conspired against him, who sought to persecute him, who tempted him, who
condemned his doctrine, who would have stoned him, who said he had the devil
within him, who would have intraped him, who practiced his death, none but men,
Herod, Annas, Chayfas, Scribes, Pharisees, unbelieving Jews, yea Judas one of
his own apostels, contrary wise, who loved him most entirely, who embraced his
doctrine, who confessed him to be a prophet, who entertained him in their
houses, who ministered unto him even of their own substance, only women,
Mary, Martha, the woman of Samaria, Ionua, Susanna, and many others. It was a
woman that poured a box of precious ointment on his head, they were men that
murmurred against it, and were offended that so great cost was bestowed upon
him, it was Pilat (a man) that condemned Christ, and delivered him to the Jews
to be crucified, it was his wife (a woman that would have saved Christ, willing
her husband to have nothing to do with that just man: they were men that
carried him to be crucified, compelling him to bear his own cross: they were
women that followed to the place where he was crucified, bitterly weeping and
lamenting his death: what would you more, they were women that still visited
his sepulcre after his burial, it was to a woman to whom he first apeared
after his resurrection: but I dare say no more, for as the horse knows not
his own strengeth: so if women did consider of their own worthynes, they
would be infected with that pride, which yet they have not, and men with that
malice which yet they need not: now Brusanus, by this you may conceive, what
leaden conceits has ouergrowne your reasonable arguments: I could wish you to
be sorry for your erroures, blush not to ask forgiveness, women be full of
mercy, their property is to pardon, if this will not suffice, I must leave you
to the instruction of Musonius, who in his book of sciences writes thus: It
is an impudent part to present any thing to public judgment, that wants
knowledge, and the part of an envious man, to dispraise without occasion:
Dorestus having thus ended his lines, sent them to Brusanus with more have then
good speed (as after it fell out for himself) for Brusanus advisedly perusing
the circumstaunces, and finding his own misdeaming of women so manifestly
confuted, was stricken into a sudaine remorse of conscience, and began to
confess in his heart the impiety he had used, in slandering their sex:
protesting from that time forward to love and honor them so much and more, as
before he had despised them.

The eleventh Chapter.
Brusanus renownceth his former herisies, he feels the effects of love, and
writteth to Moderna.

Here calling to his mind his ungrateful demeanure toward Moderna, whose
beauty presenting it self a fresh to his memory, love being ready at an inch
with fuel to kindell the fire, wrought such a sudaine alteration in his mind,
and such contrary passions so perplexed his doubtful thoughts, that after a
long controversy in himself, he was driven perforce to yield to fancy, and
pulling in his former flagge of defiance, entreated for truce, and began to
enter parle with Cupid on this manner: Why how now Brusanus, what a doubtful
combat do thou find in thy self, is thy lawless liberty turned to a slavish
captivity, is thy freedom fettered, are thy senses besotted, were thou of late
at defiance with Venus, and will thou now shake hands with vanity, did thou
ere while renownce beauty as a foe, and will thou now embrace her as a friend:
have thou so carefully counseled others to beware the bait, and will thou now
so crabbidly poison thy self with the bane* but fool that thou art, why
do thou thus rechlesly rage against reason, why do thou thus fondly
exclaim against thine own welfare, why do thou condemn thy self of that
crime, where of thou art not guilty, thou have vowed to beware of fickle fancy,
but this thy liking is firm affection, thou have bin bitten with the sore of
lawless lust, but never tasted the sweet of loyal love, because thou have
endeavored to desist from vanity, will thou therefore exempt thy self from
virtue, will thou neglecte a peerless Princess, whose birth may be a
countenance to thy calling, in the attayning of whom thou shall gain honor,
nay more, thou shall inherit a kingdom, I marry Brusanus, there goes the game
away, follow that chase, it is no small matter to enjoy a scepter. I but yet
remember thy self, and thou shall find that thy desire must needs be waited
on with danger: Moderna is promised by the king her father to Dorestus, he
again is thy vowed friend, and will thou requit the trust he reposeth in thee
with such disloyalty: But do thou stand upon doubts now Brusanus, O fie for
shame, art thou false hearted: what fear thou the displeasure of a king, if
thou by the means may compass a kingdom, and did not Dorestus tell thee
himself that love was without law, what respect is then to be had of
friendship: fear not then Brusanus, the rest of thy time has bin but a dream
unto thee, it is now only thou beginnest to live, now only now, thou have
entered into the way of blissefullnes, let not then the opinion of I know not
what promise, bind thee from paying thy duty to nature: With this resolution
Brusanus determined to watch oportunities to come to the speech of Moderna, and
by chance finding her walking in a gardin, coming to her before she was
aware of him, as he begun to open his lips to salute her, Moderna of a
sudaine started away from him, withdrawing her self into her chamber, the
which she did rather fearing to be farther tempted with so sweet an aspecte,
then for any hatred she bare him whom she loved against her will: Brusanus,
marking her demeanure, was somewhat amassed, yet not minding so to give ever, he
went to his chamber, where he wrote these insueing lives unto her.

Brusanus to Moderna.
Madame, although the passion which is commonly incident to all women (I mean
misbeliefe) has over taken you of late, yet think not that either my
affections are so light as to esteem your disdain for injury, or let that
love finishe with a braule, which is in me begun and shall be continued for
ever, unkindness may prevail for a season, but not corrupt, and your repulse
may (perhaps) persuade me to forbear, yet not to forsake: as nature has made
women fair thereby to entangle men: no reason but some times they should be
froward to command men: but it was a sweet policy, by a vitter repulse to
renew affection, other doubts, misdeemings, or opinions have I none, but only
this, that my mistres was froward to make trial, not to forsake, and that my
self am by nature to brook an injury to be pertaker of so happy a benifit:
well Moderna, all misdeeming set a part, grant me your grace and favor: and I
shall have greater cause to rejoice then you to susspecte, and will always
remain your faithful servant to command, who craves nothing more then to do
you service.

Yours if he be Brusanus.


This letter being sealed up, he quickly found the means to have it
delivered to the hands of Moderna, who noting the contents of these plausible
lines, by the same messenger returns him this answer.

Moderna to Brusanus.
I stood in doubt ( Brusanus) whether I should answer with silence or
sophistry, because where the demand is but a jest, the fittest answer were a
scoff, for dwelling still in your old error, who will believe your new
protestations: but to make you to acknowledge your faults, and to morteste
that mad humor of yours, that made you so much to forget your self, and to
bring you again into your right senses: I will not let to pray for you, nay
more then that, I would be glad to here a whole trentall of masses (besides
other charitable actions) to redeem you, because I did love you: but seeing
your purgatory is not pardonable without sattisfaction from your own merrites,
I can but wish you to have grace to acknowledge it: and by penitent wisdom to
win again, what your wilfulnes has lost: for the many services you proffer
me, if to morrow after dinner you will come to me that I may speak which you,
if I find your own words correspondent to your writings, it may be I will
employ you, till then farewell.

Yours if she could* Moderna.


The twelfth Chapter.
Brusanus and Moderna practices secret slight.

BRusanus, not able to stand of any ground for joy, mist not (I warrant you)
his appointed time to visit his lady, who being as ready to awaite his coming,
they convey themselves to an inward chamber, where for the time, either of them
remains confused, with a sudden astonishment of exceeding joy: Brusanus (in
the end) breaking of their vnnecessarye silence, used these words: Though
timerity, (madame) has caused me to refuse your proffered bounty and the
deeming of mine own unworthiness to neclecte your favorable curtisie, yet
seeing the fault proceeded rather from a mistrust of mine own happiness, then
for any mislike or other contempt of your great worthiness, I humbly crave
pardon for this my fore-passed simplicity, promissing heere-after protested
faith and loyalty: Moderna taking Brusanus by the hand smilingly made this
answer: It is an easy matter Brusanus, to purchase credit, where the party
is al-ready persuaded, and to infer belief, where every word is acounted an
oracle: but to cut off other friuilous protestations, let this suffice, thou
have the victory, use it with virtue: but fearing that my father should
suspecte our liking, and by that means preuente our purpose: having as thou
know promised me to Dorestus: I am therefore content to follow thee
where-soeuer thou will be my conducter, and by making an easy escape from
hence, we may line for a time as contentedly else where, and being lawfully
wedded (for that is the hondes of my love) it will be no hard matter, to win
again my fathers liking, and in short space to make over return to the
kingdom of Dalmatia, where thou shall receive the Scepter, in the right of me
thy married wife: this Brusanus is the only way by which your contentment may
draw on my happiness: Brusanus, who had al-ready taken forth this lesson,
perfectly to yield a willing obedience to al his desires, made this answer:
Madame all places are to me both good or bad, as it shall please you to bless
or curse, behoulde then (noble lady) what other service it shall please you to
command, I am ready in your affairs to apply my self with all duty and
obedience: After they had a while concluded of their safety, and set down the
course between them how they might proceed in their enterprises, Brusanus
departed to provide himself for this secret flight: Dorestus all this while,
who had received but cold comfort from Moderna, that had still driven him of
with delays, by fortune finding her in a convenient place, he said unto her:
Madame, shall my merit be repaied with no meed, shall my good will be requited
with no gain, and my long suit with no comfort, O Moderna let me yet call
thee before the judgment of thine own virtue, and now at the last, pity my
estate, and do not recompense my desire, with despite, nor my lingering love
with loathing hate: Why Dorestus (quoth she) do thou call it hate not to
condescend to the request of every one that woeth, or do thou think it
cruelty not to yield to the assault of every flattering lover, but if this may
content thee, as I cannot be so courteous to requite thee as thou desire, so
I will not be so cruel to despite thee for thy good will, let this suffice for
the season, here-after thou shall know more, I have now other business in hand:
thus she departed away leaving Dorestus in a brown studdys what he might
make off her words.

The thirtenth Chapter.
Brusanus and Moderna are secretly fled from the court of Illeria, the King
rages, Dorestus fretteth, they both intend war against Miletto, King of
Hungaria, and father to Brusanus.

THe very same night Brusanus and she being provided of all things,
necessarily conuaied themselves away from the court imediatly after supper, and
taking the advantage of the night, directed his iorny toward the co^fines of
Grecia, leaving his own country, which way be thought there would be great
speed made after him, the which (indeed) fell out according to his
expectation: for in the morning that they were both missing from the court,
and that the manner of their flight was gathered by conjecture, the king sent
out all the posts he had presently in readiness, to belay those quarters toward
Hungaria: by this means Brusanus and Moderna escaped the hands of the king of
Illeria, but yet after that, they fell both subject to the crewell menaces of
merciless fortune, as in the sequel shall be shown, but the king when he
perceived no mean to recover them, he burst out into these speeches against
his daughter: O how many incombrances are incident to parents, that are vexed
with the practices of amorous daughters, for when we have fostred, cheerished
and brought them up to years of discretion, even then do they run themselves
to their own destruction, when we hope of greatest comfort, they do cumber us
most with care, and while we are providing dowries to bestow them in marriage of
such as we like, they provide themselves of parramours, and will not be
restrained to fancy but whom they list, but let us provide them of a husband,
such as we know to be fit for them, and they will live virgins with a
vengence, and seem to blush at so honest a motion, but let a verlet but meet
them in a corner alone, he shall be entertained without regard of sham or
honesty but unhappy Moderna, since ye traitor that has thus inueygled thee,
has not spared to dishonor thy father, I do here vow by all the powers of
heaven, I will make Hungaria to smoke for this his fact, his parents shall
curse the time of his nativity, and lament ye ever they brought so wretched a
impe into the world: The king freted not so fast in his melancholy, but
Dorestus chafed no less in his choler, blaspheming bitterly both against
Brusanus and Moderna, but especially against Brusanus and understanding the
intent of the king was to make wars with Hungaria, he proffered to strengthen
his army, with ten thousand Epirotes, and to march himself in person with
the king, to be revenged of the injury proffered him by Brusanus, the king most
lovingly accepting of this assistaunce, fell in all have to making ready both
men and munitions fit for the wars, Dorestus has taken his leave and is
departed likewise into his country to make preparation according to his
promise, In this mean time the king had gotten certain understanding that
Brusanus with Moderna had bent their course toward Calypha, and minding
notwithstanding, himself and Dorestus to hold on their determination, against
Milleto king of Hungaria, he appointed to send his son Antipholus, into all
those parts about the borders of Crete, to follow Brusanus to take reueng, to
the which journey Antipholus most willingly agred, unto, and leaving them here
for a time to make all things ready, we will shortly follow Brusanus, but not
to hastily, till he be clear out of danger, from the borders of Illeria.

Thus ends the second part of the adventures of Brusanus.
The third Book, of the adventures of Brusanus.
The first Chapter.
Brusanus by straung misfortune wounds Moderna, his pitious exclamation for
his unlucky fact.

BRusnaus and Moderna, having thus passed the bounds of Illeria: and being
freed from the fury of the king, were even now subjected to the wounderfull
munaces of bitter fortune, and thinking (in their own conceits) they had
escaped all danger, were but then entered, the very path of succeeding peril,
but Moderna who all this whil had bin transported with desire and troubled with
fear, had never leisure to look with perfect consideration into her own
enterprise, but according to the laws of love, like alouer had bequeathed the
care of her self upon him to whom she had given her self: but now that her
hope was something quieted, and the most part of her fear already passed, she
began to look back into her own thoughts, and better to consider with her
self of her undertaken flight, and to remember how she had left her native
country, and had settled so strange a determination, but yet being nothing
dismayed, having in her (...) the party whom she so dearly loved, and
therefore casting no doubts, on they rid, Brusanus cheering her with many
comfortable and loving discourses, by this time they were entered into a mighty
forest, or rather a huge wilderness, in the kingdom of Calypha, and not far
from the famous City of Sara, where they had not traueiled long, but they were
incountered by a barbarous company, that were laid close amongst the bushes to
watch for some bootye that should come that way, who having espied Brusanus,
sudainely beset him round about, and he as quickly leaping from his horse,
and taking down his Lady, set her against the body of a great tree, then
turning himself with a violent rage against that rascal rout (who by this
time began altogether to assault him) he gave them such a welcome, and
bestowed so many bloody tokens amongst them, that they began to give back, but
Brusanus, thoroughly inflamed with fury so laid about him, that the best hope
they had to save themselves was to trust to their heels, and thus at an
instant they began all to fly, Brusanus following so fast, and dealyng such
dole amongst them, that they were fain to scater themselves every man a
contrary way: Moderna that was now alone by her self and being stricken with
a great fear, forsook her place and followed after Brusanus, but having lost
the sight of him, she thrust her self into a mighty thick bush that was by
the side of the way: Brusanus giving over the chase retired himself to go
comfort his Lady, and coming by the bush where Moderna lay hid, she rejoicing
to see her friend safly returned, was creping out of the thicket to have showed
her self to her best beloved: Brusanus hearing the russiling in the bush, and
having a spear in his hand which he had recovered from one of the villains,
and thinking it to be some of the company that had there hiden themselves, very
rashly aiming the spear where he saw the bushes to sture, unfortunately hit
Moderna clean through the body a little below her ribes: with the blow she
gave a pitious scritch, but not able to speak any word she sancke down dead to
the ground: Brusanus, hearing the cry, yet not knowing what he had done, came
to the place, and looking (...) saw his handy work, and being taught not to
stand long open deliberations he forth with drew out the spear, then taking
her up dead in his arms he brought her into the plane, where after he had used
all bootlesse means to recover her life, his perplexed memory had straight
stlled him with the lively shape of all his forepassed miseries, and the
rememberaunce of his former fortunes, with the agony of his present mishap,
coming altogether into his mind, and marching as it were in one whole frunte,
so gauled him with grief, that with the extremity of his anguishe, his senses
forsook him and he fell to the ground where he remained for a time, without
moving hand or foot, in the end yielding forth a groan as if his heart
stringes had burst, and stretching his joints upon the green grass, he came
again to himself, breathinge forth these words: O fortune, why have thou not
made an end of my life with the end of my joy: O bottumlesse pit of endless
sorrow, how can thou rid thy self being fettered with the everlasting
consideration of thy miserable fortunes: thou have been a paricide to thy
father, in seeking to destroy him by thy disobedience: a poison to the country,
infecting it with the example of thy ungracious life: a traitor to thy friend,
robbing him of such a treasure, whereof he was a thousand times more worthy
then thy self: and now thou have been a murderer, a butcher to her that was
the exampler of all virtue, and the very only ornament that garnished the
whole world: O sorrow, now thou have the full sack of my curssed corpse,
and comfort thou art now extinguished because I cannot hope, and what can I
hope for when death has divorced me from the exampler of al virtue: will thou
seek then to prolong thy wretched life, no: cut off thy cursed days, and who
can be so fit an executioner as thine own hands being accessarie to so
bloody a fact, so that in killing thy self, they shall suffer their own
punishment: Then turning himself toward the breathless body of Moderna
bedewing it with his tears he said: O divine soul, whose virtues can
possess no less, then the highest part of heaven, behold his tears, whose
heart does melt in grief, but if any mercy be resting in the skies, or any
love be left to consider of a friend: if the heavenly powers, may behold our
earthly sorrows: accept his life for sacrifice, that has no other recompense,
and would bestow a thousand lives to view thy heavenly face: Then taking the
speere wherewith he had wounded Moderna, and setting it directly against his
heart, minding to throw himself upon it: he said: Death, now do thy worst,
and spare not to assail the most unfortunate wretch that lives, suffer him
not to apeare amongst men, nor to receive common sepulture: then making a
little pause he said further: but alas death is the end of all miseries:
what reason have I then to cut off a wretched life, by a speedy death: if I
maintain my life it is to abide far greater torments then are in death: live
then Brusanus, live, but live still to languish in thine own euiles: then
throwing the spear from him he said: And whether shall I recommend the
protection of this my wretched corpse, to the earth, why it shuneth to be
increased by the relics of my shamed carcass: to the heavens, Oh unspeakable
tormente of conscience, which dare not look toward them, whether then wit
thou lead this captiuitye of thine: thou art not worthy to live amongst men,
that art a foe to nature: and it is to late to speak any comfort in the angry
gods: help then you infernal furies, help him (I say) that dedicates
himself to your devotions: whose hellishe rage is fit for your service: whose
guilty conscience may never admit of comfort: Thou sun, disdain heere-after
to shine on so curssed a creature: Cities deny to harbor him: men, abhor
him: women despise him worthily, that depraved you wrongfully. Diana, grant
him no shroud in the forest: Ceres, let him starve for bread: you dropping
heauenes, vouchsafe him no moisture: thou earth dry up all thy welsprings
where he shall come, yea let mine eyes, be deprived of their light: let my
tongue, show no use but bemone mine own wretchedness, let my heart, be the seat
of infernal sorrow: let my soul with endless anguishe of his conscience,
become his own tormenter.

The second Chapter.
Brusanus leaves Moderna for dead, he bereaueth himself of human society,
Eriphila finds Moderna, reuiueth her and heals her, Moderna changes her
name to Calinda, a general Just proclaimed for the young princess Valeria,
Antipholus brother to Moderna prepares himself to that Just.

IN this and such like manner, did Brusanus tender his complaints, whose
dolorous passions might have been pleaded in full aquaintance of al fore-passed
trespaces, had envy it self followed the action, and rigor occupied the place
of justice: In this desperate mood, and (as it were) more then half bereued
of his senses, he left Moderna for dead, betaking himself for ever to live in
this solitary desarte, dispising human society: acompanied only with the
beasts and birds of the forest: delighting himself in naught, but in sour
discourses: his muse affording nothing, but lamentable lays: and leaving him
here to speak of other matters: You must understand that more then three
years before passed, Belizarius king of Calipha was deceased leaving to
inherit his kingdom, his only daughter Valeria, being then not above
thirteen years of age, in whom nature had striued to bestow her brauest
perfections, and virtue no less vouchsafed to furnish forth with presidents:
This young Princess, the king at ye tune of his death, committed to the
government of the queen his wife and mother to Valeria, called by the name of
Eriphila, a lady a great deal more virtuous then fortunate: for not long
after the death of the king, she married again with Brianto duke of Doletta, a
man of great ambition, practiced in all mischief and most shameless in his
demeanures: It fortuned at this very instante that this young Princes,
acompanied with the queen her mother, with Brianto the duke and many other
nobles, had been a huntting in this forest: their sportes being ended, as
they were trauellinge home-wardes toward the City Sara: they found Moderna
lyeng by the side of the way, dead as they supposed, and some of them alighting
from their horses finding her to be wounded, and perceiving it to be newly
done, one laieng his hand on her breast to feel if she had been cold, he
might perceive her heart softly to beat, being then assured that there was
life remaining in her, craved the help of the Ladies to revive her, who having
in their companies men well experimented both in Physic and Surgery, they
recovered life in her again, though not able to make them understand the
manner of her misfortune, the queen Eriphila caused her to be brought into her
own cotche, and coming to the court where she had a most precious balm,
dressing her with her own hands, within few days she was perfectly hole of
her hurt, though not altogether eased at the heart, not knowing what was become
of her dearest friend Brusanus: neither durst she enquire after him, and the
rather to keep her self unknown, she changed her name, from Moderna to
Calinda, the which name for the time, my self will likewise use: Calinda thus
remaining in the court, attendant of the queen Eriphila, rested her self in
this hope, that in time, she might either hear of Brusanus, or Brusanus should
hear of her: The young Princess Valeria being now between 16. and 17.
years of age, was wooed by many great Kings and Princes, but al of them still
cunningly delaied of by this duke Brianto, who being married to the queen,
mother to Valeria, and therefore chosen protector and gouerner of the kingdom
of Calipha, till the Princess should be married, pretended so much as in him
lay, both to keep her from marriage, and to put her by the kingdom, which
being foresene by others of the nobillity, they so wrought in the matter, that
a day was appointed of a general Just, wherein that Prince that could most
valiently demean himself, should have for his prise, the young Princess
Valeria, and she for her doury the kingdom of Calipha.

By this time Antipholus the Prince of Illeria, who had undertaken the persute
of Brusanus and his sister Moderna, was come into the borders of Calipha, who
understanding what preparation was made by so many gallant Princes, he
determined with himself to try his valor amongst them, the which he intended,
rather for his own exercise, then for any desire he had to the prise, having
as yet never seen the Princess: he therefore speedely repairing to the City
of Sara, provided himself of all things best beseeming his honor.

The third Chapter.
How Antipholus demeaned himself in the Just, he wins the Princess, who
most willinglye surrendereth herself, he leaves her for a season, following
his pursuit of Brusanus to Constantinople.

IT would ask his here a very long time, if I should discourse at large of
every particular: as first to signify the several Princes, accompanied with
such troops of armed Knights, that it seemed the mighty host of Alexander,
when he took in hand the conquest of the world: then the riches and bravery
of their fortunes, with their straung and quaint devices: the numbers both of
lords and ladies that came from diverse far and straung countries, but to
look on, and behold the manner of these enterprises: the beauty and brauerye
of the ladies and gentlewemen, amongst whom Valeria showed no less majesty,
then the moon in perfect clearnes, amongst the dimmest stars, and it were
ouer-long, and nothing to my purpose, to set down every man's particular
actions, to discribe how many spears were crushed, how many hardye knights
were borne to the grownd, both man and horse, and how many wonderful
exploites of chivalry was that day performed: suffices this, that Antipholus
entering the listes amongst the rest, and casting up his eyes to the scaffold
where the Princess Valeria sat accompanied with many other ladies, he was
greatly abashed to see her beauty, which he judged to be more heavenly or
aungelicall, then human or earthly: this sudden aspects, had as suddenly
kindeled such a flame in his breast, that I can deem no less, but it both
fortified his strength and courage, for Antipholus so demeined himself against
al co^mers, that as many as did behold him, both wondered at his valor, and
praised his virtue, and thus he continued from the first to the very last, the
heralds with the hole company of lookers on, adjudged him the most worthy of
all the rest, yet was there no man that knew what he might be, but they all
concluded that if his birth and calling, were answerable to his valiaunce and
prowess, that there could not be wished a more honorable match for the
Princess. Valeria her self beating into her head the remembrance of his noble
acts, and hearing the opinion of the standers by* was desirous both to see
and know him, that had now so great an interest in her: Antipholus again,
making have to challenge his dew, came before the Princess, where unlacing
and putting of his helmet, he kneled down humbly kissing her hands,
proffering his further service in any thing wherein it pleased her to employ
him: and having now made himself known to the hole presence, he further
added thus much to Valeria: and although (excelent Princess) I must confess
mine own merit to be nothing, in comparison of so great a benefit, which I
hope to attain unto, rather by the virtue of a gracious consent, then
other-wise by any thing of mine own desert: yet being encouraged by your own
conditions openly proclaimed at the beginning of the Iustes: and being
entitled by the general award of the Judges and heralds appointed for the
purpose: I am now accordingly to challenge that prise, of greater estimation (in
mine own conceit) then if the signory of the whole world had happened unto
me: This Princess Valeria understanding him now to be so great a Prince, and
although love had already made entry in the most secret part of her heart, by
the view of his knight-hoode, so now the same breach being made wider by the
second assault of his beautiful looks: love entered with banner openly
displaied, and finding no resistance, took possession wholly of her heart,
swearing al her affections, to be his true prisoners, she being now wholly
surprised with an encounter of love and bashfullnes, mildly made him answer in
these few words: Worthy Prince Antipholus, as I am not to resist the
ordinance of my friends that he most careful for me, so I must not gain say
those conditious whereunto I have voluntarily tied my self, by public
proclamation, neither do I think it fit for mine honor, to make show of
squemishnes to a Prince of such excelent virtue, when the whole multitude are
(as it were) eye witnesses, of so great magnanimity and prowess, you may
therefore (noble Prince) accounte of Valeria as your proper right, and Valeria
here voweth to Antipholus, faith, love and loyallty: The Queen Eriphila
accompanied with the nobility of Calypha, came with cheerful countenance to
entertain Antipholus, thanking the heavenly powers altogether, that hade
vouchsafed so great good fortune to their young Princess, Thus were they all
filled with exceeding joy, Bryanto only excepted, who seeing his devises would
no longer serve, to shift Valeria from marriage, was now debating with him
self what course he might take to bring her to her end, the which he thought
to be the ready way for the accomplishment of the rest of his purpose: and lo,
opportunity seemed ready to further his intent: for Antipholus (as you have hard
before) had undertaken this travel to find out Brusanus and his sister
Moderna, and having yet got no intelligence of them, he would needs prosecute
his journey to Constantynople, where if he could hear no other news, he would
then make his return, when with a more quiet conscience, and a better settled
mind, he might perform their marriage rightes, to both their contentacions: in
the mean time he committed his dearest Lady to the custody of her mother,
protesting, that in what coast or cuntry so ever he should happen into, that
his heart should remain dedicated to her divine beauty and virtue, and so
commending her health to the Gods, he thus took his leave.

The fourth Chaprer.
Bryanto falls in love with Calynda, she bewrays it to Eriphila, how he is
deluded by them both, and of other his ungracious and villianous intents.

Bryanto had now leisure to cast about, and debating with himself of many
wholesome attemptes, in the end he honestly resolved with all speed to practice
the death, both of the Queen his wife, and of the Princess her daughter, by
the death of the Princess he hoped to compass the crown, and by the death of
the Queen, he should set himself at liberty to take an new wife. For Calynda
remaining in the court (as you have hard) attendant on the Queen: although
she had so cunningly counterfieted her state, that she was not known what she
was, yet she could not hide the perfection of her beauty, but she had so
entangled Bryanto the Duke, that he had many times assayed to practice her to
his beastly appetite, to the which because she refused to consent (led by the
rage of his inordinate lust) he determined to rid away his wife, to that end to
marry her. For the performance of these premises, he took this course: he
appointed a day to ride into the forest a hunting, pretending great sport, and
done only to show the young Princess some pleasure, finding her so dumpish
for the departure of Antipholus? for this purpose he had well fed a cupple of
ruffians of his own training up, the one he appointed to ride before the young
Princess Valeria, the other should likewise be attendant till opportunity
served: it was agreed that these two in the midest of their sportes, and when
they were most busied in following the chase, should sudainely slip into some
by way with the Princess, and helping them selves by the benifite of the
couertes, when they had her alone from the rest of the company, without any
remorse, they should despatch her of her life, then bestowing the body in some
secret place that it might never more be found, they should both of them fly
into some other country, where besides ye reward which the duke for this
purpose had already bestowed upon the^, he promised still from time to time
secretly to relieve them with greater sums. This determination thus set down,
in this meantime Calynda had made the Queen Eriphila privy to the whole
demeanure of the amarous Duke her husband: fearing* that he should have
attempted her by some extraordinary mean of force: The Queen nothing doubting
of the tale, would needs entreat Calynda the next night to appoint the Duke to
her lodging, where she her self would both supply her place, and abite all
other adventures what so ever should befall, and with much ado she won her to
grant to it: Calynda the next day accordingly, finding opportunity, she told
the Duke, that yet in the end, she was moved with compassion of his long suit,
and that if it pleased him the same night to repair to her chamber at a
convenient time, he should (...) it no great matter to open the door, desiring
his grace yet to use great circumspection, although not for her cause, yet for
his honor: Bryanto, hearing this heavenly harmony, thought himself already to
be a sure possessor of his desires, and kissing her hands, vowing many
protested services, he left her for the present, to whom the rest of the day
seemed tedious, but night being once approached, according to his instructions,
accompanied only with a Gentleman of his chamber, called by the name of
Lucius, whom the Duke made still acquainted with all his ungracious actions,
and many times used his help as a broker in the like enterprises, and groping
thus together through many dark rooms, they happened in the end to the
chamber of Calynda, where pushing easily at the door, and finding it open
according to promise, the Duke entered, leaving Lucius to attend his coming
out, as soon as he was gotten into the chamber he went to the bed, where
leaping in on that side, which (indeed) was left of purpose for him, and having
his spirits altogether blinded with this sweet immaginatio^ of embracing his
desired Calynda, in whose place (as before it was couenanted) he found Eriphila,
the queen his wife: who with a determinate patience had taken upon her for
that night to abide all accidents intended to Calynda: But the Duke passing
forth the night more happy in contemplating this action, remembering himself
that the same morning was the appointed time of his going a hunting, and
minding not to let slip a matter, which he immagined would fall out to so good
an issue, intending therefore to take his leave, and thinking now that he had
her so fully at commandment, that he might trust her with all his secrets,
at the time of his departing he told her that in requital of her courtesy, he
meant not only to make her his married wife, but very shortly to crown her
Queen of Calypha, in the acomplishment whereof, he must use her as a witness
against his wife, whom he meant very speedily to accuse of adultry, when her
witness, with one other (of whom he was already provided) would be a
sufficient testimony (according to their laws) to condemn her to be burnt,
assuring her further if this should fail, rather then he would be longer
cumberd, with her whom he did so inwardly detest, himself would give her
poison, or otherwise with his own hands, he would make some riddaunce of her:
The poor Lady hearing the doom of her own destruction, in this manner
intended by her husband, you may immagin, was in a pitious plight, but fearing
to bewray her self, with a faint voice, she gave consent to accomplish his
desires: The Duke thus taking his leave, departed not with so great joy, but
he left her perplexed with a great deal of more grief

The fifth Chaptper.
Valeria in the forest is distessed by two villianes, was rescued by Brusanus,
he conueieth her to a place of safety.

IN the morning, who was so early up and ready as the princess Valeria, she
was calling to horse before a great many were out of their beds, full little
knew she what was practiced toward her, the Queen her mother excused her
self from riding that day, faining to be il at ease, for she vnderanstding what
the duke pretended toward her, thought it not good to let slip any opportunity
that might befall her to prevent his practice: but minding the same day, while
they were gone a hunting, to fly into Boetia to the king (who was her brother)
for the safety of her life: but let us follow the hunters that by this time
were in the forest: you know what game the duke hunted after, unhappy man,
after an innocent ladies life: but the hunts men rowsed a greater stagge, the
hounds were vncupled, the duke himself was one of the first in the chase, the
rest followed, they all tended their sport, my two forespoken companions
watched their time, and hitting on a way that lay through a mighty covert of
trees, he that had the Princess behind him, turned into that way, the other
was hard at his heels, the poor lady seeing one followed so fast, misdoubted
nothing, on they rid, til at the last they were clean out of hearing of the
hounds, and had likewise lost all the rest of their company, when one of the
verlets speaking to her said: Madame, which of us twains would your self now
make choice on to take the first fruits of your good will, your friend
Antipholus is gone to Constantinople to seek adventures, and I se no reason
but you might likewise adventure of a friend, that you your self may well like
off, when he has so little care so lightly to leave you: The Princess
amassed to hear this saucye demand, answered: Presumteous villain, how
dare thou account to make such an offer unto me, do thou think I will
digest so notable an injury, no assure thy self I will be revenged to the
uttermost of thy villainy: Alas madame (quoth the other) and are you so ready to
seek revenge for demau^ding of a question, when he has but honestlye sought
to persuade that by courtesy, the which if it pleased him or me, we may both
constrain by cruelty, but content your self, and answer more directly,
consent you must, and yield you shall, here are no flocks of friends to
defend you, and if you knew your own case, you would be glad both to curry
favor, and to speak fair. The poor lady looking better about her, and
perceiving her self to be singled out from the rest of her company, and
finding by their presumtious speeches that she was betrayed, replied thus:
Alas, the only limits of your request, is my destruction, and your detestable
demand, more odious unto me then death: but if my case be so hard as you do
persuade, I beseech you both to determine of my death to the saving of mine
honor: Well madame (answered the other of the villains) some thing to
satisfy your desire (having the law in our own hands) we will first serve our
own appetites, then after we will not stick to rid you of your life, to the
end you shall not longer live to languish in grief: This said, they turned out
of the way into a mighty thicket of bushes, as covertly shrouded with high and
mighty trees, and the Princess dreading badde measure, began in pitious manner
to cry out for help, but alas in a place so unfrequented, that there was no
mortal creature to resounde an Echo to her exclamations, the which the
villains knowing well, took her down from her horse: and forceably casting
her against the ground, began violently to assault her chastity, she still
defending her self so much as her feeble force would permit her, and even at
that instant, when she was deprived of al other resistance, Brusanus, who lyeng
in that desert in such desperate passion (as before you have hard) fortuned to
come by, and hearing the pitiful shrickes of a woman, made to the place from
whence he hard the voice, and perceiving the destressed Princess, he opposed
himself in her defense, and at the very first encounter, he slew the one of
those wretches, the other not able to make longer resistance, fell down of his
knees offering himself to the mercy of Brusanus, who first disfurnishing him
of his weapon, willed him to recompt unto him what gentlewoman that same might
be, and what his fellow and he meant in such villainous manner to attempt her,
he answered thus: Noble gentleman (for your valiant demeanure undoubtedly
persuades me of your title) for the lady, I will leave it to her own
confession to manifest what she is, for my fellow who by your valiance lies
hear slain, his name is Eurestus, my self called Vago, both of us trained
up from our infancy, in the court of Brianto duke of Doletta, protector and
gouerner hear in this kingdom of Calipha: and both of us feed by him to have
murdered this lady: and for our better opportunity (it was likewise by himself
devised) that in the time of hunting here in this forest we should take
occasion to perform our enterprise, the which (after we had both satisfied our
ungracious apetites) had you not come thus to the rescues, we had undoubtedly
accomplished: Thus sir I have briefly showed, we should have been the
ministers (though not the authors) of an innocent ladies death, but that it
has pleased God (by your good help) thus miraculouslye to preserve her, no
doubt to a better purpose: Vago having thus ended his tale, Brusanus, not yet
knowing whom he had rescued, curtiously demanded of her what she was: the
Princess dryeng her dropping eyes, and prostrating her self humbly at his
feet, she said: Touching your demand, know sir, I am by birth a Princess
(though as you see unfortunate) and more unfortunate (by the speeches of this
traitor) then before I was a ware off, in that he seeks to practice my death,
in whom I reposed the greatest safety of my life: But woe, yea endless woe
befall that ungrateful trattor* Brusanus, by whose villainy I am brought to this
misery, and whose only treachery is the cause of my mishap but alas sir, what
thanks may I now render to recompense your courtesy, or how shall I be able
to reward this your his desert: Brusanus hearing himself thus evil spoken off
maruailed at the matter, but in the end he said: Is it possible (madame) that
this Brusanus you speak off, would so prejudice the quiet of a Princess, to
give you cause thus to exclaim against him: Valeria here discoursing at large
with Brusanus, made himself understand, that she was the daughter and heir to
Belizarius, the late king of Calipha: how he had left her the inheritrixe to
the kingdom. How many Princes sought to win her love: how at a general
Just appointed to the same purpose, Antipholus Prince of Illeria, by his own
valor and worthiness wanne her from all the rest. Here she began to relate the
whole circumstances of the amorous incounters that happened between Antipholus
and her self: and from hence she drew the cause of her quarrel to Brusanus,
for (quoth she) this mutual love being thus confirmed between us, when I
desired it should longest have continued, and hoped to have settelled my self
in a state of greater blessedness, even then Antipholus (to perform a
certain vow before solemnized to his father) would needs undertake to trauail
in the pursuit of this wretched Brusanus, who not long before had
traytorously conuaied his sister away from out his and her fathers court: by
this means am I spoiled of my greatest solace, bereaved of that rest, wherein
consists my only delight: and by this means, yea by this only means, I am
left (as you see) subject to the inconstancy of cruel fortune: Here she began
again very bitterly to rage against Brusanus, who even then ouer-taken with
the guiltines of his own conscience, which is euer-more a severe accuser, and
to the impenitent person: a most terrible Judge: the very name of Antipholus
was a scourg to his conscience, adding new grief to old sorrow, and wishing
with himself not longer to live a despised run-agate, knowing that Antipholus
sought him but for revenge, and the worst of his malice he knew could be but
death, and that was the best thing that might betide him: after he had a while
debated of these things to himself, he said: Madame, so far as I can
gather by your words, the only thing wherein you account your self to be
unfortunate, is in the want of your beloved friend Antipholus, whose greatest
cause of travel (as you say) is to seek out that wretched Brusanus, a creature
(no doubt (accursed from his crable: and if this be the only fruit to your
felicities, send after Antipholus, at whose return (to work your comfort
and his quiet) I will deliver Brusanus into his hands, and in such a manner,
as Antipholus shall have advantage enough to be revenged of any Injuries,
what-soeuer: in the mean time, what course it shall please you to direct me
for your own self, you shall find me ready to employ my whole endeavors to do
you service: After the Princess had given him infinite thanks, they fell to
consulting how she might remain in some secret place for a season, in the end
her self called to mind a gentleman, dwelling not far of by the side of the
forest, that had been a faithful servant to her father, to his house she
desired to be conuaid, but the day being far spent, they were driven for that
night to lodge in the forest, with such entertainment as Brusanus had provided
in a cave not very far off: the next day very early in the morning Vago was
their guide to their desired place, who me Brusanus reserved of purpose to
testify against the Duke: Being thus come to this gentleman's house, whose name
was called Fuluius, they were both secretly and curiouslye entertained, where
we will leave them for that night, having other matters in the mean time
wherewith to aquaint you.

The sixth Chapter.
Eriphila pretending flight into Boetia, was intercepted, brought back to the
Duke, he commits her to prison, her death is practiced by a counterfeit
devise, she is brought to the place of execution

YOu have hard before how the Queen Eriphila, to prevent all perils intended
by her husband, resolved to fly into Boetia, and minding to let slip no
opportunity, the Duke was no sooner gone toward the forest, but she (a great
deal more privily then prouidently) fled from the court. It was long before
the Duke returned from the forest, and the reason was, the young Princess
Valeria being sudainely lost, they spent much time in seeking her, and yet
returned without any news, but the Duke being come home, and having got
intelligence of his wives sudaine departure, wondered greatly what might be the
cause of her flight, and although he could not conjecture the certainty,
thought it not good to suffer her so to pass, but assuring himself which way
to send after her, caused such hasty pursuit to be made, that she could by no
means possibly escape, but being brought back again to the Duke, he
commanded her presently to close prison: and having framed the platform of
her confusion already in his head, in this manner he meant to perform it.
There was a knight resident about the court called by the name of Arcadyus: a
man famed through all Greece for his prowess and strength, and one that by his
force and chiuallry had performed so many notable exploites, that by the
general opinion of all, he was thought to be so singullar, as there might not
be found an other to second him: and truly had his virtue bin aunswereable to
his valor, he might well have bin thought peerless, of all the knights that
lived in those parts: but the want of honesty was a great stain to his
honor: this Arcadyus had a daughter of most exquisit beauty and about sixteen
or seauenteene years of adge, called by the name of Lucina, whose looks had so
alured our licentious duke (who was quickly scorched with the blase of every
beauty) and having now forgotten his promised vow to his supposed Calynda, he
burnt with such inward desire to this Gentlewoman Lucina, that being assuredly
confirmed in the large conscience of her father, he immediately sent for him,
and being men of like disposition, it was quickly concluded between them,
that Arcadyus should accuse Eriphila the Queen, as accessory to the murdering
of her own daughter the young Princess Valeria, and that the matter might
carry the more credit, a cause was put down, what might so much inrage the
Queen against her daughter, and thus it was devised: about ten years
forepassed in the wars holden between Astulpho king of Illeria, father to
Antipholus, and Canace, king of Boeria, brother to Eriphila: Valdus (being then
general of the Boetian army under his brother Canace) incountering in the
plain field with Astulpho, was himself slain, his army put to flight, and
the whole forces of the Boetians so infeebled and discouraged: that Canace (to
purchase a peace) was driven to surrender to the king of Illeria, the famous
City of Auarra, besides other great sommes of money, in satisfaction of
certain demands challenged by Astulpho: Eriphila being yet gauled with these
griefs: but especially desirous to reueng the death of her brother Valdus
upon Antipholus, practiced first with her daughter to poison him, who refusing
her, for the entire love she bare to Antipholus, to whom she rather desired to
be linked in marriage, then to wish him any misfortune, the least that might
befall, whereat Eriphila being wonderfully discontented, and fearing her
daughter should bewrae her intent, she posted over the matter to Arcadyus
himself, and having first acquainted him with all former circumstaunces, she
labored him (so much as in her lay) both by curtious entreaties, and liberal
promises, that he would undertake privily to murder the Prince Antipholus:
but he loathing so detestable an enterprise, both utterly refused it, and with
all duty and faithfullnes, willed the queen to desist the farther attempt of
such odible practices, so much unbeseeming a lady of her estate: but her choler
so much the more kindeled, and the rather for that she was prevented from
farther attempts, by reason Antipholus so sudainely departed on his pretended
journey: she therefore turned the fury of her reueng (contrary to nature)
against her own daughter: and thinking to prevent Antipholus, of his greatest
felicity, which he especially accounted to be in the love of Valeria, and
minding to reueng her conceived displeasure against her daughter, for denieng
to poison Antipholus, and for the accomplishment of altogether, having found a
cupple of companions fit for her purpose, the stratageme (of her own
devising) was accordingly performed while they were hunting in the forest,
where the innocent princess (by the appointment of her unnatural mother) was
creuelly murdered, and the actors fled into Boetia, where the queen her self
intended to have met them, seeking her saftie by hasty flight, fearing that her
deuilysh devises should have broken out: This accusation thus cleanely coined
between them, the duke intended the very next day to make riddaunce of his
wife, and the rather for the desire he had to his new bride, which was a
persell of the couenantes agreed on between the duke and Arcadyus, that Lucina
should be a duchess at the least, but they rested in hope to crown her a
queen: The next day very early in the morning, the duke craving the
assistaunce of diverse noble men (such as he knew to be nearest adicted to
his own disposition) consulting with them of many causes touching the state,
then making semblaunce of great sorrow, for the loss of the princess Valeria,
and the rather when they knew not what account they might render to the world,
what should become of her, yet seeming to carry a hope of her recovery, being
fully persuaded in his mind, that she was but straied out of the way, having
lost themselves in the forest, and did therefore think it very convenient to
send out great search into every quarter, to see it they could find her either
alive or dead. While these causes were in discoursing, Arcadyus presenting
himself before them, craving their patience in hearing a matter of such
remorse, as to reveal was grievous unto him, because it touched such persons
as he had ever highly reverenced, and to conceall it, he durst not, for that it
would prove a scourg to his own conscience: he was willed breefely to deliver
his doubt, and if he were by any means wronged, they were there ready to render
him right: Arcadyus here (as before it was devised between the duke and him)
accused Eriphila with the murdering of her own daughter, the manner whereof,
because it is before specified, I may therefore here omit, but the
circumstaunces were not between them so cunningly counterfeited, but the
matter by Arcadyus was as artificially auowed, and although the discourse were
smoothed to the purpose, yet there was nothing so much confirmed his tale to be
true, as the queens own flight, in that she sought so privily to steal away,
and no man could immagine any cause wherefore: But the duke having given
attentive ear to the whole speeches of Arcadyus, seemed to the beholders to be
wonderfully troubled in his mind, and breathing forth a pitious sighe, as if
his very soul had bin passionate with anguish and grief he said. Arcadyus,
do thou know what thou have said, and whom thou have accused, assure thy
self, if thou art not able sufficiently to prove as much as thou have here
presented, that besides the asperity and rigor of the laws in these causes
provided, there is neither torture, nor any torment that may be devised, but
they shall fall al to thyshare: I crave no favor (answered Arcadyus) and I am
here ready (according to the laws) to maintain my right by way of combat,
against any man that dare auowe the contrary: I take thy word (answered the
duke) and for that it shall not be said I will smoother up a matter so
hateful to all ears, for any love or favor to the perverting of justice, I
do here award (though with a sorrowful spirit) that to morrow by ten of
the clock in the morning Eriphila (whom till this hour I have so tenderly
loved) shall without all remorse be burned, as a most unnatural woman that
would conspire the death of her own child, and if by that hour (in her
defense) she be not provided of a champion, who by trial of battle shall
aquite her of all accusations wherewith thou have here charged her. The
ordinance of the duke being thus set down, Arcadyus (who altogether presumed
of his own strengeth) although he thought no man so hardy to encounter him,
yet he provided himself against the time: the duke on the other side, thinking
his pain now altogether past, was devising of his mariag day, immagining
himself already to be a widower, and indeed, by general opinion, they all
accounted the queen to be but as a dead woman, in these cogitations the time
runs on, and the next morning, without the walls of the City on a very
fair green, was the place appointed for ye execution, the clock stroke 9, and
there was no man hard off that durst appose himself in ye queens defense, she
was led forth to ye place where she should suffer: who with pitious sighs and
sobbs, bewraied the inward sorrow of her heart, which moved great compassion
to all beholders: Arcadius was ready in the place (bravely mounted, and
strongly armed) to mainetaine his accusation, the Lady assuring her self that
her death was there determined, was not so much terrified with the torture,
as the slander, but knowing no better mean then with patience to suffer,
humbly falling on her knees and holding up her hands, she besought the heavens
to receive her guiltless soul, and although her body should be consumed by
the fury of the fire, that the flames might yet descry the Innocence of her
cause: the lookers on letting fall abundance of tears, to see this pitiful
spectacle, although they knew not what Judgment to settle touching her
accusation, yet they all lamented her misfortune concerning her condemnation:
It was now a good half hour after nine of the clock, when Arcadius speaking
to the executioners said: What is the matter (my friends) that you make so long
delay, spending the time in vain, what do you think theer is any man so
fool hardye that dare enter the listes with me in this quarrel: if you know
any such or if that be your stay, let him come forth, and you shall see I will
soon make him repent his presumption, when it shall be to late for him to
confess his foolish enterprise.

The seventh Chapter.
Brusanus rescueth Eriphila by combat, Arcadius confesses their conspiricy,
clears Eriphila and dies.

AFter Eriphila had made her hartye prayers unto God she was brought to the
stake, when the last act to finishe up the tragedy was to put fire to the
fuel, but God who never forsakes Innocents in their necessity, vouchsafed
speedye help, for this lady now standing (as it were) equally betwixt life
and death (though neither fearing the one nor hoping the other) is yet
comforted contrary to all expectation: for a servant belonging to Fuluius
having been in the City, and learned all the news: returned directly to his
master, relating unto him how it stood with the queen, who the next day was
to be executed, for conspiring the death of the young Princess her daughter:
when Fuluius had certified these news to Brusanus and Valeria, after they had
a while paused on the matter, and had aduisedlye considered of the treachery of
the Duke. Brusanus would needs undertake the combat in the behalf of the
queen, and being furnished by Fuluius both of horse, armoure, and all other
necessaries fit for such an enterprise, at this very instant when the
executioners were ready to put fire to the fuel, Brusanus presentinge
himself before the principal officers said: Is it possible (worthy gentlemen)
that a poor innocent lady should thus be condemned to dye before she has
been personally brought to araignement, not being suffered to answer for her
self, but upon the bare assertion of a knight, if never before detected, yet
in this case, necessarily to be suspected: or do you not think that the Duke
her husband, who upon small causes became her Iayler, will not upon less
occasion become her murderer: but he makes Justice the cloak of tirany, and
shall that bleare your eyes not to see his subtilty: The whole company wondered
at the bold speeches of this straung knight, but as there was not any man
there that could immagine what he should be, so not one amongst them all
would give him any one word to answer: Arcadius standing by, said as
follows: Why who art thou, or what art thou called, that wanting courage to
perform as a knight, art thus come hither to persuade with words like a
cowarde, do thou think thy Philosophy enough to incunter the point of my
sword: thou have been to ill advised in meddling with this matter, that can
warrant thee no better then thine own destruction: Brusanus advisedly noting
these presumptuous speeches answered: Touching thy demand, who I am, or what
I am called, I list not in that point to make thee any answer, yet thus much
to satisfy thy desire, assure thy self I am a knight (no cowarde) and am come
hither to abate thy pride and to chastise thy presumption, that contrary to the
order of knight-hoode, thou have dared to charge an Innocente Princess with so
false and untrue an accusation: and that thou might the rather perceive, I
am not come hither to perswad more by words, then I mind fully to perform in
deeds, I am here ready in the behalf of the queen, by way of combat to make
trial against thee that thou have most falsely and shamefully slaundered her.
Why then (quoth Arcadius) to the end that I may with the more speed minister
correction to thy folly, let us delay no longer time with words, but prepare
thy self to the battaill, for it seems unto me, every minit to be a monthe,
until I have taken a full revenge of this thy witless enterprise: Without any
more words had between them, they separate themselves to take their course,
then spurring their steedes with a mighty Carere, they encounter she one of
them against the others spears so directlye leuelled, and therewithal, so
strongly charged, that they were both shiuered into small pieces, the beholders
wondered at the force of the strange knight, but Arcadius himself was much more
amassed, who never before that time hade felt the like encounter, and being now
in a pelting chafe, with his drawn sword, he turned to Brusanus, who in like
manner was as ready to receive him, the battle then began so fiersly between
them, that in very short space they made evident proof of their courage and
manhood, the valiant knights malissing each at others welfare, finding their
armoures so good that no sword would enter, were both of them made so angry,
that they laid so much the faster about them: the fight continued a long time
so indifferent, that the beholders were not able to Judge which party had the
better: in the end Arcadius began to rate with himself, thinking that his
wonted force had left him, because in his whole life time until that present
day, he had never met with any man that was able to endure half so long
against him: Brusanus again, knowing his quarrel to be Just, and therefore
not offenciue to God, thought himself dishonored that a perjured knight
should stand so long before him: both of them thus blowing the coals of their
anger, which were already set on a fire, the fray began again between them
more eager then ever it had been before: so that the whole multitude were
filled with great admiration, to see such extraordinarye prowess between the
two knights, but Brusanus comforting himself with the equity of his cause,
discharged so mighty a blow at the head of Arcadius, that not-with-standing
his helmet was forged of so fine steel that no sword might pearce it, yet the
weight of the stroke was such, that it brought Arcadius into such amasement
that he tumbled from his horse, and fell down dend to the ground, where at
the beholders altogether gave a great shoute thinking him assuredlye to be
slain: you may immagine this was a comfortable sight to the queen, of whose
safety there was so little hope, that they left her still standing bound
fast to the stake: but Brusanus alighting from his horse, paced easily
toward Arcadius, and seeing him lying in such an ecstasy, thought it would
have been to great a disparagment to his honor, to have stricken a knight
lyeng in his case: walking therefore some few turns, Arcadius in the mean
time recovering again his senses, suddenly start up, and grasping his sword
in both his hands, smote Brusanus behind him, such a blow upon the head,
that his legs began to yield under his body, and much ado he had to recover
himself from falling: here began again a more fierce and terrible encounter
on foot, then all that had passed before on horsbacke: but Brusanus
determining to make a short dispatche, heaped such blows upon Arcadius,
that he vnreuited his right poulderne, so that his whole shoulder lay all
disarmed, and Brusanus marking the advantage struck him so mighty a blow, that
he gave him there a mortal wound, wherewith Arcadius let fall his sword to
the ground, not longer able to make resistance: Brusanus likewise stayeng his
hand, said unto him: Sir knight, the noble courage that I have found to be in
thee, makes me to pity thy case, have now compassion of thy self, and
hasarde not the perdition both of thy body and soul, by dyeng in a wrong
cause, restore the lady again to that reputation, wherein thou have so
injuriously slaundered her, and live: What (quoth. Arcadius) do thon think,
though fortune has favored thee in attaining the battaill that my courrage
does fail me, in persisting to the uttermost what I have undertaken, no, I
both de^^e thee and that compassion, wherewith (as thou say) thou art
moved toward me, follow thy advantage which opportunity has offered thee,
fortune may assist thee to glory in my death, but in the conquest of my mind,
thou shall never have cause to triumph: Brusanus finding him in this desperate
resolution, said unto him: Unhappy man, although thou have no greater regard
to thine own salvation, yet God defend that I should be the instrument of thy
everlasting perdition, neither is it my custom to oppress him that is
irresistable, and although thou deniest to confess thy shameful impositions
wherewith thou have slaundered the Queen, yet assure thy self I have other
sufficient means to make the matter so evident, as all the world shall
witness of thy treachery, and that to thy greater shame: for the rest I leave
it between God and thine own conscience, beseching the heavens thou may
yet live to repent, for any other harm, I wish thee none at all: Arcadius,
noting the virtue of this stranger knight, after he had a little deliberated
with himself, was stroke into a sudden remorse of his own conscience, and
having lost the greatest part of his blood by the largnes of his wound,
feeling himself now to begin to faint, he called for the principal
maiestrates and officers there present, before whom he confessed the whole
conspiracy between the Duke and himself, fully aquiting the Queen of all
former suppositions, and he had not scarce finished his speeches, but his
breath vanished into the air and left his body senseless.

The eyghth Chapter.
Eriphila is restored: the young Princess Valeria presented to the
maiestrates, Brianto murdereth himself, Antipholus, is returned.

Upon this confession they presently enlarged the queen, ioyfuly restoring
her to her former honor, and waiting upon her withal duetifull attendaunce,
the multitude gave hearty thanks unto god that had thus safely delivered their
good queen, who had ever demeaned her self most graciously to all subjects:
here they began with general exclamation so accuse the duke in sundry points
of tirany: Brusanus, finding so fit opportunity, gentelly requested the whole
company a little while to stay, for that he had a matter of great importance
wherewith to aquaint them, by this time they might see a small company came
riding toward them, as they drew near they might perceive a gentleman who
rode all before the rest, with a gentlewoman behind him, the man they knew to
be Fuluius, of the woman they could have no weting, for that her face was
covered with a scarf: then might they see an other who was bound as a
prisoner, and surely guarded with armed men, whom they knew to be Vagoe, being
altogether thus come to the whole prese, Brusanus humbly kissing his hand,
took down the gentlewoman, and leading her by the hand before the maiestrates
he said: Behold I deleuer here amongst you, your young princess, of whose
fafetie I would wish you should have a greater regard then hitherto you have
had, for the rest of her adventure, and what fortune has betaine her, I leave
to her own report: discovering then her face by taking away the vayll, the
whole assembly knew her assuredly to be their princess Valeria: here began
again a greater admiration then any what so ever had hitherto happened: but
Valeria breefely related unto them, the manner how she was conveyed from the
rest of her company as they were hunting in the forest, the villainy that was
offered unto her by Vago and his fellow Frestus, and how she was miraculously
delivered by this stranger knight Aristo (for Brusanus not otherwise willing
to be known, so named himself) Vago confirmed these premises to be true,
confessing further how the duke had hired both him and his fellow to murder
the princess, and how that days pleasure of hunting was appointed to no other
purpose, but for their opportunity to perform that enterprise, these matters
being thus manifested, the maiestrates presently appointed a guard as well in
the defense of the princess, as also of the queen her mother, and certain
noblemen were chosen to hold the government in the behalf of the princess,
until the return of Antipholus from Constantinople: The duke by espialls
having got inteligence of all these premises, and finding himself to be
frunted in all his enterprises, and that his whole conspiracies were thus
broken out, being private in his chamber only accompanied with Lucius, the man
that was most trusted with all his ungracious practices, burst out into these
speeches and said. O caitife most accursed, has thy fortune concluded with
this consequence, is this the fruits of thy long premeditated practice, have
thou laid a plot for thy advancement to honor, and is it broken out to thy
eternal shame and infamy, o what else what better could thou look for, has
not thy practices bin abominable, thy enterprises detestable, thy endeavors
hateful, and the whole course of thy life filthy and odible, o that the
bowels of the earth would now open and devour my treasons, my conspiracies,
and other my shameless deameanures, together with this detestable body, that
the world might be purged of this filthy infection, and the remembrance of
both might dye to all posterity, but what stand thou upon these points,
thou art now to sit upon thy self as judge, and against thy self to
pronounce judgment, despair then wretch in thine own wickedness, and let a
desperate death finish that cursed life that was so prone to mischief, and so
ready to persist in all deuilesh wickedness: without any further speeches he
sudainelye struck him self through the body with his own dagger, where with
Lucius crieng for help, many came rushing into the chamber, where the Duke lay
weltering in his own blood, so that in very short space his life vanished, and
left his body breathless, the rumor of the dukes death was subainly spread
through the city, and officers were immediately sent to examine the
circumstaunces, who to find out the better certainty appehended Lucius, whom
after they had many ways apposed, he voluntaryly confessed, that the only
cause why the duke had so practiced the death of the queen his wife, was for
the love he bare to Calynda, who being many times lovingly solicited by the
duke, in the end an nights meeting was agreed on between them, when they both
confirmed their amorous desires, and likewise concluded the death of the queen,
Calynda hoping to succeed for a second bride to the duke: upon thie
confession they attached Calynda, committing her to close prison, assuring her
no better favor, then the aspirity of the laws would alot her: Brusanus being
still resident in the city, refused sundry rich presents, liberal offers, and
honorable courtesies, presented unto him as well by the young princess as by
the queen her mother, and languishing now in grief, with the memory of his
former fortunes, he knew no better mean to make satisfaction to Moderna, then
to suffer himself to be sacrifised by the hands of her brother Antipholus,
whom he knew had pursued him but to that end to be revenged, resting
therefore in this resolution, not otherwise known then by the name of Aristo:
it was not long but Antipholus returned, who was received into the city with
great honor and triumph, but what joy was made by the princess Valeria, I
dare not undertake to discipher, and you may well think it was much.

The ninth Chapter.
Brusanus and Antipholus are brought to meet in a gardin, the manner of their
encounter, Valeria: pacifieth Antipholus, he protests frendeship to Brusanus.

SOme few days ouer-passed thus in pleasure, in which mean space Antipholus
was made acquainted with every stratagem practiced both against the princess
and her mother, although the narrow escape (especially of his most dearest
beloved) gave him great cause to rejoice, yet failing of that revenge he
intended to Brusanus, his mirth was something mitigated, with this gaul of
coffeehouse: which being espied by Valeria, whose eyes were still watchful
over her beloved, by an east intercesion, he confessed unto her the cause of
his grief: Valeria calling to mind the promise Aristo had before made unto her
in the forest, comforted Antipholes, assuring him within very short space, so
to deliver Brusanus into his hands, as at his own discretion he might
minister such punishment as to himself might seem sufficient, and although
Antipholus, wist not what means Valeria, had to effect such a matter, so much
by himself desired, yet he rested something satisfied, hoping she would bring
it to pass according as she had promised: Valeria minding to loose no time,
sent immediately to Aristo to challeng his promise in the premises: Aristo then
setteled in opinion as before you have heard: returned this answer, that
notwithstanding he must confess Brusanus to be a most unfortunate creature,
yet he likewise knew him to be a prince, and therefore consideration was to
be had, and that for diverse respects not to betray him openly: but if he might
be brought privily to speak with Antipholus, in some secret place between
themselves, he would not then refuse so to satisfy Antipholus in his desires,
as it should well apeare that Aristo had well discharged the office of a friend,
although not to Brusanus, yet to Valeria: the greatest matter that was now to
be cared for, was how to bring Antipholus and Aristo into some place secretly
to confer, which was not long in performing, for the very next morning
Valeria caused Aristo to be privily conveyed through her own palace into a
most delicate orchard, very larg and spacyous, and shadowed thick with trees:
here his conducter left him all alone, and accordingly as Valeria had
commanded him presently in like manner to fetch Antipholus: Aristo now being
alone by himself and there with all utterly disfurnished of weapon, the which
he purposedly had left behind him, and thinking now to find an end of all
his misfortunes, he entered into these speches. O Moderna, behold thy
sorrowful Brusanus, who disdaining here his loathsome life, hastes on his
fatal hour to vewe thy heavenly face: and if any auncieut love be left to
consider of thy unfortunate friend, accept of his oblation who offers for his
miss no less then the price of his (...): behold I say his grieffes, who se
daily tears are witnesses of his woes: and although til this time I have
prolonged my loathed life, yet in my thoughts, I every day have dyed* but
since the destimes have now agreed to free me from fortunes further despite,
and that my happy hour is thus concluded by the sates, grant me now that my
deceased ghost may have access unto thy heavenly presence, and that my
sorrowing soul may for ever attend thee in the Elisian fields: By this time
Antipholus was come into the garden and walking by himself alone to find out
he wiste not whom, he espied Brusanus, and being as quickly enraged with (...)
as he did as suddenly know him, he hastily drew out his sword, and running
toward him, he said: Traitor and villain that thou art, could thy love
toward my sister make thee disloyal toward her father, iniurous to me her
brother, and both false and faithless to thy dear friend Dorestus, or
could thou immagine thy villainy would escape unpunished, or did thou
think the whole circuit of the earth could have harbored thee in safety: but
tell me speedely what have thou done with my sister, or where have thou left
her, Brusanus answered thus: Where thou tearmest me to be a traitor or a
villain, thou know thou do me wrong, touching my misdemeanure toward
thy father, thy self, or my friend, I will not seek to excuse, for that I
should not dissuade for the punishment wherewith thou threatenest me now in
such displeasure: Alas, it is the thing that I then least feared, or now
stand in doubt off, but where thou inquyrest what is become of thy sister,
that question is it that stingeth my very conscience, but know thou, she is
dead, and yet to excuse her death by love, were to excuse love of murder, but
if the loss of my own life might have renewed Moderna, mine own hands should
have hastened my death, your weapon should never hasarde it: if therefore my
blood may wash away the dishonor, spare it not, prosecute what thou have so
long time sought for, never take pity of him that takes none at all for
himself, for there was never life for better cause yet bestowed: Truly (quoth
Antipholus) thou do well to hate thy self for thou can not hate a more
cursed creature, but wretch thy Lady shall not long be cumbred with so vile a
soul: here withal he lift up his arm thinking to have sheathed his sword
in the body of Brusanus, who offered his naked breast to be pierced by his
threatening weapon, but Valeria that was come into the orchyard, and came
thither of purpose but to aquaint Antipholus with the party to whom both her
self and her mother had been so much beholding, and being at this instant
hard at the heels of Antipholus, hearing his last pronounced words, and
seeing the weapon manaced, against him that had so valiantly defended her, she
hastily caught hold on his arm, then falling down before him on her knees
she said: O Antipholus, by the honor of the noble name thou bear, by that
inuiolate magnanimity that is in thee, by that constante promise thou have
kept toward me, stay thy hand (I beseech thee from practicing so horrible
impiety, but if thy choler be such as thou will not desist, execute then thy
cruelty upon mine own person, who has vnwitingly betrayed this harmless
Gentleman, let me (I say) by whom the first error spronge, make this action
tragical by my proper fall, for God defend that Valetia should ever live that
day, to see his blood spilte, who has preserved me from so many periles:
Antipholus taking her up by the hand said, do you know Valeria for whom you
plead, this is Brusanus, the only man I hate, against whom I have protested
to be a mortal foe: and this (said Valiria) is Aristo, that very man who saved
me from rauishment, preserned me from being murdered, delivered my mother
from shameful death, all this he performed by his valor and prowes: but if
this be Brusanus as you say, could you glory in the fall of so noble a Prince,
O my Lord Antipholus consider from what occasion this deadly quarrel has his
limmites, he has stolen away your sister from your fathers court, was it
think you in contempt of your father, in dispight of your self, or for the
love of your sister, or could it be done without her own consent, if love
then were the mean to enforce this enterprise, how Injurious would you prove
to the diety of Cupide, hat would make love the original of such a deadlye
(...): but who is so fearful that love will not make to bold, who so
doubtful, that beauty will not make desperate, or what enterprise is there so
hard, that a man will not hasard to obtain his fair (...): I hope the effects
of love has some working in your self, and would you neglecte to attempt
whatsoever were behouefull to the attainment of your beloved: I say no more,
but if ever Valeria may move pity in your consideration, forget this conceived
grief, and esteem of the matter no other then it is: the object is love, and
what carpet knight ^^ towardly, that would not adventure for his Lady, or what
dame sodainty with dread, that would not hasarde her self, with the only
parragon of the world: Here she made a pause expecting what Antipholus would
answer but he that was both charmed with her words, and inchaunted with her
looks, could render no other replye, but breathing forth a pitious sighe
streined from the very bottom of his heart, he threw the sword out of his
hand, as a manifest witness of his relenting mind, which being perceived by
Brusanus, he said as follows. O cruel* fortune, that will grant me no
fortune, to be unfortunate, but I beseech thee Antipholus, show me pity, by
being pitilesse, and for so much as the Gods seem deaf, and not to hear, the
destinies dull and not to help me, lift up once again thy weapon to dispatch
me of life, that other wise will never be cased of grief, yield therefore the
unhappiest man that lives, the rest he seeks for, and live thou Valeria to
(...) thy constant friend Antipholus. Antipholus well noting she inward
perplexity of Brusanus, and being now moved with wonderful remorse, to se
his passionate demeanure, even at this instante his choler was converted to
compassion, his deadly hate, to intiere love, and the rather to show his
hearty affection, Embracing Brusanus in his arms he said. O Brusanus, it is
better to live with a small gaul of grief, then to dye exempted clean from
grace, better to prolong on a life led in misery, then to hasten on death
without hope of mercy, for in life we have time left us to speak of the
incombrances of fancy, but after death no possible means to redress
endless calamity, and although I know your own wisdom better able to direct
you, then my skill will aford me to instructs you, yet in token of an
everlasting amity to be had between us, I will yield you mine advise, the
which although it fit not your body, I doubt not but it shall profit your
mind: If then this distemprature that thus ouer-ruleth you, he ingendered by
evil humors, an apothicary drugge may help to amend all, but if (as I am most
persuaded) your own affections minister the matter of your malady, reason must
be the corofiue to eat out the corruption that has infected you: but is it
the loss of my sister (who as you tell me is dead) that has drawn you into
this desperate fit: O Brusanus, her death I must confess, is so displeasaunt
unto me that it is grievous to my very soul, but what should we sorrow for
that we are not able to remedy, for who can withstand what the destinies have
decred, when we are all borne subject both to nature, fortune, time and
occasion, since then in our creation we have brought with us this subjection to
worldly casualties* should we make that grievous to our selves which the
heavenly powers have ordained common to all: no, we must not grudge against the
providence of god, who orders casual things, necessaryly: there is nothimg
then otherwise happened to my sister, then has bin appointed by the powers of
heaven, and may it not be thought that by the just determination of the gods
she was sommoned to yield nature her due, being thought unworthy to live and
enjoy a prince of so excellent perfection and virtue: cast of then ( Brusanus)
these unacquainted sorrows, which as they are the slaves of imperfections, so
they be the disparagement of and honorable mind: the greatest conquerours be
they that can conquer themselves, and honor is soonest ministered to him which
can master his own affections: and behold Antipholus offers here to
Brusanus love, honor, friendship, and perpetual amity: Antipholus ending
here his discourse, was thus answered by Brusanus: I know not my Lord
Antipholus, how to render condign thanks for this unlooked for curtefie, and
although your learned persuasions be such as I am not able to contradict, yet
it is not possible by reason to redress that which no good counsel is able
to cure, for some inueterat euilles in our external parts* may well be
removed with medicine, but a sorrow being (...) in the heart, will hardly abide
the grappel of persuasion, and my sickness I must confess is a heart sore, the
salve of which since it is removed from my hope by froward fortune, I deem it
more fitter for me (passionate as I am) to die, then thus ouerburdened with
continual sorrow, my life should prove a living death, neither can I deny
but the loss of my Moderna is the original of my fit, (which you account
desperate) but indeed engendered by he vehemence of love, yea shall love, alone
not setteled on the usual pleasure of the flesh, but on the grounded unity of
the heart, whereby her soul was so firmly alied to mine, as no showers of
misfortune or breach of time can alter the quallity, the quantity whereof as it
could not be conceived on earth, so it takes his effect in heaven, the fates
have heresy me of this rest, and suffered my flower to be parched by
misfortune, and death has separated her soul from her body, and sent her to
that place of pleasure, sphere the shall receive a crown of immortal glory,
but the separation of her from me, the gods have made to this purpose, to make
me learn the mutability of this wretched life, and to consider of the eternity
and wonderful essence of the heavens, where they have placed my friend to this
end, that I with more desire behold the sky, that being ^^^^shed with the
majesty thereof, I might likewise become heavenly: and forget to be earthly,:
cease then I beseech you to strive against the stream, my sorrows are so
settled, as no persuasions will remove them, and in requital of your exceeding
courtesy Brusanus, voweth here to Antipholus love, reverence and honor, and
so long as it shall please the gods to continue this wretched life, I will not
forget to pray to the heavens to send you that contentment, which I know you
have wished to me, Antipholus and Valeria both seeing his resolution, would not
for the present appose him with further speeches, yet hoping in the end to
alter his determination, they enticed him into the house, where a most
sumptious lodging was purposly prepared for him and many pleasant conceits
by sundry means practiced to have moved him to mirth, but nothing could be
devised that might beguill his pensive thoughts, and within very short space
he grew to be sick and kept his bed, you may well think he wanted no
attendaunce both from Valeria and the queen her mother, but Antipholus could
not help him, we will therefore a little while leave him to the mercy of his
fit.

The tenth Chapter.
Antipholus pronounces sentence of death against Calynda, she is discovered to
be his sister Moderna, she is brought to comfort Brusanus in his sickness

ANtipholus in this mean season being at some leisure, would needs see
justice duly executed against those that had bin practisers with the duke,
both against the princess and her mother, and to this end, did sit himself in
person with the criminal judges, (accompanied with other noble men) at an open
sessions, where Lucius and Vago were both condemned to the gallows: Calynda in
like manner was there to be tried, and was charged with conspiracy against the
queen Eriphila, who seeing her brother sitting upon the bench, to whom she
was very loath to be known, and being in her own conceit void of all hope for
ever to hear of Brusanus, did therefore think it better for her to dye, then
longer to live so much surcharged with sorrow: she therefore confessed the
indictment, and pronounced her self guilty to as many articles as were opposed
against her: upon her own confession Antipholus gave sentence that the next
day she should be burned in the same place, and with that fuel which had
bin before prepared for the queen: The sessions being broken up, Antipholus
finding his Lady and her mother together in company, he discoured unto them how
he had disposed Lucius and Vago: relating further how frankly Calynda
confessed her conspiracies, and what was likewise determined against her: but
the queen whose mind had bin hitherto carried away with her own misfortunes,
that the remembrance of Calynda was utterly out of her thought, and calling
now to mind that by her only mean, she had gathered so much light, as
contained no less then the safety of her own life: she began here to
consider with her self that Calynda could not possibly be culpable in any il
meaning toward her: she therefore requested Antipholus that she, might be
sent for, and that her self might speak with her ^^^^ing him further that
what so ever Calynda hade confessed against her self: did rather proceed from
some inward torment that afflicted her own mind, then of any ill pretense she
could have toward her, she having had such former experience of her fidelity
and love: Antipholus answered, that besides her own confession, Lucius had
avowched the whole matter against her, him self giving a whole nights
attendaunce on the duke, while he was with Calynda in her own chamber, where
after he had taken the fruits of his lewd desires, even then he made her privy
to the rest of his practices, when she gave her consent to assist him in his
enterprises, hoping after ward he would have married her, accordingly as he
then made promise unto her: the queen Eriphila, requested of Antipholus, that
Lucius might yet be further examined, what time it might be that this meeting
was appointed, and the very night of this confederacy: which being accordingly
performed, he according to the truth confessed it to be, that very same night
before when ye duke on the morning had appointed his hunting in the forest:
the queen finding his rekoning to fall out just with her own computation, to
disburden Antipholus from further misedoubting, she discoursed unto him, her
own practice with Calynda, and how with much ado and great persuasion, she
had won her to appoint the duke that nights entertainment in her own chamber,
who had many times before solicited her with loving protestation: neither
could she deny, nor think it any shame to confess, but that at that instant
she supplied the place of Calynda, and in a happy time (as she thought it) that
was so much for her own good, for the duke immagining (...) that he had
embraced his desired Calynda, unfolded unto her the sum of all his pretended
treasons where the (...) to provide for her better safety, she seemed to
consent to her own destruction, and therefore to conclude, she thought her
self especially beholding to Calynda, by whose means she came to knowledge of
the mischief that was intended against her by the duke her husband, which
otherwise might have lighted upon her by poisoning, murdering, or some other
like violent death, that might have bin privily practiced: here Antipholus
(little weaning how near Calynda was to himself) examined further what she
was, where she was borne, or of what perentage she was descended: Eriphila
made answer, that she was a stranger, and not otherwise known unto her then
by her own report, whom she first found in the desert grievously wounded,
and lyeng as a dead carcass upon the ground, and how by her means she was
both revived, and likewise cured, since which time she had remained attendant
upon her, still governing her self both wisely and virtuously in all her
demeanures, only she perceived her to be continually perplexed with some
colorous passion that troubled her mind, but what the occasion might be she
could not learn, neither could she imagine but this was the cause that she had
so untruly accused her self, as being weary of her own life: Antipholus, who
not above two days before, had received from Brusanus, the very manner of his
sisters misfortune, conceiues by all conjectures that this should be Moderna,
and being tickled with this hope, he sent immediately to have her brought
before him, intending at her coming to take a better survey of her, then
before he had done when she was araigned, the messenger found Calynda at her
private meditation, setteling her self the next day to dye, confirmed in
opinion, that nothing could better betide her then death, that should yield a
truce to all her conceived sorrows, was loath therefore to make any more
iourneyes til the next day that she hoped to end al her trauailles, but there
was no other remedy, which being by her perceived, she went along with her
conductors, who brought her where Antipholus was abiding her coming,
accompanied with his lady and her mother, and although Calinda had done so much
as in her lay to disguise her self, and had so shadowed her face that it
might not well be discerned, yet Antipholus at her first coming took so
narrow a view, that he immediately knew her, and being replenished with
unspeakable Joy (which for a little he dissembled) he said to the Queen:
Madame, is this ye same Calinda, that you have told me off, who has been so
much beholding unto you, as the saving of her own life, does consist: My lord
Antipholus (answered the Queen) this is that very same Calinda, whose life
(by straung adventures) I saved in the forest where she was left for dead, and
whose fortune has sense requited me with the very like curtisie, so that she
has well discharged that debt: here the Queen directing her speeches to
Calinda, gave her very gracious and comfortable words, demanding of her what
might be the occasion that she had so slaundered her self, to work her own
confusion, but Calinda whose greatest care was to keep her self vnkowen to
her brother, stood still without making answer: Antipholus, who was not
longer able to hide his own affections, letting fall abundance of tears, and
embracing Calinda in his arms, he said unto her: O Moderna do thou disdain
to acknowledge me for thy brother, that have ever loved thee as tenderly as the
balls of mine own eyes, and have accounted the no less dear unto me, then
the very heart that is within my body: and could thou so dissemble thy name,
disguise thy parson, and belie thy self, that I should give censure of her
death, that would have proved a more terrible sting to mine own conscience,
then all the torments, that hell it self is able to aford: Moderna finding
herself to be discryed, and hearing the loving words of her brother, whom
she rather thought would have punished, then pitied her, answered thus: My
most dear and loving brother, I cannot deny but that your love has been no
less tender unto me then here you have reported, neither could you better
show it, nor your self use a more kind or brotherly part, then to pronounce
sentence of death against her, whose life is both loathsome, and hateful to
her self: having lost the very anker-holde of all my happiness, the only
castle of my comfort, my friend and lover Brusanus: whom I assure my self to
have shortened his own life only for my cause, whose presence sense I could
not enjoy here on earth, my very soul mourns til it be disseuered from this
earthly substance, that I might accompany my Brusanus in the heavens: neither
shall be want my prayers, nor I omit to make daily sacrifice with my tears,
till the destinies have dated out that blessed hours, whereof I now find my
self prevented by iniust fortune: Valeria and Eriphila standing by, and
gathering by former circumstances, that Calinda was now become Moderna, and
sister to Antipholus: noting likewise the wonderful vehemencye of her
affections, toward Brusanus, and knowing again in him the very like toward
her, were both moved with exceeding compassion, and filled with incredible
Joy: and after they had both of them saluted her with as great signs of good
will, as it was possible for them, by out-warde shows to express: Antipholus
that was alike Joyful, as well that he had gotten a medicine for the malady ye
vexed Brusanus, as a salve for his sisters sore, thought it not good therefore
to neglecte longer time till he had ministered relief to both their deseases:
but taking his sister by the hand, and being accompanied with Valeria and
Eriphila, he brought her up into the chamber, where Brusanus was lyeng in his
bed, rather attending the hour which the fatal sisters should apointe, then
aspecting so good hap as succeedingly followed, and sitting himself down
upon his beds side, he said.

The eleventh Chapter.
The comfortable meting between Brusanus and Moderna, their marriage day is
appointed, the nuptiales likewise of Antipholus and Valeria performed together
on a day.

IS it possible ( Brusauns) that a Prince of such virtue, should so surrender
himself to his own misconceiued opinnions, as not to be able to brook any
reason: you say you loved my sister, if it be so, let your liking now be
showen in loving her still that languisheth for you, comfort her with gladness,
in seeing you recover your wonted health, that may kill her with sorrow, in
beholding you to be thus distempered with grief: behold ( Brusanus) who
presents her self to your compassion, my sister Moderna supposed to be
dead, but yet reserved by the heavens, either to be made happy in your safe
recovery, or other-wise thus passionating your self, to remain for (...)
unfortunate. Brusanus amassed with this heavenly sounds, hearing Moderna named
to be (...), immagined himself to be in a dream, and listing up his eyes,
he looked full in the face of Moderna, that was placed by her brother fast by his
beds side, and knowing it undoubtedly to be the true picture of his Lady, lay
still gasing upon her as a man that had been in some trance: Moderna again
hearing the name of Brusanus, and casting her eyes upon him where he lay in
his bed, knowing him immediately to be her desired friend, the sight whereof did
so ravish her with joy, that she was likewise stricken mute, not able to give a
word: the one of them thus greedely fixing their eyes upon the other seemed
both as a cupple of dumb Images: but Antipholus desirous to shake them out of
these drouste immaginations, began in this manner to cheer up Brusanus: Why
how now Brusanus, what are you inuocating to the Gods, or blessing your self
from devils, fearing I have presented you with some transformed spirit, doubt
nothing man, but take her by the hand, and tell me then if she be not made of
flesh and bone: Autipholus there taking his sister by the arm he delivered her
to Brusanus, who no sooner laid hand of her but his spirits began to revive:
and rolling himself upon his pillowe, he burst out into these words. O happy
day, yea ten times blessed be the hour, when I live to se this comfortable
sight: Moderna embracing him fast in her arms, mutually mixing their joyful
tears with loving kisses. Of which pleasant passions, were also glad copartners,
both Antipholus himself, and in like manner the young Princess, with her
mother: but after the vehemence of their affections, had a little given scope
to the rest of their senses, and that their tongues were set at liberty: O how
many sweet honey words were shuffeled out between them (but especially by
Moderna) so dangerous to be spoken off, as I dare not set them hete down,
fearing I should infecte women with too much kindness, that are of themselves,
so naturally inclined to pity: I will therefore pass them over with silence,
let this suffyce: Brusanus within three days was perfectly recovered, so much
to the contentation of Antipholus, that all things were in common between
them, the like was between Valeria and Moderna: and after they had a while
pleasantly discoursed of every accident how it fall out and happened amongst
them: they concluded their nuptiales, which they appointed to be celebrated
both in one day, for the solemnis^^^^ whereof great preperation was ordained,
as well for Antipholus and Valeria, as for Brusanus and Moderna, where I think
it best for a season to leave them in this contented happiness, being other-wise
called to prosecute a further occasion, and thou careful Clio, that have
hitherto guided my muse, to figure forth dolorous discourses, and to blason out
such sorrowful adventures, assist me yet to display matters of like mishappe
and of more accidental calamity: and helps me thou Bellona to ringe the Larum
bell, that must now direct my pen to wright of wars, and to blase the
bloody broils of Mars, who was now perdominaunte in the midell heavens, whose
influence prefigured these insuinge troubles.

The twelfth Chapter.
Astulpho acompanied with Dorestus, leading a great army between them, are
aryued upon the confines of Hungaria, Myletto sends for assystance to
Caristo, Prince of Piamount.

IT has been before mentioned, that upon the flight of Brusanus and Moderna,
from the Illerian court, it was determined by Astulpho, immediatlye to
commence wars against Myletto King of Hungaria, in revenge of his sons
abuse, and that his own son Antipholus should follow the quest of Brusanus
into Grecia, whose success you have now hard, Astul, ho accordingly levied a
huge and puissaunt army, and being acompanied with Dorestus with 10000.
Epirotes in his assistaunce, they marched in brave and warre-like manner,
toward the confines of Hungaria. The Hungarians, that had long inioyed the
benifit of sweet and quiet peace, were very much amassed to hear this sudden
Allarum of war, but as no man can perfectly know ye blessedness of peace, that
has had no trial of the burden of war, see a long peace brings with it
many discommodities, making men insolent commonly through to great prosperity,
as also nice, lavish, and effeminate, through abundance of wealth and idleness,
and without all doubt, they that are to much affected to peace and quietness,
do weaken themselves by little and little before they be aware: and their
example does likewise molifie the courage of youth, whereby they lie open to
the injuries of those that will seek to invade them: For this cause says
Philopamenus, in the time of peace, we must practice our selves to be more
skilful in war, and must likewise enter into where, but to ye end to establish
peace, but ye Hungarians neglecting this principle, bound themselves prentises,
so much to this peaceable desire, that they had both forgotten their martial
disciplines and utterly shaken of their militarynes, but common necessity
enforced them to arms, the enemy as they hard was marching, and they had no
respite now to forethinke them what should have bin done, but speedily to
determine what must be done, they presently therefore fell to mustering
throughout their whole provinces, and in every corner of the kingdom of
Hungaria, great multitudes of men were provided and armed, captains, and
leaders were appointed, such as had never seen ensign displaied in the
field, unless perhaps at the fetching home of a may pole: some that were
lately come from the court and had carried pantoffelles, some as newly come
from schole, and had read Vigesius: some old soldiers that had bin trained in
a noble man's chamber, some that was able to marciall whole millions with their
pen, yet knew not how to charg their pike: some that would have over thrown
an army with their tongues, yet knew not how to set an hundred in good order
of ray: some rash, same hairebraind, some wilful, some foolish hardy, most
unskillful, all appointed by favor, none by desert: by this time word was
brought to Miletto, that a Herald of arms was com from the king of Illeria
with some message, and the king desirous to hear his news, willed him
forthwith to be brought in, the Herald without any salutation at all, told the
king that he was a messenger of very ill news, for in respect of the villainy
offered by his son Brusanus to the king his (...), by stealing away his
daughter, he was therefore in the name of Astulpho to ^^ him open defiaunce,
willing him forthwith to aunswers whether he would abide the hasard of war,
or other wise to surrender to such conditions of peace, as the king his master
should afterward by an ambassador prescribe unto him, the king willed the
Herald to be well entertained for that night, the next morning he would return
him with answer to his master, the king of Hungaria, now vnderstandeing the
quarrel to proceed by the lewd demeanuce of his son, thinking him still to
continue his lacsiuious manner of life (began utterly to despair of his
amendment) conferred with his nobility of his intent which was, to disinherit
his vicious son Brusanus from the succession of the kingdoome, and to leave
it the inheritance of his virtuous daughter Leonida, and for that Caristo the
prince of Piemount had lately requested his daughter in marriage, he could not
better bethink him, then with all expedition to send a messenger unto him, to
pray his assistaunce with twenty thousand soldiers against his enemy the
king of Illeria now in arms against him, and the wars being once ended,
then to bestow his daughter upon him in marriage, and her dowry to assure him
(after his own dissease) the kingdom of Hungaria, which offer he knew would
well content the prince: the whole assembly marueilously well allowed of the
kings determination, knowing the prince to be a most magnificent gentleman,
endued with wonderful courage and virtue, to the end therefore that no delay
might be used, they gave their speedy consentes, beseeching the king in all
possible have, to send away a messenger to that purpose, which was accordingly
performed. Miletto minding so much as he might to dally with the king of
Illeria, to the end to win time, hoping shortly to be assisted by Caristo, the
next day calling the Herald sent from Astulpho he willed him to tell his
master for answer, that although he feared not his forces being able every
way to with-stand it, yet the care he had of his subjects safety, and the
love ye he had to preserve the lives of his, commons had such remorse in him,
tha^ he rather desired to continue them still in peace (if it might be had with
any reasonable conditions) then to put his hope in the (...) of fortune, when he
desired nothing less then to maintain the quarrel of his (...), unless it
had fallen out in an honestes cause: the Herald hearing this answer, cr^^ed a
safe (...) for an Ambasadore, that should be sent from the king his master,
which was immediately delivered unto him under the kings signet

The thirtenth Chapter.
Dorestus is sent to parle with Milletto, he falls in love with Leonida,
Caristo is arrived with twenty thousand Piemountes, Dorestus is sent back with
a cold comfort.

THis messenger returning to Astulpho with this answer, Dorestus was the man
that was appointed for this imbassage, the conditions that were delivered him
from Astulpho to agree upon, were short and sweet: the first was that Miletto
the king of Hungaria should acknowledge himself a vassaill to Astulpho, and to
hold his kingdom during his own life from him, paying a yearly tribute of
six hundred thousand duccates: the second was, that after his own discease,
it should be established by the whole estate, that the kingdom of Hungaria
should remain to the kings of Illeria, and to their successors for ever: the
third and last was, that he should deliner into the hands of Astulpho, six of
his principal noblemen, which should remain as pledges, for the performance
of the premises: provided always, that if Miletto could within one year
deliver his son Brusanus, either alive or dead to Astulpho, that then the
yearly tribute of six hundred thousand duccates should cease, but the rest to
be performed as in manner before said: these were the demaundes of Astulpho,
given in commission to Dorestus, and upon these conditions either to conclude
peace, or present war: Dorestus being thus dispatched from Astulpho, and
being accompanied with a train of brave gentlemen, departed on his journey
toward the city of Larissa, where Miletto held his court, and being there
(...), the king was certified of his coming, who being in his (...) of
presence, caused the Ambassador presently to be sent for, and so much the
rather knowing him to be Dorestus, the young prince of Epirus, so much famed
for his many perfections, who courtiously doing obeisance to ye king, breefely
delivered his embassage: Miletto hearing these proud demaundes, devised so much
as he could to delay the time (hoping very speedily to be assisted by
Caristo) answered that he could not on a sudaine dispatch so weighty a matter,
but he must first take the advice both of his counsel, and the rest of his
nobility, which done, within few days he would return him answer, in the
mean time, he appointed that Dorestus with his train, should be sumptuously
feasted: while they were thus enter tained in the court, accompanied with the
gallantes, and lusty courtiers, that peerless parragon Leonida, daughter to
the king, attended on by a troop of brave ladies and gentlewemen, passed
through the chamber of presence, and was espied by Dorestus, who sudainely
fixing his eyes on this sweet aspect, was so rapt into a trance with the
contemplation of her beauty, that his heart was so snared in the beams of her
pleasant glaunces, that there was no remedy, he must yield to this first
assault of fancy, but here it were straung to be told how many contrary
incounters, tossed in his mind, sometimes thinking to prefer his suit, yet
that he thought was follye, being the daughter of his professed foe, neither
would time suffer him to prosecute his purpose, nor present (...) him to make
trial of his love, and yet to linger still in that estate, he thought was to
much miserye, then he called to his (...) how Moderna had despised him, and
here he began with disdainefull immaginations to condemn (...) of
instability, of inconstanty, of lightness, of intertainly, and to accuse them as
creatures that were vowed to all manner of vanity: our gentleman thus tossed
with the tempests of these contrary cogitations (as the vessel that is borne
with the tide against the wind feels double force, and is compelled to yield
to wind and wave) so Dorestus, the more he sought to quench his love by
disdain, the greater increased the same of his desire, that faineting under
the force of his inward torments, he withdrewe himself into his chamber,
where shutting fast the door, he began in this wise to discourse with him
self: Ah Dorestus, thou came hither a captain, and will thou now return a
captive, thy intent was to conquer, not to be vanquished, to fight with a
lance, not to be foild with love, but how do thou think to subdue
Hungaria, that can not vanquish thine own affections, art thou able to
quaill a kingdom, that can not quaill thy foolish apetites, no, it will be
hard for thee to triumph over others, that art not able to master thy self,
yield not then to this fresh alarume of love, be not dasled with the beams of
vading beauty, nor inamored with desire of every dilicate damsel, for in time
such bliss will turn to bale, and such delightful joy, to more dispitfull
annoy, love Dorestus will prove an enemy to thine honor, a foe to thy person,
a canker to thy mind, a corosiue to thy conscience, a weakner to thye wit, a
mollester of thye mind, a besotter of thy senses, and finally a deadly poison
to all thy body: why have thou not had some trial, has not Moderna taught
thee what fruits are to be found in love, I hope thou have not yet forgot what
thou foundest by experience, but peace Dorestus do thou speak of love, or art
thou in a dream, why whom do thou love, is it Leonida: what the daughter of
thy possessed foe, one that wishes thy mishap, and partly prays to the gods
for thy misfortune, no sure, I thinks thou art not so fond, she is not thy
friend whom thou may hope to get: but thine enemy whom thou art not sure to
gain, nor never think she will requit thy merit with ^eed, or repay thy love
with liking, ono, she hates thee Dorestus as a vowed enemy to her fathyr, and
thy coming hither is to part of peace, take then a truce with thine own
affections, and end those wars which fancy has begun, in thy self: but
alas beauty has runge the larum, and love is the chieftaine and leader of the
band, who has already subdued my senses, and taken prisoners, all my
affections: and although wit would gladly fight it out, yet will, who should
take in hand the charge, has surrendered himself, and is already yielded, and
reason not able to abide the assault, is likewise driven to fly the field: Alas
Dorestus, what victory can thou hope for, more then to plead for pity, and
to seek mercy at her hands, that may yet have compassion and save thy life:
Dorestus without any further speeches determined resolutly to try his fortune,
and watching his best opportunity to bewray his liking to Leonida, he found out
her haunt where she privately walked every day in the after none in a pleasant
gardin fast adjoining to her own lodgnig, whether he secretly conveyed
himself, and being shrouded amongst the pleasant laurelles, Leonida
according to her custom pacing up the allie softely by her self, was
incountered by Dorestus, and humbly saluted her: Leonida something amassed with
this sudaine approach knowing him to be a stranger, demanded how he came
thither, Dorestus answered, by chance he happened into the place having lost
his way, so do many (quoth Leonida) that seek unknown ways, and likewise
follow their own ways, but what has brought you hither, or who has bin
your guide, my desire (answered Dorestus) to see and withal to be satisfied,
no worse guide under the sun (said Leonida) have you not seen desire
pictured both blind and flyeng, as well to show his error as his have,
besides unbridled to show his rashness, and how hardly he can be stayed:
Dorestus finding himself thus pritiely niped, was in a quandare how he might
prosecute his undertaken attempt, yet in the end he gave the onset in this
manner: the choice is hard lady Leonida, where party is compelled, either by
silence to dye with grief, or by unfolding his mind to live with shame, yet
so sweet is the desire of life, and so sour the passions of love, that I am
enforced to prefer an unseemly suit, before an untimely death, loath I am to
speak, and in despair I am to speed, in the one showing my self a coward, in
the other weieng mine own case, for considering what love is I faint: and
thinking how I am counted a foe, I fear: and so it is, that intending to be a
victor, I am become a vassal: coming to conquer, I am vanquished, seeking to
have brought others into thrall: I have lost mine own liberty, I came to your
fathers court a captain, but am like to return a captive, my charge was to
parle of peace, but my chance is to discourse of passion, your beauty madame
(ah) your heavenly beauty, has brought me into this bondage, your exquisit
perfection has snared my freedom: your courtesy only may free me from care,
or your cruelty cross me with endless calamity.

Leonida, that had all this while listened to his tale, was so inflamed with a
melancholy kind of heat, as she was not of a long time able to utter a word,
yet at the last, as it were in a fury she delivered this answer: Why
Dorestus (quoth she) art thou become frantique, or deemest thou me to be out of
my wits, if thy speeches bein jest, they are to broad weieng the case, if in
earnest, they are to bad, considering the party, to dally with Venus, that art
vowed to Mars, argues theee to be either a coward or a counterfeit, to make
show of love, that arrived here in hate, shows thee to be infected with
frenzy or folly, but it is a blind goose that loves to hear the fox preach,
and she a loving fool that stoupes to her enemies lure, and therefore if I
should love, what must it be Dorestus, my fathers foe, the bloody wretch that
seeks his life, the cursed enemy to my cuntry, no no, he cannot favor the
stem, that would cut down the old stock, he little respects the twig,
that tendereth not the root: he lightly loves the child, that deadly hates
the father: I may not therefore so far forget mine honor, mine honesty, my
parents, and my cuntrie, as to love, nay not deadly to hate him, which is a
foe to the least of these: cease then to seek for love where thou shall find
nothing but hate, and assure thy self if thou did love as faithfully as thou
do flatter falsely, yet would I never believe thee, requite thee, or any
ways pity thee.

Alas madame (answered Dorestus) way my case with equity, if you hate me as I
am a foe to Miletto, yet favor me as I am a friend to Leonida: if you loath me
as an enemy to your cuntry, yet pity me as I am a captive to your beauty:
Tarpeia favored Titus though a foe in Rome, Scilla respected Minos. yet he
beseaged Nisus: Tereus the prince of Thrace being sent by his father to defye
Pandyon, the king of Athens, was inamoured of his daughter Progne, whereby in
steed of fatal enmity, there insued friendly amity: O what greater sign of
affection, then where in liewe of hate, there insueth love, it is to be
immagined, either a thing confirmed by the fates, or appointed by the gods,
then where I have done amise, I will not fail to make amends, if I have
committed a fault, I am ready to render recompense: and as I have bin your
fathers foe, no we will I be his faithful friend, if I have sought his di,
squiet, I will procure his rest, yea I will go against the hair in all
things, so I may please Leonida in any thing: Leonida breefely replied:
Dorestus, your sudaine liking bewrayes the lightness of your love: and this your
fond affection importes the ficklenes of your fancy, may he be counted a
privy friend, that shows himself an open foe, for your examples, they be
necessary caueates for ladies to be warned by: for if Progne loved her fathers
foe, how wretchedly did Tereus requit her loyalty, for the other two: their
gains were perpetual shame and endless discredit, for the one was slain by
the Sabines, the other likewise rejected by Minos: and therefore sir to
conclude, you cannot more displease me, then in seeking to please me, and as
for my father be his friend, or his foe, it is in your own choice: but for me,
if I know no other cause to hate thee, this shall suffice, I will never love
thee, and without any more speeches, away she flung in a great chafe, leaving
Dorestus, alone by himself, who leaving likewise the place came into his
chamber, where a little to ease his stomach, he brake into these speeches: Of
all evil which either god or nature has laid upon man, there is none so
great but either reason may redress, pleasure assuage, mirth mittigate,
herbs heal, or by some means or other may be cured, love only excepted,
whose force is so full of rancour, that physic can in no respect prevail to
help the patient, diseruing not the name of a disease, but rather the title of
an incurable mischief: yet importing such a show of contentation, that it so
inflameth our desires to purchase it, that we care not at what unreasonable
rate we buy it: if it be then so strong, why is it not more steadfast, if it be
so forceible, why is it not fixed, perhaps so it is in all saving in me, I am ye
odd person on whom Cupide will show his cunninge, I am he that must chope and
change and live by the loss: first forsaken by Moderna, now despised by
Leonida: how art thou then perplexed Dorestus, thou love without hope, and
therefore live in ill hap, thou hournest in desire, but thou art couled with
disdain, and her father is thy foe, but if he were thy friend, does not
Leonida despise thee, has not she denied thy suit, disdayned thy person,
lightly respecting thy love and as smally regarding thy service: only
promissing this, while she lives to be thy protested foe: And what then fond
fool, will thou shrink for an april shower, know thou not that a denial
at the first is a grant: and a gentle answer, a flattering flowt, the more
they seem at the first to loath: the more we find at the last they love, hope
then the best Dorestus, for love and fortune cares not for cowardes. By this
time tidinges were brought to the court, that Caristo Prince of Pyemounte was
within three days iourny, with a strong army of 20000. Pyemounts, and that
the Prince himself would not fail the very next day to be at the court, as
well to salute the King and the Queen, as to see his dearly beloved mistres
Leonida, for whose sake he had undertaken that service: Great joy was made
through the court, at these happy tidinges, and no less preperation was made
for the receiving of the Prince: This was a cold comfort for Dorestus, who no
sooner understood of the news, but he could easily pronosticate of his own
success, but when he had certainly learned that Leonida was disposed by her
father to Caristo, and how upon that occasion the Prince had undertaken arms:
O how were his cares then increased, his spirits were troubled with millions
of immaginations, sorrow had sealed on all his parts, and setteled himself
in the very bottom of his heart, dollor, grief, care, anguish, despair,
languor, with all their accomplices, had dispersed themselves through all his
powers, and taken the full possession of him, as their own proper right: But
Myletto, who had lingered this time, but of purpose to hear from Caristo, and
his drift being now dated out to his own desire, the next day he sent for
Dorestus, to whom he delivered these words: Prince Dorestus, I have thoroughly
considered of the proud demands sent unto me from Astulpho, and wondering at
his presumption, what should move him to send me any such greeting, as though
I were not able to maintain mine own right, that am an absolute King as
himself, and every way his equal, and as for my crown and kingdom of
Hungaria, as I have hitherto kept them in dispight of any enemy, so I doubt
not but to continue them during mine own life, and after my decease, to leave
the succession to such heirs as shall be as likely to in counter him and his
successors in Illeria, as for him or any of them by any means to oppress
Hungaria, for answer therefore take this, that by the assistaunce of God,
within ten days, I will meet him in the plain field, and will give him
battaill, where I doubt not but to chase him from out my borders, to his great
shame and infamy: This is the answer ( Derestus) that I have determined on,
and now at your pleasure you may depart in safety, having (according to the
laws of arms) a safe condite for your protection.

The king without any further words left Dorestus, who finding himself to
be thus continually crossed, was at his wits end what course he might take, but
calling to his mind how that was no place for him to abide longer in,
accompanied therefore with his train he departed, but so ouer-growne with
grief, that he passed no hour, minit, nor moment, without woeful warlinges,
sorrowful sobs, and sighs bitterly breathed out, in so much that the
Gentlemen his companions surmised his perplexity to proceed of fear, hearing
of the puisaunte army conducted by Caristo: they began therefore both to
comfort and to encourage him, and although their persuasions served to little
purpose for the curing of his care, yet seeinge that his sorrow would not
salve his sore, but rather increase his sickness, and that mourning would rather
augment his misery, then mitigate his malady, he bare out the matter with as
good countinance as his passion would permit, and coming to the camp, he
declared his message to Astulpho, accordingly as Myletto had before delivered.

The fourteenth Chapter.
Myletto joining his army with Caristo, does march toward Astulpho, they
encounter in fight, how Dorestus behaueth himself, Caristo is slain by
Dorestus, Myletto is put to a retreat, and driven to save himself by flight.

AStulpho, waxing mad with ire, marched presentlye into the borders of
Hungaria, burning, spoiling, killing, and ransaking all that ever came in his
way: These lamentable occurrentes coming hourly to the ears of Myletto, of
the spoiling of his subjects, it caused him to make the more have, and
concluded with Caristo, promising (by the sacred oath of a King) both to give
him his daughter in marriage, and the kingdom of Hungaria, for his
inheritance, and thus joining their forces together, they marched toward
Astulpho, who was still wasting of the country, both by fire and sword; and
being come within a small distaunce where Astulpho lay encamped, they likewise
entrenched themselves for that night. Word was immediately brought to Astulpho,
of their ariuall, and how the next day they determined to give him bettaill,
these news were joyful to the Captains and lusty gallantes, for every man
hoping to win fame, were generally merry through the whole camp: Dorestus
only excepted, who being tormented with unspeakable grief, began to droupe,
making no show but of sorrow, in so much that he was generallye suspected to
be a fearful cowarde, and that dread of danger was it that drove him into
those dumpes, but as they rashly coniectured cause of his sorrow, so they mist
the nature of his sickness.

The next day very early in the morning every man fell to his arms through
both the armies, and Astulpho who knew very well how to demean himself in
such causes ranged out his squadrons, and martialled them into one strong and
maine battaill: Caristo in like manner, nothing inferior neither in skill nor
courage, drew out his own forces of his Piamounts, into a squadron by
themselves, whereof himself took the conducte, and minded to give the first
charge, the Hungarians were likewise ordered in a second battaill, in the very
strength and body whereof Myletto had his place, and was appointed still to
second, succoure, and relieve Caristo in all occasions of extremity.

Dorestus knew not all this while where on to resolve, for if he refused to
fight (besides the dishonor that the world would allow him, of which he made
the least account) yet he knew if Myletto prevailed, that he had then
bequethed his daughter Leonida to Caristo: again to enter the field, he
should show himself a foe so open and aparant, as there were no means left
whereby to frame excuse: While Dorestus continued in these meditations, the
battails fell to marching, and Caristo (as he had determined) charged the
Illerians with such courage and fury, that even in this first encounter they
began to recoile, but many were slain on both parties, neither was there
wanting skill and hardines, and their fight continued thus a pretty season
between them, but in the end Caristo prevailed, and the Illerians were put to
a plain retreat, and began some of them to fly: Dorestus seeing it hie time to
bestyrre him now or never, was driven out of his dumpes for his own safety,
issued forth with his Epirots, and charging Caristo on the flock of his
battaill, ouer-threwe at the very first a great number of Piemountes, the
fight here again began to hold on a fresh, but Dorestus having received a
maime incurable, not by any stroke lent him of an enemy, but by the only
conceit of his mind, for he espied in the helmet of Caristo, a glove, which
he immagined, was given him by Leonida, and so in truth it was, wherefore
pressing through the thronge, making way with his sword, he came to Caristo,
drawing him for the love of his Lady, to with-drawe himself, and to break a
lance, Caristo (whose courage was inferior to none) without any further
speeches put the spurs to his horse, and galloping out of the thronge into
the uttermost winge of the battaill, as he turned himself, he might see
Dorestus, who had likewise followed him, and had taken a part of the field
ready to encounter him, without any more a do, they run one against the
other with such fury that they made the earth to tremble, their spears flew al
to sheuers in the air, it was not long before they had drawn their swords,
then buckling together with forcible blows, as either of them showed enough of
courage, so neither of them were to seek of cunning, in brief, after many
breathinges, Caristo disaduantaging himself by his own fierce and desperate
fight received such a wound, that he fell stark dead to the earth: Dorestus
that saw him lyeng breathless began to let fall abundance of tears
delivering these words: O unhappy and unfortunate Prince, God knows how
sorrowful and grievous thy death is unto me, and how feign I would have given
remedy in some other manner, to that I most desired, neither would I have been
so cruall an enemy unto thee, but the love that I bare to Leonida, has rather
enforced it then mine own nature, and would to God I might have been
relieved by some other means, and not to have bought my life with thy loss:
but as love is tyranous, so marvel not though he want pity toward thee,
which could not other-wise purchase it to himself.

With this he alighted, and taking the glove from out the helmet of Caristo,
he mounted again on horsbacke, and bending toward the battaill, he might
see a wonderful slaughter of the Piemounts, but the Captains and leaders of
the Hungarians army, being men utterly ignorant of martial exercise, such as
for want of skill neither knew how to take opportunity, nor when it was time
to charge, letting slip all former occasions which might have advanced their
conquest, stood still in amaze till the Piemounts being utterly broken by the
Epirots, retired amongst them in whole troops for their own safe guard, and
the Captains unskillful how to open their ranckes to let them in, by means
whereof they disordered quite the whole battle of the Hungarians, and the
Epirots following the chase, began to bear down the Hungarians, in such sort
that they were not able to stand before them, the which being espied by
Dorestus, he presently caused the retreat to be sounded, and thus at an instant
drew back his whole troops.

This demeanure of Dorestus was noted by many, and as generally marvelled at by
all, but (indeed) they mistook him in something, for in truth they
understood him in nothing: But Astulpho, who by this time had raunged his
broken company again into a new order of array, and knew very well how to take
advantages, set a fresh upon the Hungarians, who being before disordered and
not able to maintain fight, fell to a retreat of flat running away, and the
King himself had much a do to escape, but the night growing on and waxing
very dark, the benifite whereof saved a great number of their lives.

The fifteenth Chapter.
Astulpho marches after Myletto, beseygeth him in the City of Larissa, and
by perjury surpriseth the City, and takes prisoners, Myletto the King,
Paulina the Queen, with Leonida their daughter.

AStulpho gathering his whole army together, rested himself for that night
within the trenches of his camp not suffering his men after so great a victory
to rest secure, but kept a stronger watch then before he had accustomed,
fearing that his enemies immagining him to rest careless in confidence of his
late fortune, might take courage to set upon him, but alas poor men they had
no such immagination, their greateste hope of safety was in trustinge to their
heels: Myletto being left now with a small number of his dispersed people, he
retired himself to his chief City Larissa, where he found his Queen, his
daughter, with the principales of the City, lamentinge the general
misfortune* and being assured that it would not be long before Astulpho would
beseege that City, it was therefore furnished with sufficient garrisons of
men, presentlye setting ingyners and laborers, to fortiffie the most weak and
decayed places: ceassing neither day nor night, to put al things in readiness,
as the little respite of time would afforde them.

Astulpho, who minded nothing less then to lose that advantage, wherewith
fortune had already favored him: having gotten intelligence by espiall, that
there were no forces of the enemy nere hand to anoy him, and having further
learned that Myletto was retired to Larissa, he marched thither with as much
speed as conveniently he might, wasting and spoiling the country as he passed,
acknowledging the honor of his last victory to belong to Dorestus, who little
rejoicing in his conquest, marched along with him, perplexed again with a new
tormente, not knowing how to salve the sore ye which he had already chafed:
for he thought with him self, that if he should make peace with Myletto,
letting him understand the love he bare to his daughter, that he would not
except of it, either for the great damage that he had already done him, or for
the band where with he was bound to Caristo the Prince of Piemount, thinking it
would be a thing neither reasonable, nor yet agreeing to his honor, in liew of
the Princes pains which he had taken to com from his country, accompanied
with so puissaunt an army in his defense, and in regard of the death which he
there received in his service, to become a friend to his foe, and to give his
daughter (before espoused to the Prince) unto the most deadly foe that the
Prince had.

These things (I say) did so trouble Dorestus, that though he every day coined
a new devise, yet knew not at night where on to resolve.

By this time they were come before the City, where ye Citizens issuing forth
with small companies exployted many services to their great commendations, but
their forces were to feeble, they were still ouer-matched with numbers, and were
therefore driven to retire into the City: Astulpho setteled himself before
the walls, and in short time so gyrdeled in the City with a trench, that
they could neither sally forth of the town, nor receive any new supplies,
that should come in their relief.

It were here tedious to let you understand, the several strategems practiced
by Astulpho, and still prevented, and the City defended in dispight of all
his enterprises: But Astulpho finding his devises to sort out to so little
purpose, brought a strong battery against the walls, which delivered such
continual and terrible vollies: that a maine breach was made assaultable, and
a great part of the wale besides so shaken, that it was ready to fall:
Astulpho caused the breach immediately to be fearcely assaulted, and it was by
the Cittiezens as brauelye defended, the assaylantes after great loss were put
to a retreat, and the defendantes with no less sorrow lamented their
misfortune, for a great number of their brauest men had lost their lives, in
the defense of the breach.

Astulpho seeing his forces daily to deminishe, and all his enterprises to be
continually prevented, fretted within him self with grief, and waxed almost
wood for anger: Myletto again, seeing the City so shaken, and their walls
so weakened, that they were not able to defend a second assault, was as much
surprised with fear, and taking the advice of his counsel, they cocluded to
send to Astulpho, to se if he might be brought to any reasonable conditions of
peace, which was accordingly performed: Astulpho, who cared not by what means
he obtained so he might win, and minding to keep promise in nothing, if he
could take advantage in any thing, thought that if under collor of Parle he
could draw the King from out the City, he would surely entrap him and hold
him prisoner, and the better therefore to accomplish this his devise, he
returned answer to Myletto, that he was contented to take a truce for ten
days, within which time if such co^dicions as he should prescribe might be
agreed unto, the peace then to hold for ever between them, or otherwise at his
perrill to abide the hasarde of war.

Myletto very joyful to hear of this ten days truce, hoping in the mean
time by some means to relieve himself, or at the least to reedifie his shaken
walls, that were every hour ready to fall, he confirmed the peace during the
foresaid time as well under his hand writing, as under his oath solemnly
given, requiring the like of Astulpho, who accordingly protested, both under
his hand and oath, to keep true peace for ten days: The truce thus agreed
upon, Astulpho premeditating what course he might follow for the
accomplishment of his intended purpose.

Myletto on the other side minding to take opportunity, the very next dayt
brought laborers to that part of the wall that had been before so shaken
with shot, and threw it flat to the ground, minding with as great expedicion,
again to build it up, and with curtins and trenches drawn before it, to make
the place more stronger then before times it had been.

Astulpho, seeing so great advantage offered, the very same night assaulted
the city, in the breach that by them selves was made, and they resting (as it
were) in security, of their truce before taken, were easiely surprised, a great
slaughter made of the citizens, some part of the town they fired, the rest
utterly spoiled, and the king himself with the queen his wife, and his
daughter Leonida taken prisoners, and brought to the pauilion of Astulpho,
where they were detained with a strong guard.

The sixteenth Chapter.
Dorestus visits Leonida, she charge him of perjury, he entreats
Astulpho to use lenity, but he protests greater cruelty.

DOrestus who before was privy to the peace, yet utterly ignorant of the
practice, hearing of these news, was utterly dismayed, to think that a king
should use such perjured diceit for the accomplishment of his enterprises,
desiring yet to contemplate himself in beholding his lady, the next morning
very early he went to the kings pauilion, where he found the prisoners that
he looked for both to his joy and grief, yet dissembling his own motions, he
said to Leonida, madame, I know it is hard, where mistrust is harbored, to
enforce belief, or to procure credit where troth is called in question, but lady
if I had won such a conquest, and that you were my captive, yet would I honor
you as my sovereign, and obey you as a loving subject.

Leonida not willing to abide any further speeches, cut him of in this manner.

Art thou not ashamed Dorestus to use any such talk* what speak thou of a
conquest, captives I confess we be, but not to a worthy conqueror, but to a
wretched captive, not vanquished by prowess, but by perjury, not by fight, but
by falshoode, hold thy peace therefore, if not at my request yet for thine
own credit, thy triumph in this victory can be but endless shame, and
perpetual infamy.

Dorestus, although he knew himself to be clear of that crime, yet
considering the ladies cause, thought it not good to trouble her with any
reply, but leaving them for that season, as he passed forth he might behold
such extraordinary cruelties used to the citizens and poor subjects of
Hungaria, that it wrought in him a great remorse. This spectacle, with the
remembrance of his Ladies captivity, heaped new grief to old sorrow,
wherefore to persuade Astulpho to the more clemency, he came unto him, to whom
he said in this manner, though it be glorious (most mighty king) to
overcome by battle, yet it is more glorious to overcome by pity, and he
deserves greater praise which wins the hearts of his enemies in his tents
by good example, then in the field by sheading of blood, pardon has ever ben
better then reueng, the one being proper to the spirit of man, the other to
cruel beasts.

Neither can any victory be called true and perfect, but that which carries
with it some clemency, for to overcome is a human thing, but to pardon is
divine, here of it is said, that we esteem the greatness of the immortal
gods, not so much for the punishment, as for the mercy that they use, and
although men's laws avouch it to be more just to reueng an injury received,
then to offer it to an other, yet nature teaches us, that both the one and the
other do proceed of like imbecilyte: under your gracious correction then, it
seems unto me to great severity to afflict the adged father for the offense
of the light headed son, or at the least so to limitte your revenge, that it be
not rather called a tirany then a punishment.

Why Dorestus (answered Astulpho) art thou yet to learn, that the offense of
the children should be punished in the parents, have thou not hard of the
law established by our auncitors, called Falcidia, by which it was inacted,
that the child should be admonished for the first offense, for the second
chastised, for the third hanged, and the father likewise banished as partaker
of his fault, for want of good education and instruction of his son.

The Heluetians had an ancient law, that if a youngman had received sentence
of death, the execution thereof should be done by his father (if he were
living) who was the cause of his evil education, that the father might in some
sort be punished, for the negligence he showed in the bringing up of his child.

Fathers therefore must qualify their children, by bringing them well up in
their infancy, and letting them have due correction in their youth* which two
things being neglected by parents, the faults of their children are most
justly imputed unto them: and Hely the priest was not punished for any fault
which himself had committed, but because he winked at the sins of his
children: would thou then prescribe limittes, of revenge to him that has
fostered up an impe that has practiced so much my prejudice: no no Dorestus,
I will so crucify himself, his wife, and his daughter, that they shall al
curse the hour that such a brat was borne into the world to work my
displeasure, neither shall their cursing any whit help them, till I see their
flesh rotted from their bones, in prison where I purpose to keep them during
life: Dorestus whose heart began to pant with pain, to hear this cruel
conclusion pronounced by Astulpho, against his lady, immediately answered
thus: If Machiauell and his fellows favorers of tirany, had well weied what
we read in infinite places of scripture, that god will ouer-throwe dissemblers
with all their lies and subtilties, hardly could we seek to overcome by
dissimulations, deceites, trecheryes, and such like prankes, then if falshoode
procure blame and dishonor to all men, it does much more to kings and princes,
for where the prince knows himself to be the minister of gods justice, with
what confidence dare he suffer iniquity to enter into his seat, which he
understands to be the throne of the living god, with what conscience will he
pronounce falsehood, out of his mouth, which he knows is appointed to be the
truth of god: with what bouldnes dare he subscribe to disceite with his hand,
which he knows is ordained to wright the decrees of god, but where we are
both judge and party, in steed of justice we seek after force, violence,
rigore, deceit, subtilty, yea perjury rather then fail, and what not so we
may serve our own turn. Astulpho not longer able to endure his speeches he
interrupted him thus.

Dorestus, if you be minded to preach, get you into a palpit: and if you mean
that I have used so many deceit and and subtilties as you speak of, you do
me wrong, for in the capitulation between Miletto and me, we concluded a truce
for ten days, but I subverted him in the night, whereof there was no mention
made, but what and if there had: have you not learned this principle in war,
that in conquering of an empire, there is required as great policy as prowess,
and where the lions skin will not serve, the foxes case must be put on, and
for the obtaining of a kingdom as well mischief as mercy is to be practiced,
and better it were to commit an inconvenience in breaking of an oath, then to
suffer injury by keeping of promise: content thy self therefore Dorestus, and
let this suffice to persuade thee, as I have intrapped mine enemy by practice,
so I assure thee I will hold him by force, but yet (answered Dorestus) if you
mean to hold the inocent father Miletto, what shall become of the harmless
daughter Leonida: Because (quoth Astulpho,) I will be sure to keep her
harmless still, she shall remain my prisoner so long as she lives, for then
I know she shall do me no harm: Dorestus seeing the nature of the tirante,
thought it not best to use any further speeches, but presently with-drewe
himself into his tent, to deliberate with more leisure what he were best to
do, to free his best beloved from her threatened captivity: intreatye he saw
would serve to little purpose, wherefore he determined by sudden assault to
rescue the prisoners by force, and so to deliver them from the hands of
Astulpho: but here he considered his own weakness to perform such an
enterprise, and thought that if he should fail in his attempt, it would
redounde to the greater peril of those parties whose safety he especially
desired, wherefore he resolutly determined, that if by joining himself in
assistaunce with the cuntry, he could not accomplish the performaunce of his
desires, then presently to retire into Epirus, and there to levy such
sufficient numbers, wherewith he would set free the princes altogether from
thraldom, or to make himself a partaker of their misfortunes.

The seventeenth Chapter.
Dorestus resolves to succor the prisoners, Astulpho marches back into his
own kingdom, Dorestus understanding of the king his fathers death, he hastes
to Epirus, he leuieth a mighty army to follow Astulpho into his own
kingdom.

DOrestus fully resolved to follow this course, and casting many devises how
to take opportunity, he found in his account that all desert ways were denaid
him, and this only mean left for him to work by, which was, either by dinte
of sword perforce to effect his purpose, or other wise never to hope for that
he most desired.

Here upon Dorestus both suddenly and secretly, with drew himself with his
whole retinue of Epirotes, unto a place not far distante, which nature had made
strong by mean of a great river that ran about it, where fortifieng therest
by art, he purposed to remain, to see what assistance the cuntry would afford
him, for the rescuing of their king, and the freeing of themselves from
servitude.

Astulpho somewhat amassed with this matter, sent to Dorestus to know his
intent, who returned him again this short answer, that his purpose was not
to assocyate himself with a perjured and deceitful prince, who by a
fraudulent mean and dishonorable conquest had sacked the city and taken the
spoil of the whole to himself, it rested therefore if he would set free all
his prisoners, or at the least, deliver unto his costody, the young lady
Leonida, that then he would come to other articles of agreement: other wise to
account him an open enemy, for so he had protested to show himself unto him.

Astulpho finding out by this request of Dorestus, the very drift of all his
devise, assuring himself it was the love of this lady, that had so altered
Dorestus in his former demeanures: therefore to prevent all perils what so
ever might fall out, and knowing that he had sufficient pledges for the
accomplishment of the rest of his purposes, the very next night gathering his
company together, he marched away with all expeditoin toward his own
cuntry of Illeria, carrieng the king, the queen, with their daughter, away
with him as his prisoners, the which when Dorestus understood of, he thought it
small boot for his purpose to make any longer stay there, but intended as
conuenience might give him leave to supply himself with sufficient forces,
to march after him to Illeria, and to this purpose he craved aid from the
Hungarians, who promised by a day to supply him with sundry regementes, the
which with all possible speed they fell to making ready: Dorestus concluding
with them, both of the place, and the time of both their armies to meet,
marched himself with his whole troops toward Epirus, as well to relieve his
over wearied companyes, with convenient necessaries, as to strengthen himself
with greater forces for his better help. By the way as he was marching, there
incountered him a messenger with news of his fathers death. Here Dorestus
began again to renew his wonted lamentations, in such sort, that many days
ouer-passed before he would receive comfort, yet in the end certifieng
himself, considering that to render retribution is a duty of nature, and a
debt to be paid, either in youth, in age, or at such like season, as is not at
the discretion of man, but at the will and good pleasure of god, with whom we
have no power to contend: and again calling to his remembrance his
undertaken attempt, and to what task he had tied himself, found it high time
to bestirre him, and to shake of those drowsy dumps, which rather seem the
testimonies of a dispayring mind, then the shows of an noble courage.

It would ask here to long discourse, to set down with what signs of joy
Dorestus was welcomed home to Epirus, and how glad his subjects were of his
safe return: but Dorestus at his coming before he would receive the sword and
scepter, took first order for the intombing of his father, whose funerals was
solemnised with such pomp, as was both fit for a famous king, and also
requisite for a christian prince: this done, he was crowned king of Epirus, to
the great comfort of all his subjects, of whom he was generally beloved.

Now he advanced his captains* and conductors, that had bin his partakers in
this former journey, some to places of credit, others to titles of honor and
dignity, and caused a full pay to be made to all his soldiers, gratifieng
every man in whom was any desert with liberal rewards, and this great
largnesse of the king, was such a general encouragement, that now having
occasion to leuy new forces, to strengthen and supply his small company with
greater numbers, such multitudes voluntarily offered themselves out of every
quarter, that without pressing by commission, he was quickly prepared of a
most huge and puissaunte army, and after he had taken order for the due
administering of justice amongst his subjects while he was absent, he marched
to the place which was before appointed for himself and the Hungarian forces
to meet, who keeping promise accordingly, joining their armies together, they
marched toward the confines of Illeria, where they had inteligence that the
king was resident with his prisoners, in the city Ioula, which was the chief
city of the kingdom of Illeria, no less beautiful then strong: thither
ward Dorestus marched with all convenient speed, minding to besiege him
before he should be thoroughly furnished to make resistaunce: and thus we will
leave him marching forward on his way.

The eighteenth Chapter.
Brusanus understanding of his parents captivity, is vehemently grieved,
Antipholus is likewise perplexed to see his friends heauynes, they make a
journey both them selves and their new married brides, into Illeria, to
persuade with Astulpho for the liberty of the prisoners.

ANtipholus and Brusanus, whom we have a long time forgotten, and wherein I
have done the ladies to much wrong, I mean Valeria and Moderna, for women when
they be once determined of marriage, they love not to have the wedding day
deferred, and as you have hard before, their nuptials were concluded, and so
soon as things could be prepared, married they were, Antipholus to Valeria,
and Brusanus to Moderna, all performed in one day, but should I here discribe,
first the feasting, the banqueting, the new dishes that were devised, to please
dainty apitites, the strange fashons that were invented, both for men and women
to make them gaye: the music, the daunsing, the masking, the plays and other
shows that were procured for pleasure, I am sure it would but grieve you: that
you were not there, either to have tasted of their dainties, to have brought
away some of their new fashons, or to have bin partaker of their sportes, I
will therefore omit to speak any further of them: but see (I say) inconstant
fortune, that can never be other wise then like unto her self, who dreaming
gives pleasure, by little dream, but waking gives grief without all
measure, so in the very prime of their pastimes, and as it were, in the midest
of their delights, news was brought, that Astulpho had taken prisoners,
Myletto king of Hungaria, Paulina, the queen his wife, with Leonida their
daughter, Brusanus hearing of this misfortune happened to his father, his
mother, and his sister, was stunge with a vehement grief, that he began
immediately to droupe, being so much over laden with sorrow, as he was not
able to endure it.

Antipholus, again seeing Brusanus (whom he loved as his own life) to be so
much perplexed with care, could not himself rest in quiet, till he had framed
the plat of his friends contentment, comforted therefore with this hope, he
doubted not, but upon his humble entreaty, both to pacify his fathers
displeasure toward Brusanus, and to purchase the delivery of the captiued
Princes: and having made Brusanus privy to his pretense, there was no remedy
but he would bear him company in this iourny: minding indeed if there were no
other mean to mitigate the malice of Astulpho, to surrender himself to his
rage and fury, rather then his innocent parents should suffer endless misery
through his misdemeanure: the new married brides Valeria and Moderna, hearing
of this undertaken voyage, would in no wise be left behind in this iourny, and
it was thought by Antipholus, that the feminine perswations of these two
Ladies, would not a little prevail to move his father to mercy: there rested
nothing now to be determined off, but with-all possible speed to prepare
themselves forward, and their greater have, it was thought convenient, not to
accompany themselves with any other troops, more then their necessary
servants: Antipholus, knowing that all things were ready, and having appointed
his deputy, assisting him with sundry commissioners, for the government of the
kingdom of Calypha until his return, set forwards (as before I have said)
with a small company for their better speed: and whom we will here again leave
in their trauail.

The nineteenth Chapter.
Dorestus beseegeth the City of Pula, Astulpho intends to execute Leonida,
Antipholus, Brusanus, Moderna, Valeria, are taken prisoners, and brought to
Dorestus, which causes Astulpho to stay the death of Leonida.

DOrestus, who after many days marching through Illeria, without any
encounter of his enemies, was com to the City of Pula, which he gyrded in with
a strong siege: howbeit, the impregnable situation of the walls without, and
the abundance of men, victuals, and artilerie within, might have discouraged
the beseegers to assaill, as the same encouraged, they beseyged to resist, and
therefore the barbarous King Astulpho (as it were in dispightful ostentation)
to show how little he forced, or feared his enemies, caused Myletto, with his
wife and daughter laden with Irons, to appear before the walls, and hanging
out a banner as though he purposed a Parle, that calling for Dorestus, who
being come within his hearing, he said: Dorestus, because Leonida (I know) is
the party, for whose inlargment your enemies most especially do now ocupie
Illeria, if therefore her delivery may suffice, be not then hopeless, for
Leonida thou shall have, but I will first take off her head: Here withal the
executioner whom he had appointed for that but barberie, begines to settle
himself about his business, turninge down the collor of her garment, making
her neck bare, the better to do his office, a woeful spectacle to Dorestus, who
was ready to sincke with sorrow, and no less grievous to the wretched King
her father, who hearing and seeing what was determined, in this manner
breathed out the very sorrows of his soul: And are not my already sustained
wrongs, a punishment sufficient to apease thy cruelty, but thou will also
increase my misery, by the blody butcherie of my innocent child, alas do not
so, thy self being father, should have some feeling of a parents
affection: O consider Astulpho of thy own following destiny, and look into
thy self by this my calamity: I was once thou know in thy present
dignity, but thou see what the heavens has now decreed against me: and
little do thou know what may betide thee, but what my adversity makes me
to remember, that thy prosperity causes thee to forget, but could thou
consider of my present misery, and employ the possibillitie to thy self and
thine, I might then find comfort, not doubting thy clemency, with assured hope
of my daughters safety. If therefore the example of my fall, the uncertainty
of thine own fortune, the supplication of a King, the submission of a foe, the
intercession of a father, the tears of an old man, the regard of justice, or
the innocence of my poor Leonida, if all this may preuail, to move thee to
compassion, behold Astulpho, with my tongue I protest it, with my heart I vow
it, by the heavens I swear it and mine act shall perform it, that her
ransom shall be the resignation of my whole intrest of the kingdom of
Hungaria, to thee and thine: If all this will not move thee, I conjure thee yet
in the name of those Gods that will not fail to punish thy tyranie, by the
shame of the world, that will not leave to speak of thine infamy, by the
innocent blood, that will cry vengance against thee, and by thine own guilty
conscience, that at last shall accuse thee: When thus much was spoken and all in
vain: Leonida more perplexed in beholding her fathers grief, then terrified
with the death wher-with her self was thretened, with a cheerful voice, said
as follows: Dear father, one of the greatest benifites that can betide us in
this life, is to be thankful to Gods providence and never to be discouraged by
any misfortune, no not to stand so much in awe of death, that for fear
thereof we should commit any thing unbeseeming a noble heart, having then
patientlye resolved my self, whereunto serves your bootles lamentations,
where-by my death is rather dubled then deferred: for adversities albeit they
have custom to vere, yet have they no power to change the constancye and
courage of a valiante and resolute mind: O seek not then (sweet father, by
your discouraginge sorrows, seek not I say, to hinder my sweet hope, which
hope is death: and death is the salve to all my miseries, and yields assured
truce to the rest of my troubles, and knowing in the end, that all things take
end, it is not the ill death that we have to account of, but it is the ill
dying that is most to be respected. Envy not then your daughters good hap, by
sorrowing her death, but comfort your self with this assured hope, she dies
an innocent: if I were condemned for some notorious ill, perhaps my death
should disquiete you the less, but being as I am innocent from crime me
thinks it should quiet you the more: Wherefore good father seeing that one and
the self same passage is prepared as well for the coward as the courageous, for
the young as for the old, being decreed that all must dye, if not at one time
yet at an other, beeinge far more miserable to deserve it, then to suffer it,
with the reverence of a daughter, therefore I require it, and with out the
partial affection of a father, I beseech you to grant it: that you do not
more discomfort me by your impatient demeanure, then your dishonorable enemy
shall be able to enforce, no not with all his butcherly practices: this is the
last that I may hope to crave, and this is the least that in reason you may
give.

More might she not be suffered to speak, but the executioner was willed to
dispatch his business, and as he was lifting up the sword to have taken off
the head of Leonida, Astulpho might perceive a company both of men and women
that were led as prisoners and brought to Dorestus, and advisedly taking view
of the parties, amongst the rest he assuredly knew Antipholus his son, and
Moderna his daughter: this sight did so amase him that every part of his body
quaked for fear, whereupon he commanded the executioner to hold his hand:
For you shall understand, that Antipholus with that company (as you have heard
before) travailing toward his father, and was come within a very little of
the city of Pula, without any news at all of Dorestus, who the very night
before had beset the City, and that very morning sending forth certain
companies of horsemen to scour the country, they lighted on Antipholus and his
company, who being but few in number, and al unarmed and therefore not able
to make defense, were thus taken prisoners, and in this manner were brought to
Dorestus, who seeing Antipholus whom he so dearly loved, that he disired not
so much as to draw one hair of his head in any displeasure, yet knowing him
to be a sufficent pledge for his purpose, for policies sake he drew his sword,
and coming toward Antipholus, seemed as though he would have sheathed it
through his body, which being espied by Astulpho, who was ready to stuck to
earth for sorrow, he cried out saying: O Dorestus, I beseech thee stay thy
hand, and commit not so great cruelty, and since that fortune has favored
thee, with this unlooked for advantage, triumph thou, ye Astulpho has
submitted, but imbrew not thy hands in the blood of the innocent: Dorestus who
rejoiced not a little to hear these speeches, answered him: Yea marye
Astulpho, this is another manner of song, I am glade you have taken over a
(...) lesson, do you begin to preach, against cruelty: well I hope I shall
have you confirmeable to the rest: but for this present I will go to my tent,
whether if you will send me Leonida, as a pledge, it may be I will return
you such conditions, as may prove to your liking: without any further speeches
Dorestus departed, leading as prisoners in his company, Antipholus, Brusanus
and the rest.

The twentieth Chapter.
Astulpho sends Leonida to Dorestus with conditions of peace, Antipholus is
sent to his father to entreat for Brusanus, Astulpho being overcome with a
sudden Joy, seeing the safety of his son, falls down in a trance and so
dies, Antipholus sets free Myletto and Paulina, Leonida surrendereth her
love to Dorestus, their nuptialles celebrated, they combyne in friendship and
end with contentment.

DOrestus being entered his pauillion, he first in most friendlye manner
embraced Antipholus, blessing the hour of his happy aryuall, hoping by his
means, both to attain to his desired purpose, and likewise to conclude,
assured peace and concord: then turning to Brusanus, the love of whose sister
Leonida, had utterly dissolved, all former conceived displeasures, and
imbrasing him in his arms, he said: O Brusanus, I can but rejoice to think
that the enemy to all weman kind, is yet at the length become a sworn
soldyor in the band of Cupide, and contented to march under the banner of
Venus, I hope by this time you have renounced al your former heresies: Brusanus
answered, yea Dorestus, and blessed be that ghostlye father, by whose
instructions I was first moved to consider of mine own mistaking, and have
ever since (as a true penitent) both acknowledged my ignorance, and done
penance for my error, although not able to make full satisfaction for my
miss: Dorestus then humbly kissing the hand of Moderna, said: and truly
madame your merit was much in this matter, having saved a soul, that by his
own confession was in the very high way to perdition: Then I hope sir
(answered Moderna) since he has cried Peccaui, his faults be then remissiue
both to God and the world: Dorestus, who knew very well wher-vnto her speeches
had relation, would return her no answer, but resting his eyes upon Valeria,
whom although he knew not, yet he stood amazed, to see such perfection of
beautye, demanded of the standers by what Lady it might be, Antipholus who
could best satisfy him, told him that she was a Princess, the daughter and
heir of Belizarius King of Calypha, lately deceased, and his wife, but newly
married Dorestus, then kissing her hand, began to comfort her, assuring her
that she was lighted into ye hands of such a friendly enemy, as was ready to do
unto her both honor and service: As Dorestus intended to have proceeded in
further speeches, word was brought him that Astulpho had sent Leonida, who was
coming fast by, and was already entered within their Corpse de gwarde.
Dorestus, to testefie how joyful these tidinges were unto him, gave the news
bringer a chain that he ware about his own neck, esteemed to be of great
price: and desiring Antipholus with the rest to accompany him, he met Leonida
whom he entertained with great shows of humillity, and was nevertheless
possessed, with as much joy and gladness, and having in his mind, prepared a
long oration for her, his eyes were so filled with her sight, that (as if
they would have robbed their fellows of their services) both his heart
faynted, and his tongue failed: Antipholus then kissing the hand of Leonida,
entertained her for the present but with a usual salutation: but Leonida
casting her eyes upon Brusanus was not a little comforted, in the presence of
her brother, and he accordingly welcomed his sister, with as great shows of
brotherly love, as outwardly could be expressed: Valeria and Moderna, had now
their turns to entertain Leonida, which both saluted her with no less signs
of hearty affection: Leonida being thus welcomed to the company, Dorestus caused
4000. crowns to be delivered to her conductors, which were four Gentlemen
sent with her from Astulpho. After these Gentlemen altogether, had given
humble thanks to Dorestus for his great bounty, the one of them delivered
this message from Astulpho, signifieng to Dorestus, that the King his master,
to satisfy his request, had sent him his so much desired Leonida, in requital
whereof, if he would return him her brother Brusanus, he should then find
him confirmeable to his further demands, whatsoever might be thought
convenient and necessary, for the establishment of peace, love and amity
between them: And although Dorestus minded nothing less then to satisfy
Astulpho in that request: yet Antipholus, who tendered the safety of Brusanus,
as much as his own life, and knowing the displeasure of his father, to
concern no less then the death of his friend: he besought Dorestus with
great intercession, that he would not commit an act of such impiety, for to
deliver a Prince wittinglye to the slaughter, were no less then himself to
commit wilful murder: Dorestus rejoicing in his mind, at this unfeigned
frie^dship, demanded of Antipholus if he could devise the mean to pacify his
fathers fury toward Brusanus: To this Antipholus answered, that he had left
the kingdom of Calipha, and had undertaken this sudden journey, but only to
that very end, neither dowbted he, but if himself might come to the speech of
his father, that he would both mitigate his fathers displeasure toward
Brusanus, and otherwise to win him to be the better confirmeable for the
deliuerye of Myletto and Paulina: Dorestus who knew very well that Antipholus
would (in very deed) do his best to perform as much as he had said, and
knowing Valeria to be a sufficient pledge, was content that Antipholus should
make present proof of his own practice, the which Antipholus most willingly
undertook, and making no doubt at all of his good success, he departed
toward his father, who was likewise attending an answer from Dorestus, and
more then half in despair of his sons safety, fretting and fuming at
himself, that had so rashly sent away Leonida, before he understood what was
happened to his son: in the midest of these his melancholy fittes, Antipholus
presented himself before his father, and humbly casting himself upon his
knees: Astulpho beholding the safe arrival of his son, was not so much
before perplexed with exstreame grief, but he was as suddenly converted to a
fit of no less excessive gladness, and rising from his seat purposing to
embrace his son, being ouercom with a surfeit of to much joy, he presently sanck
dead to the earth, neither could he ever after be recovered, by any
artificial mean what so ever could be imployde: I will not stand here to
figure forth the dolorous complaints of Antipholus, whose sorrows were as
exceeding as his fathers death was sudden, but calling to his remembrance
that against death there was neither prescription, nor authority, who yeeldes
no compassion to the tears of men, takes no care for their sighs, scorns at
their complaints, and plaieth with their afflictions, Antipholus therefore
pacifieng himself for the season, began to bethink him of his other
affairs, and having now the law in his own hand, he caused Myletto with
Paulina to be brought both before him: who after he had most lovingly
embraced he comforted them with cheerful and loving speeches, he likewise
caused them to be royally robed, in rich and sumptious apparel be-fitting
their estate, and because Dorestus should dread no bad measure, he sent a
messenger unto him, with the certainty of his fathers death, then making the
gats of the city on every side to be set wide open in sign of peace and amity,
accompanieng himself with the king and queen of Hungaria, with some few
noble men to attend their persons, he went to Dorestus, to whom he said:
behold Dorestus in respect of former friendship, lately begun between us,
and to that end it may be for ever unfeignedly continued, I do here freely
deliver unto thee, Miletto king of Hungaria, with Paulina the queen his wife,
the parties which thou have so much desired to set at liberty, neither would I
deliver them into thy hands but that I assure my self of thy princely meaning
toward them, and since it has pleased the heavens thus to call away my
father, I know not now what should hinder, but that this friendship between us
should be so surely knit, that no future fortune shall ever be able to
dissolve: It would ask here another volume, to set down at large, the
comfort, the contentment, the quiet, and the joy that was now made amongst
these princes, Dorestus triumphed in hope to have his desired Leonida, Miletto
rejoiced as fast in the virtuous reconcylyation of his son, Brusanus was no
less joyful for the safe delivery of his father, Antipholus was as much
delighted to see Brusanus pleased, but after they had a while spent the time in
this manner, Dorestus took order for the dissoluing of his army, and causing a
general pay to be made, he sent them away with their captains and leaders:
Miletto likewise giving the Hungarians thanks that had opposed themselves in
his rescues, sent them also away, assuring them upon his return, both to
remember their kindness, and to recompense their duetifull endeavors: These
matters thus over passed, Dorestus was at leisure to consider of his own
estate, which he thought to be more unfortunate then the rest, who having set
all at liberty, and only himself to remain a captive: but it was determined
amongst them that they would all remain for a season with Antipholus: who had
likewise prepared to entertain them with as great honor as the time would
afford him, yet tempering his mirth with such mean as was necessary for the
instant, considering the late decease of his father that was yet unburied,
being not thoroughly provided for his funerals: Dorestus in this mean space,
taking advantage of time, so solicited Leonida a fresh, that she calling to
her mind the high service he had performed in her behalf, in requital
wheerof, she surrendered herself to satisfy his demandes, to the great
contentment of her father and mother, but especially of her dearest brother
Brusanus: The marriage day was quickly determined, and likewise honored with
the presence of all these princes, here began again feasting and banqueting
afresh* still enterlarding their dishes with such pleasures as could most aptly
be prepared for the present: having thus for a season, spent the time as much to
their own contentment as might be, and after they had combined a perpetual
league of friendship between themselves, they departed, Myletto and his queen
to Hungaria, Dorestus and Leonida to Epirus, Brusanus and Moderna to Dalmatia,
which was her inhiritaunce, Antipholus and Valeria, continue in Illeria, and
they severally reigned, in perfect love and amity between themselves,
governing their people with such equity and justice, as they neither wanted
love to their subjects, nor their subjects duty and obedience to them: all
parties thus pleased, and every one remaining in most happy contentment, I hold
it best even so to leave them, for in a fitter time, it is not possible to end.

FINIS.
