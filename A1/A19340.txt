Coridons commendation in the praise of his love the fair Phillis. To a
pleasant new tune.

MY Love she is fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest,
For she will all her business do,
I know she is fair and honest too.
My Phillis is full of favors,
And fair as fair may be:
Silly Swain^s leave off your labors,
She will love no man but me.
For she is most fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest:
And will each virtuous business do,
I know she is fair and honest too.
No sugared tempting tongue,
Nor golden promise fair,
Can do my Phillis wrong,
Or her good name impair.
For she is fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest:
And will do st^ll what maids will do,
Yet is she fair and honest too.
She has a charming voice,
Not lik^ her in music many:
Yet Phillis remains my choice,
And will not be won by any.
For she is most fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest:
And will show favor as others do
Yet is she fair (...)
If Cupid bend his bow,
His shaft she turns aside,
And tells him whither to go,
That can it better abide.
So she is fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest:
And will perform what others do,
Yet is she fair and honest too.
My Phillis can Garlands make,
To set on her lovers head:
And gallantly undertake,
To deck out a Bridal bed.
Yet is she fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest,
And will show love as Maidens do,
Yet she is fair and honest too.
My Phillis can foot it right,
And follow the Bagpipes droone:
When Coridon comes in sight,
Experience must be shown.
So still she is fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest,
And take pleasure as others do,
Yet is she fair and honest too.
When mirthfull May comes in,
My Phillis will undertake,
(...)at shall begin,
^
The second Part. To the same tune.

YEt still she is fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest,
And make sport as maids will do,
Yet is she fair and honest too.
No less in all our town,
In sporting or in play,
Can put my Phillis down,
She bears so great a sway.
Yet is she fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest:
Though she c^n such like pastimes do,
Yet is she fair and honest too.
Her huswiserie's well known,
There Is nothing goes to wrack,
She keeps full well her own,
While other good lasses lack.
Yet is she fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest,
And can good houshould-busines do,
I know she is fair and honest too.
My love can brew and bake,
As other huswiues can:
And make a boul^ed cake,
To give her neighbors man.
Yet is she true and honest,
I know she is true and honest,
Though she such friendly tricks can do,
Yet is she true and honest too,
My love can milk a Cow,
And teach a calfe to suck:
And knows the manner how,
To set a brooded Duck.
So is she wise and honest,
I know she is wise and honest:
And can such household business do,
So is she wise and honest too.
My loves a lovely less,
Her Coridon must love,
And times will come to pass,
When maids and men may prove.
For she is true and honest,
I know she is true and honest,
And will love as maids will do,
Yet is she fair and honest too.
You shepherd swains be wise,
Choose one as I have done,
That will not be precize,
But be with reason wone.
For she is fair and honest,
I know she is fair and honest,
And will her husbands pleasures do,
Therefore she is fair and honest too.
FINIS.
