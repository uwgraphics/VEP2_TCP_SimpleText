Ptholomeus.

The prologue of Ptholomeus.
SO as we understand Ptholomeus says / that living and dyeng is all at the
pleasure of almighty god. Yet he says that a man may live by the course of
nature.lxxii. year or more. And he says also as much time / as a man has to
grow in beauty / length / bredthe / and strength. So much time has he to
wax old and feeble to his end. But the term to grow in beauty / hyghte /
and strength / is.xxxvi. year. And the term to wax old / feeble / and weyke /
to turn to the erthwarde / which is in all together.lxxii. year / that he
ought to live after the course of nature. And they that dye before this time /
often it is by the vyolence and out rage done to their Complexion and nature.
But they that live above this term / it is by good regyment and ensygnementes
/ after which a man has governed himself. To this purpose of living and
dyeng: Ptholomeus says / that the thing that we desire most in this world
is to live long: And the thing that we most fere is to dye soon. Thus he
trauayled his understanding / and made great dylygence to know and to do
things possible and requysyte for to live long / hole / and joyfully / which
this present Compost shows and techeth. wherefore we will show you of the
bodies Celestyall / and of their nature and mouynges: and this p^sent book is
named the Compost of Ptholomeus / for it co^prechendeth fully all the Compost.
And this present book is made for them that be of small learning / to bring
them to great understanding. Thus Ptholomeus said also that the desire to live
long was in his soul / the which always lasts / wherefore he would that his
desire were accomplysshed after his death / as before. He said sith the foul
dies not / and in it is the desire to live long / it should be an infallable
pain (not to live after death: as before) for he that lives not after his
corporal death / shall not have that / that he has desired (that is to wete)
to live long / and should abide in eternal pain / if his desire were not
accomplysshed. So concluded the said Ptholomeus necessary things for him and
other / to know and to do that which appertayned / to live after death as
before. And truth it is that he that lives / but the life of this world
only / and though he lived an.C. year / yet he lived not properly long. But
he should live long that at the end of this present life / should begin the
life eternal (that is to say) the life everlasting in heaven. So a man ought
to parforme his life in this world corporally / that they may live spiritually
without end. For as he said / one shall live euerlastyngly with out dyenge /
and when he has the pardurable life he shall be parfyte. And also by this
point and none otherwise shall be accomplysshed the desire of long living in
this world. The foresaid Ptholomeus also knowleged / that the life of this
world was soon paste and gone. wherefore this Ptholomeus thought that.lxxii.
years / here in this vale of wretched mysery / is but a little and a small
term of life / to the life everlasting: the which never shall have ending.
And therefore he says / he that offeryth him self here to live virtuously in
this world / after this life he shall receive the sweet live / that is sure
and lasts ever without end. For though a man lived here a.C. year and more:
it is but a little term to the life to come. Therefore says this Ptholomeus /
I will live soberly with these small temporal goods that Ihesu has lend me:
and ever to exyle the desire of worldly riches and worldly worship. For they
that labor for it: and have love to their goods and vain worshyppes / often
it departs mary from heavenly treasoure. It shytteth man's heart that god may
not enter. And buyldeth man a place of no rest in the low land of derkenesse

Here after follows another Prologue of two other Astronomyers / that shows
and proves the auctours Prologue true that is before rehearsed.
BE it to understand / that there be in the year.iiii. quarters / the which
be named thus. Vere / Hyems / Estas / and Autumnus. These be the.iiii. seasons
in the year / as Pryme time is the spring of the year / as Feueryere / March
/ and Apryll. In these.iii. months every grene thing growing / begins to
budde and flourysshe. Than comes somer as May / June / and July / and
these.iii. months / every herb / grain / and tree / is in his kind and in
his most strength and beautye / and than the Son is at the highest. Than
comes Autumn: as August / Septembre / and Octobre / that all these fruytes
waxen type / and ben gathered and howsed. Than comes Nouembre / Decembre / and
Ianyuere / and these.iii. months be in the winter / that time the Son^e is at
the lowest / and is the time of little profit. As we Astronomyers say / that
the age of man is.lxxii. year / and that we lyken but to one hole year / for
evermore we take.vi. year for every Monthe / as Ianyuere / or Feueryere / and
so forth / for as the year changes by the.xii. months: In to.xii. diverse
manners / so does a man change him self.xii. times in his life / by.xii.
aeges / and every aege lasts.vi. year / if so be that he live to.lxxii.
for.iii. times.vi. makes.xviii. and.vi. times.vi. makes.xxxvi. And than man
is at the best / and also at the highest / and.xii. times.vi. makes.lxxii. And
that is the aege of man.

Thus must you count and reken for every monthe.vi. year / or else it may be
understand by the.iiii. quarters and seasons of the year. So man is divided in
to.iiii. parties: as to youth / strength / wisdom / and aege. He so to
be.xviii. year young.xviii. year strong xviii. year in wisdom / and the
fourth.xviii. year to go to the full of the aege of.lxxii.

Here follows to show how man changes.xii. times / even as the.xii.
months does.
WE must take the first.vi. year for Ianyuere / the which is of no virtue
nor strength / in that season no thing on the earth grows. So man after
that he is borne / tylhe be.vi. year of aege is with little or no wit /
strength / or cunning / and may do little or no thing that comes to
profit.

Than comes Feueryere: and than the days longs / and the Son is more
hotter / than the feldes begin to wax grene. So the other.vi. year till he come
to.xii. the child begyn^eth to grow bygger / and is apt to learn such
things as is taught him.

Than comes the monthe of March / In which the labourer sows the earth /
and planteth trees / and edyfyeth houses / the child in these.vi. years waxes
bygge to learn doctrine and scycnce / and to be fair and plesaunt and loving
/ for than he is.xviii. year of aege.

Than comes Apryll / that the earth and the trees is coueryd with grene
floutes. And in every party goods increases habundauntly. Than comes the
young man to gather the sweet flowers of hardynes / but than beware that the
cold wyndes and storms of vices beat not down the flowers of good manners /
that should bring man to honor / for than is he.xxiiii. year of aege.

Than comes May / that is both fair and plesaunte / for than birds sing
in woddes and forestes night and day / the Son shyneth hot / as than man is
most lusty / mighty / and of deliver strength / and seeks plays / sportes /
and manly pastymes / for than is he full.xxx. year of aege.

Than comes June: and than is the son at the highest in his merydyonall / he
may ascend no higher in his stacion. His glemerynge golden beams typeth the
corn / and than man is.xxxvi. year / he may ascend no more For than nature
has given him courage and strength at the full / and typeth the seeds of
parfyte understanding.

Than comes July: that our fruytes be set on sonnynge / and our corn a
hardenynge / but than the Son begins a little for to descend do wnewarde.
So than man goth fro youth to ward aege / and begins for to acquaynt him
with sadness: for than he is come to.xlii. year.

After that than comes August / than we gather in our corn / and also the
fruytes of the earth. And than man does his dylygence to gather for to find
him self to maynteyn his wife / children / and his household when age comes on
him. And than after that.vi. year / he is.xlviii. year of aege.

Than comes Septembre / that wynes be made / and the fruytes of the trees be
gathered. And than there withal he does fresshely begin to garnysshe his
house / and make prouysion of needful things / for to live with in winter /
which draws very nere / and than man is in his most steadfast and covetous
estate prosperous in wisdom / purposynge to gather and keep / asmoche as
should be sufficyent for him in his aege / when he may gather no more. And than
is he.liiii. year of aege.

And than comes Octobre: that all is in to the foresaid house gaderyd / both
corn and also other manner of fruytes. And also the laborers plowe and sow
new seeds on the earth: for the year to come. And than he that naught sows
naught gatheryth. And than in these vi. year a man shall take him self unto
god for to do penance and good works / and than the benefytes the year after
his death / he may gather / and have spiritual profit / and than man is
fully the term of.lx. years.

Than comes nouembre / that the days be very short / and the Son in manner
gives but little hete / and the trees losen their leuys. The feldes that were
grene looks hoore and graye / Than all manner of herbs ben hid in the
ground / and than apperyth no flowers. And than winter is come / that the man
has understanding of aege / and has lost his kyndely hete and strength.
His teth begin to rot / and to fail him. And than has he little hope of long
life / but defyreth to come to the life everlasting. And these.vi. years make
him.lxvi. of aege.

Than last comes Decembre / full of cold with froste and snow / with great
wyndes and stormy wethers / that a man may not labor nor naught do. The son
is than at the lowest that it may discende. That the trees and the earth be
hid in snow / than it is good to hold them nygh the fire / and to spend
the goods that they gat in somer. For than man begins to wax crooked and
feeble / couchyng and spyttynge / and loothsom / and than he loses his parfyte
understanding / and his heirs desire his death. And these.vi. year makes him
full.lxxii. years. And if he live any longer / it is by his good guydynge / and
dyetyng in his youth. How be it / it is possible that a man may live till he
be a.C. year of aege: but there be but few that lives so long till they come
to a.C. year of aege. wherefore Ptholomeus says moreover / that of living or
dyeng / the heavenly bodies may stere a man both to good and evil / without
doubt it is so. But yet may man withstand it by his own fre will / to do
what he will him self / good or badde evermore. And above the which
inclynacion is the might and will of god / that longs the life of man by his
goodness / or to make it short by justice.

wherefore I will show you of the bodies Celestyall / and of their nature and
mouynges / And this present Book has to name the Compoft of Ptholomeus / for
it comprehends fully all the compoft / as days / hours / and of the son
and moon / and of the Signs that the moon is in eueryday. And this book was
made for them that be little or no clerks / to bring them to more
understanding and lerenynge of many diverse things that were necessary for
them to have knowleg of and to vere it in their mind.

Here follows to know the.xii. signs in their course reygnynge and rulynge
upon the.xii. parties of man's body: and which ben good for lettynge of blood
/ and indifferent / or evil. Captiulo. Primo.
SO it is that I do you knowledge that I say that a man is a little world by him
self: for the likeness and symylytudes / that he has of the great world /
which is the aggregacion of the.ix. skies.iiii. elements / and all things in
them contained. First a man has such a lykenes in the first mobyle / that
is the soueraygne sky / and pryncipall part of all the world / for like as
in this first mobyle the zodyake is divided in.xii. parties / that been
the.xii. Signs. So man is divided in.xii. parties / and holds of the signs
every part of his sign. The signs ben these / Aries / Taurus / Gemini /
Cancer / Leo / Virgo / Libra / Scorpio / Sagittartus / Capricornus / and
Pisces. Of the which / three ben of the nature of fire / that is Aries / Leo /
and Sagittarius. And three of nature of the air / Gemini / Libra / and
Aquarius. And three of the nature of water / Cancer / Scorpio / and Pisces. And
three of the nature of the earth / Taurus / Virgo and Caprtcornus. The first is
Aries that governs the head / and the face of man. Taurus the neck and the
throat bole. Gemini the sholdres / the arms / and the hands. Cancer the
breast / sides / mylte / and lyghtes. Leo the stomach / the heart / and the
back. Virgo the belly and the entrayles. Libra the nauyll / the graynes / and
the parties under the branches. Scorpio the pryue parties / the genytores /
the bladder: and the fou^dyment. Sagittarius the thyghes only. Capricornus
also the knees only Aquarius the legs from the knees to the he les and
ankles. And Pisces has the fete in his domynyon. A man ought not to make
incysyon nor touch with iron / the membre governed of any sign / the day
that the moon is in it / for fere of to great effusyon of blood that might
happen / Nor in likewise when the Son is in it / for the great danger and
peril that might follow thereof.

Hereafter follows the Nature of the.xii. signs. Captulo.ii.

Here follows the Nothomye of the bones in man's body / and the nombre of
them: which is in all.ii.C. and.xl.viii. Capitulo.iii.
IN the top of the head is a bone that covers the brain / the which
Ptholomeus calls the capytall bone. In the skull ben two bones / which ben
called Parietales that holds the brain close and steadfast. And more lower
in the brain is a bone called the crown of the head / and on the one side /
and on the other ben two holes / within the which is the palys or rofe bone. In
the party behind the head ben.iiii.like bones / to the which the chain of
the neck holds. In the nose ben.it bones. The bones of the chaftes above
ben.xi. And of the nether iawe ben.ii. Above the apposyte of the brain / there
is one behind named collateral. The bones of the tethe ben.xxx. eyghte
before.iiii. above / and.iiii.underneath sharp edgyd for to cut the morselles
/ and there is.iiii. sharp.ii. above / and.ii.underneath and ben called conynes
/ for they ben like conyes tethe. After that been.xvi. that be as they were
hamers or gryndyng tethe / for they chawe and grynde the mete the which is
eten / and there is.iiii. above on every side / and.iiii.underneath: And than
the.iiii. teth of sapyence on every side of the chaftes one above / and one
underneath. In the chynne from the head downewarde ben.xxx. bones called knottes
or joints. In the breast before ben.vii. bones / and on every side.xii. rybbes.
By the neck between the head and the sholdres ben.ii. bones named the sheres /
and ben the two sholdre blades. From the sholdre to the elbowe in each arm is
a bone called the adiutor. From the elbowe to the hand on every arm / ben.ii.
bones that been called cannes. In each hand ben.viii. bones / above the palm

fete in each of the which ben.v. bones. The bones in the toes i^ each foot ben
the nombre of.xiiii. Two bones ben before the belly for to hold it steadfast
with the two branches Two bones ben in the head behind the eres called
oculares. We teken not the tender bones of the end of the sholdres / nor of
the sides / nor diverse little grystels and speldres of bones / for they ben
comprehended in the nombre beforesayde.

Here follows the Flubothomye with the names of the veins / and where they
rest / and how they ought to be letten blood. Capitulo.iiii.
HEre I do you to wit: that the vain in the mids of the forehede would be let
ten blood / for the ache and pain of the head / and for fevers Lytargye / and
for the megryme in the head.

About the two eres behind is two veins / the which ben letten blood / for
to give clear understanding / and virtue of light herynge / and for thycke
brethe: and for doubt of meselry or lepry.

In the temple ben two veins called the Artyers for that they beat / which
ben letten blood for to demynysshe and take away the great repleccion and
abundaunce of blood that is in the brain / that might noye the head and the
iyen and it is good against the gowte the megryme / and diverse other accydentes
that may come to the head.

Under the tongue ben two veins / that been letten blood for a syckenes called
the Sequamy / and against the swellynge / and appostomes of the throat / and
against the equynancy / by the which a man might dye suddenly / for defaute of
such bledynge.

In the neck ben two veins called origynalles / for that they have the course
and abu^daunce of all the blood that governs the body of man / and
pryncipally the head / but they ought not to be letten blood without the
cou^ceyle of the Surgyon / and this bledynge avails much to the syckenes of
Lepry / when it comes pryncipally of the blood.

The vain of the heart taken in the arm / profyteth to take away humors or
evil blood / that might hurt the chamber of the heart or the apperteynaunce /
and is good for them that spytteth blood / and that been short wynded / by the
which a man may dye suddenly / for defaute of such bledynge.

The vain of the liver taken in the arm aswaygeth the great hete of the body
of man and holds the body in health / and this bledynge is profitable also
against the yelowe axes / and appostome of the liver / and against the palsy
whereof a man may dye / for defaute of such bledynge.

Between the master finger and the leche finger to let blood helps the
dolours that comes in the stomach and sides / as botches / and appostomes /
and diverse other accydentes that may come to those places by great abundaunce
of blood and humors.

In the sides between the womb and the brau^che ben two veins / of the which
that of the right side is letten blood for the dropsy: and that of the left
side for every syckenes that comes about the mylte / and they should blede
after the persons be fat or lene / take good head at four fyngers nyghe the
incysion: and they ought not to make such bledynge without the counsel of
the Surgyon.

In every foot ben three veins / of the which three / one is under the ancle of
the foot named sophane / the which is letten blood for to swage and put out
diverse humors / as botches and appostomes that comes about the graynes / and
it profyteth much to women for to cause their menstruosyte to discende / and
delay the emoroydes: that comes in the secret places / and other like.

Between the wrestes of the foot / and the great too is a vain / the which is
letten blood for diverse syckenes and inconuenyences: as the pestylence that
takes a person suddenly by the great superabundaunce of humors / and this
bledynge must be made within a natural day / that is to say within.xxiiii.
hours after that the syckenesse is taken of the pacyent / and before that the
fever come on him / and this bledynge ought to be done after that corpolence of
the pacyent.

In the angels of the iyen ben two veins the which ben letten blood / for the
rednes of the iyen / or watery / or that renneth contynually / and for diverse
other syckenes that may happen / and come by over great abundance of humors
and blood.

In the vain of the end of the nose is made a bledynge / the which is good
for a red pympled face / as ben red drops / pustulus / small skabbes / and
other infections of the heart that may come therein by to great repleccion /
and abundaunce of blood and humors / and it avails much against popeled
noses / and other like syckenesses.

In the mouth in the gu^mes ben four veins / that is to say two above / and
two byneth the which ben letten blood for chausynge and canker in the mouth /
and for toth ache.

Between the lyppe and the chynne is a vain / that is letten blood to give
amendment to them that have an evil brethe.

In each arm ben four vain / of the which the vain of the head is the
highest / the second next is from the heart / the third is of the liver /
and the fourth is from the mylte otherwise called the low liver vain.

The vain of the head taken in the arm / ought to blede / for to take away the
great repleccion and abundaunce of blood that may anoye the head / the iyen /
and the brain / and avails greatly for chaungeable hetes / and swel lynge of
the throat / and for them that have swollen faces and red / and for diverse
other syckenesses that may fall and come by great abundaunce of blood.

The vain of the mylte otherwise called the low vayn should blede against
fever tercyens and quartaynes / and in it ought to be made a wide and a less
deep wound: than in any other vain / for fere of wind that it may gather /
and for a more inco^uenyence for fere of a senowe that is under it / that is
called the lezarde.

In each hand ben three veins / whereof that above the thombe ought to blede /
to take away the great hete of the vysage / and for much thycke blood and
humors that been in the head / and this vain delayeth more than that of the
arm.

Between the little finger and the leche finger is lettynge of blood: that
greatly avails against all fever tercyens / and quartaynes and against
flumes: and diverse other lettynges that comes to the pappes / and the mylte.

In each thyghe is a vain / of the which bledyng avails against doloures of
the genytoures / and for to put out of man's body humors that been in the
graynes.

The vain that is under the ancle of the foot without is named sciat / of the
which ble dynge is much worth against the pains of the flanks / and for to
make avoid and issue diverse humors / which would gadre in the said place /
and it avails greatly to women / for to restrain their menstruosyte / when
they have to great abundaunce.

Thus ends the fleubothomye / And here follows to know when a man is hole /
or disposed to syckenes. Capitulo.iiii.
Now to give you knowledge when that any man is hole or sick / or disposed in
any wise to syckenes? wherefore three things there ben: by the which Ptholomeus
put knowledge when a man is hole or sick / or disposed to syckenes. If he be
hole / to maynteyne and keep him. If he be sick to seek remedy to hele him.
If he be disposed to syckenes / to keep him that he fall not there in. And for
each of the three said things / the said Ptholomeus put diverse signs. Health
properly attemperaunce / accord / and equalyte of the.iiii. qualytes of man /
which ben hot cold / dry / and moist. The which when they ben well tempred
and egall that the one surmount not the other / than the body of man is hole.
But when they ben vnegal and mysse tempred / and the one has power one over an
other / than a man is sick or disposed to syckenes / and they ben the qualytes
that the body holds of the clementes that they ben made and composed of /
that is to say of the fire hete / of the water cold / of the air moist /
and of the earth dry. The which qualytes / when one is disordred from the
other / than the body is sick. And if that one distroye all the other / than
the body dies / and the soul departs.

The sign to know a man hole / and well disposed in his body. Cap^.v.
THe first sign whereby Ptholomeus knew a man to be hole / and well disposed
in his body / was when he eteth and drynketh well after the conuenaunce of the
hunger and thyrste that he has without making excess. And also when he
dygesteth lightly / and when that he has eten or drynken it troubles and
greuyth not his stomach. Also when he feleth good sauoure / and good appetyte
in that he eteth and drynketh. Also when he is hungry and thyrsty at the hours
that he ought to ete and drink. And also when he reioyseth him with folk.
Also when they play gladly in the feldes and gardens to take the sweet air
and sport in the meadows by water sides. Also when he eteth gladly and with
good appetyte of butter / chese / and flawnes without leuynge any thing in his
dysshe to send to the alms house. Also when he slepeth well and suerly
without rauynge or dremynge of his besynes. Also when he feleth him light: and
that he walks well. And when he sweteth soon / and that he nyseth little or
nothing. Also when he is nouther to fat nor to lene. Also when he has good
color in his face / and that his wits ben all well disposed for to do their
operacion / as his iyen for to se / his eres to here / his nose to smell. etc.
And I leave of the conuenaunce of aege / the disposicion of the body / and also
of time. Of other signs I say no thing: but these most suffyse for the pore
lay people / to know the signs of health.

These signs ben contrary to them aforesaid / by the which Ptholomeus knew
when he or other were sick. Cap^.vi.
First when he may not well ete nor drink / or that he have none appetyte
to ete at dinner and souper / or when he fyndeth no sauoure in that he eteth or
drynketh / or that he is hungry and may not ete / when his dygestyon is not
good / or that it be to long. Also when he goth to chamber moderatly as he
ought to do. Also when he is pensive / sad sorry / or heavy in right joyous or
cherefull companyes: than syckenes constrayneth a man to be thoughtfull.
Semblably when he may not sleep nor take his rest a right and at due hour
with quyetnes / as is requysyte for all helthfull persons to have. And also
when his members ben heavy / as his head / his legs / and arms / with other
members. And also when he may not walk easily and lightly and that he spueth
often / and his color is pale or yelowe: or when his wits / as his / iyen his
eres / and other do not kyndely their operacyons. In likewise when he may not
labor and travail. Also when he forgets light ly that which of necessyte
ought to be kept in memory / and when he spytteth often / or when his nose
thrylles abou^deth in superfluous humors. And when he is neclyge^t in his
works: and when his flesh is blown or swollen in the vysage / in his legs
/ or his fete / or when his iyen ben holowe in his head. These ben the signs
that sygnyfyeth a man being in syckenes / and who that has most of the
foresaid signs / most is infecte with syckenes.

Other signs almost semblable to them aforesaid / and shows the replection
of cuyll humors / and for to be purged of them. Capitulo.vii.
REplection is a fulness of evil humors / and disposycion of syckenes after
the opinion of Ptholomeus / of the which replection is to know how to purge
the said humors / that they engendre no syckenes / and ben known by the
signs that follows. First when a man has over great rednes in his face /
in his hands: or in his nails / having also his veins full of blood / or
bledeth to much at the nose / or to often / or has pain in the forehed. Also
wha^ his eres sounds / and when his iyen waters / or be full of gu^me / and
has his understanding troubled / and when the poulx beteth to fast / and
when the belly is long resolute and laxe / and when he has the sight troubled
/ and etynge also without appetyte. And by all these and other signs
beforesayd one may know the body evil disposed / and full of corrupt
humors superfluous and evil.

A dyuysyon and regyment of time / the which Ptholomeus used / after that the
season and time required. Capitulo.viii.
AS for to remedy the syckenesses / and infyrmytes that a man has / and to
keep him from them that been doubted to come / Ptholomeus says that the time /
naturally changes four times in the year: and so they deuyde the year in
four quarters: that is Vere / Somer / Harvest / and winter. And in each of
these quarters he did govern him as the seasons required to his mind / and
the better it was for him. And as the season changes / so changed he his
manner of living and doing / and says that chaungynge of time without taking
good head often engenders infyrmytes / for that one time behooves not / to use
some metes that been good in another time / as that used in winter is not all
good in Somer / and so of the other seasons. And for to know the chau^gynge of
time after these said quarters or seasons / they consider the course of the
Son by the.xii. Signs / and say that every of the said four quarters and
seasons dureth four Months / and that the Son passes by three signs: that
is to wete in Pryme time by Pisces / Aries / and Taurus / and these ben the
months / February / March / and Apryll / that the earth and trees reioyseth
and charge with grene leaves and flowers / that is a pleasur to behold. In
somer by Gemini / Cancer / and Leo: and the months ben May June / and July /
that the fruytes of the earth grows and rypeth. In harvest by Virgo / Libra /
and Scorpio: and the months ben August / Septembre / and Octobre / that the
earth and trees discharges the fruytes and leaves / and that time every body
felleth and gaderyth the fruytes. In winter by Sagittarius / Capricornus / and
Aquarius: and the months ben Nouembre / Decembre / and January / that the
earth and trees ben as deed and unclothed of leaves / fruytes / and of all
grenesse. After the which.iiii. seasons / Ptholomeus deuysen the time that man
may live in.iiii. aeges / as youth / strength / and decrepyte / and lykened to
the four seasons of the year. That is to wete / youth to Pryme time that is
hot and moist: and as the herbs and trees of the earth grows / so does
man in youth unto.xxv. year grow of body / in strength beauty and vygoure.
Strength is lykened unto Somer hot and dry / and the body of man is in force
and vygoure / and enrypeth unto.xlv. year. Aege is compared unto the time of
Harvest cold and dry that man leueth of growing and febleth / and thinks
how to gather and spare for fere of defaute and need that he comes to
stoupynge aege / and dureth to.lvi. years. Decrepyte is lykened to the season
of winter cold and moist by abundaunce of cold humors and defaute of
natural hete / in the which time man spends that which he had gathered and
kept in time passed / and if he have spared no thing / he abides poor and
naked / as the earth and trees / and dureth unto lxxii. year or more Prymetyme
is hot and moist / nature of air / and complexion of the sanguyne. Somer is
hot and dry / nature of fire / and complexion of the coloryke. Harvest is
cold and dry / nature of earth / and complexion of melancoly. winter is cold
and moist / nature of water / complexion of the flumatyke. when complexion
is well proporcyoned / it feleth it self better disposed in the time semblable
to it / than it does in other times. But for that every man is not well
complectioned / they ought to do as Ptholomeus did / that is to take Regyment
to kept them self after the seasons / and govern them by his rules and
techynges / the which he used in every quarter of the year for to live the
longer / wisely / and meryly.

The Regyme^t for Prymetyme / that is for to say March / Apryll / and May.
Cap^.ix.
IN prymetyme Ptholomeus kept him self metely well clothed / not over cold /
nor to hot / as with thyn vestures / dowbletes of sylke / and gowns metely
light furred with lamb most commonly. In this time is very good lettynge of
blood to avoid the cuyll humors that were gathered in the body the winter
time. If syckenes happen in Prymetyme it is not of his nature / but proceeds
of the humors gathered in the wyntes passed. Prymetyme is a temperat time to
take medycynes for them that been corporat and full of thycke humors / to purge
them. Also in this time men ought to ete light meets / that refressheth as
chekyns / kyddes with vergyous / borage / betes / yolks of eggs in moon
shine poched / roches / perches / pykerelles / and all scaled fysshe. Also to
drink temperate wine / bear / or ale / so that they be not to strong nor over
sweet / for in this time all sweet things ought not to be used: and a man
ought not to sleep long in the morning / and not on the day. The
Astronomyers have a general rule / or custom for all seasons / that avails
much against all infyrmytes and syckenesses: that is not to lose his appetyte
for etynge / and never for to ete without hunger. Also they say that all manner
flesh and fysshe is better roasted than soden / and if they be soden to broyle
on a grydeyron / or on the coals / and they ben the more holsomer.

The regyme^t for the time of Somer / that is June / July / and August. Ca.x.
THe Astronomyers in Somer ben clothed with light go wnes and syngle their
shyrtes and shetes / that they lie in ben lynnen / for of all the clothes it is
the coldest / they have dowblettes of sylke / or of canuas / and they ete light
metes / as chekyns with vergyous / young rabetes / lectuse / purslayne / melo^s
coucombres / peers / plu^mes / and such fysshes as are before named. And also
they ete of metes that refressheth / also they ete little and often / they
break their fast or dyne in the morenynge / or ever the Son^e arise / and go
to souper or it discende / and they ete of the abouesayd metes / and sour
sauce to give them an appetyte. They ete but little salt metes / and refayne
them from scratchynge / they drink many times fresshe water soden with
sugercandy: and also with other refressynge waters / and they do it always when
that they ben greatly thrysty / safe only at dinner and at souper time / for
than they drink feeble grene wine / or small ale / or syngle bear. And also
they keep them from over great travail / or over for sing of them self / for
in this time is no thyn ge more grievous / nor contageous than chaffynge. In
this time and season they do eschew the company of women / and they bath them
often i^ cold water to aswage the hete of their bodies enforced by labors.
Always they have with them sugre candy / or other sugre and dradges / whereof
they take little and often / and every day in the morenynge / they force them
by cowhynge and spyttynge to void fleumes: and void them above and byneth the
best that they may / and wasshe their hands with fresshe water / their vysage
and mouth.

The regyment for Harvest / is Septembre Octobre / and Nouembre. Cap^.xi.
BE it to understand in Harvest Astronomyers be clothed after the manner of
prymetyme / but their clothes ben a little warmer. And in this time they do
their dylygence to purge and cleanse them / and lettynge them blood to tempre
the humors of their bodies. For it is the most contagyous time of the year /
in the which peryllous infyrmytes happens and comes / and therefore they ete
good wholesome metes / as capons / hens / young pegyons that begin to fly /
and drink good wynes and other good and wholesome drynkes / without taking
excess. In this time they keep them from etynge of fruytes / for it is a
dangerous season for the axes / and they say that he had never axes that never
ete fruit. In this time they drink no water / and they put no part of them
in cold water / but their hands and their faces. They keep their heedes from
cold in the night and morenynge / and sleep not in the noone time: and keep
them from over great travail: and endure not to much hunger nor thyrste / but
ete when it is time / and not when their mawes be full.

The regyme^t for winter time / is Decembre / January / and February. Cap^.xii.
Moreover as Ptholomeus did the Astronomyers now does in winter clothe them in
thyeke go wnes of roughe clothe / hye shorn well furred with fox furre. For
it is the warmest furre that is and cattes / lambs / and diverse other thycke
furs that been good and wholesome. In the time of winter Astronomyers do ete
befe / porke / and brawne / hearts / hyndes / and all manner of venyson /
partryches / fesauntes / and fowls of the river / and other metes that they
love best. For that is the season of the year that nature suffers most great
plente of vytayle / for the natural hete that is drawn within the body. In
this time also they drink often strong wynes after their complexion / as
bastard wine / or osey. Two or three times in the weke they use good spyces in
their metes. For this is the most wholesome time of all the year / in the which
comes no syckenesse / but by great excesses and outrages done to nature / or
by cuyll gouernynge. Astronomyers say also that Prymetyme is hot and moist of
the nature of the air / complexion of the Sanguyne / and that in the same
time nature reioyseth / and the poores opens / and the blood spredeth through
the veins more than in any other time. Somer is hot and dry of the nature of
the fire / and of complexion coloryke. In the which time one ought to keep
him from all things that moves to heteall excess and hot metes. Harvest is
cold and dry of nature of earth / and complexion of mela^coly / In the
which time one ought to keep him from doing excess / more than in other
time for danger of syckenes / to the which that time is disposed. But winter
is cold and moist of the nature of water / and of complexion flumatyke /
than a man ought for to keep him metely warm / and meanly for to live in
health of body.

Here after follows the.iiii. elements / and the.iiii. complectione of man.
Cap^.xiii.
THese they ben Air / Fire / Earth / and water. The.xxiiii. hours of the day
and the night rules Sanguyne / Coloryke / Melancoly / and Flumatyke. Six
hours after mydnyght blood has the maystry / and in the vi. hours before
noone Color reygneth / and.vi. hours after noone reygneth Melancoly / and
the.vi. hours before mydnyght reygneth the Flumatyke.

Here follows the Astrology of Ptholomeus. Capitulo.xiii.
SO as Ptholomeus and also diverse other Astronomyers gives us knowledge of the
mouynges and propryetes of the Heuens: and diverse other things contained in
this present Co^post / the which is so that each other may compryse and know
as they do. First one ought to know what the Figure is / the disposycion of
the world / the nombre and order of the Elements / and the mouynges of the
skies / appertains to be known of every man of good and noble wit. For it
is a fair thing / delectable / profitable / and honest / and therewith it is
necessary for to have diverse other knowleges / and specially the Astrology of
Ptholomeus: which shows how the world is round as a balle. And after wise
men say that there is no thing so round as it is. For it is rounder than any
thing artyfyciall. Yet moreover in this world we se no thing nor never shall
/ that is so tuste and egally round as it self is / and is composed of the
heaven and the.iiii. Elements in.v. pryncypall parties. After that a man ought
to know that the earth is in the mids of the world / for it is the heuyest
element. And upon the earth is the water or the sea / but it coueryth not all
the earth / to the end that men and bestes may live therein / and the party that
is vncoueryd is called the face of the earth / for it is as the face of man
always vncoueryd / and the party that is coueryd with water is the body of
man that is clothed and hid. On the water is the air that encloseth the
earth and the water / and is divided in three Regyons / one is low whereas
enhabyteth beestes and birds / another is mean where as ben the clouds / the
which make the Impressions as lyghtnynges / thondres / and other / and is
always cold / and the third is the highest / where as is neither wind nor
rain / nor tempest / nor other impression / and there ben some mountains that
attayneth unto it: as is Olympus that rechyth the highest Regyon of the air /
and the element of fire mounteth unto the sky / and the elements sustayneth
the skies / as the pyllers or posts sustayneth a house. Of such mountains is
one in Affryke named Athlas. After that is the eleme^t of fire / that is
neither flambe nor coals / but is pure and inuysyble: for the great bryghtnes /
for of so much as the water is more clear and light than the earth / and the
air more clear and light than the water / of so much the fire is more clear /
light / and fayrer than the air: and the skies in equipolent ben more clerer /
lyghter / and fayrer than the fire / the which tourneth with the mouynges of
the heuens / and the next Regyon of the air also: in the which is engendered
comytes that been called sterres / for that they ben shynynge and moves as the
sterres. After the saying of Ptholomeus and other Astrologyens the fire is
inuysible for his subtylyte and not for his clerenes / for of as much as a
thing is more clear / of so much it is more visyble / for we se the skies well
/ but not the fire for it is ouermoche more subtyle than the air that is
inuysyble for the same cause / the earth and the water ben thycke / and
therefore they ben vysyble.

The skies ben neither properly heuye nor light / hard nor soft / clear nor
derke / hot nor cold / sweet nor sour / color nor son / nor such other
qualytes / saufe that they ben hot in virtue: for they may cause hete here
byneth by their lyghtnes / mouynges / and influences and ben improperly hard /
for they may not be divided nor broken. And also they ben improperly colors
of light in some parties / and ben thycke / as ben the parties of the sterres.
In the which there may no sterre / nor other party be adiusted and put to /
nor none may be demynysshed nor taken away / and they may neither increase
nor wax less / nor be of other figure than round / nor they may not change
/ enpayre / nor wax old / nor be corrumped nor altered / but in light only /
as in time of the eclyps of the Son and Moon: nor they may not rest and
stand still / nor turn only otherwise / later nor sooner / in party nor in
all / nor behave them otherwise than after their common course: but by miracle
deuyne: and therefore the sterres and skies ben of another nature / than the
elements and the things in them composed / the which ben transmutable and
corruptyble. The elements and all things of them composed / ben enclosed with
the first sky / as the yelke of an egg is enclosed within the white / and
the first sky is enclosed of the second / and the second in the third / and
the third in the fourth / and so of other. The first sky next the elements
is the sky of the Moon. And next it is the sky of Mercury. And next it the
sky of Venus. Than is the sky of the Son. And next that the sky of Mars.
Than is next the sky of Jupiter. And than next after that is the sky of
Saturn. And thus ben the skies of the planettes after their order. The eight
sky is of sterres fyxed / and they ben called so / for that they move more
regulerly and after one guyse than the planettes do. And than above that is the
first mobyle / in the which no thing apperyth that Astrologyens may se. There
ben some Astrologyens say that above these.ix. skies is one immobyle / for it
tourneth not / and above that is one of Crystal / over the which is the sky
Imperyall / in the which is the throne of god / of the which sky the
Astronymyers ought not to speak / but only of the first mobyle / and that it
contains altogyther called the world. Of one thing they marvel much /
that is how god has distrybuted the sterres / that he has put none in the
nynthe sky / and has put so many in the eight sky: that they may not be
nombred / and in each of the other.vii. but one only / as aforesaid of the
son / moon / and sterres: as euydently apperyth hereafter.

Here Ptholomeus shows more plainly of the four Clementes / and of the
symylytude of the earth / and how that every Planet is one above another / and
shows which of them ben masculyne / as these five Saturn / Jupiter / Mars /
Sol / and Mercury. And of.ii. femynyne: as Venus / and Luna / and which of
them is northly / and southly / and which ben oryentall / or occydentall.
Capitulo.xv.
SOme mouynges ben of the skies and planettes / that excedeth the
understanding of the Astrologyens as the mouynge of the fyrmament: in the
which ben the sterres against the first mobyle in an hundred year one degree /
and the mouynge of the planettes in their episcycles / of the which how well
that Astronomyers be not ygnoraunt of all / yet they make nomencyon here / for
it suffyseth them only of two / whereof the one is from oryent in to the
occydent above the earth / and from occydent in to the oryent under it / that is
called the dyurnall mouynge / that is to say that it makes from day to
day.xxiiii. hours / by the which mouynge the.ix. sky / that is the first
mobyle draws after / and makes the other skies to turn that been under it.
The other moment is of the.vii. Planettes / and is from occydent to oryent
above the earth: and from oryent in to the occydent under it / and is contrary
to the first / and ben the two mouynges that Astrologyens knowlegeth / and
how well that they ben opposytees / yet move they contynually / and ben
possible / as it is showed by ensample. If a ship on the sea came from oryent
in to occydent / and that he of his own mouynge went in the ship softely
toward oryent / this man should move a double mouynge whereof one should be of
the ship and of him self together: and the other should be of his own mouynge
that he makes softly to ward orynet. Semblably the planettes ben transported
with their sky from oryent in to occident by the dyurnall mouynge of the
first mobyle But later and other wise than the fyxed sterres / by that that
every planet has his propre mouynge contrary to the mouynge of sterres: For
the moon makes a course less in a month about the earth than a sterre fyxed
/ and the son a course less in a year: and the other planettes in certain
time each after the qua^tyte of his mouynge. Thus it apperyth that the
planettes move two mouynges. Ptholomeus says / pose by ymagynacion that all
the skies seized to move of the daily mouynge / the moon would make a course
in going from the occydent in to the oryent in as much time as lasts
now.xxvii. days / and.viii. hours / and Mercury / Venus / and Sol would make
in like manner course in the space of a year / and Mars in two year / and
Saturn in.xxx. year or theraboute. For now they make their course or
reuolucions: and accompsysshe their propre mouynges in the time here named. The
propre mouynge of planettes is not streyghte from occydent to oryent / but it
is a side way / and Astrologyens se them sensyble / For when they se the moon
before a sterre one night / the second / or the third night / it is behind
not streyghte toward oryent / but shall be drawn one time toward Septemtryon
/ and another time toward mydday / and this is because of the latytude or
largenes of the zodyake / in the which ben the.xii. signs / under whom the
planttes reygneth.

Of the equynocciall and zodyake: that been in the.ix. skies that contains the
fyrmament under it. Capitulo.xvi.
AS in the concaue of the first mobyle Ptholomeus and other Astrologyens
ymagyneth to be the.ii. cyrcles / and they ben there royal / the one is as
small as a little threde / and it is called equynocciall / and the other is
large in manner of a gyrdle or as a garlande of flowers / which they do call
the zodyake / and these two cyrcles deuydeth the one and the other equally but
not straight / for the zodyake crosses crokedly / and the places where it
croketh / ben said equynoccialles. For to understand the equynocciall / we
sesensybly all the sky turn from oryent in occydent / and it is called the
daily mouynge / or dyurnall mouynge / than ought one to ymagyn a streyghte line
that passes thorughe the mydle of the earth coming from the one end of the
sky to the other about the which line is made this mouynge / and the two ends
ben the two points in the sky that moves not / and ben called the poles of
the world / of the which poles / one is over us by the sterre of the north /
that always demonstreth him self and aperith to us / and is the pose artyke or
septemtryonall / and the other is under the earth always hyd called the pole
antertyke / or pole australl / in the mids of the which poles / in the
first mobyle / is the cyrcle equynocciall equally before in the party / as in
the other of the said poles / and after this cyrcle is made and mesured the
daily mouynge of.xxiiii. hours that is a natural day / and it is called
equynoccyall For that when the son is in it / that day and the night ben
equal thorughe the world. The large zodyake as said is in the first mobyle /
and also it is a gyrdle manerly fygured and set with images of signs
entrayled subtylly and well composed / and set with fyxed sterres / as
shynyng Carbuncles or p^ecyous Be^mes full of great virtue / set by maystryse
right nobly aourned: in the which zodyake ben.iiii. pryncypall points / that
deuydeth them equally in.iiii. parties. One is hye called the Solstyce of Somer
/ which when the son is entered in Cancer / it is the longest day of Somer.
Another is low called the Solstyce of winter: which is when the son is
entered in Caprycorne / than it is the shortest day of winter / and mean called
equynoccyall of Harvest / that the son enters in Libra in the month of
Septembre. And the other is called the equynoccyall of Prymetyme / that the
son enters in Aries in the month of March. The which.iiii. parties
deuydeth each in three egall parties / and makes.xii. parties / that been called
signs / as Aries / Taurus / Gemini / Cancer / Leo / Virgo / Libra / Scorpio /
Sagittarius / Capricornus / Aquarius / and Pisces. Aquarius begins in the
equynoccyall and crosses the zodyake / and when the son is there it
begins to declyne (that is to say) approchynge Septemtryon / and to ward us
it extends to the oryent. Than is Taurus second / Gemini the third / and so
of all the other. Also every sign is divided in.xxx. degrees: and be in the
zodyake.CCC.lx. degrees / and every degree divided by.lx. mynutes / every mynute
in lx. secondes / every second in.lx. thyrdes / and this partycion and
deuysyon suffyseth to be understand of Astronomyers.

Here after follows a very subtle varyacion in the sky. Capitulo.xvii.
THe Astronomyers do knowledge a very subtle varyacyon in the sky / and is for
the sterres fyxed be not under the same degrees of the zodyake that were
created because of the mouynge of the fyrmament / the which ben against the
first mobyle in a.C. year of one degree / for the which mutacyon the son
may have other regard to a sterre / and other sygnyficacion than it had in
the time passed / and also when that books were made / for that the sterre has
changed his degree or sign under which it was. And this often times causes
them that make Pronostycacions and Iugeme^tes coming to fail. All the cyrcles
of the sky ben narowe and small / except the zodyake / which is large / and
contains in length.CCC.lx. degrees / and of largeness.xii. the which
largeness is divided by the mids.vi. degrees on that one sign / and.vi. on
the other: and this dyuysion is made by a line named Eclyptyke / is the way of
the son / for the son never departs under that line / and thus it is
always in the mydle of the zodyake / but the other planettes ben always on the
one side / or on the other of the said line / saufe when they ben in the heed
or in the tail of the Dragon / as the moon passes twyse in a month / and if
it happen when that it renews it is Eclypse of the son / and if it happen
in the full moon and that it be right under the nadyr of the son^e it is
general eclypse / and if it be but a party it is not seen. when it is eclypse
of the son / it is not general thorugh all the clymates but only in some /
but when it is eclypse of the moon / it is general over all.

Of.ii. great cyrcles / that is to say one merydyen / and the other ozyron that
intersequeth one the other / and crosses dyrectly. Capitulo.xviii.
MEridyen is a great cyrcle ymagyned on the sky / which passes by the poles
of the world: and by the point of the sky right over our heedes / which is
called zenych / and when the son^e is comen over from the orye^t unto that
cyrcle it is mydday / and therefore it is called merydyen / and the half of the
cyrcle is over the earth / and the other under it that passes by the point of
mydnyght dyrectly opposite to zenych / and when the son touches that part
of the cyrcle it is mydnygth / and if a man go to ward oryent or occydent he
has new merydyen / and therefore it is sooner mydday to them that be to ward
oryent than to other / if a man stand still / his merydyen is one still: or if
he go to ward mydday or Septemtryon / but if he styre he has other zenych /
and these two cyrcles crosses directly. Ozyron is a great cyrcle that deuydeth
the party of the sky that we se from that we se not: and Ptholomeus says if
that a man were in a plain country he should se Justly half of the sky / the
which is called the Emyspery (that is to say) half espere and ozyron is
ioynynge nyghe to the earth / of the which ozyron the enter is the mydle / and
is the place in which we ben / thus each is always in the mids of his
ozyron / and zenyche is the pole / and as a man transporteth him from one place
to another / he is in the other places against the sky / and has other
zenyche and other ozyron / all ozyron is right or oblyke. They have right
ozyron that habyteth under the equynoccyall / and have their zenyche in the
equynoccyall / for their ozyron intersequeth and deuydeth the equynoccyall even
by the two poles of the world / that in such wise that none of the poles of
the world is raised above their ozyron / nor depryued under it / but they that
habyteth other where than under the equynoccyall have their ozyron oblyke / for
their ozyron follows and deuydeth the equynoccyall sydewaye / and not right /
and there apperyth to them of al times one of the poles of the world raised
above their ozyron / and the other ben over hid / so that they se them not /
more or less after diverse habytacions / and after that they ben of fernes from
the equynoccyall / and the more that the one pole is raised the more is the
ozyron oblyke / and the other pole depryued / and it is to wete that there is
as much dystaunce from the ozyron to the pole: as it is from the zenyche to
the equynoccyall / and that zenych is the fourth party of merydyen or the
mids of the bow dyurnall / of the which the two ends ben on the ozyron.
And also that of the pole unto the equynoccyall is the fourth party of all the
roundnes of the skies / and also of the merydyen cyrcle sithe that it passes
by the poles and crosses the equynoccyall dyrectly. Example of the ozyron of
Paris after the opinion of Ptholomeus and other Astronomyers / over the which
ozyron they say that the pole is raised.xlix. degrees: wherefore they say also
that from the zenych of Paris unto the equynoccyall ben.xlix. degrees / and
that from the ozyron unto the zenych / which is the.iiii. party of the
merydyen cycle ben.lxxxx. degrees / and from the pole unto the solstyce of
Somer ben.lvii. degrees / and from the solstyce unto the equynoccyall
ben.xxxiii. degrees / there ben from the pole unto the equynoccyal lxxxx.
degrees / and is the fourth party of the roundenes of the sky / from the
equynoccyall unto the solstyce of winter ben.xxxiii. degrees / and from the
solstyce unto the ozyron.xviii. Thus shall the equynoccyall ben raised over the
ozyron.xli. degrees / and the solstyce of somer.lxiiii. degrees: in the which
solstyce is the son at the hour of noone the lo^gest day of somer: And than
it enters in to the sign of Cancer / and is most nerer our habytable pertyes
that may be. And when the son is in the solstyce of winter the shortest day
of the year at the hour of noon it enters i^ to the sign of Capricorn. And
the said solstyce is not raised over the ozyron of Paris but.viii. degrees. The
which cleuacyons and rysynges a man may find plainly / so that he knew one
only / and in every regyon in like wise after the sytuacion.

Also hereafter do follow two other great cyrcles of the sky / and four
small. Ca.xix.
ON the sky ben two great cyrcles named colors / that deuydeth the skies in
four egall parties / and crosses their self dyrectly / and the one passes
by the poles of the world / and by the two solstyces / and the other by the
poles also / and by the two equynoccyalles. The first small cyrcle is called
the cyrcle artyke because of the pole zodyake about the pole artyke / and his
lykenes is to his opposyte / named the cyrcle antertyke. The other two ben
named tropykes / the one of somer / and the other of winter. The tropyke of
somer is cause of the solstyce of somer beginning of the sign of Cancer: and
the tropyke of the solstyce of winter beginning of the sign of Caprycorne /
and ben egally dystau^ce one cyrcle from the other. Here ought to be noted that
the dystau^ces of the pole artyke to the cyrcle artyke / and the dystau^ce of
the tropyke of somer to the equynoccyall / and that of the equynoccyall to the
tropyke of winter: and from the cyrcle antertyke to the pole antertyke ben
just egall each of.xxiii. degrees and a half or there about / than the
dystau^ce from the equynoccyall to the tropyke of somer / and from the cyrcle
artyke to the pole make together.xlvii. degrees. The which take away of the
quarter between the pole and the equynoccyall / where as ben.lxxxx. degrees /
save that there abides.xliii. That been the dystau^ce between the tropyke of
winter and the cyrcle antertyke / and these cyrcles ben said little for they
ben not so great as the other ben / Nevertheless they ben divided each by.CCC.
and.lx. degrees / as the greatest.

Of the rysynge and resconsynge of the signs in the ozyron. Capitulo.xx.
OZyron an emyspery dyfferred: for ozyron is the cyrcle that deuydeth the
party of the sky / that we se / from the under the earth that we se not. Also
ozyron is the cyrcle that moves not / but as we move from one place to
another: but emyspery tourneth contynually / for one party ryseth and mounteth
over ozyron / and the other part resconseth and enters under it / thus ozyron
ryseth nor resconseth: but that that comes above ryseth and that which goth
under resconseth / merydyen also ryseth not nor resconseth. Equynoccyall is the
dyurnall cyrcle that ryseth and resconseth reguler: as much in one hour as in
another / and all in.xxiiii: hours: zodyake the large cyrcle and oblyke /
whereon the signs ben reyseth and resconseth all on a day natural / but not
reguler: for it ryseth more in one hour than in another / for that our ozyron
is oblyke and deuydeth the zodyake in two parties: whereof one is ever over our
ozyron / and the other underneath. Thus half of the signs ryseth over our
ozyron every day artyfyciall / be it short or long / and the other half by
night / wherefore it behooves that in the days that been shorter than the
night the signs ryseth sooner / and in long days more at leyser / and thus
the zodyake ryseth not regulerly in these parties as the equynocciall / But
there is dowble varyacion for half of the zodyake that is from the first
begyn^ynge of Aries unto the last end of Virgo / all together takes equally
as much time in risynge / as half of the equynocciall the which remains by
it / and they do begin to rise in a moment: and also they fynysshe and make
their end in a moment. But this half of the zodyake ryseth sooner in the
beginning / and this half of the equynoccyall more at leyser / and this is
called their oblyquement. Also the other half of the zodyake / that is from
the beginning of Libra unto the end of Pisces / and half of the equynocciall
that by it begins / and also it leueth to rise equally together / but the
equynocciall in that party in the beginning ryseth sooner / and the zodyake
more at leyser / and this is called rysynge dyrectly. And which that ryseth
sooner the equynoccyall or the zodyake / yet always they end to gyther.
Example of the two mouynges aforesaid / as if two men went from London to
wyndsore and departed both together / and that at the beginning the one go
fast / and the other softely / he that gothe fast should be sooner in the mydwaye
than the other / but if he that went fast to the mydway go softely / and the
other fast / they shall be both at ones in wyndsore. Also the half of the
zodyake: from the beginning of Cancer / unto the end of Sagittary in rysynge
beryth more than half the equynoccyall / so that this half ryseth all right /
and the other half of the zodyake ryseth contrarywyse / or crooked.

Of the deuysyons of the earth / and of the regyons. Capitulo.xxi.
BEfore or we spear of the sterres and knowledge that Ptholomeus and other
Astronomyers have / we will speak of the deuysyon of the earth / and of his
parties after their opinion. wherefore it is to be noted that the earth is
round / and therefore as a man go the from one country to another / he has
other ozyron than he had / and there apperyth another party of the sky / and
if a man went from septemtryon that is the North parties streyghte toward
mydday / the South parties the pole artyke to him shall be less raised / that
is to say more nyghe approchynge to the earth: and if he went contrary wise it
should be more raised / that is to say apperynge higher / and therefore if he
went toward mydday under merydyen while that the pole artyke were less raised
over his ozyon by the.xxx. part of one of the.vi. part of the arc merydyen:
he should pass the.xxx. parts of half of the cyrcuyte of the earth / and to
him the pole should be less raised by one degree / or to the contrary till it
were more raised of one degree / than he should pass one degree of the cyrcuyte
of the earth / of the which all the degrees together ben.CCC.lx. And one degree
of the earth co^tayneth.xliii.leges and a half or there about / and every
legeis.ii. mile. And as the spear of the sky is divided by the.iiii.less
cyrcles in the.v. parts called zones / so the earth is divided in to.v.
regyons. The first is between the pole artyke and the cyrcle artyke. The.ii.is
between the cyrcle artyke and the tropyke of somer. The.iii.is between the
tropyke of somer / and the tropyke of winter. The.iiii.is between the tropyke
of winter / and the cyrcle antertyke. The.v. between the cyrcle antertyke and
the pole antertyke. Of the which parties of the earth / some Astronymyers say
that the first and the.v. ben inhabytable / for their over great coldenes /
for they ben to far from the son. The third that is in the mydle is to
nere under the way of the son / and is not inhabytable for the great hete.
The other.ii. parties / the second and the fourth be not to nere nor to far
from the son / but ben moderate in hete and cold / and therefore they ben
habytable if there be none other lettynge / and suppose that it be true / yet
it is not possible to pass ouerth warte the Regyon under the way of the son
called zone / turned, to go from the second to the fourth / for some
Astronomyers would have passed / that would have showed of it / wherefore they
say that there is no Regyon habyted / but the second wherein we and all the
other ben also.

Of the varyacion that is for diverse habytacions and regyons of the earth.
Cap^.xxii.
PTholomeus and other Astronomyers say / that if it were possible that the
earth were enhabyted all about and pose the case that it were so / first they
that enhabyte under the equynoccyall / have always the days and the nyghtes
egall / and have the two poles of the world at the two corners of their ozyron
/ and may se all the sterres when they se the two poles / and the son^e passes
twyse in a year over them / that is when it passes by the equynoccyalles. Thus
the son is to them the one half of the year toward the pole artyke / and
the other half toward the other pole / and therefore they have two wynters in
a year without great cold / one is when we have winter / and the other when we
have somer. Semblably they have two summers / one is in March when we have
prymetyme / and the other in Septembre when we have Harvest / and by this they
have four Solstyces / two hye when the son passes by their zenyche / and
two low when it declyneth one way or other / and thus they have four
shadows in a year / for when the son is in the equynocces twyse in one year
in the morning their shadows ben in the occydent: and at night in the oryent
/ and than at noone they have no shadows / but when the son^e is in the signs
Septemtryonalles / and so agaynewarde. Secondely they that enhabyte between the
equynoccyal and the tropyke of so mer / have in likewise two summers and two
wynters / and four shadows in a year / and they have no dyfference of the
first / save that they have longer days in somer / and shorter in winter /
for as the equynoccyall lengeth / in likewise does the days of somer / and in
the party of the earth is the first clymate and almost half the second /
and is called Araby wherein is Ethyope. Thirdely they that enhabyte under the
tropyke of somer have the son over their hedes / and the day of Solstyce of
somer at noone / they have their shadows smaller than we have / and there is a
party of Ethyope. Fourthly they that been between the tropyke of somer and the
cyrcle artyke / have longer days in somer than the aforesaid / in as much as
they ben ferther from the equynoccyall / and shorter in winter / and they never
have the son over their hedes / nor toward septemtryon / and that party of
the earth we enhabyte. Fyfthly they that enhabyte under the cyrcle artyke have
the eclyptyke of the zodyake to their ozyron / and when the son is in the
Solstyce of somer it resconseth not: and thus they have no night / but
natural days of.xxiiii. hours. Semblably when the son^e is in the Solstyce
of winter it is natural day when they have contynuall night / and that the
son^e ryseth not to them. Syxtly they that been between the cyrcle artyke and
the pole artyke have in somer diverse natural days that been to them one day
artyfyciall without night. And also in winter ben many natural days: the
which natural days ben to them always night / and the more that it
approaches or draws nere the pole / the more is the artyfyciall day of somer
long / and dureth in some place a weke: in some a month / in some two in some
three / and in some more / and proporcyonally the night is greater / for some of
the signs ben ever on their ozyron / and some always under / and as long as
the son^e is in the signs about it is day / and while it is underneath it is
night. Seventhly they that enhabyte under the pole have the son^e half of the
year on their ozyron / and have contynuall day / and the other half of the
year contynuall night / and the equynoccyall is their ozyron that deuydeth the
signs.vi. above / and.vi. byneth wherefore when the son^e is in the signs that been hye / and toward them they have contynuall day. And when it is in the
signs toward mydday they have contynuall night: and thus in a year they have
but one day and one night. And as it is said of the party of the earth
toward the pole artyke a man may understand of the other half and of the
habytactons toward the pole antertyke.

Of the deuysyon of the earth / and only of the part enhabyted.
Capitulo.xxiii.
SO as Ptholomeus and diverse other deuyden the earth habytable in.vii. parties /
that they call Clymates and the dyamerous. The.ii. clymate dyatyens. The.iii.
dalyxandrye. The.iiii. dyarhodes. The.v. dyaromes. The.vi. daboristines. And
the.vii. dyaripheos / of the which each has his longytude determined / and
the latytude also / and nerer they ben to the equynocciall the longer they ben
/ and larger / and proceed in longytude from oryent to occydent and in latytude
from mydday to septemtryon. The first clymate after some Astronomyers
conteyneth in length half of the cyrcuyte of the earth / that is two hondreth
thousand / and four hondreth mile / and it has an hondreth thousand / and
two hondreth miles of length. The. second / and so of the other / for the
lessynge of the earth coming toward septemtryon. To understand what a clymate
is after the saying of Astronomyers. A clymate is a space of the earth egally
large / where of the length is from oryent to occydent / and the bredthe is
coming from mydday and from the earth enhabytable toward the equynoccyall
drawing to septemtryon / as much as an horologe or clock changes not. For
in earth habytable the clockes changes.vii. times in the bredthe of the
clymates / it is of necessyte to say that they ben.vii. and where the varyacion
of horologes is / there is the dyuersyte of clymates / how be it that such
varyacyon properly ought to be taken in the mids of the clymates / and not
at the beginning nor in the end / for the nerenesse and co^uenaunce the one of
the other. Also one clymate has always a day artyfycyall of somer / shorter
or longer than another clymate / and this day shows the dyfference in the
mids of every clymate / better than in the mids and at the end / the
which thing we may sensybly know at iye: and thereby Judge the dyfference of
the clymates. And it is to be noted that under the equynoccyall the days and
the nyghtes in all times are egall each of.xii. hours / but coming toward
septemtrion the days of somer longs / and the winter days shorteth / and
the more that one approaches septemtryon / the more waxes the days in such
wise that at the end of the last clymate the days in somer ben longer by
three hours and an half / than they ben at the beginning of the first: and
the pole is more raised by.xxxviii. degrees. At the beginning of the first
clymate the lo^gest day of somer has.xii. hours and.xlv. mynutes / and the
pole is raised on the ozyron.xii. degrees and.xlv. mynutes / and in the mids
of the clymate the longest day has.xiii. hours / and the pole raised.xvi.
degrees / and the latytude dureth unto the longest day of somer / that
is.xiii. hours and.xv. mynutes: and the pole raised.xx. degrees and an half /
the which largenes is.CCCC.xl. mile of earth. The second clymate begins at
the end of the first / and the mids is there as the day has.xiii. hours
and an half / and the pole is raised over the ozyron.xxiiii. degrees / and.xv.
mynutes. And the latytude dureth unto there as the longest day has.xiii.
hours / and.xlv. mynutes / and the pole is raised xxvii. degrees / and an
half / and this largenes conteyneth of earth.CCCC. miles Just. The.iii.
clymate begins at the end of the second and the mids is there as the
day has xiii. hours / and the pole is raised.xxx. degrees / and.xlv. mynutes
/ and the latytude extends unto there as the longest day has.xiiii. hours
/ and.xv. mynutes / and the pole is raised.xxiii. degrees / and.xl. mynutis.
The.iiii. clymate beginning at the end of the third / and the mids is
there as the longest day has.xiiii. hours and an half / and the pole is
raised.xxvi. degrees / and.xx. mynutes / the latytude dureth unto there as the
longest day has.xiii. hours / and.xlv. mynutes / and the pole is raised.xxx.
degrees / and the largenes conteyneth of earth.CCC. mile. The.v. clymate
begins at the end of the fourth: and the mids is there as the longest
day has.xv. hours / and the pole is raised.xli. degrees / and.xx. mynutes /
and the latytude dureth unto there as the longest day has.xv. hours / and.xv.
mynutes / and the pole is raised.xliii. degrees and an half / and the largenes
conteyneth of earth.CC.lii. miles. The.vi. clymate begins at the end of the
fyfthe / and the mids is there as the longest day has.xv. hours and an

The great and meruaylous consyderacyons and great understanding of the
Astronomyers / and Astrologyens. Cap^.xxiiii.
AFter the length of the clymates / so if case were one might go about the
earth from oryent to occydent to his first place: some Astronomyers say that
this compass may almost be made. Saying that if a man went this compass
in.xii. natural days going regulerly to ward occydent / and began now at
mydday / he should pass euerydaye natural the.xii. part of the cyrcuyte of
the earth / and ben.xxx. degrees / whereof behooves that the son make a course
about the earth and.xxx. degrees ferther / or he be returned on the morrow at
the merydyen of the said man / and so the said man should have his day and
night of.xxvi. hours / and should be ferther by the.xii. part of a natural
day than if he rested him / wherefore it follows of necessyte that in.xii.
natural days / the said man should only have but a.xi. days / and a.xi.
nyghtes / and somewhat less / and that the son^e should light him but a.xi.
times: and resconse a.xi. times / for a.xi. days / and a.xi. nyghtes every
day and night of.xxvi. hours makes.xii. natural days / every day
of.xxiiii. hours. By semblable co^sideracion behooves that another man that
should make this course going toward oryent have his day and night shorter
than a natural day by two hours / than his day and night should be but
of.xii. hours. Than if he made this course in like space / that is to say
in.xii. days and somewhat more. Thus if Johan made course toward occydent /
and Peter toward oryent / and that Robert abode them in the place from whense
they departed the one as soon as the other / and that they met at Robert
both together. Peter would say that he had.ii. days / and.ii. nyghtes more
than Johan / and Robert that has rested a day less than Peter / and a day
more than Johan / how well that they have made this course in.xii. natural
days or an.C. or in.x. year / all is one. This is a pleasant consyderacion
among Astronomyers how Johan and Peter comes in one self day / put case it
were on a sunday. Johan would say it is saturday. Peter would say it is monday
/ and Robert would say it is sunday.

Of the Pomell of the skies a sterre called the sterre of the north / nere the
which is the pole artyke called septemtryonall. Capitulo.xxv.
HEre will we speak after the abouesayd things / of some sterres in
pertyculer. And first of them that Ptholomeus and other Astronomyers names
the Pomell of the skies / or sterre of the north / wherefore we ought to know
that we se by reason the sky turn from oryent to occydent / by the dyurnall
or the daily mouynge / that is of the first mobyle / the which is made on two
points opposytes that been the poles of the sky / of the which two points /
we do se one vysybly / and it is the poleartyke / and the other we se not /
that is the pole antertyke or in mydday / which is always hid under the earth.
By the pole artyke that we se is the sterre most approached that Astronomyers
call the pomell of the sky / the which they say is the highest and most
far from us / and by the which they have the knowledge that they have of the
other sterres and parties of the sky. The sterres that been by the said pomell
go never under the earth / of the which ben the sterres that makes the charyot
/ and diverse other / but they that been far from it / gothe sometime under the
earth as the son / the moon and other planettes. Under this pomell dyrectly
is the angle of the earth / in the place where against the son is at the
hour of mydde night.

Of Andromeda a sterre fyxed. Capitulo.xxvi.
Aries is a sign hot and dry / that governs the head and the face of man /
and the regyons / Babylone / Percy / and Araby. And sygnyfyeth small trees /
and under him at the.xvi. degree / ryseth a sterre fyxed called Andromeda: that
Astronomyers fygureth a maiden in her here upon the brynke of the sea / set
to be devoured of the monstres of the sea / but Perseus sone of Jupiter fought
with his sword against the said monstre and flewe it / and than the said
Andromeda was delyueryd. They that been borne under her co^stellacion ben in
danger of prison / or to dye in prison / but if a good Planet take regard
they escape not death and prison. Aries is the exaltacion of the son at
the.xix. degree: and Aries is the house of Mars with Scorpio / wherein he is
most.

Of Perseus a sterre fyxed / lord of the spear. Cap^.xxvii.
TAurus has the trees / plants / and ympes and gonerneth the neck and the
throat bolle of man / the regyons Ethyopy / Egypt / and the country about /
and under the.xxii. degree ryseth a sterre fyxed of the first magnytude that
Astronomyers call Perseus sone of Jupiter that smote of the heed of Meduse that
made all them to dye that beheld her / and by no manner they might eschew it.
Ptholomeus and other Astronomyers say that when Mars is conjoined with this
sterre. They that been borne under the constellacyon shall have their heedes
smyten of / if god shape not remedy: and sometime they call this sterre lord of
the sword / and figure him a man naked with a sword in one hand / and in the
other the heed of Meduse and looks not on it. And this sign Taurus is the
exaltacion of the moon in the third degree.

Of Ozyron a sterre fyxed / and the felawes. Capitulo.xxviii.
GEmini sygnyfyeth large / good courage / wit / beauty / clergy / and
governs of man the sholdres / arms / and hands / and the regyons Ynde /

or.xv. degree ryseth a sterre fyxed named Nebuluse or tail of the Lion / and
in Septemtryonall latytude of the said sign of virgo. Under the which sign
ryseth another fyxed sterre / which Astronomyers call the golden cup / and
is in the.xiii. degree of the said sign toward the party merydyonall. The
which sterre is of the nature of Venus and of Mercury: and sygnyfyeth that
they / which ben borne under the said constellacion to know of things worthy
/ good / and holy.

Of the Porke espyke a sterre fyxed. Capitulo.xxxii.
LIbra that under this sign domyneth the great trees / and sygnyfyeth Justice
and of man it governs the reins / and the nether part of the belly / And
regyons the country of Romany and of Greece. Under the xviii. degree ryseth a
sterre fyxed that Astronomyers call Porke espyke. They that been borne under
the constellacyon ben well shapen / and ben honest / and do things that folk
marvel on / and reioyseth / and sygnyfyeth riches by honest and precious
marchaundyse and ben commonly loved of lords and ladies and Libra is one of the
houses of Venus / and Taurus is the other / in the which she reioyseth most.
And is the exaltacion of Saturn For the wether begins to wax cold in this
monthe of Septembre / and Saturn is the planet and the lord of cold that
exalts in great heyghte / when that he enters in to the sign of Libra.

Of the Crown septemtryonall a sterre fyxed. Capitulo.xxxiii.
SCorpio that domyneth the trees that been of longytude and largenes / and

the regyons of Heberget: and the field of Araby in the.ii. degree ryseth a
sterre / that Astronomyers call the Crown septemtryonal / the which when it
is in the ascendynge in the mids of the sky gives honor and exaltacyon to
them that been borne under the constellacyon / and specially when it is well
beholden of Sol / the Scorpion is one of the houses of Mars / in the which he
reioyseth most / and Aries is the other / and is the Sign wherein Mars
begins to descend or fall from his exaltacyon.

Of the Scorpyons heart a sterre fyxed. Capitulo.xxxiiii.
SAgittary sygnyfieth the man ingenyous and wise / and governs the thyghes of
man / And regyons Ethyope Maharobem / and Aenyche. Under his first degree
ryseth a sterre fxyed of the first magnytude / the which Astronomyers call the
Scorpyons heart / which when it is well beholden of Jupiter or Venus / it
reyseth them that been borne under his constellacion to great honor and
richesse / but when it is evil beholden of Saturn or of Mars / it puts them
that been borne under it to pouerte / the Scorpyon is the house of Jupiter / in
the which he reioyseth most / and Pisces is the other house: and so is he
said Sagittary / the exaltacion of the dragons tayse.

sterre be in the mids of the sky in the descendynge / and Pisces is one of
the houses of Jupiter / and Sagittarius the other / in the which he reioyseth
most / and the said Pisces in the.xxvii. degree is the exaltacyon of Venus.

Of the deuysyon of the twelve houses / as well in the earth as in the heuens /
as hereafter do follow. Cap^.xxxviii.
IT is to understand that the Heuens and the earth is divided in.iiii. parties
by.ii. cyrcles: which crossets, dyrectly over the two poles / and
crosses.iiii. times the equynoccyal line. Each of the.iiii. parties divided
in.iii. egally / is in all twelve egall parts / as well in the sky as in the
earth / which Ptholomeus and other call howses / and ben.xii. Of which.vi.
ben always above the earth And.vi.under it: and these houses move not but ben
always each in his place / and the signs and Planettes pass by them always
ones in.xxiiii. hours. Three of these howses ben from oryent to mydnyght going
under the earth / The first / the second / and the third / whereof the first
under the earth begins in oryent / named the house of life. The second
house is named of substance and riches. The third that finyssheth at mydnyght
is the house of fraternity. The fourth that begins at mydnyght coming in
occydent / is named the house of patrimony. The fyfte is the house of sons.
The syxte fynyssheth in occydent / under the earth is the house of syckenes.
The seventh begins in occydent on the earth / and stretches toward mydday
/ is the house of marriage. The eight is the house of death. The nynthe
fynysshyng at mydday is named the house of feyth / of relygyon / and
pylgrymag^. The tenthe begins at mydday coming toward oryent / is the
house of honor and of regalyte. The enleuenth is the very house of true
friends. And the twelthe that fynyssheth in oryent on the earth / is called the
house of charity / but this matter is dyffycyle / for Astronomyers knowlegynge
the nature and propryte of every of the said.xii. houses / and departs them
lightly.

How the Planettes reygne in eury hour of the day and the night. Cap^.xxxix.
HE that will wete how Astronomyers knows which Planet reygneth every hour
of the day and the night / and which planet is good / and which is badde / he
ought first to know the planet of the day: and for to search therefore. The
first temporal hour of the son rysynge / that day is for the said planet.
The second hour is for the planet ensuyng And the third for the other / and
so following by order / and it behooves to goo from Sol to Venus / Mercury and
Luna / than come again to Saturn unto.xii. that is the hour before the son
going down / and in contynent after the son is down / begins the first
hour of the night: that is for the.viii. planet: and the second hour of the
night for the.xiiii. and so unto.xii. hours for the night / that is the next
hour before the son rysynge / and come dyrectly falling upon the.xxiiii.
planet / that is next before that the day following. And thus the day has.xii.
hours / and the night.xii. also / the which ben temporal hours / dyfferent
to the hours of the clockes / the which ben artyfycyalles. Ptholomeus and
other Astronomers say that Saturn and Mars ben evil planettes / Jupiter and
Venus good / Sol and Luna half good / and half evil. The party to ward the
good planet is good and the party to ward the evil planette is naught.
Mercury conjoined with a good planet is good / and with an evil planette he is
naught / and they understand this as the influences good or evil / that been
of the said planettes here following. The hours of the planettes ben dyfferent
to them of clockes: for the hours of clockes ben egall at all times / each
of.lx. mynutes / but they of the planettes when the days and the nyghtes ben
egall that the son is in one of the equynocces they ben egall / But as soon
as the days longs or shorteth / so does the natural hours / by this it is
conuenyent always for the day to have.xii. temporal hours / and the
night.xii. also: and when the days ben long / and the hours long: and when
the days ben short and the hours short / in likewise is the night / and
nevertheless an hour of the day / and an hour of the night together have.vi.
score mynutes / as many as two hours artyfycyalles / for that the one leueth /
the other takes. And take we our planettes / from the son rysynge unto the
son^e going down: and not before and all the remenaunt is night.

An example of this aforesaid.
IN decembre the days have but viii. hours artyfycialles of clockes / and
they have.xii. temporalles / let the.viii. hours artyfycialles ben divided
in.xii. egall parties / and it shall be.xii. times.xl. mynutes / and every party
shall be a temporal hour / that shall be of.xl. mynutes and no mo. Thus in
Decembre the temporal hours of the day have but.xl. mynutes / but the hours
of the night have.lxxx. For in that time the nyghtes have.xvi. hours
artyfycyalles / the which divided in.xii. parties / ben.lxxx. mynutes for
every temporal hour. Thus the hour of the nyghtes in Decembre have.lxxx.
mynutes and.xl. For an hour of the day is.vi. score mynutes in two temporal
hours / as many as in two hours artyfycyalles / that been each of.xl. mynutes
in June is the contrary: in March and in Septembre al hours ben egall / as
the days ben in other months by egall porcyon.

with every planette here before named ben the signs / which ben the houses
of the said planettes / as it is beforesayd. Capricornus and Aquarius ben the
houses of Saturn. Sagit tarius and Pisces / of Jupiter. Scorpius and Aries of
Mars. Leo of Sol. Taurus and Libra of Venus. Gemini of Mercury. And Cancer of
Luna / with other sygnyfycacions that would be long to recounte.

Also hereafter follows the Natures of the.vii. Planettes / with their
dysposycyons / after the saying of Ptholomeus / prince of Astronomy. Cap^.xl.
The first planet is Saturn.
Saturn is the highest Planet of all the.vii. he is mighty of him self: he
gives all the great coldes and waters / yet he is dry and cold of nature /
and he comes in to Cancer: and his chief signs ben Aquarius and Capricornus:
and he compasses all the other planettes. For Saturn is next under the first
mobyle that is under the crystal sky / the which mobyle moves meruaylously
/ for some Astronomyers say / that he causes by his mouynge all other
planettes to move / and moves the mobyle above. Saturn is so hye that
Astronomyers can not well mesure it. For so hye reason has power and no
ferther / and therefore it is more than.xxx. year or he may run his course.
when he does reygne / there is much theft used / and little charity / much
lyinge / and much lawynge one against another / and and great prysonynge / and
much debate / and great swerynge. And much plente of corn / and also much
plente of hogs / and great travail on the earth / and old folk shall be
very syckely: and many dyseases shall reygne among the people / and specially
in the chief hours of Saturn / And therefore this planet is lykened unto age /
as hard / hungry / suspecyous / and covetous / that seldom is content with any
thing / for Saturn is ennemy to all things / that grow and bear life of
natuer / for the cold and stormy bytternes of his time.

The proprytes of Saturn.
THe man that is borne under Saturn shall be false / enuyous / and full of
debate / and full of law / and he shall be cunning in coryenge of lether / and
a great eter of bread and flesh / and he shall have a stynkynge breath: and he
shall be heavy / thoughtfull and malycyous / a robber / a fyghter / and full of
covetous / and yet he shall keep well counceyle / and be wise in counceylynge /
and he shall love to sin wylfully / he shall be a great speker of tales /
Iustes / and Chronicles / and shall have little iyen / black here / great lyppes
/ broad sholdres / and shall look downewarde. He shall not love Sermons / nor
go to the church / and beware of his hands: and he beholds the mylte / and
above his neres the planet does reygne. And the children of the said Saturn
shall be great Iangelers and chyders / black and lene in the face / thyn
berded / evil languaged / and shall be full of law and vengeance And they
will never forgive till they be revenged of their quarrel / and like as the
planet Saturn is cold / and causer of great frostes and snowes / semblably he
that is borne under him shall be cold in charity / and not mysericordyous and
merciful / but vengeable / and will never be entreated. And also they shall be
great cursers / and bear malice long in their minds and not forgive it / and
they look to be obeyed and to have great reverence: and commonly will praise
them self and talk to them self / and laughe at their own conceyte / and
all evil shall grow in them / and above all colors he shall love black
color best. The planet of Saturn governs of man the mylte / and above the
neres as is beforesayd / and this planet is cause of hasty death / for because
that he is dry and cold of nature / And therefore he is lykened to melancoly.
And the said Saturn reygneth in Aquary / Caprycorne / and Cancer / but
specially in Aquary and Caprycorne.

Secondely of the noble Planet Jupiter.
IVpiter the noble Planet is very pure and clear of nature / and not very hot
/ but he is all virtuous. And there is fyxed in Jupiter two noble Signs of
love / the one is Pisces / and the other is Sagittary: signs of none evil /
nor of none vnhapynes / this planet may not do none evil / he is best of all
the other / he keeps the liver of man: and mayntayneth it ioyously / and
evermore this planet does always good and none evil / and with in.xii. year
or there about / he passes all the.xii. signs. And he is next after Saturn.

The proprytes of Jupiter
HE that is borne under him shall love clenlynes of body / and will not use to
speak of rybaudry / and harlottry / he shall ever love relygyon / and virtuous
living / he shall be personable of body / he shall be perfyte in all manner of
measures both large and long / he shall be white in the vysage / meddled with
a little rednes / large brows / he shall be a fair speker / and say well
behind a person / he shall love grene color and graye / he shall be happy
in marchaundyse / and have plente of gold and silver / and he shall love to
sing and to be honestly merry. And of the man he governs the stomach and the
arms.

Thyrdly of Mars.
MArs is called the god of battle and of war / and he is the third planet /
for he reygneth next under the gentle planet of Jupiter. This planet Mars is
the worste of all other / for he is hot and dry / and styreth a man to be
very wylful and stasty lightly / and to unhappiness / one of his signs is Aries
/ and the other Scorpio / and most he is in those two signs. He causes all
wartes and bataylles / this planet styreth men to bear wepons / as murderers /
daggers / swerdes / bylles / or bows / or some other wepon of death / and
would ever here of fighting. Therefore let every man be ware of the days of
Mars / and in his chief hours that no man fight / for without doubt if god
help him not / he shall be maimed or slain. Also in the hours of Mars is
peryllous metynge with thieves / for dread of sleynge of true men. And Saturn
mounteth in to the Crabbe / and gothe about the.xii. signs in two year / and
thus he ronneth his course.

The proprytes of Mars.
HE that is borne under this Planet of Mars / in all unhappiness is expert / he
shall be a nouryssher of great beestes he is full of malice / and ever doing
wrong. Under Mars is borne thieves and robbers that keep hye ways / and do
hurt to true men / and night walkers / quarrel pykers / bosters / mockers /
and skoffers / and these men of Mars causes war and murder / and battle /
they will be gladly smythes or workers on iron light fyngred / and liars and
great swerers of oaths in ve^geable wise: and a great surmyler and crafty / he
is red and angry with black here / and little iyen / he shall be a great
walker / and a maker of swords and knyues / and a sheder of man's blood / a
fornycatour / and a speker of rybawdry / red berded / round vysage: and good
to be a barboure and a blood letter / and to draw tethe / and is peryllous of
his hands / and he will be rich with other men's gooddes. And of the body of
man Mars keeps the galle and the reins.

Fourthly of the noble planet Sol.
AS for Sol is a Planet of great renown / and king of all the planettes / for
the Son nouryssheth every age / and yet is he hot and dry of nature / and
the planet of Saturn is to him full contrary: for he is ever cold / and the
noble planet of the Son is hot / and gives all light. For when it is above
the earth it is day / and when the earth does shadow the Son / it is night
much be we both man and woman bound to laud god for this noble planet: for
he comfort both man and be / fysses / and all fowls that flyen in the
air / all things ben glad of the Son / after that the son gothe in to
the west / the fair flowers close them self.

The proprytes of the noble planet Sol:
King of all the planettes is Sol / All men and women that been borne under
this planette of Sol shall be very fair / amyable of face / and their skin
shall be right white and tender / and well colored in the vysage with a little
rednes / and they shall have a pleasure in their own beauty / and they shall
show their lives as they were good and holy / but they shall be secret
ypocrytes if they give them to relygyon / they shall be fortunate to great
promocyons / they shall be clean and good of faith / and shall be gouernoure of
other people / and if they be never so poor / yet shall they love hawkynge and
hunting / with hounds and hawks / and rejoice to se it / The children that
be borne under the Son shall desire honor and science / and shall sing
very pleasauntly / and they shall be full of courage good and dylygent / and
shall desire lordshyp above other people / they shall give wise Iugementes /
and their words shall sound all swetely / and if he bear any office he shall
be lyberall / and he shall be subtle in deeds of war / and many shall seek to
him for cou^ceyle / he shall have profit by women / and he shall be in service
with lords / and by them shall have auau^tage for his wysdom: his sign shall
be in the face / he shall be small of stature / with scrype here and balde on
the heed / he will be seldon angry / and of all the members in man's body the
Son keeps the heart / as most myghtyest planet about all the other
planettes.

Fyfthly of the gentle Planet Venus.
VEnus the gentle planet reygneth next after the son^e / and is a planet
femynyne / and is a lady over all lovers / this planet is moist and cold of
nature / and her two signs ben Taurus and Libra and in them she has all her
Joy and pleasaunce / she causes Joy / and specially among young folk / for
greatly she reygneth on them and on all men that been Ialous / and women also /
for Ialousy is but a love inordynat / as when a man or a woman loves more
fervently than they should: for such would never be from the sight of their
lovers: for if they be anon they suspecte them and dread for fere to be
begyled. For there is no man that loves a woman by carnal affeccion / but it
is by the influence of Venus / and but few men can escape out of her danger.
This planet Venus reygneth in.xii. months over the.xii. signs.

The proprytes of Venus.
ALl these men and women / that been borne under Venus / they shall be very gaye
lovers / pleasant and delycyous / and most commonly they shall have black
iyen / and little brows / red lyppes and chekes / with a smiling chere / they
shall love the noise of trumpettes / claryons / and of other mynstralsy / and
they shall be pleasant syngers with sweet voices / and full of wanton toys /
plays / and skoffynges / and shall greatly delight in daunsynge / and in
casting of gamboudes / with lepynge and spryngynge / and will use playinge at
the chesse / cards / and tables / and desire often to comen of lust and love /
and coueyte often sweet metes and drynkes / as wine / and be often dronken /
and desire lechery / and the beholdynge of fair women / and the women of men
in like wise. And use the deed of flesshely lust often times: they will desire
fair clothes of gay color and fine / with rings of vanyte / and all vain
pleasure of the world / with perles and precious stones / they shall love
flowers with sweet smelles / yet shall they be of good faith: and they shall
love other as well as them self / and they shall be lyberall to their friends
/ they shall have few enemies / if they be brown / they shall be well
proporcyoned of body / and if they swear it is true / ye may believe them / and
Venus governs the kydneys of man.

Syxtely of the fair planet Mercury.
MEercury the fair planette / is next under Venus / and is masculyne next
above the Moon / This Mercury is very full and dry of nature: and his two
pryncypall signs ben these / Gemini is the first that reygneth in the arms /
and in the hands of man or woman / and the other sign is Virgo that governs
the nauyll and the stomach of man / this planet is Lord of speech in likewise
as the Son is lord of light. This planet Mercury passes and cyrcuyte
the.xii. signs / in.CCC. and xxx viii. days.

The proprytes of Mercury.
WHo so is borne under Mercury shall be very subtle of wit / and shall be a
devout person to god / and have good conscience / and shall be very crafty in
many scyences / he with his wysdom and labor shall get him many friends and
lovers. He shall ever follow and resort to them that be of good manners / and
shall be fortunate on the sea to use the course of marchaundyse / he shall be
very gracyous / he shall have harm by women / and when he is married men shall

be a very good man of the church / or a relygyous man / and he shall not love
to go a war fare / he will hate thieves and swerers / and he shall gather
great goods by his wysdom. If he be a man of the world he shall be perfyte in
some hand craft / he shall love well to preche: and to speak fair rethoryke
language / and to talk of Philosophy and geometry / he shall love well
writing and to read ever in strange books / and to cast accomptes of great

he shall be perfyte in the art of musyke and love it / he shall love mesurynge
and metynge / and shall be some great clothe maker / he shall be servant to some
great lord / or else a receyuer of his money / he shall have a hye foreheed /

the law / and he will meddle with other men's deeds / and they do not well and
say against it / and Mercury governs the thyghes / the belly / and the
flanks.

Seventhly of the Moon.
AS it is known and to be understand / that the lowest planet of the.vii.is
named Luna / the which we call the moon / the which planet is called feminyne
or female / and is called among Astronomyers the Lady of the night / for the
chief light and clerenes that is by night / is by the presence of the moon /
for the moon is much more nerer approached unto us than any fterre is / and
therefore she gives us much more light than the sterres does / and also the moon is lady of moisture: and rules the sea by ebb and store the moon does
take her light of the son^e.xxii. times in the year. And also the moon is cold
and moist of nature / and her color is much fayrer than silver / and her
chief house is Cancer / and there is none of the other planettes that be so
low / and goth so little cyrcuyte as does the Moon / and descends in to
Scorpio / And she gothe about the.xii. signs in.xxvi. days / and than
changes and recalled new. And this is the course of the Moon: after the
saying of Ptholomeus.

The propretes of Luna.
SVche men and women as ben borne under the Moon shall be lowly and seruyable /
and very gentle. And if it be a maiden child / she shall be very shame fast
and womanly / and they shall be well favored both man and woman / their faces
shall be full and round / they shall be very pacyent folks: and will suffer
much wrong or they be revenged / and will be soft of speech and very
curteyse / and shall live honstly with such as god shall send them / and will
haunte virtuous company / they shall be well fourmed of body: and have merry lokes
and love honestly to be glad / and will live very chastely / and love greatly
the virtue of clennes / both in word and deed / they hate lecherous talkers /
of rybawdry / their color shall be myxed but with little rednes / they shall
right gladly go arrayed in many colored clothes / and they shall soon sweet in
the forhed. Also they will have great desire to be masters and maystresses
over great stremes / ryuers / and floodes / and shall deuyse many propre
engynes for to take fysshe and to deceive them / look what they say and it
shall be true and steadfast / and they shall be very honest and good goers on
foot: and will comfort sick persons / he shall love well to talk sometime of
meruayles / he shall not keep hatred long in his mind / and he shall appese
the people under color with co^munycacyons: as well as other should do with
silver. Honest women he shall love / and he will hate harlottes and brothelles
/ and shall norysshe children up in virtue and good manners. And the lyghtes and
the brains of man is under the governance of Luna that is the moon.

Thus ends the.vii. Planettes with their proprytes. And here follows / to
know the Fortunes and destenyes of man and woman borne under the.xii. Signs
(after the saying of Ptholomeus) prince of Astronomye. Capitulo.xli.
SO to know under what planet a man or woman is borne / It is needful to wete
that there is.vii. planettes on the sky / that is to say / Sol / Venus / Mars
Mercurius / Jupiter / Luna / and Saturnus. Of the.vii. Planettes is named
the.vii. days of the weke / for every day has his name of the Planet
reygnynge in the beginning of it. The ancient Philosophers say that Sol
domyneth the Sunday (the cause is they say) for the Son among other
planettes is most worthy: wherefore it takes the worthyest day / that is the
sunday. Luna domyneth the first hour of monday. Mars the first hour of
tewysday. Mercurius for wednysday. Jupiter for thursday. Venus for friday / And
Saturnus for saturday. The day natural has.xxiiii. hours / and every hour
reygneth a planet. It is for to be noted that when a man will begin to reken at
sunday / he must reken thus / Sol / Venus / Mercurius / Luna / Saturnus /
Jupiter / Mars. And when the nombre is failed / he must begin at the hour that
he would know what planet reygneth. The mo^day he ought to begin at Luna. The
tewysday at Mars. The wednysday at Mercury. The thursday at Jupiter. The friday
at Venus. The saturday at Saturnus. And ever when the nombres of the planettes
is failed / he must begin by order as is aforesaid. Also it is to be noted that
the Greeks do begin their day in the morning. The Jews at noone. And the
Christian men at mydnyght: and there we ought lo begin to reken. For at one of
the clock on Sunday in the morning reygneth Sol / at.ii. reygneth Venus /
at.iii. reygneth Mercury / at.iiii. reygneth Luna / at.v. Saturn / at.vi.
Jupiter / at.vii. Mars / and at.viii. begin again at Sol / at.iv. Venus /
at.v. Mercury / at.vi. Luna / at.vii. Saturn: and so by order in every hour.
when a child is borne / it is to be known at what hour / and if it be in the
beginning of the hour / in the mids / or at the end. If it be in the
beginning / he shall hold of the same planet / and of the other before. If it
be in the mids / it shall hold of that only. If it be borne in the end /
it shall hold of the same / and of that that comes next after:
Nevertheless the planet that it is borne under shall not rule other / and that
of the day shall be above it / which is the cause that a child holds of
diverse planettes / and has diverse condycions. He that is borne under Sol
shall be prudent and wise and a great speker / and that which he prayseth he
holds virtuous in him self. who that is born under Venus is loved of every
man / good to godwarde and reguler. who that is borne under Mercury is well
berded / subtle / mylde / verytable / and is not most prudent. who that is
born under Luna has an hye forehed ruddy / merry vysage / shamefast / and
relygious, who that is borne under Saturn is hardy / curteyse of living / and
is not auarycyous. who that is borne under Jupiter is hardy fair vysage and
ruddy / chaste and vagabounde. who that is borne under Mars / is a great speker
/ a liar / a thief / a deceyuer / bygge and of reed color. They that will know
of this more euydently / let them turn to the proprytes of the.vii. planettes
before rehearsed.

The prologue of Ptholomeus upon the.xii. signs. Capitulo.xlii.
I Considering the course of the celestial bodies: and the power of the hye
god omnypotent / the which has made the son to shine upon the good and
evil / that governs all things contained in the Fyrmament / and on the
earth have taken upon me for to endyte this little treatise / for to instruete
and endoctryne the people not lettred. First to know god their maker.
Secondely to govern their bodies / and eschew infyrmytes. And thyrdely to
know the course of the fyrmament / and of the celestyall bodies contained in
it / with the disposicions of the.vii. planettes. But who that will know his
proprytes ought first to know the Month that he was borne in: and the sign
that the son was in the same day. I will not say that such things shall
be / but that the signs have such proprytes / as it is the will of god. After
Poets and Astronomyers / Aries is the first sign that shows the Fortunes
of men and women / as says Ptholomeus.

Thus ends the.xii. Signs of destenyes of man and woman born under them. And
here after follows the Science of Phyzonomye / for to know the natural
inclynacyon of man and woman.
SO as Pholomeus says Phyzonomye of the which has been spoken of before: is
a science that Astronomyers have for to know the natural inclynacyon of man
and woman good or evil: by diverse signs on them in be holding them oonly.
The which inclynacyon / we ought to follow if it be good. But if it be evil by
virtue and strength of understanding / we ought to eschew and euyte it as to
the effect / and to withsta^de the said evil inclynacyons. Astronomyers use
this science none other wise. The prudent / virtuous and wise men may be as
touching their manners All other than their signs demonstreth and shows in
their reygne. For these tokens that do sygnyfye vice is not seen in a wise man
though the sign be so / as an ale stake / or a sign hanged before an house /
in the which often times is no drink. For how be it that a man by his
wysdom and understanding follow not the evil influences of the celestyall
bodies that been upon him / and yet corrupts not the signs and demonstracions
of the said influences / but those signs naturally have sygnory and domynacion
on them / in the which they be for to have naturally that which they sygnyfy
/ though that a man follow them / or follow them not.

wherefore Astronomyers say that the most part of men and women follow their
natural inclynacions to vice or virtue / for that the most part of them be
not wise and prudent as they ought to be / and they use no virtue of their
own minds / but ensues their sensualyte. And by these celestyall influences
of the which is showed by signs outward of such signs is the said science
of Phyzonomye known. For the which it behooves first to know that the year
is divided in.iiii. parties (as it has been said before) that is to wit Pryme
time / Some / Heruest / and winter / that been compared to the.iiii. Elements.
Pryme time to the air. Somer to the fire. Heruest to the earth. And winter to
the water. Of the which.iiii. Elements every man and woman is formed and made
/ and without the which none may live. The fire is hot and dry. The air is
hot and moist. The water is moist and cold. The earth is cold and dry.
Also they say that the person on whom the fire reygneth is Coleryke of
compleccion (that is to say) hot and dry. He on whom the air reygneth is
Sanguyne of co^pleccyon (that is to say) hot and moist. He on whom the water
domyneth is Flumatyke of compleccyon (that is to say) moist and cold. He on
whom the earth domyneth is Melancolyke of compleccion (that is to say) cold
and dry. The which compleccions they knowledge and deserve the one from the
other.

AS the Coleryke has nature of fire hot and dry / natually is lene and
sklender / covetous / yrefull / hasty / braynles / folysshe / malycyous /
deceytfull / and subtle / where he bestows his wit. He has wine of the Lion
(that is to say) when he is dronken he chydeth / fyghteth / and commonly he
loves to be clad in black / as russet / and graye.

The Sanguyne has nature of Air hot and moist / and is large / plentuous /
attempred / amyable / abundaunte in nature / merry / singing laughing /
liking / ruddy and gracyous. He has his wine of the Ape / the more he
drynketh the meryer he is: and draws to women / and naturally loves hye
colored cloth.

The Flumatyke has nature of water / cold and moist / he is heavy / slow /
slepy / ingenyous / commonly he spytteth when he is moved and has his wine of
the Sheep / for when he is dronken he accompteth him self wysest and be loves
most and above all colors / the color of grene clothe.

The Melancolyke has nature of Earth / cold and dry / he is heavy / covetous
/ bacbyter malycyous / and slow. His wine is of the hog / for when he is
dronken he desires sleep / and to lie down and have his rest / and he loves
the color of black best.

Here follows the Iugementes of man's body. Capitulo.xliiii.
FOr to come to our purpose of speaking of vysyble signs / we will begin to
speak of the signs of the head. First we warn you that you ought to beware of
all persons that have defaute of members naturally / as of foot hand iye / or
other membre / and though that he be but a creple / and specially of a man
that has no berde / for such ben inclyned to diverse vices and euylles / and
one ought to eschew his company / as his mortal enemy. Also Ptholomeus says
that much and plain here sygnyfyeth a person pyteous and debonayre. They
that have reed here / ben commonly yrefull and lack wit / and ben of little
truth. Bblacke here / good vysage / and good color / sygnyfyeth very love
of Justice. Hard here sygnyfyeth that the person loves peace and concord:
and is of good and subtle wit. A man that has black here and red berde /
sygnyfyeth to be lecherous unjust / and a vaunter: and one ought not to trust
in him. The yelowe here and cryspe sygnyfyeth man laughing / merry / lecherous
/ and deceytefull. Black here and cryspe sygnyfyeth melancolyke / sechery /
evil thought / and very lyberall. Hanging here sygnyfyeth wit / with malice.
Great plente of here in a woman sygnyfyeth boystousnes and couetyse. A person
with great iyes is slothful / unshamefast / inobedyent / and weneth to know
much more than he does / but when the iyen ben full mean not to bygge nor to
small / and that they be not to black nor to grene / such a man is of great
understanding / curteyse / faithful and trusty. A person that is blere iyed
/ gogle iyed / and squynt iyed sygnyfyeth malice / vengeance / cautele / and
treason.

They that have great wide iyen and have long here on their brows and iye
lyddes sygnyfyeth folysshenes / hard of understanding: and ben evil by
nature. The persons which have their iyen mouynge fast from one side to
another / and have their syghte sharp and quycke sygnyfyeth fraud / and
theft / and is of little trust. The iyen that been black / clear / and
shynynge ben the best / and the most certain and they sygnyfye wit and
discrecion / and such a person is worthy to be loved: for he is full of
truth / and of good condycions. The iyen that been ardaunt and sperkelynge:
sygnyfye strong heart / force / and puysaunce. The iyen that been whytysshe and
flesshely / sygnyfye a person enclyned to vice / lechery and full of fraud.
Astronomyers say that when a person beholds often as abashed shamefaste /
and ferefull / and that in beholding it seems that he syngeth / and he has
small drops apperyng in his iyen: than it is for certain that such persons
love and desire the wealth of them that they behold. But when any looks in
casting his iyen aside / as by wantonness / such persons ben deceytfull /
and purchase to grieve him / and such persons will dishonor women / and they
ought to be taken head of / for such lokes ben false / lecherous / and
deceyuable. They that have small garysshe iyen and sharp sygnyfye a person
melancolyous / hardy / an evil sayer / and cruel. And if a little vain appear
between the iye and the nose of a wenche / they say that it sygnyfyeth
