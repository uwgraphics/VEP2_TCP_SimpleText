A new Northeren Iigge, called, Dainty come thou to me.


VVIlt thou forsake me thus,
and leave me in misery?
And I gave my hand to thee,
only with thee to die:
Cast no care to thy heart,
from thee I will not flee,
Let them all say what they will,
Dainty come thou to me.
UUere my state good or ill,
rich, or in misery,
Yet would I love thee still,
prove me and thou shall see.
Cast no care, etc.
UUere you rich, were you poor,
were you in misery,
I will beg from door to door,
all for to maintain thee:
Cast no care, etc.
UUere I Lord, were I Knight,
came I of high degree,
All my Lands should be thine,
try me and thou shall see*
Cast no care, etc.
If the Indie Gold were mine,
and all the wealth of Spain
All that it should be thine,
prove me yet once again:
Cast no care, etc.
Thy beauty does excel,
above all I love thee,
UUith thee I mean to dwell,
try me and thou shall see:
Cast no care, etc.
I promise for the sake,
all other to for^ake,
And only thee to take,
try me and thou shall see*
Cast no care, etc.
Let me thy love obtain,
or else I am but slain,
Revive me once again,
sweet I desire thee.
Cast no care, etc.
If Friends do frown and fret,
and Parents angry be,
And Brothers grief is great,
yet I love none but thee.
Cast no care, etc.
Here Is my hand and my heart,
faith and troth unto thee,
From thee I will not start,
try me and thou shall see.
Cast no care, etc.
Thus my Friends I forsake,
with thee my life to spend,
Refusing no pains to take,
until my life does end:
Cast no care, etc.
Farewell my trusty Love,
true as the Turtle-doue.
I will as constant prove,
till we two meet again.
Cast no care, etc.
Finis.
