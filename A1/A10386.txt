A Plaster for a galled Horse.

Look what here in shall be read
Wynse at nothing, except ye be grity
For of usurped power we be not a dradde.
But God to be known, before precepts fylthy
We speak not against Gods holy mystery
But against such, as love neither God not their king
Beware therefore ye know not your desteny
Look better to the Scripture, the word everlasting
Proverb. xxvi. Unto the horse be^ongeth a whippe To the Ass a Brydles and a
rod to the fools back.

If this plaster be to cold
Ye shall have an other be bold
The Intent is to cure and edyfy
So it is said, By Jhon Ramsy
M. D. XLVIII.

The plajster.
THe horse that is galled will wynse and kycke
If any do enterprise, to come such a nere
He thinks ye go about to touch the quick
That rather he would run through water and fire
Even the like our massemakers, begin to stere
If any in their maungines, fyndeth lack
Then like a galled horse they stamp and stere
But guppe ye godmakers beware your galled back.
Guppe sir Ihon and guppe Bishop also
Guppe al other, that hold with the same
Very maungy ye are, and winse to and fro
Doubt not but at length it wyll'turne you to shame
For many of you command in your own name
Up with mass (we charge you let not that slack
Or else in the Castle of N. we will you tame
But Guppe ye God makers, bewary your galled back
What other are you, but maungy in deed
To prefere ye abhominacion most vyse in Gods sight
Look ye blind dweles, in what Gospel do ye read
That such myrlymuse, does please God a right
On this side, and yt side, as one sought his way by night
Straining a knaves, arms, as though he stod on a rack
With mockes and mowes, and like a fool dyght
But guppe ye Godmakers, beware your galled back
Think you Christen faith to you is obedient
To follow such Mainetry, made by a pilled squier
No no you may well hold your selves content
We have neither faith, in Monk Priest nor Friet.
ye are worthy to be hanged, and so paid for your hiere
That will compel, the true subjects to bear your pack
It seems by your deeds, that treason ye do conspire
But guppe ye Godmakers, be ware your galled back:
Where is your obedience, and where is your commission?
So tyranly so heritikely, to give any such co^mau^deme^te
To follow the pope, with his superstytion
yet in one knotte, to this ye do consent
ye rore and cry, as men with out Judgment
Up wish the mass or eles al, goes to wrack
But remember goods vengaunce is ready bent
And guppe ye Godmakers, beware your galled back.
Ye say ye are an insurrection
But w^o shall it make. that would we know?
Even your own selves / with your pestilent Infection
To supresse gods verity, and bring it low,
It is time to look to you, for the sede that you do sow
Which ye shall repe, and lay it on your own stacke,
We set not a fart by your mass made with mock and mow
But Guppe ye Godmakers, beware your galled back
Look in holy scripture, learn there your duty
ye blood guides / that stomble at a straw
There shall ye find, that the Lord God only,
Shalt thou serve and follow his holy law
But thou thinkeste, yt god is made of every Iackedawe
As in his hands thou must hear his bones crack
And thynkest thy self safe. when he is down in thy maw
But Guppe ye Godmakers, beware your galled back
you^ mass yt ye make your god serves for many a thing
For ^e for drowthe, for pestilence and sheep
For ^gges for pylgrimes, for ships that he saylynge
For corn for the cough, and for those that can not sleep
And what for this if your god ye do not well keep
He will stynke in his house, ye can not a bide the smacke
yet to that false god, ye knele and crepe
But guppe ye godmakers beware your galled back:
you have chaplens of trust, that serve for the nones
Gredy of stommacke hasty in digestion
That can eat up a whole body both flesh blood and bones
And that same day be drunk and ask no question
A dronke^ chaplen a dronken god, surely a holy profession
Cursed be such for there deeds are black
Our God is in heaven, which dyed for our redemption
But puppe ye godmakers beware your galled back:
In three parts your God must be divided
For ye bodies above, ye bodies beneth, and those ye be lyui^ge
That Pope was wise that thus had contryued
God for God, God for the dyuell, God for all ill doing
Every pice was God, this is your teichinge
So that the least piece, be it never so little a snacke
Is god of god made, that had a beginning
But guppe ye godmakers. beware your galled back
ye may do what ye list with things of your own
ye may do what ye can, where ye be not set by.
your cruel torments be sone over blown,
And the rekeninge ye must make of all your Injury
Men that account the^ selves wise should circumspectly
Do all things to gods honor, and not his scripture hacke
As men de lekes, their Imagination to satysfy
But guppe ye godmakers beware your galled back
We would talk with you, but your malice is to great
your deeds do declare, ye are the Popes Pigs
yet we will ax one question but be in no more heat
And let by hear what ye sucked out of ye Popes biggis
Do men on the brembles gather any figs
do your horemasters prestes* by their ministracio^ so compacke
To alure Christ out of heaven, as me^ do birds to twingges
No no, ye Godmakes / beware your galled back
Christ sits in heaven holy scripture says so,
Christ shall come again, eue^ ye same body yt went hence
Christ said it was expedient that he should go
For his fleshly body did no longer profyt by presence
The kiss that Judas had took not a way his offense
But still in desperation. his consecience stacke
Much less in your God, that has no intelligence
But guppe ye Godmakers, beware your galled back.
Ye pretend a great holiness, but not in right use
Christ's institution is clean out of memory
He brake the bread, without bayne excuse
And said it was his body that ends should dye
Now it was not the bread: yt was crucified at Caluarye
But ye body which is i^ heaven this scripture ye cannot lack
And as the bread was broken even so was his body
But Gup ye God makers, beware your galled back.
But as you do use it, it is neither here nor there
But a faynde mommer^, of Antichrists deuyse
And as Baruch says no God he is, we need not to fear
For when he is down he can no more rise
Yet your Pristes, handell him so fynely and nyce
Wrappe him in clowtes, with many apopyshe knacke
I would all such pristes, mighty swarm full of lyce
But guppe ye Godmakers, beware your galled back:
Lay forth for your self, the best that ye can
Commounde what ye list, of your own deuyse
We know, ye shall not be obayed of never an honest man
But of your own couenauntes, yt loves ye popes guyse
yet beware least your heads know the price
for ye like trayters, against our king find lack
in suppressing the Pope, with all his marchaundyce
But guppe ye godmakers beware your galle back.
Mark the gesture, who that list
First a shorn shauelynge, clad in a clowt
Bearinge the name of an honest priest
And yet in no place a starker lowte
A whore monger a dronkard, ye mayken him be snowte
At the Alehouses he studieth, till his wirte he does lack
Such are your min^sters, to bring this matter about
But guppe ye godmakers. be ware you galled back
Then wraped in a knaves skin, as holy as my horse
Before the altar, in great contemplacion
Confessinge the sins of his lubbrysh Corse
To god and all saynctes, he counts his abhominatio^
Then home to the altar, with great saintification
With crosses, and blesses, with his boy little Jack
Thus forth goes sir Ihon with all his preparation
But puppe ye godmakers beware your galled back:
Then gloria in excelsis for joy does he sing
More for his fat lyuinge, then for devotion
And many there be that remember another thing
Which sing not with merry heart for l^cke of promocion
Thus some be merry, some be sorry according to their porcio^
The forth comet (...) Colettes, bound up in a pack
Of this saint and that saint, for sickness, and extorcio^
But guuppeye godmakers beware your galled back.
The epistell and gospel they have put in
To color their false'hed under holy pretense
And al in latin, to cloak their synnne,
This daily is seen by common experience
Now mark, for here comes great reverence,
Adappe for a fly, which is a pretty knacke
That must ye kiss, and give them pence
But guppe ye godmakers beware your galled back.
Tha^ must be wash, he has handled some whores tail
With turn about Jack / and show some sport
For many at popish knaves, of the shaven sort
More me^er he were for the whippe and flayle,
Then to put the dead souls in good comfort
There stands ^e moming like a calfe in a sack
Many times hy^ whore, will the there resort
But guppe ye godmakers beware your galled back
Then make they god with words ynowe
And hang him up between thieves twain
Then ye masmongers, look that ye bow
For there is your god, made by a knave in grain
And he prays unto him for all syckenes and pain
And at length does eat him, both shoulder leg and tacke
And the next day can make an other again
But guppe ye godmakers, beware your galled back
Thus ye are begyled with such foxes play
And your hearts are so fet that the truth ye do not see
yet remember god and our king what they do say
That from Idolatry would have you to flee,
if ye will not then be blind still for me:
the lord defend our noble king, yt of you he have no lack
For you ar hard to be trusted what soever ye be
Therefore year warned, beware your galled back
