the states of Holland and Zeland, with all other his faithful subjects of the

and troubles happened in the said low Country: to the relief whereof, they
require his Majesty's speedy redress and remedy.

PSALM. LXXXII. Defend the poor and fatherless, see that such
as be in need and necessity, have right.
Deliver the outcast and poor, save them from
the hand of the ungodly.
Imprinted at London, by Henry Middleton. 1573.

A Supplication to the Kings Majesty of Spain, made by the Prince of Orange,
the States of Hollande and Zealande, with all other (...) faithefull subjects
of the low Countrie^ presently suppressed by the tyranny of the Duke of Alba,
and Spaniardes.
Most Sovereign Lord, your* Majesty's most obedient and lame^ting subjects
of the low Countries, as they have often pondered with the^ selves, the natural
affection and fatherly good inclination, which your Majesty has (since the
time that your grace by the power of almighty God received the dominion and
regiment of the said countries) always and continually showed: so have they had
a sure hope and undoubted affiaunce, that your Majesty as well upon their daily
complaynts and lamentations, as upon the pitiful declarations and
remo^strances of some christian Princes and Potentates unto your Majesty,
mercifully have considered of our pitiful and most miserable suppressio^,
wherewith we by reason of the great and unsupportable force, arrogance, and
wicked regiment of the Duke of Alba are suppressed, and mercifully have
regarded the most miserable ruin and destruction of these your natural low
countries, who always have been most faithful and obedient, both to your
Majesty, and also your Graces predecessors. Not doubting but that your
Majesty would grievously have been moved, that he under pretense of
protecting and defending the Romish religion, under the color of your
Maiestyes name, should presume to frustrate and break all the privileges,
customs, and rightes, whereunto your Majesty and your predecessors have
sworn, persecuting your faithful subjects in body and goods, and destroying
your countries, in none other sort, but as if he had declared himself to be
an open enemy of your Majesty and the subjects of the same.

Therefore have they always earnestly attended, that your Majesty no longer
suffering the said force, would have provided some convenient means for the
safegarde of your countries, and deliverance of your poor and suppressed
subjects, and have a respect to the dutiful office of a king, whom the
almighty God, the king of all kings, has placed and ordained as a
protector of the righteous, and a fatherly pastor of the people under your
subjection, to defend and preserve them from all force and violence: and
likewise to remember the manifold and faithful services, which your said
countries and subjects, have from time to time most faithfully done to your
Majesty and your predecessors.

But they now (to their extreme grief) considering that all their former
supplications are as nothing regarded and in vain, and that al other the
remonstrances of sundry Princes and Potentates, have sortid no such effect as
might have turned to their comfort and consolation, and they in their
consciences assuring themselves, that your Majesty has no reasonable occasion
upon evil will or displeasure* so to alienate and turn your self from your
lamentable subjects: can not but undoubtedly suspect, that through malice and
false information of some, who having more regard to their private lust and
appetite, than to the service of your Majesty, have daily labored to bring
your Majesty's countries into your displeasure. Wherein they have always most
manifestly and unfeignedly pretended and trauayled, not only by letting and
defending that our humble supplications and faithful warnings should come to
your Majesty's ears, misconstruing the same to the worst, and peruersly
accusing them to your Majesty, thereby to bring the country into discention and
commotion, and so under your name to suppress and make desolate the same, and
so with the goods and blood of your subjects to quench their greedy and
insatiable apetite.

This is that (O most sovereign King) which your said subjects do, and have
not without occasion esteemed to be the greatest calamity that might happen
unto them, as considering that the way and means whereby they might complain
and show their griefs to your Majesty, as to their bountiful and natural
Protector (so by God appointed as a refuge in their extremity) is by the
ungodly dealing of their ennemies taken away from them: a thing which all
ways has been permitted to unreasonable creatures: namely to suffer them in
their extremity and need to sue for remedy and redress.

And therefore, although they had resolved and taken in hand with patience to
attend the time of redress, thinking that your Majesty would at last have
opened your ears and eyes to hear and see their miserable estate, from which
your Majesty by reason of their said evil willers is now let. But now
considering in the end their suppression, the longer the more to increase and
to become more insufferable, tending not only to their damage and destruction,
but also of your Majesty's heritage and countries, which in times past have
flourished in all prosperity, and now come to ruin: they could not for the
faithful obedience and aliance sake wherein they are bound to your Majesty and
their native country, but now once again by writing, request your Majesty to
consider and weigh the original occasion of the desolation of your countries,
and by whose means the same is come to pass, and consequently execute the
office of a true King, in defending the righteous, and delivering your
countries from this tyranny and oppression.

And first we humbly beseech your Majesty to call to mind and consider, that
these your countries in times past having been divided amongst sundry Lords and
rulers, are since by mariadges, agreements, and mutual treaties, in time, and
orderly by lawful succession and conueniences come under the house of
Burgondie, and afterward, by means of marriages contracted with the most
famous house of Austria, and consequently allied with the most mighty kingdom
of Spain* yet always with express condition, that every and singular the
countries and provinces should possess and enjoy their own policies rightes
and liberties in times past accustomed, without that any province or country
should be burdened of the dominion of the other, or by any means be deprived
of their customs or liberties, but be bound jointly to live one with another
under one Prince and head, as many children under one father, to the intent
with one accord to defend their Prince and common weal against all strangers
and foraine force.

Also the Princes of the country willing as fathers to show and declare their
love and affection to every one, did at their solemnisation and entering into
their dominion and rule, by a solemn oath, bynd themselves to use and keep
each country in their rightes and franchises, without suffering that any of
them should be enfringed or deminished, or that the one Province should have
dominion or rule over the other, much less be subject unto any foraine
dominion or power: upon which conditions he is accepted and taken as a supreme
Lord and Governor over ye countries, and theruppon receaueth the oath of
obedience and faithfulness of his subjects.

Of which the premises needs not any further or larger rehersall, whilst
that undoubtedly your Majesty does sufficiently remember, how that the
Emperor Charles, of most noble memory, following the presidentes of his
predecessors, and acknowledging that the said oath of solempnisation is the
only and right foundation, upon which does consist as well the might, and
authority of a Prince, as the faith and obedience of his subjects, did in his
life time, and presence of your Majesty, cause your Majesty to receive the
said countries under ye said oath, and swear your Majesty to the joyful
income in all the lands and most of the towns, as next successor and only
heir of his imperial Majesty: and afterward the same Imperial Majesty
departing out of these countries, and your Majesty receiving the full
dominion, and administration of the Land: did once again, in presence of the
Deputid of the countries then assembled, rehearse and strongly confirm the
said privileges. So that in all times past the said countries have enjoyed and
been ruled by their former privileges and liberties.

Out of which has followed such faithfulness and obedience of the subjects
toward their Prince, and such unity and love amongst each other, that the
countries by God his providence, have flourished with most happy prosperity,
the Princes then adorned with all honor and high dignities, and greatly
redoubted and feared of their enemies.

And because it needs not to rehearse any thing out of the old histories,
being notwith standing explenished with many preside^ts, it has appeared in
all the wars of the Imperial Maistie, what earnest care he had to the
defense and mayntenaunce of his countries in rest and quietness.

Likewise your Majesty can well remember that he taking his leave of these
countries, did specially and earnestly reco^mend the state thereof unto your
Majesty: Yea your Majesty being at his arrival burdened with grievous wars
and extreme charges, has by experience found that all your subjects both
great and small, every one to his state and ability, have been ready to
venture both life and goods in service of your Majesty. Wherein as well the Lords
and nobles, as commons, have so acquitted and behaved themselves, that your
Majesty has vanquished and overcome your enemies, gotten great praise and
renown of al kings, and potentates, and made a fynall end of al wars and
discentions, wherewith many years before your auncetors and countries were
troubled.

Now if it might please your Majesty, (which your lamentable and faithful
subjects do most humbly require) to enquire of and consider the original
occasions of the alterations of such good and quiet prosperity, into such
miserable commotions and extremities, wherewith the countries are now
suppressed: your Majesty shall find them to spring out of the malice and envy
which some (being about your Majesty) do bear to the prosperity and welfare
wherewith God almighty has blessed your countries and subjects.

Which envy and cancred malice, being further incensed and stuffed with
insatiable avarice and unmeasurable prodigality, has brought them to such
cruelty and tyranny, that they altogether forgetting all affection and service
which they did owe unto the country wherein they have gotten great honor and
benefits, have (to the great prejudice of the service of your Majesty and
common wealth of these countries) procured by all means and practices this
most heinous fire of commotion, to the intent to aspire to the dignity
surpassing the states of the land, yea of your Majesty.

And knowing well that to compass that devise, it was a matter impossible, the
customs and liberties of the countries remaining in force, which do altogether
contrary their wicked pretense: considering besides, how diligent and faithful
they of ye said countries were every one in his vocation (according to their
oath) to stand to the maintenance of the same: they attempted in perverse manner
too interpret too your Majesty the doings and proceedings of the Lords,
governors, and states of the land, tending to the maintenance of ye said
rights, and liberties, in such sort as if they tended to disobedience or
rebellion toward your Majesty.

Amongst which, specially some being spiritual persons, have by all means
attempted and sought, under pretense and shadow of religion to confederate
with other foraine prelates, and so by secret attempts and practices, to bring
the country in hatred of your Majesty, to the intent that they with their
confederates which are by oath allied not with your Majesty, but with strange
rulers and countries in Italy and else where, specially with the Pope of Room,
might here bear rule and governance, etc. and as possibility and commodity
served, to enlarge and confirm the same.

For when they first perceived that in all the countries here abouts, yea over
all Christendom, their rude and manifest abuses, and errors, by reason of the
negligence and avarice of the priests were discried, and specially when it
began to grieve the chief and notablest persons, yt they which ought only to
meddle with instructing of the people, in the faith and fear of God, and to
execute his service with all fidelity, according to ye example of the
Prophets and Apostels, did in stead thereof, not only contrary to God his
commandment, but also to the decrees of the former Popes, and to all
ordinances of the old counsels, yea against all statutes and vsages of Princes
and countries* take upon them to deal in worldly and Civil policies: yea
also in matters toutching warfare and rule of countries, seeking to suppress
all degrees, and to reserve ye general government to themselves, taking in
hand to bring all estates in disdain and hatred of the Princes, as well the
subjects of your Majesty, as of diverse other kings, and Potentates, accusing
them slanderously with sedition and rebellion: whereby they have stirred and
provoked, in all countries, troubles, and discention, wars and bloodshed,
setting ye subjects at discord with their rulers, and the rulers against the
subjects, and generally turned all things vpside down, and brought in execrable
confusion and error, not esteeming who was endamaged, so as they might atchiue
the accomplishme^t of their rule and dominion, and bring all things under
their rule and authority.

And to that intent, have they sought, to plant in this country the
inquisition, devised and invented in Spain by certain Jews, and Renegados,
by that means to break all privileges, rightes, and ancient customs, and to
make frustrate all sworen contracts, vsages, and counselles, and so to get a
full power and dominion over all your Majesty's faithful servants, which stand
to the oath which they have made to your Majesty, not acknowledging any foraine
Lords, spiritual or temporal, which might seek by false accusations to
impute unto your subjects, heresy and rebellion, to the intent thereby to
attain to their purpose,

For better accomplishing whereof have they by force urged and brought in the
new Bishops, contrary to all landrights, and sworn privileges, to the emparing
of your Majesty's authority: choosing them not for virtue, prudence, or
learning (being most of them, of the most rude and vnlearnest sort) but only
for that they take them as faithful and true assistents, in the executing of
their tyranny and cruelty.

Their said ungodly enterprises and consequences of the same being the longer
the more espied, have the most notablest Lords, Governors, and Gentlemen, with
the towns and country, given intelligence and knowledge to your Majesty by
continual supplications, remonstrances and other possible means, how much the
aucthorite of your Majesty should be empared, shortened and deminished, by the
said Inquisitors and Bishops, being most of them strangers and outlanders,
by oath bound unto foraine Princes, and (as they pretend) exempt of your
jurisdiction, and by the same have alleged the evident impossibilite to bring
in such inuocations, and newelties, but that it would tend to the utter ruin
and destruction of the whole country: seeing that it was most apparent that the
bringing in thereof was but a borrowed cloak to shadow their doings, in abusing
of your Majesty, and suppressing of such as would control their wicked and
most notorious procedings and abuses, which they themselves can scarce
conceal. Of which the number in these countries is so great and manifold, and
daily does more increase: that if your Majesty would have been ruled by their
persuasio^s and counsel in executing of rigor and extremities, they would
have made your Majesty a king without subjects, and your subjects without
rulers, as is most notorious by the innumerable number of those, which in these
countries have under pretense of religion been executed and murdered as well with
fire, and water, as with ye sword: besides an infinite multitude which are fled
out of the country bearing with them all occupatio^s and notable sciences to
ye instructing of others, and unspeakable prejudice of your Majesty and
countries.

Whereupon your Majesty was in the end occasioned to a myld moderation of the
placardes, by the same declaring that your meaning was not to bring in the
Inquisition: which likewise was by the Duchess of Parma, and the Lords and
Governors of the country in the behalf of your Majesty, solemply promised to
all the Towns and subjects, and accordingly published by open proclamations,
by commandment of the Maiestrates. But shortly after, all that was ouerturned
by means of the aforesaid persons, who in deed seem to have firmly persuaded
your Majesty, that such was to the deminishing of your Majesty's reputation
and dignity, unjustly alleging, that your subjects would withdraw themselves
from the duetifull obedience of your Majesty. So that it is evident that your
Majesty upon their informations, was moved to send the Duke of Alba out of
Spain into these Countries, to the intent with arms and force to compel your
Majesty's subjects, to that which they of themselves have with all humility
and obedience at all times offered.

And notwithstanding that the aforesaid Lords and Towns of these countries
had good occasion to think that they should be greatly wronged through force
of forayne soldiers, and rule of a strange Governor, not being of their
Country, nor of your Majesty's kindred or descent, but such a one as did bear
toward them a most cancred hatred, had means sufficient to prevent his
coming into the country: yet because he came in the name of your Majesty,
and to make evident that they had not rebelled or declined from the obedience
of your Majesty, trusting to their conscience and right, have willingly and
honorably received him with all such as it pleased your Majesty to send with
him, opening to him the gates of the Towns, delivered into his hands the
fortresses and strong holds, and entertained garrisons, only for yt he
declared, that such was the will and pleasure of your Majesty to be thereby
assured of the fidelity and obedience of your subjects, which were accused to
your Majesty as rebels and traitors. Therefore, reason would have required,
that the aforesaid Duke of Alba should by all means and diligence have
informed your Majesty of such your subjects true obedience and inclination:
and before he had proceeded to the execution of rigor, taken good and full
information of their complaints, and chiefly touching the bringing in of these
new Bishops and Inquisitors, contrarying God and all rightes, and that upon
good and true report thereof made to your Majesty, redress and remedy might
have been had. But now clean contrary wise, so soon as he was received and
was in possession of the force and rule of the Country, has without keeping
of any order of Justice, or having regard to the landrightes and privileges
whereunto your Majesty is sworn: not only put to death and chased away the
most part of the Lords and Governors of these countries, by your Majesty
elected and placed, but also generally declared all the privileges and
liberties to be forfaited, and the Country to be used as a country newly
conquested by force of arms, to the use of him and his associates, and so
consequently freely to deal with the lives and goods of your subjects, as
their lusts and appetites shall require.

And if possibly might be laid before your Majesty's eyes the excessive force
and not beard of cruelties which here have been used since the beginning of his
government, by spoiling, robbing, chasing away, and desolating: by
apprehending, taking, banishment, and confiscating of goods, yea by burning,
hanging, headding, hacking, racking, and most horrible and not before heard of
torments and murtherings of the Subjects of your Majesty, as well Noble as
innoble, poor as rich, young as old, widows and orphans, men, women, and
young maidens, of what state, quality, or condition soever they were: we doubt
not but that your Majesty would be amassed to hear the rehearsal thereof: yea
and would be grieved at the same, that under your name such unnatural cruelty
and tyranny should be used* as neither Phalaris, Nero, Pharao, Herod, or any
other Heathen Tyrant could have invented the like, as now is used toward your
faithful subjects, which with their lives and goods have always labored to
keep the Crown on your Majesty's head, against all your enemies.

And that your Majesty would also have taken remorse of so many innocent
infants chased away out of their native Country into straung lands: so many
poor widows and orphans, and also upon the lamentable cry of the whole
Country which now are suppressed by this most horrible tyrant.

For there is none which could defend or preserve his goods from their avarice,
their wives or daughters from their filthy lusts, or their lives from their
bloudthirstinisse. Nobility, Richesse, manhood, or good service done in times
past, could nothing prevail, if once he was entered intoo hatred of them. And
without taking regard to the Jurisdictions or ordinary courses of the country,
has stopped the Jurisdictions of al Justices, either in civil or criminal
causes which in any wise concern the confiscations pronounced in his bloody
Counsel, in such sort as neither spiritual or temporal persons, widows or
orphans, hospitalls, Spittels, Lazarus houses, or other which had good and
deuable revenues, amongst ye confiscated goods, could get any payment or
satisfaction. But the Duke of Alba has gotten all into his hands without any
mind to discharge any the premises, notwithstanding the diverse and earnest
solicitations and requests to him made in that behalf by the States of the
Countries, delaying the poor agreeued subjects with dilatorie and vnfounded
apostillations, the one always contrarying the other, and without sending over
the matters to the provincial Counsels or ordinary Justices, to the intent to
make them despair of any satisfaction to be made by the court, where by process
they have been so^moned to their excissiue charge, and upon sums of small
value have been forced to greater charges then the principal has amounted
unto, not suffering any law full transport to be made of any one debte for the
other. To consider what number of honest woomen and young maidens they have
with force and violence ravished and that the one after the other: yea misused
some even to the death. How often have they compelled the husband to remain
with the wife, and the father with the daughter, to force the^ with their eyes to
behold their most vilanous filthiness, and made them as instruments to the
accomplishinge of their luxurious lust, using such unnatural and beastly
fashions, that we are in a manner abashed and astonished to declare the same to
your Majesty. How often has it happened, that the husband seeking to defend
his wife or daughter of their rauishement, that they have all together as
furious curres, run out of the house together crying Spania, Spania,
murtheringe a number of the poor commons. How many women great with child
have they ripped up the bellies off, and murdered the fruit in their wombes.

Have they not fleyed and pulled off ye skinns of some men being alive and
headdid their drommes with the same skin? others have they not tosted with
small fyres, nypped the^ with red burning tongues even to the death, and
consequently murdered a number and made them dye a hundredth deaths? How many
women have they chased from their husbands, and children from their parents:
yea what is there under the heavens so honest or holy which they have not
defiled and trodden under foot? Uerily amongst all other Nations, yea amongst
the cruelest, ye buryinge of the dead, has always been permitted and
reverenced.

But this Tirant in the despyte of God and nature, is so obstinate and
perverse, that he has caused to be taken out of the grave the carcasses of
the dead, and conveyed under ye gallows, under pretense because some of them
dying without shrifte, and others without houseling had forfaited his goods
which he took as confiscated. What is there amongst men more holy and honest,
then is the state of Matrimony being the only and true foundation of all
mutual love and friendship, the original of love, the bond of peace, and the
direct way of all dealings amongst men: whereof this Tyrant makes so little
account, that he seuereth the me^ from their wives, and the wives from their
husbands, being joined together in the congregation before God and his Angels,
clean contrary to the commandment and institution of almighty God and
rightes, and all under pretense that they were joined together in the way of
heresy: but to say truth, it is only in spoiling manner, to match the
beautiful and rich Matrones with his Soldiers and ruffians, and finally by
his cruelty burst in sunder the original band tending to the intertayning of
all mutual love: murdering and killing the women which in time of extremity
had relieved their husbands, and the children for succouring the necessity of
their parents, yea those which had only with a letter comforted any of them.
And to the end that nothing should by him be left undefiled, has he trodden in
most despitefull manner under foot the most holy Sacrament of Baptism,
whereby we are incorporated in the body of Jesus Christ and communion of God
his Church, willing and commanding that those children which were Christened
openly and lawfully according to the institution of Jesus Christ, in the name
of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, should once again be baptized, under
pretense that they were Christened as heretics, and repugnant contrary to
all godly and natural rightes, ordonances of the church, and decrees of
Counsels.

Furthermore it needs not to rehearse to your Majesty, the grievous
exactions invented by him, one after an other, and with out measure does urge
of the poor commo^s, as the hundrethes, twenties, yea the tenth penie, of all
goods, mouables and immouables, of all goods bought and sold, demanding, yea
and urging by execution contrary to ye advise and counsel of al estates in
these countries, not of the clear gains of ye same, but the tenth, and
twenty penie of the capital some of all sales. Whereby not only all trades
and trafficques, are abandoned out of the land, but likewise the subjects of
the same, deprived from the getting of the living, of them, their wives, and
children. And notwithstanding that the states, have at sundry times done their
endeavor largely to infourme the said Duke of the inconveniences which might
follow upon the said demand: and requested that he would in their behalf
advertise your Majesty thereof: would not hearken to them, but shaked them of
without any comefort: although he was by intercession of the counsel and states
of the land thereunto most earnestly instanced, and so thereby caused the decay
of all merchandise, compelled the inhabitants through misery to flee away into
other countries. And yet it is apparent, that when any necessity is toward
for payment of the soldiers, no money is to be had, in such sort that the
Spanish soldiers are at afterdele in their payment xxviij. months, and the
Dutche most of them constrained to go a begging from door to door: of which
some have by famine and misery perished. Notwithstanding the great sommes which
the states have levied and paid to the paying of the said soldiers, and yet
nevertheless have his garnisons consumed, and eaten out the most part of the
towns, and suppressed the same with the Seruitio, which they have been forced
to minister to the said Spanish soldiers, and those which have given most
money, as well to him, as to Don Frederico, or any of theirs, have been the
first that were discharged of the said bondage of Seruitio. With which
garnisons he has most vexed ye towns cituated within the heart of the
country: leaving the borders and other places of importance without any
garrison, whereby in some places, things are come to alteration: besides that
by reason of lack of pay, his Spanish souldirurs are fallen into a most
licentious and unspeakable order of life, threatening, beating, robbing,
spoiling, and by all manner of cruel exactions using your subjects: whereby is
manifest, that under pretense of your Majesty's name and religion, he sets
nothing but to fill his greedy and bloudthirstie appetite, being to the
contrary most notorious that he has so little regard to the service of our
Majesty, as to the maintenance of the common weal of the low countries, which
he suffers utterly to perish and go to ruin.

But what needs it with words to express this, as if he had not
sufficiently manifested whereunto his proceedings have tended, showing it being
blinded with his most insatiable presumptiousnes and desire of vain glory: as
in a token of a Tropheum or sign of victory in his notorious proceedings, as
before rehearsed, has caused to be erected within the castle of Andwarpe, a
brason Image standing upon the nobility and states of the country. We leave
now vnrehearsed what his meaning was thereby, but when, or where, has it been
seen that any Tirant in his life time has caused any such Image to be
erected. We find that the Roman Emperors and Kings, which in a manner had
brought the whole world under their subjection, have sometimes caused to be
erected Images of brass, and stone: as at this present the Popes of Room who
pretend to be God his vicar, yet it is done by ordinance and consent of the
counsel, and commons, or at the least by their advise and suffrance: but that
they in their life time have done such, is not to be found by any examples or
Cronicles, considering it to be a manifest token of mad arrogantie and
insupportable pride: we find only that Nabucho donozar who caused him self to
be honored as a God, set up the like Image, commanding all men to kneel and
bow unto the same: yet durst he not do it but by consent of the chief and
nobles of his country.

But this Tirant does as well in his presumpteous arrogantie as in execrable
tiranie surpass al other tirants: who as though he would not only advance
himself to the room of the king, but likewise in God his place: has without
the advice, counsel, or ordinance of any, in his life time erected this proud
Image, to the defacing and emparing of your Majesty's dignity, showing thereby
his force and tyranny wherewith he has subdued and brought under foot these
countries.

And in like manner he has not been afraid following the example of the tirant
Herod: to place himself upon the market place of Andwarpe in your Majesty's
stool and cloth of estate: which never had been touched by any Liuetenant
before, sitting there representing the absence of your Majesty, as an Idol,
and under pretense of publishing of a pardon: which never Queen, Duke, or any
Governors or Gouernaunts of these countries have done the like: tending to the
manifest disestimation and abasing of your Majesty's honor and dignity.

These proceedings, most sovereign king are become so apparent and evident
unto all the world, that all strange nations, and Potentates, have a terror
and execration thereat* insomuch as even the Duke of Alba his soldiers, and
servants, do protest and say, that they can not esteem such for good, much
less that the service of your Majesty, and welfare of the country, should
therein consist.

Besides that we can not think that your Majesty being thereof sufficiently
and truly infourmed, would permit such forces and violences, for it was never
heard that any King or Potentate, has so unmercifully dealt with his subjects:
your Majesty's auncetours of most famous memory, have in most mild and gentle
manner behaved themselves toward their subjects, that they have thereof given
a most laudable example not only to their successors, but also to other
Christian Princes, Dukes, and rulers, that whenever any discention was risen
between the subjects and Magestrates, by reason of misgouernement, and taken
arms in hand: and being again brought under obedience by their Lords and
rulers, were never molested with these examples of cruelty, but by express
capitulation from word, to word, confirmed all their privileges and liberties,
and the same to enjoy their full effect.

So as we should greatly wrong your Majesty, if we should persuade our
selves that your Majesty were so far diuerted from the example of your
predecessors, and from the duty of all other Christian Princes and
Potentates, that in stead of ministering right and Justice to your obedient
subjects, and giving audience to their most pitiful complaints, should send
such a tirant in such sort cruelly to murder the^, destroying the country,
and burthening your subjects with most intolerable slavery, servitude, and
thraldom.

And now the said Duke presenting unto us his fained pardons, under the name of
your Majesty for our rebellions and misdemeanors (as he terms them) we
could not accept the same without depriving of your Majesty's dignity.

Knowing well that your Majesty will not, before having heard the justness of
our cause condemn us of rebellion. Where is there any that justly has
infourmed your Majesty of our dealings, or when did ever your Majesty give
ear unto any, but such as were our manifest enemies? Reason requires both
parts to be heard, before sentence should be pronounced. And therefore in the
Cronicles of Alexander the great, is much commended: who whenever he heard
any parties, leaned with his head upon his shoulders with one of his ears
closed, and being asked why he so did, answered that the later party ought
as well have audience as the first, which order has always been had in
estimation of all nations, as being conformable to all natural rightes. So as
no offendour, what grievous crimes so ever he had committed shall be judged or
condemned, but that he shall first answer unto such accusations as are
alleged against him.

Now most merciful and sovereign Lord and King, we do most humbly prostrate
our selves under the foot of your Majesty, most heartily requesting the same,
that it would please your Grace to bend toward us one ear, and (as in a
balance) equally to weye our estates. Your Majesty has by posts, letters,
and other means ben informed of this present estate, and our mouths have been
closed up, our tongues pearsed with red burning Irons, and our lips seared up
with burning tongues, because we should not give our necessity to understand.
The ways have as yet ben taken from us, so that our lamentable cries could
never come unto, or pearse the ears of your Majesty.

How then can your Majesty condemn us of rebellion (which always we have had
in hatred) because that the Duke of Alba does seek to bring us under his
subjection with his letters of pardon, and we nothing esteeming of the same:
which he perceiving and that with force he cannot (by God his providence)
prevail, we cannot therefore accept his said letters as being directed to us
who never strayed from your obedience, except it were that we would take and
acknowledge the Duke of Alba for our King: for him only have we resisted and
not your Majesty, whom we with life and goods (so long as it shall please God
to permit us ye same) will faithfully serve and obey. And therefore his pardon
does nothing touch us, which tends only to the Towns which have been seduced
from the Kings obedience. But we mark his intent, knowing that either he
would be king himself, or else that we by entiseme^t of his subtle pardons
should condemn our selves. For we receiving pardon, must acknowledge our
selves gilty of commotions and rebellion against our King, of tumult and
sedition, yea of heresy and declyning from the Christian faith, and in fine,
to the depriuinge of the honor of God and the Kings majesty. This is his
seeking, that by receiving of his false and feigned pardons, we should by our
subsignations and seals confirm the same, to the intent that he hereafter
might thereby defend and excuse himself of tyranny before your Majesty and
all other christian Princes and Potentates, saying, that if we had not found
ourselves culpable in these grievous offenses for which we were punished and
tormented, we would never have received any remiss or pardon.

Wherein we take God, the searcher and knower of all hearts, and your Majesty
to witness, that if we have committed any such offenses, as by the said
pardon are laid to our charge, that we do altogether refuse all pardon, but
desire as the most wickedst and vylest creatures on earth, to make
satisfaction for our offenses with our blood, and do not refuse, O most
merciful King, one after an other, to suffer most extreme torments, if it may
be found that we have offended in such order as is presumed.

And do request the Duke of Alba, (if any petition will take place with him)
that all such as come to him for pardon, acknowledging the pretended offense,
that he without showing of mercy, do entreat them in such sort as their
offenses (according to right) have deserved, commending him therein in gyuing
or mayntayning any faith or credit with him as one so unfaithful to God and
his King, as has not ben abashed so greatly too abuse and contempne their
Majesty's.

But what is it, it shall not be found that ever we have thought any such
matter, much less in effect showed the same. We have always been faithful
and seruiseable to our King, and sought to serve God, the father of our Lord
Jesus Christ in spirit and truth, according to his word and commaundment, so
far as our feeble nature would permit, even to the last drop of our blood.

But considering that the Duke of Alba in stead of executing equity and
Justice, and hearing of their complaints and greefes, and persecutinge of your
majesty's promises, has contrary to all right and reason, and our rightes and
privileges, suppressed us with most cruel tyranny, destroyed our Countries,
and used us more severely, then ever Jews or Turks have done against their
vanquished enemies. And in the mean space, has he accused us to your
Majesty, and al other christian Potentates with false accusations of rebellion
and heresy: and we never could come to our answer, or receive any comfort in
the universal world. So as by necessity we have been forced to take the arms
in hand, and by all means possible sought to defend our poor native Country
from such execrable tyranny: and rather wc one accord to spend our lives,
then to fall into the hands of such a Tyrant: wherein we mean to persiste,
except that it please your Majesty with merciful cares to attend to our
complaints, and minister to us Justice against such oppression and tyranny.
For God be thanked, we are not so il instructed in his word, but that we know
very well, that as well our life as death consists in his hands, and that
this death which no man can escape, is but as a ready path too the life
everlasting.

Therefore, seeing our death may be a pleasure to other, we choose rather to
dye an honorable death in the behalf of the liberties and common weal of our
Country, the^ to fall into such servitude, and become footestooles unto most
arrogant aliants, who always have hated us. For at the least we shall thereby
leave to our successors such a good fame, as it may be said, that their
Predecessors had rather with renown to dye with honor, then live in all
bondage and shame.

We contend for the liberty of our consciences, in defense of our wives and
children, our blood and goods, that is to say, whether the Duke of Alba with
his accomplices shall according to his self will be a Lord and Governor, or
that we to the behoof of your Majesty, O most Sovereign King, shall defend
it from him. We know that the limits of our lives are set, and shall not by the
pardon of the Duke of Alba surpass the same. Therefore we only desire your
Majesty, that it may please the same to weye and consider our cases, and not
to suffer, that we by accepting such pardones, should for ever be reputed as
rebels to God and our King, which we never thought.

For we are fully persuaded, yt although we had received those pardons, yet
would it nothing have prevailed for safegarde of our lives, for thereby the
Duke of Alba might have had the better action against us the proceeded with
most seueritye, and might had better have answered for himself, if we and
confessed our selves gilty of rebellion, both against God and the King his
Majesty. For then no man would have moned us, although we had been slain and
murdered as disturbers of the peace and common wealth and not worthy to live.

And although it were not so, yet it is apparent by all the Duke of Alba his
proceedinges, that he means to observe no faith with us, for seeing that he
has openly perpetrated the oath which the Duches of Parma, with all the Lords
and governors of the country, in the name of your Majesty, had sworn so
solemply to these towns: yet has he in these latter wars, sufficiently
expressed his perverse meaning in diverse towns, as at Mons in Henauld has he
contrary to his oath, caused a number of Burgeses to be hanged, at Naerdon he
has executed his cruelty in such a sort as in a town of like bigness has not
ben hard of: and now at Harlem has he or at ye least in his name, Don
Frederico assured the soldiers of their lives, and thereunto certain Lords as
pledges they bound themselves: and yet has he eue^ to the young paiges, caused
them to be murdered one with another, and their naked carcasses to the
scandale of all women, and virgins, left lying upon the scaffold a day and a
night. And such as had consented to the delivery of the town, and were entered
into his service, has he caused to be carried to the Galies, and upon the
Fuycke before Harlem when he had promised the soldiers their lives, suffered
them to perish with hunger, saying: that he had assured them of their lives,
and not of meat and drink. As also the Burgeses of Harlem, whom he had
assured their lives, has he compelled to be Myners before the town of Alkmar,
where they are by the inhabitants slain: which does pass all barbarous
tyranny and cruelty, and is a most manifest token wherewith he seeks to
maintain his untrue proceedinges.

So that it is evident that he means not to observe any oaths or promises,
but for a small time: to the intent he might the better have his will of
others, and because he might the better hereafter defend his case, against
your Majesty, and other Princes, does produce this pardon, for if we do accept
the same we must needs acknowledge our selves guilty of such offenses, as he
lays to our charge* and is not bound to the observing of any oath: for by the
counsel holden at Constance, it was above ij. hunderd years enacted that no
faith is to be kept with heretics.

For whereas he does in his pardon subtly allege that such offenses as have
been committed, were done more upon evil suggestin, and evil will, then of
their own nature and enclination. This is but a subtle policy, wherewith he
meant to disceaue the simple, and bring them under his yoke: and to furnish
himself of power to suppress all such as he thinks good, and that without
reproach of any, seeing that it stands in his judgment who has offended, the
premises or not.

But once consider most sovereign King, how that the righteous GOD has
deceived this subtle dealer in his procedings, for in this pardon wherein he
pretends most grievously to accuse us, he does by express words confess,
that he can by no means think that we could not have been so altered or
changed, but upon evil suggestion or else we should have continewed in all
faith and willingness, which we always have showed to your Majesty.

For if it be so, that we before this last offense (as he terms it) have
showed to your Majesty all obedience as he himself witnesses? Why has he
then used such cruelty and persecution? Wherefore has he in such sort
distroyed the towns, burned the the villages, and places: murdered the
inhabitants, and spoiled the^ of all their goods, has not he by his soldiers
by fire consumed Catwicke upon Zea, Sandwicke and Alfen, and that long before
these transgressions, whereof he complayneth, were begone. Did not they pretend
to set fire on the town of Vtrecht, which was so well addicted unto them, have
not they in Rotterdam, where as they were received as friends, cruelly
murdered a number of Burgeses, was not found by Pacheco a bill of innumerable
number, as well of the nobility, as most substantial commons in sundry and
diverse towns, which by commandment of the Duke should have been murdered,
if matters by Gods provision had not altered. And whereunto tended the demand
of the tenth penie, to none other end but that we should at his hands buy our
goods, which he pretended to be confiscated: whereby it appears that he and
his adherents are sworn enemies unto your Majesty: whilst he does in such
sort execute his tyranny, murder, burning, and with such force and servitude,
does agreeue us your subjects, whom he himself does allege to have been most
faithful unto your majesty. So as through necessity we have been compelled to
enter into arms to resist his force and tyranny: which his servants could not
deny, who diverse times have said that they would so long vex and trouble this
country and inhabitants thereof, that in the end they should be forced to
rebel, and so have occasion to bring it under subjection, and spoil the same
of all their substance: which is to be approved by some letters, whereby was
written, that this it was for which they longed. It is very true most
sovereign King, that the Duke does hear allege, as that your subjects would
never had rebelled, but upon suggestion of certain evil disposed, which evil
disposed are none other then the Duke himself, with his bloody counsel, and
sanguine adherents, which of meare set, evil will, and insatiable avarice,
have sucked the sweat and blood of your subjects, and of long time so
earnestly persecuted, and grieved to the uttermost, that they for defense of
themselves, their wives, children, and all that which in this world they do
esteem of, have been forced to take arms in hand: Therefore where as he
presumes that he has so lovingly dealt with other towns, take example by
Tourn^y, Valencien, Lysle, Jpre, Maestricht, Deuenter, and likewise by Machlin,
Oudenard, Dermonde, and Naerden, where they have by murdering, robbing,
hanging, rauishing of women, and with diverse outrages persecuted the poor
commons.

Besides this has there been murdered at Bruxels at sundry times above CC.
and xxx. Burgeses, and that long before the beginning of these wars, as also
in a commotion at Gaunt, which happened amongst the Spaniards, where of the
commons have been slain LX. or LXX. besides an infinite number of men and
women* which at sundry times have been murdered, which we leave to enlarge
here seeing those their proceedinges are accounted merciful dealings besides
other most wicked insolences used in the said towns.

And therefore he needs not to threaten us, that if we do not accept his
pardon, that no rigor which may be devised, shall be left unexercised toward
our persons, by desolation, honger and sword, in such sort, as no remembrance
shall be left of them present. For we are certain, that here about he has
sought as much as is to him possible: and would undoubtedly have used further
cruelty (whereof he boasts so much) if the fear which he has, that the
Countries would not any longer abide his cruelty, had not let him.

He does not so much esteem the service of your Majesty, nor regards your
heritage and countries, as that he would abstayn from ruining and destroying
the same: yea utterly to root out the relics and memories thereof, so far
as it were to him possible, as the burning and desolating which he before
these wars, has used, do sufficiently bear witness. But we trust that
the almighty God will never suffer y^ your Majesty should permit your
Countries altogether to fall into the force of such a Tyrant and destroyer.

For, whereas he here alleges that we have put on arms against your
Majesty: that we utterly deny. For we proteste before your Majesty, yea
before God and his Angels, that our meaning or pretense was never such. For
we will adue^tur our selves and all that we have in this world, as likewise we
have don toward your Majesty's predecessors, with life and goods to stand to
ye defense of your majesty against al your enemies and ill willers.

But this we will acknowledge before the universal world, that (being
thereunto extremely constrained) we have taken arms in hand against the
tyranny and abuses of the Duke of Alba and his co^plices, to deliver our lives
and goods, wives and children from the bloudthirstie hands of his ministers:
and if he do prevail against us, rather choose to dye an honorable death,
and leave a fame to our successors, then to yield and bow to such a tyrant,
and suffer our country to live under unsupportable slavery. So else we should
be abashed and ashamed too show our faces in any other Countries, as having
neglected the service of your Majesty. And therefore have all the Towns
ioinctly and severally taken in hand and sworn the one after the other, to
abide al sieges, if need be, to the uttermost, though to the loss of their
lives and goods: yea rather set fire of our own howses, the^ to yield to the
force of this Tyrant.

For we are well assured, that at the hands of such a Tyrant, as regards no
oath, and has so often and cruelly threatened us, there is no more to be looked
for, but that he would rather color the rivers and streams with our blood, and
to behange the country with our bodies, to satiate his bloudthirsty lust and
appetite.

Therefore we prostrate our selves before the feet of your Majesty, desiring
the same for GOD his sake, who has set ye Crown upon your head, and given
the Scepter into your hand once to bow your ears to our reasonable
complayntes. We do not desire to be dissolved from the obedience of your
Majesty, but only that we may have our consciences free to Godwarde, to hear
his holy word, and to follow the same, to the intent to give an account at the
day of Judgment of our souls, and that we may atcheue such discharge for our
miserable native Country, which always has done such faithful service to
your Majesty, from the yoke and bondage of forayne Nations and Spanish
Souldioures, and to suffer the Country to enjoy those liberties, privileges
and customs, as your Majesty, and the most puissant Emperor Charles, your
Majesty's most noble father (of famous memory) have to your Subjects
solemply sworn.

Then will we at the commandment of your Majesty lay down our weapons and
arms, and will venture body, goods, and all that we have in the world, in the
service of your majesty by water or by land, where and whenever your
Majesty shall command the same: and your Majesty shall find that we are
not altered or abastarded from you, but rarher that we do excel in
faythefull service, all our predecessors, which hereby we do promise and
swear to your maistie, beseeching eue^ as we do faithfully mean it, so to
take mercy of our souls.

Desiring that this our declaration and oath be openly published and declared
to all Kings, Potentates, Lords and Nations, to the intent they may know that
we are no Rebels toward our King, for we never learned such of our
predecessors: But that we of mere force and necessity have been constrained
to take on arms against the enemies and usurpers of his majesty's name.

Requesting therefore all christen Princes and Potentates, yt they will be moved
with a pytyfull compassion of our miseries, (and much doubting that this our
supplication and declaration shall be kept back and suppressed as other our
former Requests have been, and not come to our Kings hands:) that they will
thereof inform his Majesty, to the intent our just cause may come to light,
and that his Majesty may be acquitted of the innocent blood which this Albanish
Tyrant does shed. This we heartily desire, and we all will pray unto
almighty GOD, for their prosperity to remain for ever.

FINIS.
