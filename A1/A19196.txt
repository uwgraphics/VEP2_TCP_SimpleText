The Complaint of a Sinner.
To the tune of the bonny broom.


CHrist is my love he loved me.
when I was wretch forlorn
True God from all eternity,
true man of Virgiu borne:
He pierced the Heaveno, be came to earth,
for me his blood to spill:
Yet through my sins I have him lost,
woe worth my froward will:
The bonny Broom, the well favored Broom
the broom bloomes fair on hill:
Him have I lost that loved me best,
my love against his will.
My crooked ways, my words profane,
My thoughts to evil inclinue,
Has made this Love to lightly me,
and show himself unkind
Thus do I spend my days in care,
my nights in mourning still:
For loosing him that loved me best,
(...)ite my froward will.
(...) (...) ome, etc.
^ Sweet Christ my love, I must confess,
the cause of all my pain.
Has been my own bistoy all heart,
that would not true remain:
But sought for pleasure here below,
that soul and body kill:
And brake my promise made to thee,
alas my froward will.
The bonny broom, etc.
Long have I dwelt in Kedars tents,
and long in Meshech bidden:
And from thy presence full of joy,
my feet have long time slidden,
Yet on my barren heart O Lord,
some drops of grace distill:
That I may find thy love again,
and change my froward will.
The bonny broom, etc.
Oh, let me sorrow for my sin,
and hate my ruthful race,
Oh let my silly soul (...),
the favor o^ thy face:
Till thou forget thine unkindness,
and I my mourning still,
And with a free reformed heart,
renounce my froward will.
The bonny broom, etc.
