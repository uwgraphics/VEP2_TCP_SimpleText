The Epistle dedicatorie. To the most Mundifying, Clarifying, Purifying, and
Repurifying, Cleanser, Clearer, and Reformer of Deformed and polluted Linen,
Martha Leg Esquiresse, transparent, unspotted, Snow-Lillywhite Laundresse to
the Right worshipful and generous the Innes of Court, of the middle Temple,
with diverse others in the rank of Nobility, Gentilitie, and tranquillity,
your poor and unknown Poetical Orator John Tailor, in humility and
seruilitie, craves your Patronages ability, in defense of his imbecilitie.
MOst cleanely and professed Antagonist to vermin, dirte, and filth, as
Dragmatus the Diagorian Stigmatist very worthily wrote in his treatise of the
antiquity of Shapparoones and careless Bands; Rushto^ ton tumeron smolensco

Membranes, intermixed with Te^nons, embost with Ankles, having a Neat Foot for
a Man, and five Toes for Pages to attend it. More for the honor of Legs;
what is better meat then the Legs of Beife, Mutton, Lamb, Porke, Capon,
Turkey, Goose or Woodcocke? Nay, there is such virtue in them, that any
reasonable Cook with a Stools Leg (and something else) will make good
broth. To finish my prolixious short briee, and tedious dedication, I wish
that you and your Husband in conjugal combintion, in the way of Procreation,
may multiply and make Legs, which is a part of good Manners and Cortesie,
whereof these unmannerly times almost barren. Thus referring my ^se and my
labors to be accepted and censured according to the purity and integrity of
both your reforming functions, with my prayers for the clean amendment of all
soulers of Linen, and the reforming of all bad Legs for the better
supportation of Washers, Starchers and Translaters I remain,

A comely cleanly Shirt unto his back.
Clean Linen, is my Mistress, and my Theme
Flows, like an ouer-flowing plenteous stream,
But first I will discover what I mean
By this same seemly word, which men call Clean:
As Titans light's offenciue to the Owl,
So Clean is opposite to what is foul:
Yet (in the Air) some flying Foul there are,
Which taken, and cleanly dressed, are Foul clean fare,
But fowly dressed, when it is fairly took:
Foul is that Foul, a foul ill take that Cook.
But to the word called Clean, it is allotted,
The admirable Epithet Unspotted,
From whence all soylde pollution is exiled,
And therefore Clean is called undefiled:
It Is fair, it is clarified, it is mundifide,
And from impuritye is purifide.
But to be truly Clean is such a state
As gains the Noble Name immaculate:
And I wish all mankind the grace might win
To be (as here I mean) all Clean within.
As it is no grace a man a man to be,
If outward form want inward honesty:
^o Linen if with (Clean) it be not graced,
It Is noisome, loathsome, and it gives distaste.
A^ Virtue man or woman does adorn,
So (Clean) is Linnens virtue; and is women
For pleasure, proffit, and for ornament,
Throughout the Worlds most spacious continent.
Much more of this word (Clean) might here be writ,
But tediousness is enemy to wit,
Clean Linen now my verse descends to thee,
Thou that preordinated were to be
Our Corpse first Cover, at our naked Birth:
And our last Garment when we turn to Earth.
So that all men Clean Linen should epsy,
As a memento of mortallitie:
And that a Sheet unto the greatest State,
Is the Alpha and Omega of his Fate.
As at our Births Clean Linen does attend us;
So does it all our whole lives Race befriend us,
Abroad, at home, in Church or commonwealth;
At bed, or Board, in sickness and in health.
It figures forth the Churches purity,
And Spotless Doctrine, and integrity:
Her State Angellicall, whate innocence;
Her Nursing love, and bright magnificence.
Yet some for linen do the Church forsake,
And do a Surplice for a (...) bear take.
But always to the Chur^^ bring mine ears.
Not eyes, to note what Robes Churchme^ wears.
Now from the Church let us return but home,
And there the Cloth is laid against you come,
Though raging hunger make the Stomach wroath
^is half assuaged by laying of the Cloth.
For in the wars of eating, it is the use
A Table of cloth is hungers flagge of Truce:
Whilst in the fight the Napkins are your friends
And wait upon you, at your fingers ends.
Your Dinner and your Supper ouer-past
By Linen in your beds, you are embraced,
Then, twixt the sheets refreshing rest you take,
And turn from side to side, and sleep, and wake:
And sure the sheets in every Christian Nation
Are walls or limits of our generation,
For where desire, and love, combined meets
Then there is brave doings twixt a pair of sheets:
But where a Harlots lust does entertain,
There one sheets penance, bides the shames of twain
To all degrees my counsel here is such
That of the Lower sheet, take not too much.
As from our beds we often do cast our eyes,
Clean Linen yields a shirt before we rife,
Which is a garment Shifting in condition
And in the Canting tongue is a Commission:
In weal or woe, in joy or dangerous drifts
A shirt will put a man unto his shifts.
For unto it belongs this fatal lot
It makes him shift that has or has it not.
The man that has a shirt does shift and change
And he that has no shirt does shift and raunge,
So the conclusion of this point must fall,
He shifteth most that does not shift at all.
Besides, a shirt, most magically can
Tell if it is owner be an honest man:
The washing will his honesty bewraye,
For, the less soape will wash his shirt they say,
Most men, Clean shirts at such esteem do prise
That the poor'st thief who at the gallows dies
If but his shirt is Clean, his mind is eased,
He hanges the hansomer, and better pleased.
Next at the smock I needs must have a flirte
(which is indeed the sister to a shirt)
It Is many a females Linen tenement,
Whilst twixt the quarters she receive herrent.
A smock's her storehouse, or her warehouse rather
where she her co^mings in does take and gather.
Hit gains by it are more then can be told,
It Is her revenue, and her coppy-hold,
Her own fee simple, she alone has power
To let and set at pleasure every hour.
It Is a commodity that gives no day,
It Is taken up, and yet yields ready pay,
But for most other wares, a man shall be
Allowed for payment days three months and three.
Yet has a smock this great pre-eminence
(Where honor's mixed with modest Innocence)
It is the Robe of married chastity,
The veil of Heauen-belou'd Virginity,
The chaste concealeme^t of those fruits close hidden
Which to unchaste affections are forbidden,
It is the Casket or the Cabinet
where Nature has her chiefest Jewels set:
For what so ere men toil for, far and nere
By s^a or land, with danger, cost, and fear,
Wars wrinkled brow, and the smooth face of peace
Are both to serve the Smock, and its increase.
The greatest Kings, and wisest Counselors,
Stout Soldiers, and most sage Philosophers:
The welthiest Merchants, and Artificers,
Pleibeians, and Plough-toyling laborers,
All these degrees, and more have wooed and praide,
And always to the Smock their tributes paid.
Besides, it is taken for a favor great,
(When one his mistress kindly does entreat)
He holds these words as Jewels dropped from her,
You first shall do as does my Smock sweet Sir.
This Theme of Smock is very large and wide,
And might (in Verse) be further amplifide:
But I think best a speedy end to make
Least for a Smel-smocke some should me mistake,
I first began it with a flirt or floute
And ending, with a mock, I will go out.
The An^gram of SMOCK I find is MOCKES,
And I conclude a pox of all strait Smockes.
Now up aloft I mount unto the Ruff,
W^^ch into foolish mortals pride does puff:
Yet Ruffes antiquity is here but small,
Within this eighty years, not one at all,
For the ^ighth Henry, (as I understand)
Was the first King that ever wot a Band,
And but a falling Band, plain with a hem,
All other people knew no use of them,
Yet Imitation in small time began
To grow, that it the Kingdom ouer-ran:
The little Falling-bands encreac'd to Ruffes,
Ruffes (growing great) were waited on by Cuffes,
And though our frailties should awake our care,
We make our Ruffes as careless as we are:
Our Ruffes unto our faults compare I may,
Both careless, and grown greater every day.
A Spaniards Ruff in follio, large and wide,
Is th'abstract of Ambitions boundles pride,
For roundnes it is the Emblem, as you see
Of the terrestrial Globes rotunditie,
And all the world is like a Ruff to Spain,
Which does encircle his aspiring brain,
And his unbounded pride does still persist,
To have it set, and poaked as he list.
The sets to Organ-pipes, compare I can
Because they do offend the Puritan,
Whose zeal does call it superstition
And Badges of the Beast of Babylon.
Ruffes only at the first were in request
With such as of ability were best:
But now the plain, the stich'd, the laced, and shagge,
Are at all prises women by tagge, and Ragge.
So Spain (who all the world would wear) shall see
Like Ruffes, the world from him shall scatred be.
A^ for the Cuffe it is pretily encreac'd
(Since it began two hand-fuls at the least)
At first 'twas but a girdle for the wrist
Or a small circle to enclose the fifth,
Which has by little and by little crept.
And from the wrist unto the elboe leap't,
Which does resemble saucy persons well:
For give a Knave an inch, heel take an ell.
Ruffes are to Cuffes, as 'twere the breeding mothers
And Cuffes are twins in pride, or two proud brothers,
So to conclude, Pride wears them for abuse
Humility, for omament and use,
A Nightcap is a garment of high state,
which in captivity does captiuate
The brain, the Reason, wit, and sense and all;
And every night does bear sway capital.
And as the horn above the head is worn.
So is the Nightcap worn above the horn,
And is a Sconce or Blocke-house for the head,
wherein much matter is considered,
And therefore (when too much we suck the tap)
It Is truly called a considering Cap.
By day it waytes on Agues, Plurisies,
Consumptions and all other malladies,
A day worn Nightcap, in our Commonwealth
Does show the wearer is not well in health,
Yet some men's folly makes my muse to smile
When for a kib'de heel, broken shin, or bile,
Scab'd hams, cut fingers, or a little scarr,
A Groyne Bumpe, or a Goose from Winchester,
When I see Night-caps worn for these poor uses
It makes my worship laugh at their abuses.
Thus is a Nightcap most officious,
A Captain, Captious, and Capritio^u,
And though unmarried young men may forbear it
Yet age, and wedlock makes a man to wear it.
A Handkercheife may well be called in breife
Both a perpetual leacher, and a thief,
About the lips it is kissing, good and ill
Or else it is diuing in the pocket still,
As far as from the pocket to the mouth
So is it is pilgrimage with age or youth.
At Christning-banquets and at funerals
At weddings (Comfite-makers festiuals)
A Handkercheife does filch most manifold,
And sharke and steal as much as it can hold.
It Is soft, and gentle, yet this I admire at
At sweet meats it is a tyrant, and a pyrat.
Moreover it is a Handkercheifes high place
To be a Scauenger unto the face,
To cleanse it clean from sweat and excrements,
Which (not avoided) were unsavory sents;
And in our grieifes it is a trusty friend
^or in our sorrow it does confort lend:
It does partake our sighs, our plaintes and fears,
Receaues our sobs, and wipes away our tears.
Thus of our good and bad it bears a share
A friend in mirth a conforter in care.
Yet I have often known unto my cost
A Handkercheife is quickly found, and lost.
Like love where true affection has no ground,
So is it slightly lost, and lightly found;
But be it tentimes lost, this right I Will do it,
The fault is his or hers that should look to it.
Should I of every sort of Linen write
That serves us at our need, both day and night,
Days, months and years, I in this Theme might spend,
And in my life time scarcely make an end.
Let it suffice that when it is fretted out
And that a cloth is worn into a clout,
Which though it be but thin and poor in shape
A Surgeon into lint the same will scrape,
O^r l^es* or bolsters, or with plaster spread,
To dress and cure, all hurts from heel to head,
For gangrenes, ulcers, or for wound^ new hacked
For cuttes, and slashes, and for Coxcombes cracked
Thus many a Gallant that dares stab and swagger
And against a Justice lift his fiste or dagger:
And being mad perhaps* and hot pot-shot,
A crazed Crown or broaken-pate has got;
Then over him old Linen domineeres,
And ^^ht of s teeth it cloutes him bout the ears
Thus new or old, it has these good effects
To cure our hurts, or cover our defects:
And when it selfe's past ^elpe, with age and rending
Quite past self me^^ing, it is our means ^f me^ding.
The sh^t and steel will strike bright sparkling fire,
But how can we have fire at our desire,
Except old Linen be to tinder burnd,
Which by the steel and flint to fire is turned?
Thus all Clean Linen that a Laundresse washes,
My Muse has worn to clowtes, or turned to ashes.
And there is the end on it. Now I must pursue
(The old consumed) how to purchase new.
Now of the lovely Laundresse, whose clean trade
Is the only cause that Linnens cleanely made:
Her living is on two extremes relying,
She Is ever wetting, or she is ever drying.
As all men dye to live, and live to dye,
So does she dry to wash, and wash to dry.
She runs like Luna in her circled sphere,
As a perpetual motion she does steare.
Her course in compass ro^nd and endless still,
Much like a horse that labors in mill:
To show more plain how she her work does frame,
Our Linnen's foul ere she does wash the same:
From washing further in her course she marches,
She wrings, she folds* she pleites, she smooths, she starches,
She stiffe^s, poakes, and sets and dry again,
And fold: thus end of pain begins her pain.
Round like a whirligigge or lenten Top
O^ a most plenteous spring, that still does drop
The Suddes unto the Sea I may compare
The Reake or smock, the wind, the fishes Linen are
The Laun^resse fishes, foaming froth does lighten,
The w^^st her tongue does thunder and affrighten.
The total is a tempest full of chiding
^^^t no man in the house has quiet byding,
For Laundresses are testy and full of wroth,
When they are lathering in their bumble broth,
No^ can I blame the^ though they brawle and talk,
M^^ there have naught to do, they may go walk:
Yet commonly their work this profit brings
The g^od-wife washes, and her husband wrings.
B^t though my vearse thus merrily does straye,
Yet give the Laundresse still her due I pray:
What were the painful Spinner, or the Weauer
B^t for her labor, and her good endeavor,
What were the function of the Linen Draperye,
Or Sempsters admirable skill in Naperye?
They all might turn and wind, and live by loss
But that the Laundresse gives their work a gloss,
All Linn n that we use to wear, it is plain,
The Laundresse labor gives it grace and gain,
Without her it is most loathsome in distaste
And only by her pains and toil it is graced,
She is the ornamentall Instrument
That makes it tastefull to the sight and sent:
All you man-monsters, monstrous Linen soilers,
You shirt polluting tyrants, you sheets spoilers,
Robusti^^^ rude Ruff rending raggamentoyes
Terratritorian tragma Troynouantoyes
Remember that your Laundresse pains is great,
Whose labors only keeps you sweet and neat:
Consider this, that here is writ, or said
And pay her, (not as was the Sculler paid)
Call not your Laundresse slut or slabb'ring queen,
It is her slabb'ring that does keep thee clean,
Nor call her not Drye-washer in disgrace
For fear she cast the suddes into thy face:
By her thy Linnen's sweet and cleanely dressed,
Else thou would stink above ground like a beast.
There is a bird which men Kings fisher call,
Which in foul weather has no joy at all,
Or scarce abroad into the air does peep
But in her melancholy nest does keep:
Till Tytans glory from the burnished East,
Rich Bridegroome-like in gold and purple dressed
Guilds, and enamels mountains, woods and hillles,
And the rotundious Globe with splendour filles,
In these brave Buksome merry Halcion days,
The^ this most bewteous bird her plumes displaies.
So does a Lauudresse, when the Sun does hide
His head, when skies weep rain and thunder chide,
When powting, lowering s^^^^ering s^eete and now,
From foggy Austers blushing jaws does blow,

King of the G^thes waste (...) ^^cked Rome, and stooke all the Kingdoms of the
earth into a I^^er (...), when there was inhabiting (...) D^kedome of Tus^anye
a valiant Captain named Ca^ss, descended from the Roy all house of ^^^gus the
first King of the ^^tag^ans. This Cats^ being driven (...) sh^t^s in these

he took his leave, and sailing through the str^ts of ^^br^lt^^, and the gulf
of (...) ^an^, he past the (...) Espe^an^e, as far as China, where be stand
certain days at (...) then he determined to progress it by land, and
passing by the great City of Tarsus in (...), by long iourneys he came to
Gal^^^, where ne^^ the G^^^ne he was in hot seemee, and came off ^oru^ewhat
scorch^d, with fireworkes in a mine: passing from thence be came into France
where he was well well com^d at Breast, and at the Town of Deip^, was made
great provision for his coming; but for some reasons he would never came
there. In brief after he had approu^d himself a hot, valiant and aduenturous
Soldier abroad, and a peace^a^er at home, he came into Ireland, where at
Dubblin he was struck lame; but ^coue^ing new^ strength and courage, he ^ip^d
himself for ^^^^and, la^ded at ^^st Chester, whence taking post toward
London he lodg^d at Ho^ey in the ^ole, in his way, at last being corn to the
City, he made many merry and mad vag^^es betwixt Turne^ull-streete and
Brunt-prood, spending freely, and faring deliciously; having a stiff stomach
to digest all dishes except Winche^ter Geese, and Newmarket Turkies: thus with
much danger and difficulty having travailed farther then ever man saw, and
passed his time with much love amongst Ladies and Gentlewomen, having been a
great withstander of many desperate oppositions, and a rare Musician for his
long practice in Pricke-s^ng. He again past the Sea in a Frigget to C^^st^^tin
^le, where he fell into a moody melane ^oly like Tymon of Athenes and scorned
to ^and at any ^^me, although he was charged in the name of the Graund
S^g^^^r. This Gallant having been all his time a great vser wearer^, and taker
up of Napery, did most bountifully bequeath to any Poe^ that would write a
Poem in the praise o^ Clean ^innen, as many shirts of the pures^ Holland as
might be washed in Hellicon, and dried on the two topt hill of Parnassus. To
perform whose command, and receive the bequeathed Legacy, I undertook this
great task, and performed it accordingly.

FINIS.
