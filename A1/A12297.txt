Here after follows a little book, which has to name, why come ye not to
court, compyled by master Skeleton poet Laureate.

All noble men of this take heed And believe it as your Creed.
TO hasty of sentence
To ferce for none offense
To scarce of your expense
To large in negligence
To slack in recompense
To haute in excellence
To light intellegence
And to light in credence
where these keep resydence
Reason is banysshed thence
And also dame prudence
with sober sapyence
All noble men. etc.
Than withont collusyon
Mark well this conclusyon
Through such abusyon
And by such Illusyon
Unto great confusyon
Anoble man may fall
And his honor appall
And if ye think this shall
Not rub you on the gall
Than the devil take all. etc.
He va^es ille, de quo loqu^tur mill
Why come ye not to court?
^ Or age is a page
For the court full unmeet
For age can not rage
Nor basse her sweet sweet
But when age sees that rage
Does aswage and refrain
Than will age have a courage
To come to court again
But
Helas / sage ouerage
So madly decays
That age for dottage
Is reco^^ed now adays
Thus age agraunt damage
Is nothing set by
And rage in a rerage
Loathe rynne lam^ntably
So
That rage must make ^yllage
To catch that catch may
And with such forage
Hunte the boskage
That hearts will run away
Both hearts and hyndes
With all good minds
Fare well / than have good day
Than have good day a dew
For defaute of rescew
Some men may happily rue
And some their hedes mew
The time does fast ensew
That bales begin to brew
I dread by sweet Jesus
This tale will be to true
In faith dycken thou krew
In faith dicken thou krew. etc.
O Icken / thou krew doutlesse
For trewly to express
There has been much excess
With banketynge braynlesse
With tyotynge rechelesse
With gambaudynge thryftlesse
With spend / and, wast witless
Creatinge of trewse restless
Pratynge for peace peaslesse
They countrynge at Cales
Wrang us on the wales
Chief counselour was carlesse
Gronynge grouchyng graceless
And to none entente
Our talwod is all brent
Our fagottes are all spent
We may blow at the cole
Our mare has cast her fool
And mock has lost her sho
What may she do there to
An end of an old song
Do right and do no wrong
As right as a rams horn
For thrifte is threde bare worn^
Our sheep are shrewdly shorn
And truth is all to torn
Wysdom is laughed to skorne
Fauell is false forsworn
Iauell is nobly borne
Hauell and Haruy hafter
Jack Travel and Cole Crafter
We shall here more herafter
With polling and shauynge
With borowynge and crauyne
With reuynge and rauynge
With swerynge and staring
There vayleth no resonynge
For will does rule all thing
Will / will / will / will / will
He rules always still
Good reason and good skyll
They may garlycke pyll
Carry sackes to the myll
Or pescoddes they may shyll
Or else go roast a stone
There is no man but one
That has the strokes alone
Be it black or whight
All that he does is right
As right as a Cammocke crooked
This byll well over looked
Clearly perceuye we may
There went the hare away
The hare / the fox / the gray
The heart / the hynde / the buch
God send us better luck
God send us better luck. etc.
Twit Andrewe / twit scote
Ge heme / ge scour thy pot
For we have spente our shot
We shall have a tot quot
From the pope of Rome
To weue all in one lome
A web of Lyife wulse
Opus male du^ce
The devil kiss hes cuse
For whiles he does rule
All is warse and warse
The devil kiss his arse
For whether he bless or curse
It can not be much worse
From Baumberow to Botho^bar
We have cast up our war
And mad a worthy trewse
With gup level suse
Our money madly lent
And mor madly spent
From Croydon into Kent
Wot ye whyther they went
From wynchelsey to Rye
And all not worth a fly
From wentbridge to Hull
Our army waxes dull
With turn all home again
And never a scot slain
Yet the good earl of Surray
The french men he does fray
And vexes them day by day
With all the power he may
Tho french men he has faynted
And mad their hertes attaynted
Of cheualry he is the flower
Our lord be his soccoure
The french men he has so mated
And their courage abated
That they are but half men
Like foxes in their den
Like cankerd cowardes all
Like Vrcheons in a stone wall
They keep them in their holds
Like hen herted cokoldes
But yet they over shote us
With crowns and with Scutus
With Scutis and crowns of gold:
I dread we are bought and sold
It is a wonders warke
They shote all at one mark
At the Cardynals hat
Thy shote all at that
Out of their strong towns
They shote at him with crowns
With crowns of gold enblased
They make him so a mased
And his eyes so dased
That he nese can
To know god nor man
He is set so hye
In his Ierarchy
Of frantycke frenesy
And folysshe Fantasy
That in the chamber of sterres
All matters there he marres
Clappyng his rod on the board
No man dare speak a word
For he has all the saying
With out any renayenge
He rolleth in his records
He says / how say ye my lords
Is not my reason good
Good even good Robyn hode
Some say yes. And some
Sit still / as they were dom
Thus thwartyng over thom
He rules all the roste
With bragging and with bost
Borne up on every fyde
With pomp and withpryde
With trompe up Alleluya
For dame Philargera
Has so his heart in hold
He loves nothing but gold
And Asmodeus of hell
Makes his members swell
With Dalyda to mell
That wanton damsel
Adieu philosophia
Aoew Theologia
Welcome dame Simonia
With dame Castrimergia
To drink and for to eat
Sweet ypocrus and sweet meat
To keep his flesh chaste
In lent for a repast
He eats copons stewed
Fesaunt / and partriche mewed
Hens / checkynges / and pigs
He foynes and he frygges
Spares neither maid ne wife
This is a postels life
Helas / my heart is sorry
To tell of vain glory
But now upon this story
I will no further ryme
Till another time
Till another time. etc.
What news what news
Small news y^ true is
That be worth. (...) kues
But at y^ naked stews
I under stand how that
The sign of the Cardynall hat
That Inn is now shyt up
With gup hoar gup / now gup
Gup Guilliam Trauillian
With ^ast you I say Iullian
Will ye bear no coals
A mayny of marefoles
That occupy their holys
^ull of pocky molys
What here ye of Lancashyre
They were not paid their hyre
They are felas any fire
What here ye of Ch^sshyre
They have land all in the mire
They grugyd and said
Their wages were not paid
Some said they were afraid
Of the scortysshe host
For all their crack and bost
Wild fire and thonder
For all this worldly wonder
A hundred mile a sonder
They were / when the were next
That is a true text
What here ye of the scotts
They make us all sottes
Poppynge folysshe dawes
They make us to pyll strawes
They play their old pranckes
After huntley banks
At the streme of Banock^ burn
They did us a shrewde turn
When Edward of Karnaruan
Lost all his father wan
What here ye of y^ lord Dakers
He makes us Jack rakers
He says we are but crakers
He calls us England men
Strong herted like an hen
For the scotts and he
To well they do agree
With do thou for me
And I shall do for the
Whiles the red hat does endure
He mketh him self rock sure
The red hat with his lure
Brings all thyuges under cure
But as the world now gose
What here ye of the lord Rose
Nothing to purpose
Not worth a cockly fose
Their hertes be in thyr hose
The earl of Northumberlande
Dare take nothing on hand
Our barons be so bold
In to a mouse hole they would
Rynne away and crepe
Like a mayny of sheep
Dare not look out at dur
For dread of the mastyue ^ur
For dread of the bochers dog
Would wyrry them like an hog
For and this curre do gnar
They must stand all a far
To hold up their hand at the bar
For all their noble blood
He pluckes them by the hode
And shakes them by the ear
And bring them in such fear
He bayteth them like a bear
Like an ox or a bull
Their wyt^es he says are dull
He says they have no brain
Their astate to maintain
And makes the^ to bow their kne
Be fore his majesty
Iuges of the kings laws
He countys them foles and dawes
Sergyantes of the coyfe eke
He says they are to seek
In pletynge of their case
At the commune place
Or at the kings benche
He wryngeth the^ such a wrenche
That all our learned men
Dare not set their p^nne
To plete a true trial
With in westmynster hall
In the Chau^cery where he sytt^s
But such as he admyttes
None so hatdy to speak
He says, thou buddy p^^e
Thy learning is to lewd
Thy tongue is not well ^hewde
To ^^ke before our grace
And openly in that place
He rages and he rau^s
And calls them cankerd knau^s
Thus royally he does deal
Under the kings broad seal
And in the checket ^he them cheks
In ^ ^er chamber he noddis and be^s
And ber^^h him thereso st^wte
That no man dare rowte
Duke / earl / baron nor lord
But to his sentence must accord
Whether he be knight or ^^uyre
All men mu^^ follow his d^syre
What say ye of y^ scottysh king
That is another thing
He is but an yonglyng
A stal worthy stryplyng
There is a whyspri^g and a whipli^g
He should be hyder brought
But and it were well sought
I trow all will be naught
Not worth a shyttel cock
Nor worth a sour calstocke
There goth many a lie
Of the duke of Albany
That of should go his head
And brought in quycke or deed
And all Scotland owers
The mou^tenannce of two hours
But as some men said
I dread of some false train
Subtelly wrought shall be
Under a feigned treatee
But with in months three
Men may happily se
The treachery / and the prankes
Of the Scottysshe banks
What here ye of Burgonyons
And the Spainyardes onyons
They have slain our Englisshmen
Above threscore and ten
For all your amyte
No better they agree
God save my lord Admyrell
What here ye of Mutrell
There with I dare not mell
Yet what here ye tell
Of our graunde counsel
I could say some what
But speak ye no more of that
For dread of the red hat
Take peper in the nose
For than thine heed of gose
Of by the hard arse
But there is some trauarse
Between some and some
That makys our sire to glum
It is some what wrong
That his berde is so long
He morneth in black clothing
I pray god save the king
Where ener he go or ride
I pray god be his gyde
Thus will I conclude my style
And fall to rest a while
And so to rest a while. etc.
ONes yet again
Of you I would frayne
Why come ye not to court
To which court?
To the kings court
Or to Hampton court?
Nay / to the kings court
The kings court
Should have the excellence
But Hampton court
Has the preemynence
And yorkes place
With my lords grace
To whose magnifycence
Is all the con^^ewence
Sutys and supplycacyons
Embassades of all nacyons
Straw for law conon
Or for the law common
Or for law civil
It shall be as he will
Stop at law tancrete
An obstract or a concrete
Be it sour be it sweet
His wisdom is so dyscrete
That in a fume or an hete
Wardeyn of the flete
Set him fast by the fete
And of his royal power
When him list to lowre
Than have him to the tower
Saunz altar remedy
Hane him forth by and by
To the marshalsy
Or to the kings benche
He dyggeth so in the crenche
Of the court royal
That he rules them all
So he does vndermynde
And such sleyghtes does find
That the kings mind
By him is subverted
And so streatly coarted
In credenfynge his tales
That all is but nutshales
That any other says
He has in him such faith
Now / yet all this might be
Suffered / and taken in gre
If that that he wrought
To any good end were brought
But all he brings to naught
By god that me dear bought
He bears the dkeyng on hand
That he must pyll his land
To make his cofers rich
But he laythe all in the dyche
And uses such abusyoun
That in the conclusyoun
All comes to confusyon
Perceive the cause why
To tell the troth plainly
He is so ambicyous
So shamles / an so vicyous
And so supersticyous
And so much obliuyous
From whens that he came
That he falls in to Acis^am
Which truly to express
Is a forgetfulness
Or wylfull blyndnesse
Wherewith the So domites
Lost their inward syghtes
The go^moryans also
Were brought to deedly woe
As scripture recordis
A cecitate cordis
In the latyne sing we
Lybera nos domine
But this mad Amalecke
Like to Amamelek
He regards lords
No more than pot shordes
He is in such clacyon
Of his exaltacyon
And the supportacyon
Of our sovereign lord
That god to record
He rules all at will
With out reason or skyll
How be it the primordyall
Of his wretched original
And his base progeny
And his gresy ^enealogy
He came of the sank royal
y^ was cast out of a bochers stall
But how ever he was borne
Men would have the less scorn
If he could consider
His birth and rowme to geder
And call to his mind
How noble and how kynds
To him he has found
Our souereyne lord / chyfe ground
Of all this prelacy
And set him nobly
In great auc^oryte
Out from a low degree
Which he cannat se
For he was parde
No doctor of deuinyte
Nor doctor of the law
Nor of none other saw
But a poor master of art
God wot had little part
Of the Quatriuials
Nor yet of triuials
Nor of philosophy
Nor of Philology
Nor of good pollycy
Nor of astronomy
Nor acquaynted worth a (...)
With honorable Haly
Nor with royal Ptholomy
Nor with Albumasar
Totreate of any star
Fyxtor else mobyll
His latyne tongue does hobbyll
He does but cloute and cobbill
In Cullis Faculte
Called humanyte
Yet proudly he dare pretend
How no man can him amend
But have ye not hard this
How an one eyed man is
Well syghted / when
He is among blind men
Than our process for to stable
This man was full unable
To reche to such degree
Had not our prince be
Royal Henry the eight
Take him in such conceyght
That he set him on heyght
In exemplyfyenge
Great Alexander the king
In writynge as we find
Which of his royal mind
And of his noble pleasure
Transcendynge out of mesure
Thought to do a thing
That perteyneth to a kind
To make up one of naught
And made to him be brought
A wretched poor man
Which his lyuenge wan
With plantyng of lekes
By the days and by the wekes
And of this poor vassal
He made a king royal
And gave him a realm to rule
That occupied a showell
A mattoke / and a spade
Before that he was made
A king / as I have told
And ruled as he would
Such is a kings power
To make with in an hour
And work such a miracle
That shall be a spectacle
Of renown and worldly fame
In likewise now the same
Cardynall / is promoted
Yet with lewd condicyons cotyd
As herafter ben notyd
Presumcyon and vain glory
Envy / wrath / and lechery
Couetys / and glotony
Slothful to do good
Now frantic / now stark wode
Should this man of such mode
Rule the sword of might
How can he do right
For he will as sone smyght
His trende / as his fo
A proverb long a go
Set up a wretch on hye
In a trone triumphantlye
Make him a great astate
And he will play check mate
with ryall majesty
Count him self as good as he
A prelate potencyall
To rule under Belly all
As ferce and as cruel
As the find of hell
His servants meny all
He does reuyle and brall
Like Mahounde in a play
No man dare him with say
He has dispyght and scorn
At them that be well borne
He rebukes them and rayles
Ye horsons / ye bassayles
Ye knaves / ye churles sonnys
Ye rebads not worth two plu^mis
Ye raynbetyn beggars reiagged
Ye recrayed ruffyns all ragged
With stowpe thou hauell
Rynne thou iauell
Thou peuysshe pie pecked
Thou losell long necked
Thus daily they be decked
Taunted and checked
That they are so woe
They wot not whether to go
No man dare come to the speech
Of this gentell Jack breche
Of what estate he be
Of spiritual dygnyte
Nor duke of hye degree
Nor Marquis / earl / nor lord
Which shrewdly does accord
Thus he borne so base
All noble men should out face
His countynaunce like a kayser
My lord is not at layser
Sir ye must tarry a stounde
Till better layser be found
And sir, ye must dau^ce attendau^ce
And take pacient sufferaunce
For my lords grace
Has now no time nor space
To speak with you / as yet
And thus they shall sit
Choose them sit or flyt
Stand / walk / or ride
And his layser abide
Parchaunce half a year
And yet never the nere
This dangerous dowsy pere
Like a kings pere
And within this. xvi. year
He would have been right feign
To have been a chapleyne
And have taken right great pain
With a poor knight
What soever he hight
The chief of his own counsel
They can not well ^ell
When they with him should mell
He is so fyers and fell
He rayles and he ratis
He calls them doddy patis
He grynnes and he gapis
As it were Jack napis
Such a mad bedleme
For to rewle this reame
It is a wonders case
That the kings grace
Is toward him so minded
And so far blinded
That he can not par^e yue
How he does him disc^^ue
I dought lest by Sorsery
Or such other loselry
As wychecraft / or charmyng
For he is the kings derlyng
And his sweet heart rott
And is governed by this mad ^ote
For what is a man the better
For the kings letter
For he will tere it a sonder
Whereat much I wonder
How such a hoddy poule
So boldly dare control
And so malapertly withstand
The kings own hand
And settys not by it a myte
He says the king does write
And writes he wottith not what
And yet for all that
The king his clemency
Despensyth with his demensy
But what his grace ^oth thi^e
I have no pen nor ink
That there with can mell.
But w^le I can tell
How Frauncis Petrarke
That much noble clerk
Writes how Charlemayn
Could not him self refrain
But was rauysht with a rage
Of a like dotage
But how that came about
Read ye the story out
And ye shall find surely
It was by ^ycromansy
By carectes and coniuracyon
Under a certain constellacion
And a certain fumygacion
Under a stone on a gold ryng
Wrought to Charlemayn y^ king
Which constrained him forcebly
For to love a certain body
Above all other inordinatly
This is no fable nor no lie
At Acon it was brought to pa^
As by mine auctor tried it was
But le^mi nasters mathematical
Tell you the rest / for me they shall
They have the full intellygence
And dare use the experyens
In there obsolute conscience
To practyue such abolete sciens
For I abhore to smatter
Of one so deuyllysshe a matter
But I will make further relacio^
Of this I sagogicall colation
How master Gaguine the crownycler
Of the feytis of war
That were done in France
Makes remembrance
How king Jews of late
Made up a great astate
Of a poor wretchid man
Whereof much care began
Ioha^nes Balua was his name
Mine nuctor writes the same
Promoted was he
To a Cardynalles dygnyte
By Jews the king a foresaid
With him so well apayd
That he made hi^ his chauncelar
To make all / or to mar
And to rule as him list
Till he cheked at the fyst
And again all reason
Commyted open trayson
And against his lord souerayn
Wherefore he suffered pain
Was hedyd / drawn / and quarterd
And dyed stynkingly marterd
Lo yet for all that
He ware a cardynals hat
In him was small faith
As mine auctor says
Not for that I mean
Such a casuelte should be seen
Or such chance should fall
Unto our cardynall
All mighty god I trust
Has for hindyscust
That of force he must
Be faithful / true / and just
To our most royal king
Chief rote of his making
Yet it is a wyly mouse
That ca^ bylde his dwelli^ge house
With in the cattes ear
Withouten dread or fear
It is a nyce reconynge
To put all the gouernynge
All the rule of this land
In to one mannys hand
One wise mannys head
May stand somewhat instead
But the wyttys of many wise
Much better can deuy^e,
By their cyrcumspection
And their sad dyrcection
To cause the commune weal
Long to endure in heal
Christ keep king Henry the eight
From treachery and dysceyght
And ^raunt him grace to know
The fau^on from the crow
The wolf from the lam
From whens that mastyfe came
Let him never con found
The gentle gray hownde
Of this matter the grownde
Is easy to expound
And soon may be perceyuid
How the warlde is conveyed
But hark my friend one word
In ernest or in board
Tell me now in this stead
Is master Mewtas deed
The kings frenshe secretary
And his untrue adversary
For he sent in writynge
To Fraunces the french king
Of our masters counsel i^ euerithi^g
That was a peryllous rekenyg
Nay nay / he is not deed
But he was so payned in the head
That he shall never ete more bred
Now he is gone to another stead
wirh a bull under lead
By way of commissyon
To a strange iuris^ictyon
Called Dymingis dale
Far by yonde Portyngale
And has his pas port to pas
Vltra sauromatas
To the devil sir Sathanas
To Pluto and sir Bellyall
The deuyls vycare general
And to his college conuentuall
As well calodemonyall
As to cacademonyall
To puruey for our Cardynall
A palace pontifycall
To keep his court prouyncyall
Upon artycles iudicyall
To ^^ntende and to stryne
For his prerogatyue
With in that consystory
To make sommons peremtory
Be fore some prothonetory
Imperyall or papal
Upon this matter mistycall
I have told you part / but not all
Herafter perchance I shall
Make a larger memoryall
And a further rehersall
And more paper I think to blot
To the court why I came not
Desyring you above all thing
To keep you from laughing
When ye fall to redynge
Of this wanton scrowle
And pray for Mewtas soul
For he is well past and gone
That would god euerychone
Of his affynyte
Were gone as well as he
Amen / amen / say ye
Of your in ward charity.
Amen.
Of your inward charity.
IT were great rewth
For writing of truth
Any man should be
In perplexyte
Of dyspleasure
For I make you sure
Where troth is abhorde
It is a plain record
That there wantys grace
In whose place
Does occupy
Full vngracyously
Falls flatery
Falls terchery
Falls brybery
Subtyle Sym Sly
With mad folly
For who can bestlye
He is best set by
Than fare well to the
Welthfull felycite
For prosperyte
Away than will lie
Than must we agree
With pouert^
For mysery
With penury
Myserably
And wrerchydly
Has made askrye
And out cry
Following the chase
To drive away grace
Yet say thou per case
We can lack no grace
For my lords grace
And my ladies grace
With trey duse ase
And ase in the face
Some hau^e and some base
Some dance the trace
Ever in one case
Mark me that chase
In the tennys play

Hay the gye and the began
The gray gose is no swan
The waters wax wan
And beggars they ban
And they cursed datan
De tribu dan
That this warke began
Palam / et clam
With Balak and Balam
The golden ram
Of flemmyng dam
Sem / Iapheth / or came?
But how comme to pas
Your cupbord that was
Is turned to glass
From silver to brass
From gold to pewter
Or else to a newter
To copper / to tyn
To lead or / alcumyn
A goldsmyth your mayre
But the chief of your fair
Might stand now by potters
And such as sell trotters
Pyrchars / potshordis
This shrewdly accordis
To be a copborde for lordys
My lord now and sir knight
Good even and good night
For now sir Trestram
Ye must wear bukram
Or canues of Cane
For sylkes are wane
Our royals that shone
Our nobles are gone
Among the Burgonyons
And spanyardes onyons
And the Flanderkyns
Gyll swetis and Cate spynnys
They are happy that wynnys
But England may well say
Fie on this wynnyng all way
Now nothing / but pay pay
With laughe and lay down
Borowgh / cite / and town
Good Spring of Lanam
Must count what became
Of his clothe making
He is at such taking
Though his purse wax dull
He must tax for his wull
By nature of a new writ
My lordys grace names it
A quia non satisfacit
In the spyght of his tethe
He must pay a gain
Athousande or twain
Of his gold in store
And yet he paid before
And hunderd pound and more
Which pyncheth him sore
My lordis grace will bring
Down this hye Spring
And bring it so low
It shall not ever flow
Such a prelate I trow
Were worthy to row
Through the streytes of Marock
To the gybbet of Baldock
He would dry up the stremys
Of.ix. kings realmys
All ryuers and wellys
All waters that swellys
For with us he so mellys
That within England dwellys
I would he were somwhere else
For else by and by
He will drink us so dry
And suck us so nigh
That men shall scantly
Have penny or halpeny
God save his noble grace
And grant him a place
Endless to dwell
With the devil of hell
For and he were there
We need never feere
Of the fendys blake
For I under take
He would so brag and crake
That he would than make
The deuyls to quake
To shudder and to shake
Like a fire drake
And with a cole rake
Brose them on a brake
And bind them to astake
And set hell on fire
At his own desyer
He is such a grym syer
And such a potestolate
And such a potestate
That he would break the brains
Of Lucy fers in his chains
And rule them echone
In Lucyfers trone
I would he were gone
For among us is none
That rules / but he alone
With out all good reason
And all out of season
For Folam peason
With him be natgeson
They growwe very rank
Upon every bank
Of his herbers grene
With my lady bright and shene
On their game it is seen
They play not all clean
And it be as I wene
But as touching dystrectyo^
With sober dyrectyon
He keeps them in subiectyon
They can have no protectyon
To rule nor to guide
But all must be tryde
And abide the correctyon
Of his wylfull affectyon
For as for wit
The devil speed whitte
But braynsyk and braynlesse
Wytles and rechelesse
Careless and shamlesse
Thriftles and graceless
To gether are bended
And so condy scended
That the commune wealth
Shall never have good health
But tatterd and ruggyd
Raggyd / and ruggyd
Shauyn and shorn
And all threde bare worn
Such gredynesse
Such nedynesse
My serablenesse
With wretchydnesse
Has brought in dystresse
And much heuyuesse
And great dolowre
England the flower
Of relucent honowre
In old commemoracion
Most royal Englyssh nation
Now all is out of facion
Almost in desolation
I speak by protestacion
God of his miseracyon
Send better reformacyon
Lo / for to do shamfully
He iugeth it no folly
But to write of his shame
He says we are to blame
What a ^renly is this
No shame to do amys
And yet he is a shamed
To be shamfully named
And often prech^ues be blamed
Because they have proclaimed
His madness by writynge
His symplenesse resytynge
Remordynge and bytynge
With chydyng and with ^y^y^ge
Showing him goddis ^aw^s
He calls the prechours dawis
And of holy scriptures saw^s
He counts them for gygawis
And puts them to silence
And with (...) of vyolence
Like Ph^^^^, (...) of grace
Did Moses so^e (...)
And Aron so^e ^e three
The word of god to let
This maumet in like wise
Against the church does rise
The prechour he does dyspys^
With crakyyge in such wise
So bragging all with bost
That no prechour almost
Dare speak for his life
Of my lordis grace / nor his wit
For he has such a bull
He may take whom he wull
And as many as him lykys
May ete pigges in lent for pikys
After the sects of heretykis
For in lent he will et^
All manner of flesh mete
That he can any where get
With other abusyons great
Whereof for to trete
It would make y^ devil to sweet
For all priuileged places
He brekes and defaces
All placis of relygion
He has them in derisyon
And makith such prouisyon
To drive them at diuisyon
And finally in conclusyon
To bring them to confu^yon
Saint Albons to record
Whereof this ungracious lord
Has made him self abbot
Against their wylles god wot
All this he does deal
Under strength of the great seal
And by his legacy
Which madly he does apply
Unto an extrauagancy
Pyked out of all good law
With reasons that been raw
Yet when he took first his hat
He said he knew what was what
All justice he pretended
All things should be a mended
All wrongs he would redress
All iniuris he would repress
All periuris he would oppress
And yet this gr^celesse elfe
He is perjured him self
As plainly it does appear
Who list to enquere
In the regestry
Of my lord of Cantorbury
To whom he was professed
In three points expressed
The first to do him reverence
The second to owe him obedynce
The third with hole affectyon
To be under his subi^ctyon
But now hemaketh obiectyon
Under the protectyon
Of the kings great seal
That he sets never a deal
By his former oath
Whether god be pleased or wroth
He makith so proud pretens
That in his equipolens
He ingyth him equivalent
With god omnipotent
But yet be ware the rod
And the stroke of god,
The apostyll Peter
Had a pore my^er
And a poor cope
When he was creat pope
First in Antioche
He did never approach
Of Rome to the sea
Weth such dygnyte
Saint Dunstane what was he
Nothing he says like to we
There is a dyuersyte
By twene him and me
We pass him in degree
As legatus a latere
Ecce sacerdos magnus
That will head us and hang us
And strcitly strangle us
And he may fange us
Decre and deecetall
Constytucyon prouineyall
Nor no law canonical
Shall le^ the priest pontyficall
To sit in causa sanguinis
Now god amend that is a mys
For I suppose that he is
Of Jeremy the why skynge rod
The flayle / the scourge
Of almighty god
This Naman Sirus
So fell and so irous
So full of maleucoly
With a flap before his eye
Men wene that he is pocky
Or else his surgions they lie
For as far as the can spy
By the craft of surgery
It is manus domini
And yet this proud Antiochus
He is so ambicious
So elate / and so vicious
And so cruel hertyd
That he will not be conuertyd
For he sets god a part
He is now so ouerth wart
And so payned with pangis
That all his trust hangis
In Balthasor / which heled
Domi^gos nose / that was wheled
That Lumberdes nose mean I
That stands yet a wrye
It was not heled alderbest
It stands somewhat on the west
I mean Domyngo Lomelyn
That was wont to win
Much money of the king
At the cardys and haserdynge
Balthasor y^ helyd domi^gos uose
From the puskylde pocky pose
Now with his gu^mys of araby
Has promised to hele our cardinals eye
Yet sum surgio^s put a dout
Lest he will put it clean out
And make hi lame of his neder limes
God se^de him sorrow for his sines
Some me^ might ask a q^stion
By whose suggesty^n
I took on hand this warke
Thus boldly for to bark
And men list to hark
And my words mark
I will answer like a clerk^
For trewly and unfeigned
I am forcebly constrained
At Iuuynals request
To wryght of this glorious gest
Of this vain glorious best
His fame to be encrest
At every solemn feast
Quia difficile est
Satiram non scribere?
Now master doctor / how say y^
What soever your name be
What though ye be namelesse
Ye, shall not escape blameless
Nor yet shall escape shamlesse
Master doct^r in your degree
yourselfe madly ye over se
Blame Iuuinall and blame not me
Master doctor diricum
Omne / animi vicium^ etc.
As Iuuinall does record
A small defaute in a great lord
A little crime in a great astate
Is much more inordinate
And more horyble to behold
Than any other a thousand fold
Ye put to blame ye wot nere who^
Ye may wear a cocks come
your fo^de head in your furred hode
Hold ye your tongue ye ca^ no good
And at more conuenye^t time
I may fortune for to ryme
Some what of your madness
For small is your sadness
To put any man in lack
And say ill be^ynde his back
And my words mark truly
That ye can not bide thereby
For Smigma non est sinamomu^
But de absentibus nil ni^i bonum
Complain or do what ye will
Of your co^playnt it shall not skyl
This is the tenor of my byl
A daucock ye be / and so shall be still.
