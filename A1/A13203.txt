The first book of Moses called Genesis.
W. T. To the Reader.
WHen I had translated the new testament / I added a pistle unto the latter
end / In which I desired them yt were learned to amend if ought were found
amysse. But our malicious and wylye hypocrytes which are so stubburne and hard
herted in their weked abhominacio^s that it is not possible for them to amend
any thing atall (as we see by daily experience when their both lyvinges and
doings are rebufed with the troth) say / some of them that it is unpossible
to translate the scripture in to English / some that it is not lawful for the
lay people to have it in their mother tongue / some that it would make them all
heretyfes / as it would no doubt from many things which they of long time have
falsely taught / and that is the whole cause wherefore they forbid it / though
they other clokes pretend. And some or rather every one / say that it would
make them rise against the king / whom they them selves (unto their damnatyo^)
never yet obeyed. And left the temporal rulars should see their falsehod / if
the scripture came to light / causes them so to lie.

And as for my translatid in which they afferme unto the lay people (as I have
heard say) to be I wotte not how many thousand heresies / so that it ca^ not
be me^ded or correct / they have yet taken so great pain to cramyne it / and
to compare it unto that they would feign have it and to their own imaginations
and iugglin ge terms / and to have some what to rail at / and under that
cloak to blaspheme the treuth / that they might with as little labor (as I
suppose) have translated the most part of the bible. For they which in times
paste were wont to look on no more scripture then they sound in their duns or
soch like develysh doctrine / have yet now so narowlye looked on my translatyon
/ that there is not so much as one I therein if it lack^ a title over his head /
but they have noted it / and nombre it unto the ignorant people for anheresy.
Fynallye in this they be all agreed / to dryve you from the knowledge of the
scripture / and that ye shall not have the terte thereof in the mother tongue /
and to keep the world still in darkness / to thentent they might sirt in the
consciences of the people / through vain superstition and false doctrine / to
satisfye their fylthy lusts their proud ambition / and insatiable
covetuousnes / and to exalte their own honor above king and emperor / ye
and above god him silfe

A thousand books had they lever to be put forth agensce their abominable
doings and doctrine / then that the scripture should come to light. For as
long as they may keep that down / they will so darken the right way with the
miste of their sophistrye / and so tangle the^ that either rebuke or despise
their abhommations with arguments of philosophye and with wordly symylitudes
and apparent reasons of natural wisdom. And with wrestinge the scripture unto
their own purpose clean contrary unto y^ process / order and meaning of the
text / and so delude them in descantynge upon it with all ligoryes / and amase
the^ expoundinge it in many senses before the unlearned lay people (when it
has but one simple litterall sense whose light the owls ca^ not abide) that
though thou feale in thine heart and art sure how that all is false yt they
say / yet coudeste thou not solve their sotle rydles.

Which thing only moved me to translate the new testament. Because I had
perceaved by experyence / how that it was impossible to stablysh the lay
people in any truth / except yo scripture were plainly laid besore their eyes
in their mother tongue / that they might se the process / order and meaning of
the text: for else what so ever truth is taught them / these ennymyes of all
truth qwench it again / partly with the smoke of their bottomless pyite
whereof thou read apocalipsis.ix. that is / with apparent reasons of
sophistrye and traditions of their own making / founded with out ground of
scripture / and partly in iugglinge with the text / expoundinge it in soch a
sense as is impossible to gether of the text / if thou see the process order
and meaning thereof.

And even in the bisshope of londons house I intended to have done it. For when
I was so turmoyled in the conire where I was that I could no longer there dwell
(the process whereof were to long here to reherce) I this wise thought in my
silfe / this I suffer because the prestes of the contre be unlearned / as god it
knows there are a full ignorant sort which have seen no more latin then that
they read in their portesses and missales which yet many of them can scacely
read (except it be Albertus desecretis mulieru^ in which yet / thought they be
never so soryly learned / they pore day and night and make notes therein and all
to teach the mydwyves as they say / and linwod a book of constitutions together
tithes / mortuaryes / offeringes / customs / and other pillage / which they
call / not theirs / but gods part and the deuty of holy chirch / to
discharge their consciences with all for they are bound that they shall not
dimynysh / but encreace all thing unto the vttmost of their powers) and
therefore (because they are thus unlearned thought I) when they come to gedder to
the alehouse / which is their preachinge place / they afferme that my sainges
are heresy. And besides yt they add to of their own heddes which I never spoke
/ as the manner is to prolonge the tale to short the time with all / and accuse
me secretly to the chauncelare and other the bishopes officers / And indeade
when I came before the chauncelare / he thretened me grevously / and rexyled me
and rated me as though I had been a dog / and laid to my charge whereof there
could be none accuser brought forth (as their manner is not to bring forth the
accuser) and yet all the prestes of ye contre were yt same day there. As I
this thought the bishope of london came to my remembrance whom Erasmus (whose
tongue makes of little gnattes great elepha^tes and lifts up above the
stars whosoever geveth him a little exhibition) prayseth excedingly among
other in his annotatyons on the new testament for his great learning. Then
thought I / if I might come to this man's service / I were happy. And so I
gate me to london / and through the accoyntaunce of my master came to sir harry
gilford the kings graces countroller / and brought him an oration of Isocrates
which I had translated out of greek in to English / and desired him to speak
unto my lord of london for me / which he also did as he showed me / and willed
me to write a pistle to my lord / and to god to him my silf which I also did /
and delivered my pistle to a servant of his own / one wyllyam he bil^hwayte /
a man of mine old accoyntau^ce. But god which kneweth what is within hypocrites
/ saw that I was begyled / and that that council was not the next way unto
my purpose. And therefore he gate me no favor in my lords sight Wherevppo^ my
lord answered me / his house was full / he had mo the^ he could well find /
and advised me to seek in london / where he said I could not lack a service /
And so in london I abode almost an year / and marked the course of the world
/ and herd our pratars / I would say our preachers how they bosted them
selves and their hye authorite / and beheld the pomp of our prelates and how
besyed they were as they yet are / to set peace and unite in the world (though
it be not possible for them that walk in darkness to continue long in peace
/ for they can not but either sto^ble or dash them selves at one thing or
another that shall clean vnquyer all togedder) and saw things whereof I
defer to speak at this time and understood at the last not only that there
was no rowme in my lord of londons palace to translate the new testament / but
also that there was no place to do it in all england / as experience does now
openly declare. Under what manner therefore should I now submit this book to be
corrected and amended of them / which can suffer nothing to be well* Or what
^rotestacyon should I make in soch a matter unto our prelates those stubbutne
N^mrothes which so mightily fight agenste god and resist his holy spirit /
enforceynge with all craft and sotelte to qwench the light of the everlastinge
testament / promyses / and as poyntemente made between god and us: and heapinge
the sirce wrath of god upon all princes and rulars / mockinge the^ with falfe
feigned names of hypocrysye / and servinge their lusts at all points / and
dispensinge with the^ even of the very laws of god / os which Christ him silf
testifies Matthew.v. yt not so much as one tittle thereof may perish or be
broken. And of which the prophet faith Psalm.cxvii. Thou haste commanded thy
laws to be kept meod / yt is in hebrew excedingly / with all diligence /
might and power / and have made the^ so mad with their iugglinge charms and
crafty persuasio^s that they think it full satisfaction for all their weked
lyvinge / to torme^^ soch as tell the^ troth / and to borne the word of their
souls health and sle whosoever beleve thereon.

Notwithsto^dinge yet I submytte this book and all other that I have other made
or translated / or shall in time to come (if it be gods will that I shall
further labor in his hervest) unto all them that submytte the^ selves un to
the word of god / to be corrected of the^ / ye and moreover to be disalewed
and also burnte / if it seem worthy when they have examyned it with the hebrew
/ so that they first put forth of their own translatinge a another that is more
correct.

A prologe shewinge the use of the scripture
THough a man had a precious iuell and a rich / yet if he wiste not the value
thereof nor wherefore it served / he were another the better nor ryeher of a
straw. Eyes so though we read the scripture and babble of it never so much / yet
if we know not the use of it / and wherefore it was geven / and what is them to
be sought / it profits us nothing at all. It is not enough therefore to read
and talk of it only / but woe must also desire god day and night instantly to
open our eyes / and to make us understand and feale wherefore the scripture was
given / that we may apply the medicyne of the scripture / every man to his
own sores / inlesse then we entend to beydle disputers / and braulers about
vain words / ever gnaw enge upon the bitter barcke with out and newer
attayninge unto the swetepith with in / and persequutinge one and other for
defendinge of lewd imaginacions and phantasyes of our arene invencyon

Paul in ye third of ye second epistle to Tymo the says / yt the scripture
is good to teach (for yt ought me^ to teach and not dreams of their own
makige / as ye pope does) and also to improvt / for ye scripture is y^
twichstone yt tries all doctrynes / and by yt we know the false from ye true.
And in the.vi. to the ephesians he calls it the swerd of the spirit / by
cause it kills hyppocrites and utters a^o improveth their false inventyons.
And in the. ^^. to the Romans he says all that are written / are written for
our learning / that we through pacyence and co^sorte of the scripture might
have hope. That is / the ensamples that are in the scripture comfort us in all
our tribulacyons / and make us to put our trust in god / and pacyently to
abide his leisure. And in the.x. of the first to the Corinthyans he brings
in examples of the scripture of fear us and to bridle the flesh / that we
cast not the yoke of the law of god from of our necks / and fall to
lustynge and doing of evil.

So now the scripture is a light and shows us the true way / both what to do
/ and what to hope. And a defense from all error / and a comfort in
adversyte that we despair not. and fears us in prosperyte that we sin not
Sec^e therefore in the scripture as thou read it first the law / what god
commands us to do. And secundarylye the promyses / which god promyseth us
again / namely in Christ Jesus our lord. Then seek ensamples / first of
comsorte / how god purges all them that submit them selves to walk in his
ways / in the purgatory of tribulatyon / delyveringe them yet at tie latter
end / and never soferinge any of them to perysh / that cleave fast to his
promyses. And fynallye / note the ensamples which are written to fear the flesh
that we sin not. That is / how god suffers the ungodly and weked sinners
that resist god and refuse to follow him / to continue in their wekednesse /
ever waxinge worse and worse until their sin be so sore increased and so
abhomynable / that if they should longer endure they would corrupt the very
elect. But for the electes sake god sends the^ preachers. Nevertheless they
harden their hearts agenste the truth / and god destroys the^ utterly and
begins the world a new.

This comfort shall thou evermore find in the plain text and luerall sense.
Nether is there any storye so homely / so rude / ye or so vile (as it seems
outward) wherein is not exceadinge great comfort. And when some which seem to
them selves great clerks say: they wott not what moare profit is in many
gestes of the scripture if they be read with out an allegotye / then in a tale
of robenhode / say thou: that they were written for our consolacyon and
comfort / that we despair not / if soch likehappen unto us. We be not holyer
then Noe / though he were once drunk. Nether be^^ter beloved then Jacob /
though his own son defiled his bed. We be not holyer then lot / though his
daughters through ignorance deceaved him / nor paradventure holyer then those
daughters. Nether are we holyer then David / though he brake wedlock and upon
the same committed abhomynable murder. All those men have witness of the
scripture that they pleased god and ware good men both before that those
things chaunsed them and also aster. Nevertheless soch things happened them
foroure ensampler not that we should contrafayte their evil / but if while we
fight with our selves enforsynge to walk in the law of god (as they did) we
yet fall likewise / that we despair not / but come again* to the laws of god
and take better hold

We read sens the time of Christ's deeth / of virgins that have been brought
unto the come^ stues / and theyedefyled / and of martyrs that have been bound
and hores have ab^sed their bodies. Why: The judgments of god are
botto^lesse. Soch things chanced partly for ensamples / partly God through
sin heals sin Pride can net her be healed nor yet appear but through soch
horrible deades. Paraduenture they were of y^ popes sect and reioysed fleshly
/ thinkinge that heaven came by deades and not by Christ / and that the
outward dead iustyfyed them and made them holy and not the inward spirit
receeved by faith and the consent of the heart unto the law of god.

As thou readeste therefore think that every syllable pertayneth to thine own
silf / and suc^e out the pithe of the scripture / and arm thy silf against all
assaults. First note with strong faith the power of god in creatinge all of
naught Then mark the grevous fall of Adam and of us all in him / through the
lightregardi^ge of the commandment of god. In the iii. Chapitre God turns
him unto Abel and then to his offeringe / but not to Cain and his offeringe.
Where thou see that though the deades of the evel apere outwardly as glorious
as the deades of the good: yet in the sight of god which looks on the heart /
the dead is good because of the man / and not the man good because of his
dead. In the vj. God sends Noe to preach to the weked and gives them space
to repent: they wax hard herted / God brings them to naught And yet saves
Noe: even by the same water by which he destroyed them. Mark also what followed
the pride of the buyldinge of the ^oure of Babel

Consydre how God sends forth Abraham out of his own contre in to a strange
landefull of weked people / and gave him but a bare promise with him that he
would bless him and defend him. Abraham beleved: and that word saved and
delivered him in all parelles: so that we se / how that man's lise is not
mayntayned by bred only (as Christ says) but much rather by belevinge the
promyses of god. Behold how soberly and how circu^spectly both Abraham and also
Isaac behave them selves among the infideles. Abraham byeth that which might
have been geven him for naught / to cut of occasions. Isaac when his wells
which he had dug were taken from him / geveth rowme and resists not. More
over they creand sow and feed their catell / and make confede^acy ons / and
take perpetual truce / and do all outward things: Even as they do which have
no faith / for god hathnot made us to beydle in this world Every man must work
godly and truly to the vttmoste of the power that god has geven him: and yet
not trust therein: but in gods word or promise: and god will work with us
and bring that we do to good effect. And the^ when our power will extend no
further / gods promesses will work all alone

How many things also resisted the promesses of god to Jacob? And yet Jacob
coniureth god with his own promesses savenger O god of my father Abraham: and
god of my father Isaac / Olorde which saydeste unto me return unto thine own
contre / and unto the place were thou waste borne and I will do the good Iam not
worthy of the least of those mercyes / nor of that troth which thou haste done
to thy servant I went out but with a staff / and come ^ome with ij droves /
delyver me out of the hands of my brother Esau / for I fear him greatly etc.
And god delyvered him / and will likewise all that call unto his promesses with
a repentinge heart / were they never so great sinners. Mark also the weak
infirmites of the man He loves one wife more then a another / one son more
then a another. And se how god purges him. Esau threteneth him: Laban begyleth
him. The beloved wife is long baren: his daughter is ravyshed: his wife is
defiled / and that of his own son. Rahel dies / Joseph is taken a way / ye
and as he supposed rent of wild beasts And yet how glorious was his end? Note
the wekenesse of his Children / ye and the sin of them / and how god through
their own wekednes saved them. These ensamples teach us that a man is not
attonce parfecte the first day he begins to lyve well They that be strong
therefore must suffer with the weak / and help to keep them in unite and
peace one with a another until they bestro^ger

Note what the brothren said when they were tached in Egipte / we have verelye
sinned (said they) ag^ynste our brother in y^ we saw the anguysh of his
soul when he besought rs / and would not hear him: and therefore is this
tribulation come upon us. By which ensample thou seiste / how that conscience
of evyll doenges finds men out at ^he last. But namely in tribulacyon and
adrersyte: there temptacyon and also desperacyon: ye and the very pains of
hest find us out: there the soul feleth the fers^ wrath of god and wyssheth
mountains to fall on ber and to hyde her (if it were possible) from the
angrye face of god.

Mark also how great evelles follow of how little an occasion Sina goes but
forth alone to se the daughters of the contre / and how great myscheve and
troble followed? Iacobloved but one son more then another / and how grevous
murder followed in their hearts? These are ensamples for our learning to
teach us to walk warely and circu^spectlye in the world of weak people /
that we geve no man occasions of evyll Finally / se what god promised Joseph in
his dreams. Those promesses acco^panyed him all ways / and went down with him
even in to the deep dongeon / And brought him up again / And never for soke
him till all that was promised was fulfilled. These are ensamples wryte^ for
our learni^ge (as paul says) to teach us to trust in god in y^ strong fire
of tribulation and purgatory of our flesh. And that they which submytte them
selves to follow god should note and mark soch things / for their lerninge and
comfort / is the fruit of the scripture and cause why it was written: And with
soch a purpose to read it / is the way to everlastynge life and to those
joyful blyssinges that are promised unto all nacyons in the seade of Abraham /
which seade is Jesus Christ our lord / to whom be honor and praise for
ever and unto god our father through him.

AMEN.
The first book of Moses called Genesis
The first Chapter.
IN the beginning God created heaven and earth. The earth was void and empty /
and darcknesse was upon the deep / and the spirit of god moved upon the water

Than God said: let there be light and there was light. And God saw the
light that it was good: and devyded the light from the darcknesse / and
called the light day / and the darcknesse night: and so of the evenynge and
morning was made the first day

And God said: let there be a fyrmament between the waters / and let it devyde
the waters a sonder. Than God made the fyrmament and parted the waters which
were under the fyrmament / from the waters that were above the fyrmament: And
it was so. And God called the fyrmament heaven / And so of the evenynge and
morninge was made the second day

And God said / let the waters that are under heaven gather them selves unto
one place / that the dry land may appear: And it came so to pass. And god
called the dry land the earth and the gatheringe together of waters called ^e
the sea. And God saw that it was good

And God said: let the earth bring forth herb and grass that sow seed / and
fruitful trees that bear fruit every one in his kind / havynge their seed in
them selves upon the earth. And it came so to pass: and the earth brought forth
herb and grass sowenge seed every one in his kind and trees berynge fruit
and havynge their seed in the^ selves / every one in his kind. And God saw
that it was good: and the^ of the evenynge and morning was made the third
day.

Than said God: let there be lyghtes in ye firmament of heaven to devyde the
day from the night / that they may be unto signs / seasons / days and
years. And let them be lyghtes in the fyrmament of heaven / to shine upon the
earth. and so it was. And God made two great lyghtes A greater light to rule
the day / and a less light to rule the night / and he made sterres also.
And God put them in the fyrmament of heaven to shine upon the earth / and to
rule the day and the night / and to devyde the light from darcknesse. And
god saw yt it was good: and so of the evenynge and morning was made the
fourth day.

And God said / let the water bring forth creatures that move and have life /
and fowls for to flee over the earth under the fyrmament of heaven. And God
created great whalles and all manner of creatures that lyoe and move / which
the waters brought forth in their kinds / and all manner of federed fowls in
their kinds. And God saw that it was good: and God blessed them saying. Grow
and multiplye and fill the waters of the sees / and let the fowls multiplye
upon the earth. And so of the evenynge and morninge was madethe fyfth day.

And God said: leth the earth bringforth lyvynge creatures in their kinds:
catell and worms and beasts of the earth in their kinds / and so it came ^o
pass. And god made the beasts of the earth in their kinds / and catell in
their kinds / and all manner worms of the earth in their kinds: and God saw
that it was good.

And God said: let us make man in our symilitude and after our lycknesse:
that he may have rule over the fysh of the sea / and over the fowls of the
air / and over catell / and over all the earth / and over all worms that crepe
on the earth. And God created man after his lycknesse / after the lycknesse of
god created he him: male and female created he them.

And God blessed them / and God said unto them. Grow and multiplye and fill
the earth and subdue it / and have domynyon over the fysh of the sea / and over
the fowls of the air / and over all the beasts that move on the earth.

And God said: se / I have geven you all herbs that sow seed which are on all
the earth / and all manner trees that have fruit in them and sow seed: to be
meat for you and for all beasts of the earth / and unto all fowls of the air
/ and unto all that crepeth on the earth where in is life / that they may have
all manner herbs and grass for to eat / and even so it was. And God beheld
all that he had made / and loo they were exceadynge good: and so of the evenynge
and morning was made the syxth day

The second Chapter.
Thus was heaven and earth fynished with all their apparel: and i^ y^ seventh
day god ended his work which he had made and rested in y^ seventh day from
all his works which he had made. And God blessed y^ seventh day / and
sanctyfyed it / for in it he rested from all his works which he had created
and made.

These are the generations of heaven and earth when they were created / in the
time when the Lord God created heaven and earth and all the shrubbes of the
field before they werein the earth. And all the herbee of the field before they
sprange: for the Lord God had yet sent no rain upon the earth / nether was
there yet any man to tylle the earth. But there arose a myste out of the ground
and watered all the face of the earth* Then the Lord God sh^pe man / even of
the m^ulde of the earth and brethed into his face the breath of life. So man was
made a lyvynge soul.

The Lord God also planted a garden in Eden from the beginning / and there he
set man whom he had formed. And the Lord God made to spring out of the earth
/ all manner trees bewtyfull to the syghte and pleasant ^o eat / and the tree
of life in the mids of the garden: and also the tree of knowledge of good and
evil.

And there spronge a rever out of Eden to water the garden / and thence divided
it self / and grew into four principal waters. The name of the one is
Phison / he it is that compasses all the land of heuila / where gold grows.
And the gold of that contreys precious / there is found bedellion and a stone
called O^ix. The name of the second ryver is Gihon / which compassyth all the
land of Inde. And the name of the third river is Hidekell / which runs on
the east side of the assyryans And the fourth ^^ver is Euphrates.

And the Lord God took Adam and put him in the garden of Eden / to dress it
and to keep it: and the Lord God commanded Ada^ saying: of all the trees of
the garden se thou^ eat. But of the tree of knowledge of good and badd se that
thou eat not: for even y^ same day thou eatest of it / thou shall surely dye.

And the Lord God said: it is not good that man should be alone / I will make
him an helper to bear him company: And after yt the Lord God had make of the
earth all manner beasts of the field / and all manner fowls of the air / he
brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them. And as Ada^ called all
manner livynge beasts: eve^ so are their names. And Adam gave names unto all
manner catell / and unto the fowls of the air / and unto all manner beasts of
the field. But there was no help found unto Adam to bear him company

Then the Lord God cast a slomber on Adam / and he slepte. And then he took
o^^ one of his rybbes / and instede there of he filled up the place with flesh.
And the Lord God made of the rybbe which he took out of Adam / a woman and
brought her unto Adam. Then said Ada^ this is once bone of my boones / and
flesh of my flesh. This shall be called woman: because she was take of the man.
For this cause shall a man leve father and mother and cleve unto his wife / ^
they shall be one flesh. And they were ^ther of them naked / both Adam and his
wife / and were not ashamed:

The.iij. Chapter
But the serpent was sotyller than all the beasts of the field which y^ Lord
God had made / and said unto the woman. Ah sir / that God has said / ye shall
not eat of all manner trees in the garden. And the woman said unto the serpent
/ of the fruit of the trees in the garden we may eat / but of the fruit of the
tree yt is in the mids of the garden (said God) se that ye eat not / and se
that ye touch it not: lest ye dye.

Then said the serpent unto the woman: ^ush ye shall not dye: But God does
know / that whenever ye should eat of it / your eyes should be opened and
ye should be as / God and know both good and evell. And the woman saw that it
was a good tree to eat of and lusty unto the eyes and a pleasant tree for to
make wise. And took of the fruit of it and ate / and gave unto her husband also
with her / and he ate. And the eyes of both them were opened / that they
understood how that they were naked. Than they sowed fygge leves togedder and
made them apurns.

And they herd the voice of the Lord God as he walked in the garden in the
cool of the day. And Adam hyd himself and his wife also from the face of the
Lord God / among the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called Adam and
said unto him where art thou? And he answered. Thy voice I hard in the garden
/ but I was afraid because I was naked / and therefore hyd myself. And he said:
who told the that thou wast naked? have thou eaten of the tree / of which I
bade the that thou should not eat? And Adam answered. The woman which thou
gave to bear me company she took me of the tree / and I ate. And the Lord
God said unto the woman: wherefore did thou so? And the woman answered / the
serpent deceaved me and I ate.

And the Lord God said unto the serpe^e because thou haste so done most
cursed be thou of all catell and of all beasts of the feld: oppo^ thy belly
shall thou goo: and earth shall thou eat alldayes of thy life. Morover I will
put haired between the and the woman / and between thy seed and ^yr seed. And
that seed shall tread the on the heed / and thou shall tread hit on the hele.

And unto the woman he said: I will suerly increase thy sorrow and make the often
with child / and with pain shall thou be deleverd: And thy lusts shall
pertayne unto thy husbond and he shall rule the.

And unto Ada^ he said: for as much as thou have obeyed the voice of thy wife /
and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded the saying: se thou eat not
thereof: cursed be the earth for thy safe. In sorrow shall thou eat thereof all
days of thy life / And it shall bear thorns and thystels unto the. And thou
shall eat the herbs of y^ feld: In the sweet of thy face shall thou eat
bread / until thou return unto the earth whence thou wast taken: for earth thou
art / and unto earth shall thou return.

And Ada^ called his wife Heua / because she was the mother of all that lyveth
And the Lord God made Adam and his wife garments of skynnes / and put them on
them. And the Lord God said: loo / Adam is become as it were one of us / in
knowledge of good and evell. But now lest he strech forth his hand and take also
of the three of life and eat and lyve ever.

And the Lord God cast him out of the garden of Eden / to tylle the earth
whence he was taken. And he cast Ada^ out / and set at y^ enteringe of the

to the tree of life.

The.iiij. Chapter.
ANd. Adam lay with ^eua is wife / which conceaved and bare Cain / and said: I
have gotten ama^ of the Lord. And she proceeded forth and bare his brother
Abell: And Abell became a sheperde / And Cain became a ploweman.

And it fortuned in process of time / that Cain brought of the fruit of the
earth: an offering unto the Lord. And Abell / he brought also of the
fyrstlynges of his sheep and of the fatt of them. And the Lord looked unto
Abell and to his offeynge: but unto Cain and unto his offrynge / looked he not.
And Cain was wroth exceadingly / and loured. And the Lord said unto Cain: why
art thou angry / and why loureste thou? Wotest thou not if thou do well thou
shall receave it? But and if thou do evell / by and by thy sin lies open

And as soon as they were in the feldes / Cain fell upon Abell his brother
and slew him And y^ Lord said unto Cain: where is Abell thy brother: And he
said: I can not tell / am I my brothers keeper? And he said: What have thou
done? the voice of thy brothers blood cries unto me out of the earth. And now
cursed be thou as pertaynyng to the earth / which opened her mouth to receive
thy brothers blood of thy ne hand. For when thou tyllest the ground she shall
hence forth not geve her power unto the. A vagabunde and a rennagate shall thou
be upon the earth.

And Cain said unto the Lord: my sin is greater / then that it may be
forgeven. Behold thou castest me out this day from of the face of the earth /
and from thy syghte must I hyde my self and I must be wandrynge and a
vagabunde upon the earth: Morover whosoever fyndeth me / will kill me. And the
Lord said unto hi Not so / but whosoever sleyth Cain shall be punyshed.vij.
fold. And ye Lord put * a mark upon Cain that no ma^yt found him should
kill him* And Cain went out from the face of the Lord and dwelt in the land
Nod / on the east side of Eden.

And Cain lay with his wife / which conceaved and bare Henoth. And he was
buyldinge a cite and called the name of it after the name of his son /

selves on the harp and on the organs And Zilla she also bare Tubalcain a
worker in metal and a father of all that grave in brass and yeron. And
Tubalcains sister was called Naema.

Then said Lamech unto his wyves Ada and Zilla: hear my voice ye wyves of
Lamech and harken unto my words / for I have slain a man and wounded my self
/ and have sla in a yongman / and got my self strypes: For Cain shall be
avenged sevenfolde: but Lamech seventie times seven fold.

Adam also lay with his wife yet again / and she bare a son and called his
name Seth For god (said she) has geven me another son For Abell whom Came
slew. And Seth begat a son and called his name Enos. And in that time began
men to call on the name of the Lord.

The.vj. Chapter.
ANd it came to pass / wha^ men began to multiplye apo^ the earth and had be
got them daughters / the sons of God saw the daughters of men that / they
were fair / and took unto them wyves / which they best liked among the^ all.
And the LORd said: My spirit shall not allwaye stryve with man / for they are
flesh. Nevertheles I will give them yet space / and hundred and.xx. years

There were tirantes in the world in those days. For after that the children of
God had gone in unto the daughters of men and had begotten them childern / the
same childern were the mightiest of the world and men of renown And when the
Lord saw y^ the wekednesse of man was increased upon the earth / and that all
the ymaginacion and toughtes of his heart was only evell continually / he
repented that he had made man upon the earth and sorowed in his heart. And said:
I will destroy mankind which I have made / from of the face of the earth: both
man / beast / worm and foul of the air / for it repe^teth me that I have
made them. But yet Noe found gracein the syghte of the Lord.

These are the generatio^s of Noe. Noe was a ^^ghteous man and ^nco^rapte in
his time / and walked with god. And Noe begat.iij. sons: Sem / Ham and
Iapheth And the earth was corrupt in the syghte of god and was full of
mischefe. And God looked upon the earth / and loo^ was corrupt: for all flesh
had corrupt his way upon the earth.

Than said God to Noe: the end of all flesh is come before me / for the earth is
full of there myschefe. And loo / I will destroy them with the earth. Make the
an arcke of pyne tree / and make chaumbers in the arcke / and pytch it within
and without with pytch. And of this facion shall thou make it.

The lenth of the arcke shall be.iij. hundred cubytes / and the breadth of it.l.
cubytes / and the heyth of it.xxx. cubytes. A wyndow shall thou make above in
the arcke. And within a cubyte compass shall thou finysh it. And the door of
the arcke shall thou set in ye side of it: and thou shall make it with iij
loftes one above an other. For behold I will bring in a flood of water upon the
earth to destroy all flesh from under heaven / wherein breath of life is so that
all that is in the earth shall perish. But I will make mine apoyntement with the
/ that both thou shall come in to ye arcke and thy sons / thy wife and thy
sons wyves with the.

And of all that ly^eth what soever flesh it be / shall thou bring in to the
arcke / of every thing a pair / to keep them a lyve with the. And male and
female se that they be / of birds in their kind / and of beasts in their
kind / and of all manner of worms of the earth in their kind: a pair of every
thing shall come unto the to keep them a lyve. And take unto the of all manner
of meat yt may be eaten and lay it up in stoore by the / that it may be meat
both for ye and for the^: and Noe did acordynge to all that God commanded him.

The.vij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord said unto Noe: goo in to the arcke both thou and all the
houssold. For the have I seen rightuous before me in this generation. Of all
clean beasts take unto the.vij. of every kind the male and his female And of
unclean beasts a pair / the male and his female: likewise of the birds of
the air vij. of every kind / male and female to save seed upon all the earth.
For.vij. days hence will I send rain upon the earth.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes
and will dystroy all manner of things that Tha^e made / from of the face of the
earth..

And Noe did acordynge to all yt the lord commanded him: and Noe was, vi.
hundred year old / when the flood of water came upon the earth: and Noe went
and his sons and his wife and his sons wyves with him / in to the arc from
the waters of the flood. And of clean beasts and of beasts that ^ are unclean
and of birds and of all that crepeth upon the earth / came in by cooples of
every kind unto Noe in to the arc: a male and a female: even as God
commanded Noe. And the seventh day the waters of the flood came upon the
earth.

In the.vi. hundred year of Noes life / in the second month / in the. xvij
day of the month / yt same day were all the founteynes of the gre^e deep
broken up / and the wyndowes of heaven were opened / and there fell a rain
upon the earth.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes.

And the self same day went Noe / Sem / Ham and Iapheth / Noes sons / and
Noes wife and the. ii^. wives of his sons with them in to the arc: both they
and all manner of beasts in their ki^de / and all manner of catell in their
kind and all manner of worms that crepe upon the earth in their kind / and
all manner of birds in there kind. / and all manner off fowls what soever had
feders. And they came unto Noe in to the arc by cooples / of all flesh yt had
breath of life in it. And they that came / came male and female of every flesh
acordige as God commanded him: and ye Lord shytt the door upon him

And the flood came.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes upon the earth / and the water
increased and bare up the arcke and it was lift up from of the earth And the
water prevayled and increased exceadingly upon the earth: and the arc went
upon he top of the waters.

And the waters prevayled excedingly above mesure upon the earth / so that all
the hye hills which are under all the parts of heaven / were covered:
eve^.xv. cubytes hye prevayled the waters / so that the hills were covered.

And all flesh that moved on the earth / both birds catell and beasts
perisshed / with all that crepte on the earth and all men: so that all that had
the breath of liffe in the nostrels of it through out all that was on dry land
dyed.

Thus was destroyed all that was upon the earth / both man / beasts / worms
and fowls of the ay^^* so that they were destroyed from the earth: save Noe was
reserved only and they that were with him in the arc. And the waters nee
valved upon the earth / an hundred and fyftye days.

The.viij. Chapter.
ANd god remembered Noe and all ye beasts and all ye catell ye were with hi^ in
ye arc And god made a wind to blow upon y^ earth / and y^ waters ceased: and
ye fountaynes of the deep and the wyndowes of heaven were stopte and the rain
of heaven was forbidden / and the waters returned from of ye earth and abated
after the end of an hundred and.l. days.

And the arc rested upon the mountayns of Ararat / the.xvij. day of the.vij.
month. And the waters went away and decreased until the x. month. And the
first day of the tenth month / the tops of the mounteyns appeared.

And after the end of.xl. days. Noe opened the wyndow of the arc which he
had made / and sent forth a raven / which went out / ever goinge and cominge
again / until the waters were dreyed up upon the earth

Then sent he forth a dove from him / to we^e whether the waters were fallen
from of the earth. And when the dove could find no restinge place for her foot
/ she returned to him again unto the arc / for the waters were upon the face
of all the earth. And he put out his hand and took her and pulled her to him in
to the arc

And he abode yet.vij. days mo / and sent out the dove again out of the arc
/ And the dove came to him again about eventyde / and behold: There was in
her mouth a lefe of an olyve tree which she had plucked whereby Noe perceaved
that the waters were abated ^ppon the earth. And he tarried yet.vij. other days /
and sentforth the dove / which from thence forth came no more again to him.

And it came to pass / the syxte hundred and one year and the first day of
the first month / that the matters were dried up upon the earth. And Noe took
off the hatches of the arc and lo ked: And behold / the face of the earth was
dry. So by the.xxvij. day of the second month the earth was dry.

And God spoke unto Noe saying: come out of the arcke / both thou and thy wife
and thy sons and thy sons wives with the. And all the beasts that are with
the whatsoever flesh it be / both foul and catell and all manner worms that
crepe on the earth / bring out with the / and let them move / grow and
multiplye upon the earth. And Noe came out / and his sons and his wife and
his sons wives with him. And all the beasts / and all the worms / and all
the fowls / and all that moved upon the earth / came also out of the arc /
all of one kind together.

And Noe made an altar unto the LORD / and took of all manner of clean beasts
and all manner of clean fowls / and offered sacrify ce upon the altar. And the
LORD smellyd a sweet savoure and said in his heart: I will henceforth no more
curse the earth fo: man's sake / for the imagynacion of man's heart i^ ^^ell /
even from the very youth of him. Morouer I will not destroy from henceforth all
that ^yveth as I have done. Nether shall sowynge ^yme and harvest / cold / and
hete / somere and ^yn * This law and soch like to exequute / were kings and
rulars ordey / ned of God wherefore they ought not to suffer the popes Caimes
thus to shede blood theirs not shed again / neth er yet to set up their ab
hominable se^tuaryes and neck verses clean agenste the ordinance of god /
but un to their da^nacyon
^er / day and night cease / as long as the earth endures.

The.ix. Chapter.
ANd God blessed No^ and his sons / and said unto them* Increase and
multiplye and fill the ert^.

The fear also and dread of you be upon all beasts of the earth / and upon
all fowls of the air / and upon all that crepeth on the earth / and upon all
fyshes of the sea / which are given unto your hands And all that moves upon
the earth havynge life / shall be your meat: Even as y^ grene herbs / so give
I you all thyn ^e. Only the flesh with his life which is his ^loud / se that ye
eat not.

^ For verily the blood of you wherein your ly ^es are will I require: Eue^
of the hand of all ^eastes will I require it / And of the hand of ^an and of
the hand off every man's brother / ^yll I require the life of man: so y^ he
which ^hedeth man's blood / shall have his blood ^hed by man again: for God
made man after ^is own lycknesse. See that ye increase / and ^axe / and be
occupyde upon the earth / and multiplye therein.

Farthermore God spoke unto Noe and to his sons with him saying: see / I make
my bo^d with you and your seed after you / and with all lyvynge thing that is
with you: both foul and catell / and all manner best of the earth that is with
you / of all that comes out of the arc / what soever best of the earth it be.

I make my bond with you / that hence forth all flesh shall not be destroyed
with yt waters of any flood / and yt hence forth there shall not be a flood to
destroy the earth.

And God said. This is the token of my bo^de which I make between me and you /
and between all lyvynge thing that is with you for ever: I will set my bow
in the clouds / and ^^ shall be a sign of the appointment made between me and
the earth: So that when I bring in clouds upon y^ earth / the bow shall appear
in y^ clouds. And than will I think upon my testament which I have made
between me and you / and all that lyveth what soever flesh it be* So that
henceforth there shall be no more wa^ters to make a flood to destroy all flesh.

The bow shall be in the clouds / and I will look upon it / to remember the
everlasting testment between God and all that lyveth upon the earth / what
soever flesh it be. And God said unto Noe: This is the sign of the testamen^
which I have made between me and all flesh is on the earth.

The sons of Noe that came out of the a^^ ke were: Gem / Ham and Iapheth. And
Ham he is the father of Canaa^. These are the.iij. sons of Noe / and of these
was all the world overspred.

And Noe being an husband man / went forth and planted a vyneyarde and draneke
of the wine and was droncke / and lay uncovered in the myddest of his ^e^t.
And Ham the father of Canaan saw his fathers preuytees / and told his ij.
brethren that were without. And Sem and Iapheth took a mantell and put it on
both there shuldere and went backward / and covered there fathers secrets / but
there faces were backward So that they saw not there fathers nakydnes. As
soon as Noe was awaked from his wine and wist what his youngest son had done
unto him / he said: cursed be Canaan / and a seruante of all servants be he to
his brethren. And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Se^ / and Canaan be his
seruante God increase Iapheth that he may dwell in the tents of Sem. And
Canaan be their seruante.

And Noe lived after the floude.iij. hundred and.l. year: So that all the days
of Noe were ix. hundred and.l. year / and than he dyed.

The.x. Chapter.
THese are the generations of the sons of Noe: of Gem / Ham and Iapheth /
which begat them children after the floude.

The sons of Japheth were: Gomyr / Magog / Madai / Jauan / Tuball / Mesech
and Thy ras. And the sons of Gomyr were: Ascenas Ripha^ and Togarma. And the
sons of Jauan were: Elisa / Tharsis / Cithim and Dodanim. Of these came the
Isles of the gentylls in there contres / every man in his speech / kynred and
nation.

The sons of Ham were: Chus Misraim Phut and Canaan. The sons of Chus: were
Seba / Heuila / Sabta / Rayma and Sab^ema. And the sons of Rayma were: Sheba
/ and De dan. Chus also begot Nemrod / which began to be mighty in the earth.
He was a myghtie hunter in the syghte of the Lord: Where of came the proverb:
he is as Nemrod that myghtie hunter in the syghte of the Lord. And the
beginning of his kingdom was Babell / Erech / Achad and Chalne in the land
of Synear: Out of that land came Assure and builded Ninyue / and the cite reho
both / and Calah And Ressen between Ninyue and Chalah. That is a great cite.
And Mizraim begat ludim / Enanum / Leabim / Naphtuhim / Pathrusim and Castuhim:
from whence came the Philystyns / and the Capth^herynes.

Canaan also begat zidon his eldest son and Heth / Jebusi / Emori / Girgosi /

kynreds of the Canaanytes And the costs of the Canaanytes were from Sydon till
thou come to ^erara and to Asa / and till thou come to Sodoma / Gomorra / Adama
Zeboim: eve^ unto Lasa. These were the chyldre of Ham in there kynreddes /
tongues / lands and nations.

And Sem the father of all y^ children of Eber and the eldest brother of
Japheth / begat children also. And his sons were: Elam Assure / Arphachsad /
Lud and Aram. And ye childree of Aram were: Vz / Hul / Gether and Mas And
Arphachsad begat Sala / and Sala begat Eber. And Eber begat.ij. sons. The

of his brother was Jaketan:

Jaketan begat Almodad / Saleph / Hyzarmoneth / Jarah / Hadoram / Vsal / Dikela
/ Obal / Abimael / Seba / Ophir / Heuila and Jobab. All these are the sons of
Jaketan. And the dwelling of them was from Mes^ until thou come unto Sephara
a mountain of the east land. These are the sons o Sem in their kynreddes /
languages / contrees and nations. These are the kynreddes of the sons of Noe
/ in their generations and nations. And of these came the people that were in
the world after the floude.

The.xi. chapter.
ANd all the world was of one tongue and one language. And as they came from the
east / they found a plain in the land of Synear / and there they dwelled.
And they said one to another: come on / let us make brycke and burn it with
fire. So brycke was there stone and slyme was there mortar And they said: Come
on / let us build us a cite and a toure / that the top may reach unto
heaven. And let us make us a name / for perauenture we shall be scatered abroad
over all the earth.

And the Lord came down to see the cite and the toure which the childern of
Ana^ had builded. And the Lord said: See / the people is one and have one
tongue among them all. And this have they begone to do / and will not leave of
from all that they have purposed to do. Come on / let us descend and myngell
their tongue even there / that one understand not what another says. Thus y^
Lord skatered them from thence upon all the earth. And they left of to build
the cite. Wherefore the name of it is called Babell / because that the LORD
there confounded the tongue of all the world. And because that the Lord from
thence / skatered them abroad upon all the earth.

These are the generations of Sem: Se^ was an hundred year old and begat
Arcphachsad ij. year after the floude. And Se^ lyved after he had begot
Arphachsad.v. hundred year an begat sons and daughters.

And Arphacsad lived.xxxv. year and begat Sala / and lyved after he had begot

And Regu when he had lived.xxxij. year begat Serug / and lived after he had

And when Terah was.lxx. year old / he begat Abram / Nahor and Baran.

And these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram / Nahor and Baran.
And Baran begat Lot. And Baran dyed before Terah his father in the land where
he was borne / at Vr in Chaldea. And Abram and Nahor took them wydes. Abra^s
wife was called Sarai. And Nahors wife Mylca the daughter of Baran which was
father of Milca and of Iisca. But Garat was baren and had no child.

Than tofe Terah Abram his son and Lot his son Barans son / and Sarai his
daughter in law his sone Abrams wife. And they went with him from Vr ^^
Chaldea / to go in to the land of Chanaan. And they came to Baran and dwelled
there. And when Terah was ij. hundred year old and.v. he dyed in Baran.

The.xij. Chapter.
THen the Lord said unto Abra^ Get the out of thy contre and from thy fynred
/ and out of thy fathers house / into a land which I will show the. And I
will make of the a myghtie people / and will bless the / and make thy name
great / that thou may be a blessinge. And I will bless the^ that bless the
/ and curse the^ that curse the. And in the shall be blessed all the
generations of the erih.

And Abram went as the Lord badd him / and Lot went with him. Abram was.lxxv.
year old / when he went out of Baran. And Abram took. Sarai his wife and Lot
his brothers son / with all their goods which they had gotten and soulles
which they had begoten in Baran. And they departed to goo in to the land of
Chanaan. And when they were come in to the land of Chanaan / Abram went forth
in to the land till he came unto a place called Sychem / and unto the oak of
More. And the Canaanytes dwelled then in the land.

Then the Lord apeared unto Abram and said: unto thy seed will I give thy
sla^de. And he builded an aultere there unto the LORD which apeared to him.
Then departed he thence unto a mountain that lies on the east side of BETHEL
and pytched his tente: BETHEL being on the west side / and Ay on the cast ^
And he builded there an altar unto the Lord / and called on the name of yt
Lord. And than Abram departed and took his journey southwarde

After this there came a derth in the land. And Abram went down in to Egipte
to soiourne there / for the derth was sore in the land. And when he was come
nigh for to enter in to Egipte / he said unto Sarai his wife. Behold / I know
that thou art a fair woman toloke apo^. It will come to pass therefore when
the Egiptians see the / that they will say: she is his wife. And so shall they
sley me and save the. Say I pray the therefore that thou art my sister / that
I may fare the better by reason of the and that my soul may live for thy
sake.

As soon as he came in to Egipte / the Egiptia^s saw the woman that she was
very fair. And Pharaos lords saw her also / and praised her unto Pharao: So
that she was taken in to Pharaos house / which entreated Abram well for her
sake / so that he had sheep / oxsen and he asses / men servants / maid
servants / she asses and camels.

But God plaged Pharao / and his house with great plages / because of Sarai
Abrams wife. Then Pharao called Abram and said: why have thou thus dealt with
me? Wherefore toldest thou me not that she was thy wife? Why saydest thou that
she was thy sister / and causedest me to take her to my wife? But now loo /
there is the wife / take her and be walking. Pharao also gave a charge unto
his men over Abram / to lead him out / with his wife and all that he had.

The.xiij. Chapter.
THan Abram departed out of Egipte / both he and his wife and all that he had /
and Lot with him unto the south. Abram was very rych in catell / silver and
gold. And he went on his journey from the south even unto BETHEL / and unto the
place where his tente was at the first time between BETHEL and Ay / and unto
the place of the altar which he made before. And there called Abram upon the
name of the Lord.

Lot also which went with him had sheep / catell and tents: so that the land
was not abill to receive / them that they might dwell to gether / for the
substance of their riches was so great / that they could not dwell together*
And there fell a strife between the herdmen of Abrams catell / and the herdmen
of Lots catell. Moreover the Cananytes and the Pherysites dwelled at that time
in the land.

Than said Abram unto Lot: let there be no strife I pray the between the and
me and between my herdmen and thine / for we be brethren. Is not all the hole
land before the? Depart I pray the fro me. If thou wylt take the left hand
/ I will take the right: Or if thou take the right hand I will take the left.
And Lot lift up his eyes and beheld all the contre about Iordane / which was a
plenteous contre of water every where / before the Lord destroyed Sodoma and
Gomorra. Even as the garden of the Lord / and as the land of Egipte till thou
come to Zoar.

Than Lot chose all the costs of Jordane and took his journey from the east.
And so departed the one brother from the other. Abram dwelled in the land of
Canaan. And lot in the cytes of the plain / and tented till he came to Sodom.
But the men of sodom were wyked and sinned exceadyngly agenst the Lord.

And the Lord said unto Abram / after that Lot was departed from him: lift
up thine eyes and look from y^ place where thou art / northward / southward /
eastward and westward / for all the land which thou seiste will I give unto
the and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed / as the dust of the
earth: so that if a man can nombre the dust of the earth / than shall thy seed
also be nombred. Arise and walk about in the land / in the length of it and
in the breadth for I will give it unto the.

Than Abra^ took down his tente / and went and dwelled in the okegrove of
Mamre which is in Ebron and builded there an altar to the Lord.

The.xiiij. Chapter.
ANd it chaunsed within a while / that Amraphel king of Synear / Arioch king
of Ellasar / Redorlao^er king of Elam and Thydeall king of the na^ ^^ons:
made war with Bera king of Sod^h and with Birsa king of Gomorra. And with
Sineab king of Adama / and with Semeaber king of Zebo^^ / and with the king
of Bela Which Bela is called Zoar. All these came together unto the vale of
siddim which is now the salt see Twelve year were they subject to king
kedorlaomer / and in the.xiij. year rebelled.

Therefore in the.xiiij. year came kedorlaomer and the kings that were with him
/ and smote the Raphayms in Astarath Rarnaim / and the Susims in Hain / and the
Emyms in Sabe Rariathaim / and the Horyms in their own mo^nte Seir unto the
plain of Pharan / which bordreth upon the wilderness. And then turned they
and came to the well of iugmente which is Cades / and smote all the contre of
the Amalechites / and also the amorytes that dwell ^n Hazezon Thamar.

Than went out the king of Sodom / and the king of Gomorra / and the king
of Adama and the king of Zebo^m / and the king of Bela no^ called Zoar. And
set their men in array to fight with them in the vale of siddim / that is to
say / with kedorlaomer the king of Elam and with Thydeall king of the Nations
/ and with Amraphel king of Synear. And with ^noch king of Ellasar: four
kings agenste ^^. And that vale of siddim was full of slyme pyttes.

And the kings of Sodom and Gomo^ra fled / and fell there. And the resydue
fled to the mountains. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorra and
all their vitalles / and went their way. And they took Lot also Abrams
brothers son and his good (for he dwelled at Sodom) and departed:

Than came one that had escaped / and told Abram the hebrew which dwelled in
the okegrove of Man^e the Amoryte brother of Eschol and Aner: which were
confederate with Abram. When Abram herd that his brother was taken / he
harnessed his servants borne in his own house.iij. hundred and.xviij. and
followed till they came at Dan. And set himself and his servants in array /
and fell upon them by night / and smote them / and chased them away unto Hoba:
which lies on the left hand of Da^ mascos / and brought again all the
goods / ^ also his brother Lot / and his goods / the we^^e also and the
people.

And as he returned again from the slaughter of kedorlaomer and of the kings
that were with him / than came the king of Sodom against him unto the vale of
Save whi^^ now is called kings dale.

Than Melchisedech king of Salem brought forth breed and wine. And he being
the pressed of the most highest God / blessed him saying. Blessed be Abram unto
the most highest God / possessor of heaven and earth. And blessed be God the
most highest / which has delivered thine enemies in to thy hands. And Ab^^
gave him tithes of all.

Than said the king of Sodom unto Abram: give me the soulles / and take the
goods to thy self. And Abram answered the king of Sodom: I lift up my
hand unto the Lord God most high possessor of heaven and earth / that I will
not take of all y^ is thine / so much as a thread or a shoulacher / lest thou
should say I have made Abra^ rich. Save only that which the young men have
eaten and the parts of the men which went with me. Aner / Escholl and Mamre.
Let them take their parts.

xv. Chapter.
AFter these deades / y^ word of God came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
not Abram / I am thy sh^lde / and thy reward sholbe exceadynge great. And
Abram answered: Lord Jehovah what will thou give me: I goo childlesse / and
the cater of mine housse / this Eleasar of Damasco has a son. And Abram
said: se / to me have thou geven no seed: lo / a lad borne in my housse shall be
mine heir.

And behold / the word of the Lord spoke unto Abram saying: He shall not be
thine heir / but one that shall come out of thine own body shall be thine
heir.

And he brought him out at the doors and say de. Look up unto heaven and tell
the stars / if thou be able to no^bre them. And said unto him Even so shall
thy seed be.

And Abram beleved the Lord / and it was counted to him for rightwesaes. And
he said unto him: I am the Lord that brought the out of Vr in Chaldea to give
the this land to possess it.

And he said: Lord God / whereby shall I know that I shall possess it? And
he said unto him: take an heyfer of.iij. year old / and a she got of three
years old / and a three year old ram / a turtill dove and a young pigeon. And
he took all these and devyded them in the mids / and laid every piece / one
over agenst another. But the fowls devyded he not. And the birds fell on the
care^ses / but Abra^ drove the^ away. And when the son was down / there
fell a slomber upon Abram. And loo / fear and great darkness came open him.

And he said unto Abram: know this of a suertie / that thy seed shall be a
stranger in a land that perteyneth not unto the^. And they shall make bondmen
of them and entreat them evell iiij. hundred years. But the nation whom there
shall serve / will I judge. And after ward shall they come out with great
substance. Eueuerthelesse thou shall goo unto thy fathers in peace / and shall
be buried when thou art of a good age: and in the fourth generation they shall
come hither again / for the wekednesse of the Amo^tes is not yet full.

When the son was down and it was waxed darcke: behold / there was a
smokynge furnisse and a fire brand that went betwenae the said pieces.

And that same day the Lord made a covenaunte with Abram saying: unto thy
seed will I give this land / f^o^ the ryver of Egypt / even unto the great
ryver euphrates: the kenytes / the kenizites / the ^admonites / the Bethites /
the Pherezites / the Rapha^^s / the Amoiytes / the Canaanites / the Gergesues
and the Iebusites.

The.xvi. Chapter.
SArai Abrams wife bare him no childerne. But she had an hand maid an Egiptian
/ whese name was ^agar. Wherefore she said unto Abram. Behold the Lord has
closed me / that I can not bear. I pray the god in unto my maid /
peradventure I shall be multiplied by means of her And Abram herd the voice
of Sarai. Than Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar her maid the Egitian (after Abram
had dwelled* ^. year ^n the land of Canaan^ and gave her to her husbonde Abram
/ to be his wife.

And he went in unto Hagar / and she conceaved. And when she saw that she had
conceyved her mastresse was despised in her syghte. Than said Sarai unto Abram:
Thou do me vnrighte / for I have given my maid into thy bosom: and now
because she seyth that she has co^ceaved / I am despised in her syghte: the
Lord judge between the and me. Than said Abra^ to Sarai* behold / thy maid
is in thy hand / do with her as it pleases the.

And because Sarai fared foul with her / she fled from her. And the angel of
the Lord found her beside a fountain of water in the wyldernes: even by a
well in the way to Sur. And he said* Hagar Sarais maid / whence come thou
and whether wylt thou goo? And she answered: I flee from my mastresse Sarai.
And the angel of the Lord said unto her: return to thy mastresse again /
and submytte thy self under her hands.

And the angel of y^ Lord said unto h^^ I will so increase thy seed / that
it shall no^ be numbered for multitude. And the Lords angel said further unto
her: se / thou art with child and shall bear a son / and shall ca^^ his name
Ismael: because the LORD has herd thy tribulation. ^e will be a wild man /
and his hand will be agenst every man and every man's hand agenst him. And yet
shall he dwell fast by all his brothren.

And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: thou art the God
that lokest on me / for she said: I have of a suertie seen here the back
parties of him that seith me. Wherefore she called the well / the well of the
living that seith me which well is between Cades and Bared.

And Hagar bare Abram a son / and Abram called his sons name which Hagar bare
Ismaell. And Abram was.lxxxvi. year old / when Hagar bare him Ismael.

The.xvij. Chapter.
WHen Abram was nynetye year old and ix. the Lord apeared to him saying: I
am the almyghtie God: walfe be fore me and be incorrupt. And I will make my
bond between the and me / and will multiplye the excedyngly. And Abra^ fell on
his face. And God talked moreover with him saying: I am / behold my testament
is with the / that thou shall be a father of many nations. Therefore / shall
thou no more be called Abram / but thy name shall be Abraham: for a father of
many nations have I made the / and I will multiplye the excedyngly / and will
make nations of the: ye and lynges shall spring out of the.

Moreover I will make my bond between me and the / and thy seed after the / in
their times to be an everlastynge testament / So that I will be God unto the
and to thy seed after the. And I will give unto the and to thy seed after the /
the land where in thou art a stranger: Even all the land of Canaan / foran
everlastynge possession / and will be their God.

And God said unto Abraham: So thou keep my testamente / both thou and thy
seed after the in their times: This is my testamente which ye shall keep
between me and you and thy seed after the / that ye circu^cyse all your men
childern ye shall circumcyse the foreskynne of your flesh / and it shall be a
token of the bond betwixt me and you. And every manchilde when it is viij.
days old / shall be circu^cysed among you in your generations / and all
sernauntes also borne at home or boughte with money though they be strangers
and not of thy seed. The servant borne in thy housse / and he also that is
bought with money / must needs be circumcysed / that my testament may be in
your flesh / for an everlastinge bond. If there be any vncircuncysed
manchilde / that has not the forskynne of his flesh cut of / his soul shall
perish from his people: because he has broken my testament

And God said unto Abraham. Sarai thy wife shall no more be called Sarai: but
Sara shall her name be. for I will bless her and g^ue the a son of her and
will bless her: so that people / ye and kings of people shall spri^ge of her.
And Abraham fell upon his face a^^ laughte / and said in his heart: shall a
child be borne unto him that is an hundred year old / and shall Sara that is
nynetie year old / bere^ And Abraham said unto God. O that Ismaell might
lyve in thy syghte.

The^ said God: na / Sara thy wife shall bear the a sonnea^d thou shall call
his name Isaac. And I will make my bond with him / that it shall be an
everlastynge bond unto his seed after him. And as concerning Ismaell also / I
have herd thy request: loo / I will bless him and increase him / and
multiplye him excedyngly. Twelve princes shall he begete / and I will make a
great nation of him. But my bond will I make with Isaac / which Sara shall
bear un to the: even this time twelve month.

And God left of talking with him / and departed up from Abraham. And Abraham
took Ismaell his son and all the servauntes borne in his housse and all that
was bought with money as many as were menchildren among the me^ of Abraha^s
housse / and circumcysed the foreskynne of their flesh / even the self same
day / as God had said unto him. Abraham was nynetie year old and.ix. when he
cut of the foreskynne of his flesh. And Ismaell his son was.xiij. year old
/ when the foreskynne of his flesh was circumcysed. The self same da^e was
Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son^e. And all the men in his housse /
whether they were borne in his housse or bought with money (though they were
strangers) were circumcysed with him.

The.xviij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord apeared unto him in the okegrove of Mamre as he sat in his tent
door in the heat of the day. And he lift up his eyes and looked: and lo /
three men stood not far from him. And when he saw them / he ran agenst them
from the tent door / and fell to the ground and said: Lord if* I have found
favor in thy sight / goo not by thy servant. Let a little water be fett /
and wash your fete / and rest your selves under the tree: And I will fett a
mo^sell of breed / to comfort your hearts wythall. And tha^ goo your ways /
for even therefore ar ye come to your servaunte. And they answered: Do even so
a^ thou have said.

And Abraham went a pace in to his tent unto Sara and said: make ready at once
three pe^kes of fine meal / kneade it and make cakes. And Abraham ran unto his
beasts and felt ^ calfe that was tender and good / and gave it ^^ to a young
man which made it ready atton^e. And he took butter and myl^ke and the calfe
which he had prepared / and set it before them / and so de himself by them
under the tree: and they ate.

And they said unto him: Where is Sara thy wife? And he said: in the tent.
And he said: I will come again unto the as soon as the fruit can live. And
loo: Sara thy wife shall have a son. That herd Sara / out of the tent door
which was behind his back. Abraham and Sara were both old and well stryken in
age / and it ceased to be with Sara after the manner as it is with wyves. And
Sara laughed in her self saying: Now I am waxed old / shall I give my self
to lust / and my lord old also?

Than said the Lord unto Abraham: wherefore does Sara laughe saying: shall I of
asuer^ebere a child / now when I am old? is the thing to hard for the Lord
to do? In the time appointed will I return unto the / as soon as the fruit
can have life / And Sara shall have a son. Than Sara denied it saying: I
laughed not / for she was afraid. But he said: yes thou laughtest.

Than the men stood up from thence and looked toward Sodom. And Abraham went
with them to bring them on the way. And the Lord said: Can I hyde from
Abraham that thing which I am about to do / seeing that Abraham shall be a
great and a myghtie people / and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
him? For I know him that he will command his children and his household
after him / y^ they keep the way of the Lord / to do after right and
conseyence / that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that he has promised him.

And the Lord said? The cry of Sodom and Gomo^ra is great / and there sin
is exceeding grevous. I will go down and see whether they have done all to
gedder acordynge to that cry which is come unto me or not / that I may know.
And the me^ departed thence and went to Sodomeward. But Abraham stood yet
before y^ Lord / and drew nere and said Wylt thou destroy the rightwes with
the wyked? If there be.l. rightwes within the cite / will thou destroy it and
not spare the place for the sake of.l. rightwes that are therein? That be far
from the / that thou should do after this manner / to sley the rightwes with
the weked / and that the rightwes should be as the weked: that befarre from
the. Should not the judge of all y^ world do acordynge to right? And the
Lord said: If I find in Sodom.l. rightwes within the cy^e / I will spare
all the place for their sakes.

And Abraham answered and said: behold I have taken upon me to speak unto
y^ Lord / and yet am but dust and ashes. What though there lack.v. of.l.
rightwes / wylt thou destroy all the cite for lack of.v? And he said: If I
find there.xl. and.v. I will not destroy them.

And he spoke unto him yet again and said: what if there be xl. found there:
And he said: I will not do it for forties sake. And he said: O let not my
Lord be angrye / that I speak. What if there be found.xxx. there? And he
said: I will not do it / if I find.xxx. there. And he said: Oh / se / I have
begone to speak unto my Lord / what if there be.xx. found there? And he
said: I will not distroy the^ for twe^ties sake. And he said. O let not my
Lord be angrye / that I speak yet / but eue^ once more only. What if ten be
found there?. And he said: I will not destroy the^ for.x. safe.

And the Lord went his way as soon as he had le^te comenynge with Abraham.
And Abraham returned unto his place

The.xix. Chapter.
ANd there came.ij. angels to Sodom at even. And Let satt at the gate of the
cite. And Lor saw the^ / and rose up against them / and he bowed him self to
be ground with his face. And he sayde^ Se lords / turn in I pray you in to
your servauntes house and tarry all night and wash your fete / and rise up
early and go on your ways. And they said: nay / but we will bide in the
streates all night. And he compelled them excedyngly. And they turned in unto
him and en^^ed in to his house / and he made them a feast and did bake sweet
cakes / and they ate.

But before they went to rest / the men of the cite of Sodom compassed the
house rownde about both old and young / all the people from all quarters. And
they called unto Lot and said unto him: where are the men which came in to thy
house to night? bring the^ out unto us that we may do our lust with them.

And Lot went out at doors unto them and shote the door after him and said:
nay for gods sake brethren / do not so wekedly. Behold I have two daughters
which have known no man / the^ will I bring out unto you: do with them as it
seems you good: Only unto these men do nothing / for therefore came they under
the shadow of my rofe. And they said: come hither. And they said: came
thou not in to so georne / and will thou be now a judge? we will suerly deal
worse with the than with them

And as they preased sore upon Lot and began to breaf^ up the door / the
men put forth their hands and pulled ^ot in to the house to them and short to
the door. And the men that were at the door of the house / they smote with
blyndnesse both small and great: so that they could not find the door.

And the men said moreover unto ^ ot: If thou have yet here any son in law
or sons or daughters or what so ever thou have in the cite / bring it out of
this place: for we must destroy this place / because the cry of the^ is great
before the Lord. Wherefore he has sent ^^ to destroy it.

And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons in law which should have married
his daughters / and said: stand up and get you out of this place / for the
Lord will destroy the cite. But he seemed as though he had mocked / unto his
sons in law.

And as the morning arose the angels caused Lot to speed him saying. Stand
up / take thy wife and thy two daughters and that that is at hand / lest thou
perish in the sin of the cite. And as he prolonged the time / the men caught
both him / his wife and his two daughters by the hands / because the Lord was
merciful unto him / and they brought him forth and set him without the cite.

When they had brought them out / they said: Save thy life and look not
behind the nether tarry thou in any place of the contre / but save thy self in
the mountain / lest thou perisshe. Than said Lot unto them: Oh nay my lord:
behold / in as much as thy servaunte has fownde grace in thy syghte / now
make thy mercy great which thou show unto me in saying my life. For I can
not save my self in the mountayns / lest some misfortune fall upon me and I
dye. Behold / here is a cite by / to flee unto / and it is a little one: let me
save my self therein: is it not a little one / that my soul may live?

And he said to him: se I have received thy request as concerning this thing
/ that I will not overthrowe this city for the which thou have spoken. Haste
the / and save thyselfe there / for I can do nothing till thou be come in
thither. And therefore the name of the cite is called Zoar. And the sone was
upon the earth when Lot was entered into Zoar.

Than the Lord rayned upon Sodom and Gomoara / brymstone and fire from the
Lord out of heaven / and overthrewe those cities and all the region / and all
that dwelled in the cytes / and that that grew upon the earth. And lots wife
looked behind her / and was turned in to a pillare of salt.

Abraham rose up early and got him to the place where he stood before the Lord
/ and looked toward Sodom and Gomorra and toward all the land of that contre.
And as he looked: behold / the smoke of the contre arose as it had been the
smoke of a sornace. But yet when God destroyed the ^^nes of y^ regio^ / he
thought a pon Abraham: and sent Lot out from the danger of the overthrowenge /
when he overthrewe the cities where Lot dwelled.

And Lot departed out of Zoar and dwelled in the mountayns and his.ij.
daughters with him for he feared to tarry in Zoar: he dweld therefore in a cave /
both he and his.ij. daughters also.

Than said the elder unto the younger o^^e father is old / and there are no
moo men in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the world. Come
therefore / let us give our father wine to drink / and let us lie with him
that we may save seed of our father. And thry gave their father wine to drink
that same night. And the elder daughter went and lay with her father. And he
perceived it not / nether when she lay down / nether when she rose up.

And on the morrow the elder said unto the younger: behold / yesternyghte lay
I with my father. Let us give him wine to drink this night also / and goo
thou and lie with him / and let us save seed of our father. And they gave
their father wine to drink that night also. And the younger arose and lay
with him. And he perceaved it not: nether when she lay down / nether when she
rose up.

Thus were both the daughters of let with child by their father And the elder
bare a sone and called him Moab / which is the father of the Moabytes unto this
day. And the younger bare a son^e and called him Ben Am^^ / which is the father
of the children of Ammon unto this day.

The.xx. Chapter.
ANd Abraham departed thence toward the sou^hcontre and dwelled between ^ades
and Sur and sogeorned in Gerar. And Abraham said of Sara his wife / that she
was his sister. Than Ab^melech king of Gerar sent and fett Sara away.

And God came to Abimelech by night in a dream and said to him: Se / thou
art but a deed man for the womans safe which thou have taken away / for she is
a man's wife. But Abimelech had not yet come nigh her / and therefore said: lord
will thou sley rightewes people? said not he unto me / that she was his
sister? ye and said not she herself that he was her brother? with a pure
heart and innocent hands have I done this.

And God said unto him in a dream. I wot it well that thou dydest it in the
pureness of thy heart. And therefore I kept y^ that thou should not sin
agenst me / nether suffered I the to come nygh her. Now therefore deliver the
man his wife again / for he is a prophet. And let him pray fo: the that thou
may live. But and if thou deliver her not again / be sure that thou shall
dye the death / with all that thou have.

Than Abimelech rose up be times in the morning and called all his servauntes
/ and told all these things in their ears / and the men were sore a frayde.
And Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him: What have thou done unto us /
and what have I offended the / that thou should b^ynge on me and on my
kingdom so great a sin? thou have done deeds unto me that ought not to be
done. And Abimelech said morouer unto Abraham: What saw thou that moved the
to do this thing?

And Abraham Answered. I thought that peradve^ture the fear of God was not in
this place / and that they should sley me for my wyfes safe: yet in very deed
she is my sister / the daughter of my father / but not of my mother^ and became
my wife. And after God caused me to wandre out of my fathers house / I said
unto her: This kyndnesse shall thou show unto me in all places where we come /
that thou say of me / how that I am thy brother.

Than took Abimelech sheep and oxen / men* servauntes and wemenseruauntes and
gave them unto Abraham / and delyvered him Sara his wife again. And Abimelech
said: behold the land lies be fore the / dwell where it pleases y^ best.
And unto Sara he said: Se I have given thy brother a thousende pieces of
silver / behold he shall be a covering to thine eyes unto all that are with
the and unto all men and an excuse.

And so Abraham prayde unto God / and God healed Abimeleh and his wife and his
maidens / so that they bare. For the Lord had closed to / all the matryces of
the house of Abimelech / because of Sara Abraham's wife.

The.xxj. Chapter
THe lord visyted Sara as he had said and did unto her acordynge as he had
spoken. And Sara was with child and bare Abraham a son in his old age even
the same season which the Lord had appointed. And Abraham called his sons
name that was borne unto him which Sara bare him Isaac: and Abra^ circu^cysed
Isaac his son when he was.viij. days old / as God commanded him And
Abraham was an hundred year olde*when his son Isaac was borne unto him.

And Sara said: God has made me a laughinge stock: for all yt hear / will
laugh at me She said also: who would have said unto Abraham / that Sara
should have given childern suck / or yt I should have borne him a son in his
old age: The child grew and was wened / and Abraham made a great f^ast / the
same day that Isaac was wened.

Sara saw the son of Hagar the Egiptian which she had borne unto Abraham / a
mocking. Then she said unto Abraham: put away this bondemayde and her son:
for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac: But the
words seemed verey greavous in Abraham's syc^hte / because of his son. Than
the Lord said unto Abraham: let it not be greavous unto the / because of the
ladd and of thy bondmayde: But in all that Sara has said unto the / hear her
voice / for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Moreover of the son of the
Bondwoman will I make a nation / because he is thy seed.

And Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottell with
water / and ga ue it unto Hagar / putting it on her shulders with the lad also
/ and sent her away. And she departed and wa^dred up and down in the
wyldernes of Berseba. When the water was spent that was in the botell / she
cast the lad under a bush and went and satt her out of syghte a great way / as
it were a bowshote off: For she said: I will not se the lad dye. And she satt
down out of syghte / and lift up her voice and wept.

And God herd the voice of the child. And the angel of God called Hagar out
of heaven and said unto her: What ayleth the Hagar? Fear not / for God has
herd the voice of the child where he lies. Arise and lift up the lad / and
take him in thy hand / for I will make off him a great people. And God opened
her eyes and she saw a well of water.

And she went and filled the bottell with water / and gave the boy drink. And
God was with the lad / and he grew and dweld in the wilderness / and became
an archer. And he dweld in the wilderness of Pharan. And his mother got him a
wife out of the land of Egypt.

And it chanced the same season / that Abimelech and Phicoll his chief
captain spoke unto Abraham saying: God is with the in all that thou doist. Now
therefore swear unto me even here by God / that thou wylt not hurt me nor my
childern / nor my childerns childern. But that thou shall deal with me and the
contre where thou art a stranger / acordynge unto the kyndnesse that I have
showed the. Then said Abraham: I will swear.

And Abraham rebuked Abimelech for a well of water / which Abimelech servaun^es
had taken away. And Abimelech answered I wist not who did it: Also thou
toldest me not / nether herd I of it / but this day.

And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave t^^^ unto Abimelech. And they made
both of them a bond together. And Abraham se^ vij. lambs by them selves. And
Abimelech said unto Abraham: what mean these.vij. lamdes which thou have set
by them selves. And he answered: vij. lambs shall thou take of my hand / that
it may be a witness unto me / that I have dygged this well: Wherefore the
place is called Berseba / because they swear both of them. Thus made they a
bond to gether at Berseba.

Than Abimelech and Phicoll his chief captain rose up and turned again unto
the land of the Philistines. And Abraham planted a wodd in Berseba / and
called there / on the name of the Lord the everlastynge God: and dwelt in the
Phelistinla^de a long season

The.xxij. Chapter.
AFter these deeds / God did prove Abraham and said unto him: Abraham. And he
answered: here am I. And he said: take thy only son Isaac whom thou love
/ and get the unto the land of Moria / and sacrifyce him there for a sacrifyce
upon one of the mountayns which I will show the Than Abraham rose up early in
the morning and sadled his ass / and took two of his meyny with him / and
Isaac his son: and clove woo for the sacrifyce / and rose up and go^t him to
the place which God had appointed him.

The third day Abraham lift up his eyes and saw the place a far of / and
said unto his young men: bide here with the ass. I and the lad will goo yonder
and worship and come again unto you. And Abraham took the wodd of the
sacrifyce and laid it upon Isaac his son / and took fire in his hand and a
knyfe. And they went both of them together.

Than spoke Isaac unto Abraham his father and said: My father? And he answered
here am I my son. And he said: Se here is fire and wodd / but where is the
sheep for sacrifyce? And Abraham said: my son / God will provide him a sheep
for sacrifyce. So went they both together.

And when they came unto the place which God showed him / Abraham made an
altar there and dressed the wodd / and bownde Isaac his son and laid him on
the altar / above upon the wodd. And Abraham stretched forth his hand / and
took the knyfe to have killed his son.

Than the angel of the Lord called unto him from heaven saying: Abraham /
Abraham. And he answered: here am I. And he said: lay not thy hands upon the
child nether do any thing at all unto him / for now I know that thou fear
God / in yt thou have not kept thine only son from me. And Abraham lyfted up
his eyes and looked about: and behold / there was a ram caught by the horns
in a thykette. And he went and took the ram and offered him up for a sacrifyce
in the stead of his son And Abraham called the name of the place / the Lord
will see: wherefore it is a come^ saying this day: in the mount will the Lord
be seen.

And the Angel of the Lord cried unto Abraham from heaven the second time
saying: by my self have I sooor^e (says the Lord) because thou have done
this thing and have not spared thy only son / that I will bless th and
multiplye thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sonde upon the sea side.
And thy seed shall possess the ^ates of his enymies. And in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed / because thou have obeyed my voice

Go turned Abraham again unto his young men / and they rose up and went to
gether to Ber seba. And Abraham dwelt at Berseba

And it chau^sed after these t^i^ges / that one told Abraham saying: Behold /
Milcha she has also borne childern unto thy brother Nachor: Hus his eldest
son and Bus his brother / and Remuell the father of the Smans / and Cesed /
and Haso / and Pildas / and Iedlaph / and Bethuel. And Bethuel begat Rebecca.
These.viij. did Milcha bear to Nachor Abraham's brother. And his concubyne
called Rheuma she bare also Tebah / Saham / Thahas and Maacha.

The.xxiij. Chapter.
SAra was an hundred and.xxvij. year old (for so long lived she) and than
dyed in a head cite called Hebron in the land of Canaan. Than Abraham came to
mome Sara and to weep for her. And Abraham stood up from the coorse and talked
with the sons of heth saying: I am a stranger and a foryner among you /
give me a possession to bury in with you / that I may bury my dead out of my
sight.

And the children of heth answered Abraham saying unto him: hear us lord /
thou art a prince of God among us. In the chefest of our sepulchers bury thy
dead: None of us shall forbydd ye his sepulcher / yt thou should not bury thy
dead therein. Abraham stood up and bowed hi^ self before y^ people of y^
land y^ children of heth.

And he comened with them saying: If it be your minds y^ I shall bury my
dead out of my sight / hear me and speak for me to Ephron the son of
Zoar: and let him give me the dubill cave which he has in the end of his field
/ for as much money as it is worth / let him give it me in the presence of you
/ for a possession to bury in. For Hephron dwelled among ye childern of heth.

Than Ephron the Hethite answered Abraham in the audye^ce of the childern of
Heth and of all that went in at the gates of his cite / saying: Not so / my
lord / but hear me: The field give I the / and the cave that therein is /
give I the also / And even in the presence of the sons of my people geve Iit
the to bury thy deed in. Than Abraham bowed himself before the people of the
land and spoke unto Ephro^ in the audyence of the people of the contre saying:
I pray the hear me / I will give sylver for the field / take it of me / ^o so
will I bury my deed there.

Ephron answered Abraham saying unto him My lord / harken unto me. The land
is worth iiij. hundredth sycles of silver: But what is that betwixt the and me^
bury thy deed. And Abraham harkened unto Ephron and weyde him the sylver which
he had said in the audyence of the sons of Heth. Even.iiij. hundred silver
sycles of current money among merchants

Thus was the field of Ephron where in the dubbill cave is before Ma^re: even
the field and the cave that is therein and all the trees of the field which
grow in all the borders round about / made sure unto Abraham for a
possession / in the syghte of the childern of Heth and of all that went in at
the gates of the cite. And then Abraham buried Sara his wife in the double cave
of the field that lies before Ma^re / otherwise called Ebron in the land of
Canaan. And so both the field and the cave that is therein / was made unto
Abraham / a sure possession to bury in / of the sons of Heth.

The.xxiiij. Chapter
ABraham was old and stryken in days / and the Lord had blessed him in
allthinges. And he said unto his eldest servaunte of his house which had the
rule over all that he had: Put thy hand under my thye that I may make the
swear by the Lord that is God of heaven and God of the earth / that thou shall
not take a wife unto my son / of the daughters of the canaanytes / among
which I dwell. But shall goo unto my contre and to my kynred / and there take a
wife unto my son Isaac.

Tha^ said the servant unto him: what and if the woman will not agree to
come with me unto this land / shall I bring thy son again unto the land
which thou came out of* And Abraham said unto him: bewarre of that / that
thou b^^ge not my son thither. The Lord God of heaven which took me from my
fathers house and from the land where I was borne / and which spoke unto me
and swear unto me saying: unto thy seed will I give this land / he shall send
his angel before the / y^ thou may take a wife unto my son from thence.
Nevertheless if the woman will not agree to come with the than shall thou be
with out danger of this ooth. But above all thing bring not my son thither
again. And the servant put his hand under the thye of Abraham and swear to
him as concerning that matter.

And the servant took.x. camels of the camels of his master and departed /
and had of all manner goods of his master with him / and stood up and went to
Mesopotamia / unto the cyr^e of Nahor. And made his camels to lie down without
the city by a wels side of water / at even: about the time that women come
out to draw water / and he said.

Lord God of my master Abraham / send me good speed this day / and show
mercy unto my master Abraham. ^o I stand here by the well of water and the
daughters of the men of this city will come out to draw water: Now the
damsel to whom I say / stoop down thy pytcher and let me drink. If she
say / drink / and I will give thy camels drink also / y^ same is she that
thou have ordened for they servaunte Isaac: ye and thereby shall I know that
thou have showed mercy on my master.

And it came to pass yet he had leeft spakynge / that Aebecca came out / the
daughter of Bethuell / son to Melcha the wife of Nahor Abraham's brother / and
her pytcher upon her shulder: The damsel was very fair to look upon / and yet
a maid and unknown of man.

And she went down to the well and filled her pytcher and came up again. Then
the servant rann^ unto her and sa^de: let me syppe a little water of thy
pither. And she said: drink my lord.

And she besied and la^e down her pytcher upon ^^^ arm and gave him drink.
And when she had geven him drink / she said: I will draw water for thy
camels also / until they have drunk enough. And she poured out her pitcher in
to the trough hastily and ran again unto the well / to fe^t water: and drew
for all his camels.

And the fellow wondered at her. But held his peace / to we^e whether the Lord
had made his ^ou^ney prosperous or not. And as the camels had left drynckynge
/ he took an earynge of half a sicle weght and. ij golden bracelettes for her
^a^des / of.x. sycles weight of gold and said unto her: whose daughter art
thou? tell me: is there rowme in thy fathers house / for us to lodge in* And
she said unto him: I am the daughter of Bethuell the son of M^^cha which she
bare unto Nahor: and said moreover unto him: we have litter and prauonder
enough and also rowme to lodge in.

And the man bowed himself and worshipped the Lord and said: blessed be the
Lord God of my master Abraham which ceasseth not to deal mercyfully and truly
with my master / And has brought me the way to my masters brothers house. And
the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these things. And
Rebecca had a brother called Laban.

And Laban ran out unto the man / to the well: for as soon as he had seen
the earynges and the bracelettes upon his sisters hands / and herd the words
of Rebecca his sister saying thus said the man unto me / than he went out unto
the man. And ^oo / he stood yet with the camels by the well side. And Laban
said: come in thou blessed of the Lord. Wherefore stondest thou without? I
have dressed the house and made rowme for the camels. And than the man came in
to the house. And he vnbrydeld the camels: God bleseth us whe^^ ^e geveth us
^is benefi^^s: and cur^^th us / when he ta^^th them a ^aye.
and brought ^^^ter and prauonder for the camels / and water to w^she his fete
and their fete that were with him / and there was meat set before him to eat.

But he said: I will not eat / until I have said mine eare^de: And he said
/ say on. And he said: I am Abraha^s servaunte / and the LORD has * blessed
my master out of measure that he is become great and has geven him sheep oxen
/ silver and gold / men servauntes / maid servauntes / camels and asses. And
Sara my masters wife bare him a son / when she was old: and unto him has he
geven all that he has.

And my master made mes^ere saying: Thou shall not take a wife to my son /
among the daughters of the cananyres in whose land I dwell. But thou shall
goo unto my fathers house and to my ^ynred / and there take a wife unto my
son. And I said unto my master. What if the wife will not follow me* And he
said unto me: The Lord before whom I walk / will send his angel with the
and prosper thy journey that thou shall take a wife for my son / of my kynred
and of my fathers house. But and if (when thou come unto my kynred) they will
not give the one / tha^ shall thou bear no perell of mine oothe.

And I came this day unto the well and said: O Lord / the God of my master
Abraham / if it be so that thou make my journey which I go / prosperous:
behold / I sto^de by this well of water / And when a virgyn comes forth to
draw water / and I say to her: give me a little water of thy pitcher to drink
/ and she say again to me: drink thou / and I will also draw water for thy
camels: that same is the wife / whom the Lord has prepared for my masters
son.

And before I had made an end of speaking in mine heart: behold Rebecca came
forth / and her pitcher on her shulder / and she went down unto the well and
drew. And I said unto her give me drink. And she made have and took down
her p^^cher from of her / and said: drink / and I will give thy camels drink
also. And I drank / and she gave the camels drink also. And I asked her
saying: whose daughter art thou? And she answered: the daughter of Bathuell
Nahors son whom Milca bare unto him.

And I put the earynge upon her face and the bracelettes upon her hondes. And I
bowed myself and worshepped the Lord and blessed the Lord God of my master
Abraham which had brought me the right way / to take my masters brothers
daughter unto his son. Now therefore if ye will deall mercyfully and truly
with my master / tell me. And if no / tell me also: that I may turn me to the
right hand or to the left.

Than answered Laban and Bathuel saying: The thing is proceeded even out of the
lord / we can not therefore say unto the / either good or bad: Behold Rebecca
before thy face / take her and goo / and let her be thy masters sons wife^ /
even as the Lord has said* And when Abraham's servaunte herd their words /
he bowed him self unto the Lord / ^^a^^ upon the earth. And the sero^unte took
forth (...) of silver and iewelles of gold and raiment / and gave them to
Rebecca: But unto her brother and to her mother / he gave spyces. And then they
ate and drank / both he and the men that were with him / and tarried all night
and rose up in the morning.

And he said: let me depart unto my master. But her brother and her mother
said: let the damsel abide with us a while / and it be but even.x. days /
and than goo thy ways. And he said unto them / hinder me not: for the lord
has prospered my journey. Send me away y^ I may goo unto my master. And
they said: let us call the damsel / and wit what she says to the matter.
And they called forth Rebecca and said unto her: will thou goo with this man*
And she said: Ye.

Than they brought Rebecca their sister on the way and her norse and Abraha^s
servaunte / and the men that were with him. And they To bless a ma^s neyboure
is t^ pray for hand to wiss him good and not (...) wagge.ij. gers ou^ him.
blessed Rebecca and said unto her: Thou art our sister / grow in to
thousand thousands / and thy seed possess ye gates of their emmes. And
Rebecca arose and her damsels / and satt the^ up apo^ the camels and went their
way after the man. And ye servaunte took Rebecca and went his way

And Isaac was a comi^ge from the well of y^ lyvynge and seeing / for he dwelt
in the s^uth co^tre / and was gone out to walk in his meditatio^s before y^
eue^ tide. And he lift up his eyes and looked / and behold y^ camels were
cominge. And Rebecca lift up her eyes / and when she saw Isaac / she lyghted
of the camel and said unto ye servaunte: what man is this yt comes agenst us
in the feld? And the servau^te said: it is my master. And then she took her
mantell and put it about her. And the servau^te told Isaac all that he had
done. The^ Isaac brought her in to his mother Saras tente / and took Rebecca
and she became his wife / and he loved her: and so was Isaac comforted over his
mother.

The.xxv. Chapter
Abraham took hi^ another wife called Retura / which bare hi^ Simram / Jacksam /
Medan / Midia^ Iesback and Suah. And J^cksan begat Seba and Deda^. And the
sons of Dedan were Assurim / Letusim and Leumim. And the sons of Midian
were Epha / Epher / Hanoch / Abida and Elda. All these were the childern of
Bethura. But Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. And unto the sons of
his concubines he have gifts / and sent them away from Isaac his son (while
he yet lyved) east waro / unto the east contre.

These are the days of the life of Abraham which he lyved: an hundred
and.lxxv. year and than fell seek and dyed / in a lusty age (when he had lyved
enough) and was put unto his people. And his sons Isaac and Ismael buried hi^
in the duble cave in the feld of Ephro^ son of Zoar the Hethite before Man^e.
Which field abraham boughte of the sons of Heth: There was Abraham buried and
Sara his wife. And after y^ deeth of Abraham God blessed Isaac his son which
dweld by the well of the lyvige and seige.

These are the generatio^s of Ismael Abraha^s son / which Hagar the Egiptia^
Saras hand maid bare unto Abraham. And these are the names of the sons of
Ismaell / with their names in their ki^reddes. The eldest son of Ismael
Neu^^oth / the^ Redar / Adbeel / Mibsa^ / Misma Duma / Masa / Hadar / Thema /

seek and dyed and was laid unto his people. And he dweld from Euila unto Sur
y^ is before Egypt / as men go toward the Assir^a^s. And he dyed in the
presence of all his brethren.

And these are the generatio^s of Isaac Abraha^s son: Abraham begat Isaac.
And Isaac was.xl. year old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of
Bethuel the Sirian of Mesopotamia and sister to Iaban the Sirien.

And Isaac made intercession unto ye Lord for his wife: because she was bare^:
and ye Lord was i^treated of hi^ / and Rebecca his wife conceived: and ye
childern strove together within her, the^ she said: if it should goo so to
pass / what helps it yt I am with child? And she went and axed ye Lord.
And ye Lord said unto her there are.ij. manner of people in the womb and ij.
nations shall spring out of thy bowels / and the one nation shall be myghtier
than the other / and the eldest shall be servaunte unto the younger.

And when her time was come to be delivered behold: there were.ij. twyns in
her womb. And he that came out first / was read and rough over all as it were
an hyde: and they called his name Esau. And after ward his brother came out and
his hand holding Esau by the hele. Wherefore his name was called Jacob. And
Isaac was.lx. yereolde when she bare the^: and the boy^ es grew / and Esau
beam a conynge hunter and a till man. But Jacob was a simple man and dwelled
in the tents. Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venyso^ / but
Rebecca loved Jacob

Jacob sod potage and Esau came from the feld and was fai^ne / and said to
Jacob: let me syppe of yt read potage / for I am faynne. And therefore was his
name called Edom. And Jacob said: sell ^e this day thy byrthrighte. And Esau
answered: Loo I am at the point to dye / and what profit shall this
byrthrighte do me? And Jacob said / swear to me then this day. And he swore
to him and sold his byrthrighte unto Jacob.

Than Jacob gave Esau bread and potage of read rise. And he ate and drunk and
rose up and went his way. And so Esau regarded not his byrthrighte.

The.xxvi. Chapter.
ANd there fell a derth in ye land / passinge the first derth yt fell in the
days of Abraham. Wherefore Isaac went unto Abimelech king of y^ Philistia^s
unto Gerar. The^ the Lord apeared unto him ^ said goo not down in to Egipte
/ but bide in y^ land which I say unto ye: Sogeorne in this land / and I will
be with y^ and will bless y^: for unto the and unto thy sede I will give all
these co^treis And I will perform the oothe which I swore unto Abraham thy
father / and will multiplye thy seed as y^ stars of heaven / and will give
unto thy seed all these contreis. And through thy seed shall all the nations of
the earth be blessed / because yt Abraham harkened unto m^ voice and kept mine
ordinances / co^mau^dme^tes / statutes and laws

And Isaac dwelled in Gerar. And y^ me^ of the place asked hi^ of his wife /
and he said yt she was his sister: for he feared to call her his wife lest
the me^ of the place should have killed him for her sake / because she was
bewtyf^llto ye eye. And it happened after he had been there long time / y^
Abimelech king of y^ Philistia^s looked out at a wyndow and saw Isaac
sportinge with Rebecca his wife. And Abimelech send for Isaac and said: se /
she is of a suertie thy wife / and why saydest thou yt she was thy sister? And
Isaac said unto hi^: I thought yt I might perad venture have dyed for her
sake. The^ said Abimelech: whi have thou done this unto us? one of ye people
might lightely have line by thy wife and so should thou have brought sin
upon us Tha^ Abimelech charged all his people saying: he yt touches this man
or his wife / shall surely ^ye for it.

And Isaac sowed in y^ land / and found in y^ same year an hundred bushels:
for ye Lord blessed hi^ / and the man waxed mighty / and went forth and grew
till he was exceadinge great / yt he had possession of sheep / of oxe^ and a
myghtie household: so y^ the Philestians had envy at him: In so much y^ they
stopped and filled up with earth / all the wells which his fathers servauntes
dygged in his father Abraham's time. Than said Abin elcch unto Isaac: get the
sro^ me / for thou art myhhtier then we a great deal.

Than Isaac departed thense and pitched his tente in the valey Gerar and dwelt
there* And Isaac dug again / the wells of water which they dygged in the
days of Abraham his father which the Philestia^s had stop after ^ death of
Abraham / and gave the^ the same names which his father gave the^. As Isaacs
servants dygged in the valey / they found a well of springynge water. And
the herdme^ of Gerar did strive with Isaacs herdme^ saying: the water is ours
Than called he the well Eseck because they strove with him.

Than dygged they another well / and they strove for yt also. Therefore called
he it Sitena. And than he departed the^se and dygged another well for the which
they strove not: therefore called he it Rehoboth sai^ge: y^ Lord has now made
us rowme and we are increased upon the earth. Afterward departed he thence and
came to Berseba

And the Lord apered unto hi^ the same night and said. I am the God of
Abraham thy father / fear not for I am with the and will bless the and
multiplye thy sede for my seruau^te Abraham's sake. And than he builded an
altar there and called upon the name of the Lord / and there pitched his
tente. And there Isaacs servauntes dygged a well.

Than came Abimelech to him from Gerar and Ahusath his friend and Phicol his
chief captain. And Isaac said unto the^: wherefore come ye to me / seige ye
hate me and have put me away from you? Than said they: we saw that the Lord
was with the / and therefore we said that there should be an oothe betwixt us
and the / and that we would make a bond with the: y^ thou shuldeste do us no
hurt / as we have not touched the and have done unto the nothing but good /
and se^d the away in prace: for thou art now the blessed of the Lord. And he
made the^ a feast / and they ate and dronke. And they lose up by times in the
morning and swear one to another. And Isaac sent the^ away. And they departed
from him in peace.

And ye same day came Isaacs servau^tes and told hi^ of a well which they had
dygged: and said unto hi^ / that they had found water. And he called it Seba
/ wherefore the name of the cy^^ is called Berseba unto this day.

The.xxvij. Chapter.
WHen Esau was.xl. year old / he took to wife Judith the daughter of Bery an
Hethite / and Basmath the ^^ughter of Elon an Hethite also / which were
dishobedient unto Isaac and Rebecca* And it came to pass that Isaac wexed old
and his eyes were dymme / so that he could not see. Tha^ ca^^ed he Esau his
eldest son and said on to him: mi son. And he said unto him: hear am I.
And he said: behold / I am old and know not the day of mi death: Now
therefore take thy weape^s / thy quiver and thy bow / and get the rothe feldes
and take me some venyson and make me meat such as I love / and bring it me
and let me eat that my sou^^* may bless the before that I dye:

But Rebecca hard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And as soon as Esau was
gone to the field to catch venyson and to bri^ge it / she spoke unto Jacob her
son sainge? Behold I have herd thy father talkinge with Esau thy brother and
saying: bring me venyson and make me meat that I may eat and bless the
before the Lord yer I dye. Now therefore my son hear my voice in that which
I command the: get the to the flock / and bring me thence.ij. good fiddes
/ and I will make meat of the^ forthi father / soch as he loves. And thou
shall bri^ge it to thy father and he shall eat / y^ he may bliss the before
his death

Than said Jacob to Rebecca his mother. Behold Esau mi brother is rugh and
Iam smooth. Mi father shall peradventure feel me / and I shall seem unto hi^ as
though I went about to be gyle hi^ / and so shall he bri^ge a curse upon me
and not a blessi^ge: and his mother said unto him. Upon me be thy curse my
son / only hear my voice and goo and fetch me them. And Jacob went and fett
them and brought them to his mother.

And his mother made meat of them according as his father loved And she went
and fett goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau which she had in the house
with her / and put them upon Jacob her youngest son / and she put the skynnes
upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck. And she put y^ meat and
bread which she had made in the ho^de of her son Jacob

And he went in to his father saying: my father / And he a^swered: here am I /
who art thou my son? And Jacob said unto his father: I am Esau thy eldest
son / I have done acordinge as thou baddest me / up and sytt and eat of my
venyson / that thy soul may bless me. But Isaac said unto his son. How
comes it that thou have fownde it so quicly my son? He answered: The Lord
thy god brought it to my hand. Than said Isaac unto Jacob: come nere and let
me feel the my son / whether thou be my son Esau or not. Than went Jacob to
Isaac his father / and he felt him and said the voice ^^ Jacobs voice / but
the hands ar y^ hands of Esau. And he knew him not / because his hands were
rough as his brother Esau^ hands? And so he blessed him.

And he axed him / art thou my son Esau? And he said: that I am. Than said
he: bring me and let me eat of my sons venyson / that my soul may bless
the. And he brought him / and he ate. And he brought him wine also / and he
drank. And his father Isaac said unto him: come nere and kiss me my son.
And he went to him and kissed him. And he smelled y^ sauoure of his rayme^t and
blessed hi^ and said See / y^ smell of my son is as y^ smell of a feld which
the lord has blessed. God give the of y^ dew of heaven and of the fatness
of the earth and ple^tie of corn and wine. People be thy servauntes and nations
bow unto the. Be lord over thy brethren / and thy mothers children stoop
unto the. Cursed be he yt curses the / and lessed be he that blesses the.

As soon as Isaac had made an end of blessi^g / Jacob and Jacob was scace gone
out from the preasence of Isaac his father: then came Esau his brother from his
hunting: And had made also meat / and brought it in unto his father and said
unto him: Arise my father and eat of thy sons venyson / that thy soul may
bless me. Tha^ his father Isaac said unto him. Who art thou? he answered I am
thy eldest son Esau.

And Isaac was greatly astoyned out of mesure and said: Where is he then that
has hu^ted venyson and brought it me / and I have eaten of all before thou
cames^ / and have blessed him / and he shall be blessed still. When Esau her de
the words of his father / he cried out greatly and bitterly above mesure / and
said unto his father: bless me also my father. And he said thy brother came
with subtilte / and has taken away thy blessing. Than said he: He may well
be called Jacob / for he has undermined me now.ij. times / first he took away
my byrthrighte: and se / now has he taken away my blessing also. And he
said / have thou kept neu^^ a blessing for me?

Isaac answered and said unto Esau: behold I have made him thy Lord and all
his mothers children have I made his servants. Moreover with come and wine
have I stablesshed him / what ca^ I do unto the now my son? And Esau said
unto his father? have thou but yt one blessing my father? bless me also my
father: so lyfted up Esau his royce and wept Tha^ Isaac his father answered
and said unto him

Behold thy dwelling place shall have of the fatness of the earth / and of
the dew of heaven from above. And with thy sword shall thou live and shall be
thy brothers servant But the time will come / when thou shall get the
mastrye / and lowse his yocke from of thy neck.

And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing yt his father blessed him with
all / and said in his heart: The days of my fathers so^owe are at hand / for
I will sley my brother Jacob. And these words of Esau her eldest son / were
told to Rebecca. And she sent and called Jacob her youngest son / and said
unto hi^: behold thy brother Esau threatens to kill the: Now therefore my
son hear my voice / make the ready and flee to Laba^ my brother at Ha^an
Andtarie with him a while / until thy brothers fearsnes be swaged / and until
the brothers wrath turn away from the / and he forgett that which thou have
done to him. Tha^ will I send and fett the away from thence. Why should I
lose you both in one day.

And Rebecca spoke to Isaac: I am weary of my life / for fear of the daughters
of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth / soch one as these are
/ or of the daughters of the land / what lust should I have to live.

THan Isaac called Jacob his son and blessed him / and charged him and said
unto him: se thou take not a wife of the daughters of Canaan / but arise and
get the to Mesopotamia to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father: and there
take the a wife of the daughters of Laban thy mothers brother. And God
allmightte bless the / increase the and multiply the that thou may be a
nombre of people / and geuethe the blessing of Abraham: both to the and to thy
seed with the that thou may possess the land (wherein thou art a strangere)
which God gave unto Abraham. Thus Isaac sent forth Jacob / to goo to
Mesopotamia unto Laban / son of Bethuel the Sirien / and brother to Rebecca
Jacobs and Esaus mother.

When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob / and sent him to Mesopotamia / to
fett him a wife thence / and that / as he blessed him he gave him a charge
saying: se thou take not a wife of the daughters of Canaan: and that Jacob had
obeyed his father and mother / and was gone unto Mesopotamia: and seeing also
that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father: Then went he unto
Ismael / and took unto the wives which he had / Mahala the daughter of Ismael
Abraham's son / the sister of Nabaioth to be his wife.

Jacob departed from Berseba and went toward Haran / and came unto a place and
tarried there all night / because the son was down. And took a stone of the
place / and put it under his head / and laid him down in the same place to
sleep. And he dreamed: and behold there stood a ladder upon the earth / and the
topp of it reached up to heaven. And se / the angels of God went up and down
upon it / ye and the Lord stood upon it and said.

I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac: The land which
thou slepest upon will I give the and thy seed. And thy seed shall be as the dust
of the earth: And thou shall spread abroad: west / east / north and south. And
through the and thy seed shall all the kynreddes of the earth be blessed. And se
I am with the / and wylbe thy keeper in all places whother thou ghost / and will
bring y^ again in to this land: Nether will I leave the until I have made
good / all that I have promised the.

When Jacob was awaked out of his sleep / he said: surely the Lord is in this
place / and I was not aware. And he was afraid and said how fearful is this
place? it is none other / but even the house of God and the gate of heaven. And
Jacob stood up early in the morning and took the stone that he had laid under
his head / and pitched it up an end and poured oil on the topp of it. And he
called the name of the place Bethell / for in deed the name of the city was
called Lus before time.

And Jacob vowed a vow saying: If God will be with me and will keep me in this
tourney which I goo and will give me bread to eat and cloothes to put on / so
that I come again unto my fathers house in saftie: then shall the Lord be my
God / and this stone which I have set up an end / shall be gods house / And of
all that thou shall give me / will I give the tenth unto the.

The.xxix. Chapter.
THen Jacob lift up his fete and went toward the east country. And as he looked
about / behold there was a well in the feld / and.iij. flocks of sheep lay
thereby (for at that well were the flocks watered) and there lay a great stone
at the well mouth And the manner was to bring the flocks thither / and to
roull the stone from the wells mouth and to water the sheep / and to put the
stone again upon the wells mouth unto his place.

And Jacob said unto the^: brethern / whence be ye? and they said: of Haran
ar we. And he said unto the^: know ye Laban the son of Nahor. And they
said: we know him. And he said unto the^: is he in good health? And they
said: he is in good health: and boholde / his daughter Rahel comes with y^
sheep. And he said: lo / it is yet a great while to night / nether is it time
yt the catell should be gathered together: water the sheep and goo and feed
the^. And they said: we may not / until all ye flocks be brought together
and the stone be roulled from the wells mouth / and so we water our sheep.

While he yet talked with the^ / Rahel came with her fathers sheep / for she
kept them. As soon As Jacob saw Rahel / the daughter of Laban his mothers
brother / and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother / he went and rolled the
stone from the wells mouth / and watered the sheep of Laba^ his mothers brother
And Jacob kyssed Rahel / and lift up his voice and wept: and told her also
yt he was her fathers brother and Rebeccas son. The^ Rahel ran and told
her father.

When Laban herd tell of Jacob his sisters son / he ran against him and
enbraced hi^ and kyssed him and brought him in to his house. And the^ Jacob
told Laba^ all y^ matter And the^ Laba^ said: well / thou art my bone and my
flesh, Abide with me the space of a month. And afterward Laban said unto
Jacob: though thou be my brother / should thou therefore serve me for naught?
tell me what shall thy wages be? And Laban had.ij. daughters / the eldest
called Lea and the youngest Rahel. Lea was tender eyed: But Rahel was bewtifull
and well favored. And Jacob loved her well / and said: I will serve the.vij.
year for Rahel thy youngest daughter. And Laban answered: it is better y^ I give
her the / than to another man? bide therefore with me.

And Jacob served.vij. years for Rahel / and they seemed unto him but a few
days? for the love he had to her. And Jacob said unto Laban / give me my wife
/ that I mayely e with her for the time appointed me is come.

Than Laban bade all the men of that place / and made a feast. And when eue^
was come / he took Lea his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto
her. And Laban gave unto his daughter Lea / Zilpha his maid / to be her
servant.

And when the morning was come / behold it was Lea. Than said he to Laban:
wherefore have thou played thus with me? did not I serve the for Rahel /
wherefore than have thou be gyled me? Laban answered: it is not the manner of
this place / to mar the youngest before the eldest. Pass out this weke / and
tha^ shall this also be geven the for y^ service which thou shall serve me
yet.vij. years more. And Jacob did eue^ so / and passed out that weke / and
than he gave hi^ Rahel his daughter to^ wife also. And Laban gave to Rahel his
daughter / Bilha his handmayde to be her servau^te. So lay he by Rahel also /
and loved Rahel more than Lea / and served him yet.vij. years more.

When the Lord saw that Lea was despised / he made her fruitful: but Rahel
was baren. And Lea conceived and bare a son / and called his name Rube^ / for
she said:: the Lord has looked upon my tribulation. And now my husbonde will
love me. And she conceived again and bare a son / and said: the Lord has
herd that I am despised / and has therefore given me this son also / and she
called him Simeon. And she conceived yet and bare a son / and said: now this
once will my husbonde keep me company / because I have borne him.iij. sons:
and therefore she called his name Levi. And she conceived yet again / and bare
a son saying? Now will I praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Juda
/ and left bearing.

The.xxx. Chapter
WHen Rahel saw that she bare Jacob no children / she envied her sister and
said unto Jacob: give me children / or else I am but deed. Than was Jacob
wrooth with Rahel saying: Am I in gods stead which keeps from the the fruit
of thy womb? The^ she said: here is my maid Bilha: go in unto her / that she
may bear upon my lap / that I may be increased by her. And she gave him
Bilha her hand maid to wife. And Jacob went in unto her / And Bilha conceived
and bare Jacob a son. Than said Rahel. God has given sentence on my side /
and has also herd my voice / and has given me a son. Therefore called she
him Dan. And Bilha Rahels maid co^ce^ued again and bare Jacob a another son.
And Rahel said. God is turned / and I have made a change with my sister / and
have gote^ y^ upper hand. And she called his name Nepthali

When Lea saw that she had left bearinge / she took Silpha her maid and gave
her ^acob to wiffe. And Silpha Leas made bare Jacob a son. Than said Lea:
good luck: and called his name God. And Silpha Leas maid bare Jacob another
son. Tha^ said Lea: happy am I / for the daughters will call me blessed. And
called his name Asser.

And Rube^ went out in the wheatharuest and found mandragoras in the feldes /
and brought the^ unto his mother Lea. Than said Rahel to Lea give me of thy
sons ma^dragoras. And Lea answered: is it not enough / yt thou have taken
away my housbo^de / but would take away my sons mandragoras also? Than
said Rahel well / let him sleep with the this night / for thy sons
mandragoras. And when Jacob came from the feldes at even / Lea went our to mere
him / and said: come into me / for I have bought the with my sons
mandragoras.

And he slepte with her that night. And God herd Lea / yt she conceived and
bare onto Jacob y^.v. son. Than said Lea. God has give me my reward /
because I gave my mayde^ to my housbo^d / and she called him Isachar. And Lea
conceived yet again and bare Jacob the sex^e son. Than said she: God has
endewed me with a good dowry. Now will my housbond dwell with me / because I
have borne him.vi. sons: and called his name Zabulo^. After that she bare a
daughter and called her Dina.

And God remembered Rahel / herd her / and made her fruitful: so that she
conceived and bare a son and said God has taken away my rebuke. And she
called his name Joseph saying The lord give me yet a another son.

As soon as Rahel had home Joseph / Jacob said to Laban: Se^de me away yt I
may goo unto mine own place and cu^tre / give me my wives and my children for
whom I have served the / and let me goo: for thou know what scruyce I have
done the. Than said Laban unto hi^: If I have fownde favor in thy syghte
(for I suppose yt the Lord has blessed me for thy sake) appoynte what thy
reward shall be / and I will give it y^. But he said unto him / thou know
what service I have done y^ / and in what tak^nge thy catell have been under
me: For it was but little that thou had before I came / and now it is
increased in to a multitude ^ and the LORD has blessed the for my sake. But
now when shall I make provysion for mine own house also? And he said: what
shall I give the? And Jacob answered: thou shall give me nothing at all / if
thou will do this one thing for me: And then will I turn again and feed thy
sheep and keep them.

I will go about all thy sheep this day / and separate from the^ all the
sheep that are spotted and of dyverse colors / and all black sheep among
the lambs and the party and spotted among the kyddes: And then such shall be
my reward. So shall my rightwesnes answer for me: when the time comes that
I shall receive my reward of the: Go that what soever is not speckeld and
party among the gootes and black among the lambs / let that be theft with
me.

Than said Laban: ^oo / I am conte^te / that it be acordinge as thou have
said. And he took out that same day the he gootes that were party and of
diverse colors / and all the she gootes that were spotted and party colored
/ and all that had white in the^ / and all the black among the lambs: and
put the^ in the kepinge of his sons / and set three days ourney ^betwixte
himself and Jacob. And so Jacob kept yye rest of Laba^s sheep.

Jacob took rods of grene popular / hasell / and of chestnottrees / and
pilled white strakes in the^ and made the white apere in the staves: And he put
the staves which he had pilled / eue^ before yy^ sheep / in the gutters and
watrynge ^roughes / when the sheep came to drink: yt they should conceive when
they came to drink. And the sheep conceived before the staves and brought
forth straked / spotted and party. The^ Jacob parted the la^bes / and turned
the faces of the sheep toward spotted things / and toward allinaner of black
things through out the flocks of Laba^. And he made him flocks of his own by
the^ self / which he put not unto the flocks of Laba^. And allwaye in the
first buckinge time of the sheep / Jacob put the staves before the sheep in the
gutters* / y^ they might conceive before the staves / But in the latter
buckynge time / he put them not there: so the last hrode was Laba^s and the
first Jacobs. And the man became exceeding rich and had many sheep /
maydeseruauntes / menseruauntes / camels and asses.

The.xxxi. Chapter.
ANd Jacob herd the words of Laba^s sons how they said: Jacob has taken
away all that was our fathers / and of our fathers goods / has he gote^
all this honor. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban / that it was not
toward him as it was in times past.

And the Lord said unto Jacob: turn again in to the land of thy fathers
and to thy kynred / and I will be with ye. Tha^ Jacob sent and called Rahel and
Lea to the field unto his sheep / and said unto the^: Ise your fathers
countenance yt it is not toward me as in times past. Morouer y^ God of my
father has been with me. And ye know how that I have served your father with
all my might. And your father has disceaued me and changed my wages.x.
times: But God suffered him not to hurt me. When he said the spotted shall be
thy wages / tha^ all the sheep bare spotted. If he said the straked shall be the
reward / tha^ bare all the sheep straked: thus has God: ake^ away your
fathers catell and given the^ me. For in buckynge time / I lifted up mine eyes
and saw in a dream: and behold / the rams that bucked the sheep were
straked / spotted and party. And the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream
saying: Jacob. And I answered: here am I. And he said: lift up thine eyes and
see / how all the ^a^mes that leap upon the sheep are straked / spotted and
party: for I have seen all that Laban does unto y^. I am y^ god of Bethell
where thou anoynteddest the stone and where thou vowdest a vow unto me. Now
arise and get the out of this country / and return unto the land / where
thou wast borne. Than answered Rahel and Lea and said unto him: we have no
part nor enheritaunce in our fathers house he cownteth us eue^ as strangers
/ for he has sold us / and has even eaten up the price of us. Moreover all
the riches which God has take from our father / that is ours and our
childerns. Now therefore what so ever God has said unto the / that do. Tha^
Jacob rose up and set his sons and wives up upon camels / and carried away
all his catell and all his substance which he had got in Mesopotamia / for to
goo to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan. Laba^ was gone to shere his
sheep / and Rahel had stolle^ her fathers images. And Jacob went away
unknowing to Laban the Sirie^ / and told him not yt he fled. So fled he and
all yt he had / and made him self ready / and passed over the ryuers / and set
his face straight toward the mount Gilead.

Apo^ the third day after / was it told Laba^ y^ Jacob was fled. Tha^ he took
his brethren with him and followed after him.vij. days journey and over took
him at the mount Gilead. And God came to Laba^ the Siria^ in a dream by
night / and said unto him: take heed to thy self / that thou speak not to
Jacob ought save good. And Laba^ over took Jacob: and Jacob had pitched his
te^te in yt mount. And Laban with his brethern pitched their te^te also upon
the mount Gilead. Than said Laba^ to Jacob: why have thou this done
unknowing to me / and have carried away my daughters as though they had been
taken captyue with sword? Wherefore wentest thou away secretly unknown to me
and did not tell me / y^ I might have brought y^ on the way with mirth /
singing / tymrells and harppes / and have not suffered me to kiss my childern
and my daughters. Thou wast a fool to do it / for I am able to do you evell.
But the God of your father spoke unto me yesterdaye saying take heed tha thou
speak not to Jacob ought save good. And now though thou we^test thy way
because thou lo^gest after thy fathers house / yet wherefore have thou stolen
my gods?

Jacob answered and said to Laba^: because I was afraid / and thought that
thou would have taken away thy daughters fro me. But with whom soever thou
fyndest thy gods / let him dye here before our brethren. Seek that thine is
by me / and take it to the: for Jacob wist not that Rahel had stolle^ the^.
Tha^ went Laba^ in to Jacobs te^te / and in to Leas te^te / and in to.ij.
maidens tents: but fownde the^ not. Tha^ went he out of Leas te^te / and
entered in to Rahels te^te. And Rahel ^oke the images / and put them in the
camels straw and sat down apo^ the^. And Laba^ serched all the te^te: but
fownde the^ not. Tha^ said she to her father: my lord / be not angrye yt Ica^
not rise up before the / for the disease of weme^ is come upon me. So searched
be / but found the^ not.

Jacob was wrooth and chode with Laba^: Jacob also answered and said to him:
what have I tre^^aced or what have I offended / that thou foloweddest after me?
Thou have searched all my stuff / and what have thou found of all thy
household stuff? put it here before thy brethern and mine / and let the^ judge
betwyxte us both. This xx. year y^ I have been with the / thy sheep and thy
^^oores have not been baren / and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
What soever was torn of beasts I brought it not unto y^ / but made it good
mysilf: of my hand dydest thou require it / whether it was stolen by day or
night Moreover by day the hete consumed me / and the cold by night / and my
sleep departed fro mine eyes.

Thus have I been.xx. year in thy house / and served the.xiiij. years for
thy.ij. daughters / and vi. year for thy sheep / and thou have changed my
reward.x. times. And except the God of my father / the God of Abraham and the
God who me Isaac fears / had been with me: surely thou had sent me away
now all empty. But God beheld my tribulation / and the labor of my hands:
and rebuked the yester day.

Laban answered and said unto Jacob: the daughters are my daughters / and the
childern or my childern / and the sheep are my sheep / and all that thou seist
is mine. And what can I do this day unto these my daughters / or unto their
childern which they have borne? Now therefore come on / let us make a bond / I
and thou together / and let it be a witness between the and me. Than took
Jacob a stone and set it up an end / and said unto his brethern / gather
stoones And they took stoones and made an heap / and they ate there / upon the
heap. And Laba^ called ^ ^egar Sahadutha / but Jacob called it Gylead.

Than said Laban: this heap ^e witness between the and me this day
(therefore is it called Gilead) and this ^o^e^ill which the lord sees (said
he) be witness between me and the when we are departed one from another: that
thou shall not vex my daughters nether shall take other wyves unto them. Here
is no man with us: behold / God is witness betwixt the and me. And Laban
said moreover to Jacob: behold / this heap and this mark which I have set
here / betwyxte me and the: this heap be witness and also this marcke / that
I will not come over this heap to the / and thou shall not come over this
heap and this mark / to do any harm. The God of Abraham / the God of Nahor
and the God of their fathers / be judge betwixt us.

And Jacob swear by him that his father Isaac feared. Then Jacob did sacrifyce
upon the mount / and called his brethern to eat breed. And they are breed and
tarried all night in the hill. And early in the morning Laban rose up and
kyssed his childern and his daughters / and blessed the^ and departed and went
unto his place again. But Jacob went forth on his journey. And the angels of
God came and met him. And when Jacob law them / he said: this is gods
host: and called the name of that same place / Mahanaim.

The.xxxij. Chapter.
Jacob sent meessengers before him to Esau his brother / unto the land of
Seir and the field of Edom. And he commanded them saying: se that ye speak
after this manner to my lord Esau: thy servant Jacob says thus. I have
sogerned and been a stranger with Laban unto this time: and have gotten oxen /
asses and sheep / menservauntes and we manseruauntes / and have sent to show
it un lord / that I may find grace in thy syghte.

And the messengers came again to Jacob sainge: we came unto thy brother Esau
/ and he comes against the and.iiij. hundred men with hi^. Than was Jacob
greatly afraid / and wist not which way to turn him self / and devyded the
people that was with him and the sheep / oxen and camels / in to.ij. companies
/ and sayder If Esau come to the one part and smite it / the other may save it
self.

Prayer is to cleave unto the promyses of god with a siro^ge faith and to
beseech god with a fervent desire that he will fulfill them for his mercy and
truth only. As Jacob here does.
And Jacob said: O god of my father Abraham / and God of my father Isaac:
Lord which saydest unto me / return unto thy cuntre and to thy kynrede / and
I will deall well with the. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercyes and
treuth which thou have showed unto thy servant. For with my staf came I over
this Iordane / and now have I gotten.ij. droves Delyver me from the hands of my
brother Esau / for I fear him: lest he will come and smite the mother with the
childern. Thou saydest that thou would surely do me good / and would make
^^ seed as the sonde of the sea which can not be nombred for multitude.

And he tarried there that same night / and took of that which came to hand /
a preasent / unto Esau his brother: ij hundred she gootes and xx he gootes: ij
hundred sheep and xx rams: thyrtye mylch camels with their coltes: xl kyne
and x bulls: xx she asses and x foles and delivered them unto his servants /
every drooue by them selves / and said unto them: goo forth before me and put
a space betwyxte every drooue. And he commanded the formestsaynge

When Esau my brother meteth the and axeth the saying: whose seruau^te art thou
and whither ghost thou / and whose ar these that goo before ye: thou shall say
/ they be thy servant Jacobs / and are a present sent unto my lord Esau /
and behold / he him self comes after us. And so commanded he the second /
and even so the third / and likewise all that followed the drooues sainge / of
this manner se that ye speak unto Esau when ye mete him / and say more over.
Behold thy servant Jacob comes after us / for he said. I will pease his
wrath with the present y^ goth before me and afterward I will see him myself /
so per^dventure he will receive me to grace.

So went the present before him and he tarried all that night in the tente /
and rose up the same night and took his.ij. wyves and his.ij. maidens and his.
x^. sons / and went over the foorde Iabok. And he took them and sent the^
over the river / and sent over that he had and tarried behind him self alone.

And there wrasiled a man with him unto the breaking of the day. And when he
saw that he could not prevayle against him / he smote hi^ under the thye / and
the senowe of Jacobs thy shranke as he wrastled with him. And he said: let me
goo / for the day breaks. And he said: I will not let the goo / except
thou bless me. And he said unto him: what is thy name? He answered: Jacob.
And he said: thou shall be called Jacob no more / but Israel. For thou have
wrastled with God and with men and have prevailed.

And Jacob asked him sainge / tell me thy name. And he said / wherefore do
thou ask after my name? and he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of
the place Peniel / for I have seen God face to face / and yet is my life
reserved. And as he went over Peniel / the son rose upon him / and he halted
upon his thye: wherefore the childern of Israel ^a^e not of the senow that
shrancke under the thye / unto this day: because that he smote Jacob under the
thye in the senow that sh^oncke.

The.xxxiij. Chapter.
Jacob lift up his eyes and saw his brother Esau come / and with him.iiij.
hundred men. And he divided the childern unto Lea and unto Rahel and unto ye
ij. maidens. And he put the maidens and their childern formest / and Lea and
her childern after / and Rahel and Joseph hindermost. And he went before them
and fell on the grownde* ^ij* times / until he came unto his brother.

Esau ran against him and enbraced him and fell on his neck and kyssed him /
and they wept. And he lift up his eyes and saw the wyves and their childern
/ and said: what are these which thou there have? And he said: they are the
childern which God has given thy servant. Than came the maidens forth / and
did their obaysaunce. Lea also and her childern came and did their obaysaunce.
And last of all came Joseph and Rahel and did their obaysaunce.

And he said: what meanyst thou with all y^ drooues which I met. And he
answered: to find grace in the syghte of my lord. And Esau said: I have
enough my brother / keep that thou have unto thy silf. Jacob answered: oh nay
but if I have found grace in thy syghte / receive my prease^t of my hand: for
I have seen thy face as though I had seen yt face of God: wherefore receive me
to grace and take my blessing that I have brought the / for God has given it
me freely. And I have enough of all things. And so he compelled him to take it.

And he said: let us take our journey and goo / and I will goo in thy
company. And he said unto him: my lord knows that I have tender childern /
ewes and kyne with young under mine hand / which if men should ouerdry^^ but
even one day / the hole flock would dye. Let my lord therefore goo before his
servaunte and I will drive fair and softly / according as the catell that
goth before me and the childern / be able to endure: until I come to ^^ lord
unto Seir.

And Esau said: let me yet leave some of my folk with the. And he said: what
neadeth it? let me find grace in the syghte of my lord So Esau went his way
again yt same day unto Seir. And Jacob took his journey toward Sucoth / and
bylt him an house / and made boothes for his catell: whereof the name of the
place is called Sucoth.

And Jacob went to Salem to y^ city of Si them in the land of Canaa^ / after
that he was come from Mesopotamia / and pitched before the cite / and bought a
parcel of ground where he ^ttched his tent / of the childern of Hemor Sichems
father / for an hundred lambs. And he made there an altar / and there called
upon the myghtie God of Israel.

The.xxxiiij. Chapter.
DIna the daughter of Lea which she bare unto Jacob / went out to see the
daughters of the land. And Eiche^ the son of Hemo: the Heuite lord of the
country / saw her / and took her / and lay with her / and forced her: and his
heart lay unto Dina y^ daughter of Jacob. And he loved yt damsel and spoke
kidly unto her / and spoke unto his father Hemo^ saying / get me this mayde^
unto my wife.

And Jacob herd that he had defiled Dina his daughter / but his sons were
with the catell in the field / and therefore he held his peace / until they
were come. Then Hemor the father of Sichem went out unto Jacob / to come^ with
him. And the sons of Jacob came out of the field as soon as they herd it /
for it grieved them / and they were not a little wrooth / because he had wrought
folly in Israel / in that he had lain with Jacobs daughter / which thing
ought not to be done.

And Hemor comened with the^ sainge? the soul of my son Siche^ lo^geth for
your daughter give her him to wife / and make marriages with us: give your
daughters unto us / and take our daughters unto you / and dwell with us / and
the land shall be at your pleasure / dwell and do your busynes / and have
your possessions there in. And Sichem said unto her father and her brethern:
let me find grace in your eyes / and what soever ye apoynte me / that will I
give. Axe freely of me both the dowry and gifts / and I will give acordynge as
ye say unto me / and give me the damsel to wife.

Then the sons of Jacob answered to Sichem and Hemor his father deceytefully
/ because he had defiled Dina their sister. And they said unto them / we can
not do this thing / yt we should give our sister to one that is vncircumcysed
/ for that were a shame unto us. Only in this will we consent unto you? If ye
will be as we be / that all the men childern among you be circumcysed / tha^
will we give our daughter to you and take youres to us / and will dwell with
you and be one people. But and if ye will not harken unto us to be circumcysed
/ than will we take our daughter and goo our ways.

And their words pleased Hemor and Sichem his son. And the young man deferde
not for to do the thing / because he had a lust to Jacobs daughter: he was
also most set by of all that were in his fathers house. Tha^ Hemor and Sichem
went unto the gate of their cite / and comened with the men of their cite
saying. These men ar peasable with us / and will dwell in the land and do
their occupatio^ therein And in the land is rowme enough for the^ / let us take
their daughters to wives and give them ours: only herm will they consent unto
us for to dwell with us and to be one people: if all the men childern that are
among us be circumcysed as they are. Their goods and their substance and all
their catell are ours / only let us consent unto them / that they may dwell
with us.

And unto Hemor and Sichem his sonneharkened all that went out at the gate of
his cite. And all the men childern were circumcysed what soever went out at the
gates of his cite. And the third day when it was paynefull to them / ij. of
the sons of Jacob Simeon and Leui Dinas brethren / took either of them his
sword and went in to the cite boldly / and slew all yt was male / and slew
also H^m^^ and Sichem his son with the edge of the sword / and took Dina
their sister out of Sichems house / and went their way.

Than came the sons of Jacob upon the deed / and spoiled the cite / because
they had defiled their sister: and took their sheep / oxen asses and what so
ever was in the cite and also in ye feldes. And all their goods / all their
childern and their wives took they captyue / and made ha^ock of all that was in
the houses.

And Jacob said to Simeon and Leui: ye have troubled me and made me styncke
unto the inhabitatours of the land / both to the Can^anytes and also unto the
Pherezites. And I am few in nombre. Wherefore they shall gather them selves
together against me and ^ley me / and so shall I and my house be dystroyed. And
they answered: should they deall with our sister a^ with an whore?

The.xxxv. Chapter
ANd God said unto Jacob / arise and get the up to Bethell / and dwell there.
And make there an altar unto God that apeared unto the / when thou fleddest
from Esau thy brother. Than said Jacob unto hi^ household and to all yt were
with him / put away the strange gods that are among you and make your
selves clean / and change your garments / and let us arise and goo up to
Bethell / yt I may make an altar there / unto God which herd me in the day
of my tribulation and was with me in the way which I went.

And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were under their hands
/ and all their carynges which were in their ears / and Jacob hyd them under
an ooke at Sichem. And they departed* And the fear of God fell upon the cities
that were round about them / that they durst not follow after the sons of
Jacob. ^o came Jacob to Lus in the land of Canaan / otherwise called Bethell /
with all the people that was with him. And he builded there an ^ulter / and
called the place Elbethell: because that God appeared unto him there / when he
fled from his brother.

Then dyed Debor^ Rebeccas norse / and was buried ben^^he Bethell under an
ooke. And the name of it was called the ooke of lamentation.

And God appeared unto Jacob again after he came out of Mesopotamia / and
blessed him and said unto him: thy name is Jacob. Notwithstondynge thou shall
be no more called Jacob / but Israel shall be thy name. And so was his name called
Israel.

And God said unto him: I am God almighty / grow and multiplye: for people
and a multitude of people shall spring of the / ye and kings shall come out
of they loins. And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac / will I give unto
the / and unto thy seed after the will I give it also. And god departed from
him in the place where he talked with him. And Jacob set up a mark in the
place where he talked with him: even a pilloure of stone / and powered
drynkeoffringe thereon and powered also oil thereon / and called the name of the
place where God spoke with him / Bethell.

And they departed from Bethel / and when he was but a feld bread from Ephrath
/ Rahel began to travel. And in travelynge she was in perell. And as she was
in pains of her labor / the mydwyfe said unto her: fear not / for thou
shall have this son also. Then as her soul was a departinge / that she must
dye: she called his name Ben O^i. But his father called him Ben Iamin. And thus
dyed Rahel and was buried in the way to Ephrath which now is called Bethlehem.
And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave / which is called Rahels grave pillar
unto this day. And Israel went thence and pitched up his tent beyond the
toure of Eder.

And it chanced as Israel dwelt in that land / that Ruben went and lay with
Bilha his fathers concubyne / and it came to Isreal's ear. The sons of Jacob
were.xij. in nombre. The sons of Lea. Ruben Jacobs eldest son / and Simeo^
/ Leui / Judah / Isacha^ / and Zabulon The sons of Rahel: Joseph and Ben
Iamin. The sons of Bilha Rahels maid: Dan and Nepthali. The sons of Zilpha
Leas maid Gad and Aser. These are the sons of Jacob which were borne him in
Mesopotamia.

Then Jacob went unto Isaac his father to Mamre a pri^cipall cite / otherwise
called Hebron: where Abraham and Isaac sogeorned as strangers. And the days
of Isaac were an hundred and.lxxx. years: and than fell he seek and dyed / and
was put unto his people: being old and full of days. And his sons Esau and
Jacob buried him.

The.xxxvij. Chapter.
ANd Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger / yt is to
say in the land of Canaan. And these are the generations of Jacob: when
Joseph was. x^ij. year old / he kept sheep with his brethren / and the lad
was with the sons of Bilha and of Zilpha his fathers wives. And he brought
unto their father an evil saying yt was of them. And Israel loved Joseph more
than all his childern / because he begat him in his old age / and he made him
a coote of many colors.

When his brothren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethern
/ they hated him and could not speak one kind word unto him. Moreover Joseph
dreamed a dreawe and told it his brethren: wherefore they hated him yet the
more. And he said unto them hear I pray you this dream which I have
dreamed: Behold we were making she^^s in the fold: and loo / my shefe arose
and stood up right / and youres stood round about and made obeysaunce to my
shefe. Than said his brethren unto him: what / shall thou be our king or
shall thou reign over us? And they hated hi^ yet the in ore / because of his
dream and of his words.

And he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren saying: behold / I
have had one dream more: me thought the son and the moon and.xi. stars
made obaysaunce to me. And when he had told it unto his father and his brethern
/ his father rebuked him and said unto him: what means this dream which
thou have dreamed: shall I and thy mother and thy brethren come and fall on the
ground before the? And his brethern hated him / but his father noted the
saying.

His brethren went to keep their fathers sheep in Sichem / and Israel said
unto Joseph: do not thy brethern keep in Sichem? come that I may send y^ to
the^. And he answered here am I And he said unto him: goo and see whether it
be well with thy brethren and the sheep / and bring me word again: And sent
him out of the vale of Hebron / for to go to Sichem.

And a certain man found him wandrynge out of his way in the field / and
axed him what he sought. And he answered: I seek my brethren / tell me I pray
the where they keep sheep And the man said / they are departed hence / for I
herd them say / let us goo unto Dothan. Thus went Joseph after his brethren /
and found them in Dothan.

And when they saw him a far of before he came at them / they took council
against him / for to sley him / and said one to another / Behold this dreamer
comes / come now and let us sley him and cast him in to some pytt / and let us
say that some wiked beast has devoured him / and let us see what his dreams
will come to.

When Ruben herd that / he went about to ryd him out of their hands and
said / let us not kill him. And Ruben said moreover unto them / shed not his
blood / but cast him in to this pytt that is in the wilderness / and lay no
hands upon him: for he would have rydd him out of their hands and delivered
him to his father again.

And as soon as Joseph was come unto his brethren / they strypte him out of
his gay coote that was upon him / and they took him and cast him in to a pytt:
But the pytt was empty and had no water therein. And they s^tt them down to
eat bread. And as they lift up their eyes and looked about / there came a
company of Ismaelites from Gilead / and their camels lade^ with spicery /
baulme / and my^re / and were going down in to Egipte.

Than said Judah to his brethren / what avayleth it that we sley our brother /
and keep his blood secrett? come on / let us sell him to the Ismaelites / and
let not our hands be defiled upon him: for he is our brother and our flesh.
And his brethren were content. Than as the Mad^anites merchant men passed by /
they drew Joseph out of the pytt and sold him unto the Ismaelites for.xx.
pieces of silver. And they brought him into Egipte.

And when Ruben came again unto the pytt and found not Joseph there / he rent
his cloothes and went again unto his brethern saying: the lad is not yonder /
and whether shall I goo? And they took Joseph's coote and killed a goote / and
dypped the coote in the blood. And they sent that gay coote and caused it to be
brought unto their father and said: This have we found: se / whether it be thy
sons coote or no. And he knew it saying: it is my sons coote a wicked
beast has devoured him / and Joseph is rent in pieces. And Jacob rent his
cloothes / and put sack clothe about his loins / and sorowed for his son a
long season.

Than came all his sons and all his daughters to comfort him. And he would
not be comforted / but said: I will go down in to y^ grave unto my son /
morning. And thus his father wept for him. And the Madianytes sold him in
Egipte unto Putip^ar a lord of Pharaos: and his chief marshall.

The.xxxviij. Chapter.
ANd it fortuned at that time that Judas went from his brethren and gatt him to
a man called Hira of Odollam / and there he saw the daughter of a man called
Sua a Canaanyte. And he took her and went in unto her. And she conceived and
bare a son and called his name E^. And she conceived again and bare a son
and called him Onan. And she conceived the third time and bare a son / whom
she called Sela: and he was at Chesyb when she bare hem.

And Judas gave E^ his eldest son / a wife whose name was Thamar. But this E^
Judas eldest son was wicked in the syghte of the Lord / wherefore the Lord
slew him. Than said Judas unto Onan: goo in to thy brothers wife and Marie
her / and stir up seed unto thy brother. And when Onan perceived that the
seed should not be his: therefore when he went in to his brothers wife / he
spylled it on the ground / because he would not give seed unto his brother. And
the thing which he did / displeased the Lord / wherefore he slew him also.
Than said Judas to Thamar his daughter in law: remain a wydow at thy fathers
house / till Sela my son be grown: for he feared lest he should have dyed
also / as his brethren did. Thus went Thamar and dwelt in her fathers house.

And in process of time / the daughter of Sua Judas wife dyed. Than Judas when
he had left morning / went unto his sheep sherers to Thimnath with his friend
Hira of Odollam. And one told Thamar saying: behold / thy father in law goth
vpto Thimnath / to shere his sheep. And she put her wydows garments of from
her and covered her with a clooke / and disgyssed herself: And sat her down at
the entering of Enaim which is by the hye ways side to Thimnath / for because
she saw that Sela was grown / and she was not given unto him to wife.

When Judah saw her / he thought it had been an hoore / because she had covered
her face. And turned to her unto the way and said / come I pray the / let me
lie with the / for he knew not that it was his daughter in law. And she said
what wylt thou give me / for to lie with me? Tha^ said he / I will send the a
kydd from the flock. She answered / Than give me a pledge till thou send it.
Than said he / what pledge shall I give the? And she said: thy sygnett / thy
neck lace / and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave it her and lay by
her / and she was with child by him. And she gatt her up and went and put her
mantell from her / and put on her widows raiment again.

And Judas sent the kydd by his neybure of O^ollam / for to fetch out his
pledge again from the wifes hand. But he fownde her not. Than asked he the
men of the same place saying: where is the whore that satt at Enaim in the
way? And they said: there was no whore here. And he came to Judah again
saying: I can not find her / and also the men of the place said: that there
was no whore there. And Judah said: let her take it to her / lest we be
shamed: for I sent the kydd and thou coudest not find her.

And it came to pass that after.iij. moan* these / one told Judah saying:
Thamar thy daughter in law has played the whore / and with playnge the
whore is become great with child. And Judah said: bring her forth and let
her be burnt. And when they brought her forth / she sent to her father in law
saying: by the man unto whom these things pertayne / am I with child. And
said also: look whose are this seall necklace / and staff. And Judah knew them
saying: she is more rightwes tha^ I / because I gave her not to Sela my son.
But he lay with her no more.

When time was come that she should be delivered / behold there was.ij.
twynnes in her womb. And as she traveled / the one put out his hand and the
mydwife took and bownde a reed threde about it saying: this will come out
first. But he plucked his hand back again / and his brother came out. And
she said: wherefore have thou rent a rent upon the? and called him Pharez. And
afterward came out his brother that had the read threde about his hand /
which was / called Zarah.

The.xxxix. Chapter.
Joseph was brought unto Egipte / and Pu^iphar a lord of Pharaos: and his
chief marshall an Egiptian / bought him of y^ Ismaelites which brought hi^
thither And the Lord was with Joseph / and he was a luckie fellow and
continued in the house of his master the Egiptian. And his master saw that the
ORde was with him and that the Lord made all that he did prosper in his hand:
Wherefore he found grace in his masters syghte / and served him. And his master
made him ruelar of his house / and put all that he had in his hand. And as
soon as he had made him ruelar over his house and over all that he had / the
Lord blessed this Egiptians house for Joseph's sake / and the blessing of the
Lord was upon all that he had: both in the house and also in the feldes. And
therefore he left all that he had in Joseph's hand / and looked upon nothing
that was with him / save only on the bread which he ate. And Joseph was a
goodly person and a well favored

And it fortuned after this / that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph
and said come lie with me. But he denied and said to her: Behold / my master
woteth not what he has in the house with me / but has committed all that he
has to my hand He him self is not greatter in the house than I / and has
kept nothi^ge from me / but only the because thou art his wife. How than ca^ I
do this great wykydnes / for to sin against God? And after this manner spoke
she to Joseph day by day: but he harkened not unto her / to sleep nere her or
to be in her company.

And it fortuned about the same season / that Joseph entered in to the house /
to do his busynes: and there was none of the household by / in the house. And
she caught him by the garment saying: come sleep with me. And he left his
garment in her hand and fled and got him out When she saw that he had left
his garment in her hand / and was fled out / she called unto the men of the
house / and told them saying: Se / he has brought in an Hebrewe unto us to do
us shame. for he came in to me / for to have slept with me. But I cried with a
loud voice. And when he hard / that I lift up my voice and cried / he left
his garment with me and fled away and got him out.

And she laid up his garment by her / until her lord came home. And she told
him acordynge to these words saying. This Hebrews servaunte which thou have
brought unto us came in to me to do me shame. But as soon as I lift up my
voice and cried / he left his garment with me and fled out. When his master
herd the words of his wife which she told him saying: after this manner did
thy servaunte to me / he waxed wrooth.

And he took Joseph and put him in prison: even in the place where the kings
prisoners lay bound. And there continued he in preson. But the Lord was with
Joseph and showed him mercy / and got him favor in the ^yghte of the keeper
of ye preson which com^ mytted to Ioseph^ hand all the presoners that were in
the preson housse. And what soever was done there / yt did he. And the keeper of
the preso^ looked unto nothing that was under his hand / because the Lord was
with him / and because that what soever he did / the Lord made it come luc^ely
to pass.

The xl. Capter.
ANd it chanced after this / that the chief butlar of the king of Egipte and
his chief baker had offended there lord the king of Egypt. And Ph^rao was
angry with them and put the^ in ward in his chief marshals house: even in y^
pre son where Joseph was bownd. And the chief marshall gave Joseph a charge
with them / and he served them. And they contynuaed a season in ward.

And they dreamed either of them in one night: both the butlar and the baker of
the king of Egipte which were bownde in the preson house / either of them his
dream / and each man's dream of a sondrie interpretation When Joseph came in
unto them in the morning / and looked upon them: behold / they were sadd. And
he asked them saying / wherefore look ye so sadly to day? They answered him /
we have dreamed a dream / and have no man to declare it. And Joseph said unto
the^. Interpretynge belongs to God but tell me yet.

And the chief butlar told his dream to Joseph and said unto him. In my
dream me thought there stood a vine before me^ / and in the vine were.lij.
branches / and it was as though it budded / and her blosso^s shottforth: and
y^ grapes there of waxed ripe. And I had Pharaos cup in my hand / and took
of the grapes and wrong them in to Pharaos cup / and delyvered Pharaos cup
into his hand.

And Joseph said unto him / this is the interpe^tation of it. The.iij.
branches ar thr^ days: for within three days shall Pharao lift up thine head
/ and restore the unto* thine office again / and thou shall deliver Pharaos
cup in to his hand / after the old manner / even as thou dydest when thou
wast his butlar. But think on me with the / when thou art in good case / and
show mercy unto me. And make mention of me to Pharao / and help to bring me
out of this house: for I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews / and here
also have I do ne nothi^ge at all wherefore they should have put me in to this
dongeon.

When the chief baker saw that he had well interpretate it / he said unto
Joseph / me thought also in my dream / y^ I had.iij. wyker baskettes on my
head: And in y^ uppermost basket / of all manner bakemeates for Pharao. And the
birds ate them out of the basket upon my head

Joseph answered and said: this is the interpretation thereof. The.iij.
baskettes are.iij. days / for this day.iij. days shall Pharao take thy head
from the / and shall hang the on a tree / and the birds shall eat thy flesh
from of the.

And it came to pass the third day which was Pharaos birth day / that he
made a feast unto all his servauntes. And he lyfted up the head of the chief
buttelar and of the chief baker among his servauntes. And restored the chief
buttelar unto his buttelarshipe again / and he reched the cup in to Pharaos
hand / a^o hanged the chief baker: eue^ as Joseph had interpretated unto the^.
Notwithstonding the chief buttelar remembered not Joseph / but forgot him.

The.xli. Capter.
ANd it fortuned at.ij. years end / that Ph^rao dreamed / and thought that he
stood by a ryuers side / and that there came out of the ryver.vij. goodly kyne
and fatt fleshed / and fedd in a medowe. And him though that.vij. other kyne
came up after them out of the ryver evelfauored and lean fleshed and stood by
the other upon the brynke of the river. And the evil favored and lenefleshed
kyne ate up the.vij. welfauored and fatt kyne: and ^e awoke their with.

And he slepte again and dreamed the second time / that.vij. ears of corn
grew upon one stalk rank and goodly. And that.vij. thynne ears blasted
with the wind / spronge up after them: and that the.vij. thynne ears
deuowrerd the.vij. rank and full ears. And than Pharao awaked: and se / here
is his dream. When the morning came / his sprete was troubled And he sent and
called for all the soythsayers of Egypt and all the wise men there of / and
told them his dream: but there was none of them that could interpretate it
unto Pharao.

Than spoke the chief buttelar unto Pharao saying. I do remember my fawte this
day. Pharao was angry with his servauntes / and put in ward in the chief
marshals house both me and the chief baker. And we dreamed both of us in one
night and each man's dream of a sondrye interpretation.

And there was with us a young man / an Hebrew borne / servaunte unto the chief
marshall. And we told him / and he declared our dreams to us acordynge to
either of our dreams. And as he declared them unto us / even so it came to
pass. I was restored to mine office again / and he was hanged.

Than Pharao sent and called Joseph. And they made him haste out of preson. And
he shaued himself and changed his raiment / and went in to Pharao. And Pharao
said unto Joseph: I have dreamed a dream and no man ca^ interpretate it / but
I have herd say of the y^ as soon as thou hear a dream / thou do
interpretate it. And Joseph answered Pharao saying: God shall give Pharao an
answer of peace without me.

Pharao said unto Joseph: in my dream me thought I stood by a ryvers side /
and there came out of the ryver vij fatt fleshed and well favored kyne / and
fedd in the medowe. And then.vij. other kyne came up after them / poor and
very evil favored and lean fleshed: so that I never saw their like in all
the land of Egipte in evil fauordnesse. And the.vij. lean and evil favored
kyne ate up the first.vij. fatt kyne And when they had eaten them up / a man
cowde not perceive that they had eaten them: for they were still as evyll
favored as they were at the beginning. And I awoke.

And I saw again in my dream.vij. ears spring out of one stalk full and
good / and.vij. other ears wytherd / thin and blasted with wind / spring
up after them. And the thynne ears deuowred the.vij. good ears. And I have
told it unto the sothsayers / but no man can tell me what it means.

Then Joseph said unto Pharao: both Pharaos dreams are one. And god does
show Pharao what he is about to do. The vij. good kyne are. vij years: and
the.vij. good ears are.vij. year also / and is but one dream. Likewise /
the.vij. thynne and evil favored kyne that came out after them / are.vij.
years: and the.vij. empty and blasted ears shall be vij. years of hunger.
This is that which I said unto Pharao / that God does show Pharao what he is
about to do.

Behold there shall come.vij. year of great plenteousnes through out all the
land of Egypt. And there shall arise after them vij. years of hunger. So that
all the plenteousnes shall be forgeten in the land of Egipte. And the hunger
shall consume the land: so that the plenteousnes shall not be once asene in
the land by reason of that hunger that shall come after / for it shall be
exceading great And as concerning that the dream was dubled unto Pharao the
second time / it be^okeneth that the thing is certanly prepared of God / and
that God will shortly bring it to pass.

Now therefore let Pharao provyde for a man of understanding and wisdom / and
set him over the land of Egipte. And let Pharao make officers over the land
/ and take up the fyfte part of the land of Egipte in the vij. plenteous years
and let them gather all the food of these good years that come / and lay up
corn under the power of Pharo: that there may be food in the cities / and
there let them kept it: that there may be food in stoore in the land /
against the.vij. years of hunger which shall come in the land of Egipte / and
that the land perish not through hunger.

And the saying pleased Pharao and all his servants. Than said Pharao unto
his seruavauntes: where shall we find sch a man as this is / that has the
sprete of God in him? wherefore Pharao said unto Joseph: for as much as God
has showed the all this / there is no man of understanding nor of wisdom like
unto the Thou therefore shall be over my house / and acordinge to thy word
shall all my people obey: only in the kings seat will I be above the. And he
said unto Joseph: behold / I have set the over all the land of Egipte. And
he took off his ring from his fyngre / and put it upon Joseph's fingre / and
arrayed him in rayme^t of bisse / and put a golden cheyne about his neck and
set him upon the best charett that he had save one. And they cried before him
Abrech / and that Pharao had made him ruelar over all the land of Egipte.

And Pharao said unto Joseph: I am Pharao / without thy will / shall no man
lift up other his hand or foot in all the land of Egipte. And he called
Joseph's name Zaphnath Paenea. And he gave him to wife Asnath the daughter of
Potiphara preast of On. Than went Joseph abroad in the land of Egipte. And he
was.xxx. year old when he stood before Pharao king of Egipte. And than Joseph
departed from Pharao / and went through out all the land of Egipte.

And in the.vij. ple^teous years they made sheves and gathered up all the fode
of the.vij. plenteous years which were in the land of Egipte and put it in to
the cities. And he put the food of the feldes that grew round about every
cite: even in the same. And Joseph laid up corn in stoore / like unto the
sand of the sea in multitude out of mesure / until he left nombrynge: For it
was with out nombre.

And unto Joseph were borne.ij. sons before the years of hunger came / which
Asnath the daughter of Potiphara preast of On / bare unto him. And he called
the name of the first son Manasse / for God (said he) has made me forgett
all my labor and all my fathers husholde. The second called he Ephraim / for
God (said he) has caused me to grow in the land of my trouble.

And when the.vij. years of plenteousnes that was in the land of Egypt were
ended / than came the.vij. years of derth / acordynge as Joseph had said. And
the derth was in all lands: but in the land of Egipte was there yet food.
When now all the land of Egipte began to hunger / than cried the people to
Pharao for bread. And Pharao said unto all Egipte: goo unto Joseph / and what
he says to you that do And when the derth was through out all the land /
Joseph opened all that was in the cities and sold unto the Egiptia^s And
hunger waxed sore in the land of Egipte. And all countrees came to Egipte to
Joseph for to bye corn: because that the hunger was so sore in all lands.

The.xlij. Chapter.
WHen Jacob saw that there was corn to be sold in Egipte / he said unto his
sons: why are ye negligent? behold / I have heard that there is corn to be
sold in Egipte. Get you thither and bye us corn from thence / that we may
live and not dye. So went Joseph's ten brethern down to bye corn in Egipte /
for Ben Jamin Joseph's brother would not Jacob send with his other brethren: for
he said: some mysfortune might happen him

And the sons of Israel came to bye corn among other that came / for there
was derth also in the land of Canaan. And Joseph was gouerner in the land /
and sold corn to all the people of the land. And his brethren came / and
fell flatt on the ground before him. When Joseph saw ^^s brethern / he knew
them: But made strange unto them / and spoke rughly unto them saying: Whence
come ye? and they said: out of the land of Canaan / to bye vitayle. Joseph
knew his brethern / but they knew not him.

And Joseph remembered his dreams which he dreamed of them / and said unto
them: ye are spies / and to se where the land is weak is your coming. And
they said unto him: nay my lord: but to bye vitayle thy servants are come.
We are all one man's sons / and mean truly / and thy servants are no
spies. And he said unto them: nay verily / but even to se where the land is
weak is your coming. And they said: we thy servants are.xij. brethern /
the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is yet with our
father / and one no man woteth where he is.

Joseph said unto them / that is it that I said unto you / that ye are
surely spies. Here by ye shall be proved. For by the life of Pharao / ye shall
not goo hence / until your youngest brother be come hither. Send therefore one
off you and let him set your brother / and ye shall be in preason in the mean
season. And thereby shall your words be proved / whether there be any truth
in you: or else by the life of Pharao / ye are but spies. And he put them in
ward three days.

And Joseph said unto the^ the thryd day: This do and live / for I fear
Good If ye mean no hurt / let one of your brethern be bound in the preason
/ and goo ye and bring the necessary food unto your housholdes / and bring
your youngest brother unto me: that your words may be beleved / and that ye
dye not And they did so.

Than they said one to a another: we have verily sinned against our brother /
in that we saw the anguysh of his soull when he besought us / and would not
hear him: therefore is this troubyll come upon us. Ruben answered the^ saying:
said I not unto you that ye should not sin against the lad? but ye would not
hear And now verily see / his blood is required.

They were not aware that Joseph understood thein / for he spoke unto them by
an interpreter. And he turned from them and wept / and than turned to them
again and comened with them / and took out Simeon from among the^ and bownde
him before their eyes / and commanded to fill their sackes with corn / and to
put every man's money in his sack / and to give them vitayle to spend by the
way. And so it was done to them.

And they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence. And as one of
them opened his sack / for to give his ass prauender in the I^ne / he spied
his money in his sacks mouth And he said unto his brethren: my money is
restored me again / and is eue^ in my sackes mouth Than their hearts failed
them / and were astoynyed and said one to a another: how comes it that God
deals thus with us?

And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan / and told him
all that had happened them saying. The lord of the land spoke rughly to us /
and took us for spies to search the countte. And we said unto him: we mean
truly and are no spies. We be.xij. bretren sons of our father / one is
away / and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.

And the lord of the country said unto us: here by shall I know if ye mean
truly: leave one of your brethern here with me / and take food necessary for
your housholdes and get you away / and bring your youngest brother unto me
And thereby shall I know that ye are no spies / but mean truly: So will I
deliver you your brother again / and ye shall occupy in the land.

And as they emptied their sackes / behold: euerymans bundell of money was in
his sack And when both they and their father saw the bundells of money / they
were afraid.

And Jacob their father said unto them* We have ye robbed of my childern:
Joseph is away / and Simeon is away / and ye will take Ben Jamin away. All
these things fall upon me. Ruben answered his father saying: Slec my two
sons / if I bring him not to the again. Deliver him therefore to my hand /
and I will bring him to the again: And he said: my son shall not go down
with you. For his brother is dead / and he is left alone Moreover some mys
fortune might happen upon him by the way which ye goo. And so should ye bring
my gray head with sorrow unto the grave.

The.xliij. Chapter.
ANd the derth waxed sore in the land. And when they had eat up that corn
which they brought out of the land of Egipte / their father said unto them:
goo again and by us a little food. Than said Juda unto him: the man did
testify unto us saying: look that ye see not my face except your brother be
with you. Therefore if thou will send our brother with us / we will goo and
bye the food. But if thou wylt not send him / we will not goo: for the man
said unto us: look that ye see not my face / except your brother be with you.

And Israel said: wherefore dealt ye so cruelly with me / as to tell the man
that ye had yet another brother? And they said: The man asked us of our
kynred saying: is your father yet alive? have ye not another brother? And we
told him acordynge to these words. How cowd we know that he would bid us
bring our brother down with us? Than said Juda unto Israel his father:
Send the lad with me / and we will rise and goo / that we may live and not
dye: both we / thou and also our childern. I will be suertie for him / and of my
hands require him. If I bring him not to the and set him before thine eyes /
than let me bear the blame for ever. For except we had made this tarie^g: by
this we had been there twyse and come again.

Than their father Israel said unto the^: If it must needs be so now: than do
thus / take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels / and bring the
man a present / a courtesy bawlme / and a courtesy of honey / spyces and myrre /
dates and almondes. And take as much money more with you. And the money that
was brought again in your sackes / take it again with you in your hands /
peradventure it was some over syghte.

Take also your brother with you / and arise and goo again to the man. And
God almighty give you mercy in the sight of the man and send you your other
brother and also Be^ Jamin / and I will be as a man robbed of his childern.

Thus took they the present and twice so much more money with them / and Ben
Jamim. And rose up / went down to Egipte / and presented them self to Joseph.
When Joseph saw BenJamin with them / he said to the ruelar of his house:
bring these men home / and sley and make ready: for they shall dyne with me at
none. And the man did as Joseph bad / and brought them in to Joseph's house.

When they were brought to Joseph's house / they were afraid and said: be
cause of the money yt came in our sackes mouths at the first time / are we
brought / to pyke a quarrel with us and to lay some thing to our charge: to
bring us in bondage and our asses also. Therefore came they to the man that
was the ruelar over Joseph's house / and comened with him at the door and said:

Sir / we came hither at the first time to bye food / and as we came to an
Inn and opened our sackes: behold / every man's money was in his sack with
full weghte: But we have brought it agene with us / and other money have we
brought also in our hands / to bye food / but we can not tell who put our
money in our sackes.

And he said: be of good chere / fear not: Your God and the God of your
fathers has put you that treasure in your sackes / for I had your money. And
he brought Simeon out to them and led the^ into Joseph's house / and gave the^
water to wash their fete / and gave their asses prauender: And they made ready
their present against Joseph came at none / for they herd say that they
should dyne there.

When Joseph came home / they brought the present in to the house to him /
which they had in their hands / and fell ^^at on the ground be for him. And
he welcomed the^ courteously sainge: is your father that old man which ye told
me of / in good health? and is he yet alive* they answered: thy servaunte our
father is in good health / and is yet alive. And they bowed them selves and
fell to the ground.

And he lift up his eyes and beheld his brother Ben Jamin his mothers son /
and said: is this your youngest brother of whom ye said unto me? And said:
God be merciful unto y^ my son. And Joseph made have (for his heart did melt
upon his brother) and sought for to weep / and entered in to his chamber / for
to weep there. And he washed his face and came out and refrayned himself /
and bad set bread on the table

And they prepared for him by himself / and for them by them selves / and for
the Egiptians which ate with him by them selves / because the Egyptians may not
eat bread with the Hebrews / for that is an abhomynacyon unto the Egiptians.
And they satt before him: the eldest acordynge unto his age / and the youngest
acordyng unto his youth. And the men marveled among them selves. And they
brought rewards unto them from before him: but Ben Jamins part was five
times so much as any of theirs. And they ate and they drunk / and were drunk
with him.

The.xliiij. Chapter.
ANd be commanded the rueler of his house saying: fill the men's sackes with
food / as much as they can carry / and put every man's money in his bag mouth
/ and put my silver cup in the sackes mouth of the youngest and his come money
also. And he did as Joseph had said. And in y^ morning as soon is it was
light / the me^ were let goo with their asses.

And when they were out of the city and not yet far away / Joseph said
unto the ruelar of his house: up and follow after the men and overtake them /
and say unto them: wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? is that not the
cup of which my lord drynketh / and does he not prophecy therein? ye have
evil done that ye have done.

And he ouertoke them and said the same words unto them. And they answered
him: wherefore says my lord soch words? God forbydd that thy serva^untes
should do so. Behold / the money which we found in our sackes mouths / we
brought again unto the / out of the land of Canaa^: how then should we steal
out of my lords house / either silver or gold? with whosoever of thy
servants it be found let him dye / and let us also be my lords bondmen. And
he said: Now therefore acordynge unto your words / he with whom it is found
/ shall be my servant: but ye / shall be harmless.

And attonce every man took down his sack to the ground / and every man
opened his sack. And he serched / and began at the eldest and left at the
youngest. And the cup was found in Ben Jamins sack. Then they rent their
clothes / and laded every man his ass and went again unto the city. And Juda
and his brethren came to Joseph's house / for he was yet there / and they fell
before him on the ground. And Joseph said unto the^: what deed is this which
ye have done? wist ye not that soch a man as I can prophecy?

Then said Juda: what shall we say unto my lord / what shall we speak or
what excuse can we make? God has found out ye wekednesse of thy servants.
Behold / ^oth we and he with whom the cup is found / are thy servants.
And he answered: God forbid y^ I should do so / the man with whom the cup is
found / he shall be my servant: but goo ye in peace un to your father.

Then Juda went unto him and said: oh my lord / let thy servaunte speak a
word in my lords audyence / and be not wrooth with thy servaunte: for thou
art even as Pharao. My lord axed his servant sainge: have ye a father or a
brother? And we answered my lord / we have a father that is old / and a young
lad which he begat in his age: and the brother of the said lad is dead / and
he is all that is left of that mother. And his father loves him.

Then said my lord unto his servants bring him unto me / that I may set
mine eyes upon him. And we answered my lord / that the lad could not goo from
his father / for if he should leave his father / he were but a deed man. Than
said st thou unto thy servauntes: except your youngest brother come with you
/ love that ye se my face no moare.

And when we came unto thy servaunt our father / we showed him what my lord
had said. And when our father said unto us / goo again and bye us a little
fode: we said / yt we could not goo. Nevertheless if our youngeste brother go
with us then will we goo / for we may not see the man's face / except our
youngest brother be with us. Then said thy servaunt our father unto us. Ye
know that my wife bare me.ij. sons. And the one went out from me and it is
said of a suertie that he is torn in peaces of wyld beasts / and I saw him
not se^ce. If ye shall take this also away from me and some mys fortune happen
upon him / then shall ye bring my gray heed with sorrow unto the grave.

Now therefore when I come to thy servaunt my father / if the lad be not with
me: saying that his life ha^geth by the laddes life / then as soon as he sees
that the lad is not come / he will dye. So shall we thy servau^tes bring the
gray hedde of thy servaunt our father with sorrow unto the grave. For I thy
servaunt became suertie for the lad unto my father and said: if I bring him
not unto the again. I will bear the blame all my life long. Now therefore let
me thy servaunt bide here for y^ lad / and be my lords bondsman: and let the
lad goo home with his brethern. For how can I goo unto my father / and the lad
not with me: lest I should see the wretchedness that shall come on my father.

The.xlv. Chapter.
ANd Joseph could no longer refrain before all them that stood about him /
but commanded that they should goo all out from him / and that there should be
no man with him / while he vt^red him self unto his brethern. And he wept
alowde / so that the Egiptians and the house of Pharao herd it. And he said
unto his brethern: I am Joseph: does my father yet live? But his brethern could
not answer him / for they were abashed at his presence.

And Joseph said unto his brethern: come nere to me / and they came nere. And
he said: I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold in to Egipte. And now be not
grieved therewith / nether let it seem a cruel thing in your eyes / that ye
sold me hither. For God did send me before you to save life. For this is the
second year of derth in the land / and five moo are behind in which there
shall nether be earynge nor hervest.

Wherefore God sent me before you to make provision / that ye might continue in
the earth and to save your lives by a great delyuerance. So now it was not ye
that sent me hither / but God: and he has made me father unto Pharao and lord
over all his house / and ^ueler in all the land of Egipte. Have you and goo to
my father and tell him / this says thy son Joseph: God has made me lord
over all Egipte. Come down unto me and tarry not / And thou shall dwell in the
land of Gosan and be by me: both thou and thy childern / and thy childerns
childern: and thy sheep / and beestes and all that thou have. There will I make
provision for the: for there remain yet v years of derth / lest thou and thy
household and all that thou have perish.

Behold / your eyes do se / and the eyes also of my brother Ben Jamin / that
I speak to you by mouth. Therefore tell my father of all my bonoure which I
have in Egipte and of all that ye have seen / and make have and bring in
father hither. And he fell on his brother Ben Jamis neck and wept / and Ben
Jamin wept on his neck. Moreover he kyssed all his brethern and wept upon
them. And after that / his brethern talked with him. And when the ridynges was
come unto Pharaos housse that Josephes brethern were come / ^^ pleased Pharao
well and all his servants.

And Pharao spoke unto Joseph: say unto thy brethern / this do ye: lade your
beestes and get you hence / And when ye be come unto the land of Canaan / take
your father and your housholdes and come unto me / and I will give you the
best of the land of Egipte / and ye shall eat the fatt of the land. And
commanded also. This do ye: take charettes with you out of the land of Egipte
/ for your childern and for your wives: and bring your father and come.
Also / regard not your stuff / for the goods of all the land of Egipte
shall be youres.

And the childern of Israel did even so / And Joseph gave them charettes at
the commaundment of Pharao / and gave them ^^tayle also to spend by the way.
And he gave unto each of them change of raiment: but unto Ben Jamin he gave
iij. hundred pieces of silver and.v. change of raiment. And unto his father he
sent after the same manner: x. he asses laden with good out of Egipte / and.x.
she asses laden with corn / bred and meat: to serve his father by the way.
So sent he his brethern away / and they departed. And he said unto them: se
that ye fall no^ out by the way.

And they departed from Egipte and came in to the land of Canaan unto Jacob
their father / and told him saying* Joseph is yet a live and is gouerner over
all the land of Egipte. And Jacobs heart wauered / for he believed the^ not. And
they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them. But when
he saw the charettes which Joseph had sent to carry him / then his sprites
reviued. And Israel said. I have enough / if Joseph my son be yet alive: I
will goo and se him / yer that I dye.

The.xlvi. Chapter.
ISrael took his journey with all that he had / and came unto Berseba and
offered offrynges unto the God of his father Isaac. And God said unto Israel in
a vision by night / and called unto him: Jacob Jacob. And he answered: here am
I. And he said: I am that mighty God of thy father / fear not to goo down
in to Egipte. For I will make of the there a great people. I will go down with
y^ in to Egipte / and I will also bring the up again / and Joseph shall put
his hand upon thine eyes.

And Jacob rose up from Berseba. And ye sons of Israel carried Jacob their
father / and their childern and their wives in the charettes which Pharao had
sent to carry him. And they took their catell and the goods which they had
gotten in the land of Canaan / and came in to Egipte: both Jacob and all his
seed with him / his sons and his sons sons with him: his daughters and
his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him in to Egipte.

And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph that the way might be showed him
unto Gosan / and they came in to the land of Gosan And Joseph made ready his
charett and went against Jsraell his father unto Gosan / and presented him
self unto him / and fell on his neck and wept upon his neck a good while.

And Israel said unto Joseph: Now C^am co^te^t to dye / in somoch I have seen
the / that thou art yet alive.

And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house: I will goo and
show Pharao and tell him: that my brethern and my fathers housse which were in
the land of Canaan are come unto me / and how they are shepardes (for they
were men of catell) and they have brought their sheep and their oxen and all
that they have with them. If Pharao call you and axe you what your occupation
is / say: thy servants have been occupied about catell / from our chilhode
unto this time: both we and our fathers / that ye may dwell in the land of
Gosan. For an abhominacyon unto the Egiptians are all that seade sheep.

The.xlvij. Chapter.
ANd Joseph went and told Pharao and said: my father and my brethern their
sheep and their beasts and all that they have / are come out of the land of
Canaan and are in the land of Gosan. And Joseph took a part of his brethern:
even five of them / and presented them unto Pharao. And Pharao said unto his
brethern: what is your occupation? And they said unto Pharao: seaders of
sheep are thy servants / both we and also our fathers. They said moreover
unto Pharao: for to sogeorne in the land are we come / for thy servants have
no pasture for their sheep so sore is the fameshment in the land of Canaan.
Now therefore let thy servants dwell in the land of Gosan.

And Pharao said unto Joseph: thy father and thy brethren are come unto the.
The land of Egipte is open before the: In the best place of the land make
both thy father and thy brothren dwell: And even in the land of Gosan let them
dwell. Moreover if thou know any men of actiuyte among them / make them
ruelars over my catell. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him
before Pharao And Jacob blessed Pharao. And Pharao axed Jacob / how old art
thou? And Jacob said unto Pharao: the days of my pilgremage are an hundred
and.xxx. years* Few and evil have the days of my life been / and have not
attained unto the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their
pilgremages. And Jacob blessed Pharao and went out* from him. And Joseph
prepared dwellinges for his father and his brethern / and gave them possessions
in the land of Egipte / in the best of the land: eue^ in the land of Raemses
/ as Pharao commanded. And Joseph made prouysion for his father / his brethern
and all his fathers household / as young childern are fedd with bread.

There was no bread in all the land / for the derth was exceadige sore: so yt
ye lord of Egipte and ye lord of ^anaan / were fameshyd by ye reason of y^
derth. And Joseph brought together all y^ money yt was found in yt land of
Egipte and of Canaan / for ye come which they boughte: and he laid up the
money in Pharaos housse.

When money failed in the land of Egipte and of Canaan / all the Egiptians
came unto Joseph and said: give us sustenaunce: wherefore suffrest thou us to
dye before the / for our money is spent. Then said Joseph: bring your
catell / and I will give you for your catell / if ye be without money. And
they brought their catell unto Joseph. And he gave them bread for horses and
sheep / and oxen and asses: so he fed them with bread for all their catell that
year.

When that year was ended / they came unto him the next year and said unto
him: we will not hyde it from my lord / how that we have nether money nor
catell for my lord: there is no moare left for my lord / but even our bodies
and our lands. Wherefore latest thou us dye before thine eyes / and the land
to goo to naught? bye us and our lands for bread: and let both us and our
lands be bond to Pharao. Eeue us seed* that we may live and not dye / and
that the land god not to wast.

And Joseph boughte all the land of Egipte for Pharao. For the Egiptians sold
every man his land because the derth was sore apo^ them: and so the land
became Pharaos. And he appointed the people unto the cities / from one side of
Egipte unto the other: only the land of the Prestes bought he not. For there
was an ordinance made by Pharao for y^ The bli^de gydes get previleges from
beari^ge with their brethren contrary to Christ's law of love. And of these
prestes of idolles did ^ure co^passi^ge yvetrees learn to crepe up by little and
little and to compass y^ great trees of ye world with hypocrisye / and to
thrust y^ ro^es of idola tysse super^tition in to he^ and to su(...) out y^
^uce f the^ with heir poe^^ye / till all be seer bows and no thing grene save
their own com^ wealth.
pre astes / that they should eat that which was appointed unto them: which
Pharao had given them wherefore they sold not their lands.

Then Joseph said unto the folk: behold I have boughte you this day and
you^e lands for Pharao. Take there seed and goo sow the land. And of the
increase / ye shall give the fyfte part unto Pharao / and.iiij. partee shall be
your own / for seed to sow the feld: and for you / and them of your
housholdes / and for your childern / to eat. And they answered: Thou haste
saved our lyves Let us find grace in the syghte of my lord / and let us he
Pharaos servau^tes. And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egipte unto
this day: that men must give Pharao the fyfte part / except the land of the
preastes only / which was not bond unto Pharao.

And Israel dwelt in Egipte: even in the country of Gosan. And they had their
possessions therein / and they grew and multiplied exceadingly. Moreover Jacob
lived in the land of Egipte.xvij. years / so that the hole age of Jacob was an
hundred and.xlvij. year.

When the time drewenye / that Israel must dye: he sent for his son Joseph
and said unto him: If I have found grace in thy syghte / put thy hand under
my thye and deal mercifully and truly with me / that thou bury me not in
Egipte: but let me lie by my fathers / and c^rie me out of Egipte / and bury
me in their buryall. And he answered: I will do as thou have said. And he
said: swear unto me: and he swear unto him. And than Israel bowed him unto the
beds head.

The.xlviij. Chapter.
AFter these deades / tydi^ges were brought unto Joseph / that his father was
seek. And he took with him his ij. ^o^nes / Manasses and Ephraim. Then was it
said unto Jacob: behold / thy son Joseph comes unto the. And Israel took
his strength unto him / and satt up on the bed / and said unto Joseph: God
almighty appeared unto me at ^us in the land of Canaan / and blessed me /
and said unto me: behold / I will make the grow and will multiplye the / and
will ma ke a great nombre of people of the / and will give this land unto the
and unto thy seed after y^ unto an everlasting possession. Now therefore
thy.ij. sons Manasses and Ephraim which were borne unto the before I came to
the / into Egipte / shall be mine: even as Ruben and Simeo^ shall they be unto me
And the childern which thou getest after them / shall be thine own: but shall be
caller with the names of their brethern in their enheritaunces.

And after I came from Mesopotamia / Rabel dyed upon my ^ande in the land of
Canaa^ / by the way: when I had but a feldes bread to goo unto Ephrat. And I
buried her there in ye way to Ephrat which is now called Bethlehem.

And Israel beheld Iosephes sons and said: what are these? And Joseph said
unto his father: they are my sons / which God has given me here. And he
said: bring them to me / and let me bless them. And the eyes of Israel were
dymme for age / so that he could not see. And he brought them to him / and he
kyssed the^ and embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph: I had not thought
to have seen thy face / and yet loo / God has showed it me and also thy seed.
And Joseph took them away from his lap / and they fell on the ground before
him.

Than took Joseph them both: Ephraim in his right hand toward Isreal's left
hand and Manasses in his left hand / toward Isreal's right hand / and
brought them unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it
upon Ephraims head which was the younger / and his lift hand upon Manasses heed
/ crossinge his hands / for manasses was the elder. And he blessed Joseph
saying: God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did wal^e / and the God
which has fedd me all my life long unto this day / And the angel which has
delivered me from all evil / bless these laddes: yt they may be called after
my name / and after my father Abraham and Isaac / and that they may grow and
multiply ap^ the earth.

When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of
Ephraim / it displeased him. And he lift up his fathers hand / to have
removed it from Ephraims head unto Manasses head / and said unto his father:
Not so my father / for this is the eldest. Put thy right hand upon his head.
And his father would not / but said: I ^nowe it well my son / I ^nowe it
well. He shall be also a people and shall be great. But of a troth his younger
brother shall be greatter than he / and his seed shall be full of people. And he
blessed them sainge. At the ensample of these / the Israelites shall bless and
say: God ma^e the as Ephraim and as Manasses. Thus set he Ephraim before
Manasses.

And Israel said unto Joseph: behold / I dye. And god shall be with you and
bring you again unto the land of your fathers. Moreover I give unto the / a
porcyon of land above thy brethern / which I gatt out of the hands of the
Amoo^tes with my sword and with my bow.

The.xlix. Chapter.
ANd Jacob called for his sons and said: come together / that I may tell
you what shall happen you in the last days. Gather you together and hear ye
sons of Jacob / and her^en unto Israel your father.

Ruben / thou art mine eldest son / my might and the beginning of my
strength / chief in receauynge and chief in power. As unstable as water wast
thou: thou shall therefore not be the chefest / for thou wenst up upon thy
fathers bed / and than defyledest thou my couche with going up.

The brethern Simeon and Leui / weked instruments are their wepo^s. In to
their secrettes come not my soul / and unto their congregation be my honor
not coupled* forin their wrath they slew a man / and in their selfewill they
houghed an ox. Cursed be their wrath for it was strong / and their fearsnes
for it was cruel. I will therefore deuyde them in Jacob / and scater them in
Israel.

Judah / thy brethern shall praise the / and thine hand shall be in the neck of
thine enemies / and thy fathers childern shall stoop unto the. Judah is a lions
whelpe. From spoil my son thou art come an hye: he laid him down and
couched himself as a lion / and as a lioness. Who dare stere him up? The
scepter shall not depart from Judah / nor a ruelar from between his legs /
until Silo come / unto whom the people shall harken. He shall bind his fool
unto the vine / and his asses colt unto the vine branch / and shall wash his
garment in wine and his mantell in the blood of grapes / his eyes are roudier
than wine / and his teeth whit^er then milk.

Zabulon shall dwell in the haven of the sea and in the port of ships / and
shall reach unto Sidon.

Isachar is a strong ass / he couched him down between.ij. borders / and
saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant / and bowed his
shulder to bear / and became a servaunte unto trybute.

Dan shall judge his people / as one of the trybes of Israel. Dan shall be a
serpent in the way / and an edder in the path / and byte the horse heles / so
yt his ryder shall fall backwarde. After thy saving look I Lord.

God / men of war shall ^^ade him. And he shall turn them to flight.

Off Asser comes fatt breed / and he shall give pleasures for a king.

Nepthali is a swyft hynde / and gives goodly words.

That florishynge child Joseph / that flourishing child and goodly un to the
eye: the daughters come forth to bear ruele. The shoters have envyed him and
chyde with him and hated him / and yet his bow bode fast / and his arms and
his hands were strong / by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob: out of him
shall come an herd man a stone in Israel. Thy fathers God shall help the /
and the almighty shall bless the with blessings from heaven above / and with
blessings of the water that lies under / and with blessings of the breasts
and of the womb^ The blessings of thy father were strong: even as the
blessings of my elders / after the desire of the hiest in the world / and
these blessings shall fall on the head of Joseph / and on the top of the
head of him yt was separat from his brethern.

Ben Iamin is a raucshynge wolf. In the morning he shall devour his pray /
and at night he shall deuyde his spoil.

All these are the.xij. tribes of Israel / and this is that which their father
spoke unto them when he blessed them / every man with a several blessinge. And
he charged them and said unto them. I shall be put unto my people: se that ye
burye me with my fathers / in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the
Hethyte / in the double cave that is in the field before Mamre in the land of
Canaan. Which field. Abraham boughte of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to
burye in. There they buried Abraham and Sara his wife / there they buried Isaac
and Rebecca his wife. And there I buried Lea: which field and the cave that is
therein / was bought of the childern of Heth.

When Jacob had commanded all that he would unto his sons / be plucked up his
fete upon the bed and dyed / and was put unto his people. And Joseph fell upon
his fathers face / and wept upon him / and kyssed him.

The.l. Chapter.
ANd Joseph commanded his servants that were Phisicions / to embawme his
father / and the Phisicio^s e^^awmed Israel.xl. days long / for so long does
y^ embawminge last / and the Egiptians bewepte him.lxx. days.

And when the days of weeping were ended / Joseph spoke unto ye house of
Pharao saying: If I have found favor in your eyes / speak unto Pharao and
tell him / how that my father made me swear and said: loo / I dye / se that
thou burye me in my grave which I have made me in the land of Canaan. Now
therefore let me goo and burye my father / and tha^ will I come again. And
Pharao said / goo and burye thy father / acor^ynge as he made the swear.

And Joseph went up to bury his father / and with him went all the servants
of Pharao that were the elders of his house / and all ye elders of Egipte / and
all the house of Joseph and his brethern and his fathers house: only their
childern and their sheep and their catell left they behind them in the land
of Gosan. And there went with him also Charettes and horsemen: so that they
were an exceadynge great company.

And when they came to yt feld of Atad beyond Iordane / there they made great
and exceadinge sore lamentacio^. And he morned for his father.vij. days. When
the enhabiters of the land the Cananytes saw the moornynge in y^ field of
A^ad / they said: this is a great moornynge which the Egiptians make.
Wherefore y^ name of the place is called Abel mizraim / which place lies
beyond Jordane. And his sons did unto him acordynge as he had commanded
them.

And his sons carried him in to the land of Canaan and buried him in the
double cave which Abraham had boughte with the field to be a place to burye in
/ of Ephron the Hethite before Mamre. And Joseph returned to Egipte again and
his brethern / and all that went up with him to burye his father / as soon as he
had buried him.

When Joseph's brethern saw that their father was dead / they said: Joseph
might for tune to hate us and reward us again a^^ the evil which we did
unto him. They did therefore a commaundment unto Joseph saying: thy father
charged before his death saying. This wise say unto Joseph / forgive I pray the
the trespace of thy brethern and their sin / for they rewarded the evil. Now
therefore we pray the^ forgive the trespace of the servauntes of thy fathers
God. And Joseph wept when they spa^e unto him.

And his brethern came and fell before him and said: behold we he thy
servauntes. And Joseph said unto them: fear not / for am not I under god? Ye
thought evil unto me: but God turned it unto good to bring to pass / as it
is this day / even to save much people a live fear not therefore / for I will
care for you and for your childern / and he spoke kyndly unto them.

Joseph dwelt in Egipte and his fathers house also / and lyved an hundred
and.x. year. And Joseph saw Ephraims childern / eue^ unto the third
generation. And unto Machir the son of Manasses were childern borne / and
satt on Joseph's knees.

And Joseph said unto his brethern: I die And God will suerlie vysett you and
bring you out of this land / unto the land which he swear unto Abraham /
Isaac and Jacob. And Joseph took an ooth of the childern of Israel and said:
God will not fail but vysett you / se th^^fore that ye carye my boones hence.
And so Joseph dyed / when he was an hundred and.x. year old. And they
enba*w^^ed him and put him in a chest in Egipte.

a prehemynence yt men should rest therein from bodily labor and learn to know
the will of god and his laws and how to work their works godly all the w^ke
after. God also blesses all nations in Abraham's seed / that is / he turns
his love and favor unto the^ and geveth the^ his spirit and knowledge of the
true way / and lust and power to walk therein / and all for christ's sake
Abraham's son. Cain / so is it written in Hebrew. Notwitsto^dinge whether we
call him Cain or caim it makes no matter / so we understand the meaning.
Every land has his manner / that we call Jhon^ the welchemen call Evan: the
douch ha^^^. Soch difference is between the Ebrue / greek and laten: and that
makes them that translate out of the ebrue varye in names from them that
translate out of laten or greek. Curse: Gods curse is the taking away of his
benefytes. As god cursed the earth and made it baren. So now hunger / derth /
war / pestilence and soch like are yet right curses and signs of the wrath
of God unto the unbelievers: but unto them that know Christ / they are very
blessings and that wholesome cross and true purgatory of our flesh / through
which all must go that will live godly and be saved: as thou read Man.v.
Blessed are they that suffer persecution for rightewesnes sake. etc. And
hebrews.xi. The lord chastyseth whom he loves and s^orgeth all the children
that he receaveth. Eden: pleasure Firmament: the skye^ Faith is the belevinge
of gods promesses and a sure trust in the goodness and truth of god. Which
faith iustifyeth Abraham gene.xv. and was the mother of all his good works
which he afterward did. For faith is the goodness of all works in the sight
of God. Good works are things of gods comaundeme^t wrought in faith. And to
sow a show at the commandment of god to do thy neighbor service withal /
with faith to be saved by Christ (as god promyseth us.) is much better the^ to
bild an abbay of thine own imagination / trustinge to be saved by the feigned
works of hypocrites. Jacob robbed Laban his uncle: Moses robbed the Egiptians:
And Abraham is about to slay and burn his own son: And all are holy
works / because they were wrought in faith at gods commandment. To stele /
rob and murder are no holy works before worldly people: but unto them that
have their trust in god: they are holy when god commands them. What god
commands not gets no reward with god. Holy works of men's imagination
receave their reward here / as Christ testyfyeth Math.vj. How be it of faith
and works I have spoken abundantly in mammon. Let him that desires more seek
there. Grace: favor / As ^oe found grace / that is to say favor and love.
Ham and Came all one. Jehovah is gods name / nether is any creature so called.
And it is as much to say as one that is of him self and depends of nothing.
Moreover as often as thou seist Lord in gre* at letters (except there be any
error in the pre^tinge) it is in hebrewe Jehovah / thou that art or he that

of the slaughtermen And though that Tabaim be taken for cokes in many places /
for the cokes did ^le the beasts the^ selves in those days: yet it may be
taken for them that put men to execution also. And that me thought it should
here best signifye in as much as he had the oversight of the kings preson and
the kings presoners were they never so great me^ were under his custodye And
therefore I call him cheffe marshall an officer as is the lefetenaunte of the
toure / or master of the marshalsye. Slyme was their mortar.xi. Chapter / And
slyme pittes. x^ij. chapter: that slyme was a fattenesse that os^dout of the

after some is as much to say as sent / and after some happy / and after some
it signifies Mesias / yt is to say anointed and that we call Christ after
the greek word. And it is a prophecy of Christ: For after yt all y^ other
tribes were in captivity and their kingdom destroyed / yet the tribe of Judah
had a ruler of the samebloud / even unto the coming of Christ. And about the
com^ge of Christ the Romayn^ conquered them / and the Emperor gave the
kingdom of tribe Judah unto Herod which was a stranger / even an Edomite of
the generacyon of Esau. Testament here / is an appoynteme^t made between god
and man / and gods promyses. And sacrament is a sign representinge soch an
appoyn^^ment and promeses: As the raynebowe represents the promise made to
^oe / that god will no more drown the world. And circumcision represents
the promyses of god to Abraham on the one side / and that Abraham and his s^ed
should circumcyse and cut off the lusts of their fresh / on the other side /
to walk in the ways of the lord: As baptyme which is come in the room
thereof* now signifies on the one side / how that all that repent and believe
are washed in Christ's blood: And on the other side / how that the same must
quench and droune the lusts of the flesh / to follow the steps of Christ.
There were tyrants in the earth in those days / for the sons of god saw the
daughters of men. etc. The sons of god were the prophets childerne / which
(though they succeeded there fathers) fell yet from the right way / and through
falsehod of hypocrysye subdued the world under them and became tyrants / As
the successors of the apostles have played with us. Vapor / a dewymiste / as
the smoke of a sethy^^ g^ pott. To walk with god is to lyve godly and to walk
in his commandments. Enos walked with god and was no moare seen: that is /
he lyved godly and dyed / God took him away: that is / god hyd his body / as
he did Moses and Aarons: lest haplye they should have made an Idol of him / for
he was a great preacher and an holy man. Zap^nath paenea / words of Egipte
are they (as I suppose) and as much to say: as a man to whom secret things
be opened / or an expounder of secret things as some enterprete it.

That Joseph brought the egiptians in to soch subjection would seem unto some a
very cruel dead: how be it it was a very equal way. For they paid but the
fifte part of that that grew on the ground. And therewith were they q^ytt of
all duetyes / both of rent / custom / tribute and ^oll. And the king therewith
found them lords and all ministres and defended them. We now pay half so
much unto the prestes only / beside their other craft ye exactions. Then pay
we rent yearly / though there grow never so little on the ground / And yet when
the king calls pay we never the less. So that if we look indifferently /
their condition was easyar the^ ours / and but even a very indifferent way /
both for the comen people and the king also. Se therefore that thou look not on
the ensamples of the scripture with wordly eyes: lest thou prefer Cain before
Abel / Ismael before Isaae / Esau before Jacob / Ruben before Juda / Sarah
before Pharez / Manasses before Ephraim. And even the worst before the best /
as the manner of the world is.

A PROLOGE IN TO THE Second book of Moses called Exodus.
OF the preface upon Genesis may thou understand how to behave thy silf in
this book also and i^ all other books of the scripture. Cleave unto the text
and plain storye and endevoure thy silf to search out the meaning of all that
is described therein and the true sense of all manner of speakynges of the
scripture of proverbes, similitudes and borrowed speech, whereof I entreated in
the end of the obedience, and beware of sotle allegoryes. And note every
thing ernestly as things partayninge unto thine own heart and soul. For as
god used him sylf unto them of the old testament, even so shall he unto the
worlds end use him silf unto us which have received his holy scripture and
the testimonye of his son Jesus. As god does all things here for them that
beleve his promises and harken unto his commaundmentes and with patience cleave
unto him and walk with him: even so shall he do for us, if we receive the
witness of Christ with a strong faith and endure patiently folowinge his
steps. And on the othersyde, as they that fell from the promises of god
through vnbeleffe and from his law and ordinances through impaciencie of their
own lusts, were for saken of god and so peryshed: even so shall we as many as
do likewise and as many as mock with the doctine of christ and make a cloak of
it to live fleshlye and to folowoure lusts.

Note thereto how god is found true at the last, and how when all is past
remedy and brought into desperacion, he then fulfilleth his promises, and that
by an abiecte and a castawaye, a despised and a refused person: ye and by away
impossible to believe.

The cause of all captivity of gods people is this. The world ever hates
them for their faith and trust which they have in god: but i^ vain until they
fall from the faith of the promyses and love of the law and ordinances of
god, and put their trust in holy deades of their own findinge and live all to
gether at their own lust and pleasure without regard of god or respect of
their neygboure. Then god forsakes us and sends us in to captivity for our
dishonouringe of his name and despisinge of our neighbor. But the world
persecuteth us for our faith in christ only (as the pope now does) and not
for our weked livinge For in his ki^gdome thou may quietly and with license
and under a protection do whath so ever abhominatio^ thy heart lusts: but
god persecuteth us because we abuse his holy testament, and because that when
we know the truth we follow it not.

Note also the mighty hand of the Lord how he plays with his adversaries
and provokes the^ and sturreth the^ up a little and a little, and delivers
not his people in an hour: that both the patience of his elect and also the
worldly wit and wilye policye of the weked wherewith they fight against god,
might appear.

Mark the longesoferinge and soft patience of Moses and how he loves the
people and is ever between the wrath of god and the^ and is ready to live and
dye with the^ and to be put out of the book that god had written for their sakes
(as Paul for his brothren Roma.ix.) and how he takes his own wro^ges
pacientlie and never avengeth him silf. And make not Moses a figure of Christ
with Rochestre: but an ensample unto all princes and to all that are in
authorite how to rule unto gods pleasure and unto their neighbors profette.
For there is not a perfecter lyffe in this world both to the honor of god and
profytte of his neygboure nor yet a greatter cross, the^ to rule christenlye.
And of Aaren also se that thou make no figure of christ until he come unto his
sacrifisinge, but an ensample unto all preachers of gods word, that they
add nothing unto gods word or take ought therfro.

Note also how god sends his promise to the people and Moses consermeth it
with miracles and the people beleve. But when te^ptacion comes they fall into
vnbeleffe and few bide sto^dinge. Where thou see that all be not christian
that will be so called, and that the cross tries the true from the feigned: for
if the cross were not Christ should have dissiples ynowe. Whereof also thou
see what an excellent gift off god true faith is, and impossible to be had
with out the sprete of god. For it is above all natural power that a man in
time of temptation when god scorgeth him should believe then stedfastlye how that
god loves him and cares for hi^ and has prepared all good things for him,
and that that scorginge is as ernest that god has elect and chose him.

Note how often Moses sturreth the^ up to beleve and to trust in god, puttinge
the^ in remembrance always in time of temptation of the miracles and wonders
which god had wrought before time in their eysight. How diligently also
forbids he all that might with draw their hearts from god? to put naught to
gods word: to take naught therfro: to do only that which is right in the
sight of the Lord: that they should make no manner image to knele down before
it: ye that they should make none altar of hewed stone for fear off images: to
slay the hethen Idolatres utterly and to destroy their Idolles and cut down
their groves where they worshupped: And that they should not take the daughters
of them unto their sons, nor give their daughters to the sons of them. And
that whosoever moved any of the^ to worshuppe false gods, how so ever nigh of
kynne he were, they must accuse him and bring him to death, ye and wheresoever
they hard of man, woman or city that worshupped false gods, they must slay
the^ and destroy the city for ever and not bild it again. And all because
they should worshuppe nothing but God, nor put confidence in anythinge save in
his word Ye and how warns he to beware of witch craft, sorcery,
inchauntment, negroma^tie and all crafts of the devell, and of dreamers,
sorthsayers and of myracledoers to destroy his word, and that they should
suffer none soch to live,

Thou will happlye say, They tell a man the truth. What then? God will that
we care not to know what shall come. He will have us care only to keep his
commaundme^tes and to commytre all chaunses unto him He has promised to care
for us and to keep us from all evell. All things are in his hand, he can
remedy all things and will for his truths sake, if we pray him. In his
promyses only will he have us trust and there rest and to seek no farther.

How also does he provoke them to love, ever rehersynge the benefits of God
done to them already and the godly promyses that were to come? And how goodly
laws of love geveth he? to help one another: and that a man should not hate
his neighbor in his heart, but love him as him filf, Leuitici.xix. And what a
charge gives he in every place over the poor and neadye: over the stranger
friendless and wedowe? And when he desires to show mercy, he reherseth with
all, the benefits of God done to them at their neade, that they might sea
cause at the lest way in God to show mercy of very love unto their
neighbors at the ir neade.

Also there is no law so simple in apperaunce through out all the five books of
Moses, but that there is a great reason of the making thereof if a man search
diligently. As that a man is forbid to seth a kyd in his mothers milk, moves
us unto compassyon and to be pytyefull, As does also that a man shall not offer
the sire or dame and the young both in one day Leuitici.xxij. For it might
seem a cruel thing in as much as his mothers milk is as it were his blood,
wherefore god will not have him sod therein: but will have a man show curtesye
upon the very beasts: As in another place he commands that we mosell not
the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn (which manner of thresshinge
is used in hot contrees) and that because we should much rather not grudge to
be liberal and kind unto me^ that do us service. Or happlye God would have no
soch wanton meat used among his people. For the kyd of it self is noryshinge
and the gotes milk is restauretyue, and both to gether might be to rank and
therefore forbode^ or some other like cause therewas.

Of the ceremonies, sacrifices and tabernacle with all his glory and pomp
understood, that they were not permitted only, but also commanded of God to
lead the people in the shadows of Moses and night of the old testament, until
the light of christ and day of the new testament were come: As children are
led in the fantasies of youth, until the discretion of ma^sage become upon
them. And all was done to keep them from idolatrye. The tabernacle was ordened
to the intent they might have a place appointed them to do their sacrifices
openly in the sight of the people and namelye of the preastes which waited
thero^: that it might be seen that they did all thing acordi^g to gods word,
and not after the Idolatry of their own imaginacion. And the costlinesse of
the tabernacle and the bewtye also pertayned thereunto, that they should se
nothing so bewtifull among the hethe^, but that they should se more bewtifull
and wonderful at home: because they should not be moved to follow them. And in
like manner the diverse facions of the sacrifices and ceremonies was to occupye
their minds that they should have no lust to follow the hethe^: and the
multitude of them was, that they should have so much to do in kepinge the^ that
they should have no leisure to ymagine other of their own: ye and that gods
word might be by in all that they did, that they might have their faith and
trust in God, which he can not have, that either follows his own invencyons,
or tradicyons of me^nes making with out Gods word.

Finally God has two testamentes: the old and the new. The old testament is
those temporal promyses which God made the children of Israel of a good land
and that he would defend them, and of wealth and prosperyte and of temporal
blessings of which thou read over all the law of Moses, But namelye
Leuitici. xxv^. And Deuteromij.xxviij. and the avoydynge of all threateninges
and curses off which thou read likewise everye where* but specyallye in the
two places above rehearsed, and the avoydinge of all punyshme^t ordened for the
transgressers of the law.

And the old testament was bilt all to gether upon the kepinge of the law and
ceremonies and was the reward of kepinge of the^ in this liffe only, and
reached no further then this liffe and this world, as thou read leui.xviij.
a man that does them shall live there in which text Paul reherseth Romansx. and
Gala.iij. That is, he that keeps them shall have this liffe gloriouse
according to all the promises and blessings of the law, and shall avoyde
both all temporal punishment of the law, with all the threateninges and
cursinges also. For nether the law, even of the.x. co^maundmentes nor yet the
ceremonies justified in the heart before god, or purifyed unto the life to
come. Insomoch that Moses at his deeth even.xl. year after the law and
ceremonies were given complayneth saying: God has not geven you an heart to
understand, nor eyes to se, nor ears to hear unto this day. As who should
say, god has given you ceremonies, but ye know not the use of them, and has
given you a law, but has not written it in your hearts.

Wherefore serves the law then, if it give us no power to do the law? Paul
answers the, that it was given to utter sin only and to make it appear. As
a corosye is laid unto an old sore, not to heal it, but to stere it up and to
make the disease alyve, that a man might feale in what ioperdye he is and how
nigh deeth and not aware, and to make away unto the healinge plaster. Eue^ so
says Paul Gala.iij. The law was geven because of transgressio^ (that is, to
make the sin alyve that it might be felt and seen) until the seed came unto
whom it was promised: that is to say, until the childern of faith came, or
until Christ that seed in whom god promised Abraham that all nations of the
world should be blessed, came. That is, the law was given to utter sin,
deeth damnation and curse, and to dryve unto Christ in who^ forgiveness, life,
iustifyinge and blessings were promised, that we might se so great love of
god to us ward in christ, that we he^ceforth overcome with kindness might love
again and of love keep the co^mau^dme^tes. So now he that goes about to
quiette his conscience and to iustifye him silf with the law, does but heal
his wondes with freatige coresyes. And he that goes about to purchase grace
with ceremonies, does but suck the alepope to qwe^ch his thirst, in as much as
the ceremonies were not geve^ to justify the heart, but to signify the
iustifiynge: and forgiveness that is in christ's blood

Of the ceremonies that they justify not, thou read. Ebrues.x. It is
impossible that sin should be done away with the blood of oxe^ and gootes.
And of the law thou read. Gala.iij. If there had been a law given that
could have quykened or given liffe, then had righteousness or iustifyinge come
by the law in deed. Now the law not only quyckeneth not the heart, but also
wounds it with conscience of sin and ministers deeth and damnacio^ unto
her: ij. Corin.iij. so that she must neades dye and be damned except she find
other remedy, so far it is of that she is justified or help by the law.

The new testament is those everlasting promyses which are made us in christ
the Lord through out all the scripture. And that testament is bylt on faith and
not on works. For it is not said of that testament he that works shall
live: But he that beleveth shall live, as thou read. Joan.iij. God so loved
the world that he gave his only begote^ son that none which believe in hi
should perish but have everlasting life.

And when this testament is preached and believed, the sprete enters the heart
and quyckeneth it, and gives her life and justifies her. The sprete also
makes the law a lively thing in the heart, so that a man brings forth good
works of his own acord without compulsio^ of the law, without fear of
threateninges or cursinges: ye and with out all manner respect or love unto
any temporal pleasure, But of the very power of the sprete received through
faith, As thou read. Joan.i. He gave them power to be the sons of God in
that they believed on his name. And of that power they work: so that he which
has the sprete of christ is now no moare a child: he nether learneth or
works now any longer for pain of the rod or for fear of boogges or
pleasure of apples, But does althinges of his own courage As christ says.
Joan.vij. He that believes on me shall have rivers of lyuinge water flowinge
out of his belie. That is, All good works and all gifts of grace spring out
of him naturallye and by their own accord. Thou neadest not to wrest good
works out of him as a man would wringe veriuce out of crabbes: Nay they flow
naturally out of him as springes out off hills or rocks.

The new testament was ever, eue^ from the beginning of the world. For there
were always promyses of Christ to come by faith in which promyses the elect
were then justified inwardly before God, as outwardly before the world by
keeping of the law and ceremonies

And in conclusyon as thou seyst blessings or cursings follow the kepinge or
breaking of the law of Moses: eue^ so naturally do blessings or cursings
follow the breakyng or keeping of the law of nature, out of which spri^ge all
our temporal laws. So that when the people keep the temporal laws of their
land temporal prosperity and all manner of soch te^porall blessing as thou
read of in Moses do accompanye them and fall upon them. And contraryewyse
when they sin unpunished, and when the rulars have no respect unto natural
equity or honestye, the^ God sends his curses among the^, as hungre, derth,
moren banynge, pestilence, war, oppressyon with strange and wonderful
diseases and newekyndes of misfortune and evell luck,

If any man axe me, seeing that faith justifies me why I work? I answer love
co^pelleth me For as long as my soul fealeth what love god has showed me in
Christ, I can not but love god again and his will and co^mau^dme^tes and of
love work them, nor ca^ they seem hard un to me. I think not my self better
for my workynge, nor seek heaven nor an hyer place in heaven because of it. For a
christian works to make his weak brother perfecter, and not to seek an hier
place in heaven. I compare not my filf unto him that works not: No, he that
works not to day shall have grace to turn and to work tomorow, and in the
mean ceason I pytye him and pray for him. If I had wrought the will of god
these thousand years, and another had wrought the will of the devell as long
and this day turn and be as well willing to suffer with Christas ^, he has
this day ouertake^ me and is as far come as I, and shall have as much
reward as I. And I envye him not, but rejoice most of all as of lofte tresure
found. For if I be of god, I have this thousand year sofred to win him for
to come and praise the name of God with me: this. M. years I have prayed
sorowed, longed, syghed and sought for that which I have this day found, and
therefore rejoice with all my might and praise God for his grace and mercy.

The first Chapter.
THese are the names of the children of Israel, which came to Egipte with Jacob
/ every man with his household: Rube^, Simeon, Leui, Judah, Isachar, Zabulon,
Benjamin, Dan, Neptali, Gad and Aser. All the souls that came out of the
Ioynes of Jacob, were.lxx. and Joseph was in Egipte all ready. when Joseph was
dead and all his brethern and all that generation: the children of Israel
grew, increased, multiplied and waxed enceadinge myghtie: so that the land
was full of them.

Then there rose up a new king in Egipte which knew not Joseph. And he said
unto his folk: behold the people of the children of Israel are moo and
mightier than we. Come on, let us play wisely with them: lest they multiply,
and then (if there chance any war) they join them selves unto our enemies
and fight against us, and so get them out of the land.

And he set taskemasters over them, to ke^pe them under with burdens. And
they bylvnto Pharao treasurecities: Phiton and Raamses. But the more they vexed
the^, the moare they multiplied and grew: so that they abhorred the children
of Israel. And the Egiptia^s held the childern of Israel in bondage without
mercy, and made their lives bitter unto them with cruel labor in claye and
brick, and all manner work in the feldes, and in all manner of service, which
they caused the^ to work cruelly

And the king of Egipte said unto the mydwiues of the Ebrues women, of which
the ones name was Ziphra and the other Pua: when ye mydwiue the women of the
Ebrues and se in the birth time that it is a boy, kill it. But if it be a
maid, let it live. Notwithstonding the mydwiues feared God, and did not as the
king of Egipte commanded them: but saved the menchildern.

The^ the king of Egipte called for the midwiues and said unto the^: why have
ye dealt on this manner and have saved the menchildern? And the mydwiues answered
Pharao, that the Ebrues women were not as the women of Egipte: but were sturdie
women, and were delivered yer the midwyues came at them. And God therefore dealt
well with the midwyues. And the people multiplied and waxed very mighty. And
because the mydwiues feared God, he made them houses.

Than Pharao charged all his pepple sayng All the menchildern that are borne,
cast in to the river and save the maydchildern a live.

The second Chapter.
ANd there went a man of the house of Leui and took a daughter of Leui. And the
wife conceived and bare a son. And when she saw that it was a propre child,
she hyd him three months long. And when she could no longer hyde him, she
took a basket of bulrusshes and dawbed it with slyme and pytche, and laid the
child therein, and put it in the flagges by the rivers brynke. And his sister
stood a far of, to wete what would come of it.

And the daughter of Pharao came down to the river to wash her self, and her
maidens walked a long by the rivers side. And when she saw the basket among
the flagges, she sent one of her maids and caused it to be fet. And when she
had opened it she saw the child. and behold, the babe wept. And she had
co^passio^ on it and said: it is one of the Ebrues childern

Then said his sister unto Pharaos daughter: shall I goo and call unto the a
nurse of the Ebrues women, to nurse the the child? And the maid ran and
called the childs mother. The^ Pharaos daughter said unto her Take this
child away and nurse it for me, and I will reward the for thy labor. And
the woman took the child and nursed it up.

And when the child was grown, she brought it unto Pharaos daughter, and it
was made her son, and she called it Moses, because (said she) I took him out
of the water.

And it happened in these days when Mo ses was waxte great, that he went out
unto his brethern and looked on their burdens, and spied an Egiptian smiting
one of his brethern an Ebrue. And he looked round about: and when he saw that
there was no man by, he sle we the Egiptian and hyd hi^ in the sonde. And he
went out a another day: and behold, two Ebrues strove to gether. And he said
unto him that did the wrong: wherefore smytest thou thine neighbor? And he
answered: who has made the a ruelar or aiudge over us? intendest thou to kill
me, as thou killedst the Egiptain? Then Moses feared and said: of a suertie
the thing is known. And Pharao her de of it and went about to slay Moses:
but he fled from Pharao and dwelt in the land of Madian, and he satt down by
a wells side.

The preast of Madianh a d.vij. daughters which came and drew water and filled
the troughes, for to water their fathers sheep. And the shepardes came and
drove them away: But Moses stood up and helped them and waterd their sheep.
And when they came to Raguel their father, he said: how happens it that ye
are come so soon to day? And they answerede there was an Egiptia^ that
delivered us from the shepardes, and also drew us water and waterd the sheep.
And he said unto his daughters: where is he? why have ye left the man? Goo
call him that he may eat bread.

And Moses was content to dwell with the man. And he gave Moses Zipora his
daughter which bare a son, and he called him Gerson: for he said. I have
been a stranger in a strange land. And she bare yet another son, whom he
called Elieser sayng: the God of my father is mine helper, and has rid me out
of the hands of Pharao.

And it chanced in process of time, that the king of Egipte dyed, and the
childern of Israel syghed by the reason of labor and cried. And their
complaynt came up unto God from the labor. And God remembered his promise with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel and knew
them.

The third Chapter.
MOses kept the sheep of Iethro his father in law preast of Madian, and he
drove the flock to the backesyde of the deser te, and came to the mountain of
God, Horeb. And the angel of the Lord apeared unto hi^ in a flame of fire out
of a bush. And he perceived that the bush burned with fire and consumed not.
Than Moses said: I will goo hence and see this great syghte, how it comes
that the bushe burns not. And when the Lord saw that he came for to see, he
called unto him out of the bush and said: Moses Moses And he answered: here am
I. And he said: come not hither, but put thy shoes off thy fete: for the
place whereon thou stondest is holy ground. And he said: I am the God of thy
father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob And Moses hyd
his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

Than the Lord said: I have surely seen the trouble of my people which are in
Egipte and have herd their cry which they have of their taskemasters. For I
know their sorrow and am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the
Egiptians, and to bring the^ out of that land unto a good land and a large,
and unto a land that flows with milk and honey: even unto the place of the
Canaanites, Hethites, Amorites, Pherezites, Heuites, and of the Iebusites.

Now therefore behold, the complaynt of the children of Israel is come unto me
and I have also seen the oppression, wherewith the Egiptians oppress them. But
come, I will send the unto Pharao, that thou may bring my people the
childern of Israel out of Egipte.

And Moses said unto God: what am I to goo to Pharao and to bring the
children of Iraell out of Egipte? And he said: I will be with the. And this
shall be a token unto the that I have sent the: after that thou have brought the
people out of Egipte, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

Than said Moses unto God: when I come unto the childern of Israel and say
unto them, the God of your fathers has sent me unto you, and they say unto
me, what is his name* what answer shall I geuethem? Then say Of this word, I
will be* comes the name of God Jehovah which we interpret, Lord, and is as
mo^h to say as I that ^^.
de God unto Moses: I will be what I will be: and he said, this shall thou say
unto the children of Israel: I will be did send me to you.

And God spoke further unto Moses: thus shall thou say unto the children of
Israel: the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob has sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this
is my memorial through out all generacyons. Goo therefore and gather the elders
of Israel to gether and say unto them: the Lord God of your fathers, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, appeared unto me and said:
I have be ne and seen both you and that which is done to you in Egipte. And I
have said it, that I will bring you out of the tribulacio^ of Egipte unto the
land of the Canaanites, Hethites Amorites, Pherezites, Heuites and Iebusites:
even a land that flows with milk and honey

If it come to pass that they hear thy voice, then goo, both thou and the
elders of Israel unto the king of Egipte and say unto him: The Lord God of
the Ebrues has met with us: Let us goo therefore.iij. days journey in to the
wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God. Notwithstondinge I
am sure that the king of Egipte will not let you goo, except it be with a
mighty hand: ye and I will therefore stretche out mine hand, and smite Egipte
with all my wonders which I will do therein. And after that he will let you goo.

And I will get this people favor in the syghte of the Egiptians: so that
when ye goo, ye shall not goo empty: but every wife shall borow of her
neyghbouresse and of her that sogeorneth in her house, jewels of silver and of
gold and ray meant. And ye shall put them on your sons and daughters, and
shall rob the Egiptians.

The.iiij. Chaptre.
MOses answered and said: Se, they will not believe me nor herke^ unto my voice:
but will say, the Lord has not apeared unto the. Then the Lord said unto
him: what is that in thine hand? and he said, a rodd. And he said, cast it
on the ground, and it turned unto a serpent. And Moses ra^ away from it. And
the Lord said unto Moses: put forth thine hand and take it by the tail. And
he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a rodd again in his hand,
that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has appeared unto the.

And the Lord said forther more unto him: thrust thine hand in to thy
bosom. And he thrust his hand in to his bosom and took it out. And behold,
his hand was leporous even as snow. And he said: put thine hand in to thy
bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and plucked it out
of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. If they
will not believe the nether hear the voice of the first token: yet will they
believe the voice of the second toke^ But and if they will not believe the two
signs nether harken unto thy voice, then take of the water of the river and
pour it upon the dry land. And the water which thou take out of the river
shall turn to blood upon the dry land.

And Moses said unto the Lord: oh my Lord. I am not eloque^t, no not in
times past and namely sense thou have spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow
mouthed and slow tongued. And the Lord said unto hi^: who has made ma^s
mouth, or who has made the domme or the deaff, the seeing or the blind? have
not I the Lord? Go therefore and I will be with thy mouth and teach the what thou
shall say.

And he said: oh my Lord, send I pray the whom thou will. And the Lord was
angry with Moses and said: I know Aaron thy brother the leuite that he can
speak. And morouer behold, he comes out against the, and when he seyth the,
he will be gladi^ his heart. And thou shall speak unto hi^ and put the words in
his mouth, and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you
what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesr^a^ unto the people: he shall be thy
mouth and thou shall be his God. and take this rodd in thy hand, where with
thou shall do miracles.

And Moses went and returned to Iethro his father in law again and seyde unto
hi^: let me goo (I pray the) and turn again unto my brethern which are in
Egipte, that I may se whether they be yet alive. And Iethro said to Moses: goo
in peace. And the Lord said unto Moses in Madia^: return again in to Egipte
for they are dead which went about to kill the And Moses took his wife and his
sons and put them on an ass, and went again to Egipte, and took the rodd of
God in his hand.

And the Lord said unto Moses: when thou art come in to Egipte again, se
that thou do all the wondres before Pharao which I have put in thy hand: but
I will harden his heart, so that he shall not let the people goo. And tell
Pharao, thus says the Lord: Israel is mine eldest son, and therefore says
unto the: let my son goo, that he may serve me. If thou will not let hi^ goo:
behold, I will slay thine eldest son.

And it chanced by the way in the ynne, that the Lord met him and would
have killed him. Than Zepora took a stone and circumcised her son and fell at
his fette, and said: a bloody husband art thou unto me. And he let him goo.
She said a bloody husbonde, because of the circumcision.

Than said the Lord unto Aaron: go mete Moses in the wilderness. And he went
and met him in the mount of God and kissed hi And Moses told Aaron all the
words of the Lord which he had sent by him, and all the tokens which he had
charged him with all. So went Moses and Aaron and gatherd all the elders of the
childern of Israel. And Aaron told all the words which the Lord had spoken
unto Moses, and did the miracles in the sight of the people, and the people
believed. And when they herd that the Lord had visited the children of Israel
and had looked upon their tribulacion, they bowed them selves and worshipped

The.v. Chapter.
THen Moses and Aaron went and told Pharao, thus says the Lord God of Israel.
Let my people goo, that they may keep holy day unto me in the wilderness.
And Pharao answered: what fellow is the Lord, that I should hear his voice for
to let Israel goo? I know not the Lord, nether will let Israel goo.

And they said: the God of the Ebrues has met with us: let us goo (we pray
the) iij. days journey in to the deserte, that we may sacrifice unto the
Lord our God: lest he smite us either with pestilence or with sword. Then
said the king of Egipte unto them: wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the
people from their work, get you unto your labor. And Pharao said further
more: behold, there is much people in the land, and ye make them play and
let their work stand.

And Pharao commanded the same day unto the taskem asters over the people and
unto the officers saying: se that ye give the people no moare straw to make
brycke with all as ye did in time passed: let them goo and gather them straw
them selves, and the nombre of brick which they were wont to make in time
passed, lay unto their charges also, and minysh nothing thereof. For they be
ydill and therefore cry saying: let us goo and do sacrifice unto our God. They
must have more work laid upon them, that they may labor theryn, and than
will they not turn them selves to false words.

Than went the taskemasters of the people and the officers out and told the
people saying: thus says Pharao: I will give you no moare straw, but goo
your selves and gather you straw where ye can find it, yet shall none of
your labor be minyshed. Than the people scatered abroad through out all the
land of Egipte for to gather them stubyll to be in stead of straw.

And the taskemasters hastied the^ forward sayng: fulfill your work day by
day, eue^ as when straw was given you. And the officers of the childern of
Israel which Pharaos taskmasters had settouer them, were beaten. And it was
said unto them: wherefore have ye not fulfilled your tas^e in making brycke,
both yesterdaye and to day, as well as in times past.

Than went the officers of the childern of Israel and complained unto Pharao
saying: wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servauntes? there is no straw
given unto thy servauntes, and yet they say unto us: make brycke. And loo, thy
servauntes ar beaten, and thy people is foul entreated. And he answered: ydill
ar ye ydill and therefore ye say: let us goo and do sacrifice unto the Lord.
Goo therefore and work, for there shall no straw be given you, and yet see
that ye deliver the hole tale of brycke.

when the officers of the childern of Israel saw them silfe in shrode case (in
that he said ye shall minysh nothing of your dalye maki^ge of brycke) than
they met Moses and Aaron stondinge in there way as they came out from Pharao,
and said unto them: The Lord look unto you and judge, for ye have made the
sauoure of us stincke in the sight of Pharao and of his servauntes, and have
put a sword in to their hands to slay us.

Moses returned unto the Lord and said: Lord wherefore dealest thou cruelly
with this people: and wherefore have thou sent me? For sense I came to Pharao to
speak in thy name, he has fared foull with this folk, and yet thou have not
delivered thy people at all. Then the Lord said unto Moses: Now shall thou
see what I will do unto Pharao, for with a myghtie hand shall he let them
goo, and with a mighty hand shall he drive them out of his land.

The.vj. Chapter
ANd God spoke unto Moses sayng unto him: I am the Lord, and I appeared unto
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob an almighty God: but in my name Jehovah was I not
known unto them. Moreover I made an appointment with them to give them the
land of Canaa^: the land of their pilgremage wherein they were strangers. And
I have also herd the gronyng of the childern of Israel, because the Egiptians
keep them in bondage, and have remembered my promysse

wherefore say unto the childern of Israel: I A promise or a testament
am the Lord, and will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egiptians,
and will rydd you out of their bondage, and will deliver you with a stretched
out arm and with great judgments. And I will take you for my people and
will be to you a God. And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God which
bring you out from under the burdens of the Egiptians. And I will bring you
unto the land over the which I did lift up my hand to give it unto Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, and will give it unto you for a possessyon: eue^ Temptacy o^
^^ieth faith.
I the Lord, And Moses told the children of Israel even so: But they harkened
not unto Moses for anguyshe of sprete and for cruel bondage.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying Goo and bydd Pharao king of Egipte,
that he let the childern of Israel g^o out of his land. And Moses spoke before
the Lord saying: behold, the childern of Israel harken not unto me, how than
shall Pharao hear me: seeing that I have uncircumcised lips. And the Lord
spoke unto Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge unto the childern of Israel
and unto Pharao king of Egipte: to bring the childern of Israel out of the
land of Egipte.

These be the heedes of their fathers housses. The children of Ruben the eldest
son of Israel are these: Hanoh, Pallu, Hezron, Charmi, these be the
householders of Ruben. The childern of Symeon ar these: Gemuel, Iamin, Ohad,
Iachin. Zohar, and Saul the son of a Cananytesh wife: these are the kynreddes
of Symeon

These are the names of the children of Leui in their generations: Gerson,
Kahath and Merari. And Leui lived an hundred and.xxxvij. year. The sons of
Gerson: Libni and Semei in their kinreddes. The childern of Kahath: Amram,
Iesear, Hebron and Vsiel. And Kahath lived an hundred and.xxxiij. year. The
children of Merari are these: Mahely and Musi: these are the kynreddes of Leui
in their generations.

And Amram took Iochebed his nece to wife which bare him Aaron and Moses. And
Amram lived an hundred and.xxxvij. year. The childern of Iezear: Korah, Nepheg
and Sichri. The childern of Vsiel: Misael, Elzaphan and Sithri.

And Aaron took Elizaba daughter of Aminadab and sister of Nahason, to wife:
which bare him Nadab, Abehu, Eleazar and Ithamar. The childern of Korah: Assir,
Elkana and Abiassaph: these are the kynreddes of the Korahites. And Eleazar
Aarons son took him one of the daughters of Putuel to wife: which bare him
Pinchas: these be the principal fathers of the Levites in their kynreddes.

These are that Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said: carry the childern of
Israel out of the land of Egipte, with their armies. The se are that Moses and
Aaron which spoke to Pharao king of Egipte, that they might bri^ge the
childern of Israel out of Egipte. And in the day when the Lord spoke unto
Moses in the land of Egipte, he spoke unto him saying* I am the Lord, se that
thou speak unto Pharao the king of Egipte all that I say unto the. And Moses
answered before the Lord: I am of uncircumcised lips, how shall Pharao than
give me audience?

The.vij. Chaptre.
ANd the Lord said unto Moses: behold, I have made the Pharaos God, and
Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shall speak all that I command
the and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharao: that he send the childern
of Israel out of his land. But I will harden Pharaos heart, that I may
multiply my miracles and my wondres in the land of Egipte. And yet Pharao
shall not harken unto you, that I may set mine hand upon Egipte and bring
out mine armies, eue^ my people the childern of Israel out of the land of
Egipte, with great judgments. And the Egiptians shall know that I am the
Lord when I have stretched forth my hand upon Egipte, and have brought out
the childern of Israel from among the^.

Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them. And Moses was lxxx. year
old and Aaron.lxxxiij. when they spoke unto Pharao. And the Lord spoke unto
Moses and Aaron saying: when Pharao speaks un to you and says: show a
wondre, than shall thou say unto Aaron, take the rodd and cast it before
Pharao, and it shall turn to a serpent

Than went Moses and Aaron in unto Pharao, and did even as the Lord had
commanded. And Aaron cast forth his rodd before Pharao and before his
servauntes, and it turned to a serpente. Than Pharao called for the wise men
and enchaunters of Egipte did in En^ so d^ o^ re charmars now deceau^ all
princes with their sophistri^* and turn the^ clean from repe^tau^ce tovvarde
the law of god and from the faith that is in Christ.
like manner with there sorcery. And they cast down every man his rodd, and
they turned to serpe^tes: but Aarons rodd ate up their rods: and yet for all
that Pharaos heart was hardened, so that he herkened not unto the^, even as the
Lord had said.

Than said the Lord unto Moses. Pharaos heart is hardened, and he refuses to
let the people goo. Get the unto Pharao in the morning, for he will come unto
the water, and from de thou upon the ryuers brynke agenst he come, and the rodd
which turned to a serpente take in thine hand. And say unto him: the Lord
God of the Hebrews has sent me unto the saying: let my people goo, that they
may serve me in the wilderness: but hither to thou would not hear. wherefore
thus says the Lord: hereby thou shall know that I am the Lord. Behold, I
will smite with the staff that is in mine hand upon the waters that are in the
river, and they shall turn to blood. And the fish that is in the river shall
dye, and the river shall stink: so that it shall grieve the Egiptia^s to drink
of the water of the river.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses, say unto Aaron: take thy staff and stretch
out thine hand over the waters of Egipte, over their streams, ryuers, pondes
and all pooles off water, that they may be blood, and that there may be
blood in all the land of Egipte: both in vessels of wodd and also of stone.
And Moses and Aaron did even as the Lord commanded. And he lift up the
staff and smote the waters that were in the river, in the syghte of Pharao and
in the syghte of his servauntes, and all the water that was in the river,
turned in to blood. And the fish that was in the river dyed, and the river
stanke: so that the Egiptians could not drink of the water of the river. And
there was blood through out all the land of Egipte.

And the Enchaunters of Egipte did like wise with their enchauntmentes, so that
Pharaos heart was hardened and dydnot regard them as the Lord had said. And
Pharao turned himself and went in to his housse, and set not his heart there
unto. And the Egiptians dygged round about the river for water to drink, for
they could not drink of the water of the river. And it continued a weke after
that the Lord had smote the river.

The.viij. Chapter.
THe Lord spoke unto Moses: Goo unto Pharao and tell him, thus says the
Lord: let my people goo, that they may serve me. If thou will not let them
goo: behold I will smite all thy land with frogs. And the river shall
scrale with frogs, and they shall come up and goo in to thine housse and in
to thy chaumbre where thou slepest and upon thy bed, and in to the housses of
thy servauntes, and upon thy people, and in to thine ovens, and upon thy
vitels which thou have in store And the frogs shall come upon the and on thy
people and upon all thy servauntes.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses, say unto Aaron: stretche forth thine hand
with thy rodd over the stremes, rivers, and pondes. And bring up frogs upon
the land of Egipte And Aaron stretched his hand over the water of Egipte, and
the frogs came up and covered the land of Egipte. And the sorcerers did
likewise with their sorcery, and the frogs came up upon the land of Egipte.

Then Pharao called for Moses and Aaron and said, pray ye unto the Lord that
he may take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the
people goo, that they may sacrifice unto the Lord. And Moses said unto
Pharao: Appoynte thou the time unto me, when I shall pray for the and thy
servauntes and thy people, to drive away the frogs from the and thy housse,
so that they shall remain but in in the river only. And he said tomorow. And
he said: even as thou have said, that thou may know that there is none
like unto the Lord our God. And the frogs shall depart from the and from
thine houses and from thy servauntes and from thy people, and shall remain in
the river only.

And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharao, and Moses cried unto the Lord apo^
the apoyntment of frogs which he had made unto Pharao. And the Lord did
according to the saying of Moses. And the frogs dyed out of the housses,
courts and feldes. And they gathred them to gether upon heppes: so that the
land stanke of them.

But when Pharao saw that he had rest given him, he hardened his heart and
herkened not unto them, as the Lord had said. And the Lord said unto Moses:
Say unto Aaron stretch out thy rodd and smite the dust of the land that it
may turn to lyse in all the land of Egipte. And they did so. And Aaron
stretched out his hand with his rodd and smote the dust of the earth. and it
turned to lyse both in man and be, so that all the dust of the land turned
to lyse, through out all the land of Egipte.

And the enchaunters assayde likewise with their enchauntmentes to bring forth
lyse, but they could not. And the lyse were both upon man and be. Then said
the enchaunters unto Pharao: it is the fingre of God. Neuerthelater Pharaos
heart was hardened and he regarded them not, as the Lord had said.

And the Lord said unto Moses: rise up early in the morning and stand
before Pharao, for he will come unto the water: and say unto him, thus says
the Lord: let my people goo, that they may serve me. If thou will not let my
people goo: behold, I will send all manner flies both upon the and thy
servauntes and thy people and into thy housses. And the housses of the
Egiptians shall be full of flies, and the ground where on they are. But I will
separate the same day the land of Gosan where my people are, so that there
shall no flies be there: that thou may know that I am the Lord upon the
earth. And I will put a division between my people and thine. And even tomorow
shall this miracle be done.

And the Lord did even so: and there came noysom flies in to the housse of
Pharao, and in to his servauntes housses and in to all the lord of Egipte: so
that the land was marred with flies. Then Pharao sent for Moses and Aaron and
said: Goo and do sacrifice unto your God in the land. And Moses answered: it
is not mete so to do. for we must offer unto the Lord our God, that which is
an abhominatyon unto the Egiptians: behold, shall we sacrifice that which is
an abhominacion unto the Egiptians before their eyes, and shall they not stone
us? we will therefore goo.iij. days yournay in to the deserte and sacrifice
unto the Lord our God as he has commanded us.

And Pharao said: I will late you goo, that ye may sacrifice unto the Lord
your God in the wilderness: only goo not ferrre away, and se that ye pray for
me. And Moses said: behold, I will goo out from the and pray unto the Lord,
and the flies shall depart from Pharao and from his servauntes and from his
people tomorow. But let Pharao from hence forth desceaue no moare, that he
would not let the people goo to sacrifice unto the Lord.

And Moses went out from Pharao and prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord did as
Moses had said: and took away the flies from Pharao and from his servauntes
and from his people, so that there remained not one. But for all that, Pharao
hardened his heart even then also and would not let the people goo,

The.ix. Chaptre.
ANd the Lord said unto Moses, goo unto Pharao and tell him, thus says the
Lord God of the Ebrues: send out my people that they may serve me. If thou will not let them goo but wilt hold them still: behold, the hand of the
Lord shall be apo^ thy catell which thou have in the feld upon horses asses,
camels, oxen, and sheep, with a mighty great morrayne. But the Lord shall
make a deuysion between the beestes of the Israhelites, and the beestes of the
Egiptias: so that there shall nothing dye of all that perteyneth to the children
of Israel. And the Lord appointed a time saying: tomorow the Lord shall do
this thing in the land.

And the Lord did the thing on the morrow, and all the catell of Egipte dyed:
but of the catell of the children of Israel dyed not one. And Pharao sent to
wete: but there was not one of the catell of the Israhelites dead.
Notwithstondinge the heart of Pharao hardened, and he would not let the people
goo.

And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron: take your hands full of ashes out
of the furnace, and let Moses sprynkel it up in to the air in the syghte of
Pharao, and it shall turn to dust in all the land of Egipte, and shall make
swellynge soores with blaynes both on man and be in all the land of Egipte.
And they took ashes out of the furnace, and stood before Pharao, and Moses
sprynkeld it up in to the air: And there brake out soores with blaynes both in
man and be: so that the sorcerers could not stand before Moses, by the
reason of botches on the enchaunters and upon all the Egiptians, But the Lord
hardened the heart of Pharao, that he herkened not unto them, as the Lord had
said unto Moses.

And the Lord said unto Moses: rise up early in the morning and stand
before Pharao and tell him, thus says the Lord God of the Ebrues: Let my
people goo, that they may serve me, or else I will at this time send all my
plages upon thine heart and upon thy servauntes and on thy people, that thou
may know that there is none like me in all the earth. For now I will stretch
out my hand and will smite the and thy people with pestilence: so that thou
shall perisshe from the earth. Yet in very deed for this cause have I sterred
the up, for to show my power in the, and to declare my name through out all
the world.

If it be so that thou stoppest my people, that thou will not let them goo:
behold, tomorow this time I will send down a mighty great hayle: eue^ soch
one as was not in Egipte sense it was grounded unto this time. Send therefore
and fet home thy beestes and all that thou have in the field, For upon all the
men and beestes which are found in the field and not brought home, shall the
hayle fall, and they shall dye And as many as feared the word of the Lord
among the servauntes of Pharao made the ir servauntes and their beestes flee to
house: and they that regarded not the word of the Lord, left their servauntes
and their beestes in the field.

And the Lord said unto Moses: stretche forth thine hand unto heaven, that
there may be hayle in all the land of Egipte: apo^ man and be, and apo^ all
the herbs of the field in the feld of Egipte. And Moses stretched out his rodd
unto heaven, and the Lord thondered and hayled so that the fire ran a long
upon the ground. And the Lord so hayled in the lord of Egipte, that there
was hayle and fire me^gled with the hayle, so grievous, that there was none soch
in all the land of Egipte, sense people inhabited it.

And the hayle smote in the land of Egipte all that was in the field: both man
and be And the hayle smote all the herbs of the feld and broke all the
trees of the field: only in the land of Gosan where the children of israel
were, was there no hayle. And Pharao sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and
said unto the^: I have now sinned, the Lord is rightwes and I and my people
are weked. Pray ye unto the Lord, that the thonder of God and hayle may
cease, and I will let you goo, and ye shall tarry no longer.

And Moses said unto him: as soon as I am out of the city, I will sprede
abroad my hands unto the Lord, and the thunder shall cease, nether shall
there be any moare hayle: that thou may know, how that the earth is the
Lords, But I know that thou and thy servauntes yet fear not the Lord God.
The flax and the barley were smytte^, for the barley was shot up and the flax
was boulled: but the where and the rye were not smeten, for they were late
sown.

And Moses went out of the city from Pharao and sprede abroad his hands unto
the Lord, and the thunder and hayle ceased, nether rayned it any moare upon
the earth. when Pharao saw that the rain and the hayle and thunder were
ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart: both he and his servauntes So
was the heart of Pharao hardened, that he would not let the children of Israel
goo, as the Lord had said by Moses.

The.x. Chapter.
THe Lord said unto Moses: goo unto Pharao, nevertheless I have hardened his
heart and the hertes of his servauntes, that I might show these my signs
amongst the^ and that thou tell in the audience of thy son and of thy sons
son, the pagiantes which I have played in Egipte and the miracles which I
have done among them: that ye may know how that I am the Lord.

Than Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao and said unto him: thus says the
Lord God of the Hebrews: how long shall it be, or thou will submyt thy self
unto me? Let my people goo that they may serve me. If thou will not let my
people goo: behold, tomorow will I bring greshoppers in to thy land, and
they shall cover the face of the earth that it can not be seen, and they shall
eat the residue which remains unto you and escaped the hayle and they shall
eat all your grene trees upon the field, and they shall fill thy housses and
all thy servauntes housses, and the housses of all the Egiptia^s after soch a
manner: as nether thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen, sense the time
they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned him silfe about, and
went out from Pharao.

And Pharaos servauntes said unto him: How long shall this fellow thus plage
us? Let the men goo that they may serve the Lord their God, or else will thou
see Egipte first destroyed? And than Moses and Aaron were brought again unto
Pharao, and he said unto them: Goo and serve the Lord your God but who are
they that shall goo? And Moses answered: we must goo with young and old: ye
and with our sons and with our daughters, and with our sheep and oxe^ must
we goo For we must hold a feast unto the Lord.

And he said unto them: shall it be so? The Lord be with you, should I let
you goo, and your children also? Take heed, for ye have so me myschefe in
hand. Nay not so: but goo ye that are men and serve the Lord, for that was
your desire. And they thrust the^ out of Pharaos presence.

And the Lord said unto Moses: Stretch out thine hand over the land of
Egipte for greshoppers, that they come upon the land of Egipte and eat all
the herbs of the land, and all that the hayle left untouched. And Moses
stretched forth his rodd over the land off Egipte, and the Lord brought an
east wind upon the land, all that day and all night. And in the morning
the east wind brought the greshoppers, and the greshoppers went up over all
the land of Egipte and lighted in all quarters off Egipte very grievously: so
that before them were there no soch greshoppers, nether after them shall be. And
they covered all the face of the earth, so that the land was dark therewith.
And they ate all the herbs of the land and all the fruits of the trees which
the hayle had left: so that there was no grene thing left in the trees and
herbs of the field through all the land of Egipte.

Then Pharao called for Moses and Aaron in haste and said: I have sinned
against the Lord your God and against you. Forgive me yet my sin only this
once, and pray unto the Lord your God that he may take away from me this
death only. And he went out from Pharao and prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord
turned the wind in to a myghtie strong west wind, and it took away the
greshoppers and cast the^ in to the reed see: so that there was not one
greshopper left in all the costs of Egipte But the Lord hardened Pharaos
heart, ^o that he would not let the childern off Israel goo

And the Lord said unto Moses: Stretch out thy hond unto heaven and let there
be darcknesse upon the land of Egipte: eue^ that they may feale the
darcknesse. And Moses stretched forth his hand unto heaven, and there was a
dark mist upon all the land off Egipte. iij days long so that no man saw
another nether rose up from the place where he was by the space of.iij. days,
but all the children of Israel had light where they dwelled.

Then Pharao called for Moses and said: goo and serve the Lord, only let
your sheep. and your oxen abide, but let your childern go with you. And
Moses answered: thou must give us also offringes and burntoffringes for to
sacrifice unto the Lord our God, Our ca tell therefore shall goo with us, and
there shall not one hoos^e be left behind, for thereof must we take to serve
the Lord our God. Moreover we cannot know wherewith we shall serve the Lord,
until we come thither.

But the Lord hardened Pharaos heart, so that he would not let the^ goo. And
Pharao said unto him: get the from me and take head to thy self that thou
see my face no moare, For when soever thou come in my syghte, thou shall dye.
And Moses said: let it be as thou have said: I will see thy face no moare.

The.xj. Chapter.
ANd the Lord said unto Moses: yet will I bring one plage moare upon Pharao
and upon Egipte, and after that he will let you goo hence. And when he
lets you goo, he shall utterly drive you hence. But bid the people that
every man borowe of his neghbour and every woman of her neghbouresse: ie wels
off silver and i^wels of gold. And the Lord gatt the people favor in the
syghte of the Egiptians. Moreover Moses was very great in the land of Egipte:
both in the syghte of Pharao, and also in the syghte of the people.

And Moses said: thus says the Lord. About mydnyghte will I goo out among
the Egiptians, and all the firstborne in the land of Egipte shall dye: even
from the firstborne off Pharao that sits on his seat, unto the firstborne
of the maydeservaunte that is in the mylle, and all the firstborne of the
catell. And there shall be a great cry through out all the land off Egipte: so
that there was never none like nor shall be. And among all the childern of
Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, nor yet man or be: that ye may
know, how the Lord puts a difference between the Egiptia^s and Israel. And
all these thy servauntes shall come down unto me, and fall before me and say
get the out and all the people that are under the, and than will I depart. And
he went out from Pharao in a great anger.

And the Lord said unto Moses: Pharao shall not regard you, that many
wondres may be wrought in the land of Egipte, And Moses and Aaron did all
these wondres before Pharao But the Lord hardened Pharaos heart, so that he
would not let the childern of Israel goo out of his land.

The.xij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egipte saying: This
month shall be your chief month: eue^ the first month of the year shall it
be unto you Speak ye unto all the felowshipe of Israel saying: that they take
the.x. day of this month That I here call ashepe is in Ebrue a word
indifferent to a sheep and a go^^e both.
to every household, a sheep. If the household be to few for a sheep, then let
him and his neghbour that is next unto his house, take acordinge to the nombre
of soulles, and count unto a sheep acordinge to every man's eatinge A sheep
with out spott and a male of one year old shall it be, and from among the
lambs and the gootes shall ye take it.

And ye shall keep him in ward, until the xiiij. day of the same month. And
every man of the multitude of Israel shall kill him about eue^. And they shall
take of the blood and strike it on the.ij. side posts and on the upper dor
post of the houses, wheri^ they eat hi^. And they shall eat the flesh the
same night, roast with fire, and with vnleue^ded bread, and with sour her bes
they shall eat it. S^ that ye eat not thereof sode^ in water, but roast with
fire: both head fete and purtenance together. And se that ye let nothing of it
remain unto the morning: if ought remain burn it with fire.

Off this manner shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, and shoes on your
fete, and your staves in your hands. And ye shall eat i^ in haste, The
la^be was ^alled (...). (...) ^^*a^ the very ^am^ ^^ self (...) ^d put the in
remembrance vvh^^ ^^ signified. f^^ the signs that god ordin^d (...)
signified the benefits done, or promyses to come and vv^re not do me as are
the signs of our dom^^e* God the Pope.
for it is the Lords * passover, for I will go about i^ the land of Egipte
this same night, and will smite all the firstborne in the land off Egipte:
both of man and d^^st, and apo^ all the gods off Egipte will I the Lord do
execution. And the blood shall be unto you a toke^ upon the houses where in
ye are, for when I se the blood, I will pass over you, and the plage shall
not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land off Egipte.

And this day shall be unto you a remembrance, and ye shall keep it holy
unto the Lord even through out your generacions after you shall ye keep it
holy day, that it be a custom for ever.vij. days shall ye eat vnleve^ded
breed, so that even the first day ye shall put away leven out off your
housses. For whosoever eats leuended bread from the first day until
the.vij. day, that soul shall* be plucked out from Israel. The first day
shall be a holy feast unto you, and the. vij* also. There shall be no manner off
work done in the^, save about that only which every man must eat that only
may ye do. And see that ye keep you to vnleue^ded breed.

For upon that same day I will bring your armies out off the land of
Egipte, therefore ye shall observe this day and all your childern after you,
that yt be a custume for ever. The first month and the.xiiij. day off the
month at even, ye shall eat sweet bread unto the.xxj. day off the month at
even again. Seven days se that there be no leuended bred found in your
housses. For whosoever eats leuended bred, that soul shall be roted out from
the multitude of Israel: whether he be a stranger or borne in the land.
Therefore se that ye eat no leuended bred, but in all your habitacions eat
sweet bred.

And Moses called for the elders off Israel and said unto them: chouse our and
take to every household a sheep, and kill passover. And take a bunch of ysope,
and dip it in the blood that is in the basyn, and stryke it upon the up
perposte and on the.ij. side posts, and se that none of you goo out at the
door of his house until the morning. For the Lord will goo about and smite
Egipte. And when he seyth the blood upon the upper doorposte and on the.ij.
side posts, he will pass over the door and will not su^^re the destroyer to
come into your housse to plage you. Therefore se that thou observe this thing,
that it be an ordinance to the, and thy sons for over.

And when ye be come into the land which the Lord will give you acordinge as
he has Our signs be do^me, we know not the reason of our baptim* ye and
we must say our prayers and our belesse in a to^ gevve vnder^^onde not. And
yet if we answer not our prelates when they be angry, even as they would
have it, we must to the fire with out redemption, or forsvver god
promised, se that ye keep this service. * And when your childern axe you what
manner off service is this ye do. Ye shall say* it is the sacrifice of the
Lords passover which passed over the housses of the childern of Israel in
Egipte, as he smote the Egiptians and saved our housses. Than the people bowed
them selves and worshipped. And the childern of Israel went and did as the
Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.

And at mydnyghte the Lord smote all the firstborne in the lord of Egipte:
from the firstborne of Pharao that satt on his seat, unto the firstborne of the
captyue that was in presone, and all firstborne of the catell. Than Pharao
arose the same night and al his servauntes and all the Egiptians, and there
was a great crieng through out Egipte, for there was no housse where there was
not one dead.

And he called unto Moses and Aaron by night saying: Rise up and get you out
from among my people: both ye and also the children of Israel, and goo and
serve the Lord as ye have said. And take your sheep and your oxen with you
as ye have said, and depart and bless me also. And the Egiptians were ferce
upon the people and made haste to send the^ out of the la^d: for they said:
we be al deed me^ And the people took the dowe before it was sowered which they
had in stoare, and bound it in clothes and put it upon their shulders And the
childern of Israel did acordinge to the saying of Moses: and they borrowed of
the Egiptians: jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. And the Lord
gat the people favor in the syghte of the Egiptians: and so they borrowed and
robbed the Egiptians.

Thus took the childern of Israel their your ney from Raemses to suchoth.vj.
hundred thou sand me^ of foot, beside childern. And much common people went
also with the^, and sheep and oxen and catell exceadinge much. And they baked
sweet cakes of the dowe which thy brought out of Egipte, for it was not
sowered: because they were thrust out of Egipte and could not tarry, nether had
they prepared them any other provision of meat.

And the time of the dwellinge of the childern of Israel which they dwelled in
Egipte, was.iiij. hundred and.xxx. year. And when the iiij. hundred and.xxx.
years were expyred, eue^ the self same day departed all the hosts of the
Lord out of the land of Egipte. This is a night to be observed to the Lord,
because he brought them out of the land of Egipte. This is a night of the
Lord, to be kept of all the childern of Israel and of their generacions after
them.

And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, this is the manner of Passover:
there shall no stranger eat there of, but all the servants that are bought
for money shall ye circumcise, and then let them eat there of. A stranger and
a hyerd servant shall not eat thereof. In one housse shall it be eaten. Ye
shall carry none of the flesh out at the doors: moreover, se that ye break not
a bone there of. All the multirude of the childern of Israel shall observe it

If a stranger dwell among you ad will hold Passover unto the Lord, let
him circu^cise all that be males, and the^ let him come and observe it and be
taken as one that is borne i^ the lord. No uncircumcised person shall eat
there of. One manner of law shall be unto the^ that are borne in the lord, and
unto the strangers that dwell among you And all the childern of Israel did as
the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron. And eue^ the self same day did the
Lord bring the childern of Israel out of the land of Egipte with their
armies.

The.xiij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: sanctify unto me all the firstborne
that open all manner matrices among the childern of Israel, as well of me^ as
of beestes: for they are mine. And Moses said unto the people: think on this
day i^ which ye came out of Egipte and out of the housse of bondage: for with
a myghtie hand the Lord brought you out from thence. Se therefore that ye
eat no leven ded bred. This day come ye out of Egipte in the month of Abib.

when the Lord has brought the i^ to the lord of the Canaanites, Hethites,
Amorites, Heuites and iebusites, which he swear unto thy fathers that he would
give the: a land where in milk and honye flows, the^ se that thou keep this
servyce in this same month. Seven days thou shall eat sweet bred, and
the.vij. day shall be fe^^^tfull unto the Lord. Therefore thou shall eat sweet
bred.vij. days, and se that there be no leuended bred seen nor yet leue^
among you in all your quarters.

And thou shall show thy son at that time The fathers now a days may not
be s^fied to know ought of God them selves, how can they then teach their
childern what the ceremony means.
saying: this is done, because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came
out of Egipte. Therefore it shall be a sign unto the upon thine hand and a
remembrance between thine eyes, that the Lords law may be in thy mouth. For
with a strong hand the Lord brought the out of Egipte, se thou keep
therefore this ordinance in his season from year to year.

Moreover when the Lord has brought the in to the land of the Canaanytes,
as he has sworn unto the and to thy fathers, and has given it the, the^ thou
shall appoynte unto the Lord all that opens the matrice, and all the
firstborne among the beestes which thou have if they be males. And all the
firstborne of the asses, thou shall redeem with a sheep: if thou redeem him
not, then break his neck. But all the firstborne among thy childern shall
thou bye out.

And when thy son axeth the in time to come Teach your chyldern.
saying: what is this? thou shall say unto him: with a mighty hand the Lord
brought us out of Egipte, out of the housse of bondage. And when Pharao was
looth to let us goo, the Lord slew all the firstborne in the land of
Egipte: as well the firstborne of men as of beasts. And therefore I sacrifice
unto the Lord all the males that open the matrice, but all the firstborne of
my childern I must redeem. And this shall be as a token in thine hand, and as
a thing hanged up between thine eyes: because the Lord brought us out of
Egipte with a mighty hand.

when Pharao had let the people goo, God carried them not through the land of
the Philistines, though it were a nigh way. For God said: the people might
happly repent when they se war, and so turn again to Egipte: therefore God
led the^ about through the wilderness that bordreth on the redd see. The
childern of Israel went harnessed out of the land of Egipte. And Moses took
the bones of Joseph with him: for he made the childern of Israel swear saying:
God will surely vyset you, take my bones therefore away hence with you,

And they took their journey from Suchoth: and pitched their tents in Etham in
the edge of the wilderness. And the Lord went before them by day in a piler
of a cloud to lead them the way: and by night in a piler of fire to give
the^ light. that they might goo both by day a^dnyghte. And the piler of the
cloud never departed by day nor the piler of fire by night out of the
peoples sight.

The.xiiij. Chapter.
THan the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: bid the childern of Israel that they
turn and pytch their tents before the entering of Hiroth between Migdole and
the s^ toward Baal zephon: even before that shall ye pytch upon the sea. For
Pharao will say of the childern of Israel: they are ta^gled in the lo^d the
wilderness has shot the^ in. And I will harde^ his heart, that he shall
follow after the^, that I may get me honor upon Pharao and upon all his
host. that the Egiptians may know that I am the Lord. And they did even so.

And when it was told the king of Egipte that the people fled, tha^ Pharaos
heart and all his servants turned unto the people and. said why have we this
done, that we have let Israel go out of our service? and he made ready his
charettes and took his people with him and took vi. hundred chosen charettes
and all the charettes of Egipte and captains upon all his people. For the
Lord hardened the heart of Pharao king of Egipte that he followed after the
childern of Israel which for all that went out through an hye hand, And the
Egiptia^s followed after the^ and ouertoke the^ where they pitched by the sea,
with all the horses and charettes of Pharao and with his horsseme^ and his
host: eue^ fast by the entering of Hiroth before Baal Zephon. And Pharao
drewenye, and when the childern of Isreal lift up their eyes and saw how the
Egiptia^s followed after the^, they were sore a fraide and cried out unto the
Lord

Tha^ said they unto Moses? were there no *
graves for us in Egipte, but thou must bring us away for to dye in the
wilderness? wherefore have thou served us thus, for to carry us out of Egipte?
Did not we tell the this in Egipte saying, let us be in rest and serve the
Egiptians? For it had been better for us to have served the Egiptians, than for
to dye in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people: fear ye not but
stand still and behold how the Lord shall save you this day: For as ye se
the Egiptians this day, shall ye see them no more for ever till the worlds
end. The Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace.

The Lord said unto Moses: wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the
childern of Israel that they goo forward. But lift thou up thy rodd and
stretch out thy hand over the sea and deuyde it a sondre, that the childern of
Israel may goo on dry ground through the myddest thereof. And behold I will
harden the hertes of the Egiptians that they may follow you. And I will get
me honor upon Pharao and upon all his host, upon his charettes and upon his
horse me^. And the Egiptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten
me honor upon Pharao upon his charettes and upon his horsemen.

And the angel of God which went before the host of Israel, removed and went
behind them. And the cloude^piler that was before them removed and stood
behind them and went between the host of the Egiptians and the host of
Israel. Yt was a dark cloud, and gave light by night: so that all the
night long the one could not come at the other.

when now Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, the Lord carried away
the sea with a strong east wind that blewe all night, and made the sea dry
land and the water divided it silfe. And the childern of Israel went in through
the myddest of the sea upon the dry ground. And the water was a wall unto
them, both on their righthande and on the ir left hand. And the Egiptians
followed and went in after them to the myddest of the sea, with all Pharaos
horses, and his charettes and his horssemen.

And in the morning watch, the Lord looked unto the host of the Egiptia^s out
of the fyery and clowdie piler, and troubled their host and smote of their
charett wheles and cast them down to the ground. Than said the Egiptians:
Let us fle from Israel, for the Lord fyghteth for them against us. Than said
the Lord unto Moses: stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the water may
come again upon the Egiptians upon their charettes and horsemen.

Than stretched forth Moses his hand over the sea, and it came again to his
course erly i^ the morni^g, and the Egiptia^s fledd against it. Thus the Lord
ouerthrewe the Egiptians in the midst of the sea, and the water returned and
covered the charettes and the houseme^: so that of all the host of Pharao that
came in to the sea after them, there remained not one. But the children of
Israel went upon dry lord in the myddest of the sea, and the water was a
wall unto them: both on the right hand of them and also on the lift.

Thus the Lord delivered Israel the self same day out of the hand of the
Egiptians, and Israel saw the Egiptians dead upon the sea side. And when
Israel saw that mighty hand which the Lord had showed upon the Egiptians,
they feared the Lord: and believed both the Lord and also his servaunte Moses

The.xv. Chapter.
THen Moses and the childern off Israel sange this song unto the Lord and said

Moses brought Israel from the redd see, and they went out in to the
wilderness of Sur.

And they went three days long in the wilderness and could find no water. At
the last they came to Mara: but they could not drink off the waters for
bitterness, for they were better* therefore the name of the place was called
Mara. Then the people murmured against Moses saying* what shall we drink? And
Moses cried unto the Lord and he showed him a tree* and he cast it in to the
water, and they waxed sweet.

There he made them an ordinance and a law, and there he tempted them and
said: If ye will harken unto the voice of the Lord your We must do that

The.xvj. Chapter.
ANd they came to Elim where were. xij wells of water and.lxx. date trees, and
they pitched there by the water. And they took their yourney from Elim, and all
the hole company of the childern of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin,
which lies between Elim and Sinai: the.xv. day of the second month after
that they were come out of the land of Egipte. And the hole multitude of the
childern *
of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and said unto
them: would to God we had dyed by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egipte,
when we satt by the flessh pottes and ate bred our belies full for ye have
brought us out in to this wilderness to kill this hole multitude for honger.

Than said the Lord unto Moses: behold, I will rain bred from heaven down
to you, and let the people goo out and gather day by day, that I may prove
the^ whether they will walk in my law or no. The.vj. day let the^ prepare
that which they will bri^ge in, and let it be twice as much as they gather in
daily. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the childere^ of Israel: at even he
shall know that it is the Lord, which brought you out of the land of Egipte
and in the morning ye shall se the glory of the Lord: because he has herd
your grudgynges against the Lord: for what are we that ye should murmr
against us. And moreover spoke Moses. At eue^ the Lord will give you flesh to
eat and in the morning bred enough* because the Lord has herd your murmur
which ye murmur against hi^: for what ar we? your murmuring is not against
us, but against the Lord.

And Moses spoke unto Aaron: Say unto all the company of the childere^ of
Israel, come forth before the Lord, for he has herd your grudgi^ges. And as
Aaron spoke unto the hole multitude of the childere^ of Israel, they looked
toward the wilderness. and behold, the glory of the Lord apeared i^ a
cloud. And the Lord spoke unto Moses sayng: I have herd the murm^ri^g of the
children of Israel, tell the^ therefore and say that at eue^ they shall eat
flesh, a^di the morninge they shall be filled with bred, and ye shall know
that I am the Lord your god

And at eue^ the quayles came and covered the ground where they lay. And in
the morning the dew lay round about the host. And when the dew was
fallen: behold, it lay apo^ the ground in the wilderness, small and round
and thyn as the hoar frost on the ground. when the children of Israel saw it,
they said one to another: what is this? for they wist not what it was And
Moses said: this is the breed which the Lord has given you to eat. This is
the thing which the Lord has commanded, that ye gather every man enough for
hi^ to eat: a gomer full for a man acordi^ge to the no^bre off you, and gather
every man for the^ which are in his tente.

And the childern of Israel did even so, and gathered some more some less, and
did mete it with a gomer. And unto him that had gathered much remained nothing
over, and unto hi^ that had gathered little was there no lack: but every man
had gathered sufficient for his eatinge. And Moses said unto them. Se that no
man let ought remain of it till the morninge. Notwithstondinge they harkened
not unto Moses: but some of the^ left of it until the morning, and it waxte
full of worms and st^ke and Moses was angry with them.

And they gathered it all morni^ges: every man as much as suffised for his
eatinge, for as soon as the hete of the son came it moulte. And the.vj. day
they gathered twice so much bred: ij. gomers for one man, and the ruelars of
the multitude came and told Moses. And he said unto the^, this is that which
the Lord has said tomorow is the Sabbath of the holy rest of the Lord: bake
that which ye will bake and seth that ye will seth, and that which remains
say up for you and keep it till the morning. And they laid it up till the
morning as Moses bad ^^ it sta^ke not nether was there any worms th^^ And
Moses said: that eat this day: for to ^^ ye it is the Lords Sabbath: to
day ye sh^^ ^^ de none in the feld, Sixte days ye shall gather it, for the,
vij. is the sabbath: there shall be none there in.

Notwithstondinge there went out of the people in the seventh day for to
gather: but they found none. The^ the Lord seyde unto Moses: how long shall
it be, yer ye will keep my co^maundme^tes and laws? Se because the Lord has
given you a Sabbath, therefore he gives you the.vj. day bred for.ij. days.
Bide therefore every man athome, and let no man go out of his place the seventh
day. And the people rested the seventh day. And the housse of Israel called
it Man, And it was like unto Coriander seed and white, and the taste of it was
like unto wafers made with honye.

And Moses said: this is that which the Relics ought to be but a
remembrance only.
Lord commands: fill a Gomor of it, that it may be kept for your
childern after you: that they may se the bred wherewith he fedd you in
wilderness, when he had brought you out of the land of Egipte. And Moses
spoke unto Aaron: take a cruse and put a Gomer ^ull of man therein, and lay it
up before the Lord to be kept for your childern after you as the Lord
commanded Moses. And Aaron laid it up before the testimonye there to be
kept.

And the childern of Israel ate man.xl. year until they came unto a land
inhahited. And so they ate Man, even until they came unto the bordres of the
land of Canaan, And a Gomer is the tenth part of an Epha.

The.xvij. Chapter.
ANd all the company of the childern of Israel went on their iourneys from the
wilderness of Sin at the commaundment of the Lord, and pitched in Raphidim:
where was no water for the people to drink. And the people chode with Moses
and said: give us water to drink. And Moses said unto *
them: why chyde ye with me, and wherefore do ye tempte the Lord? There the
people thyrsted *
for water, and murmured agenst Moses and said: wherefore have thou brought us
out of Egipte, to kill us and our childern and our catell with thyrste?

And Moses cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people? they be
al most redye to stone me. And the Lord said unto Moses: goo before the
people, and take with the of the elders of Israel: and thy rod wherewith thou
smotest the river, take in thine hand and goo. Behold, I will stand there
before the upon a rock in Horeb: and thou shall smite the rock, and there
shall come water out there of, that the people may drink. And Moses did even
so before the elders of Israel And he called the name of the place: Massa and
Meriba: because of the chiding of the childern of Israel, and because they
tempted the Lord saying: is the Lord among us or not?

Then came Amalech and fought with Israel in Raphidim. And Moses said unto
Joshua: chose out men and goo fight with Amelech Tomorow I will stand on the
top of the hill and the rodd of God in mine hand. And Joshua did as Moses
bade him, and fought with the Amalechites. And Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to
the top of the hill. And when Moses held up his hand, Israel had the
better. And when he late his hand down, Amelech had the better.

when Moses hands were weery, they took a stone and put it under him, and he
satt down there on. And Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands the one on the one
side and the other on the other side. And his hands were stedie until the
son was down. And Joshua discomfeted Amalech and his people with the edge of
his sword.

And the Lord said unto Moses: write this for a remembrance in a book and
tell it unto Joshua, for I will put out the remembrance of Amalech from under
heaven. And Moses made an alter and called the name of it *Jehovah Nissi, for
he said: the hand is on Jehovah nissi the Lord is he that exalte^^ me.

The.xviij. Chapter.
IEthro the pressed of Madian Moses father in law herd of all that God had done
unto Moses and to Israel his people, how that the Lord had brought Israel out
of Egipte. And he took Ziphora Moses wife, after she was sent back, and
her.ij. sons, of which the one was called Gerson, for he said: I have been
an alient in a strange land. And the other was called Eliesar: for the God of
my father was mine help and delivered me from the sword of Pharao.

And Iethro Moses father in law came with his two sons and his wife unto
Moses in to the wilderness: where he had pitched his tente by the mount of
God. And he sent word to Moses: I thy father in law Iethro am come to the, and
thy wife also, and her two sons with her. And Moses went out to mete his
father in law and did obeyssaunce and kyssed him, and they saluted etch other
and came in to the tente.

And Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharao and
to the Egiptians for Isreal's sake, and all the travail that had happened them
by the way, and how the Lord had delivered them. And Iethro reioesed over all
the good which the Lord had done to Israel, and because he had delivered them
out of the hand of the Egiptians. And Iethro said: blessed be the Lord which
has delivered you out of the hand of the Egiptians and out of the hand of
Pharao, which has delivered his people from under the power of the Egiptians.
Now I know that the Lord is greater the^ all gods, for because that they
dealte prowdly with them. And Iethro Moses father in law offered burntoffrynges
and sacrifyces unto God. And Aaron and all the elder^ of Israel came to eat
bred with Moses father in law before God.

And it chaunched on the morrow, that Moses satt to judge the people, and the
people stood about Moses from morning unto even. when his father in law saw
all that he did unto the people, he said: what is this that thou do unto
the people? why syttest thou thy self and let all the people stand about
the from morning unto even? And Moses said unto his father in law: because
the people came unto me to seek council of God. For when they have a matter,
they come unto me, and I must judge between every man and his neyboure, and
must show them the ordinances of God and his laws.

And his father in law said unto him: it is not well that thou do. Thou
do unwisely and also this people that is with the: because the thing is to
greuons for the, and thou art not able to do it thy self alone. But hear my
royce, and I will give the council, and God shall be with the. Be thou unto the
people to Godwarde, and bring the causes unto God and provide them ordinances
and laws, ^d show them the way wherein they must walk and the works that
they must do.

thy self, and let them bear with the. If thou shall do this thing, then thou
shall be able to endure that which God charge the with all, and all this
people shall goo to their places quietly.

And Moses herd the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had
said, and chose actyue men out of all Israel and made them heedes over the
people, captains over thousands, over hundreds, over fifty and over ten And
they judged the people at all seasons, and brought the hard causes unto
Moses: and judged all small matters them selves. And the Moses let his father in
law depart, and he went in to his own land.

The.xix. Chapter.
THe third month after the childern of Israel were gone out of Egipte: the
same day they came in to the wilderness of Sinai. For they were departed from
Raph^ dim, and were come to the deserte of Sinay and had pitched their tents
in the wilderness. And there Israel pitched before the mount. And Moses went
up unto God.

And the Lord called to him out of the mountain saying: thus say unto the
housse of lacob and tell the childern of Israel, ye have seen what I did unto
the Egiptians and how I took you up upon Egles wings, and have brought you
unto my self. Now therefore if ye will hear my voice and keep mine
appointment: ye shall be mine own above all nations, for all the earth is mine.
Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of preastes and and holy people: these are the
words which thou shall say unto the childern of Israel.

And Moses came and called for the elders of Ifrael, and laid before them all
these words which the Lord had comma unded him. And the people answered all
together and said: All that the Lord has said, we will do. And Moses
brought the words of the people unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto
Moses: Loo, I will come unto the in a thick cloud, that the people may hear
when I talk with the and also believe the for ever. And Moses showed the words
of the people unto the Lord

And the Lord said unto Moses: Go unto the people and sanctific them to day
and tomorow, and let them wash their clothes: that they may be ready against
the third day. For the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of
all the people upon mount Sinai. And set marks round about the people and
say: beware that ye go not up in to the mount and that ye twych not the
bordres of it. for whosoever twicheth the mount, shall surely dye There shall
not an hand twych it, but that he shall either be stoned or else shot through:
whether it be be or man, it shall nor live. when the horn blows: than let
the^ come up in to the mounten

And Moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified them, and
they washed their clothes: And he said unto the people be ready agenst the
third day, and se that ye come not at your wives. And the third day in the
morning there was thunder, and lightenynge and a thick cloud apo^ the
mount, and the voice of the horn waxed ^^ceadynge loud, and all the people
that was in the host was afraid. And Moses brought the people out of the
te^tes to mete with God. and they stood under the hill.

And mount Sinai was all together on a smoke: because the Lord descended
down upon it in fire. And the smoke thereof ascended up, as it had been the
smoke of a kylle, and all the mount was exceadinge fearful. And the voice of
the horn blewe and waxed louder, and louder. Moses spoke, and God answered hi^
and that with a voice. And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai: even in the
top of the hill, and called Moses up in to the top of the hill. And Moses
went up.

And the Lord said unto Moses: go down and charge the people that they
prease not up unto the Lord for to se hi^, and so many off the^ perissn. And
let the preastes also which come to the Lords presence, sanctify them selves:
lest the Lord smite them, Then Moses said unto the Lord: the people cannot
come up in to mount Sinai, for thou chargedestrs saying: set marks about
the hill and sanctify it.

And the Lord said unto him: away, and get the down: and come up both thou
and Aaron with the. But let not the preastes and the people presume for to come
up unto the Lord: lest he smite them. And Moses went down unto the people and
told them.

Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will

when the people saw it, they removed and stood a far of and said unto
Moses: talk thou with us and wewil hear: but let not god talk with us, lest
we dye. And Moses said unto the people fear not, for God is come to prove
you, and that his fear may be among you that ye sin not.

And the people stood a far of, and Moses went in to the thick cloud where
God was And the Lord said unto Moses: thus thou shall say unto the childern
of Israel: Ye have seen how that I have talked with you from out of heaven. Ye
shall not make therefore with me gods of silver nor gods of gold: in no wise
shall ye do it. An alter of earth thou shall make unto me and there on offer thy

light and perfectness: that they be eue^ upon Aaro^s heart when he goes i^
before the Lord and Aaron shall bear the ensample of the children of Israel
upon his heart before the Lord alwaie

And thou shall make the tunycle unto the Ephod, all to gether of Iacyncte. And
there shall be an hole for the heed in the mids of it, and let there be a bond
of wouen work round about the color of it: as it were the color of a
partlet, that it rent not. And beneth upon the hem, thou shall make
pomgra^^tes of Iacyncte, of scarlet, and of purpull round about the hem, and
belles of gold between them round about: that there be euera golden bell and
a pomgranate, a goldem bell and a pomgranate round about upon the hem of the
tunicle. And Aaron shall have it upon him when he minystreth* that the sound
may be herd when he goes in in to the holy place before the Lord and when
he comes out, that he dye not.

And thou shall make a place of pure gold, and grave there on (as signettes
are graven) That he calls the holiness of the Lord I suppose it be this
name Jehovah
the holiness of the Lord, and put it on a lace of Iacyncte and tie it unto the
mytre, upon the forefrunt of it, that it be upon Aaro^s foreheed: that Aaron
bear the sin of the holy things which the childern of Israel have hallowed in
all their holy gifts. And it shall be always upon Aarons foreheed, that they
may be accepted before the Lord.

And thou shall make an albe of bysse, and thou shall make a mytre of bysse and
a girdell of nedle work.

And thou shall make for Aarons sons also cotes, girdels and bonettes
honorable and glorious, and thou shall put them upon Aaron thy brother and on
his sons with him and shall anoynte them and fill their hands and consecrate
them* that they may mynistre unto me. And thou shall make them lynen breches
to cover their preuyties: from the loins unto the thyes shall they reach. And
they shall be upon Aaron and his sons, when they goo in to the tabernacle of
witness, or when they goo unto the altar to mynistre in holiness, that they
bear no sin and so dye. And it shall be a law for ever unto Aaron and his seed
after him.

The.xxix. Chapter.
THis is the thing that thou shall do unto them when thou halowest them to be
my preastes. Take one ox and two rams that are without blemysh, and
vnleue^ded bred and cakes of sweet bred tempered with oil and wafers of sweet
bred anointed with oil (of wheten flower shall thou make them) and put them in
a maunde and bring the^ in the maunde with the oil and the.ij. rams.

And bring Aaron and his sons unto the Of this they take the cons^ ^ra^ynge
of bisshoppes and annoyntynge of preastes, though they have altered the manner
some what
door of the tabernacle of witness, and wassh them with water, and take the
garments, and put upon Aaron: the strayte cote, and the tunycle of the Ephod,
and the Ephod and the brestlappe: and gerth the^ to him with the brodered
girdel of the Ephod. And put the mitre upon his heed and put the holy crown
upon the mytre. Then take the anoyntynge oil and pour it upon his heed and
anoynte him. And bring his sons and put albes upon them, and gerth them with
girdels: as well Aaron as his son nes, And put the bonettes on them that the
preastes office may be theirs for a perpetual law.

And fill the hands of Aaron and of his sons, and bring the ox before the
tabernacle of witness. And let Aaron and his sons put their hands apo^ his
heed and kill hi^ before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of witness And
take of the blood of the ox and put it apo^ the horns of the alter with thy
finger and pour all the blood upon the botome of the alter* and take all the
fatt that covers the inwardes, and the ^all that is on the liver and the.ij.
kydneys with the fatt that is apo^ the^: and burn the^ apo^ the alter. But the
flesh of the ox and his skyn ne and his donge, shall thou burn with fire,
without the host. For it is a synneofferynge.

Then take one of the rams, and let Aaron and his sons put their hondes
upon the head of the ram, and cause him to be slain, and take of his blood
and sprenkell it round about upon the alter, and cut the ram in pieces and
whesh the inwardes of him and his legs, and put them unto the pieces and unto
his heed, and burn the hole ram upon the alter. For it is a burntofferyng unto
the Lord, and a sweet sauoure of the Lords sacrifice.

And take the other ram and let Aaron and his sons, put their hondes upon his
heed and let him than be killed. And take of his blood and put it upon the
typpe of the right ear of Aaron and of his sons, and upon the thombe of
their right hands, and upon the great too of their right fete: and sprenkell
the blood upon the alter round about.

Than take of the blood that is upon the alter and of the anoyntynge oil, and
spre^kell it upon Aaron and his vestime^tes, and apo^ his son nes and apo^
their garments also. Tha^ is he and his clothes holy and his sons and their
clothes holy also

Than take the fatt of the ram and his rompe and the fatt that covers the
inwardes and the kall of the liver and the two kydneys and the fatt that is
upon them and the right shulder (for that ram is a fulloffrynge) and a symnell
of bred and a cake of oyled bred and a wafer out of the baskett of sweet bred
that is before the Lord, and put all upon the hands of Aaron and on the
hands of his sons: and wave the^ in and out a waueoffrynge unto the Lord.
Than take it from of their hands and but ne it upon the alter: even upon the
burntoffringe, to be a sauoure of swetnesse before the Lord. For it is a
sacrifice unto the Lord.

Then take the breast of the ram that is Aarons fulloffrynge and wave it a
waueoffrynge before the Lord, and let that be thy part. And sanctify the
breast of the waueoffrynge and the shulder of the heueoffrynge which is waued
and heued up of the ram which is the fulloffrynge of Aaron and of his sons.
And it shall be Aarons and his sons duty for ever, of the children of Israel:
for it is an heueoffrynge. And the heueoffrynge shall be the Lords duty of the
childern of Israel: even of the sacrifice of their peaceoffrynges which they
heue unto the Lord.

And the holy garments of Aaron shallbe his sons after him, to anoynte them
therein, and to fill their hands therein. And that son that is preast in his
stead after him, shall put them on seven days: that he goo in to the
tabernacle of witness, to ministre in the holy place.

Tha^ take the ram that is the fullofferyng and seth his flesh in an holy
place. And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of hi^, and the bred that
is in the basket: even in the door of the tabernacle of witness. And they
shall eat the^, because the attonme^t was made therewith to fill their hands
and to sanctify the^: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are
holy

If ought of the flesh of the fulloffrynges, or of the bred remain unto the
morning, thou shall burn it with fire: for it shall not be eaten, because it
is holy. And se thou do unto Aaron and his sons: even so in all things as I
have commanded the: that thou fill their hands seven days and offer every
day an ox for a synneoffrynge for to reco^cyle with all. And thoushalt halowe
the alter when thou reconcylest it, and shall anoynte it to sanctify it. Seven
days thou shall reconcyle the alter and sanctify it, that it may be an alter
most holy: Toch not the ci alyce nor the altar sto^ne nor holvoyle and hold
your hand on^ off the font.
so that no man may twich it but they that be consecrate.

This is that which thou shall offer upon the alter: ij. lambs of one year
old day by day for ever, the one thou shall offer in the morninge and the
other at even. And unto the one la^be take a tenth deal of flower myngled with
the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of an hin of
wine, for a drinckeoffrynge. And the other lamb thou shall offer at even and
shall do thereto acordynge to the meateoffrynge and drinkeoffrynge in the
morning, to be an odoure of a sweet sauoure of the sacrifice of the Lord. And
it shall be a continual burntoffrynge among your children after you, in the
door of the tabernacle of witness before the Lord, where I will mete you to
spoke unto you there. There I will mete with the childern of Israel, and will be
sanctified in mine honor. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of witness and
the alter: and I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to be my
preastes. And moreover I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be
their God. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God that brought them
out of the land of Egipte for to dwell among them: even I the Lord their God,

on either side, even under the croune, to put staves therein for to bear it with
all. And thou shall make the staves of sethim wodd and cover them with gold.
And thou shall put it before the veil that hangs before the arcke of
witness, and before the mercyseate that is before the witness, where I will
mete the.

And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet cense every morning when he dresseth the
lamps: and likewise at even when he sets up the lamps he shall burn
cense perpetually before the Lord through out your generacions Ye shall put no
strange cense thereon, nether burntsacrifice nor meateoffrynge: nether pour
any drynkeoffrynge thereon. And Aaron shall reconcyle his horns once in a
year, reych the blood of the synneoffrynge of reconcylige: even once in the
year shall he reconcyle it through your generacions. And so is it most holy
unto the Lord.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: when thou take the sum of the
childern of Israel and tellest them, they shall give every man a reconcylinge
of his soul unto the Lord, that there be no plage among them when thou
tellest them. And thus much shall every man give that goes in the nombre:
half a sycle, after the holy sycle: a sycle is.xx. geeras: and an half sycle
shall be the heueoffrynge unto the Lord. And all that are numbered of the^ that
are.xx. year old and above shall give an heueoffrynge unto the Lord. The rych
shall not pass, and the poor shall not goo under half a sycle, when they
give an heueoffrynge unto the Lord for the attoneme^t of their souls. And
thou shall take the reconcylinge money of the children of Israel and shall put
it unto the use of the tabernacle of witness, and it shall be a memorial of
the childern of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for the if fowls.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: thou shall make a lauer of brass and
his foot also of brass to wash with all, and shall put it between the
tabernacle of witness and the alter and put water therein: that Aaron and his
sons may wesh both their hands and their fete thereout, when they go in to
the tabernacle of witness, or when they goo unto the altar to ministre and to
burn the Lords offrynge, lest they dye. And it shall be an ordinance for ever
unto him and his seed among your childern after you.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: take principal spices: of pure myrre
five hundred sycles, of sweet cynamome half so much

two hundred and fyftie sicles: of sweet calamyte, two hundred and.l. Of
cassia, two hundred and.l. after the holy sycle, and of oil olyue an hin. And
make of them holy anoyntynge oil even an oil compounde after the craft of
the apoticarye. And noynte the tabernacle off witness therewyth, and the arcke
of witness, and the table with all his apparel, and the candelsticke with all
his ordinance, and the alter of incense, and the alter of burntsacrifice and
all his vessels, and the lauer and his foot. And sacrifie them that they may
be most holy: so that no man twyche them but they that be hallowed. And anoynte
Aaron and his sons and consecrate the^ to ministre unto me.

And thou shall speak unto the children of Israel saying: this shall be an holy
oyntynge oil unto me, through out your generacions. No man's flesh shall be
anointed therewith: nether shall ye make any other after the making of it for
it is holy, se therefore that ye take it for holy* whosoever makes like that,
or whosoever puts any of it upon a stranger, shall perysh from among his
people.

And the Lord said unto Moses: take unto the sweet spices: stacte, onycha,
sweet galbanu^ and pure fra^ke^sens, of etch like much: and make cens of them
co^pounde after the craft of the apoticarye, myngled together, that it may be
made pure and holy. And beat it to powder and put it before the witness in
the tabernacle of witness, where I will mete the, but let it be unto you
holy. And se that ye make none after the making of that, but let it be unto
you holy for the Lord. And whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell
thereto, shall perish from among his people.

The.xxxj. Chapter
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: behold, I have called by name,
Bezaleel the son of Vriso^ne to Hur of the tribe of Judah. And I have filled
hi^ with the sprete of God, with wisdom, understanding and knowledge: eue^ in
all manner work, to find out sotle faytes, to work in gold silver and brass
and with the craft to grave stones, to set and to carue in ti^bre and to work
in all manner workma^shipe. And behold, I have given him to be his companion
Ahaliab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, and in the hertes of all
that are wise hearted I have put wisdom to make all that I have commanded the:
the tabernacle of witness, and the arcke of witness, and the mercyseate that
is there upon, all the ornaments of the tabernacle, and the the table with
his ordinance, and the pure ca^delsticke with all his apparel, and the alter
of incens, and the alter of burntoffrynges with all his vessels, and the lauer
with his foot, and the vestime^tes to ministre in, and the holy garments for
Aaron the preast, and the garments of his sons to ministre in, and the
anoyntinge oil and the sweet cense for the sanctuarye: acordinge to al as I
have commanded the shall they do.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses sayng: speak The sabbath beside that it served
to come and hear the word of god and to seek his vvil and to offer and
reconcile the^ selves unto god, it was a sig^^ unto the^ also and did put the^
in reme^bran^ce that i^ was god that sanctified the^ with his holy sprete
and not they them selves with their holy vverkes.
unto the childern of Israel and say: i^ any wise se that ye keep my Sabbath,
for it shall be a sign between me and you in your generacions for to know,
that I the Lord do sanctify you. Keep my Sabbath therefore, that it be an
holy thing unto you. He that defiles it, shall be slain therefore. For
whosoever works therein, the same soul shall be roted out from among his
people. Six days shall men work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
holy rest of the Lord: so that whosoever does any work in the Sabbath
day, shall dye for it. wherefore let the childern of Israel keep the Sabbath,
that they observe it through out their generacions, that it be an appoyntement
for ever. For it shall be a sign between me, and the childern of Israel for
ever. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the seventh day he
rested and was refresshed.

And when he had made an end of comening with Moses upon the mount Sinai, he
gave him two tables of witness: which were of stone and written with the
finger of God.

The.xxxij. Chapter
ANd when the people saw that it was long or Moses came down out of the
mountain, they gathered them selves together and came unto Aaron and said
unto him: Up and make us a god to goo before us: for of this Moses the fellow
that brought us out of the land off Egipte, we wot not what is become.

And Aaron said unto them: pluck of the golden earynges which are in the
ears of your wives, your sons and of your daughters: and bring them unto
me. And all the people plucked of the golden earinges that were in their ears,
and brought them unto Aaron And he received them of their hands and facyoned
it with a grauer and made it a calfe of molten metal. And they said: This is
thy god O Israel, which brought the out of the land of Egipte.

And when Aaron saw that, he made an altar before it, and made a proclamacion
saing tomorow shall be holy day unto the Lord. And they rose up in the morning
and offered burnt offrynges, and brought offrynges of atonement also. And than
they satt them down to eat and drink, and rose up again to play.

Than the Lord said unto Moses: go get the down, for thy people which thou
broughtest out of the land of Egipte, have marred all they are turned at once
out of the way which I commanded the^, and have made the^ a calfe of molten
metal, and have worshipped it and have offered thereto and have said: This* is
thy God thou Israel, which has brought the out of the land of Egipte. And the
Lord said unto Moses: behold, I see this people that it is a stife necked
people, and now therefore suffer me The pop a would curse xx. hundred thousand
as black as coals, and send the^ to hell for to have soche a profre, and
would not have prayed ^ Moses did.
that my wrath may wax hot upon the^, and that I may consume the^: and
than will I make of the a mighty people,

Than Moses besoughte the Lord his God and said: O Lord, why should thy wrath
wax hot apo^ thy people which thou have brought out of the land of Egipte
with great power and with a mighty hand? wherefore should the Egiptians speak
and say: For a mischefe did he bring them out: even for to slay them in the
mountayns, and to consume them from the face of the earth. Turn from thy fearse
wrath, and have compassion over the wikednesse of thy people. Remember Abraham,
Isaac and Israel thy servauntes, to who^ thou sworest by thine own self and
saidest unto the^: I will multiplye your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land which I have said, I will give unto your seed: and they shall
e^heret it for ever. And the Lord refrayned him self from that evil, which
he said he would do unto his people.

And Moses turned his back and went down from the hill, and the.ij. tables of
witness in his hand: which were written on both the leaves and were the work
of God, and the writi^ge was the writing of God graue^ upon the tables. And
when Joshua herd the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses:
there is a noise of war in the host. And he said* it is not the cry of
the^ that have the mastrye* nor of the^ that have the worse: but I do hear
the noise of synginge.

And as soon as he came nigh unto the host and saw the calfe and the
daunsynge, his wrath waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hand, and
brake them even at the hill foot. And he took the calfe which they had made and
burned it with fire, and stamped it unto powder and strowed it in the water, and
made the childern of Israel drink. And tha^ Moses said unto Aaron: what did
this people unto the that thou have brought so great a sin upon them.

And Aaron said: let not the wrath of my Lord wax fearse, thou know the
people that they are even set on myschefe: they said unto me: make us a god
to goo before us, for we wot not what is become of Moses the fellow that
brought us out of the land of Egipte. And I said unto them* let them that
have gold, take and bring it me: and I kest it in to the fire, and there of
came out this calfe

when Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked unto
their shame when they made insurrection) he went and stood in the gate of the
host and said: If any man perteyne unto the Lord, let him come to me. And
all the sons of Leui gathered them selves together and came unto him. And he
said unto them, thus says the Lord of Israel: put every man his sword by
his side, and goo in and out from gate to gate through out the host: and slay
every man his brother, every man his friend and every man his neighbor. And
the childern of Leui did as Moses had said. And there were slain of the
people the same day, about three thousand The pop^s bull flees ^oo tha^
Aaron scalfe, ^ue^ an hundred thousand for one here of them.
men. Then Moses said: fill your hands unto the Lord this day, every man
upon his son and upon his brother: to bring upon you a blessing this
day.

And on the morrow, Moses said unto the people: Ye have sinned a great sin.
But now I will goo up unto the Lord, to wit whether I can make an atonement
for your sin.

And Moses went again unto the Lord and said: Oh, this people have sinned a
great sin and have made the^ a god of gold: Yet O pitiful Moses, and
likewise O merciful Paul Roma.ix. And o abominable pope with all his
merciless Idols.
forgive them their sin I pray the: If not wype me out of thy book which
thou have written. And the Lord said unto Moses: I will put him out of my
book that has sinned against me. But goo and bring the people unto the land
which I said unto the: behold, mine angel shall goo before the.
Neuerthelater in the day when I vyset, I will vysett their sin upon them.
And the Lord plaged the people, because they made the calfe which Aron made.

The.xxxiij. Chapter
ANd the Lord said unto Moses: depart and goo hence: both thou and the
people which thou have brought out of the la^d of Egipte, unto the land which
I swore unto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob saying: unto thy seed I will give it. And
I will send an angel before the, and will cast out the Canaanytes, the
Amorites, the Hethites, the Pherezites, the, Heuites and the Iebusites: that
thou mast goo in to a land that flows with milk and honye. But I will not
goo among you my self, for ye are a styfnecked people: lest I consume you by
the way. And when the people heard this evil tydinges, they sorowed: and no
man did put on his best raiment.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses, say un to the childern of Israel: ye are a
styf^necked people: I must come ons suddenly upon you, and make an end of you.
But now put your goodly rayme^t from you, that I may wete what to do unto
you. And the childern of Israel laid their goodly rayme^t from them eue^ under
the mount Horeb.

And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the host a far of from
the host, and called it the tabernacle of witness. And all that would axe any
question of the Lord, went out unto the tabernacle of witness which was
without the host. And when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, all the people
rose up and stood every man in his tentdore and looked after Moses, until he
was gone in to the tabernacle. And as soon as Moses was entered in to the
tabernacle, the clouden piler descended and stood in the door of the
tabernacle, and he talked with Moses. And when all the people saw the clouden
piler stand in the tabernacle door, they rose up and worshipped: every man in
his tentdore.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks unto his
friend. And whem Moses turned again in to the host, the ladd Joshua his
servant the son of Nun departed not out of the tabernacle. And Moses said
unto the Lord: se, thou saydest unto me: led this people forth, but thou
show me not whom thou will send with me. And have said moreover: I know
the by name and thou have also found grace in my syghte: Now therefore, if I
have found favor in thy syghte, the^ show me thy way and let me know the:
that I may find grace in thy sight. And look on this also, how that this
nacyon is thy people. The popish say, my chyr^^, mi paresh my diocese, and the
monks and frires say all ^^ ^u^^^.


And he said: my presence shall goo with the, and I will give the rest. And he
said: if thy presence goo not with me, carye us not hense for how shall it be
known now that both I and thy people have found favor in thy sight, but in
that thou go with us: that both I and thy people have a pr^emynence before
all the people that are upon the face of the earth. And the Lord said unto
Moses: I will do this also that thou have said, for thou have found grace in
my sight, and I know the by name.

And he said: I beseech the, show me thy glory: And he said: I will make all
my good goo before the, and I will be called in this name Jehovah before the,
and will show mercy to whom I show mercy, and will have compassion on whom I
have compassion. And he said furthermore: thou may not se my face, for there
shall no man se me and live.

And the Lord said: behold, there is a place by me, and thou shall stand
upon a rock, and while my glory goes forth I will put the in a clyfte of the
rock, and will put mine hand upon the while I pass by. And then I will take
away mine hand, and thou shall se my back parts: but my face shall not be
seen.

The.xxxiiij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord said unto Moses: hew the.ij. tables of stone like unto the
first that I may write in the^ the words which were in the first.ij. tables,
which thou brakest. And be redye against the morni^ge that thou may come up
early unto the mount of Sinai and sto^de me there apo^ the top of the mount.
But let no man come up with the, nether let any man be seen through out all the
mount, nether let sheep nor oxen feed before the hill.

And Moses hewed.ij. tables of stone like unto the first and rose up early in
the morninge and went up unto the mount of Sinai as the Lord commanded him:
and took in his hand the. i^ tables of stone. And the Lord descended in the
cloud, and stood with him there: and he called apo^ the name of the Lord. And
when the Lord walked before him, he cried: Lord Lord God full of compassion
and mercy, which art not lightly angrye but abunda^t in mercy and truth* and
kepest mercy in store for thousands, and forgeuest wikednesse, trespace and
sin (for there is no man ynnoce^t before the) and visetest the wikydnesse of
the fathers upon the childern and upon childerns childern* even unto the thryd
and fourth generation. And Moses bowed himself to the earth quykly, and
worshipped and said: if I have found grace in thy sight o Lord, than let my
Lord goo with us (for it is a stuburne people) and have mercy apo^ our
wikednesse and our sin, and let us be thine enheritaunce.

And he said: behold, I make an appointment before all this people, that I
will do maruells: soch as have not been done ^ all the world, nether among
any nacyon. And all the people among which thou art, shall se the work of the
Lord: for it is a terryble thing that I will do with the: keep all that I
command the this day, and behold: I will cast out before the: the Amorites,
Canaanites, Hethites, Pherezites, Heuites and Iebusites. Take heed to thy
self, that thou make no compacte with the inhabiters of the lord whether thou
go lest it be cause of ruin among you. But overthrow their alters and
break their pilers, and cut down their grooues, for thou shall worship no
strange God For the Lord is called gelous, because he is a gelous God: lest
if thou make any agreament with the inhabiters of the land, when they go a
whoorynge after their gods and do sacrifyce unto their gods, they call the
and thou eat of their sacrifyce: and thou take of their daughters unto thy
sons, and when their daughters goo a whoorynge after their gods, they make
thy sons goo a whoorynge after their gods also.

Thou shall make the no gods of metal The fest of sweet bred shall thou
keep, and, vij. days thou shall eat vnleuended bred (as I commanded the) in
the time appointed in the month of Abib: for in the month of Abib thou came
out of Egipte. All that breaks up the matryce shall be mine, and all that
breaks the matryce among thy catell, if it be male: whether it be ox or
sheep. But the first of the ass thou shall by out with a sheep, or if thou
redeem him not: se thou break his neck. All the firstborne of thy sons thou
must That is a god text for the pope^
needs redeem. And se that no man appear before me emptye.

Six days thou shall work, and the seventh thou shall rest: both from
earynge and reapynge. Thou shall observe the feast of wekes with the first
fruits of wheat heruest, and the feast of ingaderynge at the years end.
Thrice in a year shall all your men children appear before the Lord Ichouah
God of Israel: for I will cast out the nacyons before the and will enlarge thy
costs, so that no man shall desire thy land, while thou go up to appear
before the face of the Lord thy God, thryse in the year.

Thou shall not offer the blood of my sacrifyce with leuended bred: nether
shall ought of the sacrifyce of the feast of Passover, be left unto the
morninge. The first of the firstfrutes of thy lord, thou shall bring unto the
house of the Lord thy God. And se, that thou seth not a kydd in his mothers
milk.

And the Lord said unto Moses: write these words, for upon these words I
have made a covenant with the and with the childern of Israel. And he was
there with the Lord.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes, and nether ate bred nor drunk
water. And he wrote in the tables the words of the covenant: even ten verses.

And Moses came down from mount Sinai and the.ij. tables of witness in his
hand, and yet he wist not that the skin of his face shone with beams of his
comenynge with him. And when Aaron and all the childern of Israel looked upon
Moses and saw that the skin of his face shone with beams, they were a
frayde to come nigh him. But he called the^ to him, and then Aaron and all the
chief of the company came unto him, and Moses talked with them.

And at the last all the childern of Israel came unto him, and he commanded
them all that the Lord had said unto him in mount Sinai. And as soon as he
had made an end of comenynge with them, he put a covering apo^ his face. But
whe^he went before the Lord to speak with him, he took the coueri^ge of until
he came out. And he came out and spoke The Pope speaks that which he is not
commanded.
unto the childern of Israel that which he was commanded. And the childern of
Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of his face shone with beams:
but Moses put a covering upon his face, until he went in, to comen with him.

The.xxxv. Chapter.
ANd Moses gathered all the company of the childern of Israel together, and
said unto them: these are the things which the Lord has commanded to do:
Six days ye shall work, but the seventh day shall be unto you the holy
Sabbath of the Lords rest: so that whosoever does any work there in, shall
dye. Moreover ye shall kyndle no fire through out all your habitacyons apo^ the
Sabbath day.

And Moses spoke unto all the multitude of the childern of Israel sainge: this
is the thing which the Lord commanded saying: Give from among you an
heueoffringe, unto the Lord. All thatt are willing in their hearts, shall
bring heueoffringes unto the Lord: gold, silver, brass: Iacyncte, scarlet,
purpull, bysse and gootes hare: rams skynnes red and taxus skynnes and Sethim
wodd: and oil for lights and spices for the anoyntynge oil and for the sweet
cens: And Onixstones and stones to be set for the Ephod and for the brestlappe.

And let all them that are wyseharted among you, come and make all that the
Lord has commanded: the habitacion and the tens there of with his covering
and his rings, bordes, bars, pilers and sokettes: the arc and the staves
thereof with the mercyseate and the veil that covers it: the table and his
staves with all that perteyneth thereto and the shewebred: the candelsticke of
light with his apparel and his lamps and the oil for the lights: the
censalter and his staves, the anoyntynge oil and the sweet cens and the
hanging before the tabernacle door: the alter of burntsacrifyces and his
brazen gredyren that longs there to with his staves and all his ordinance
and the lauer and his foot: the hangynges of the court with his pilers and
their sokettes, and the hanging to the door of the court: the pynnes of the
habitacion and the pynnes of the court with their boordes: the mynystrynge
garments to mynystre with in holiness, and the holy vestimentes of Aaron the
preast and the vestimentes of his sons to mynystre in.

And all the company of the childern of Israel departed from the presence of
Moses. And they went (as many as their hearts coraged them and as many as their
spirits made them willing) and brought heueoffrynges unto the Lord, to the
making of the tabernacle of witness and for all his uses and for the holy
vestmentes. And the men came with the women (even as many as were willing
hearted) and brought bracelettes, earynges, rings and girdels and all manner
Jewels of gold. And all the men that waued waueoffrynges of gold unto the
Lord and every man with whom was found Iacyncte, scarlet, purpull, bysse or
gootes hair or red skynnes of rams or taxus skynnes, brought it. And all
that houe up gold or brass, brought an heueoffrynge unto the Lord. And all
men with whom was found sethim wodd mete for any manner work or service,
brought it.

And all the women that were wise herted to work with their hands, spanne,
and brought the sponne work, both of Iacyncte, scarlet, purpull and bysse. And
all the women that excelled in wisdom of heart, spa^ne the gotes hair. And
the lords brought Onix stones and settstones for the Epod, and for the breast
lap, and spyce and oil: both for the lights and for the anoyntyng oil and
for the sweet cens. And the childern of Israel brought wyllyngeoffrynges unto
the Lord, both men and women: as many as their hearts made the^ willing to
bring, for all manner works which the Lord had commanded to make by the
hand of Moses.

And Moses said unto the childern of Israel: behold, the Lord has called by
name Bezabeel the son of Vri the son of Hur of the trybe of Judah, and has
filled him with the sprete of God, with wisdom, vndersto^dinge and knowledge,
even in all manner work, and to find out curyous works, to work in gold,
silver and brass: and with grauynge of stones to set, and with keruynge in
wodd, and to work in all manner of sotle works. And he has put in his heart
the grace to teach: both him and Ahaliab the son of Ahisamach of the trybe of
Dan has he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of graven work:
they are also broderers and workers with nedle, In Iacyncte, scarlet, purple
and bysse, and are weuers that can make all manner work, and can deuyse sotle
works.

The.xxxvi. Chapter.
ANd Bezaleel wrought and Ahaliab and all wise hearted me^ to whom the Lord had
given wisdom and understanding, to know how to work all manner work for the
holy service, in all that the Lord commanded. And Moses called for Bezaleel
Ahaliab and all the wise hearted men in whose hertes the Lord had put wisdom,
eue^ as many ab their hearts coraged to come unto the work to work it. And
they received of Moses all the heueoffrynges which the childern of Israel had
brought for the work of the holy service to make it with all. And they
brought beside that wyllyngeoffringes every morning.

And all the wise men that wrought all the holy work, came every man from his
work when will the Pope say hoo, and forbid to offere for the byldinge of
saint Peter's church: and when will ou^e spirit^altie say hoo, and forbid to
give the^ more land and to make moo fu^dacious? never verily until they have
all.
which they made, and spoke unto Moses saying: the people bring to much and
above that is enough to serve for the work which the Lord has commanded to
make. And then Moses gave a commaundment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
through our the host saying: se that nether man nor woman prepare any moare
work for the holy heueoffrynge, and so the people were * forboden to bring:
for the stuff they had, was sufficyent for them unto all the work, to make it
and to much.

And all the wise hearted men among them that wroughte in the work of the
habytacyon made: even.x. cortcynes of twyned bysse, Iacyncte, scarlet and
purple, and made them full of cherubyns with broderd work. The length of one
curtayne was.xxviij. cubettes and the breadth.iiij. and were all off one syse.
And they coupled five curteyn^ by them selves, and other five by them selves.
And they made fyftye louppes of Iacincte alonge by the edge of the utmost
curtayne, even in the silvege of the couplynge courtayne: And likewise they
made on the side of the utmost couplinge curtayne on the other side, fyftye
louppes they made in the one curtayne, and fyftye in the edge of the couplynge
courtayne on the other side: so that the loupes were one oueragenst another.
And they made fyftye rings of gold, and coupled the curtaynes one to another
with the rings: and so was it made a dwellinge place.

And they made.xi. curtaynes of gootes here to be a tent over the tabernacle
xxx. cubettes long a piece and.iiij. cubettes broad, and they all.xi. of one
syse.

And they coupled.v. by them selves, and and.vi. by them selves, and they made
fyftye louppes alonge by the border of the utmost couplinge courtayne on the
one side, and fyftye in the edge of the couplynge curtayne on the other side.
And they made fyftye rings of brass to couple the tent together that it
might be one. And they made a covering unto the tent of rams skynnes red,
and yet another of taxus skynnes above all.

And they made bordes for the dwelling place of sethim wodd that stood upright
every board.x. cubetes long and a cubet and an half broad. And they made.ij.
fete to every boorde of the dwellinge place ioyninge one to another. And they
made.xx. boordes for the south side of the habytacyon, and.xl. sokettes of
silver under the.xx. boordes.ij. sokettes under every boorde, even for the.ij.
fete of the^. And for the other side of the dwelling toward the north, they
made other.xx. boordes with xl. sokettes of silver.ij. sokettes under every
boorde. And behind in the end of the tabernacle toward the west, they
made.vi. boordes and.ij. other bordes for the corners of the habitacyon
behind, and they were joined closse both beneth and also above with clampes,
and thus they did to both the corners: so they were in all.viij. boordes
and.xvi. sokettes, under every board two sokettes.

And they made bars of sethim wodd.v. for the bordes of the one side of the
habitacion and.v. for the other, and five for the bordes of the west end of
the habitacion. And they made the myddell bar to shote through the bordes:
even from the one end to the other, and ouerlayde the bordes with gold, and
made the rings of gold to thrust the bars through, and covered the bars
with gold. And they made an hanging of Iacincte, of scarlett purple and
twyned bysse with cherubyns of broderd work. And made thereunto.iiij. pilers of
sethim wodd and ouerlayde them with gold. Their knoppes were also of gold, and
they cast for them.iiij. sokettes of silver. And they made an hanging for the
tabernacle door: of Iacincte, scarlet, purple and twyned bysse of nedle work,
and the pilers of it were five with their knoppes, and ouerlayde the heads of
them and the whooppes with gold, with their five sokettes of brass.

The.xxxvij. Chapter
ANd bezalecl made the arcke of sethim wodd two cubettes and an half long and
a cubette and a half broad, and a cubett and a half hye: and ouerlayde it
with fine gold both within and without, and made a crown of gold to it
round about, and cast for it iiij. rings of gold for the.iiij. corners of
it: two rings for the one side and two for the other, and made staves of
Sethim wodd, and covered them with gold, and put the staves in the rings
alonge by the side of the arcke to bear it with all.

And he made the mercyseate of pure gold two cubettes and a half long and
one cubette and a half broad, and made two cherubyns of thick gold upon the
two ends off the mercyseate: One cherub on the one end, and another cherub on
the other end of the mercyseate. And the cherubyns spredde out their wings
above an hye, and covered the mercyseate therewith, And their faces were one to
another: even to the mercyseate ward, were the faces of the cherubins.

And he made the table of sethim wodd two cubettes long and a cubette broad,
and a cubette and an half high, and ouerlayde it with fine gold, and made
thereto a crown of gold round about, and made thereto an whope of an hand
bread round about, and made unto the whope a crown of gold round about,
and cast for it.iiij. rings of gold and put the rings in the.iiij. corners
by the fete: even under the whope to put staves in to bear the table with all.
And he made staves of Sethim wodd and covered them with gold to bear the table
with all, and made the vessels that were on the table of pure gold, the
dysshes, spones, flattpeces and pottes to pour with all,

And he made the candelsticke of pure thick gold: both the candelsticke and
his shaft: with braunces, bolles, knoppes and flowers procedynge out of it.
Six branches procedinge out of the sides thereof.iij. out of the one side
and.iij. out of the other. And on every branch were iij. cups like unto
almondes, with knoppes and flowers through out the six branches that proceeded
out of the candelsticke. And upon the candelsticke self, were.iiij. cups
after the facyon of almondes with knoppes and flowers: under eueri two
branches a knoppe. And the knoppes and the branches proceeded out of it, and
were all one piece of pure thick gold. And he made seven lamps thereto, and
the snoffers thereof, and fyrepa^nes of pure gold. An hundred weyghte of pure
gold, made both it and all that belonged thereto.

And he made the ce^salter of sethi^ wodd of a cubett long and a cubett broad:
eue^.iiij. square and two cubettes hye with horns procedynge out of it. And he
covered it with pure gold both the top and the sides round about and the
horns of it, and made unto it a crown of gold round about. And he made two
rings of gold unto it, even under the croune upon either side of it, to put
staves in for to bear it with all: and made staves of sethim wodd, and ouerlayde
them with gold. And he made the holy anoyntinge oil and the sweet pure ince^s
after the apothecarys craft.

The.xxxviij. Chapter
ANd he made the burntoffryngealter of sethim wodd, five cubettes long and. v
cubettes broad: even. iiij square, and.iij. cubettes hye. And he made horns in
the.iiij. corners of it procedinge out of it, and ouerlayde it with brass. And
he made all the vessels of the alter: the cauldrons, shovels, basyns, fleshokes
and colepannes all of brass.

And he made a brazen gredyren of networke unto the alter round about allow
beneth under the compass of the alter: so that it reached unto half the
altar, and cast.iiij. rings of brass for the.iiij. ends of the gredyren to
put staves in. And he made staves of sethim wodd and covered them with brass,
and put the staves in the rings alonge by the alter side to bear it with all,
and made the alter holowe with bordes.

And he made the lauer of brass and the fo te of it also of brass, in the
syghte of them that did watch before the door of the tabernacle of witness.

And he made the court with hangynges of twyned bysse of an hundred cubettes
long upon the southsyde, and.xx. pilers with.xx. sokettes of brass: but the
knoppes of the pilers, and the whoopes were silver. And on the north side the
hanginges were an hundred cubettes long with.xx. pilers and.xx. sokettes of
brass, but the knoppes and the whopes of the pilers were of silver. And on the
west side, were hangynges of.l. cubettes long, and.x. pilers with their.x.

east side toward the son rysynge, were hangynges of.l. cubettes: the
hangynges of the one side of the gate were.xv. cubettes long, and their
pilers.iij. with their. iij, sokettes. And off the other side of the court
gate, were hanginges also of.xv. cubettes long and their pilers iii. with.iij.
sokettes. Now all the hanginges of the court round about, were of twyned
bysse, and the sokettes of the pilers were brass: but the knoppes and the
whoopes of the pilers were silver, and the heedes were ouerlayde with silver,
and all the pilers of the court were whoped about with silver. And the
hanginge of the gate of the court was nedleworke: of Iacincte, scarlet,
purple, and twyned bysse.xx. cubettes long and five in the breadth, acordynge
to the hangynges of the court. And the pilers were.iiij. with.iiij. sokettes
of brass, and the knoppes of silver, and the heedes ouerlayde with silver and
whoped about with silver, and all the pynnes of the tabernacle and of the
court round about were brass.

This is the sum of the habitacyo^ of witness, which was counted at the
commaundment of Moses: and was the office of the Levites by the hand of
Ithamar son to Aaron the preast. And Bezaleel son of Vri son to Hur of
the trybe of Judah, made all that the Lord commanded Moses, and with hi^
Ahaliab son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, a co^nynge grauer and a worker
of nedle work In Iacincte, scarlett, purple and bysse.

All the gold that was occupyde upon all the work of the holy place (which
was the gold of the waueofferynge) was, xxix. hundred weight and seven hundred
and.xxx. sycles, acordynge to the holy sycle. And the sum of silver that came
of the multitude, was* v score hundred weight and a thousand seven hundred
and. lxxv, sycles of the holyesycle.

Every man offrynge half a sycle after the weight of the holy sycle among
them that went to be nombred from.xx. year old and above, among.vj. hundred
thousand and.iij. thousand and v. hundred and.l. men.

And the.v. score hundred weight of silver, went to the casting of the
sokettes of the sanctuary and the sokettes of the veil: an hundred sokettes of
the five score hundred weigh an hundred weight to every sokette. And the
thousaude seven hundred and.lxxv. sycles, made knoppes to the pilers and
ouerlayde the heedes and whoped them.

And the brass of the wave offering was lxx. hundred weight and two
thousand, and iiij. hundred sycles. And therewith he made the sokettes to the
door of the tabernacle of witness, and the brazen altar, and the brazen
gredyren that longs thereto, and all the vessels of the alter, and the
sokettes of the court round about, and the sokettes of the court gate, and
all the pynnes off the habitacyon, and all the pynnes of the court round
about.

The.xxxix. Chapter.
ANd of the Iacyncte, scarlet, purple and twyned bysse, they made the
vestime^tes of ministracion to do service in in that holy place, and made the
holy garments that perteyned to Aaron, as the Lord* commanded Moses.

And they made the Ephod of gold, Iacinte, scarlet, purple, and twyned bysse.
And they did beat the gold in to thynne plates, and cut it in to wyres: to
work it in the Iacincte, sca^let, purple and the bysse, with broderd work.
And they made the sides come together, and cloosed them up by the two edges.
And the brodrynge of the girdel that was upon it, was of the same stuff and
after the same work of gold, Iacincte, scarlet, purple and twyned bysse, as
the Lord commanded Moses.

And they wrought onix stones cloosed in ouches of gold and graued as
sygnettes are graven with the names of the children of Israel, and put them on
the shulders of the Ephod that they should be a remembrance off the childern
of Israel, as the Lord commanded Moses.

And they made the bres^lappe of conning work, after the work of the Ephod:
even of gold, Iacincte, scarlet, purple and twyned bysse And they made
it.iiij. square and double, an hand breadth long and an hand breadth broad.
And they filled it with.iiij. rows of stones (the first row: Sardios, a Topas
and smaragdus. the second row: a Rubin, a Saphir and a Diamo^de The.iij.
row: Ligurios, an Achat and a Amatist. The fourth row: a Turcas, an Onix and
a Iaspis) closed in ouches of gold in their inclosers. And the.xij. stones were
graue^ as sygnet ^es with the names of the childern of Israel: every stone with
his name, acordinge to the. xij trybes.

And they made upon the brestlappe, two fastenynge cheynes of wrethen work
and pure gold. And they made two hokes of gold and two gold rings, and put
the two rings apo^ the two corners of the brestlappe. And they put the two
chains of gold in the.ij. rings, in the corners of the brestlappe. And
the.ij. ends of the two cheynes they fastened in the.ij. hokes, and put them
on the shulders of the Ephod upon the forefront of it.

And they made two other rings of gold and put them on the two other corners
of the brestlappe alonge upon the edge of it, toward the insyde of the Ephod
that is over against it And they made yet two other gold rings, and put them
on the.ij. sides of the Ephod, beneth on the fore side of it: eue^ where the
sides go^ together, above upon the brodrynge of the Ephod, and they strayned
the brestlappe by his r^ges unto the ringes of the Ephod, with laces of
Iacincte, that it might lie fast upon the brodrynge of the Ephod, and should
not be l^wsed from of the Ephod: as the Lord commanded Moses.

And he made the tunycle unto the Ephod of wouen work and all together of
Iacincte, and the head of the tunycle was in the midst of it as the color of
a partlet, with a bond round about the color, that it should not rent, And
they made beneth upon the hem of the tunycle: pomgranates of Iacincte, scarlet,
purple and twyned bysse, And they made little belles of pure gold, and put them
among the pomgranates round about apo^ the edge of the tunycle a bell and a
pomgranate, a bell and a pomgranate round about the hommes of the tunycle to
mynistre in, as the Lord commanded Moses

And they made cotes of bysse of woue^ work for Aaron and his sons, and a
mytre off bysse, and goodly ^onettes of bysse, and lynen breches off twyned
bysse, and a gyrdell of twyned bysse, Iacyncte, scarlett and purple: even of
nedle work, as the Lord commanded Moses,

And they made the plate of the holy croune of fine gold, and wrote apo^^^
with graue^ work: the holiness of the Lord. and tied it to a lace of Iacincte
to fasten yt an hye upon the mytre, as the Lord commanded Moses.

Thus was all the work of the habitacyon of the tabernacle of witness,
finysshed. And the childern of Israel did, acordyng to all that the Lord had
commanded Moses. And they brought the habitacyon unto Moses: the tent and all
his apparel thereof: the buttones boordes, bars, pilers and sokettes: and
the covering of rams skynnes red, and the covering of taxus skynnes, and the
hanginge veil, and the arcke of witness with the staves thereof, and the
mercyseate: the table and all the ordinance thereof, and the shewbred, and the
pure candelsticke, and the lamps prepared thereunto with all the vessels
thereof, and the oil for lyghtes, and the golden altar and the anoyntynge
oil and the sweet cens, and the hanging of the tabernacle door, and the
brazen alter, and the gredyern of brass longing thereunto with his bars and
all his ^essels, and the lauer with his foot, and the hanginges of the court
with his pilers and sokettes, and the hanging to the court gate, his boordes
and pynnes, and all the ordinance that serves to the habitacion of the
tabernacle of witness, and the ministringe vestimentes to serve in the holy
place, and the holy vestimentes of Aaron the preast and his sons rayme^ tes
to ministre in: acordyng to all that the Lord commanded Moses: even so the
childern of Israel made all the work. And Moses beheld all the work: and se,
they had done it even as the Lord commanded: and tha^ Moses blessed them.

The.xl. Chapter
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: In the first day of the first month
shall thou set up the habitacio^ of the tabernacle of witness, and put theri^
the arcke of witness, and cover the arcke with the veil, and bring in the
table and apparel it, and bring in the candelsticke and put on his lamps,
and set the censalter of gold before the arcke of witness, and put the
hanging of the door un to the habitacion. And set the burntostrynge alter
before the door of the tabernacle of witness, and set the lauer between the
tabernacle of witness, and the alter, and put water theri, and make the court
round about, and set up the ha^gynge of the court gate.

And take the anoyntinge oil and anoint the habitacion and all that is there
in, and halow Of this text the scole men dispute that the very s^^e ringe
alone makes the pressed now also with out the brestlapp of light and

it and all that belong thereto: that it may be holy. And anoynte the altar
of the burntoffringes and all his vessels, and sanctifye the altar that it may
be most holy. And anoynte also the lauer and his foot, and sanctifye it.

Than bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of witness,
and wash them with water. And put upon Aaron the holy vestmentes and anoynte
him and sanctifye him that he may ministre unto me, that their * anoyntige
may be an everlasting preast hode unto the^ through out their generacions. And
Moses did acordige to all that the Lord commanded him.

Thus was the tabernacle reared up the first month in the second year. And
Moses rered up the tabernacle and fastened his sokettes, and set up the bordes
and put in their bars, and rered up the pillars, and spread abroad the te^t
over the habitacio^ and put the coueringe of the tent an hye above it: as the
Lord commanded Moses.

And he took and put the testimonye in the arc and set the staves to the
arcke and put the merciseate an hye upon the arcke, and brought the arcke in
to the habitacio^ and hanged up the veil and covered the arcke of witness, as
the Lord commanded Moses.

And he put the table in the tabernacle off witness in the north side of the
habitacio^ with out the veil, and set the bred in order before the Lord, eue^
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

And he put the candelsticke in the tabernacle of witness over against the
table in the south side of the habitacion, and set up the lamps before the
Lord: as the Lord commanded Moses. And he put the golden alter in the
tabernacle of witness before the veil, and brent sweet cens there on as the
Lord commanded Moses. And set up the hanging in the door of the habitacion,
and set the burntoffringe alter before the door of the tabernacle of witness,
and offered burntoffringes and meatofferinges there on as the Lord commanded
Moses.

And he set the lauer between the tabernacle of witness and the alter, and
poured water there in to wash with all. And both Moses Aaron and his sons
washed their hands and their fete there at: both when theywent in to the
tabernacle of witness, or when they went to the alter, as the Lord commanded
Moses. And he ^ered up the court round about the habitacion and the alter,
and set up the hanginge of the court gate: and so Moses fynished the work.

And the cloud covered the tabernacle of witness, and the glory of the Lord
filled the habitacion: so that Moses could not enter in to the tabernacle of
witness, because the cloud abode there in, and the glory of the Lord filled
the habitacion.

When the cloud was taken up from of the habitacyo^, the childern of Israel
took their iornayes as often as they iornayed. And if the cloud departed not,
they iornayed not till it departed: for the cloud of the Lord was upon the
habitacion by day, and fire by night: in the sight of all the house of
Israel in all their iornayes.

The end of the second book of Moses:
A PROLOGE IN TO THE third book of Moses called Leuiticus.
A prologe in to the third book of Moses, called Leuiticus.
THe ceremonies which are described in the book folowinge, were cheflye ordined
off God, (as I said in the end of the prologe upon Exodi) to occupye the
minds of that people the Israelites, and to keep them from servinge of God
after the imaginacyon of their blind zele and good intent: that their
conscience^ might be stablished and they sure that they pleased God therein,
which were impossible, if a man did of his own heed that which was not
commanded of God nor depe^ded of any appoyntement made between him and God.
Soch ceremonies were unto them as an A. B.C. to learn to spelle and read, and
as a nurce to feed them with milk and pappe, and to speak unto them after
their own capacyte and to lispe the words unto them acording as the babes and
childern of that age might sound them again. For all that were before Christ
were in the infancye and childhod of the world and saw that son which we se
openly, but through a cloud and had but feeble and weak imaginacions of
Christ, as childern have of men's deades, a few prophets excep ^^ which yet
described him unto other in sacrifices and ceremonies, likenesses, rydles,
proverbs, and dark and strange speakinge vntyil the full age were come that
God would show him openly unto the whole world and deliver them from their
shadows and cloudelight and the hethen out of their dead sleep of starcke
blind ignorancye. And as the shadow vanishes away at the coming of the
light, even so do the ceremonies and sacrifices at the coming of Christ, and
are henceforth no moare necessary then a token left in remembrance of a
bargayne is necessary when the bargayne is fulfilled. And though they some
plain childish, yet they be not altogether frutelesse: as the popettes and.xx.
manner of try fles which mothers permit unto their young childern be not all
in vain. For all be it that soch phantasyes be permytted to satisfy the
childers lusts, yet in that they are the mothers gift and be done in place
and time at her commandment, they keep the childern in awe and make them
know the mother and also make them more apt agenste a more stronger age to
obaye in things of greater ^rneste.

And moraouer though sacrifices and ceremonies can be no ground or fundacion to
bild upon: that is, though we can prove naught with them: yet when we have
once sound out Christ and his mysteries, then we may borow figures, that is
to say allegoryes, similitudes or examples to open Christ and the secrettes
off God hyd in Christ even unto the quycke, and to declare them more lively and
sensebly with them than with all the words of the world. For similitudes have
more virtue and power with them than bare words, and lead a man's wits
further in to the pithe and marye and spiritual understanding of the thing,
than all the words that can be imagined. And though also that all the
ceremonies and sacrifices have as it were a slerrelyght of Christ, yet some
there be that have as it were the light of the broad day a little before the
son risinge, and express him, and the circumstaunces and virtue of his death
so plainly as if we should play his passion on a scaffold or in a stage play
ope^lye before the eyes of the people. As the escape got, the brazen serpent,
the ox burnt without the host* the passeouerlambe etc. In so much that I am
fully persuaded and can not but believe that God had showed Moses the secrettes
of Christ and the verey manner of his death before hand, and commanded him to
ordene them for the confirmacion of our faythes which are now in the clear
day light. And I believe also that the prophets which followed Moses to
confirm his prophesyes and to maintain his doctrine unto Christ's cominge,
were moved by soch things to search further of Christ's secrettes. And though
God would not have the secrettes of Christ generallye known, save unto a few
familier friends which in that infancye he made of man's wit to help the
other babes: yet as they had a general promysse that one of the seed of
Abraham should come and bless them, even so they had a general faith that God
would by the same man save them, though they wist not by what means as the very
apostles when it was often told them yet they could never comprehend it, till it
was fufilled in dead.

And beyond all this their sacrifices and ceremonies as farforth as the
promyses annexed unto them extend / so farforth they saved the^ and justified
them and stood them in the same stead as our sacraments do us: not by the
power of the sacrifice or dead it self, but by the virtue of the faith in the
promysse which the sacrifice or ceremonye preached and whereof it was a token
or sign. For the ceremonies and sacrifices were left with them and commanded
them to keep the promysse in remembrance and to wake up their faith. As it is
not enough to send many on errandes and to tell them what they shall do: but
they must have a remembrance with them, and it be but a ringe of a rush about
one of their fingers. And as it is not enough to make a bargayne with words
only, but we must put thereto an oath and give ernest to confirm the faith
off the person with whom it is made. And in like manner if a man promysse, what
soever trifull it be, it is not believed except he hold up his finger also,
soch is the wekenesse of the world. And therefore christ him silf used oftymes
diverse ceremonies in curing the s^ke, to stir up their faith with all. As
for an ^nsample it was not the blood of the lamb that saved the^ in Egipte,
when the angel smote the Egiptians: but the mercy of God and his truth whereof
that blood was a token and remembrance to stir up their faythes with all.
For though God make a promysse, yet it saves none finallye but them that long
for it and pray God with a strong faith to fulfill it for his mercy and
truth only and knowledge their unworthiness. And even so our sacraments (if
they be truly ministered) preach Christ unto us and lead our faythes unto
Christ, by which faith our sins are done away and not by the dead or
work of the sacrament. For as it was impossible that the blood off calves
should put away sin: even so is it impossible that the water of the river
should wash our hearts. Nevertheless the sacraments cle^se us and absolve us
of our sins as the preastes do, in preachinge of repentance and faith, for
which cause either other of them were ordened, but if they preach not, whether
it be the preast or the sacrament, so profitte they not.

And if a man allege Christ Johan in the. iij* chapter saying: Except a man be
borne again of water and the holy ghost he can not se the kingdom of God,
and will therefore that the holy ghost is present in the water and therefore the
very dead or work does put away sin: then I will send him unto Paul
which axeth his Galathians whether they received the holy ghost by the dead
of the law or by preachinge of faith and there concludes that the holy ghost
acco^panyeth the preaching of faith, and with the word of faith, enters the
heart and purges it, which thou may also understand by saint Paul saying:
ye are borne a new out of the water through the word. So now if baptim preach
me the wasshing in christ's blood, so does the holy ghost accompa^y it and that
dead of preachinge through faith does put away my sins. For the holy ghost is
no dome god nor no god that goes a mummige. If a man say of the sacrament of
Christ's body and blood that it is a sacrifice as well for the dead as for the
quycke and therefore the very deed it self justifies and puts away sin. I
answer that a sacrifice is the sleynge off the body of a be or a man:
wherefore if it be a sacrifice, then is christ's body there slain and his
blood there shed: but that is not so. And therefore it is properly no sacrifice
but a sacrament and a memorial of that everlasting sacrifice once for all
which he offered upon the cross now upon a.xv. hundred years a go and
preaches only unto them that are alive. And as for them that be dead, it is as
profitable unto them as is a candell in a lantrene without light unto them that
walk by the way in a dark night, and as the gospel song in laten is unto
them that understand none at all, and as a sermon preached to him that is dead
and hereth it not. It preaches unto them that are a live only, for they that
be dead, if they dyed in the faith which that sacrament preaches, they be
faffe and are past all i^opardye. For when they were alive their hearts loved
the law off God and therefore sinned not, and were sorry that their members
sinned and ever moved to sin, and therefore through faith it was forgeuen them.
And now their synnefull members be dead, so that they can now sin no more,
wherefore it is unto them that be dead nether sacrament nor sacrifice: But under
the pretense of their soul health it is a servaunt unto our spiritualtyes
holy coue^nousnesse and an extorcyonar and a bylder of Abayes, Colleges,
Chauntryes and cathedral chirches with false gote^ good, a pick purse, a
pollar, and a bottomless bag

Some man would happily say, that the prayers of the mass help much: not the
lyuinge only, but also the dead. Of the hot fire of their farvent prayer which
consumes faster then all the world is able to bring sacrifice, I have said
sufficiently in other places. How be it it is not possible to bring me in
beleffe that the prayer which helps h^^ own master unto no virtue, should
purchesse me the forgeuesse of my sins. If I saw that their prayers had
obtained the^ grace to live soch a liffe as gods word did not rebuke, then
coud I sone be borne in hand that what soever they axed off God their prayers
should not be in vain. But now what good can he wysh me in his prayers that
envieth me Christ the fode and the liffe of my soul? What good can he wish me
whose heart cleaves a sundre for pain when I am taught to repent of my evil?

Forthermore because that few know the use of the old testament, and the
most part think it nothing necessary but to make all goryes, which they
feign every man after his own brain at all wyle adve^ture without any
certain rule: therefore (though I have spoken off them in another place) yet
lest the book come not to all men's hands that shall read this, I will
speak off them here also a word or twain.

We had need to take heed every where that we be not begyled with false
allegories, whether they be drawn out of the new testament, or the old, either
out of any other storye or off the creatures of the world, but namely in this
book. Here a man had need to put on all his spectacles and to arm him self
agenst invisible spretes.

First allegories prove nothing (and by allegories understand examples or
similitudes borrowed of strange matters and of another thing than that thou
entreatest often) As though circumcysyon be a figure of baptim, yet thou can
not prove baptim by circumcysion For this argument were very feeble, the
Israelites were circu^cysed therefore we must be baptized. And in like manner
though the offering of Isaac were a figure or ensample often the resurrection,
yet is this argument naught, Abraham would have offered Isaac, but God delivered
him from death, therefore we shall rise again, and so forth in all other.

But the very use of allegories is to declare and open a text that it may be
the better perceaved and understand. As when I have a clear text of Christ
and of the apostles, that I must be baptized, then I may borowe an ensample of
circumcysion to express the nature power and fruit or effect of baptim. For
as circumcysion was unto them a common bag sygnifienge that they were all
sodiars off God to war his war and separatinge them from all other nacyons
disobedient unto God: even so baptim is our comen bag and sure ernest and
perpetual memorial that we pertayne unto Christ and are separated from all
that are not christ's. And as circumcision was a token certifyenge them that
they were received unto the favor off God and their sinner forgeven them:
even so baptim certefyeth us that we are washed in the blood of christ and
received to favor for his sake. and as circumcysion signified unto the^ the
cuttynge away of their own lusts and sleynge of their fre will, as they call
it, to follow the will of god even so baptim signyfgeth unto us repentance and
the mortefyinge of our unruly me^bres and body of sin, to walk in a new
lyffe and so forth.

And likewise though that the savinge of Noe and of them that were with him in
the ship, through water, is a figure, that is to say an ensample and
likeness of baptim, as Peter makes it. 1. Petri 3. yet I can not prove baptim
therewith, save describe it only. for as the sheyppe saved the^ in the water
through faith, in that they beleved god and as the other that would not beleve
Noe peryshed: even so baptim saves us through the word of faith which it
preaches when all the world of the vnbelevinge perysh. And Paul. 1. Corin.
10. makes the sea and the cloud a figure of baptim, by which and a thousand
mo I might declare it but not prove it. Paul also in the said place makes
the rock out of which Moses brought water unto the childerne of Israel a
figure or ensample of christ / not to prove christ (for that were impossible)
but to describe christ only: even as christ hisilf Ioha^nis. 3. boroweth a
similitude or figure of the brazen serpent to lead Nichodemus from his erthy
imaginacyon in to the spiritual understanding of christ saying: As Moses
lyftedvpp a serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up,
that none that believe in him perysh but have everlastinge liffe. by which
similitude the virtue of christ's death is better described then thou coudest
declare it with a thousand words. for as those murmurars agenst god as soon as they repented were healed of their deadly wounds through lokynge on the
brazen serpent only without medicyne or any other help, ye and without any
other reason but that god has said it should be so / and not to murmoure
again, but to leave their murmuringe: even so all that repent and believe in
christ are saved from everlasting death / of pure grace without and before
their good works / and not to sin again, but to fight against sin and
henceforth to sin no moare.

Even so with the ceremonies of this book thou can prove nothing save
describe and declare only the puttyng away. of our sins through the death of
christ. for christ is Aaron and Aarons sons and all that offer the sacrifyce
to purge sin, And christ is all mane^ offering that is offered: he is the
ox, the sheep the got, the kyd and lamb: he is the ox that is burnt without
the host and the escape got that carried all the sin of the people away in to
the wilderness. for as they purged the people from their wordly vnclennesses
through blood of the sacrifices / even so does christ purge us from the
vnclennesses of everlastinge death with his own blood. and as their wordly
sins could no otherwise be purged then by blood of sacrifyce / even so can
our sins be no otherwise forgeven then through the blood of christ. All the
deades in the world, save the blood of christ, can purchase no forgevenesse of
sins: for our deades do but help our neighbor and mortefye the flesh and
help that we sin no moare / but and if we have sinned / it must be freely
forgeven through the blood of christ or remain ever.

And in like manner of the lepers thou can prove nothing: thou can never
conjure ou^ confession thense, how be it thou have an handsome example there to
open the bindinge and lowsinge of our preastes with the kaye of gods word*
for as they made no man a lepre even so ours have no power to command any
man to be in sin or to go to purgatory or hell. And therefore (in as much as
bindinge and lowsinge is one power) As those preastes healed no man / even so
ours can not of their inviseble and domme power dryve any man's sins away
or delyver him from hell or feigned purgatory. how be it if they preached gods
word purely which is the authorite that christ gave them / then they should
bind and lowse / kylle and make alyve again, make uncle ^ne and clean again
/ and send to hell and fett thence again / so mighty is gods word. for if they
preached the law of god, they should bind the consciences of sinners with the
bonds of the pains of hell and bring them unto repentance. And then if they
preached them the mercy that is in christ / they should lowse them and quiet
their raginge consciences and certefie them of the favor of god and that
their sins be forgeven.

Fynallye beware of allegoryes / for there is not a moare handsome or apt a
thing to be gile withal then an allegorye / nor a more sotle and pestilent
thing in the world to persuade a false matter then an allegorye. And contrary
wise there is not a better / vehementer or myghtyer thing to make a man
understand with all then an allegory. For allegoryes make a man qwick witted
and prynte wisdom in him and makes it to abide, to here bare words go but in
at the one ear and out at the other. As this with soch like sayenges: put salt
to all your sacrifices, in stead of this sentence, do all your deades with
discrecion, greteth and biteth (if it be understand) moare the^ plain words.
And when I say in stead off these words bost not your self of your good
deades, eat not the blood nor the fatt of your sacrifice, there is as great
difference between them as there is distaunce between heaven and earth. For the
liffe and beutye of all good deades is of God and we are but the caren lean,
we are only the instrument whereby god works only, but the power is his. As
god created Paul a new, poured his wisdom in to him, gave him might and
promised him that his grace should never fail him etc. and all without
deservinges, except that nurteringe the saints and making them curse and
rail on Christ be meritorious. Now as it is death to eat the blood or fat
of any sacrifice, is it not (think ye) damnable to rob god of his honor
and to gloryfye my self with his honor?

The THIRD Book of Moses. Called Leuiticus.
The third book of Moses, called Leuiticus.
The first Chapter.
ANd the Lord called Moses, And spoke unto him out off the tabernacle of
witness saying, Speak unto the childern of Israel, and say unto them. Who
soever of you shall bring a gift unto the Lord, shall bring it of the
catell: even of the oxen and of the sheep.

If he bring a burntoffrynge of the oxen he shall offer a male without
blimesh, and shall bring* him to the door of the tabernacle of witness, that
he may be accepted before the Lord. And let him put his hand upon the heed
of the burntsacrifice, and favor shall be given him to make an attoneme^t for
him, and let him kill the ox before the Lord. And let the preastes Aarons
sons bring the blood and let them sprinckell it round about upon the
alter that is before the door of the tabernacle of witness, And let the
burntoffrynges be strypped and hewed in pieces. And the^ let the sons of Aaron
the preast put fire apo^ the alter and put wodd upon the fire, and let them
lay the pieces with the heed and the fat, upon the wod that is on the fire in
the alter. But the inwardes and the legs they shall wash in water, and the
preast shall burn altogether upon the alter, that it be a burntsacrifice, and
an offering of a sweet odoure unto the Lord.

If he will offer a burntsacrifice of the sheep whether it be of the lambs or
of the gootes: he shall offer a male without blimesh. And let him kill it on
the north side of the alter, before the Lord. And let the preastes Aarons
sons sprinkle the blood of it, round about upon the alter. And let it be
cut in pieces: even with his heed and his fat, and let the preast put them
upon the wodd that lies upon the fire in the alter. But let him wash the
inwardes and the legs with water, and than bring altogether and burn it
upon the alter: that is a burntoffrynge and a sacrifice of sweet sauoure unto
the Lord.

If he will offer a burntoffrynge of the fowls he shall offer either of the
turtyll doves or of the ionge pigeons. And the preast shall bring it unto the
alter, and wrynge the neck a sundre of it, and burn it on the alter, and let
the blood run out upon the sides of the alter, and pluck away his croppe
and his feathers, and cast the^ beside the alter on the east part upon the
hepe of ashes, and break his wings but pluck the^ not a sundre. And the^ let
the preast burn it upon the alter, eue^ apo^ the wodd that lies apo^ the
fire, a burntsacrifice and an offering of a sweet sauoure unto the Lord.

The second Chapter.
IF any soul will offer a meatoffrynge unto the Lord, his offering shall be
fine flower, and he shall pour thereto oil and put frankencens thereon and
shall bring it unto Aarons sons the preastes. And one of them shall take
thereout his handful of the flower, and of the oil with all the frankence^s,
and burn it for a memorial apo^ the alter: an offryng of a sweet sauoure unto
the Lord. And the re^naunt of the meatofferynge shall be Aarons and his sons,
as a thing most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord.

If any man bring a meatoffrynge that is bake^ in the oue^, let him bring
sweet cakes of fine flower mingled with oil, and vnleuended wafers anointed
with oil. If thy meatoffrynge be baken in the fryenge pan, then it shall be of
sweet flower mingled with oil. And thou shall mynce it small, and pour oil
thereon: and so is it a meatoffrynge.

If thy meatofferynge be a thing broyled upon the greadyerne, of flower
myngled with oil it shall be. And thou shall bring the meatoffryng that is made
of these things unto the Lord, and shall deliver it unto the preast, and he
shall bring it unto the altar and shall heue up part of the meatoffrynge
for a memorial, and shall burn it upon the alter: an offering of a sweet
sauoure unto the Lord. And that which is left of the meatofferynge shall be
Aarons and his sons, as a thing that is most holy of the offerynges off the
Lord.

All the meatoffrynges which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made
without leue^. For ye shall nether burn leven nor honye in any offering of
the Lord* Notwithstondinge ye shall bring the firstlings of them unto the
Lord: But they shall not come upon the alter to make a sweet sauoure.

All thy meatofferynges thou shall salt with salt: nether shall thou soffre the
salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meatofferynge: but
upon all thine offerynges thou shall bring salt.

If thou offer a meatofferynge of the firstripe fruits unto the Lord, then
take of that which is yet grene and dry it by the fire and beat it small, and
so offer the meatofferynge of thy firstrype fruits. And than pour oil there
to, and put frankencens thereon: and so it is a meatoffrynge. And the preast
shall burn part of the beten corn and part of that oil, with all the
fra^kencens: for a remembrance. That is an offering unto the Lord.

The third Chapter
IF any man bring a peaceofferynge of the oxen: whether it be male or female,
he shall bring such as is without blemysh, before the Lord, and let him put
his hand upon the heed of his offering, and kill it before the door of the
tabernacle of witness. And Aarons sons the preastes, shall sprinkle the
blood upon the alter round about. And they shall offer of the peaceofferynge
to be a sacrifice unto the Lord: the fatt that covers the inwardes and all
the fatt that is upon the inwardes: and the two kydneys with the fatt that
lies upon the loins: and the kall that is on the liver, they shall take away
with the kydneyes. And Aarons sons shall burn them upon the alter with the
burntsacrifice which is upon the wodd on the fire. That is a sacrifice of a
sweet sauoure unto the Lord.

If a man bring a peaceoffrynge unto the Lord from of the flock: whether it
be male, or female, it shall be without blemysh. If he offer a lamb, he shall
bring it before the Lord and put his hand upon his offrynges heed / and kill
it in the door off the tabernacle off witness / and Aarons sons shall
sprinkle the blood thereof round about the alter.

And of the peaseoffringe they shall bring a sacrifyce unto the Lord: the
fatt there of and the rompe altogether, which they shall take off hard by the
back bone: and the fatt that coue reth the inwardes and all the fatt that is
upon the inwardes and the* ij. kydneyes with the fatt that lies upon them and
upon the loins, and the kall that is upon the liver he shall take away with
the kydneyes. And the preast shall burn them upon the alter to feed the Lords
offrynge with all.

If the offrynge be a goote, he shall bring it before the Lord and put his
hand upon the head of it and kill it before the tabernacle of witness / and
the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the alter round
about. And he shall bring thereof his offrynge unto the Lords sacrifyce: the
fatt that covers the inwardes and all the fatt that is apo^ the inwardes and
the* ij. kydneyes and the fatt that lies upon them and upon the loins, and
the kall that is apo^ the liver he shall take away with the kydneyes. And the
preast shall burn them apo^ the alter to feed the Lords sacrifyce with all
and to make a sweet sauoure. And thus shall all the fatt be the Lords / and it
shall be a la we forever among your generacions after you in your dwelling
places: that ye eat nether fatt nor blood.

The.IIII. Chapter.
ANd the Lord talked with Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say: when a soul synneth through ignorance and has done any of those things
which the Lord has forbidden in his commaundmentes to be done: If the preast
that is anointed sin and make the people to do amysse / he shall bring for
his sin which he has done: an ox without blemysh unto the Lord for a
synneoffrynge. And he shall bring the ox un to the door of the tabernacle of
witness before the Lord, and shall put his hand upon the oxes head and kill
him before the Lord. And the preast that is anointed shall take of the oxes
blood and bring it in to the tabernacle of witness and shall dip his
finger in the blood and sprinkle thereof.vij. times before the Lord: even
before the hanging of the holy place. And he shall put some of the blood upon
the horns of the alter of sweet cens before the Lord which is in the
tabernacle of witness, and shall pour all the blood of the ox upon the
botome of the alter of burntofferynges which is by the door of the tabernacle
of witness. And he shall take away all the fatt of the ox that is the
synneofferynge: the fatt that covers the inwardes and all the fatt that is
about them, and the.ij. kydneyes with the fatt that lies upon the^ and upon
the loins, and the kall upon the liver let them take away also with the
kydneyes: as it was taken from the ox of the peaceoffrynge and let the preast
burn them upon the altar of burntofferynges. But the skin of the ox and
all his flesh with his heed, his legs, his inwardes with his donge, shall he
carye altogether out of the host unto a clean place: even where the ashes are
poured out, and burn h^ on wodd with fire: even upon the heap of ashes.

If the hole comynalte of the childern of Israel sin through ygnoraunce and
the thing be hyd from their eyes: so that they have committed any of these
things which the Lord has forbidden to be done in his commaundmentes and
have offended, and the sin which they have sinned be afterward known, than
shall they offer an ox for a synneofferynge and shall bring him before the
tabernacle of witness, and the elders of the multitude shall put their hands
upon his heed before the Lord And the preast that is anointed shall bring of
his blood in to the tabernacle of witness, and shall dip his finger in the
blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord: even before the uayle.
And shall put of the blood upon the horns of the alter which is before the
Lord in the tabernacle of witness, and shall pour all the blood upon the
botome of the alter of burntoffrynges which is by the door of the tabernacle of
witness, and shall take all his fatt from him and burn it upon the altar,
and shall do with his ox as he did with the synneoffrynge ox. And the preast
shall make an atonement for them, and so it shall be forgeuen them. And he shall
bring the ox without the host, and burn him as he burned the first, so is
this the synneofferynge of the comynalte.

When a Lord synnneth and commits through ignorance any of these things
which the Lord his God has forbidden to be done in his commaundmentes and
has so offended: when his sin is showed unto him which he has sinned, he
shall bring for his offering an he goote without blemysh and lay his hand
upon the heed of it, and kill it in the place where the burntofferynges are
killed before the Lord: this is a synneoffrynge. Tha^ let the preast take of
the blood of the synneoffrynge with his finger, and put it upon the horns of
the burntofferyngalter, and pour his blood upon the botome of the
burntofferyngealter and burn all his fatt upon the alter as he does the fatt
of the peaceofferynges. And the preast shall make an atonement for him as
concerning his sin, and so it shall be forgeuen him.

If one of the come^ people of the land sin through ignorance and commit
any off the things which the Lord has forbidden, in his commandments to
be done and so has trespased, when his sin which he has sinned is come to
his knowledge, he shall bring for his offering, a she goote without blemish
for his sin which he has sinned, and lay his hand upon the heed of the
synneofferynge and slay it in the place of burntoffrynges. And the preast shall
take of the blood with his finger and put it apo^ the horns of the
burntoffryngealter and pour all the blood apo^ the botome of the alter, and
shall take away all his fatt as the fatt of the peaceoffrynges is taken away.
And the preast shall burn it apo^ the alter for a sweet sauoure unto the Lord,
and ^he preast shall make an attoneme^t for him and ^ shall be forgeuen him.

if he bring a sheep and offer it for a synneofferynge, he shall bring a yewe
without blemi^h and lay his hand upon the heed of the synneofferynge and slay
it in the place where the burntoffrynges are slain. And the preast shall take
of the blood of the synneofferynge with his finger, and put it apo^ the horns
of the burntoffryngealter, and shall pour all the blood thereof unto the
botome of the alter. And he shall take away all the fatt thereof, as the fat
of the sheep of the peaceoffringes was taken away. And the preast shall burn
it apo^ the alter for the lords sacrifice, and the preast shall make an
attoneme^t for his sin, and it shall be forgeuen him.

The, v. Chapter.
^He^ a soul has sinned and herd the voice of cursyng and is a witness:
whether he has seen or known of it if he have not uttered it, he shall beat
his sin. Either when a man touches any unclean thing: whether it be the
caryon of an unclean be or of unclean ca^ell or unclean worm and is not
war of it, he is also unclean and has offended. Either when he touches any
uncleanness of man (what soever uncleanness it be that a man is defiled with
all) and is not war of it and afterward comes to the knowledge of it, he is
a t^^spaser. Either when a soul swears: so thathe pronounces with his lips
to do evil or to do good (what soever it be that a man prouounceth with an
oath) and the thing be out of his mind and afterward comes to the knowledge
of it, than he has offended in one of these.

Than when he has sinned in one of these things, he shall confess that
wherein that he has sinned, and shall bring his trespace offering unto the
Lord for his sin which he has sinned. A female from the flock, whether it
be an yewe or a she goote, for a synneofferynge. And the preast shall make an
atonement for him for his sin. But if he be not able to bring a sheep, then
let him bring for his trespace which he has sinned, two turtyll doves or two
young pygeons unto the Lord one for a synneoffrynge and another for a
burntofferynge. And he shall bring them unto the preast, which shall offer the
synneoffrynge first and wringe the neck a sundre of it, but pluck it not
clean of. And let him sprinkle of the blood of the synneofferynge upon the
side of the alter, and let the rest of the blood blede upon the botome of the
alter, and than it is a synneofferynge. And let him offer the second for a
burntoffrynge as the manner is: and so shall the preast make an atonement for
him for the sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgeuen him.

And yet if he be not able to bring.ij. turtyll doves or two young pigeons,
then let him bring his offering for his sin: the tenth part of an Epha of
fine flower for a synneofferynge, but put none oil thereto nether put any
frankencens thereon, for it is a synneofferinge. And let him bring it to the
preast, and the preast shall take his handful of it and burn it upon the
alter for a remembrance to be a sacryflce for the Lord: that is a
synneoffrynge. And let the preast make an atonement for him for his sin (what
soever of these he has sinned) and it shall be forgeuen. And the remnau^te
shall be the preastes, as it is in the meat offering.

And the Lord comyned with Moses saying: when a soul trespaceth and synneth
through ignorance in any of the holy things of the Lord, he shall bring for
his trespace unto the Lord, a ram without blymesh out of the flock valowed at
two sycles after the holy sycle, for a trespaceofferynge. And he shall make
amends for the harm that he has done in the holy thing, and put the fifte
part moare to and give it unto the preast. And the preast shall make an
attoneme^t for him with the ram of the trespaceofferynge, and it shall be
forgiven him.

When a soul synneth and commits any of these things which are forbidden
to be done by the co^maundmentes of the Lord: though he wist it not, he has
yet offended and is *
in sin, and shall bri^ge a ram without blymesh out of the flock that is
esteemed to be worth a synneofferynge, unto the preast. And the preast shall
make an atonement for him for the ignorance which he did and was not ware,
and it shall be forgeuen him. This is a trespaceofferynge, for he trespaced
against the Lord.

And the Lord talked with Moses saying: when a soul synneth and trespaceth
against the Lord and denied unto his neighbor that which was taken him to
^epe, or that was put under his hand, or that which he has violently taken
away, or that which he has deceived his neighbor off with sotylte, or has
found that which was lost and denies it, and swereth falsely, in what
soever thing it be that a man does and synneth therein, Then when he has
sinned or trespaced, he shall restore again that he took violently away, or
the wrong which he did, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost
thing which he found, or what soever it be about Unto my neybour pertayneth
sault ^^^o^, but unto god repentance: and the^ the sacrifice or christ's
blood is a ^^^ satisfaccion, and attoneme^t ^d a pealinge of alwrath.
which he has sworn falsely, * he shall restore it again in the whole su^me
and shall add the fifte part moare thereto and give it unto him to whom it
pertayneth, the same day that he offers for his trespace, and shall bring
for his trespace offering unto the Lord, a ram without blymesh out of the
flock, that is esteemed worth a trespaceofferynge unto the preast. And the
pressed shall make an atoneme^t for him before the Lord, and it shall be
forgiven hi^ in what soever thing it be that a man does and trespaceth therein.

The.vj. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying. Command Aaron and his sons saying:
this is the law of the burntoffrynge. The burntofferynge shall be upon the herth
of the alter all night unto the morning, and the fire of the alter shall
burn therein. And the preast shall put on his lynen albe and his lynen breches
upon his flesh, and take away the ashes which the fire of the burntsacrifice
in the altar has made, and put them beside the alter, and the^ put off his
rayme^t and put on other and carye the ashes out without the host unto a
clean place.

The fire that is upon the alter shall burn therein and not goo out. And the
preast shall put wodd on the fire every morninge and put the burntsacrifice
upon it, and he shall burn thereon the fatt of the peaceofferynges. The fire
shall ever burn upon the alter and never goo out.

This is the law of the meatoffrynge: Aarons sons shall bring it before the
Lord, unto the alter: and one of them shall take his handful of the flower of
the meatoffrynge and of the oil with all the frankencens which is thereon and
shall burn it unto a remembrance upon the alter to be a sweet sauoure of the
memorial of it unto the Lord. And the rest the reof, Aaron and his sons
shall eat: vnleuended it shall be eaten in the holy place: eue^ in the court of
the tabernacle of witness they shall eat it. Their part which I have given
them of my sacrifice, shall not be baken with leven, for it is most holy, as
is the synneofferynge, and trespaceoffrynge. All the males among the childern
of Aaron, shall eat of it: and it shall be a duty for ever unto your
generacyons of the sacrifices of the Lord, nether shall any man twytche it, but
he that is hallowed.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: this is the offrynge of Aaron and of
his sons which he shall offer unto the Lord in the day when they are
anointed: the tenth part of an Epha of flower, which is a daily meatofferinge
perpetually: half in the morninge and half at night: and in the fryenge pan
it shall be made withoyle. And when it is fried, thou snalt bring it in as a
baken meatofferynge mynsed small, and shall offer it for a sweet sauoure unto
the Lord. And that preast of his sons that is anointed in his stead, shall
offer it: and it shall be the lords duty for ever, and it shall be burnt
altogether. For all the meatoffrynges of the preastes shall be burnt altogether,
and shall not be eaten.

And the Lord talked with Moses saying: speak unto Aaron and unto his sons
and say. This is the law of the synneoffrynge, In the place where the
burntofferynge is killed, shall the synneofferynge be killed also before the
Lord, for it is most holy. The preast that offers it shall eat it in the
holy place: eve^ in the court of the tabernacle of witness Noman shall
touch the flesh thereof, save he that is hallowed. And if any raiment be
sprynckled therewyth, it shall be washed in an holy place, and the erthe^ pott
that it is sodde^ in shall be broken. If it be sodden in brass, then the pott
shall be scoured and plunged in the water. All the males among the childern of
Aaron shall eat thereof, for it is most holy. Notwithsto^dinge no
synneofferynge that has his blood brought in to the tabernacle of witness to
reconcyle with all in the holy place, shall be eaten: but shall be burnt in the
fire.

The.vij. Chapter.
THis is the law of the trespace offering which is most holy. In the place
where the burntoffrynge is killed, the trespace offrynge shall be killed also:
and his blood shall be sprikled round about upon the alter. And all the fatt
thereof shall be offered: the rompe and the fatt that covered the inwardes, and
the.ij. kydneyes with the fatt that lies on them and upon the loins: and the
kall on the liver shall be taken away with the kydneyes, And the preast shall
burn them upon the altar, to be an offering unto the Lord: this is a
trespace offering.

All the males among the preastes shall eat thereof in the holy place, for it
is most holy. As the sin offering is, so is the trespace offering, one law
serves for both: and it shall be the preastes that reconcyleth therewith.

And the preast that offered a man's burntofferynge, shall have the skyn of the
burntofferynge which he has offered. And all the meatofferynges that are baken
in the oven, and all that is dressed upon the gredyerne and in the fryenge pan,
shall be the preastes that offers them. And all the meatofferynges that are
myngled with oil or dry, shall pertayne unto all the sons of Aaron, and one
shall have as much as another.

This is the law of the peaceoffringes which shall be offered unto the Lord.
If he offer to give thanckes, he shall bring unto his thanckofferynge: sweet
cakes myngled with oil and sweet wafers anointed with oil, and cakes myngled
with oil of fine flower fried, and he shall bring his offering upon cakes
made of leuended bred unto the thanckoffrynge of his peaceofferynges, and of
them all he shall offer one to be an heueoffrynge unto the Lord, and it shall be
the preastes that sprynkleth the blood of the peaceofferynges. And the flesh
of the thankofferynge of his peaceofferynges shall be eaten the same day that it
is offered, and there shall none of it be laid up until the morning.

If it be a vow or a fre willofferynge that he brings, the same day that he
offers it, It shall be eaten, and that which remains may be eaten on the
morrow: but as much of the offered flesh as remaneth unto the third day
shall be burned with fire. For if any of the flesh of the peaceoffrynges be eaten
the third day then shall he that offered it obtain no favor, nether shall
it be rekened unto him: but shall be an abhomynacion, and the soul that eats
of it shall bear the sin thereof.

The flesh that twycheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten. but burnt with
fire: and all that be clean in their flesh, may eat flesh. If any soul eat
of the flesh of the peaceofferynges, that pertayne unto the Lord and his
uncleanness yet upon him, the same soul shall perisshe from among his peoole.
Moreover if a soul twych any unclean thing, whether it be the uncleanness of
man or of any unclean be or any abhominacion that is unclean: and the^ eat
of the flesh of the peaceoffrynges which pertayne unto the Lord, that soul
shall perissh from his people.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say. Ye shall eat no manner fatt of oxen, sheep or gootes: never the later the
fatt of the beast that dies alone and the fatt of that which is torn with
wild beestes, may be occupide in all manner uses: but ye shall in no wise eat
of it. For whosoever eats the fatt of the beast of which me^ bring an offering
unto the Lord, that soul that eats it shall perissh from his people.
Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, wheresoever ye dwell, whether it be
of foul or of be. What soever soul it be that eats any manner of blood
the same soul shall perisshe from his people.

And the Lord talked with Moses saying: speak unto the children of Israel
and say He that offers his peaceofferynge unto the Lord, shall bring his
gift unto the Lord of his peaceoffrynges: his own hands shall bring the
offrynge of the Lord: eue^ the fatt apo^ the breast he shall bring with the
breast to wave it a waueoffrynge before the Lord. And the preast shall burn
the fatt upon the alter, and the breast shall be Aaro^s and his sons. And the
right shulder they shall give unto the preast, to be an heueoffrynge, of their
peaceoffringes. And the same that offreth the blood of the peaceoffringes and
the fatt, among the sons of Aaron, shall have the right shulder unto his
part, for the wauebrest and the heueshulder I have taken of the childern of
Israel, even of their peace offringes, and have given it unto Aaron the pressed
and unto his sons: to be a duty for ever of the childern of Israel.

This is the anoyntinge of Aaron and of the sacryfices of the Lord, in the
day when they were offered to be preastes unto the Lord, which the Lord
commanded to be given them in the day when he anointed them, of the childern
of Israel, and to be a duty for ever among their generacions. This is the
law of burntoffrynges, of meatoffrynges, of sin offrynges, of
trespaceoffrynges, of full offrynges, of peaceoffrynges, which the Lord
commanded Moses in the mount of Sinai, in the day when he commanded the
childern of Israel to offer their offrynges unto the Lord in the wilderness
of Sinai.

The.viij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Hence the pope fett holowenge of
chirches, alters, font, belles and so forth, and the anoyntinge of bissnopes
preastes, and soch like.
take Aaron and his sons with hi^, and the vestures and the anoyntinge oil,
and an ox for a synneofferynge and two rams and a baskett of sweet bred: and
gather all the comentye together unto the door of the tabernacle of witness.
And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the people gathered them selves
together unto the door of the tabernacle of witness. And Moses said unto the
people: this is the thing which the Lord commanded to do.

And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water, and put
upon him the albe and gyrde him with a girdel and put upon him the tunycle and
put the Ephod thereon, and gyrded him with the broderd girdel of the Ephod, and
bound it unto him therewith. And he put the brestlappe thereon, and put in the
brestlappe light and perfectness. And he put the myter upon his heed and put
apo^ the myter eue^ apo^ the forefro^t of it, the golden plate of the holy
croune, as the Lord commanded Moses.

And Moses took the anoyntynge oil and anointed the habitacion and all that
was therein and sanctified them, and sprynkled thereof upon the alter.vij.
times and anointed the alter and all his vessels, and the lauer with his foot,
to sanctify them. And he poured of the anoyntynge oil upon Aarons heed and
anointed him to sanctify him. And he brought Aarons sons and put albes upon
them, and gyrde them with gyrdels, and put bonettes apo^ their heedes: as the
Lord commanded Moses

And the synneoffrynge was brought. And Aaron and his sons put their hands
upon the heed of the ox of the synneoffryng. And when it was slain, Moses
took of the blood, and put it upon the horns of the alter round about with
his finger and purified it, and poured the blood unto the botome of the alter
and sanctified it and reconcyled it. And he took all the fatt that was upon the
inwardes and the kal that was on the liver and the two kydneyes with their fatt
and burned it apo^ the alter. But the ox, the hide, his flesh and his donge,
he burnt with fire without the host, as the Lord commanded Moses.

And he brought the ram of the burntofferynge, and Aaron and his sons put
their hands upon the heed of the ram, and it was killed. And Moses sprinkled
the blood apo^ the alter round about, and cut the ram in pieces and burnt the
heed, the pieces and the fat, and washed the inwardes and the legs in
water, and burnt the ram every whitt apo^ the alter. That was a burntsacrifice
of a sweet sauoure and an offrynge unto the Lord, as the Lord commanded
Moses.

And he brought the other ram that was the fullofferynge, and Aaron and his
sons put their hands apo^ the heed of the ram: And when it was slain, Moses
took of the blood of it, and put it upon the typpe of Aarons right ear and
upon the thombe of his right hand and upon the great too of his right foot.
Then were Aarons sons brought, and Moses put of the blood on the typpe of
the right care of them, and upon the thombes of their right hands, and upon
the great tooes of the ir right fete, and sprinkled the blood apo^ the alter
round about.

And he took the fatt and the rompe and all the fatt that was upon the
inwardes, and the kall of the liver, and the.ij. kydneyes with their fatt and
their right shulder. And out of the basket of sweet bred that was before the
Lord, he took one sweet cake of oyled bred and one wa^er, and put the^ on the
fatt and upon the right shulder, and put altogether apo^ Aarons hands and
apo^ his sons hands, and waued it a waueofferynge before the Lord. And tha^
Moses took the^ from of their hands again and burnt the^ apo^ the alter, even
upon the burntoffrynge: These are the fulloffrynges of a sweet sauoure and a
sacrifice unto the Lord.

And Moses took the breast and waued it a waueoffrynge before the Lord, of the
ram of the fuloffrynges: and it was Moses part, as the Lord commanded Moses.

And Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the
alter, and sprinkled it apo^ Aaron and upon his vestime^tes and apo^ his sons
and on their vestime^tes with hi^ and sanctified Aaron and his vesturs and his
sons and his sons vestures also. Then Moses say de unto Aaron and his
sons: boil the flesh in the door of the tabernacle of witness, and there
eat it with the bred that is in the basket of fullofferynges, as the Lord
commanded saying. Aaron and his sons shall eat it: and that which
remains of the flesh and of the bread, burn with fire.

And se that ye depart not from the door of the tabernacle of witness seven
days long: until the days of your fullofferynges be at an end. For.vij.
days must your hands be filled, as they were this day: eue^ so the Lord
has commanded to do, to reconcyle you with all. Se therefore that ye abide in
the door of the tabernacle of witness day and night seven days long: and
keep the watch of the Lord that ye dye not: for so I am commanded. And Aaron
and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.

The.ix. Chapter.
ANd the.viij. day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
and said unto Aaron: take a calfe for a sin offrynge, and a ram for a
burntoffrynge: both without blemish, and bring them before the Lord. And unto
the childern of Israel he spoke saying: take ye an he goote for a
synneofferynge, and a calfe and a lamb both two of a year old, and without
blemysh for a burntsacrifice, and an ox and a ram for peaceoffrynges, to offer
before the Lord, and a meateofferyng myngled with oil, for to day the Lord
will appear unto you.

And they brought that which Moses commanded unto the tabernacle of witness,
and all the people came and stood before the Lord. And Moses said, this is
the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and then the glory of
the Lord shall appear unto you. And Moses said unto Aaron: go unto the alter
and offer thy synneofferynge, and make an atonement for the and for the
people: and then offer the offering of the people and reconcyle them also, as
the Lord commanded Moses.

And Aaron went unto the alter, and slew the calfe that was his synneoffrynge.
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dypte his finger
in the blood and put it upon the horns of the alter, and poured the blood
unto the botome of the alter. And the fatt and the two kydneyes with the kall
of the liver of the synneoffrynge, he burnt upon the alter, as the Lord
commanded Moses: but the flesh and the hyde / he burnt with fire without the
host.

After ward he slew the burntofferynge, and Aarons sons brought the blood
unto him, and he sprinkled it round about upon the alter. And they brought
the burntofferynge unto him in pieces and the heed also / and he burnt it upon
the alter / and did wasshe the inwardes and the legs / and burnt them also
upon the burntofferynge in the alter.

And than he brought the peoples offering and took the goote that was the
peoples synneofferynge / and slew it and offered it for a synofferynge: as he
did the first. And then brought the burntofferynge and offered it as the manner
was / and brought the meatofferynge and filled his hand thereof, and burnt it
upon the alter / besides the burntsacrifyce in the morning.

Then he slew the ox and the ram that were the peoples peaseofferynges / and
Aarons sons brought the blood unto him / and he sprinkled it upon the alter
round about, and took the fatt of the ox and of the ram: the ro^pe and the
fatt that covers the inwardes and the kydneyes and the kall of the liver: and
put them upon the breasts and burnt it upon the alter: but the breasts and the
right shulders Aaron waued before the Lord / as the Lord commanded Moses.

And Aaron lift up his hand over the people Of soch places the bisshopes
took their domme blessing with ij fingers: But numery. v^. thou may read the
goodly prayer of his blessing
and blessed the^, and came down from offering of synofferynges /
burntofferynges and peaseofferynges. Then Moses and Aaron went into the
tabernacle of witness and came out again and blessed the people / and the
glory of the Lord apered unto all the people. And there came a fire out from
before the Lord / and consumed upon the alter: the burntofferynge and the
fatt. And all the people saw it and showted, and fell on their faces.

The.X. Chapter
Hereof ye se the fruit of a man's good intent with out Godsword. As we may do
nolesse, so does this ensample teach that we may do no moare than is
commanded.
ANd Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron took either of them his censor and put
fire therein and put cens apo^, and brought strange fire before the Lord:
which he commanded the^ not and there went a fire out from the Lord and
consumed the^ / and they dyed before the Lord. Then Moses said unto Aaron
this is it that the Lord spoke saying: I will be God is sanctified when we
obey him and mortify our will to do his.
sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be
glorified. And Aaron held his pease.

And Moses called Misael and Elesapha^ the sons of Vsiel the uncle of Aaron,
and said unto the^: goo to and carye your brethren from the holy place out of
the host. And they went to them and carried them in their albes out of the
host, as Moses bad.

And Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and Ithamar his eldest sons:
uncover not your heed nether rent your clothes / lest ye dye and wrath come
upon all the people lettyoure brethren the hole house of Israel / bewepe the
burning which the Lord has burnt. But goo ye not out from the door of the
tabernacle of witness / lest ye dye: for the anoyntynge oil of the Lord is
upon you. And they did as Moses bad.

And the Lord spoke unto Aaron saying: Our prelates be dr^^ke with desire of
honor and have brought the world out of their wits to satisfy their
lusts, and live not sobirly to teach us what christ commanded by the (...) of
the appostels.
drink no wine nor strong drink / nether thou nor thy sons with the: when
ye go in to the tabernacle of witness / lest ye dye. And let it be a law
forever unto your childern after you: that ye may put difference between holy
and unholy / and between unclean and clean / and that ye may teach the
childern of Israel: all the ordynaunces which the Lord has commanded them by
the hands of Moses.

And Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and Ithamar his sons that were
left: take the meatofferynge that remains of the sacrifyces of the Lord /
and eat it without leven beside the alter / for it is most holy: eat it
therefore in the holy place, because it is thy duty and thy sons duty of the
sacrifyce of the Lord: for so I am commanded. And the wauebrest and
heueshulder eat in a clean place: both thou and thy sons and thy daughters
with the. For it is thy duty and thy sons duty with the, of the
peaceofferynges off the childern of Israel. For the heueshulder and the
wauebrest which they bring with the sacrifices of the fatt, to wave it before
the Lord, shall be thine and thy sons with the, and be a law for ever, as the
Lord has commanded.

And Moses sought for the goote that was the synneofferynge, and se, it was
burnt. And he was angrye with Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron, which
were left alive saying: wherefore have ye not eaten the synneofferynge in the
holy place, seeing it is most holy: and for as much as it is given you to bear
the sin of the people, and make agreement for them before the Lord? Behold,
the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place therefore should ye
have eaten it in the holy place as I commanded. And Aaron said unto Moses:
behold, this day have they offered their The offeringes must have been eaten
in gladness: but Aaron could not but morn for his sons
synneoffrynge and their burntoffrynge before the Lord, and it is chanced me
after this manner. If I should eat of the synneofferynge to day, would the
Lord be content with all? And when Moses herd that, he was content.

The.xj. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron saying: speak unto the children of
Israel and say, these are the beestes which ye shall eat among all the
beestes that are on the earth: what soever has hoffe and dyuydeth it in to two
claws and cheweth cud among the beestes, that shall ye eat. Nevertheless,
these shall ye not eat of them that chewe cud and have hoffes. The camel, for
he cheweth cud but he deuydeth not the hoffe in to two claws therefore he shall
be unclean unto you. And the Conye, for he cheweth the cud but deuydeth not the
hoffe in to two claws, therefore he is unclean to you. And the hare, for he
likewise cheweth the cud, but deuydeth not the hoffe in to two claws, he is
therefore unclean to you. And the swyne, for though he deuyde the hoffe in to
two claws, yet he cheweth not the cud and therefore is unclean to you, Of their
flesh see that ye eat not and their carcasses se that ye twych no^ for they
are unclean to you.

These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: what soever has finnes and
skales in the waters, sees and ryuers, that shall ye eat. And all that have
not finnes and skales in the sees and ryuers of all that move and live in the
waters / shall ye abhor. Se that ye eat not of their flesh, and also that ye
abhor their carkases: for all that have no finnes nor scales in the waters,
shall be abhominacion unto you.

These are the fowls which ye shall abhor and which shall not be eaten, for
they are an abhominacion. The egle, the gooshauke, the cormoraunte, the kyte,
the vultur and all his kind and all kind of ravens, the estrich, the
nightcrowe, the cocow, the sparowhauke and all the kind: the little oule, the
storcke, the great oule the back, the pellicane, the pie, the heron, the lay
with the kind, the lappwynge and the swalowe. And all fowls that crepe and
goo apo^ all iiij. shall be an abhominacion unto you.

Yet these may ye eat of all the fowls that move and goo upon.iiij. fete:
even those that have no knees above upon their fete to lepe with all upon the
earth, even these of them ye may eat: the arbe and all his kind: the Soleam
with all his kind: the Hargol and all the kind, and the Hagab and all his
kind. Al other fowls that move and have.iiij. fete, shall be abhominacion unto
you. In soch ye shall be unclean whosoever touch the carkesse of the^ shall be
unclean unto the even, and whosoever bears the carkesse of the^, shall wash his
clothes and shall be unclean until even.

Among all manner beestes, they that have hoffes and deuyde them not in to two
claws or that chewe not the cud, shall be unclean unto you: and all that
twicheth them shall be uncle ne. And all that goes upon his hands among all
manner beestes that goo on all four, are unclean unto you: and as many as twych
their carkesses, shall be unclean until the even. And he that bears the
carkesse of them, shall wasshe his clothes and be unclean until the even / for
soch are unclean unto you.

And these are also unclene to you among the things that crepe upon the earth:
the wesell the mouse, the tode and all his kind, the hedgehogge, stellio, the
licerte, the snayle and the moule. These are unclean to you among all that
move, and all that twych them when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
even. And what soever any of the dead carkesses of them fall upon, shall be
unclean: what soever vessel of wodd it be, or raiment, or skin, or bag or
what soever thing it be that any work is wroughte with all. And they shall be
plunged in the water and be unclean until the eue^, and then they shall be clean
again.

All manner of erthen vessel where in to any of them falls, is unclean with
all that therein is: and ye shall break it. All manner meat that is eaten, if
any soch water come upon it, it shall be unclean. And all manner drink that is
dronke in all manner soch vessels, shall be unclean. And whether it be oven or
kettel, it shall be broken. For they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you:
Neuerthelater, yet the fountaynes and wells and pondes of water, shall be clean
still. But whosoever twycheth their carkesses, shall be unclean.

If the dead carkesse of any soch fall apo^ any seed used to sow, yt shall yet
be clean still: but and if any water be poured apo^ the seed and afterward the
dead carkesse of them fall thereon, then it shall be unclean unto you.

If any be of which ye eat dye, he that twitcheth the dead carkesse shall be
unclean un till the even. And he that eats of any soche dead carkesse, shall
wasshe his clothes and remain unclean until the even. And he also that
bears the carkesse of it, shall wasshe his clothes and be unclean until even.

All that scrauleth upon the earth, is an abhominacyon and shall not be eaten.
And what soever goes upon the breast and what soever goes upon.iiij. or moo
fete among all that scrauleth upon the earth, of that se ye eat not: for they
are abhomynable. Make not your souls abominable. Make not your souls
abhomynable with nothing that crepeth, nether make your souls unclean with
them: that ye should be defiled thereby.

For I am the Lord your God, be sanctified therefore that ye may be holy, for
I am holy: and defile not your souls with any manner thing that crepeth upon
the earth. For I am the Lord that brought you out of the land off Egipte to be
your God: be holy therefore, for I am holy.

This is the law of be and foul and off all manner thing that lives and
moves in the water and of all things that crepe apo^ the earth that ye may put
difference between unclean and clean, and between the beestes that are eaten
and the beestes that are not eaten.

The.xij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses and said: speak unto the childern of Israel
and say: when a woman has conceived and has borne a man child, she shall be
unclean.vij. days: even in like manner as when she is put aparte in time of her
natural disease. And in the viij. day the flesh of the childs foreskynne
shall be cut away. And she shall co^tynue in the blood of her
purifienge.xxxiij. days, she shall twytch no hallowed thing nor come in to the
sanctuary, until the time of her purifienge be out. If she bear a maydehilde,
then she shall be unclean two wekes as when she has her natural disease. And
she shall continue in the blood of her purifienge.lxvj. days.

And when the days of her purifienge are out: whether it be a son or a
daughter, she shall bring a lamb of one year old for a burntoffrynge and a
young pigeon or a turtill do ue for a synneoffrynge unto the door of the
tabernacle of witness unto the preast: which shall offer them before the Lord
and make an atonement for her, and so she shall be purged of her issue of

female.

But and if she be not able to bring a sheep, then let her bring two turtyls
or two young pigeons: the one for the burntofferynge, and the other for the
synneofferynge. And the preast shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be
clean.

The.xiij. Chapter. This chapter makes not for confession in the ear, but is
an example of excomunicacion off opcusumers

ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron saying: when there apeareth
arysinge in any ma^s flesh either a scabbe or a glistri^ge white: as though the
plage of leprosye were in As these prestes make unclean and send out of
company, even so ours bind and excomunicat out of the co^gregacio^: and at
these make clean, so do ours lowsse, and absolve. Now the^ that sin
secretly they bind with preachi^ge gods word and if they repent, with
preachinge they lowse the^ again.
the skin of his flesh, then let him be brought unto Aaron the preast or unto
one of his sons the preastes, and let the preast look on the sore that is in
the skin of his flesh. If the here in the sore be turned unto white, and the
sore also seem to be lower than the skin of his flesh / then it is suerly a
leprosye, and let the preast look on him and make him unclean.

If there be but a white plecke in the skin of his flesh and seem not to be
lower than the other skin nor the here thereof is turned unto white: then let
the preast shitt him up seven days. And let the preast look upon him the.vij.
day: if the sore seem to him to abide still and to go no further in the skyne,
then let the preast shutt him up yet.vij. days moo. And let the preast look
on him again the.vij. day. Then if the sore be waxed blackesh and is not
grown abroad in the skin, let the preast make him clean, for it is but a
skyrfe. And let him wass he his clothes, and then he is clean But and if the
scabbe grow in the skin after that he is seen of the preast again. If the
preast se that the scabbe be grown abroad in the skin, let him make him
unclean: for it is suerly a leprosye.

If the plage of leprosye be in a man, let hi^ be brought unto the preast, and
let the preast se him. If the rysinge apeare white in the skin and have also
made the here white, and there be raw flesh in the sore also: then it is an
old leprosye in the skin of his flesh. And the preast shall make him
unclean, and shall not shut him up for he is unclean.

If a leprosye break out in the skin and cover all the skin from the heed
to the foot over all wheresoever the preast looks, then let the preast look
upon him. If the leprosye have covered all his flesh, let him make the disease
clean: for in as much as he is altogether white he is therefore clean. But and
if there be raw flesh on him when he is seen, then he shall be un clean.
Therefore when the preast sees the raw flesh, let him make him unclean. For in
as much as his flesh is raw, he is unclean and it is suerly a true leprosye.
But and if the raw flesh depart again and change unto white, then let him
come to the preast and let the preast se him: If the sore be changed unto
white, let the preast make the disease clean, and the^ he is clean.

When there is a byele in the skin of any man's flesh and is helede and after
in the place of the bycle there appear a white rysyng either a shynynge white
somewhat redysh, let him be seen of the preast. If when the preast sees hi^ it
appear lower than the other skin and the here thereof be changed unto
white, let the preast make hi^ unclean: for it is a very leprosye, that is
broken out in the place of the byele But and if when the preast looks on it
there be no white heeres therein nether the scabbe lower than the other skin
and be somewhat blackesh, then the preast shall shutt him aparte vij. days. If
it sprede abroad in the mean season, then let the preast make him unclean: for
it is a leprosye. But and if the glistringe white abide still in one place and
go no further, then it is but the prynte of the byele, and the preast shall make
him clean.

When the skin of any ma^s flesh is burnt with fire that it be raw and there
apere in the burning a glistringe white that is somewhat redysh or altogether
white, let the preast look upon it. If the here in that brightness be changed
to white and it also appear lower than the other skin, than it is a leprosye
that is broken out in the place of the burning. And the preast shall make him
unclean, for it is a leprosye. But and if (when the preast looks on it) he se
that there is no white here in the brygh tenesse and that it is no lower than
the other skin and that it is also blackesh, then let the preast shutt him
upp seven days. And if (when the preast looks on him the seventh day) it be
grown abroad in the skin, let him make him unclean: for it is a leprosye.
But and if that bryghtnesse abide still in one place and goo no further in the
skin and be blackesh, than it is but a rysyng in the place of the burning,
and the preast shall make him clean: for it is but the prynte of the burning
only.

When either man or woman has a breakinge out upon the heed or the beerde, let
the preast se it. And if it apeare lower than the other skin and there be
therein golden heeres and thyn, let the preast make him unclean, for it is a
breaking out of leprosye apo^ the heed or berde. if (when the preast looks on
the breaki^ge out) he se that it is no lower tha^ the other skin and that
there are black heeres therein let hi^ shutt hi^ up.vij. days. And let the
preast look on the disease the seventh day: and if the breaking out be gone
no forther nether be any golden heeres therein nether the scabbe be lower than
the other skin, then let him be shaven, but let him not shave the scabbe,
and let the preast shutt him up seven days moo. And let the preast look on
the breaking out the.vij. day again: If the breaking out be gone no further
in the skin nor moare lower the^ the other skin, then let the preaste make
him clean, and let him wasshe his clothes and then he is clean. If the
breaking out grow in the skin after that he is once made clean, let the
preast see him. If it be grown abroad in deed in the skin, let the preast
seek no further for any golden heeres, for he is unclean. But and if he se
that the scabbe stand still and that there is black here grown up there in,
the^ the scabbe is healed and he is clean: and the preast shall make him
clean.

If there be found in the skin of the flesh of man or woman a glisterynge
white, let the preast se it. If there appear in their flesh a glisterynge
white somewhat blackesh, the^ it is but frekels growe^ up in the skin: and he
is clean

If a man's here fall of his heed, the^ he is heedbaulde and clean. if his here
fall before in his foreheade, then he is foreheadbalde and clean. if there be
in the baulde head or baulde forehead a redysh white scabbe, then there is
leprosye spronge up in his baulde head or baulde foreheade. And let the preast
se it: and if the rysynge of the sore be reddyshwhite in his baulde head or
foreheade after the manner of a leprosye in the skin of the flesh, then he is
a leper and unclean: and the preast shall make him unclean, for the plage of
his heed.

And the leper in whom the plage is / shall have his clothes rent and his
head bare and his mouth moffeld, and shall be called unclean. And as long as
the disease lesteth upon him, he shall be unclean: for he is unclean, and shall
therefore dwell alone, and even without the host shall his habitacion be.

When the plage of leprosye is in a cloth: whether it be lynen or woollen, ye
and whether it be in the warpe or wolf of the lynen or of the woollen: either in
a skin or any thing made of skin / if the disease be pale or somewhat
redysh in the cloth or skin: whether it be in the warpe or wolf or any
thing that is made of skin, the^ it is a very leprosye and must be showed
unto the preast. And when the preast sees the plage, let him shutt it up.vij.
days, and let him look on the plage the seventh day. if it be increased in
the cloth: whether it be in the warpe or wolf or in a skin or in any thing
that is made of skin, then the plage is a fretynge leprosye and it is
unclean: And that cloth shall be burnt, either warpe or wolf, whether it be
woollen or lynen or any thing that is made of skin where in the plage is, for
it is a fretynge leprosye / and shall be burnt in the fire.

If the preast se that the plage has freten no further in the cloth: either in
the warpe or wolf or in what soever thing of skin it be, then let the
preast command the^ to wasshe the thing wherein the plage is, and let him
shutt it up vij. days moo. And let the preast look on it again after that
the plage is washed: If the plage have not changed his fascion though it be
spread no further abroad, it is yet unclean. And se that ye burn it in the
fire, for it is frete^ in ward: whether in part or in all together. But and
if the preast se that it is somewhat blackyshafter that it is washed, let him
rent it out of the clothe, or out of the skin or out of the warpe or wolf.
But and if it apeare any moare in the cloth either in the warpe or in the wolf
or in any thing made of skin / than it is a waxynge plage. And se that ye
burn that with fire, where in the plage is. Moreover the cloth either warpe or
wolf or what soever thing of skin it be which thou have washed and the
plage be departed from it, shall be washed once again: and then it is clean.

This is the law of the plage of leprosye in a cloth whether it be wolle^ or
lynen: either whether it be in the warpe or wolf or in any thing made of
skynnes, to make it clean or unclean.

ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: this is the law of a leper when he
shall be cle^sed. he shall be brought unto the preast, and the preast shall goo
out without the host and look apo^ him. If the plage of leprosye be healed in
the leper, the^ shall the preast command that there be brought for hi^ that
shall be cleansed.ij. living birds that are clean, and cipresse wodd, and a
piece of purple cloth and ysope. And the preast shall command that one of the
birds be killed over an erthe^ vessel of runnynge water. And the preast shall
take the living bird and the cypress wodd and the purple and the ysope, and
shall dip the^ and the living bird in the blood of the slain bird and in
the re^nynge water and sprinkle it upon him that must be cleansed of his
leprosye.vij. times and cleanse him / and shall let the living bird goo fre in
to the feldes.

And he that is cle^sed shall wasshe his clothes and shave off all his here and
wasshe himself in water, and the^ he is clean. And after that he shall come
in to the host / but shall tarry without his te^t.vij. days. When the seventh
day is come, he shall shave off al his here both apo^ his head and his berde
and on his brows: and eue^ all the here that is on him, shall be shaven off. And
he shall wasshe his clothes and his flesh in water / and then he shall be clean.

And when the.viij. day is come, let him take ij. lambs without blemysh and a
yewelambe of a year old without blemysh, and.iij. tenthdeales of fine flower
for a meatofferynge myngled with oil, and a logge of oil. Than let the preast
that makes him clean, bring the man that is made clean with those things
before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of witness. And let the
preast take one of the la^bes and offer him for a trespaceofferynge, and the
logge of oil: and wave them before the Lord. And than let him slay the lamb
in the place where the synofferynge and the burntofferynge are slain: eue^ in
the holy place. for as the synofferynge is, eue^ so is the trespace offering
the preastes: for it is most holy.

Than let the preast take of the blood of the trespaceofferynge, and put it
apo^ the typpe of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thombe of
his right hand and upon the great too of his right foot. Then let the
preast take of the logge of oil and pour it in to the palm of his left
hand, and dippe his right finger in the oil that is in the palm of his left
hand, and let him sprinkle it with his finger vij. times before the Lord. And
of the rest of the oil that is in his hand, shall the preast put upon the
typpe of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thombe of his
right hand, and upon the great too of his right foot: eue^ upon the blood
of the trespaceofferynge. And the remnaunte of the oil that is in the preastes
hand, he shall pour upon the heed off him that is cleansed: and so shall the
preaste make an atonement for him before the Lord,

Then let the preast offer the synneofferynge, and make an atonement for him
that is cleansed for his uncleaness. And tha^ let the burntoffrynge be slain,
and let the preast put both the burntofferynge and the meateoffrynge apo^ the
alter: and make an atonement for him, and tha^ he shall be clean.

If he be poor and can not get so much, tha^ let him bring one lamb for a
trespaceoffrynge to wave it and to make an atonement for him, and a tenth
deal of fine flower myngled with oil for a meatoffrynge and a logge of oil,
and two turtyll doves or two young pygeons which he is able to get and let the
one be a synneoffrynge and the other a burntoffryng. And let him bring them
the. viij, day for his clensynge unto the preast to the door of the tabernacle
of witness before the Lord.

And let the preast take the lamb that is the trespaceoffrynge and the logge
of oil, and wave them before the Lord. And when the lamb of the
trespaceoffrynge is killed, the preast shall take of the blood of the
trespaceoffrynge, and put it upon the typpe of his right ear that is cleansed,
and upon the thombe of his right hand, and upon the great too of his right
foot. And the preast shall pour of the oil in to his right hand, and shall
sprinkle with his finger of the oil that is in his left hand.vij. times
before the Lord.

And the preast shall put of the oil that is in his hand (upon the typpe of
the right ear of h^ that is cleansed, and apo^ the thombe of his right hand
and upon the great too of his right foot: even in the place where the blood
of the trespaceofferynge was put, And the rest of the oil that is in his
hand, he shall pour upon the heed of him that is cleansed: to make an
attoneme^t for him before the Lord. And he shall offer one of the turtyll
doves or of the young pigeons, soch as he can get: the one for a
synneofferynge and the other for a burntoffrynge apo^ the alter. And so shall
the preast make an attoneme^t for him that is cleansed before the Lord. This is
the law of him that has the plage of leprosye, whose hand is not able to get
that which pertayneth to his clensynge.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron saying: when ye be come unto the land
of Canaan which I give you to possess: if I put the plage of leprosye in any
housse of the land of your possession, let him that owes the house go and
tell the preast saying, me think that there is as it were a leprosy in the
housse. And the preast shall command them to ryd all thing out of the
housse, before the preaste goo in to se the plage: that he make not all that is
in the housse unclean, and then the preast shall goo in and se the housse.

If the preast se that the plage is in the walls of the housse and that there
be holowe strakes pale or read which seem to be lower than the other parts of
the wall, then let the preast go out at the housse doors and shett up the
housse for.vij. days. And let the preast come again the seventh day and se
it: if the plage be increased in the walls of the housse, let the preast
command the^ to take away the stones in which the plage is, and let the^
cast the^ in a foul place without the city, and scrape the house within
round about, and pour out the dust without the city in a foul place. And
let them take other stones and put them in the places of those stones, and
other mortar: and plaster the housse with all. If now the plage come again
and break out in the housse, after that they have taken away the stones and
scraped the housse, and after that the housse is playsterd anew: let the preast
come and se it. And if then he perceive that the plage has eaten further in
the housse, then it is a fretynge leprosye that is in the housse and it is
unclean. Then they shall break down the housse: both stones, tymbre and all
the mortar of the housse, and carye it out of the city unto a foul place.
Moreover he that goes into the housse all the while that it is shett up,
shall be unclean until night. And he that slepeth in the housse shall wasshe
his clothes, and he also that eats in the housse shall wasshe his clothes.

But and if the preast come and se that the plage has sprede no futher in the
housse after that it is new playsterd, the^ let him make it clean for the
plage is healed. And let him take to cleanse the housse with all: two birds,
cypress wodd, and purple clothe and ysope. And let him kill one of the birds
over an erthen vessel of runnynge water, and take the cipresse wodd, the ysope,
the purple and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain
bird and in the runninge water, and sprinkle upon the housse seven times, and
cleanse the housse with the blood of the bird, and with the runninge water,
and with the living bird, and with the cypress wodd, and the ysope and the
purple clothe And he shall let the living bird flee out off the town in to
the wild feldes, and so make an atonement for the housse, and it shall be
clean.

This is the law of all manner plage of leprosye and breaking out, and of the
leprosye off clothe and housse: and of rysynges, scabbes and glysterynge white,
to teach when a thing is unclean or clean. This is the law off leprosye.

The.xv. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron saying, speak unto the children of
Israel and say unto them: every man that has a runnynge issue in his flesh,
is unclean by the reason of his issue. And hereby shall it be known when he

And what soever sadell that he rydeth apo^, shall be unclean. And whosoever

that bears any soch things shall wassh his clothes and bathe hi^ self in
water and be unclean unto the eue^, and whosoever he twicheth (if he have not
first washed his hands in water) must wasshe his clothes, and bathe him self

earth, it shall be broken: and all vessels of wodd shall be rensed in the water.

When he that has an issue is cleansed of his issue, let him number.vij. days
after he is clean, and wasshe his clothes, and bathe his flesh in runnynge
water, and then he is clean. And the.viij. day let him take two turtill doves
or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle
of witness and give them unto the preast. And the preast shall offer them: the
one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering: and make an
atonement for him before the Lord, as concerning his issue.

If any man's seed depart from him in his sleep, he shall wassh his flesh in
water and be unclean until eue^. And all the clothes or furs whereon soch
seed chances shall be washed with water and be unclean unto the eue^. And if a
woman lie with soche a whone, they shall wash the^ selves with water and be
unclean until even.

When a womans natural course of blood runs, she shall be put aparte.vij.
days: and whosoever twycheth her shall be unclean unto the eue^. And all that

When a woman's blood runs long time: whether out of the time of her

the manner as when she is put aparte. All her couches whereon she lies (as
long as her issue lasts) shall be unto her as her couch when she is put a

And when she it cleansed of her issue, let her count her seven days after

concerning her unclean issue.

Make the childern of Israel to keep them selves from their uncleaness, that
they dye not in their uncleaness: when they have defiled my habitacion that is

This is the law of him that has a runninge sore, and of him whose seed
runs from him in his sleep and is defiled therewith, and of her that has an
issue of blood as long as she is put a part, and of whosoever has a
runnynge sore whether it be man or woman, and of him that slepeth with her that
is unclean.

The.xvj. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses after the deeth of the two sons of Aaron,
when they had offered before the Lord and dyed: And he said unto Moses:
speak unto Aaron thy brother that he go not at all times in to the holy place,
that is whithin the veil that hangs before the mercyseate which is upon the
arcke that he dye not. For I will appear By the cloud understand the smoke
off the cence.
in a cloud upon the mercyseate.

But of this manner shall Aaron goo in in to the holy place: with a young ox
for a synneofferynge, and a ram for a burntoffrynge. And he shall put the holy
lynen albe upon him, and shall have a lynen breche upon his flesh, and shall
gyrde him with a lynen gyrdell, and put the lynen mytre upon his heed: for
they are holy ray mentes. And he shall wasshe his flesh with water, and put
them on. And he shall take of the multitude of the childern of Israel two
gootes for a synneoffrynge and a ram for a burntofferynge.

And Aaron shall offer the ox for his sin offrynge and make an atonement
for him and for his housse. And he shall take the two gootes and present them
before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of witness. And Aaron cast
lottes over the.ij. gootes: one lotte for the Lord, and another for a
scapegoote. And Aaron shall bring the goote apo^ which the Lords lotte fell,
and offer him for a synneofferynge. But the goote on which the lotte fell to
escape, he shall set alive before the Lord to reco^cyle with and to let him
goo fre in to the wilderness. And Aaron shall bring the ox of his
synoffrynge, and reconcyle for him self and for his household, and kill him.

And tha^ he shall take a censer full of burninge coals out of the alter that
is before the Lord, and his handful of sweet cens beten small and bring them
within the veil and put the cens upon the fire before the Lord: that the
cloud of the cens may cover the mercyseate that is upon the witness, that he
dye not. And he shall take of the blood of the ox and sprinkle it with his
finger before the mercy seat eastwarde: even.vij. times.

Then shall he kill the goote that is the peoples synneofferynge, and bring
his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood
of the ox, and let him sprinkle it toward the mercyseate and before the
mercyseate: and reconcyle the holy place from the uncleanness of the childern
of Israel, and from their trespaces and all there sins. And so let him do
also unto the tabernacle of witness that dwells with them, eue^ among their
vnclennesses.

And there shall be no body in the tabernacle of witness, when he goes in to
make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out again. And he shall
make an atonement for him self and for his household, and for all the
multitude of Israel. Then he shall goo out unto the alter that stondeth before
the Lord, and reconcyle it, and shall take of the blood of the ox and of the
blood of the goote, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about,
and sprynckle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it,
and halowe it from the vnclennesses of the childern of Israel.

And when he has made an end of reco^cylinge the holy place and the
tabernacle of witness and the alter, let him bring the live goote and let
Aaron put both his hands upon the heed of the live goote, and confess over
him all the mysdeades of the childern of Israel, and all their trespaces, and
all their sins: and let him put them apo^ the heed of the goote and send him
away by the hands of one that is acoynted in the wilderness. And the goote
shall bear upon him all their mysdeades unto the wilderness, and he shall let
the goote goo fre in the wilderness.

And let Aaron goo in to the tabernacle of witness and put off the lyne^
clothes which he put on when he went in in to the holy place, and leave them
there. And let him wasshe his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on
his own raiment / and then come out and offer his burntofferynge and the
burntofferynge of the people, and make an atoneme^t for him self and for the
people, and the fatt of the synofferynge let him burn upon the alter. And let
him that carried forth the scapegoote, wasshe his clothes and bathe his flesh in
water / and then come in to the host again.

And the ox of the synofferynge and the goote of the synofferynge (whose
blood was brought in to make an atoneme^t in the holy place) let one carye out
without the host and burn with fire: both their skynnes, their flesh and
their donge. And let him that burns them, wasshe his clothes and bathe his
flesh in water, and the^ come in to the host again.

And it shall be an ordinance for ever unto you. And eue^ in the tenth day of
the seventh month. ye shall humble your souls and shall do no work at all:
whether it be one of your selves or a stranger that sogeorneth among you.
for that day shall an attoneme^t be made for you to cleanse you from all your
sins before the Lord / and ye shall be clean. It shall be a sabbath of rest
unto you / and ye shall humble your souls / and it shall be an ordinance for
ever.

And the preast that is anointed and whose hand was filled to mynistre in his
fathers stead / shall make the attoneme^t and shall put on the holy lyne^
vestime^tes / and reconcyle the holy sanctuary and the tabernacle of witness
and the alter, and shall make an attoneme^t also for the preastes and for all
the people of the congregation. And this shall be an everlasting or dynaunce
unto you to make an atonement for the childern of Israel for all their sins
once a year: and it was done eue^ as the Lord commanded Moses.

The.XVII. Chapter.
ANd the Lord talked with Moses saying: speak unto Aaron and unto his sons
and unto all the childern of Israel and say unto them, this is the thing
which the Lord charged saying: whatsoever he be of the housse of Israel that
kylleth an ox, lamb or goote in the host or out of the host and brings
the^ not unto the door of the tabernacle of witness, to offer an offering
unto the Lord before the dwelling place of the Lord, blood shall be imputed
unto that man / as though he had shed blood / and that man shall perysh from
among his people.

Wherefore let the childern of Israel bring their offerynges they offer in the
wide field / unto the Lord: even unto the door of the tabernacle of witness
and unto the preast / and offer the^ for peaseofferynges unto the Lord. And
the preast shall sprinkle the blood upon the alter of the Lord in the door of
the tabernacle of witness / and burn the fatt to be a sweet sauoure unto the
Lord. And let them nomoare offer their offerynges unto deuyls / after whom thy
goo an whoorynge. And this shall be an ordinance for ever unto you through out
your generacyons.

And thou shall say unto them: what soever man it be of the housse of Israel
or of the strangers that sogeorne among you that offers a burntofferynge or
any other offering and brings it not unto the door of the tabernacle of
witness to offer unto the Lord, that fellow shall perysh from among his
people. And what soever man it be of the housse of Israel or of the strangers
that soiourne among you that eats any manner of blood / I will set my fa^e
against that soul that eats blood, and will destroy him from among his
people. for the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it unto
you upon the alter, to make an atonement for your souls, for blood shall
make an attoneme^t for the soul. And therefore I said unto the childern of
Israel: se that no soul of you cate blood / nor yet any stranger that
soiourneth among you.

What soever man it be of the childern of Israel or of the strangers that
soiurne among you that honteth and catches any be or foul that may be
eaten, he shall pour out the blood and cover it with earth. for the life of
all flesh is in the blood, therefore I said unto the childern of Israel, ye
shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh. for the life of all flesh is in his
blood, and whosoever therefore eats it shall perysh. And what soever soul it
be that eats that which dyed alone or that which was torn with wild
beestes: whether it be one of your selves or a stranger, he shall wasshe his
clothes and bathe him self in water, and shall be unclean unto the eue^, and
tha^ is he clean. But and if he wasshe them not nor wasshe his flesh he shall
bear his sin.

If any soul turn unto them that work with spirits or makers of dysemall

nigh him and was never given to man: on her he may defile him self. But he
shall not make him self unclean upon a ruelar of his people to polute him
self with all.

They shall make the^ no baldness upon their Of the hethe^ preastes therefore

flesh. They shall be holy unto their God, and not polute the name of their god,
for the sacrifices of the Lord and the bred of their God they do offer:
therefore they must be holy.

They shall take no wife that is an whore, or poluted, or put from her
husbonde: for a preast is holy unto his God. Sanctify him therefore, for he
offers up the bred of God: he shall By bred understand all sode, flesh,
fruit, or whatsoever it be.
therefore be holy unto the, for I the Lord which sanctify you, am holy.

If a preastes daughter fall to play the whore, she poluteth her father:
therefore she shall be burnt with fire.

He that is the hye preast among his brethern upon whose heed the anoyntynge
oil was poured and whose hand was filled to put on the vestime^tes / shall
not uncover his heed nor rent his clothes, nether shall goo to any deed body
nor make him self unclean: no not on his father or mother / nether shall goo

He shall take a maiden unto his wife: but no wedowe nor deuorsed nor poluted
whore. But he shall take a maiden of his own people to wife, that he defyle
not his seed apo^ his people. for I am the Lord which sanctifye him.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying / speak unto Aaron and say: No man of
thy seed in their generacio^ns that has any deformyte upon him, shall prese

paid for dispensacio^s.

skaulde / or has his stones broken.

No man that is deformed of the seed of Aaron the preast / shall come nigh to

God: even as well of the most holy / as of the holy: but shall not goo in unto
the veil nor come nigh the alter, because he is deformed that he polute not my
sanctuary / for I am the Lord that sanctifye them. And Moses told it unto
Aaron and to his sons / and unto all the childern of Israel.

The.XXII. Chapter.
ANd the Lord comened with Moses saying: bid Aaron and his sons that they
absteyne from the hallowed things of the childern of Israel which they have
hallowed un to me, that they polute not mine holy name: for I am the Lord. Say
unto them: whosoever he be of all your seed among your generation after you
/ that goes unto the hallowed things which the childern of Israel shall have
hallowed unto the Lord / his uncleanness shall be upon him: and that soul shall
perysh from out of my syghte. I am the Lord.

None of the seed of Aaron that is a leper or that has a runnynge sore / shall
eat of the hallowed things until he be clean. And whosoever twytcheth any
unclean soul or man whose seed runs from him by night, or whosoever
twitcheth any worm that is unclean to him / or man that is unclean to him /
what soever uncleanness he has: the same soul that has twyched any soch
thing / shall be unclean until even / and shall not eat of the hallowed
things until he have washed his flesh with water. And than when the son is
down he shall be clean and shall afterward eat of the hallowed things: for
they are his fode. Off a be that dies alone or is rent with wild beasts /
he shall not eat / to defyle him self therewith: I am the Lord. But let them
keep therefore mine ordinance / lest they lade sin apo^ them and dye therein
when they have defiled them selves: for I am the Lord which sanctifye them.

There shall no stranger eat of the hallowed things / nether a gest of the
preastes / or an hired servant. But if the preast bye any soul with money he
may eat of it / and he also that is borne in his housse may eat of his
bred. If the preastes daughter be married unto a stranger / she may not eat
of the hallowed heueofferynges. Notwithstondynge if the preastes daughter be a
wedowe or deuorsed and haueno child but is returned unto her fathers housse
again / she shall eat of her fathers bred as well as she did in her youth. But
thereshall no stranger eat there of.

If a man eat of the hallowed things vnwyttingly / he shall put the fyfte
part there unto / and make good unto the preast the hallowed thing. And let
the preastes see / that they defyle not the hallowed things of the childern of
Israel which they have offered unto the Lord / lest they lade them selves with
mysdoynge and trespace in eating their hallowed things: for I am the Lord
which halowe them.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto Aaron and his sons and
unto all the childern of Israel and say unto them / what soever he be of the
housse of Israel or stranger in Israel that will offer his offering: what
soever vow or frewillofferynge it be which they will offer unto the Lord for
a burntofferynge to reconcyle them selves / it must be a male without blemysh
of the oxen / sheep or gootes. let them offer nothing that is deformed for
they shall get no favor there with.

If a man will offer a peaseoffrynge unto the Lord and separate a vow or a
frewill offering of the oxen or the flock / it must be without deformyte /
that it may be accepted. There may be no blemysh therein: whether it be
blide, broken, wounded or have a wen, or be maunge or scabbed. se that ye offer
no soch unto the Lord, nor put an offering of any soch upon the alter unto
the Lord.

An ox or a sheep that has any membre out of proporcion, may thou offer for
a frewillofferynge: but in a vow it shall not accepted. Thou shall not offer
unto the Lord that which has his stones broosed broken, plucked out or cut
away, nether shall make any soch in your land, nether of a strangers hand
shall ye offer an offering to your God of any soch. For they mar all in
that they have de formytes in them, and therefore can not be accepted for you.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: when an ox, a sheep or a goote is
brought forth, it shall be seven days under the damme. And from the.viij. day
forth, it shall be accepted unto a gift in the sacrifice of the Lord. And
whether it be ox or sheep, ye shall not kill it, and her young: both in one
day.

When ye will offer a thankofferynge unto the Lord, ye shall so offer it that
ye may be accepted. And the same day it must be eaten up, so that ye leave
none of it until the morrow. For I am the Lord, keep now my commandments
and do them, for I am the Lord. And polute not my holy name, that I may be
hallowed among the childern of Israel. For I am the Lord which halowe you, and
brought you out of the land of Egipte, to be your God: for I am the Lord.

the fourth deal of an hin of wine. And ye shall eat nether bred, nor parched
corn, nor furmentye of new corn: until the self same day that ye have
brought an offrynge unto your God. And this shall be a law for ever unto your
childern after you, where soever ye dwell.

And ye shall count from the morrow after the Sabbath: even from the day that

your childern after you,

When ye repe down your harvest, thou shall not make clean ryddaunce off thy
field, nether shall thou make any aftergatheringe of thy harvest: but shall
leave them unto the poor and the stranger. I am the Lord your God.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying* speak unto the childern of Israel and
say. The first day of the suenth month shall be a rest of remembrance unto
you, to blow horns in an holy feast it shall be, and ye shall do no laborious
work therein, and ye shall offer sacrifice unto the Lord.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: also the tenth day of the self
seventh month, is a day of an atonement, and shall be on holy feast unto you,
and ye shall humble your souls and offer sacrifice unto the Lord. Moreover
ye shall do no work the same day, for it is a day of atonement to make an
attoneme^t for you before the Lord your God. For whatsoever soul it be that
humbles not him self that day, he shall be destroyde from among his people.
And whatsoever soul do any manner work that day, the same I will destroy
from among his people. Se that ye do no manner work therefore. And it shall be a
law for ever unto your generacions after you in all your dwellynges. A
sabbath of rest it shall be unto you, and ye shall humble your souls. The.ix.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say: the xv. day of the same seventh month shall be the feast of

that ye shall do no laborious work therein. Seven days ye shall offer

These are the feasts of the Lord which ye shall proclayme holy feasts, for

made the childern of Israel dwell in bothes, when I brought them out of the
land of Egipte: for I am the Lord your God. And Moses told all the feasts
of the Lord unto the childern of Israel.

The. xxiiij Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: command the childern of Israel that
they bring unto the, pure oil olyue bete^ for lights to pour in to the
lamps allwaye, without the veil of testimonye within the tabernacle of
witness. And Aaron shall dress them both even and morninge before the Lord
always. And it shall be a law for ever among your childern after you. And he
shall dress the lamps upon the pure candelsticke before the Lord perpetually.

And thou shall take ^^^^ flower and bake. xij wastels thereof, two tenthdeales
shall every wastell be. And make two rows of them, six on a row upon the
pure table before the Lord, and put pure frankencens upon the rows. And it
shall be bred of remembrance, and an offering to the Lord. Every Sabbath he
shall put them in rows before the Lord ever more, given off the childern of
Israel, that it be an everlasting couenaunte. And they shall be Aarons and his
sons, and they shall eat them in the holy place. For they are most holy unto
him of the offerynges of the Lord, and shall be a duty for ever.

And the son of an Israelitish wife whose father was an Egiptian, went out
among the childern of Israel. And this son off the Israelitish wife and a
man of Israel, strooue together in the host. And the Israelitish woman's son
blasphemed the name and cursed, and they brought him unto Moses. And his
mothers name was Selamyth, the daughter off Dybri off the trybe of Dan: and
they putt him in ward, that Moses should declare unto them what the Lord
said thereto.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying, bring him that cursed without the
host, and let all that herd him, put their hands apo^ his heed, and let all
the multitude stone him. And speak unto the childern of Israel saying:
Whosoever curses his God, shall bear his sin: And he that blasphemeth the
name of the Lord, shall dye for it: all the multitude shall stone him to
deeth. And the stranger as well as the Israelite if he curse the name, shall
dye for it.

He that kylleth any man, shall dye for it: but he that kylleth a be shall
pay for it, be for be. If a man mayme his neighbor as he has done, so
shall it be done to him again: broke for broke, eye for eye and toth for toth:
even as he has maimed a man, so shall he be maimed again. So now he that
kylleth a be, shall pay for it: but he that kylleth a man, shall dye for
it. Ye shall have one manner of law among you: eue^ for the stranger as well
as for one of your selves, for I am the Lord your God.

And Moses told the childern of Israel, that they should bring him that had
cursed, out of the host, and stone him with stones. And the childern of Israel
did as the Lord commanded Moses.

The. xxv Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses in mount Sinai saying, speak unto the
childern of Israel and say unto the^. When ye be come in to the land which I
give you, let the land rest a Sabbath unto the Lord. Six years thou shall
sow thy field, and six year thou shall cut thy vynes and gather in thy
fruits. But the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land. The
Lords Sabbath it shall be, and thou shall nether sow thy field, nor cut thy
vynes.

The corn that grows by it self thou shall not repe, nether gather the
grapes that grow without thy dressynge: but it shall be a Sabbath of rest unto
the land. Nevertheless the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you: even
for the and thy servaunte and for thy maid and for thy hired servaunte and for
the stranger that dwells with the: and for thy catell and for the beestes
that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.

Then number seven wekes of years, that This horn in ebrue is called iobel,
and of this took the pope an occasion to make eu^rt.l. year a iubelye* so that
he contrafaiteth god in eueri point and will not be oue ^ce behind him.
is, seven times seven year: and the space of the seven wekes of years will be
unto the.xlix. year. And then thou shall make an horn blow: even in the tenth
day of the seventh month, which is the day of atonement. And then shall ye
make the horn blow, even through out all your land. And ye shall halowe the
fiftith year, and proclayme liberty through out the land unto all the
inhabiters thereof, It shall be a year of horns blowynge unto you and ye shall
return: every man unto his possession and every man unto his kynred again. A
year of horns blowynge shall that fiftieth year be unto you. Ye shall not sow
nether repe the corn that grows by it self, nor gather the grapes that
grow without thy labor For it is a year of horns blowinge and shall be holy
unto you: how be it, yet ye shall eat of the increase of the field. And in
this year of horns blowinge ye shall return, every man unto his possession
again.

When thou sellest ought unto thy neighbor or byest off thy neighbors
hand, ye shall not oppress one another: but according to the number of years
after the trompett year, thou shall bye of thy neighbor, and according unto
the number off fruteyeres, he shall sell unto the. According unto the
multitude of years, thou shall increase the price thereof and according to the
fewness of years, thou shall mynish the price: for the number of fruit he
shall sell unto the. And see that no man oppress his neighbor, but fear thy
God. For I am the Lord your God. Wherefore do after mine ordinances and keep
my laws and do them, that ye may dwell in the land in faftie. And the land
shall give her fruit, and ye shall eat your fille and dwell therein in saftie.

If ye shall say, what shall we eat the ^euenth year in as much as we shall
not sow nor gether in our increase. I will send my blessing upon you in the
sixte year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years: and ye shall sow
the eyghte year and eat of old fruit until the.ix. year, and even until her
fruits come, ye shall eat of old stoare. Wherefore the land shall not be
sold for ever, because that the land is mine, and ye but strangers and
soiourners with me: and ye shall through out all the land of your
possession, let the land go home fre again.

When thy brother is waxed poor and has sold away of his possession: if any
off his kyn come to redeem it, he shall by out that which his brother sold.
And though he have no man to redeem it for him, yet if his hand can get
sufficyent to bye it out again, then let him count how long it has been
sold, and deliver the rest unto him to whom he sold it, and so he shall
return unto his possession again. But and if his hand ca^ not get sufficient
to restore it to him again, then that which is sold shall remain in the
hand of him that has boughte it, until the horneyere: and in the horn year
it shall come out, and he shall return unto his possession again.

If a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city / he may bye it out again
any time with a hole year after it is sold: and that shall be the space in
which he m^ye redeem it again. But and if it be not bought out again within
the space of a full year / then the housse in the walled city shall be
stablished for ever unto him that boughte it and to his successoures after hi
and shall not goo out in the trompet year. But the housses in villagies which
have no walls round about them / shall be counted like unto the feldes of the
cuntre / and may be boughte out again at any season / and shall goo out fr^
in the trompett year.

Notwithstondynge the cities of the leuytes and the housses in the cities of
their possessions the levites may redeem at all ceasons. And if a man purchase
ought of the leuytes: whether it be house or citle that they possess, the
bargayne shall goo out in the tro^pet year. for the housses of the cities of
the levites / are their possessions among the childern of Israel. But the
feldes that lie round about their cities / shall not be bought: for they are
their possessions for ever.

If thy brother be waxed poor and fallen in decay with the / receive him as a
stranger or a soiourner / and let him live by the. And thou shall take none
vsurye of him / nor yet vantage. But shall fear thy God / that thy brother
may live with the. Thou shall not lend him thy money upon vsurye / nor lend
him of thy fode to have a^antage by it for I am the Lord your God which
brought you out of the land of Egipte, to give you the land of Canaan and to
be your God.

If thy brother that dwells by the wax poor and sell him self unto the /
thou shall not let him labor as a bondseruaunte does: but as an hired
servant and as a soiourner he shall be with the / and shall serve the unto the
trompetyere / and then shall he depart from the: both he and his childern with
him / and shall return unto his own kynred again and unto the possessions of
his fathers. for they are my servants which I brought out of the land of
Egipte / and shall not be sold as bondmen. So therefore that thou reign not
over him cruelly / but fear thy God.

If thou will have bondseruauntes and maidens / thou shall bye them of the
heythen that are round about you / and of the childern of the siraungers that
are soiorners among you / and of their generacio^s that are with you, which
they begat in your land. And ye shall possess them and give them unto your
childern after you, to possess them for ever: and they shall be your bond men:
But over your brethern the childern of Israel / ye shall not reign one over
another cruelly.

When a stranger and a soiourner waxes rych by the and thy brother that
dwells by him waxes poor and sell him self unto the stranger that
dwells by the or to any of the strangers kyn: after that he is sold he may
be redeemed again. one of his brethren may bye him out; whether it be his
uncle or his uncles son / or any that is nigh of kynne unto him of his kynred:
either if his hand can get so much he may be loosed. And he shall reken with
him that boughte him / from the year that he was sold in unto the trompet year
/ and the price of his byenge shall be acordynge unto the number of years / and
he shall be with him as a hired servant. If there be yet many years behind /
acordynge unto them he shall give again for his delyueraunce / of the money
that he was sold for. If there remain but few years unto the trompet year /
he shall so count with him / and acordynge unto his years give him again for
his redemption / and shall be with him year by year as an hired servant / and
the other shall not reygne cruelly over him in thy syghte. If he be not bought
fre in the mean time / then he shall goo out in the trompet year and his
childern with him. for the childern of Israel are my servants which I
brought out of the land of Egipte. I am the Lord your God.

Ye shall make you no ydolles nor graven image / nether rere you up any piler
/ nether ye shall set up any image of stone in your land to bow your
selves there to: for I am the Lord your God. keep my sabbathes and fear my
sanctuary. for I am the Lord.

The.XXVI. Chapter.
IF ye shall walk in mine ordynaunces and keep my commaundmentes and do them /
then I will send you rain in the right ceason and your land shall yield her
increase and the trees of the field shall give their fruit. And the threshynge
shall reach unto wine harvest / and the wyneharuest shall reach unto sowyng
time / and ye shall eat your bred in plenteousues and shall dwell in your
land peasably. And I will send peace in your land / that ye shall sleep, and
no man shall make you afraid. And I will ryd evil beestes out of your land,
and there shall no sword goo through out your land.

And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you upon the
sword. And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall
put.x. thousand to flighte, and your enemies shall fall before you upon the
sword. And I will turn unto you and increase you and multipye you, and set
up my testament with you. And ye shall eat old store, and cast out the old
for plentuousnes of the new. I will make my dwelling place among you, and my
soul shall not loothe you.

And I will walk among you and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. For
I am the Lord your God, which brought you out off the land of the
Egiptians, that ye should not be their bondemen, and I brake the bows of your
yockes, and made you go up right.

But and if ye will not harken unto me, nor will do all these my
commandments, or if ^ote well.
ye shall despise mine ordinances either if your souls refuse my laws, so
that ye will not do all my commaundnentes, but shall break mine appointment:
then I will do this again un to you: I will viset you with vexations, swellyn
ge and fevers, that shall make your eyes dasell and with sorrows of heart. And
ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. And I will
set my face agenste you and ye shall fall before your enemies, and they that
hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee whe^no man follows you.

And if ye will not yet for all this harken unto me, than will I punish you
seven times more God begins and augmenteth his plages moare and moare as the
people harde^ the i^ hertes age^ste him.
for your sins, and will break the pride off your strength. For I will
make the heaven over you as hard as yerne, and your land as hard as brass.
And so your labor shall be spent in vain. For your land shall not give her
increase, nether the trees of the land shall give their fruits.

And if ye walk contrary unto me and will not harken unto me, I will bring
seven times moo plages upon you acordinge to your synnnes. I will send in
wild beestes upon you, which shall rob you of your childern and destroy
your catell, and make you so few in number that your hye ways shall grow
unto a wilderness.

And if ye will not be learned yet for all this but shall walk contrary unto
me, then will I also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven
times for your sins. I will send a sword upon you, that shall avenge my
testament with you. And when ye are fled unto your cities, I will send the
pestelence among you* ye shall be delivered in to the hande^ of your enemies.
And when I have broken the staff of your bred: that.x. wives shall bake your
bred in one oven and men shall deliver you your bred again by weyghte, tha^
shall ye eat and shall not be satisfied.

And if ye will not yet for all this harken unto me, but shall walk contrary
unto me, then I will walk contrary unto you also wrathfully and will also
chastise you seven times for your sins: so that ye shall eat the flesh of
your sons and the flesh of your daughters. And I will destroy your alters
bylt upon hye hills, and overthrow your images, and cast your carcasses
upon the bodies of your ydolles* and my soul shall abhor you. And I will
make your cities desolate, and bring your sanctuaries unto naught, and will
not smell the sauoures of your sweet odoures.

And I will bring the land unto a wilderness: so that your enemies which
dwell there in shall wondre at it. And I will straw you among the heethen,
and will draw out a sword after you, and your land shall be wast, and your
cities desolate. Then the land shall rejoice in her Sabbathes, as long as it
lies void and ye in your enemies land: even then shall the land keep holy
day and rejoice in her Sabbathes. And as long as it lies void it shall
rest, for that it could not rest in your Sabbathes, when ye dwelt therein.

And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a feyntnesse in to
their hertes in the land of their enemies: so that the sound of a leef that
falls, shall chase them and they shall flee as though they fled a sword, and
shall fall no man folowinge them. And they shall fall one upon another, as it
were before a sword even no man folowinge them, and ye shall have no power to
stand before your enemies: And ye shall perish among the hethen, and the
land of your enemies shall eat you up.

And they that are left of you, shall pyne away in their unrighteous, even
in their enemies land, and also in the mysdeades of their fathers shall they
consume. And they shall confess their misdedes and the misdeades of their
fathers in their trespases which they have trespased against me, and for that
also that they have walked contrary unto me. Therefore I also will walk
contrary unto them, and will bring them in to the land of their enemies. And
then at the leest way their vncircumcysed hertes shall be tamed, and then they
shall make an atonement for their misdedes.

And I will remember my bond with Jacob Mercy is never denied unto him that
repeu^eth.
and my testament with Isaac, and my testament with Abraham, and will think on
the land. For the land shall be left of them and shall have pleasure in her
Sabbathes, while she lies wast without them, and they shall make an atonement
for their misdeades, because they despised my laws and their souls refused
mine ordinances. And yet for all that when they be in the land of their
enemies, I will not so cast them away nor my soul shall not so abhor them,
that I will utterly destroy the^ and break mine appointment with them: for I
am the Lord their God. I will therefore remember unto the^ the first covenant
made when I brought them out of the land of Egipte in the sight of the hethen
to be their God: for I am the Lord.

These are the ordinances, judgments, and laws which the Lord made between
him and the childern of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

The.xxvij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say unto them: If any man will give a synguler vow unto the Lord acordynge
to the value of his soul / then shall the male from.xx. year unto.lx. be set
at fyftie sycles of silver / after the sycle of the sanctuary / and the female
at.xxx. sycles. And from.v. years to xx. the male shall be set at.xx. sycles /
and the female at.x. sycles. And from a month unto.v. year / the male shall be
set at.v. sycles of silver / and the female at three. And the man that is.lx.
and above / shall be valowed at.xv. sicles, and the woman at.x. If he be to poor
so to be set, the^ let him come before the preast: and let the preast value him
/ acordynge as the hand of him that vowed is able to get.

If it be of the beestes of which men bring an offeringe unto the Lord: all
that any man gives of soch unto the Lord / shall be holy. He may not alter it
nor change it: a good for a bad or a bad for a good. If he change be for
be / then both the same be and it also where with it was changed shall
be holy. If it be any manner of unclean be of which men may not offer unto
the Lord / let him bring the beast before the preast and let the preast value
it. And whether it be good or bad as the preast sets it / so shall it be.
And if he will bye it again / let him give the fyfte part moare to that it
was set at.

If any man dedicate his housse / it shall be holy unto the Lord. And the preast
shall set it. whether it be good or bad / and as the preast has set it / so it
shall be. If he that sanctified it will redeem his housse / let him give the
fyfte part of the money that it was judged at thereto / and it shall be his.

If a man halowe a piece of his enhereted land unto the Lord / it shall be set
acordynge to that it bears. If it bear an homer of barlye / it shall be set
at fyftie sicles of silver. if he halowe his field inmediatly from the trompet
year / it shall be worth acordynge as it is esteemed. But and if he halowe his
field after the tro^petyere / the preast shall reke^ the price with him
acordynge to the years that remain unto the tro^pet year, and there after it
shall be lower set.

If he that sanctified the field will redeem it again / let him put the fyfte
part of the price that it was set at, there unto and it shall be his if he will
not it shall be redeemed nomoare. But when the field goes out in the trompet year
/ it shall be holy unto the Lord: even as a thing dedycated, and it shall be
the preastes possession.

If a man sanctify unto the Lord a feldewhich he has boughte and is not of
his enheritaunce / then the preast shall reken with him what it is worth unto
the trompet year / and he shall give the price that it is set at the same day,
and it shall be holy unto the Lord. But in the trompet year, the field shall
return unto him of whom he boughte it, whose enheritaunce of land it was.

And all settinge shall be acordinge to the holy sycle. One sycle makes.xx.
Geras.

But the firstborne of the beestes that pertayne unto the Lord, may no man
sanctify: whether it be ox or sheep, for they are the Lords allredy. If it
be an unclean be, then let him redeem it as it is set at, and give the
fifte part moare thereto. If it be not redeemed, the^ let it be sold as it is
rated.

Notwithstondinge no dedicated thing that a man dedicateth unto the Lord, of
all his good, whether it be man or be or land off his enheritaunce, shall be
sold or redeemed: for all dedicate things are most holy unto the Lord. No
dedicate thing therefore that is dedicate of man, may be redeemed, but must
needs dye

All these tithes of the land, whether it be of the corn of the field or
fruit of the trees, shall be holy unto the Lord. If any man will redeem ought
of his tithes, let him add the fifte part moare thereto. And the tithes of
oxen and sheep and of all that goes under the herdemans kepinge, shall be holy
tithes unto the Lord. Men shall not look if it be good or bad nor shall change
it. If any man change it then both it and that it was changed with all,
shall be holy and may not be redeemed.

These are the commaundmentes which the Lord gave Moses in charge to give
unto the childern of Israel in mount Sinai.

The end of the third book of Moses.
A prologe into the fourth book of Moses / called Numeri.
A Prologe in to the fourth book of Moses / called Numeri.
IN the second and third book they received y^ law. And in this.iiij. they
begin to work and to practyse. Of which practi^ynge yese many good ensamples
of vnbeleffe and what frewill does / when she takes in hand to keep the law
of her own power without help of faith in the promyses of god: how she leueth
her masters carkesses by the way in the wilderness and brings them not in to
the land of rest. Why could they not enter in? Because of their vnbeleffe
Hebre.iij. For had they beleved / so had they been under grace / and their old
sins had been forgeuen the^ / and power should have been given them to have
fulfilled the law thenceforth and they should have been kept from all
temptacio^s that had been to strong for them. For it is written Johan. 1. He
gave them power to be the sons of god / through belevynge in his name. Now to
be the son of god is to love god and his commaundmentes and to walk in his
way after the ensample of his son Christ. But these people took upon them
to work without faith as thou seysie in the xiiij. of this book / where they
would fight and also did / without the word of promysse: eue^ when they were
warned that they should not. And in y^.xvi. a gain they would please god with
their holy faithless works (for where gods word is not there can be no
faith) but y^ fire of god consumed their holy works / as it did Nadab and
Abihu Leui.x. And from these unbelievers turn thine eyes unto the pharesyes
which before the coming of Christ in his flesh / had laid the fundacion of
frewill after the same ensample. Whereon they bilt holy works after their own
imaginacion with our faith of the word / so fervently that for the great zele
of them they slew the king of all holy works and the lord of frewill which
only through his grace makes the will fre and lowseth her from bondage of sin
/ and gives her love and lust unto the laws of god / and power to fulfill
them. And so through their holy works done by the power of frewill / they
excluded them selves out of the holy rest of forgiveness of sins by faith in
the blonde of Christ.

And then look on our ypocrites which in like manner folowinge the doctrine of
Aristot le and other hethen paganes / have agenste all the scripture set up
frewill again / unto whose power they ascribe the kepinge of y^ co^maundme^tes
of god. For they have set up wilful povertye of another manner then any is
commanded of god. And the chastity of matrimony utterly defied / they have
set up another wilful chastity not required of god / which they swear / vow
and profess to give god / whether he will give it them or no / and compel all
their disciples there unto / saying that it is in the power of every man's
frewill to observe it / contrary to Christ and his apostle Paul.

And the obedience of god and man excluded they have vowed a another wilful
obedience condemned of all the scripture which they will yet give God whether
he will or will not.

And what is become of their wilful pouertye? has it not robbed the whole
world and brought all under them? ^n there be either king or emperor or of
what soever degree it be / except he will hold of them and be sworn unto them
to be their servaunte / to go and come at their lust and to defend their
quarrels be they false or true? Their wilful pouertye has all ready eaten up
the whole world and is yet still gredyar then ever it was in so much that ten
worlds mo were not enough to satisfye the hongre thereof.

Moreover besides daily corruptinge of other men's wives and open who: edome /
unto what abominacions to filthy to be spoke off has their voluntarye
chastity brought them?

And as for their wilful obedience what is it but ye disobedience and the
diff^au^ce h^th of all y^ laws of god and man: in so much yt if any price
begi^ne to execute any law of man upon the^ / they curse him unto the botom of
hell and proclayme him no right king and that his lords ought no longerto
obaye him / and interdite his comen people as they were hethe^ turks or
saracenes. And if any man preach them gods law / him they make an heretic
and burn him to ashes. And in stead of gods law and man's / they have set
up one off their own imaginacion which they observe with dispensacions.

And yet in these works they have so great confidence that they not only
trust to be saved thereby / and to be hyer in heaven then they that be saved
through christ: but also promessero all other forgiveness of their sins
through the merits of the same. Wherein they rest and teach other to rest also /
excludyn get he whole world from the rest of forgiveness of sins through
faith in Christ's blood.

And now seeing that faith only lets a man in unto rest and vnbeleffe
excludes hi^ / what is the cause of this vnbeleffe? verily no sin yt the
world seyth / but a pope holiness and a righteousness of their own imaginacion
as Paul says Roma.x. They be ignorau^te of y righteousness wherewith god
justifies and have set up a righteousness of their own makige through which
they be disobedient unto y^ righteousness of god. And Christ rebukes not the
phariseys for gross sins which the world saw / but for those holyedeades
which so blered the eyes of the world that they were taken as gods: eue^
for long prayers / for fasting / for tythi^ge so diligently that they left
not so much as their herbs vnlithed / for their clennesse in washing before
meat and for washing of cups / dishes / and all manner vessels / for
buyldinge the prophets sepulchers / and for kepinge the holy day / and for
turnynge the he then unto the faith / and forgevynge of alms. For unto soch
holy deades they ascribed righteousness and therefore when the righteousness of
god was preached unto them they could not but persecute it / the devell was so
strong in the^ Which thing Christ well describes Luce.xi. saying that after
the devell is cast out he comes again and fyndeth his house swepte and made
gaye and then takes seven we*sethen him self and dwells therein / and so is
the end of that man worse then the beginnynge. That is / when they be a little
cleansed from gross sins which the world seyth and then made gaye in their
own sight with the righteousness of tradicions / then comes seven / that is to
say the hole power of y^ devell / for seven with y^ hebrews signifies a
multitude without uu^bre and the extremyte of a thing and is a speech borrowed
(I suppose) out of leuiticus where is so often mention made of sene^. Where I
would say: I will punish the that all the world shall take an ensample of the
/ there the Jewe would say / I will circumcyse the or baptize the.vii. times.
And so here by seven is meant all the devels of hell and all y^ might and power
of the devell. For unto what further blindness could all the deuels in hell
bring the^ / then to make them believe y^ they were justified through their own
good works. For when they once believed y^ they were purged from their sins
and made rightuousse through their own holy works / what rowme was there
left for y^ righteousness y^ is in christ's bloudeshedinge? And therefore when
they be fallen in to this blindness they ca^ not but hate and persecute the
light. And the more clear and evidently their deades be rebuked y^ furiousser
and maliciousser blind are they until they break out in to open blasphemye
and synnynge agenst y^ holy ghost / which is y^ malicious persecut^ge of the
clearetrouth so manifestly proved that they ca^ not once hijsh agenst it. As
the pharesyes persecuted Christ because he rebuked their holy deades. And when
he proved his doctrine with y^ scriptu and miracles / yet though they could not
improve him nor reason agenst him they tought y^ the scripture must have some
other meaning because his interpretacion undermined their fundacion and
plucked up by the roots the sects which they had planted / and they ascribed
also his miracles to the deuell. And in like manner though our ypocrites can
not d^^nye but this is the scripture / yet because there can be no another sens
gathered thereof / but that overthrows their byldynges / therefore they ever
think that it has some other meaning than as the words sound and that no
man understands it or understood it seen the time of the Apostles. Or if they
think that some that wrote upon it sens the apostles understood it: they yet
think that we in like manner as we understand not the text it self / so we
understand not the meaning of the words of that docroure. For when thou
layest the iustifyinge of holy works and denyest the iustifyinge of faith /
how can thou understand saint Paul / Peter / Johan and the Acts of the
apostles or any scripture at all / seeing the iustifyinge of faith is almost
all that they entende to prove.

Finally / concerning vows whereof thou read chaptre.xxx. there may be
many questyons / whereunto I answer shortly that we ought to put salt to all
our offerynges: that is / we ought to ministre knowledge in all ovre works
and to do nothing whereof we could not give a reason out off gods words. We be
now in the day light / and all the secrets of God and all his counsel and
will is opened unto us / and he y^ was promised should come and bless us / is
come alredye and has shed his blood for us and has blessed us with all manner
blessings and has obrayned all grace for us / and in him we have all.
Wherefore god hence forth will receave nomoare sacrifices off beestes of us / as
thou read Hebre.x. If thou burn unto God the blood or fatt of beestes / to
obtain forgiveness of sins thereby or that god should the better hear thy
request / then thou do wrong unto the blood of Christ / and Christ unto
the is dead in vain. For in him god has promised not forgiveness of sins
only / but also what soever we axe to keep us from sin and temptacyon with
all. And what if thou burn frankencens unto him / what if thou burn a candle
/ what if thou burn thy chastity or virginite unto him for the same purpose /
do thou not like rebuke unto christ's blood? Moreover if thou offer gold /
silver or any other good for the same intent / is there any difference? And
even so if thou goo in pylgremage or fastist or go wolwarde / or sprinclest
thy self with holy water or else what soever dead it is / or observest what
soever ceremonye it be for like meaning / then it is like abhominacion. We
must therefore bring the salt of the knowledge of gods word with all our
sacrifices / or else we shall make no sweet sauoure unto god thereof.

Thou will axe me / shall I vow nothing at all? yes / Gods commandment
which thou have vowed in thy baptyme. For what intent? Verily for the love of
Christ which has bought the with his blood and made the son and heir of
god with him / that thou should wait on his will and commaundmentes and
puryfye thy members acordynge to the same doctrine that has purifyed thine
heart. For if the knowledge of gods wo^de have not purifyed thine heart / so
that thou consentest unto the law of God that it is rightuous and good and
sorowest that thy members move the unto the contrary / so have thou no part
with christ. For if thou repent not of thy sin / so it is impossible that
thou should believe that Christ had delivered the from the danger thereof. If
thou believe not that Christ has delivered the / so is it impossible that thou
should love gods commaundmentes. If thou love not the commaundmentes / so is
Christ's sprete not in the which is the ernest of forgiveness of sin and of
salvation.

For scripture teaches / first repentance: then faith in Christ / that for
his sake sin is forgiven to them that repent: then good works / which are
nothing save the commandment of god only. And the commandments are
nothing else save the helping of our neighbors at their neade and the
tamyinge of our me^bres that they might be pure also as the heart is pure
through hate of vice and love of virtue as gods word teaches us which works
must proceed out of faith: yt is / I must do them for the love which I have to
god for that great mercy which he has showed me in christ / or else I do them
not in the sight of god And that I faynte not in the pain of the sleyinge of
the sin that is in my flesh / mine help is the promise of the assistence of
the power of god and y^ comfort of the reward to come which reward I ascribe
unto the goodness / mercy and truth of the promiser that has chose me /
called me taught me and given me the ernest thereof / and not unto the merits
of my doe^ges or soferi^ges. For all that I do and soffre is but y^ way to the
reward and not the deserving thereof. As if the kings grace should promise
me to defend me at whom in mine own royalme yet the way thither is through
the sea wheri^ I might happlye soffre no little trouble. And yet for all that /
if I might live in rest when I come thither / I would thike and so would other
say / that my pains were well rewarded: which reward and benefyte I would not
proudlye ascribe unto the merits of my pains taking by the way: but unto
the goodness / mercyfulnesse and constaunt truth of the kings grace whose
gift it is and to whom y^ praise and thank thereof belongs of duetye and
right. So now a reward is a gift given ^relye of the goodness of the geuer
and not of the deseruinges of the reaceuer. Thus it appears / that if I vow
what soever it be / for any other purposse then to tame my members and to be an
ensample of virtue and edefyenge unto my neighbor / my sacrifice is unsavory
and clean without salt and myla^pe without oil and I one of the
folyshvirginis and shall be shut out from the feast of the bruydegrome when I
think my self most sure to enter in.

If I vow voluntary poverty / this must be my purposse / that I will be
content with a competent lyuinge which comes unto me either by succession of
mine elders or which I gettetruly with my labor in ministringe and doing
service unto the commonwealth in one office or in a another or in one occupacyon
or other / because that riches and honor shall not corrupt my mind and
draw mine heart from god / and to gene an ensample of virtue and edefiynge
unto other and that my neighbor may have a lyuinge by me as well as I / if I
make a cloak of dissimulacio^ of my vow / laynge a net of feigned beggerye to
catch superfluous abundance of riches and hye degree and authorite and through
the estimacion of false holiness to feed and maintain my slowthfull idleness
with the sweat / labor / lands / and rentes of other men (after y^ ensample
of our spiritualtye) robbynge the^ of their faythes and god of his honor
turnynge unto mine ypocrisye that confidence / which should be given unto y^
promyses of god only / am I not a wilye fox and a raueninge wolf in a la^bes
skin and a painted sepulcher fair without and filthye with in? In like manner
though I seek no worldly promocyon therebye / yet if I do it to be justified
therewith and to get an hyer place in heaven / thinking that I do it of
myneawne natural strength and of y^ natural power of my frewill and yt every
man has might even soto do and that they do it not is their fault and
negligence and so with the proud pharesye in co^paryson of my self despise the
sinful publicanes: what other thing do I then eat y^ blood and fatt of my
sacrifice devowringe yt my self which should be offered unto god alone and his
christ. And shortly what soever a man does of his natural gifts / of his
natural wit / wisdom / understanding / reason / will / and good intent
before he be otherwise and clean contrary taught of gods sprete and have
received other wit understanding / reason and will / is flesh / worldly and
wrought ^ abominable blidnesse / with which a man can but soke him self / his
own profit / glory and honor / eue^ in very spiritual matters. As if I
were alone in a wilderness where no man were to seek profit or praise of yet
if I would seek heaven of god there / I could of mine own natural gifts seek
it no no there ways then for the merits and deseruinges of my good works and
to enter therein by another way then by yt door christ / which were very theste
/ for christ is lord over all and what so ever any man will have of god / he
must have it given him frelye for christ's sake. Now to have heaven for mine
own deserving / is mine own praise and not christ's. For I can not have it
by favor and grace in christ and by mine own merits also* For fregeuinge
and deserving can not sto^d together.

If thou will vow of thy goods unto god thou must put salt unto this
sacrifice: that is thou must ministre knowledge in this dead as Peter
teaches.ij. pet.i. Thou must put oil of gods word in thy la^pe and do it
according to knowledge / if thou wait for the coming of the bridegroom to
enter in with him in to his rest. Thou will ha^ge it about the image to move
men to devotion. Denocyon is a fervent love unto gods co^ma^dmentes and a
desire to be with god and with his ever lasting promyses. Now shall the sight
of soch riches as are showed at saint thomas shryne or at walsingham move a man
to love the co^maundme^tes of god better and to desire to be loosed from his
flesh and to be with god / or shall it not rather make his poor heart sigh
because he has no soch at home and to wysh part of it in another place? The
preast shall have it in gods stead. Shall the preast have it? If the preast be
bought with christ's blood / the^ he is christ's seruau^te and not his own
and ought therefore to feade christ's flock with christ's doctrine and to
ministre christ's sacraments unto the^ purely for very love and not for felthy
lucres sake or to be lord over the^ as Peter teaches.i. pet.v. and paul
Acts.xx. Beside this christ is ours and is a gift given us / and we be
heirs of christ and of all that is christ's Wherefore the preastes doaryne is
ours and we heirs of it / it is y^ fode of our souls. Therefore if he
ministre it not truly and freely unto us with out sellinge / he is a thief and a
soul murtherar: and even so is he if he take upon him to feed us and have not
wherewith. And for a like conclusyon because we also with all that we have be
christ's / therefore is the preast heir with us also of all that we have
received of god / wherefore in as much as y^ preast wayteth on y^ word of god
and is oureseruaunte therein / therefore of right we are his dettars and owe him
a sufficyent lyuinge of our goods / and even thereto a wiffe of our daughters
owe we unto him if he require her. And now when we have appointed him a
sufficient living / whether in tithes rentes or in yerelye wages / he ought to
be content and to require no more nor yet to receive any more / but to be an
ensample of soberness and of dispysinge worldly things unto the ensample of
his parysheonars.

Will thou vow to offer unto y^ poor people? that is pleasant in y^ sight
of god / for they be left here to do our alms apo^ in christ's stead and
they be y^ right heirs of all our abundau^ce and overplus. Moreover we must
have a scole to teach gods word i^ (though it neded not to be so costely)
and therefore it is law full to vow unto the buyldinge or mayntenau^ce thereof
and unto helpinge of all good works. And we ought to vow to pay custom /
toll / rent and all manner duties and what soever we owe: for that is gods
commaundme^t

If thou will vow pilgrimage / thou must put salt thereto in like manner if it
shall be accepted / if thou vow to go and viset the poor or to here gods word
or what soever edifieth thy soul unto love and good work after knowledge or
what soever god commands / it is well done and a sacrifyce that sauoreth
well ye will happlye say / that ye will go to this or y^ place because god
has chosen one place more then another and will hear your peticyen more in
one place then another. As for your prayer it must be accordi^ge to gods
word. Ye may not desyer god to take ve^geaunce on him who^ gods word
^eacheth you to pytye and to pray for. And as for y^ other gloss / y^ god will
hear you more i^ one place the^ in another / I suppose it sal infatu^t^m /
salt unsavory / for if it were wisdom how could we excuse the deeth of steue^
Acts.vij. which dyed for yt article that god dwells not in temples made with
hands we that believe in god are y^ temple of god says paul / if a man love
god and keep his word he is the temple of god and has god presently dwellinge
in him / as witnesses christ Johan.xiiij. saye^ge: If a man love me he will
keep my word / and the^ my father will love him and we will come unto him and
dwell with him. And in the.xv. he says: if ye abide in me and my words also
abide in you / then axe what ye will and ye shall have it. If thou believe in
christ and have the promyses which god has made the in thine heart / the^ go
on pilgrymage unto thine own haite and there pray and god will hear y^ for
his mercy and truths sake and for his son christ's sake and not for a few
stones sakes. What cares god for the temple? The very beestes in that they
have liffe in them be much better then an hepe of stonnes couched to gether.

To speak of chastity / it is a gif e not given unto all persons testifyeth
both christ and also his apostle Paul / wherefore all persons may not vow
it. Moreover there be causes wherefore many persons may better live chaste at
one time then at another. Many may live chaste at twentye and thirtye for
certain cold diseases folowinge them / which at.xl. when their health is come
cannot do so. Many be occupied with wild phantasyes in their youth yt they
care not for marriage which same when they be ware^ sad shall be greatly desyrouse
/ yt is a dangerous thing to make sin where none is and to for swear y^
benefyte of god and to bind thy self under pain of da^nacyon of thy soul
that thou would not use the remeadye that god has created if nead required.
Another thing is this / beware that thou ge^t the not a false feigned chastity
made with ye ungodly persuasions of saint H^ero^ or of Ouide in his filthy
book of the remedy agenst love / lest when through soch imaginacyons thou have
utterly despised / defied and abhorred all voman kind / thou come in to soch
case through the firce wrath of god / yt thou can nether live chaste nor find
in thy heart to marye and so be compelled to faule into the abhominacion of the
pope agenst nature and kind.

Moreover god is a wise father and knows all y^ infirmityes of his children
and also mercy full / and therefore has created a remedy without sin and
given thereto his favor and blessinge. Let us not be wyser then god with our
ymaginacyo^s nor te^pte him / for as godly chastity is not every ma^s gyfre:
even so he y^ has it to day has not power to continue it at his own
pleasure / nether has god ^romy sed to give it him still and to cure his
infirmytyes with out his natural remeadye no more then he has promised to
slake his hongre with out meat or thirst with out drink.

Wherefore other let all things bide fre as wise god has created them and
another vow that which god requires not nor for swear that which god
permits the with his favor and blessinge also: or else if thou will neades
vow / then vow godly and under a co^dityon / y^ thou will continue chaste / so
long as god gives the yt gift and as long as nether thine own necessyte
nether cheryte toward thy neighbor nor y^ authorite of the^ under whose power
thou art drive ye unto the contrary.

The purposse of thy vow must be salted also with ye wisdom of god. Thou
may no^ vow to be iustefyed therbye or to make satisfaction for thy sins
or towynne heaven nor an hyer place: for then did thou wrong unto the
blood of christ and thy vow were plain Idolatrye and abominable in y^ sight
of god. Thy vow must be only unto ye furtheraunce of ye commau^dme^tes of god
/ which are as I have said nothing but y^ taminge of thy me^bres and the
service of thy neighbor: that is if thou thyncke thy back to weak for the
burden of wedlock and y^ thou can not rule thy wiff / children servants
and make provision for the^ godly and with out ouermoch busyenge and
vnquyetyngethy self and drounynge thy self in worldly business vnchristenlye
or that thou can serve thy neighbor in some office better being chaste then
married. And then thy vow is good and lawful. And eu^ so must thou vow
abstine^ce of meats and ^ ynkes so far forth as it is profitable unto thy
neighbors and unto y^ tami^ge of thy flesh: But thou may vow nether of them
unto y^ sleynge of thy body. As Paul commands tymothe to drink wine and
no moare water because of his diseases. Thou will say y^ timothy had not
happlye forsworn wine. I think the same and that the apostles forsware not
wedlock though many of them lived chaste another yet any meat or drink /
though they absteyned from the^ / and that it were good for us to follow their
ensample. How be it though I vow and swear and think on none exceptyon / yet
is the breaking of gods co^mau^dme^tes except and all chances that ha^ge of
god. As if I swear to to be in a certain place at a certain hour to make a
louedaye with out exception / yet if the king in the mean time command me a
another way / I must goo by gods commau^dment and yet break not mine oath. And
in like case if my father and mother be seek and require my presence / or if my
wiff / children or household be visited that my assistence be required / or if
my neighbors house be a fire at the same hour and a thousand soch chances:
in which all I break mine oath and am not forsworn and so forth. Read gods
word diligently and with a good heart and it shall teach the all things.

above / whatsoever was mete for the war in Israel / drew unto the sum of
six hundred thousand / five hundred and.l. But the leuires in the tribe off
their fathers were not numbered among them.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: only se that thou number not the trybe
of Leui / nether take the sum of them among the childern of Israel. But thou
shall appoynte the levites unto the habitacio^ of witness / and to all the
apparel thereof and unto all that longs thereto. For they shall bear the
tabernacle and all the ordinance thereof / and they shall ministre it and
shall pitche their tents round about it. And when the tabernacle goes forth
the levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is pitched / they
shall set it up: for if any stranger come nere / he shall dye. And the
childern of Israel shall pitch their tents / every man in his own company
and every man by his own standert through out all their hosts. But the levites
shall pitche round about the habitacion of witness / that there fall no
wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel / and the levites shall
wait upon the habitacion of witness. And the childern of Israel did acordinge
to all that the Lord commanded Moses.

The.iij. Chapter.
THese are the generacions of Aaron and Moses / when the Lord spoke unto Moses
in mount Sinai / and these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the
eldest son / and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar. These are the names of the sons
of Aaron which were preastes anointed and their hands filled to mynistre but
Nadab and Abihu dyed before the Lord / as they brought strange fire before
the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai / and had no childern. And Eleazar and
Ithamar mynistred in the sight of Aaron their father.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying bring the trybe of leui / and set them
before Aaron the preast / and let them serve him and wait upon him and upon
all the multitude / before the tabernacle of witness / to do the service of
the habitacion. And they shall wayre apo^ all y^ apparel of y^ tabernacle of
witness and upon y^ childern of Ysrael / to do y^ service of the habitacio^.
And thou shall give the levites unto Aaron and his sons / for they are given
unto him of y^ childern of Ysrael. And thou shall appoi^te Aaron and his sons
to way te on their preastes office: and the stranger y^ comes nigh / shall dye
for it.

And y^ Lord spoke unto Moses saying: behold / I have taken the levites from
among y^ childern of Ysrael / for all the firstborne that opens the matryce
among the childern of Ysrael / so that the levites shall be mine: because all
the first borne are mine: for y^ same day that Ismote all the fyrstborne in
the land of Egipte / Ihalowed unto me all the firstborne in Ysrael / both man
and be / and mine they shall be: for I am the Lord.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai saying: Number the
childern of Leui in y^ housses of their fathers and Rynredes / all yt are males
from a month old and above. And Moses numbered them at the word of the Lord
/ as he was commanded. And these are y^ names of y^ children of Leui: Gerson /
Cahath and Merari. And y^ se arethe names of the childern of Gerson in their
kynredes: Libni and Semei. And the sons of Cahath in their kynredes were
Amram. Iezehar. Hebron and Vsiel. And the sons of Merari in their kynredes
were Maheli and Musi. These are the kynredes of Leui in the housses of their
fathers.

And of Gerson came the kynred of y^ Libnites and the Semeites / which are the
kynredes of the Gersonites. And ye sum of them (when all the males were
told) from a month old and above / were.vij. thousand and five hundred. And
the kynredes of the Gersonites pitched behind the habitacion west ward. And
the captain of the must aw^cie^t housse among ye Gersonires / was Eliasaph
the son of La^l. And the office of the childern of Gerson in the tabernacle
of witness was the habitacion and the tente with the coueringe theroff and the
hanging of the door of the tabernacle of witness / and the hangynges of the
court / and the curtayne of the door of the court: which court went round
about the dwelling / and the alter / and the cords yt perteyned unto all the
service thereof

And of Cahath came the kynred of y^ Amramites and the kynred of the
Iezeharites and of the Hebronites and of the Vsielites: And these are the
kynredes of y^ Cahathites. And the number of all the males from a month old
and above / was.viij. thousand and six hundred: which waited on ye holy
place. And the kynred of the childern of Cahath / pitched on y^ southsyde of y^
dwelling And y^ captain in y^ most ancient housse of the kynredes of the
Cahathites / was Elizaphan thesonne of Vsiel / and their office was: the arcke
/ the table / the candelsticke / and the alter and the holy vessels to minystre
with and the veil with all that served there to. And Eleazar y^ son of Aaron
the preast / was captain over all the captains of the Levites / and had the
over syghte of them that waited upon the holythynges.

And of Merari came the kynredes of the Mahelites and of the Musites: and these
are the kynredes of the Merarites. And the nu^bre of them (when all the males
from a month old and above was told) drew unto. vi thousand and.ij.
hundred. And ye captain of the most ancient housse among the kynredes of the
Merarites / was Zuriel the son of Abihail which pitched on the north side of
the dwelling. And the office of the sons of Merari was: the bordes of y^
dwelling and the bars / pilers with the sokettes thereof / and all the
instruments there of and all that served thereto: and the pilers of the court
round about and their sokettes / with their pynnes and cords. But on ye fore
front of ye habitacio^ and before the tabernacle of witness castwarde / shall
Moses and Aaron and his so^nnes pytch and wait on the sanctuary in the stead
of y^ childern of Ysrael. And the stranger yt comes nigh / shall dye for it.
And the hole sum of the levites which Moses and Aar^n nu^bred / at ye
co^mau^dme^t of ye Lord through out their kynredes even / of all ye males of a
month old and above / was.xxij. thousand.

And the Lord said unto Moses: Number all ye first borne that are males

The. fyfte Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: command the childern of Israel that
they put out of the host / all the lepers and all that have yssues and all
that are defiled upon the deed / whether they be males or females ye shall put
them out of the host / that they defyle not the tents among which I dwell.
And the childern of Israel did so / and put them out of the host: even as the
Lord commanded Moses / so did the childern of Israel.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel:
whether it be man or woman / when they have sinned any manner of sin which a
man does wherewith a man trespaseth agenst the Lord / so that the soul has
done amysse: then they shall knowledge their sins which they have done / and
restore a gain the hurt that they have done in the hole / and put the fyfte
If ye hau^ false gott^^ goods and n^ man to restor^ it unto / the^ b^inge i^
un to y^ pope and he will dispe^ce with ^
part of it moare thereto / and give it unto him whom he has trespased
agenste. But and if he that makes the amends have no man to do it to / then
the amends that is made shall be the Lords and the preastes / beside the ram of
the atonement offering where with he makes an attoneme^t for himself And
all heue offerynges of all the hallowed things which the childern of Israel
bring unto the preaste / shall be the preastes / and every man's hallowed things
shall be his own / but what soever any man gives the preast / it shall be the
preastes.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel
and say unto them. If any man's wife goo a side and trespase against him / so
that another man lie with her fleshely and the thing be hydd from the eyes of
her husbonde and is not come to light that she is defiled (for there is no
witness agenst her) in as much as she was not taken with the manner / and the
sprere of gelousye comes upon him and he is gelouse over his wife and she
defiled / Or happily the sprete of gelousye comes upon him / and he is gelouse
over his wife and she yet undefiled. The^ let her husbonde bring her unto the
preaste and bring an offering for her: the tenthe part of an Epha of barlye
meele / but shall pour none oil thereunto / nor put frankencens thereon: for
it is an offering of gelousye / and an offering that makes remembrance of
sin.

And let the preast bring her and set her before the Lord / and let him take
holy water in an erthen vessel and of the dust that is in y^ flore of the
habyracyon / and put it in to the water. And the preast shall set the wife
before the Lord and uncover her heed / and put the memoryall of the offering
in her hands which is the gelousye offering / and y^ preast shall have
bitter and cursynge water in his hand / and he shall conjure her and shall
say unto her. If no man have lain with the nether haste gone aside / and
defiled thy self behind thy husbonde / then have thou no harm of this bitter
cursynge water.

But and if thou have gone aside behind thine husbonde and art defiled and
some other man has lain with the beside thine husbonde (and let the preaste
conjure her with the coniuracyon of the curse and say unto her) the Lord make
the a curse and a coniuracyon among thy people: so that the Lord make thy
thye rotte / and thy belly swell and this bitter cursynge water goo in to the
bowels of the / that thy belly swell and thy ^rot^e / and the wife shall say
Amen Amen.

And the preast shall write this curse in a byll and wasshe it out in the
bitter water. And when the cursynge water is in her that it is bitter / then
let the preast take the gelousy offering out of the wyfes hand / and wave it
before the Lord / and bring i^ unto the altar: and he shall take an
handefull off the memoryall offering and burn it upon the alter / and then
make her drink the water and when he has made her drink the water. If she
be defiled and have trespased agenst her husbond / then shall the cursynge
water goo in to her and be so bitter / y^ her belly shall swell and her thye
shall ro^te / and she shall be a curse among her people. And if she be not
defiled but is clean / then she shall have no harm / but that she may
conceive.

This is the law of gelonsye / when a wife goes a side behind her husbonde
and is defiled / or when the spirit of gelousye comes upon a man / so that he
is gelouse over his wife: then he shall being her before the Lord / and the
preast shall ministre all thie law un to her / and the man shall be giltlesse /
and the wife shall bear her sin.

The.vi. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto y^ children of Israel and
say unto them: when either man or woman appo^nteth to vow a vow of abstinence
for to abstene unto the Lord / he shall abstene from wine and strong drink /
and shall drink no vynegre of wine or of strong drink / nor shall drink
what soever is pressed out of grapes: and shall eat no fresh grapes nether yet
dried / as long as his absime^ce e^dureth. Moreover he shall eat nothing y^
is made of the vynetre / no n^^ so much as y^ cornel^ or the husk of the grape.

And as long as the vow of his abslin^ce endures / there shall no rasure nor
sheres come upon his heed / until his days be out which he fas^eth unto the
Lord / and he shall be holy and shall let the locks of his here grow. As long
as he ab^^en^th unto the Lord he shall come at no deed body: he shall not
make him self unclean at the deeth of his father / mother / brother or
sister. for the abstine^ce of his God is upon his heed. And therefore as long
as his abstynence lasts / he shall be hely unto the Lord.

And if i^ fortune that any man by chance dye sedenly before him / and defyle
the heed of his abstine^ce / ^hen must he shave his heed the day of his
^l^syng^* even the seventh day he shall shave it. And the eight day he shall
bring.ij. turtels or.ij. young pigeons to the preast / unto y^ door of y^
tabernacle of witness And y^ preast shall offer the one for a synofferynge and
the other for a burntofferynge and make an aronement for him / as concerning
that he sinned upon the deed / and shall also halowe his heed the same day and
he shall abstene vpto the Lord theryme of his abstinencye / and shall bring a
lamb of a^ year old for a trespace offering: but the days y^ were before
are lost / because his abstinence was defiled. This is the law of the
absteyner / when the time of his abstine^ce is out. he shall be brought unto y^
door of y^ tabernacle of witness and he shall bring his offering unto y^
Lord: an he la^be of a year old with out blemysh f^r a burntofferynge and a
she lamb of a year old without blemysh for a synofferynge / a ram without
blemysh also for a peaseofferynge / and a basket of sweet breed of fine flower
myngled with oil and wafers of sweet bred anoyntyd with oil with
meatofferynges and drynkofferynges that long thereto.

And the preast shall bring him before y^ Lord and offer his synofferynge and
his burntofferynge / and shall offer y^ ram for a peaseofferynge unto y^ Lord
with the basker of sweet bread / and the preast shall offer also his meat
offering and his drynckofferynge. And y^ abs^yner shall shave his heed in y^
door of y^ tabernacle of witness and shall take the here of his sober heed and
put it in y^ fire which is under the peaseofferynge. Then the preast shall take
the sodden shulder of y^ ram and one sweet cake out of y^ basket and one sweet
wafer also and put them in the hand of the abste^ner after he has shane^ his
abstine^ce of / and the preast shall wave them unto the Lord / which offering
shall be holy unto the preast with y^ wauebrest and heue shulder: and then the
abs^eyner may^ drink wine. This is the law of the absieyner which has vowed
his offering unto ^ Lord for his abstynence / besides that his hand can get
And acordyng to the vow which he vowed / even so he must do in the law of
his abstinence.

And the Lord talked with Moses sayeng^ speak unto Aaron and his sons
saye^^^ of this wise ye shall bless the childern of ^ere of ye se that Aaron /
where he lift up his hand and blessed the people / was not dumme as our
bisshopes be.

The lord lift up his countena^nce apo^ the / and give the peace For ye
shall put my name upon the childern of Ysrael / that Imaye blessethem.

the service of the tabernacle of witness. Cleanse them and wave them / for they
are given unto me from among the children of Israel: for I have taken them
unto me for all y^ firstborne that open any matrice among the childern of
Israel.

For all the fyrstborne among the childern of Israel are mine both man and
be: because the same time that I smote the fyrstborne in the land of Egipte
/ I sanctyfyde them for my self: and I have taken the Levites for all the
fyrstborne among the childern of Israel / and have given them unto Aaron and
his sons from among the childern of Israel / to do the service of the
childern of Israel in the tabernacle of witness and to make an atonement for
the chyldern of Israel / that there be no plage among the childern of Ysraell
/ if they come nigh unto the sanctuary.

And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the childern of Israel did
unto the levites acordynge unto all that y^ Lord commanded Moses. And the
levites purifyed them selves / and washed their clothes. And Aaron waued them
before y^ Lord / and made an atonement for them to cleanse them. And after
that they went into do their service in the tabernacle of witness / before
Aaron and his sons. And acordinge as the Lord had commanded Moses as
concerning the levites / even so they did unto them.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: this shall be the manner of the levites:
from xxv. year vppwarde they shall goo in to wait upon the service in the
tabernacle of witness / and at fyftye they shall cease waiting upon the
service thereof / and shall labor no moare: but shall ministre unto their
brethren in the tabernacle of witness / and there wait / but shall do no
moare service. And se that thou do after this manner unto the levites in their
waiting times.

The.ix. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai / in the first
month of the second year / after they were come out of the land of Egipte
saying: let y^ childern of Israel offer Pass over in his season even
the.xiiij. day of this month at even they shall keep it in his season /
according to all the ordinances and manners thereof. And Moses bade the
childern of Ysrael that they should offer Passover / and they offered
Passover the.xiiij. day of the first month at even in the wilderness of
Sinai: and did acordinge to all that the Lord commanded Moses.

And it chanced that certain men which were defiled with a deed corse that
they might not offer Passover the same day / came before Moses and Aaron the
same day / and said: we are defiled upon a deed corse / wherefore are we kept
back that we may not offer an offering unto the Lord in the due season /
among the childern of Israel? And Moses said unto them: tarry / that I may
hear what the Lord will command you And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying:
speak unto the childern of Israel and say. If any man among you or your
childern after you be unclean by the reason of a co^rse or is in the way
far of / then ^^^t him offer Passover unto y^ Lord: the. xiiij day of the
second month at even / and eat it with sweet bred and sour herbs / and let
them leave none of it unto the morning nor break any boon of it. And
acordynge to all the ordinance of the Passover let them offer it.

But if a man be clean and not let in a iurney / and yet was negligent to
offer Passover / the same soul shall perish from his people / because he
brought not an offering unto the Lord in his due season: and he shall bear
his sin. And when a stranger dwells among you and will offer Passover
unto the Lord / according to the ordinance of Passover and manner thereof
shall he offer it. And ye shall have one law both for the stranger and for
him that was borne at home in the land.

And the same day that the habitacio^ was reered up / a cloud covered it an
hye upon the tabernacle of witness: and at even there was upon the habitacyon
/ as it were the symilitude of fire until the morning. And so it was allwaye
/ that the cloud covered it by day / and the symylitude of fire by night.
And when the cloud was taken up from of the tabernacle / then the childern of
Israel iurneyed: and where the cloud abode there the childern of Israel
pitched their tents. At the mouth of the Lord the childern of Israel
iurneyed / and at the mouth of the Lord they pitched. And as long as the
cloud abode upon the habitacion / they lay still / and when the cloud tarried
still upon the habitacion long time / the childern of Israel waited upon the
Lord and iurneyed not.

If it chaunched that the cloud abode any space of time upon the habitacion /
then they kept their tents at the mouth of the Lord: and they iurneyed also
at the commandment of the Lord. And if it happened that the cloud was upon
the habitacion from even unto morning and was taken up in y^ morning / then
they iurneyed. Whether it was by day or by night that ye cloud was taken up
/ they iurneyed. But when y^ cloud tarried two days or a month or a long
season upon the habitacion / as long as it tarried thereon / the childern of
Israel kept ther^ tents and iurneyed not. And as soon as the cloud was
taken up / they iurneyed. It the mouth of the Lord they rested / and at the
commaundment of the Lord they iurneyed. And thus they kept the wait of the
Lord / at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

The.x. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Make the two trompettes of hard
silver / that thou may use the^ to call the congregation together / and when
the host shall iurney. when they blow with them / all the multitude shall
resort to the / unto the door of the tabernacle of witness. If but one
trumpet blow only / then the princes which are heedes over the thousands of
Ysrael shall come unto the. And when ye trompe the first time / the hosts that
lie on the east parts shall goo forward. And when ye tro^pe the second time
/ then the hosts that lie on y^ south side shall take their iurney: for they
shall trompe when they take their iurneyes. And in gatherynge the congregation
together / ye shall blow and not trompe. And the sons of Aaron the preastes
shall blow the trompettes and shall have them and it shall be alawe unto you for
ever and among your children after you.

And when ye shall goo to war in your land agenst your enymies that vex
you / ye shall trompe with the trompettes and ye shall be remembered before the
Lord your God Hence our belles were fert.
and saved from your enymies. Also when ye be merry in your fest days and in
the first days of your months / ye shall blow the trompettes over your
burnt sacrifices and pease offerynges / that it may be a remembrance of you
before your God. I am the lord your God.

And it came to pass the.xx. day of the second month in y^ second year /
that the cloud was take up from of the habitacion of witness. And the
childern of Israel took their iurney out of the deserte of Sinai / and the
cloud rested in y^ wilderness of Para^. And y^ first took their iurney at the
mouth of the Lord / by the hand of Moses: even the standerte of y^ host of
Judah removed first with their armies / whose captain was Nahesson y^ son of
Aminadab. And over the host of y^ trybe of the childern of Isachar / was
Nathaneel the son of zuar. And over the host of y^ try be of the childern of
Zabulon / was Eliab the son of Helon. And the habitacion was taken down: and
the sons of Gerson and Merari went forth bearing the habitacion

Then the standert of the host of Ruben went forth with their armies / whose
captain was Elizur the son of Sedeur. And over the host of the trybe of ye
childern of Simeon / was Selumiel the son of Deguel. Then the Cahathites went
forward and bare the holy things / and the other did set up the habitacion
agenst they came.

Then the standert of the host of the childern of Ephraim went forth with
their armies / whose captain was Elisama the son of Amiud. And over the
host of the trybe of the sons of Manasse / was Samaleel the son of
Pedazur. And over the host of the tr^ be of the sons of Ben Iamin / was
Abidan the son of Gedeoni.

And hynmost of all the host came the standert of the host of the childern of
Dan with their armies: whose captain was / Ahiezar the son of Ammi Sadai.
And over the host of the trybe of the childern of Asser / was Pagiel the son
of Ochran. And over the host of the trybe of the childern of Naphtali / was
Ahira the son of Enan / of this manner were the iurneyes of the childern of
Israel / with* their armies when they removed.

And Moses said unto ^obab the son of Ragnel the Madianyte / Moses father
law: we goo unto the place of which the Lord said I will give it you. Goo
with us and we will do the good / for the Lord has promised good unto
Israel. And he said unto him: I will not: but will goo to mine own land and
tomy kynred. And Moses said oh nay / leave us not / for thou know where is
best for us to pitche in the wilderness: and thou shall be our eyes And if
thou goo with us / look what goodness the Lord shows upon us / the same we
will show upon the

And they departed from the mount of the Lord.iij. days iurney / and the
arcke of the testament of the Lord went before them in the.iij. days iurney
to search out a resting place for them. And the cloud of the Lord was over
them by day / when they went out of the tents.

And when the arcke went forth / Moses said Rise up Lord and lat thine
enemies be scatered / and let them that hate the flee before the. And when the
arcke rested / he said return Lord / unto the many thousands of Ysrael.

The.xi. Chapter.
ANd the people waxed impatient / vnd it displeased the cares of the Lord. And
when the Lord herd it he was wroth / and the fire of the Lord burnt among
them and consumed the utter most of the host. And the people cried unto Moses
/ and he made intercession unto the Lord and the fire qwenched. And they
called y^ name of the place Tabera because the fire of the Lord burnt among
them.

And the rascal people that was among them fell a lustynge / And the childern
of Ysrael also went to and wept and said: who shall give us flesh to eat? we
remember the fysh which we should eat in Egipte for naught / and of the
Cucumbers and melouns / lekes / onyouns and garleke. But now our souls ar
dried away / for our eyes look on nothing else / sane upon Manna.

The Manna was as it had been co^ander seed / and to see to like Bedellion. And
y^ people went about and gathered it / and ground it in milles or bett it in
morters and book it in pannes and made cakee of it. And the taste of it was like
unto the taste of an oylecake And when the dew fell about ye host in the
night / the Manna fell therewithe.

And when Moses herd the people weep in their housholdes every man in the door
of his tent / then the wrath of the Lord waxed whote excedyngly: and it grieved
Moses also. And Moses said unto the Lord: wherefore dealest thou so cruelly
with thy servant: wherefore do I not find favor in thy syghte / seeing
that thou put the weight of this people upon me? have I conceived all this
people / or have I begote them / that thou should say unto me / carye them
in thy bosom (as a nurse bears the suckynge child) unto the land which
thou swarest unto their fathers? where should I have flesh to give unto all
this people? For they weep unto me saying: give us flesh that we may eat. I
^^ not able to bear all this people alone / for it is to heavy for me. Wherefore
if thou deal thus with me / fill me / I pray the / if I have found favor
in thy sight and let me not se my wrechidnesse.

And the Lord said unto Moses: gather unto me.lxx. of the elders of Ysrael /
which thou know that they are the elders of y^ people and officers over them
/ and bring them unto the tabernacle of witness / and let them stand there
with the. And I will come down and talk with the there / and take of y^
spirit which is upon the and put upon them / and they shall bear with them the
burden of the people / and so shall thou not bear alone.

And say unto y^ people: halowe your selves agenst to morrow / that ye may
eat flesh for ye have whyned in the ears of the Lord saying: who shall give
us flesh to eat / for we were happy when we were in Egipte? therefore the
Lord will give you flesh / and ye shall ^ate: Ye shall not eat one day only
other.ij. or.v. days / other.x. or.xx. days: but even a month long / and
until it come out at the nostrels of you / that ye be ready to perbrake:
because that ye have cast y^ Lord a side which is among you / and have wept
before him saying: why came we out of Egipte.

And Moses said: six hundred thousand fotemen are there of the people /
among which I am. And thou have said: I will ^^^e them flesh and they shall
care ^ month ^o^ge Shall the she^e and the oxen be slain for them to fy^^d^
them / either shall all the fysh of the sea be gathered together to serve them?
And the Lord said unto Moses: is the lords hand waxed short? Thou shall se
when there my word shall come to pass unto the or not.

And moses went out and told the people the saying of the Lord / and
gathered the lxx. elders of the people / and set them round about the
tabernacle. And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke unto him / and took
of the sprete that was upon him / and put it upon the.lxx. elders. And as the
spirit rested upon them / they prophesied and did naught else. But there
remained.ij. of y^ me^ in the host: the one called Eldad / and the other
Medad. And the spirit rested upon them for they were of them that were written
/ but they we^^ not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the host.

And there ran a young and told Moses and said: Eldad and Medad do prophecye
in the host. And Joshua the son of Nil the servant of Moses which he had
chosen out / answered and said: master Moses / forbid them. And Moses said
unto him: envy est thou for my sake? would God that all the The p^p^ would that
^ne of the lords people coud prophecy and that none had his spirit.
Lords people could prophecye / and that the Lord would put his spirit upon
them. And then both Moses and the elders of Israel / gat them in to the host.

And there went forth a wind from y^ lord and brought quayles from the sea
and let them fall about the host / even a days intney round about on every
side of the host / and.ij. cubetes hye upon the earth. And the people stood up
all that night and on the morrow / and gathered quayles. And he that gathered
the lest / gathered.x. homers full. And they killed them round about the host

And while the flesh was yet between theirteeth / yer it was chewed up / the
wrath of the Lord waxed whore upon the people / and the Lord slew of the
people an exceadynge myghtie slaughter. And they called the name of the place /
the graves of lust: because they buried the people that lusted there.

And the people took their iurney from the graves of lust unto hazeroth / and
bode at ha^roth.

The.xij. Chapter.
ANd Mir Jam and Aaron spoke against Moses / because of his wife of inde which
he had taken: for he had taken to wife one of India. And they said: does y^
Lord speak only through Moses? does he not speak also by us? And the Lord
herd it. But Moses was a very meke man above all the men of the earth. And y^
Lord spoke attonce unto Moses unto Aaron and Mir Jam: come out ye.iij. unto
the tabernacle of witness: and they came out all three.

And the Lord came down in the piler of the cloud and stood in the door of
the tabernacle and called Aaron and Mir Jam. And they went out both of them.
And he said: hear my words. If there be a prophet of the Lords among you /
I will show my self unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a
dream: But my servaunte Moses is not so / which is faithful in all mine
housse. Unto him I speak mouth to mouth and he sees the sight and the facyon
of the Lord / and notthorow rydels. Wherefore the were ye notafrayed to speak
agenst my servaunte Moses?

And the Lord was angrye with them and went his way / and the cloud departed
from of the tabernacle. And behold / Myr-Jam was become leprous / as it were
snow And when Aaron looked upon Mir Jam and saw that she was leprous / he
said unto Moses: Oh I beseech the my lord / put not the sin upon us which
we have folishly committed and sinned. Oh / let her not be as one that came
deed out of his mothers womb: for half her flesh is eaten away.

And Moses cried unto the Lord saying: Oh god / heal her. And the Lord
said unto Moses: If her father had spitte in her face / should she not be
ashamed.vij. days? let her be shut out of the host.vij. days / and after
that let her be received in again. And Mir Jam was shett out of the host.vij.
days: and the people removed not / till she was brought in again. And
afterward they removed from* Hazeroth / and pitched in y^ weldernesse of
Pharan.

The.xiij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Send men out to search the land of
Canaan / which I give unto the childern of Israel: of every trybe of their
fathers a man and let them all be soche as are ruelars among them. And Moses
at the commandment of the Lord sent forth out of the wilderness of Pharan:
soche men as were all heedes among the childern of Israel / whose names are
these.

In the trybe of Ruben / Sammua y^ son of Zacur: In the trybe of Symeon /
Saphat the son of Hori. In the trybe of Judah Caleph the son of Jephune. In
the trybe of Isachar / Igeal the son of Joseph. In the trybe of Ephraim /
Hosea the son of Nun. In the trybe of Ben Jamin / Paltithe son of Raph^. In
the trybe of Zabulon / Gadiel the son of Sodi. In the trybe of Joseph: In the
trybe of Manasse / Gaddi the son of Susi. In the trybe of Dan / Amiel the
son of Gemali. In the trybe of Asser / Sethur the son of Micheel. In the
trybe of Nephrali / Nahebi the son of Vaphsi. In the trybe of Gad / Guel the
son of Machi. These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out
the land. And Moses called the name of Hosea the son of Nun / Josua.

And Moses sent them forth to spy out the land of Canaan / and said unto
them: get you southwarde and goo up in to the hye contre / and see the land
what manner thing it is and the people that dwells therein: whether they be
strong or well / either few or many / and what the land is that they dwell in
whether it be good or bad / and what manner of cities they dwell in: whether
they dwell intentes or walled towns / and what manner of land it is: whether
it be fatt or lean / and whether there betrees therein or not. And be of a
good courage / and bring of the fruits of the land. And it was about the time
that grapes are first ripe.

And they went up and serched out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto
Rehob as men goo to Hemath / and they ascended unto the south and came unto
Hebron / where Ahiman was and Sefai and Thalman^ the sons of Enacke. Hebron
was bylt.vij. year before Zoan in Egipte. And they came unto the river of Escol
and they cut down there a branch with one clouster of grapes and bare it
apo^ a staff between twain / and also of the pomgranates and of the fygges of
the place. The river was called Escol / because of the clouster of grapes
which the childern of Israel cut down there.

And they turned back again from serchinge the land / at.xl. days end. And
they went and came to Moses and Aaron and unto all the multitude of the
childern of Israel / unto the wilderness of Pharan: even unto Cades / and
brought them word and also unto all the congregation / and showed them the
fruit of the land. And they told him saying: we came unto the land wether
thousendedst us / and surely it is a lord that flows with milk and honye
and here is of the fruit of it Nevertheless the people be strong y^ dwell in
the land / and the cities are walled and erceadinge great / and moreover / we
saw the children of Enack there. The amaleckes dwell in the south cuntre / and
the Hethites / Iebu sites and the Amorites dwell in the mou^raynes / and the
Cananites dwell by the sea and alonge by the cost of Iordayne.

And Caleb stylled the murmr of the people agenst Moses saying: let us goo
up and conquer it / for we be able to overcome it. But the men that went up
with him / said: We be not able to goo up agenst the people / for they are
stronger then we: And they brought up an evil report of the land which
they had serched / unto the childern of Israel saying. The land which we have
gone through to search it out / is a land that cateth up the inhabiters
thereof / and the people that we saw in it are men of stature. And there we
saw also geantes / the children of Enack which are of the geau^tes. And we
seemed in our sight as it were greshoppers` and so we did in their sight.

The.xiiij. Chapter.
ANd all the multitude cried out / and the people wept through out that night /
and all the childern of Ysrael murmured agenst Moses and Aaron. And the hole
congregation said unto them: would god that we had dyed in the loud of Egipte
/ either we would that we had dyed in this wilderness. Wherefore has the Lord
brought us unto this land to fall upon the sword / that both our wy^es /
and also our children should be a pray? is it not better that we return unto
Egipte again? And they said one to another: let us make a captain and
return unto Egipte again.

And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the congregation of the
multitude of the childern of Israel. And Joshua the son of Nun / and Caleb the
son of Iephune which were of them that serched the land rent their clothes
and spoke unto all the company of the childern of Ysrael saying: The land
which we walked through to search it / is a very good land. If the Lord have
lust to us / he will bring us in to this land and give it us / which is a
land y^ flows with milk and honey. But in any wise rebel not agenst the
Lord / Moreover fear ye not the people of the land / for they are but bred
for us. Their shylde is departed from them / and the Lord is with us: fear
them not therefore.

And all the whole multitude bade stone them with stones. But the glory of the
Lord appeared in the tabernacle of witness / unto all the childern of Israel.
And the Lord said unto Moses: How longest all this people rail upon me /
and how long will it be / yer they believe me / for all my signs which I have
showed among them? I will smite them with the p^stilence and destroy the^ /
and will make of the a greatter nation and a mightier then they.

And Moses said unto the Lord: then The Pope would not so have prayed if they
had been about to stone him.
the Egiptians shall hear it / for thou broughtest this people with thy might
from among them. And it will be told to the inhabiters of this land also / for
they have herd likewise / that thou the Lord art among this people / and yt
thou art seen face to face / and y^ t^y cloud stondeth over them and that thou
go before them by day time in a piler of a cloud / and in a piler of fire
by night. If thou shall kill all this people as they were but one man then the
nations which have herd the fame of the / will speak saying: because yt
Lord was not able to bring in this people in to ^ land which he swore unto
them / therefore he slew them in the wilderness.

So now lat the power of my Lord be great / acordynge as thou have spoken
saying: the Lord is long yer he be angrye / and full of merey / and
suffers sin and trespace / and leaves no man innocent / and visits the
vnryghtuousnesse of the fathers upon y^ childern / eue^ upon yt third and
fourth generation. be merciful I beseech y^ therefore / unto ye sin of this
people acordinge unto thy great mercy / and acordinge as thou have forgiven
this people from Egipte even unto this place.

And the Lord said: I have forgiven it / acordynge to thy request. But as
truly as Ilyue / all the earth shall be filled with my glory. For of all those
me^ which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egipte and in y^
wilderness / and yet have tempted me now this.x. times and have not herkened
unto my voice / there shall not one se the land which I swear unto their
fathers / nether shall any of the^ that rayled apo^ me / se it. But my
servan^te Caleb. because there is another manner sprite with hi / and because he
has followed me unto the vttmost: him I will bring in to the land which he
has walked in / and his seed shall conquer it / and also the Amalechites and
Cananites which dwell in the low contrees Tomorowe turn you and get you in
to the wilderness: even the way toward the re^ see.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron saying: how long shall this evil
multitude murmr agenst me? I have herd y^ murmurynges of y^ childern of
Ysrael which they murmr agenste me. Tell them / y^ the Lord says. As
truly as I live / I will do unto you even as ye have spoken in mine ears.
Your carcasses shall lie in this wilderness / nether shall any of these
numbres which were numbered from.xx. year and above of you which have murmured
agenst me come in to the land over which I lifted mine hand to make you dwell
therein / save Caleb the son of Iephune / and Joshua the son of Nun.

And your childern which ye said should be a pray / the^ I will bring in /
and they shall know the land which ye have refused / and your carkesses
shall lie in this wilderness And your childern shall wa^dre in this
wilderness.xl. years and suffer for your whoredom until your carcasses be
wasted in the wilderness / after the number of the days in which ye serched
out y^ land.xl. days / and every day a year: so that they shall bear your
unrighteous.xl. year / and ye shall feel my vengeance I the Lord have
said yt I will do it unto all this evil congregation y^ are gathered together
agenst me: even in this wilderness ye shall be consumed / and here ye shall dye.

And the men which Moses sent to search the land / and which (when they came
again) made all the people to murmr agenst it in that they brought up a
slander upon y^ land: dyed for their bryngenge up that evil slander upon it
/ and were plaged before the Lord. But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the
son of Iephune which were of y^ me^ that went to search the land / lived
still. And Moses told these sayenges unto all the childern of Ysrael / and the
people took great sorrow.

And they rose up yerlee in the morning and Blind reason which yerwhile would
not let them believe in Gods word / teaches them now to trust in their own
works.
gau them up in to the top of the mountain saying: lo we be here / and
will goo up un to the place of which the Lord said / for we have sinned. And
Moses said: wherefore will ye goo on this manner beyond the word of the Lord?
it will not come well to pass goo not up for the Lord is not among you that
ye be not slain before your enemies. For the Amalechytes and the Cananites
are there before you / and ye will fall upon the sword: because ye are turned
a way from y^ Lord / and therefore the Lord will not be with you.

But they were blinded to goo up in to y^ hill top: Never the lather / the
arc of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the host.
Then the Amalekytes and the Cananites which dwelt in that hill / came down and
sinote them and hewed the^: even unto Horma.

The.xv. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saye^ge: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say unto them: when ye be come in to y^ land of your habitacion which I give
unto you / and will offer an offering upon the fire unto the Lord / whether
it be a burnt offering or a special vow or frewill offering or if it be in
your principal festes to make a sweet sauoure unto the Lord / of the oxen o^
of the flock.

Then / let him that offers his offering unto the Lord / bring also a meat
offering of a tenth deal of flower myngled with the fourth part of an hin of
oil / and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drynk offering and offer
with y^ burnt offering or any other offering when it is a lamb. And unto a
ra^ thou shall offer a meat offering of.ij. tenth deals of flower / myngled
with y^ third part of an hin of oil / and to a drynk offering thou shall
offer the third part of an hin of wine / to be a sweet sauoure unto the Lord.

When thou offerist an ox to a burnt offering or in any special vow or
pease offeringe unto the Lord / then thou shall bring un to an ox / a meat
offering of.iij. tenth deals of flower myngled with half an hin of oil. And
thou shall bring for a drynk offering half an hin of wine / that is an
offering of a sweet sauoure unto the Lord. This is the manner that shall be done
unto one ox / one ram a lamb or a kyd. And acordynge to the number of soche
offerynges / thou shall increase y^ meat offerynges and the drynk offerynges

All that are of your selves shall do these things after this manner / when he
offers an offering of sweet sauoure unto the L^^de And if there be a
stranger with you or be among you in your generacions / and will offer an
offering of a sweet sauoure unto y^ Lord: even as ye do / so he shall do.
One ordinance shall serve both for you of the congregation / and also for the
stranger. And it shall be an ordinance for ever among your childern after you
/ that the stranger and ye shall be like before the Lord. One law and one
manner shall serve / both for you and for y^ stranger that dwells with you.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say unto them: When ye be come into the land whether I will bring you / then
when ye will eat of the bred of the land / ye shall give an heue offering
unto the Lord. Ye shall give a cake of the first of your dowe unto an heue
offering: as ye do the heue offering of the barn / even so ye shall heue it.
Of the first of your dowe ye must give unto the Lord an heue offering /
through out your generacions.

If ye ouerse your selves and observe not all these commaundme^tes which the
Lord has spoken unto Moses / and all that the Lord has commanded you by y^
hand of Moses / from the first day forward that the Lord commanded among
your generation: when ought is committed ignorantly before the eyes of the
congregation / then all the multitude shall offer a calfe for a burnt offering
to be a sweet sauoure unto the Lord / and the meat offering and the drynk
offering there to / acordynge to the manner: and an he goote for a
synofferynge. And the preast shall make an aronement for all the multitude of
y^ childern of Israel / and it shall be forgeuen the for it was ignorance. And
they shall bring their gifts unto the offering of the Lord / and their
synofferynge before the Lord for their ignorance. And it shall be forgeuen unto
all the multitude of the childern of Israel / and unto the stranger that
dwells among you: for the ignorauncye perteyneth unto all the people.

If any one soul sin through ignorance he shall bring a she goote of a year
old for a synofferynge. And the preast shall make an atonement for the soul
that sinned ignorauntly with the synofferynge before the Lord and reconsyle
him / and it shall be forgeuen him. And both thou that art borne one of the
childern of Israel and the stranger that dwells among you shall have both
one law / if ye sin through ignorauncye.

And the soul that does ought presumpmously / whether he be an Israelite or a
stranger / the same has despised the Lord. And that soul shall be destroyed
from among his people / because he has despised the word of the Lord a has
broken his co^mau^dmentes / y^ soul therefore shall perysh and his sin shall be
upon him.

And while the childern of Ysrael were in the wilderness / they found a man
gatherynge sticks upon the Sabath day. And they y^ found him gatherynge
sticks / brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all y^ congregation: and
they put him in ward / for it was not declared what should be done unto him.
And the Lord said unto Moses: y^ man shall dye. let all the multitude stone
him with stones without the host. And all y^ multitude brought him without
the host and stoned him with stones / and he dyed as the Lord commanded
Moses.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Ysrael and
bid them / that they make them gardes upon the quarters of their garments
through out their generacions / and let them make the gardes of ribandes of
Iacyncte And the guard shall Gods signs were to put men in remembrance of his
word / that they should not seek a way to please God after their own
imaginacion.
be unto you to look upon it / that ye remember all the commaundmentes of the
Lord and do them: that ye seek not a way after your own hertes and after
your own eyes / for to goo a whooringe after them: but that ye remember and
do all my commaundmentes and be holy unto your God / for I am y^ Lord your
God / which brought you out of y^ land of Egipte / to be your God. I am the
Lord God.

The.xvi. Chapter.
ANd Corah the son of Iezehar the son of Cahath the son of Leui: and
Dathan and Abiram the son of Eliab / and On the son of Peleth / the son
of Ruben: stood up before Moses / with other of the childern of Israel.ij.
hundred and fyftie / heedes of the congregation / and councelers / and men of
fame / and they gathered themselves together agenst Moses and Aaron and said
unto them: ye have done enough. For all the multitude are holy every one of
them / and the Lord is among them. Why therefore heue ye your selves up
above the congregation of the Lord.

When Moses herd it / he fell upon his face and spoke unto Corah and unto all
his company saying: tomorow the Lord will show who is his and who is holy /
and will take them unto him / and whom so ever he has chosen / he will cause
to come to him. This do: take fire pannes / thou Corah and all thy company /
and do fire therein and put ce^s thereto before the Lord tomorowe: And then
whom soever the Lord does chose / the same is holy. Ye make enough to do ye
childern of Leui.

And Moses said unto Corah: hear ye childern of leui / Seems it but a small
thing unto you / that y^ God of Israel has separated you from the multitude
of Israel to bring you to him / to do the service of the dwelling place of
the Lord / and to stand before the people to minystre unto them? he has
taken the to him and all thy brethern the sons of leui with the / and ye seek
the office of y^ preast also. For which cause both thou and all thy company
are gathered together agenst the Lord: for what is Aaron / that ye should
murmr agenst him.

And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab / and they
answered: we will not come. Seems it a small thing unto the that thou have
brought us out of a land that flows with milk and honye / to kill us in y^
wilderness. But that thou should reygne over us also? More over thou have
brought us unto no land that flows with milk and honye / nether have given
us possessions of feldes or of vynes. Echer will thou pull out the eyes of
these men: we will not come.

And Moses waxed very angrye and said unto the Lord: Turn not unto their
offerynges. I have not taken so much as an ass Can ourepre lates so say?
from them / nether have vexed any of them. Then Moses said unto Corah: Be
thou and all thy company before the Lord: both thou / they and Aaron to
morrow. And take every man his censer and put cens in them / and come before
the Lord every man with his censer: two hundred and fyftie censers / and Aaron
with his censer. And they took every man his censer and put fire in them and
laid cens thereon / and stood in the door of the tabernacle of witness / and
Moses and Aaron also. And Corah gathered all the congregacyon agenst them unto
the door of the tabernacle of witness.

And the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation. And the Lord
spoke unto Moses and Aaron saying: separate your selves from this
congregation / that I may consume them a tonce. And they fell upon their faces
and said: O most myghtie God of the spirits of all flesh / one man has
sinned / and will thou be wroth with all the multitude? And the Lord spoke
unto Moses saying: speak unto the congregation and say: Get you away from
about the dwelling of Corah / Dathan and Abiram.

And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abira^ / and the elders of Israel
followed him. And he spoke unto the congregacyon saying: depart from the
tents of these weked men and twyche nothing of there is: lest ye peryshe in all
there sins. And they gate them from the dwelling of Corah / Dathan and
Abiram / on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in ye door of
there te^tes with their wives / their sons and their childern.

And Moses said: Hereby ye shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all
the se works / and that I have not done them of mine own mind: If these men
dye the common death of all men or if they be visyted after the visitacion of all
men / then the Lord has not sent me. But and if the Lord make a new thing
/ and the earth open her mouth and swalowe them and all that pertayne unto them
/ so that they goo down quycke in to hell: then ye shall understood / that
these me^ have rayled upon the Lord.

And as soon as he had made an end of speaking all these words / the
ground cla^e a sunder that was under them / and y^ earth opened her mouth and
swalowed them and their housses and all the me^ that were with Corah and all
their goods. And they and all that pertayned unto them / went down alive unto
hell / and the earth closed upon them / and they peryshed from among the
congregacyon. And all Israel that were about them / fled at the cry of
them. For they said: The earth might happelye swalowe us also. And there came
out a fire from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fyftye men that
offered cens.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Speak unto Eleazer the son of Aaron
the preaste and let him take up the censers out of the burning and scater
the fire here and there / for the censers of these sinners are hallowed in their
deethes: and let them be beten in to thine pla^es and fastened upon the altar.
For they offered the^ before the Lord / and therefore they are holy and they
shall be a sign unto the childern of Israel.

And Eleazar the preast took the brazen censers which they that were burnt had
offered / and bet them and fastened them upon the altar / to be a
remembrance unto the childern of Israel / that no stranger which is not of
the seed of Aaron / come nere to offer cens before the Lord / that he be not
made like unto Corah and his company: as the Lord said unto him by the hand
of Moses.

And on the morrow all the multitude of the childern of Israel murmured
agenste Moses and Aaron saying: ye have killed the people of the Lord. And
when the multitude was gathered agenste Moses and Aaron / they looked toward
the tabernacle of witness. And behold / the cloud had covered it and the
glory of the Lord appeared. And Moses and Aaron went before the tabernacle of
witness. And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Get you from this
congregacyon / that I may consume them quyckelye. And they fell upon their
faces.

And Moses said unto Aaron: take a censer and put fire therein out of the
alter / and pour on cens / and goo quyckly unto the congregation and make an
atonement for the^. For there is wrath gone out from the Lord / and there is
a plage begone. And Aaron took as Moses commanded him / and ran unto the
congregation: and behold / the plage was begone among the people / and he put
on cens / and made an atonement for the people. And he stood between the deed
/ and them that were alive / and the plage ceased. And the number of them that
dyed in the plage / were.xiiij. thousand and seven hundred: beside them that
dyed about the busynes of Corah. And Aaron went again unto Moses unto the
door off the tabernacle of witness / and the plage ceased.

The.xvij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
take of them / for every pryncypall housse a rod / of their princes over the
housses of their fathers: even.xij. rods / and write every man's name upon his
rod. And write Aarons name upon the staff of Leui: for every heedman over the
housses of their fathers shall have a rod. And put the^ in the tabernacle of
witness where I will mete you. And his rod whom I chose / shall blossom: So I
will make cease from me the grudgynges of the childern of Israel which they
grudge agenst you.

And Moses spoke unto the childern off Israel / and all the princes gave him
for every prince over their fathers housses / a rod: even. xij rods / and the
rod of Aaron was among the rodes. And Moses put y^ rods before the Lord in
the tabernacle of witness. And on the morrow / Moses went in to the
tabernacle: and behold / the rod of Aaron of the housse of Leui was budded and
bare blosomes and almondes. And Moses brought out all the staves from before
the Lord / unto all the childern of Israel / and they looked upon them / and
took every man his staff.

And the Lord said unto Moses: bring Aarons rod again before the witness
to be kept for a token unto the childern of re bellyon / that their
murmurynges may cease from / that they dye not. And Moses did as the Lord
commanded him. And the childern of Israel spoke unto Moses saying: behold /
we are destroyed and all come to naught: for whosoever comes nyethe dwelling
of the Lord / dies. Shall we utterly consume away?

The.xviij. Chapter.
ANd the Lord said unto Aaron* Thou and thy sons and thy fathers housse
with the / shall bear the fault of that which is done amysse in the holy
place. And thou and thy sons with the / shall bear the fame of that which
is done amysse in your preasthode. And thy brethern also y^ tribe of l^ui / y^
trybe of thy father take with the / and let them be yoyned unto the and
ministre unto the. And thou and thy sons with the shall ministre before the
tabernacle of witness. And let them wait upon the and upon all the
tabernacle: only let them not come nigh the holy vessels and the alter / that
both they and ye also dye not. And let them be by the and wait on the
tabernacle of witness / and on all the service of the tabernacle / and let no
stranger come nigh unto you.

Wait therefore upon the holy place and upon the alter / yt there fall no
moare wrath upon the childern of Israel: behold / I have taken your brethern
the levites from among childern of Israel / to be youres / as gifts given
unto the Lord to do the service of the tabernacle of witness. And se that
both thou and thy sons with the take heed unto your preastes office / in all
things that pertayne unto the alter and within the veil. And se that ye serve
/ for I have given your preastes office unto you for a gift to do service:
and the stranger that comes nigh / shall dye.

And the Lord spoke unto Aaron: behold / I have given the the keeping of mine
heueofferynges in all the hallowed things of the childern of Israel. And unto
the I have given them unto anoyntynge and to thy sons: to be a duty for
ever. This shall be thine of most holy sacrifyces: All their gifts / through
out all their meatofferynges synneoffrynges and trespaceoffrynges which they
bring unto me: They shall be most holy unto the and unto thy sons. And ye
shall eat it in the most holy place: all that are males shall eat of it: for
it shall be holy unto the.

And this shall be thine: the heueofferynge of their gifts / through out all the
waueofferynges of the childern of Israel / for I have given them unto the and
thy sons / and thy daughters with the / to be a duty for ever: and all that
are clean in thy house / shall eat of it / all the fatt of the oil / of the
wine and of the corn: their first fruits which they give unto the Lord that
have I given unto the. The first fruits of all that is in their lands which
they bring unto the Lord / shall be thine: and all that are clean in thine
housse / shall eat off it.

All dedicate things in Israel / shall be thine. All that breaks the matrice
of all flesh that men bring unto the Lord / both of man and be / shall be
thine. Neuerthelater, the firstborne of man shall be redeemed / and the firstborne
of unclean beestes shall be redeemed. And their redemptions shall be at a month
old / valowed at.v. sycles of silver / of the holy sycle. A sycle makes
twentye Geras. But the firstborne of oxen / sheep and goo tes shall not be
redeemed. For they are holy / and thou shall sprinkle their blood upon the alter
/ and shall burn their fatt to be a sacrifyce of a sweet sauoure vnte the
Lord.

And the flesh of them shall be thine / as the wave breast and all the right
shulder is thine. All the holy heueofferynges which the childern of Israel
heue unto ye Lord / I give the and thy sons and thy daughters with the to be
a duty for ever. And it shall be a salted couenaunte for ever / before the
Lord: vnt^ the and to thy seed with the.

And the Lord spoke unto Aaron: thou shall have none enheritaunce in their
land / nor part among them. For I am thy part and thy enheritaunce among
the childern of Israel. And behold I have given the children of Leui / the
tenth in Israel to enherite / for the service which they serve in the
rabernacle of witness / that the children of Israel henceforth come ne^nye the
tabernacle of witness / and bear sin and dye. And the levites shall do the
service in the tabernacle of witness and bear their sin / and it shall be a
law for ever unto your childern after you: But amongethe children of Israel
they shall enheret none enheritaunce. For Ours / will have tithes and lands
and re^tes and kingdoms and emperies and all.
therithes of the childern of Israel which they heve unto the Lord / I have
given the Levites to enherett. Wherefore I have said unto them: Among the
chyldern off Israel ye shall enherett none enheritaunce.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the levites and say unto
the^: when ye take of the childern of Israel therithes which I have given you
of them to your enheritaunce / ye shall take an heueoffrynge of that same
forth Lord: even the tenth of that tithe. And it shall be rekened unto you for
your heueofferynge / even as though ye gave corn out of the barn or a full
offering from the wine press, And of this manner ye shall heue an
heueofferynge unto y^ Lord / of all your tithes which ye receive of the
childern of Israel / and ye shall give there of the Lords heueofferinge unto
Aaron the preast Of all your gifts / ye shall take out the Lords heue
offering: even the fatt of all their hallowed things.

And thou shall say unto them: when ye have take a wayethe fatt of it from it
/ it shall be counted unto the levites / as y^ increase of corn and wine And ye
shall care it in all places both ye and your housholdes / for it is your
reward for your service in the tabernacle of witness. And ye shall bear no
sin by y^ reason of it / when ye have taken from it the fatt of it: nether
shall ye vnhalowe y^ hallowed things of the childern of Israel / and so shall
ye not dye.

ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron saying: this is the ordinance of
the law which y^ Lord commands saying: speak unto y^ childern of Israel
and let them take the a redd cow with out spot wherein is no blemysh / and
which never bare yocke apo^ her. And ye shall give her unto Eleazer the preast
/ and he shall bring her with out the host and cause her to be slain before

And Eleazar y^ preast shall take of her blood upon his finger / and sprynkle

/ and cast it upon the cow as she burns. And let the preast wash his clothes
and bathe his flesh in water / and then come in to the host / and y^ preast
shall be unclean unto the even.

And he that burns her / shall wash his clothes in water a bathe his flesh
also in water / and be unclean until even. And one that is clean / shall goo
and take up the ashes of the cow / and put them without the host in a
clean place / where they shall be kept to make sprynklynge water for the

And this shall be unto the childern of Israel and unto the stranger y^ dwells
among them / a manner for ever.

He that twycheth any deed person / shall be unclean.vii. days. And he shall
purifye him self with the ashes the third day and then he shall be clean the
seventh day. And if he purifye not himself the third day / the^ the seventh

The.xx. Chapter.
ANd the whole multitude of y^ childern of Israel / came in to the deserte of
Sin in the first month / and the people dwelt at cades. And there dyed Mir Iam
/ and was buried there. More over there was no water for the multitude /
wherefore they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. And
the people chode with Moses and spoke saying: would God that we had perysshed
when our brethern perysshed before ye Lord. Why have ye brought the
congregation of the Lord unto this wilderness / that both we and our catell
should dye here? Wherefore brought ye us out of Egipte / to bring us into this
ungracious place / which is no place of seed nor offygges nor vynes nor of
pomgranates / nether is there any water to drink?

And Moses and Aaron went from the congregation unto the door of the tabernacle
of witness / and fell upon their faces. And ye glory of the Lord appeared
unto them. And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: take y^ staff / and gather
thou and thy brother Aaron the congregation together / and say unto the rock
before their eyes / that he give forth his water. And thou shall bring the^
water out of the rock and shall give the company drink / and their beesse
also.

And Moses took the staff from before ye Lord / as he commanded him. And
Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock / and he
said unto the^ hear ye rebellyons / must we f^^t you water out of this rock?
And Moses lift up his hand with his staff and smote the rock.ij. times /
and the water came out abundantly / and the multitude drank and their beesse
also.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron: Because ye believed me not / to
sanctifye me in the eyes of the childern of Israel / therefore ye shall not
bring this congregation in to the land which I have given them. This is the
water ofstryffe / because the childern of Israel strove with the Lord / and he
was sanctified upon them.

And Moses sent messengers from cades unto the king of Edome. Thus says thy
brother Israel: Thou know all the travel yt has happened us / how our
fathers went down in to Egipte / and how we have dwelt in Egipte a longetyme /
and how the Egip^ans vexed both us and our fathers. Then we cried unto the
Lord and he herd our voices / and sent an angel and has fett us out of
Egipte. And behold / we are in Cades and citi^ hard by the borders of thy
contre let us goo a good felowshipe through thy contre we will not goo through
the feldes nor through the vyneyardes / nether will we drink of the water of
the fountaynes: but we will goo by the hye way and nether turn unto ye right
hand nor to ye left / until we be past thy contre.

And Edom answered him: Se thou come not by me / lest I come out against the
with the sword And the childern of Israel said unto him: we will goo by the
beeten way: and if either we or our catell drink of thy water / we will pay
for it / we will do nomoare but pass through by sote only. And he said: ye
shall not goo through. And Edom came out agenst him with much people and with a
myghtie power. And thus Edom denied to give Israel passage through his contre.
And Israel turned a way from him.

And the childern of Israel removed from Cades and went unto mount Hor with all
the congregation. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor / hard
upon the costs of the land of Edom saying: let Aaron be put unto his people
/ for he shall not come in to the land which I have given unto the childern of
Israel: because ye dishobeyed my mouth at the water of stryffe Take Aaron and
Eleazer his son / and bring them up in to mount Hor / and stryppe Aaron out
of his vestimentes and put them upon Eleazer his son / and let Aaron be put
unto his people and dye there.

And Moses did as the Lord commanded: and they went up in to mount Hor in
the syghte of all the multitude. And Moses took off Aarons clothes and put them
upon Eleazer his son / and Aaron dyed there in the top of the mount. And
Moses and Eleazer came down out of the mount. And all ye Hence co^etousnes

The.xxi. Chapter.
ANd when king Arad the cananite which dwelt in the south parties / hard tell
that Israel came by the way that the spies had found out: he came and fought
with Israel and took some of them presoners. Then Israel vowed a vow unto the
Lord and said: If thou will give this people in to our hands / we will
destroy their cities. And the Lord herd ye voice of Israel / and delivered
them the Cananites. And they destroyed both them and their cities / and called
the place Horma.

Then they departed from mount hortowarde the redd se: to compass the land of
Edo^. And the souls of the people faynted by the way. And the people spoke
agenst God and agenst Moses: wherefore have thou brought us out of Egipte / for
to dye in the wilderness for here is nether bred nor water / and our souls
lotheth this light bred.

Then the Lord sent fyrie serpents among the people / which stonge them: so
that much people dyed in Israel. And the people came to Moses and said: we
have sinned / for we have spoken agenst the Lord and agenst the make
intercession to the Lord / that he take a wayethe serpents from us And Moses
made intercession for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses: make the a
serpent and ha^ge it up for a sign / and let as many as are bytten look upon
it and they shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass and sert it up for a
sign And when the serpents had bytten any man / he went and beheld the
serpent of brass and recovered.

And the childern of Israel removed and pitched in Oboth. And they departed
from Oboth and lay at Egebarim in the wilderness which is before Moab on the
cast side. And they removed thence / and pitched ap^^ the river of zarad. And
they departed thence and pitched on the other side of Arno^ / which river is in
the wilderness / and comes out of the costs of the Amorites: for Arnon is
the border of Moab / between Moab and the Amorites. Wherefore it is spoken in
the book of the war of the Lord: goo with a violence / both on the river of
Arnon and on the ryuers heed / which sho^eth down to dwell at Ar / and leneth
upon the costs of Moab.

And from thence they came to Bear / which is the well whereof the Lord spoke
unto Moses: gather the people together / that I may give them water. Then
Israel sange this song: Arise up well / sing thereto: The well which the
rulers dygged and the captains of the people with the help of the lawegeuer
and with their staves.

And from this wilderness they went to Ma^ana / and from Ma^ana to Nahali^l /
and from Nahali^l to Bamoth / and from Bamoth to the valay that is in the field
of Moab in the top of Pisga which boweth toward the wilderness.

And Israel sent messengers unto Siho^ / king of the Amorites saying: let us
goo through thy land. we will not turn in to thy feldes nor in to thy
vyneyardes / nether drink of the water of the wells: but we will goo alonge
by the common way / until we be past thy contre. And Siho^ would give Israel
no license to pass through his contre / but gathered all his people together
and went out against Israel in to the wilderness. And he came to Iaheza and
fought with Israel.

And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and conquered his land /
from Arnon unto Iabock: even unto the childern of Ammon. for the borders of the
childern of Ammon / are strong. And Israel took all these cities and dwelt in
all y^ cities of y^ Amorites: in Esbon and in all the towns that long there
to. For Esbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites which Sihon had
fought before with the king of the Moabites / and had taken all his land out
of his hand / even unto Arnon.

Wherefore it is a proverb: goo to Hesbo^ and let the city of Sihon be bylt
and made redye for there is a fire gone out of Hesbon and a flame from the
city of Siho^ and has consumed Ar of the Moabites and the men of the hills
of Arnon. Woe be to the Moab: o people of Chemos ye are forloren. His sons are
put to flighte and his daughters brought captyne unto Sihon king of the
Amorites. There light is out from Hesbon unto ^^bon and we made a wilderness
even unto Nopha which reaches unto Mediba. And thus Israel dwelt in the
land of the Amorites.

And Moses sent to search out Iaezer / and they took the towns belonging
thereto and conquered the Amorites that were there. And then they turned and
went up toward Basin. And Og the king of Basin came out agenst them / both
he and all his people / to war at Edrei. And the Lord said unto Moses:
fear him not / for I have delivered him in to thy hands with all his people
and his land. And thou shall do with him as thou dydest with Sihon the king
of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon. And they smote him and his sons and
all his people / until there was nothing left him. And they conquered his
land. And y^ children of Israel removed and pitched in the feldes of Moab / on
the other side of Iordane / by Jericho.

The.xxij. Chapter.
ANd Balac the son of Ziphor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites /
and the Moabites were sore a frayed of the people / because they were many /
and abhorred the childern of Israel: And Moab said unto the elders of Madian /
now this company has lickte up all that are round about us / as an ox
lycketh up the grass of the field. And Balac the son of Ziphor was king of
the Moabites at that time.

And he sent messangers unto Balam the son of Beor / the interpreter which
dwelt upon the river of the land of the childern of his folk / to call him
saying: behold / there is a people come out of Egipte which covers the face
of the earth and lie even hard by me. Come now a felashippe and curse me this
people. For they are to myghtie for me / so pera^enture I might be able to
smite them and to drive them out of the land. For I wot that whom thou
blessest shall be blessed / and whom thou cursest shall be cursed.

And the elders of Moab went with the elders of Madian / and the reward of the
sothe saying in their hands. And they came unto Balam and told him the
words of Balac. And he said unto them: tarry here all night and I will bring
you word / even as the Lord shall say unto me. And the lords of Moab abode
with Balam.

And god came unto Balam and said: what men are these which are with the* And
Balam said unto god: Balac the son of Ziphor king of Moab has sent unto me
saying: behold / there is a people come out of Egipte and covers the face
of the earth: come now therefore and curse me them / that so peradventure I may
be able to overcome them in batell / and to drive the^ out. And god said unto
Balam: thou shall not goo with them / nether curse the people / for they are
blessed.

And Balam rose up in the morning and said unto the lords of Balac: get you
unto your land / for the Lord will not suffer me to goo with you. And the
lords of Moab rose up and went unto Balac and said Balam would not come with
us. And Balac sent again a greatter company of lords and more honorable than
they. And they came to Balam and told him: Thus says Balac the son of
Ziphor: oh / let nothing let the to come unto me / for I will greatly promote
the unto great honor / and will do whatsoever thou say unto me / come
therefore I pray the / curse me this people.

And Balam answered and said unto the servauntes of Balac: If Balac would give
me his housfull of silver and gold / I can goo no further than the word of
the Lord my god / to do less or moare. Nevertheless tarry ye here all
night: that I may were / what the Lord will say unto me once moare. And God
came to Balam by night and said unto him: If the men come to fett the / rise
up and goo with them: but what I say unto the / that only thou shall do.

And Balam rose up carly and sadelde his ass and went with the lords of
Moab / But God was angrye because he went. And the angel of the Lord stood in
the way agenste him. And he ryd upon his ass and two servants with him.
And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord stand in the way and his
sword drawn in his hand / she turned a side out of the way and went out in
to the field. And Balam smote the ass / to turn her in to the way.

And the angel of the Lord went and stood in a path between the vyneyardes /
where was a wall on the one side and another on the other. When the ass saw
the angel of the Lord / she wrenshed unto the wall and thrust* Balams foot
unto the wall / and he smote her again. And the angel of y^ Lord went forder
and stood in a narowe place / where was no way to turn / either to the right
hand or to the lift. And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord / she
fell down under Balam: and Balam was wroth and smote the ass with a staff.

And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass / and she said unto Balam: what
have I done unto the / that thou smytest me this. iij times? And Balam said
unto the Ass: because thou have mocked me? I would that I had a sword in mine
hand / that I might now kill the. And the ass said unto Balam: am not I
thine ass which thou have rydden upon sense thou wast borne un to this day?
Was I ever wont to do so unto the? And he said / nay.

And the lord opened the eyes of Balam that he saw the angel of the Lord
stondinge in the way / with his sword drawn in his hand. And he bowed him
self and fell flatt on his face. And y^ angel of y^ Lord said unto him:
Wherefore smytest thou thine ass this.iij. times? behold / I came out to
resyst the / for the way is contrary unto me: and the ass saw me and avoided
me three times: or else (had she not turned fro me) I had suerly slain the and
saved her alive. And Balam said unto the angel of y^ Lord: I have sinned:
for I wist not that thou stodest in the way agenst me. Now therefore if it
displease thine eyes / I will turn again. And the angel said unto Balam /
goo with the men: but in any wise / what I say unto the / that say. And Balam
went with the lords of Balac.

And when Balac herd that Bala^ was come he went out agenst him unto a city
off Moab that stood in the border of Arno^ / which was the vttmost part of
his c^ntre. And Balac said unto Balam: did I not send for the / to call the?
wherefore came thou not unto me? think thou that I am not able to promote
the unto honor? And Balam said unto Balac: Loo I am come unto the. But I can
say nothing at all save what God puts in my mouth that must I speak. And
Balam went with Balac / and they came unto the city of Buzoth. And Balac
offered oxen and sheep / and sent for Balam and for the lords that were with
him.

The.xxiij. Chapter.
ANd on the morning Balac took Balam and brought him up in to the hye place
of Baall / and thence he saw unto the vttmost part of the people. And Balam
said unto Balac: bylde me here seven alters and provide here seven oxen and
seven rams. And Balac did as Balam said. And Balac and Balam offered on
every alter an ox and a ram. And Balam said unto Balac: stand by the
sacrifyce / while I goo to wete whether the Lord will come and mete me: and
what soever he shows me / I will tell the / and he went forthwith.

And god came unto Balam / and Balam said unto him: I have prepared.vij.
alters / and have offered apo^ every alter / an ox and a ram. And y^ Lord put
a saying in Bala^s mouth and said: goo again to Balac and say on this wise.
And he went again unto him and loo / he stood by his sacrifice / both he and
all the lords of Moab. And he began his parable and said: Balac the king of
Moab has fett me fro Mesopotamia out of the mountains of the east saying:
come and curse me Jacob / come and defye me Israel. How shall I curse whom God
curses not The pope ca^tell how.
and how shall I defye whom the Lord defyeth note from the top of y^ rocks
Ise him and from the hills I behold him: loo / ye people shall dwell by him
self and shall not be re^ened among other nations. Who can tell the dust of
Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel. I pray God that my soul /
may dye the deeth of the righteous / and that my last end may be like his.

And Balac said unto Balam / what have thou done unto me? I fett y^ to curse
mine enemies: and behold / thou blessest them. And he answered and said: must
I not keep that and speak it / which the Lord has put in my mouth? And
Balac said unto him: Come I pray the with me unto another place / whence thou
shall se them / and shall se but y^ vtmoste part of them and shall not se them
all and curse me them there.

And he brought him in to a plain field where men might se far / even to the
top of Pisga / and bylt.vij. alters and offered an ox and a ra^ on every
alter. And he said unto Balac: stand here by thy sacrifyce while I goo
yonder. And the Lord met Balam and put words in his mouth and said: goo
again unto Balac and thus say. And when he came to him: behold / he stood by
his sacrifyce and the lords of Moab with him And Balac said unto him: what
says y^ Lord?

And he took up his parable and said: rise up Balac and hear / and harken
unto me thou son of Ziphor The Lord is not a man / that he can lie / nether
the son of a man that he can repent: should he say and not do / or should
he speak and not make it good? behold / I have begone to bless and have
blessed / and can not goo back there fro. He beheld no wikednesse in Jacob nor
saw Idolatrye in Israel: The Lord his God is with him / and the trompe of a
king among the^. God that brought them out of Egipte / is as the strength of
an vny corn unto them / for there is no sorcerer / in Jacob / nor soth sayer
in Israel. When the time comes / it wild said of Jacob and of Israel / what
God has wrought Behold / y^ people shall rise up as a lioness and heue up
him self as a lion / and shall not lie down again / until he have eaten of
the pray and drenke of the blood of them that are slain.

And Balac said unto Balam: nether curse them nor bless the^. And Balam
answered and said unto Balac: told not I the saye^ge / all that the Lord
byddeth me / y^ I must do? And Balac said unto Balam: come I pray the / I
will bring the yet unto another place: so per adventure it shall please God /
that thou may curse the^ there. And Balac brought Balam unto the top of
Peor / that boweth toward the wilderness. And Balam said unto Balac: make me
here.vij. alters / and prepare me here.vij. bollockes and.vij. ra^mes And Balac
did as Balam had said / and offered a bollocke and a ram on every alter.

The.xxiiij. Chapter.
WHen Balam saw that it pleased y^ Lord that he should bless Israel / he
went not as he did twyse before to fett sothsayenge / but set his face toward
y^ wilderness / and lift up his eyes and looked upon Israel as he lay with
his trybes / and the spirit of God came upon him. And he took up his parable
and said: Bala^ the son of Beor has said / and the man whose eye is open
has said: he has said which hears the words of God and sees the visions
of the almighty / which falls down and his eyes are opened.

How goodly are the tents of Jacob and thi^e habitacions Israel / even as the
broad ^^leyes and as gardens by the ryuers side / as the tents which the Lord
has pitched and as ^perstrces upon the water. The water shall flow out of his
boket and his seed shall be many waters / and his king shall be hyer then Agag /
And his kingdom shall be exalted. God that brought him out of Egipte is as the
strenght of an unicorn unto him / and he shall eat the nations that are his
enemies and break their bones and perse them through with his arowes. He
couched him self and lay d^^ne as a lion and as a lioness / who shall stere
him up? blessed is he that blesses the / and cursed is he that curses the.

And Balac was wroth with balam and smote his hands together / and said unto
him: I sent for the to curse mine enemies: and behold / thou have blessed them
this three times / and now get the quyckly unto thy place. I thought that I
would promote the unto honor / but the Lord has kept the back from
worshepe. And Balam said unto Balac: told I not thy messe^gers which thou
sentest unto me saying: If balac would give me his house full of silver and
gold / I can not pass the mouth of the Lord / to do either good or bad of
mine own mind. What the Lord says / that must I speak. And now behold /
I goo unto my people: come let me shewethe / what this people shall do tothi
folk in the later days.

And he began his parable and said: Balam the son of Beor has said / and
y^ man that has his eye open has said / and he has said that hears the
words of God and has the knowledge of the most hye and beholds y^ vision of
the almighty / and when he falls down has his eyes opened. I se him but
not now / I behold him but not nigh. There shall come a star of Jacob and
rysea cepter of Israel / which shall smite yt coostes of Mo ab and undermine
all the childern of Seth. And Edom shall be his possession / and y^ possession of
Seir shall be their enimyes / and Israel shall do manfully. And out of Jacob
shall come he that shall destroy the remnau^t of the cities.

And he looked on Amaleck and began his parable and said: Amaleck is the first
of the nations / but his latter end shall perysh utterly. And he looked on the
Renites / and took his parable and said: strong is thy dwelling place and
put thinest upon a rock / Never the later thou shall be a burning to Rain /
until Assure take y^ prisoner. And he took his parable and said: Alas / who
shall live when God does this? The ships shall come out of the cost of
Cittim and subdue Assure and subdue Eber / and he him self shall perysh at the
last. And Balam rose up and went and dwelt in his place: and Balac also went
his way.

The.xxv. Chapter.
ANd Israel dwelt in Sittim / and the people began to commytt whoredom with
the daughters of Moab / which called the people unto y^ sacrifyce of their
gods. And the people are and worshipped their gods / and Israel coupled him
self unto Baal Peor. Then ye Lord was angry with Israel / and said unto
Moses: take all y^ heedes of the people / and hang them up unto yt Lord
agenst the son / that the wrath of the Lord mayeturne away from Israel. And
Moses said unto the judges of Israel: goo and slay those men that joined the^
selves unto Baal Peor.

And behold / one of the childern of Israel came and brought unto his
brethern / a Madianitish wife even in the sight of Moses and in the sight of
all the multitude of ye childern of Israel / as they were weeping in the door
of the tabernacle of witness. And when Phineas the son of Eleazer the son
of Aaron the preast saw it / he rose up out of the company and took a wepon
in his hand / and went after the man of Israel in to the horchousse / and
thrust them through: both the man of Israel and also the woman even through the
belie of her. And the plage ceased from the childern of Israel. And there dyed
in the plage.xxiiij. thousand.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Phineas the son of Eleazer the son
of Aaron the preast / has turned mine anger away from the childern of Israel
/ because he was gelous for my sake among them / that I had not consumed the
childern of Israel in my gelousye. Wherefore say: behold / I give unto him my
couenaunte of pease / and he shall have it and his seed after him / even the
couenaunte of the preastis office for ever / because he was gelous for his Gods
sake and made an atonement for the childern of Israel.

The name of the Israelite which was smytten with the Madianitish wife / was
S^^ri the son of Sal^ / a lord of an ancient honsse among the Simeonites.
And the name of the Madianitish wife / was Cosbi the daughter of Zur and heed
over the people of a^ ancient housse in Madian.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: vex the Madianites and smite them /
for they have troubled you with their wiles with the which they have begyled
you / through P^or and through their sister Cosby y^ daughter of a lord in
Madian / which was slain in y^ day of the plage for Peors sake.

multitude in the door of the tabernacle of witness saying: our father dyed
in the wilderness / and was not among the company of them that gathered them
selves together agenst the Lord in the congregation of Corah: But dyed in his
own sin / and had no sons. Wherefore should the name of our fathers be
taken away from among his kynred / because he had no son? Give unto us a
possessyon among the brethern of our father.

And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. And ye Lord spoke unto Moses
saying: The daughters of Zelaphead speak right: thou shall give them a
possession to en herett among their fathers brethern / and shall turn the
enheritaunce of their father unto them. And speak unto the childern of Israel
saying: If a man dye and have no son ye shall turn his enheritaunce unto
his daughter. If he have no daughter / ye shall give his enheritaunce unto his
brethern. If he have no brethern / ye shall give his enheritaunce unto his
fathers brethern. If he have no fathers brethern / ye shall give his
enheritaunce unto him that is next to him of his kindred / and let him possess
it. And this shall be unto the childern of Israel an ordinance / and a law / as
the Lord has commanded Moses.

And the Lord said unto Moses: get ye up in to this mount Aabrun / and
behold / the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. And when
thou have seen it / thou shall be gathered unto thy people also / as Aaron thy
brother was gathered unto his people. For ye were disobedient unto my mouth in
the deserte of Zin in y^ strife of the congregation / that ye sanctified me not
in the water before their eyes. That is the water of strife in cades in the
wilderness of Zin. And Moses O faithful and merciful Moses full onlike our
Balams.
spoke unto the Lord saying: let the Lord God of the spirits of all flesh /
set a man over the congregation / which may goo in and out before them / and
to lead them in and out that the congregation of the Lord be not as a flock
of sheep without a sheparde.

And ye Lord said unto Moses: take Josua the son of Nun in whom there is
spirit / and put thine hands upon him / and set There was ^f likelyhod a
^ryght stonne ^^ the ephod / ^^here^ the hie ^reast looked and ^awe the will ^f
God in ty^^es of neade / ^s thou may ^e in the story of David: This was the
^aner of the Ebrues to ma^e their office^s and of this manner did the apostle
make de^kons / preastes and bishopes / with out any other ceremony as thou
^eist i^ thactes / and may gather of paul to Timothe: Bred is here borrowed
and taken for all manner of sode generally:
him before Eleazer the preast and before all the congregation and give him a
charge in their fight. And put of thy praise upon him that all the company of
ye childern of Israel may hear. And he shall stand before Eleazer y^ preast
which shall axe council for him after y^ manner of the * light before ye
Lord: And atthe mouth of Eleazer shall both he and all the childern of Israel
with him and all the congregation / goo in and out.

And Moses did as the Lord commanded him / and he took Josua and set him
before Eleazer the preast and before all the congregation / and * put his
hands upon him and gave him a charge / as the Lord commanded through the
hand of Moses.

The.xxviij. Chaptre

The.xxx. Chapter.
ANd Moses spoke unto the heedes of Hence was fetrthe example of our vows of
chastity / obediens and wilful poverty: our offerynges and our pilgremage.
the trybes of y^ childern of Israel saye^ge: this is the thing which the
Lord commands. If a man vow a vow unto the Lord or swear an oath and
bind his soul / he shall not goo ba^ke with his word: but shall fulfill all
y^ proceadeth out of his mouth

If a damsel vow a vow unto y^ Lord and bind herself being in her
fathers housse and unmarried: If her father hear her vow and bond which she
has made upon her soul / and hold his pease thereto: then all her vows and
bo^des which she has made upon her soul shall stand in effect. But and if
her father for bid her the same day that he hears it / none of her vows nor
bonds which she has made upon her soul shall be of value / and the Lord
shall forgive her / because her father forbade her.

If she had an husbonde when she vowed or pronounsed ought out of her lips
wherewith she bond her soul / and her husbonde her de it and held his peace
there at the same day he herd it: Then her vows and her bonds wherewith she
bound her soul / shall stand in effect. But and if her husbonde forbade her
the same day that he herd it / than has he made her vow which she had upon
her of none effect / and that also which she pronounsed with her lips
wherewith she bound her soul / and the Lord shall forgive her.

The vow of a wedowe and of her that is deuorsed / and all that they have
bound their souls with all / shall stand in effect with them.

If she vowed in her husbands housse or bound her soul with an oath / and her
husband herd it and held his peace and forbade her not: then all her vows
and bonds wherewith she bound her soul / shall sto^de. But if her husband
disanulled them y^ same day that he herd them / then nothing that proceeded
out of her lips in vows and bounds wherewith she bound her soul shall
stand in effect: for her husband has lowsed them / and the Lord shall
forgive her.

All vows and oaths that bind to humble the soul / may her husband
stablish or break. But if her husband hold his peace from one day unto
another / then he stablisheth all her vows and bounds which she had upon
her / because he held his peace the sa^^e day that he herd them. And if he
afterward break them / he shall bear her sin him. self.

These are the ordinances which y^ Lord commanded Moses / between a man and
his wife / and between the father and his daughter / beyenge a damsel in her
fathers housse.

The.xxxi. Chapter.
ANd the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: avenge the childern of Israel of the
Madianites / and afterward be gathered unto thy people. And Moses spoke unto
the folk saying: Harness some of you unto war / and let them goo upon the
Madianites and avenge the Lord of the Madianitis. Ye shall send unto the
war a thousand of every try be through out all the trybes of Israel. And
there were taken out of the thousands of Israel.xij. thousand prepared unto
war / of every trybe a thousand. And Moses sent them a thousand of every
trybe / with Phineas the son of Eleazer the preaste to war / and the holy
vessels and the trompettes to blow with in his hand.

And they warred agenst the Madianites / as the Lord commanded Moses / and
^lewe all the males. And they slew the kings of Madian among other that were
slain: Eui / Rekem / Zur / Hur and Reba: fine kings of Madian. And they slew
Bala^ the son of Beor with the sword. And the childern of Israel took all
the women of Madian presoners and their childern / and spoiled all their catell
/ their substance and their goods. And they burnt all their cities wherein
they dwelt / and all their castles with fire. And they roke all the spoil and
all they could catch / both of men and beestes. And they brought the captyues
and that which they had taken and all the spoil unto Moses and Eleazer the
preast and unto the company of the childern of Israel: even unto the host /
in y^ feldes of Moab by Jordanenye to Jericho.

And Moses and Eleazer the preast and all the lords of the congregation went
out of the host agenst them. And Moses was angry with the officers of the
host / with y^ captains over thousands and over hundredes / which came from
war and battle / and said unto them: Have ye saved the women alive? behold
/ these caused the childern of Israel through Balam / to commytt trespace against
y^ Lord / by y^ reason of Peor / and their followed a plage among y^
congregation of the Lord. Now therefore slay all the men childern and the
women that have ly^^ with men fleshlye: But all the women children that have
not lain with men / keep alive for your selves. And lodge without the
host.vij. days all that have killed any person and all that have twiched any
dead body / and purifye both your selves and your presoners the.iij. day and
the.vij. And sprinkle all your raymentes and all that is made of skynnes / and
all work of gootes here / and all things made of wodd.

And Eleazer the preast said unto all y^ me^ of war which went out to
battle: this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses:
Gold / silver / brass / yeron / tyn and leed / and all that may abide y^ fire
/ ye shall make it goo through the fire / and then it is clean. Neuerthelater /
it shall be sprinkled with sprinklinge water. And all y^ soffereth not the fire /
ye shall make goo through the water. And wash your clothes the seventh day /
and then ye are clean. And afterward come in to the host.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: take the sum of the pray that was
taken / both of the weme^ and of catell / thou and Eleazer the preast and the
ancient heedes of y^ congregation. And deuyde it into two parties / between
them that took the war upon the^ and went out to battle and all the
congregation. And take a portion unto the Lord of the men of war which went
o^te to battle one of five hundred / of the women and of the oxen and of the
asses and of the sheep: and ye shall take it of their half and give it unto
Eleazer the preast / an heueofferynge unto the Lord. And of the half of y^
childern of Israel / take one of fystye / of y^ women / of the oxen / of the
asses and of the sheep / and of all manner of beestes / and give them unto the
levites which wait upon ye habitacion of the Lord.

And Moses and Eleazer the preast did as the Lord commanded Moses. And y^
botye and the pray which the men of war had caught / was.vi. hundred
thousand and lxxv. thousand sheep: and.lxxij. thousand ox en: and.lxi.
thousand asses: and.xxxij. thousand women that had lain by no man.

And the half which was the part of the^ that went out to war / was.iij.
hundred thousand and.xxxvij. thousand and five hundred sheep: And the Lords
part of the sheep was.vi. hundred and.lxxv. And the oxen were.xxxvi. thousand
/ of which the Lords part was.lxxij.. And the asses were.xxx. thousand and
five hundred / of which the Lords part was.lxi.. And the women were.xvi.
thousand / of which the Lords part was.xxxij. souls. And Moses gave that
sum which was the Lords heueofferynge unto Eleazer the preast: as the Lord
commanded Moses.

And the other half of the childern of Israel which Moses separated from the
men of war (that is to were / the half that pertayned unto the congregation)
was.iij. hundred thousand and.xxxvij. thousand and five hundred sheep:
and.xxxvi. thousand oxen: and.xxx. thousand asses and five hundred: and.xvi.
thousand women. And Moses took of this half that pertayned unto the childern
of Israel: one of every fyftie / both of the women and of the catell / and gave
them unto the levites which waited upon the habitacion of the Lord / as the
Lord commanded Moses.

And the officers of thousands of the host / the captains over the
thousands and the captains over the hundreds came forth and said unto Moses:
Thy servauntes have taken the sum of the men of war / which were under our
hand / and there lacked not one man of them. We have therefore brought a
present unto the Lord what every man found of Jewels of gold / cheyns /
bracelettes / ringes / earynges and spangels / to make an atonement for our
souls before the Lord.

And Moses and Eleazer took the gold off them: Jewels of all manner facions.
And all the gold of the heueoffrynge of the Lord / of the captains over
thousands and hundreds was.xvi. thousand.vij. hundred and.l. sycles / which y^
me^ of war had spoiled / every man for him self. And Moses and Eleazer y^
preast took the gold of the captains over the thousands and over the
hundreds / and brought it in to the tabernacle of witness: to be a memorial
unto y^ childern of Israel / before y^ Lord.

The* xxxij. Chapter.
THe childern of Rube^ and the childern of Gad / had an exceadinge great
multitude of catell. And when they saw the lord of Iaeser and the lord of
Gilead y^ it was an apt place for catell / they came and spoke unto Moses and
Eleazer y^ preast and unto y^ lords of y^ co^gregacio^ saying. The lord of
Ataroth Dibo and Beon / which contre y^ Lord smote before the congregation of
Israel: is a land for catell and we thy servauntes have catell wherefore (said
they) if we have found grace in thy syghte / let this land be given unto thy
servauntes to possess / and bring us not over Iordane.

And Moses said unto the children of Gad and of Ruben: shall your brethern
goo to war and yetarye here? Wherefore discorage ye the hertes of the children
of Israel for to goo over in to the land which the Lord has given them? This
did your fathers / when I sent them from Cades bernea to sethe land. And they
went up even unto the river of Escol and saw the land / and discoraged the
he^tes of the childern of Israel / that they should not goo into the land
which the Lord had given them.

And the Lord was wroth the same time and swear saying: None of the men that
came out of Egipte from twentye year old and above / shall se the land which
I swore unto Abraham / Isaac and Jacob / because they have not continually
followed me: save Caleb the son of Iephune the Benesite / and Joshua the son
of Nun / for they have followed me continually. And the Lord was angry with
Israel / and made them wandre in the wilderness.xl. year / until all the
generation that had done evil in the syghte of the Lord were consumed.

And behold / ye are risen up in your fathers stead / the increase of sinful
men / to augmente the ferse wrath of the Lord to Israel ward. For if ye turn
away from after him / he will yet again leave the people in the wilderness /
so shall ye destroy all this folk.

And they went nere him and said: we will bylde shepefoldes here for our
sheep and for our catell / and cities for our childern: But we our selves
will go ready armed before ye childern of Israel / until we have brought them
unto their place. And our children shall dwell in the strong cities / because
of the inhabiters of the land. And we will not return unto our housses /
until the childern off Israel have enhereted: every man his enheritaunce. For
we will not enheret with them on yonder side Iordane forward / because our
enheritaunce is fallen to us on this side Iordane eastwarde.

And Moses said unto them: If ye will do this thing / that ye will go all
harnessed before the Lord to war / and will go all of you in harness over
Iordane before y^ Lord / until he have cast out his enemies before him / and
until the land be subdyed before y^ Lord: then ye shall return and be
without sin agenst the Lord and agenst Israel / and thie lord shall be your
possession before the Lord. But and if ye will not do so / behold / ye sin
agenst the Lord: and be sure your sin will find you out. Bilde your
cities for your childern and foldes for your sheep / and se ye do y^ ye have
spoken.

And the childern of Gad and of Ruben spoke unto Moses saying: thy servauntes
will do as my lord commands. Our children our wines substance and all
our catell shall remain here in the cities of Gilead. But we thy servauntes
will goo all harnessed for the war unto battle before the Lord / as my
lord has said.

And Moses commanded Eleazer y^ preast and Joshua y^ son of Nun and the
ancient hedes of the tribes of the childern of Israel / and said unto them:
If the childern of Gad and Ruben will goo with you over Iordane / all prepared
to syghte before the Lord: then when the land is subdued unto you / give them
the land of Gilead to possess / but and if they will not goo over with you in
harness / then they shall have their possessions among you in y^ land of
Canaan. And the childern of Gad and Ruben answered saying: that which y^ Lord
has said unto thy servants we will do We will goo harnessed before the
Lord in to the land of Canaan / and the possession of our enheritaunce
shall be on this side the Iordane.

And Moses gave unto y^ childern of Gad and of Ruben and unto half the try be
of Manasse the son of Joseph / the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites /
and the kingdom of Ogkynge of Basan / the land that longed unto the cities
thereof in the costs of the contre round about. And the childern of Gad bylt
Dibo^ / ataroth / Aroer / Atroth / So phan / Iaeser / Iegabcha / Bethnimra and
Betharan strong cities / and they bylt foldes for their sheep. And the
childern of Ruben bylt Besebon / Elalea / Ririathaim / Nebo / Baal Meon and
turned their names / and Sibama also: and gave names unto the cities which they
bylt.

And the childern of Machir the son of Manasse went to Gilead and token / and
put out the Amorites y^ were therein. And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the
son of Manasse / and he dwelt therein. And Iair the son of Manasse went and
took y^ small towns thereof / and called the^ the towns of Iair. And Nobah
went and took kenath with the towns longinge thereto / and called it Nobah
after his own name.

possess ye land and dwell therein / for I have given you the land to enjoy
it. And ye shall deuyde the enheritaunce of the land by lot among your
kynreddes / and give to the moo the moare enheritaunce / and to the fewer the
less enheritaunce. And your enheritaunce shall be in y^ tryhes of your fathers

But and if ye will not dryne out the inhabiters of y^ land before you / then
these which ye let remain of the^ / shall be thorns in your eyes and darts in
your sides / and shall vex you in the lord wherein ye dwell. More over it
will come to pass / y^ I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them.

and the city shall be in the mids. And these shall be the suburbs of their
cities.

And among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites / there shall be
six cities of fraundyes which ye shall give to that intent that he which
kills / may fly thither. And to them ye shall add.xlij. cities mo: so that
all the cities which ye shall give the levites shall be.xlviij. with their
suburbs.

And of the cities which ye shall give out of the possessions of the childern
of Israel / ye shall give many out of their possessions that have much and
few out of their possessions that have little: so that every tribe shall give
of his cities unto the levites / acordinge to the enheritaunce which he
enhereteth.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: speak unto the childern of Israel and
say unto them: when ye be come over Jordayne into the land of Canaan / ye
shall bylde cities which shall be preuyleged towns for you: that he which
sleeth a man unawares / may flyethither. And the cities shall be to flee from the
executer of blood / that he which killed dye not / until he stand before
the congregation in indgement. And of these vi. fre cities which ye shall
give.iij. ye shall The right use of senetuaryes.
give on this side Jordayne and. i^j. in y^ land of Canaan. And these six fre
cities shall be for the childern of Israel and for the stranger and for him that
dwells among you / y^ all they which kill any person unawares / may
fl^^rhuher.

If any man smite another with a wepo^ of yerne that he dye / than he is a
murderer / and shall dye for it.

If he smite him with a throwinge stone that he dye therewith / then he shall
dye: for he is a murderer and shall be slain therefore.

If he smite him with a handwepon of wodd that he dye therewith / then he shall
dye: for he is a murderer and shall be slain the^fore.

The judge of blood shall ^^ee the murderer / as soon as he fyndeth him: If
he ^h^ust him of hate or hourle at him with layenge of wait that he dye or
smite him with his hand of envy that he dye / he that smote him shall dye /
for he is a murderer. The justice of blood shall slay him as soon as he
fyndeth him.

But and if he pusshed him by chance and not of hate or cast at him with any
manner of thing and nor of layenge of wait: or cast any manner of stone at him
that he dye therewith / and saw him not: And he cast it upon him and he dyed /
but was not his enemies nether sought him any harm: Then the congregation
shall judge between the sleer and the executer of blood in soche cases. And
the congregation shall deliver the sleer out of the hand of the judge of
blood / and shall restore him again unto the fraun^^esed city / whother he
was fleed. And he shall bide there unto the death off the hye prcaste which
was anointed with holy ^yle.

But and if he came without the borders of his preuyleged city whether he was
fled / if the bloudvenger find him without the borders of his fre town / he
shall slay the murderer and be giltlesse / because he should have bidden in
his fre town until the death of the hye preaste / and after the death of the
hye preast / he shall return again unto the land of his possessyon. And this
shall be an ordinance and a law unto you / among your childern after you in
all your habitacions.

Whosoever sleeth / shall be ^laine at ye mouth of witnesses. For one witness
shall not answer agenste one person to put him to deeth. Moreover ye shall
take none amends for the life of the murderer which is worthy to dye: But he
shall be putto deeth. Also ye shall take none atonement for him y^ is fled to a
fre city / that he should come again and dwell in the land before the deeth
of the hye preast.

And se that ye polute not the land which ye are in / for blood defyleth the
land. And the land can none other wise be cleansed of y^ blood that is shed
therein / but by the blood of it that shed it. ^efyle notherfore the land
which ye in habitt / and in the mids of which I also dwell / for I am y^
Lord which dwell among the childern of Israel.

The.xxxvi. Chapter.
ANd the auncye^t heedes of the childern of Gilead the son of Machir y^ son
of Manasse of the kynred of y^ childern of Joseph / came forth and spoke before
Moses and the princes which were ancient heedes among the childern of Israel
and said: The Lord commanded my lord to give y^ land to enherette by lotte
to the childern of Israel. And then my lord commanded in y^ name of the Lord
to give the enheritaunce of Zelaphead our brother unto his daughters. Now when
any of the sons of the trybes of Israel take them to wy^es / then shall their
enheritaunce be taken from the enheritaunce of our fathers / and shall be put
unto the enheritaunce of the trybe in which they are and shall be taken from the
lot of our enheritaunce. And when the fre year comes unto the childern of
Israel / then shall their enheritaunce be put unto the enheritaunce of the
trybe where they are in / and so shall their enheritaunce betaken away from
the enheritaunce of the trybe of our fathers.

And Moses commanded the childern of Israel at the mouth of the Lord saying:
the trybe of y^ childern of Joseph have said well. This therefore does the
Lord commau^de the daughters of Zelaphead saying: let them be wy^es to whom
they the^ silfe think best / but in the kynred of the trybe of their father
shall they marye / that the enheritaunce of the childern of Israel roole not
from trybe to trybe. But that the childern of Israel may abide / every man in
the enheritaunce of the trybe of his fathers And every daughter that possesses
any enheritaunce among the trybes of the childern of Israel / shall be wife unto
one of the kynred of the trybe of her father / that the childern of Israel may
enjoy every man the enheritaunce of his father / and that the enheritaunce goo
not from one trybe to another: but that the trybes of the childern of Israel /
may abide every man in his own enheritaunce.

And as the Lord commanded Moses even so did the daughters of Zelaphead:
Mahela. Thirza / Hagla / Milca and Noa / ^d were married unto their fathers
brothers sons / of the kynted of the childern of Manasse the son of Joseph:
and so they had their enheritaunce in the trybe of the kynred of their father.

These are the commaundmentes and laws which the Lord commanded through Moses
/ unto the childern of Israel in the feldes of Moab upon Jordayne nigh unto
Jerich^.

The end of the.iiij. book of Moses.
A PROLOGE IN TO THE fyfte book of Moses, called Deuteronomye.
THis is a book worthy to be read in day and night and never to be out of
hands. For it is the most excellent of all the books of Moses It is easy also
and light and a very pure gospel that is to wete, a preachinge of faith and
love: deducinge the love to God out of faith, and the love of a man's
neighbor out of the love of God. Herin also thou may learn right meditacion
or contemplacyon, which is nothing else save the calling to mind and a
repeatyng in the heart of the gloriouse and wonderful deades of God, and of his
terreble handelinge off his enemies and merciful entreating of them that come
when he calls them which thing this book does and almost nothing else.

In the.iiij. first chaptres he reherseth the benefits of God done unto the^,
to provoke the^ to love, and his mighty deades done above all natural power
and beyond all natural capacite of faith, that they might believe God and
trust in him and in his strength. And thyrdlye he reherseth the firce plages of
God upon his enemies and on them which through impacientie and vnbele^^e fell
from him: partelye to tame and abate the appetites of the flesh which always
fight agenst the spirit, and partly to bridle the wild raginge lusts of
the^ in whom was no spirit: that though they had no power to do good of love,
yet at the lest way they should absteyne from outward evil for fear of
wrath and cruel vengeance which should fall upon them and shortly find them
out, if they cast up gods nurter and run at ryotte beyond his laws and
ordinances. Moreover he charge them to put naught to nor take ought away
from gods words, but to be diligent only to keep them in remembrance and
in the heart and to teach their childern, for fear of forgettinge. And to
beware either of making imagerye or of bowinge them selves unto images saying:
Ye sar^e no image when God spoke unto you, but herd avoyce only and that
voice keep and thereunto cleave, for it is your liffe and it shall save you.
And finally if (as the frayltie of al flesh is) they shall have fallen from God
and he have brought them in to troble, aduersyte, and co^braunce and all
necessite: yet if they repent and turn, he promyseth them that God shall
remember his mercy and receave the^ to grace again

In the fifte he repeteth the.x. commau^dme^tes and that they might se a cause
to do them of love, he bids them remember that they were bound in Egipte
and how God delivered them with a mighty hand and a stretchedout arm, to
serve him and to keep his commaundmentes: as Paul says that we are bought
with Christ's blood and therefore are his servauntes and not our own, and
ought to seek his will and honor only and to love and serve one another for
his sake.

In the sixte he sets out the fountain off all commaundmentes: that is,
that they believe how that there is but one God that does all, and therefore
ought only to be loved with all the herto, all the soul and all the might.
For love only is the fulfillinge of the commandments, as Paul also says
unto, the Romans and Galathians likewise. He warns the^ also that they
forgett not the commaundmentes, but teach the^ their childern and to show the
ir childern also how God delivered the^ out of the bondage of the Egiptia^s to
serve him and his commaundme^tes, that the childern might se a cause to work
of love, likewise.

The seventh is all together of faith: he remoueth all occasions that might
withdraw them from the faith, and pulls them also from all confidence in
them selves, and sturreth the^ up to trust in god boldlye and only.

Of the eight chaptre thou seyst how that the cause of all temptation is, that
a man might so his own heart. For when I am brought in to that extremite that
I must either suffer or forsake god, then I shall feale how much I believe and
trust in him, and how much I love him. In like manner, if my brother do me euel
for my good, then if I love him when there is no cause in him, I se that my
love was of god, and eue^ so if I then hate him, I feale and peaceave that my
love was but wordly, And finallye he sturreth the^ to the faith and love of
god, and dryveth them from all confidence of their own selves.

In the nynth also he moves the^ unto faith and to put their trust in god, and
draws the^ from confidence of them selves by rehearsinge all the wekednesse
which they had wrought from the first day he knew them unto that same day.
And in the end he repeteth how he coniured god in horeb and over came him with
prayer, where thou may learn the right manner to pray.

In the tenth he rekeneth up the pith of all laws and the kepinge of the law
in the heart: which is to fear god love him and serve him with all their heart
soul and might and keep his commaundmentes of love. And he shows a reason
why they, should that do: even because god is lord of heaven and earth and has
also done all for them of his own goodness without their deservinge. And then
out of the love unto god he brings the love unto a man's neighbor saying:
god is lord above all lords and loves all his servants indiffe rently, as
well the poor and feeble and the stranger, as the rich and mighty, and
therefore will that we love the poor and the stranger. And he adds a cause,
for ye were strangers and god delivered you and has brought you unto a land
where ye be at home. Love the stranger therefore for his sake.

In the.xi. he exhorts them to love and fear god, and reherseth the terrible
deeds off god upon his enemies, and on them that rebelled agenst him. And he
testifyeth unto the^ both what will follow if they love and fear god, and whate
also if they despise him and break his commaundment.

In the.xij. he commands to put out of the way all that might be an
occasion to hurt the faith and forbids to do ought after their own minds,
or to altre the word of god.

In the.xiij. he forbids to harken unto ought save unto gods word: no
though he which cou^seleth cotrarye should come with miracles, as Paul does
unto the Galathians.

In the. xiiij the beestes are forbidden, partly for the uncleanness of the^,
and partly to cause hate between the hethe^ and the^, that they have no
co^uersatio^ to gether, in that one abhors whatt the other eats. Unto
this.xv. chaptre all pertayne unto faith and love cheflye. And in this.xv. he
begins to entreat moare specially of things pertayninge unto the
comenwelth and equite and exhorts unto the love of a man's neighbor. And in
the.xvi. among other he forgets not the same. And in the xvij. he
ent^eateth of right and equite chefly, in so much that when he looks unto
faith and unto the, punishment of ydolatres, he yet ends in a law of love
and equite: forbiddinge to comdemne any man under less them two witnesses at
the lest and commands to bring the trespacers unto the open gate of the
city where all men goo in and out, that all men might hear the cause and se
that he had but right. But the pope has found a better way, even to apposse
him with out any accusare and that secretlye, that no man know whether he have
right or no, other hate his articles or answer: for fear lest the people
should search whether it ^^^re so or no.

In the. xviij he forbids all false and de^elish crastes that hurt true
faith. Moreover because the people could not hear the voice of the law spoken
to the^ in fire, he promises the^ another prophet to bri^ge the^ better
tydinges which was spoken of christ our savior.

The.xix. and so forth unto the end of the xxvij. is almost al together of
love unto our neygboures and of laws of equite and honestye with now and then
a respect unto faith.

The.xxviij. is a terreble chaptre and to be tre^bled at: A christian man's heart
might well bleed for sorrow at the readinge of it, for fear of the wrath that is
like to come upon us according unto all the curses which thou there read.
For acordinge unto these curses has god dealt with all nations, after they were
fallen in to the abhominacions of blindness.

The.xxix. is like terreble with a godly lesson in the end that we should leave
serchi^ge of gods secrettes and give diligence to walk according to that he
has opened unto us. For the kepi^ge of the co^mau^dme^tes of god teaches
wisdom as thou mayeste se in the same chapter, where Moses says, keep the
co^mau^dme^tes, that ye may understood whate ye ought to do. But to search
gods secrets bli^deth a man as it is well proved by the swarms of our
sophisters, whose wise books are now when we look i^ the scripture, found but
full of folishnesse.

The first Chapter of Deuteronomye
THese be the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel, on the other side
Iordayne in the wilderness and in the feldes by the red see, between Phara^
and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Disahab.xij. days iurney from Horeb unto Cades
bernea, by the way that leads unto mount Seir. And it fortuned the first
day of the.xi. month in the fortieth year, that Moses spoke unto the childern
of Israel acordinge unto all that the Lord had given him in commaundment unto
them, after that he had smote Sihon the king of the Amorites which dwelt in
Hesbon, and Og king of Basan which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei.

On the other side Iordayne in the land of Moab, Moses begane to declare this
law saying: the Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb saying: Ye have dwelt
long enough in this mount: depart therefore and take your iurney and goo unto
the hills of the Amorites and unto all places nigh there unto: both feldes,
hills and dales: and unto the south and unto the sees side in the land of
Canaan, and unto libanon: even unto the great river Euphrates. Behold, I have
set the land before you: goo in therefore and possess the land which the Lord
swear unto your fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give unto them and their
seed after them.

And I said unto you the same season: I am not able to bear you myself alone.
For the Lord your God has multiplied you: so that ye are this day as the
stars of heaven in number (the Lord god of your fathers make you a
thousand times so many moo as ye are, and bless you as he has promised you)
how (said I) can I myself alone, bear the combraunce, charge and stryste
that is among you: bring therefore men of wisdom and of understanding and
expert known among your trybes, that I may make them ruelars over you.

And ye answered me and said: that which thou have spoken is good to be done.
And then I took the heedes of your trybes, men of wisdom and that were
expert, and made them ruelers over you: captains over thousands and over
hundredes over fyftye and over ten, and officers among your trybes.

And I charged your Judges the same time Judges.
saying: hear your brethern and judge righteously between every man and his
brother and the straunges that is with him. Se that ye know no man in
Judgment: but hear the small as well as the great and be afraid of no man,
for the law is Gods. And the cause that is to hard for you, bring unto me
and I will hear it. And I commanded you the same season, all the things
which ye shul de do.

And then we departed from Horeb and walked through all that great and terreble
wilderness as ye have seen alonge by the way that ledeth unto the hills of
the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us, and came to Cades bernea.
And there I said unto you: Ye are come unto the hills of the Amorites, which
the Lord our God does give unto us. Behold the Lord thy God has set the
land before the, goo up and conquer it, as the Lord God of thy fathers
says unto the: fear not, nether be discoraged.

And then ye came unto me every one and said: Let us send men before us, to
search us out the land and to bring us word again, both what way we shall
goo up by, and unto what cities we shall come. And the saying pleassed me
well and I took.xij. men of you, of every trybe one. And they departed and went
up in to the hye contre and came unto the river Escoll, and serched it out, and
took of the fruit of the land in their hondes and brought it down unto us and
brought us word again and said: it is a good land which the Lord our God
does give us.

Notwithstondinge ye would not consent to goo up, but were dishobedient unto
the mouth of the Lord your God, and murmured in your tents and said:
because the Lord hates us, therefore he has brought us out of the land of
Egipte, to deliver us in to the hands of the Amorites and to destroy us. How
shall we goo up? Our brethern have discoraged our hearts saying: the people
is greater and taller than we, and the cities are greatte and walked even up
to heaven, and moreover we have seen the sons of the Enakimes there.

And I said unto you: dread not nor be afraid of the^: The Lord your God
which goes before you, he shall fight for you, acordynge to all that he did
unto you in Egipte before your eyes and in the wilderness: as thou have seen
how that the Lord thy God bare the as a man should bear his son, through out
all the way which ye have gone, until ye came unto this place. And yet for
all this saying ye did not believe the Lord your God which goes the way
before you, to search you out a place to pitche your tents in, in fire by
night, that ye might se what way to go and in a cloud by day.

And the Lord herd the voice of your words and was wroth and swore saying,
there shall not one of these men of this froward generation se that good land
which I swear to give unto your fathers, save Caleb the son of Iephune, he
shall se it, and to him I will give the land which he has walked in and to
his childern, because he has contynually followed the Lord. Likewise the Lord
was angrye with me for your sakes saying: thou also shall not go in thiter.
But Joshua the son of Nun which stondeth before the, he shall go in thither.
Bold him therefore for he shall deuyde it unto Israel. Moreover your childern
which ye said should be a pray, and your sons which know nether good nor
bad this day, they shall goo in thither and unto them I will give it, and they
shall enjoy it. But as for you, turn back and take your iurneye in to the
wilderness: even the way to the reed see.

Than ye answered and said unto me: We have sinned agenst the Lord: we will
goo up and fight, acordinge to all that the Lord our God commanded us. And
when ye had gyrde on every man his wepons of war and were ready to goo up in
to the hills, the Lord said unto me: say unto the^, se that ye go not up
and that ye fight not, for I am not among you lest ye be plaged before your
enemies. *. And when I told you ye would not hear: but Here thou se^st the
verey image of the papists. For they like wise where Gods word is, there they
believe not and where it is not there they be bold.
disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and went presumptously up in to the hills.

The^ the Amorites which dwelt in those hills, came out agenst you and chased
you as bees do, and hewed you in Seir, eue^ unto Horma. And ye came again and
wept before the Lord: but the Lord would not hear your voice nor give you
audience. And so ye abode in Cades alo^ge season, acordinge unto the time that
ye there dwelt.

The.ij. Chapter.
THen we turned and took our iurney in to the wilderness, even the way to
the red see as the Lord commanded me. And we compassed the mountayns of Seir a
long time The^ the Lord spoke unto me saienge: Ye have compassed this
mountayns long enough, turn you northwarde. And warn the people saying: Ye
shall goo through the costs of your brethern the childern of Esau which dwell
in Seir, and they shall be afraid of you: But take good head unto youreselues
that ye provoke the^ not, for I will not give you of their lord, no not so much
as a fo^e breadeth: because I have given mount Seir unto Esau to possess. Ye
shall bye meat of the^ for money to (...) and ye shall bye water of the^ for
money to dr^k^. For the Lord thy God has blessed the in all the works of
thine hand, and knew the as thou we^ test through this great wilderness.
Moreover the Lord thy God has been with the this. xl years, so that thou have
lacked nothing.

And when we were departed from our brethern the childern of Esau which dwelt
in Seir by the field way from Elath and Ezion Gaber, we turned and went the
way to the wilderness of Moab. The^ the Lord said unto me se that thou vex
not the Moabites, nether provoke the^ to battle for I will not give the of
their lord to possess: because I have given Ar unto the childern of loath to
possess. The Emimes dwelt there in in times past, a people great, many and
tal, as the Enakimes: which also were taken for geantes as the Enakimes: And
the Moabites called the^ Emymes. In like manner the Horimes dwelt in Seir before
time which the childern of Esau cast out, and destroyed the^ before them and
dwelt there in their stead: as Israel did in the land of his possession which
the Lord gave them

Now rise up (said I) and get you over the river Zared: and we went over the
river Zared. The space in which we came from Cades bernea until we were come
over the river Zared was.xxxviij. years: until all the generation of the men
of war were wasted out of the host as the Lord swear unto the^. For in deed
the hand of the Lord was against the^, to destroy them out of the host, till
they were consumed.

And as soon as all the men of war were consumed and deed from among the
people, then the Lord spoke unto me saying. Thou shall goo through Ar the
cost of Moab this day, and shall come nigh unto the childern of Ammon: se that
thou vex them not, nor yet provoke them. For I will not give the of the land
of the childern of Ammon to possess, because I have given it unto the childern
of loath to possess. That also was taken for a land of geauntes and geauntes
dwelt therim in old time, and the Ammonites called them Zamzumyms. A people
that was great, many and taule, as the Enakyms. But the Lord destroyed them
before the Ammonites, and they cast them out and they dwelt there i^ their
stead: as he did for the childern of Esau which dwell in Seir: eue^ as he
destroyed the horyms before them, and they cast them out and dwell in their
stead unto this day. And the Avims which dwelt in Hazarim eue^ unto Aza, the
Caphthoryms which came out of Caphthor destroyed them and dwelt in the ir
rowmes.

Rise up, take your yourney and goo over the river Arnon. Behold, I have
given in to thy hand Siho^ the Amorite king of Hesbo^, and his land. Goo to
and conquer and provoke hi^to battle. This day I will begin to send the
fear and dread of the upon all nations that are under al ports of heaven:
so that when they hear speak of the, they shall tremble and quake for fear
of the.

Then I sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto Syhon king of
Hesbon, with words of peace saying: Let me goo through thy land. I will goo
allweyes alonge by the hye way and will nether turn unto the right hand nor
to the left. Sell me meat for money for to eat, and give me drink for money
for to drink: I will goo through by foot only (as the childern of Esau did
unto me which dwell in Seir and the Moabites which dwell in Ar) until I be
come over Iordayne, in to the land which the Lord our God gives us.

But Sihon the king of Hesbon would not let us pass by him, for the Lord thy
God had hardened his sprite and made his heart tough because he would deliver
him in to thy hondes as it is come to pass this day.

And the Lord said unto me: behold, I have begone to set Sihon and his
land before the: goo to and conquer, that thou may possess his land. Then
both Sihon and all his people came out agenst us unto battle at Iahab. And the
Lord set him before us, and we smote him and his sons and all his people.

And we took all his cities the same season, and destroyed all the cities with
men, women, and childern and let nothing remain, save the catell only we
caught unto our selves and the spoil of the cities which we took, from Aroer
upon the brynke off the river off Arnon, and the city in the river, unto
Gilead: there was not one city to strong for us. The Lord our God delivered
all unto us: only unto the land of the childern of Ammon ye came not, nor unto
all the cost of the river labockner unto the cities in the mountains, nor
unto what soever the Lord our God forba de us.

The.iij. Chapter.
THen we turned and went up the way to Basan. And Og the king of Basan came
out agenst us. both he and all his people to battle at Edrey. And the Lord
said unto me: fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people and
his land in to thy hand and thou shall deal with hi^ as thou dealest with
Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon. And so the Lord our God
delivered in to our hands, Og also the king off Basan and al his folk, And
we smote him until naught was left him.

And we took all his cities the same ceason (for there was not a city which
we took not from them) even.iij. score cities, all the region of Argob, the
kingdom of Og in Basan. All these cities were made strong with hye walls,
gates and bars, beside unwalled towns a great maynye. And we utterly
destroyed them, as we played with Sihon king off Hesbon: bringing to naught all the cities with men, women and childern. But all the catell and the spoil of
the cities, we caughte for our selves.

And thus we took the same ceason, the lord out of the hand of two kings of
the Amorites on the other side Iordayne, from the river of Arnon unto mount
Hermon (which Hermon the Sidons call Sirion, but the Amorites call it Senyr)
all the cities in the plain and all Gilead and all Basan unto Salcha and
Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan. For only Og king of Basan
remained of the remnau^t of the geauntes: behold, his yernen bed is yet at
Rabath among the childern off Ammo^.ix. cubettes long and, iiij. cubetes
broad, of the cubettes of a man.

And when we had conquered this land the same time, I gave from Aroer which is
upon the river of Arnon, and half mount Gile ad and the cities thereof unto
the Rubenites, and Gadites. And the rest of Gilead and all Basan the kingdom
of Og, I gave unto the half trybe of Manasse: all the regio^ of Argob with all
Basan was called the land of geauntes. Iair the son of Manasse took all the
region of Argob unto the costs of Gesuri and Ma^chati, and called the towns
of Basan after his own name: the towns of Iair unto this day. And I gave
half Gilead unto Machir. And unto Ruben and Gad, I gave from Gilead unto the
river of Arnon and half the valey and the cost, eue^ unto the river Iabock
which is the border of the childern of Ammon, and the feldes and Iordayne with
the cost, from Cenereth even unto the sea in the field which is the salt see
under the sprynges off Pisga eastwarde.

And I commanded you the same time (ye Ruben and Gad) saying: the Lord your
God has given you this land to enjoy it: se that ye go harnessed before
your brethern the childern of Israel, all that are me^ of war among you.
Your wives only your childern and your catell (for I wot that ye have much

have given rest unto your brethern as well as unto you, and until they also
have conquered the land which the Lord your God has given them beyond
lordayne: and then return again every man unto his possession which I have
given you.

And I warned Joshua the same time saying thine eyes have seen all that the
Lord your God has done unto these two kings, eue^so the Lord will do unto
all kingdoms whither thou go. Fear them not, for the Lord your God he it
is that fights for you.

And I besoughte the Lord the same time saying: O lord Iehoua, thou have
begone to show thy servaunte thy greatness and thy mighty hand for there
is no God in heaven nor in earth that can do after thy works and after thy
power: let me goo over and se the good land that is beyond Iordayne, that
goodly hye contre and Libanon. But the Lord was angry with me for your sakes
and would not hear me, but said unto me, be content, and speak henceforth no
moare unto me of this matter, Get the up in to the top of Pisga and lift up
thine eyes west, north, south and east, and behold it with thine eyes for
thou shall not goo over this Iordayne. Moreover, charge Joshua and courage him
and bold him. For he shall go over before his people, and he shall deuyde the
land which thou shall se unto them. And so we abode in the valaye beside Beth
Peor.

the land which the Lord God of your fathers gives you. Ye shall put
nothing unto the word which I command you nether do ought there from, that
ye may keep the commaundmentes off the Lord your God which I command you.
Your eyes have seen what the Lord did unto Baal Peor: for all the men that
followed Baal Peor, the Lord your God has destroyed from among you: But ye
that claue unto the Lord your God, are alive every one of you this day.
Behold, I have taught you ordinances and laws, soche as the Lord my God
commanded me, that ye should do eue^ so in the land whether ye goo to
possess it

Keep them therefore and do them, for that is your wisdom and understanding
in the syghte of the nacyons: which when they have herd all these
ordinances, shall say: O what a wise and understanding people is this great
nation. For what nacyon is so great that has Gods so nigh unto him: as the
Lord our God is nigh unto us, in all things, when we call unto him? Ye, and
what nacyon is so great that has ordinances and laws so ryghtuousse, as all
this law which I set before you this day.

Take heed to thy self therefore only and keep thy soul diligently, that thou

days of thine life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons sons. The
day that I stood before the Lord your god in Horeb, when he said unto me,
gather me the people together, that I may make them hear my words that they
may learn to f^re me as long as they live upon the earth and that they may
teach their childern: ye came and stood also under the hill and the hill burnt
with fire: even unto the mids of heaven, and there was darcknesse, clouds
and mist. And the Lord spoke unto you out of the fire and ye herd the voice
of the The voice is all to gether: unto that image ought men ^o bow^ there
hertes.
words: But saw no image, save herd a voice only,

And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, even*
x. verses and wrote them in two tables of stone. And the Lord commanded me
the same season to teach you ordynaunces and laws, for to do them in the
land whether ye goo to possess it

Take heed unto your selves diligently as pertayninge unto your souls, for
ye saw no manner of image the day when the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out
of the fire: lest ye mar your selves and make you graven images after
whatsoever likeness it be: whether after the likeness of man or woman or any
mane be that is on the earth or of any manner f^th^^ red foul that fleth in
the air, or of any manner worm that crepeth on the earth or of any manner fysh
that is in the water beneth the earth: Ye and lest thou ly^^e up thine eyes
unto heaven, and when thou seyst the son and the moon and the stars and what
soever is contained in heaven, should be disceaued and should bow thy self
unto them and s^rue the things which the Lord thy God has distributed unto
all nations that are under al quarters of heaven.

For the Lord took you and brought you out of the yernen furnace of Egipte,
to be unto him a people of enheritaunce, as it is come to pass this day.
Forthermoare, the Lord was angrye with me for your sakes and swear, that I
should not goo over Iordane and that I should not goo unto that good land,
which the Lord thy God gives the to enherytaunce. For I must dye in this
land, and shall not goo over Iordane: But ye shall goo over and conquer that
good land

Take heed unto your selves therefore, that ye forgett not the appointment of
the Lord your God which he made with you, and that ye make you no graven
image of what soever it be that the Lord thy God has forbidden the. For the
Lord thy God is a co^suminge fire, and a gelouse God.

If after thou have gotten childern and childerns childern and have dwelt long
in the land, ye shall mar your selves and make graven images after the
liknesse of what so ever it be, and shall work wekednesse in the syghte of the
Lord thy God, to provoke him. I call heaven and earth to record unto you this
day, that ye shall shortly peressh from of the land whether ye goo over
Iordayne to possess it: Ye shall not prolonge your days therein, but shall
shortly be destroyed. And the Lord shall scater you among nations, and ye
shall be left few in number among the people whother the Lord shall bring
you: and there ye shall serve gods which are the works of man's hand, wod
and stone which nether se nor hear nor eat nor smell.

Never the later ye shall seek the Lord your God even there, and shall find
him if thou seek him with all thine heart and with all thy soul. In thy
tribulacion and when all these things are come upon the, even in the later
days, thou shall turn unto the Lord thy God, and shall harken un to his
voice. For the Lord thy God is a pitiefull God: he will not forsake the nether
destroy the, nor forgett the appoyntme^t made with thy fathers which he swear
unto them.

For axe I pray the of the days that are past which were before the, sense
the day that God created man upon the earth and from the one side of heaven
unto the other whether any thing has been like unto this great thing or
whether any soche thing has been herd as it is, that a nation has herd the
voice of God speakinge out of fire as thou have herd, and yet lived? either
whether God assayed to goo and take him a people from among nations, through
temptacions and signs and wonders and through war and with a mighty hand
and a stretched out arm and with mighty terreble sightes, acordynge unto all
that the Lord your God did unto you in Egipte before your eyes.

Unto the it was showed, that thou myghtest know, how that the Lord he is God
and that there is none but he.

Out of heaven he made the hear his voice to nurter the* and upon earth he
showed the his great fire, and thou hardest his words out of the fire. And
because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them and
brought the out with his presence and with his mighty power of Egipte: to
thrust out nations greater and myghtyer then thou before the, to bring the in
and to give the their land to enheritaunce: as it is come to pass this day.

Understand therefore this day and turn it to thine heart, that the Lord he
is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneth there is no moo: keep therefore
his ordynaunces, and his commaundmentes which I commaun de the this day, that
it may goo well with the and with thy childern after the and that thou may
prolonge thy days upon the earth which the Lord thy God gives the for ever.

Then Moses severed.iij. cities on the other side Iordane toward the son
rysynge, that he should fle thiter which had killed his neygh boure unawares and
hated him not in time past and therefore should fle unto one of the same cities
and live: Bezer in the wilderness even in the plain contre among the
Rubenites: and Ramoth in Gilead among the Gaddites and Solan in Basan among
the Manassites.

This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel, and these are
the witness, ordinances and statutes which Moses told the childern of Israel
after they came out of Egipte, on the other side Iordayne in the valey beside
Beth Peor in the land of Siho^ king of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon,
whom Moses and the childern of Israel smote after they were come out of Egipte,
and conquered his land and the land of Og king of Basan.ij. kings of the
Amorites on the other side Iordayne toward the son rysynge: from Aroar upon
the bancke of the river Arnon, unto mount Sion which is called Hermon and all
the feldes on the other sydel or dayne eastwarde: even unto the sea in the
field under the springes of Pisga.

The. ^. Chapter.
ANd Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them: Hear Israel the
ordynaunces and laws which I speak in thine ears this day, and learn them
and take heed that ye do them. The Loode our God made an appointment with us
in Horeb. The Lord made not this bond with our fathers, but with us: we are
they, which are al hear a live this day. The Lord talked with you face to
face in the mount out of the fire. And I stood between the Lord and you the
same time, to show you the saying of the Lord. For ye were afraid of the
fire and therefore went not up in to the mount and he said.

I am the Lord thy God which brought the out of the lord of Egipte the housse
of bondage. Thou shall have therefore none other gods in my presence.

Thou shall make the no graven Image off any manner likeness that is in heaven
above, Image
or in the earth beneth, or in the water beneth the earth. Thou shall nether bow
thy self unto them nor serve them, for I the Lord thy God. am a gelouse God,
visettinge the wikednesse of the fathers upon the childern, even in the third
and the fourth generation, among them that hate me: and show mercy upon
thousands among them that love me and keep my commaundmentes.

Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will
not hold him giltlesse, that takes his name in vain.

Keep the Sabbath day that thou sanctifi^ it, as the Lord thy God has
commanded the. Six days thou shall labor and do all that thou have to
do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shall do
no manner work, nether thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy servant
nor thy maid nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy catell nor the
stranger that is within thy city, that thy servant and thy maid may rest

the out thence with a mighty hand and a stretched out arm. For which cause
the Lord thy God commands the to keep the Sabbath day.

Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God has commanded the:
that thou may prolonge thy days, and that it may go well with the on the
land, which the Lord thy God gives the.

Thou shall not slay.

Thou shall not break wedlock.

Thou shall not steal.

Thou shall not bear false witness agenst thy neighbor,

Thou shall not lust after thy neghbours wife: thou shat not covet thy
neighbors housse, field, servant, maid, ox, ass nor ought that is thy
neghbours.

These words the Lord spoke unto al your multitude in the mount out of the
fire, cloud and darcknesse, with a loud voice and added nomoare there to, and
wrote them in.ij. tables of stone and delivered them unto me.

But as soon as ye herd the voice out off the darcknesse and saw the hill
burn with fire, ye came unto me all the heedes of your tribes and your
elders: and ye said: behold, the Lord our God has showed us his glory and
his greatness, and we have herd his voice out of the fire, and we have seen
this day that God may talk with a man and he yet live. And now wherefore
should we dye that this great fire should consume us: If we should hear the
voice of the Lord our God any moare, we should dye. For what is any flesh
that he should hear the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire as
we have done and should yet live: Goo thou and hear all that the Lord our
God says, and tell thou unto us all that the Lord our God says unto the,
and we will hear it and do it.

And the Lord herd the voice of your words when ye spoke unto me, and he
said unto me: I have herd the voice of the words of this people which they
have spoken unto the they have well said all that they have said. Oh that
they had soche an heart with them to fear me and keep all my commaundmentes
always, that it might goo well with them and with their childern for ever. Goo
and say unto them: get you in to your tents again, but stand thou here
before me and I will tell the all the commaundmentes, ordinances and laws
which thou shall teach the^, that they may do them in the land which I give
them to possess.

Take heed therefore that ye do as the Lord walk straight.
your God has commanded you, and turn not aside: either to the right hand
or to the left: but walk in all the ways which the Lord your God has
commanded you, that ye may lyve and that it may goo well with you and that
ye may prolonge your days in the land which ye shall possess.

The.vj. Chapter.
THese are the commaundmentes, ordinances and laws which the Lord your God
commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whother ye goo to
possess it: that thou might fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his
ordinances and his commaundmentes which I command the, both thou and thy
son and thy sons son all days off thy life, that thy days may be
prolonged. Hear therefore Israel and take heed that thou do thereafter, that
it may goo well with the and that ye may increase myghtely: eue^ as the Lord
God of thy fathers has promised the, a lord that flows with mylk and honey

Hear Israel, the Lord thy God is Lord only and thou shall love the Lord
thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul and with It is heresy with us

all thy might. And these words which I command the this day, shall be in
thine heart and thou shall whett them on thy childern, and shall talk of them
when thou art at home in thine housse and as thou walk by the way, and when
thou lie down and when thou rysest up: and thou shall bind them for a
sign upon thine hand. And they shall be papers off remembrance between thine
eyes, and shall write them upon the posts of thy housse and upon thy gates.

And when the Lord thy God has borught the in to the land which he swear unto
thy fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give the with great and goodly cities
which thou byldest not, and housses f^^l of all manner goods which thou
filledest not, and wells dygged which thou dyggedest not, and vynes and olyue
trees which thou plantedest not, and when thou have eaten, and art full: Then
beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought the out off the land of
Egipte the housse of bondage. But fear the Lord thy God and serve him, and
swear by his name, and se that ye walk not after strange gods of the Gods
off the nacyons which are about you. For the Lord thy God is a gelouse God
among you lest the wrath of the Lord thy God wax hot upon the and destroy
the from the earth.

Ye shall not tempte the Lord your God as ye did at Masa. But se that ye keep
the commaundmentes of the Lord your God, his Right in god d^s sight is that
he commands
witnesses and his ordinances which he has commanded the, and se thou do
that which is right and good in the syghte of the Lord: that thou may
prospere and that thou may goo and co^quere that good land which the
Lordesware unto thy fathers, and that the Lord may cast out all thine enemies

saying: What means the witnesses, ordinances and laws which the Lord
our God has commanded you? Then thou shall say unto thy son: We were
bondmen unto Pharao in Egipte, but the Lord brought us out of Egipte with a
mighty hand. And the Lord showed signs and wondres both great and evell
upon Egipte, Pharao and upon all his household, before our eyes and brought
us from thence: to bring us in and to give us the land which he swear unto
our fathers. And therefore commanded us to do all these ordinances and for to
fear the Lord our God, for our wealth always and that he might save us, as
it is come to pass this day. Moreover it The outward dead is righteousness

shall be righteousness unto us before the Lord our God, if we take heed to keep
all these co^maundme^tes as he has commanded us,

The.vij. Chapter.
When the Lord thy God has brought the in to the land whither thou go to
possess it, and has cast out many nations before the: the Hethites, the
Girgosites, the Amorites, the Cananites, the Pher^sites, the Heuites and the
Iebusites: vij. nations moo in number and mightier than thou: and when the
Lord thy God has set them before the that thou should smite them se that
thou utterly destroy them and make no covenant with them nor have compassion
on them. Also thou shall make no marriages with them, nether give thy daughter
unto his son nor take his daughter unto thy son. For they will make your
sons depart from and serve strange Gods, and then will the wrath off the
Lord wax whote upon you and destroy you shortly.

But thus ye shall deal with them: overthrow their alters, break down their
pilers, cut down their groves and burn their images with fire. For thou art
an holy nation unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen the to be a
several people unto himsilf of all nations that are upon the earth. It was not
Gods aw^^ goodness and ^is own truth causes h^ to work.
because of the multitude of you above all nations, that the Lord had lust
unto you and chose you. For ye were fewest of all nations: But because the
Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto
your fathers, therefore he brought you out of Egipte with a mighty hand and
delivered you out of the housse of bondage: eue^ from the hand of Pharao king
of Egipte.

Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God he is God and that a true God,
which keeps poyntment and mercy unto them that love him and keep his
commaundmentes, even through out a thousand generacions and rewards Before
his ^ace ^n his presence, while he looks on.
them that hate him before his face so that he brings them to naught, and
will not def^erre the time unto him that hates hi^ but will reward him before
his face. Keep therefore the commaundmentes, ordinances and laws which I
command you this day, that ye do them.

If ye shall harken unto these laws and shall observe and do them, then shall
the Lord thy God keep poyntment with the and the mercy which he swore unto thy
fathers and will love the, bless the and multiplye the: he will bless the
fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy field, thy corn, thy wine and thy
oil, the fruit of thine oxen and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which
he swore unto thy fathers to geuethe. Thou shall be blessed above all nations,
there shall be nether man nor woman unfruitful among you, nor any thing
unfruitful among your catell. Moreover the Lord will turn from the all
manner infirmityes, and will put none off the evil dyseases off Egipte (which
thou know) upon the, but will send them upon them that hate the.

Thou shall bring to naught all nations which the Lord thy God delyuereth the
thine eye shall have no pity upon them nether shall thou serve their gods,
for that shall be thy decay. If thou shall say in thine heart these nations are
moo than I, how ca^ I cast them God is as able ^o^^ also to deliver us out of
the captiui te of the pop^
out? Fear the^ not, but remember what the Lord thy god did unto Pharao and
unto all Egipte, and the great temptacions which thine eyes saw, and the
signs and wonders and mighty hand and stretched out arm wherewith the Lord
thy god brought the out: eue^ so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the
nations of which thou art afraid.

Thereto, the Lord thy God will send hornettes among them until they that
are left, and hyde them selves from the, be destroyed. Se thou fear the^ not
for the lord thy god is among you a mighty god and a terrible. The Lord thy
god will put out these nations before the a little and a little: thou may not
consume the^ at o^ce lest the beestes of the field increase upon the. And the
lord thy god shall deliver the^ unto the and sterre up a mighty tempest
among the^, until they be brought to naught. And he shall deliver their kings
in to thine hand, and thou shall destroy their names from under heaven. There
shall no man stand before the, until thou have destroyed them. The images of
their gods thou shall burn with fire, and se that thou covet not the silver
or gold that is on them nor take it unto the, lest thou be snared therewith.
For it is an abhominacyon unto the Lord thy God. Bring not therefore the
abhominacyon to thine housse, lest thou be a damned thing as it is: but
utterly defye it and abhor it, for it is a thing that must be destroyed.

The.viij. Chaptre.
All the commaundmentes which I command the this day ye shall keep for to do
them, that ye may live and multiplye and goo and possess the land which the
Lord swear unto your fathers. And think on all the way which the Lord thy
God led the this.xl. year in the wilderness, for to humble the and to prove
the, to wete what was in thine heart, whether thou would keep his
commaundmentes or no, He humbled the and made the hongre and fed the with man
which nether thou nor thy father kn^we of* to make the know that a man must not
live by bred only: but by The word is life
all that proceeds out of them outh of the Lord must a man live. Thy raiment
waxed not old upon the, nether did thy fete swell this xl. year.

Understand therefore in thine heart, that as a man ^^^^ereth his son, even
so the Lord thy God (...)reth the. Keep therefore the commaundmentes of the
Lord thy God that thou walk in his ways and that thou fear him For the
Lord thy God brings the in to a good land, a land of rivers of water, of
fou^tens and of springes that spring out both in valayes and hills: a land
of whete and of barley, of vynes, figtrees and pomgranates, a land of olyuetrees
with oil and of honye: a land wherein thou shall not eat bred in scarceness,
and where thou shall lack nothing, a land whose stones are yerne, and out of
whose hills thou shall dygge brass. When thou have eaten therefore and filled
thy self, then bless the Lord for the good land which he has given the.

But bewarre that thou forgett not the Lord thy God, that thou would not
keep his co^maundmentes, laws and ordinances which I command the this day:
ye and when thou have ea^e^ and filled thy self and have bylt goodly housses
and dwelt therein, and when thy beesse and thy sheep are waxed many and thy
silver and gold is multiplied and all that thou have increased, then bewarre
lest thine heart rise and thou forgett the Lord thy God which brought the out
of the land of Egipte the housse of bondage, and which led the in the
wilderness both great and terreble with firye serpents and scorpions and
thirst where was no water which brought the water out of the rock of flynt:
which fed the in the wilderness with Man where of thy fathers knew not, for
to humble the and to prove the, that he might do the good at thy later end.

And beware that thou say not in thine heart, my power and the might of mine
own hand has done me all these acts: But remember Gods power works and
not we.
the Lord thy God, how that it is he which gave the power to do ma^fully, for
to make good the promise which he swear unto thy fathers, as it is come to
pass this day,

For if thou shall forget the Lord thy god and shall walk after strange
gods and serve them and worsheppe them, I testyfye unto you this day, that
ye shall surely perysh. As the nacyons which the Lord destroys before the,
even so ye shall peryshe, because ye would not harken unto the voice of the
Lord your God.

The.ix. Chapter.
Hear Israel, thou go over Ioadayne this day, to goo and conquer nations
greater and mightier than thy self, and cities great and walled up to heaven,
and people great and tall, even the childern of the Enak^ms, which thou
know and of whom thou have herd say who is able to stond before the
childern of Enack? But understand this day that the Lord thy God which goes
over before the a consumyng fire, he shall destroy them and he shall subdue
them before the. And thou shall cast them out, and bring them to naught
quyckely as the Lord has said unto the.

Speak not in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God has cast them out
before the saying: where is ^^^ righ^^^esnesse.
for my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to the possess this lord.
Nay, but for the wekednesse of these nations the Lord does cast the^ out before
the. It is not for thy righteousness sake and right heart that thou go to
possess their lo^d: But partly for the wekednesse of these nations, the Lord
thy god does cast the^ out before the, and partly to perform that which the
Lord thy God swear unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

Understand therefore that it is not for thy righteousness sake, that the Lord
thy God does give the this good l^nd to possess it, for thou art a
stissenecked people. Remember and forget not how thou prouokedest the Lord thy
god in the wilderness: for sens the day that thou came out of the land of
Egipte until ye came unto this place, ye have rebelled agenst the Lord. Also
in Horeb ye angered the Lord so that the Lord was wroth with you, eue^ to have
destroyed you, after that I was gone up in to the mount, to fett the tables of
stone, the tables of appointment which the Lord made with you. And I abode in
the hill.xl. days and xl. nights and nether ate bred nor drank water. And
the Lord delivered me two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and
in them was acordynge to all the words which the Lord said unto you in the
mount out of the fire in the day when the people were gathered together.

And when the.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes were ended, the Lord gave me: the two
tables off stone, the tables of the testament, and said unto me: Up, and get
the down quyckely from hence, for thy people which thou have brought out of
Egipte, have marred themselves.

They are turned attonce out of the way, which I commanded them, and have
made the^ a god of metal. Furthermore the Lord spoke unto me saying: I se
this people how that it is a stiffenecked people, let me alone that I may
destroy them and put out the name off them from under heaven, and I will make
off the a nation both greater and moo than they.

And I turned away and came down from the hill (and the hill burnt with fire)
and had the two tables of the appointment in my hands. And when I looked and
saw that ye had sinned agenst the Lord your God and had made you a calfe of
metal and had turned attonce out of the way which the Lord had commanded
you. The^ I took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands, and brake
the^ before your eyes. And I fell before the Lord: even as at the first
time.xl. days and. xl nights and nether ate bred nor drank water over all
your sins which ye had sinned in doing wekedly in the sight of the Lord
and in prouokinge him. For I was afraid of the wrath and fearsnesse wherewith
the Lord was angry with you, eue^ for to have destroyed you But the Lord
herd my peticion at that time also.

The Lord was very angry with Aaron also, eue^ for to have destroyed him: But
I made intercession for Aaron also the same time. And I took your sin, the
calfe which ye had made and burnt him with fire and stamp him and ground him
a good, eue^ unto small dust. And I cast the dust thereof in to the broke that
descended out of the mount.

Also at ^habeera and at Masa and at the sepulchers of lust ye angered the
Lord, ye and when the Lord sent you from Cades Bernea saying: goo up and
conquer the land which I have given you, ye disobeyed the mouth of the Lord
your God, and nether believed hi^ nor herkened unto his voice. Thus ye have
been disobedient unto the Lord, sense the day that I knew you.

And I fell before the Lord.xl. days and Learn to pra^^.
xl. nights which I lay there, for the Lord was minded to have destroyed
you. But I made intercession unto the Lord and said: O Lord Iehoua, destroy
not thy people and thine enheritau^ce which thou have delivered through thy
greatness and which thou have brought out of Egipte with a mighty hand.
Remember thy servauntes Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and look not unto the
stoburnesse of this people nor unto their wekednesse and sin: lest the land
whence thou broughtest them say: Because the Lord was not able to bring them
in to the land which he promised them and because he hated them, therefore he
carried them out to destroy them in the wilderness. Moreover they are thy
people and thine enheritaunce, which thou broughtest out with thy mighty
power and with thy stretched out arm.

The.x. Chapte.
IN the same ceason the Lord said unto me hew the two tables of stone like
unto the first and come up unto me in to the mount and make the an Arc of wod,
and I will write in the table, the words that were in the first tables which
thou brakest, and thou shall put the^ in the arcke. And I made an arc of
sethi^ wod and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up in to
the mountain and the.ij. tables in mine hand.

And he wrote in the tables, acording to the first writing (the.x. verses
which the Lord spoke unto you in the mount out of the fire in the day when
the people were gathered) and gave the^ unto me. And I departed and came down
from the hill and put the tables in the arcke which I had made: and there they
remained, as the Lord commanded me

And the childern of Israel took their iurney from Beroth Be^ Iake^ to Mosera,
where Aaron dyed and where he was buried, and Eleazer his son became preast
i^ his stead. And from thence they departed unto Gudgod: and from Gudgod to
Iathbath, a lo^d of rivers of water. And the same ceason the Lord separated
the trybe of Leui to bear the arcke of the appointment of the Lord and to
stand before the Lord, and to ministre unto him and to bless in his name
unto this day. Wherefore the Levites have no part nor enheritaunce with their
brethern. The Lord he is their enheritaunce, as the Lord thy God has
promised them.

And I tarried in the mount, eue^ as at the first time.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes
and the Lord herkened unto me at that time also, so that the Lord would not
destroy the. And the Lord said unto me: up and goo forth in the iurney
before the people and let them goo in and conquer the land which I swear unto
their fathers to give unto them.

And now Israel what is it that the Lord thy God requires of the, but to fear
the Lord thy God and to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the
Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul, that thou keep the
commaundmentes of the Lord and his ordinances which I command the this
day, for thy wealth. Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lords
thy god, and the earth with all that therein is: only the Lord had a lust unto
thy fathers to love them, and therefore chose you their seed after them off all
nacyons, as it is come to pass this day.

Circumcyse therefore the foreskynne of your hearts, and be no longer
sciffnecked. For the Lord your God, he is God of gods and lord of lords,
a great God, a mighty and a terreble which regards no man's person nor
takes gifts: but does right unto the fatherless and wedowe and loves the
stranger, to give him fode and raiment. Love therefore the stranger, for ye
were strangers your selves in the land of Egipte.

Thou shall fear the Lord thy God and serve him and cleave unto him and swear
by his name, for he is thy praise and he is thy God that has done these great
and terreble things for the, which thine eyes have seen. Thy fathers went
down in to Egipte with.lxx. souls, and now the Lord thy God has made the as
the stars of heaven in multitude.

The.xi. Chapter.
Love the Lord thy God and keep his obseruaunces, his ordinances, his laws
and his commaundmentes always. And call to mind this day that which your
childern have nether known nor seen: even the nurture of the Lord your God,
his greatness, his mighty hand and his stretched out arm: his miracles and
his acts which he did among the Egiptia^s, even unto Pharao the king off
Egipte and unto all his lord: and what he did unto the host of the Egiptia^s,
unto their horses and charettes, how he brought the water of the red see upon
the^ as they chased you, and how the Lord has brought them to naught unto
this day: and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto
this place: and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the
son of Ruben, how the earth opened her mouth and swalowed the^ with their
housholdes and their tents, and all their substance that was in their
possession, in the mids of Israel.

For your eyes have seen all the great deades of the Lord which he did. Keep
therefore all the co^maundmentes which I command the this day that ye may be
strong and goo and conquer the land whother ye go to possess it, and that
ye may prolonge your days in the land which the Lord swear unto your
fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that flows with milk
and honye.

For the land whother thou go to possess it, is not as the land of Egipte
whence thou came out, where thou sowedest thy seed and wateredest it with thy
labor as a garden of herbs: but the land whither ye goo over to possess
it, is a land of hills and valeyes and drynketh water of the rain of heaven,
and a land which the Lord thy God cares for. The eyes of the Lord thy God
are always apo^ it, from the beginning of the year unto the later end of the
year.

If thou shall harken therefore unto my commandments which I command you
this day, that ye love the Lord your God and serve him with all your hertes
and with all your souls: then he will give rain unto your land in due
season, both the first rain and the later, and thou shall gather in thy corn,
thy wine and thine oil. And he will send grass in thy feldes for thy catell:
and thou shall care and fill thy self.

But bewarre that your hertes disceaue you not that ye turn aside and serve
strange gods and worshepe them, and the^ the wrath of the Lord wax hot
upon you and shot up the heaven that there be no rain and that your land
yield not her fruit, and that ye peresh quickly from of the good lord which the
Lord gives you.

Putt up therefore these my words in your hertes and in your souls, and
bind them for a sign unto your hands, and let them be as papers of
remembrance between your eyes, and teach them your childern: so that thou *
talk of them when thou syttest in Talk of ^o^^nhod say our prelates
thine housse, and when thou walk by the way, and when thou lie down and
when thou rysest up: ye and write them upon the dorepostes of thine housse
and upon thy gates, that your days may be multiplied and the days of your
childern upon the earth which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them,
as long as the days of heaven last upon the earth.

For if ye shall keep all these comaundmentes which I command you, so that ye
do the^ and love the Lord your God and walk in all his ways and oleaue
unto him. Then will the Lord cast out all these nations both greatter and
myghtyer then your selves. All the places where on the soles of your fete
shall tread, shall be youres: even from the wilderness and from Libanon and
from the river Euphrates, even unto the vttemost see shall your costs be.
There shall no man be able to stand before you: the Lord your God shall cast
the fear and dread of you upon all lands whether ye shall come, as he has
said unto you.

Behold, I sect before you this day, a blessing and a curse: a blessing: if
that ye herke^ unto the commaundmentes of the Lord your God which I command
you this day: And a curse: if ye will not herke^ unto the co^maundmentes of
the Lord your God: but turn out of the way which I commau^de you this day
to goo after strange gods which ye have not known.

When the Lord thy God has brought the in to the land whother thou go to
possess it, then put the blessinge upon mount Grisim and the curse upon
mount Ebal, which are on the other side Iordane on the back side of the way
toward the going down of the son in the lord of the Cananites which dwell
in the feldes over agenst Gilgal beside moregroue. For ye shall goo over to goo
and possess the land which the Lord your God gives you, and shall conquer
it and dwell there in. Take heed therefore that ye do all the co^maundmentes and
laws, which I set before you this day.

The.xij. Chapter.
THese are the ordinances and laws which ye shall observe to do in the land
which the Lord God of thy fathers gives the to possess it, as long as ye
live upon the earth. Se that ye destroy all places where the nacyons which ye
conquer serve their gods, upon hye mountains and on hye hills and under
every grene tree. Overthrow their alters and break their pylers and burn
their groves with fire and hewdowne the images off their gods, and bring the
names of them to naught out of that place.

Se ye do not so unto the Lord your God but ye shall enquere the place which
the Lord your God shall have chosen out of all your trybes to put his name
there and there to dwell. And thither thou shall come, and thither ye shall
bring your burntsacryfices and your offerynges, your tithes and
heueofferynges off your hands, your vows and frewillofferynges and thy
first borne off your oxen and off your sheep. And there ye shall eat before
the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye lay your hands on:
both ye and your housholdes, because the Lord thy God has blessed the.

Ye shall do after nothing that we do here this day, every man what seems
hi^ good *
in his own eyes. For ye are not yet come to rest nor unto the enheritaunce
which the Lord your God gives you. But ye shall goo over Iordayne and dwell
in the lord which the Lord your God gives you to enheret, and he shall give
you rest from al your enemies round about: and ye shall dwell in safety.

Therefore when the Lord your God has chosen a place to make his name dwell
there, thither ye shall bring all that I command you, your burntsacryfices
and your offerynges, your tithes and the heueofferynges of your hands and
all your godly vows which ye vow unto the Lord. And ye shall rejoice before
the Lord your God, both ye, your sons and your daughters, your
servants and your maids and the leuite that is within your gates for he
has nether part nor enheritaunce with you.

Take heed that thou offer not thy burntofferynges in what soever place thou
seyst: but in the place which the Lord shall have chosen among one of thy
trybes, there thou shall offer thy burntofferynges and there thou shall do all
that I command the. Notwitstondynge thou may kill and eat flesh in all thy
cities, what soever thy soul lusts after acordinge to the blessinge of the
Lord thy God which he has given the both the * unclean and the clean may
thou eat, Unclean as pertayninge un to sacrifice as beestes that had
deformities: but not of the unclean that was forbidden
even as the roo and the heart: only eat not the blood, but pour it upon the
earth as water.

Thou may not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine and
of thy oil, either the firstborne of of thine oxen or of thy sheep, nether any
of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy frewilofferinges or heueofferynges of
thine hands: but thou must eat them before the Lord thy God, in the place
which the Lord thy God has chosen: both thou thy son and thy daughter, thy
servant and thy maid and the leuite that is within thy gates: and thou shall
rejoice before the Lord thy God, in all that thou put thine hand to. And
bewarre that thou forsake not the leuite as long as thou lyuest upon the earth.

If (when the Lord thy God has enlarged thy costs as he has promised the)
thou say: I will eat flesh, because thy soul longs to eat flesh: then
thou shall eat flesh, what so ever thy soul lusts. If the place which the
Lord thy God has chosen to put his name there be to far from the, then thou
may kylle of thy oxen and of thy sheep which the Lord has given the as I
have commanded the and thou may eat in thine own city what soever thy
soul lusts. Never the later, as the roo and the heart is eaten, even so thou
shall eat it: the unclean and the clean indifferently thou shall eat. But
be strong that thou eat not the blood. For the blood, that is the life: and
thou may not eat the life with the flesh: thou may not eat it: but must
power it upon the earth as water. Se thou eat it not therefore that it may goo
well with the and with thy childern after the, when thou shall have done that
which is right in the syghte off the Lord.

But thy holy things which thou have and thy vows, thou shall take and go
unto the place which the Lord has chosen, and thou shall offer thy
burntoffrynges, both flesh and blood upon the alter of the Lord thy God, and
the blood of thine offrynges thou shall pour out upon the alter of the Lord
thy God, and shall eat the flesh. Take heed and hear all these words which I
command the that it may goo well with the and with thy children after the
for ever, when thou do that which is good and right in the sight of the
Lord thy God.

When the Lord thy God has destroyed the nations before the, whother thou
go to conquer them, and when thou have conquered them, and dwelt in their
lands: Bewarre that thou be not taken, in a snare after the^, after that they
be destroyed before the, and that thou axenot after their gods saying: how
did these nacyons serve their gods, that I may do so likewise? Nay, thou
shall not do so unto the Lord thy God: for all abhominacyons which the Lord
hated did they unto their gods. For they burnt both their sons and their
daughters with fire unto their gods. But what soever I command you that
take heed ye do: and put naught thereto, nor take ought Put naught to ne^ take
ought away.

The.xiij. Chapter.
IF there a rise among you a prophett or a dreamer of dreams and give the a
sign or a wondre, and that sign or wonder which he has said come to pass,
and then say: let us goo after strange Gods which thou have not known, and
let us serve them: her ken not unto the words of that prophet or dreamer of
dreams. For the Lord thy God te^pteth you, to wete whether ye love the Lord

after the Lord your God and fear him and keep his co^mau^dmentes and harken
unto his voice and serve him and cleave unto him. And that prophet or dreamer
of dreams shall dye for it, because he has spoken to turn you away from the
Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egipte and delivered you
out of the housse of bondage, to thrust the out of the way which the Lord
thy God commanded the to walk in: and so thou shall put evil away from the.

If thy brother the son of thy mother or thine own son or thy daughter or
the wife that lies in thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul
unto the* entyce the secretly saying: let us goo and serve strange gods
which thou have not known nor yet thy fathers, of the gods of the people
which are round about the, whether they benye unto the or far of from the,
from the one end of the land unto the other: Se thou consent not unto him
nor harken unto him: no let not thyn^ eye pitye him nor have compassyon on him,
nor keep him secrett, but cause him to be slain: Thine hand shall be first upon
him to kill him: and then the hands off all the people. And thou shall stone
him with stones that he dye, because he has gone about to thrust the away
from the Lord thy God which brought the out of Egipte the housse of bondage.
And all Israel shall hear and fear and shall do no moare any soche
wekednesse as this is, among them.

If thou shall hear say of one of thy cities which the Lord thy God has
given the to dwell in, that certain being the childern of Beliall are gone out
from among you and have moved the enhabiters of their city saying: let us goo
and serve strange Gods which ye have not known. Then seek and make search
and enquere diligently. If it be true and the thing of a suertie that soch
abhominacion is wrought among you: then thou shall smite the dwellers of that
city with the edge of the sword, and destroy it mercylesse and all that is
the rin, and even the very catell thereof with the edge of the sword. And
gather all the spoil of it in to the mids of the streates thereof, and burn
with fire: both the city and all the spoil thereof every whitte unto the Lord
thy God. And it shall be an hepe for ever and shall not be bylt again. And se
that their cleave naught of the damned thing in thine hand, that the Lord
may turn from his fearse wrath and show the mercy and have compassion on
the and multiplye the, as he has sworn unto thy fathers: when thou have
herkened unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep all his co^maundmentes
which I command the this day so that thou do that which is right in the
eyes of the Lord thy God.

The.vj. Chapter.
YE are the childern of the Lord your God, cut not your selves nor make you
any baldnes between the eyes for any ma^s deeth. For thou art an holy people
unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord has chosen the to be a several people
unto him self, of all the nacyons that are upon the earth.

Ye shall eat no manner of abhominacyon. These are the beestes which ye shall
eat of: oxen, sheep and gootes, heart, too and bugle, hert^ goote, unicorn,
origin and Camelion. And all beestes that cleave the host and slytte it in to
two claws and chewe the cud, them ye shall eat. Nevertheless, these ye shall
not eat of them that chew cud and of the^ that deuyde and cleave the hoffe:
the camel, the hare and the conye. For they chew cud, but deuyde not the
hoffe: and therefore are unclean unto you: and also the swyne. for though he
deuyde the hoffe, yet he cheweth not cud, and therefore is unclean un to you: Ye
shall not eat of the flesh of the^ nor twich the deed carcasses of them.

These ye shall eat off all that are in the waters: All that have fynnes and
scales. And what soever has not finnes and scales, of that ye may not eat,
for that is unclean un to you.

Of all clean birds ye shall eat, but these are they of which ye may not
eat: the egle, the goshauke, the cormerant, the ixion, the vultur, the kyte
and her kind, and all kind off ravens, the Estrich, the nyght^ro^^ the
kuckoo, the sparowhauke and all her kind, the little oule, the great oule, the
back, the bytture, the pie the storke, the heron, the Iaye in his kind, the
lapwynge, the swalowe: And all crepynge fowls are unclean unto you and may
not be eaten of: but of all clean fowls ye may well eat.

Ye shall eat of nothing that dies alone: But thou may give it unto the
stranger that is in thy city that he eat it, or may sell it unto an
Alie^t. For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God. Thou shall not seth
a kyd in his mothers milk.

Thou shall tyeth all the increase of thy seed that comes out of the field
year by year. And thou shall eat before the Lord thy God in the place which
he has chosen to make his name dwell there the tyth off thy corn, of thy wine
and of thine oil, and the firstborne of thine oxen and of thy flock that thou
may learn to fear the Lord thy God allwaye.

If the way be to long for the, so that thou art not able to carry it,
because the place is to far from the which the Lord thy God has chosen to
set his name there (for the Lord thy God has blessed the) then make it in
money and take the money in thine hand, and goo unto the place which the Lord
thy God has chosen, and bestow that money on what soever thy soul lusts
after: on oxen sheep, wine and good drink, and on what soever thy soul
desires, and eat there before the Lord thy God and be merry: both thou and
thine household and the Leuite that is in thy city. Se thou forsake not the
Leuite, for he has nether partenor enheritaunce with the.

At the end of three year, thou shall bring forth all the tithes of thine
increase the same year and lay it up whitin thine own city, and the Leuite
shall come because he has nether part nor enheritaunce with the, and the
stranger and the fatherless and the wedowe which are whithin thy city and
shall eat and fill them selves: that the Lord thy God may bless the in all
the works of thine hond which thou do.

The.xv. Chapter.
AT the end of seven year thou shall make a fre year. And this is the manner
off the fre year, whosoever lends ought with his hand unto his neighbor,
may not axe again that which he has lent, of his neighbor or of his
brother: because it is called the lords fre year, yet of a stranger thou
may call it home again. But that which thou have with thy brother thine
hand shall remytt, and that in any wise, that there be no beggar among you.
For the Lord shall bless the land which the Lord thy God gives the, an
heritaunce to possess it: so that thou harken unto the voice of the Lord thy
God* to observe and do all these commaundmentes which I command you this
day: ye and then the Lord thy God shall bless the as he ^ath promised the,
and thou shall lend unto many nacyons, and shall borowe of no man, and shall
raygne over many nacyons, but none shall reygne over the.

When one of thy brethern among you is waxed poor in any of thy cities within
thy lord which the Lord thy God gives the, se that thou harden not thine
heart nor shetto thine hand from thy poor brother: But open thine hand unto
him and lend him sufficient for his need which he has. And beware that there
be not a point of Belial in thine heart, that thou would say. The seventh
year, the year of fredome is at hand, and therefore it grieve the to look on thy
poor brother and geuest him naught and he then cry unto the Lord agenst the
and it be sin unto the: But give him. and let it not grieve thine heart to
give. Because that for that thing, the Lord thy God shall bless the in all
thy works and in all that thou put thine hand to. For the land shall
never be without poor. Wherefore I command the saying: open thine hand unto
thy brother that is neady and poor in thy land.

If thy brother an Hebrew sell him self to the or an Hebruas, he shall serve
the six year and the seventh year thou shall let him go fre from the. And
when thou sendest him out fre from the, thou shall not let him goo away
emptye: but shall give him of thy sheep and of thy corn and of thy wine, and
give him off that where with the Lord thy God has blessed the. And remember
that thou wast a servant in the land of Egipte, and the Lord thy God
delivered the thence: wherefore I command the this thing to day.

But and if he say unto the, I will not goo away from the, because he loves
the and thine housse and is well at ease with the. Then take a naule and nail
his ear too the door there with and let him be thy servant forever and unto
thy maid servant thou shall do likewise. And let it not grieve thine eyes to
let him goo out from the, for he has been worth a double hired servant to
the in his service.vi. years. And the Lord thy God shall bless the in all
that thou do.

All the firstborne that come of thine oxen and of thy sheep that are males,
thou shall halowe unto the Lord thy God. Thou shall do no service with the
firstborne of thy sheep: but shall eat the^ before the Lord thy God year by
year in the place which the Lord has chosen both thou and thine houssholde.

If there be any deformyte there in, whether it be lame or blind or what
soever evil fauerednesse it has, thou shall not offer it unto the Lord thy
God: But shall eat it in thine own city, the unclean and the clean
indifferently, as the roo and the heart. Only eat not the blood there of, but
pour it upon the ground as water.

The.xvi. Chapter.
Observe the month of Abyb, and offer passover unto the Lord thy God. For in
the month of Abib, the Lord thy God brought the out of Egipte by night. Thou
shall therefore offer passover unto the Lord thy God, and sheep and oxen in
the place which the Lord shall chose to make his name dwell there. Thou shall
cate no leue^ded bred there with: but shall eat there with the bred of
tribulacio^.vij. days long. For thou came out of the lord of Egipte in
have, that thou may remember the day when thou came out of the land of
Egipte, all days of thy life. And se that there be no leuended bred seen in
all thy costs.vij. days long, and that there remain nothing of the flesh
which thou have offered the first day at even, until the morning.

Thou may not offer passover in any of thy cities which the Lord thy god
gives the: But in the place which the Lord thy God shall chose to make his
name dwell in, there thou shall offer Passover at even about the goyngdoune
of the son, even in the season that thou came out of Egipte. And thou shall
seth and eat in the place which the Lord thy God has chosen, and depart on
the morrow and get the unto thy tente. Six days thou shall eat sweet bred,
and the seventh day is for the people to come together to the Lord thy God,
that thou may do no work.

Then reken the.vij. wekes, and begin to reke^ the.vij. wekes when the syccle
begins in the corn, and keep the feast of wekes unto the Lord thy God,
that thou give a frewil offeringe of thine hand unto the Lord thy God
acordinge as the Lord thy God has blessed the. And rejoice before the Lord
thy God both thou, thy son, thy daughter, thy servant and thy maid, and
the leuite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, the fatherless and the
wedowe that are among you, in the place which the Lord thy God has chosen to
make his name dwell there. And remember that thou why.
wast a seruau^te in Egipte, that thou observe and do these ordinances.

Thou shall observe the feast of tabernacles vij. days long, after that thou
have gathered in thy corn and thy wine. And thou shall rejoice in that thy
feast, both thou and thy son, thy daughter, thy servant, thy maid, the
leuite, the stranger, the fatherless and the wedowe that are in thy cities.
Seven days thou shall keep holy day unto the Lord thy God, in the place
which the Lord shall chose: for the Lord thy God shall bless the in all thy
fruits and in all the works of thine hands, and thou shall be all together
gladness. Three times in the year shall al your males appear before the Lord
thy God in the place which he shall chose: In the feast of sweet bred, in the
feast of wekes and in the booth feast. And they shall not appear before the
Lord empty: but every man with the gift of his hand, acordynge to the
blessinge of the Lord thy God which he has given the.

The.xvij. Chapter.
IVdges and officers thou shall make the in Iudge^
all thy cities which the Lord thy God gives the through out thy trybes. and
let the^ judge the people righteously. Wrest not the law nor know any
person nether take any reward: for gifts blind the wise and peruerte the
words of the righteous. But in all thing follow righteousness, that thou
may lyuc and enjoy the land which the Lord thy God gives the.

Thou shall plant no grove of what soever trees it be, nigh unto the altar of
the Lord thy God which thou shall make the. Thou shall set the up no piler,
which the Lord thy God hates. Thou shall offer unto the Lord thy God no ox
or sheep where in is any deformyte, what soever evil fauerednesse it be: for
that is an abhominacion unto the Lord thy God.

If there be found among you in any of thy cities which the Lord thy God
gives the man or woman that has wrought wekednesse in the sight of the Lord
thy God, that they have gone beyond his appointment, so that they have gone
and served strange gods and worshipped the^, whether it be the son or moan
or anythinge contained in heaven which I forbade, and it was told the and thou
have herd of it: Then thou shall enquere diligently. And if it be true and the
thing of a suertye that soch abhomynacion is wrought in Israel Opinly in the
gates and not secretlye in preson: with lawful witness and not tormentynge
them or mak^ge them swer agen^^ the^ selves or ^or swear the^ selves
the^ thou shall bring forth that man or that woman which have committed that
weked thing, * unto thy gates and shall stone the^ with stones and they shall
dye. At the mouth of.ij. or. iij witnesses shall he that is worthy of deeth,
dye: but at the mouth of one witness he shall not dye. And the hands of the
witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterward the hands of all
the people: so shall thou put wekednesse away from the.

If a matter be to hard for the in judgment between blood and blood, plee
and plee, plage and plage in matters of strife within thy cities: Then Arise and
get the up unto the place which the Lord thy God has chosen, and goo unto
the preastes the levites and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and
axe, and they shall show the how to judge. And se that thou do acordinge to
that which they of that place which the Lord has chosen show the and se that
thou observe to do acordinge to all that they inform the. Acordinge to the
law which they teach the and manner of judgment which they tell the, se that
thou do and that thou bow not from that which they she we the, nether to the
right hand nor to the lift.

And that man that will do presumptuously, so that he will not harken unto the
preast that stondeth there to mynistre unto the Lord thy God or unto the
judge, shall dye: and so thou shall put away evil from Israel. And all the
people shall hear and shall fear, and shall do nomare presumptuosly,

When thou art come unto the lord which the Lord thy God gives the and
enioyest it and dwell therein: If thou shall say, I will set a king over
me, like unto all the nations kyu^^s
that are about me: Then thou shall make him king over the, whom the Lord
thy God shall chose. One of thy brethern must thou make king over the, and
may not set a stranger over the which is not of thy brethern. But in any
wise let hi^ not hold to many horses, that he bring not the people again to
Egipte through the multitude of horses, for as much as the Lord has said
unto you: ye shall hence forth goo no moare again that way. Also he shall not
have to many wives, lest his heart turn away, nether shall he gather him
silver and godlde to much.

And when he is seten upon the seat off his kingdom, he shall write him out
this second law in a book taking a copye of the preastes the levites. And it
shall be with him and he shall read there in all days of his life *
that he may learn to fear the Lord his God for to keep all the words of
this law and these ordinances for to do them: that his heart arise not above
his brethern and that he turn not from the commaundment: either to the right
hand or to the lift: that both he and his childern may prolonge their days
in his kingdom in Israel.

The.xviij. Chapter.
THe preastes the Levites all the trybe off Leui shall have no part nor

with Israel. The offrynges of the Lord and his enheritaunce they shall eat,
but shall have no enheritaunce among their brethern: the Lord he is their
enheritaunce, as he has said unto them. And this is the duty of the
preastes, of the people and of them that offer, whether it be ox or sheep:
They must give unto the preast, the shulder and the two chekes and the maw, the
firstfrutes of thy corn, wine and oil, and the first of thy shepesheryng must
thou give him. For the Lord thy God has chosen him out of all thy trybes to
stand and to ministre in the name of the Lord: both hi^ and his sons for
ever.

If a Leuite come out of any of thy cities or any place of Israel, where he is
a segeorner, and come with all the lust of his heart unto the place which the
Lord has chosen: he shall there ministre in the name of the Lord his god as
all his brethern the Levites do which stand there before the Lord. And they

patrimonye of his elders.

When thou art come in to the land which the Lord thy God gives the, se that
thou learn not to do after the abhominacyo^s of these nacyons. Let there not
be found among you that makes his son or his daughter go through fire,
either a bruterar or a maker of dismale days or that uses witchcraft or a
sorcerar or a charmar or that speaks with a spirit or a sothsayer or that
talks with them that are deed. For all that do soch things are abhominacion
unto the Lord: and because of these abhominacyons the Lord thy God does cast
them out before the, be pure therefore with the Lord thy God. For these nacyons
which thou shall conquer, harken unto makers off dysemall days and
bruterars. But the Lord thy God permytteth not that to the.

The Lord thy God will sterre up a prophet among you: eue^ of thy brethern

the voice of my Lord God nomoare nor se this great fire any moare, that I dye
not. And the Lord said unto me: they have well spoken, I will raise them up
a prophett from among their brethern like unto the and will put my words in
to his mouth and he shall speak unto the^ all that I shall command him. And
whosoever will not kerken unto the words which he shall speak in my name, I
will require it off him.

But the prophet which shall presume to speak ought in my name which I
commanded him not to speak, and he that speaks in the name of strange
Gods, the same prophet shall dye. And if thou say in thine heart, how shall
I know that which the Lord has no^ spoken? When a prophet speaks in the
name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to pass, that is the
thing which the Lord has not spoken. But the prophet has spoken it
presumptuously: be not aferde therefore of him.

The.xix. Chapter.
WHen the Lord thy Gad has destroyed the nacyons whose land the Lord thy
God gives the, and thou have conquered the^ and dwell in their cities and
in their housses: thou shall appoynte.iij. cities in the land which the Lord
thy God gives the to possess it: thou shall prepare the way and deuyde the
costs of thy land which the Lord thy God gives the to enheret, in to.iij.
parts that whosoever commits murthur may flee thither.

not in time passed: As when a man goes unto the wodd with his neighbor to hew
wod, and as his hand fetches a stroke with the axe, the head slippeth from
the helue and smyteth his neighbor that he dye: the same shall flee unto one
off the same cities and be saved. Lest the executer of blood follow after the
sleyer while his heart is whote and overtake him, because the way is long, and
slay him, and yet there is no cause worthy of deeth in him, in as much as he
hated not his neghbour in time passed. Wherefore I As hate makes the dead
evil: so love make^h it good.
command the saying: se that thou appoynte out.iij. cities*

And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy costs as he has sworn unto thy fathers
and give the all the land which he said he would give unto thy fathers (so
that thou keep all these commaundmentes to do them, which I command the this
day, that thou love the Lord thy god and walk in his ways ever) then thou
shall add.iij. cities moo unto those.iij. that innocent blood be not shed in
thy land which the Lord thy God gives the to enheret, and so blood come
upon the,

But and if there be any man that hates his neighbor and lays awayte for
him and ryseth agenst him and smyteth him that he dye, and flees unto any of
these cities. Then let the elders of his city send and fetch him thence and
deliver him in to the hondes of the justice of blood, and he shall dye, Let
thine eye have no pity on him, and so thou shall put away innocent blood
from Israel, and happy art thou.

Thou shall not remove thy neghbours mark which they of old time have set in
thine enheritaunce that thou enherettest in the land which the Lord thy God
gives the to enjoy it.

One witness shall not rise agenst a man in Yes in all matter of heresy agenst

any manner trespace or sin, whatsoever sin a man synneth: But at the mouth
of two witnesses or of.iij. witnesses shall all matters be tried.

If an unrighteous witness rise up agenst a man to accuse him of trespace:
then let both the men which strive together stand before the Lord, before the
preastes and the judges which shall be in those days, and let the judges inquire
a good. And if the witness be found false and that he has given false
witness agenst his brother the^ shall ye do unto hi^ as he had tought to do
unto his brother, and so thou shall put euel away from the. And other shall
hear and fear and shall hence forth comytt no more any soch wekednesse among
you. And let thine eye have no compassion, but life for life, eye for eye, toth
for toth, hand for hand, and foot for foot.

The.xx. Chapter
WHen thou go out to battle agenste thine enemies, and see horses and
charettes and people moo then thou, be not aforde of them, for the Lord thy
God is with the which brought the out of the land off Egipte. And when ye
are come nigh unto battle, let the preast come forth and speak unto the people
and say unto them: Hear Israel, ye are come unto battle agenste your
enemies, let not your hearts faynte, nether fear nor be amassed nor a dread
of them. For the Lord thy God goes with you to fight for you agenste your
enemies and to save you.

And let the officers speak unto the people saying: If any man have bylt a
new housse Dedicat: the leui^es I suppose, hallowed the^m as we do our ships.
and have not * dedicate it, let him goo and return to his housse lest he dye
in the battle, and another dedicate it. And if any man have planted a

his house, lest he dye in the battle and another make it comen. And if any
man be betrothed unto a wife and have not taken her, let him goo and return
again unto his housse, lest he dye in the battle and another take her.

And let the officers speak further unto the people and say. If any man fear
and be faynte herted, let him goo and return unto his housse, lest his
brothers heart be made faynte as well as his. And when the officers have made an
end off speaking unto the people, let the^ make captains of war over them.

When thou come nigh unto a city to fight agenst it, offer them peace. And if
they answer the again peasably, and open unto the, then let all the people
that is found therein be tributaries unto the and serve the. But and if they
will make no peace with the, then make war agenste the city and besege it.
And when the Lord thy God has delivered it in to thine hands, smite all the
males thereof with the edge of the sword, save the weme^ and the childern and
the catell and all that is in the city and all the spoil thereof take unto
thy self and eat the spoil of thine enemies which the Lord thy God gives
the. Thus thou shall do unto all the cities which are a great way of from
the and not of the cities of these nations.

But in the cities of these nations which the Lord thy God gives the to
enheret, thou shall save alive nothing that bretheth. But shall destroy them
with out redemption, both the Hethites, the Amorites, the Cananites, the
Pherezites, the Heuites and the Iebusites, as the Lord thy God has commanded
the, that they teach you not to do after all their abhominacyons which they
do unto their gods, and so should sin agenst the Lord your God

When thou have beseged a city long time in making war agenst it to take
it, destroy not the trees thereof, that thou would thrust an axe unto them.
For thou may eat of the^, and therefore destroy them not. For the trees of
the feldes are no men, that they might come agenst the to besege the.
Neuerthelater those trees which thou know that me^ eat not of them, thou
may destroy and cut them down and make bolwerkes agenst the city that
makes war with the, until it be overthrown.

The.xxj. Chapter.
IF one be found slain in the land which the Lord thy God gives the to
possess it, and lies in the feldes, and not known who has slain him: Then
let thine elders and thy judges come forth and meet unto the cities that are
round about the slain. And let the elders of that city which is next unto
the slain man, take an heyffer that is not labored with nor has drawn in
the lock, and let them bring her unto a valeye where is nether earinge nor
sowenge, and strike of her heed there in the valey.

Then let the preastes the sons of Leui come forth (for the Lord thy God
has chosen them to ministre and to bless in the name off the Lord and
therefore at their mouth shall all strife and plage be tried). And all the
elders of the city that is next to the slain man shall wasshe their hands
over the heyffer that is beheded in the plain, and shall answer and say:
our hands have not shed this blood ne there have our eyes seen it. Be
merciful Lord unto thy people Israel which thou have delivered and put not
innocent blood unto thy people Israel: and the blood shall be forgeuen the^
Right in the lords sight, and not in thine imaginacion.
And so shall thou put innocent blood from the, when thou shall have done that
which is right in the sight of the Lord.

When thou go to war agenst thine enemies and the Lord thy God has
delivered them in to thine hands and thou have take them captyue, and seist
among the captyues a bewtifull woman and have a fantasye unto her that thou
would have her to thy wife. Then bring her home to thine housse and let her
shave her heed and pare her nails and put her raiment that she was taken in
from her, and let her remain in thine housse and be weep her father and her
mother a month long and after that goo in unto her and marie her and let her
be thy wife. And if thou have no favor unto her, then let her go whother she
lusts: for thou may not sell her for monye nor make cheuesau^ce of her,
because thou have humbled her.

If a man have two wives, one loved and another hated, and they have borne him
children, both the loved and also the hated* If the firstborne be the son of
the hated: then when he deals his goods among his childern, he may not
make the son of the beloved firstborne before the son of the hated which
is in dead the firstborne: But he shall know the son off the hated for his
firstborne, that he give him dowble off all that he has. For he is the first
off his strength, and to him belongs the right of the firstborneshippe.

If any man have a son that is stuburne, and disobedient, that he will not
harken unto the voice of his father and voice of his mother, and they have
taught him nurture, but he would not harken unto them: Then let his father and
his mother take him and bring him out unto the elders of that city and unto
the gate of that same place, and say unto the elders of the city. This our
son is stoburne and disobedient and will not harken unto our voice, he is a
ryoter and a dronkarde. Then let all the men of that city stone him with
stones unto deeth. And so thou shall put evil away from the, and all Israel
shall hear and fear.

If a man have committed a trespace worthy of deeth and is put to deeth for it
and hanged on tree: let not his body remain all night upon the tree, but
burye him the same day. For the curse off God is on him that is hanged. Defile
not thy land therefore, which the Lord thy God gives the to enherett.

The.xxij. Chapter.
IF thou se thy brothers ox or sheep goo astraye, thou shall not with draw
thy self from them: But shall bring them home again unto thy brother. If thy
brother be not nigh unto the or if thou know him not, then bring them unto
thine own housse and let them be with the, until thy brother axe after them,
and then deliver him them again. In like manner shall thou do with his ass,
with his raiment and with all lost things of thy brother which he has lost
and thou have found, and thou may not withdraw thy self.

If thou se that thy brothers ass or ox is fallen down by the way, thou
shall not withdraw thy self from them: but shall help him to heue them up
again.

The woman shall not weere that which pertayneth unto the man, nether shall a
man put on woman's raiment. For all that do so, are abhomynacyon unto the Lord
thy God.

If thou chance upon a byrds nest by the way, in what soever tree it be or
on the grou^ de, whether they be young or eggs, and the da me sittenge upon
the young or upon the eggs: Thou shall not take the mother with the young.
But shall in any wise let the clame go and take the young, that thou may
prospere and prolonge thy days.

When thou byldest a new housse, thou shall make a batelme^t unto the roffe,
that thou lade The housses be flatt in those co^tres.

Thou shall not sow thy vyneyarde with diverse sede: lest thou halowe the sede
which thou have sown with the fruit off thy vyneyarde.

Thou shall not plowe with an ox and an as se togetherr

Thou shall not weere a garment made of woll and flax together.

Thou shall put rybandes upon the.iiij. quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou
couerest thy self.

If a man take a wife and when he has lain with her hate her and leye
shameful things unto her charge and bring up an evil name upon her and
say: I took this wife, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: The^
let the father of the damsel and the mother bring forth the tokens of the
damsels virginite, unto the elders of the city, even unto the gate. And let
the damsels father say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to
wife and he hates her: and loo, he lays shameful things unto her charge
saying, I found not thy daughter a maid. And yet these ar the tokens of my
daughters virginite. And let them sprede the vesture before the elders off the
city. Then let the elders of that city take that man and chastyce him and
merce him in an hundred sycles of silver and give them unto the father of the
damsel, because he has brought up an evil name upon a maid in Israel. And
she shall be his wife, and he may not put her away all his days. But and if the
thing be of a suertie that the damsel be not found a virgen, let them bring
her unto the door of her fathers housse, and let the men of that city stone
her with stones to death, because she has wrought folly in Israel, to play
the whore in her fathers housse. And so thou shall put evil away from the.

If a man be sound lyenge with a woman, that has a wedded husbonde, then let
the^ dye etherother of the^: both the man that lay with the wife and also the
wife: so thou shall put away evil from Israel.

If a maid be hanfasted unto an husbonde, and then a man find her in the
town and leye with her, then ye shall bring them both out unto the gates of
that same city and shall stone them with stones to deeth: The damsel because
she cried not being in the city: And the man, because he has humbled his
neighbors wife, and thou shall put away evell from the.

But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and force her and leye
with her: The^ the man that lay with her shall dye alone, and unto the damsel
thou shall do no harm: because there is in the damsel no cause of deeth. For
as when a man ryseth agenste his neighbor and sleyeth him, eue^ so is this
matter. For he found her in the feldes and the be trothed damsel cried: but
there was no man to succoure her.

If a man find a maid that is not betrothed and take her and lie with her and
be found: Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsells
father.l. sycles of silver. And she shall be his wife, because he has humbled
her, and he may not put her away all his days.

No man shall take his fathers wife, nor vnheale his fathers covering.

The.xxiij. Chapter
NOne that is gelded or has his preuey members cut of, shall come in to the
congregation of the Lord. And he that is borne of a comen woman shall not come
inthe congregation of the Lord, no in the tenth generacyon he shall not enter
in to the congregacyon of the Lord. The Ammonites and the Moabites shall not
come in to the co^gregacyon of the Lord, no not in the tenth generation, no
they shall never come in to the congregation of the Lord, because they met you
not with bred and water in the way when ye came out of Egipte, and because
they hired agenst the Balaam the son of Beor the interpreter of Mesopotamia,
to curse the. Never thelesse the Lord thy God would not harken unto Balaam,
but turned the curse to a blessinge unto the, because the Lord thy God loved
the. Thou shall never therefore seek that which is prosperouse or good for them
all thy days for ever.

Thou shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother: nether shall thou
abhor an Egiptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land. The childern
that are begotten of them shall come in to the congregacyon of the Lord in
the.iij. generation.

When thou go out with the host agenst thine enemies, keep the from all
wekednesse for the Lord is among you.

If there be any man that is unclean by the reason of uncleanness that
chances him by night, let him goo out of the host and not come in again
until he have washed him self with water before the even: and then when the
son is down, let him come in to the host again.

Thou shall have a place without the host whother thou shall resort to and
thou shall have a sharp point at the end of thy wepon: and when thou will
ease thy self, dig therewith and turn and cover that which is departed from
the. For the Lord thy God walks in thine host, to rydd the and to set thine
enemies before the. Let thine host be pure that he se no unclean thing among
you and turn from you.

Thou shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his
master unto the. Let him dwell with the, eue^ among you in what place he him
self likes best, in one of thy cities where it is good for him, an^ vex him
not.

There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor whorekeper of the sons
of Israel

Thou shall nether bring the hyre of an who The pope will take tribute of them

of vow: for eue^ both of them are abhominacion unto the Lord thy God.

Thou shall be no usurer unto thy brother, nether in money nor in fode, nor in
any manner thing that is lent upon vserye. Unto a stranger thou may lend
upon vserye, but not unto thy brother, that the Lord thy God may bless the
in all that thou set thine hand to in the land whother thou go to
conque re it.

When thou have vowed a vow unto the Lord thy God, se thou be not slack to
pay it. For he will surely require it of the, and it shall be sin unto the. If
thou shall leave vowinge, it shall be no sin unto the: but that which is once
gone out off thy lips, thou must keep and do, according as thou have vowed
unto the Lord thy god a frewilloffrynge which thou have spoken with thy mouth.

When thou come in to thy neghboures vy neyarde, thou may eat grapes thy
belyfull at thine own pleasure: but thou shall put none in thy bag.

When thou go in to thy neighbors corn, thou may pluck the ears with
thine hand but thou may not move a sycle unto thy neghbours corn.

The.xxiiij. Chapter.
WHen a man has taken a wife and married her, if she find no favor in his
eyes, because he has spied some uncleanness in her. Then let him write her a
bylle of devor cement and put it in her hand and send her out of his housse.
If when she is departed out of his housse, she goo and be another man's wife and
the second husbonde hate her and write her a letter of deuorcement and put it
in her hand and send her out of his housse, or if the second man dye which
took her to wife. Her first man which sent her away may not take her again
to be his wife, in as much as she is defiled. For that is abhominacyon in the
sight of the Lord: that thou defile not the lord with sin, which the Lord
thy God gives the to enherett.

When a man takes a new wife, he shall not goo a warrefare nether shall be
charged with any business: but shall be fre at home one year and rejoice with
his wife which he has taken.

No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge, for then he
takes a man's life to pledge.

If any man be found stealing any of his brethern the childern of Israel, and
makes cheuesaunce of him or sells him, the thief shall dye. And thou shall
put evil away from the.

Take heed to thy self as concerning the plage of leprosye, that thou observe
diligently to do acordinge to all that the preastes the levites shall theach
the, as I commanded them Do as the prcastes teach you: but as I have taught
the^ and not as they fay^e.
so ye shall observe to do. Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Mir Iam
by the way, after that ye were come out off Egipte.

If thou lend thy brother any manner soker, thou shall not goo in to his housse
to fetch a pledge: but shall stand without and the man to whom thou lendest,
shall bring the the pledge out at the door. Forthermore if it be a pore body,
goo not to sleep with his pledge: but deliver him the pledge again by that the
son goo down, and let him sleep in his own raiment and bless the. And it
shall be righteousness unto the, before the Lord thy God.

Thou shall not defraude an hired servaunte that is nedye and poor, whether he
be off thy brethern or a stranger that is in thy land with in thy cities. Give
him his hyre the same day, and let not the son goo down thereon. For he is
nedye and therewith susteyneth his life, lest he cry agenst the unto the Lord
and it be sin unto the.

The fathers shall not dye for the childern nor the childern for the fathers:
but every man shall dye for his own sin.

Hinder not the right of the stranger nor of the fatherless, nor take wedowes
raiment to pledge. But remember that thou wast a servaunte in Egipte, and how
the Lord thy God delivered the thence. Wherefore I command the to do this
thing.

When thou cuttest down thine herueste in the field and have forgotte a shefe
in the field thou shall not goo again and fett it: But it shall be for the
stranger, the fatherless and the wedowe, that the Lord thy God may bless
the in all the works of thine hand. When thou beatest down thine olyue,
trees thou shall not make clean riddaunce after the: but it shall be for the
stranger, the fatherless and the wedowe. And when thou gatherest thy
vyneyarde* thou shall not gather clean after the: but it shall be for the
stranger, the fatherless and the wedowe. And remember that thou wast a
servant in the land of Egipte: wherefore I command the to do this thing.

The.xxv. Chapter.
WHen there is strife between men, let the^ come unto the law, and let the
judges justify the rightuous and condemn the trespeaser. And if the
trespeaser be worthy of strypes, then let the judge cause to take him down and
to beat him before his face according to his trespace, unto a certain
number.xl. stirpes he shall give him and not pass: lest if he should exceade
and beat him above that with many stripes, thy brother should appear ungodly
before thine eyes.

Thou shall not mosell the ox that treads out the corn.

When brethern dwell together and one of It were hard to prove this a ceremonye
them dye and have no child, the wife of the deed shall not be given out unto
a stranger: but her brotherlawe shall goo in unto her and take her to wife and
marie her. And the eldest son which she bears, shall stand up in the name
of his brother which is deed, that his name be not put out in Israel.

But and if the man will not take his systerlawe, then let her goo to the gate
unto the elders and say: My brotherlawe refuses to sterre up unto his
brother a name in Israel, he will not marie me. Then let the elders of his
city call unto him and comen with him. If he stand and say: I will not take
her, then let his systerlawe goo unto him in the presence of the elders and
loose his show of his foot and spytt in his face and answer and say. So
shall it be done unto that man that will not bylde his brothers housse. And his
name shall be called in Israel, the vnshoed housse.

If when men strive together, one with another, the wife of the one ru^ne to,
for to ryd her husbonde out of the hands of him that smyteth him and put forth
her hand and take him by the secrettes: cut of her hand, and let not thine
eye pity her.

Thou shall not have in thy bag two manner weyghtes, a great and a small:
nether shall thou have in thine house diverse measures, a great and a small.
But thou shall have a perfect and a just measure: that thy days may be
lengthed in the land which the Lord thy God gives the, For all that do
soche things and all that do unright, are abhominacion unto the Lord thy God.

Remember what Amalech did unto the by the way after thou came out of
Egipte, he met the by the way and smote the hynmost of you, all that were
over labored and dragged by hynde, when thou wast faynted and werye, and he
feared not God. Therefore when the Lord thy God has given the rest from all
thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God gives the
to enheret and possess: se that thou put out the name of Amalech from under
heaven, and forget not.

The.xxvj. Chapter.
WHen thou art come in to the land which the Lord thy God gives the to
enherett and have enjoyed it and dwell there in: take of the first of all
the fruit of the earth, which thou have brought in out of the land that the
Lord thy God gives the and put it in a maunde and goo unto the place which
the Lord thy God shall chose to make his name dwell there. And thou shall come
unto the preast that shall be in those days and say unto him I knowledge this
day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come unto the contre which the Lord
swear unto our fathers for to give us.

And the preast shall take the maunde out of thine hand, and set it down
before the alter of the Lord thy God. And thou shall answer and say before
the Lord thy God: The Sirians would have destroyed my father, and he went
down in to Egipte and sogeorned there with a few folk and grew there unto a
nacyon great, myghtie and full of people. And the Egiptians vexed us and
troubled us, and laded us with cruel bondage. And we cried un to the Lord God
of our fathers, and the Lord herd our voice and looked on our aduersyte,
labor and oppressyon. And the Lord brought us out of Egipte with a mighty
hand and a stretched out arm and with great tereblenesse and with signs and
wonders. And he has brought us in to this place and has given us this land
that flows with milk and honye. And now loo, I have brought the first
fruits off the land which the Lord has given me. And set it before the
Lord thy God and worshepe before the Lord thy God and rejoice over all the
good things which the Lord thy God has given unto the and unto thine
housse, both thou the Leuite and the stranger that is among you.

When thou have made an end of tithynge all the tithes of thine increase the
third year, the year of tythynge: and have given it unto the Leuite, the
stranger, the fatherless and the wedowe, and they have eaten in thy gates and
filled them selves. Then say before the Lord thy God: I have brought the
hallowed things out of mine housse and have given them unto the Leuite, the
stranger, the fatherless and the wedowe acordynge to all the commaundmentes
which thou commaundest me: I have not ouerskypped thy commaundmentes, nor
forgetten them. I have not eaten thereof in my moornynge nor taken away
thereof unto any uncleanness, nor spente thereof about any deed corse: but
have herkened unto the uoyce of the Lord my God, and have done after all that
he commanded me, look down from thy holy habitacyon heaven and bless thy
people Israel and the land which thou have given us (as thou swarest unto our
fathers) a land that flows with milk and honye.

This day the Lord thy God has commanded the to do these ordinances and
laws. Keep them therefore and do them with all thine heart and all thy soul.
Thou have set up the Lord this day to be thy God and to walk in his ways
and to keep his ordinances, his commaundmentes and his laws, and to harken
unto his voice. And the Lord has set the up this day, to be a several
people unto him (as he has promised the) and that thou keep his
commaundmentes, and to make the hye above all nacyons which he has made, in
praise, in name and honor: that thou may be an holy people unto the Lord
thy God, as he has said.

The.xxvij. Chapter.
ANd Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people saying: keep all
the commaundmentes which I command you this day. And when ye be come over
Iordayne unto the land which the Lord thy God gives the, set up great
stones and plaster them with plaster, and write upon the^ all the words of
this law, when thou art come over: that thou may come in to the land
which the Lord thy God gives the: a land that flows with milk and honye*
as the Lord God off thy fathers has promised the.

When ye be come over Iordayne, se that ye set up these stones which I
command you this day in mount Eball, and plaster them with plaster. And
there bylde unto the Lord thy God, an altar of stones and se thou lift up no
yerne upon them: But thou shall make the altar of the Lord thy God of
rughstones and offer burntoffrynges thereon unto the Lord thy God. And thou
shall offer peaceof frynges and shall eat there and rejoice before the Lord
thy God. And thou shall write upon the stones all the words of this law,
manyfestly and well

And Moses with the preastes the Levites spoke unto all Israel saying: take heed and hear Israel, this day thou art become the people of the Lord thy
God. Harken therefore unto the voice of the Lord thy God and do his
co^maundme^tes and his ordinances which I command you this day.

And Moses charged the people the same day saying: these shall stand upon
mount Grisim to bless the people, when ye are come over lordayne: Symeon,
Leui, Judah, Isachar, Joseph and Ben Iamin. And these shall stand upon mount
Eball to curse: Ruben, Gad Asser, Zabulon, Dan and Neptaly. And the Levites
shall begin and say unto all the men of Israel wi^h a loud voice.

Cursed be he that makes any carved image or image of metal (an abhominacion
unto Here of take the popes an occasion to curse.iiij. times in the year
the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftesman) and puts it in a
secrett place: And all the people shall answer and say Amen.

Cursed be he that curses his father or his mother, and all the people shall
say Amen.

Cursed be he that remoueth his neghbours mark and all the people shall say
Amen.

Cursed be he that makes the blind goo out off his way, and all the people
shall say Amen,

Cursed be he that hyndreth the right of the stranger* fatherless and wedowe,
and all the people shall say Amen.

Cursed be he that lies with his fathers wife because he has opened his
fathers coueringe, and all the people shall say Amen.

Cursed be he that lies with any manner be, and all the people shall say
Amen.

Cursed be he that lies with his sister whether she be the daughter of his
father or off his mother, and all the people shall say Amen

Cursed be he that lies with his mother in law, and all the people shall say
Amen.

Cursed be he that smyteth his neighbor secretly, and all the people shall
say Ame^.

Cursed be he that takes a reward to flee innocent blood, and all the people
shall say Amen.

Cursed be he that ma^tayneth not all the words of this law to do them, and
all the people shall say

Amen.
The.xxviij. Chapter
IF thou shall harken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to
observe and to do all his commaundmentes which I command the this day. The
Lord will set the an hye above all nations of the earth. And all these
blessings shall come on the and over take the, if thou shall harken unto the
voice of the Lord thy God. Blessed shall thou be in the town and blessed in
the feldes, blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, the fruit of thy ground and
the fruit of thy catell, the fruit of thine oxen, and thy flocks of sheep,
blessed shall thine almery be and thy store. Blessed shall thou be, both when
thou go out, and blessed when thou come in.

The Lord shall smite thine enemies that rise agenst the before thy face. They
shall come out agenst the one way, and flee before the seven ways. The Lord
shall command the blessing to be with the in thy store housses and in all
that thou set thine hand to, and will bless the in the land which the
Lord thy god gives the.

The Lord shall make the an holy people unto himself, as he has sworen unto
the: if thou shall keep the commaundmentes of the Lord thy God and walk in
his ways.

And all nacyons of the earth shall se that thou art called after the name of
the Lord, and they shall be aferde off the. And the Lord shall make the
plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, in the fruit off thy catell and
in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the Lord swear unto thy
fathers to give the.

The Lord shall open unto the his good treasure, even the heaven, to give
rain unto thy land in due ceason and to bless all the labors of thine
hand. And thou shall lend unto many nacyo^s, but shall not need to borowe thy
self. And the Lord shall set the before and not behind, and thou shall be
above only and not beneth: if that thou harken unto the commaundmentes of the
Lord thy God which I command the this day to keep and to do them. And se
that thou bow not from any of these words which I command the this day
either to the right hand or to the left, that thou would goo after straung
gods to serve them.

But and if thou will not harken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to keep
and to do all his commaundmentes and ordinances which I command the this
day: then all these curses shall come upon the and overtake the: Cursed shall
thou be in the town, and cursed in the field, cursed shall thine almery be and
thy store. Cursed shall the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land be and
the fruit of thine oxen and the flocks of thy sheep. And cursed shall thou be
when thou go in, and when thou go out.

And the Lord shall send upon the cursynge, going to naught and complaynyng
in all that thou set thine hand to what soever thou do: until thou be
destroyed and brought to naught quyckely, because of the wekednesse of thine
invencyons in that thou have forsaken the Lord. And the Lord shall make the
pestilence cleave unto the, until he have consumed the from the land whether
thou go to enjoy it. And the Lord shall smite the with swellynge, with
fevers, heet, burning, wetherynge, with smiting and bia stinge. And they
shall follow the, until thou perish.

And the heaven that is over thy heed shall be b^asse, and the earth that is under
the yerne. And the Lord shall turn the rain of the land unto powder and
dust: even from heaven they shall come down upon the, until thou be brought to
naught. And the Lord shall plage the before thine enemies: Thou shall come out
one way agenst them, and flee seven ways before them, and shall be scatered
among all the kingdoms of the earth. And thy carcass shall be meat unto all
manner fowls of the air and unto the beestes of the earth, and no man shall
fraye them away.

And the Lord will smite the with the botches of Egipte and the ^morodes,
scalle and maungynesse, that thou shall not be healed thereof. And the Lord
shall smite the with madness, blyndnesse and dasynge of heart. And thou shall
grope at none day as the blind gropeth in darkness, and shall not come to
the right way.

And thou shall suffer wrong only and be polled evermore, and no man shall
soker the, thou shall be betrothed unto a wife, and another shall lie with her.
Thou shall bylde an housse and another shall dwell therein. Thou shall plant a
vyneyarde, and shall not make it comen. Thine ox shall be slain before thine
eyes, and thou shall not eat thereof. Thine ass shall be violently taken away
even before thy face, and shall not be restored the again. Thy sheep shall be
given unto thine enemies, and no man shall help the.

Thy sons and thy daughters shall be give unto another nation, and thine eyes
shall se and dase upon them all day long, but shall have no might in thine
hand. The fruit of thy land and all thy labors shall a nacyon which thou
know not, eat, and thou shall but soffre violence only and be oppressed
always: that thou shall be clean beside thy self for the syghte of thine eyes
which thou shall se.

The Lord shall smite the with a myscheuous botche in the knees and legs, so
that thou ^a^st not be healed: eue^ from the sole of the foot unto the top of
the heed.

The Lord shall bring both the and thy king which thou have set over the,
unto a nacyon which nether thou nor thy fathers have known, and there thou
shall serve strange gods: even wodd and stone. And thou shall goo to wast
and be made an ensample and a gestynge stock unto al nations whether the Lord
shall carye the.

Thou shall carry much seed ou^ in to the field, and shall gather but little in:
for the locustes shall destroy it, Thou shall plant a vyneyarde and dress
it, but shall nether drink off the wine nether gather of the grapes, for the
worms shall eat it. Thou shall have olyue trees in all thy costs, but shall
not be anointed with the oil, for thine olyue trees shall be rooted out. Thou
shall get sons and daughters, but shall not have them: for they shall be carried
away captyue. All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall be marred with
blastynge.

The strangers that are among you shall clyme above the up an hye, and thou
shall come down beneth allow. He shall lend the and thou shall not lend him,
he shall be before and thou behind.

Moreover all these curses shall come upon the and shall follow the and
overtake the, till thou be destroyed: because thou herkenedest not unto the
voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his co^maundme^tes and ordinances which
he commanded the, and they shall be upon the as miracles and wonders and upon
thy seed forever. And because thou seruedest not the Lord thy God with
ioyfulnesse and with a good heart for the abundaunce of all things, therefore
thou shall serve thine enemy which the Lord shall send upon the: in hunger
and thrust, in nakedness and in need off all ^hynge: and he shall put a yocke
off yerne ^ppon thine neck, until he have brought the to naught.

And the Lord shall bring a nation upon the from a far, even from the end
off the world, as swyfte as an egle flees: a nation whose tongue thou shall
not understand: a herd favored nation which shall not regard the person of
the old nor have compassion on the young. And he shall eat the fruit of thy
land and the fruit of thy catell until he have destroyed the: so that he
shall leave the nether corn, wine, nor oil, nether the e^crease of thine oxen
nor the flocks of thy sheep: until he have brought the to naught. And he
shall keep the in in all thy cities, until thy hye and strong walls be come
down wherei^ thou trustedest, through all thy land. And he shall besege the in
all thy cities through out all thy land which the Lord thy God has given the.

And thou shall eat the fruit of thine own body: the flessh of thy sons
and off thy daughters which the Lord thy God has given the, in that
straytenesse and sege where* with thine enemy shall besege the: so that it
shall grieve the man that is tender and exceadynge delycate among you, to look
on his brother and upon his wife that lies in his bosom and on the remnaunte
of his childern, which he has yet left, for fear of geuynge unto any of them
of the flesh of his childern, which he eats, because he has naught left
him in that straytenesse and sege wherewith thine enemy shall besege the in
all thy cytyes.

Ye and the woman that is so tender and delycate among you that she dare not
adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for softness and
tenderness, shall be grieved to look on the husbonde that leyeth in her bosom
and on her son and on her daughter: even because of the afterbyrthe that is
come out from between her legs, and because of her childern which she has
borne, because she would eat them for need off all things secretly, in the
straytenesse and sege wherewith thine enemy shall besege the in thy cities.

If thou will not be diligent to do all the words of this law that are
written in this book, for to fear this glorious and fearful name of the Lord
thy God: the Lord will smite both the and thy seed with wonderful plages and
with great plages and of long continuance, and with evil sekenesses and of
long duraunce. Moreover he will bring upon the all the diseases off Egipte
which thou wast afraid off, and they shall cleave unto the. Thereto all manner
sekenesse^ and all manner plages which are not written in the book of this
law, will the Lord bring upon the until thou be come to naught. And ye
shall be left few in number, where to fore ye were as the stars off heaven in
multitude: because thou would not herke^ unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

And as the Lord reioysed over you to do you good and to multiplye you: even
so he will rejoice over you, to destroy you and to bring you to naught. And
ye shabe wasted from of the land whother thou go to enjoy it, And the
Lord shall scater the among all nacyons from the one end of the world unto
the other, and there thou shall serve strange gods, which nether thou nor
thy fathers have known: even wod and stone.

And among these nacyons thou shall be no small season, and yet shall have no
rest for the sole of thy foot. For the Lord shall give the there a
tre^blynge heart and dasynge eyes and sorrow of mind. And thy life shall hang
before the, and thou shall fear both day and night and shall have no trust
in thy life. In the morning thou shall say, would God it were night. And at
night thou shall say, would God it were morning. For fear off thine heart
which thou shall fear, and for the syghte of thine eyes which thou shall se.

And the Lord shall bring the in to Egipte again with ships, by the way
which I bade the that thou should se it nomoare. And there ye shall be sold
unto your enemies, for bondmen and bondwemen: and yet no man shall bye you.

The.xxix. Chapter.
THese are the words of the appoyntme^t which the Lord commanded Moses to
make with the childern of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the appointment
which he made with them in Horeb.

And Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them: Ye have seen all that
the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egipte, unto Pharao and unto
all his servants, and unto all his land, and the great temptacyons which
thine eyes have seen and those great miracles and wonders: and yet the Lord
has not given you an heart to perceive, nor eyes to se, nor ears to hear
unto this day.

And I have led you.xl. year in the wilderness: and your clothes are not
waxed old upon you, nor are thy shows waxed old upon thy fete. Ye have
eaten no bred nor droncke wine or strounge drink: that ye might know, how
that he is the Lord your God.

And at the last ye came unto this place, and Sihon the king of Hesbon and Og
king of Basan came out agenst you unto battle, and we smote them and took
their land and gave it an heritaunce unto the Rubenites and Gadites and to the
half tribe of Manasse. Keep therefore the word of this appointment and do
them, that ye may understand all that ye ought to do.

Ye stand here this day every one of you before the Lord your God: both the
heedes of your trybes, your elders, your officers and all the me^ of Israel:
your childern, your wives and the straungere that are in thine host, from the
hewer of thy wod unto the drawer of thy water: that thou shulddest come under
the appointment of the Lord thy God, and under his oath which the Lord thy
God makes with the this day. For to make the a people unto him self, and
that he may be unto the a God, as he has said unto the and as he has sworn
unto thy fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

Also I make not this bond and this oath with you only: but both with him that
sto^deth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him
that is not here with us this day. For ye know how we have dwelt in the land
of Egipte, and how we came through the mids of the nations which we passed by.
And ye have seen their abhominacio^s and their ydolles: wod, stone, silver and
gold which they had.

Lest there be among you man or woman kynred or trybe that turns away in
his heart this day from the Lord our God, to goo and serve the gods of these
nations: and lest there be among you some root that bears gall and wormwod,
so that when he hears the words of this curse, he bless him self in his
heart saying: I fear it not, I will therefore walk after the lust of mine own
heart, that the drounken destroy the thurstie.

And so the Lord will not be merciful unto him, but then the wrath of the
Lord and his gelousye, smoke agenst that man, and all the curses that are
written in this book light upon him, and the Lord do out his name from under
heaven, and separate him unto evil out of all the trybes of Israel acordynge
unto all the curses of the appoyntement that is written in the book of this
law.

So that the generation to come of your childern that shall rise up after you
and the stranger that shall come from a far land, say when they se the
plages of that land, and the diseases where with the Lord has smytten it how
all the land is burnt up with bremstone and salt, that it is nether sown nor
bears nor any grass grows therein, after the ouertrowenge of Sodom,
Gomor, Adama and Zeboim: which the Lord ouerthrewe in his wrath and anger.

And than all nations also say: wherefore has the Lord done of this facion
unto this land? O how fearse is this greatt wrath? And men shall say: because
they left the testament of the Lord God of their fathers which he made with
them, when he brought them out of the land of Egipte. And they went and served
strange gods and worshipped them: gods which they knew not and which had
given them naught. And therefore the wrath off the Lord waxed whote upon that
land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book. And the
Lord cast them out of their land in anger, wrath and great furyou snesse,
and cast the^ in to a strange land, as it is come to pass this day.

The secrettes perteyne unto the Lord our God and the things that are opened
perteyne unto us and our childern for ever, that we do all the words of this
law.

The.xxx. Chapter.
WHen all these words are come upon the whether it be the blessinge or the
curse which I have set before the: yet if thou turn unto thine heart among
all the nations whother the Lord thy God has thruste the, and come again
unto the Lord thy God and harken unto his voice acordinge to all that I
command the this day: both thou and thy childern with all thine heart and all
thy soul: Then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity and have co^ppassion
upon the and goo and fett the again from all the nations, among which the
Lord thy God shall have scatered the.

Though thou wast cast unto the extreme parts of heaven: even from thence will
the Lord thy God gather the and from thence fett the and bring the in to the
land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shall enjoy it. And he will show
the kyndnesse and multiplye the above thy fathers. And the Lord thy God will
circumcyse thine heart and the heart of thy seed for to love the Lord thy God
with all thine heart and all thy soul, that thou may live. And the Lord thy
God will put al these curses upon thine enemies and on the^ that hate the and
persecute the.

But thou shall turn and harken unto the voice of the Lord and do all his
commaundmentes which I command the this day And the Lord thy God will make
the plenteous in all the works of thine hand and in the fruit of thy body,
in the fruit of thy catell and fruit of thy land and in riches. For the Lord
will turn again and rejoice over the to do the good, as he reioysed over thy
fathers: If thou harken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his
commaundmentes and ordynaunces which are written in the book of this law, if
thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart and all thy soul.

For the commaundment which I command the this day, is not separated from
the nether far of. It is not in heaven, that thou neadest to say: who shall
goo up for us in to heaven, and fett it us, that we may hear it and do it:
Nether is it beyond the sea, that thou should say: who shall goo over see
for us and fett ^t us that we may hear it and do it: But the word is very
nigh unto the: even in thy mouth and in thine heart, that thou do it.

Behold I have set before you this day life and good, deeth and cuell: in
that I command the this day to love the Lord thy God and to walk in his
ways and to keep his commandments, his ordynaunces and his laws: that thou
may live and multipye, and that the Lord thy God man bless the in the land
whother thou go to possess it.

But and if thine heart turn away, so that thou will not hear: but shall goo
astraye and worshepe strange gods and serve them, I pronounce unto you this
day, that ye shall surely peresh and that ye shall not prolonge your days
upon the land whother thou passest over Iordayne to goo and possess it.

I call to record this day unto you, heaven and earth, that I have set before
you life and deeth, blessing and cursynge: but chose life, that thou and thy
seed may live, in that thou love the Lord thy God herkenest unto his voice
and cleauest unto him. For he is thy life and the length of thy days, that
thou may dwell upon the earth which the Lord swear unto thy fathers:
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to give them.

The.xxxi. Chapter.
ANd Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel and said unto them I am
an hundred and.xx. year old this day, and can nomoare goo out and in. Also
the Lord has said unto me, thou shall not go over this Iordayne. The Lord
your God he will go over before the and he will destroy these nations before
the, and thou shall co^quere the^. And Joshua he shall goo over before the, as
the Lord has said. And the Lord shall do unto them, as he did to Sihon and
Og kings of the Amorites and unto their lands which kings he destroyed.

And when the Lord has delivered them to the, se that ye do unto them
acordynge unto all the co^maundmentes which I have commanded you. Pluck up
your hearts and be strong, dread not nor be aferde of them: for the Lord
thy God him self will goo with the, and will nether let the goo nor forsake the:

And Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel: Be
strong and bold, for thou must goo with this people unto the land which the
Lord has sworn unto their fathers to give them, and thou shall give it them
to enheret. And the Lord he shall goo before the and he shall be with the, and
will not let the goo nor forsake the, fear not therefore nor be discomforted.

And Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the preastes the sons of
Leui which bare the arc of the testament of the Lord, and unto all the elders
of Israel, and commanded them saying: At the end of.vij. year, in the time
of the fre year, in the fest of the tabernacles, when all Israel is come to
appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he has chosen: se that
thou read this law before all Israel in their ears Gather the people
together: both men, women and childern and the strangers that are in thy
cities, that they may hear, learn and fear the Lord your God, and be
diligent to keep all the words of this law, and that their childern which
know nothing may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as
ye live in the land whother ye goo over Iordayne to possess it.

And the Lord said unto Moses: Behold thy days are come, that thou must
dye. Call Joshua and come and stand in the tabernacle of witness, that I may
give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and stood in the tabernacle off
witness. And the Lord apeared in the tabernacle: even in the pyler off the
cloud. And the piler of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

And the Lord said unto Moses: behold, thou must sleep with thy fathers, and
this people will goo a whorynge after strange gods off the land whother
they goo and will forsake me and break the appoyntement which I have made with
them. And then my wrath will wax whote agenst them, and I will forsake them
and will hyde my face from them, and they shall be consumed. And when much
aduersyte and tribulacion is come upon them, then they will say: because our
God is not among us, these tribulacions are come upon us. But I will hyde my
face that same time for all the euels sake which they shall have wrought, in
that they are turned unto strange gods.

Now therefore write ye this song, and teach it the childern of Israel and put
it in their mouths that this song may be my witness unto the childern of
Israel. For when I have brought them in to the land which I swear unto their
fathers that runs with milk and honye, then they will eat and fill them
selves and wax fatt and turn unto strange gods and serve them and rail on
me and break my testament. And then when much myschefe and tribulacion is come
upon them, this song shall answer before them, and be a witness. It shall
not be forgetten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their
imaginacyon which they goo about even now before I have brought them in to
the land which I swear. And Moses wrote this song the same season, and taught
it the childern of Israel.

And the Lord gave Joshua the son off Nun a charge and said: be bold and
strong for thou shall bring the childern of Israel in to the land which I
swear unto them, and I will be with the.

When Moses had made an end of writing out the words of this law in a book
unto the end of them he commanded the Levites which bare the arcke of the
testament of the Lord saying: take the book off this law and put it by the
side of the arcke of the testament of the Lord your God, and let it be there
for a witness unto the. I For know thy stubernesse and thy stiff neck:
behold, while I am yet a live with you this day, ye have been dishobedient
unto the Lord: and how much moare after my deeth.

Gather unto me all the elders of your trybes and your officers, that I may
speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record agenst
them. For I am sure that after my deeth, they will utterly mar them selves
and turn from the way which I commanded you, and tribulacion will come upon
you in the later days, when ye have wrought welkednesse in the sight of the
Lord to provoke him with the works of your hands. And Moses spoke in the
ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, unto the end
of them.

The.xxxij. Chapter.
Hear o heaven, what I shall speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth.
My doctrine drop as does the rain, and my speech flow as does the dew,
as the mesellynge upon the herbs, and as the drops upon the grass. For I
will call on the name of the Lord: Magnify the might of our God.

He is a rock and perfect are his deades, for all his ways are with
discrecion. God is faithful and without wekednesse, both rightuous and just
is he.

The froward and ouerthwarte generation has marred them selves to him ward,
and ^re not his sons for their deformities sake,

Do thou so reward the Lord? O foolish nacyon and unwise. Is not he thy
father and thine owner? has he not made the and ordained the?

Remember the days that are past: consydre the years from time to time. Axe
thy father and ^e will show the, thine elders and they will ^ell the.

When the most highest gave the nacyons an ^nheritaunce, and divided the sons
of Adam ^e put the borders of the nations, fast by the multitude of the
childern of Israel.

For the Lords part is his folk, and Israel ^^ the portion of his
enheritaunce.

He found him in a deserte land, in a void ground and a rorynge wilderness.
he led hi^ about and gave him understanding, and kep^^ him as the aple of his
eye.

As an egle that stereth up her nest and ^^otereth over her young, he
stretched out ^is wings and took him up and bare him on his shulders.

The Lord alone was his guide, and there was no strange God with him.

He set him up upon an hye land, and he ate the increase of the feldes. And
he gave h^ honye to suck out of the rock, and oil out of the hard stone.

With butter of the kyne and milk of the sheep, with fatt of the lambs and
fatt ramme^ and he gootes with fatt kydneyes and with whete. And of the blood
of grapes thou dr^kest wine.

And Israel waxed fatt and kyked. Thou wast fatt, thick and smothe, And he let
God goo that made hi^ and despised the rock that saved him.

They angered him with strange gods and with abhominacions provoked him.

They offered unto feldedeuels and not to God, and to gods which they knew
not and to new gods that came newly up which their fathers feared not.

Of the rock that begat the thou art vn^ myndefull and have forgott God that
made the.

And when the Lord saw it, he was anger because of the provoking of his
sons and daughters.

And he said: I will hyde my face from the^ and will se what their end shall
be. For they are a froward generation and childern in who^ is no faith.

They have angered me with that which is no god, and provoked me with their
vanities And I again will anger them with the^ which are no people, and will
provoke the^ with ^ foelish nation.

For fire is kyndled in my wrath, and shall burn unto the botome of heell. And
shall consume the earth with her increase, and set a fire the botoms of the
mountains.

I will hepe myscheues upon the and will spe^de all mine arowes at them.

Burnt with hungre and consumed with heet and with bitter pestilence. I will
also send the ^ethe of beestes upon them and poison serpents.

Without forth, the sword shall rob the^ off their childern: and within in
the chamber, fear: both young men and young women and the suckelynges with
the me^ of gray ^eedes.

I have determened to scater the^ therowout ^e world, and to make away the
remembrance of them from among men.

Were it not that I feared the raylynge off their enemies, lest their
adversaries wo^de be proud and say: our hye hand has done a^ these works
and not the Lord.

For it is a nation that has an unhappy forcast, and has no vnderstonge in
them. ^ would they ware wise and understood this and would consider their later
end.

How it comes that one shall chase ^ thousand, and two putt ten thousand
of^ them to flyghte? except their rock had sold them, and because the Lord
had delivered them.

For our rock is not as their rock, no though our enemies be judge.

But their vynes are of the vynes of Sodom, and of the feldes of Gomorra. Their
grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters be bitter.

Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of aspes.

Are not soch things laid in store with me* and seeled up among my
treasures?

Vengeance is mine and I will reward: their fete shall slide, when the time
comes. For the time of their destruction is at hand, and the time that shall
come upon them makes have.

For the Lord will do justice unto his people, and have compassion on his
servauntes. For it shall be seen that their power shall fail, and at the last
they shall be presoned and forsaken.

And it shall be said: where are their gods and their rock wherein they
trusted?

The fatt of whose sacrifices they ate and drancke the wine of their
drynckofferynges, let them rise up and help you and be your protection.

Se now how that I, I am he, and that there is no God but I. I can kill and
make alive, and what I have smyten that I can heal: nether y^ there that can
deliver any man out off my hand.

For I will lift up mine hand to heaven, and will say: I live ever.

If I whett the lightening of my sword, and mine hand take in hand to do
justice, I will show vengeance on mine enemies and will reward them that
hate me.

I will make mine arowes dronke^ with blood, and my sword shall eat flesh of
the blood of the slain and of the captyue and of the bare heed of the enemy.

Rejoice hethen with his people, for he will avenge the blood off his
servauntes, and will avenge him off his adversaries, and will be merciful unto
the land off his people.

And Moses went and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the
people, both he and Joshua the son of Nun. And when Moses had spoken all these
words unto the end to all Israel, then he said unto them. Set your hertes
unto all the words which I testifye unto you this day: that ye command
them unto your childern, to observe and do all the words off this law. For
it is not a vain word unto you: but it is your life, and through this word
ye shall prolonge your days in the land whother ye goo over Iordayne to
conquer it.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses the self same day saying: get the up in to
this mountain Abarim unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over
agenst Jericho. And behold the land of Canaan which I give unto the childern
of Israel to possess. And dye in the mount which thou go upon, and be
gathered unto thy people: As Aaron thy brother dyed in mount Hor and was
gathered unto his people. For ye trespased agenst me among the childern of
Israel at the waters off striffe, at Cades in the wilderness of Zin: because
ye sanctified me not among the childern of Israel. Thou shall se the land
before the, but shall not goo thither unto the land which I give the childern
off Israel.

The.xxxiij. Chapter.
THis is the blessinge where with Moses gods man blessed the childern of Israel
before his deeth saying: The Lord came from Sinai and showed his beams from
Seir unto them, and appeared gloriously from mount Paran, and he came with
thousands of saints, and in his right hand a law of fire for them How loved
he the people? All his saints are in his hand. They yoyned the^ selves unto
thy foot and received thy words. Moses gave us a law which is the
enheritaunce of the congregation of Jacob. And he was in Israel king when he
gathered the heedes of the people and the tribes of Israel to gether.

Ruben shall live and shall not dye: but his people shall be few in number.

This is the blessing of Judah. And he said: hear Lord the voice of Judah and
bring him unto his people: let his hands fight for him: but he thou his help
agenst his enemies.

And unto Leui he said: thy perfectness and thy light be after thy merciful
man who^ thou temptest at Masa and with whom thou striuedst at the waters of
strife. He that says unto his father and mother. I saw him not, and unto his
brethern I knew not, and to his son I wot not: for they have observed thy
words and kept thy testament. They shall teach Jacob thy judgments and
Israel thy laws. They shall put cens before thy nose and whole sacrifices upon
thine altar. Bless Lord their power and accept the works of their hondes:
smite the backs of them that rise against them and of them that hate them: that
they rise not again.

Unto Ben Iamin he said: The Lords derlynge shall dwell in saffetye by him
and keep him self in the haven by him contynually, and shall dwell between his
shulders.

And unto Joseph he said: blessed of the Lord is his land with the goodly
fruits off heaven, with dew and with sprynges that lie beneth: and with fruits
of the increase of the son and with ripe srute off the months, and with the
tops of mountains that were from the beginning and with the dayntes of
hills that last ever and with goodly fruit of the earth and off the fullness
there of. And the good will of him that dwells in the bush shall come upon
the heed of Joseph and upon the top of the heed of him that was separated
fro among his brethern his bewtye is as a firstborne ox and his horns as the
horns of an unicorn. And with them he shall push the nations to gether, even
unto the ends of the world. These are the many thousands of Ephraim and the
thousands off Manasse.

And unto Zabulon he said: Rejoice Zabulon in thy goenge out, and thou Isachar
in thy tents. They shall call the people unto the hill, and there they shall
offer offerynges of righteousness. For they shall suck of the abundaunce of the sea and of treasure hyd in the sonde.

And unto Gad he said: blessed is the rowmmaker Gad. He dwells as a lion and
caught the arm and also the top of the heed He saw his beginning, that a
part of the teachers were hyd there and come with the heedes of the people,
and executed the righteousness of the Lord and his judgments with Israel.

And unto Dan he said: Dan is a lions whelpe, he shall flow from Basan.

And unto Nepthali he said: Nephali he shall have abundance of pleasure and
shall be filled with the blessinge of the Lord and shall have his possessions in
the southwest.

And of Asser he said: Asser shall be blessed with childern: he shall be
acceptable unto his brethern and shall dip his foot in oil: Yern and brass
shall hang on thy shows and thine age shall be as thy youth.

There is none like unto the God of the off Israel: he that sits upon
heaven shall be thine help, whose glory is in the clouds, that is the
dwellinge place of God from the beginning and from under the arms of the
world: he has cast out thine enemies before the and said: destroy. And
Israel shall dwell in saffetye alone. And the eyes of Jacob shall look appon a
land of corn and wine, moreover his heaven shall drop with dew. Happy art
thou Israel, who is like unto the? A people that art saved by the Lord thy
shilde and helper and sword of thy glory. And thine enemies shall hyde them
selves from the, and thou shall walk upon their hye hills.

The.xxxiiij. Chapter
ANd Moses went from the feldes of Moab up in to mount Nebo which is the top
of Pisga, that is over agenst Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land
off Gilead even unto. Dan, and all nephtali and the land of Ephraim and
Manasse, and all the land of Judah: even unto the utmost see, and the south and
the region of the plain of Jericho the city of datetrees even unto Zoar: And
the Lord said unto him. This is the lon de which I swear unto Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob saying: I will give it unto thy seed. I have showed it the before
thine eyes: but thou shall not goo over thither.

So Moses the servant of the Lord dyed there in the land of Moab at the
commaundment of the Lord. And he buried him in a valey in the land of Moab
beside Beeth Peor: but no man wist of his sepulcher unto this day. And Moses
was an hundred and.xx. ye re old when he dyed. and yet his eyes were not dym
nor his chekes abated. And the childern of Israel wept for Moses in the feldes
off Moab.xxx. days. And the days off weeping and morning for Moses were
ended.

And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom: for Moses had
put his hand upon him. And all the childe^n of Israel herkened unto him and
did as the Lord commanded Moses. But there arose not a prophett sense in
Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the miracles
and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egipte, unto Pharao
and all his servants and unto all his land: and in all the mighty deades
and great tereble things which Moses did in the sight of all Israel
