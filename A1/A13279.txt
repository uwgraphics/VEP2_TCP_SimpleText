LONDON, Printed for Thomas Jones and Laurance Chapman. 1620.

To the Worshipful, his most approved Friend, Mr. Robert Nicolson.
SIR, the kind welcome that you always daigne
To the fair Muses, and their favorites;
And chiefly me, the meanest of their train,
(Too mean to meddle with their sacred rites)*
My willing heart with thankful hand inuites,
To offer you my busie-idle pain,
Il-shapen shadows of my young delights,
Till better fruits my better Fates ordain.
Yet (pray you) private let this Gigge be kept;
Unworthy object for judicious eyes:
Which but for you, eternally had slept,
And, but to you, from henceforth ever dies:
But lack of better, forced me for a shift,
To bring you now this old new New-yeeres gift.
Semper Arcto-phylos.

To his divine Arctoa, her devout Arcto-phylos.
BEcause I count a promise ^^bt (my Dear)
Especially unto a special friend,
This promised pledge to your sweet self I send*
A gloom^e glass of your perfections clear*
A pourtraiture resembling nothing near
Your heavenly features, that in worth extend
Beyond the reach of my poor rymes commend,
As in this plot I make too plain appear.
Yet since for you amid my dumps I drew it,
And since your self have since desired to see it;
With mild aspect vouchsafe (bright-star) to view it.
To doom whereof, in your discretion beit:
But dee^e withal, that in this bitter story
I grave my griefs, and not your beauties glory.
Vincenti gloria Victi*
The Wood-mans Bear.
1.
Seventy nine skore years and seven
Were expired from the birth
Of a Babe, be got by Heaven,
To bring peace unto the Earth,
Peace that passes all esteeming,
Sinne-bound souls from Hell redeeming.
Ver. 2.
Phoebus in his yearly race
(Having past the Ram and Steer)
Now began to post apace,
Through the Twins fair houses clear,
Prancking in perfumed robes,
All these goodly nether Globes.
Aurora. 3.
And Aurora richly dight
In an azure mantle fair,
Freng'd about with silver bright,
Pearle-deaws dropping through the air,
Hung the gate with golden tissues,
Where Hiperions Chariot issues.
4.
At which sight (that all reioyoes)
All the cunning Forest Quyer,
Tuning loud their little voices,
Warbled who should warble higher:
Striving all to bear the Bell
(All in vain) from Phylomel.
5.
When my ioylesse senses dulled
With the busy toil of Cities,
Me from pensive fancies pulled,
To go hear their heavenly ditties:
To go hear, and see, and sent,
Sounds, sights, savors excellent.
6.
Wending then through Lawns and Thickets,
Where the fearful Dear do brouze,
Where the wanton Fawnes and Prickets,
Crop the top of springing boughs:
Where the Stag, and light-foot Hind
Skud, and skip, and turn, and wind.
7.
While I led my wandering feet,
Through a silent shady Grove,
Paued thick with Primrose sweet,
As mine eyes about did roue,
Near a spring I chanst to spy,
Where a wretched man did lie.
8.
Like a Wood-man was his weed,
Groueling on the grass he lay,
Mourning so as does exceed
All that ever I can say:
Beasts to bellow, birds to sing,
Ceast, to see so strange a things
9.
Wringing hands, and weeping eyes,
Heavy sighs, and hollow groans,
Wailing words, and woeful cries
Were the witness of his moanes:
Moanes, that might with bitter passion,
Move a flintie hearts compassion.
10.
Feign would I the cause have kend,
That could cause him so complain:
But I feared him to offend
With repeating of his pain;
Therefore I expected rather
From himself the same to gather.
11.
Sitting then in shelter shadie,
To observe and mark his moan,
Suddenly I saw a Lady
Hasting to him all alone,
Clad in Maiden-white and green:
Whom I judged the Forest Queen.
12.
Who the eager game pursuing,
Lost her Ladies in the chase,
Till she heard the wretches ruing,
Unto whom she hied apase;
Moving him with mild entreat.
To unsold his grief so great.
13.
When the Queen of Continence,
With the music of her words,
Had by sacred influence
Charmed the edge of sorrows swords:
Swords that deeper wound have made,
Then the keen Toledo blade.
14.
Feign he would, and yet he fainted
To unfold his fatal grief:
Passions in his face depainted,
Striving whether should be chief:
Thus at last, though loath and sorry,
Sighed he out his mournful story.
15.
Madam (quoth he) (yet he knew not
What she was), that you may see,
That I cursed causeless rue not,
Lend a while your care to me,
And you shall perceive the source,
Whence my cares have had their course.
16.
Whence my cares and sad incumbers
Have arisen and proceeded:
Whose account of countlesse numbers
Has the Oceans sand exceeded;
Whose extreme tormenting smart,
Passes all conceit of heart.
17.
Thrice-seuen summers I had seen
Decked in Floraes rich array;
And as many winters keen,
Wrapped in suits of silver gray:
Yet the Cirian Queens blind Boy
Crudged at my grieselesse joy.
18.
But when on my maiden chin
Mother Nature began engender
Smooth, soft, golden down, and thin
Blades of beuer, silke-like slender,
Then he finding fuel sit,
Sought for coals to kindle it.
19.
Coals he found, but found no fire,
For The East Frisian icie sky
Made the sparks of loves desire
Sudden borne, as soon to die:
Thus so long as there I bid
All was vain that Venus did*
20.
Seeing then that naught might boot,
She (consulting with her bastard)
Bid the busy wanton shoot:
But alas he durst not dastard,
In that quarter well he wist
Arms to meet with, me he mist.
21.
Therefore weary of his toil,
Hopeless still of better hap,
In that so unhappy soil,
Where few Brutes he could entrap:
He forsook the frozen Ems,
Soaring toward silver Thames.
22.
On whose lillie-paued bancks,
Where saire water nymphs resorted
Played he many wanton pranks,
While the silly damzels sported,
Wounding with his cruel darts,
Their unwary tender hearts.
23.
Chiefly in my Mother-Towne,
Where the Paragon of honor,
Virtues praise, and beauties crown,
With sweet Ladies tending on her,
Kept her Court in Palla^e royal,
Guarded by attendants loyal.
24.
There the Paphian Prince (perceiving
Lords and Ladies, young and old,
Apt (through ease) for Loves deceiving),
Sends about hi^ shafts of gold,
Striking all save her he dares not,
Dians self, the rest he spares not.
25.
Having triumphed there a season
Over all degrees and sexes,
Planting love, supplanting reason,
Where his darts dire venom vexes:
Suddenly he crossed the stood,
To the famous Seat of Lud.
26.
Finding there sufficient fuel,
To maintain his wanton fires,
By and by begins he cruel,
To inflame both Sons and Siers,
Maid and Mistress, Man and Master,
Dam and Daughter, light or chaster.
27.
Thus he tortures, void of pity,
Rich and poor, and fond and wise,
Through the streets of all the City:
Causing by his cruelties,
Sighing-singing, freezing-frying,
Laughing-weeping, liuing-dying.
28.
Fates by this time had contrived
Causes that me thither drew,
Which ere ever I arrived,
This detested Tyrant knew:
Wyling waiting time and place,
To revenge his old disgrace.
29.
Oftentimes he did attempt
Even in streets of second Troy,
To have punished my contempt,
By bereauing freedoms joy;
But unable there tomatch me,
Elsewhere yet he thought to catch-me.
30.
I was wont (for my disport)
Often in the Summer season,
To a Village to res^rt,
Famou^ for the rathe ripe Peason,
Where I en^^th a Plumb-tree shade,
Many pleasant walks I made.
31.
Till a grasse-borne-kricket mounted,
On that goodly Trees fair top,
Made his fore-fruit (rare accounted)
Ouer-soone to fall and drop:
Loading every branch and bow
With her brood of krickets now.
32.
Hither while I used to haunt,
Cupid seeking change gf harbor,
Leaving stately Troy-nouant,
Lighted under this fresh Arbor,
Near the hour when Titan wounds us,
Hides our shadows wholly vnder-vs.
33.
When the Dwarfting did perceive me,
Me Loves most rebellious skorner,
By some cautel to deceive me,
Skipt he soon into a corner:
Where left I should spy the Elfe,
In a Bear he hid himself.
34.
Many Beasts, and Birds beside,
Adorned with the pride of nature;
Fair of fether, rich of hide,
Trim of form, and tall of stature,
Used this Orchard to frequent,
Till the Summers heat was spent.
35.
But the Bear was my betrayer;
Nay, she was my lives defender:
But she was my freedoms slayer;
Nav, she was my thraldomes ender:
But she filled my soul with sadness;
Nay, she turned my grief to gladness.
36.
Blessed Bear that bears the bell
From the fairest of her kind:
Such a Bear as does excel
Those to either Pole assignd:
Such a Bear, as 'twold not grieve me,
To be Bearward made, believe me.
37.
In a Crof^e where Musickes King
(Making mends for Daphnes wrong)
Made out of the ground to spring
Trees transformed to Daphnes young:
In the Crofte so fair and pleasant,
Harbor of the Prince-dish Pheasant.
38.
Southward was this white Bear bred,
Yet not skorcht with Afric heat:
For her Dam had dipped her head
In the Crystal waters neat
Of a Spring called Hambarwell,
Which can Sunburned spots expel:
39.
And besides, while young she was,
She was carried from that coast,
To be taught such practice, as
Makes such beasts beloved most.
Beast am I to call her beast:
Yet indeed a Bear's a beast.
40.
Bear in name, but not in nature,
Was this much admired creature,
Per^erlesse piece of perfect stature,
Full of all desired feature:
Feature such, as all too saint,
My dull pen presumes to paint.
41.
Lovely Lilly-white she was,
Straight proportioned, stately-paced,
Coy, or kind (as came to pass)
Curteous-spoken, comely graced:
Graces seemed of graces lavish,
Eyes that gazed on her to ravish.
42.
Locks like streams of licquid Amber,
Smooth down dangling seemed to spread,
Hangings fit for Beauties chamber:
Curtins fit for Beauties bed:
Of which slender golden sleaue,
Love his wanton nets did weaue.
43.
Forehead fair as summers face,
Built upon two Ebene Arkes*
Under which in equal space
Stood two bright resplendant sparks:
Sparks excelling in their shine,
Fairest beams of Ericyne.
44.
From those Arkes, between these eyes,
(Eyes that arm Loves Archers tillar)
Even descending did arise,
Like a pale Piram^d pillar,
That fair dubble-doored port,
Where sweet Zephyr loves to sport.
45.
On each side whereof extended
Fields, wherein did ever grow
Roses, Lillies, Violets blended,
Steept in streams of sanguine snow:
Red-white hills, and white-red plains
Azure vales, and azure veins.
46.
Veins, whose saphir seas do slide
(Branch-wise winding in and out)
With a gentle flowing tide
All that Little World about,
Up and down, aloft and under,
To fill all this world with wonder.
47.
With her mouth I meddle not,
Nor with Echoes dainty mazes,
Left these hearing any jot
Mis reported of her praises,
That in forming it incense
To reprove my proud offense.
48.
But fond he that ouerskips
(Fearing fancies Had-I-wist)
Those smooth smiling lovely lips,
Which each other always kissed.
Sweetly swelling round like cherries,
Fragrant as our garden-berries.
49.
Lips like leaves of Damask Rose,
Joined just in equal measure,
Which in their sweet folds enclose
Plenteous store of precious treasure:
Treasures more then may be told,
Balm, and Pearls, and purest gold.
50.
Balm her breath, for so it smelt;
Pearls, those pales about the Park,
Where that golden Image dwelt,
Her pure tongue that most I mark:
Such a tongue, as with my tung
Never can enough be sung.
51.
Now remains of all this I^^
Only that white Iuorie Ball,
Dimpled with a cheerful smile,
Which the Cape of Love I call.
^den was this Island (Madam)
While I gazed, mine eye was Adam.
52.
Next he^ Swan-like neck I saw,
Then those spotless snowie mountains,
Which when Loves warm Sun shall thaw,
Shall resolve in Nectar fountains:
Twixt which mountains lies a valley,
Like Joues heavenly milken alley.
53.
What my Song should further say,
Art envying my delight,
(As the night conceales the day)
Shrowdes in shadows from my sight
Art that adds so much to others,
Here a world of beauties smothers.
54.
Yet not so, but that I saw,
As the Sun shines through the rack,
Smalling down by measures law,
Her straight comely shapen back:
Which though well it liked me,
Lest of all I longed to see.
55.
But her slender virgin Waste
Made me bear her girdle spite,
Which the same by day imbraste,
Though it were cast off at night;
That I wished, I dare not say,
To be girdle night and day.
56.
Left those hands that here I kiss,
As offended therewithal,
Rise to chastise mine amiss,
Though their rage be rare and small;
Yet God shield her praises singer,
Should offend her little finger.
57.
Yet I sear in much I shall,
For to say her hands are white,
Slicke and slender, fingers small,
Straight and long; her knockles dight
With curled Roses, and her nails
With pearle-muscles shining skailes.
58.
These are praises great, I grant;
But full often heard I before,
Many may like honors vant,
Such as these have many more:
Hers are such, as such are none,
Save that hers are such alone?
59.
For, if she had lived, when
Proud Arachne was alive,
Pallas had not needed then
To come down with her to strive:
Her fair fingers, finely fast
Had Arachnes cunning past.
60.
But when to the music choice
Of those nimble joints she marries
The Echo of her Angel-voice,
Then the praise and prize she carries
Both from Orpheus and Amphion,
Shaming Lynus and Arion.
61.
Here before her nimble feet
Fall we flat (mine humble muse)
To endeavor (as is meet)
All our errors to excuse:
For these are the beauteous bases
That support this frame of graces.
62.
Now, like as a Princely building,
Rare for Model, rich for matter,
Beautified without with guilding,
Fond beholders eyes to flatter,
Inwardly contains most
Both of cunning and of cost.
63.
So this frame, in framing which
Nature her own self excelled,
Though the outward walls were rich,
Yet within the same there dwelled
Rarest beauties, richest treasures,
Chief delights, and choicest pleasures.
64.
For within this curious Palace,
Among the Muses and the Graces,
Phebe chaste, and charming Pallas
Kept their Courts in sundry places,
Laws of virtue to enactize,
There proclaimed in daily practice.
65.
Here the Foster waxing faint,
Looked on the lovely Dame,
Sighing-saying, Gracious Saint,
Heere-hence all my sorrows cam^
Lady, pardon, if my song
Have detained ye ouer-long.
66.
Not your song you^ sorrows se^ne
Longer then I would (quoth she)
Yet, as yet I cannot deem
How ^our griefs with this agree:
For did this fair sight entrap ye,
This fair sight might make ye happy.
67.
Happy (me unhappy most)
(Then replide he) had I been,
Had my life or light been lost
Ere my sight that sight had seen;
Then had I not lived to languish
In this ease-lesse end-lesse anguish.
68.
But because you doubt (fair Dame)
How from such a heaven as this,
Full of every beauties flame,
Full of bounty, full of bliss,
Full of each delightful joy,
Could descend the least auoy.
69.
If you daigne attend I Will tell,
(As my feeble tongue will let me)
All misfortune that befell,
Though the thought thereof do fret me:
Madam, so your kindness moves me,
That to show you all behoues me:
70.
Therefore think upon (I pray)
What, when first my tale begun,
Was forespoken to bewray
Shifts of Cythereas son,
How, for fear I should have spide him
In a Bear the Vrchin hid him.
71.
Thence from, crafty Cupid shot
All the arrows of his quiver:
But my heart that yielded not,
Made them all in sunder shiuer:
Till he full of shame and sorrow,
Better bow and shafts did borrow.
72.
Borrow did he of that Bear,
Arms more apt to work my woe,
Stringing with her golden hair
Her fair brows, he made his bow:
Whence for shafts he shot likewise,
Beams of her keene-peircing cies.
73.
Of which Diamond-headed darts,
Beating hard my bosoms Center,
Whence resisting power departs,
Where but these, none else could enter:
Some abiding, some rebounded,
Wherewithal the Bear was wounded.
74.
Wounded was the gentle Bear,
With the weapons that she lent,
That she lent (alas) for fear,
Lest the Love God should her shent:
So we see, who lend their arms,
Often procure their proper harms.
75.
So did harmless she (alas)
That I ever must bemone,
Moan I must, for nueer was
Marble-hearted Mirmidon
But would moan, and morn, and melt,
To have seen the pain she felt.
76.
To have seen her pitious plaining,
To have heard her loud lamenting,
To have thought on her complaining,
To imagine her tormenting:
Eyes would weep, and ears would wunder,
Hardest heart would break in sunder.
77.
So mine eyes* mine ears, and heart,
Filled with waters, wonders, woes,
Drowned, deafned, dead in part,
Wel-nigh all their virtues lose
Every sense and all my reason
Fled, and faild me for a season.
78.
Here when this he had rehearsed,
Ere the rufull rest could follow;
So the fresh remembrance pierced,
That his voice waxt weak and hollow:
Bitter tears abundant dropping,
Drowned words their passage stopping.
79.
Words were turned to sighs and sobbing;
Inward griefs did inlie groan:
Hopeless heart with heavy throbbing,
Showed all signs of saddest moan.
Signs made moan, but voice was mum,
Small griefs speak, but great are dumb*
80.
Woe begun, and wondrous sorry
Was the Goddess to behold him,
Through repeating of his story
In so sad a fit to fold him:
Fearing further to provoke him,
Left new seaes of sorrow choke him.
81.
For as Sea-coales flame the faster,
When we cast cold water on them:
Or as Children under Master,
Morn the more, the more we moan them:
So the more she spoke, her speeches
More increast his cries and skreeches.
82.
Yet she would not so forsake him,
Left some savage hungry beast
In this tragic trance should take him,
Of his flesh to make a feast:
Danger of which dire event,
Thus her pity did prevent.
83.
Loud her bugle Horn she blew,
Babbling Echo voice of valleys,
Aierie Else, exempt from view,
With the Forest music dallies:
Doubling so the curled wind,
That the first was hard to find:
84.
Yet her nimble Nvmphs inured
Often to the Fairies guile,
Could not be so soon allured
To ensu her subtle wile:
For where first they heard the blast,
Thither ward they trip it fast.
85.
But because these maids had followed
Egerly their game together;
They when first their Lady hollowed,
Could not by and by be with her:
For before she sound the Foster,
All her train (I told ye) lost her.
86.
In came these bright beauties than,
Where as they their Lady found
Standing by this wretched man,
That lay there upon the ground:
With which woeful sight amazed,
Each on him with wonder gazed.
85.
To whom their Goddess did relate
All before that he had told her,
All his miserable state:
Who did all the while behold her
With a heavy half shut eye
As a man at point to die.
88.
At which the Nymphs with pity moved,
Somewhat to assuage his woe
For the Bears sake whom he loved,
And that him had loved so,
Bad him of their help assure him,
For they could the Art to cure him.
89.
For in a Grove thereby, there grew
An herb which could loves power expel:
Which (but they) none ever knew,
As how it prospered near a well,
Where Diana used to bathe her,
When the scorching heat did scath her.
90.
Which the Siluans of those Groves
Held in very high account:
For therewith they (...) their loves*
It was called Diana^s Fount,
And that Herb, the pride of Summer,
Took that special virtue from her.
91.
And the swiftest of the train,
Away to fetch the same was sent,
Which her nimble joints did strain,
And returned incontinent,
And the simple with her brought,
By which the cure was strangely wrought.
92.
Which unto the sense applied
As the juice thereof he tasted,
He might ^eele even in that tide
How his old remembrance wasted
By the medicine thus revealed,
Was the woeful Wood-man healed.
Epithalamion.
O You that on the double mountain dwell,
And daily drink of the Castalian Well;
If any Muse among your sacred number,
Have power to waken from a dying slumber;
A dull conceit, drowned in a gulf of grief,
In hapless ruin, hopeless of reliese:
Vouchsafe (sweet sisters) to assist me so,
That for a time I may forget my woe,
Or (at the least) my sad thoughts so beguile,
That sighs may sing, and tears themselves may smile;
While I in honor of a happy choice,
To cheerful Lays tune my lamenting voice;
Making the mountains and the valleys ring,
And all the young men and the maideus sing,
All earthly joys and all heavens bliss betide
Our joyful Bridegroom, and his gentle Bride.
The^ peace complaint, and pack thee hence proud sorrow,
I must go bid my merry Greeks good morrow:
Good morrow Gallants: thus begins our game:
What? fast asleep? fie sluggards, fie for shame,
For shame shake off this humor from your eyes*
You have ouerslept: it is more then time to rise*
Behold, already in the ruddy East
Bright Ericyna with the beaming crest,
Calls up Aurora, and she rose-like blushing,
From aged Tythons cold arms, quickly rushing,
Opens the wide gates of the welcome day,
And with a beck summons the Sun away,
Who quickly mounting on his glistering chair,
Courseth his nimble Coursers through the air,
With swifter pace then when he did pursue
The Laurel changed Nymph that from him flew:
Fearing perhaps (as well he might) to miss
A rarer object, then those loves of his.
Such, as at sight (but for the kind respect
Of loyal friendship, to a dear elect
Child of the Muses) had with hotter fire
Inflamed the wanton Delphian Gods desire,
Altars adorned with blisse-presaging lights
In saffron roabes, and all his solemn rites
Thrice-sacred Hymen shall with smiling cheer hands,
Unite in one, two Turtles loving dear:
And chain with holy charms their willing
Whose hearts are linckt in loves eternal bands.
Mild virtues mirror, Beauties monument.
Adorned with heavens praise, and with earths perfection:
Receive (I pray you) with a brow unbent,
This petty pledge of my poor pure affection.
Had I the Indians golden heaps and hoordes,
A richer present would I then present you.
Now such poor fruits as my bare field affoordes
In stead of those, here ^aue I rudely sent you:
Count not the gifts worth, but the giuers will:
Often mighty Princes have accepted small things;
Like as the air all empty parts does fill,
So perfect friendship does supply for all things.
Obe it ever so: so never smart
Nor teene shall trouble the Soon calm in heart.
Mind first your Maker in your days of youth:
Ask grace of him to govern well your ways*
Reverence your Husband with unspotted truth:
Take heed of pride the poison of our days:
Hant not with those that are of light report:
Avoid the vile charms of unchaste temptation.
Never lend look to the lascivious sort:
Impeach not any's honest reputation:
Comfort the poor, but not beyond your power:
Over your household have a needful care:
Lay hold on Times lock, loose not any hour:
Spend, but in season: and in season spare:
Offspring of any heaven vouchfafe to send you,
Nurture them godly; and good end attend you.
So shall your life in blessings still abound,
So from all harm the almighty hand shall shend you,
So with clear honor shall your head be crowned,
So for your virtue shall the wise commend you,
So shall you shun vile slanders blasting voice,
So shall you long enjoy your loving Pheare,
So shall you both be blessed in your choice,
So to each other be you ever dear:
O! be it ever so in every part,
That naught may trouble the Soon calm in heart.
FINIS.
