The declaration of Alexander Seyton.
GOOD people /
so it is / that upon sunday / the.xiiii. day of November last past / I
Alexander Seyton a Scottysshe man borne having ben here to fore greatly
suspected / noted and infamed of heresy / and erroneous opinions / and for the
same / conuentyd before diverse Ecclesiastical judges of this Realm / made
within the parysshe church of saint Anthonynes (within the city and diocese
of London) a sermon in the morning of the said sunday / before a great
multitude / without any license of my Lord bishop of London / or any his
officers and contrary to their minds and commandment / taking for the ground
of my sermon the epistle of that day / extracted out of the first chapter
written to the Philippians I nothing spekyng in that morning sermon / either
of Fre will / or choice of man with his reconciliacyon / or iustificacyon /
nether yet else of good works or meryt / or value there of / Albeit I had good
and just occasyon so to do / by reason of the said Epistle. And moreover that
sermon done / I came immediately hither to the sermon made in this place / by a
well learned man and doctor of divinity / in the vniuersyte of Oxforth) and
herd all the same / well notyng and markyng his process made upon the said
epistle / especially touching Fre will or choice of man / with his
reconsylyacio^ or justification / and also the praise of good works / and the
meryttes and value thereof / than and there openly declared / and I was in deed
in my mind not right well contented with the said sermon and greatly offended
with the same. For as much as touching Fre will or Choice and iustifycation /
or reconsylyation of man to god me thought as than the said precher gane to
much unto man / and did withdraw to much from gods grace and touching good
works and the meryt and value thereof As than me thought he did over much
value and esteem the same / and being so offended / I the same day at after
none within the said church of saint Antonyues be fore a great multitude then
and there assembled (without any lycens of my seid lord of London or any his
officers / and contrary to their minds and commandments / yea and without
any showing of any other lycens at all / of a set purpose and to the intent the
people there assembled should not agree to the mind and declaracyon of the said
precher / but utterly dissent / vary / and clearly dysagree from all the same)
did make an other sermon directed contrary in points and artycles before said /
unto the sermon of the said precher / the people taking occasion there by to be
in discord varyete and diversity of opinions amongst them selves / and there
by not unlike to fall into further in conuenyens and busynes. Wherefore now I am
right heavy / sorry / and greatly repentaunt / trusting in the mercy of God / to
use here after a more modesty discretion and temperans in my prechyng / and to
avoid such rash and hasty passions and sudden affections and judgment / and
only to cleue unto the troth and Catholyke determynacyons of our holy mother
the Church.

And more over ye shall understand good people / that as I was denounced
detected and presented / so also I confess it is evidently proved against me
by suffycient witness brought in there upon / that in my said second sermon
than and there made at after none / I did contrary to good doctrine and lernyng
/ utter / prech / and declare amongst diverse other things.ii. things
chefely / that were very erronyouse / that is to wit / that a man has no
lybertye or Frewyll at all to do my thing that is virtuous and good and also
that good works did nothing at all help or were merytorious toward our
salvation or iustificacion. And all be it my lord bishop of London / justly
might for the same mine offenses so committed within his jurisdiction / have
compelled me / according to the Ecclesiastical laws of this Realm to abjure
and also might have extremly punyshed me for the same offenses / as in such
cases here to fore has been a customed / yet such is his charity / gentylnes /
and goodness toward me / desyryng only my reformacyon and amendeme^t with your
satisfaccion / that he for certain causes and honest consideracions him
mouynge / have been and is contented with this only pen aunce / (that is to
say) That I make here this open declaracyon unto you of my said offenses / and
that I do not here after prech or teach any such thing again / or any other
thing that shall be against the catholyke faith of our holy mother the church /
but as much as can lie in my power / to maintain / defend and auaunce the
said faith and utterly to detest and forsake all and all manner of heresies /
errors and noughty opynions with the favorers / mayntayners / defenders / or
abbeters of them / or any of them / during my life / which now I so promise
and declare also unto you / that I will do effectually. And for both your
better understanding / and also for mine own declaracyon here in / and to the
intent ye may know / that mine opinion is even as the opinion is of the
catholyke church and no otherwise. He shall understand that I do verily believe
and plainly confess / that a Christen man not destytute of gods grace has
lyberte / Frewyl and choice to do good / and also of him self without Gods
grace / has lybertye to consent to evil / and to do it in deed. Item that all
things good and bad / are not to be ascribed unto a fynall destynye /
predestinacyon / or foreknowledge of God / as the very cause thereof / ne yet
to an absolute or prestyse necessyte or co^pulcyon that can not be avoided /
which in times past has been a lewd opynion / and a damnable heresy holden of
many. Item that things which be evil / are to be ascribed to our selfs / who
wyllyngly and wyttynglye do consent and agree unto them. where assysted with
gods grace / being ever ready at hand we might sufficiently have avoided and
made resystence unto them / if we had would. Item that such good works as we
do with the help of gods grace are by scripture truly called our good works
/ as wrought by us by the strength of Gods grace and concurrence of our
frewyll. And al be it we not only of humylyte / but also for confession of the
troth / do ascrybe them to god as by riches of whose mercy we have both grace
and frewyll / wherewith to work yet nevertheless god to set forth the troth
of excellence of the lyberty of our frewyl wroughte by him in Christ / by who^
we are delivered calls in his scripture. also truly those good works done by
good men / their works as truly done by them made able and strengthened by god
so to do and therefore such fantasys as has been spread abroad / and entered into
rude men's ears as though god should work in man and the works to be only
Gods / and man only an instrument to work by / or a vessel to work in / is
pernycyous detestable and to be abhorred / for such places of scripture as
speak of gods workynge in us are to be understood as they may agree with the
rest of scripture / wherein be innumerable places to declare / that god makes
his servants in Christ so rych as they may by the plenty and strength there
of / be good trees and bring forth fruit and work. And as Christ said / Qui
credit in me / opera que ego facio / faciet et maiora horum faciet. which saint
Austyn writing on the same place very fieth to be spoken of a sinner in his
iustificacyon. And moreover I do likewise believe and confess / that the good
works of a Christen man be by gods will / ordering them to be done / and his
acceptyon merytorious / and a mean or helping toward remission of our sins
and unto our saluacynu. yea further I say and believe that all though our
savior and redemer Jesus Christ sent by God the father to fulfill his will /
has according unto the same by his life and passion in earth appesed the wroth
of god toward man sufficientlye and purchased for man great favor and fredom
/ whereby he may be able to please God obtain remyssion of sins / and do such
works as God of his goodness will reward with eternal life* yet we must know
and understand that according to the teaching of Christ declaryng the word
of God unto us / all those shall by the mean of Christ only be delivered from
gods anger that come to Christ and in faith both profess his truth /
receyuynge the Sacrament of Baptyme / and also works such good works to
fulfill gods will as time and occasyon does permyt the^ to work / for in these
only / god is pleased / for Christ as scripture says / and to these only is
promised everlasting life / and therefore such vain opynions as has entered
percase into the hedes of some ignorant people in the estymacion of men's good
works that the same may be accounted no manner of help to salvation / or
remyssion of sins / lest thereby we should make.ii. menes or.ii. saviors where
as in deed scriptur speaks but of one mean and savior. This fond fear I
say is to be removed and taken away by knowledge of troth / which testifies
/ that by works of penance we come to Christ / when we being prevented by god
and called are by the fire of charity which god kyndleth in us / such as come
at his calling / and believe in him joined in Christ's mystycall body / and
made one with him / and so by his mean he being the only head / we begin here a
heavenly life / and shall finally enjoy it in him our only savior Jesus Christ
/ in whom we here work the will of god / and therefore our works be not
another mean / or another sanyour / but wrought in Christ by the grace
purchased of god by Christ and by him required of us / not as any other
strange thing or seed to supply any imperfection in him which were blasphemye
and madness to be thought or said / but because it is the will of god who has
for our profit ordained the regeneracio^ of man / in this wise / which can not
be but the best without discussio^ and because it is / his will is the best and
so to be followed and observed of all that have hope in their calling / to
enjoy gods promysses made only to those that fulfill his will / which my
saynges and opinyons in these points especyall I do proteste even from the
botom of my heart / that I do believe they are true. Eue^ as now I have declared
them unto you and that also in all my sermons and teachynges here after I will
and entend after the same sort to declare and utter them unto the people and
none otherwise.

Ita est Alexander Seyton manu propria.

Here begins the declaracyon made the fourth sunday in Aduent / the year of
our lord god a thousand v. hundredth. xli by master Wyllyam Tolwyn / person of
saint Anthonines in the city of London.
GOOD people /
so it is / that I Wyllyam Tolwyn / master of Art / and person of saint
Anthonynes within this Tyte and Dyocese of London / have been laufully denounced
/ detected and presented to my Lord bishop of London / that I have been and am
a man vehemently suspected / noted and enfamed of heresy and erronyous /
heretycall and sedicyouse opynyons against the Catholyke faith of our holy
mother the church / and also a great favorer / defender / maynteynour and
receptour of heretykes / accustomed also to have in my custody / books of
heresy / and other unlawful works forbidden by the kings majesty's
proclamations and ordinances / and also contrary to the decree and inhthytion
of mine Ordynary. And moreover that I have not a customed to observe and keep
the laudable ceremonies / rytes and customs of this catholyke church of
England / comenly observed and kept by other. that is to say / neither in
going of Processyon upon saturdays at Euynsonge / nor in the usage and manner of
making of holy water and holy bred / nor in making my confession or saying of
Mass / Matens or Euynsonge / as I should and ought to have done.: Which
denunciation / detectyon and presentation has been partly by my nowne
confession and partly by sufficient wytnes and record in that behalf
suffyciently proved.

And albeit for mine offense in so doing I knowledge to have deserved no small
punishment. yet I have found such charytable goodness and mercy in my Lord
bishop of London / upon my submissio^ and suit unto him / that upon only this
declaration here made of my offeus unto you / with promise that I will endeuer
my self to the best of my power to live as a Catholyke man ought and should do
hereafter: And that I do not hereafter preach or teach any Heresies / Errors
or noughtye opinyons / contrary and against the Catholyke faith of our holy
mother the Church / but as much as can lie in my power to maintain / defend
and auaunce the said Catholyke faith and utterly to detest / abhor and avoid
all and all manner of Heresies / Errors and noughty opinyons / with the
favorers / mayntaynours / defendours or abbeters of them or any of the^
during my life / his lorshyp is content to respyt the rest of my penance /
and upon my good deseruynge and doing according to my said promise to forgive
all together / besechyng therefore you that be my fryndes to give him most herty
thanks for the same / and to take example by me to avoid the like danger.

Here after follows the names of the books / which the said person of s.
Anthonines was detected and presented with.
GOod people /

and Old castle / the Old god and the New / Rydleys comentaryes upon saint
Poule to the Ephesia^s / Venatorious upon Timothe / Swyn glyus of gods
