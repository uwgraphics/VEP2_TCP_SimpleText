shop in the Bulwark, near the Tower of London. 1616.

To my Christian Auditors at S. Katharines near the Tower, increase of all
saving graces.
CHristian Auditors, though among all the parts of Gods service, which we are
bound to perform, there are none more excellent, nor more honorable, then the
worthy receiving of his holy and blessed Supper: yet it is fearful and
lamentable to see, how much it is generally abused and profaned in the world.
Some are ignorant, and understand nothing at all of the true use of the
Sacrament. As our Savior Christ said to the woman of Samaria, John 4.22
Ye worship that which ye know not: so it may be truly said to many at this
day, They receive that which they know not. They have no judgment to discern
the Lords body, and therefore they rush upon these holy Mysteries without any
reverence. Others are notoriously wicked, holding their sins in their right
hand. Ierem. 7.9, 10
They will steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely etc. As the
Prophet says, and yet think they may come and stand before God in his house:
Matthew. 7.6
and though in the sight of God, they be no better then filthy dogs and
swine: yet they will presume to sit as guests at his Table. Others again there
are, that have both knowledge and grace in some measure, and yet for want of
due preparation, come many times to the Lords Supper, without that reverence
that is required.

For the reforming of all these abuses, I have in your hearing handled in many
Sermons, the Doctrine of this Sacrament, as the Apostle has set it down. And
for the help of those that are ignorant, I have drawn the sum of all that
was publicly taught, into short Questions and Answers, which here I commend
unto you, as an unfeigned testimony of my love. I confess I owe much unto you,
for the great kindness which I daily receive at your hands. For as you
entertained me at my first coming with a general consent: 2 Cor. 8.3
so I bear you record, that to your power, yea and many of you, beyond your
power, are willing to give me better maintenance (considering the poverty of
the place) then many richer Parishes about the City do afford. All that I
can do, is to continue my pains among you, as I have begun so long as it
shall please God. And I desire you all to labor together in prayer for me,
that I may with all faithfulness fulfill the Ministry that I have received
of the Lord. Coloss. 4.17.
Thus hoping you will accept this small gift of mine, with the same affection
that I offer it, I commend you all to the grace of God, beseeching him, to make
your hearts stable and unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints.

Yours in the Lord, CHARLES RICHARDSON.

A. 1. That none has power to make Sacraments, but Christ only.

Que. What resemblance is there between the Bread and the Body of Christ? 1
Cor. 10.16


A. 1. Heb. 5.8, 9
As bread is baked in the Oven by the heat of the fire: so the body of Christ,
being as it were baked in the fire of the Cross, is made the bread of life.

2. Matthew. 11.28 Jeremy 29.13
As bread is most easily gotten of all food: so Christ is easily found of all
that truly and seasonably sake him.

Q. Why did our Savior Christ make choice of bread, rather then of flesh to

so the blood of Christ sprinkled upon the heart, does comfort the soul of
every believer.

Christ has annexed to the Cup. Matthew. 26.28


Q. What are the actions to be performed in the administration of these signs?

A. Some of them were performed by Christ, and are now to be performed by the
Minister: and some by the Disciples to be done by the receivers.

Q. What are the actions to be done by the Minister?

A. They are three.

Q. What is the first of them?

A. To take the bread and wine, and to bless the same.

Q. What mean you by that?

1 Timothy 4.5 1 Samuel 9.13
A. By prayer to separate them, that they may be sacramental bread and wine.

Q. What does this action signify?

Elect.

Q. How was Christ set apart to this work?

A. Three ways.

Q. Which are they?

1 Pet. 1.20 Galat. 4.4 Matt. 3.16, 17
A. 1. In Gods eternal decree. 2. In his incarnation. 3. In his baptism.


Q. What does this action admonish us?

Romans 12.1 Pro. 23.26
Ans. That we must likewise set our selves apart to his service.

Qu. What is the second action to be done by the Minister?

A. To break the bread, and to power out the Wine.

Q. What does this action signify?

Esaias 53.4, 5 1 Pet. 2.24 Matt. 20.28
A. That Christ his body was broken with sorrow, and his blood shed upon the
Cross for our sins.

Q. What does it admonish us?

Que. What is the third action to be done by the Minister?

A. To give the bread and wine to every particular receiver.

Q. What does this action signify?

Ans. That God does likewise give Christ Jesus with all his merits to every
true believer. John 3.16


Q. What does it admonish us?

A. 1. 1 Cor. 6.20 1 Pet. 1 17, 18, 19
That we must wholly give our selves back again to Christ

2. That we must be willing for Christ his sake to give somewhat to the relief
of our poor brethren. 1 John 3.17 and 4 11


Q. What words did our Savior Christ use in administering these signs?

A. Words of promise concerning the Bread and the Cup.

Q. What are he words concerning the Bread?

A. This is my body which is broken for you.

Quest. What is the meaning of these words?

Genesis 17, 10, 11 and 41.26, 27 Exudus 1^.13 1 Cor. 10.4
A. This bread is a sign to represent, and a seal to seal unto you my body,
with the benefits of my passion suffered in the same.

Q. What may we learn from thence?

A. The great goodness of God to his Church, that has not only given us his
word and promises: but for the better strengthening of our faith, has also
given us his Sacraments, to seal the same unto us.

Q. Is not the bread really turned into the body of Christ, after these words
be pronounced by the Priest?

A. No, by no means.

Q. Why so?

A. 1. Because it overthrows the nature of the Sacrament.

Q. How prove you that?

A. Because in every Sacrament there must be these two things: the sign, and
the thing signified. But if the bread cease to be bread, and be turned into the
body of Christ, then the Sacrament has lost his outward Sign.

Q. Why else?

A. Because it is plain in the text, that our Savior Christ took the bread
and wine into his hand: he brake the one, and powered out the other, and did
himself eat and drink the same. Now none of all these can be true of the
real body and blood of Christ.

Q. Why else?

An. Because the Bread is called the Communion of the body of Christ: 1 Cor.
10.16
therefore it is not his body it self.

Q. Why else?

A. Because the Apostle calls it bread still after the consecration, to teach
us, 1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28
that the substance of bread remains.

Q. Why else?

A. Because diverse absurdities would otherwise follow.

Q. What are they?

A. 1. Matthew. 28.6 Acts 1.9, 11 and 3.21
That Christ's body should be in many places at once, which is contrary to the
nature of a true body.

Q. What else?

A. That Christ should have two bodies: one borne of the Virgin Mary, and
another made of the bread.

Q. What else?

Ans. That we should not in the Lords Supper receive the body of Christ, that
was crucified for us, but an other body made by the Priest.

Que. But may not this be done by a miracle?

A. No.

Q. Why so?

An. 1. Because Miracles are ceased: neither have the Priests now any promise
thereof.

Exodus 4.3, 4 John 2.7, 8, 9
2 Because in every Miracle there is a visible and sensible change. But here is
no such thing we see, and feel, and taste bread still, as we did before.

3. Because Miracles, though they be beyond and above nature, yet they are not
against nature to overthrow it as this does, in making the finite body of
Christ to be in many places at once.

4. Because a Miracle is an extraordinary work of God, belonging to certain
times and persons. But the Sacraments are for all times, and for the whole
church.

Q. But can not God by his omnipotency do this?

An. We are not in this case to respect what God can do, but what he will
do: now he has not any where revealed that he will do this, and therefore we
are not to believe it.

Q. What are the words concerning the Cup?

A. This Cup is the new Testament in my blood, which is shed for you, Matt.
26.28 Luke 22.20
and for many for the remission of sins.

Que. What is the meaning of these words?

A. The Cup, that is, the wine in the Cup which I offer unto you, is a pledge
and seal of my Testament, to establish and confirm the same.

Q. What is meant by the word Testament?

Answ. Either a Covenant or a last Will.

Q. How many kinds of Covenants is there?

Ans. Two: the covenant of Works, and the covenant of Grace.

Q. What is the covenant of Works?

A. It is a compact of perfect obedience to the will of God, Leuit. 18.5
upon condition of eternal life if it be obeyed, and of eternal death if it
be not obeyed.

Q. Is any man able to keep this covenant?

Romans 3.23
Ans. No, for all have sinned, and are are deprived of the glory of God.

Q. What is the covenant of grace?

Ier. 31.31, 32, 33
A. It is a compact of mutu^ll reconciliation between God and man, in and
through Christ Jesus.

Q. Wherein consists that?

Jeremy 31.34
A. 1. In a gracious promise of remission of sins, and everlasting life on Gods
part.

Mark 1.15
2. In faith in Gods promises, and repentance on man's part.

Qu. What resemblance is between this Covenant, and a last will or Testament?

A. 1. As he that makes the Testament, has no benefit by it himself: so
Christ no benefit by this Covenant, but all redoundeth to the Church.

Q. What else?

Heb. 9.16, 17.
Ans. 2. As a Testament is never of force till the Testator be dead: so this
covenant was made effectual by the death of Christ.

Q. Why is it called a new Testament?

A. To distinguish it from the old Testament, that was made with the Fathers
before Christ.

Qu. Was not the covenant of Grace in the Law, the same that is in the Gospel?

Ans. Yes: For substance, and in respect of all the causes it was one and the
same.

1. Deuteronomy. 9.5 2 Timothy ^.9
The efficient cause of both is the mere mercy of God, without any respect of
works.

2. The matter of both is Christ, Genesis 3.15 and 12.3 2 Cor. 5.19 Heb. 13.8
Apoc. 13, 8 Heb. 11. tot Rom 4.23, 24 Heb. 11.9, 10, 13 Genesis 47.9 Number 23 to
Psalm. 116.15.
without whom no man is received into Gods favor.

3. The formal cause of them both is faith.

4. The end whereunto they bother cited men, is eternal life.

Quest. How then do they differ one from another?

A. 1 The promises in the old Testament, were for the most part of temporal
blessings, but the promises in the new Testament, are of spiritual.

2. In the old Testament there were many ceremonies and sacrifices, burdensome
and costly: in the new Testament there are but a few, and they light and easy.

Matthew. 11.13 Heb. 11.13 John 1.29 Galat. 3.1
3. In the old Testament, all things were delivered obscurely, in Types and
Figures: but in the new Testament, the mystery of our salvation is plainly
and openly revealed.

John 7.38, 39 Acts 2.17 Ierem. 31.14
4. There is ordinarily a greater measure of the graces of Gods Spirit in the
New Testament, then there was in the Old.

Deuteronomy. 32.8, 9 Matthew. 10.5, 6 Mark 16.15 Acts 10.15, 34 Romans 3.29 Ephesians. 2.14,
15
5. The New Testament is made known to more people then the old was. For that
was only known to the Jews, but this is published to all nations.

6. In the old Testament Christ was only promised, 1 Pet. 1.20 2 Timothy 1.9, 10
but in the new Testament he is exhibited.

Quest. Why was it necessary that the blood of our Savior Christ should be
shed?

Ans. 1. Because it was figured in the old Testament, in the Paschall Lamb,
and in the Sacrifices.

Leuit. 17.11. Heb. 9.22.
2. That he might make his sacrifice perfect and sufficient.

Q. Why does he not say, This is my body of the new Testament, as well as,
This is my blood etc.

Ans. Because although the new Testament be established by the offering up of
whole Christ: John 19.34
yet his death was more manifest, in the sheding of his blood, then in the
sufferings of his flesh.

Q. What commandment did our Savior annex unto these words?

A. Do this in remembrance of me.

Qu. What remembrance of Christ is commanded here?

Ans. Not an historical remembrance, such as is in the Devil, nor a bare and
idle remembrance, as if it did not appertain unto us: but an effectual
remembrance, whereby we do apprehend and apply Christ with all his benefits
to our selves by faith: and so call to mind his sacrifice, as by it we may
conceive present comfort in our consciences, and assured hope of everlasting
life.

Q. What are the actions that were performed by the Disciples, and must be
performed by every receiver?

A. They are two.

Q. What is the first?

A. To take the bread and wine at the hands of the Minister.

Q. What does this action signiffe?

A. That in like manner we must receive Christ Jesus into our hearts by a true
and lively land. John 1.12. and 6.35


Q. What does it admonish us?

Psalm. 24.7, 8 Ephe. ^.17. Apoc. 3.^0
A. To prepare and cleanse our hearts for the rec^^uing of so honorable a
guest.

Q, What is the second action?

An. To ease the bread and drink the wine.

Q. What does this action signify?

1 Cor. 10.16 Ioh. 17.21. Ephe. 5.30
A. The union and communion which we have with Christ.

Q. What is this union?

John 6.56.
A. It is a consolating of our persons with the person of Christ.

Q. What a manner of union is it that we have with Christ?

Ans. Not corporal and bodily, but spiritual and supernatural, yet real and
true.

Q. By what means is it wrought in respect of Christ?

Ephesians. 4.16
Ans. By his Spirit: whereby all the faithful are knitte unto Christ, as the
members of the body by joints and sinews are coupled to the head.

Quest. By what means is it wrought in respect of us;

Galat. 2.20
Ans. By a particular application of Christ and his merits to our own souls.

Q. What does it admonish us of?

A. Of that Christian concord and fellow his that ought to be among the members
of Christ. Romans 12.5 and 15.5, 6, 1 Cor. 1.10 Acts 4.32 Esaias 11.6,


Q. What arguments are there in the administration of the Lords Supper to
persuade us thereunto?

Ans. 1. 1 Cor. 10.17
Because we all do eat of one Bread and all drink of one Cup.

2. Because many grains of wheat do make one loaf of bread, and many grapes
make one cup of wine.

Quest. What is the end of the Lords Supper?

A. To show forth the death of Christ till he come.

Q. How must we show forth the death of Christ?

Ans. Two ways: in speech, and in action.

Q. How in speech?

Ans. By giving thanks to God for the great benefit of our redemption. Psalm
116.12 Luke 1.68


Q. How in action?

Ans. 1. 2 Cor. 4.10 Galat. 6.14.
By suffering crosses and afflictions for Christ his sake.

2. Romans 6.4.
By feeling the power of Christ's death, in killing our corruptions and sins.

Quest. Why does the Apostle in the next place set down the right use of the
Lords Supper?

Ans. To teach us, that the ordinances of God must not be separated from their
holy use.

Quest. What order does the Apostle observe in setting down hereof?

An. First, he shows the abuse of the Lords Supper, and then the remedy of it.

Quest. What is the abuse of the Lords Supper?

Answer. To eat and drink unworthily.

Q. Who do eat and drink unworthily?

Ans. Not only such as are altogether unworthy to come, but even they also,
who being worthy, do not come as they ought.

Quest. Who are they that are altogether unworthy?

Ans. There are some without the Church, and some in the Church.

Quest. Who are they that are without the Church?

Ans. All Turks, Jews, Pagans, Exodus 12.48
and Infidels.

Quest. Who are they that are within the Church?

Ans. 1. All that are grossly ignorant, though they live never so ciuilly.

2. All gross sinners, Matthew. 7.6 and 15.26
though they have never so much knowledge.

3. All hypocrites.

Quest. Who are they that may be said to be worthy to come?

Ans. All the faithful, Luke 22:30
who for the merits of Christ are counted worthy.

Que. How may these come unworthily?

Ans. When as not considering the excellency of the Lords Supper, nor
seriously examining themselves, either through ignorance or negligence, they lie
in some sin without sufficient repentance.

Que. What is the danger of unworthy receivers?

An. 1. They make themselves guilty of a grievous sin.

2. They become liable to a fearful judgment.

Quest. What is the sin whereof they are guilty?

Ans. They are guilty of the body and blood of Christ.

Q. How so?

Ans. Because the disgrace done to the signs of Christ his body and blood,
redoundeth to himself.

Que. What is the judgment whereunto they are liable?

Ans. They eat and drink damnation to themselves.

Q. What is meant by damnation?

Luke 23.40 1 Pet. 4.17.
Ans. Not the second death, but temporal correction.

Quest. How prove you that is taken so here?

1 Cor. 1.2. and 6.11 Romans 8.1.
Ans. Because the Apostle threatens it to the Corinthians, who were justified
and sanctified, and therefore not subject to damnation.

Q. Why does the Apostle say he eats and drinks judgment to himself?

A. To teach us, that the unworthiness of any man hurts none but himself.

Qu. What reason gives the Apostle of this?

Ans. Because he discerns not the Lords body.

Qu. What is to discern the Lords body?

Ans. To distinguish these Elements, being signs of Christ's most precious body
and blood from all other things, and to use them with that reverence and
deuotition that is meet.

Quest. Why is the body of Christ to be accounted of so precious and excellent?

Ans. 1. Because of the exeltation of it, being ready united to the Deity.

2. Because of the merit of his sufferings in it, whereby he has procured for
us eternal life.

3. Because of the efficacy thereof in mortifying of our corruptions.

Qu. Who are they that do not discern the Lords body?

Ans. 1. Ignorant Christians, who put no difference between the bread of the
Sacrament and common bread: but come to the Lords table as to an ordinary feast.

2. They that have knowledge of the Mystery, and yet do not come with due
consideration of the dignity thereof.

Q. What remedy does the Apostle prescribe for preventing of this sin, and
for avoiding of this judgment?

Ans. That every man try and examine himself.

Que. What does that teach us?

2 Cor. 13.5
Ans. That every man must have discretion to judge of his own estate: or else
he is not fit to come to the Lords Table.

Quest. By what rule must we try our selves?

Ans. By the rule of Gods Law, examining our selves by every commandment
thereof. Psalm. 119.59.


Quest. What must be the matter of our trial?

Ans. Whether we be fit guests for Gods table, or no.

Quest. How many things are required to make us fit?

Ans. Fine things especially.

Que. What is the first?

Ans. Knowledge.

Quest. What knowledge is required in this case?

Ans. A general and a particular knowledge.

Que. What is the general knowledge required?

Ans. 1. The knowledge of God, his nature, persons, attributes and works.

2. The knowledge of our natural condition by original sin, and the
punishment thereof.

3. The knowledge of the covenant of grace, concerning our redemption in Christ.

Que. What is the particular knowledge?

Answ. The knowledge of the nature and use of the Sacrament, in the signs and
actions to be performed about them.

Quest. What is the second thing?

An. A true and sound faith.

Quest. What is faith?

A. A sure persuasion, that all Christ's merits are mine, as if I had wrought
them my self.

Quest. Why is faith necessary?

Ans. Because in the Sacrament we receive so much as we believe, and no more.

Quest. Do all receive grace presently in the Sacrament?

Ans. No.

Quest. How then?

Ans. 1. Such as have strong faith indeed, do at the instant receive both
grace, and a sense of grace.

2. A there receive grace peradventure, but no sense and feeling of grace.

3. Others receive neither grace, nor any sense of grace for the present.

Quest. What is the reason that some receive grace, but no sense of it?

Ans. The weakness of their faith, being lke to a vessel with a narrow
mouth, that can receive but a little water at out.

Quest. What is the reason that some receive neither grace, nor any sense of
it?

Ans. Because they come vnhumbled and unprepared.

Qu. Whas it to be done in both these cases?

Luke 17.5. Mark 9.24
Ans. We must earnestly pray for increase of faith.

Qu. What is the third thing?

Ans. Repentance.

Q. Wherein consists that?

Matt. 26.75. Psalm. 119.106
Ans. In an hearty sorrow for our sins past, and a full pu^pose to lead a
godly life for the time to come.

Q. What is the fourth thing?

Ans. Love and charity toward our brethren.

Q Wherein consists that?

Ans. In a readiness to satisfy for the injuries which we have done to others:
Mat. 5.23.24
and to forgive them that are done to our selves.

Qu. What is the fifth and last thing?

An. A special sanctification.

Qu. What is that?

An. A renewing of our Faith and Repentance, Genesis 35.6 1 Samuel 16.5. Job 1.5.
as we have particularly renewed our sins

Qu In what manner must this duty of Examination be performed?

An. 1. With diligence, Lam. 3.40. Zeph. 2.1. 2 Cor. 13.5. Heb 4.13. Psa,
44.20, 21
that we may thoroughly discern of our estate.

2. With singleness of heart, because we have to deal with God that can not
be deceived.

3. Speedily without delay.

4. Constantly, without giving over, till we have found that we seek for.

5. With earnest prayer to God, for the direction and assistance of his Spirit.

Que. Why does the Apostle command every man to examine himself? every man
to examine himself?

1 Cor. 2.11
An. 1. Because every man knows himself best.

2, Because a godly man will be most faithful to himself.

Romans 14.12 Galat. 6.5
3. Because every man must chiefly give account to God for himself, and not
for others, further then he is charged with them by virtue of his calling.

Que. How does the Apostle prove, that the unworthy receuing of the Lords
Supper causes temporal judgments?

Ans. By the present experience which the Corinthians had in themselves.

Q. What was that?

Ans. For this cause many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep, that
is, are dead.

Que. What do you generally learn from thence?

A. That as all sin, so especially unworthy receiving is the cause of outward
calamities.

Quest. Why does the Apostle make mention of diverse kinds of judgments?

Deuteronomy. 28. tot. and 32.34 Leuit. 26. tot.
Ans. To teach us, that the Lord has variety of judgments to inflict upon
sinners.

Que. Why are the judgments set down, one greater then another?

Answ. To teach us, John 5.14 Amos 4.6, 7, 12
that there are degrees of Gods judgments: if we can not profit by the lesser,
he can and will inflict greater.

Quest. Does God strike his children with temporal death?
