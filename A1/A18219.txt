Richard Tauerner to the tender youth of England, gretynge.
THe cause, gentle Children, that has impelled me to take these pains in
this book, is your^ weal and commodity. I perreyued, that this book which is
entitled and which commonly we call Cato, as it is in deed very apt and
accommodate for your education in virtue and learning: so it is also very
much frequented and borne in your hands. But again I perreyued, that of the
most part it is rather borne in the hands, then imprynted and fired in the
memory. The cause hereof, I could conierture to be nothing else, but that the
most part of this book is composed not in solute oration, but in meter, which
to y^ rude child must needs be obscure and full of difficulty, and
consequentlye unpleasant and unsavory. For the redress therefore of this
inconvenience, I being moved, good children, with the love that I bear unto
you, have not disdayned to play as it were the child again, attempering my
self to your tender wits and capacities. I have not translated the book
word for word, for then I should have taken away the office of your schole
master, and also occasion you to be more negligent and slack in your study
upon trust of the translation thereof. But I have with brief scholies only
illustrated and opened the sense of the verses, in which thing I have
chiefelye followed the great Clerk of most happy memory Ersamus of
Roterodamme, which before me has done the same in the Latin tongue. Now it
shall be your parts (sweet children) so to embrace this book, and to bear it
hence forth, not only in hand, but also in mind, as I may thyncke my
labor well employed upon you. Fare you well.

Cognatos cole. Magistrummetue. The first reverence is to God, the next Gradus

to the father and mother, the third to the rest of thy kynsfolke. We make
supplication unto God with our prayers and sacrifices. We love our Parents

DISTICA DICTA CATONIS.
SI deus est animus, nobis vt Si, pro quia. Carmina (Vergilius in sexto libro
deum spiritum et mente^, vocat.
carmina dicunt:
Hic tibi praecipue sit pura mente colendus.
The people thought God to be appeased with sacrifices of beasts and of
things corporal. But where as God him self is a mind and no body, doubtless
he ought chiefly to be honored with the puretie of mind. Yea, and at this day
also the common sort of Christians worship God with certain corporal
ceremonies only, where as the most thanckefull and acceptable worship is the
godlynes of the mind, for such worshyppers does the father of heaven seek,
which will worship him in spirit, him self being a spirit.

Plus vigila semper, nec somno deditus esto.
Nam diuturna quies uitijs alimenta ministrat.
For as much as life is a watchynge, Plinius.
according to the mind of Pliny, we ought to take heed, that we loose not
the greatest part of our life with sleep, namelye sith of the same many vic^s
be gendred, as well of the body as of the mind.

Virtutem primam esse puta com escere linguam.
Proximus ille Deo, qui scit ratione tacere.
The first, that is to say, the chief and greatest virtue is to refrain thy
tongue, that thou speak nothing rashelye. For God which is wisest,
speaks seldom and not but things necessary, where as there is nothing,
but he sees, nothing, but he understands. Wherefore he is nert to God,
which wyselye and with judgments of mind can keep silence.

Sperne repugnando tibi tu contrarius esse,
Co^ueniet nulli, qui secum dissidet ipse.
He that stryueth with him self shall full evil agree with other men, that is
to say, he that has no certain form and institute of life but is with every
puff of wind carried now hither now thither, is not mete for the company of
honest men.

Si vitam inspicias hominum, si denique mores,
Cum culpent alios, nemo sine crimine viuit.
Worldelye people do marcke other men's faults, no man sees his own, where
as in very deed no person at all is void of vices, if he will narowlye
examine his life and manners.

Q^rae nocitura tenes, quamuis sint chara relinque.
Vtilitas opibus praeponi tempore debet.
Other whiles it is expedient to throw away things mo^ste dear unto us, if
they should bring any ieoperdye upon us, as to cast away^ precious stones
and gold, that our life might be in more saufte, or pleasures, that we
Erasmus thinks it better thus. Co^st^ns et leuis ut res cumque expostulatesto.
might recover our health. For the pleasures ought not to be considered, but
the utility.

Constans and lenis, vt res expostulat esto.
Temporibus mores sapiens sine crimine mutat.
As time requires, so take upon the, now these, now those manners, Be sometime
grave and sad, and sometime again amiable and mylde according to the seasone
and place. Or if ye read (leuis) after Erasmus mind. Be sometime constant, and
sometime again light and chaungeable, as the time shall require.

Nil temere vxori de seruis creed querenti.
Saepe etenim mulier quem coniunx diligit, odit.
It is commonly the proper and peculiare fault of wives, to move and stir
their husbands against their servants, wherefore he advises them that they
give not lyghtelye credence to such complayntes.

Cumque mones aliquem, nec se velit ipse moneri*
Si tibi sit charus, noli desistere caeptis.
It is not enough lightely to monishe thy friend, when he does amiss. Thou
must still call upon him, thou may not leave him, that even with
importunity thou myghtest overcome him, if the matter be such that it
touches his good name, or his health.

Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis.
Sermo datur cunctis, animi sapientia paucis.
If thou medlest with wise men, thou nedest not many words. If with fools,
thou stryue^t in vain.

Dilige sic alios vt sis tibi charus amicus
Sic bonus esto bonis, ne te mala damna sequantur.
So use thy friends, as thou may be dearest to thy self. So do good to
other, that thou hurt not thy self.

Rumores fuge, ne incipias nouus author haberi.
Nam nulli tacuisse nocet, nocet esse locutum.
Spread no new tales among the people, for a rumoure commonly lights upon
his head, from whence it came. If there be no ieoperdye in the reportynge, yet
it hurts thee not, to hold thy tongue, if there be ieoperdie, it hurts to
utter it.

Rem tibi promissam certo pro mittere noli.
Rara fides, ideo, quia multi multa loquuntur.
Ma^^^o certain promysse to no man upon trust of another man's promise.
That which lies in thy power, thou maye^t pertourme, but another man's credit
thou cannest not warrant. And the common sort of men being most ready to
promise, do often times deceive in persourmynge of the same.

Cum quis t^ laudat iudex tuus esse memento.
Plus alijs de te, quam tu tibi credere noli.
Esteem not thy self by the praysynge of other men, but by thine own
conscience. Ask thy self in what case thou stand, and if thy mind
answers the, that thou art a far other person, then this man or that man
makes thee, thou owe rather to give crede^ce to thy^e own self, to whom
thou art better known, then to other.

Officium alterius multis narra re memento.
Atque alijs cum tu beneseceris, ipse sileto.
A good turn or benefit, which we receive at other men's hands, ought to be
had in mind of us, but a benefit done to other must be forgotten.

Multorum cum facta senex et recenses* ^* refers, narras.
dicta recenses
Fac tibi succurrant iuuenis, quae feceris ipse.
Aged folk which have seen and heard many things, be wont to tell the
sayings and deeds of many. But we ought to endeavor our selves, that we so
behave us in youth, that in age we may remember, not only what other men
have well said and done, but also what we our selves.

Ne cures si quis tactio sermon
loquatur.
Conscius ipse sibi de se putat omnia dici.
When thou see certain men whysper and speak secretlye together, thou may
not forthwith suspecte that they speak evil of thee. For that were a sign of
one that were gyltye in his own conscience.

Cum fueris felix quae sunt aduersa caueto.
Non ^odem cursu respondent ultima primis.
In prosperity fear adversity, for fortune is full of mutabilitie, and
oftentimes of merye begynnynges follow sad endynges.

Cum dubia et fragilis sit nobis vita tributa:
In morte alterius spem tu tibi ponere noli.
It is often seen that he that gapeth for another man's death is first strycken
with deaths dart him self, yea though he be the younger or stronger of body.
For certaynelye the very life of man is brykell, and breaks with every
casualtie.

Exiguum munus cum dat tibi pauper amicus,
Accipito placide, plane and laudare memento
Gifts are to be estimed not by the Placide. i. alacri uultu.
price, but by the mind of him that gives.

Infantem nudum quum te natura crearit,
Paupertatis onus pacienter far memento.
Sith nature has brought us forth Poverty is no evil thing.
naked, we may easelye perceive, that riches partayne not to man's nature, but
is strange from it. If thou loose a membre of thy body, it may perchance
grieve thee, for somewhat of thee is peryshed. But if riches be either taken
away, or do not chance unto thee, be not much agreued. For in these things,
which be verelye man's own, kings have not one jot moore, then thou that
art poor. Will thou know what is in deed thine? Thyncke what thou had
when thou were borne.

Ne timeas illam, quae vitae est ultima finis.
Qui mortem metuit, quod uiuit perdit idipsum.
Who so fears death, does not only not escape death, but moreover loses
the very self life that is given him. For a careful life is no life.

Si tibi pro meritis nemo respondit amicus,
Incusare Deum noli, sed te ipse coerce.
There is no greater corsey to a man's heart, then an unthankful friend.
Which thing if it happen, wit it not upon God as that it came by his fault.
Nape, rather take up thy self, that thou shelwe no moore such frendshyppe to
unthankful bodies

Ne tibi quid desit, quaesitis utore parce, Parce.i. modice sparigly.

Vtque quod est serves, semper tibi deesse putato.
Spend, but spend in measure the things that thou haste gotten together. And
to the intent thou may keep that thou haste, always ymagine thou want
somewhat, lest all be gone ere thou be ware. For in the purse bottom (says
Hesiode) it is to late sparynge. Sera in fu^do parsimonia. Ven tosus 1.
(...)dus iactabundus.


Quod praestare potes, ne bis promiseris ulli.
Ne sis ventosus, dum uis urbanus haberi.
That which thou cannest not perform, to promise though it be but ones,
were a token of much rashness. But the thing that thou cannest perform, to
promise it to a man first ones and then again is token of beastynge and no
point of humanity.

Qui simulat uerbis nec cord est fidus amicus,
Tu quoque fac simile, sic ars ars signifies here craft, deceyte or color.
deluditur ar^e.
Against him that uses a color of frendshyppe toward thee and is not in
deed thy heartye friend: Use thou the same also, and according to the
proverb. CRETIZA CVMCRE TENSI. For better it is otherwhyles to keep a feigned
friend, then to make him thine open enemy, which thou should do, if thou
show thy self that thou perceyuest his clokyng.

Noli homines blandos nimium sermon probare.
Fistula dulce canit, volucrem dulce pro dul^^ter.
dum decipit auceps.
Fair words make fools feign. Esteem not men by their good sayings but
by their well doings. He lies in wait of thee that speaks to thee most
fair. Remember that birds also be mocked and caughte in the snare.

Si tibi sint nati, nec opes, tunc artibus illos
Instrue, quo possint inopem defendere ars is here taken for conninge or science
u^tam.
Cunning (say they) is no burden, but whether so ever a man become, it
mayntayneth him, yea, much moore certaynlye then money or ly^elode, for that
may be taken from him by an hundredth misfortunes, where as a science or
occupacion abides.

Quod uile est charum, quod charum est, uile putato.
Sic tibi nec parcus, nec auarus habeberis ulli.
That the people makes much of, that despise thou. And that they despice make
thou much of. Thus shall it come to pass, that neither thou shall be a nigaroe
to thy self. For thou shalt dare use the things that thou set not much
by. Neither shalt thou seem couetouse to any manne, sytth thou shalt not
covet gredelye, nor yet keep buselye the things that they most covet. The
people most regards riches, but learning and virtue they set lest by.
Turn thou the opinion. For such be the things to every man, as is his
opinion of them. The people judges, Fesauntes, Partrigies, Quayles, deyntye
dyshes. Thyncke thou contrary, y^ they be vile meats, and thyncke the
deyntiest meat of all is a new laid egg, Lettesse, a Chicken. Thus neither
shalt thou seem a snouge to thy self, sith thou haste that which is in thy
judgment deyntye, neither shall thou covet the deynties of other men, which
he to thee vyl^.

Quae culpare soles, ea tu ne seceris ipse.
Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum.

It is a foul rebuke for thee to do that thing thy self, which thou
blamest in other. A vicious life deminisheth a teachers authority and
estimation.

Quod iustum est petito, vel quod uidiatur honestum.
Nam stultum est petere quod possit iure negari.
The thing which seems not ryghtfull or unhonest, is to be desired of no
Amicus sed vsqu^ ad aras.
man. For no man owes in things unlawful to satisfy his friends desire.

Ignotum tibi nolito preponere no^is.
Cognita iudicio constant, incognita casu.
Exchange not easelye the known with the unknown. For thou shalt moore
comodiouslye use the things thou know which thou can judge of, then that
whereof thou haste had no experience. And such things as thou art
acquaynted with, if they be good, y^ shall use the^ more rightly, if they be
evil* thou shalt bear the^ the more Plautus.
easelye. For as the Poet Plautus says: Euyls known be no euyls. Things
unknown how they shall prove it is uncertain.

Cum dubia incertis versetur vita periclis pro pe^^culis. laboras. 1. vexaris.
periclis,
Pro lu^ro tibi pone diem, quicumque laboras.
The sense and order is this. Where as the doubtful life of mankind is turned
and tossed with uncertain perils, that is to say, with a thousand
casualties and hasardes, thou manne what so ever thou art which do labor,
that is to say: which art vered and troubled with the euyls of this life,
count every day of thy life as it were won and gained, moore then thou
lokedest for. For every day that thou haste passed, might have been thy
last day, as it was uncertain whether it should have chanced unto thee, or
no.

Vincere cum possis, interdum cede sodali.
Obsequio quoniam dulces vincuntur amici.
Other whiles thou must give place and be obsequious to thy fr^de though thou
may overcome him; and patte him to silence. For surely such obsequie and
gentle fashions do retain friends in amity.

Ne dubites cum magna petas impendere parua.
His e^enim rebus coniungit Gratia charos. Gratia, the Goddess of favor.

Stycke not to bestow a little for the obteynynge of much. For Grace, that is
to say, the Goddess of b^neuolence or favor coupleth together loving and
dear friends with these lynkes and chains of giving one to another.

Litem infer cave cum quo tibi gratia iuncta est.
Ira odium generat, concordia nutrit amorem.
Take heed thou make no strife nor contencion with thy friend. For stryuynge
and pleadynge with thy friend breadeth often times hatred, where as on the
contrary part concord norysheth love.

Seruorum ob culpam cum te dolor urget in iram,
Ipse tibi moderare, tuis ut parcere possis.
Punyshe not thy servant or scholar so long as thou feel thy self chafed
with ire, but first tempre thy self, that when thy anger is laid, thou
may either forgive, or punyshe moore gently.

Quem superare potes, interdum vince ferendo.
Maxima enim morum semper patientia virtus
It is a right soueraygne virtue: yea, when thou may have the upper hand,
yet sometime to su^ter thy self to be v^quyshed, and to neglecte thine
aduersarye.

Conserua potius quae sunt iam parta labor.
Cum labor in damno est, crescit mortalis egestas. Labor in damno.

It is much more sure and also moore easy to keep that thou haste gotten with
thy labor, then to botche up again that thou have wasted by ryotte. ^epe
together then the things alredye gotten. For when thy travel and labor is
spente in botchynge up and in recouerynge the damage and loss that thou haste
by thy folly sustained, there grows worldly beggerye. dapsilis. 1. ^iberalis.


Dapsilis interdum notis, charis, and ami^is,
Cum fueris, felix: semper tibi proximus esto.
When ^hou art happy and in wealth be otherwhyle liberal to thy neighbors,
friends, and lovers, but be always nerest to thy self.

LIBER SECVNDVS.

Vt sapiens viuas, audi quo discere possis,
Per quae semotum vitijs traducitur aeuum.
Ergo ades, and quae sit sapientia, disce legendo.
Other matters ye may learn of other Poets. Vergile in his books of
Georgikes teaches husbandrye. Macer sets out the virtue of herbs. ^urane
writes of the civil wars of the Romans. Ouide shows the art of
loving, and in his ^legies teaches loves. But if thou couetest the art and
way how to live well and ryghtlye, read this book. This shall teach thee
no vulgar acts and tri^^es, but after what sort thou may lead a life
secluded and severed from vices.

Si potes, ignotis etiam prodesse memento.
Vtilius regno, meritis acquirere amicos.
Not only upon our friends we ought to be beneficial, but strangers also
must be won with some benefit wherein we may do them good. For it is
much moore profitable for a man to get him friends with his demerites and
good deeds then to have a kingdom. A kingdom may be taken away, friends
will succor him that is deposed or put out, for they be far surer whom
thou wynnest with benefit, then whom thou press^i^ with power.

Mitte arcana dei, caelumque inquirere quid sit.
Cum sis mortalis, quae sunt mortalia cura. Mortalia. i. human.

According to the sentence of Socrates, those things that be above us long
nothing to us. He admonishes us therefore that omittyng the study of natural
Philosophy, we will regard the things that pertayne to humane life, that is
to wete, to the framynge of manners and pourgynge the mind of evil effects.

Linque metum lethi, nam stultum est tempore in omni
Dum mortem metuis amittis gaudia uitae. alias amittere.

Relinquishe the fear of death, for there is great folly wynned therewith all
at all times. For first the person so fearing death, can by no means
shonne the thing he fears. Second, if this life has any sweatnes in it,
all that ^^ loses through his own folly.

Iratus de re incerta contendere noli.
Impedit ira animum, ne pos^it cernere verum.
Of a matter uncertain or of a doubtful question, see thou never do contend
or dispute when thou art angry. For anger is a great obstacle and let to the
mind, that it, can not discern ne epsy the truth.

Fac sumptum propere, cum res Erasinus pro propere purat lege^ dum esse prompte.
desiderat ipsa.
D^ndum etenim est aliquid, cum tempus po^tulat autres.
Do cost, when the matter requires, quickelye and redelye lest either thou
some to do it with an evil will, or do it when the time is paste.

Quod nimium est fugito, paruo gaudere memento
Tuta mage est puppis modico quae flumine fertur. Mage pro magis.

The low state and condition of living is surer then the high, like as a ship
is in moore sauftye which is in a little stoude then that which swymmeth in
the waves of many seas.

Quod pudent socios pruden^ ^^lare memento.
e plures culpent id quod tibi displicet vni.
If thou be wise, remember thou do not d^^c^ose to any if thou ha^^e done
ought that thou may be ashamed of, lest many men now do blame thee for
that which before thou bewrayedest thy self* discontented but thee alone.

Nolo putes prauos homines peccata lucrari.
Temporibus* eccata latent, et tempore parent. parent pro apparent

I will not thou should thyncke (says this author) that evil disposed
and wicked men do win their misdemeanors and offices, that is to say, that
they shall escape so without punyshement, for that were a winning unto the^
and a gaynes of their naughtynes. Nay, they shall not escape so. For as time
covers, so time also bewrays all things.

Corporis exigui vires contemnere noli.
Consilio pollet, cui vim natura negauit.
Despice not the powers of a little body. For often times that which lacks in
the bodily strength is recompensed in the strength of the mind.

Quem scieris non esle parem tibi, tempore cede.
Victorem a uicto superari saepe videmus.
If thou perceyuest that thou haste to do with one that is myghtyer then thou,
and y^ thou art ouermasched give place for a time and suffer him to have the
victory. For in process of time it often happens that by the alteration of

Quid statuat de te, sine te deliberat ipse.
Search not by lottes, sorcerye, witchecraft or other wicked crafts, what

counsel.

ought to be clean forgotten.

Nec te collaudes, nec te culpaueris ipse.
Hoc faciunt stulti, quos gloria vexat inanis.
Neither praise nor disprayse thy self. For who soever does either of them,
seems to seek vain glory. For even he that disprayseth him self seems for
this intent to do it, that he may be contraryed of such as hear him and so
be praised of them.

Vtere quesitis modice. Cum sumptus abundat,
Labitur exiguo quod partum est tempore longo.

Nam nullum crimen vini est, sed culpa bibentis.
That thou offendest and do amysse through bronckenshyppe, forgive not thy

Indulget fortuna malis, vt laedere possit.
Take it not grievously, when either thy matters prospere not according as thou

When thou s^est a thing meet for thee, let it not slyppe but take the
occasion when it serves. For Occasion is thus painted. She is before in the

Behold the thing that already is come and which now follows thee, and
forses the thing also that is coming, and which hangs over thy head. As
who should say: Of things passed done well or otherwise, take counsel how
thou may use things to come. Wherein thou shall follow the example of Ianus
the ancient god of the Romans, which was painted with two faces in whom was

thine own intemperancye and by misgouernaunce of thy self, thou blamest the
time or the vnwholsomnes of the air or place (as commonly men do) where thou
art cause thy self of thy trouble and sorrow.

Cum vigilat sperans, per somnum cernit idipsum.

Thou what so ever thou art (good reader) which do covet to know this
book of verses: shalt carye away most wholesome and commendable precepts of

image or representacion of death. Thou shalt, I say, bear away many
commodities by reading and reuoiuynge this book. Contrary, if thou set
naught by it, thou shall not despise me that am the writer, but thy self.

The mind that is werie^ with serious assayres must otherwhyles be refreshed

that she brings with her. No, keep her not, if she begin to be greuouse and
comberouse unto thee, but let her go with that she brought a gods name

ye note that by the laws of the Romans before the religion of Christ came
among them, they might at their pleasure shyft away their wives, if they
lyked them not and take new. But Christen me^ can not do so. Wherefore they
ought to be the more diligent and circumspert to choose such as they may live

Iudicis auxilium sub iniqua lege rogato.
Ipsae etiam leges cupiunt vt iure regant^r.
Extremity of law is extreme iniurye, Terence.
as the Poet Terence says. Wherefore if contrary to equity thou be pressed
with the rigor and extremity, desire the help of the judge that has
authority to tempre the rygoure as the case requires. For the very laws
themselves demand the same, that they should be moderated and expounded
according to equity and conscience.

Quod merito pateris, pacienter far memento,

Who soever coueteth to lead a quiet life and labors that his mind be not

with these precepts.

Quas qui suspiciunt, mendicant semper auari.
Regard not worldelye riches, if thou desyrest to be happy and blessed in thy

Quam nemo sanctus nec honestus captat habere.
As it is a wise man's property to love money for the use of it. So it is a

Quod donare potes, gratis concede roganti.
Nam recte fecisse bonis in part lucrorum est

the Mime Publian. Beneficium dando accepit qui digno dedit. He has received a
good turn by geuynge, Mimus Publia.
which has given or done a good turn to the worthy.

Quod tibi suspectum est, confestim discute quid sit
Nanque solent primo quae sunt neglecta nocere.

Indulgere gulae noli, quae ventris amica est.
When the chargeable and losfull pleasure of the body does occupye and
embrace thee, which doubtless is a great spender and waster of thy goods, take heed thou give not thy self to deyntye and delicious fare, for the pleasant
contentacion and satisfiynge of thy mouth and palate (which lust and desire
to fare deyntelye is here called Gula, and is the bealyes friend) lest thou
ouercharge thy self with expenpenses Mark what is (Gula.)
and so be brought to extreme beggerye. The sense then of the verses is this.
Beware thou double not thy sore, one evil may so be borne, two at ones can
not. To love women is chargeable. To feed of deyntye and fine meats is also
chargeable. If thou will needs ensue the one, ^^ee the other.

Cum tibi proponas animalia Proponas i. statuas.

Where as in thine own conceyte thou do taste thee to fear all beasts,

Fortune often times does suddenly pluck from a man his goods, as by fire,

Be not careless when fortune is quiet and caulme, but fear a tempest, again

commedation to have knowledge and a foul reproach to be ignorant like a brut
beast.

Cum Venere et Baccho lis est et runcta voluptas.
Quod lautum est animo complectere, sed fuge lites.
There is joined with Venus and Bacchus both pleasure and strife, pleasure if
ye use their commodities measurably and well, strife and displeasure, if ye use
them (otherwise. Wine the making whereof was invented by Bacchus) moderatlye
taken makes y^ heart cherefull, immoderatly, sets men together by the
ears. Likewise it is of love, lawfully taken and honestly it delyteth,
otherwise it breadeth discord and variaunce.

Sun t quaedam quae far decet patienter amicum.
It is a soore loss to loose the things a man has by the damage and fault of
his friend, as if his beasts should eat up my corn or such like thing, I
would not be contented therwyth, but require amends. Yet again some thynge^
there be which it becomes a friend patiently to suffer of his friend namely
light and small offenses.

then is she best. As who should say, if there be any goodness in a woman, it

Erasmus) is a crooked and disceytful pere, and therefore she is least hurtful
when she is openly naught. This is not spoken of women, but it agrees upon
some men also.
