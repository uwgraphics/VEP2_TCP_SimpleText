Here ends the table of this present book named the ordynarye of christian
men.
Here follows a notable treatise and full necessary to all christian men for to
know and it is named the Ordynarye of Crystyanyte or of christian men. Here
follows the Prologue.
EVery creature reasonable unto who me god has given mind and understanding
and will. Him ought to know serve and love with all his might as much for the
goodness and noblenes of his creacyon as well as of his redempcyon and of the
glory that we trust in. The which things be so great and good that no heart
them may think ne tongue can them declare. Also he ought to be fered for to
eschew yt pain of eternal dampnacyon. The which is so horrible a thing
oonly to ymagen that there is none erthely heart that by a thousand years if
he so long should live upon earth / but yt every day he ought to tremble. And
these pains we may not eschew ne the goods of eternal glory have ne
possed. If we be not obedyent unto our creator in keeping our vow and baptem
/ and in accomplysshynge all his co^maundemente^s. The which to Si vis ad
vitam ingredi serua ma^data. Math^xx.
know and understand every man ought to put also great dilygence and more /
as he does for to save his corporell life. For otherwise he may not long

health of souls that the sweet ^mo corinth. xiiiii In ecc^a vo^o qn ^ ^^a sensu

Jhesus has with his holy blood again bought / Follows a breue doctrine true
and catholyque and right necessary for the instruccyon and salvation of christian
men. In the which shall be spoken pryncypally of five things. Of the which
says saint Poule in the first epistle ad Corinthios / that more it is worth
and profyteth unto the salvation of souls five words then. x. thousand. And

saint Poule. The first is of the artycles of the faith. The second of the
commandments of the lawr. The third of sins ye which a man ought to
eschew. The fourth of the pains of hell the which a man ought to fere. And
the fyfth of the glory the which is without end that every man ought to
desire. Of these five things in example of the holy apostell ought to write
preche and teache all they that will please god / and unto these souls proufyte
/ and all right faithful christian men / the which have desire to come unto
salvation him ought above all things to read or here. For whoos death the
contrary has in him the sign of eternal dampnacyon / as they that love
better Romans of wars. of bataylles / wrytynges of poets / and of these
phylosophres erthely. The which make not the lives and examples of holy
saints and other holy wrytynges that touchen the deed of conscience and of
their salvation / and man says that wylfully such people renneth after ye
prechers the which pryncypaly secheth to speak unto the worldely people for to
go with their substance and silver / the which oftentimes inplye the mind of
them worldely in hye hard and curyous questyons / and by the swetnesse of
fair speech they wrape them and bring them to their end. So as prophesied
saint Poule in the pystle unto the bishop Thimothee saying the time shall come
that the world will no more of the good doctrine and salutary / but they shall
desire masters that them shall tell and preche things curyous and fables the
which unto them shall be plea sau^t. Of the which sinners writes saint Peter
in spekyng unto christian men / and says that so as it was of the people of the
Jews falls and cursyd prophets sy^ners / so unto them shall it come for there
shall come and arise among them some masters full of falsenes of cursydnes
and of disceyte the which shall give unto the people occasyon of their
pardicyon. And many shall take and follow the paths and the ways of their
adulteracyon. Here Semen est verbu^ dei. Luce. viii.
says master Nycholas de lyra that the word of god is the seed / he than
that sows this seed for auaryce or for pride pryncypally renou^ceth y^ word
of god his creator / and many there shall be the Pau^^ ad galla. i. S^ adhuc

which shall here gladly here such prechours not pryncypally for their
salvation or for to correct their vices or sins / but for ye sweet and fair

and of the artycles of the faith shall be blasphemed of such manner of
worldely people curyous the which shall disprayse these prechours of the
symplenes of the gospel. And for so much says saint Gregory that none is
wylfully herd if he please not unto the herers. Some of these prechers of the

to eshewe the peril of this error and dampnaco^n for to resemble and advise
these poor blind of Jhesu christ they be all true and faithful christian men
they shall have in this present treatise as of late it has be said five parts.
The first part shall be of ye nobleness and of the troth of the vow of
crystendome / the which ^owe is made in the sacrament of baptyme / and also of
the.xij. artycles of the faith The second shall be of the.x. commandments
of the law with ye transgressyon of them that be the.vij. deedly sins. The
third shall be of the.vij. works of mercy the which works shall be holde^
the great and last Jugeme^t / and the good and ylle shall be examyned / and
these cruwell and coueytous folk unto death eternal condemned / and these
pytous and merciful people in the glory of paradyse shall be rewarded. The
fourth party shall be techynges for well* and enterly him to confess of
sins ye which he may committee against ye arty^les of the faith and of the
commandments of the law of good works that a man leueth to do against ye
mercy of god without the which no man may well come unto salua^^on / for all
sin is reherced and compryseth in ye co^missyon in doing sin / or
abomynaco^n in leuy^ge the good the which a man is holden and bound to do.
The fyfth and the last party shall be of the pains of hell and of the Joys
of paradyse. Also it is to be noted yt as well for to satysfye unto these
clerks and for the more parfectly to conferme yt the which is written in
english as also for to eschew and detraccion of little understanding of
simple people I put in the heed of this book in many passages these auctorytees
conuocacions and allegacions the which be made in latin / except ye text of
the vow of baptyme the which I have will to put word by word in this
writing for to show the charity ruin of christian people in all estates in the
which they lyuen at this day. That is to wit the.xiiij. day of January the
year of our lord. M. CCCC. lxvij. after the Natyuyte of our lord Jhesu christ
after diverse chronicles and manner of nombre the years. In the which year and
day this present book has be first begone to be written.



Here ends the prologue / and now follows the first part of baptem.
Here follows the first part of this present book / of the vow and sacrament
of baptem.


AS unto the first party the which Capitulu^ primu^.
is of the vow and sacrament of baptem / it is to be noted yt after that Jhesu
christ had made publysshe and preche solemply the truth of the gospel as well
by his holy apostles / as by other prechers / it is impossyble for Johis.viii.
Qui ex deo est ^ba dei audit. Johis.iii. nisi ^s renat^fuerit ex aqua and spu
sacto no^ po^t introire i regnu^ dei. Mar. vit. Qui credid^rit and baptisat
tuerit salu erit. No^ po^t solui scriptura ^ohis.x.
man to be saved that is not baptized. And he that byleued in Jhesu christ and
is baptized. In like wise it is impostyble but that finally he be saved. For it
is the mouth of god the whithe is the sentence and text of the gospel that so
unto us witnesses / wherefore it is a thing right necessary to know First
how and in what manner the sacrament of baptem ought to be given. Secondely the
form and manner to execute it solemly. Thyrdely the virtue and the effect that
it has in the soul of a christian man. And fourthly to know every article of
the faith in partyculer. As unto y^ first that is to understand that to
christian or baptem is as much to say as to wasshe / and is understand
pryncypally of the soul / the which by the vert^e of god is puryfyed /
having this sacrament from all sin / be it pride venyall or mortal. And for
as much that ye puyssau^ce of god is not restraynte ne bound by the
institucyon of these sacraments the which of pure might absolueth he may in
many manners cleanse and purge the soul and it wa^she from sin. The doctors
say that there Triplex baptismus.
are three manner of baptemes. The first manner is when any person shall by
preuylege syngulerly sanctified from orygynall sin before that he be Antequam
exieris de vulua sa^ctificauite. Hiere. i.
borne or after the pleasure and will of god / as were saint Jheremy and saint
Johan baptyst. The second when any not baptized unto the purpose / to make him
baptized in place and time / and before that he be baptized / he deyeth by
martyrdom or otherwise / he may be in the way of salvation if he have none
other lettynge. The third is the common and sacramental the which is done
by word and water. And such sacrament and all other ought to be ordynatly
executed by man priest or curate as unto that of Jhesu christ true god and true
man. But in the caas of necessyte the baptem may be given dewely by every other
person erthely that may have puyssau^ce and intencyon to do and say that that
holy church does and says in admynystrynge solemly such sacrament. For if it
so be that there be a man / that might and ought to do it a woman ought not it
to do / if there were clerk in holy ordres / the subdeacon ought not to do it
before the deacon / nor the lay man before the simple clerk. ^or otherwise
they sin. And if there be oportunyte of time they should be it man or woman
require mercy with great contricyon of their sins if they have remorse of
conscience of deedly sin. For he that admynystreth or receives any sacrament
he ought to be in the state of grace / and that is as unto the mynysters of
that sacrament. Also it is to know that every creature erthely not baptized is
bound to receive that sacrament as it is said in place and time. But otherwise
was this oblygacyon accomplysshed at the beginning man was not baptized but in
the vigyll of Eester and of Whytsontyde / and they that dewely were
cathecuminus: that is to say instruct of the artycles of the faith and of
that / yt they ought to vow or promytte But after by the inspyracyon of the
holy ghost it was ordained that these childern forthwith after yt they were
borne should be baptized. For in them is no thing that may let the effect
of that sacrament / as should be mortal sy^ne actuel or fiction And that
proceeds of the mercy and Justyce dyuyne For so as two persons that is to
know Adam and Eve us bind all by law commonly to sin and dampnacyon without
our gylte actuell. So pleases unto the Justyce dyuyne that our fader Jhesu
christ and our mother holy church sygnifyeth the godfader and godmoder us
promyttynge unto salvation before that we have vsauuce reason or might of any
operacyon.

Here follows the manner to conferme the holy baptem in the article of
necessyte.
Of the manner to conferme the sacrament of Capitulu^. ij.
baptem in the caas of necessyte. That is to know that if a woman or other
simple person baptyse he ought to take heed unto ye matter of the sacrament
unto the form of the words and unto the intencyon. First unto ye matter. For
that ought to be water naturell. For man may not be baptized with wine / with
sydre / with blood / with milk with vryne / with water of roses / or other
water dystylled / but man shall be baptized in necessyte with lie / and with
water in the which man shall have smarte in the flesh. And it is holy thing
and good counsel that a man have holy water in his house For if it were well
possible man should not be baptized with other water. Also it is to advise
simple people that if there apere any membre of the child in the which men
knows life and of the which he fereth the death before that it be borne
perfectly he it should baptyse in that membre the which apereth. Also if the
mother pass this life before the natyuyte of the child ye which a man byleueth
truly life in her / he ought hastily to gaffe her mouth / and after dyscretly
open the belly of the woman and baptyse the little child if it be found on
live / if it be found deed it ought not to be buried within the holy ground /
if the mother has not ben slain and put to death for the love of god or for the
troth of the faith. For in such caas may doctors hold yt ye child should
be martyr. For it is more to fere and to Nota.
plain where a child deyeth without the receyuynge the sacrament of baptem
then it does of the destruccyon and the falling in to depnes of all ye to wnes
castelles / and cytees of the world. In the which apereth the great sin /
and the great blame of those the which them govern ylle in this matter what so
ever manner it be in. As unto the form that is those words the which he ought
to say / he behooves to take heed unto them that be ordained of god and of
holy church as well in caas of necessyte as of solempnyte. That is to know
Ego baptisote In nomi^e patris et filij et spiritus sancti amen. De forma
baptismi.
And in english. I baptyse the in the name of the fader and of the sone and
of the holy ghost. Or in other langage or words betokenynge the same sentence
For one may baptyse in all manner of langages / And it behooves that the words
and the doing that is to put the water upon the child be holy in any wise
together. That is to say that before that he has said all these words he have
begone to put the water or before that he has ends to put the water he
begin the words / for otherwise there is no baptyme. That is to know if a
man say all these words and after put the water or first ends to put the
water and after says these words. As to the entencyon / that is to know that
at the De intention.
lest that person the which baptyseth ought to have intencyon to do that /
that our mother the holy church intends and commands to do and it may
suffyse such general intencyon / so that he byleueth the same or have in his
intencyon yt the sacrament of baptem purefyeth man from all sin or tha^ these
words before said suffyse. That is I baptyse the in the name of the fader and
of the sone and of the holy ghost / that he say not with that and of our lady
and of saint Johan or of thing like he has not than baptym / for the
intencyon the which is of necessyte of the sacrament is not good nor
ryghtfull. Of other cases and diffycultees the which be in this matter should
these curates and prechers sometime show in publysshynge for these diverse and
pyteous cases the which by Ignorance may come in many places of crystendome.
The second thing pryncypally to be considered in this matter is of ye form
and manner the which is most commonly holden in the holy church of Rome in
baptysynge solemply in the which I shall hold this manner order. First I shall
declare what it is to say exorciser and cathecyser. Secondely I shall put the
latin as well of the ordynary as of the orysons and other things so as men
use in the church most commonly. And thyrdely I shall put the subitau^ce of the
latin before said in english and the significacion of that that is done and
said after ye exposicyon of some doctors in holy theology. As unto ye first
that is to know that the exorcysyon and cathecysacyon ought de exorcismo.
to proceed the baptem but for the good understanding the which is exorcyser
that is to be noted yt when Adam and Eve unto whom god had given dominacyon of
all the morlde disobeyed unto god the devil took power upon them and in like
wise Gene. i. Dominamini in piscibus maris and volatilibus celi and vniuersis
aiantibus ^ mouent superterram. Nu^c principes huius mundi eiiciet for as.
Johis. xii.
upon all their dominacyon as were the air ye water and these other creatures
the which were made and create for man. And than the devil him called Prince
of the world / but Jhesu christ is comen for to fight with him and to put hy^ out
of that yt he held by tyranny. And for so much all these things the which
be spoken and consecrate unto god and unto his dyuyne service / as chirches /
chircheyardes / awters corporaces / chalyces / towelles / vestymentes
apperteynynge unto ye holy mysterye of the awter be exorcyses by the
benediccion and by the holy oryson of priests bishops. That is to say yt the
puyssau^ce of ye enmye infernal is coniured and put out of these said things.
And for as much ye little child is in the power and dominacion of ye deuyil
by the sy^ne of our fornfads which ought to be by the holy sacrament of baptem
wtsayd and hallowed ye right holy temple of the holy ghost deputed unto ye
dyuyne service of Jhu christ and of the holy church catholyke he ought to be
exorcysed. And if it so were that same little child were baptized in ye ^as^
of necessyte without being cathecysed or exorcysed and he line / a man ought
then after beseech and do ye solempny^t of exorcysacion. In ye which after
Rychard demi ville be made many things so as it appears in declarynge ye
text. And yt is as now of ye exorcysion and rest to see what it is to say and
signifye cathecyset Cathecyser is as much to say as to instruct orteche ye
fundacions and artycles necessary of our holy Illi ^ pro baptisan dis i

faith. For all they yt ought to be baptized and promytt to keep ye faith and
commandments they should first be taught. For our lord commanded unto ye
apostles y^ day of his blessed Ascenco^n to go through ye world to teache and
baptyse / and first teache to baptyse / and for as much at ye beginning of ye
holy church this m^ner Textus.

of ye pryncyples and artycles of ye faith. And during the time yt they learned
the law in good purpose to be baptized men did them call Cathecuminus and in
this astate and degree abode saint Martyne by the space of. viij. years / for
at. x. years were made cathecumine and at. xviij. year were baptized. But after
yt Crystendome was much augmented and multeplyed the blessed holy ghost has
enspyred ye holy church of the manner to do it more certain and profitable. That
is yt these childern should be baptized as soon as they be borne for ye peryls
and lettynges that may come in so much yt the godfaders and godmoders them
bind unto god and holy church yt when they have age and dyscrecyon that they
shall learn them the law of the faith and these things apperteynynge and
necessary unto their salvation if the natural fader or mother or other them
teache. And for so much says saint Thomas in his quart yt when the godfaders
or godmoders say Credo / it is as much to say after one exposicyon as I
promytte to put true heart and diligence to instruct this child when he shall
have wit and discrecyon for to understand that the which is of necessyte
unto saluaco^n for as much as it apperteyneth unto prelates and curates to
teache their subjects general how be it apperteyneth in partyculer and in
especyal unto ye godfaders and godmoders for to teache them for whom they be
bound. In the which appears the great and merueyllous peril of many
godfaders or godmoders the which to teache that / that they know not. In so
much that in the more part or all at this day break yt promise. By ye
which much of these young people come to an evil end / and I believe verily
that is the defaute of faith / and these ylles that we see come rathely / and
in the more great part of that defaute. Wherefore pryncypaly I have be moved to
declare and write this matter / for as no thing it is to repair the hyenes of
the building where the fundaco^n is ruynous / and that suffysed as now of ye
exorcysme and cathecysme. For the manner and the practyse is declared here and
after more in partyculer / to the entente that simple people may understand
that they have vowed and promised unto baptem and the noblynes and dygnyte of
crystendome / and the form and manner as they have said and co^s^^a^ed and in
the temple of ye holy ghost and of that as understand these good and faithful
christian men / and in like wise as they may vndstande the fall and ruin of the
peril and the great ylle in the which is become ye more party of christian men
the which keep not neither faith nor commandments. And also that they the
which them well reform and cry god mercy and them repent and confess not
despayrynge themself may have by this writing the form and manner and the way
to return unto sweet Jhesus the which does them call and abide venite ad me

his arms spredde promyttynge if by this way or by other while that it is
time them convert / that he unto them shall pardone the transgressyon and
treason of brekynge the faith.

Here follows the text of the office of baptem with the exposicyon in
english.

Here follows the first oryson.

The exposicyon of that before reherced.
HEre begins ye order and manner of baptem when it is done solemply. First at
ye church door and not wtin ye child is offered unto ye priest who demau^deth
ye child a questyon / what axest you what wylt you have or where wylt you become.
And they yt it present answer for hy^ in his person I require crystendom. And
after yt priest demanded what name wylt you have / and ye godfad or both two
togyd answer for y^ child John or else after yt yt they hy^ will name Then ye
priest blows upon ye child saying to y^ devil of hell ye which has
puyssau^ce and dn^acyon upon ye little child for ye gylte of origynal sy^ne /
enmy I blawe ye in ye name of ye fad and of ye sone and of ye holy ghost and ye
command yt you go forth and depart from this create y^ which you hold in thy
service and comes to ye service of god deperte you forth with spiryt of
da^pnacion and give place to the holy ghost to come reform and counsel this
soul. After yt said makes the priest the sign of the cross in the forhede
and in the breast of the child saying I put the sign of the living god of Jhu
christ in thy forhede and in thy breast. Upon this mystery a man myt make a
questyon if man A questyon.
ought to say unto the child exeas and recedas ab hoc famulo tuo vel dei yt is
to say depart you from hy^ or this thy servant or if a man ought to say
deperte you from this thy servant or y^ servant of god. The answer / men
find in some books ye servant of the the answer.
devil and yt may be one and vndstande y^ one and y^ other how be it there
seems well to be great dyfference between y^ servant of god and the devil.
For it is a thing i^possyble to be y^ servant of god and ye devil Non
potestis deo seruite and ma^mons Math. vi. Item ^ no^ est mecu co^tra me est.
Et ^ no^ col ligit mecu^ dispergit Luce. xi. Mat. ix. Mathei. xii.
togydbut they yt have in writing in their books the servant of ye devil
speak as for ye hour present for the child is not ye servant of Jhu christ
till unto the water of baptem / and if he dey before yt he has received yt
water in ye name of ye fad y^ sone and ye holy ghost he should not be in ye way
of saluaco^n / as says Cipryan. And saint Thomas reherced it in his book
wherefore ye little child may say faithfully in the operacion of y^ devil and
not the servant of god / br^ the which callen before y^ baptem the servant
of god vndstanden y^ time to come after yt the mystery shall be ended which is
now begone. And for so much yt this solempnyte of the exorcyson and
cathecyson is not of ye insence and necessyte of baptem there is no great peril
or dyfference to read ye one or the other so yt he vndstandeth holy. Also by
the exsuflacion yt the priest does upon the child betokens y^ yt he chaffeth
and put out y^ power of y^ evil spirit which hy^ inforseth to let every good
work. Also by the sign of the cross made and put in the forhede and in the
breast is the toke^ that the child taked vtue and might to resyste the devil
openly and it apereth by the cross made in the forhede / and in the secretnes
of conscience made in the breast. After these things before said the priest
makes his prayer to god in the third person with all the holy church in
this manner.

Pleases it the blessed lord god to exalte my prayer / and my desire and
clamor may come before the true god eternal. And all mighty fader of our
lord Jhesu christ / pleases it y^ to behold this thy servant whom it has
lyked the to draw and call at the beginning of y^ knowledge of the law / and
the it pleases to Illumyn^ with thy gce / and to break the bounds of the devil
/ of the which he him held enlasyd. Also pleases the very god to open him
the yate of thy mercy / and him give the token of the true sapyence / by the
which he may eschew the power of all coueytousnes erthely / and to receive
the sweet odor of thy holy commandments / by the which he the may Joyously
serve in the holy church. Also to profit from day to day to the end that by
that medecyne he have dysposycyon to receive the grace of thy baptem. And that
we require in the virtue and in the name of our lord Jh^u christ Amen. Also it
is to be Nota.
noted that the priest that consecrat unto god be in the estate of grace / and
out of deedly sin / when he does solemply the office the which apperteyneth
unto a priest / he is the mynyster and servant of all the holy church / and
speaks unto god for and in the name of him. And for so much the clergy the
which sygnyfyeth and represents the church answers Amen. That is to say
we require Ame^ dico vobis si ^d petierit patre^ in noie meo dabit vobis.
Johis. xi.
all that it so be as thou haste said and demand. And for that / that the
holy church universally and comprehends all the holy college of paradyse /
and all the holy creatures of this world and of purgatory / the blessed sweet
Jhesus the which is cheyf and capytayne of all the holy church Beholds
pryncypally the merytes of holy-chirche these holy orysons that these priests
makes be they good or ylle / where by ye light of true faith and of holy
contemplacyon he shall see the virgyne Mary and all the holy college of
paradyse and him yt most is the blessed sweet Jhesu christ in so much that man
praynge and besechyng the majesty of god Dico vobis si d^ ^ ex vobis
consenseri^ super terra^ de oi re qua^cu^que petierint fiet illisa pre^ meo ^
est in celis. math xviii. Ego dico vobispe tite and dabit vobis querite and
iuenietes pulsate et aperiet vobis Ois em^ qui petit accipit and qui q^rit
inuenit and pulsanti aperiet. Luce. xi.
that it would please him to pardon unto this child the orygynall gylte / and
him give grace that he may be the membre of Jhesu christ and of the college and
company of all saints / should well be fulfilled of the swetnes and
admiracyon. Also we should make that our lord Jhesu christ unto us has taught
and commanded to require and axe in his name / saying truly I say you that
if ye demand any thing of god my fader in my name he shall give it you. And
for as much our mother the holy church holds this form that in the end of
these Orysons he puts per dn^m nostru^ ^h^m xp^m. Man demanded in the name
of Jhesus when he asks things that before the glory of god and the salvation
of souls. For Jhu^s is as much to say as savior. And it is impossyble that
who so demands Ambro. de officus Impossible e^ oro^nes multo^ no^ exaudiri.
that / that he ought to demand / so that he demand as he ought / that it
be refusyd. For god has said with his mouth that al they the which axe so as
it is said that they shall receive their asking and petycyon.

Here shall the priest make a cross in the forhede of the child saying.
PReces nostras quesumus ^n^e clementer exaudi et hu^c famulu^ tuu^ crucis
dominice cuius impressione cu^ signamus virtute custodi vt magnitudinis glory
tue rudime^ta serua^s per custodia^ ma^datorum tuorum ad noue regenerationis
gracia^ peruenire mereatur. Per xp^m.

DEus qui humani generis ita es co^ditor vt sis etiam reformator propiciare
populis adoptiuis et nouo testamento sobol^ noue prolis ascribe vt filij
promissionis quoth no^ potueru^t assequi per natural. gaudea^t se recepisse per
gratia^. Per xp^m.

The exposicyon of the text precedent.
AFter these things above said ye priest makes again ye sign of ye cross
with ye thombe in the forhede of the child with such an oryson / very lord of
all ye world we require yt of thy sweet mekenes yt it will please the to
receive our prayers / yt is that you keep and defend this thy seruytour or
servant unto whom we have enprynted in the forhede the sign of ye cross and
unto yt intent that he may keep the instrucco^n of thy commandments and yt
he may come unto the glory of ye new regeneracion yt is of the holy font of
baptem and of yt we require the in ye name and in y^ virtue of our savior Jh^u
christ ame^. And so it ought to be vndstande as it is specifyed before over al
where theris per dn^m nr^m

Also here follows an other oryson in such manner
O Very god the which have made and formed humayne lygnage and afterward have
reformed Pleases it y^ to receive in adopcion this new life and write among
these child of y^ new testame^to to y^ end yt by thy holy ^ce he may receive
yt yt he may not have by nature. And so it apereth yt by three times wtin a
little while has been marked with y^ soke^ Ascende^s jesus de (...) vidit celos

of the cross he yt should be baptized and three orysons unto god presented in
tokenynge y^ virtue of holy baptem / and that yt is made comes and proceeds
above all of yt holy blyssed trynyte. And of yt we have a figure in baptem of
our lord as where he showed hy^ unto the blessed trynyte euydently. God ye fad
in the voys y^ which said here is my sone god the holy ghost in symylytude of
a douue / and god the sone in our humanyte.

Here follows the exorcysacyon of the salt.
EXorciso te creatura salis In noie dei patris omipote^tis and in caritate dni^
nostri jesus xp^i et in ^irtnte spiritussancti. exorciso te per deu^ viuu^. per
deu^ veru^. per deu^ sanctu^. per deu^ ^ te ad tutella^ humani generis

omnibus accipientibus perfecta medicina permanens in visceribus eorum in noie
eiusdem dni^ nostri jesus xp^i qui venturu^ est iudicare viuos and mortuos et
seculum per ignem.

Amen.
Here he puts the salt in to the childs mouth asking his name and saying.
Accipe sal sapiencie vt sit tibi dn^s propiciatus in vitam eternal Amen.
AFter these things above said the preeste exorcysed the salt saying. I
conjure ye creature of salt. That is to say. I conjure in the the puyssau^ce
of the dyuyll in hell in ye name of god fader omnypotent and in ye charity of
our lord Jhu christ and in the virtue of ye holy ghost. I conjure the from the
living god / from the true god / and from the holy god / from god the which
the created unto the deffence and consolacyon of humane lygnage and command
that thou flee consecrated for the profit of the people that will come unto
the troth of the faith. And for so much our blessed god and lord we the
require that this creature of salt be made such sacrament in the name of the
blessed trynyte that he may chasse the devil. The which salt thou wylt our
blessed lord in halowynge halowe / and in blessing bliss. To the end that
this medecyne abide in the soul of all them that it receive in the name and in
the virtue of our lord the which shall come for to Juge the quycke and the
deed / and this present world shall make brenne by fire amen.

Than the priest takes the salt so hallowed in demau^dynge the name of the
child and it putting in his mouth saying. Take now the salt of true sapyence
/ to ye end yt it may please god to give the grace for to come to the life
eternal Amen.
HEre is to be noted as for the intent of things Her secundu^ gu^^lermu^
durau^^,
before said as for those that follow the which in this solempnyte of
exorcysmus / or of coniuracyon of the devil some things they make in
operacyon without all only / the which things are not in the soul materyally.
But they betoken things spirytuell as in putting the salt in yt mouth of the
child / he putting of ye spotell of the priest in his nosetrylles and in his
eeres / he making the cross with the holy oil in the breast and between the
sholders. Also after the baptem he makes ye cross with the holy cr^me upon
the childs heed / he puts on him afterward the white robe the which is
called the crysome. And of the signifycacyon of all these things shall be said
every thing in his order. These other things be / the which signifye and
make that / that they signifye / and in these things there is deed and word
as in the coniuracyon of the devil when the priest unto him says. Cursed and
dampened spirit / depart then forth with from this creature / as it is also the
imposicyon of the hand and of other things that follow. They sygnifye and
make ryally in deed that / that these words sygnifye. And it so be master
Guillyam durau^t it preueth Guillerm condura^di in quarto.
in his quart by reason and by auctoryte. His reason is such. The blyssed holy
ghost ye which may not fail or bear falls wytnes / governs and illumyneth
the chirthe in all things / and syngulerly in the solempnyte and custom of
the seven sacraments. Wherefore it behooves to say that these words and these
deeds that man holds and keeps in the custom of the church in executynge
these sacraments be not made for no thing and with thinking / but ryally and
truly make and sygnifye the things before ^ayd. (...) unto that is ye
auctoryte of saint Augustyn the which ^ayth that these little childern be
blowed on and exorcysed by the priest to ye intent that they be put out and
delivered from the puyssau^ce of the devil / and to the intent that they have
not in their souls any lettynge to receive the grace of god and to be made and
consecrated the temple of the holy ghost. Rest than to see what sygnyfyeth us
the salt so nobly consecrated / and put in to the childs mouth. For the first
m^rsell of his dinner is not oonly to much salt / but as unto the troth it is
but salt. And it is now manytested that it is not given to him for substance
or reteccyon cor^orell / but for some sygnyfycacyon spyrytuell. The which
sygnyfycacyon unto us is given for to understand by the proprete naturell of
salt / the which is much more gretter and larger in four manners. The first
is that the salt dries the earth in such a manner that she may not any herbs
give or bring forth after the salt. The second is that it gives sauouor
unto the metes. The third is that it keppeth the meets from putrefyenge and
from ro^^ynge. And the fourth that it is made of the water of the sea by the
force of fire. The fyfth is that god commanded unto Moses that in all the
sacryfyces the which he offered that he should put salt thereto. And by these
propretees unto us is fygured truly as witnesses the holy scripture the noble
virtue of sapyence and of dyscrecyon by the which man deserves between good
and ylle / and between the more goodness and the less goodness / and between the
more ylle and the less or the most little. And for so much he that has the
true sapyence of Jhesu christ and of a good christian man / he deserved and
consydereth the dyfference between the great virtue and goodness of the glory
of paradyse eternal and the great ylle of dampnacyon without ever to have
end. Also between these little temporal and worldely goods and the true
goods of the soul / as ben the great graces of god / his virtues / and his
merytes / and dyspraysen these little worldely goods for the love of the
great mighty sovereign / and fereth and flees the great horrible Augus Salis
natura in fecunditate^ terre facit. vnde i^ ipso. Po^uit terra^ fructifera^ in
salsuginem.
pains of hell / and secheth and desires the glory of paradyse. By the
which he is fulfilled in his spyryte of all desires erthely vain and worldely
/ and desires not to fructefye neither to increase with the goods of the
earth by auaryce or by other ylle manner ways again the sapyence dyuyne. And
this is for to vnderstand-by the first proprete of the salt the which dries
the earth. Also the good christian man puts reason and discrecyon in his
thoughts / and words / and in his deeds. By the which they be fwete of
savor and pleasant unto god / and unto his neighbors. And that is for to
understand by the second proprete of the salt the which gives savor to
all meets. Also it keeps him from all ylle or evil example and to give
occasyon of ylle and him enforces for to please god / and to conferme him unto
those holy persons. By the which way he may give unto his neighbors example
to do well and live well. And this is to be understand by that / that the salt
keeps from stenche and gives good odor. Also the salt of dyscrecyon is made
of the water of devotion / and of fire of tiue dyleccyon. Also fasting /
almesdede / prayer / or other sacrifyce that man may think unto god him
pleases not if it be not with the salt of dyscrecyon. They that have left the
salt of discrecyon of / crystendome Non est e^ ista capie^tia de ^ursu^
descende^s a patre luminu^ sco terrena aialis and diabolica. Jac. iii.
supposing that they be full of wisdom / brutale / deuylesshe / and worldely
as be they that have their hertes more in the world then unto their sal uacyon.
And for one carnal pleasur or some good transytorye lose the great goods of
eternal glory. be before god not only foles / but unsalted. The which is as
much to say as ben vncrystened and made as in manner forsakyng their faith /
as unto spirytuall understanding / and of these there ben with out nombre. By
the which they shall be departed from god / and with the angels and foles in
the pains of hell the one with the other / and all togyders among these
deuylles. And this is unto the sygnificacyon of the salt.

After the salt put in the childs mouth the priest in his own person with
all the holy church makes this prayer. True god above all holy faders /
fontayne of all troth / we the beseech and require that it would please the
swetely to behold him or her thy servant or seruytour in such manner / that
you unto him will grant that in castyn ge this first refeccion of salt never
may have hongre. That is to say that he have always wisdom and dyscrecyon
suffycyent in all things the which appertayned unto salvation / and that he
be replete of heavenly meets / to the end that he have desire of spirit in
serving the by true hope. And that it may please the very god him to conduyte
unto the holy regeneracyon / to the intent that he may come unto the here the
which thou have promised unto all faithful christian men.

THe god of Abraham / of Ysaac / and of Jacob / the which apyred unto Moses
in the mount of Synay the which drewest thy people the childern of Israel of
Egypt / unto them geuynge by thy sweet pity an holy angel for to keep them
day and night / we the require that in like wise thou wylt do unto him or her
thy seruytour or servant such grace that he may come unto the holy well of
baptem. By this oryson is eneweth euydentely shows that the baptem was
auncyently fygured when the people of god by miracle and puyssaunce dyuyne /
and by the service and mysterye of angels passed thorugh the reed see / and
were put out of Egypt and from the subieccyon of Pharaon. For by the baptem
men gooth from the derkenes of sin / and comes unto the light of grace / and
from the serny^e of the devil unto the service of Jhesu christ / and man
received the commandments upon the high mountain of the true faith. And so
much after this oryson the priest says unto the devil.

CUrsyd devil know thou thy sentence and give maugre thy will honor unto god
the tader / and unto Jhesu christ his sone and unto the blessed holy trynyte /
and depart thou forthwith from this the seruytour or servant of god. For ye
blessed pleasure and mercy of Jhesu christ is to call him now to his grace /
and unto the holy well of baptem. And we defend the that thou be not so hardy
for ever to do vyolence unto the holy token of the cross the which we put in
his forhede.

For the woman child.
GOd of heaven and of earth / god of angels / god of archangels / god of
propheses / god of apostles / god of martyrs / god of confessors / god of
virgyns / god of all good lyuers unto whom every tongue owes confession of
troth / and before whom every creature celestyall terrestyall and infernal
him inclyneth / we the require our sovereign lord that it will please the to
conduyte and bring this maiden unto the holy font of baptem. Per du^m etc.
And here the priest says again that the which is before written under this
word. Ergo maledicte. Than I shall not reherce otherwise but in putting. Ergo
maledicte.

GOd of Abraham of Ysaac and of Jacob the which by thy servant Moses dydest
deiyner thy people of Israel from y^ seruytude of Egypt unto them geu age y^
commandments / and the which delyuerest S^^anne from the infamye the which
of wrong unto her was put. I the require y^ it would please y^ to deliver this
thy seruytour geuynge unto her grace for to come unto holy baptem.

For the maiden.
CUrsed spirit I the conjure and command in the name of the fader / and of
the sone / and of the holy ghost that thou depart from this the servant of
god / and the holy Jhesu christ the which by miracle gives light unto him that
is borne blind. And the which on the fourth day raised the lazar / will thou
her to do thy commandment Ergo maledicte.

For the man child.
GOd of eternal life / refuge and defense of all them the which duly the
beseech and require the which art the pease of true orators / resur reccyon
of deed men my god I the require for thy servant and the which the demands
baptem to the end that by the regeneracyon spyrytuell he may come to the grace
eternal. My god where it has pleases the to say. Are and ye shall receive /

seche and you shall find / knock and unto you it shall be opened / pleases
it you him to receive / and him to give the alms of your grace / for he you
requires. Open him the yate for he knocks and calls requyrynge that by the
virtue of holy baptem he may come unto y^ royalme and riches of paradyse.

For the man child.
Harken a cursed adversary of humayne lygnage coniured and overcome in all
envy by the virtue of god the fader of our savior Jhesu christ his sone the
which the commands that in trembling and waylynge thou depart without
having any more to do with the servant of god the which letely demanded and
required the things celestyall the which thou have lost / and the which
renou^ceth the and thy power and thy world in desiring the life eternal.
Depart thou then fortwith for the coming of the holy ghost the which of the
sovereign hau^es of heaven will descend in to his holy temple / the which
shall be ano^e by the holy baptem purefyed. And him lyked to put out all thy
frauds and decepcyons / and him deliver from all the sins of times past to
ye end that he may for ever give thankynges and blessings unto y^ right high
name of god in the world of worlds.

For the man and for the woman.
GO forth spyryte and dampened I the conjure and command in the name of the
fader / and of the sone / and of the holy ghost from him or her the seruytour
or servant of god. O acursyd and condampned he the makes by my commandment
the which upon the wawes of water walked surely and he that delivered saint
Peter that he were not drowned surely. Ergo maledicte.

GOd of light and of virtue lord omnypotent and eternal I require thy right
Just pity upon this thy seruytour or servant / and that it may please the him
or her to illumyne by true entendement and him or her cleanse and sanctifye by
knowledge to that that he be worthily dysposed to receive the grace of thy holy
baptem. Per dn^m.

The exposicyon.
BE thou incertayne sathanas that pains torments and waylynges eternal
approach unto the. For the day of Jugement whereof thou owe to meruayll and
fere / as man does a brennynge oven enbraced with fire / at which day thou
and all thyn angeles apostates shall be eternally and fynaly condampned. And
for so much accursyd and lately dampened / the which again at the said day of
Jugement shall be condampned / give honor unto god the fader and unto Jhesu
christ his sone and unto the holy ghost / in y^ name and in the virtue of the
which fader and so^e and holy ghost. I ye command how be it yt you be acursyd
spirit fedynge yt you go thy ways and depart from this the servant of god /
the which our blessed savior Jhesu christ as at this day wylled to call unto
his holy grace and benediccyon / and unto the holy font of baptem to y^ end
y^ he be made the temple of god by the water of regeneracyon in remyssyon of
all sy^nes / in y^ name and in y^ virtue of the same our lord Jhesu christ y^
which with the holy ghost shall come for to Juge the living and deed and this
present world amen. These things beforsayd made and acco^plysshed axen y^
name of the child and takes the spetell of his mouth upon his thombe / and in
touching y^ right eere the nosetrylles and y^ left eere of y^ said child
saying unto right eere. Effeta / yt which is as much to say make opening
unto y^ nosetrylles speak. In swetnes of odor. Unto y^ left eere saying. Flee
you devil incontinent / for thy Jugement aprocheth. By the right eere to us may
betoken yt wylfully we should here good doctrine / y^ which unto us is
signified by the spetell of the priest. By y^ spetell put in to y^ nosetrylle
y^ which receyuen good odor by y^ which the brain is comforted unto us is
signified y^ swetnes and pleasure yt a good spirit ought to take in holy
doctrine. By y^ which he for^efyeth him against all temptacions. By y^
coniuraco^n y^ which is made unto y^ left eere is understand y^ he ought to
put out of us all evil thoughts and evil operacyons to show all occasyon
the which might stere us unto ylle. And when the person is in such
dysposycyon he is worthy to be received to the company of faithful christian men
/ and unto him one may say this fair word of the gospel. Enter Euge s^ru^
bon^ et fidelis intra in gaudium dni^ tui* Mathei.xxv.
now in to the Joye of thy lord Jhesu christ. And therefore these things done
and accomplysshed / they enter in to the church with the little child
saying. Pater noster and Credo in deum / of the which shall be spoken here
after more play^^y. And afterward the ^hilde is brought upon the holy
fontayne / and the priest demau^deth again to here the name of the child. And
when one him has named / than he demanded him / renou^cest thou Satan. And
one answers for him. I renounce Satan. Again the priest demands
Renouncest thou all his works. And one answers for him. I renounce all all
the works of the devil. Yet again the priest demands / renou^cest thou
all the pompes of the devil. And one answers. I them renounce. And this
renuncyacyon done / the priest him makes the cross of the hallowed oil the
which is the oil of the cathecuminus on the breast and between the sholders
saying. I the anoynte with y^ oil of health in y^ breast and between the sholders
in y^ virtue of our lord J^u christ / to y^ end that thou have everlasting
life in the world of worlds amen. Also it is to be noted that many of the
mysteryes before said be done at y^ church door and not wtin / for to show y^
none may be of the no^bre of faithful cryste^ men nor enter in y^ church of
the royalme of paradyse / if he be not purefyed from all grrour the which is
understand by the cathecysme / and from all sin the which is understand by
the exorcysme. Also by the renunciacions is given to understand that he
renou^ceth specially unto three sins. That is unto pride / unto coueytous /
and unto lechery / or unto sin the which is all oonly at will / and unto him
the which is in will and in operacyon withoutforth. Also by ye token of the
cross in the breast is sygnyfyed the love of Jhesu christ / and of his holy
passion the which the good christian man ought to have in his heart and in his
will. By the token of the cross between ye sholders upon the which man
bears the burden / is sygnyfyed the obedyence of the.x. commandments For as
no thing it is said that he loves Jhesu Qui dicit se nosse deu^ and ma^data
e^us no^ custodit inendax est. Johis.xii.
christ or that he is a christian man if he keep not his commandments. By the
holy font where the child is brought / to us is given to understand and
signified the blessed mystery of y^ passion in the cross for there is it
found the fontayne of eternal life in the which the child is wasshen bayned
and purefyed from the tache and meselerye of all sin / and the yate of
paradyse to him is opened / and unto that sygnifycacyon our lord wylled that
his holy side to him were opened. Out of y^ which issued blood and water in
great habundau^ce / to the end that he showed that by the blood the pain /
and by the water the gylte unto us ben by the holy baptem all enterly pardonned
/ for if a person had lived an hundred years before that he had been baptyfed
/ and in those hundred years / he had slain fader and mother and done all the
sins that may be said or thought / and afterward he comed in true intencyon
unto holy baptem / and if yt he deye incontinent, after the baptem / or live a
long time without mortal sin and venyall / and dye in this estate / it is
in the innocence of baptem / he should go all right unto paradyse without any
pain suffryng for the sins be foresaid / for the pains is lately paid by ye
price of the blood of Jhu christ and the yate open / by the which theris no
lettynge to enter the realm of paradyse. And upon this may some thy^ke or make
aquestyo^ A questyon.
if it should be a profitable thing to dyffer the baptem till yt yt one sees
him in some article of death. and makes hy^ to be baptized for to have
remissyon of pain and of gylte of all the sins of times past the answer. It
is more worth to be baptized and to The answer
live from yought in crystyente / for the good yt one does before the baptem is
not merytorious nor worthy of any remuneracion eternal in paradyse By the
which after yt as says Frau^ces de maronis / it is more worth to a person
the which has lived an hundred years in this world / and there has done no
good in all these hundred years but to say one pater noster in the state of
g^ce than to be a.L. M. year in purgatory and afterward to have the hyre of the
said pater noster / than to be baptized in the end of an hundred year and than
for to go without purgatory al right in to paradyse without the merit of the said
pater noster. And the reason of yt is such for the hyre of the pater noster
said in the state of grace shall be infynyte / and the said pain of the hundred
year shall be infynyte. Now is it all clear yt it is more better to seche good
tresour infynyte / then to show temporal pain having an end all be it that
it be great. And so it appears yt the ymagyna cyon to abide him to baptyse
till unto the end of his life for to have plain remyssyon of pain and of
gylte it should not be reasonable sure nor profitable.

AFter these things above said done and acco^plysshed / the priest inquired
again the name of the child / the which name herd and reherced he hy^
demanded John peter or otherwise. Byleuest you in god the fader o^nypotent
creator of heaven and oferthe. Than the child by the mouth of the godfad and
godmod should answer Credo. That is to say truly so I believe. Yet again yc
priest axed. Byleuest you in Jhesu christ the sone of god the fader sovereign
lord and that for us wylled to be borne and deye / ye answer so I believe.
Byleuest you in the holy ghost / the holy church catholyke / the co^munyon of
saints / the remyssyon of sins / the resurreccyon of ye body / the life
eternal. Than the priest demanded in the name of all the holy church what
demau^dest you / they answer the holy baptem. Also ye priest demanded / wylt
you be baptized / as if he would say you demau^dest of god and of holy church a
great thing. The answer. I will and desire to be a christian man. Also the
priest axed wylt you be baptized. The answer. I require it. Then the priest
demanded his name / the which herd and known he puts water on his heed
three times saying. I baptyse y^ in the name of the fad and of the sone and of
the holy ghost ame^. Upon these things beforsayd one myt demand wherefore the
priest axed so often and by so Gaudete aute^ quam nomia vestra scripta sunt in
celis. Luce.x.
many times the childs name. The answer it is for to teache and to show as
how by ye holy baptem y^ child is written and named in paradyse / in so much
yt all the saints of heaven as of this world or of purgatory hy^ receive in to
the company and participaco^n of there prayers and merytes as long as he will
keep the noble state yt he promised and received. Also he is again named to ye
co^fusyon of ye devil of hell again whom he entered in to the field for to fight
/ and it is written and regystred in ye wages and souldery of ye holy king of
glory Jhu christ / for all holy church from hy^beneth is aided and strengthed by
every little child Maius g^udiu^ erit i celo super vno pe^catore penitentia^

baptized and all holy church and ye company of paradyse receyuen a new Joye
and gladness / and god is praised and glorified in the heue^s. Also a man may
axe a questyon wherefore he is demanded if he believe in the fad in the sone and
in the holy ghost. The answer. A questyon.
For in yt is contained all ye substance of our faith Docete oe^s ge^tes

and in the virtue and might of yt blessed infynyte trynyte / he ought to
receive the vtue and theffect of the holy baptem. Also wherefore it is demanded
hy^.iij. times if he will be baptized / and.iij. times he answered I will be
baptized. The answer. For to A questyon.
show yt he ought a steadfast will to be crystened in the depnes of his heart
without having ficcion in his Lord credit adiusticia^ ore autem confessio fit ad
saiute^ Ad romanos. x.
word and confession / and to show it by his conuersacyon by good operacyon
and example. Also wherefore the water is put on hy^.iij. times saying. I baptyse
the in the name of ye fad / and of the sone / and of ye holy ghost. The
answer. It betokened by the water of A questyon.
baptem he is wasshen and cleanse from all sin / be it of w^rde / of deed / or
of thought / be it mortal / actual / or ^enyall. Also for this mystery is
made in the name of al ye blessed trynyte as it is said. And of yt we have a
figure in the baptem of our lord Jh^u christ where all the blessed trynyte
showed sensybly. God the fader in boys the which came from Si q^s diligit me
sermone^ meu^ seruabit and pt^ meus diliget eu^: and ad eum veniem^ and mansio
ne^ apud eu^ faciemus. Johi^s. xiiii.
heaven / saying of the person of Jh^u christ. Here is my right dear sone / god
the sone showed hy^ in our humanyte / and god the holy ghost in semblau^ce of a
do^^e / and hy^ set and put above the holy Jh^u christ / and the h^uen apered
open to show and to signifye that the fad and the sone and the holy ghost
descenden and abyded in the soul baptized. The which by baptem is made and
dysposed the temple of the holy trynyte till unto yt yt she consented unto
mortal sin. And theris tongue nor ymagynacion yt may say think or declare
the beauty of a soul after the baptem / and to hy^ is given a spirytuel token
yt these theologie^s call caractere / the which may never be defaced be In
baptismo confir matione and ordinibus im(...) caracter no^ in aliis sacramentis.
he saved or dampened after yt he has been baptized the which token shall be to
the great confusyon of those yt be dampened / and unto the great honor and
glory of those yt be blessed / as shall be temporal the lyuery a great lord
given lyberally unto a man of low condycyon.

Here follows the virtue and theffect of baptem in the soul baptized.
BY the sacrament of baptem comes. xij. goodnesses Caplm.iiij.
unto the soul / of the which. iiij. unto us be signified by. iiij.
propretees ye which be in ye water. yt one is such yt by ye wa^ one cleansed
things fylthy and unclean. By the baptem the soul is pure fyed and made clean
from all ordure of sin. The water gives refrygeracyon. The baptem takes and
coleth the inclynacyon and the corrupcyon the which is abiding in humayne
nature for ye gylt of origynall sin / for if two childer of like complexion /
of the which yt one should be baptized and that other not. I put that he wend
to be were they nourysshed together / he yt was not baptized shall be more
inclyned to ylle and more hard in doctrine the^ he baptized. Also the water
quenched and owted the thyrste. The baptem refeccyoneth the soul and keeps it
from dryenge and from death. Also ye water causes the earth to bear and
fructefye. The baptem causes the soul to fructefye spyrytually in good works
/ in virtues and in merytes. Also by ye baptem the soul received ye lyuery /
the token / and ye caracter before said. Also he received distinccyon with these
paynems and not baptized. Also he received augme^tacyon of grace and light of
knowledge spirytuell / and is incorporat and united with holy church the which
is ye mystycall body of Jhesu christ. Also he is quyte and assoyled of the
obligacyon in the which every person not baptized is bounden. Also by ye
baptem is the yate of heaven opened. After these things before said the priest
makes the cross with the holy creme upon ye forhede of him that is baptized /
in namynge him and making such prayer.

GOd almighty fader of our savior Jhesu christ the which the regenerat by the
water of baptem with the blessed holy ghost / and the ye which the pardonned all
thy sins give the now the name of ye holy creme / and y^ make the membre of
Jh^u christ / and the promytte eternal life amen. Here is to be noted yt the
holy creme is composed of bame and of oil united and sanctefyed by ye
benediccion of the bishop. By ye bame y^ which keeps all manner of flesh
from rottynge and from corrupcyon / to us is signified y^ soul the which
gyued life unto ye body / and keeps it from rottynge during ye time yt it is
united with the body. By ye oil to us is signified the body. And by ye bishop
unto us god is represented ye which these things of so much dyfference yt is
ye body and ye soul has united and assembled and given his ^^e and benediccyon
unto humayne nature. And for so much sayen these doctors yt a simple priest
supposing yt he had baptized ye child should not set yt cross of ye holy
creme in ye presence of ye bishop / if it were not by his special
commandment / and yt is for the holiness of ye creme and of the mystery and of
the benediccyon the which by yt is signified. Also it is to be noted that this
cross made and given unto the new christian man is the seventh cross and the
last that is set on his body / or the fourteneth in this mystery in
acou^tynge these other seven the which be made in ye exorcysaco^n of the salt
the which is put in his mouth. By ye salt the which unto us be tokeneth
wisdom / we understand consequently the soul / and so there be made seven
crosses as unto ye body / and as many unto the soul / and they be fourtene
Forther more it is to be considered yt it sygnifyed the nombre of seven ye
whithe betokened the cross And unto that says saint Gregory yt by the nombre
of seven vniuersyte to us is sygnifyed. For all things that god has made be
they corporell or spirytuell / may be brought and devised in seven. Of these
corporell there be seven planetes unto the body celestyall the which have*
their influence puyssau^ce operacyon and gouernynge upon these things a low.
Also there be seven ages in all the world / seven Qui em^ septe^ diebus o^ne
temp^ co^prehendit: recte septenario numeto vniuersitas de signat. Hec Gr^.
days in the weke and no mo / seven sacraments in the holy church / seven
gifts of the holy ghost / seven works of mercy / seven deedly sins. And
also of other things y^ which may be brought unto seven / by y^ which a man
may well know yt by the nombre of seven to us is signified vnyuerlyte. Also by
ye token of ye cross in what so ever manner yt it be made / be it in wood / in
stone / in gold and in silver or with ye hand or otherwise / ye passion of yt
blessed Jh^u christ to us betokened / by y^ which he has had victory of all
his adversaries unto his enmyes confusyon. Also has rescuwed and delivered
humayne lygnage / broken ye yates of hell / and opened the realm of paradyse.
And for to speak shortly / all ye goodnesses of g^ce of benedicco^n and of
glory proceden of ye depnesses of ye blessed passion / and therefore of good
right all faithful christian men ought to receive ye token of y^ cross for
honor / for tryu^phe / for it is ye shield and defense against all our
adversaries. That is to know ye world the devil / and our sensualyte or
poryde / coueytous / and lechery. Wherefore in ye mystery of baptem ye new
knight entryng in to y^ batell of crystyente against these three adversaries
before said / takes and receives the souls / and the lyuerey of blessed Jhesu
christ chyef duke and capytayne of al them that been chosen. By the which arms
well kept he shall have knowledge defense and vyctorye in all things /
wherefore of good right it is sygned seven times as unto ye body and seven as
unto the soul / whereof that of the creme is the last and the sovereign. For by
that he is proprely called a christian man / ye which is as much to say as
anointed / or of god consecrated. And therefore when these childer of these
christian men be put unto scole for to learn conning / unto them is given for
the beginning and for the fundacyon of all wisdom / crystis cross / for to
show yt inco^paryson of the knowledge of the cross / is always to be
understand his passion. All other scyences erthely or worldely is but folly /
all noblenes as vylany / all richesse as pouerte / all delytes be not but as
bytternesses / and temporal life the beginning of death Afterward the priest
gives unto the child the crysome above his heed unto him saying. Take now
the white leuery the which is without spote the which thou may keep and
bear at the great day of Jugement / the which our lord Jhesu christ shall
hold / unto whom be honor and glory in the world of worlds amen. Also unto
him gives the priest a taper brennynge in his right hand saying unto him.
Take now this light ye which is without reproach / keep thy baptem / keep thy
commandments / to the end that when our lord shall come for to make these
weddynges / whereof these promysses be made by this holy baptem thou them may
receive as the faithful spouse of thy soul in ye company of all ye saints of
paradyse / in the which y^ may live eternally in the world of worlds amen.
By these three things done after the baptem / that is of the crysome / of the
creme / and of the light be signified great things spirituell / For by the
creme received in toke^ of the cross the which is the propre token where the
arms be of Jhesu christ / and is signified yt he is named the cryste^ brother of
Jhesu christ in arms / and part taker and enherytour with him in the realm of
paradyse. And Nota.
it is to be noted that auncyently four manner of people all oonly be anointed
with the holy vnccyon that is to know these kings / these knights / these
priests / and these prophets / the which thing is done in token and figure
of faithful christian men. The which anointed with the holy creme may say
truly kings if they govern truly the realm of their conscience and the
estate of their vocacyon / for if they have in this present battle victory of
the world / of the devil / and of their sensualyte they shall be crowned as
noble kings and knights / and so shall have total and peasyble possessyon of
the realm of paradyse. Also they may be said sacerdotales the which is as
much to say as enryched and ennobled with holy mysteryes. Now it is so that
the christian man the which has three noble virtues in the soul / that is faith
/ hope / and charity has the gifts of the holy ghost / and is the habytacyon
and temple of all the holy trynyte / by the which he may well be named priest
or sacerdotal. Also prophets is much to say as they that see and know
things to come. And the good christian man by the light of faith says and
considered the pains of hell / by the which he showed all ylle and all
sin. Also he sees and considered the shortness of this life and the great
glory of paradyse / by the which he hasted and enforced him to accomplysshe
good works and merytoryous / by the which he may come unto so great goodness.
And in accomplysshynge these two things / that is to flee ylle and to do good
/ he gives good example unto his neighbors / by the which he preched better
than he the which is in the chair and declared these holy wrytynges / when
the life and the works of such a prechour ben contraryous to the
commandment of god By the crysome is signified the beauty and the innocencye
of the soul / the which is annorned and ennobled with all virtues / as the
noble spouse of Jhesu christ. Also by that is signified the beauty and the do
wars of the body after the resurreccyon / for it shall be more shynynge than
the son. It sygnyfyed Fulge bu^t ^usti sicut sol in co^spectude^. Luceat lur
vestra cora^ hoi^bus vt vide ant opera vestra ^ona. Mathe^. v.
also the dyademe or the crown ryall. By the light the which ought to be in
the hand / and not in the mouth or between the feet is sygnyfyed the example
of good works / by the which work every good christian man ought to be light
before the world. By the right hand often a man understands the good
works. And therefore as after these holy mysteryes done and acco^plysshed / the
little child is the child of god and of the holy church / he will not it leave
without keeping and nourysshynge. For not withstanding by the mercy of god he
be clean from all sin / and replenysshed with all virtues and of beauty
inestymable as unto the soul. How be it by the Justyce of god he abides
subget unto the body / unto hungre / unto thyrste / unto cold / unto heete /
and unto many diverse manners of sykenesses the which ben abiding for to seche
y^ more gretter merytes in this world if that it be not by our defaute. And
like wise as unto the soul / he abides subget unto ignorance / unto
concupyscence / and unto malice sooner than unto good. By the which it is
necessary to give him to keep and conduyte for to provide for these
inconuenyences before said. And in as much the godfader and godmoder ben
pledges and makes good for him holy church them enjoined comenly / to provide
him as well unto the necessyte of the body as of the soul. And they be bound
in case that the fader Illi ^ pro baptisa^dis i baptismo sp^ponderu^t.

and the mother natural do not that that is of necessyte. And in as much that
at this day full few there be that them acquyte / they ben in great blame
before god. The common people great and small abyden in three peryllous
ignorau^ces / as well of artycles as of the commandments of our holy faith
Many faders and moders ben much desirous to nourysshe / to clothe / and to
make purchasses / and to gyder goods for the bodies of their childern. But
right few there be the which think on the soul in techynge them and making
them to keep the doctrine and the life of holy crystyente. But unto the contrary
unto them they give all evil example. And in so much that the child is more
inclyned to ylle than to good / notwithstanding the grace of baptem as soon
as he comes to have discrecyon and vsau^ce of vndstandynge / and he fynded hy^
in Lata est via q^ (...) cit ad perdition^.
the place to chose ye way unto hell or to paradyse He takes sooner ye way

more large and more comen / than he does the little pathe of paradyse. And if
one demand in what age the child may and ought upon pain of sin chose the
good and flee the ylle. Theris moo yt may for all put a comen rule / for one
has some time more greter capacyte at four or five year / then another at
seven or eight. And therefore it behooves yt one watch on them with great
desire and dyscrecion to the end that they be put in the right pathe and Ubi

good way when they shall come by age unto the before said discrecyon. But how
show the fader and the mother the good way unto the child the which go
themself by the ylle way. And therefore by the defaute of fader and mother right
few therbe of the childern in our time the which keep until. x. or. xij.
year the tresoure of Innocencye of holy baptem. Cu^ i^mundus spu^s exierit ab

And unto that attends well the devil / the which has so great pain and
so great confusyon as has been before said / has been put in and put out of his
lodging. And therefore us aduysed and teched the blessed Jhesu christ in the
gospel saying / that when the devil has been put out of a person / he
takes great pain and dylygence thither to return / and takes. vij. spirytes
worse then he is / and comes with such company and right often fyndeth ye yate
open and without resystence he entered again / from whens he was departed / and
than yt person is in wors state then before. By this we may understand that
the sinner be he old or young that after the holy baptem returned unto sin
is from the most gretest pain remedyed and the devil chased from his
conscience by the sacrament of penance / as when he was first baptized. Than
for to aid them that be R^^istite fortes ^ ^ide. i. pe. vlt.

Here follows the declaracyon of the.xij. artycles of the faith in the which
shall be holden such order. First there shall be declared in few words and
general what the faith is and the goodness ye which thereof comes unto these
faithful christian men Secondely every article in partyculer shall be declared
and the work answering unto every article for as no thing has he promised
the faith the which it showed not by good and holy works.

Here follows the faith catholyke. Caplm. v.
AS unto the first ti is to understand that Caplm. v.
there ben three virtues theologales and infuses. Nu^e aute^ mane^tspes fides
caritas tria hec: mayor a^t horum e^ caritas. i. ad corinth. xiii.
That is to know faith / charity / and hope / the which ben called infuses /
for that that whhan the soul is puryfyed by baptem from origynall sin god
creates and puts these three virtues in the soul / by the which she has
dysposycyon to be the temple and the habytacyon of the holy trynyte. Charity by
some approbacyon is against the fader. Faith is against the sone. Hope is against
the holy ghost. Of charity shall be spoken in the first commandment. Of hope
in the third. And Fides e^ suda^ re^^ supera^darum angme^tu^ no^ apparenti^ Ad
hebre. xi.
here presently of the Faith the which* is named the substance or fundacyon
of all spyrytuell huyldynges / for without faith it is impossyble to please
god. Wherefore says Athanasius. Who so ever Quicu^que vult saluus esse ak oia
opus e^ vt teneat catholica^ fide^ qua^ nisi ^sque ite gra^ iuiolata^que
seruauerit ^b sque dubio i eternu^peribit. Athanasius in symbolo.
will be saved it behooved him first that he hold entyerly and vndefyledly the
trought of the faith catholyke / of the which virtue comes four pryncypall
goodnesses in to the soul. The first for it is the mean by the which the
soul is espoused and united with god. By the which marriage the soul is
ennobled infynytly and more than understanding created neither may ymagen /
and the faith ought in him or in other proceed the baptem. Wherefore our lord
says in the gospel. Teache Docete oe^s ge^tes baptisa^tes eos etc. Ibide^. Hec
e^ vita eterna vt cognosca^t te solu^ verum deuin and que^ misit i^su^ xp^m.
Io. xvii. Declina a malo and fac bonu^. p^s. xxxvi Justus ex fide viuit.
Aba^uth. ii. et ad to. i. Declina a maio etc Sa^cti per fide^ viceru^t regna

ye / that is for to understand the faith first and the baptysynge following.
Secondely the faith and the beginning and the yate of eternal life. The life
eternal after that as the gosspell says / and know god the fader and Jhesu
christ his sone / the which thing we may do in this present mortal life /
but by the faith the which is the first beginning to see and to know him
face to face in paradyse / and therefore the faith is not of things yt we see
and know naturally. Thyrdely a reasonable person knows yt god is right
Just for to punysshe all ill / and souere^tly god for to reward all goodnesus
/ wherefore he is induced to do well and to flee ill and sin / ye which
thing is perfyte Justyce / and all the rule of good life. Fourthly by the faith
man has victory of all his adversaries / yt is of the devil / of the world /
and of the flesh / of the which is written that by the faith all the saints
of paradyse ^e^ est victoria q^ vincit mundu^ fides nostra. Io. v. In oi^bus
stime^tes scutum fidei. Ad ephesios. vi.
have had victory. The faith tells us that honors rychesses and other goods
and pleasurs worldely passen / and ben tranlytory and dangerous wherefore we
them dyspraysen. The faith unto us says that in hell theris all evil
wherefore we it fere / and that in paradyse is all goodness wherefore we it
desire. And this is as unto the first and in general of the goodnesses that
the faith does one good christian man.

Here follows the substance and dyuysyon of the.xij. artycles of the faith
the.vi. chapter.
AS unto the second point for to declare Caplm.vi.
what is to be seen of every article in partyculer / it is to know that these
artycles of our holy faith some time ben taken and dystyncted after the nombre
of the.xij. apostles the which made first the Credo. And so there ben oonly
twelve. Or other wise it may be dyuysed after as the seven artycles
appertaynynge unto the dyuynyte / and seven unto the humanyte of Jhesu christ.
And so there ben.xiiij. the which a man may so show. For that that which we
should believe of the humanyte appertains unto the essence and unity of the
dyuynyte. That is for to say yt we should believe that there en is but one god
/ and not tweyne or many. And it is the first article in that that we say.
Credo in deum. Or Credo in vnum deu^. That is to say. I believe in one god and
not in many. Where it appertains unto the persons of the blessed trynyte.
And so ye article of god the fader unto us is signified in that that we say
proatrem o^nipotente^. I believe in the fader omnypotent The article of god the
so^^ in that that we say. Et in iesum xp^m filiu^ eius. That is to say. I
believe in Jhesu christ the sone of god the fader. The article of god the holy
ghost in that that we say. Credo in spiritu^ sanctu^. That is to say. I
believe in god the holy ghost. And so there ben four artycles. These other three
of the seven the which appertain unto the diuinyte ben as in regard of ye
three pryncypal operacyons withoutforth. That is creacyon / redempcyon / and
glorificacyon the which apperteynen all only unto ye blessed trynyte. Creacyon
of all things is granted unto the fader / in that that it is said. Creatore^
celi et terre. I believe in god y^ fader creator of heaven and of earth. That is
to say of all things be they corporell or spirytuell. Redempcyon is granted
unto Jhesu christ by the sacraments and union of holy church. And that unto us
is signified in that that is said. Sancta^ ecclesia^ catholica^. sanctorum
comunione^* remissione^ peccatorum. That is to say. I believe in the holy
church catholyke. Or universally y^ being of all saints and the remyssyon of
sins. In this article ben comprehended and understand all the sacraments of
holy church. Of the which I think all oonly to speak in partyculer of baptem
/ and of penance as well for cause of shortness / as also of necessyte of these
two sacraments. The operacyon to give the glory the which all these blessed
have now / and that we trust is given unto the holy ghost / and that we believe
in saying. Carnis resurrectione^ vitam eternal amen. I believe that we shall
arise and that these true christian men shall have the everlasting Qui bona
egeru^t ibu^t i^ vita^ eternal ^ vero mala in igne^ eternal. Athanasius in
symbolo.
life / and in like wise these that been acursyd shall have dampnacyon without
end. And we should not understand that god the fader has made y^ creacyon
without god the sone / and without the blessed holy ghost. For they have not
but one might infynyte. And in like wise of the redempcyon and gloryficacyon.
For these things appertaynen unto the dyuynyte / the which is one and not
divided in many. And appears clearly that the creacyon and gubernacyon of all
the world and the redempcyon of humayne lygnage / and the gloryficacyon of
them that been saved proceden of all the blessed trynyte. and so there ben.vij.
artycles appertaynynge unto the dyuynyte / and these other unto the humanyte.
Ego hodie genuite. ps.^^. Generatione^ eius ^s enar^a^it. ysaie.^iij.
The first is of the blessed incarnacyon / where as we say. Qui conceptus est
de spiritu sancto. That is to say that the virgyn Marie conceived y^ sone of
god by the virtue of the holy ghost. The second is of the Natyuyte in yt yt is
said. Natus ex maria virgin. That is to say that we believe that he ye which
proceeds of god the fader by eternal and incomparable generacyon / is borne
by natural Natyuyte of her ye which always is virgyn as well before the
childynge as after. The third is of his passion in that that is said. Passus
sub poncio pylato. That is to say that we believe that the sone of the virgyn
Marie very god and very man was crucefyed and suffered death and passion under
the sentence and Jugement of the bishop pylate / and was buried. The fourth
is. Descend^^ ad inferna. That is to say that Jhesu christ descended in to
hell / and was in lymbo where were these holy persons the which had byleued
in his coming and were deed in the estate of grace. And it is to be
understand that he descended as unto the soul united with the dyuynyte / for
the body abode in the tomb the space of forty hours without life. The fyfth
is to believe / that he arose the third day in that that it is said. Tercia
die resurrexit a mortuis. And a man should not understand that he was deed
three days entyre / for that should be by three score and twelve hours / but he
was deed part of the frydaye / all the Saterdaye / and part of the Sunday*
the which three parts ben forty hours. The sixte is / that the fourtyest
day after his resurreccyon / he ascended in to heaven / and set him on the
right hand of god the fader / in the which is said. Ascendit ad celos sedet
ad dexteram dei patris omnipotentis. And the seventh is / that he shall come for
to Juge the quycke and the deed / and is in that that is said. Inde venturus
est iudicare viuos et mortuos. And so it appears clearly that there ben
fourtene artycles unto whom them he will so assygne and deuyse. But all is
comprehended and brought unto twelve contained and put in to the Credo that the
apostles made / the which every man ought for to know that has age and
dyscrecyon. And also he ought for to know the Pater noster / the Aue maria /
and Confiteor. The Pater noster for to beseech and axe charity. The Aue maria
for to seche hope. The Credo for to have and know ye faith promised unto
baptem. The Confiteor for to accuse him and require pardon of his sins and
defautes. And a doctor says named Linchorence that these christian men ought to
know the Pater noster / the Aue maria / and the Credo in their langage
maternall. That is to say the Frenshe man in france / the English man in
english / and so of other. And in as much I shall put the latin of every
article of the said Credo. And afterward the english and the declaracyon of
the work the which ought to be in every true christian man for to answer unto
every article. For the holy scripture says / that that faith ought to be said
Fides sine operibus mortua est. Ia. ii.
deed the which bears not the fruit of good works. And he that has not the
good works of a christian man ye faith is no thing worth. But for the faith
promised and not kept by good life and holy operacyons shall be more grievous
and more sharp of dampnacyon of an ylle christian man / than of a sarrasyn or a
payneme.

Here follows every article in partyculer and of the work for to answer. And
fyrstely of the first the which is such.
CRedo in deu^ petre^ omnipotente^ creatore^ celi Caplm. vij.
et terre. That is to say. I believe in god Res nolunt male disponi ideo vnus
princeps. Ari. xii. nietha.
the fader omnypotent creator of heaven and of earth Also it is to be noted that
it is an another thing after these doctors / to believe god / to believe of god
and to believe in god. For these mysbyleuers and pay nems believe that god is.
These evil christian men Credere deu^ e^ credere ip^m ee^. credere deo est
credere ee^ vera q^ dicit. credere in deu^ e^ credere and credendo i^ eu^ per
amore^ tendere. Hec augus. in li. de verbis dni^.
that believe that these wrytynges ben holy and true and do the contrary / they
believe god and of god and not in god. But these good christian men the which by
their charity keep the commandments by leave well god / of god / and in god.
And that is of necessyte. For he that says that he byleueth in god and keeps
not his commandments lies falsely. Qui dicit se nosce deu^ and ma^data eius
non custodit mendax est. Io. i.
In like wise as holy scripture says. Who so ever byleued in god parfectly /
byleued that in him is sovereign goodness and infynyte. And for so much that
every creature Si ^s diligit me sermone^ meu^ seruabit. Io. xu.
desired appetyted and loved good thing / it behooved that a creature reasonable
love god and him appetyte soueraynly / for in him is bonte infynyte. Diliges
dn^m deu^ tuu^ ex toto cord tuo et ex tota ai^a tua and ex totis viribus tuis
and ex omni me^te tua. Luce. x. Qui ex vobis patre^ petit pane^. nu^qid lapides
dabit illi. aut pisce^ nunqid pro pisce serpente^ dabit illi. aut si petierit
ouu^ nu^qid porriget ei scorpione^. Si ergo vos cu^ scitis mali nosc^ bona dare
filiis no ^^ri^ quamto magis pater vester celestis de celo dabit spiritu^ bonu^
petentibus se. Luce. xi.
And if it be so / he shall keep above all things his commandments the
which may not be but good and for good syns that they proceed of the bonte
infynyte. And he that does the contrary / is he that keeps not the
commandments / he lived not good merytoriously after as god him has
commanded saying. Thou sholdest love god with all thyn heart / with all thy
thought / and with all thy might. Whereof says a doctor named Prosper / he
that loved god is often thinking on hy^ desiring to come unto his blessed
vysyon / having sin in hate in anoyau^ce ^i charge and these honors and
pleasurs of the world / and these rychesses to disprayse in comparyson of the
love of god our creator / and of the goods the which be without end. The
cause to love god above all thing is his bonte infynyte / and for as much
that he is our fader omnypotent wherefore he loved us his childer and not of
other love than of love infynyte. And in as much that he is almighty it
behooved that he make and that he give goods unto his childern after the love
of the which he them loved / they ben goods and glory that no heart it may
think ne no tongue can it declare. the which he unto us may give by his
sovereign might / by the which he has created and made heaven and earth. He
can well make it by his great wisdom and he will by his bonte and pyteous
buxomnes. By the which every man ought for to enforce him to believe and to
have hope to the end for to come unto the augmentacyon of charity and of holy
and merytoryous works. For as saint Gregory says / as much as the faith
greueth hope is augmented / and as much as man has of dyspayre / man wants
of charity and after the good and holy operacyons. And so these three things
ben always egall as unto the proporcion that every of these virtues ought to
have. And therefore after the great or little man may truly understand and
know what faith / what charity / and what hope is in the person and none
other wise. And therefore says our lord Jhesu christ in the gospel that man
knowith the tree after the fruit that it bears be it good or evil. By the
the fruit that proceeds of the tree menynge the bo^de or the flower and the
leef / be intended the works the which proceden of the heart and of his will
either of the faith as the fruit of the tree. In like wise than Fides fine
o^ib^ inortua est. Ia. ii.
as there ben twelve artycles dystyncted / it behooves that there are also
twelve fruytes or twelve works mery^oryous and every of them for to answer
unto his article. The work of this present article after the mortalyte is
childely fere / or amerous fere. The which thing unto us is showed and given
to know and to understand in that Si ego du^^ssi vbi timor me?: si pa^vbi
honor. Malachie. i. Per timore^ din declinat ois homo a malo. Item. Qui timet
deu^ faciet bona. Eccliastici. xv.
that is said. Deum patrem omnipotentem. Fere is due unto god the which is
Just infynyte. And love unto the fader almighty fader of mercy and of bonte
infynyte. And who so ever shall have the faith of this article in his heart and
the work as it is said he shall habounde in good works withoutforth and shall
show evil and sin in like wise as says holy scripture. And man ought to
believe that the faith of this article is deed that bears not here the fruit
of this work.

Here follows the.ij. article that is such.
AT in iesum cristum filium eius vnicum do minum nostrum. That is to say. I
believe in Jhesu christ our sovereign lord the sone of god the fader. And in
that a man ought to understand that he is semblable and egall unto the fader
in all things the which appertaynen unto the deite and is one self essence in
dyuynyte as well the fader as the sone / and also the holy ghost / for he is
not but one god. But that blessed and that Infynyte and incomprehensyble
dyuynyte is one in three persons. Faciamus holem ad ymagine^ and similitudine^
nostra^. Genesis. i.
And notwithstanding that we be made unto the image of that blessed trynyte
pryncypally as unto the soul / in the which there is mind / understanding /
and will / ye which he three myghtes. of the which that one is not that other
/ and always it is not but one essence / or one other. And that by this image
of the trynyte the which is in us / we may somewhat know and search the thing
the which it represented / that is the blessed trynyte. How No^ plus sapere
quam oz sed sapere ad sobrietat^ vnicuique sicut deus dimisit mensura^ fidei.
Ad romanos.xi. Fides e^ substa^tia rerum sperandarum augmentu^ no^ apparentiu^.
Ad heb. (...).
be it we ought to believe symply without to much curyous inquyrynge. For any
may there right grievously sin and offend. And if this faith were not above
all entendement that man may well understand and comprehend in him the
mysterye of the blessed trynyte / he should have neither faith nor merit / nor
by the consequence he might never come unto salvation. For the faith y^ which
is none other thing than that that god has showed / and that he may not nor
ought understand naturally is the beginning and the ground of all salvation.
^er^i e^ de certitudine adhesionis sz no^ speculationis. Non e^ volu^tate
humana allata est aliqu^ ^phetia. sed spu^ sancto inspirati locuti su^t sancti
de^ hoies.li. pet.i.
Wherefore it behooves unto all the most great clerks that ever were to sharp
their natural entendement in these things that touch unto ye hyghnes of our
holy faith / and unto us it ought to suffyse for to know that he may do more
than we may understand. And that we see in every little creature / be it herb
or tree / or other thing / for there was never so great a clerk or philosopher
that might know parfectly all the propretecs / the virtues and the nature of a
little herb. By the which it follows by more greter reason that he may not
naturally know the creature but by the faith the which is more certain
knowledge that is that of natural entendement. For god the which may not lie
unto us has showed his holy wrytynges / the which ben his own words the
which has put in to the heart and in to the mouth of holy prophets apostles
and other. Also by those holy martyrs and confessors the which have holden
and kept y^ trought of this holy faith catholyke / and shed their blood and
received the death Joyously. God has done in their life and after their death
miracles so great and so euydent for to approve the trought of the faith that
in christian man after those said miracles and their predycacyons made solemply
of the trought of our holy faith catholyke ne ought any thing to doubt. For
otherwise he sinned right grievously / neither Vobiscu^ su^ vsque ad
consu^matione^ seculi Math. vltimo. Propietates viroru^ dn^orum Sapientia
pietas vel mia pote^tia et nobilitas iusticia.
it may not be said that he byleued steadfastly in Jhesu christ the very sone of
god the fader and that he doubted in the faith for Jhesu christ the which is
trought infynyte has promised that he shall be with the church and him give unto
ye holy ghost till unto the end of the world. In these words of these
artycles unto us ben showed the.iiij. propretees of ye true seygnourye / yt is
to know wisdom swetnes / or mercy / might and nobles and the fourth is
Justyce. By the which we should have him and auowe for sovereign lord. Than
the first reason is for the wisdom infynyte the which unto us is given for to
understand in this word Jhesum The second is by the swetnes pity and mercy /
the which is sygnyfyed by this word Xpristum. The third is puyssaunce and
nobles the which Hz scriptu^ i^ femore rex regu^ and dn^s dn^antiu^. Apo.xix.

unto us ben sygnyfyed by that that is said filiu^ dei. The fourth is Justyce
the which is sygnyfyed by this word dominu^ nostru^. He is very lord by
creacyon / by redempcyon / and for ye resurreccyon. For there is none other
lord yt may yield unto the body soul and life when one has lost it in his
service except Jhesu christ lord of all lords / king of all kings. The work
of this present article after ye moralyte is obedyence in keeping the
commandments of Jhesu christ / after his intencyon and ye troth that he has
declared in the gospel not all only the intent lyterall and carnal of y^
scrybes and pharysees. For for no thing and without cause called he him his
lord / of whom he will not his commandments. Also it is him to humble and
to love holy pouerte / for who so ever byleued that Jhesu christ is very god and
full of wysedom infynyte he b^leued that in our humanyte and in this present
life he us has given example of all perfeccyon choosing the life and estate the
which is most worth. Now takes he humanyte / obedyence / penance / and
Humiliauit se^^et ip^m factus obedie^s vsque ad mortem: morte^ aute^ cruci^ ^d

pouerte / in showing us to follow him / by the which the good christian man
and catholyke him ought to meke / and all auaryce / usury / rauayne / and
symonye / to forsake / and his propre sensualyte restrain and repreue. Or
else the faith of this article is deed y^ which this work bears not here.

Here follows the.iij. article that is such.

QVi conceptus est de spiritu sancto. natus exmaria virgin. And is as much to
say. I believe that the virgyn Marie conceived the sone of god the fader by the
virtue of the holy ghost and bare child / her virgynyte abiding always save

hole and entyere. And this article is declared more openly in the Credo / the
which a man syngeth when he says the mass where he says that for the love
and for the salvation of humayne nature ye sone of god the fader descended from
the heuens and took our humanyte in the blessed glorious and sacred virgyn
Marie by the virtue of ye blessed holy ghost in making him very man / he is
comen down by humylyte in such wise that many and almoost all the world but
that him reputed as for man / he the which was / is / and shall be very god
almighty. Or else the virgyn Marie should not be a mother if she had not
nourysshed in her womb and borne him the which tre^ely is god. Here is the
hyghnes and perfeccyon of the faith of christian Ego dico tibi (...) tu es petrus
and super ha^c petra^ edificabo ecclesiam mea^. Mathei.xv.
men the which saint Peter confessed and auowed when he said. Tu es xpristus
filij dei viui. Thou art very christ the sone of the lyuende god / in that that
he confessyd christ / he knows him man in that that he called him the sone of
god / he witnesses verily that he is god. And therefore our lord him answers
that auowe that trought that he knows / that is to know humayne nature and
dyuyne to be in one person / he shall found and set the trought of the holy
faith catholyke. The work of this article after the moralyte / is for to
conceive the sone of god spyrytually by the virtue of the holy ghost and of the
holy faith catholyke / In interiori ho^e habitare xp^m per ^^de^ in cordibus
vestris. Ad ephe. iii. Quicunque fecerit volu^tate^ pris mei ^ i celis e^ i^e
meus frat and soror and matter est. Math.xii*
by the mean of the which faith Jhesu christ enhabyted within the conscyences
of the true catholykes / and so excellently that he himself witnesses in the
gospel / the conscience that he received by true faith ought to be said his
mother certain and it is more noble / more dygne / and more holy thing to
conceive him spyrytally / than it should be to conceive hy^ corporally all
only. And such nobles in Felicius concepit maria deu^ mente per fide^ quam
carnis ass^ptione^. Hec aug. li. de ^gi.
one christian man that is to know yt the conscience is ye mother of god / no
tongue may suffycyently speak / nor understanding believe comprehend nor duly
adueruayll. In this depnes these devout and comtemplatyf spyrytes erthely them
ought to prosterne right humbly and the holy ghost by the which he makes
such concepcyon to them shall declare things that may not be said nor written.
Also it is to be noted that humayne nature by the concepcyon and blessed
incarnacyon is honored and exalted much more than nature angelyke in so^
much that god is becomen man and not angel for to prove and show us his
Infynyte love and the way of salvation the which is obedyence and humylyte.
Also in that that our lord borne of his mother / did not unto her any sorrow
or pain / nor yet hurt in making her to lose the tresour of her virgynyte /
unto us is sygnyfyed and showed Honore^ he^dis matris tue oi^bus diebus vite
eius memor ei esse debes q^ and quamta pericule passa sit in vtero suo propter
te Tho.x.
that no good child by his ill and sin / ne ought to wrath his fader and
mother ne them ought to depryue from honor and obedyence that he unto them
ought as well by the commandment of god as of nature. And therefore our lord
has wylled honor unto his right holy mother in heaven and in earth by such
manner that many christian men in like wise have more great hope to find mercy by
mean of the mother than of the sone / and all that has he done in geuynge us
example that the faith of this article is deed that the fruit of honor bears
not unto his fader and mother.

Here follows the.iiij. article that is such.
PAssus sub poncio pylato crucifixus mortuus et sepultus. That is to say. I
believe that Jhesu christ suffered death and passion under ye bishop Pylate so as
it has been said before. Here the true christian man ought to enforce him to
think on ye light of the holy faith. By the which one says these things
dyuyned and these things past / being and to come / what is he that suffered /
what thing he suffered and endured / and wherefore he suffered. And as unto that
it is said now enough certain by these things aforesaid that he the which
suffered is verily god and man the true lamb. The Innocent of god of majesty
and of bonte infynyte / he suffered sorrows in his soul and torment in his body
without nombre and without measure for them that unto hy^ ben the contrary the
which have done the ylle and the sin whereof he bears the pain / of the
which he might no better do / and y^ which of that they may not him worthily
give thanks / and by them seluen the which he has again bought / and the
which were ryally the seruytours of the devil and of sin. And the true
christian man ought to believe Nota s^dm Bon^uen.ix. di.iii. quampo^^ and dz

sicut scie^tia. no^ au^t de cognitione actuali q^ est sicut considerare. Apud

that the soul of Jhesu christ united with the dyuynyte has clear knowledge of
all things past / present / and to com^ / by the which it behooves to
confess that he sees all these sins mortal and other that ever were or
shall be done unto ye end of the world. And in as much that it was the
pleasure and will of all the blessed trynyte that by yt passion was the world
right habundau^tly again bought from eternal dampnacyon. Jhesu christ suffered
and endured partyculer pain for every mortal sin that ever was or shall be
done against the will dyuyne / be it by him that shall be finally sa^^d / or by
him that shall be dampened / and as much great pain as there was / was due
unto every mortal sin / the which thing surmouteth all understanding
create but only that by ye light of the faith we know that he that suffered was
very god. By the which reasonably we consent that if he had not shed by
sorrow and anguysshe but one oonly drop of blood that if it so we^^
soueraynly it suffyseth for to redeem a thousand worlds / and how be it all
oonly he had given but one drop of blood. But by the space of two and
thyrty years and three months he has suffered and endured as well in the womb
of the virgyn Marie / as also syns yt he was borne in this world / labors /
pains / trauayles / in fasting / in prayenge / in temptacyons / in
contradiccyons / and finally the death the most grievous / pyteous / and
dolorous yt heart may think. But the natural folly of heart and of erthely
understanding may say and ymagen that in this the which is here said it is
impossyble to co^tynue for as much that he suffered not but in so much as man
/ and not in such much as god. Wherefore he might not suffer but pain infynyte
/ and full little unto regard of that the which is here purposed / the which
is an hundred times infynyte if it were possible to speak it or ymagen. And on
the other ^ant^ est offensa quam tus e^ ^lle ^ offen^it. ^^to ethicorum.
part it has been said that for every mortal sin that ever was or shall be
done he has borne pain suffycyent for to repair the Iniurye done unto the
majesty dyuyne. The which Iniurye for every sin is infynyte for the ransom
of him the which has offended. For reason and nature it agree that in as
much that he that man offends is most great / the offense and Iniurye done
against him is most great. Now it is enough known y^ god is of the majesty
infynyte / by the which it follows that the offense done against him ought to
be infynyte / and by the consequens the pain due and for to answer unto such
offense / or else god should not be true Juge to da^pne eternally for one
oonly mortal sin him the which by his defaute shall not be again bought by
this blessed passion The answer unto yt folysshe ymagynacyon / the which
always I grant by the light of our holy faith yt y^ he the which suffered is
god / how be it yt he suffered not in so much as god. Also I confess by the
first article and these things beforsayd yt he is almighty as the fader. Also
I confess yt Justyce Secunda^ mensura^ delicti e^^t pl^garum modus.
dyuyne the which may not be changed or varyed required that after the gylte
the pain be mesured Also I grant that Jhesu christ is very redemptor and
suffysaunce of all the world. Wherefore it behooved that he the which suffered
be almighty that he may sustain pain infynyte. And sythen that Justyce
vnmeuable required such pain / it behooves that it b^ offered and paid sythen
that it has pleased unto Jhesu christ right parfyghtly us for to by again /
and that he it may and that Justyce it requires / it follows that he has
paid for us passions / sorrows / and anguysshes Infynyte. Whereof says a
devout contemplatyf that if the pain that our lord suffered for every one of
us / and for us in like wise were dyuysed in as many parties as there ben
drops of water in all the sees or in all the world. Also in as many parties
as Nota.
ever was of brekynge of grass / of ye leaves / of trees of feathers of birds /
of sterres in the sky / of corns of the earth / of men and of women / the
humanyte of Jhesu christ or other natural man had not borne half a quarter of
an hour without death one of the most little parts of the pain before said
so dyuysed. But for as much that yt blessed humanyte as well the body as the
soul / be and shall be always united in the dyuynyte in ye second person of
the blessed trynyte / she may bear and endure by the virtue and might of the
dyuynyte passions and torments without comparyson. And more over every true

christian man ought to be certain y^ from the hour that Jhesu christ began
to suffer this pain. That is to know from ye first being of his blessed
Incarnacyon / he see every person that ever was / is / and shall be in

suffer for him more than any will or may for himself. Here every good christian
man should think and mean devoutly one time on a day / at the lest one time

know unto death of gylte / unto death cyuyle the which is to be dampened or
exyled from his heritage of his country or to be in ser^age / unto death of
nature ye which is separacyon of the body and of the soul / and unto death of
hell eternal. By the mercy of god infynyte / and the merytees of his blessed
passion we ben delivered from two manner of dethes / that is from the death of yt
gylte of sin / and from eternal death / by such wise that we shall keep unto
Jhesu christ our redemptour yt yt we have him promised in baptem. But by the
dyuyne Justyce and for our great profit we shall abide subjects unto two
other manner of dethes. That is unto ye death cyuyle. for we be out of paradyse
terrestyall ye which was our heritage if sin had not ben / and unto death of
nature. From the which dethes the Justyce dyuyne us should not deliver / for
in so doing he us had pryued by a mean for to purchase great merytes / of the
which the hyere shall be infynyte. For of In patiencia vra^ possidebitis ai^as

as much as we suffer the more in pacyence and for the love of god in the
exyle of this world / our reward shall be ye greter in the realm of paradyse
and so it apyreth yt by Justyce we ought to do penance in this world. The
work of this article after the moralyte is to have pacyence and makenes in
aduersyte / be it syknes of body / pouerte / or loss of goods or of friends /
fortune of time. Iniuryes / feblenesses or temptacyons ^ For of as much that
any man suffered the more in this world in the estate of grace and in taking
it pacyently for the love of god / of as much he has in him the more great
token of the love of god and of salvation. For as it Qui vult venice p^^me

has been before said. The cross that is to understand trybulacyon and
aduersyte is the very token where ben the arms of the king Jhesus without the
which there shall never person enter in to ye royalme of paradyse. And in as
much that they ben the more plain and the more great of as much is a man
set in the royalme the more honorably and the more nere the king. Also the
good christian man should take his cross and him crucifye in like wise as ye
gospel says. And it is none other thing to say but that the christian man
should resyste and not follow and obey unto the inclynacyons and mouynges of
the sensualyte. And that unto us is sygnyfyed in that that we say. Crucifixus.
That is to say that our lord was crucyfyed for to give us example to suffer
and endure for the love of him with pacyence. And the poor sinner ought not to
dyspayre him / how be it that the sensualyte complained him an inpacyent / and
that he be inclyned and passo^ned to take vengeance / or to do a great many
other ylles. So that reason him hold ferme and steadfast in the fere and love
of god not being of consent it for to break in ferme sensualyte / for as to
suffer such rebellyons of the sensualyte is not but matter to purchase merit.
Also ought y^ good christian man to be deed and buried with Jhesu christ* the

sensualyte in keeping it under the rod and dyscyplyne of reason his five
wits of nature / that is to understand the sight / the herynge / the
tastynge / the sauorynge / and the touching. He ought also to have mortefyed
and quenched in him the seculer life and worldely / and that is given us to
understand by that that is said. Mortuus et sepultus. Our lord deyed in this
world and was buried. For otherwise the faith of this article is deed the
which bears not the fruit of holy mortyfycacyon.

Here follows the.v. article the which is such
DEscendit ad inferna. tercia die resurrexit a mortuis. That is to say. I
believe yt Jhesu christ descended in to hell. That is to wit the soul united
with the person of the very sone of god as before it has been expowned / and
the third day arose. The work of this article after the moralyte is that we
should by holy and fructuous medytacyons descend in to hell during this
present life / to the entente that thither we descend not after the death by
eternal dampnacyon. the which thing our lord us would show. For before
that he styed unto the heuens he descended in to the helles The which
medytacyons the good christian man ought to make of the pains of hell for to
cly^me unto the heuens it shall be spoken in the last party of this book. Also
by this article we should know the mysery and right great unkindness of humayne
condycyon yt we see our lord for the love of us descend in to hell / and
(...) love of him we will not mou^te in to paradyse. Also we should arise from
hell / yt is from the estate of mortal sin on the third day / that is by
contrycyon / confession / and satysfaccyon. First for the love of god
pryncypally Secondely for the desire of the glory of paradyse And thyrdely for
to show ye great pains of hell and the torments that there ben for ever
without end. And therefore the faith of this article is deed the which bears
not here this fruit.

Here follows the.vi. article.
AScendit ad celos sedet ad dextera^ dei patris o^nipotentis. That is to say.
I believe that our lord ascended in to heaven the.xl. day after his
resurreccyon and set him on the right hand of the fader. Here is to be noted
yt how be it our holy faith is of things ye which furmou^ten the puyssau^ce
and capacyte of natural understanding / how be it she contained not no thing
impossyble nor contrary unto reason. And thefore we say that y^ sone of god
descended from heuens by his blessed incarnacyon and styed in to the heuens by
his glorious ascensyon / we should have in us such dyserecyon yt we
understand yt to descend and to mou^te as unto the mutacyon of the place may
not belong unto the diuinyte y^ which is imeuable and infynyte But we shall
understand that the descendynge is none other thing to say but him to show
and to present in our nature humayne. And in like wise the mou^tyng unto y^
heuens is as in regard of our humanyte in the person^ (...) the sone of god
the fader / the which by the virtue dyuyne is lift up above all the heuens /
that is above all creatures. He sytteth on the right hand of god the fader /
as unto the dyuynyte it is none other thing to understand but that ye person
of god the sone is egall to god the fader in majesty / puyssaunce / bonte /
wysedom and diuinyte. As unto the humanyte he sets him on the right hand of
god the fader / that is to understand that he is in rest glorious after his
right pyteous passion. On the right hand / that is in all the sovereign
highness of glory and of benedyccyon that ever man may speak or think / and
as the bonte and puyssaunce dyuyne may give. For truly Jhesu christ very man in
body and in soul reasonable in unity of person dyuyne is king of glory and
of might egall unto god the fader and is Juge of the quycke and of the deed. By
the which it is well said he sets him on the right hand of Qui desce^dit
ipse e^ ^ asce^dit super oe^s celos vt adipletes oia. Ad ephe. (...).
god. For by the right hand in holy scripture unto us is oftentimes sygnyfyed
soueraynte of glory and of blessydnes in the which the blessed Jhesu cryfte
is in humanyte and in dyuynyte. The work of this article after the moralyte is
that the true catholyke the which steadfastly byleued these things before said
/ ought to have his heart / his love / and his desires on hye / departed from
the eithe and from these things benethe and transytorye. That is to say that
he has not his love in pride / in nolite dsligere m^d^ neque ea q^ in mu^do

worldely vanyte / in delytes / nor in rychesses / but his love is where his
tresoure is / his glory and his blessydnes / that is the blessed Jhesu christ
very god of love the which draws all his true lovers unto him. For no
thing that may be said may not better draw love / than does an other love /
and therefore he says in the gospel. Come unto me all ye the which ben in
labor and in pain / as if he would say. I labor as you and more than you
and for the love of you right now I Ubi e^ thesaurus tuus ^bi cor tuu^ erit

give it unto all them the which after me will labor. These worldely people
labor for the world pryncypally / and these good christian men labor for the
life eternal. And therefore every true christian man being in the labors of
this world should say by the virtue of the faith that that saint Steven said
when he labored in the article of death and when he bare the Uideo celos

other mortal persecuco^n / behold sweet Jhesus / and know thou that it is
impossyble to gosette him at his table the which will not drink of his cup
/ and the which holds not the way that he has holden. That is for to
descend in to hell as it is said / for to stye unto paradyse there where he
is. And know thou that the faith of this article is deed ye which bears not
here this fruit.

Here follows the.vij. article.

quycke. And after ye resurreccyon he shall Juge together all them ye which
before the said resurrecco^n have been deed. But the exposicyon of pope Innocent
the third and of many other / it seems better to be unto the purpose

affirmat. Luce. xii he. and ap. x* and. xxii.
how be it that he again says not unto the expostcyon before said. And that
is such / that our lord shall come to Juge first the quycke / that is at the
Jugement partyculer the which is done at the hour of death of every man. For
master Nycholas de lyra says in many cases in his doctrine that our lord
comes unto ye departing of every man be he good or ylle. Also the pope
Innocent says that these good men seen him at the hour of death unto their
great Joye and consolacyon in example of a noble espouse the which should
receive his right well beloved and faychfull ^pouse retornynge from a much

And of this apparycyon at the hour of death we read many examples as well of
the good as of the ylle. Of the good as saint John the euangelyst of whom
Jhesu christ has said. I will that he abide Sic eu^ volo mane (...) done^ veni^.

Andrewe and of saint Katheryne and of other many we read that he apyred unto

given puyssau^ce and auctoryte and in heaven and in earth / that is the blessed
Jhesu christ not all oonly in so much as god / but with that as much as man.
Much it is for to Ite^ data e^ michi^is pta^s i celo and in te^ra. Math. vi.
do for to bring often unto mind that we all shall be present in person at
the great. Jugement. for no man may thens flee. Also the sins of the dampened
shall be publysshed and manyfested unto Juges angels and unto all them that been saved and also unto the deuylles. Also one shall see the falsenesse of
these ypocrytes the which men wend other times to have been true faithful
and good people. Her false Jugementes and cursyd sentences shall be right
holely and Justele Juged. Gifts promy^^^s feres nor favor may not tarry
Justyce infynyte the which is and shall be the very Juge of the quycke and of
the deed. The work of this article after the moralyte / is that every man
should take heed of his spyrytuall deed. in like wise as Jhesu christ us has
warned in the gospel saying. Wake ye in your caas / for ye know Uigilate qr
nesci^ di^ neque hor ^ Ma xxv. and Luce. xiii.
not the hour that the Juge shall arryue. And who so that well ^hym remembers
of the hour / he shall never consent for to persevere or for to abide in
mortal sin hour nor half an hour. And the faith of this article is deed
the which here this fruit the which fruit is the fere of god and
preparacyon to deye well bears not.

Here follows the.viij. article.
CRedo in spiritum sanctum. That is to say I believe in the holy ghost. For
every faithful christian man ought to believe in one god or in one dyuynyte in
three persons / that is in the fader in the sone / and in the holy ghost. And
of this a man ought not for to doubt or for to know or curyously for to
inquire as before has been said. for entendement create is not suffycyent enough
for to comprehend and to understand the mysteryes of the blessed trynyte. But
always in these things yt he vndstanded he has some rep^sentacion of the
blessed trynyte / for theris not so little a creature but that he has / unity
/ veryte / and bonte. Also if he have admyracyon that one essence of deite be
in three persons of the wh^^he the one is not the other / as to merueyll h^^ ^e
may have two natures in one person / that is in creature humayne ye which
has in him nature corporell / and nature spirytuall / that is body and soul /
whereof the one is mortal and the other i^mortall in one self person. Also
every thing corpprall has three things / that is the length / the largenes /
and the depnes. Also in all the world there is but three manner things. The
first ben spirytuell all oonly / that is nature angelyke. The second ben
corporell all oonly / as the four elements. The third ben things spirytuall
and corporal together / that is man and woman. Also in the soul / the which
is unto the image of the blessed trynyte has three myghtes. That is to know
mind / understanding / and will / and is not but one soul in the trynyte /
and the trynyte in unity I believe than every christian man ye person of the holy
ghost to be one dyuynyte / one puyssau^ce / one majesty with these persons of
the fader and of the sone / and that that make the one of these three persons
as in regard of the creacyon and of the gouernynge of all the world and to
glorifye the good and to dampne the evil is made of all these three without
dyfference. The work of this article as unto the moralyte is for to meruayll.
For as says saint Poule they in whom the holy ghost enhabyted by grace
habunden in diverse gifts. Some have grace to speak well and wisely / some
other have understanding and knowledge of many things that man may not know
but by the gift of the holy ghost and of prophecye. Some other do miracles /
some other such merytes and virtues by humylyte charity and mercy in the
virtue of the holy ghost / the which converted / moved / and teched and
enbrached in love these humayne bodies the which dyspose them to receive it
and them gyued spirytuall life by the which they profit in good works / they
fight and resyste the world and the devil and unto their inclynacyons
sensualles. For in like wise as the erthely spyryte / that is the soul gives
unto ye body vsau^ce of the five wits of nature / that is the sight / the
Auferes sp^m torum and i puluete^ su^ reuertent^. p^s. c. iii.
herynge / the tastynge / the smelling / and ye touching / him gives also
power to speak to walk and to be besy in diverse mysteryes and works. And when
it departed from the body he leseth all these things before said / and falls
unto earth rotten and retorneth unto ashes. So much more excellently when the
holy ghost is in the soul by grace he hy^ gives five wits spyrytuall / by
the which the soul knows meruayllous things of god and him gives might to
walk in keeping the commandments Beati i^maculati i^ via ^ ambula^t in lege
dni^. Item via^ ma^datorum tuorum cucurri. p^s. c. xviii.
of god and to speak with him in prayer and to resyste and battle in this
present life. And when by the gylte and sin of any he is departed from ye
soul / she leseth the true knowledge of hell and of paradyse / and falls by
effeccyon in love dysordynate in to powder and ashes of things erthely / and
becomes fylthy stynkynge in words / in deeds / in saeynges and thoughts /
and no power well to resyste the devil to keep the commandments nor to do
thing the which is unto god pleasant and merytoryous for to purchase a
reward in paradyse and so we ought to believe every true christian man and that
ye faith of this article is deed the which ba^eth not the fruit of this
knowledge.

Here follows the.ix. article.
SAncta^ ecclesia^ catholica^. That is to say I believe the holy church
catholyke or universal. Here is to be noted yt holy church is as much to
say of all those and them the which have ye blessed holy ghost by grace / be
it in this world or in ye other. For in like wise as ye humayne spyryte that
Ala e^ tota in toto and tota i^ q^libet corporis part.
is the soul vnyeth many and diverse members as the heed / the feet / the
hands / and the other members be they great or little in such manner that
there en is but one body humayne and not many. For they have not but one form
the which form or spyryte humayne is always in every of the members / and
over all so as has these phylosophres and wise worldely men a little while
syns perfytly known and declared. In like wise much more excellently the
blessed Sapie^tia sa^ctorum narra^t ppli and laudem eorum pronu^ciat ois ecc^^a
scto^rum. e^ ^lesi. xxx^x.
holy ghost vnyeth and vnyfyeth all these me^bres of the holy church in one so
dygne and so perfyte yt ye goodness of yt one be it great or little is ye
goodness of yt other. For by ye virtue of charity every man of body mystycall of
holy chirthe loved his neighbor as himself / by the which it follows yt the
honor the goodness and the Joye of yt one is the goodness of yt other. That is
ye blessed company / that is to know the universal church is in three
parties. The first is named ye church tryumphau^t or victoryous that is these
blessed men the which ben now in paradyse and here never sought degree of
merit esse^cyal for they be unto the^ determined. The seconde-partye is named
ye chirch mylytau^t or she ye which is in battle / yt be these good christian
men which yet be in batell of this world and may from day to day win praise
and merit. The third party be they yt be in purgatory y^ which be in love
of god / but they have not done penance suffycyent for their sins ye which
they achyue in the said place of purgatory. And for as much yt every soul
which is of ye nombre of yt one of these three companyes unto ye holy ghost by
g^ce. The which holy ghost is one in all and is not all but one oonly church
catholyke. And like wise as ye me^bres of ye body natural do aid and serve yt
one unto yt other every of them in his office / in like wise ye me^bres of ye
body mystycall of holy chirch^ do service yt one unto yt other / for these
blessed saints pray for them ye which be in ye battle and rejoice the^ of
their goodness and of ye conuersaco^n and penance of sy^nes. And they of ye
batayl yt is of ye church mylytau^t give glory and praysynge unto god of ye
tryu^phe and victory of saints / and they make feestes and solempnytees in
earth / they found chirches / they give rent and tresours in requyrynge the^
unto their aid by devout orysons. In likewise they pray unto god for the^ of
purgatory / and they offer sacryfyees and almesdedes to allege their pain
Sancta and salubris t^^ cogitatio pro defu^etis exorare vt a peccatis soluan^
Mathei. xii.
And they of purgatory pray for their benefactors as well i^ purgatory as i^
heaven as they be thyd come / and their prayers profit greatly the^ of ye batayl
of this world as it shall be said herafter i^ ye treatise of ^^y The work of
this article as unto the moralyte is in three manners. The first is to keep the
festes of the holy saints of paradyse / in prayers / in orysons in other
deuocyons in requyrynge their aid and help. The second is for to pray for
them that be departed. The third is sufferaynly for to keep him to be
exco^myned and departed by mortal sin Princeps ego ^^oim tunentiu^ te and
custodienciu^ man data tua. p^s. xviii.
from so noble a company as is the holy church catholyke / for it is
impossyble yt if a creature be in ye state of deedly sin and has the holy
ghost by grace. And in like wise as they the which have ye holy ghost be in
nature angelyke or humayne make an holy church and a body mystycal as it is
said. In Odiui eccl^iam maligna^tiu^ and cu^ i^piis no^ sedebo. ps. xxv.
like wise by some semblau^ce the congregacyon of cursyd folk makes a body
mystycall in a church the which is of god acursyd. And therefore ye faith of
this article is deed the which bears not here his fruit.

Here follows the.x. article which is such.
SAnctorum co^munionem remissione^ peccatorum. That is to say. I believe the
co^munyon of layntes and the remyssyon of sins. Here is to be noted that true
and faithful love makes all things common. And for as much yt holy church
is united as it is said in the love of yt holy ghost every man has part of the
goodness of that other as well in heaven as also in earth / for the saints of
paradyse rejoice them of good works and merytoryous yt which be done upon the
earth / and these faithful cryste^ men Joye them much fruytefully of the
glory of these blessed men. Also in the earth the true catholyke playned and
sorowed of the ylle of his neighbor by compassyon and mercy and Joyed him of
his goodness and profit by the which it appyred that he has co^municacyon with
the holy sacraments / the which unto them be common / and syngulerly with the
right precious body of Jhesu christ the which unto us fygured and represented
this union. Also in this article is contained the trought of all the
sacraments of holy church / in like wise as the doctors sayen specially in
yt yt is said remissione^ peccatorum I believe the remyssyon of sins for it
may none otherwise be done after the ordinance dyuyne but by the sacraments
as it appyred of baptysme as it has been before declared and shall be herafter
more plainly in the treatise of confession. The work of this artyle as unto
the moralyte is to have honor and reverence unto the sacraments of the
church and him prepare and them ensue as the very medycyne of all the
sekenesses spyrytuell conseruatyf of of strength and of health / and
augmentatyf of grace and of benedyccyon. The faith of this article is deed the
which bears not here his work.

Here follows the.xi. article which is such.
CArnis resurreccionem. That is to say. I Oe^s ^de^ resurgemus i mome^to i
^^^uoculi i nouissia tuba: canet ei tuba and mortu^ resurg^t etc. Ad corinth. v.
believe that these humayne bodies shall arise. For as saint Poule says in a
moment / and is as little while as one may close and open the Joye all good and
evil shall arise in body and in soul / at this mysterye shall be all those
blessed angels by the commandment of god in this little momente of time
shall assemble the ashes and the douste of all erthely bodies without that
that he shall fail one here of his ^olde / and that done in a moment / or
instant / the blessed Jhesu christ in dyuyne nature and humayne shall yield the
propre body unto every soul them areysynge and gyuynge life that never shall
have end nor departing. But great dyfference and much to meruayll shall be
between the bodies of them that be dampened / and of them that been blessed. For
these dampened Cre do^rede^ptormeus viuit and i nouissimo die etc. Job. xix.
shall be black heavy stynkynge and horrible / and so dysformed that none
erthely heart ne may think it. And by the contrary the bodies of them that been blessed they shall have four noblenesses that is claryte / impossybylyte /
subtylyte / and agylyte / that these theologyens call / dowers / of the which
shall be said in speaking of the glory of paradyse Man may persuade the
trought of this article by these things that we see in nature / in art / in
reason / and in auctoryte. Nature is much to be meruaylled in a corn of whete
or of other seed / after that it shall be rotten by ye virtue or the son /
and of the moisture of the earth / from the rottennes shall become quycke and
boudde the which shall yield an high stalk and a right and for one corn
there shall come an hundred. Also it is seen in the month of Apryle one tree
growing or an other great chosen branch grene with leaves / and coured with
white flowers / and to ymagen the little now rotten whereof he proceeds / is a
matter of right great admyracyon. But folysshe people right few so arreste. And

natural of the son and of the earth makes of a little corn rotten of new
so fair and pleasant thing. Wherefore shall not the son of Justyce make it
/ that is the blessed Jhesu christ in whom is puyssaunce dyuyne and infynyte
of the rottennes of ye body humayne a more fair thing than man may think. Also
we see that of fern burnt and put in to ashes man makes by craft these
vessels of glass so fair so clear and so pleasant that kings / popes /
and emperors leave cups masers of gold for to use the pleasure of the
glass. By the which then god the which is sovereign master of art the
which has forged the son and the moon and the which has made all thing
of naught / may he not make of the ashes of a body humayne fair vessels and
full of glory shynynge more than the son. Also reason us tells that
trewely he the which was deed and is arysen / he being a live may a reyse
these other Also the auctoryte of saint Poule writing unto Sicut i^ adam oe^s
moriu^t: ita i^ xp^^ oe^s viuificabunt.1. corinth. xii.
the Corynthyens said. So as Adam by his sin is cause of the death of all
these erthely men. In lyky wise Jhesu christ them shall areyse all by his
Justyce. The work of this article as unto the moralyte / is not to fere to
deye for the trought of the faith / and for the love of Jhesu christ syns that
we be certain that he shall yield us body and soul in the most fairest /
most noblest / and most dygne of dysposycyon without any comparyson than they
be now / for they shall be Immortal and Impassyble. Also we should not wayle
nor sorrow dysordynatly for the love of our friends Nolite contristari si cut
ceteri ^ spem ^ habe^t. i. ad thessao^^ce ^. iiii.
and kynnesmen syns that we have faith and hope for to see other shortly. The
faith of this article is deed the which ber^th not here the fruit of this
work.

Here follows the.xij. article.
TItam eternam amen. That is to say. I believe that they the which have kept
the trought of the faith shall have the life eternal. Hec e^ vita eterna vt
cognosca^t teve tu^ deu and que^ mis^s^^ jesus xp^m. Joh. xvii.
Amen. That is to say I require and desire that it so be. Here is to be noted
that eternal life is none other thing to understand for to see and know
clearly in blessydnes of paradyse by the light of glory that yt we see and
believe in earth in the light of the faith / that is the blessed trynyte the
fader the sone and the holy ghost / and the sweet humanyte of Jhesu christ / and
of yt to have fruiction for ever without Oc^s no^ vidit nec i cor hois asce^dit

end / in body and in soul. The which vysyon and fruiction with the blessydnes
is so great y^ heart ne understanding may it think nor tongue declare / for so
much that it is a thing infynyte and eternal as to have god in the manner
beforsayd. And of that glory shall be said afterward in the end of this
book. Also it is to be noted that notwithstanding that in this article is not
made nor expressed mencyon of the dampnacyon eternal / of those that been ylle /
how be it / it is there enough to be understand in that yt man byleueth that
god is the Justyce infynyte the which is for to yield unto every man that that
he has deserved. And therefore says Athanasius. They that have well done after
Qui bona egeru^t (...) sit i vita^ eternal. ^ do mala in igne^ etern^. hec e^
fides catholica etc. Ath^ nasius in symbolo.
the Jugement shall go unto life perdurable and eternal / and they that have
done ylle to the fire of hell everlasting. And this that is before said and
written is the holy faith catholyke / the which it behooves to be kept
steadfastly and entyerly upon the pain of eternal dampnacyon. The work of
this article as unto the moralyte is to dysprayse these rychesses / the love /
the glory / and the felycyte of this world in comparyson of the life
eternal. For as Si co^sider^mus ^ and quam ta su^t ^ nobis promittunt i colis
vilescu^t oia ^ ^abe^^ in terris. Grego.
saint Gregorye says. If we think and consider ye goodnesses that god us
promytted in paradyse / all the goods of the earth shall be like unto us vile
and as no thing. Also it is to be more curyous and more desirous for to seche
these goods by the which we shall be honored in ye other world infynytly
that them of this mortal life the which dyspose us unto danger be dampened
eternally. And man ought to believe yt the faith of this article is deed the
which bears not here this work. By these things beforsayd it apyreth
shortly and in general the substance of the.xij. artycles of the faith / by
yt trought of the which every christian man is to be ordered and conserved
pryncypally in the life contemplatyue / in like wise as by the.x.
commandments man is well ordained pryncypally in the life actyf. These
doctors make a questyon / that is to know A questyon.
if every christian man the which has aege and dyscrecyon is bounden to have
the knowledge of the.xij. or.xiiij. artycles beforsayd all in general as
partyculer. The answer. Of christian man some The answe^
be in dygnyte or in office to teache or to redress. These other in the faith
and in the commandments of god / and they here be bound to know in
partyculer those things the which they ought to teache unto their subgectes.
These other christian men be of simple and less condycyon as the comynalte of
the lay people / and unto them here it suffysed to know in partyculer these
artycles of the faith most common / as it is that there is but one god in
trynyte of person / the which article he may know by the common manner to make
the token of the cross in the name of the fader and of the sone and of the
holy ghost. Also they ought to know in partyculer these artycles the which
ben in common usage of the festes of holy church / as the Annuncyacyon the
which represented that the virgyn Mary conceived by the virtue of the holy
ghost. Also the Natyuyte of our lord / the Passion / the Resurreccyon / the
Ascensyon / of whom men make testes and solempnytees in some and certain
days every year. For it is also as impossyble but that a christian man the
which has wit and age may know such artycles if he be not in such wise
occupied and blinded of the world that he dysprayseth the sauacyon of his
soul the which thing is deedly sin. Also he is bound for to believe that
who so trespasseth unto his wyttynge any of the.x. commandments / is in
deedly sin. Of these other things subtyle of our faith the simple lay man
ought not but little to inquyre / but to him it suffysed to believe in general
and to have will for to deye in that faith that our mother the holy church
byleueth an holds. The which thing us lyketh to grant the fader and the
sone and the holy ghost.

Amen.
Here follows the second party of this book in the which is made mencyon
of the.x. commandments of the law. The first Chapter.


The.x. commandments of the law.
One oonly god you shall love and worship perfytly. God i^ vain you shall not
swear by nor other like. The sondayes you shall keep and serve god devoutly. Fad
and mod you shall honor to the end you live long. No man you shall slay in deed
nor wyllyngly. Lechery you shall not do of body ne of consent. No me^nes goods
you shall not stele nor witholde. Falls wytnes you shall not bear nor lie in any
wise. The works of ye flesh you desire not but i^ marriage Other men's goods you
shall not coueyte to have i^ iustli


AFter the treatise of the.xij. artycles of the Caplm p^mu^
faith / here follows the.x. commandments of the law. God our fader
omnypotent seenge and knowing the lytylnes and fraylte of humayne nature he
requires not of us all enterly the service that we ought to do unto him after
the reygne of Justyce / but unto us has given certain nombre commandments
/ the which if we them keep and accomplysshed unto him it suffysed for to give
us salvation. And they be named the.x. commandments Uotorum due su^t species

of the faith / the which every christian man has auowed and promised solemply
in receyuynge the baptem. By the which sacrament by himself or in the person
of his godfaders or godmoders he renou^ceth unto the devil / unto pride / unto
pompes and vanytees of this world as it has been before said in promyttynge
and vowynge unto Jhesu christ and unto the holy church to keep all the time of
his life the.xij. artycles of the faith contained in the Credo / and also the.x.
commandments of the law / And this vow here of the faith and of ye
obedyence is so great and so solemn in every christian man that god nor holy
church ne may with him dyspence but that upon pain of dampnacyon he is bound
unto the king. Jhesus to keep unto him the faith promised doing him the
service of the.x. commandments. And every person the which has made the
holy vow of baptem and accomplysshed not and keep the commandments / is a
thing like unto a tree that bears no fruit / the which is by the gospel of
god acursyd. Wherefore says well saint James in his canon that faith is said to
be deed the which bears not the fruit of good work. This work of the.x.
commandments the which god and nature us has given and written in three
manners upon our bodies / in so much that we have.x. tooes on on our two feet /
ten fyngers on our two hands / and five wits of nature double in their
organs and instruments natural. For two eyes serve unto the sight / two eeres
unto the herynge / two nosetrylles unto the sauerynge / two lyppes unto the
tastynge / and two other things for the touching. By the feet of the body to
us is sygnyfyed the desires and affeccyons of ye soul. By the hands the
operacyons. By the five wits of nature all our governance as well of body as
of soul. And therefore our creator unto us has given and written the.x.
commandments in three places and manners before said / doing us to know that
by the.x. commandments in all things and in all places we should be
governed as well against god as against our neighbors. We be well ordained
against the blessed trynyte the fader and the sone and the holy ghost by ye three
the first commandments / than is to know if we love god the fader
soueraynly / we take not the name of Jhesu christ in vain in any wise / and
against the holy ghost if we keep the feestes holely / and in accomplysshynge
duly these three commandments we dyspose us to receive of god our blessed
creator the three virtues theologyes or dyuynes / that is to understand
charity against the fader / hope against the sone / faith and light of grace
against the holy ghost. By these.vij. other commandments we be well ordained
against ye university of our neighbors First doing unto them good and pleasure
in place and in time. Secondely keeping us in offendynge unto them doing
vylony or damage. To do good unto us is commanded in that that we ought to
honor fader and mother. The which commandment contained and compreheded the
seven works of mercy as well corporal as spyrytuall / the which here after
shall be declared. To do ylle unto his neighbors may be intended in three
manners / that is to know in deed / in word / and in will. Also a man may do
ylle in deed to his neighbor in three manners / that is to understand to his
own person / unto his wife or espouse / and in his goods mouable and
vnmouale. To do ylle unto the very person of his neighbor unto us is defended
by that / that we should not do homycyde / the which is the second of the
seven commandments. To do vylony or treason of auoutry again his wife or unto
other person unto us is defended in the third the which is you shall not do
the sin of lechery. To do ylle unto thy neighbor in his goods unto us is
defended in ye fourth the which is / be in no wise a thief / a sacryleger / an
usurer / a symonyer / or a rauenour. To do ylle unto thy neighbor unto him
speaking Jniurye / or unto him showing his sin by evil intencyon proce
dynge of ire or of envy / unto us is defended in ye fyfth by yt yt we should
bear no falls wytnes. To do ylle unto his neighbor of will all oonly is
understand in two manners. The first in coveting carnally the wife or the
daughter / or also the wife of the sone or the espouse of his neighbor / and
that un to us is defended in the sixte commandment / which is he should not
have the desire of lechery. Secondely we may offend our neighbor in desiring
his goods over reason and against Justyce / and that unto us is defended in ye
seventh / the which is desire not an other man's goods against reason as it
is said. And by that it appyred that three commandments Quicu^que ^^t tot^
lege^ seruauerit of fendat aut in vno factus e^ oim reus Ja primo. Lex in dece^
^bis concludit o^squeculp a no^ amplius que per dece^ verda cohibet. Greg. li.

be ordained us against god and seven against our neighbor the which ben ten
the which is enterly the law of god eternal / and he that trespassed in one
all only he trespassed all the law and sinned mortally / for he lesed charity
the which is consummacyon of the law and his soul dysposed unto dampnacyon.
Pride against god is defended in the first commandment and in the second.
Pride against his neighbor in the fourth. Sloth in the third Glotony and
lechery in the sixte. Envy and wrath in the fyfth. Couetyse in the seventh and
in the tenth. Than it is to be noted first that mortal sin Finis p^cepti
caritas. i. ad thy.
is none other thing but transgressyon of any of the.x. commandments by the
which it follows that all mortal sin is defended by ye commandments of
god as it is said / by the which it apyred ye necessyte of true intencyon and
clear knowledge of ye.x. commandments to the end yt man may show sin

and them kept enterly and merytoryously in the treatise of the which shall be
holden such order. First shall be showed how he them unto us has given and
written in diverse manners to the intent yt we should not have excusacyon not
doing them. Secondely shall be promised y^ benedicco^n to them that will keep
them / and the maledicco^n to them the which fere not to offend them.
Thyrdely shall be spoken of every of them in partyculer as well of that is
commanded / first as of that that is defended consequently.

Here follows how god unto us has given the.x. commandments in the light
of our understanding.
AS unto the first it is to understand that Caplm.ij.
the god of nature has put and written the.x. commandments not all oonly in
the body as it is said / but also in the light of the soul / the which light

ought not to do / say / nor will / that that a man would not himself to be
said / done or wylled. And in these two points is comprysed all the holy
scripture as witnesses Jhesu christ. Also more over them he has given in
writing when he gave unto Moses the two tables of stone written with his own
hand / containing the.x. commandments right brefly / right clearly / right
easily. Right breefly that they should not encombre our mind. Right clearly
that they should not charge the understanding. Right easily to the entente yt
man them should study Joyously. Also the blessed sone of god the fader them
unto us has expowned and declared in the gospel by his holy mouth and
doctrine / and in example by his holy life. By the which it apyreth that no
christian man having age and knowledge has no cause or excusacyon that he takes
not and lerneth the commandments necessary unto salvation. And this is as
unto the diverse manners of the tradycyon of the.x. commandments.

Here follows the benedyccyons promised unto them the which keep the
commandments.
AS unto the second the which is of the benedyccyons Caplm.iij.
unto them the which will keep the commandments / that is to know god
promytted unto the Jews rude and carnal / all manners of goods temporal the
which they might desire in this world / the which may be brought in to five
manners. The first is prosperyte in fair and good line. The second health and
abundaunce of gods necessary unto this life / as bread / wine / and other
necessaryes unto the body. The third vyctory of his enmyes. The fourth great
and solemn renown. The fyfth honor and seygnoury excellent. And in these
gifts and promysses were the Jews abundaunt and much glorious during that
they obeyed unto god / and in that they kept his commandments. In like wise
as it apyreth in the auncyente testamente / the which in all things were
fygured of the new testament and of the estate of christian people. By the
which Dlal figura conti^geba^t illis.i. ad corinth.x.
it behooves that in like wise as god promytted the realm and the goods of
the earth unto them the which keep by fere and lytterally his commandments
as did the most part of the Jews. Also he promytted unto all christian people
the which keep them by true charity and spyrytually / not all oonly the goods
beforsayd / but with that in abondynge the goods of his grace and benedyccyon
in this world / and ye realm and the glory of paradyse eternally. The
benedyccyons promised by the holy scripture Salutare sacrificiu^ e^ atte^ dear
ma^dat^ and dis edere ab o^^. (...) ini^tate. ecl. xxxv. Pone thesaurum tu ^^m
i p^cept^ altissimi and proderit tibi magis quam auru^. ecl xxix.
unto the good and faithful christian people and true obseruatours of ye
commandments may be brought unto.xij. The first for man may not do unto god
in this world a more certain sacryfyce for to come unto salvation / for after
masses / fastings / almesdedes / and prayers / man may be dampened / but after
the obseruau^ce of the commandments man Serua mandata mea and viues and
lege^ mea^ q^si pupilla^ oculi. prouer.vii.
may not fail to be saved. The second / for ye obedyence and obseruau^ce of
the commandments is the most precious tresour that man may seche in this
world. The third / he yt keeps the commandments Si ^s diligit me sermoe^s
meos seruab^t and pater meus diliget eu^ and ad eu^ veniemus and ma^sione apud
eu^ faciemus. Joh.xiiii.
he is in the love of Jhesu christ and has his grace the which is so noble a
thing yt no heart may think it. The fourth he has with him the fader and the
sone and the holy ghost / by the which he ought to fere no thing in this
world / but the separacyon of yt company. The.v. he is endowed the brother of
Jhesu christ and enherytour of paradyse. The.vi. all that that he demanded of
god the which unto him is most profitable to him is given in this world and
in the other. The.vij. the creatures small and great unto him ben subgettes and
obedyent in that that it apperteyned unto his goodness and salvation. The viij.
he may no thing lose ye which unto him comes be it prosperyte or aduersyte /
but for yt he wynneth in prosperyte / by attemperau^ce / in aduersyte / by
pacyence. The.ix. he received ye benedyccyon of god in his prayers and in his
works. The.x. says saint Austyn allegynge auctoryte of holy scripture that
who so keeps the commandments may never deye an evil death in this world.
The.xi. he shall be preserved from the death of hell eternal. Nichil dulci^
quam re spicere i ma^datis d^. Ecl. xiii. in (...).
The.xij. he shall come Joyously unto the vysyon of god and eternal possessyon
of the realm of paradyse. By the which it apyreth that of good right they be
called his commandments the pathe and the way by two reasons. The first for
as much that by the obseruau^ce of the co^mau^demantes god comes and
descends in to us in geuynge us grace. The second for as much as it is the
mean by the which we go to him in glory.

Here follows the maledyccyons of them that trespassen the co^m^au^dementes of
god.
THe maledyccyons of them that trespassen Caplm.iiij.
the commandments ben infynyte. How be it they may somewhat understand by
the opposyte of ye benedyccyons beforsayd. For if they be not punysshed in this
world temporally by the which punycyon they receyuen true correccyon they
shall be punysshed of eternal dampnacyon. And unto many it becomes that they
be punysshed in this world and in the other. In this world in their line falls
and accursyd the which gives unto the fader and unto the mother desolacyon and
sorrow. Also these fruytes of the earth decay and perysshe oftentimes by
lyghtnynges and tempests of the time. And that comes oftentyme by the
transgressyon of the commandments. Also they use their bestes where noman
puttes any. Also they fall in diverse adventures of sykenesses as well
spyrytuell as corporell. Also unto them comes war / by the which they be
pylled and destroyed wives / wydowes / childern faderles and moderles / and
man's blood shed. Also hongers mortalytees / and all other maledyccyons that
may be said and thought. And all that comes by the rebellyon that man does
unto his creator not keeping his holy commandments / the which he has
given upon the pain of lesynge goods meouable and herytages. By these goods
meouable is for to be understand pryncypally the grace of god in this world.
And by the heritage the realm of paradyse. Also upon the pain of lesynge of
body and of soul and to be condemned unto the gybet of hell. But simple
people make here admyracyon for as much as they see sensybly and more comenly
that they the which keep them worste or lest / they have more of worldely
prosperyte than they that keep them / by the which they be the less ferefull
to offend god. But such doubt or admyracyon is Uere la^gores nostros ip^e
tulit and infirmitates n^a^sip se portauit. ysaie. ^uu.
great and dangerous defaute of faith and of true intencyon / for there is not
a more greter token of damp nacyon than to have prosperyte worldely and not
keeping the commandments of god. And in likewise Justus sepissit perit pro
impio. De co^se. di. iii. ca In sca^.
as Jhesu christ bare the pain of the sins of his people whereof he had not
done the gylte / so these chosen suffer oftentimes great aduersytees temporal
/ the which comes for the sins of them the which go unto hell / and that
have had their felycyte and their Joye in this world.

Here follows of the commandments in partyculer.
AS unto the third point the which is to Caplm. v.
see of every commandment in partyculer / it is to know that the first
commandment is to believe in god and to put in him his trust and him love
above all things in serving him deuoutely. In this present commandment be
contained two things / that one is commanded / and that other defended. By
the which it is to be noted that where it is so that charity is the end and
the goodness and consummacyon Finis ^cepti e^ caritas. Ad thy. ^.
of all the law of god / it behooves to say that charity is commanded in
every of the.x. commandments / the which is showed as well against god as
against his neighbor in many and diverse operacyons after the dystynccyon of the
commandments as it apyreth here after. The thing commanded than
pryncypally in the three the first commandments is charity against all the
blessed trynyte / the which charity is showed by humble adoracyon and service
all oonly due unto the fader / unto the sone / and unto the holy ghost. That
adoracyon ought to be done of soul and of body / of soul he may not do it nor
accomplysshe merytoryously if he have not true faith / hope / and charity. To
the entente than that simple people may have some knowledge of th^se three
virtues without the which it is impossyble for to come unto salvation it
behooves to say some thing in short and in general And for as much as I
have declared the noblesse and dygnyte of the faith in the first treatise I
rest as now to see of charity. Charity is a noble Caritas.
virtue mother and nouryce and light of these other virtues / by the which man
loved god above all things / and his neighbor as himself. That is to say
that for to win any good create / be it never so great or for to keep him
from the lesynge of it man should not do against the will and commandment of
god. For every person that keeps it for the loss of any thing / or the
gaynes trespassynge any of the commandments of god / he has no true
charity. And if before that he sinned mortally he were in charity / he it
leseth all hole by the which loss he is gretely in damage. For he the which
was by the virtue of charity the sone of god by adopcyon / is made the sone of
the devil of hell by imitacyon and the sone of dampnacyon and of perdycyon.
He the which was in beauty spyrytuall unto the image and semblaunce of the
blessed trynyte is horrible and deformed as a spyryte dampened. He the which
had god the which is the good infynyte has all lost in lesynge charity. He
the which was the brother of Jhesu Amice quo^ hue intras^i no habe^s veste^
nuptiale^. Mathe^. xxii.
christ enherytour of paradyse and of the holy angels honored and praised /
is the servant of the devil and of mortal sin / and unto the death eternal
condemned if by true penance he be Deus caritas e^ and ^ manner i caritate i
deo manet and deus in eo. Jo. iii^.
not releued. Charity is the noble robe and light of the weddynges of paradyse
whereof the soul the espouse of Jhesu christ is anorned / and without the
which man shall be confusedly put out and departed from the company of all those
yt be chosen / the which has holden and kept this book in like wise as says
saint Johan. Who so has charity / is with god / and god with him / and by the
virtue and grace of this presence and union of the soul with god and god with
the soul comes the life spyrytuall. For so as Sicut aia est vita corperis ita
deus e^ vita aie. Augus ^. li. co^f es.
saint Austyn says as ye soul gives ly^ unto the body and might to meue him
and to do his operaco^ns so god gyuech unto the soul being in true charity.
xij. fruytes that saint Poule rehearsed / that is to understand Joye spyrytuall
one pease yt the world may not give / pacyence in aduersyte / swetnes / bonte /
amyte / longanimite / fydelyte / temperau^ce / contynence / and Dslige d^^m de^
t^u^: perxinu^ tuu^ sicut teipsu^. In his duobus ma^datis tota lex pendet and
^phecie. Ma. xxii.
chastyte, And for to speak shortly / he yt has charity has all goodness / and
he yt has it not has no thing. And therefore says our lord in yt gospel he
that loves god and his neighbor accomplysshed all the holy scripture / and
hy^ it suffysed unto salvation / and by the consequens he yt offended charity
puts his soul unto dampnaco^n. These A questyon.
doctors make a questyon if a man may well know of himself / or of an other
if he have true charity. The answer is yt a man may not know by The answer
the way of nature / but well by ye reuelaco^n of god as have had some holy
persons The which thing is not profitable or necessary of the comen law /
to the end that we be always in fere and in mekenes. And therefore says holy
scripture no man knowed it / that is to know by certaynte humayne / if he be
in the love or in the dread of god. But any may know by some correctours as
Saint Bernarde says. First when the person has dyspleasure of his sins
and of his cursyd and wicked life for the love of god. The second when he has
ferme purpose for to keep him from sin mortally Imor dei nunque e^ ociosus
operatur ^i magna si e^. grego.
in time to come. The third when he fyndeth himself ready and Joyefull in
using good works. The fourth after some is when a man here wylfully hereth
the word of god / for the gospel says that they the which ben of gods
party heren gladly to speak of him. And it is a like Jugement Qui ex deo e^
vba dei audit. Io. viii
of them the which in redynge or in herynge things of devotion and
proufytable unto the soul find savor and enjoy them in their spyryte. This
noble virtue of charity showed him in these good christian men without forth / he
knelynge and Joynynge his hands in berynge honor and reverence unto the holy
sacraments unto the relyques and images of saints / not oonly that a man
ought to worship the images nor to have hope in ye fair more than in the foul
or vile. For that should be ydolatrye but a man ought to bear reverence for the
honor of the holy saints the which they represent / who me we should know
for as much as god them has approved by miracles / by virtues / and by holy
life. Also we should bear honor and reverence unto the prelates of holy church
the which ben the admynystratours of the sacraments. And who so does the
contrary by pride or by malice is not the true child of the holy church. The
thing defended in the first commandment is pride ayens god and all manner of
ydolatrye. The sin of pride is Superbia.
committed in four manners. The first is when the person byleueth to have the
goods of the grace of nature or of fortune of himself and not of god. And that
comes when the person is unkind against god of the said goods not yeldynge
him thanks and mercyes. The second manner of pride is when Eusebius in
epistola de obitu Hiere. Quicu^que excedit i indume^tes vel al^s mu^d^hus
orname^t^ superflue and notabiliter peccat: contra caritate^ proximi da^na
bilit and deu^ offe^dit and mortaliter and nisi penite^do se correxerit and
talia superfiu a resecauerit: cu^ diabolo and angelis eius in se^piternu^ in
^ternu^ vadis.
the person byleued well to have all goodness of god / but he that understood
that it is by his merytes pryncypally / which thing is outragyous and
presumpcyon detestable against god. The third is in auau^tynge himself to have
ye goods spyrytuell or temporell the which man has not / as if it were to
have conning virtue or devotion. And in so doing / it is arrogance / iactance
/ and ypocresye as unto regard of the goods spyrytuell / and vain glory as
unto the regard of the goods outward As be the goods of fortune. And that
pride is showed in gowns in furs with sleuys with side lappes or plyted / in
cuttynges dysgysed of diverse facyons / some naked unto the sholders or all
most unto the pappes / in doublettes / in cotes / in gyrdelles / in chains /
in rings with precious stones / exceeding and not apperteynynge unto the
estate of the person / nor unto the honest of holy crystendome And there in
he may have so great and notable exces and affection so dysordynatly that it is
dedely sin And that may come in all estates / be it great little or mean. The
fourth manner of pride is / when ye person appetyted dysordynatly / to appear
excellent above these other / be it in conning / in beauty / in strength /
richesse or other goods. And of that proceeds error / ambycyon / vain glory
/ inobedyence unto his souerayns / rebellyon / syngularyte / in abylymentes /
in words / and in opynyons / partynacyte / dyscordes / noyses / contencyons /
debates / slau^dres / and dyuysyons. The which things sometime be mortal
sin / or venyall / after the dyuersyte of the circumstances. As oftentimes
and as many as pride is committed by delyberacyon and fully consented / it is
dedely sin in four manners beforsayd. And of all these things he ought to
examen ye person after his estate and his calling / be he seculer or of
relygyon. Here follows of ydolatrye. Ydolatrye defended in the first
commandment is committed in five manners. The first is that of the paynems ye
which worship the deuylles. The second is of the false Jews the which yet
abyden Jhesu christ and receyuen the antecryst. The third is of the sarrasyns
the which worship Mahonde heretyke and dampened. The fourth is the false
ymagynacyon of these heretykes be they christian men or other ye which again say
unto y^ faith of holy church the which is governed of the holy ghost. The
fyfth is of these falls christian men / and is committed in three manners / that is
to know by pride / by couetyse / and by Hoc a quolz coli^ quoth p^^eteris
d^^gitur. Jugustinus. Ite^ Ambro. Quoth ^spl^ amat hoc illi deus ^. De lururiosi^

lechery. And unto these.iij. manners may be brought all other manners of sin.
And so it follows / who that sinned mortally loved not god his creator
perfectly. And for as much as the lecherous man loved to be honored and
praised dysordynatly the couytous man loved his richesse worldely / and the
lecherous man his pleasure carnally / again the prohybycyon and defense of god
his creator / they make their god of these things before said. For so as
these doctors sayen / the thing that any man loved soueraynly / that thing
is his god. By the which it appyreth that the ydolatrye of these evil christian
men proud men / couytous men / and lecherous men / is more to be despised /
than that of the paynems / and of sarrasyns the which well consyderen the
hyghnes of the law of Jhesu christ / and the unkindness of these evil and
unfaithful christian men. Take heed than the sinner that will examen his
conscience in the which is pryncypally his love / his thought and his desires
/ and if he find that there be any thing worldely accuse him as a falls
traitor unkind and an ydolatrer. Also in like wise he ought to take heed if
he has been impacyente of the Jugementes of god / as of the death of friends /
of the loss of goods / of pouerte / of malice / of defamynge / of war / or
of other trybulacyons. For as saint Gregory says / there may not come ylle of
pain in this world as ben these things abouesayd / where as it is by the
will and ordinance of god. Now it is so that of the ordinance and Jugement
of god may no thing proceed but that it be good and well done. By the which
it appyreth that who so meruayled dysordynatly of a thing well done / is none
other thing than to contrary and to take god and his operacyons / ordenau^ces
and Jugementes / the which thing is blasfemynge horrible and detestable. Here
than ought the person to take heed of the sin of murmuraco^n / of impacyence
/ and of dyspayre. Also upon this commandment he ought to examen hy^ of all
falls byleues / as of sorceryes / of wrytynges / of caracters / of inuocaco^ns /
of deuylles / of diuinacyons / of folysshe byleues / unto ye regard of the
co^stellaco^ns in ye which ye child was borne / of ye song or cryeng of any
birds or metyng of some bestes Also if he be arested in any dremes in
byleuynge that for the dyuersyte of dremes to him shall come Joy or desolacyon.
Also if he put trust unto these books reproved / as is the science the which
is called of the art inuocatoria or other / in these things there may be
mortal sin after the qualyte of the person and the malice of the caas and
in other diverse manners the which should be to long for to tell / as these
doctors them distyncten and determen Also here the person ought to take heed
if he have made any vows the which by forgetfulness / by neclygence or by
malice he has trespassed. Also if he has made a vow a thing unlawful to do
/ or in lettynge of more gretter good / as woman ye make vows not to kembe
them / or not to wasshe them / or not to spynne on some days / the which ben
great superstycyons and folysshe. And it is to be noted that these bysshoppes /
or those unto whom they have given auctoryte may change the vows of their
subgectes for some good causes and reasonable. Except the vow of chastyte /
of relygyon / of of pylgremage unto saint James / of Rome / and of Iherusalem /
the which vows aperteyne all oonly unto the puyssaunce apostolycall with
other if it please him them to retain. Also it is to be noted that as
oftentimes as the person breketh his vow without Just and reasonable cause as
oftentimes he sinned mortally. An example / who so had auowed Nota.
chastyte / and after married with intencyon to accomplysshe the works of
marriage sinned mortally in maryenge him. Also the first time that he
accomplyssed the deed of marriage he sinned mortally again. Also as oftentimes as
he accomplysshed the deed of marriage by his request he sinned again mortally. An
other thing it should be if at the request of the party she yeldeth the
devour of marriage again her will assoyled. So may a man say of fastings and
other things that a man has auouwed.

Here follows the second commandment the which is such. Caplm. vi.

THou shall not swear by god in vain nor by none other thing. In this present
commandment Qui dicit se nosce deu^ and ma^data etus no^ custodit mendar est.

is some thing commanded and ye other defended. The thing commanded is to
accomplysshe our vows Justly and lawfully / and to keep the troth of the
faith and our holy baptem / unto the which we have taken and received the name
of Ihesu christ or of a christian man the which is a vain thing if we
accomplysshe not the works of a true christian man / in keeping faith / troth /
and lawful for the love of god pryncypally. Of the troth of ye faith has been
before said in the treatise of baptem / wherefore of that virtue it suffysed as
now. The thing defended pryncypally is that a man shall not swear for no
thing / that the thing the which is false be true / or that the troth be
falls / for in that he is forsworn. And if it were in Judgment over the dedely
sin it should be infamye and bound to restytucyon of the damage the which
of it comes / and a caas comenly reserved unto the bishop Also here ben
defended horrible oaths and detestable / as ben by gods death / by his virtues
/ by his passion / by his heed / by his wounds / by his belly / or cursynge
himself and geuynge him to the devil / and other inuencyons in the which many
christian men be more to be behated than Jews or sarrasyns. And they ought to be
punysshed after the ^ir m^tu^ iuta^sre plebit ini^tate et ^ discedet a domo

laws as thieves and mordres / whereof is great defaute in them that should
remedy it / and do it not. Also here offended peryllously those the which as
at every word and for no thing swear by my faith by god* by our lady / and so
of other oaths / the which custom is much peryllous. And of that comes
oftentimes that for a penny of marchaundyse or a little ware the seller and the
byer forswere them by ten or twelve times / in the which it appyreth that
after these things their sin excedeth that of Judas. And of that abusyon of
swerynge says the holy scripture that he the which swereth oftentyme shall be
fulfilled with iniquyte / and shall not long abide without the punysshement of
god Unto the transgressyon of that commandment ben brought the brekynge of
vows and of marriage / the reuelacyon of secrets of an other unto his great
damage and preiudyce. Also in like wise synnen they that swear to make a
thing the which is sin or Unjust of himself and yet they do it worse in it
accomplysshynge. Here is defended pride again god also as in the first. And that
is shortly as unto the second commandment.

Here follows the third commandment the which is such.
THou shall keep the holy days in doing Caplm. vij.
holy works / in the which unto us is some thing commanded and the other
defended. The thing commanded is charity the which is showed in halowynge.
First himself in hatynge all dedely sin. And secondely in halowynge the
solempnyte of the holy sunday and of other festes commanded The which is
done in reknowlegynge god of the benefytes of the creacyon by sovereign
puyssau^ce of the redempcyon / by his sovereign wisdom of glory that he us
promised / and that he unto us has purchased by his sovereign bou^te. Also in
examynynge his conscience of evil thoughts / and words and of evil works
for to make a lawful confession in place and in time. Also in occupyenge
himself in holy medytacyons / praysynges / prayers / and orysons / in herynge
masses and sermons. In y^ occupyenge himself in the works of pity / and of
mercy / be they corporell or spyrytuell. Of the which works Spes e^ certa
expectant future beatitudis ex merits and gra^ dei proueniens Sine ei merits
aliqid sperare no^ speres sed p^su^ptio dei potest xxviii. q.iii
shall be said more here after. And in so doing duly man seched augme^tacyon
of goods / as well corporell as spyrytuell / and pryncypally the virtue of hope
/ the which proceeds and is purchased in ye soul of a christian man by the
consyderacyon of bou^te and lybaralyte of god / and by ye propre works good
and merytoryous of the person in like wise as reherced the master of ye
sentences. And without such consyderacyon man may not have true hope. The
lyberalyte of god and the bou^te again nature humayne appyreth infynytly by that
that is said in the treatise of the artycles. But with this consyderacyon and
lyberalyte of god it behooves that we consider our life and our works. For if
the life be confermed unto the commandments of god / we ought to hope
steadfastly that the Justyce dyuyne us shall reward after that it aperteyned
unto the lyberalyte of his dyuyne majesty. And if our life and our works
Carissimi si cor no stru^ no^ rep^henderit nos fiducia^ habemus ad deu^ vt ^c^d
prtierimus accipiemus ab eo qm^ ma^data eius custodimus.1. 10. iii.
ben other / that is to know that they be contrary unto the commandments of
god / and unto the vow made unto baptem / that should be presumpcyon and not
hope / to wene for to come unto salvation. By hope a man has might and
strength again the trybulacyons and aduersytees worldely / and brings a man
unto salvation. Also it is to be noted that so as there is one faith infused
and put in the soul by the virtue of god. In like wise there is an other
found by study / doctrine / and predycacyons of holy scripture. And also a man
may say after these doctors that he may well have in the person two manner of
hopes and of charity / that is for to know / infused / and purchased / and
this suffysed as now of the three virtues dyuyne / that is faith / hope / and
charity. Here follows Oe^s dm^cos a vespera ivesperam cu^ oi^ veneratione
decreuimus obseruari and aboi illicito opere absti nere vt i eis mime mercatu^
fiat neque placitum neque ad morte^ vel ad pena^ ali^s iudicet etc. extra de

that the which unto us is defended they ben worldely works and seruyles /
feyres / markettes / pledynges / and all other occupacyons corporal the which
may let us from the things beforsayd. The which thing ought to be
understand when these said things be acco^plysshed by couetyse and auaryce
worldly. For in the caas of necessyte or some little thing a man may do
almesdede or charity without co^tempte of ye commandment of god and of holy
chirch^ a man may do some of ye said things without sy^ne specially wha^ a man
had herd mass and do his devour again god. For a man says comenly that
charity and necessyte has no law. In that commandment is De pigricia.
defended sloth the which is an heaviness and noyau^ce to do well / to say
well / and to occupye him self well. This sin has.vi. branches as declared
saint Gregory in the.xxxi. book of his moralles / that is to know malice /
rancoure / dyspayre / pusillanimyte / uncleanness / and euagacyon of thoughts
Malice is taken here for a manner of ymagynacyon of ylle again these holy
persons the which warned these slothful people to do well / and they it
disdain in their courage. Rancoure is to show such indygnacyon by some taken
outward. Pusillanimyte is to flee the work of counsel and of perfeccyon or
fere to take laborous works. Uncleanness is a sloth and lachosnes to
accomplysshe the commandments of god. Euagacion of thought is to give and
occupye himself with talkynges in folysshe and vain langage / and to bring
himself here and there vnprofytably or to change his courage from one thing
unto an other. Dyspayre is sometime sin again ye holy ghost / whereof there
are.vi. manners contraryous unto the.vi. operacyons the which the holy ghost
makes in the soul the which is in the estate of grace. The first operacyon
is that he gyued hope of the mercy of god / and again that grace is proprely
dyspayre as it was in Cayn and in Judas. And thatt comes when the person
byleueth and holds that for penance / or for prayer that he does / god will
not pardon him / the which thing is again ye infynyte bonte and mercy of god.
The second operacyon of the holy ghost / is to give an holy fere of god in the
soul. And again that grace is presumpcyon the which is in such wise to
presume of the mercy of god that ye person despised and mystaked his Justyce /
as ben a manner of sinners dulled the which answer unto them that them
repreuen that god has not made them / for to have them lost. The third
operacyon of the holy ghost is to give and teache the holy troth necessary
unto salvation. And again that grace is impugnacyon of troth the which is when
the person of certain malice again says unto the troth of the faith and of
the commandments in d^^ytynge him to prove the contrary unto the troth.
The fourth operacyon of the holy ghost is to give aid unto the soul by grace
dyuyne. And again that grace is a dyspleasure of spyrytuell goodness and of the
grace of his neighbor in repugnynge by certayna malice unto the honor of god
/ and the union of the members of holy church. The fyfth operacyon is to give
unto the soul true correccyon of his sins. And again that grace is
obstynacyon and purpose never to repent him of his sin and he is named
finally impenytent. The sixth operacyon of the holy ghost is to have a ferme
purpose never to committee thing that is contrary unto the honor and holy will
of god. And again this grace is obstinacyon and ferme purpose not to leave or
depart him from ye pleasure that he has in his sins / as pride / couetyse /
and lecherye. And it is to be noted that these.vi. manner of sins beforsayd be
said inremyssyble / but not in such wise but that god may them well pardonne
if the sinner would do penance. For as saint Austyn says / there was never so
great a sinner / but that he ought to have hope of his salvation in as much as
god him has given life. But they ben named inremyssybles / for as much that
full few arysen and with great pain. And to ye entente that a man may lightly
return and comprehend the.vi. graces of ye holy ghost and the.vi. sins
contraryous they be reputed in such form. Dyspayre again hope / presumpcyon
again the fere of god / impugnacyon of the troth again the knowledge of ye troth
/ dyspleasure of goods spirytuell again aid by the grace of god / being in
purpose to do no penance again contrycyon of his sins / being in purpose
always to continue in sin / again ye purpose to absteyne him. And this is
shortly as unto the third commandment.

Here follows the fourth commandment the which is such.
THou shall love thy neighbor as thyself / and Caplm. viij.
pryncypally thy fader and thy mother. In this present commandment unto us is
some thing commanded / and the other defended. The thing commanded is
charytable to bear honor and reverence and to do service with heart and with
word unto our souerayns / and pryncypally unto fader and unto mother / the
which thing ought to be understand generally and specially. Specially it
ought to be understand of the fader and of the mother natural / also of the
spyrytuell / as ben the pope / the bishop / and the curate. Generally they be
understand of the king / of duke / of earl / of baron / of au^cyentes and of
them that given good example by their life and doctrine and consequently they
follow that commandment again all the sons and daughters of Adam and of Eve
the which were our first friends we should honor in their lygne / that is in
our bredern and systern in nature hamayne. By the which it appyreth that in
likewise as the three ye first commandments of the first table of the law
taken unto Moses we should worship duly by faith / hope / and charity again
the fader / and the sone / and the holy ghost. Also this fourth commandment
the which is the first of the second table / contained in him virtuously
the.vij. works of mercy / of the which is made mencyon in third party of
this present book. It contained also these.vi. other commandments ye which
folowen / the which unto us be ordained duly again the university of our
neighbors / the which ordinance kept and accomplysshed unto us ben
necessary / the four virtues cardynalles / that is to know prudence / force
/ attemperau^ce / and Justyce / the which techen and adressen him and his
neighbor virtuously and morally. Prudence and force ben for to eshewe ire and
Prudencia.
envy. Prudence and attemperance for to eshewe glotony and lechery. Prudence
and Justyce for to eshewe couetyse. Prudence is a much noble virtue the which
dyscerned between good and ylle / and the great with the little / and the
little ylle with the gretter. By the which also a man chesed the good and
fleed the ylle. This virtue chesed more sooner the gretter good than the little
/ for as nothing dyscerned well the which chesed not well. By the which it
Sapientia carnis mors e^. ad rom^. ii. No^ ci e^ ista sapie^tia desursu^
descende^s ^errena alalis and diabolica. Ja. ii.
is for to know that prudence considered three manner of goods / and three manner
of ylles / that is to know the little the great and ye sovereign. These little
goods ben they of this world. The great ben they of the soul. And the
sovereign ben they of glory. They than the which have prudence in the light
of charity chesen the goods of the soul / as ben these noble and merytoryous
virtues / by the which they come unto sovereign goods in glory. But prudence
carnal and worldely and deuyllesshe chesed the little goods of this world /
and lesed the sovereign / and is brought unto sovereign ylle of hell. Justyce
is a noble virtue by the which a man gyued Justicia.
unto every man that that is his. That is to know in general / unto god
obedyence / unto his neighbor innocence / unto himself clennes of conscience.
Innocence is to do nothing unto his neighbor that he would not unto himself
to be done In like wise as by Justyce a man does well and pleasure unto his
neighbor / by innocence a man keeps him from offendynge him. Force is an
other Fortitudo.
virtue by the which a man undertakes to do or suffer for the love of god
these things strong and hard. As if it should be to do great penance to
enter in to relygyon / to pardonne great offenses / to overcome his propre
inclynacyons / to suffer Iniuryes and passions. Attemperau^ce is a noble virtue
y^ Te^perancia
which puts measure in all these other virtues. and without manner and
attemperau^ce no virtue is parfyte. Also attemperau^ce governed the person in
his five wits of nature / and restrayneth and putteh measure in all sensual
appetyte. And this is shortly of the four virtues cardynalles. The thing
pryncypally defended in this commandment is pride and rebellyon again our
neighbor / and specially again our souerayns / in likewise as it has been said
in the first commandment. Against this commandment Maledictus ^ no^ honorat
pre^m suu^ ^t matre^ sua^. deurer. xxvii. Ite^ eccle. iii. quam male fame est ^

ben pryncypally these childern yt which ben hard in heart / rude in words /
and froward in works again their friends and souerayns. And if there be
mortal exces they ben of god accursyd by sentence of dyuyne scripture. For
first they should dye and be stoned of all the people after the ancient law.
Also they come comenly to great pouerte and mysery by the Just Jugement of
god. Also they ben persecutours of their childern. Also they lose all good
renown and be in hatred with all the world. Also and furthermore they ben in
gylte of the sin of the transgressyon of all the laws / that is to know of
nature / of dyuyne scripture / and of law Canon / and the law Cyuyle / in the
which laws is commanded and enjoined the honor of the fader and of the
mother. By the which it behooves for to conclude that who so does the contrary
is worth of eternal dampnacyon. Also if they do not their devour again their
friends that been deed they offend this commandment / and ben worthy of great
punycyon temporal and spyrytuall. Also those the Qui no^ dat propria loco and
tp^e dicet sibi in fine discede ^^aledicte etc. Mathei. xxv.
which mocken with these auncyentes / or the which bear not honor unto the
people of the church syngulerly for the honor of their office and dygnyte /
and also unto the noble people and Justyce seculer for as much as god suffers
and gives puyssaunce upon their subgectes / they trespassen Ergo a forciori ^
no^ reddiditpare^tibus quoth de iure d^betur eis.
this commandment mortally or venyally after the canses and circu^staunces of
the offense the which they committee / of the which shall be seen in the
treatise of co^fessyon. Also it is here well to be noted that the childern owen
unto their friends many things / that is to know love of heart / honor in
words / purucaunce of things necessary / service and obedyence /
supportacyon in their defautes and pacyently for to endure if they given or
make any persecucyon / and he that does the contrary may not be parfyte the
obseruytour of this commandment.

Here follows the.v. commandment the which is such.
THou shall slay no man / in this commandment Caplm.ix.
unto us is some thing commanded and the other defended. The thing
commanded is charitably to socoure our neighbor in keeping him unto our power
in place and in time that he run not or fall not in any of the four manner
of dethes the which folowen. For as for to come unto salvation it is not all
oonly required neither to slay / beat / kylle / or do any other dyspleasure
unto his neighbor / but it behooves of necessyte of the commandment of god
to do unto him pleasure in time and in place in preserving his life / and in
defending him from the death. For we should not in any manner wise what so ever
yt it be / to be Iniustely the cause of the death of our neighbor. As unto the
thing defended is to be noted that there be four manner of lives / and by the
consequent four manner of dethes. For death is none other thing than the
separacyon of life. And for as much as there ben four manner of lives / in
lyky wise a man may find four manner of dethes. The four manner of life is life
natural / life in substance temporal / life in health corporal / life in
renown spirytuall. The life natural is union of body and of soul. Vita
naturalis.
Than unto the lyterall sens / by this commandment is pryncypally defended
manslaughter / that is to be the causer / by deed / by counsel / by
commandment / by will / or otherwise of the death of an other unto thy
wyttynge by wrath / or by ylle will / and without order of Justyce. Against this
commandment do these princes and their counselors the which by couetyse or
tyranny meouen wars and bataylles / the which they may not do Justely
without five condycyons. That is to know Just auctoryte / good and pyteous
affection in him ye which is Juged / the which battle and war he ought to
do. Good intencyon and certain condycyon in him or them the which puts the
war in execucyon / and that they unto whom he makes war be worthy of
punycyon. Against this commandment do they the which by their couytousnes
put them in war / for they have no good and ryghtfull intencyon. Also the
people of the church be not of condycyon that they should excercyse mortal
war / and to make effusyon of humayne blood. For in so doing they should be
irreguler and indygne of ye saerament of him the which has commanded that a
man should love his enmyes. Also again this commandment sin men and women be
they in marriage or other wise the which by their flesshely and dysordynate
indyscrecyon and cursyd goueruynge / or also by malice / or unto their wyttynge
ben ye causers that a woman lefeth her fruit and that it comes forth deed.
Also as unto the life of substance temporal / Vita substancialis.
again that commandment do those the which pyllen and stelen taken away or
wtholde from an other for as much as is in them they take from their
neighbor the thing the which unto him is necessary and where with he should
sustain his life / by the which as unto that they be ye causers of his death.
And of this should well take heed these advocates worldely and great pleders
the which oftentimes make the poor simple for to lose meouables and herytages
as ben poor wydowes / childern faderles and moderles and other. For such
thieves pyllers ryally may be said mordres in as much as they stele and take
away from the poor people their substance and goods of the which they
might have their living. Also they the which by defaute of charity let these
poor people deye for hongre / or in prison by defaute of their aid / when
they may and should do it. Also as unto the Vita sanitatis corporis.
life of health corporell / again this commandment do they the which stryuen
and stryken against the ordinance of Justyce in hurtynge any person / and in
putting him from his good health. Also Vita spiritualis.
as unto the life spyrytuall again this commandment done those the which hate
their neighbors / or the which by coueytousnes or of evil dysposicyon
desire the death of an other. For holy scripture says who so hated his
neighbor is a man kyller. Wherefore it is to be noted that manslaughter Qui
odit frem suu^ homicida ^. i. io. iii
is committed sometime in courage and will all oonly / and not as in deed
outward. Sometime it is committed of deed and not of will. Sometime of deed and
of will together. An example of the first No^ licet nobis interficere quemquam.
Io.xviii.
The Jews by their Ire and envy by counseyll and words put the sone of god
the fader unto death without touching him with their hands / so as it appyreth
by the gospel / in that that they sayen it is not lefull unto us for to put no
man to death / in alledgynge their holiness and Justyce. And always the blessed
sone of god said unto Pylate / Those the which me have betaken unto the / Qui
me tradidit tibi maius peccatu^ habet. Io.xxix.
that is for to understand those bysshoppes / scrybes / and the pharysees /
have more grievously sinned than thou. The which oftentimes had made shed
his precious blood by the torment of flagellacyon. By the which Ire and envy
may be so grievous that they may be compared unto man kyllers. So ought a man
upon this commandment to examen him of his sins the which folowen in a
short declaracyon. And first of envy Envy after saint Gregory has five
branches That is for to know / hatred of heart / susurracyon / detraccyon /
for to enjoy him of ylle / and for to be sorry of his neighbors welfare.
Susurracyon is for to speak cursyd langage by malice for to put noyses in some
persons. Detraccyon is for to speak cursyd langage for to take from his
neighbor his good renown or good name. And right often in these two manners
there is deedly sin and dampnable / and such people may not be assoyled
without ferme purpose for to restore his neighbor unto his good name and fame.
For as says holy scripture. A good name is more worth than Melius e^ nome^
b^nu^ quam diuitie ^l^e.
myllyons of gold and of silver / and as oftentimes as he has taken from any
man two pens or five shellynges he may not have absolucyon without restytucyon
of deed or in purpose. And for as much the counseyll of the wise Solomon is /
that as with detractours no man keep company with words. For not all oonly to
speak detraccyon or susurracyon by hate or by envy of his neighbor. But with
that to provoke or for to be the cause or him for to rejoice that such langage
is spoken or wylfully it hereth it is a great sin and a dampnable And as
says a gloss upon the margen of this writing that by this sin of detraccyon
well nygh all the world is dampened / and that we may coniecte. For I suppose
that many confess them of that sin / how be it they make no restytucyon. And
for to see the remedy in that caas there ben many confessors indiscreet in
assoylynge to lyghtely. This false and accursyd sin is committee some time in
putting ylle on his neighbor the which is not true / or when it is true but
by words a man it byleued / or when it is ylle it is secret a man it showed
against the ordres of charity / or so when a man says that the thing the
which of him is good has be done in cursyd intencyon. Some time in holding
his pease of the goodness of his neighbor by envy / and in all manners there
may be deedly sin and dampnable / for it is against charity in taking away
or in mynysshynge the good name of his neighbor. Of the which says Cura^
habe de bono noi^e: hoc ei^ magis permanebit tibi quam m^le magni preciosi
thesauri. Ger xli.
holy scripture that every man ought to have great heart and desire of his good
renown and name. For who so leseth good renown leseth the love of those the
which him loves the which is incomparable. Also by the occasyon to do many
good deeds and so it is by such caas many time of shame by the which he
dysposed him to all ylle. And unto that it is trewely said that he has more
gretter pain for to be helyd of the wound of the tongue than of the stroke of
sword. And this suffysed as now of the sin of envy. Here follows of Ire.
Ire is a De ira.
sin dysordynate to avenge himself upon any person by any way and manner
against reason and the ordinance of Justyce. And it is against the love and
charity that a man ought for to have unto his neighbor / and by the consequens
it is mortal sin of the which proceden many branches after as saint
Gregory says. That is to understand / indygnacyon / ymagynacyon of him to be
avenged / clamor in words / blasfemynge against god and his saints / debates
and oppressyons. These diverse manners of Ire may be also vndstande. For Ire may
be showed only in courage and in will without showing it outward. And these be
the two first branches / yt is indignaco^n and ymaginaco^n to avenge hy^.
Where such Ire is not all oonly in ye will / but with that it is showed in
words / and in this ben understand the other two branches / that is clamor
and blasphemynge of god and of his saints. A man may also over these cursyd
courages and these wicked words proceed unto the deed / as to beat and to
stryke / or to mysentreate in speech / and other diverse manners / and in that been comprysed these two other members / that is debates and improperacions. And
in all these branches there may be dedely sin after the affectyon /
delyberacyon / and other circu^staunces. Oftentimes also it is but venyall
sin unto the which dyfference he ought to take heed of the conscience of the
person by the mean and aduysement of a sage confessor. Of this sin of ire
proceeds sometime derysyons / susurraco^ns / detracco^ns and also to curse /
the which things may be mortal sin or venyall sin after the rote and
intencyon whereof they proceden. And for to keep him yt this passion of ire
proceed not unto mortal sin he ought to warn the person in two manners
after saint Gregory. First in considering ye Iniuryes as well of will as of
word done unto god and unto saints / the which things they have suffered in
great pacyence. For they know well that he were impossyble to be saved ye
which has not pacyently endured. The second remedy is that god and his
saints enduren more of us without taking vengeance of our sins the which
we can never do of our neighbor / for any Iniurye that we know to be done.
And this is shortly as unto the fyfth commandment.

Here follows the.vi. commandment the which is such.
THou shall not be lecherous. Here unto us is some thing commanded and that
other defended. The thing the which unto us is commanded is charytable
prudence by the which we have purchased sobrenes and attemperau^ce. By the
virtue of prudence we purposen the delytts spyrytual unto the temporelles and
carualles. By this virtue of attemperaunce the creature reasonable keeps him
from to much drink and from to much meet / and also from all dysordynaunce
sensual touching the sin of lecherye. The thing defended ben two sins
mortal / that is glotony and lechery. The sin of glotony is committed in De
gula.
many manners. First in etynge at an hour not dew without appetyte before
that the meets taken ben dygested / whereof comes many syknesses the which
greuen the body and the soul. Secondely by to much great desire for to have
bought precious meets the which some time perteyneth not unto the estate of
the person. For for to make dyspence in meets the which appertaynen not unto
the person is a grievous sin. Thyrdely for to ete to haboundauntly by the
which nature is grieved / the which is consent with a little and complayneth
him of to much. Fourthly not kepyynge honest manner as for to ete to hastily /
the which thing is called devouring. And fyfthtly in the manner of the
preparacyon of meets with to much great heart / of saltes / of spyceryes / of
decoccyons / and of confectures. Of that sin comen many cursyd bows or
branches after saint Gregory. That is to know gladness dysordynat / words
carnal unhonest / exces of diverse langages / uncleanness of body / blyndynge of
the entendement. In all these branches may he have so great exces yt he shall
fall in dedely sin. Dronkennes may come in three manners without sin / with
venyall / and without mortal. An example of the first. Some person knows
not the virtue of the wine and has great thorste and drynked after his thorste
/ it may be that he shall be drunk. Secondely. I put caas that the person
knows the strength of of the wine / how be it he weneth not yt it him should
surmou^te / for that he has not ben acustomed / and it may be venyall sin
all oonly Thyrdely it may happen that some known the might of the wine and by
experyence of ye inco^uenyent and yt he is acustomed to be dronken / but he
loved better to obey unto his apetyte dysordynatly than to keep him from the
inconuenyences / and than he sinned mortally. For unto his wyttynge he it
proved of usage of reason and grieved his body and his soul / and him dysposed
to all ylle / in like wise as a true sobre and abstynet dysposed him unto the
grace of god and unto the clerenes of ye intendement. And this is unto the
sin of glotony.

THe sin of lechery has seven manners / That is for to know simple
fornycacyon / auoutry / co^ynage / sacrylege / defloracion / vyolacyon / and
the sin of sodomyte or again nature Simple fornycacyon is between two persons
the which be not the one ne ye other wtin ye sacrament of marriage / nor in ye
estate of virgynyte / of lygnage / of gossyprede / in holy ordres nor in the
vow of chastyte. Auoutry is when the one or the other or both tweyne ben
married with the other party. In this when the one or the other ben of lynage
or of any affynyte / or gossyprede. Sacrylege when the one or the other ben in
holy ordres / or have made auowe solemply of chastyte. Defloracyon when the one
or the other or both tweyne be virgyns. Vyolacyon in rauysshynge when by force
and vyolence be she wydowe / virgyne / or married is known carnally. The sin
against nature and sodomyte is committed in many manners. For the person
reasonable ought to know that god and nature defended al manner of touchynges
lecherously / in the which a man keeps not the ordenau^ce and the manner / and
the parties or members the which ben required by reason for to receive lygne /
and so much the wors it is / when a man is dysordynate be it in marriage or
other wise in touching himself or another / or be by vylony and foul
pleasure carnal. Who so is culpable of such sins may well enough
understand his caas by this manner of speech. For other wise as in general
this horrible sin ought not to be written nor openly preched. But the dyscrete
confessor may well from the little unto the more great after the qualyte and
circu^staunces of the sinner come unto the knowloge of the caas / and after to
show unto the sinner the horryblenes of ye sin the which is so great that
he ought to be punysshed after the laws for to brenne in the fire / for as
much as this sin cried before god vengeance for of that comes hongres /
wars / mortalytees / pestylences / and perdycyons of reames as witnesses
these holy scryptures. By this sin pryncypally was the dyluuye in the time of
Noe / and all the world deyed except. viij. persons. Also for these same
sins fell in to depnes Sodom and Gomorre and three other Cytees. And now of
late ben as many of ylles comen / and comes / and shall come that no man them
may write or nombre. It happened also as witnesses saint Gregorye / that the
lecherous person leseth the clerenes and light of understanding / and so he
is without constaunce / without consyderacyon taking / without true hope of
the delytes of paradyse / and in one affection and love dysordynate of this
present world / and of himself / for always he would live in the stenche of
his sin. By the which it happens often that such lecherous people
dyspayre them when the hour comes of their departing / and so they goo unto
the death eternal. And this is as unto the sin of lecherye and for this
the.vi. commandment.

Here follows the.vij. commandment the which is such.
THou shall do no theeft. In this commandment Caplm.xi.
unto us is some thing commanded / and the other defended. The thing
commanded is charytable prudence in the light of charity / by the which we
have consyderacyon of the great dyfference the which is between the goods
erthely and the goods of glory. By this dyfferece and knowledge we dysprayse
and repute as naught all felycyte worldely in comparyson of the very
blessydnes. And in like wise by this consyderacyon we ben enclyned and induced
to do Justyce the which is none other thing as now / but for to yield unto
every man that that unto him apperteyneth as it has been said before and shall
be more plainly in speaking of restytucyon. The thing the which is defended
by the commandment is the sin De auaricia.
of couetyse. Couetyse is an appetyte dysordynate of goods transytorye and
temporal what so ever they be. This sin is committed generally in three
manners / yt is to know in getting to much brennyngly / in retaynynge to
streytely and in dyspendynge to scarsely. And for as much says saint Poule
that the coueytous man is an ydolater and a seruytour of the devil. Wherefore
it is to be noted that a devil named Ma^mona made unto the coueytous man. vi.
commandments. The first is that he keep well his gold and his silver or
other goods. The second is that he lose not in his hands. The third is that
he increase them from day to day The fourth is that he give no thing in
alms nor other wise. The fyfth is that he lene not nor do no pleasure /
for in so doing he puts his goods in peril. The sixte is that he shall
restrain himself and his household from meet and drink for to spare his
goods. Of this sin comes and proceeds seven daughters or branches after
as says saint Gregorye. That is for to understand treason / fraud /
begylynge / periurynges / rauayne / desirous for to get / hardynes of body
against the poor and many other euylles. Here is defended all evil
marchaundyse / evil laborynges and works to feign him in his Journey / and to
selle falls ware for good. I put caas that the seller has been dysceyued in
byenge them for good / for one dysceyued ought not an other for to dysceyue.
Here is defended theeft / vsery / rauayne / symony / sacrylege / falls speaking
/ falls swerynge / and generally all decepcyons openly or pryuely / by the
which a man makes the loss of an other his own or else that a man would not
reasonably unto him to be done. Also all contractes and other things in the
which it behooves* For to make restytucyon of the which shall be treated in
partyculer in the fourth party. And this is in general and in short as unto
the.vij. commandment.

Here follows the.viij. commandment the which is such.
THou shall bear no falls wytnes. In this commandment Caplm.xij.
unto us is some thing commanded / and the other defended. The thing which
is commanded is the contrary and the opposyte of that the which is defended.
To bear false and cursyd langage is contrary unto charity / the which we
should have against our neighbors By the which it appyreth that it unto us is
commanded to say well to magnyfye and to exalte the good and the honor of
our neighbors and in praysynge god charitably in place and in time / the
which thing we accomplysshe by the virtue of prudence and of force illumyned
with charity / for so doing and desiring the good and honor of our neighbor
to be our honor / in like wise as requires the virtue and nature of charity /
the which is to love his neyhbour as himself / and the which makes all
goods to be common. Than by good prudence we shall exalte and augment our wealth
and our neighbors. And by that virtue of force we him should purchase good
and honor in berynge him good wytnes in place and in time and in defending
him to our power and his good renown. And this is in short as unto ye thing
commanded. The thing defended / is false wytnes. That is to say cursyd
langage procedynge of Ire and of envy / and in like wise as Ire and envy ben
defended in the.vi. commandment pryncypally in as much as the show them by
work / in like wise they ben defended in the.viij. in as much as they it
shown by cursyd langage. For as a man may noye his his neighbor in deed / in
likewise a man may noye him in word. And they that may not of deed oftentimes
they do it by cursyd langage / ye which is committee in diverse manners. For as
sayen these doctors and the holy scryptures in the operacyon of the tongue is
the death or the life. And therefore would the blessed In manibus lingue more and
vita.
holy ghost him show and appyre in the lykenes of tongues of fire for to give
understanding that if the tongue be not purged and governed of the holy ghost /
it is an hard thing but that it be governed of a cursyd spyryte. That is the
devil the which by the mean of the tongue serpentynously puts all humayne
lynage unto perdycyon / and the which governs and ledeth them that been
replete with Ire and envy / and them aydeth with their tongues as with glaynes
cuttynge. And therefore Lingua ^o^ glad^ us acutus. (...).
says the Psalmyste / that the tongues of sinners is the glayne of the devil /
sharp and full of venym. And after these doctors.xij. sins proceden of the
tongue / the which may be mortal or venyall after the diverse circumstaunces
and intencyon of the sinner / as ben blasphemynge / periurynges / lesynges /
boostynges / murmuracyons / detraccyons / words carnal and unhonest /
folysshe langages / talkynges / Jangelynges / and many other euylles the which
ben showed / as witnesses the conscience of such people to be horrible and
detestable. For as our lord says by the words of Loquela tua manifestum te
facit. Mathei. xxvi. Qui de terra e^ de terra lo^^. Io. ui.
a person a man may some what have knowledge and Juge of the will and of the
conscience. Of detraccyon of diverse manners for to lie and of falls wytnes in
Jugement shall be spoken in the fourth party. And this is in general and in
short as unto the.viij. commandment.

Here follows the.ix. commandment the which is such.
THou shall not desire an other man's wife / And Caplm.xiij.
in like wise the wife should not desire the man / that is to know by cursyd
concupyscence. But well may the one the other desire with out sin by good and
Just affection of marriage. In this present commandment unto us is some
thing commanded / and the other defended. The thing commanded is the virtue
of chastyte and clennes of spyryte and of will in the virtue of holy charity /
that is to know for the love of god and of the salvation of our souls / the
which virtue of charity we should have and procure as well in us as in our
neighbors. And unto that we may come by the virtue of prudence and of force
after the manner of form declared in the.vi. commandment. The thing defended
in the sixte is all concupyscence by consent dysposed out of marriage. and I put
caas if that such cursyd ylle will is not showed outward in effect
nevertheless notwithstanding if it so be / it is deedly sin. For as our
lord says in the gospel O^s ^ viderit muliere^ ad ^cupiscen du^ ea^ tam
mechatus e^ in cord suo. Mathei. v.
who so ever has concupyscence carnal of the woman / or the woman with the
man with consent dysposed offended the commandment of god. By the which it
follows that all unhonest kyssynges / touchynges / lokynges / words /
lettres / gifts / promysses / abylymentes / countenaunces / and many other
ylle cursyd deeds pryncypally for the entente for to draw any person unto the
consent of concupyscence of the sin of lechery / it is dedely sin / for the
will all oonly is deedly sin / as it is said. And therefore the will the
which is showed by any of these tokens before said / it is more grievous than
if he abide steadfast inward of the will. And this is in short as unto the.ix.
commandment.

Here follows the.x. commandment the which is such.
THou shall not desire an other man's goods Caplm. xiiij.
unto his hurt and against the ordinance of Justyce and of reason. In this
present commandment unto us is some thing commanded / and the other
defended. The thing commanded is the virtue of lyberalyte against our
neighbors. The which virtue is excercysed by the virtue of true prudence and
of Justyce informed with charity / as it is said in the.vij. commandment. In
this present commandment may be understand the seven works of mercy. To
desire than to give of his goods by love and by charity unto us is here
commanded. And if a man may not do it in work / the good desire of the will
suffysed before god for to be gretely rewarded / as the desire for to do ylle
is worthy to be dampened. The thing defended is concupyscence and covetousness
of things temporell or the damage and preiudyce of an other. For in like wise
as in the fourth / in the fyfth / in the sixte / and in the seventh
commandments unto us is defended / for to do ylle / dysplesure / or vylony
unto our neighbor by any manner of operacyon. And in the.viij. unto us is
defended the offense of words. In like wise in the.ix. and also in the.x. unto
us is defended the cursyd will for to do unto him hurt / o^ vylony by
concupyscence carnal or other wise / In the which it appyreth clearly that
who so ever him will govern by the rule of the.x. commandments / shall be
well and Justely ordained as well against god as against his neighbor / be it in
deed / in word / or in will. Also it appyreth that in every commandment be
it affyrmatyf or else negatyf / there is some thing commanded / and the
other defended. For god never commanded for to do any thing but that he
forbade the contrary nor not defended any thing but that he commanded his
contrary.

Here follows the epylogacyon or short repetycyon of this second party.
FOr to understand the better and retain these Caplm. xv.
things beforesayd they ben recapyteled and enployed in such manner. In the
first commandment of the law is commanded humble adoracyon of the dyuyne
majesty / and ydolatrye defended and all pride against the majesty dyuyne. In
the second / confession of the troth in word and in deed is commanded / and
all periurynges and cursyd oaths defended. In the third / love unto the dyuyne
bou^te unto us is commanded / and vndeuocyon and foulnes of spyryte unto us is
forboden. And by such wise in accomplysshynge these three commandments we be
ordained against all the blessed trynyte. For unto the fader is attrybute dyuyne
majesty / and unto the sone infynyte veryte / and unto the holy ghost sovereign
bounte. And therefore to the intent that we have dysposycyon to believe / to
confess / and to love this blessed trynyte the three virtues theologyes that is
faith / hope / and charity / they ben create of god in the soul the which
worthily receives the holy sacrament of baptem. Charity for to love god the
fader / faith for to give knowledge and for to aduowe the troth of god the sone
/ and hope for to confess him in the bou^te of the holy ghost. In the fourth
commandment honor / reverence / love and pity unto us be commanded and
pryncypally again fader and mother / and consequently against every creature
humayne / and all rudenes cruelte / and unfaithfulness against our neighbors
unto us is defended. In the fyfth swetnes and benygnyte against our neighbors
unto us is commanded. In the sixte chastyte and clennes / in deed and in word
unto us is commanded / and all lechery by any manner what so ever it be unto us
is defended. In the.vij. lyberalyte in departing resonably the goods of this
world necessary unto our neighbor is commanded / and all rauayne and
coueytousnes is enhabyte. In the.viij. troth in words be it in Jugement or
otherwise unto us is commanded / and lyenge / disceyuynge / defamynge /
mocking / or abusing unto us is defended. In the.ix. chastyte in thought / in
desire / and in poorenes of spyryte unto us is commanded / and all foul
thoughts and carnal desires unto us ben enterdyted and defended. In the.x. to
delyre coueytously the goods transytory unto us is defended / and good desire
of power for to accomplysshe the works of mercy in place and in time / that
unto us shall be possible / and of reason unto us is commanded. And by these.
vij. the last commandments we ben perfectly and Justely ordained against our
neighbors in two manners / that is in keeping us from offendynge them / and in
doing unto him in place and in time pleasure and service. In these two points
/ that is for Diuerte a malo and fac bonu^. p^s. xxxiii
to know / to flee the evil / and to do the good is comprehended all
parfeccyon of Justyce as says Minus ^ mala n^ agere nisi etia^ ^sque stude at
and bonis operibus insudare Grego. in sermon.
holy scripture. Keep the from doing ylle unto thy neighbors / and enforce
the for to do unto him good and pleasure. For in like wise as saint Gregory
says. It suffysed nor for to seche salvation / not to committee any ylle nor
sin / but it behooves for to excercyse him in good works in place and Si vis
ad vita^ ingredi serua ma^da ^a. Math. xix. Qui offenderit in vno factus est
oi^m ^eus. Ia. ii.
in time the which is of necessyte. Than he that will be saved / him behooves
necessaryly for to keep all these.x. commandments. For god by his Justyce
ordained may not dyspence nor do other wise. For he has assented that who so
will come unto salvation / him behooves that he keep and that he accomplysshe
all these.x. commandments. For as saint James says in his Conon. He that
trespasseth one of these commandments sinned mortally / and breketh all the
law. Of the which brekynge Jhesus soucrayne virtue us wylleth for to keep /
and the true entendement of his law and of his holy commandments us inspyre
and them for to accomplysshe by true faith / hope / and charity / unto the
which always laketh it / the fader / and the sone / and the holy ghost us aid
Amen.

After the declaracyon of the.x. commandments of god / here folowen the.v.
commandments of holy church.


The five commandments of holy church.
On the sondayes thou shall here mass and the festes of commandment. Of all
thy sins thou shall be confessyd / at the leest one time of the year. And thy
creator thou shall receive / at Eester humbly. These festes thou shall halowe
/ that been given the in commandment. The four embres vigyles thou shall
fast / and the lent entyerly.
OVer the.x. commandments of god before Caplm.xvi.
written our mother holy church has put to five. The which to obey and to
hepe all christian Missas die dm^co seclaribus totas au diri speciali or die
^cipimus ita vt ante vn^dicto^em sacer dotis egredi ppls no^ ^sumat.etc. de
co^se. di. 1. c. Missus
people be bound after the form and manner that holy church entendeth to
bind her subgectes. The first is yt on the holy sunday and other great festes
and solempnytees given by commandment after dyuer syte of y^ country and of
the dyoces every man the which has age and dyscrecyon ought to here mass
enterly if he have no lettynge nor excusaco^n reasonable Ois vtriusque sexus
cu^ ad a^nos discretio^is peruenerit oia sua simul peta^ salte^ semel i a^no
fide lit confiteat pro^o sacerdoti and iniuncta^ penite^cia^ sibi pro^is
vitibus studiat adiplere suscipie^s reuere^ter ad minus i pascha eucharistie
sacramentu^ etc. extra de pe. and re. ca. Omnis.
by ye which of yt he may be excused. The second commandment is yt he ought
to be confessed / at the lest one time of the year unto y^ priest yt has
auctoryte to assoyle him / in like wise as it apyred by ye statute and
ordinance of holy church. To confess hy^ many times in ye year / as have of
good and holy custom many good and faithful christian men / it is of counsel
and not of commandment / except some cases partyculers the which ben here
after put and declared in the treatise of confession. The third commandment
is that all persons the which has wit / age / and dyscrecyon competent
after the Jugement and good counsel of his curate or other confessor ought
to receive ye holy sacrament of the awter at the time of Eester trewely
confessed and repentau^t of all his sins the which he has committee in his
life / and of the which he may have remembrance after the fragylyte of
intencyon humayne. The fourth commandment is to keep the feestes yt be given
in commandment / in halowynge them. And for to do it the better a man ought
to cesse of all works of sin erthely and seruyle the which may let the
spyryte to return unto god / and unto himself in time and place as holy
church has or deyned. And it ought to be understand / if necessyte l^full
him enforce none other wise. In like wise it has been declared before in the
third commandment of the law. The fyfth commandment of holy church is
that every person the which has passed the years of one and twenty ought for
to fast four times in the year the Embrynge time. De quatuor te^peribus habet
di. lxxvi. ca Jeiuniu^ and ca. co^stituim^ and ca. de xl. di. v. ca.
q^dragesima. De vigilus aplorum extra de obserua ieiu. c. consilia^ Qui vos
audit me audit. and ^ vos spernit me spernit Lu. x. Oia quecuque dixerit vobis
seruate and facite. Math. xxiii.
the vigyles commanded / and the forty days the which ends at Eester / if
he have not excusacyon lawfully / in like wise as it apyreth more plainly here
after in the treatise of confession. Unto these five commandments us byndeth
holy church unto the which we should obey as unto god / For he has said
that they the which obey unto the prelates of holy church him does obey /
and they that them dysobeye him dysobeyeth. By the the which it appyreth
clearly enough that they the which trespassen these commandments before
said synnen mortally if cause reasonable them excuse not in all or in part.

Here follows of two manner of lives the which ben in holy church. That is to
know of the life actyf and the life contemplatyf.
AS well for these things spoken as for these Caplm. xvij.
things the which folowen is well for to be noted that holy church is
comprysed in two estates. That is to know in the life actyf and in the life
contemplatyf the which unto us ben well sygnyfyed by two women the daughters
of one fader and of one mother / that is Martha and Mary mawdelayne dwelling in
one house the which chose our blessed savior Jhesu christ for to lodge there
and enhabyte. The life actyfe is the life as of them that been worldely the
which unto us is sygnyfyed by Martha / the which was desirous to lodge our
lord and his apostles / and to aparell them and to give them refeccyon in
betokenynge that they of the life actyfe ought for to excercyse them in the
works of mercy corporal. The life contemplatyf is the life of holy relygyon /
and that unto us is sygnyfyed by Mary mawdelayne the sister of Martha / the
which was at the feet of our lord herkenynge right swetely the right holy
doctrine of our lord the which is the bread and the refeccyon of the soul.
By the which it appyreth that the life contemplatyf excedeth in valor and in
dygnyte the life actyfe / in as much as the soul is more noble than the body
/ and the works of mercy spyrytuall ben more noble than these works
corporal. For in like wise as the excercyse and occupacyon of the actyfe is
against the body. In like wise the occupacyon of the life contemplatyfe is
pryncypally against these necessytees and for the prouffyte of the soul. But
not withstandymge that the life contemplatyfe is more higher and more noble /
she is not the less peryllous. For as much as the estate is more higher / the
fall or the defaute that a man there in may do is the more grievous. And
therefore may a man say that even in like wise as the rich worldely man of the
life actyfe is in pain and in thought for to get and to augmente goods
temporal* first for the necessyte of himself and of his / and following for to
give and to depart unto the pore in place and in time after good prudence and
that is the commandment of god upon the pain of deedly sin / and by the
consequent upon the pain of dampnacyon. In like wise the person relygyous and
contemplatyfe considering his pouerte and indygence spyrytuall and other
necessytees without nombre as well in himself as in his neighbors enforced
him and labored to socoure unto the one and unto the other / and of as much
as these dyuersytees as well corporal as spyrytuall ben the more gretter / of
as much grows the pain and the thought in y^ soul of the true relygyous
man charytable and contemplatyfe. Alas it is well understand and considered so
many we see of the blind / of meselles / the halte / the lame / croke backed /
foul and mysshapen / the which well understands by the sykenesse of the
body / and than that of the soul is much more grievous and also much more for
to be playned and redoubted than these sykenesses corporal in as much as the
soul is a more gretter thing than the body. And as now unto the purpose who
is more blynder than he the which gives or that leseth paradyse for to
purchase hell / Also who is more rotten or stynkynge / and detestable before
god and before all the court of heaven than ye miserable sinner / swollen by
pride / rotten foul / and stynkynge / by the sin of lecherye / wrong /
crockyd / and myshappes by the sin of couetyse of J^e / and of envy / and so
of other sins / in the which the soul is ordained as well against god as
against his neighbors / and also as broken and put out from the lygne and
ordinance of nature. And for as much he that loved his neighbor as himself
and him sees spyrytually in such aduersyte of sin dampnable the which is
the way and the danger of eternal dampnacyon may not have in his spyryte
gladness nor rest. But yt behooves that of as much as he loves his neighbors
more or less / that of as much / he is pyteous / heavy / and sorrowful of the
great ylle and excessyue folly of his friend. By the which appyreth the labor
and pyteous thoughts of the true contemplatyf / the which sees and
consydereth all most all the world out of the way and go unto perdycyon. It
appyred more over that as well in the life actyf as in the life contemplatyf / he
has great and peryllous labor unto whom well and merytoryously he will do
his devour / and that of good right / for pain thought and labor is the mean
for to come unto the reame / unto the which these blessed be come in doing
himself vyolence and by hard great and strong trybulacyons. And this vyolence
does the right true contemplatyf in hymblynge himself truly and in
repenting hy^ and all his works power and of no valor. For if any goods A
died^s ^oha^^i^ ^e^^^ celorum vim pati^ and violenti rapit illud. Math.x.
there were founden he ought for to know verily that such goods comes not
of himself but of the oonly bounte dyuyne the which is the fontayne of all
perfeccyon / and in such wise humblynge him truly he feleth in himself all
mysery and imperfeccyon there is great vyolence specially in those worldely
people the which begin for to do well / as it is for to make restytucyon
unto an other requyrynge pardonne / for to humble him in ^ntrynge in to
relygyon or in betakynge other true ways of penance. For it is a thing
natural unto a creature reasonable for to desire honor / glory / and gladness
/ pleasures / and all other excellentes and perfeccyons as well of the party
of the body as of the soul* But such is the condycyon of this valey of mysery
the which by humylyte it behooves to come unto honor / for to be vile and
dysprayse voluntaryly it behooves to come unto the glory the which is without
end. By contrycyon / sorrow / and pity / disease / compassyon / and
mortyfycacyon / man has purchased Joye / gladness and life eternal. And so all
other things that may be said or thought of the one the contrary behooves for
to come unto the other. For it is impossyble after the ordinance dyuyne for to
have paradyse in this world and in the other in coming from Joys /
gladnesses / pleasures / and delytes worldely unto the Joye and unto the reame
of paradyse. By the which a man may well understand / as for to live he must
deye / for to have Joye / he must weep to have all goodness for ever / him
behooves for to renounce unto himself / that is unto his sensualyte unto his
desires worldely natural / and all other goods wordely and temporal / and
for to take and enbrace hertely holy pouerte of spyryte above all the goods
worldely and temporal. And by these things beforsayd may a man clearly
understand the error and folly of these worldely people the which with all
their power sechen the felycyte worldely / for it is none other thing to say
or to do but for to flee and renounce unto the beatytude eternal. Also may a
man well understand that this meruayllous mutacyon and work of god when the
person vain and worldely him conuerteth and retorneth for to take the way of
paradyse the which is penance / and that in so doing has great vyolence as
it is said. Also the person contemplatyfe the which by the grace of A Cagitta
volante in die a negocio perambula^te in tenebris eb ^cursu and de monio
meridiano Psalmus. xc.
god is trewely propred of all his desires and pleasures vain and worldely /
ought soueraynly for to watch and for to keep him from the darte that the
devil casts subtylly / and right vnpyteously in the hour of myddaye / that
is the sin of presumptuous thoughts or vain glory that he brings unto
the creature by the reason o^ holy estate of graces spirituell and good works
the which of that maken a manner of light spyrytuall / and therefore they ben
lykened unto the hour of the myddaye / but oftentimes they ben the occasyon of
pride and of ruin who is not right strongely armed with humylyte / and the
which has not before him the bockeler of the f^^^ of god. And unto Beda.
that purpose says the honorable Beda / that for the great gifts / graces /
and reuelacyons that god has made unto saint Poule. He was fallen in pride and
in vain glory / notwithstanding his great and synguler science if god has
not let the devil for to tempte him much horrybly / and that / if that
temptacyon had not be / by the which he was in fere and in m^kenes he had been
fynably dampened. And therefore says well Isydore that the person the which
changed the Isidor^s.
estate and life from ylle unto good / or from good unto better / he ought
soueraynly to take heed that the vain glory of his estate / of hie graces /
and of his virtues make him not fall more lower and more grievously than he was
by his great vices and sins. Also he says more over that for noblenes of
estate / for conny^ge / for force / or other goods of nature or of grace no
man ought for to trust in himself or to gloryfye. For Lucyfer surmounted all
erthely creatures in all gifts and perfeccyons of nature / and nevertheless by
his pride and folysshe thinking is turned and fallen in to eternal
dampnacyon. Also Adam fauted much grievously Solomon with his great science.
Dauyd with his holiness / sayn^ Peter with his hardenes and with his stedfastnes
/ many Heremytes and Relygyous of great and excellent perfeccyon ben fynably
fallen / and all comenly by folysshe thoughts and presumpcyon of their estate.
And therefore says saint Austyn Augustinus.
that more it pleased unto god the person the which of sins makes humble
confession than of him the which of his graces and virtues him gives unto
pride and presumpcyon. And this unto us is declared in the gospel by the
example of the publycane Luce. xviij.
the which was a man mylcheuous and worldely / and of the pharysee of great
relygyon / of the which the sinner publycane humbled himself before god in
saying and cryenge that he was not worthy for to lift up the face against the
s^ye / and the pharysee him gloryfyed in bringing in to his mind how
oftentimes he fasted / he paid the demes / he gave alms and many other good
deeds / by the which he Juged in himself that he was much better than these
other / and that he resembled not unto these sinners worldely. And by such
pride and boostynge he was by the sentence of Jhesu christ reproved and
condampned / and the poor publycane by his contrycyon and humylyte approved
and Justyfyed.

Here folowen three reasons by the which we may be enduced to fere and to
mekenes.
HOr to hold him in fere and mekenes without Caplm. xviij
praysynge himself or granting unto any vain glory for the estate of
perfeccyon / or any other virtues or merytes. Here folowen three reasons taken
and drawn out of the book of life of Jhesu christ by the which well comprysed
and understand the spyryte devout and contemplatyfe may take great
meruayllous strength against his enemy the devil his aduer^arye and fervor to
prouffyte from good unto better. The first reason is that if we consider afte^
our little power the hyghnes infynyte of the dyuyne majesty / his wisdom / his
bounte / his honor / and his puyssaunce / and these other perfeccyons infynyte
the which ben in god / by the which he is worthy to be honored / served /
fered / and loved. We know clearly that all that that we may do / say / or
think in regard of these things abouesayd / is less tha^ naught / as is of
our part. And therefore to pride him for such seruy^e or any good works it is
a great folly / and after some things more gre^ouser and unto god more
dyspleasure than the pride of Lucyfer. The reason of good right is the first
for as much as all our works ought to be done pryncypally for the honor and
glory of god. The second reason is that if we consider the mekenes of our
lord Jhesu christ the Jniu^yes and reproues / and the pains and labors / and
finally the death and ^ffusyon of his precious blood / and how he has all
swetly borne and endured more than any understanding creature may speak or
think / and how all that he has pryncypally endured to the entente that he
may have the law of our her^es / for the which love unto us yet he will give
by his right abondau^t grace himself / his glory / and his reame. We see
clearly that all our good works in comparyson of so right great and paynfull
passion and of the great goods of glory / where in we trust ben less than
naught. This reason of good right unto the second / for as much that she
touche^ more hyer and incompreuable matter as these ^he which folowen / as is
the passion of Jhesu christ and of the glory of paradyse. The thyr^^ reason is
that if we consider the innocence and the perfeccyon that we have promised and
vowed unto holy baptem / the which we should hold and keep before god / as is
his commandment to love him with all our heart / with all our thought / and
with all our might and virtues. Also our neighbors as our self. And also that
for to please our blessed creator we should be annorned with all virtues / as
is faith / hope / charity / humylyte / pacyence / obedyence / chastyte / and so
of all other manner of virtues We find in a dystaunce / also as infynyte and in
the deep dyche of unkindness and of all imperfeccyn. The fourth reason is that
if we consider the great graces and great benefyces that god unto us has done
and does contynually as well in general as in partyculer / as well unto the
regard of the body as of the soul. We see derely that we ben acountable
against him without our power him to acquyte of as much as he is a more gretter
thing and a more vaylable than we for whom he it is all gives the which
thing is infynyte. For he unto us has given his image and his semblaunce in
our creacyon. God the fader us gives his oonly and his right dear sone
natural for our redempcyon. The which sone us gives his right holy flesh /
his sweet heart / and his right precious blood for a right dygne and spyrytuall
refeccyon. The blessed holy ghost also unto us gives his gifts and his graces
/ and by spyrytuall infusyon. All the blessed trynyte it promytteth for to give
unto us eternal beatyfycacyon. And in recompense of such things all our deed
is as no thing in the which it appyreth well the folysshe presumpcyon of many
people the which wenen for to prevail in great things before god. The fyfth
reason is that if we consider more over and in partyculer the honor / the Joye
/ the noblenes and the riches of paradyse / the which is without end and
without measure / as it is to see the blessed trynyte three persons in one
essence of dyuynyte. To see in like wise with our eyes corporell the right holy
humanyte of our savior Jhesus the which shall give unto all his faithful and
glorious chosen pleasant lokes / enbrasynges and sweet kyssynges. To see also
the sweet virgyn Mary mother and queen of all chosen. To see also the gerarchyes
heavenly and ordres of angels. To see and understand the union of all the
court celestyall. And how by charity he is taken and the parfyte goodness and
glory of that one is the wealth and the love of that other / for every man that
loved his neighbor as himself him enjoyed of the glory of his neighbors as
of his own / By this consyderacyon it appyreth clearly that that any humayne
creature may do for to come unto such a College and unto such honor is less
than naught. The sixte reason is that we consider profundely the great
dyfferent of a soul the which is in the estate of grace / unto yt the which
is in deedly sin. We see that that one is the daughter of god by grace and by
adopcyon enherytour of paradyse / and the espouse of Jhesu christ the temple of
the holy ghost / sanctuary and the habytacle of all the blessed trynyte / right
fair and right pleasant enorned and enryched with noble virtues more
bryghter and more shynynge spyrytually than ever may do the son corporally
But all the contrary is it of the soul in mortal sy^ne for she is ye
daughter and seruytour by i^uocaco^n of our goodly enemy the vessel the
stynkynge delytes and vanytees worldely / the temple of ydolatres deuyllesshe /
the false and unfaithful rybande the which has broken the faith and the
marriage between her and the king of kings Jhesus the sone of god the fader
for to submytte her unto the stynkynge lechery of ye mesell of devil angel
apostat By the which she is vile / horrible stynkynge more than any carayne as
well before god as before all the saints of paradyse. By the which it
appyreth that we should much enforce us to seche ye one estate and to flee the
other in as much as they ben of dyfference. And in so doing if god give us
not ye grace / there is none the which worldely him may thank. The seventh
reason for to see and know our feebleness and lyfell valor / is in the
consyderacyon of the life and of the virtues of holy faders / apostelles /
martyrs / confessors / and virgyns. Who where not of iron / or of stele / no
more than we be who have resyste unto the temptacyons of the devil / matted
and vaynquysshed their bodies by meruayllous penance and abstynence /
dyspraysed the world / and suffered martyrdoms terryble all oonly to think /
have purchased merytes / the fere and love of god / holding and keeping the
way of all holiness some in aege of their tender youth / as these blessed
virgyns saints and martyrs. Katheryne. Margarete. Annes. Barbare / and other
without nombre in diverse ages / estates / and vocacyons. And we the which have
their lives by doctrine and example and ye light of miracles yt god has done
for to approve ye holiness of their lives. And that the which is more we have
their aids and intercessyons how be it unto us they speak not. And
notwithstanding all these things we ben laches. froward and brought lightly
to fall and torn to impacyence / in to murmuracyon / in to vnhope / and in to
dyspayre. By the which appyreth well our little fraylte and little valor in
all these estates ye which at this day ben upon the earth. That is the year a
thousand and five hundred after the Incarnacyon and the years six thousand
six hundred three score and six that the world began after the conuocacyon of
the Hebrews and manner of nombre. The. viij reason is yt if every lynner should
consider the greuousnes ye great nombre and unkindness of his sins and ye
rygour of the Justyce dyuyne he should know clearly yt all the penance and
all the service ye he may do unto god till unto ye end of the world in byenge
again ye pain due unto his sins / it should be a thing of little valor in
comparyson of ye debt in ye which we be bound for our sy^nes. The ix. reason
is yt if we consider perfyte ye diverse manners and occasyons the which in an
hundred thousand manners comen and proceden by succession of time as well of ye
party of the world as of ye excuse of the devil and of ye fraylnes of our
power and miserable condicyon / we should defye above all of our strength and
our me^^tes and virtues in retornynge us above all unto god by ye true hope yt
every true christian man ought to have in god his creator fontayne and depnes of
mercy and of all swetnes. The.x. reason is that if we consider the Jugement of
god right Just the which is done at the hour of death and how him behooves to
yield acou^pte of all the goods yt we have received ben they goods of nature
/ of fortune / or of grace / till unto the last fardynge and of all the time
of our life till unto the closing of the eye. In like wise also the pureness of
conscience / the ornament of merytes and of virtues that we shall have before
god and the satysfaccyon of sins yt other times we have committee / we shall
see clearly yt our goodness is a little thing as unto yt yt we might have done
in comparyson of things beforsayd / and right great is our iperfeccyon.
The.xi. reason for to hold us in fere and in mekenes is that if we consydre
the shortness of this life / the necessyte to deye / the incertayne of ye hour
of a moment and of the estate we see clearly yt to little is the preparacyon /
the fere / and the dysposycyon the which shol de be in us for to receive such
adventure. The.xij. reason is that if we consydre the saying of saint Gregory /
that is to understand yt those the which will come unto saluaco^n should
always go from good unto better / and mou^te from virtue unto virtue or else
they go behind by sloth and neclygence / we see clearly that right little is
the profit / and right great and peryllous our sloth and neclygence. The.xiij
reason is that if we consydre perfytly the great and horrible pains of hell /
as unto the oppresses as unto the dyuersyte unto the multitude as well against
the body as against the soul and the eternyte of them the which every sinner
deserved in committing mortal sin / we know that all the penance that we
have done in time paste / and that we may do till unto the end of the world
/ it is a right little thing / and also as no thing if were not the merit of
the blessed passion in comparyson of our sins. Also we should enforce us of
body and of soul to hold such life by the which we may escape ye pains
beforsayd ye which ben more greter than man may tell or think so as
witnesses saint Austyn. These.xiij. reasons ben noted and drawn out of ye
book of ye life of Jhesu christ in great shortness. For ye spyryte devout and
contemplatyf unto this proprete as we few words dyuyned / he can read and
understand great and meruayllous sentences. And this is done by the aid and
virtue of ye holy ghost / the which en^umyned and lyfteth ye soul upward
from the puyssau^ces naturelles and him makes to taste and to savor the word
of god what so ever it be. For it is the meet spyrytuell the which gives
nourysshynge / force / augmentacyon / and puyssau^ce / unto every person the
which has in him the helte of grace. Also it is to be noted that the
resolucyon / end / and conclusyon of every one of these.xiij. reasons above
said is in two points. The first is to the end that the person the which
this present aduysement well reded and denoutly studied may in true humylyte
have clear knowledge of the lytelnes and imperfeccyon of all his works what so
ever they be / by the which knowledge he him shall defend from all vain glory
and shall see clo^ely the great folly and derkenes of ypocresye / vain glory /
and folysshe thoughts. The second point is yt the person the which will
here found his medytacyon may and ought to take fervor and desire to profit
in graces. in viues in clymmynge from steyre to steyre without ever him to
contempt till unto that that she may come unto the vysyon of god in the
royalme of paradyse. The which by his blessed grace unto us will give the fader
/ and the sone / and the holy ghost / one god in trynyte of persons.

Here follows the third party of this book in the which is made mencyon of
the seven works of mercy and it conteyneth five chapytres.


The Prologue.
AFter the treatise of haptem / of the artycles of the faith / and of the
commandments of the law / with the seven deedly sins / here follows
the.vij. works of mercy / and such is the reason of this order. For after
saint Gregory as much as Qua^tu^ credis tm^ speras quamtu^ credis and spastm^
diligisquamt^^ credis sperastm^ diligistm^ oparis. gre.
the person has of faith and of hope / as much and no more has of charity /
and as much as he has of charity / he has of the works of mercy. That is to
know / if he have little of charity he has little of good works. By the
works than shall be known the faith / the hope / and the charity. For as it is
said before / the faith is deed the which bears not the works of mercy. By
the which it is for to know that mercy is a noble virtue by the which a man
has compassyon and pity of his neighbor and of his mysery and necessyte. For
when it is so that by the commandment of god every creature ought for to love
his neighbor as himself / it follows that the ylle of an other ought for to
be the pity and compassyon of a true christian man obedyent unto the
commandments of god of nature. And for as much as man is of two natures /
that is to know corporal and spyrytuall / in every of these two parties / he
there may have pouerte / sykenes / or other necessyte. There are two manners of
mercyes / that is for to know corporell and spyrytuell.

Here follows the seven works of mercy in general. Caplm ^mu^

consequently in procedynge fron the lest unto y^ gretest to do and accomplysshe
the works of mercy corporel against his neighbor / a thing of great profit /
a thing due / and a thing necessary unto salvation. First it is a thing of
great profit / for as witnesses the holy scripture / in like wise as the
water quenched the fire / in lyky wise almesdede and mercy puts away the
sins / nor it may not be done that the soul the which truly has done
mercy in this world gooth unto pain and torment in the other. For god of
mercy infynyte loved as well every poor ^rrature humayne / the which has
pacyence in his pouerte / mysery / or necessyte / where that the which unto
him is done of goods and of pleasure for the love of him and of charity it is
reputed for to be done unto himself. And god god the which defended the sin
of unkindness the which is not to know the goodness and pleasure yt man has
received of an other / will grant the good the which has been done for the
love of him after as it apperteyned unto his dyuyne majesty. And for that he
promyseth mercy and the realm of paradyse unto all them the which
accomplysshe the works of mercy / and dampnacyon eternal the which in place
and in time due them do not accomplysshe. By the which it appyreth that to
excercyse him in the works of mercy is a thing of great and inestymable
prouffyte / and for to do the contrary it is the perdycyon of all goodness. Also
it is a thing oblygatorye / for all that that man may have in this world / be
it the body / the soul / or the goods worldely / he holds all of god / ben
they temporell or spyrytuell. Who commands upon the pain of death that a man
do mercy unto his neighbor / for else a man shall not find the mercy of god
/ without the which no Estote misericordes sicut p^ vester misericors e^. lu.

creature may have salvation. And here appyreth the excellent mercy and bounte
infynyte of god against nature humayne / unto whom he gives the goods
worldely and temporal / by the which she may purchase the goods of glory
the which ben eternal. But here may be demanded of him the A questyon.
which has desire him for to save by what commandment and by what law he
is bound for to do mercy / and in what manner he ought for to seche it. By the
which it is for to understand that for to do mercy it is commanded in the
law of nature / in the law dyuyne / and in the law Canon. The law of nature
commanded for to love his neighbor / for naturally every thing loves his
semblable. Now it is so that if true love Oe^ aial diligit sibi sile. Probatio
dilecto^is exhibitio est operis. Eregorius Amice ad ^d ven^sti. Mathei.xxvi.
be in the heart / she is shows by works outward if it be possible / for
else there is no love. Also the law dyuyne commanded for to love his
neighbor as himself / and in that doing promytteth god the life of glory /
and unto them that do it not the death eternal. The seven works of mercy ben
No^ m^mini mala morte mortuu^ ^ l^ benter opera pietas exercuit. hz ei multos
i^tercessores et i^possibile e^ oro^es multorum n^ exaudiri Amb. in li. de offi.
understand to be commanded in the fourth commandment the which is for to
honor fader and mother. Also the law Canon commanded to do socour unto thy
neighbor in necessyte / who so ever loved god loved that that loves him / and
therefore says a man comenly / he that loved me loved my hounde. Now is it so
that god loved every erthely person / as it appyreth by the gospel the same
of his traitor Judas. Or else he unto him he should not give life being nor
no substance and he should not tarry for to penance. By the which it
behooves for to conclude / that who so loves not his neighbor / loves not
god in like wise as he commands him. But rest for to see when and in what
manner a man ought to accomplysshe the commandment to do mercy upon pain of
deedly sin. By the which it is to be noted that when any person has of the
goods of this world after the necessyte of his estate and of his condycyon /
and more over has habondaunce of goods of the which he it may well spare and
his neighbor it require in his great necessyte F^^i eliosina^ pauperis ne
defraudes. Et se^tur. Read illi debitu^ tuu^. ecl. quarto ca.
that he him aid by lone or other wise of his habondaunce / the which he
entendeth nor for to leave / as well or better in other works of charity / than
if that he by his coueytousnesse defaute of charity he it refuses unto his
neighbors / he synneth there in mortally. In the which it appyreth clearly
that the sin and the peril of dampnacyon of them the which have habondau^ce
of worldely goods / and they see from day to day great multitude of poor
people in trybulacyon and necessyte without yeldynge and payenge them that that
they unto them should by the right of nature and the commandment of god /
that is for to do unto Qua^ difficile dives itrabit regnu^ ^elorum. Math.xix.
them alms and charity. And therefore says Jhesu christ in the gospel /
that they that have habondaunce of worldely goods / with great pain Diuicias^
paupertates ne dederis mihi s^^^ victu^ meo tribue necessaria.
shall have the realm of paradyse. By the which Thobye replete with the holy
ghost / required of god that he would not give him in this world great
habondau^ce of rychesses / but all oonly unto the necessyte of this life. The
which thing is much ^^e^tit amor ^^^mi quetu^ ipsa pecu^ia crescit. Ora.
contrary unto the couetyse of these worldely people / the which have never
suffycent for any habondaunce / but always desyren to have more / not all
oonly for to give habondauntly / but for ye appetyte insacyable to feed. Rest
than to see of every work of mercy in partyculer.

Here follows of every work of mercy in partyculer.
THe first work of mercy / that is to give Caplm.ij.
meet unto him the which is in necessyte / for without mete no man may live
nor long endure. The second is to give drink. for without drink no man may
dygeste nor conserve the health of the body humayne / and it ought for to be
understand of them the which ben in pouerte / in sykenes / in age / or other
necessyte / wherefore they may not get their living / and they have none other
the which unto them mynystreth. Or of those the which have auouwed pouerte
euangelyke / and not of other the which may well get their living / but by
their sloth and trewandyse they would live of alms without labor. The
third is for to cloth^ and to cover the poor humayne bodies of his
neighbors. The fourth is for to gadre in to his house these poor pilgrims /
and them the which have not where for to harborowe them. The fyfth is by pity
and compassyon for to vysyte the syke people in doing unto them aid and
consolacyon. The sixth is to aid the poor prisoners to deliver them and put
them at lyberte. The seventh is to burye them that been deed / in deed or in
will if other is accomplysshe not. For the good will suffyseth before god /
when a man may not do it in work outward / or that other the which has more
greter dysposycyon it puts in execucyon.

Here follows the circu^stau^ces for to accomplysshe the works of mercy
merytoryously.
IN that yt these works of mercy beforsayd Cap^m. iij.
ben unto god pleasant and merytoryous unto salvation / they ought to be done
Joyfully / charitably / lyberally / and faithfully. First they ought for to be
done Joyfully / sythen that god promytteth that for one penny given he him shall
yield an Ce^tuplu^ accipiet^ and vita^ eternal possi debi^. Math. xix.
hundred. That is for to say for these little worldely temporal goods
dystrybuted and given for the love of him / he shall give the goods spyrytuell
of grace in this world / and the royalme of glory in paradyse. The which ben
more greter things in regard of goods temporal than is the nombre of an
hundred / for to see an hundred myllyons in comparyson of one. And this
understood right evil these worldely people the which right Joyously given*
unto the devil great things by large dyspenses done in pompes / in boostynges
/ and in exceeding of diverse abylymentes and great gifts unto the rich
worldely people / but with great pain and with grutchynge they given an half
penny or a penny unto Jhesu christ. Seco^dely almesdede ought to be done
charitably / that is that a man has love unto god and unto his neighbors. And
of this have we an example in Cayn and Abell / and for that that Abell Si
offers mun^ tuum ad altar and ibi recordatus fue^ qrfrat tuus habuerit ali^d
aduersu^ terelinq^ ibi munus tuum an^ altar and vade prius reco^siliari fratri
tuo and tu^c ven^e^s offeres munus tuu^. Math. v.
was in charity his oblacyons / sacryfyces / and almesdedes were to god
acceptable and not those of Cayn / for that that he hated his neighbor. And
therefore says our lord in the gospel / if thou offer any thing unto god
have first charity unto thy neighbor / for otherwise it is not unto god
pleasant nor profitable unto salvation. Thyrdly almesdede ought to be done
lyberally / that is to say with good will after thy power / in like wise as
Thobye taught his sone. If you have great abondaunce give abondauntly / if thou
have little give little / if thou have mean give mean / for Jhesu christ
wylled and commands that his almesdedes ben prudent and dyscrete. And that
is against them the which given unto bastelours. unto trewandes and other
dysceyuers of the people the which have no good title for to beg / or the
which should labor and get their living. Fourthly almesdede Honora d^m
detua substancia. ^uer. iii. Qui offert sacrificiu^ de substa^cia pauperis
sicut ^ victimat filiu^ in ^spectu pris. ccc^. ^
ought to be done faithfully / that is to understand of a thing of valor /
and at time and place where it ought to be done. Also almesdede ought to be
done of the propre substance of him the which does it / and not of an other
man's goods / and of that the which ought for to be restored. Also it ought
Miserere a^e tue bn^place^s deo. cc^.
for to be done ordynatly / that is for to know unto him self first / and
folowyngly unto them unto whom a man is most beholden by the law of nature
/ as is fader and mother / sister and br^der / and so of other. For otherwise it
is to understand to dysprayse his neighbor in necessyte / and to aid him the
which should be a stranger / it should be cruelte more than it should be
mercy or charity. How be it they ben great these works done and accomplysshed
in the estate of grace unto god pleasant and prouffytable unto the soul / it
appyreth by the gospel where god us techeth that of that he should hold his
Jugement / in saying unto them the which have accomplysshed the said works
of mercy. Come you ye blessed of ^enite ^^dicti pa^ris mei possidete peratu^

god my fader and receive the realm of paradyse the which is made ready unto
you from the beginning of the world. I have had hongre and thorste and ye
have given me meet and drink / I have been a pilgrim and ye have herborowed
me. I had need of clothes and ye have clothed me. I have been syke and ye have
vysyted me. I have been in prison and ye have recomforted me. And than these
blessed shall demand not by Ignorance / but by admyracyon. Our master king
and lord when we see the to have thorste and hongre / we the recomforted. And
the blessed Jhesu christ unto them shall answer. Trewely I say you that /
that the which ye have done unto one of the least of my bredern I it repute
for to be done as unto my self. Also he shall say unto them the which shall
be on the lift hand the which have done no works of mercy. Depart you fro
me acursyd of god / and ye shall go to the fire of hell eternal the which
unto you is made ready with the deuylles. I have had hongre and thorste and ye
have not given me that I might drink and e^te. I have demanded lodgynde / and
ye would not lodge me. I have been naked and ye would not clothe me. I have been
syke and ye would not bysyte me. Than these accursyd shall say by admyracyon.
Lord when we see the to have hongre and thorste demanding lodging / syke
and in necessyte we have not comforted the. Than Jhesu christ unto them shall
answer. I say you in that that ye have not had will to do unto the poor for
the love of me / ye me have ^efused to do. And sythen that it is so that ye
would not lodge me in your houses in the person of my poor people. I ought
not you nor will not lodge you in the royalme of paradyse. And therefore go you
with all the deuylles in to the fire of hell eternal. And here is the
sentence and consummacyon of all the world and of the great Jugement that all
folk abydes. By the which sentence it apyreth that much more noble more sure
and more dygne is the estate of holy pouerte / or of life contemplatyfe / than
of rychesses worldely / the which is the life actyfe. Also every creature
ought well to take heed in his heart if he be poor rich or mean. The poor
by what title in what necessyte / and by what intencyon / he requires and
takes alms / for if in beggynge he makes him poor or impotent for to win his living he sinned right grievously as a thief and is bound to make
restytucyon. In the which it appyreth the theeft and dampnacyon of many the
which run through crystendom / y^ which after men their lesynges and falsenes
/ that many abbayes / chirches / hospytalles / colleges and monaste ryes that
they namen may not be sustained reedyfyed nor the poor people to be comforted
without the almesdede of people / of whom they demaunden oftentimes for to
enryche themself. The mean is he the which is neither rich nor poor / but
all oonly has his necessyte that he receives for suffysaunce. And he is in as
great surete as the rich is in great danger. For to give unduly it is a
thing of punycyon / and not to give what charity it commanded / and necessyte
it required / it is against god / and he sinned / and this is as now unto the
works of mercy corporal.

Here follows the works of mercy spyrytuall.
HEre follows of the works of mercy spyrytuell Caplm.iiij.
of the which it is for to understand that during this life there ben two
estates / or two manner of lives. That is the estate of the life actyf as ben
people married or not married / ben they noblesse / burgeyses / marchaundes /
laborers / or of any oter craft / of the whom the vocacyon and occupacyon
ben in these things worldely and erthely. The other estate is of them of the
life contemplatyfe / as ben the people of the church / and pryncypally
relygyous men who should take heed unto the service of god / and unto things
spyrytuall / as well for them as for those of the life acty* By the mean of
whom they be sustained in their necessytees corporelles / that
notwithstanding it is right conuenyent that the one estate take part with the
other / for none ought for to be all oonly actyue / but that he have some
thing of the live contemplatyue. And in like wise the contemplatyue him ought
for to excercyse in some occupacyon corporell in place and in time after good
dyscrecyon / and for as much as the life actyue is good / and also that the
life contemplatyue is much more better / he that might perfaytly have these
tweyne he should be right parfyte for the estate of this present life. But for
to have parfaytly these two things it is the synguler preuylege of the holy
blessed virgyn Mary and of Jhesu christ her oonly sone in as much as he is
man. For two lives unto us were full well sygnyfyed and fygured in Martha and
in Mary Mawdelayne / as it is said before / with the which women systers / and
dwellers in one self house the blessed Jhesu Intrauit ^^^us quoth da^ castellsi.
Luc.x.
christ with his apostles took his lodging / showing unto us yt he would be and
dwell in the house of holy chirch co^posid and united of these two lives
beforsayd in like wise as ye body and the soul ben but one person. And for as
much yt no man may come from yt life unto ye realm of paradyse but by ye way
of ^cy In like wise as these actyues ben pryncypally bou^ de unto ye works of
mercy corporal so as it has been made mencyon before for as much as they have
ye goods worldely and corporal. Even in like wise those of ye life
conte^platyf the^ pryncypaly occupy and excercyse these works of mercy
spirytuell. For Estote misericor^es sicut pater ve ^er misericors est Luce.vi.
of as much as the soul is a more gretter thing than the body / of as much
these pouertees / syknesses / and indygence of the soul may be more gretter
than those of the body. And unto this purpose we Exemplum.
read such an example. There was but late an holy heremyte excellent in
contemplaco^n / and in the exercyte or using of life spyrytuall / the which yt
not with standing he cou^seylled with an other holy abbot touching the deed of
conscience unto him declarynge yt he has yet such pouerte and defaute of
perfecco^n that when he sees the sins and imperfeceyons of some of his
christian brother / he ^e him might well and Joyously receive in his company. But
right gladly he receives those in whom he knows great goodness and them he
socoureth Joyously in their necessytees. And than the holy abbot seeing the
imperfeccyon of him the which should have dyscrecyon of necessytees humayne
and more to peyse the spyrytuelles than the corporelles / he began to weep in
saying. Alas well we should ameruayle y^ innocence of humayne bodies / for
against the great mercy of our neighbors we ben dulled and avenged more cruelly
than bestes. For hogs and other bestes and birds saying their semblable
cryenge and in some necessyte / them enforce to socour the^ and to show them
the sign of compassyon. And therefore I answer the unto yt yt you have purposed
unto me y^ in receyuynge Joyously the good person you do a little good / but
if you receive pyteously and in co^passyon the poor sinner in showing hy^ his
salvation you do a more gretter almesdede in as much as he is in more greter
necessyte than the good person. He should be right dulle and full of great
cruelte ye which sees his very brother almoost rotten of mesellery deye and in
anguysshe of hongre and of thorste / bound and imprisoned in the prison of his
mortal enemies if he him may aid and conforte / and he him leued before he
deyed without having of him pity and compassyon. Now is it than so that
mortal sin in the soul of our christian brother is much horrible mesellery
and more greter pouerte and wretchydnes than is the necessyte corporell before
said. By the which it appyreth in what pity and compassyon should be the
which see from day to day so many of sins and so horrible as well in our
self as in our brother christian men. And therefore ought well to take heed every
creature in right of himself the mean to acquyte him in accomplysshynge ye
works of mercy spyrytuell / the which ben pryncypaly seven understood by
the latin that follows. Lonsule / castiga / solare / remitte / fer / ora. That
is to say that every man is bound in place and in time to counsel and to
teache his neighbor. To chastyse him if it apertayne. To pardo^ne him his
defaute. To comfort him. To endure. And for his necessyte unto god and unto
his saints to make devout orysons.

Here folowen.xij. manners of almesdedes spirytuell.
AFter some doctors mercy spyrytuell is dyuysed Caplm.v.
in.xij. branches. The first is when a man pardonned whylfully for ye love of
god them the which have offended. And it is understood when they them
repent and require pardonne / or where a man is ready and appareylled that to
do as many times and as often as they will require pardonne. How much such
work is unto god pleasau^te Si dimiseri^ holb^ peta^ ^o^ dimittet vobis p^ v^
ce(...)s de^^^ta vra^. Si au^t no^ dim^se^^^ ^oib^ nec patvrster dimittet vobis
peta^ vra^. Mathe^. vi.
it appyreth by the gospel by the which our lord says and promytted that if
we pardonne parfectly for the love of him unto our neighbors the offense that
they have committed against us / he unto us pardonned the great offenses and
infynyte that we have done against him / as oftentimes and as many as we
trespassen his commandment and it is that that we him requere from day to
day when we say our Pater noster. Et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos
dimittimus debitoribus nostris. That is for to say god our fader will ye
pardonne us our great and infynyte defautes that we have committed against you.
In like wise as for the love of you we pardonne our neighbors the little
offenses that they have committed against us / The peril not to accomplysshe
this work and commandment appyreth clearly by that / that Jhesu christ says
in the gospel that if we pardonne not with heart unto those the which has us
offended / god the fader shall never pardonne us the great offenses that we
unto him have done. And so for to do unto us he would well give an example on
the tree of the cross when he pardonned Pater dimitte il^s no^ ei nesciu^t ^d
faciu^t. Luce. xxiii.
them the which made him to deye in prayenge swetly god ye fader for them. We
should put out the rancoure and ylle will of mysdede and show in deed and in
words tokens of love unto him the which duly him repented But unto hy^ the
which required not pardon it suffysed to pardon ye rancoure and to show hy^
tokens of love in words or other wise And this is of perfeccyon and of
necessyte of saluacy on after as Bonauenture says and saint Thomas And in like
wise is understand y^ word of Jhesu christ yt says / pardon thy neighbor
which the has offended. And we should not pardon one time ^^ne quotie^s

alonely but as many times and often as of that to do we ben duly required for
the love of god / nevertheless we may Justely require satysfaccyon of the
Iniurye or damage ye which unto us has been done or said. For yt is not
against charity / but there to is bounden he the which has offended. The
second manner of mercy is to correct charitably the sins and defautes that a
man has perceived in his neighbor. And for as much as these sins ben great
meruayllous and open in many people / who so ever desired to do the
commandment of god and the salvation of his soul may make such a questyon.
That is to know when and in what A questyon.
manner a man is bound to correct his neighbor upon ye pain of deedly sin
/ the answer. Unto The answe^
that there ben two manner of correccyons. The one is of necessyte of Justyce /
the other of necessyte of charity. Correccyon of Justyce apertayned alonely
unto them ye which has any prelaco^n upon a another / as is ye good man of the
house in his house / the which may have his wife / his childern / and his
servants / unto whom he should do correccyon after as it aperteyned unto his
Jurisdiccyon not all oonly by charity / but with yt by Justyce to the end to
acquyte him and to give example. Also these curates these abbottes / bysshoppes
/ and other prelates against their subgectes after as it apertayned unto their
Jurisdiccyon. Also kings / dukes / earls / and other nobles / and their
officers after the Jurisdiccyon and office yt unto them apertayned in the
which they should hepe and do mercy unto those the which them repent and
promyttynge correccion and rygour of Justyce unto obstynates and persevering
their malice / For if they pay not yt yt they should / that is to know Qui

mercy and Justyce they dyspose them unto dampnacyon. The second correccion ye
which is of the necessyte of true charity apertayned not all oonly unto the
prelates of holy church / or unto these lords erthely / but with y^ unto all
them unto whom god commanded to love their neighbors as them self. And for
as much as every man is bound him to repent and correct of his own propre
sin / it follows yt he ye which is bound to love his neighbor as himself
that he ought to do his power hy^ to correct and amend / or else there is
not in him true charity / in like wise as god commanded upon pain of deedly
sin. But it is well to be noted that after as sayen these doctors of
theologye six condycyons ben requysyte before that a man sinned mortally in not
correctynge his neighbor / of the which three ben in the regard of him the
which ought for to correct / and these other three ben in regard of him the
which ought for be corrected. The first is when that he the which ought to
corecte is certain of ye sin of his neighbor. for of sy^nes secret a man
is not bound so straytly. The second is that the correccyon be sweet or
pyteous syns yt it ought to proceed of charity. The third is yt there is none
other unto whom it appertayned more couenably for to correct. For if an other
do it / it shall acquyte suffycyently them the which else had been holden to
correct. The first condycyon of the party of the sinner is that he have in
him such dysposycyon that a man may hope that for the correccyon he is the
less worth / as it may be a person dronken / a lecherous man / a man of great
turour or of obstynate yt a man may not trust correcco^n / than a man ought to
dyfferre and abide the place time and oportunyte to do it. For in such caas
suffysed pity charytable and good will. The second condycyon is where the
sin of him that a man ought to corecte is mortal / or that is may be very
semblable. For as for venyall sin a man is not bound to correct upon the
pain of deedly sin. But is bound all oonly for to counseyll / and after
good congruyte / and this gives well to understand the gospel the which
says. Correct thy neighbor / and if by thy correccyon he be converted thou
have won him. By the which it follows after as says saint Gregory / that
the sin whereof he has been corrected was mortal. For for a little sin a
man is not lost and dampened. Also if a man were bound for to correct every
defaute / or feebleness venyell the which contynually is in many / full few it
should savor / and if it were not that the transgressyon of that commandment
were in every deed of their conscience. The third condycyon that he there have
place time and oportunyte. Be it than so spoken and concluded. That who so ever
knows ye mortal sin of his neighbor and the peril of his dampnaco^n and
has place time and oportunyte for to correct / and there is none other ye
which does by oblygacyon or other wise / and it is very like yt if he were
correct and so he hy^ should amend. Than and not else a man is holden upon
the pain of deedly sin him to advise swetly and charitably / for else a man
trespasseth the commandment of god and of nature / the which is to love god
his creatoure with all his heart abone all things / and in like wise his
neighbor as himself. When it is so than / that the most grettest Qui no^
diligit fratre^ suu^ que^ videt. deu^ que^ no^ videt quo^ po^t diligere. 1. to.
iiii. ca. Amor dei nunquam e^ ociousus. operat em^ magna si est. si vero
renuerit operari amor no^ e^. hec gre
mysery that may be in man is the estate of deedly sin / how may it than be
that any man loves his neighbor as himself if he socoure not him unto his
power in such necessyte. Also saint John says in his Canon that he the which
loves not his neighbor may not love god faithfully / love may not be hid.
For if any man have true love he shall show it in works by accomplysshynge
the works of mercy in doing things great or little after the quantyte of his
love / in like wise as witnesses saint Gregory. And therefore he the which
has trewely the love of god in his heart dyspayreth not lyghtely the
correccyon of his neighbor / and him enforces for to correct him in the
virtue of the holy ghost / the which may all things. The third manner of
mercy spyrytuell is to teache them the which ben ignorant / by the which
techynge the soul is fed with the bread of holy doctrine. In like wise as
the body is nourysshed and sustained with meet corporell. And if it be so than
that for to give meet and drink unto the poor for the necessyte of the body
god promytteth the royalme of paradyse. For by the more gretter reason he shall
give his glory unto them the which for the love of him given unto the souls
good and holy techynge. For of as much Mayor e^ refecti^ me^^ quam ve^tris. ^u^
as the soul is more dygne than the body / of as much the meet and the
refeccyon spyrytuell is more noble than that of the body. Sythen it is so than
that the most party of our neighbors ben in languore of ignorance / and
that the horrible famyne inuadeth all most all the world for the defaute of
bread spyrytuell / that is for to understand of holy doctrine / as it may be
to save him the which has science and knowledge of things the which
apperteynen unto the salvation of ye soul and sees his neighbor deye in
languysshynge for Eterne d^nati^^^s pena^ icurrit p^ dicator ^ semen diuini vbi
no^ s^git. xliiii. di.
the defaute of this doctrine / certain with great pain may he be excused
before god of the commandment to accomplysse mercy. Some ben bound to teache
and to depart the meet and holy docryne because Uos es^ lur mu^d^vos estis
sal terre. Mathei. v.
of their office / as these prelates of holy church / and these prechours the
which for such vocacyons they ben called the light of the world / and the
salt of the earth. For they given light and techen the people simple and
ignorant / and unto them given good savor and devotion in preserving them
to their power from the stenche and corrupcyon of all sin by good example of
life / by good doctrine and good exortacyon / and in so doing the holy fader of
mercy unto them promised to make the^ great in ye reame of paradyse. Also
curates / faders / and moders / godfaders / and godmoders / ancient people /
masters of scole / and other ought them to acquyte against them of whom they
have charge / in techynge them / and repreuynge them of their defautes after
as it is said before in the matter of correccyon as well fraternall as of
Jurysdyccyon. The fourth manner of mercy spyrytuall is to recomforte them
discomforted / and this work is much necessary. For by heaviness and desolacyon
oftymes a man falls in to dyspayre / and from dyspayre unto eternal
dampnaco^n And therefore who so ever charitably conforted the dyscomforted he
draws him back from hell as much as in him is. The which thing is as
much pleasant unto god / as much as is ye great love of the which he loved
his creature / for whom to save and preserve from dampnacyon he has wylled to
deye. By ye which it follows yt to comfort these dyscomforted is a work of
right excellent merit before god. To counsel and to comfort is ye office
right synguler / as well of the blessed Jhesu christ as of the blessed holy
ghost. By the which it apyreth that he the which accomplysshed not the work
of recomforte ye dyscomforted when there is place and time committed as much
great ylle as it is to do great good merytoryous and pleasant unto god. The
fyfth manner of almesdede spyrytuall is to comfort Ego rogabo pre^m and aliu^
peraclitu^ dabit vobis. Io. xiiii Paraclitus au^t ^de^ est quoth consolator.
and to enhardy those to do well the which ben weke in spyryte / many there
ben the which done great things virtuous and merytoryous / but by the vice
and sin of pusyllanymyte or cowardyse / they are not undertake to come unto
so great goodness. Wherefore them to enhardy and them to give courage to do and
undertake these things the which ben unto the glory of god and of the
salvation of their souls is the work of much great charity and much
pleasant and merytoryous before god and by the consequent the defaute of that
to do and accomplysshe is much peryllous and dyspleasaunt unto god / and
specially in them unto whom it appertayned by their office the estate and
vocacyons to make strong and exorte the comen people to do well as ben the
people of the church / ben they prelates / curates / relygyous / or other. And
when it shall happen that they should as to make strong sustain and to aid
these other for to undertake works merytoryous in wekynge them and
dyscouragynge / be it by their evil example or otherwise well nere al shall be
lost and wasted. The sixth manner of almesde St lume^ quoth ^ te(...)tenebre sunt
totu^ corpus tenebrosu^ erit. Luce. xi. Alter alterius onera portate and sic
adiplebitis lege^ rp^i. Rursu^ crucifigentes sibimetipsis filiu^ dei and hoste^

de spyrytuell is to supporte the feblenesses of his neighbors / the which
thing he ought to do by very compassyon / by oryson / and by good dyscrecyon
of correccyon in preserving them from the occasyon of sin / and finding the
remedies and means them to reduce and amend after as it may be possible by
the manner beforsayd of correccyon fraternall. For sythen it is so yt all the
blood of Jhesu christ had been given and shed for the precyousnes of the soul
the which is the image of the blessed trynyte the temple and habytacyon of the
holy ghost the love and the delytes of Jhesu christ / and the which may come
unto the beatytude eternal of paradyse / as may the true catholyke the
servant of Jhesu christ seen and known without great compassyon and without
effusyon of teeres so noble a creature consecrated of god by the holy cream
and the espouse of Jhesu christ put and abandonned unto the foul lykenes of
deuylles / fylthy / vile / and dysfygured by sin / some more than deuylles /
by the which the blood and passion of Jhesu christ ben much more dyspraysed
than the thing foiled and trodden under the feet of all manner of beestes. Alas
more than a thousand time alas alas how think we to be faithful unto Jhesu
christ and to see such pity and such deluge of souls specially christian men
without anguysshe and compassyon the which is no thing if it be not showed in
the works of mercy. The.vij. manner of almesdede spyrytuall is / to hid / to
cover / and to anguysshe the ylle and dyffame of his neighbor / not to
publysshe and show it by envy or any other cursyd entencyon. For sythen it is
so that good renown is a great goodness noble and spyrytuall / as how may it be
done that any man loves god and his neighbor if he unto him yield not and
conserve his good renown in covering his sins / his defautes and his
fragylytees. Certes it is impossyble / and in as much as the sin of our
neighbor is much great / of as meche have we the more gretter matter for to
accomplysshe against him the more gretter mercy / and for to have against god
humylyte / fere / and love / in byleuynge certaynely that never creature did
sin so great or detestable / but that we may do more gretter or semblable if
god keep us not and the service of these blessed angeles. And in like wise as
of such sin I shol de have will it for to hid. In like wise every man it
ought to do again his neighbor by very co^passyon and charity. The.viij. manner
of almesde de spyrytuall is to exhort and meoue the good to prouffyte from
good unto better / in showing them that they them keep to presume folysshly of
their good works / of the which the honor and the glory apperteyned all
oonly unto god. Also that they have in fere and in hate the favor and the
praise of the worldely people / the which often times taken and magnyfyen that
the which god reproves and punyssheth. Of such favors makes A sagita
vola^te in die a negotio peram bulante etc. p^s. xc.
oftentimes the devil his darte or his arowe the which he casts in the
mydde day / that is the vain glory the which taken these great foyles and
full little well auysed of good works. Also ben they aduysed that for any life
or penance of time passed they be not of all assured for to be perfaytely
acquyted before god. And therefore watchen they upon their ward in full great
fere and in humylyte / in bringing oftentimes to mind the estate and the
fervor from whens saint Peter fell the which so pyteously forsook his
creatore. Also Dauyd. Solomon. Sampson. and other many excellent in merytes and
in hyghenes of life comtemplatyfe / of the whom is made mencyon of the lives of
saints / ben fallen in great and pyteous No^ su^ sicut ^ete^^ hoi^m raptores
i^ ^ sti adulter^ ve^ut etia^ hic publicanus etc. xviii. ca.
inconuenyences. And comenly the rote and the foundacyon of their temptacyons
has been to presume of themself / and to dysprayse poor sinners for one of the
grettest temptacyons unto people of devotion is to compare their life of
penance / great / noble / and excellent unto the pouerte and unto the mysery
and feebleness of their neighbors the which ben in great and horrible sins.
And by this mean fell and him enpryded the pharysee of whom maked mencyon
the holy text of the gospel. But those the which ben taught and inspyred
prouffyten greatly unto the occasyon of the sins of their neighbors. For of
that they humble them unto god / en knowlechynge that it is more greter gift
of god to preserve any from the falling unto sin / than him for to areyse
after that he is fallen. And if it be so that the life and the merytes of many
relygyous and other the which yet ben at this day is a little thing in
comparyson of the life and holiness of them beforsayd. Who oftentimes have so
gretely failed / what is he the which ought to trust in himself or his
merytes. The.ix. manner of almesdede spyrytuall is to give good counseyll in
things spyrytuell / and this work is much pleasant unto god / and of great
merit unto them that it may do in confermynge him unto the blessed Vocab^^
nome^ eius admirabilis consilia rius deus fortis etc. ysaie. ix. ca.
Jhesu christ / the which for his example and doctrine is named the tongue of
great counseyll. The gretenes of this work and the merit may be considered
in the hyghenes and dyffyculte of the cause of the Juge and of the party
adversary. The cause is for to lose / or for to win paradyse. The Juge is god
almighty / and all knowing / by the which falls excusacyon / cautelles /
cauyllacyons / appellacyons / dylacyons / fere / favors / gifts / or
promysses / have no place in this court for to peruerte Justyce. The
aduersarye is the devil of whom the malycyous cautell and to excuse his
practyse and long experyence surmounten all natural intendement of humayne
creature. And therefore when a man sees that the devil dysceyued enmused and
entysed the poor creature humayne for to dampne him and for to make him to
lose paradyse / it is a much excellent work of charity to counseyll him the
mean for to withstand the malice of the devil / and him for to aid for to
come to win and to possede so noble an heritage as is the royalme of
paradyse. But every intendement ought well for to have in him meruayllous pity
and compassyon of the most grettest party of them living the which an
hundred thousand times ben more dylygent to such counseyll / to purchase or
for to defend their right in two or three feet of land / of dwellynges / than
they do for to purchase the royalme of paradyse / the which unto them
apperteyned by true right of heritage. The which unto us has plainly and
right lawfully purchased our fader Jhesu christ. And of that folly has other
times found the experyence the which follows. The years a thousand four
hundred four score and three / a noble man of the royalme of France unto his
goostly fader reknowleged and confessed upon the loyalte of his faith that he
pleated by three years in the grande or great assyse in the Cite of Bourgeys for
the right that belened to have three half pens of rent by the year / and he
was not yet at the fine nor end of his cause / but he abode in doubt for to
lose or to win / and he affermed that with his costs and his dyspenses as
well of his moeuable as of his heritage / he has taken the best counseyll
that unto him was possible for to find / and after the relacyon / and the
which me seemed very semblable / he might have made more than an hundred miles
upon land. And a semblable thing make many of other worldely people the
which make not one mile nor yet half a mile for to seche one good counsel
of conscience. By the which it behooved for to conclude that cause of many done
ylle is for that they run from the great and infynyte Justyce of Jhesu
christ. The.x. manner of almesdede is for to pacyfye and accord them the which
ben in dyscorde. And how be it it is great this work and merytoryous before
god / it appyreth that it is for to undo that that the devil has done / and
for to do that that Jhesu christ is comen for to do in this world / and has
showed by his example and commandment for to do. The labor and operacyon of
the devil is for to put noyses / debates / wars / and dyuysyons in all
estates / for the which comes pletynges / hates / debates / and oftentimes
murdres / great loss of goods and of bodies and of souls / for who that
hated his neighbor lesed god the which may not abide but in the conscience of
him the which has peace with his neighbor. And therefore when our lord was
borne for to fight and for to destroy the puyssaunce of the devil he did do
cry with the sound of trompettes of paradyse peace in earth And therefore of
good right he is named king of Gloria in ex^^i^l^ deo. and in terra pax hoibus
bone vol^tatis. Luce.ii.
Jherusalem and prince of peace. By the which it appyreth that for to put peace
and unity between them the which ben at dyscorde debate or dyuysyon it is for
to do as much great service unto the king of peace in him prepayrynge the
chamber and the habytacyon where he will enhabyte and rest / the which
service and office may not be done without great retrybucyon. And by the
contrary for to put dyuysyon war and debate between any persons is proprely
the office of the devil and of his members. And therefore says holy Sex su^t ^
odit d^us and septimu^ detestatur aia eius prouer. vi
scripture that there ben.vi. things that god hates much / but the seventh
he hates soueraynly. The first of the six is pride. For our lord is of
humylyte infynyte. The second is lyenge / for he is trought dyuyne. The third
is crudelyte / for he is sweet / benygne / and merciful. The fourth is envy /
cautelle / or treachery / for he is bonte without faynynge. The fyfth is
unfaithfulness against Justyce / for he is the Juge of Justyce infynyte. The
sixte is false wytnes the which is contrary / as well unto the trought as unto
charity / but above all these things before said he has in horror or in hate
him the which sows hatred debate dyscorde and dyuysyon between them the
which ben and ought for be friends / and therefore they the which ben peasyble
of good right ben Beati pacifici q^^ f^l^^ dei vocab^^. math.v. ^^tr^r^^ sensa.

called in the gospel the childern of god. And by the contrary may a man say
that they the which sown hates / wars / dyscordes / dyuysyons / and debates
that been the childern of the devil of hell. The.xi. manner of almesdede
spyrytuall is Nullu^ credi(...)us ad salute^ nisi deo i^^ta^te ve^ute. nullu^

for to pray unto god for his neighbors. And this alms prouffyteth unto
the body and unto the soul in all manner necessyte. For by this alms or aid
unto his neighbors has purchased sapyence / virtues / and merytes / and
fynably the royal me of paradyse / the which no man may have and get of
himself. By the which it behooves that by humylyte and by prayer a man them
require of god / the which so for to do us has warned. Where of says well
the holy doctor saint Austyn that no manner man may come unto salvation if
that god call him not / nor no manner of man may come if that god aid him not
/ nor also he will not aid him if that a man require it not. The which thing
is done by devout prayers / that is for to lift up his heart unto god by true
faith without any manner of thing or article for to doubt / that he is more
puyssaunt for to give much more gretter things than any manner of man can
think or demand. Also a man ought for to believe steadfastly that will make
his prayers auaylable the which is the fontayne and depnesse of mercy / of
pity / and of swetnesse infyfynyte / and he the which may not fail another
lie. And always says he in the gospel / that if two or three persons ben
united in good charity / he them shall give that that they of him require
prouffytable for the glory of god and for their salvation. If it than a thing
dygne much holy and much pleasant unto god / as for to pray one for an
other. For oftentimes god pardonned the one by the request and supplycacyon of
the other. In like wise as it appyred by the holy scripture / where god says
unto Moses. Suffer me and I shall destroy this people for the sin of
ydolatrye / as Dimitte me vt ita sca^ furor meus co^tra eos and deie^ etc. and
moses n^ din^^sit q^re deus no^ deleuit. exo.xxxii. ca. Precibus david an

if he would say / that if it were not for thy prayer the which holded me and
tarried. I should destroy the people ydolatres suddenly. Also by the prayers of
Danyel the people of god were delivered from the captyuyte of Babylon. Also by
the prayers of Danyd the angel the which by the commandment of god put the
people unto death and destrucco^n incontinent cessyd. Also by the prayer of holy
church / that is to know of those the which were baptized. Saint Peter was
myraculously vnchayned and delivered from prison. For it is written in the deeds
of the appostles that the church prayed for him without cessynge / and it was
fygured how that by the devout orysons of holy church poor sinners the
which them submytten unto the sacraments and prayers of them ben delivered
from prysons and bounds of the devil of hell the which holds them bounden
by the cords of their sins. Also by the prayyrs of holy Precibus sco^rum

persons the which than were present. Saint Poule received the sight the
which he had lost and was baptized. By the virtue of prayers these deuylles
ben vaynquysshed / fortunes / sykenesses / wars / and pestylences cessen. By
prayer these patryarkes / these prophets / martyrs / and other saints / have
chasyd these deuylles / helyd the syke / raised the deed / converted these
ydolatrers. To pray for his enemies is a thing of great perfeccyon / and he

prayed god the fader to pardonne them that made him to deye / and in this
followed him saint Stephen. And who so is well enlumyned he shall know clearly
that every good christian man ought for to pray for them unto him done Iniurye
as for them the which unto him given matter to enter with Jhesu christ in to
the realm of paradyse / in to the which none may enter without trybulacyon.

or to make offrynge unto god the fader the blessed Jhesu christ his sone with
the right holy sacrament of the awter / and this almesdede here surmounted
syngulerly in two things / all these other good deeds that may be said or
thought / that is in dygnyte and in generalyte. In dygnyte / for than is offered
the very sone of god / unto whom ben all the treasours of the dyuynyte / and
all goods / ben they of nature / of grace / or of glory. There is the bread /
and the wine / flesh / and blood / the right holy refeccyon of christian
souls. Also this almesdede is right general as well unto ye quycke as unto
them that been departed / for it is the price and the redempcyon for an hundred
worlds if there were so many the which would unto that submytte their faith
and their hope. This medycyne is not all oonly Qui sanat oe^s infirmitates

of souls / but with that of bodies and of all sykenesses. It is he the which
for ^o give example of of all perfeccyon has made and accomplysshed all works
of mercy as well corporal as spyrytual. For first he us has given his right
holy flesh vigynale for to eete / and his precious blood for to drink. Also
he so is dyspoyled on the tree of the Ite^ ipse propiciatoibus ini^tatibus ^^^s

cross for to clothe us with virtues and with glory He has wylled that his
side were opened for to lodge us. He us has vysyted from day to day our
sykenesses / as well spyrytuall as corporal. He us has delivered from the
hard prysons of the devil. He has wylled to be buried by the water of baptem
/ by the which we should deye / as unto the desires seculer and worldely / and
shall live with him arysen. By this oblygacyon he is broken / the deuylles
surmounted / the virtues purchased and given / the holy ghost sent / and the
yate of paradyse opened / and by the works of the infynyte mercy of the
blessed Jhesu christ. Unto whom be honor in the world of worlds. Amen. And
this is as unto the works of mercy.

Thus ends the third party.
Here follows the fourth party of this book in the which is found ye manner
hy^ well to confess / and it conteyneth.xxx. chapytres. The which well
studied and put in practyse / may be the mean for to make a true and a parfyte
confession. And by the consequent to have absolucyon and remyssyon and
specially salvation with the company of faithful christian men.


EVery person that wylled and desired to make good examinacyon of his
conscience for enterly and perfectly hy^ to confess he hy^ ought examyne by
the doctrine drawn in these three parties precedentes. That is to know of the
artycles of the faith. Of the commandments of the law. And of the works of
mercy. For in these three points is contained the deed of the conscience / by
the which a man shall be fynably Juged unto salvation or unto dampnacyon. And
therefore to the entente that simple people may have matter and doctrine of well
and surely to examyne the deed of their conscience / there shall be first put
some things general touching the sacrament of confession.

Here folowen.iiij. reasons for to show yt yt Justy fycacyon of one sinner /
is more greater thing tha^ the creacyon of the world.
AFter the sentence of glorious saint austen to reduce a sinner from the estate
of mortal sin / unto the estate of grace / is a more greater thing after
some consyderacyon / thanne was the creacyon of heaven and of earth / and that
may a man show by four reasons. The first is / for the soul yewhiche is by
his sin in ye estate of dampnacyon and perdycyon / is more noble and more
dygne syngulerly / For as much as he is create unto the image of the blyssed
trynyte / the which is not the son / the sky / and all the earth / by the
which it follows that to bring one such creature from the estate of
maledyccyon and of dampnacyon unto salvation / and unto the royalme of paradyse
is a more greater thing than is the creacyon of the things before said. The
second is such for as much as god demands not to be aided unto the
creacyon of the soul / nor of all the world but he might not nor would not us
reduce from dedely sin unto the estate of grace / without the aid and
consent of our free will. The third reason Qui fecit (...) ^ine te no^
saluabit te sine te. Augustinus
is / For in the creacyon of the world god found no lettynge nor resystence /
but unto the Justyfycacyon of the conscience / the sin repugnethe unto the
grace of god: The fourth reason is / for when god created all the world / he
said that heaven and earth be made / And at his saying and pleasure al was made
and formed for too reduce our souls from sin unto grace / he is
excessyuely humylyed / And by the space of two and thyrty years and three
months he has endured fastings / prayers pains / swetynges. and labors /
and has been bound / spytte on / stryken / and crucyfyed / And finally has
shed all his precious blood / And has wylled to dye on the cross / And all
that has he done for to deliver our souls from sin / And for to bring
them unto salvation.

Here follows a profitable exortacyon for to do wylfully penance.
A Man ought well to note that there is not Caplm.ii
so great a sinner in the world but that he may recover the grace of god / if
he will do that that is in him / for god is of so great pity and mercy that he
may not fail unto his creator the which does that / yt in him is / wherefore
it is to know that by the light of reason natural. And specially of that the
which is aided with faith and informed / That is to understand that the
sinner y^ which is contrary and dyspleasaunt unto all reason / Also he may
consider the Justyce dyuyne / the which may not sufferre but ye sin were
ponysshed / And of this consyderacyon / and comparyso^ of sin unto the
Justyce dyuyne the which is in fynyte / And by the consygnet to offend
infynytly by sin proceeds and comyth fere unto ye creator reasonable
culpable and subgecte unto sin / But how be it he ought not always to abide
in that consyderacyon / for that should be meter him too dyspayre / As were
Cayme / and Judas / But more over he ought to consider / the bonte / pity / and
mercy the which ben in god infynyte / by the which he abides the sinner /
and defferreth his death to the end that he may use if he will of the
consyderacyon beforesayd and that he may do penance / And of this
consyderacyon of mercy comyth an hope again god our fader the which is
fountain of mercy and of all consolacyon / And by the mean of these two
things / That is to know fere on that one party / and hope on the other /
comyth a purpose and desire to do penance the which purpose comyth
pry^cypally of god by a remorce of conscience that god gives unto the person
/ or by a little / and inclynacyon natural or by a predycacyon / or by the
counseyll of a good confessor or by other vocacyon semblable / And then they
the which dyspose them to receive and obey unto that inspyracyon receyuen true
contrycyon of their sins / And by the consyguent the grace of the holy gooste
/ But they the which it refusen in dyferrynge from day to day / from month
to month and from year to year making a defe eere / the which Manda rem^d^

by so often times / And also contynually stryketh at the yate of their
conscience / yield them unkind and indygne of the love of god and of his
royalme / by the which they abide in the temptacyon of the deuell Justely
reseruyd unto the fire of hell. For it is a thing certain that there was never
creator dampened but by his own defaute.

Here follows the.xii. fruytes the which comes of true penance.
A Man may show.xii. fruytes comes / and Caplm.iii. Ju^ge collyrio oculos

proceeds of true penance. The first is illumynacyon of the soul for three
things / first for the confession is not true if the sinner take no pain to
think on his sins / and to knowledge his defaute / and his blame / And
therefore says a man comenly / he that looks in a glass sees him self well
/ and he that sees himself well / knows himself well / And he that kneweth
himself well preyseth himself little / And he that preyseth himself little is
a wise man / Secondly for that / that the sinner him humbles before the priest
for the love of god / some time the king the pope / before a poor chapelayne
/ by the which god him gives the light of grace / Thyrdly for the instructyon
yt the good confessor gives unto the sinner / for many ymagen of venyall
sin that it be mortal / or some time of mortal that it be venyall / or that
it be no sin / The second fruit is ye mercy of god of the which says
saint Barnardyne that god has two courts / That is to know the court of
mercy / And that other of Justyce / That of mercy is much sweet and gracyous
in comparyson of yt of Justyce for four reasons / The first is for as much
as the Juge of this court is sweet and amyable ageyn the sinner the which is
culpable / The second for in this court a man byleueth without any thing
again saying unto culpable / The third / for always in this court is given
lyberte and delyuerau^ce. And there is never given sentence of death. The fourth
for that / that he y^ which had deserved the gybet of hell / is assured of the
royalme of paradyse. Also for as much that from the court of Justyce / a man
may apele unto the court of mercy during this present life / and not after an
example of dauyd of mary Maudelayn of saint peter / and many other sinners. And
also it cou^seyleth saint Austen / and many other holy scryptures. The third
fruit is that the sinner is arysen from death spyrytuall / unto the life of
grace / For after that a man has sinned mortally / man may never return unto
grace / but by the mean of confession / and how be it that he the which has
true contrycyon and dyspleasur / of his sins / he is by that in the estate of
grace before that he has made actuell confession. Nevertheless it behooves yt
he have purpose that to do in place and in time or else he may not have grace.
The fourth fruit is deliver from the puyssaunce / and from the bonds of the
devil of hell / the which holds ye sinner in his mouth the which is much
large in the enter but right strayte as unto ye coming out. The fyft Saluabit

fruit is purgacyon of right horrible and detestable mesellery spyrytuall / yt
is from dedely sin / the which purgacyon may be made in little time during
the great days of mercy / as well of sy^nes dedely as of venyall / but after
this mortal life much otherwise shall be y^ form and manner of pledy^g The.vi:
fruit is a lyghtynge of yt conscience for none other thing is so heavy as yt
the which has made these deuylles to fall / and other dampened in to the
depnesse of hell / that is dedely sin the which by other mean than by true
confession penance he may not be deposed / and this alleuacyon they find by
certain operacyons great and horrible sinners after yt that they ben lawfully
confessed. The.vii. fruit is / peace / and unity with god / for in dysobeynge
unto god / the sinner makes war again the majesty dyuyne / again whose
power to resyste it is a thing impossyble / by the which the sinner ought
soueraynly to seche the mean of peace / that is true penance. The.viii. fruit
is / y^ by true confession the devil and all his labor is put to confusyon /
and oftymes by ye cou^^ey^^ of good confessors some embusshement his cautelles
and decepcyons ben dyscouerde / The which thing him dyspleaseth / and the
let of his false intencyon right syngulerly. The.ix. fruit is that oftymes it
happens that he the which has not plain contrycyon / but has alonely
attrycyon / the which is a manner of contrycyon vnparfyte and un suffycyent for
to have the grace of god / But by the virtue of the absolucyon sacramental /
with that attrycyon the Qui humilite^ co^fitetur venia^ consequi^. her glo.ii.

sinner receives the grace of the holy ghost / if there be none other
lettynge. The.x. fruit is reuelacyon of great part of the pain due for ye
sins yt a man has committee as well for the virtue and puy s sau^ce of the
keys / and of the sacrament of holy church / as also of ye shame yt a man
has to tell his sy^ne. The.xi. fruit is augmentacyon of grace / for often it
may happen yt the great contrycyon / and dyspleasure that the sinner has he
him arayseth from sin in to the more greater grace and love of god than ever
he has been tofore / and more ware to resyst and more humble before god and
before man / in like wise as it is red of many saints that have sinned.
The.xii. fruit is that the sinner Item ^o^^e.vii. i^ persona confessoris dt. Da
gloria^ dn^o deo israel and co^fit^re atque in dica michi quoth feceris etc.
by his true confession gives glory and praysynge to god / for that that he
him knowlegeth and confesses a sinner before god / and by the consequent he
knowlegeth the Justyce dyuyne to be true / and in fallyble in the which he
gives glory and praysynge unto god unto whom alonely it is due in heaven and
in earth.

Here follows the dyfference of works done in sin or in the grace of god.
AFter true confession the good works the Caplm.iiii
which before were deed / and without merit / ben lively and merytoryous /
They the which ben done in the estate of grace / ben said to be lovely for as
much that they shall be rewarded eternally / if the person be fynably saved /
and if after such good works he fall in to dedely sin. For y^ which
afterward he does true penance / the merit of those good works the which
weren mortyfyed and effaced by reason of the said sin unto him is yelden and
restored by the virtue of true penance. But so is it not of good works done in
dedely fy^ne / as shall be fastings / almesdedys / prayers / or other
goodnesses / for notwithstanding that ye sinner shall do penance and shall be
fynably saved. he shall not be rewarded of merit essencyall / for those works
done in dedely sin. For they were never lively nor pleasant unto god / and
by the co^sequent they may not be araysed / by the which a man may certainly
say that it is more worth unto a person for to give a penny in the estate of
grace / or to fast one day for the love of god / than to give all the gold of
the world in the estate of dedely sy^ne / or to fast all the days of his life
/ with bread and with water. In the which apereth a merueylous dyfferrence
between the estate of dedely sin and the estate of grace. But that not with
stondynge where as the sinner has many of sins of asmoche he him ought to
enforce to do good works for by that he is often preseruyd for to fall into
other sins also it him dysposeth ableth to continue in good works and life
virtuous / Also if such unto him have been enjoined by penance / it him
acquyteth of that penance / after the most hole opinion / Also he occupyeth
the time fruytfully / and him makes some what taking part with these good
persons / Also it auoydeth pains temporal / the which oftymes comen by
cause of sins he deserves again the great lyberalyte of god prosperyte and
gods te^porall / also they letten ye devil yt he has not so great puyssau^ce
to noye ye sinner also they relesen ye pains of hell or purgatory / y^ is to
know yt a man shall not beso much punysshed as at such time yt a man should do
such good deeds / he has been ydell / they prouoken the mercy dyuyne / for to
give grace / by y^ which a man may go from his sy^ne / and if such persons
be fynably saved he shall have joy eternal of those goodnesses done in the
estate of dedely sin / not as such nor so great as if that he had them
done in the estate of grace. For good works that be done for ye love of god
stere put and knock at the yate of mercy dyuyne / after as it is said in the
gospel / And this matter declares right a long saint Bernardyn in the three
score and four sermon of the sum / the which is intytled de contractibus.

Here follows.vi. reasons showing that no sinner ne ought to tarry him to
confess.
THe first reason is / wherefore no man ought Caplm.v.
to tarry him to confess is for the condycyon of sin / for it is like unto
fire bre^nynge the which may not be quenched but by true co^fessyon in the
which he ought to have abundaunce of teerys at the leest spyrytuell the which
ben sorrow and dyspleasure to have offended god by sin / And in like wise as
he should be holden a fool the which sees his house brennynge / and he it may
remedy by the casting on of water / and he nothing will do / so is it of
them the which ben in dedely sin / and puts not their dylygence to purge
them by true confession. The second is for as much that sin is a right
perylous syknesse / and confession is a right certain medycyne and proufytable
/ by the which it apperyth that full few preyse the health of their soul /
the which sees him self syke and nere deed / and fyndeth not the remedies to
make himself hole / The third reason is for as much as the death is nere the
which in all places us purseweth and there is no person that may know ye
hour / after the comen law ne the hour ne the day / the manner or how he
ought to dye And right often it happens that the death takes the sinner /
whereof he takes no head. And certain if any knew the day of his death / he
should be more assured / than he that knows not the day nor the hour. And
ever more he the which knowyth yt he shall have no more but one year in this
present life / he should aredy him to dye well / and by true and entyre
confession / in making restytucyon in requyrynge pardon / in pardonnynge. In
the which it apperyth clearly the grace begylynge and decepcyon as well of the
world as of the devil the which brings a sleep the people in sin. The
fourth reason is for that / that the sinner is now in the mouth of the lion of
hell / the which in an horrible rayge desires him to devour / from ye which
peril he may be delyuerde by true confession. and not otherwise. The fyfte
reason is for y^ / that ye sinner by his sin has lost ye gods spyrytuall ye
gods of glory infynyte / and eternal / and with yt he loses his time / his
body / and his soul / and y^ that he does as to purchase merit essencyall /
and all these gods before said may he recover by true confession. But the
devil of hell dosyth his eeres hy^ promyttynge falsely and in great treason
yt he shall live long / and that he shall amend by true confessyo^ and this
hanging comes upon the death. And tha^ many of these do^me people would them
confess and have true repentance / the which comes pryncypally of ye grace
of god / of y^ which grace they ben indygne or unworthy / for when god the^
called and tarried they have refused to come / by ye which of good right he
them refuses in their necessyte / and them sends unto the galowes of hell
for their irreuerence and iniquyte / for of as much that he them has the more
longely abyden of as much ought they to be dampened the more grievously / and
Nisi co^uersi ^ue^^tis gladiu^ suu^ vbrauit arcu^ suu^ te te^dit et parauit
illu^. p^s.vii.
therefore says well holy scripture that god holds his bow bent / and
draws again the sinners ye which taryen them to confess. The.vi. reason is
as unto the regard of mercy / and sweet pity of our saueour Jhesu christ the
which not alonely abides at the yate of our conscience. But with that /
puttyth / knockyth / and callyth from day to day / yt is to know by
inspyracyons of good wylles / by predycacyons / by gifts / and benyfyces / and
sometime by syknesses / losses of gods / wars / and other flagellacyons. But
in like wise as the devil bly^ death the sinner / so he him makes to lose the
hery^ge of the vocacyon that our lord unto him makes. By ye which of good
right he unto him shall say at the death / I have called the and thou haste not
wylled to come / Now thou call me / and I the reco^mende unto the devil.
By these.vi. reasons apperyth clearly the peril the which is to defferre and
longely abide him to confess / for by yt many can not them confess as in
general / for yt / that they have forgoten there sins / ye which thing may
not be suffycyent excusacyo^ / when neclygence and conte^pte of their health is
cause of their ygnoraunce / and many doctors dowten right greatly that such
confession is not suffycyent unto saluasyon / and A questyon.
unto thatpurpose some maken a questyon / That is for to know if that any
sinner be bound him for too confess in contynente after that he has sinned
mortally / and that he has place and time and a chapelayne that has power
for to assoyle / The answer unto that no man is bound regulerly / And The
answer
by the commandment of holy church but one time in the year / that is at
time of ester / except in.v. cases / The first is when a man will receive the
holy sacrament of the awter / and that a man has presbiteru^ idonium for to
assoyle him For as says a doctor named Rycardus de media vylla / such a caas
may be come that some the which has comytted mortal sin / and has the
presence of any priest non idoniu^ may receive with out sin the holy
sacrament of the awter with co^trycyon without other confession in attendynge /
place and time / and confessoure more couenable / The second caas depends
enough of the first that is for as much as holy church commands that
every christian man the which has age competent ought to receive his creature
at the time of Ester / by the which it follows that he ought to be trewly
confessed and repentance / The third is when such person shall be in the
article of death / and may have place and oportunyte to make confession The
fourth shall be when any has such sin of the which he may not be assoyled
but of him of whom he should have the presence / of ye which presence is it
semblable that he nor she shall not it recouere but of the year / The fyfte
shall be when the conscience of any man him prycketh or warns / that he is
holden him to confess incontinent after that he has committed his sin
mortal / and that he has oportunyte that to do / for it is right good
counsel and sure so to do / as it it said before in the commandments of
holy church / also another questyon / that is to know if y^ curate A questyon.
be bound to here the confessyons of his parysshynges as oftymes as they him
require. The answer The answer
he is holden of necessyte to here their confession when they him require at
the time yt they be bounden them to confess / by necessyte as is one time of
the year / after the commandment of holy church / or in the article of death
/ but if it be more often or in other cases not necessary he shall not be
bou^de^ of necessyte / but alonely of congruyte / as he the which syngulerly
ought to desire their wealth and their prouffyte / But always when he is
required and he them will not or may not here / or unto them assygne not
another confessor / than they have license for to provide of a confessor for
that time / or for many times when the ^as it shall require / and that
confessor in like wise has power them to assoyle of the case as may the said
curate also when any is in hate and dyscencyon with his neighbor or will not
do dygne penance for his sins / he is bound to show it in secret wise /
or before witness after as the case it requires. And if by such admonycyon
he will not be corrected / he it ought to renounce unto his sovereign / as is
the bishop of the dyoses / or unto his offycyall / also he ought to pray for
him / and him ought to reco^maunde unto the prayers of his other parysshynges /
and him to name after good descressyon / and that it may be unto his prouffyte
/ and unto ye edifycacyon of his neighbors / and when he has done
suffycyently these shynges before said. Than he may be excused before god / of
the charge and of the gouernyng that he has of the said parysshynges / and not
other wise / In like wise as it appears by the right and other holy scryptures.

Here follows the practyse that the confessoure ought to hold as well again
himself as again them that he confesses.
HOr as much as the practyse and experyence without great conning is somty me
more prouff ytable than is the science without experyence. Here follows a
right prouffytable insygneme^t of the practyse that the confessor ought to
hold / as well for the salvation of his soul / as of them that he confesses.
First he ought to knowledge and feel in himself / that the excusacyon of the
office of the confessor may not be duly done nor accomplysshed / as unto
theffecte of the sacrament y^ which is to bring again the sinner from the
estate of sin to ye grace of god / and from death spyrytuall to life
spyrytuall / but alonely by the virtue and aid of ye creator where as it is so
as for to iustefy these sy^ners it is not less than ye creacyon of ye world /
as it appears before / By the which the confessoure ought well to examyne his
conscience in requyrynge the aid of the holy ghost / For if he were bound
from dedely sin he might not unto his saluacy on unbind the sinner / yt he
confesses nor have ye aid / and knowledge the which unto yt is necessary and
in token of this thing when our lord gave unto his appostles the execusyon to
confess / he unto the^ said. Take and receive the holy ghost / they yt you
assoyle shall be assoyled / And those that ye will not assoyle shall not be
assoyled. and therefore sayen these doctors of theology / ye they the which
admynystren solemly the holy sacraments / as is ye baptem confession or other
in the estate of dedely sin sy^nen dedely. Also be ye confessor warned yt in
such mynystracyon he seche pryncypally ye honor and glory of god / and the
prouffyte and salvation of souls / not ye preyse favor / or again temporal
/ or some other thing sinistre not purposynge ye rich unto the poor / the
wise worldly man unto these simple creatures / the fair unto the foul / the
noble unto them not noble / but by good and just cause for asmoche yt of one
may come more great good unto holy church / or unto the salvation of souls
than of the other / for if he have poorness of intencyon / him it shall
enayde. But otherwise he shall be like un to the candell y^ brenneth in she
wynge the way unto other / Also be he aduysed yt the admynystracyon of ye
sacrament is meruayllous among other and great dyffyculte / By the which he
therein ought to proceed demeurely dyscretly / and without preceptacy on in
chastysynge / be it to here the sins / to such or to knytte satysfactyon and
penance / for much better it is to examyne one or tweyne unto salvation /
than twenty and four noughtely. Also it is right expedyent specially at this
day that when these confessors have the cases the which with good cause were
other times reserved unto the prelates for the correccyon of sinners. for with
great pain may a man make any fruit in confession for the dyuersyte and
habundaunce of great and horrible sins and of cases the which of them comes
as well in old / as in young / as well for the sentences of excomyny^g of
restytucyons / of blasfemynges of ydolatryes and of other cases new and in
estymables the which never has been herd / or found by scripture / and the
which ben at this day found and taken from sinners by the synguler grace of
god / and the merit and good dylygence of confessors / and there ben found
many sy^ners that never would consent to be sent unto the prelates though that
they should be ever without confession so as many sayen and affermen. By the
which it is not to be understand / that / that the which other times has been
ordained for ye charity / and salvation of souls / as ben the sacraments and
ordenau^ces of holy church / ought to be kept unto the preiudyce of the
salvation of sinners the which things shall come when the prelates the which
have to answer of deed spyrytuall of their subgectes they will not committee
their case and puyssaunce in such necessyte unto chapelayns / wise and
dyscrete how be it that at this day with great pain there ben found
chapelayns suffycyent in all things unto such office by the which defaute
many of the poor sinners go unto dampnacyon / Also ought the confessor
subtylly advise the qualyte the offense and other dysposycyons of the sinner /
And then he ought to inquire of the sins of the which he may be culpable /
and if he perceive that the person be young or other / else he is shamfas^e
or to much ferefull / he ought to show it swetely and affyably and there he
ought to persuade from confession / And how he should chese more sooner to dye
than ever to say or any thing declare of the sin the which unto him has been confessed. For it unto him has been told in as much as he is the up care
of god pryncypally / and not as unto a man / Also he ought to declare of as
much that he him confesses the more plainly / and the more longfully / of as
much he shall love him the better. Also that by such confession he is put out
of the bonds of the devil / and auoydeth the pains of hell and retorneth
unto Jhesu christ for to live eternally. oftymes it happens that by such
Admonycy on man gives courage unto the poor sinners y^ the devil of hell
holds in fere to confess them poorly and entyerly. And the confessor ought
to labor specially again young people / or other simple persons and rude to
tell their sins. First in general / and afterward moeuynge the aid of ye
holy ghost he ought to dyscende unto the partyculers after that he shall have
the cause and occacyon by that the which is said in general. And the^ he may
demand if they will well that he them examyne to the end that their
confession may be hole / and unto their salvation in she wynge them that if by
ypocrysye or evil thinking they say not troth in their confession they lie
unto god y^ which all can and knows / and that such confession should be
more dampnable than merytoryous. and when that a man fyndeth any such simple
people the which promytten to say and to answer truly and requyren and
wyllyng that a man them examen / after that they have said that / that they can
/ a man may not make a more brefe and sure expedycyon than by the
commandments of god as shall be said here after. And a man ought to
aduertyse the sinner that he answer not to have done that thing that he has
not done. As done many the which answer yes sire unto that / yt a man them
demands / be it troth or lesynge / And for to know better to proceed in
such interrogacyons the confessor ought to demand the estate of the person
if he know it not. That is to know if he be in the estate of marriage / or in
the estate of the church / reguler / or seculer / clerk / or lay / noble /
or not noble / prelate / or subject / and of other vocacyons. And than he may
form his interrogacyons / after the sins the which most comenly abounden
in such people / as unto the people of the chirch of symony / of irregularyte
/ of sacrylege / of y^ evil dyspendynge of the patrymonye of Jhesu christ /
these ben the goods of the church. Also of noble people / and officers of
rauayn / unto people marchau^des / offrandes / and of lyenges / unto borges /
usury unto young people / of temptacyons carnalles / and of touching
dyshoneste and of the cyrcumstaunces the which greuen much* and of the manners
and diverse espyces / the which may be in one self sin and of the number.
That is to know by hew oftymes aman is fallen in to the same sin For the
sinner it ought to tell and confess if unto him it be possible / or as nere as
unto him it may be very semblable. And so of other things / after the
dyscrecyon / and medyfycacyon before said. by the which it appears that the
confessor ought to have three things / science cautelle / and dyscrecyon /
science for to dyscerne the dyuersytees of the manner of sins / cautelle for
to inquire / and to axe / questyons / dyscrecyon for to give and enjoin
penance / or else he him dysposeth unto great peril as well of his salvation
as of them that he confesses. Also he ought to warn hy^ that he confesses
that he name not / or acuse another person thanne himself if the sin were
not of such condycyon that otherwise it may not be said / or declared / and he
ought not to dyscende to much in partyculer in the cyrcumstaunces of sins /
and specially of the sin of lechery / For of that may come the letty^ge of
conscience / as well in himself / as in other or to much great shame unto him
the which is confessed / how be it a man may him warn to declare his sin so
parfytly that his conscience grutche him not afterward in that / that he has
not entyerly confessed him / and with the cyrcumstau^ces y^ which weren of
necessyte / and when it comes unto the end of the confession that the sinner
has parfytly told and declared his sins / by interrogacyons or other wise /
than the confessor ought him to show the error / and the greuousnesse of
his sins. And also the grace that god unto him has done in that / that he
has abyden him to do penance / and him to love finally in good purpose if
unto him it be possible / And in good hope of the mercy of god / and for some
case or ceason he may not him assoyle / as for the case of excomyny^ge / or
that he will not pardonne / or seche pardonne or make restytucyon / or other
cases he him ought to counseyll the form / and the manner to find his remedy
/ and him to reco^maunde unto the sacred vyrgyn mary fou^tayne of pity / of
mercy / and of doing any good dedys. For in so doing god him shall the more
sooner help to find his remedies. Also if y^ confessor knows by any signs
or lokynges conjectures or by other way that the sinner says not
suffysauntly his sins / he him ought than to warn / not alonely one time but
many that if he leave any thing unto his wyttynge his confession is no
confession and synneth grievously. And him ought to warn to go to another
confessor / or to return to him another time that he may have other
dyspocysyon. Also be the confessor wise and dyscrete / that he enjoin not
penance unto the sinner y^ he will not receive wylfully and the which is very
semblable that he shall accomplysshe showing him that if by forgytful / nesse
or otherwise / he it will not accomplysshe / after that / that he it excepteth
and that he it may well do he synneth grievously / and is bounden in such case
to confess him / Also never for sin secret he ought not to give open
penance. And those the which ben confessed ought to keep them well that by
mockery / malice or other cursyd cause and then they show not the secret of
confession for in so doing they sin grievously / and if any person hy^ feel
strongly roted in any sin / he may be bound after good dyscrecyon unto
souls pain temporal / in case that he return unto his sin / as is to
swear without cause / of lechery / or of other sin / for Dfie (...) pauci ^^t

sometime many keep them well to return unto sin / for fere of the loss
of.x. shelynges / ye a penny or a half penny the which he keeps not for the
love of god / how be it / it is a thing pleasant unto god when the person
secheth the ways and manners to correct him and to punysshe his sins for to
please god his creator / but many ben blyndyd in the knowledge of the love of
god of the greuousnesse of sin and of the peril of evil custom / of the
pain of hell / and of the glory of paradyse Item gre. Justu^ est vt ^ voluit

than they do to remedy the thing on the which hangs their dampnacyon. By
the which it happens oftymes that such can not find remedy when they it
desire and would / for when they it may well find they will not. By these
things before said it appears clearly that the art and science of well and
Justly to examyne their conscience unto salvation as well of the confessor /
as of him the which is confessed is of so high subtylyte / and so strayt that
it is not to believe / as by science humayne alonely or by study / or clergy. a
man may well and iustley acquyte without synguler aid of the blessed holy
ghost the which aydeth and techeth them the which by the ordinance of the
holy church ben in fere and in humylyte / and for the charity of poor souls
receyuen the office of a confessor / and by ye contrary they the which by

our lord that if one blind man ledeth an other both tweyne fallen in the

Here follows what science is necessary unto a confessor. Caplm.vii.

and cyrcumspeccyon that he ought to have the which excercyseth the office of
a confessoure / where as it is so ye the confessor is judge of the conscience
of ye sinner before that he may give good sentence it behooves that he have
knowledge and dyscrecyon in aduysynge if the sin be mortal or venyall. And
therefore some what to understand the dyfference of sin / it is well to be
noted that holy church has two manner of commandments. The first manner unto
us is ordained duly as well again god as again his neighbor / And they ben
named the.x. commandments of the law / of the which has been treatyd
before of the which it is to know that every person the which has wit age
/ and dyscressyon / and that by delyberacyon and fully consenting or
equyualent trespasseth any of the.x. commandments synneth mortally / For he
breketh charity the which is the life spyrytuall of the soul / and the mean
to love god and our neighbor / And he may not be excused by ygnoraunce / for
if he doubt in any case partyculer touching the commandments of god / he
ought to be informed by the^ the which have the fere of god and knowledge of
the law / and not to put him in ye peril of transgressyon / and to sin
mortally. for other wise sayen these doctors of holy scripture that such a
person dyspyseth god and his salvation. The which thing may not be in
creature reasonable without gylt of dedely sin. The second manner of the
commandments ben ordynaunces and statutes humayne. As of prelates of holy
church or other lords the which may have auctoryte to make laws and
ordynaunces yt these subjects ought to keep and accomplysshe after ye true
intencyon of their souerayns. But the transgressyon of such ordynau^ces shall
not be always dedely sin / if it were not for the dyspysynge of them the
which have made the said ordynaunces or commandment / or for to much great
and notable exces in thing the which of himself is but venyall sin if it
were not the said exces or conte^nement. And therefore right syngulerly it is to
be noted that never man ne ought to Juge that any sin be mortal if it be not
co^myttyd by delyberacyon and full consent / as says his equyualent. And I say
equyualent for as much that many synnen by habytacyon of custom or of a
contempt in the which they ben blyndyd by such manner that it seems not unto
them that they dyspose them or that they give their consent in many things
which ben vnprouffytable / The which always after some doctors ben sy^nes
dedely. as ye custom to swear for no thing and without cause reasonable / or to
do vndyscretly again the commandments of the souerayns / And this is for a
rule general / as well for these things before said / as for these that
folowen / also the confessor ought to dyscerne and advise if the sinner be
fallen in to sentence excome^ged or interdyted for in that may ry^ne as well
clerks as lay people / or if he be suspended or irreguler the which is
alonely as unto clerks / For if he Discretus quere^dus e^ sacerdos sciens

be excomenged the confessor may not him assoyle sacramentally till unto that
/ that he be losed and assoyled of the said sentence* And therefore the
confessor ought to take heed if he have auctoryte or not / or if the
absolucyon appertayn unto the pope or unto the bishop / or unto a another Juge
ecclesy astycall / to the intent to counseyll the sinner / as he ought to find
his remedy / Also he ought to dyscerne between the diverse espyces / and manners
of sin mortal. For it suffyseth not him to confess in general / but him
behooves to tell the cyrcu^stau^ces of them the which may gretely grieve or
change the sin in to diverse espyces. And therefore says well master
wyllyam durande. That if the confessor is so little knowing that he
fuffyseth not to dyscerne the sins and the cyrcumstau^ces of them as it is
said / the sinner ought to confess him to another / if he be not in such wise
lettred or by other mean so dyscrete that he may supply the in suffysau^ce of
his confessor. Also more over it is said that the confessor ought to conne
dyscerne and know if these bataylles of princes ben Just / or unjust / And
also of taxes imposycyons subsydes / or other exaccyons / if it be raven or not

Also of sellynges of byenges / or other contractes if they ben Just or
unjust. For otherwise he may not Justely enjoy ne restytucyon the which is of
the necessyte of the true absolucyon. Also he ought to have knowledge of wo^es
of testame^tes / of cases of symony / vseryes / and of other dyffycultes the
which oftymes come in the deed of confession. And if he be not suffycyent to
know dyscerne and Juge of things before said / and inform or replenysshe the
sinner unto more knowing for to show his remedies. For else it is unto ye
great peril of da^pnacyon / as well of himself / as of them that he confesses
/ as also of them the which him gave the of fyce / or the which may / or
should prove if he excercyse confessyons. Therefore says the holy euangelyst
that if one blind man led another both two fallen in to the dyche. And it is
to understand yt how be it that by the consecracyon of presthode every priest
receives the keys of the Jurysdyccyon / and of the puyssau^ce to assoyle /
how be it he may not them excercyse if he have not matter subgecte that is the
people of holy church. And therefore* it behooves that he have auctoryte of
comen right as is our holy fader ye pope / these bysshoppes / or their
diocesains / these curates / in their parysshynges / or that he has the said
auctoryte by preuylege / or license of one of these three before said / or that
the sy^ner has license or preuylege to these a confessor wise and dyscrete /
or else if the absolucyon be made without iurysdyccyon / that should not be a
true absolucyon / but they synnen mortally / as well the pressed as he the which
is confessed when they it d^ holely. Also it is good to be noted yt after a
doctor named Austen of anchone ra^ihabytacion / or presumpcyon / of the will
of him unto which it aperteyneth to give Jurysdyccyon to confess / has not
power nor place in such case / for it should follow that the absolucyon of the
sins should dyspence of a thing the which may be / or not be / the which
in certaynte may not be a true absolucyon. In like wise as it appears by the
reasons of ye said doctor / here put and noted in wytnes of this laid book.

Here folowen cases of the which the absolucyon Caplm. viii. Aug. de anchona

is reserved unto the pope the which they ought to know and to note the
which heren the confessyons.
AFter the resolucyon of doctors every person the which stryketh malycyously
/ any clerk / relygyous man / or relegyous woman in such manner that the
stroke or the betynge after the right may be said cruel / and wrongful is
excomunycate of sentence papal. Also who so bre^neth any holy place or of
relegyon falls and renneth in sentence papal after that the bishop
dyocesayn him denou^ceth excomunycate / but before the said denou^cyacyon the
bishop him may assoyle / who so brenneth places or houses / prophanes is not
excomunycate till unto the time that the bishop him makes to be denou^ced for
such causes and afterward he may not be assoyled / but by the auctoryte of
the pope. Also if it be to falsefye the letters of the pope in them putting
or taking out / one letter / one point / or one mynyme / or so use such
letters malycyously is excomunycate of the sentence papal. Also all those the
which ben parteners unto a crime by the which any person has run in
sentence papal in geuynge aid / comfort or favor unto the said crime they
run in semblable sentence / and also ben those that them receyuen wyttyngly
unto the sacraments of the church or unto sepulture ecclesyastycall. Also all
they the which maken couenaur^es or promesses with money for to have Justyce /
or any graces / be it for himself or for other be it in causes or in Jugementes
/ or for to obtain letters of the holy syege apostolycall / or who so uses /
or Joyeth wyttyngly of letters / or of graces so granted is acursyd of
sentence papal by the extrauagant of Bonyface the.viii. Also who so receives
the benefyces of holy church / or holy orders by symonye / is cursyd / and is
the case of the pope by ye extrauagant of ye pope Martin / Also who so goth
unto ye holy sepul^re by devotion or other without license of the pope is
acursyd and is the case of the pope. Also those the which cut bake or melte
the body of any deed person without license of ye pope ben acursyd of sentence
papal by ye extrauagant of Bonyface. Also they the which enforce any pressed to
sing in place interdyted / or the which calls them that been interdyted or
acursyd to here ye mass / or to receive the sacrament / or the which
prohibyton / and defenden that they the which ben excomunycate or interdyted /
goo not out of the church after the commandment that unto them is made ben
excomynynge. And also those the which ben warned and go not out and is the
case of the pope. Also all relegyous men the which admynystren unto seculers
the sacraments of the awter of marriage / or of the last vnccyon without the
license of him unto whom it aperteyneth / ben excomynynge / and is the case of
the pope / Also the in quesytor of the faith the which by hate / or by love or
by favor or otherwise lets to proceed after god and good conscience again
any heretyke / or the which puts cursydly the crime of heresy unto any man
/ or else who some ever that lets malycyously the office of the said
inquysycyon ben all excomunycate and is the case of the pope. Also if any
relegyous professed in the order of beggars without dyspensacyon him puts in
to another relygyon except of the chartre / is acursyd of ye pope by the
constytucyon of constaunce. And also the sethe which wyttyngly him receyuen.
also every clerk y^ which with his good will unto his knowledge co^moneth in
any of the sacraments of holy church with them the which ben acursyd of the
sentence of the pope. Also who so ever takes part unto a crime by y^ which
any person is excomunycate by any of the manners before said / or in the
sacraments of holy church rennen in semblable sentence. Also who so ever him
makes to be assoyled in the article of death of any sentence of cursynge / or
of other pain canonycall / be it of the pope or of the bishop or of other
Juge ecclesyastycall / and escapes from the said peril and article he is boun
de him to represent unto him y^ which him may assoyle / as some that after the
said article / or peril he shall have oportunyte unto y^ / that he does in
the case of the said sentence after the Jugement and dyscrecyon of the
absoluant / or other wise / he again falls in to the same manner of sentence
/ whereof he has been assoyled in the said article of death But another thing it
should be of the absolucyon sacramental of sins of y^ which he has been
assoyled in the said article / For he shall not be bound of necessyte him to
reconfesse notwithstanding that the absolutyon apparteyne unto the pope / or
unto the bishop. Also these herytykes / and they the which unto them given
aid / socours / or comfort / ben acursyd / and is the case of the pope. Also

to chese / ben excomunycate and may not be assoyled / but of auctoryte of our
holy fader the pope / except in the article of death / mo / and many other
sentences papalles ben in right and in customs / of the which here I pass as
at this time for by cause of shortness / and also for the pyteous hope that I
have that our mother holy church therein shall find remedy / and that in short
time / For he that well shall practyse an hundredth thyrty and four cases of
excomunycacyon the which ben in right / after as reherseth rectoriu^ Juris /

he know clearly that / the which the apostle says upon the apocalypse. That
is to know that in ye time of Antecryste well nere all the world shall be
acursyd / and that / that the which other times has been ordained for remedy
and for the correccyon of sinners. That is at this days converted in the
occasyon of ye dampnacyon of humayne By these things before said appears how
those the which herynge confessyons ought to have great dyscrecyon and for the
which cases they ought to consider with these iurystes / and with these
theologyens.

Here follows the cases reseruyd unto the bishop.
OF the cases reserved unto the bishop / as well of right as of au^cyent
custom there ben.ix. That is to know four of right / and.v. of ancient
custom. The first is the sin by the which any derke should be irryguler /
the which may come in four manners / first when any man receives unto his
knowledge holy orders by symonye / and in such case the pope and none other may
dyspence. Secondely when any clerk receives holy orders s^elyngly as he the
which is not of the dyoses nor has not love of his dyocesayn / such is
irryguler and if the bishop has defended upon pain of cursy^ge y^ none other
dyoses receive orders of him than such irryguler may be dyspenced / but of ye
auctory ^e of the pope / but if the bishop has not him defended he there may
than dyspence. Thyrdly when any clerk excercyseth the office yt he has not
yet received. Fourthly when any priest acursyd of the great curfynge suspended
or enterdyted / syngeth mass in such estate. The second case reserved to
these byssoppes is of them the which brennen malycyously any church / or
there make the brekynge of any doors / or the wyndowes of the vestry / of the
wall / or of couerture / the which the bishop may assoyle if that before he
them has not denou^ced / or made to denou^ce cursynge / for if it were so they
may not be assoyled but of the auctoryte of ye pope The third case of sin is
/ wherefore the penance ought to be joined alonely for sin great / and
horrible they shall be dynulged as man slawghter and after the custom of some
dyoses the sin of ye friends by dyffaulte whereof their chyldern dyen
perysshynge / or ben strangled in the bed or otherwise The fourth case
reserved unto the bysshoppes after the right is the sin by the which a man
renneth in the sentence of cursynge / as to smite a clerk malycyously not
wrongfully / for than the absolucyon should aperteyne unto the pope / other
cases there ben many of the which the confessor ought to be well aduysed and
hy^ inform desyrously as well by study as by cou^seyl and practyse of these
lawers. The first of the.v. cases of ancient customs is homicide volu^tary /
the.ii. of those y^ which falsen ye letters of ye pope / or wyttyngly vsen of
such letters false / the third of them y^ which breken y^ lybertes of holy
church / as those the which enforce the people of ye church to pay taxes
watches subsydes / or passages again their will and without leave and
ordinance of prelates. The fourth of them the which breken y^ innunyte and
preuylege of ye church in place hallowed as done they the* which taken
wylfully any person in the church / or chirchyerde / in taking him out of
the frau^chyse without the ordinance of Justyce or the which there maken any
fraccyon as it is said before. The fyfth is of sorcyers and denyns / a doctor
named John^ Andrew says that many other cases ben reserved unto bysshoppes /
as is to blasfeme god and his saints / of them also y^ which maken maryages
clandes^yns y^ is to say again the prohibycyon of holy church and without
sole^pnyte that unto that appertains. Also of all great and horrible cases
after that they ben publysshed Also of falls witnesses in Jugementes / of sin
dy^ceste / as to have company carnal / of his mother / or of his kynred / or
affynyte / and it is a semblable thing of the woman as of ye man Also of the
sin of lechery with a nonne or with a woman that has auowed any relygyon
approved or with bestes / Also of them that breken their maryages / and in like
wise other cases yt the bysshoppes may retain for good cause but as says
hostyence to reserve many cases it is unto ye preiudyce of curates / and there
may come more great lettynge of salvation of souls and great prouffyte / and
therefore he concludes that these curates may assoyle of all cases except
these.ix. before said / and that it unto them be not defended in right by some
specyal inhybycyon or custom approved / but as to regard of these freers
minours or prechours the which ben lawfully presented / no man ought to
doubt but that they may assoyle of all cases except these.ix. before said /
the which ben reserved of right or of custom for gloses / or opinyons
dyuerses of doctors / they ought not to be received / ne to have place in this
matter / again the will and express declaracyon / of the holy syege
appostolycall. For it is clear and ryghtfull that ye lest and the most was /
may not restrain ordyuynys she the preuylege / statute / and ordinance of his
sovereign. Now is it so that the pope Benedic. the xi. and Eugeny the fourth
they have confermed the opinion of Raymunde / the which puts four cases of
right / and five of custom as it is said / and that that he has written in
the.vii. of the decretalles. That is to understand that these relygyous may
not assoyle of cases reserved unto these bysshoppes / that ought to be
understand of them that been reserved of right. In like wise as it appears by
the decretal the which begins. Dudum. but if these concilles sinodaux / or
by the statutes / or ordynaunces prouyncyalles / some sin was defended upon
the pain of cursynge / these freers before said may not them assoyle. For the
absolucyon of cursynge apperteyneth of right unto these bysshoppes / except
these the which ben reserved unto the holy fader. Also it is well to be noted
that the priest the which receives wyttyngly the person acursed of the great
cursynge to here the office of ye church or any of the sacraments / or
sepulture ecclesyastycall sin mortally / and is suspended of all
admynystracyon ecclesyastycall / and he is enterdyted of the enter of the
church / and if he sing in such estate he is irryguler / and if he so dye he
ought not to be buried in holy place. Also if any take part with these
excomunycate / in speaking / or in etyng or in drinking / or in gretynge them
/ in dyspysy^ge the prohybycyon of holy church / he synneth mortally / and is
acursyd of the less cursynge / of the which sentence he may well be assoyled
of his curate / if of such case he has contrycyon suffycyent / and these
doctors sayen that such absolucyon / of the less excomunytate ought to
proceed the absolucyo^ sacramental of other sins under such form / Ego te
absoluo a sentencia minoris excomunicacionis sieve minorum excomunicacionum / et
hocsi sit plures Item eadem auctoritate / Ego absoluo te a peccatis tuis / In
no^e patris et fil^^ et spiritus santi amen) And the reason to hold this form
/ is for as much that they the which ben in some sentence / be not parteners
of the sacraments of holy church / from whom the sacrament is enhybyt till
unto that / that they ben loused of the said sentence / In like wise as it
appears by the right. Also it is to be noted yt some may well be assoyled of
pains canonycalles / as ben excomunye / suspencyon / interdyte / or
irrygularyte / without that / he were assoyled sacramentally / of his sins /
and of the one of the said pains abiding bound / of other if he were bound
of many / but so is it not of the absolucyon sacramental / In the which he
behooves to be assoyled of all his sins / or of one / The causes and reasons
wherefore a man may not comen with these that been acursyd without ^ennynge in ye
sentence be contained in this verse. Vtile / lex / humile / res ignorata
necesse. Hec anathema quidem fa^^ unt ne possit obesse) That is to say for the
great vtilite / be it of him that is a cursyd / or of him yt speaks with him /
or for the bond of marriage / or wha^ any is subject unto the cursynge / or
when a man has not knowledge of him that is acursyd / or wha^ there is
necessyte couenable / to speak or to comyne with these cursyd it is not
defended upon pain of sin ne of other sentence.

Here follows the dystyncyon of three manner of penance.
Three manner of penance ben as well in right Caplm.x.
as in custom. That is to understand open penance / solemn penance / and
penance secret / or sacramental / penance open penance is that y^ which
is done openly for sins great / and unlawful the which has been committee
openly / but such penance ought not at this day to be enjoined if it be not
done alonely in the town or cite / in the which than he shall recede the
court of Rome / or the holy concylle / after as says master wyllyam Durande
the scot / for as much that of such penance may sooner come sclander than
prouffyte / and edyfycacyon of souls / and therefore a man should punysshe them
y^ which for to beg and trewande go through the world all naked betynge him
self before the people / affermynge yt unto the^ it has been enjoined by
penance in y^ which they lain falsely and cursydly / penance sole^pne / is
yt a man begy^neth the assewenesdaye / with great mysterys the which ought not
to be given but for great sins open and wrongful and it apperteyneth alonely
unto the bishop for to give it or unto him the which him represents. The
form and manner to enjoin and Di. ^. Si depost remissione^ ^ff proenul aliqua
vno the co^gr^^t que also te^pore s^t necessa^. ^.
also to do such penance is written in the right / But oftymes the custom
hurts the ryghtes: and therefore in some dyocyses men use not such penance /
And in these other men use them in many and diverse manners. They y^ which given
open penance or solemn for sin the which is known / yt is to understand
the which is not comen unto the knowledge of all them of the town / or of the
more part aren / and fayllen greatly as other times it has been said of these
poor nouryces the which fynden their child deed by them or in the cradyll with
out that that they may know the cause or y^ lest of such adventure the which
oftymes may happen / without the gylte of the fader or of the mother / penance
sacramental is done secretly and of all manner of sins ben they open / or
secret / and it may be with drawn by as many times as the sinner a bydynge
in this present life falls again in sy^ne And it is the pryncypall intencyon
of this fourth Nisi penit ^nciam egetit^s ^e^s simul peribis. luce. (...).
Penite^^^am agite ap propiquab ^ reg n^^ celo^^. Mat. ^ ^.
party of this presentbook. And of this penance says saint Austen. that it
is more worth to a person the which is in sin to make a good and an entyer
confession / than to go in pilgrimage unto all the holy places that been upon
earth. For without that no creature may recover salvation nor also with that to
goo unto dampnacyon. And therefore take heed desyrously every poor sinner / the
which is in the domynacyon of the devil in the matter / and in these chapytres
the which folowen.

Here follows four things that the sinner ought to do for to begin well his
confession.
THe person the which desires so excellent Caplm xi.
a work as is to puryfye him from fynne. and to be reduced unto god by true
and entyer confession / ought to do four things / In like wise as techeth
master Peter de aquila / and also done these other theologyens comenly. The
first is effectuously to think on his life / after as says holy scripture. I
shall me remember / and I shall think on my life before the face of my god /
in bytternes and dyspleasure that I have him offended / and every person ought
to put also great dylygence and Recogitabo tibi o^s annos meos in amaritudine
aie me ysaie. xxxviii
pain to remember him of all his sins / for to have dyspleasure as he should
be for to thy^ke a great gain temporal / or as he should be to keep him from
loss / for if by sloweth and negligence to think of his sins / he leueth
one / or many with out confessing / and if he dye in such estate there is
extreme peril of dampnacyon / A another thing it shall be when he has done
his delygence after ye debylyte / of stragylyte humayn to remember him of all
his sins / and* that notwithstondynge such dylygence / he forgets one or
many / for it is a conclucyon certain that every person the which does that
/ that in him is to remember him of his sins for to have dyspleasure / god
him shall give knowledge / or the^ him shall pardon as unto the peril of
dampnacyon eternal / In the which it appears that no person is dampened but
by his own defaute. The second thing that y^ sinner Tanta e^ offensa quamtus
e^ ille ^ offen ditur. arist. v. ethi
ought to do before his confession is to have dyspleasure of every sin yt he
has committed ageyn god his creator / and he ought to be certain that the
offense of every dedely sin / is as great / as is the majesty and bou^te of
him the which is pryncypally offended / that is god the which is good in
fynyte. The third thing is that the sinner ought to have purpose moeuynge the
aid of god never to committee dedely sin / for in like wise as he the which
has true contrycyon of his sins pryncypally for the love of god and in
purpose to confess him in place and in time dew / and competent / is in the
estate of grace / In like wise by the contrary / if any creature had done all
the good dedys of the world / and never during his life has committed dedely
sin / other than to have alonely intencyon to sy^ne in time to come / he
shall be forth with by that cursyd will in the estate of dedely sin and in
the way of dampnacyon. The fourth thing is that the sinner ought to make
prayer to god his creator / that he him give to have knowledge of his sins /
and grace for to make confession the which unto him may be pleasant / and
unto the health of his soul / prouffytable.

Here follows of them the which may lawfully assoyle as also of them the
which may chose a confessor.
THe sinner the which desires to do so excellent Caplm xii.
a work as is to puryfye him from all sin by true confession and him reduce
unto god his creator / after these four things before said done and
accomplysshed / he ought to seche and chese a confessoure the which is
suffycyent for to declare him the dyffycultes of his cases / as many be of
bequestes of vows / of testamentes / of restytucyons / of sentence of
excomunycacyon of irrygularytes / of suspensyons / or of interdytynges / and so
of other again the cases the which oftymes is found in the deed of ^nscyence
/ For as saint Austen says / the sinner should at the least do for the life
and health of his soul that / that he does right dylygently for the health of
his body / now is it so that they the which ben syke corporally / and
pry^cypally they that a man certefyeth to be in danger of death sechen the best
medycyne and the most expert that they may find for to recover their health
and for to escape the death / by the which it appears y^ the syke and hurt
spyrytually of times of more than of a thousand mortal sins / should be
desirous to find a good medycyne spyrytuall / for to eschew the death of hell
the which is eternal / such medycyne spyrytuall is a gostely fader or a
confessor the which has cunning suffycyent him to examen of diverse cases as
it is said. Also that he has Jurysdyccyon / and puyssaunce to assoyle the
sinner / for else if he have not Jurysdyccyon and puyssaunce he synneth right
grievously in y^ assoylynge / And also doethe he the which has with him such
a folysshe chapelayn him confessing / wyttyngly / and there he has not the
true absolucyon. Also it is to be noted that vacabons the which have no
resydence / merchants the which ben out of their contree / pilgrims or they
the which passen the contree for to seche dwelling may be assoyled of the
curate of the parysshe in whom they have devotion to confess them / for in
such cases they ben of that parysshe where they abide / as for to receive the
sacrament of confession / and absolucyon of all these cases / of the which
these curates may assoyle their subjects / and by the conseque^t these freres
mynours or prechours the which lawfully be presented unto the bysshoppes / as
if it so be that they have of comen right in that power to assoyle / as have
these curates. Also in like wise as the curate may assoyle his subject as well
in his parysshe as with out / In semblable wise may do these above said
relegyons again them of the diocyse where they have be presented / otherwise
their preuylege shall be restaynt / the which thing the right will not suffer
/ than when the sinner is dysposed as it is said / and he has found a
chapelayne the which has iurysdyccyon and power to assoyle / as should our
holy fader the pope the which has power pleanere and general to assoyle all
them of crystyente and of all cases without any to be except / or the bishop
upon all them of his bysshopryche of all cases except those the which ben
reserved unto the pope / or y^ curate the which may assoyle his parysshynges
of all cases the which be not reserved by right or by custom unto the pope or
unto the bishop / or unto other priests reguler / or seculer / the which by
co^myssyon general / or specially / and auctoryte with license of the one of
y^ three before said. That is to know of the pope of the bishop / or of the
curate / Also that the said sy^ner has love or preuylege general / or
special to chese a confessor idoniu^ than he ought to tell and declare unto
y^ confessor all his sins every one in pertyculer so as god unto him shall
give knowledge / and also the cyrcumstaunces the which may change the sin in
to diverse manners. As in the sin of theft a man ought to take heed if he be
culpable / of vseryes / of symonyes / of falls weyghtes / of mesures / of ravens
or sacryleges / for they y^ which wyttyngly and by malice alonely accuse them
alonely of theft / and they have committed sacrylege / extorcyon / or vsery
they be not well confessed / but they sin mortally / In like wise is it of
the sin of lechery / for who so him accuses of fornycacyon / and has
committed auoutry / or incest / defloracyon / or sacrylege / and so of these
other espyces they be not confessed / and they synnen mortally / and therefore
the person the which is confessed ought to tell clearly his case / and if he
be sy^ple y^ confessor hy^ ought to declare his greef and hardness of his case

Here folowen.x. points by one of the which or many the confession may be no
thing / and also instruccyon for to examen well him the which is in the
sacrament of marriage.
AFter these things before said the person that will make good confession
unto the health of his souleought well to take heed unto these.x. points that
folowen / for by one of them / or by many y^ co^fessyon may be no thing. The
first is yt he be not in ye sentence of cursyng / for if it were so holy
church has no power him to assoyle / of any mortal sin / till unto that /
that he be loused For otherwise he is not partener of the sacraments of holy
church. The second point is yt the sinner ought to take heed to make
conscience there it ought to be made / and not to make it where it ought not to
be made. For by the defaute of these. i* points / the confession may be
nothing / and often times it happens unto many that they make no conscience /
in the case of vseryes / of symonyes / of gifts the which they make otherwise
than by lyberall love. Also of cursyd wylles dysposed to sin mortal / when
they have not put them in effect nor that they have left that to do for the
love or fere of god / but alonely for fere worldely or fere tobe dampened / or
else that they have not had place time and oportunyte / Also as not to have
co^plysshed the works of mercy in place and in time / as a man is bound by
the commandment of god / and upon the pain of dedely sin / ye which
thing is hard unto simple people to understand but by y^ dyscrecyon and good
aduysement of the co^fessours after the doctrine of the treatise precedent of
the works of mercy. Also he has no^ taught and corrected them that a man is
bound to correct in place and in time. Also when a man owes lawfully any
thing / And that a man has well power to pay it / and he unto whom a man
owes it wills and requires to be paid / and the dettour has not of
Justyce excusacyon that he should not and may pay / than such redeuable is
contynually in the estate of dedely sin / and may not be assoyled if he have
not will to acquyte him as soon as he may And here appears the culpe of many
simple and ygnoraunt confessors the which of these cases and other semblables
they do not make conscience unto them that they assoylen / who many and often
times owen to poor people / the which by the defaute of their payment ben
gretely da^maged / In the which case they be h^lden to recompense them / The
third point is that the sinner ought to take heed that the confession be
entyer / in leuynge nothing to his wyttynge / or by defaute to do that that
is in him / after as it has been said here before / for he that does not his
deuoyre after as it is in the flagelyte humayne / and so by his defaute
forgoten one or many of his sins / the which he ought to confess all in
partyculer / his confession is not hole / And in this point I make great doubt
of the confession of them the which by their defaute take no head unto the
commandments of god / for to acco^plysshe them / and for to keep hy^ from
sin and also him to accuse and confess of y^ transgressyon of them the
which they might have learned and understand in one day / or in tweyne for
well and suffycyently them to confess for ever all their life. and for the
more clearly to understand this peril and this defaute a man may consider ye
person y^ which is of.xxx. year / has a. M. v. c. and three score so^dayes in
the which he has been defended all erthely works that him may let to think
on god and of his benefyces for to thank him. And also he ought to learn these
things necessary unto his soul and to think on his conscience / and on his
sins for to confess him worthily. And for as much as the more great party
of bodily people done ill their devour / on the sondayes and th^^e other
feestes to think on their co^scyences / they can not be confessed as in
general where they should be confessed in partyculer if he hold it not in
their defaute. Now is it written as well in right as in reason that none ought
to have prouffyte of his crime and defaute / And therefore it excedeth mine
understanding and reason if such confessyons ben vylable before god / the
which thing I leave in the depnesses of Jugementes dyuyne. The fourth point
that y^ sinner ought to take heed that he tell all that whereof he has mind
unto one confessor and not unto tweyne or unto many / for if unto his wytrynge
he t^ll one part unto one / and part unto another malycyouslly he synneth
mortally and he shall not be assoyled of the one ne of the other. But if by any
case he were sent again unto the sovereign / it shall suffyce to tell the case
wherefore he has been sent again / so that he has all told unto the first The
fyfth point is that he ought to be aduysed parfytly if he be ready to pardon
with good heart / the ill will unto them yt have him offended / For as says
our savior in y^ euangelyste. if we pardon not unto our malefactors the
rancour that we have again the^ god shall not pardon us in like wise he that
has offended any person in word or in deed / he ought to require pardon in
deed if he be present or to be in ferme purpose that to do it (...) place and
in time / when he shall find oportunyte. The.vi. point as unto regard of
people y^ which ben in marriage as in two points. The first is how they have
received the sacrament of marriage. The second is of the manner how they ben
governed / as unto the first it is to know that after the ordenau^ce o^ holy
church none may take in marriage his kynnesman / or his kynneswoman but that
one of the party^^ be at the leest at the fight degree / of the which degrees /
the brother and sister make ye first / the chyldern y^ which ben germay^s make
the second. The chylder of these germay^s the which ben called removed makes
the third. And the chyldern of the removed makes the.iiii. And the removed
from the removed makes the fyfth / and he that is said y^ fyfth may have in
marriage / her of the second of the third / and of the fourth / and so
consequently in line colla^erall for never may any have in marriage him / or her
the which is in right line be it in assendynge / or dyscendynge / and if any
be married wyttyngly with any of his lygnage under the degrees before said / he
synneth mortally / and more over he is acursyd And it is to be noted that by
habycyon carnal in fornycacyon is caus^ of affynyte with all them of the
lynage as well of the one part as of the other in the same degree the which
appertain unto the^ the which co^mytten such fornycacyon / an example. Thou
co^^nyt test fornycacyon with a woman all her systers naturalles ben thy
systers by affynyte / her neces ben thy neces / her germayns ben thy germayns.
And so of other and a like thing is it of the woman as in regard of a
fornycatour / and they may never mary with the friends / of the one ne of the
other / and if they mary them wyttyngly they ben acursyd and they ought to be
departed notwithstondynge any space of time / or of what so ever line that he
be comen from such marriage another thing it should be if after the marriage
legytyme of some they have company carnal / the woman of the kynred of her
husbonde / or the husbonde of the kynred of his wife / for the marriage shall
not be departed. But the party culpable falls in to such inconuenyent that
he may never require the deuoyr of marriage / unto the party if he be not first
dyspenced with / of the auctoryte of the pope but that he sin mortally. But
the party the which is not culpable him ought to yield with the dyspleasaunce
the which may fall in such case / and than the party culpable synneth not
mortally if he have not other dysordynau^ce and so it is good counseyll that
such person conspable such is dyspensacyon of the pope for to eschew the
perils the which may come by cause of such lettynge Also he ought to take heed unto the lygnage spyrytuall the which comes among many persons by
cause of the sacrament of baptem / or of confyrmacyon / that is to know /
between the child baptized / and them the which holden / and between these
chyldern natural ben they borne before or after / For the sone or the daughter
of any person may never be married / or marye with the chyldern naturalles of
their godfader or godmoder but the godfaders and godmoders well may mary their
other chyldern together / of whom the gossypred is not comen / many other cases
he may have by cause of cognacyon legal / and of the affynyte yt men call
Justyce dyshoneste openly / the which I pass by cause of shortness. Also a man
ought not to mary from the beginning of the aduent / till unto ye vtas of the
epephanie. Also from the septuagesime till unto the vtas of Ester. Also from ye
three days before ye Assencyon till unto the vtas of Pentecost And he yt does
other wise without dyspensacyon he synneth mortallly / and this is as unto the
first point of the sacrament of marriage.

Here follows the examynacyon of the person married.
AS unto the second point the which is of the gouernynge of the person
married in regard of his sacrament of marriage / it is to understand that after
as these doctors declaren the work of marriage / may be accomplysshed in five
manners / some time merytoryously / sometime with out sin / sometime with sin
venyall / sometime with such cyrcu^staunces that these theologyens doubten of
mortal or venyall / sometime it is mortal sin / first the work of marriage
may be acco^plysshed merytoryously when ye one of ye parties or both.ii.
together ben in ye estate of grace / and their intencyo^ is to have line / or to
yield ye marriage ye one with the other / or to eschew the peril of auoutry in
him or in her party / and in keeping the cyrcu^staunces the which appertain
unto the honest of marriage / when it is sin there is doubt of mortal / or
venyall / the good and suffycyent confessor it may comprehend by the
cyrcu^staunces of the deed / of the intencyon / and of the confession of people
married. But in seven manners a man may sin mortally with her party after as
declaren these doctors. The first is such when the man also ye woman ben so
much dysordynate / that they wyllen by delyberacyon accomplysshe the work of
marriage / with party the which is not his by marriage / and this case is here
hard to Juge / as unto judgment humayn / But god the which is Juge of
conscience sees clearly the troweth. The second case in the which he is in
danger of sin mortal is when the one party refuses the other without
excusacyon lefull. The third case is when ye man abused of his party for to
seche more greter pleasure carnal. The fourth when the woman is not in
dyspocysyon of her body that she should yield the deuoyre of marriage and his
party the which has of it knowledge is so much unreasonable that he will not
him abstayn / than synneth he mortally after as sayen comenly these doctors /
but the woman the which obeys again her will for to eschew the dangers of
incontynence / or other ill les the which may come in marriage synneth not The
fyfth is when these people married goo unto their wives in these great festes /
after as sayen some doctors / how be it saint Thomas says the sin is not
mortal / and the devout doctor Bonauenture / and also the doctor subtyle
the scotte holden that opinion / for the church he defends not the work of
marriage / in these feestes / but alonely counseylleth that a man absteyn him /
to the end that they be the better dysposed to pray unto god / for of as
much as a man puts the more his heart in pleasures carnalles / of as much
is a man the less dysposed to pray unto god / and the more ferther from his
love and they ought to make such abstynence of a comen assent / In like wise
as techeth saint Poul / and if the one of the said parties will not absteyne
the other party there ought to obe ye without fermynge conscience erronyous /
as if the party believes that it were dedely sin to obey in her party in
the deed of marriage in the time of great solempnyte / and nevertheless that
notwithstanding him she obeys / than she synneth mortally alonely / for as
much as she does contrary to her conscience the which is erronyous to believe
as to obey in her party in the said time is dedely sin. The.vi. when the
work of marriage is committed in place hallowed / as is the church / or
chirchyerde if these parties married may otherwise company togyders / and if the
case were known / the church or chirchyarde should be reconsyled after the
right. The seventh is when the woman is with child / and nere her time / and
they have by some experyence / or true semblable that the child may run in
any peril / and nevertheless by their incontynence they dyspose them unto
such pareyl they synnen mortally after some doctors / and un to that purpose
I have found other times a man married that by sorrow and remors of conscience
sought remedy and counseyll of that / that his wife has had four or five
chyldern all deed fair great and well formed / the which know not the cause
ne ye occasyon of ye death of y^ said chyldern nor other cause they could not
Juge / under the Jugement of god but their incontynence. for so as he said they
absteyn them not for any dysposycyon / or nerenesse of chyldynge that was the
party / and so it appears in many manners the estate / and honest of marriage
is evil kept of many people vile and carnal the which oftymes there
co^mytten the case of the bishop and many wrongs / of the which they make not
any conscience nor make not any confession / and oftymes god them ponyssheth in
their live by as much that they begete chyldern wrong / crooked / lame /
blind / messelles / or falling on the great ill. so as sayen these holy
doctors and therefore a man should take heed and teache yo^ge people of the
honor and reverence / of the fere and of the obedyence that they ought to
keep in ye sacrament of marriage and how they should mary them pryncypally for
the entencyon to have line y^ which may come unto the holy service of god /
and of holy church. after ye example of young Thobye unto whom the angel of
god taught / that as well he as his wife sarra them should absteyne from ye deed
of marriage after their benedyccyon the espace of three days and three nyghtes /
In the which time they should give them unto holy orysons / and so he did by
the which he was delivered from al pareyll and from the temptacyon of the
devil the which had before strangled seven husbondes y^ which had
espousyd the one after the other the said Sara / not alonely for the love of
line / and of the sacrament of marriage / but for the beauty of ye daughter and
to accomplysshe their pleasures carnalles. And this doctrine and techynge have
kept syns many good christian men and well taught / of whom they ben found in
the great benediccion of good line / of Joye / of consolacyon / and of long
life. The seventh point is that the confession is not merytoryous nor
suffycyent / for to ask newly the grace of god when it is done pryncypally by
custom / or for fere worldely / and not pryncypally for the love of god / and
of the salvation of ye soul the which thing is done most comenly / so as it
may be comprehended and arguyde by the life of the more part the which with
great pain them represent one time in the year and right late before their
confessoure. The.viii. point is when the sy^ner has no will nor ferme purpose
/ to ceas and to put end in his sin / for the time to come / and to fle the
occasyons of mortal sin. The.ix. is wha^ the sinner cheseth unto his
wyttynge for his confessor a simple chapelayne / the which is not suffycyent
nor idoniu^ / for to redress the deed of his conscience / after the vocacyon
and estate / of the which the sinner may be / or the which has not power to
assoyle. The.x. is when that the sinner has forgoten by his neclygence his
penance enjoined / or else he will not do it / be it to require pardonne / or
to pardon / be it to restore another / to fast / or to make prayer / for in
such case the confession is none / and ought to be withdrawn / and so it is
good counseyll y^ a man accomplysshe his penance in the estate of grace / for
in so doing he se^heth great merit again god / and with that a man
acquyteth him of temporal pain.

Here follows the practyse that he ought to hold the which entyerly him will
confess / and examen after the order of the.x. commandments of the law
after the most sure manner that there may be found.
WHo so ever will well and parfaytly exame^ Caplm xiiii.
his conscience in partyculer / he ought to rule him after the.x.
commandments of the law. For so as witnesses saint Austen a man may not
find a more certain practyse to examen well his conscience. Also says well
saint Gregorye that.x. commandments ben as ten myrrours / In the which the
soul crystened may clearly see and know the fylth of his sin and of the
dysordynaunce of his conscience. Also says the ryall prophet Dauyd / I shall
confess me well and ryghtly for as much as I have learned the ten
commandments of god / by the which it is well to be noted that no person
is bound him to confess regulerly and of necessyte but only of dedely sin
the which is not other thing but the transgressyon of any of the.x.
commandments in the which ben defended the seven deedly sins / Also there
be contained the seven works of mercy / and the troth of the artycles of our
holy faith. In y^ which things that is to understand in the commandments
of the law / in the artycles of the faith / and in the seven works of mercy
is comprehended and contained all the deed of the conscience in like wise as it
has been said before / And therefore who so ever will him well examen and make
parfyte and hole confession after these things said he ought to take heed how
he has kept and acco^plysshed the ten commandments of god / as well in the
thing commanded that is in sechynge virtues / and in accomplysshynge the
works of mercy as also in the thing defended / as ben the seven dedely
sins. That is to know / pride / envy / wrath couetyse / glotonye / sloth /
and lechery / In y^ which seven manner of sins a man may fall often mortally
and dampnably And sometime venyall alonely / for it is to believe that every
passion or mouynge of Ire / of envy / of vain glory / and so of other sins
before said ben always deedly sin But when such passions or wylles abyden
in the terms of venyall sin / or that they exceden till unto mortal sin.
That thing is right hard unto Jugement humayne / and it is not possible
therein to give a rule general suffycyent for to Juge of every case
inpartyculer / wheder it be mortal or venyall / after as it has been said
before in the seventh chapter of this party / and therefore as now I rest to
see in partyculer some case after y^ order of the ten commandments.

Here follows of the first commandment.
Over these things said in the first commandment Caplm.xv.
he the which will well purge his conscience ought to take heed unto these
points that folowen. First unto the brekynge of his vows / if any have been
broken / as who says not carynge by dyspysynge and inobedyence again god /
the which was lawful to hold / and to accomplysshe it is dedely sin / if a
man committee such fraccy / on by delyberacyon / or equyualente after the rule
put in the chapter of the science that a confessor ought to have the which
ought well to be noted for all these cases the which folowen in this matter of
all the ten commandments. Also it is to be noted that for as much that
there has been made mencyon in the treatise of the co^maundemen / tes / of all
the seven deedly sins. He the which by the study of this book will examen
his conseyence ought for to trust the things the which there has been said /
be it in general / in especyall with them that folowen in this recapitulacy on
of the commandments in partyculer / if any by syknes forgetfulness / or other
cause excusable breketh his vow that is no sin / or it is alonely venyall /
if he has auowed a thing unlawful he ne should accomplysshe it / but without
other dyspense ought more sooner to do all the contrary and him to confess of
so folysshely to have auowed thing the which is not lefull / or honest / if
he have tarried to accomplysshe his vows in such wise that he the^ has
forgoten / or by to much taryenge falls in to such inconuenyent that he ne
them may accomplysshe / some great theologyens will say and sustain yt it is
deedly sin / if he have made auowe to fast or to do other thing lefull /
for any cursyd end / as for to come to committee theft / auoutry or other
sin / he has sinned mortally / if he has made auowe of chastyte / or of
relegyon / and afterward him maryeth / it is deedly sin and as many times
and often as he requires on his party the devour of marriage / he synneth
mortally / but if he were required he may acquyte him in yeldynge the deuoyre
of marriage without deedly sin / by such wise that he loves better after the
will of reason him to content / and not to accomplysshe the work of marriage /
The which thing is ill to keep all the time of his life / and therefore they yt
ben in such inconuenyent they should make dyspense of their vow and be
assoyled of the sin / And it is to be noted that a curate may assoyle his
subject of the brekynge of his vows / but he may not dyspence / or them
change without special license of the pope / or of the bishop / after as the
case it requires. The dyspensacyon or co^mutacyon of the vow / of chastyte /
of pilgrimage unto Jherusalem / of Rome / of saint James ben reserved to the
pope. But the dyspence or commutacyons of other vows appertain unto the
prelates. Also it is to be noted that young people / that is to know ye
daughter under the years of.xii. accomplysshed / and the sone under the years
of.xiiii. may not vow / or enter in to relegyon of their own auctoryte not
withstondynge what dyscrecyon so ever they may have. Also auowe is not
oblygatory if it be not made by delyberacyon and full consent. Also a woman
married may not vow or observe the vow yt she has made before the marriage if
her husbond will not so consent / and if she has auowed after or before the
marriage / the husbonde her may make it to leave without other dyspense / and
without the sin of ye one or of the other / if y^ husbonde were not any time
consenting / The man may well vow without license of his party the which be
not unto the preiudyce of marriage. Also they the which vowen never to kembe
them on the friday or not to spynne on the satyrdaye / or other semblables
superstytucyons ought to leave such vows simple and full of vanytees / But do
after the ordenaunce of their wise and dyscrete confessor. and other holy
faders. Secondly the sinner ought well for to take heed if he be culpable / of
sorceryes / of wytchcraftes of charms / of inuocacyons of the devil / or of
adoracyons / or of paccyon with him and with his dyabolykes. Also if yt he have
used any evil craft / or if he have kept or retained books of the same. Also
if he have Jugyd of the death or of the life / and of the adventures of any
person by the constellacyons and knowledge of the planettes on the sky / or by
phylosephye. Also if y^ he have used of sort for to know any thing / if he
has byleued over much and steadfastly in the adventures of any dremes / if
that he has lokyd or caused to look in the tokens of the hand / for to know
the adventures of himself or of other / if he for any syknes has used little
scrowes / or of charms / if he has put dystyncyon in certain days As the
tewesdaye and the we^nysdaye / or other days for to begin any work / for to
make way in beleuynge that by one day he shall profit better than by a
another / if he has put faith for any adventures / in song or in cries of any
birds / or in the metynge of any beestes / or of other things / in all these
cases before said oftymes it is dedely sin / and right seldom venyall sin.

Here follows the second commandment.
OVer these things before said in the second Caplm xvi.
commandment / the sinner onght to take heed unto the points the which
folowen if he has sworn in certain / the thing the which is in doubt / It
is mortal sin / specially in Jugemente / if he has sworn to do thing the
which of it self is ill / as it should be to do sin / he has sinned
mortally / nor such oath ought not to be kept nor accomplysshed / if he has
showed wyttyngly the secret or the counseyll that he has sworn to hold
secret / It is dedely sin / as well in him that swereth as in him the which
wyttyngly makes such reuelacyon knowing well that it was given him for to
keep it secret / if he has sworn detestably / as by ye blood / by yt death /
or by the womb of our lord / it is dedely sin / And in such manner to swear
is reputyd also as to blaspheme / and in like wise to dysplease by Ire god and
his saints / if he has promised and sworn to do any thing lefull / and he
there trespasseth without excusary on reasonable and unto his wyttynge / it is
dedely sin / but the thing sworn may be such as to be te his child / or
other thing semblable the which is not accomplysshed / it is but sin
venyall / if he has constrained him to swear that he byleueth y^ he shall be
forsworn / it is deedly sin / except the Judge the which by the order of
right makes to swear any in Justice if in songs unhonest / and tryfylles /
and talkynges / of langage / he swereth god or his saints / it is deedly sin
/ also to swear troweth with out cause and for no thing. And also as at every
word he may with great pain be done without the contenement of the law of
god / and by the consequent it is deedly sin.

Here follows the third commandment.
OVer these things spoken in the third commandment Caplm. ^v^^.
the sinner ought to take heed unto the points the which folowen / if he
occupy himself his servants / or his chyldern in worldly works and cursyd on
the sunday / or on other festes given by the commandment / by covetousness and
without constraynt of necessyte / it is dedely sin as well in him that
commands / as in him the which obeyth and consents / if he has gone unto
fayres or unto markettes by his covetousness / in the said feestes / he there
may sin mortally.: / Other thing it shall be after mass herd / if he it
may goodly here / he gooth unto the fayrres or unto the markettes / As these
prelates of holy church suffren / without making special prohybycyo^ or
without the making of any punysshement / if he be occupied all the day / in
dysportes / in feestynges / in going on hunting and hawkynge with out herynge
mass / and sometime they occupye the se other it is deedly sin comenly / here
should they take heed / and seche good counseyll / tauerners / ^y bakers
hocsters / potycaryes / bayllyues and in like wise / sergeau^tes / and other
officers / Also tayllers cordyners / and generally all manner of people / of
labor and of noblesse of what so ever degree that they ben / for every man him
ought to examen after the vocacyon and estate in the which he lives and to
take heed for what occasyon and with what cyrcumstaunces / if he be occupied on
the holydaye in worldly works / for if that has been pryncypally by his
covetousness / it is dedely sin. Also frawdes evil thoughts clamacyons /
pariurynges and other tryfylles the which oftymes they co^mytten in all manner
of marchau^dyse / be it in weight / in mesure / in price / in substance / or
in qualyte / is more grievous sin on the holydaye than it should be another
day / for as much that in so doing there is the transgressyon of the
commandments / yt is of the third the which is to halowe the feestes in
the which is pryncypally the work of sin / and also of the seventh the
which defends all theft as shall be said here after.

Here follows the fourth commandment.
OVer these things said in the fourth commandment Caplm xviii
the sinner ought to take heed unto these points folowen / first if he has
spoken words unlawful unto fader or unto mother / if he has cursyd them / if
he has mockyd them / if he them has put or stryken / if he them has
provoked to wrath / and he in the wrong / it is dedely sin / if he them
would not obey in thing the which was good and lawful / it is deedly sin
/ when in that there is a contempt / for another thing it should be if by over
sight or in any neclygence or in thing of little reputacyon / if he ne them
has purueyde of their necessytes after as he may and ought to do / if he unto
them borne honor and reverence in place and in time it is comenly dedely
sin if he them has not acquyte after their death and accomplysshe their last
wylles and testamentes after as he may and ought well to do / it is deedly
sin / if he has been Irreuerende unto his other friends / unto his souerayns
as unto people of the church / unto officers and unto his lords / if he has
not taught his chyldern and other of his household in making them to keep the
commandments of god / to receive the sacraments in place and in time in
prouydynge them of meet and of drink / of clothe and hosynge honestly after
his power and his estate / if he them has caused to leave pride / bosty^ges and
vanytes / if he them has suffered to be found in dau^ces in companyes
peryllous and unhonest if he has made his servant or servants to work on
the holidays / in all these things ^^e may have deedly sin / after the
cyrcumstaunces and modyfycacyon of mortal sin the which has been spoken
here tofore.

Here follows of the fyfth commandment.
OVer these things before* said in the fyfth Caplm.xix.
commandment the sinner ought to take heed unto these points folowen /
first if he has done manslawghter of any person be it in deed / in thought
or by ill doing / in using things unlawful / as it should be to cast stones
without dyscrecyon / or any draught / or in doing thing unlawful and aduyseth
not them the which may be in danger / or by necessyte euytable or not / In
the which necessyte he should be fallen by his culpe / as if in himself
defendyng he kylleth the husbonde of any woman with whom he should be found
unhonestly / in all these cases it is dedely sin. Also if any Judge give
sentence of death / by envy / by Ire / or by his covetousness upon the which he
has deserved to dye or not. It is deedly sin / if a woman with child take
any thing to procure the death of her fruit and they the which counseyllynge
or thereto consenten synnen mortally follow the deed of the death of ye child or
not / and if ye fruit has soul that should be homycyde and the case of the
bishop in all them the which gynen counsel / consentyng or aydynge / if
fader or mother / or nouryce / stop the breath of a little child / by ouersyght
/ or otherwise there may be deedly sin / by their neclyge^ce and defaute of
good keeping if a woman with child by to much labor / by her auaryce / for
to hold acquaynted / for to dance / or for other ordynaunces leseth her
fruit / she synneth mortally / if any smite or shoue a woman with child / by
such Jurysdyccyon that she leseth her fruit / it is dedely sin / if manor
woman enforce them to find ways / or manners by the which he may let that
ye woman conceive not a child / it is deedly sin / if any smite or hurt an
other / in taking from hy^ any of his members / or of the usage of them with
out the order of Justyce it is deedly sin / if he give counseyll
commandment / or ratifye / and has except that any be killed / or beten
again ye order of Justice and of charity / it is deedly sin / not
withstanding that the deed follow not / if he desire the death of a another with
delyberacyon / be it for hate / for envy / or for any other cursyd cause / it
is deedly sin / another thing it should be to desire the death of any
malefactors for as much as they hurt the goods of any good man after the
Jugement humayne / if he smite and wound wrongefully any in the church / or
in the chirchyarde / it is sacrylege / and the place hallowed polutyde / if he
has made make / or causes to be made Justes in the which there may be peril
of death / it is sin / many other cases partyculers may come touching the
matter of the fyfth commandment / of the which those unto whom they comen
them ought to advise and pourge.

Here follows of the.vi. commandment.
OVer these things before said in the. vi commandment / in Caplm.xx.
the which suffycyently enough has been spoken of diverse manners of lechery
the sinner should take heed unto these points the which folowen. First if he
has touched unhonestly / or kyssed for to draw the person unto the sin of
lechery it is deedly sin notwithstandy^ge that none other thing follow / if
he has written borne or sent letters unto his knowledge for to provoke any
person unto the sin of lechery / it is deedly sin / if he has made songs
spoken or herd the which should be vile and provoking unto the sin of
lechery / pryncypally for to enduce him or other unto sin / it is deedly
sin / if he has accompanied any or if he has given favor of assembles /
or if he has made messages / or presents / for to draw unto the sin of
lechery it is deedly sin / And in like wise of those the which unto such
intencyon receyuen gifts / or promysses / if he has taken delectacyon to
think on the deed of lechery the which is deedly sin / he synneth mortally
/ when there is delyberacyon / if that he has had cursyd will / and
consented unto the deed of lechery / and of such will proceden lokynges /
spekynges / touchynges in him or in other / it is deely sin / In like wise as
the will whereof such things proceden / not that such a will and the deed
that follows ben two sins / but they ben but one alonely / here ought they
full well to take heed every good person that by his prayer by his lokes / or
by his abyllymentes he ne gives occasyon unto another of folysshe thought or
of cursyd will / for the occasyon may be such yt it should be dedely sin.
Also it is to be noted that of the sin of lechery proceden many passions by
the mean of whom a man falls oftymes unto sin / and in to great
inconuenyens / that is to know offuscacyon of the very knowledge / and of
understanding preceptacyon / inco^syderacyon / inconscyence / love dysordynate
/ of his own sensualyte love of this present life / hate of ye Justyce and
ordenau^ce of god / And therefore the sinner ought to exame^ if for his sin of
lechery he is in such wise occupied that he has left to think on god / and
on his salvation if he has been precypytant and without delyberacyon in his
works and besynes. if he has been without due examynacyon of that that he has
done / or for to do / if he has changed his good purpose / and it has left
above all to do / if he has excessyuely sought the pleasures and cases of his
body / if he has to much loved this present life / / or the delytes of the
flesh / if he had in dyspleasure the law of god for as much as it
defends the concupyscence of the world and of the flesh and in every of
these things / to have so great exces that it is deedly sin after as
declares saint Gregorye.

Here follows of the seventh commandment.
OVer these things before said in the seventh commandment unto the sin of
couetyse ye sinner should take heed unto these points that folowen. The first
is of symony. The second of usury. The third is of frauds and decepcyons The
fourth is of iniquyte again Justyce. The fyfth of bysshoppes. The syxte of
chanons / of curates / and of other benefyced. The seventh of iniquyte / or
defaute of Justyce in lordshyppes seculer. The.viii. of Juges ben they of the
church / or of secularyte. The.ix. of aduocacyons / of procurers of notaryes /
be it in court of the church / or the secularyte. The.x. of phe^ycyans. The.
x^. of restytucyon necessary unto salvation.

Here follows the first of symonye.
AS unto the first the which is of symony the sinner should take heed if he
has given money or other thing by paccyon and with his good will / for to
have or to receive any of the sacraments of holy church / or other
benedyccyon having intencyon them to bye or to obtain for by cause of such
thing given / it is symony and deedly sin / another thing it should be of
his good will for alms / or for the reverence of the sacrament / or of the
benedyccyon / or for any custom / unto the which to keep he shall not be
enforced / and if he committee the sin of symonye / as well of him that
sells these things spyrytuall / as also of him that them byeth such things
and the which ben cause and mean that to do / if he give any thing
temporal for to obtain chapel / personage / prebende / or other benefyce of
the church / or for to be presented unto any office of y^ church it is symony
and deedly sin. for to pay the tax of the court of Rome for to obteyn
bulls / of benefyces / or other letters apostolycalles / it is not reputyd
symony / if he has bought or sold the sepulture of holy church it is symony
/ if he has sold or bought unto his wyttynge the right of a patronage / of
personage / or of chapel or of other benefyce ecclesyastycall / it is symony /
if he has made prayers and supplycacyon^ unto prelates of the church for to
benefyce any / the which of that was indygne / as the which has not cunning
suffycyent for the excucyon of the office / or the which is not of honest life
/ or the which has not aege co^petent / it is symony / if any foundatour / of
chirch or patron has received gifts or promysses for to present any unto the
benefyce / by cause of the which gifts he has been presentyd / it is symony
and deedly sin / if he has received gifts or promysses for to be mean to
procure unto any clerk order or benefyce of the church / it is symony in
both.ii. if he has made paccyon to receive of any thing temporal for to
preche the word of god / it is symonye in the one and in the other / if he
has made couenaunte of certain so^me for him / or for other for to be
received in to relegyon / the which is of great / and suffycyent foundacyon /
for to sustayn the membre of relegyous men or relegyous women it is symonye in
both two parties / another it shall be after these doctors when the foundacyon
of y^ monastery is not suffycyent / for than a man may make covenant of the
quantyte of gifts not having intencyon to bye any thing spyrytuall / if he
has procured by his own prayers and supplycacyons Thom^. in iiii
to obtain benefyces / unto y^ which he has cure of souls / some doctors
will say that he is a symonyacle for as much as he him shows indygne / and
meke / prayer made for good intencyon / and with that intencyon to have silver
for to do with such silver other good work / such intencyon is not evil nor
corrupt / for two good ends be not co^traryes Nota quam magis^^ cipale non ^
(...) minus pricipal^s.
/ know ye that silver may not be the self end / or pryncypall to make
prayers / or predycacyo^ prayers made in intencyon pryncypally for to have
silver to put it unto folysshe vsages / it is deedly sin / symony and
sacrylege like unto the sin of Judas / as unto the regard of the mass / of
the which some taken.xii. pens the which ben worth thyrty pens for to put
them in folysshe usage / as it may be to wexe rich / by auaryce / or with
other manners indeuyde / and if the said prayer be made by Mag. io. gerso^
sinners in other things so much the less it is worth know ye again thew
the which make such priests to sing wyttyngly / if he has renou^cyd unto
any benefyce by such paccyon yt it should be given unto his kynnysman / or
unto any other the which for so doing him has promised any thing temporal
/ it is symony in the one and in the other / mo and many other cases of symonye
/ there may be found / as well in prelates of the church / as in lords
temporal / as in all other degrees of persons / of whom I pass over as at
this time by cause of shortness notwithstondynge be the clerk well aduysed /
the which in receyuynge ordres / or benefyces / is fallen in symony that he is
irreguler / and synneth mortally in executynge offices of holy ordres before
that he be dyspensyd with.

Here follows of usury the which is co^myttyd as well in deed as in will.
AS unto the second the which is of usurers the sinner ought to take heed if
he has le^te money or other thing whereof the usage is consumpcyon of that /
as should be corn / or wine / by paccyon / or intencyon pryncypall for to
receive more than he gave / that is usury and deedly sin if he has lent
upon gage of thing moeuable / or also of heritage / by such condycyon or
pryncypall intencyon / that he shall have the usage / or the fruytes / and leave
of the said charge / without deductynge and rebaytynge of the sum lent / it
is usury except the gendred kynnysman the which takes any wages / in
attendynge the promysse the which unto him has been made / by cause of the
marriage of his wife by such wise that he her mayntene as a husbonde ought to
mayntene his espouse / And it is well to be notyd in this matter that there ben
two manners of vsuryes. The one is clearly open as that before said. The other
is hyd and is commytte in diverse manners / if that he has bought lands and
possessions for little / and mynyssheth the price for as much that the seller
puts in his bargayne that he may bye again his heritage with in certain time
/ he co^mytteth vsurye if he rebate not that / that he has received over the
costs and layenges of ye said heritage / if he sell many times the more harder
/ for that that he leneth in abaytynge his payment till unto a certain time /
how be it some what he may sewe more specially when he loves better to have
upon the ower a less price than to tarry / Also when he has bought certay^
ware as corn / or wine / the which ben yet for to gadre / and for as much
that he has auauncyd yc payment he gives less than the thing is worth at
the ower / or at the time that he it should receive it is vsery. Also when he
leneth pryncypally for the intencyon to have presents / money / aid / or
other thing temporal / it is vsurye / if he has betaken bestyall unto haluys
by such condycyon / yt if there happen mortallyte or other adventure of loss
/ whereof he the which them taken is not the cause / nevertheless his catyll
shall be ever more sauf and entyer / it is usury / and for a rewle general
always as in such contractys / be it of sheep / of la^bes / of the hyre of
oxen / or of other bestes that the one of the parties makes his price and
paccyon in such manner that he is assured to win or nothing to lose what so
ever that there happen / and the other party abides in doubt and subject to
the adventures of fortune / such co^tracte is again reason and again Justyce
/ but when the exces of the one party / or of the other is such that with
great pain he may be in loss / or in gayns so yt they entende no fraud the
one unto the other. I put that every of them awayte unto his own proffyte /
here is none vsurye / if the procurer or tuter of any faderles chyldern gives
their fynau^ce unto usury to the end yt the said fynau^ce unto them shall
prouffyte / and that by that mean / they were nourysshed or their maryages
augmented / and also that poor marchaundes by such mean that them might
auantage / that notwithstondynge / it should be deedly sin / and to the said
procuroure / or tutour is bound to restore the said vsurye in case if they the
which have had the prouffyte / will not restore. In like wise as they there
ben pryncypally bound. Also it is well to be noted yt many sellers and buyers
ben full of vsurye / before god and after good conscience as well for the cause
of the entencyon of the being / as also of the selling / the which always
semen to be lawfully sold after the form of the contracte and of the words /
as for example Martyn has necessyte to find an hundredth crowns for to lene /
but he seeing and knowing that no man him will do that pleasur he comes unto
Petyr unto him she wynge his necessyte / by the which he is dysposed to selle
him. xl shelynges of rent upon his heritage / by such condycyon that till
unto the term of seven years / as many times and as often that he shall yield
the sum lent / that is an hundredth crowns Peter is hounde him to deliver his
heritage / In such cases and semblables the intencyon and the condycy ons of
the seller and of the byer should be weyed and considered for if the seller
had not intencyon yt these.xl. shelynges should abide for ever unto the byer
/ the which entencyon ye byer knows or unto him it is very semblable by some
mean. Also of his party he wylled and desired that the contracte were made
under the form of sale / and not of winning / unto y^ that without knowledge
of usury his hundredth crowns he may purchase upon him of such contracte / and
semblable may a man say that it is a wulfe couerde with a shepes skin. That
is to know (...) usury the which comes of wnnynge hyd specially when the
seller was indygent or nedy and a person dygne of mercy. For in such case the
sum taken lened by cause of the said sale is such that he should rebate as
many times and as often as the seller shall yield his money / In this matter to
dyscende unto all cases / condycyons / and cyrcumstaunces in partyculer for to
Juge certainly that there is usury / and deedly sin or venyall / it is a
thing right hard without the grace especyall of god / for the malycyous
auaryce of erthely people has so many found of eauil lacyons that with great
pain there may go out of the way all the most gretest and most yllumyned
doctors / for the which cause I pass over from my other cases partyculers.
Also it is holden for a rule general / as to lene money it may be done in five
manners. The first lyberally without any in tencyon of any retrybucyon
corporal / or temporal over the sum given / and that manner is good and
charytable. Secondly with such condycyon that he the which receives that
land of money in marchaundysynge unto the half of loss or of gain / and
such contracte may well be made and he the which has lent may receive a
more greater sum than he has given / But for the condycyon of persons / or
for the aduersyte of the intencyon of auaryce* or of other / he there may have
lettynge. Nota
Thyrdly in putting the chatell that is the sum given in certaynte / and the
gayn in certain / that is to understand / that lose or win he y^ which
receives under such form / he shall yield always the said so^me / and if he
win ye bayllye takyth auantage / here is usury manifest. Fourthly unto the
contrary of this last case. That is to understand in putting the gayn in
certain and the chatell under incertayne / as for An example / I lene the an
hondreth crowns where with thou shalt marchaundyse at my pareyll with all the
sum / by such wise that after a year / or another ^erme thou shall yield me
syx crowns. or.x. or mo or less / and if thou lose by fortune the said
hondreth crowns / upon me it is al and if it be sauyd he it shall yield with
the sum spoken / such contracte is full of usury after the right / the
cause is such for the hope that such a lener has more is more to win than

example. I lene the an hundredth crowns by such wise that after the year paste

it be lawful in any case to receive any thing because of the lone. It is
lawful in five manners. The answ^
First a man may well receive a thing spyrytual as is the lone and the good
grace of him unto whom he has lent. Also if of free will he gives any
thing or it may receive / so that the lone has not be made to such
intencyon. Secondely by reason of dysda^mage / as if the lone has been made
under a certain pain it for to yield at a certain time / and that by the
defaute of that for to do the lender were in damage without ficcyon / in this
caas he may for by cause of the dysda^mage take the said pain with his
pryncypall if that the said pain were not excessyue and unreasonable. Thyrdely
by reason and cause of the doubt / unto the which the lender is submysed / in
like wise as it appyreth in the second caas of the notable before said in
lendynge unto the half of loss or of gayns. Fourthely by reason of the
damage that he renneth in the which lended / by cause of the said ready. As
for an example. At your great request I lend you an hundred crowns for a year
/ in the which after god and good conscience I shall be in damage in the
sum of ten or twenty crowns. Than if he the which borrowed sees that it
should be better unto his prouffyte to take the said sum and to restore the
damage of the lendynge he it may do / and the other it receive over the
pryncypall for to keep him / and to recompense him the damage. Fyfthtly by
reason of the hyre of a thing the which he may hyre / as oxen / horses / and
other things that a man may receive / some times more in valor that they were
at the time of the hyre / and with the hyre. But for to receive more than a man
has lent in any other manner wise than here before has been said or done
against the commandment and a man sells the thing imprecyable / and the
which proprely may not be sold. That is to understand the pleasure and the
charity that every creature ought unto his neighbor / as well by ye law of
nature as by the law of holy scripture / the which laws and all other ben
they Canons or Cyuyles defenden ye sin of vsurye. Also if any gyne old corn
or other thing semblable for to renew it having intencyon pryncypall that
the new shall be more worth and else he would not give it he committed vsurye
But if he do that pryncypally to the intent that his thing perysshe not / or
for to do a pleasure unto his neighbor / or in true semblable doubt if that
the thing be more worthy or less at the time that it shall be yielded again
in such a caas it is none vsurye. The pain of usurers publysshed is such
that they ben exco^munycate of right wherefore the holy church defended that
unto such there be not given the precious body of Jhesu christ. Also that
their oblacyon be not received in the holy church. Also that after their death
their bodies ben cast in a void ground and not received in the place holy and
blessed. For a man ought not to doubt but that the souls of them the which
deyen in such estate ben dampened with the deuylles in hell / wherefore the
bodies should not be put to rest with the faithful christian men. And if in
their last days they require penance they may not be assoyled / but in
doing yt yt in them is possible to restore all these vsuryes yt they have
received in all their life / and it suffysed not to be received unto ye
sacraments of holy church / and assoyled to orden by their testament yt after
their dethes these vsuryes ben restored / but it behooved to dyspose mouable and
heritage till unto ye sum the which may amou^te the said vsuryes and if they
unto whom he ought to make restytuco^n ben present hy^ behooved them to make
full satysfaccion in yeldynge it all / be it by fynau^ce marvel / by gage / or
assygnaco^n. And if they ben absent ye Juge of ye court or his lyuetenau^t / or
ye bishop / deane / or curate sholden represent ye persons in receyuynge the
said satysfaccyon and in caas yt mouables and herytages suffyse not* as often
it happened after yt they have all laid mouables and herytages as it is said /
they should require mercy of god / of holy church / and of them unto whom
they ben redyuables / and than a man may them assoyle and not else. For the
testament that they make in any manner wise is of no valor nor effect after
the right. Unto that peril is bounden wives / childern / neuewes / nyces / or
enherytoures the which wyttyngly retaynen the goods mouables or herytages of
usurers the which have not made in their life suffycyent restytucyon or
satysfaccyon / and it ought to be restored if that it be possible / not all
oonly the sum of that has been received by vsurye but with that the damage
that they might have had by cause of them the which have paid the said
vsuryes / by the which it apyreth clearly that full few of usurers escapen
the devil. In like wise also it appyreth the peril of those y^ which
receyuen in their chirches or chircheyerdes unto sepulture the body of an
usurer / such as has been spoken. For the priests the which do it wyttyngly
ben exco^munycate ipso facto after the new right. Also it is to be noted that
he the which takes unto vsurye for his great necessyte of him the which is
an usurer renommed and is ready that for to do sinned not in taking unto vsurye
/ but to take unto vsurye for auaryce / or for to dyspende folysshely / or for
to enduce any to give unto vsurye the which it has not accustomed it is a
sin much grievous. And this is shortly as unto the second point.

Here follows of fraud and of decepcyon.
AS unto the third point the which is of frauds and of decepcyons the which
is committed of diverse manners of people / and in diverse manners the sinner
should take heed. First in deed of marchaundyse over the things said of
vsurye / if he has done fraud by falls weyghtes or any falls mesures or in the
selling of any falls thing corrupt or meddled in affermynge that it is good
and pure be it metalles / appotecaryes / wine / oil / or any other ware / by
the which the byer is notably defrauded / it is deedly sin / syns in a
little thing it is venyall sin. How be it / it is well to be noted that if
any man defraude and dysceyued his neighbor in a little thing / that he him
would well dysceyue in a more greter thing if he might such synnen mortally.
For god that sees all weyeth more the good will than the work withoutforth.
If he has frauded and retained taxes serches passages / or other imposicyons
made by the ordinance of Justyce it is deedly sin. Also if people of
seygnourye and of Justyce have made prestes taxes and imposicyons by auaryce or
tyranny / and not for the comen well it is mortal sin. Also if he has
falsed books of receyte / or other lettres unto the notable damage of an
other it is deedly sin. Also if the merchant marchau^dyse pryncypally for
auaryce or for to increase his catell and not for to live honestly after his
vocacyon or for to aid the poor / or for the wealth of the comunalte / it is
deedly sin / when in such gayns he puts his pryncypall entente. If any
bye stuff or ware in intencyon for to selle them again more derer without
chaungynge them in doing with them any craft / as is the corn / or the wine
/ not as it should be by the way for to write / or of wood for to make any
craft for to selle it / or without caryenge it from one regyon in to an other
for the common wealth / but pryncypally secheth by such manner to increase his
catell such marchaundyse is unlawful / and there he may have deedly sin
after as says master Frau^ces de maronis. Also if they have made paccyon
between them for to selle their ware rudely and at a price not competent / by
the which the commons be constayned for to bye it at their price / it is deedly
sin. Also if he be paid with one ware for an other / by the which that
seeing he has above made his own / and mynysseth and hurts the other
mortally it is deedly sin. Also if he has paid simple people in falls money
/ it is fraud and decepcyon and deedly sin. Also if he has used flaterynge
speech and of swerynges / to selle indyfferently at the day of the feste
commanded / or in hallowed place often there is deedly sin. Also if he has
bought of robbers of thieves / where that he byleued the thing to be such that
it apperteyned unto them Justely it is deedly sin. Also if he has been the
mean of any co^tracte that he byleued to be unjust / as of vsurye in byenge
of heritage / or in corsynge of horse / or in treating of marriage / seeing and
knowing the grievous damage of the one of the parties it is deedly sin. By
these things beforsayd of the vocacyon and estate of marchaundyse a man may
apply unto other laborers and handcrafty men / ben they drapers / taylers /
cordeners / weuers / tauerners / bakers / pie bakers / smethes / carpenters /
massons / golsmithes / laborers with their arms / laborers of the earth / for
in every vocacyon there may be fraud / treachery / and malice in their work /
be it in weight or mesure / in valor / in intencyon / or in these other
circumstau^ces / if god and pureness of conscience ne them adresse. And therefore
they should consider their estate and occupacyons / as well by them as by the
aid of their confessor / and declare the frauds that they known well to do
/ and to speak more subtylly y^ no clerk by writing may them declare / and
they should tell wheder they were for to leave such manners of frauds or not /
and it show and confess plainly / for if they have intencyon to return in
co^tynuynge their dysceyuable manners to use / they ne ought to be assoyled.
Also if any him meddle of office / or craft the which he may not do without
deedly sin / as to at house steues side / to do service unto these usurers /
to meue war the which is not Just / to make these mixions wherwt women
paynte their vysages / and so of other vocacyons such ought not to be assoyled
/ if they have not will never for to return unto the said office. Also people
y^ which geten by their Journeys and them faynen and sparen to work / or y^
which in evil wise done their work / and yt notwithstanding will be well
paid they ben thieves and bound to make restytucyon. As for an example. They
have promysse of.xij. pens for the Journey / and I put yt a man thinks it
suffycyent / how be it after god and good conscience they get not but.x. pens
/ for as much as they do not their Journeye lawfully they ben thieves of.ij.
pens upon the Journeye ye which amou^ted at the end of the year yt a man has
made.cc. such Journeys ye sum of.xvi. ^.viij. d. of the which sum they
ought make restitucyon. And oftyme it happened by y^ Jugement of god yt unto
such people their goods increase not nor yet profyten / but some them
dyspende in tauernes or unto them comes losses and da^mages / by ye which
they fallen in necessyte of pouerte and of no power to restore yt the which
should be well with reason. And by such mean ben deceived by the devil
without nombre / and so to do he is aided by confessors ignorauntes the which
assoylen su che people without them enioynynge restytucyon / or without the
counsyll the which upon that should be given.

Here follows of iniquyte or defaute of Justyce.
AS unto the.iiij. point the which is of iniquyte or Justyce / yt is of the
defaute for to do and yield Justyce and reason unto his neighbor the sinner
ought to take heed. And for as much as to yield / keep / and to defend
Justyce it aperteyned pryncypally unto y^ prelates of hol^chirche / and unto ye
lords erthely after as ye Jurisdicco^n of every of them extended and
consequently unto these Juges / advocates. proctours / notaryes / sergeau^tes /
prentyses / and witnesses of every of these estates and manners of persons some
thing it ought here to be showed for to examen all well / and first of the
prelacyon and seygnoury ecclesyastycall. If he were irreguler / suspende /
exco^munycate / bygame / illegittinie / or ^cubinarie open and known / and by
y^ consequens suspende at the time and hour yt he received y^ dygnyte / the
cure / or prelacyon he sinned mortally and is contynually in deedly sy^ne / and
in executynge his office committed always of new deedly sin before ye
dyspence and absoluco^n. If he has not ben elect canonly of the college or
patron unto whom it apperteyned or has be / received / and confermed of him
yt so to do has power / or unto yt is come by means forboden such is called
after ye right a wrong doer and thief and if he has not any manner of
puyssaunce or Jurysdyccyon for to dyspose / or to make office of any thing
temporal or spyrytuall aperteynynge unto the office or benefyce he sinned
mortally as oftentimes as he him endeavored to excecute that the which
aperteyned unto the said office or benefyce. If he has made prayers by
himself or by other for to be chosen and received unto the said office he is a
symonyacle / and if he has had paccyon or covenant the dyspence aperteyned
unto ye pope. and before y^ dyspence he holds theuyshly the office or
dygnyte. If he suffer and dyssymule any great ylle in his subgectes that he may
after the right purge and correct it is deedly sin. If he has favored any
against Justyce and unto the damage of the other / if he has lost and wasted
the goods of ye church in folysshe vsages / if he has rebelled against reason
unto his soueraynes. Also if he has been neclygent to get good and suffycyent
counseyll for to seche Justyce / by the which defaute the party has been in
damage. In all these things it is dedely sin. Also if he has put officers
indygne or unworthy specially in cures of souls where a man them knows for
such and them may wtsaye lawfully and repelle / and is neclygent that to do it
is deedly sin. Also if he has suffered confessors ignorau^tes with great
peril and damage of souls the which he may undertake it is deedly sin.
Where some is indygne / or to much ignorant apyreth in y^ chapter of y^
science necessary unto a confessor Also if he has been curyous and proud in
buyldynges / in heyght / in horses / harneys / abyllymentes / in great and
peryllous dyspences unto the great damage / as well of the church as of y^
poor it is deedly sin. Also if he has been more curyous of the temporalyte
than of the spyrytualyte / after the exces much or little it is mortal sin
/ or venyall. Also if he has left to lose the right and preuyleges of his
prelacyon / or of the benefyce after as they aperteynen of right the neclygence
may be mortal. Also if he has dyspensed vndyscretely by the which they be
become recheles and unthrifty / or by the contrary have been to hard and
inhumayne to dyspense / and to puru^ye for the enfermetes of his subgectes
after the exces of much or of little it is mortal sin or venyall. Also he
ought to be the light and example unto his subgectes in all things / in few
words and of things prouffytable in quenchynge dyscordes / in reprouynge
detraccyons or bac^ytynge / grutchynges / falls reports / mockeryes / and
folysshe langages. Also he ought to be circonspect in all things / and
specially in holding secret ye caas the which happened after as it is of
right and of charity. Also yt he be in fere of honor and of reverence the
which unto him ben done by cause of his prelacyon / for of that with other
things before said him behooved to yield acounte. Also of the correccyon the
which unto him apperteyned by cause of the office over the common y^ which
he ought to do with all after the law of charity / of the which had been made
mencyon before. Also he is bound to pastoure his sheep as a good shepeherde by
good doctrine and good example / and them to defend unto his power from the
wolves rauysshynge as ben prechours that prechen pryncypally for to go with
their silver or other goods. Also of tyrau^tes and extorcyoners the which
oftentimes them deuouren unto the wyttynge and knowledge of prelates And here
he may have such exces of neclygence with these other circumstaunces that it
is mortal sin. For the prelate spyrytuall ought to be the fader and defender
of poor people / of children faderles and moderles / and also of wydowes / and
ought to have special heart on their causes.

Here follows more in partyculer of bysshopes.
AS unto the fyfth point y^ which is of bysshopes / it is to be noted over
these things beforsayd in general touching ye estates of bysshopes yt he
ought to take heed first unto ye form and manner of his enter. For if he be not
entered regulerly as before has been said he is a thief / in like wise as our
lord says in the gospel. If he has given holy ordres by symonye in secret
wise he is suspende alonely as unto hy^ and is in mortal sin / and like wise
those ye which so ben ordained ben suspende and unto them it behooved to seche
dispense before yt they execute their offices. If he has given holy ordres
wyttyngly unto them yt have not age to determyn in right it is deedly sin /
for he may not dyspence at the said time. If he has given ordres wyttyngly
unto any ye which has not than the which should precede / or to give ordres
in an other time than of right without ye dispense of ye pope it is deedly sin
/ and he y^ which so has been ordained is supende. If he has left any thing
to do or to say the which is of the essence of the sacrament of holy ordres
him behooved all to go back for as much as in such sacrament it is create of
god / and gives a token spyrytuall named caractere. An other thing it should
be / if he left a thing the which should not be essencyall / how be it a man
should supplye in these other ordres / yt the which is forgoten / and y^
ha^gynge the clerk so ordened shol not office / nor there ne may ignorance
vycyous excuse such defautes. If he has not caused to make examen of the age
/ of the holy life / of the science / and of other things y^ which ben
requysyte of right in them the which should be ordained it is deedly sin.
For by such defaute many indygne ben received and ordained unto the great
preiudyce of souls and of all ye holy church. If he has been neclygent to
give the sacrament of confyrmacyon by y^ which many be deed without such
sacrament / and the great good spyrytuall and caractere the which in such
sacrament is received / or if in it gyuynge he has not kept the form / the
matter / and the place. That is to understand in y^ forhede / or wyttyngly it
gives two times unto one self person. If the very day of the ashes he has
not consecrate the holy creme and other things in keeping there the form and
ordinance of holy church / he there may have deedly sin. If he has not
consecrate in place and in time chirches chircheyerdes and ornementes. Also
abbotes and abbesses. Also in reconsylynge chirches and chircheyerdes. In all
these things he may have so great defaute and damage spyrytuell that it
should be deedly sin. If he has provided of benefyces / be it of cures of
souls / or without cure / those the which were notably indygne and it knows
or should know it is deedly sin. And in like wise in receyuyng them indygne
as some present by auctoryte of patronage. If he has given prebendes or other
benefyces unto his kynnesmen pryncypally for by cause of lygnage and in them
preferryng them unto them yt ben more worth it is deedly sin. If he has not
provided unto chirches of a rectour in time and in the manner yt is of right and
well possible / or if he has received unto holy ordres without title
suffysau^t / or has not vysyted his dyocyse / as right and reason it ryquyred
in prouydynge of confessors and other mynysters / in correctynge the defautes
the which is done against the sacraments / and the office dyuyne / and the
vices and sclau^dres of his clergy and of his subgectes. Also if he has not
made punycyons and correccyons after ye discrecyon and charity ordained unto ye
ryghtes / the damage of ye souls / the sclau^dre and these other ylles y^
which comes by ye occasyon of the defaute of ye things before said unto him
shall be imputed and much grievous the deed of conscience. In like wise as it
is well showed by ye figure of ye au^cyent testament in the.xxv. chapter of
nombres. For our lord seeing that none ne did correccyon in like wise as it
apperteyned unto ylle and sins the which reygnen in the people of god
commanded unto Moses that all the princes of the people should be hanged on
high gybettes / and for the defaute of correccyon deyed in one day. xxiiij.
thousand men of the people of god. Also if he has found new exaccyons for
to extorcyon gifts / promysses / or(...)

AS unto the.vi. point the which is of chanons / curates / and other benefyced
/ it is to be noted over these things beforsayd of symonye / and of the estate
of prelacyon that all they the which receyuen office or benefyce in the which
to execute and govern they have no conning competent / they synnen mortally
after as says saint Thomas in the.xviij. distiction du quart. Also chanons
curates and other prebendaryes should take heed if they have evil entreated ye
benefyce / as in lettyng the buyldynges to go unto ruin / or indyspendynge ill
/ and in folysshe usage ye fruy^^s / rentes / and reue^nes of them be it against
their rich friends or otherwise. For it is sacrylege after master Alexande de
halis in his tyers and they be bound to make restituco^n but whereof and in
what manner it is a hard thing unto many. If they have procured dyspenses to

many benefyces / pryncypally for ambicyon and by auaryce. Also if they have
received ye goods of ye benefyce without there making the service the which
unto it apperteyned / or there have committee person indygne and insuffycyent /
by the which it happened that the office of god is evil said / or the
sacraments entreated and admynystred unduly as it is of confessyons vnparfyte
by ye defaute of true examynacyon and to enjoin restytucyons. Also as is the
defaute to vysyte and to take heed unto ^^l^^^ nolumus incorrectu^ quam ^de^

Also if any has it posseded y^ benefyce of the church y^ which has not
insencyon to be finally a man of y^ church it is mortal sy^ne / much grievous
and he ought to make restituco^n. If he has received the dystrybuco^ns
quotidie^nes of colle without their abiding / not wtstandynge y^ y^ ordinance
is such yt without he be present nothing he shall take or that he is gone unto
the office pryncypally for the distrybucyons temporalles it is deedly sy^ne If
he desire to have cures or benefyces more pryncypally for the good temporal
than spyrytuall it is mortal sin and symonye spyrytuall. If he has left by
fere / by favor / by love / by gifts / or by pro mysses for to show unto his
soueraynes the ylles and sins open yt he will not or may correct in his
subgectes he committed symonye after the ryghtes If he has left the goods
moeuable or vnmoeuable of chirch be they thing hallowed or other for because or
in manner yt they be not granted of right or also as with the goods of ye chirch
byed heritage forte give and to leave unto his kynnesmen or unto a another place
than to ye church he sy^ned grievously and ought to make restytucyon. If he
has suffered vten syles as lynen cloth or woollen / flesh / corn / and wine /
or other things noughty has been put in ye church without necessyte lefull and
suffycyent after ye ryghtes as is should be for fere of thieves or of the
enbrasynge fire ye which should be in the houses or other euydent necessyte^s
/ the which passed ye said things should be taken out of the church and
place hallowed / he sinned grievously in trespassynge y^ co^mau^ dement of the
pope Innocent the third / and in like wise all they ye which ben consenting
or y^ cause of such dishonor. Also commanded by express words of the same
pope / chirches / chapelles / chalyces corporaces / towelles / hallowed / awters
/ chesybles and other vestymentes and vessels ordained unto ye service of the
awtre be kept pure and clean. And it is well to be noted in this matter / as to
do wyttyngly that the which the pope defended or dispraysed to do yt yt he
commanded it is deedly sin. If he suffered that any plays provoking him
unto vanytees or noyses / turbacyons / great noy^es / or also drynkynges or
etynges to be done in the church or in other place hallowed he sinned
grievously. If he has found or given noualtees of relykes and them has
denou^ced unto the people for his auaryce pryncypally / or if he has
extorcyoned by cautell / or by fair langage / almesdede / or oblacyon it is
mortal sy^ne If he has received unto sepulture ecclesyastycall any person
exco^munycate by sentence of right / as usurers open or other / or those ye
which were denou^ced enterdyted in other manner than it is taken of right over
the sy^ne mortal he is exco^munycate in likewise as it apyred by ye
Clementyne. Also if he has received unto sepulture these ye which sees each
other in torments defended he sy^ned mortally If he be a concubynarye open and
known when it is so yt he of yt was lawfully vaynquysshed or yt he has yt
confessyd in Jugement / or yt his sin is so open and so euydent yt all they
of the parysshe or the more great party of them it knowed / or yt there be so
great perseuerau^ce yt noman ought to doubt he is suspende as unto himself /
and as unto other and if he say mass or admynyster other sa^rame^tes in such
estate he is irreguler after as says ^ostyense. And moreover some lawyers
holden yt in such case there may not be dyspence but alonely by ye auctoryte
of the holy syege apostolycall. And this opinion holden Richard de media villa
/ the Scotte John andrewe. Astence and Panorme alledgynge the chapter Cu^
^terni extra de sente^cia et re iudicat^ Also after y^ he is co^munycate namely
al those the which him know^^ synnen mortally in herynge his mass / but an
other thing it should be of an other sin the which is secret / for during
yt ye holy church it takes away a man sinned not mortally. Also it is to be
noted yt the concubyne of the priest suspende as unto himself and as unto other
and exco^munycate as it is said / renned in the sentence of ye great
exco^munycacyon. By the which it follows moreover yt such person may never
be assoyled sacramentally but in ye article of death if he be Hoc ^ba^ per dec^e

not first unbound of the said sentence. And so it ought to be understand of
the concubyne ye which perseuered with her rybaude exco^munycate by that cause
of fornycaco^n. If he has not borne ^onsure honest / if he has learned the
office of a lay man / or unto marchau^de in byenge for to selle again openly
and more derer therefore to gayns as a lay man may / if he has haunted
taue^nes / the plays of Joglyng / dau^ces with women. In all these cases may he
have so great and so excessyue sclau^der y^ it is mortal sin. Also if he
has song mass in leuynge wyttyngly any of the vestymentes unto that
requysyte / as is the coope / the aube / the many ple / the stole / the
chesyble / or without messall without light / or without clerk to answer it is
deedly sin for of yt he may not be excused by ignorance. If he has left his
matens canonycalles all or part unto his wyttynge without cause reasonable / as
it should be for syknes / or other necessyte it is deedly sy^ne after yt he is
subdeacon / and in like wise of the matens of our lady when they ben of ye
ordynary or of custom approved. But if he them has left by forgetfulness he
shall be holden to axe forgyuenes wha^ it unto hy^ is remembered. Also y^ he be
occupied wyttyngly in things outwardby ye which he has gretely distrayned to
understand his mateus / or if be put to think on an other thing unto his
wyttynge he there may have deedly sy^ne / an other thing it should be of
thought coming against ye will. If he has received holy ordres before ye age
co^petent yt is to know subdeacon before.xviij. years / deacon before.xx.
priest before.xxv. and it suffysed yt the.xxv. be bego^ne / or else it is
deedly sy^ne. And he ought not to excecute ye office aperteynynge unto ye order
till unto the time determined of right. If he have left any thing notable
aperteynyng unto ye form or matter of sacrament it is deedly sy^ne / if
wyttyngly or by neclygence he has committee such obmyssyon. Also after holy
Thomas he the which excercysed ye office of holy ordres in deedly he sy^ned
mortally as oftymes as he has touched ye things holy Also if he has
admynystred any of the holy sacraments unto sinners notorely known and open
before satysfaccyon and amendment competent it is deedly sin. If he has
song mass in deedly sin without him confessing and repenting duly if he
has place and oportunyte it is deedly sin If he has committed notable
reverence against ye sacraments / as putting no water in to the chalys or yt
the oost were broken / or ye wine aygre or sour or the holy oost evil kept /
or has left any thing notable by to much hastynge hy^ / or to sing for
other intencyon than holy church does intend / or has not borne reverently
with light the body of our lord unto syke folk. In all these things and many
other the which may come by neclygence he may have such exces that it is
mortal sin. Also if he has promised to say certain masses / and of yt
has received the alms / in intencyon not to say that that he has promised
it is deedly sin. Also if he has been neclygent him to prepayre and dyspose
for to sing at the least in the great festes and solempnytees / but has left
that to do / not pryncypally for the fere and reverence of the sacrament he
there may have deedly sin. Also if he has assoyled of the sentence
exco^munycacyons or in the caas and persons upon whom he has not power nor
auctoryte / or has made dyspense of vows / or if he has showed the sin of
the person the which he has herd in confession / or has enjoined penaunces
of alms the which by his inducynge comes unto his prouffyte temporal / or
has be notably indiscreet in assoylynge them the which weren indygne for as
much as they would not pardonne or require pardonne / or make restytucon after
as it was of reason or they would not leave any sin / or if he has inquired
malycyously of the name of the persons with whom they have sinned those the
which them confess^n unto him / or has done his devour to examen the deed of
the conscience of poor and simple sinners / or has not ben desirous it to
inquire of clerks and more expert than he was of the dyffycultees and
perplexitees the which often is found in the deed of the conscience / or has
assoyled in deedly sin and without true contrycyon. In all these cases
beforsayd there is commonly mortal sin. If he has broken ye vow of chastyte
the which he has done solemply over the pryncypall promysse made unto the
sacrament of baptem. That is to understand when he received the holy order of
subdeacon. Also when he received the holy order of deacon. And afterward in
receyuyng ye right holy and sacred order of presthode. And therefore the
trangressyon of such vow is horrible sacrylege dygne of eternal death. Also

he has known carnally his paryshens unto who me he has other times

he has holden in confyrmacyon / or also his godmoder / his kynneswoman / or
his affynyte / over the great and detestable sin mortal ben ordained diverse
pains after the ryghtes for such cases. Also if he has given benedyccyon

he admynystre any of the sacraments before that he there be remedyed over the
pain beforsayd he is irreguler / and in so berynge him unto the sacraments in
such estate he sinned always mortally. To nombre in partyculer all these
cases and the dyuersyte of sins the which may come unto bishops deanes /
chanons / curates / chapellayns and other people of the thirche and of relygyon
/ by cause of their dygnytees and offices evil kept it is a thing right hard
unto all lawyers and theologyens. But the holy scripture the which teched all
troth the which is necessary unto all salvation / it suffyseth well unto the
conscience of every man of the church the which him enforced to do that the
which is in him for to please god / and for to keep well and Justely the
degree and for to execute the office that god and holy church unto him has
committed.

Here follows of the defaute of Justyce in domynacyon seculer or temporal.
AS unto the.vij. point the which is of the seygnourye seculer it is to
understand yt kings / dukes / cou^tes / and all other degrees of seygnourye
should first take heed how they be comen unto the said seygnourye. That is to
understand if by right of lygne / or by other way of Justyce for than they
their may purchase salvation. But if they it holden by vsurpacyon / or tyra^nye
against right and Justyce they them dampnen / and they have no power there to
committee officers in any degree or auctoryte / but in so doing they sin
mortally and the officers in like wise in excecutynge their and other
oppressyons by force of armer / or otherwise ^^u^s david ^u^ deus ^a^ magnu^

in like as it was possible it is deedly sin. For for yt cause and service to
do unto ye commons they holden their seygnouryes / these rentes / these
trybutes. and these taxes. If he has Just title to make war but in y^
doing his affection is vnordynate by auaryce or other wise he there may have
deedly sin as well in him as in them the which executen the said war.
Wherefore it is to be noted as to do yt whereof any war may be made Justely it
behooved that he there have.vi. condy^^ons / that is to vndstande a good will
and desire to do Justyce with auctoryte of y^ to do and this is of the party of
the prince Also in them ye which executen the deed of ye said war ought to
be intencyon and condycyon. Intencyon not pryncypally for auaryce or for his
propre ve^geau^ce. Condycyon yt is to understand yt the person the which
makes such war be lay or seculer not clerk in holy ordres. Also in them
against whom a man makes war ought to have some gylte or defaute by the
which they have deserved to be punysshed / for without these.vi. causes war
may not be Just. Also it is to be noted yt these subgectes of princes the
which ben men of war be not bounden to have all knowledge if the war be
Just or unjust / but unto them it suffysed not to be certain that the war
yt they make by commandment be contrary unto reason and unto Justyce. If he
has suffered wyttyngly capytaynes or other officers that he knowed to be
pyllers and oppressors of the people he sinned mortally / and is holden with
all da^mages and oppressyons the which by defaute of correccyon ben felonyed.
If he has suffered and commanded homycydes / mutilacyons / flagellacyons / or
prison against right and Justyce / or not wtstandynge yt ye cause were Just he
it has done or made to be done pry^cypally by hate or vengeance it is deedly
sy^ne and much grievous. If he has made or suffered ^orneys duellaco^ns or ye
fight of two men plays or p^sentaco^ns y^ which of their condyco^n and
oftymes ben things noysau^tes to ye body and to ye soul which he might
defend and make to cesse it is mortal sin. If he have committee against ye
church caas wherefore a man hy^ may lawful suspende enterdyte or exco^munycate
/ and yt notwtstandynge he has made mass to be song in his presence in
sustaynynge y^ censures of holy church it is mortal sy^ne and much grievous.
If he has taken and commanded or approved yt clerk or person relygyous were
taken / beten or inprysoned in deed and not in right and without ye license and
Just permyssyon of the church over ye deedly sin he is exco^munycate. If he
has suffered laws or statutes in his seygnourye ye which weren co^traryous to
ye lybertees of holy church over ye mortal sin he is exco^munycate. Also in
like wise if with out license of the pope and concessyon Jurisdycall he has
committee and suffered to be put and imposed upon the people of the church the
which is not suffered of right / taxes / subsydyes / watches / serches or other
exaccyons / after he has admonycyon to cesse despised so to do over the
mortal sin he renned in the sentence of exco^munycacyon / if he him correct
not within the space of the time ordained in right that so for to do. And
also if by his crime the cite / the town / or the country / fallen in
enterdyte he is culpable of the cessacyon of all the good deeds which might be
done and had been done if it had not ben enterdyted. Also if for the censures
ecclesiastycalles done to hy^ or to his / after ye order of right he enda^maged
or gyued vexacyon unto Juges or mynystres of ye church over the mortal sin
he is exco^munycate. Also if he has received and suffered open usurers of an
other regyon to dwell and enhabyte in his seygnourye to use their vsuryes and
has put no dilygence them to expelle with in the time yt to do* is ordained ^e
is exco^munycate And in suffrynge them of his seygnourye to excercyse the said
vsuryes in gyuynge unto ye permyssyon or consenting it is mortal sin. Also
if he extorcyon or dystresse or gyued aid or consentyng that to do upon
marchau^des or pilgrims upon y^ see he is exco^munycate and y^ absolucyon
reserved to the pope. Also if he take and retain the goods of them y^ which
have had lettynge in torment perdycyon of their goods / and fraccyon and
brekynge of vessels and ships upon the sea he sinned deedly. As says
Astence yt no custom may him excuse. Also if he make to set on fire chirches
monasteryes or other holy places. Or if he do or make to be done wrongs
fraccyons without ye order of right and of Justyce over the mortal sin he is
exco^munycate and if he be denou^ced for such by ye dyocesayne the absoluco^n
is reserved unto ye pope. If he have let ye eleccyon of any to prelates
ecclesyastycall malycyously by fere / by vyolence / or by other cursyd means /
or also to procure yt any were chosen against the ly^^rtees and ordynau^ces of
right / or has given greef or vexaco^n unto college or unto any of them for as
much as men to hy^ has not obeyed in choosing after his will over ye mortal
sin he is exco^munycate. If he has broken and fyled y^ preuyleges of y^
church in making by vyolence to take any per sone in ye church or other
place preuylged without permyssyon of right he committed sacrylege mortal and
him may a man denounce exco^munycate aftr yt he has been warned duly to
repair ye forfayte. If he pylle ye people of the church or rauysshe things
the which aperteynen to ye church / or taked for to mark y^ people of the
church he sy^ned mortally. If he has presented as patron of ye church / or
has procured by other yt he y^ which was indygne after right were received to
benefyce ecclesyastycall it is mortal sin. If he have taken money gifts or
promysses for to present any unto benefyce of ye chirc^ or has written and made
supplycaco^n unto the pope or unto other prelate to benefyce any y^ which of
y^ was unworthy he is symonyacle and in mortal sin. If he has given aid
favor or defense to heretykes or scismatykes in asmoche yt they be such he is
exco^munycate. If he appropre things y^ which aperteynen to an other / or
let wyttyngly the preuyleges or lybertees of any it is mortal sy^ne. If he
have let by hy^ or by his officers y^ any cause Li. vi. de imunitate

were not drawn in ye court of the church / in like wise as it aperteyned of
right he is exco^munycate. If he has made or imposed nouelte of laws y^
which ben contraryous to right and to Justyce it is mortal sy^ne. I^ he be y^

that he received. And unto that purpose says Eusebius in the epistle of ye
death of saint Jerome that every person the which exceded in robes in yssues
or in other abylymentes worldely be it that the said exces be to praise it may
be so great and the affection so much vndrdyna^^ that it is mortal sin / to
determyne how much and how the said exces is mortal or venyall unto the
regard of any person in partyeuler it is a chyng right hard as unto Jugement
humayne. But as says a lawyer named Monaldus the blessed holy ghost teched
many times them the which ben dysposed that that may not do the subtylyte of
the entendeme^t or understanding humayne / for as much that it is he the
which teched all troth necessary unto salvation. Also says our lord in the
gospel unto the purpose of the horyble dampnacyon of him the which exceded in
abylymentes that he the^ which has two gowns is bound by the law of
charity for to give one unto him the which has none And it ought also to be
understood that he the which over suffysaunce has haboundaunce he ought for
to aid charitably unto chose the which ben nedy. Also ladies and gentyl women
or other women the which them appareyle to please men carnal and worldely and
to the intent that they them coueyten dysordynatly synnen mortally / and in
Justicia ^emota ^d su^t magna regna nisi magna latrocu^^a Aug. li. d^ ciuitate

like wise may it be spoken of men. By these things beforsayd apyred the
peril of those unto who me it aperteyned to yield keep and defend Justyce /
and of the great ylles the which may come by their defaute as well in them as
in their subgectes. And therefore says well saint Austyn that great seygnourye
is none other thing but great theftes and pyllers if Justyce reygne not and
govern. And for a conclusyon to put in this matter comes unto my purpose the
questyon the which saint Thomas made. That is to understand if he ye which
does any thing contraryous unto Justyce sinned mortally. The answer. For as
much as Justyce ordained these creatures the one against the other after that
it is of reason in yeldynge to every man that that unto him apperteyned / to do
the contrary wyttyngly it is against the charity of his neighbor / and by the
consequent mortal sin / and for as much as paradyse is promised unto Just
men / these unlawful and unjust dwellen in hell.

Here follows of Juges be they of the church or of secularyte.

the which have office and Jurysdyccyon to give sentences to make Jugementes.
It is to be noted that they should take heed ben they of the church or of the
secularyte unto the points folowen / If he be entered in the said office by
symonye / by fraud / or by vsurpacyon / for than he has none auctoryte to
Juge / but in so doing he sinned mortally If he have exceded wyttyngly ye
besynes of his commandment or of his Jurysdyccyon he sinned mortally / and
ignorance vycyous may not him excuse. If he by fere / by coueytyse / by love
dysordynate / or other cursyd cause he gives sentence against right and Justyce
wyttyngly / it is mortal sin / and is bound for to restore the party in
damage / in caas that he for whom he has been Juged will not restore him. If
by his ignorance vycyous he has given falls sentence / he ought to dysdammage
the party and ^ath sinned mortally. If he have been neclygent for to study and
to en quyre the troth for to yield and give lawful sentence by the which
neclygence he has Juged falsely it is mortal sin / and is holden unto the
party as before has been said. An other thing it should be of a Juge ouerseen
the which has done his devour for to have the counseyll of lawyers and
clerks / and that not withstanding has given falls sentence by symplenesse
and not unto his wyttynge nor by no malice. For obedyence against him the which
in that has been ouerseen / and the great dylygence that he has done for to
inquire the troth him may excuse before god. And this the which is said of
Jugement contencyons and in outward things may a man say of the Jugement of
the conscience the which is made in confession / for every confessor is Juge
ecclesyastycall and spyrytuall. I put that some will say that as well he the
which enioyneth the office of of the confessor as he the which it received
and is not suffycyent that for to do synnen mortally. But that should be
understand of those that auaryce and presumpcyon induced that to do and for
not of those that charity inclyned unto saluaco^n of souls. I put that after
good and holy intencion in receyuynge or in enioynynge the office he may have
so great dylygence to study or to inquire ye troth yt in gyuynge falls

should have mortal sin. If the cou^seyller of the Juge ye which Juged is
simple and of good will cou^seylled ylle by ignorance vicyous / or by other
malice y^ Juge may be excused in gyuyng falls sentence the which he byleued to
be good / but the cou^seyller sinned mortally in affermyng falsyte for veryte /
and so is holden to restore or to procure restytuco^n to be made unto the
party. But if it be very semblable unto the Juge that his cou^seyller is not
expert in laws or in customs / or has no reno^me of great Justyce they be
not excused y^ one ne the other of mortal sy^ne in gyuynge falls sentence not
wtstandynh y^ they believe yt it be good / and every of them is bound to
restytuco^n / not y^ double restytuco^n ought to be made to y^ party / but if
the one restore not y^ other is bound to restore If the Juge ordinarye take
money or other thing to yield Jugeme^t it is mortal sin and may come in
four manners. The first i. q. i. Jubemus
for to take money to Juge falsely and to repair such sin the thing the
which for such occasyon has been given aperteynen after ye ryghtes unto the
party which is hurt. Secondly to take money to Juge Justele and the moore

he Juge not falls. In all these four manners testytucyon ought for to be made
unto him the which has given or unto the poor after good counsel. and unto
the deed of conscience. If he has not wylled to do sentence notwithstanding
that he it may and should do it is mortal sin / and he is holden to restore
the party. If he were Juge ordynarye and has taken of the parties other
thing than vytayle the which was offered and given lyberally and moderatly /
he there may have auaryce / evil example / and mortal sin. But the Juge

after their labors and other consyderacyons of the matter subject. If the
Juge of the church give sentence of exco^munycacyon / of suspencyon / or of
enterdyte to lightly or without order of right / or pryncypally by hate / by
vengeance / by favor / or by other cursyd occasyon against Justyce and unto
the damage of an other over the mortal sin he is suspende of the execucyon
of his office / and he ought to be condampned after the estymacyon of the
da^made made unto the party / and if he in such estate mysbere him unto the
sacraments he renned in irregularyte / of the which he may not be releuyd but
by auctoryte of our holy fader the pope. If he has suffered wyttyngly to call
before him advocates the which weren heretykes / exco^munycate / or paynems.
If he has suffered and received dylacyons against the order of Justyce if he
has not kept the terms of right. If he have favored the one party unto the
greef and damage unto the other / if he has made questyons unto the culpable
yt weren impertynentes after the order of right / if he has refused to receive
appellaco^ns legittime^ / if he malycyously has given oportunyte for to call.
If after the legittime appellacyon he has proceeded in cause / if he has not
sought counsel sure and certain after as he it may and ought to do / if he
has received allegacyons scornful and impertynentes / if unto poor people as
wydowes / childern faderles and moderles / and miserable persons he has not
given comfort and prouysyon of counsel. In all these things and other
semblables he there may have mortal sy^ne. If he has not punysshed these
malefactors or ylle doers after as the right and the caas it required. In that
may he have gylte and sin in three manners. First for as much as that to do he
has not puysau^ce or co^myssyon of the prince / but all oonly has power to
Juge after the laws and customs. Secondely if in so doing he has done
wrong unto the party. Or thrydely if he have pardo^ned the caas the which
ought to be punysshed. For not withstanding that of that to do he has power
and that the party so should consent if he might he sinned mortally in
pardonynge the caas without punycyon. In like wise as says saint Thomas in his
quodlibetes / for in pardonynge the caas the which is unto the great sclaunder
of the people follows defaute of Justyce and of reparacyon unto the common well
/ if he has augmented and diminysshed malycyously the pain or punycyon ye
which was of right he there may have mortal sin. Also it is to be noted
that caas may happen yt he shall Juge ^or^^de and cito apparebit vobis q^^^

him yt he knows to be innocent / and in so doing he sinned not mortally. As
for example. A man proved and bears falls wytnes ayenstony in Jugeme^t of the
which falsyte ye Juge is right certain and so he may not by dylaco^n of
sentence nor by other mean persuade to the witnesses for to provide unto their
conscience. Nor may no^ also Justely y^ innocent ye which is falsely excused
without doing manyfeste Iniurye unto the witnesses. Also he may not constytute
or ordeyne lyuetenau^t / nor to ye sovereign when all these condycyons shall be
together and concurrentes he shall be constrained to give sentence after these
things alleged and approved falsely against him the which is innocent / and
in so doing by his office he sinned not but may have merit. And of that
opinion holds master Frau^ces de maronis / saint Thomas / and Richard de
villa noua. Some holden ye contrary affermynge yt the Juge should sooner
suffer death than to give such sentence. But I ne consent to ye first opinion
in the cause pecuniarie / and to y^ second in the cause of death or of
mutilaco^n. For as for to lose ye goods of fortune is oftyme to y^ great
prouffyte of the soul / but y^ holy scripture which may not lie forbydeth
symply the death of him ye which is innocent. In like wise as it appyred in
Exodi. By these things beforsayd of prelates of princes and of Juges appyred
the troth of the scripture ye which says that Jugement right meruayllos
shall be given unto them y^ which preceden. That is to understand if they
keep not ye lygne and the purete of Justyce and of equity / and therefore they
ought to fere and them humyle before god the Juge of Juges and hynge of kings.
and every creature as much y^ more as he has ye more great charity of
seygnourye and of Justyce. After as sayen these scryptures and holy doctrynes /
and of yt to do has given example the blessed sone of god the fader Jhesus
nazarenus ordynarye Juge of the deed and the quyke. And therefore when a man
would take him for to make and constytute him king he fled in to a mountain
to pray unto god the fader / but when man him sought for to Juge and to put
him unto death he him yielded and presented unto the town and unto the place
where he know well that men him should cause to deye. In like wise as he would
say by an example that much more Joyously should many receive the death than
prelacyon / office / benefyce / or seygnourye. By the occasyon of seygnourye
and of prelacyon comes many times unto them of such estate four ylles. In
like as it appyred by these scryptures. The first is pride and elacyon / by the
which proud men of good right be compared unto bestes. For of the thing
whereof he him should humyle / he him enhaunced and enpryded. The second ylle
is the occasyon Noli ^re^e fieri^uder nis^ valeas virtute irru^^e in^^rate^ ne
forte extune seat facie^ pote^t^^. eccl. vii. gre Hoc si hoi^es atte^^^r^^

of the more great dampnacyon / for as it is said before the Jugement of those
the which have had prelacyon shall be right strayte. The third is ^ in
receyuyng prelaco^n he hy^ byndeth to answer and to yield account of his
sins and of his subjects The fourth is the slander of his subjects the
which comes when ye Juge or the prelate gives not the correcco^n and
doctrine ye which aperteyned unto the office or seygnourye. And therefore says
well saint Gregory yt if these men reasonable known ye charge the which is ye
prelacyon they fere and never have appetyte it to receive / for as it apyred by
the figure the which is in the.xxv. chapter of ye book I^^tus d^^s dixit ad

of nombres. xxiiij. thousand men of the pryncypal les of the people of god
deyed in one day for the defaute of good presydentes and of good correccyon.
The which thing was fygured of all those which after the example and
doctrine of Jhesu christ presumed in pride and in abusing of their vocato^n /
in the which is reserved much cruel dampnacyon. But also by the contrary
those the which in fere and humylyte there do that the which unto them is
possible / after god and good order of Justyce they shall be right excellently
rewarded. And this suffysed as now of the holy estate of prelacyon.

Here follows of advocates / procurours / notaryes. ben they in ye court of
the church or of secularyte.
AS unto the.ix. point which is of these advocates sergcau^tes prentyses and
notaryes. It is to understand yt they should first take heed and specially
these advocates. If they ben of such co^dycyon yt the office for to be
advocate unto them be defended by right or by custom / as should those be yt
ben exco^munycate / heretykes / or religyous but for their monasterye and of
the commandment and license of their prelate. For such people the which
myshere them for to aduocacyer synnen gretely / and also done they ye which
unto yt them receyuen wyttyngly. If he be in holy ordres or in less with
benefyce it is to hy^ enterdyte ye aduocacyer in lay court except in his own
cause / or for his church / or in case of pity in ye cause of them yt ben
poor. Also the Juge may not aduocacyer in the cause yt he ought to Juge. Also
an advocate beuefyced in any church may not after ye right aduocacyer against
his church without it be for some the which should be of the said church / and
if h^ otherwise do to his wyttynge that may be mortal sin by reason of ye
contemnement. If advocate or procurour sustaynen wyttyngly cause unjust it is
mortal sy^ne and is holden to restore unto ye party all the damage the
which unto him comes by cause of that / or to induce the party yt he
sustained to restore in deed ryally. If he enterprise to sustain cause yt he
byleued somewhat to be good and Just / but in procedynge he it knowed to be
falls he ought incontinent to cesse not in showing the troth unto the party
aduersarye / but unto him for whom he has pleated in inducynge him to apoynte
with the party. For if by his counsel or aid the party is enda^maged or
leseth the cause ye which was good and Just he is holden to make restytuco^n
/ or to enduce hy^ of whom he sustained the cause yt to do. But during yt the
cause was doubtful a man it may sustain and pleate without sin. If in
pleatynge he hach committee falsy te as in producynge falls witnesses / or
consented yt to do / or has cou^seylled his party for to lie or to allege a
thing the which was falls / or is aided falsely of laws the which were not
to purpose / or also of probaco^ns be it in ye way of right or of de de. If he
has sought dylaco^ns and cauyllaco^ns again right / or for to give costs and
vexaco^ns to ye party in the cause ye which was not Just / if he has
appeled of Just sente^s wytty^gly. In all these case may he have mortal sin.
If he has been slothful to study / to sustain / and to keep ye good cause
by his defaute / and by sloth y^ party has been in damage he there may have
mortal sin and is bound to make restytuco^n. If he has showed enalycyously
ye secret of his party to ye party aduersarye / by yt which comes costs
and damages it is mortal sy^ne and ought to make restytuco^n. If he has lost
ye good cause by neclygence by unfaithfulness / or by his vycyous ignorance is
holden to restore all ye da^mages which by cause of yt comes to ye party. If
he see and know poor people which may not pursue and defend their good cause
/ for as much as they ben poor and sees yt none unto them gives socour ye
which thing he may well do / than he sinned mortally if he do not unto them
as he would yt a man did unto hy^ in caas semblable after the law of charity.
If he have taken excelsyue salarye he there may have mortal sin / the
salarye may be Juged excessyue or competent after the cause ye labor / the
faconde of the advocate / and also after ye custom of the contracte and may
make covenant of the price with hy^ the Aug xiiij. q. v Non sane.
which unto him took y^ cause before yt the cause is co^menced or after yt it
be fynyed. Not after yt it is co^menced and hanging in right so as sayen ye
ryghtes / and it is not lawful to make covenant that the advocate have the
tenneth or the hondreth or other party determined but all oonly of ye price

cause yt which he knows unjust may be won he sinned mortally / and if it
so happen he is bound to restore ye party as it is said of ye advocate. Also
if he be presented as sage and expert in the ryghtes and in the customs ye
which science he has not / by y^ which he has given counsel which has
borne damage unto the party / or if he has demanded price excessyue for to
give his counsel / or has not cou^seylled ye poor yt sees in necessyte be
it said as of the advocate. Also as unto these procurours yt is to vndstande if
he have procured wyttyngly in the false cause or by neclygence has let lose
the good if he has not given aid and comfort to the poor if he has been
excessyue in salarye be it said as of the advocate. Also as unto bayllyfes and
notaryes / if he has done treason in his office / as in falsefyenge a good
lettre / or not willing to show lettres certaynes or regystres / or has not
wylled to teache in like wise as he should / or has taught yt that he should
not / or has been ignorant to regestre or to endyte / by the which comes
often process and debates by the which the parties rennen in great da^mages /
or has been neclygent or slothful for to speed and yield his acts. In all
these things he there may have mortal sin and is holden to restore the
da^mages the which ben come by his defaute. If he has passed the testamentes
of those that were not in dysposycyon of power to make a testa meant / as ben
those the which have not the vsau^ce of reason or other lettynge lawful it is
mortal sin and is holden to dysda^mage the party. If he has not kept ye
solemnyte requysyte / as witnesses and of oaths and these other things the
which ben of right he breketh his oath and sy^ned mortally / and more over is
holden to restore ye da^mages that folowen. If he pass the testament of an
usurer or symonyacle he is forsworn and sinned mortally. If he be suffycyantly
waged in court or in co^munyte and yt not with standing he takes salarye of
the party / or if he be waged if he be excessyue in salarye / or writes on
the festes or holy days by auaryce to get and without necessyte suffycyante
he there may have mortal sin. If he has spoken or written statutes against
the lybertees of the church over the mortal sy^ne he is exco^munycate. If he
be notarye of the bishop and waged suffycyantly and yt not with standing he
takes salarye for these lettres of ordres he is symonyacle / and in like wise
in loss and gaynse in the money that the bishop takes by symonye If any
doctors in laws or in physyke has received in his scoles and lectures
wyttyngly relygyous or priests seculers or other clerks in office of dygnyte
of the church / as well he as the said scolers ben exco^munycate. Also what so
ever doctor yt received wyttyngly any relygyous yt which has not license of
his prclate is exco^munycate. Also if he has made paccyon to read by such
wise that a man unto hy^ shall give a chau^trye he is symonyacle / how be it a
man may ordeyne yt the chau^trye y^ which than should be vacant shall have
from now forth such charge that he the which shall have it shall be bound for
to read. Also if a man ensure or if a man promytte any price for license for to
read it is mortal sin / and their falled pryuaco^n of office and of
benefyce. How be it yt it is not proprely symonye after as says Hostience.
Also to take or to give money for license for to leave ye lecture in any day
of feast ye which is of ye commandment of the church it is symonye. If he
has wages or be nefyce suffycyent for to read and yt not with standing he takes
salarye it is symonye and is bound to restytuco^n / but if he have not salarye
suffycyent he may take salarye of his scolers by such wise yt he be suffycyent
in the faculte yt he enterprysed if he has received maystershyp and office to
read and he is not suffycyent. In that he there may have so great insuffysau^ce
yt it is mortal sin. And specially in the science and faculte of theologye
for the peril of souls. For a man putted faith in a doctor by reason of
degree and of office. And more over those the which him receyuen or Justely in
such degree or office ben cause of ye ylles which thereof may come he there
may have mortal sin. If he has appetyted ye degree and office to read by
ambyco^n or for auaryce or for other cursyd cause he there may have mortal
sy^ne. If he has taught scyences defended as nygroma^cy or other cursyd art
it is deedly sy^ne If he has been neclygent to instruct in science and good
manners his subjects or them has suffered to lead life unhonest and of sin
he there may have mortal sin. If he has not kept ye oaths of the
university. If he has been short in dysputaco^ns or has sustained co^clusyons
more by ambycyon tha^for to inquire the troth / if he has been proud in
abylymentes / if he has been swollen and vain and glorious for his science /
if he has been slothful to study / if he has been a waster of time and of
goods In all these things and many other as well the doctor as the scolers
may excede mortally. And therefore every man should study to know himself for
to correct him and amend / and it suffysed as now of the matter of the scolers.

Here follows of phisicye^s and many other vocaco^ns
AS unto the.x. point the which is of phisycyens / it is to understand yt the
physycyen may sin in many manners ye which folowen. If he be put to excercyse
the office whereof he has not the science. For it is unto the great peril of
the health or of the life of his neighbor. Also in being neclygent in the said
office. Also in gyuynge counsel for the health of the body the which is
contraryous unto the health of the soul. Also in not keeping by the
commandment of the church the which is such / that is that he ought to
show the syke person after the dysposycyon in the which he is to seche
pryncypally and first the medecyne spyrytuell. Also in not aydynge the poor
after the necessyte in the which he them sees and yt he it may and should do
after the law of charity. Also in geuynge medecyne indiscreet unto the great
adventure of death. In all these things and many other as should be in
auauntynge himself in dyspraysynge other of his vocacyon there he may have
such exces that it is mortal senne or so little yt it shall not be but
venyall. And like Jugement ought to be of potycaryes and also of those ye
which sellen with weyghtes or other mesure and ye which mixte and medlen their
stuf in doing there decepcyon and cursydnes and oftyme there falls
restytuco^n. If the tauerner or hosteler has done fraud and decepcyon in
geuynge one manner of wine for an other / or has put water in it and gyued to
vndstande the contrary / where there is a meddled thing ye which may be
noyous unto the health of them the which it drynked / or has made falls mesure
or has myscou^ted to his wyttynge / or has received wyttyngly rybaudes men
and women players of the dyce or of other game / or gyued his wine unto them yt
he sees well that they will be dro^ken / or also unto thieves or wasters or
blasphemers of god the which he may well put out of his house. In all these
things he may have mortal sin. And generally in all crafts and all
marchau^dyses in all estates and degree of every vocacyon of secularyte / or of
the church he may beat down cursyd auaryce in like wise as says holy
scripture / the which is none other thing but to love with out order those
things worldely and temporal. And for as much as it is impossyble unto
nature humayne to live in this world without love / all those the which love
not god soueraynly as it is said in the first commandment fallen necessaryly
in love dysordynate of things erthely and temporal. Of the which love also
as the lively fontayne pceden all these ryuers of symonye / ot usury of rauayne
/ of theeft / of frauds and decepcyons in diverse marchau^dyses / falls
pletynges / exaccyons pylleryes / and other diverse inuencyons y^ which better
semen to be deuylshe than humayns and without no^bre and with out mesure / of y^
which inco^uenynce and sins the soul may not be loused and repaired against
his creatoure if he return not from such love by true repentance and in
making restytucyon / of the which it follows here after.

Here follows of restytucyon necessary unto salvation of those the which
withholden from an other.
FOr as much as to restore an other it is necessary Caplm.xxij.
to y^ salvation of souls the which thing I seche and understand
pryncypally in all the process of this present book it behooved to say some
thing. And first it is to be noted yt to put out to take / to rauysshe / or to
wholde any thing again Non dimittit^ peccatu^ nisi restituat^ ^^latu^. Her
augus. ad macedon^u^. et habet^.ix. q. vi. i. ca
the good and Just will of hy^ to whom such thing aperteyned it is to do a
thing against charity and by the consequent mortal sin. For after y^ law
dyuyne and also of nature no man ought to do to his neighbor yt yt he would
not or will not unto him should be done. More over it is to be noted yt there
is three manner of goods / of y^ which some may be inda^maged / that is to
understand y^ goods of the soul as ben y^ graces and virtues spyrytuelles
and good renown. These other goods ben those of nature as health and beauty of
body. And the third goods be named y^ goods of fortune as ben goods erthely
and temporal / be it gold / silver / or other goods meouables or herytages.
And in every of these three manner of goods comes by defaute of reason and of
charity yt oftymes unto hy^ enda^maged ye other / by the which he behooved to
make restytucyon due or to be unjust before god / and by yt consequent
culpable of death eternal / for which death and da^pnaco^n to eshewe over these
things beforsayd as well in the viij. commandment as in the matter of vsurye
/ of symonye / and of diverse estates and vocaco^ns here before put / folowen
some caas of the said restytuco^n more in partyculer.

Here follows of restytuco^n of ye goods of ye soul
AS unto ye restytuco^n of ye goods of ye soul is first to be noted yt such
goods may not be lost but in geuynge them consentyngly to sy^ne And therefore
he ye which induced my person unto Deteriores su^t ^ vita^ moresque bono
(...) corripiu^t quam ^ ^dia aliorum substantia^que diripi^t.vi. q. i. ca. ex
merito. Qui occasione^ da^ni dat damnu^ dedisse videt^. extr^ de liu. ^ da^no
dato
sin in geuynge hy^ counsel commandment example or occasyon to sin / by
ye which he leseth the goods of y^ soul / is of as much the more bound to
restore as unto yt manner of damage of as much as y^ goods of the soul ben
more worth than those of the body or of the world. The manner of restytuco^n
ought to have conformyte to ye manner of ye da^mager / for if he has ylle
cou^seylled he ought it to revoke and to give good counsel. If he have given
evil example he ouggt to give good. Also he ought to pray for ye conuersaco^n
of ye person yt he has made to sin in reco^mau^dynge him or her unto god
and to these holy persons / for in such case a man has more sooner stryken
down than releued. And saint Austyn says yt he the which does not his
devour for to restore in y^ caas and in the manner beforsayd may not have
remyssyon. If he has dyffamed his neighbor in putting on hy^ crime which is
not true he it ought to revoke before y^ persons to whom he has told y^
said crime specially / if he believe yt by his words they be sclau^drers of y^
person to whom he has imposed y^ crime / and also yt he may do it
conuenyently. For in dyffamynge his neighbor by such manner he is much y^
more grievously enda^maged / as if he had lost myllyons of gold and of silver.
If he has spoken of an other the crime which was true / but yt
notwtstandynge it was secret he it ought to revoke not in saying yt he has
lied and spoken falsely / for than he lied unto his wyttynge y^ which thing
he shol de not do for to save y^ life of all those yt ben living / but he
should say yt he has ylle said and yt he it repented. And he ought to induce
those to whom he Melius est nome^ bonu^ quam diuitie ml ^e. prouer.xii. ca.
has spoken y^ dyffame of his neighbor not to believe it / by the which it
appyred enough yt this case here is never the less hard to repair well /
notwtstandynge yt the dyffame imposed is not true. If he have wtsayd or denied
any of that that he unto him imposed in any crime in open audyence the which
was true / but wtstandynge it was secret. Than he is the imposau^t knowing
of the crime of the sclau^dre the which is much great ylle and infamye /
such caas is right hard to repair / for both tweyne ben fallen in to
inco^uenyent / the one in imposynge openly their caas y^ which was secret and
that he might not prove / the other in again saying it the imposau^t knowing
that he is amys thynker. And saint Gregorye says yt notwtstandynge that he ye
which is accused openly of the thing which is secret he it may deny after
the manner that such caas unto him is imposed. How be it so he it ought to
confess and to make satysfaccyon / and so he ought to repair the honor of
the imposau^t unto his power not in auowynge that he has said troth / for a
man may well some time hold his peace of the troth / but not to tell a lie.
But he may and should speak seem words sobre and covered / as in besechynge
the herers that they be not evil dysposed or evil content of the imposau^t /
for he ymagyned to have power to prove crime that he imposed. And for to
abredge this matter it suffysed as now / for these great and subtyle doctors
with great pain and dyffyculte determynen the matter of the miserable sin of
falls and enuyous langage. But many confessors taken but little head and
therefore they put not the remedy and the restytucyon the which is necessary
and that proceeded of their ignorance and of the sin of detraccyon the which
is at this day to much common. And therefore says well the holy scripture that
by the sin of falls langage almoost all the world perysshed / for with great
pain and also as of the lest part of that is made true restytucyon. These
things beforsayd should be understand of crime the which is a great mortal
sin / for if any man has despised his neighbor by the which he might be
the less praised / he him ought to praise and honor dyscretly as well against
him as against other. And this may suffyse for to repair the dyspysynge that he
unto him has do ne before.

Here follows of the restytucyon of goods as unto the body.
AS unto the restytucyon of the goods of nature is to be noted that some may
be enda^mage in his body in three manners. The first is when a man takes from
him his life. The second when a man takes from him any or many of his members.
The third is in betynge him and hurtynge without sleynge him or without depryuynge
hy^ from the usage of his members. Restytucyon for the death of any person may
not be found more sure or more certaynet han yt the which is ordained and
taxed of god in these holy scryptures as well of the ancient testament as of
the new. That is to understand he the which has done homycyde receive in
gree and inpacyence the death the which unto hy^ shall be given by Justyce. But
if such penance O^s ^ gladia^ acceperint. gladio pe^ibu^t Math. xxvi. ca.
unto hy^ be not given / or for as much yt the deed is secret / or for as
much yt he asks his grace of the prince the which unto him it may do and
give. The most certain penance after that beforsayd shall be yt he amend
his life in desiring to deye for the faith commonly against these myscreau^tes /
by such dyscrecyon evermore yt he slay not himself / or cause to be slain
unto his wyttynge. For if he so should do he should be the sleer of himself.
And in caas that he take not such penance as it is said / that in geuynge life
for life never may he all holy be acquyte in this world / as unto the pain
deyte But well against god as unto the regard of ye gylte and not for to be
finally dampened. And if the person were slain of such condycyon that he
sustained and nourysshed fader and mother or childern or other household / the
mother is holden if unto him it be possible them to sustain and mary the
daughters and supplye as unto that all other charges that the person slayn^
sustained after that it is well possible in such ca^s. In this dyffyculte of
restytucyon appyred the little oyscrecyon of many confessors the which
oftymes assoylen more lightly for the death of a man than they should do for the
death of an hou^de or other be in likewise as declared the Scotte in the.xv.
dystynccyon of his quart. And than for as much that with great pain may he bear
so great charge / it is there expedyent unto salvation to take the death in gree
after the ordinance of Justyce. Restytucyon for the mayme of any person ought
to be done after the exces of the said mayme the which is so named / for as
much as ye person maimed leseth all holy the usage of some or of many of his
members. Also in such Extra de iniurii^ and da^no dato. ca. ^.
restytucyon a man ought to consydre the state of person enda^maged / for the
poor labourer the which by that has lost his hand should have more great
harm than should a man gretely rich. Also if he lie in bed the stryker
ought for to pay the Journeys of the surgyne with these other necessytees so as
sayen the ryghtes / or else the restytucyon is not suffycyent.

Here folowith the restytucyon for these things temporelles.
AS unto y^ restytuco^n for these things temporelles / it Non furtu^ facies

is to be noted yt in like wise as to take from an other malycyously it is
deedly sy^ne and transgressyon of ye commandment of god. In like wise to
wholde from an other against ye good and ordynate will of hy^ to whom ye thing
apperteyned it is mortal sin. By the which it follows yt during the wyle
in such wise to retain from an other there is no power in heaven nor in earth
ye which him may assoyle / for ye commandments of god may not be changed
or varyed by dyspensacyon or other wise / by the which more over it appyred yt
it is truly said and of good right. Yield or hang where the death of hell
shall abide. In this matter of restytucyon ye which is much necessary ben to
see and to note four things by order. The first is which is he that ought to
restore The second is what thing he ought to restore. The third is to whom
he should restore. The fourth is when a man ought to restore.

Here follows of him ye which ought to restore
AS unto the first is to vndstande not alonely Versus. Iussi^ ^siliu^ ^sensus
palpo recurs'. Par ic^^a^s mutus n^ obstans no^ manifestans.
he ye which has taken from the other against reason and Justyce is holden to
restore / but with yt many other manner of persons as he ye which gave
commandment that to do / and without the which commandment y^ taking had
not be done. Also if he has given counsel / comfort / aid / defense / or if
he has hydden y^ thing taken / stolen / or rauyshed with these malefactors /
or yt he has taken gayns or part unto the said theeft he is holden to
restore. Also if he should prohybyte and may defend by the auctoryte of his
office / as these lords and prelates to the regard of their subjects or
their offyeers / or he the which should be lawfully required to say the trouh
of the theeft ^ will not it confess. All these condycyons of persons be named
flaterers and consenters / and every of them is holden to make hole
restytucyon / by such wise yt if they were many and one restored all holy they
ben all acquyted against hy^ unto whom ye damage has been done / as in regard
to make restytuco^n / but every of them is bound unto hy^ the which them has
acquyted of the porcyon the which unto him may apperteynen.

Here follows what thing ought to be restored
AS unto the second point ye which is what Si videas futem currebas cu^ co et
cu^ adulteris portione^ tua^ ponebas hec fecisti and tacui. etc. p^s. xlix.
thing ought to be restored / it is to be vndstande that if the thing stolen
is of such condycyon that it may bear fruit as is land / or beestes / it
ought to be restored with the fruytes over the da^mages and other parts that
might have run unto him unto whom the said thing apperteyned An other
thing it should be to have purchased he rytages or possessions with silver
stolen / for it shall suffyse to restore the sum of money with the da^mages
Justely esteemed that he might have run in damage.

Here follows to whom he ought to make restytucyon.
AS unto y^ third it is unto whom restytucyon Sa^ctus tho. i suo q^^to dicit
que qn^ e^ i certus dn^s rerum abla ^^rum cu^c pauperessu^t heredes. Ite scotus
Ubi ler diuina vl ^^ct^astica fi ligat persona^ sequenda e^ ^aturalis ro^. ro^
au (...) dictat que persona q^ tenet faciat per se ^ exclude^do consiliu^ ^om
viti. hec ille.
ought to be made / it is to vndstande y^ after right and reason it ought to be
made unto him the which has been endamaged or unto his next enherytours if he
were decessy^ or if such restytucyon should be made so long yt the dyspenses
should amou^te more or as much as y^ thing stolen unto whom he would go for
to seche ye places and the per^ones / or yt a man knows not to whom to
restore / than a man should give to y^ poor ye thing or the value the which
ought to be restored for the spyrytuell wealth as well o^ y^ quycke as of them
yt ben deed unto whom might apperteyne the said restytucyon. Some has wylled
to say yt the restytucyon of such things to the party incertayne / ought to
be made by the ordinance of prelates or other Justycyers. But saint Thomas and
the Scotte sayen that it is not of necessyte but it may be done by the good
dyscrecyon of him ye which is bound to restore / be it by himself or by
other. Also it is to be noted that if any stele from a thief the thing that he
has stolen a man it should restore unto hy^ unto whom it apperteyned of right
or ye which it wtholdeth under ye form of priest or of gage.

Here follows wha^ a man ought to make restytu^o^n
AS unto the fourth the which is to know when a man is holden to restore / it
is to understand that it is not lawful to reteyne from an other hour ne
moment when he unto whom he ought to make restytucyon would Justely that yt
said restytucyon unto him be made / and allo y^ the withholder has place /
time and space / and puyssau^ce that to do / for it shall be well lawful for
some circu^staunces to dyfferre to make restytucyon / as when he unto whom it
ought to be made would or should will after good reason that it be dyfferred /
or for as much that it should be unto the great preiudyce of the comen well.
As for example. He the which should be in the war and in the service of the
king the which has dystressed any lawful marchaunde of the so^me of an
hundred crowns the which may not be restored without selling horse and
harneys of arms / by the which it shall be vnprouffytable unto the welthe of
the common people / and that restytucyon may be occasyon of right great ylle in
all the royalme. For by the defaute of one nail a man leseth a shoe / by a
shoe an horse / by an horse a man / by a man a bataylle / by a bataylle a
royalme. By the which it appyreth that the marchaunde should more love that
restytucyon were dyfferred for the great common wealth than his own will were
accomplysshed for his little wealth partyculer. And therefore in such caas and
other semblable he may well dyfferre restytucyon with purpose to restore in
place and in time. Also restytucyon may sometime be unto the great peril and
damage of him unto whom it is done / as the glayne to a man at the hour that
by fury he would kylle an other. Also some may be of such condycyon that if he
restored upon ye hour he should run in great shame or in great damage / and
he unto whom he should make restytucyon nothing or little of profit should
have. By ye which it appyred yt after charity and reason he ought to attend
place / time / and oportunyte in that that restytucyon unto him be made after
good charity and reason in like wise as it apperteyned. By these things
beforsayd appyred enough yt if the thing wtholden has been taken secretly it
ought to be yield secretly / and as unto him ye which has no power to restore
unto him it suffysed unto salvation to have dyspleasure of the caas with
purpose to yield as many times and often as he shall have oportunyte as it is
said / and he may reteyne his necessyte corporell / as of drink and of meet
and of cloth not to live delycyously / or to hold great estate and
habou^dau^ce of an other man's goods. If any were in extreme necessyte / by
the which he should take any thing fruytefully for to aid him in such
necessyte / he shall not be holden to yield it / notwtstandynge that afterward
he has well the power / but if he has taken before such necessyte in the
which he falls afterward during the time of that necessyte he shall not be
holden to restore / but afterward if he have power than he shall be bound to
restore. If a woman married conceive of an other than of her husbonde y^ caas is
strong to remedy and of yt may come great ylle and damage / as well unto the
husbonde as to ye very enherytours / by ye which it follows that the woman may
not recover salvation if she make not restytucyon. But of y^ manner many great
theologyens and lawyers it determen dyuersely. The Scotte is of the opinion
that such woman is not holden to declare herself neither unto her child but
it ought to show dyscretly / be it sone or daughter for to put him in the
estate of the church / and to leave the heritage unto other / or if she may not
unto that come and that she be rich of meouables and of herytages she ought
with out her to declare b^ testament or other wise to recompense as much the
husbonde the which has had the charge of the auoutrye as also the enherytours
after as she may goodly. Raymonde says that if it were very semblable that
such infant fered and loved god and were persuasyble the mother might make
such process / that is to understand that before her confessor / the mother
and the child now having age and dyscrecyon them should present / and that
that the confessor make the child to swear that he shall hold secret the
thing that he unto him will declare unto the prouffyte of his soul. Also to
make the mother to swear that she shall say without any malice the troth. And
than these things done y^ said mod may well swear if she be well certain yt
the said infant is not of her husbonde / ye which thing always y^ said
infant is not bound to believe in such manner yt by that he is bound to
forsake his heritage. But if he it believe and he it forsake he does well and
merytoryously. Other has wylled to say that if the woman and the husbonde
were of such condycyons that she were also as gouernouresse and that unto hy^
were very semblable yt she him should pacyfye than for the surete of conscience
she it might declare and manyfeste / and more over to remedy y^ caas for the
best yt it should be possible. By these things before said appyred as to give
true and sure remedy in that caas it is a thing right hard considering the
varyaco^ns of ye circu^staunces and the diverse condycyons of the persons.
Appyred also ye horrybyly te of ye sin of the brekynge of marriage and ye
great theeft and dampnaco^n of many^ybaudes men and women. If any let and
draws back an other to enter in to good relygyon approved without Just cause
and reasonable he sinned mortally. If he do any vyolence to the person late
entered in to religyon over the mortal sin he is exco^munycate and so is
bound to enduce that person that he has withdrawn and myscou^seylled / or
other to enter in the said relygyon and in caas that he may not make such
induccyon / he there should enter himself / if he have not lettynge suffycyent
lawful / for else he makes not restytucyon suffycyent unto relygyon. If he
have let any to come unto benefyce of the church unto marriage / unto the
purchase of heritage / or of other thing / and he that do pryncypally for to
anoye him / or pryncypally for his synguler prouffyte and with yt in awaytynge to
anoye an other / by such condyco^n yt he has not done ye said lettynge but
for to anoye an other he is bound to restore after the arbytracyon of people
of reason and of good conscience. But if he have let an other not by
intencyon and will to anoye him / but for the prouffyte of him / or of his / he
is not in nothy^ge holden to restore / for every man may procure his prouffyte
by ways and means lawful and honest / notwithstondynge by the occasyon of
that comes some lettynge in damage unto his neygh / bour / if he has stolen
a little hog of any little valor from the hour that he him takes and
afterward him nouryssheth till unto the valor of any great sum he is not
holden in deed of conscience for to restore but only unto the valor of the
best at the time that he him took / And alyke thing it should be of a colte /
or other beestes / or to have helyd or nourysshed or else to better the thing
stolen / or rauysshed / and by the thing contrary if the thing stolen be
impeyred / he ought it to repair and so is holden of the da^mages the which
may be comen unto him unto whom aperteyneth the thing stolen / for by cause
of the said theft. / ^ Also if such thing stolen perysshe by fortune or else
if it abide always he the which has stolen is bound if he has not done his
deuoyre to offer restytucyon before that the thing perysshe. The which
restytucyon he that is enda^maged has not will it to receive / if he has
boughte wyttyngly the thing stolen / or rauysshed the which other wise
aperteyneth not unto the seller / and has intencyon to bye it and retain /
for him self / over the mortal sin he is holden it to restore unto him unto
whom apertayneth the thing so bought / or unto the inherytours / or unto the
poor as it has been said before without power to repute the pryse that he has
given / but only unto him the which him has made such sale. Also more over
he is holden to keep harmeles and warande him unto whom appertains the
thing stolen where so ever that he become / but if he it boughte in good
intencyon / that is to know for to yield it / and unto that / that it were not
all lost / he there may Justly repute the sum given or yield alonely the
surplus that it may be worth / and if he can not find him unto whom such
thing appertyneth / yt so^me of the surplus ought to be given unto the pore.
but if he has bought thing the which has been stolen / the which he
byleueth to be of loyalte he is not holden it to restore till unto that / that
he be certefyed of the troth / but after that he is duly certefyed / than he
is holden it to restore / and that during the time that he byleueth that the
thing was of loyalte it peryssheth or were consumed in part or in all / he is
bound to restore alonely the party with the fruytes that he has in time that
he byleued that the thing was sold truly Also they that eten and drynken of
the raven of the theft be^holden to restore unto the estymacyon that they have
taken / except those the which ben in great necessyte / and unto whom it may
be very semblable that it shall please well those unto whom ye said thing
rauysshed or stolen appertains / as it should be prechers / or other the
which entende to enduce these theuys to amendment and unto restytucyon also
the wise y^ children / and the servants of those the which have all their
goods of theft / as is that of usury / of symony / or of raven ben holde^ to
restore after the valor y^ that they may have of the said theft be it in
drink / meet / to hose / to cloth / or otherwise / but only in as much as
they have labored and take pain by ammonycion or other wise that restytucyon
were made unto the party Also if with the goods the which were evil gotten /
there has some the which were truly gotten / they may adresse their intencyon
to live of those goods / and not of the theft / or they may live with their
labor / or they should demand prouysyon of Justyce / and if they may not
live by any of the ways before said they should more sooner demand alms
than to live of theft / but alonely in the case of extreme necessyte. Also
ignorance may excuse as much the persons before said / as also ye poor the
which receyuen and demau^den alms / Si ^d inuenisti et no^ ^eddidisti

Also if he have found any thing the which appertains unto a another / he
co^mytteth theft in it reteynyug^ ^heuysshely again reason / and again the
good will ordained of him unto whom such thing may appertain / and therefore
if he know not unto whom it appertains. he it ought to make to be cried in
open places / and if the party be not found after the taryenge suffycyent /
it ought to be departed unto the poor by good dyscrecyon And y^ fynder may
abide by long time with good and prompte conscience it to restore as oftymes
and as many as the party shall be found / another thing it shall be of
things found the which has not other times be in the possessyon and
domynacyon of any person for than he that fyndeth may retain in any place
where as if it should be old and ancient tresours found in ye heritage of
another For after the law cyuyle the half apertayneth unto the lord of the
heritage and the other part unto him the which has found it. And unto that

purpose it seems to besayd in the parable of the euangelyste that if any
find a tresoure in a field he goth and byeth the well of the heritage / in the
which the tresoure is hid / and than he is lord of the tresoure as well by
the reason that he it found as by reason of the possessyon of the heritage. /
Also the fynder may be so poor that he may after the good counseyll of his
prelate or confessor retain the thing found specially when he knows not
unto whom to restore it / Also the thing found may be of so little valor
that a man ought not to form conscience of it to restore. but when the will
shall be such that a man shall take wylfully a more great thing / or that
such little thing a man byleueth to do injury and dysplesure unto him unto
whom it appertains / than he there may have mortal sy^ne / were it for a
thorn / for a nedyll / or for a another little thing / for his will is more
weyed before god / than is the work outward / if he has taken theuysshly of
y^ gods of him the which unto him owes any sum till unto the price of the
debt / or less after good conscience / considering more over that he can not
well pay him without plee or other lettynge / the manner of that to do / it is
ill and sin / for by the fere of god and pacyence in his damage he may
purchase great merit. But nevertheless in such case he is not holden and
bound to restore him / and more over some sayen that if for such manner of
taking theuysshely the sentence of excomunycate were cast / he the which
has taken as it is said / is not acursyd / for holy church intends not to
bind by such sentence / but those the which witholdeth fro another again
reason / and malycyously The which thing does not he the which is paid as
it is said / notwithstondynge that after the law ciuyle he should be culpable
/ and punysshed / how be it it follows not that he falls in the said
sentence / and he should take heed unto whom such case should come / that he
give not in that doing sclaunder or evil example unto his neighbors / if he
be an offycer and he take gifts / or seruyces for to do pleser unto any / unto
the preiudyce of Justyce and to the damage of another / it is deedly sin.
Also if by thretenynges or otherwise / he extorcyoneth gifts promysses /
Journeys. or other thing notable he ought it to restore / how be it for his
pain / or some pleasure done resonably he may receive that / that he unto him
shall give lyberally / These lords of the chirch / or of secularyte may
receive the amends / after yt they ben taxed in their courts / be it by right
or by good custom / so that it be not done by hate / or by couetyse / or by
other cursyd occasyon / and it is good counseyll to depart such amends /
unto the power special when the amends surmonteth the damage / if he has
vsyd wyttyngly of a thing lent over the terms and will of the lener / he
synneth mortally and is holden to make satysfaccyon / if the thing lent
impeyre / or is all lost / he is holden it for to restore / if that he has
lent wyttyngly any thing / As a tonne that is musty to put in wine / or an
horse / another thing / by the which comes damage unto him the which
borrowed / The lener is holden to keep him harmeles. Also he the which is hired
for to win in Journey to do any work / as he ye which undertakes to carye
to^nes of wine / or voweth to do other thing / he is holden to restore the da^
/ mages the which comes unto the said work by his defaute and notellys / if
he have taken to keep any thing he it ought to yield except some case / The
first when it shall be yield unto the great ill or damage of him unto whom a
man should yield / as it should be to yield the glayue unto a man furyous / The
second when a thief has given to keep his theft / a man it should yield more
sooner unto the very lord. The third when the gyuer it should forfayte by the
which his goods should be in like wise forfayte / In a another manner he y^
which takes it to keep / ought it to restore how be it that the thing
perysshe or were loss by his defaute / or by case of fortune / if he take
salarye for the keeping / or if he were unto that bound or for that / that he
yield it not at the term that he should yield it / and for a rule general in
this matter / it is to understand that the thing lent put in keeping or hired
/ abide unto the peril of him the which it gives / if it be not by bergayne
made between the gyuer and the receyuer / or for the gylte and the defaute of
him the which it receives or for his long abiding. And also every man is
holden for to restore that / that he has received by bequeste / or by any
play / of those the which has lost their wits natural / or that been
wasters / chyldern faderles and moderles and young folk / under the years
of.xxv. or the which were in fra^nesye / or dcef / do^me / blind / or in
syknes perpetual for all these before said be not proprely lords / of their
goods by manner that they them may alyen without the ordinance of them unto
whom it appertains ordenarely / and in like wise the seruy tour / the child
the which is in the household and governance of his fader / the woman married
/ the monk / and he the which has the admynystracyon of the goods of the
church / as those y^ which have the rentes and benefyces of the church. /
All these manner of people may not Justely alyen the goods in the which they
ben subjects to their souerayns / again the Just will and reasonable of them
be it of the master / of the good man of the house / of the husbonde / of the
abbot / or of the pope And these the which wyttyngly receyuen unduly of such
manner of persons / ben holden to make restytucyon. Also all those that wynnen
in plays of the dyse / or the cardys ben holden for to restore / when by
cursyd couetyse / by frauds / by force / or by Importunyte they have enducyd
their party to play / or that they have made decepcyon in the manner of play
/ another thing it should be to play fordysporte / or for recreacyon in
plays honest and not defended for some little things after the condycyons of
the persons / as for the dinner / or for y^ souper among lords or rich
people the which attend more the dysporte and recreacyon / than they do the
gayns or y^ loss / for in such case there shall not fall no restytucyon I put
that he there may have there venyall sin. Also it is to be noted that pyllers
and rauysshars of goods the which pyllers ben known and publysshed / the
which has been warnyd duly it to restore / and they have no will it to do when
they should / and may if in such estate they comen unto the death / and than
they would well make restytucyon but they may not nor should not be buried in
hallowed ground / notwithstondynge that they have been assoyled / and received
the body of our lord. Also those the which receyuen gifts and known well
that they done more by fere than for love / or the gyuers ben deceived in
wenynge to give unto one / and they given unto another / as if any by
mysthynkynge or fyccyon / him calls the kynnysman of any / or affermeth to be
poor / and indygent and is not so / as ben many trewandes and dronken beggars
the which oftymes demaunden alms / and it receyuen of many the which ben
more nedy than they ben. Also such manner of people ben holden to make
restytucyon / for the gyuers ben constrained for fere of more loss / or
deceived by ignorance. By the which it follows that that the which they
given / is not proprely given / for every gift ought to proceed pryncypally
from the fontayne of love. Also these the which maken / and edefyen waremes
douue houses unto the great damage / and preiudyce of his neighbor / and will
not repair y^ damage y^ which follows synnen mortally / Of weremes and
douue houses ancient some sayen that when it is very se^blable yt they which
keep heritage ner hest and neighbors they ben cast under in that for as much
as they holden their herytages of less price or for other good cause. Than the
lords of these douue hours / and of these waremes / be not holde^ them to
restore. Also those the which holden and nourysshe bestes noyous / as should
be a wulfe / a bear / or a dog the which byteth ye people / or estrangleth
any fame beestes or an ox the which stryketh with his horns / ben holden to
repair the da^mages the which the said bestes done. Also those the which by
huntynges enda^magen gretely corns / grass / or other labourages / in
brekynge hedges / closynges again the will of the laborers ben holden it to
repair / And those the which without necessyte lefull or suffycyent / leven

of holy church co^mytten sacrylege and ben holden to restore / for the said
goods be not unto them otherwise than it is said / and for to admynystre them
in works of charity and of pity. And it is well to be noted yt the restytucyon

should be of another / But if they the which ben fallen in to such
inco^uenyent have patrymonye in secularyte or dyspose them to win by other
manner / they may them acquyte of the goods the which unto them shall come of
the other party / as of y^ church / or he ought to restrain till unto the
valor of that / the which ought to be restored of the thing the which unto
them was well lauwfull to take / for them in pita^ce and in vestymens if they
were not fallen into y^ said inconuenyent / more over sayen the right that
those the which have patrymonye in secularyte may well have patrymoneye in yt
holy church not for to do with it their propre will / but alonely for to
depart them unto the poor / Also folysshe women rich / Also iogelers the
which have received unduly as it is said the goods of holy church / ben
holden them to restore / not unto the person of the church / the which them
has given / but unto the prouffyte of that church y^ which by that was
endammaged / or else they ben sacryleges. Also those the which receyuen the
goods of holy chirch without there doing the seruyse the which apperteyneth
/ be holden to restore. for these goods temporal ben given for them the
which done the service dyuyne in holy church. And therefore says ye holy
scripture / That the which labors not Qui non laborat no^ ^^^ducet Labores

interpretacyon confusyon the which was never so great in the transgressyon
publysshed and manyfested of holy dyuynys commandments / and by the
consequent / the dampnacyon of souls and specially by cursyd auaryce and of
defaute of correccyon and of parfyte restytucyon / for as men sayen comenly him
behooves to yield / or to hang / or the death of hell to abide.

Here follows of the.viii. commandment.
OVer these things before said in the.viii. commandment the sinner ought to
take heed unto these points that folowen. The first is of the sinner lyenge.
The second is of detraccyon. The third is of adulacyon. The fourth is of
pariurynge / As unto the first it is to understand that there ben three manner
of lyenges as to speak generally. Me^daciu^ triplex est pernisiosu^ ^ocosu^
offici. sum.
The first is yt the which beryth noysau^ce unto any personel / and is
always mortal sy^ne when a man does it wyttyngly for such an ente^te and is
committee in three manners / of the which the first is ill / The second is wors
/ The third is worste of all. The first is the lie by the which a man does
noysau^ce unto one / and does prouffyte unto another / The second is that by
the which a man does noysaunce unto another without prouffytynge another. The
third manner is that y^ which is contrary unto the holy faith catholyque / as
ben herytykes the which sown errors and falls doctrynes sometime for to come
unto their lecheryes / as those the which affermynge that simple fornycacyon
is not mortal sin / or that the sin of lechery is not so great / or so
grievous In like wise as says these holyscryptures / and these prechers / the
which it co^dampnen / sometime such is commytte by such lyenge couetyse / As
ben those the which prechen unto ye sy^ple people as for to give some silver /
or other thing temporal in taking their indulgencis they purchasen their
absoluco^n a pena et aculpa in hydynge from them the truth / and geuynge them
to understand that by the virtue of the indulgence he is pardonned a pena and
aculpa the which thing is false / for the virtue of these indulgences may not
be understand / but unto the pain temporal / of those the which ben in the
estate of grace and by the co^sequent without the gylte of mortal sin / and
of such prechers there ben at this day without nombre thorowout crystyente /
after as the glorious saint Petyr has lately prenounced. The second manner of
lyenge is that the which is done by dysporte / and is commytte in two manners.
The first by dysordynate pleasure that a man takes in tryfylles and
talkynges. The second by a desired dysordynate / and to please the herers
rehersynge fables / or dysportes and in these two manners may he have mortal
sin / or venyall / after the cyrcumstaunces of the dysordenaunce and of the
matter of which a man speaks / or of the persons of the which a man speaks
/ or unto whom such lies ben told. The third manner of lyenges is that by
the which a man prouffyteth unto any person in saving him his goods
temporal / as gold silver or other thing / or to chastyse his body / or his
life corporal. and it is to be noted yt for asmoche as to lie it is to say
some thing / and to believe / or understand yt it is not so as a man says and
affermeth / it is impossyble to lie wytty^gly in any manner without mortal sin
or venyall / the which thing he should not do for to save all those yt ben
living. A man may some time hyde the troth / but not to lie without great
sin / to say false for dysportynge or for to prouffyte unto any person
without noysau^ce unto another it may be venyall sin in lay people and
seculers. But with great pain is lyenge in people of perfeccyon without mortal
sin / as says Bonauenture and fra^coys de maro^nes upon ye third of y^
sentences / of the which the reason is asmoche for sclandre of their
ne^ghbours / as for the perfeccyon of the estate of relegyon / by the which
right desyrously every relegyous ought to keep him from the telling of
lesynges / if it unto him be very semblable yt in so doing he gives evil
example / and matter of sclandre / specially unto people feeble and sellers the
which lightly maken of a little occasyon their evil prouffyte / another
thing it is to go a back with any fable. The which as well in the intencyon
of the saying as in the manner / and unto the purpose to speak it seems well to
be rehercyd for a fable / for in such manner of lyenge is not proprely to lie /
for as to lie it is to speak again his conscience in gyuynge falsely to
understand unto the herers / and in the recytacyon of suthe fables where the
speker wylleth for such to be understand it is not mortal sin after ^aynt
Thomas /. master Alexandre and the Scot. Also in another In quolibetis.
place says saint Thomas that a man may lie mortally / as well by writing by
abylemens by tokenes and by operacyon. as a man does in words For a man that
is do^me may well sin mortally in his manner to lie / Also lyenge is
pryncypally in speech / In like wise symulacyon and fyccyon ben in operacyons /
Ypocresye is one manner of symulacyon Simulata sa^titas duplex e^ i^tquitas hie.
and an. sup ip^m. Eraudi deus oracione^ mea^ cu^ de. Simulata e^tas no^ e^
duplex i^^^tas Sumulatores et ^alidi prouoca^t ira and dei. job. xxxvi.
but all symulacyon is not ypocresye / as to kneel / to join the hands / to
stryke his breast in token of devotion / the which is not in the person / but
the deed for some evil end / as for to be hired and preysed for to come unto
office / or unto benefyce / of the which he is not worthy / it is mortal
sin / after the Sootte and saint Thomas. speech in paraboles or by
symylytudes / as to say one thing for to give to understand unto a another it
is not of him the lie or sin / for our lord the which may not lie nor sin
feigned before his dyscyples / that would go forth from thens in fygurynge / and
willing to give to understand yt yet was he far from their understanding /
by very knowledge of the true faith / Also forto hyde the troth in words
couerte he may do without ly^ne specially mortal. For the holy scripture
reherseth of the holy patryarche Abraham that he counseylled his wife that she
should say unto the Egypcyens that she was his sister / and in that doing
there was troth hid and troth wrapped / for as much as she was his wife
ryally / and his sister in nature humayne / or also for as much as au^cyently
those of one self lygne as were Abraham and his wife called each other
brothers and systers / and in like manner to say is found in many other places
of holy scryptures. Also a man fyndeth another manner of lyenge ye which may be
called iactance and is committed in speaking or ymagenynge of himself more
great things than there is of goodness of nobles / of prowess / or of virtues
and after the greuousnes of the circu^staunces / it is oftyme mortal sin.
Also to say of himself any thing of his feblesses and necessytes / or of his
sins / or to take vestemens of ab eccyon to ye end that a man be renommed
and reputed humble abiecte and great thing in merytes and deuocyons before god
/ the which thing is not such as a man it shows / yt may be mortal sin
/ and such sin is named yronie / not that the which is of gra^mare / by the
which a man says one and gives to understand the contrary / for the manner
and for the purpose in the which a man speaks the words / as to say alas
that thou art a good man / or thing semblable / ye which is asmoche to say
that he is nothy^ge worth / and there he may have sin / if such thing Qui
offenderit i^ vno factus est oi^m reus. ia. ii.
be said malycyously / and for to de fame / another it should be if for to
repreue / or for to teache a man vsech in such manner to speak / a man may more
over doubt of a priest / or of another person the which is in the estate of
grace / and says his confyteor in aduouynge that he is a sinner / in deed in
word and in thought / and in all manner of sins to know if he say troth or
lie / and if he ought so to assent / or otherwise / The answer the priest
speaks in the person of all them that been crystenyd / in whom be it in one /
or in another ben all manner of sins / Also says saint Austen / that in one
only sin a man may truly consider many sins / For he that synneth mortally
is a man kyl ler / For asmoche as he puts his soul the which is the
daughter of god with all the blyssed trynyte by creacyon unto death spyrytuall.
Also he co^mytteth theft or sacrylege for as much that he takes as well from
god / as from the holy church ye thing the which unto them appertains
again ye will of the sovereign lord / That is to understand him self and
the honor and obedyence that he owes unto god. Also he co^mytteth baudrye
and auo^^rye for as much as he gives and subdueth the soul / the which by
the ve^tue of the passion / and of holy baptem was the ^spouse of Jhesu crist
unto the rybaudrye and auowtry of souls. That is to understand of the ennemy
of humayne lygnage. Also he lies and breketh the faith promised unto baptesme
and is apostate of the holy catholyque / and also of other sins by such
manners spyrytually to understand that who so co^mytteth one mortal sin / he
him may know in all with out lie / after these things before said is to be no
/ ted that every true christian man ought to be verytable as well before god as
before man. And also in his own conscience / in deeds / in w^^des / and in
abyllementes / and in his countenau^ces / In like wise as in all these things
he may committee lyenge / fyccyon / and duplycyte / of the which things if
they ben come a man ought him to repent purge / and confess / Also if he has been called for to bear wytnes before a Justyce and he will not say y^ troth
the which unto him was demanded / or to lie to his wyttynge unto the damage
of another / and in doing irreuerence unto the Justyce / over ye mortal sin
and the pain of infamye he is holden to dyl damage the party if he has lied
in confession of that the which was needful of confession / it is mortal
sin / and is not assoyled of that he has confessed if he has accusyd any
falsely and again Detraccio e^ quoti ens ^s ali^d eam t^tione de alio dicit
vtipse minus a mari vel minus appreciari possit. hec anselmus.
the order of charity / again the Justyce / or again the prelates / it is
mortal sin / if in prechynge he has said false wyttyngly / it is mortal
sin another thing it should be if by surrectyon and suddenly he says a
thing false. and this is as unto the sy^ne of lyenge.

AS unto the second point the which is of Noluit xp^s iudam proditore^

sicut e^ mortale pctm^ ino^^ti falsu crime^ imponere. sic verum crime^ occultu^

detraccyon / it is to understand that detraccyon is to reherce ill of any in
his absence / and to the end and intencyon to mynysshe his good reno^me / or
unto that he be the less praised / And for as much that good reno^me is the
most great good that person may have in these things temporalles / it
follows that to take the good reno^me from any it is again the order of
charity / as when it is by pride / by envy / or by vengeance / or other cursyd
cause / it is mortal sin / and aman is holden to restore the good reno^me /
so as it may be possible and as it has been spoken before / and therefore ought
well to take heed the which will well him confess / if he have imposed unto
any the thing the which ought be mortal sin / the which thing was not
true / or if it were true it was secret / For than if he it publysshe it is
mortal sin / and not with stondynge that the sin were publysshed as oftymes
as he it reherseth by hatered / or by envy it is mortal sin / how be it he
is not holden to restore Qui talis agsit digni sunt morte no^ solu^ ^ faciu^t

extra de re. iii
if he have rehearsed the ill / or y^ sin of his neygh boure by the manner of
comen langage not having intencyon him to defame / or him for to annoye it is
comenly ven yall sin / if he has reherced y^ fraylte and imperfeccyon the
which is of it self venyall if he do. it not again charity / as for to
defame or to let his neighbor from any good if he have wylfully herd the
detractoure / or him enducyd wyttyngly that to do / or unto him has showed by
any token that such^ langage him plesed / or has not him repreuyd when it was
a person the which he might and should do / it is mortal sin / another
thing it should be if he left him to repreue by a manner of fere humayne or
that unto him it appertains not / if he has caused wrytynges dyffamatyues
for to be found in place openly or has made or spoken songys rymes or
mockeryes for to dyffame or to mock any person it is deedly sin / if he
has said that the good works that any person does that it is by fantasy or
by ypocresye / or has not wylled to say or to confess the goodness the which
was in another him to excuse / or to deliver from any opprobe when there was
place and time / it is a defaute of chary te / And by the consequent / it is
mortal sin. To tell and reherce the ill of another by compassyon unto these
prelates / or unto other the which that may remedy / it is no detraccyon / but
charity / and of times necessary unto salvation / for who loves his neighbor
he ought to remedy his inconuenyens.

AS unto the third the which is of the sin We ^ dicit malum bonu^. ysa. v.
Item hiero. Nichii e^ quoth ta^ facile corru^at me^tes hoim sicut adulacio Ite^
a^broiser. Ne ^audau^ris hoi^em i^vita sua Item prouer: xxvii. Meliora su^t

of adulacyon or of flaterynge it is to be noted that sometime it is venyall
sin / and some mortal sin / and is defendyd in this present commandment
/ and it may be committee in three manners / First when a man preyseth any
person for to please him / in that the which is mortal sin for that should
be again the honor of god and the goodness and charity of his neighbor.
Seco^dely for the reason of the intencyon of the flaterer it is to understand
when by his adulacyon and flate ring he entendeth to dysceyue his neighbor
and hy^ for to anoye corporally and spyrytually. Thyrdly when the flaterer
gives matter / or occasyon by his adulacyon to sin mortally / And how be it
yt he intendyth not by such manner of flaterynge to make his neighbor fall in
to mortal sy^ne: Never theles the thing in which he flatereth may be of
such condycion that / that notwithstondynge he should sin mortally / In
other manners of adulacyon and flaterynge is comenly venyall sin /

AS unto the fourth point the which is of periurynge / it is to understand
that periuryng is none other thing but to swear falsely the which thing he
may do in three manners. The first when the thing that a man swereth is not
true / or a man byleueth that the thing is not so as a man affermeth by his
oath / and also it is a lie to afferme by oath / and therefore to swear it is
none other thing / but to call the troth of god to wytnes that the thing
that a man affermeth / or that a man denies is such as he says himself to
perjury is asmoche to say as god is wytnes of the falsyte / the which thing
to say / or assent is much horrible blasphemynge and irreuerence done unto
god the which is troth infynyte and therefore it is mortal sin when he does
it by delyberaco^n Secondly when the thing that a man swereth is contrary unto
reason and unto Justyce / as it should be to swear to do sin / or thing
unlawful / in so do ynge it is irreuerence to do unto god the which will not
approve the ill / and also it is mortal sin as in the manner precedent.
Thyrdly when without cause and reason good and suffycyent a man accomplyssheth
not that that he has Justly promised by oath and therefore it is mortal sin
wha^ it is done by delyberacyon / for if by precypytacyo^ or surrepcyon in
word without consenting of will a man swereth false / or thing unlefull that
is no mortal sin* the which is never committee but by delyberacyon and
consent of will. But here is Sicut ^^s prude^ti^ magnam quasi tp^e i
perceptibili ^^^b^ratsic potest ^^^osueer hitu opposito quasi i tp^e
^^^^ptibili deliberacio erit sufficie^s ad to^nem peti sicut al^^ ad to^nem
(...) Hec scotus (...). di. tercii.
well to be notyd that in like wise as an harper stryketh the strings of his
harp by delyberacyon and the one after the other in diverse alteracyon and
melodye / Also as without arestynge / or thinking on y^ that he does / and he
makes such delyberacyon by his habytuacyon and majesty / of the which he is
to praise / In like wise is it of the delyberacyon that a man has to do well /
or to do ill / for in little time and also as imperceptyble a man may have de
lyberacyon suffycyent to committee mortal sin in cursyd works / as is to
swear in vain / and himself to forswere / or also for to seche merytes in good
works as is to praised god / By the which many great and solemn doctors in
holy theology aftermen and shown that to swear without prouffyte and
necessyte in comen langage / notwithstondynge that the thing that a man
swereth be true / and that a man is not dysposed otherwise as it is said / be
it by custom unto the which a man puts no pain to resyste as a man should
/ it is the transgressyon of the commandment of god and by the consequent
mortal sin / for it is not lefull to swear / That is to understand to call
the troth of god unto wytnes / if there be not three co^dycyons The first is
that the thing that a man swereth be verytable. The second that it be a
thing Just and lawful / for every true thing is not Just ne good to speak
morally. The third that notwithstondynge that if any be true and Just / as it
is true and Just that the day the which was yesterdaye is paste / and that
the day of the morrow is comy^ge. How be it it suffyseth not of such troth
for to swear well surely / but with that it behooves that swerynge be made in
Jugement. That is to under stand with dyscrecyon in aduysynge if there be
necessyte / or prouffyte for himself / or for his neighbor / such that the
troth infynyte ought to be called to wytnes / by oath what so ever it be. for
who that swereth by these saints / or other creatures heswereth always
pryncypally / by god the which has made and mayntenyth such creatures / And
therefore sayen as well these doctors of theologye / as of the troth and right
y^ when of these three condycyons before said or many / That is to understand
veryte / Justyce / Jugement / or dyscresyon / dyffayllyng / it is to swear in
vain / and again the commandment of god / and abusing is to swear / but
when an oath is made with these three condycyons a man may well swear surely /
and there he may have merit / In like wise as by the de^ fault of the one / or
of many it is great irreuerence done unto god and transgressyon of his law /
by the which it appears clearly ye great perell of da^pnacyon / unto those
that can no^ spe^e but in swerynge / also as at every word and for a thing of
naught / but they sayen that it is not but of custom and that they do it not
by delyberacyon the which is none other thing to say but to excuse and
encreasynge of their sin / How be it well it may ^^^ multu^ ^ura^s ^^pleb^ i

happen that he the which has very dyspleaser of such cursyd custom and
purpose him to absteyne in time to come that if he swear by ouersyght and by
labytuacyon of his cursyd custom / of the which thing he should be
dyspleasau^t when he knows it for to swear / Than it is not to say that in
ly^e wyle to swear in vain were sin / or at the moost^it is not but venyall
sin / but it is not to doubt that those the which haven such purpose. and

aged gone from ill unto wors / notwithstondynge predy^acyons / and inspyracyons
y^ god unto them sends from year to year / and from month to month / By the
which I can not ymagen that such christian people ben in the way of saluacy^n
/ nor that they may perfytly resyste unto the devil / ne resyste unto their
cursyd custom / if they labor not first parfytly to put them in the estate
of grace / without the which a man may not begin to do well / and therefore
says well the wise Lathon that he is the gret^ friend of god the which can
govern well his tongue / and such is beginning of all holiness of life And for
to show that the holy ghost apperyd inse^blaunce of tongys upon the appostles
the which ben and were the pyllers and the foundars of holy church after
Thesu christ and the sweet vyrgyn his mother in she wynge in like wise that if
the holy ghost govern not the tongue / with pain may it be but that it be the
instrument of the devil / embracyd with the fire of hell / as witnesses
saint James in his canon / who so has not ^he beginning of good life / That is
well and holely to use with his tongue may not have good mean / that is to
understand the grace of god for to come unto the holy end the which is the
glory of paradyse / where fore says well holy scripture that he the which
swereth often shall be fulfilled with iniquyte and that fynably the punycyon of
god shall come vpo^hym. Some doctors of our time seeing ye multy Queritdoctor

tude of chose the which were often in their come^ langages without prouffyte
and necessyte / and more over considering their estates / their scyences / and
their degrees as ben many people of the chirthe / as well regulers as seculers
and some doctors in dyuynyte / in laws Lyuiles / and in decretes. Also noble
people advocates / and other indyuers estates / among whom there hen many the
which have great tolrenes to fere and to love god / have made great admyracyon
in this matter / and have fere to give sentence that such people ben all in y^
way of perdycyon / for their abusing to swear in vayn and without dyscrecyon /
but the honor sauyd of werlres* pyteous / less admyracyon in that ought to
be made that in the sentence of blyssed Thesu christ irreuocall the which is
such Multi sunt vocati / pa^^i vero electi. Math. xx. ca. And is as much to
say / many of the people ben called / and right few there are that been saved
/ or in another manner and unto our purpose / many there ben that been baptized
/ and the which should never swear in vain and right few there are that it
will keep / Also it is a comen sentence / and a conclusyon certain yt as
oftymes and as many / as in the mat^r of the faith / or of good manners these
doctors holden diverse oppynyons / of the which the one is^ certain and sure
to hold / for to keep him from sin and Et^^ obiciatur^ e cia^ suppoitur

that the other oppynyon conteyneth in him doubt hogely where that it is
sin. a man is holden in such case upon pain of mortal sin to hold y^
party certain / and to leave the doubtous / for it is he dysposeth hy^ unto the
peril of mortal sin and by the consequent dyspyseth his salvation. /: Now
is it so that some has wylled to say that to sw^re in vain as it is to swear
in comen langage the thing the which is not necessary nor pro^ffy table it is
not but ve^yall. ynne. These other doctors / and great nombre sayen the
contrary. That is to understand to swear without dyscrecyon and for thing of
no prouffyte / it is the transgressyon of the commandment of god / and by the
consequent mortal sin / after the form the which has been before put and
declared / Of the which opynyons the one is right sure and right certain /
that is to eschew such swerynge / in holding the doctrine of our sauyoure
and redemptour. Thesu christ put in the gospel there where it is said that
our manner of speech is hard / or not / without other manner of swerynge / if
there be no necessyte. The other oppynyon the which says y^ such manner of
swerynge in comen langage that the which is true I put that it were not
prouffytable / or necessyte it is but venyall sin / it is hogely doubtous.
Specially after as Thesu christ unto us has declared in this matter his holy
will as it is said By the which to do the contrary indyfferently it concludes
in it self the dyspysynge of god and of his conscience / and for as much
after the sentence of the doctors to hold such oppynyon / and it to use / it
is for to sin mortally / And yet for the more certain to show that such
manner of swerynge upon comen langage by custom and without necessyte / it is a
thing right peryllous and reprouable.

Here follows certain conclusyons in laten extractes of doctors and
wrytynges of great and sole^pne doctors in holy theologye.

BY these things sygnifyed in these conclusyons and auctorytes as well of holy
scripture as by doctors before said alleged appears clearly that all those
the which have such cursyd custom to swear for nothing and without
necessyte And will not labor to correct them / dyspysen god and their
salvation / and by the consequent synnen mortally / and me seems also / as
Impossyble to believe that the person the which is in mortal sin may leave
the evil custom to swear with out cause and necessyte / for the devil of
hell ye which tormenteth spyrytually such manner of people he aydeth the more
easily from their members / for even in like wise as a man puts a bytte of a

mean of the which a child little of aege and in might him torneth and
retorneth and holds steadfast. In like wise does the deuyllin putting cursyd

that he possedeth / by the which he them ledeth and brings again from
sin to sy^ne all at his will by such manner yt there is no doctrine excused
nor puyssaunce humayne yt which may or can stop and refrain such tongues so
enfla^med and governed by the spyryte of devil / that they do not the
operacyon of him the which them governs / as is to lie / to backbyte / to
fors were him / to mock / and all other manner of folysshe and abhomynable
langages / of whom proceden other ylles innumerable. In like wise as it
appears by y^ third chapter or the canon of saint James / and this is as at
this time as unto the sin to swear / and to for swear folysshely / the which
thing weyed and aduysed a man him may well confess.

Here follows of the.ix. commandment.
OVer these things spoken in the.ix. co^maandement the sinner ought to take heed unto Caplm. xxiii
the points the which folowen. That is ^o know if he has desired by
consenting and delyberacyon to accomplysshe the sin of lechery / or if he
have delyted in carnal thoughts / and for to understand and well to Juge of
such wylles when it is mortal sin / or alonely venyall / The which thing
is right hard / it behooves first to understand three things the which ben
in us defferences / The first is sensualyte the which is none other thing but
the.v. wits of nature with their operacyons / as is the sight / the taste /
the herynge / the smelling / and the touching / In these five things we and
these bestes ben comen / The second thing the which is in us / is the law
porcyon of reason the which is a light of knowledge of our operacyons and
dyscrecyon natural of things sensybles in the which we surmou^t these
bestes. /: The third thing is the souerayn porcyon of reason the which is a
light by y^ which we have dysposycyon to understand these things spyrytuall*
dyuyne / and eternal / the which porcyon may be anormed of the noble virtue of
the faith catholyque and informed of the troth of the commandments of god /
and than she may and ought to have do mynacyon and rule as well the sensualyte
/ as the law porcyon of reason and all their operacyons / or if there be
defaute / or neclygence of the devil of hell allied of the sensualyte / and of
the mondanyte of this present life puts in oftymes the concupyscence carnal
and temporal by ye wyndowes of the souls the which ^en the five wits of
nature before said / to the end that the law porcyon of reason there takes
pleasure dysordenate / be it in drink or meet / or melodye of sou^dys / or in
towchynges / or other pleasures sensualles / and that she induces the high
porcyan to give consent in such pleasure dysordenate is dyspleasau^ce unto
god after the form that tho days / Eve presented un to Adam the beauty of the
apple / and the swetnes of the taste / unto the which thing he condystendyd
and consented again the commandment of god by the which all humayne lygnage
was damned / if god by his mercy infynyte had not remedyed. By Eve a man
should understand as well the sensualyte / as the law frail porcyon of
reason / and by Adam the sovereign porcyon and this is the foundacyon to
understand when these sy^nes y^ which be committed alonely in the will ben
mortal or venyall for in the oonly pleasure of the sensualyte / he may not have
mortal sin / But if the pleasure of the thing deffended / as is lechery
theft or propre vengeance comes till unto the law porcyon of reason and in
that doing aresteth and abides in him there in delytynge before that
sovereign reason may or ought to have suffycyente aduertyssement / it is
venyall sin comenly / But if sovereign reason is notally neclygente to
repreue and again say such pleasure dysordenate / by the which neclygence
and defaute / the reason inward abides and delyteth in y^ said dysordenau^te
/ how be it that the accomplysshynge of the deed him dyspleaseth / and it
again says / than is that mortal sin after the comen sentence of doctors
for hye porcyon of reason is in blame / for as much as she has not ben enough
dylygent to repreue and to put out the peryllous pleasure the which was comen
into the inward reason / and such neclygence may be named consentyngly by
interpretacyon / Bonauenture says in this matter that many such thoughts to
be alonely venyall sin The which has been well Juged they ben mortal sins
/ wherefore in such doubt a man him ought delygently to examen and him to
confess / as of mortal sin. for in all cases of conscience / the which ben
doubtous / a man is bound to chese the most sure party. Also it is to be
noted that oonly will fully determined and dysposed to acco^plysshe any mortal
sin / is mortal sin / and of such condycyon / as had be the the sin /
if that it had been accomplysshed by work. As for an example / if any had
will to have company carnal of a vyrgyn he co^mytteth the sin of defflo /
racyon / if with any of his kynred / it is inceste / if with any relegyous / it
is sacrylege / and so unto the sin of theft and of other commandments But
in that unto such dyfference that the sin the which abides alonely in the
will is not punysshed / of the pain canon / or Cyuyle as should be the will
with the deed / An example oonly will to beat a clerk / or to slay him again
the order of charity suffyceth not for to run in the sentence of
excomunycacyon / or for to be reserved unto ye pope or unto the bishop / and
therefore a simple curate him may assoyle / and so of other case. Also it is to
be notyd that if any person has will to accomplysshe mortal sin / such
will may be interrept and devised in many manners. First by will contraryous as
is true contrycion and dyspleaser to have had such will / and after such
contrycion of new retorneth unto that cursyd will of sin. And than they ben
two mortal sins / in asmoche that such will drowe back in the manner
spoken. Secondly she may be interrupte by diverse thoughts / and occupacyons
woldly / as for to sleep / to drink / or to ete / or for to speak with other
persons / by such wise that as many times and often the temptacyon retorneth
unto the mind the will is dysposed to accomplysshe the sin / and than after
some doctors / they ben as many of mortal sy^nes / as the said will has been
interrupted oftymes Other will say that it is but one mortal sin / of as
much the more grievous / as it has been by long time continued / and therefore
the long abydy^ge / and frequentacyon / of such temptacyon ought to be
confessed / and dysclosed after that it is possible / unto the fraylte of the
mind humayne / by such manner that the confessor dyscrete may understand the
multitude / or the greuousnes of such sin / for else the confession should
not be suffycyent / for that that a man is bound to tell all his sins as
unto the nombre. Also if such cursyd will were applied again many persons /
again one / and after unto another / they should be as many sins mortalles as
they should be of persons but if such will be applied unto many persons by
one oonely operacyon that should not be but one sin as to the operacyon of
the will / but it should be many as unto oblygacyon of pain and unto ye
deformyte of sin / as for example. Some harlot sees.vi. wymen / of the
which the one is in wydo hode / the other in marriage / the other a vyrgyn /
and so in other diverse degrees / and that he has had a will and consenting
to desire to have their company carnal / unto the regard of one that should
be auowtry / and unto the other defloraco^n and so of other diverse degrees /
And a man ought to understand these things spoken of cursyd will / as well of
the concupyscence carnal defended in the ix. commandments as of the
concupyscence of couetyse defended in the.x.

Here follows of the.x. commandment.
Over these things spoken in the.x. commandment Capl^.xxv.
it is to be notyd that oonely will to stele is theft and mortal sin. and
of that espyce and manner as if the deed had been accomplysshed in like wise as
has been said of the will of the co^cupyscence carnal in the.ix.
commandment. Also more over it is to be noted that he the which enda^mageth
his neighbor in a little thing be it in byenge or in selling / or else he
him would enda^mage gladly of a more gretter thing if he might he synneth
mortally / for god looks more pryncypally unto the will than unto the work
outward and unto that is unhappy should well take heed the which over sellen
their marchaundyse in little price for as much that they may not nor should
not ouersell in more greter price of the which thing to do they have well the
will ye which is dampnable and also mortal sin. By these things Pranu^ ^

probans renes ^ do vnicuique turta via^ sua^.hie. xv^.
before said clearly appears that it is a right hard thing to Juge well of
wylles humayns: And with much great pain it suffyseth the most gretest
clerk of the w^^lde well to Juge deserve and weye his own wylles / in the
which more over may a man know the presumpcyon of those the which Jugen
lightly of the conscience of their neighbors. The which suffyse not to Juge
well them self alonely and none other. And therefore it is necessary unto every
creature erthely the which yet is witholden in the derkenesses of this life to
dyspose himself by humylyte mekenes and prayers again the light and clerenes
without end / the which illumyneth and adresseth every creature Erat lur vera
q^ i^ lu^^at o^m hoi^em venie^te^ in hu^c mu^ du^.io. i. ca.
the which ben in this world create / so as it appertains and as a man it
shall deserve and win well and merytoryously. That is to say the blyssed
Jhesus unto whom by honor and glory of this world and reward us for our
labor in the eternal bliss Amen.

Here follows how fasting ought to be made and when and of whom.
FOr as much as oftentimes a man is enjoined in penance for to do almesdede /
fasting / and prayer / And that of almesdede it has been treatyd in the third
party of this book / rest we as now to see somethynge / and in few words
of fasting. As unto the first it is to be noted yt some may be bound to
fast other by commandment general of holy church / or by penance
enjoined / or for as much that he has vowed to fast As unto the fastings of
the church it is to understand that the.xl. days the four Imbres that is to
understand the wenysdaye / the frydaye / and ye saterdaye next after
Whytsontyde / and those afte^ ^ona est or o^ cu^ ^e ^un^o and clemosina

saint Luce in decembre / and those after assh wenysdaye / Also the mondaye /
the tewysdaye and the wenysdaye before the Assencyon / the vigiles of y^
apostles / except saint Jamis / saint Phelip / and saint John^ the
Euangelyste. Also the vigiles of Crystemas / of De co^se. di v. qua diagesima.

Whytsontyde / of the Assumpcyon of ourelady / of saint John^ Baptyst / of
saint Laurence / and of All halowen ben fasted of the commandment of y^ Extra
de obserua^ione ^e^uniorum co^si ^iu^. and. ca. applica^i
church / how be it the fast of the three days of roga cyons is not proprely
commanded if it were not for the general custom of the regyon / but it is y^
counsel and admonycyon of good devotion. The custom general to fast in
every regyon or bysshopryche byndeth them the which than enhabyte in it if
they have not excusacyon lefull / for the law of right posytyf intends not to
bind any person the which has exculacyon reasonable to fast all the lent /
or other fasting days / as ben wymen with child / or nourysshes / laborers /
the which traualen gretely / poor people ye which have not whereof to take
suffycyently their refeccyon / old people / and people that have the gout /
young people under y^ years of. xxi. like people / and pilgrims the which
have necessyte to speed and delygent their way how be it young people y^ which
ben of. x. or of. xii. or of. xv. years after their compleccyon should of good
congruyte fast more or less after as they fy^de by the counsel of their
confessors of their good inspyracyons. Also many poor people and laborers
enforce them to fast / and in so doing they may purchase great merit /
notwithstondynge yt they be not bound after the require of commandment /
every other person the which without excusacyon reasonable trespasseth unto
his wetynge. and by contempt the fasting the which ben of commandment of
the church or of good custom approuyd mortal sin mortally nor may not be
excused of one only day in gyuynge an hundredth thousand crowns for to
redeem the said fast. / A another thing it is of a fast put in penance / or
that a man has it by vow / for he unto whom it shall appertain it may
change / or dyspence. also I put that a woman married may leave by the
commandment of her husband the fastes that she has by vow before that she
was his wife / how be it she may not by such commandment without other
excusacyon break the fastes of the church but that she sin / Also it is to
be notyd that* when Crystmas day comes on the frydaye a man may ete flesh /
except those y^ which have the frydaye by vow / or by penance. These other
the which wyllen the^ abstey^e without Jugynge their neighbors they do not
ill. Also to ete spyces or confectures / to drink wine / or ale / or other
drynkes before dinner / or after is no brekynge of the fast / if it be not done
in fraudynge the fast / that is to understand that a man takes such things
not for necessyte of thorste / or of debylyte of stomach / but for to keep him
from hunger / or in taking ye said things in quantyte excessyuely. Also to
ete flesh on the saterdaye it may be done without sin if it were the
custom of the country. Also the bishop dyocesayn may and ought to dyspence
with syke people to ete flesh in the lent / or the frydaye and on other
fasting days / and in like wise with the people in time of necessyte / and of
great famyne / for Extra de obserua ^o^ne ^eiuniorum. cap Consiliu^.
necessyte is not subject unto the laws / for to absteyn on ye frydaye to ete
flesh it is good counsel and a thing to praise but not commandment To
fast the aduent or not the custom of the country ought to be observed. The
hour of dinner the right is three hours after the myddaye / but y^ custom
obtayneth at the myddaye / servants may after their offices taste the meets
one after they have broken their fast to bear some messes / and afterward
make an end of their dinner without fracc^on of their fast. To hold long table
excessyuely for to pass the time / to the end that y^ fast be not to much
costable to bear / it is fraud of the intencyon Legem fra^git ^ in fraude^
legis aliq^d facit.
of the statute of holy church / And here may he have such exces that it is
the brekynge of ye fast Also one dronken body on the day of fasting sy^neth
sometime more grievously than he had done in brekynge his fast symply without
making him self dronken / to ete many times on the fasting day he breketh
his fast / it is also agreuau^ce of sy^ne more or less of asmoche that a man
eteth many times.

Here follows the second point the which is of prayer.
AS unto the second point the which is of Caplm xxvii
prayer that is to understand that every creture reasonable the which has age
and dyscrecyon competent is bound by the right of nature to make prayer unto
god his creator / for prayer as unto that purpose is to lift up his heart
unto god in reknowlegynge him his / creator / master / and lord In
requyrynge him prouysyon of things necessary unto this present life / and aid
again all our adversaries / and of diverse temptacyons the which comes on
all parts to the end that by ye mean of his aid and of his blyssed grace we
may come unto his blyssed royame. Nature unto us says that we should seche the
thing without the which we may not be as is the aid of god / The which aid
is not unto us duly regnoure of Justyce nor we have not whereof we may it
suffycyently bye / by ye which we must and should abide in yt necessyte to
demand that aid humbly and devoutly by prayers and orysons and therefore in
all places and at all hours the aid of god unto us is necessary. for other
wise we may not endure / or unto our adversaries resyste. So unto us of
necessyte ever more Oportet se^per orare and n^quam deficere. luce xviii. Dn^e
a^te te oe^ desi deriu^ men^. p^. xxx. vii. v^i glosa. Nu^quam de su^t orare
qu^ nu^quam desunt amare.
to pray in like wise as says Jhesu christ in ye gospel. That is to
understand that after oryson vocal / or mental made in place and in time
after good congruyte / holds us evermore in the love and fere of god / and
holely occupied / and in so doing we pray god without cessynge / for the good
desire of the heart is before god an high clamoure. / Also saint Austen
declares that we may not nor we should not come to god if he called us not /
and we may not come if he aid us not / and we deserve not to be aided but
only by devout prayers / and therefore at the beginning of the seven hours
canonicales we require ye aid of god / when we say deus in adiutorium.

To have pacyence in suffrynge great aduersytees. To have vyctorye of
trybulacyons and temptaco^ns. To put out these evil thoughts and affeccyons.
To hold thine espyryte in holy and prouffytable medytacyon. To know the
begylynges and temptacyons of the devil. To berethe labor Joyously unto the
which god the calls. The to conferme and make strong to do the will of thy
creature. To leave the estate of sin and to purchase virtues. To come unto
holy contemplacyon / and thou too come with god. To have Joye and swetnes
spyrytuall in god. To be famylyer with angels / and hateful unto deuylles.
Finally to have the royalme of paradyse.
Also more over it is to be noted that some may Derse. d. i Missas died dn^ica

be holden and bound to prayer vocal / or for by cause of his office / as ben
people of the church / or for penance enjoined / or for as much that he has
auowed such prayer / or for such ordenau^ce general of holy church / by the
which the people is bound to here the dyuyne service on the sondayes and
great solempnyte / if they have not excusacyon lefull / and unto them it
suffyseth not for to acquyte and for to seche merit before god to be in the
church / and to here alonely with the eeres corporalles the office of ye mass
/ but they should lift up their hertes unto god in like wise as the preeste
the which unto them represents Jhesu christ them commands saying (Sursum
corda) That is to say have your hertes upward / that is to know the
understanding and the will toward god / and there fore answers the clergy
as well for them as for the people (habemus ad dn^m) That is to say we have
our hertes with god / and such thing that is to understand to have his heart
/ his understanding / and his will toward god is a ryall and verytable prayer
after as says a doctor named Damascene and unto yt purpose says Bonauenture
yt he hereth truly the mass and none other the which Extra de cele. mis
^arum. Dole^tes. hie. habe^ de ^se. d. v. N^^ verbis tm^ sz ^orde ora^dus e^

with that that he hereth the words he him co^uerteth by devotion / and by the
understanding to consider the mystery of the blessed passion / by the which
it is to be noted that he the which is bound to make oryson vocal by vow /
by penance or otherwise and wyttyngly during that oryson he is occupied in
other works or thoughts / lettynges / or contraryous unto the said oryson
synneth much grievously and is not acquyte / another thing it is when such
thoughts and occupacyons / comen again the will / and yt a man does his pain
to put them out after the fragelyte humayne / and unto this article should
those desyrously take heed the which ben bound unto the hours canonyales For
the holy church commands in the virtue of holy obedience that they ben said
devoutly and atte^tyuely / for god takes more of pleaser and of love in the
devotion of the heart / than he does in the voice and modulacyon of the mouth.
Also oryson made with three condycyons / that is to understand prouffytably /
faithfully / and with perseueraunce is ever more finally exalted of our lord.
prouffytably yt is to demand the thing yt is unto the glory of god / and
unto the salvation of the soul. Faithfully that is when he the which makes
the oryson has true faith / hope / and charity toward god with ^^ ^g^ dico
vobis petite and dabor vobis q^^ite and iuenietis puisate and a perie^ vobis.
Petitis et non accipitis eo quam male petatis. ia.
perseuerau^ce / when the prayer / the affection and good life / and good
operacyon perseueren / and it it is that y^our lord says in the gospel / axe
/ seche and knock / axe by prayer / seche by affection / and knock by good
operacyon / for all those that so done shall receive that / that they would.

prayers oblacyons / pylgrymages / processyons the which god exalts not be
it for him self or for other / for they have not the condycyons before said.
As unto the regard of goods and prosperytes temporal the which many
demau^den and requyren in their prayers / happens oftymes that god them
grants unto great and horrible sinners / and in hydynge it unto his friends
the which ben in the estate of grace / so as it appears of ye cursyd rich man
unto whom Abraham answered after the death. Remember the that god the reward
of thy goods as thou haste done in ye other world / And therefore says Job.
that oftymes that the uys and people of evil life have abou^dance of gods of
this world / for god grau^teth oftymes ye gods worldly unto those again
whom he is wroth / and gives aduersytes and trybulacyons unto those the
which that he holds in his love / In like wise as he says by saint John^ in
his appocalypse. / These holy scryptures unto us declaren in many places right
plainly what condycyons and cyrcu^stau^ces true prayer ought to have / among
ye which there are thyrty specyalles of the which agay^ the form of this
treatise folowen the auctorytes / line by line after their order with the
frensshe.

The first condycyon of prayers is that she ought to be made in true faith.

without doubt. Jacobi Postulet in fide nil hesitans. de hoc. xxiiii. q. ii.
ss. ii Citius exaud^ a deo ^^ohu^^liantis ^ dec^ milia cont^^^ris. aug.
Thyrdly prayer ought to be made with humylyte Eccle. xxv. Oracio humiliantisse
nubes penetrabit: Fourthly with dyscrecyon without the which she is not unto
god pleasant. Mathei: xx. Nestitis quid potatis. Et ia. iiii. petitis et non
accipitis eo quam male potatis. Fyfthly more of the heart than of ye mouth in
multyplyenge. i. reg. i. Anna loquebatur in cord suo et vox penitus non
audiebatur. Syxtly with reverence in humylyte and in fere. luce. xviii Publicanus
non audebat leuare oculos suos ad celum. Seventhly she ought to be made secret
and in place pryue. Mathei. vi. Tu aute^ cum oraueris intra cubiculu^ tum et
clau so ostio ora patrem. Eyghtly in poornes of heart / and of conscience. p^s.
Iniquitate^ si / aspexi i cord meo no^ exaudiet dn^s. Nynethly with terys at ye
lost spirytuall and cordyal. Audiui oracione^ tua^ vidi lacrimas tuas. et ide^.
tho Tenthly with atte^cyon unto the which a man speaks and that demau^deth.
p^s. Inte^de voci oraco^nis me: and rex meus deus meus etc. ergo et tu
atte^de: Enleuenthly with great fervor of spyrite. hie. xlviii Maledictus ^
facit opus dei neglygenter. Tweluethly she ought to be accompanied with good and
holy works. Tho. xii. bona e^ oracio cu^ ieiunio Et Mathei. v. Beati
misericordes. Thyrtenthly with perseuerau^ce / as from day to day / from good
unto better. Actum. apostolierant perseuerantes cu^ mulieribus et maria matrem
eius. By these things before said appears the necessyte / the noblesse / and
the prouffyte of the true oryson for as says John^ Crisostum we shall speak
and may speed with god by holy oryson as oftymes as we will in marchaundysynge
and in asking all the things the which unto us be necessary / and
prouffytable / and in this faith I require the mercy of the blyssed sweet
Jhesus as well for me as ye necessyte with all our mother holy church that it
him please us to pardon / and us to reform and to bring in the true
obseruau^ce of his blyssed commandments and of his holy grace and
benedyccyon by the merytes of our lady his glorious mother / and of all other
blyssed saints our poor souls yllumyne / to ye end that finally we may
come unto his blyssed fruccyon amen.
Here follows a right prouffytable applicacyon of the art of a phesecyan with
the practyse ye which the phesecyan spyrytuall ought to hold with the
interrogacyons that a man ought to make unto him the which is in the article
of death.
Caplm xxvi.
AS for to seche and conserve the life and health corporal many stodyen right
desyrouslye as well the theorique as the practyser of the art of phesyke / by
more greter reason / of as much as the soul is more noble than the body / and
the life of glory more dygne than te^porall / every true christian man should
study in the science by the which he may purchase and conserve in his soul
the life of Inu^sibilia enim dei a creatura mu^ di per ea ^ facta su^t i^
tell^eta co^spiciuntur. rom^. i. ca.*
grace without the which a man may not come un to life eternal / And therefore
to the end that we may know and eschew sin the which is the syknes of the
soul and the cause of death eternal follows brefe recolleccyon of the art of
physyke spyrytuall founded in the twelve rules of the science of physyke
corporal / for in like wise as us techeth the right glorious apostle saint
Poul by y^ mean manduccyon of things corporalles and sensybles a man may come
unto the contemplacyon of spyrytualles / And therefore unto us has given the
sweet Ihesu christ the true saumarytayn and physycyans of oursoules / the
physyke of his holy sacraments under the form of things corporal in fere
who answers / as well of the syknes as of the medecyne / and also as of the
syke body. For for asmoche that for the occasyon of the first sin was the
etynge of the apple the which was a thing corporal. Ihesu christ unto us
has given his precious body / and his right holy blood under the for me and
semblaunce of bread / and of wine / and so of baptysme and of other sacraments
in like wise as well again the metynge of sin orygenall as of other / As
unto the regard of the physycyan it is Ihesu christ the which is god and a
man togyders / and the syke body that is a man and woman in body materyall /
and spyrytuall / by the which of good right appears that by the physyke
corporal a man may treat and give to understand y^ spyrytuall.

THe first rule of a physecyan is that he ought to understand what health is /
and what syknes is. Or else he may not enduce the one and put out the other /
In like wise ought the physycyan spyrytuall. That is to understand the
confessor to know what sin is / the which is the sykenes of the soul / and
what it is to be in the estate of the grace of god the which is the health of
that soul: wherefore it is to be noted that health corporal is Quatuor su^t
humores sa^guis tleuma colera melancolia.
good dysposycyon the which comes of an armony and consyderacyon of the four
humors. that is to understand of the blood / of the coler / of the fleume /
and of the malancoly / For when all these four keep his degree without exceeding
or having rule after ye co^plexyon of ye supposau^t there is health corporal /
and by the contrary exces / or defaute / or tribulacyon in ye one / or in many
of ye said humors causes syknes applycacyon / In like wise when Quatuor
passiones Ira co^cupisce^ cia timor tristicia.
the four pryncypall passions of the soul. That is to understand / Ire /
concupyscence / fere / and heaviness benduely ordained and amodered / than the
soul is well dysposed and in health spyrytuall. But by ye contrary when they
ben dysordenate / and troubled there is syknes / and plainly to understand
this matter / that is to know yt when the passion of Ire / is unto y^ regard of
things ye which we may sooner from ye love of ye creator when our
co^cupyscence and desire is to y^ regard of y^ goods of glory / fere is unto
ye regard of da^pnacyon / and heaviness is unto the regard of sins the which
we have commyt Than the soul is well dysposed and in health spyrytuall / And
thanne by the contrary when that these four passions ben dysordenate / and
unto y^ regard of things erthely the soul falls in langoure and in to
excessyue syknes.

THe second rule of a phesecyan is that he ought to inquire the causes of
health and of ^^atuor qualitates calor rigiditas siccitashumiditas
syknesses / for every thing produces brings forth and nouryssheth his
effect / By the which it is to be notyd that when the four qualytes / that
is to Super cecidit igniset no^ videru^t sole^ p^s. lvii.
understand / hete / cold / dry and moystour ben in certain and in good
porcyon unto the regard and suppost: Than they causen armonye and health
Trepida^ersit timore vbi no^ erat timor. p^s. lii.
In like wise the exces or diminucyon or perturba cyon the one again ye other
/ causen syknes / applycacyon / In like wise is it unto the soul. By he
Inici^^ sapi^etimor dn^i. p^s. cx.
te unto us is sygnyfyed love the which may be well ordained again god / or
dysordynate again those things erthely / and than it causes in ye soul
health or syknes / more or less after the ordenaunce / or dysordenaunce. By
cold is sygnyfyed fere the which may be worldely / humayne / seriule / and
vycyous / and than that causes syknes spyrytuall or it may be health / and
fylyale and the beginning of true sapyence and she causes health / by drynes is
sygnyfyed heaviness the which may be dysordynate in much and in little / as is
to be to much heavy of aduersytes worldly / and little of the offense and
dishonor of god / moystnes sygnyfyeth delytes and pleaser without the which
soul reasonable may not live / if they ben worldely and carnal they causen
syknes / if they ben in god and in things spyrytuall they causen health
spyrytuall.

THe third rule of a physycyan is that by Grego. sicut i^ art medicie calida
frigidis frigida calidiscura^tur ita dn^s nt^ ^traria oppo^^ it medica^ta
pcti^s vt lubricis ^tine^ci a^ tenacibus largitate^ iracu^dis ma^sue tudine^
elatis preciperet humilitate^
thing contraryous he should chase the other as if the syknes be hot / he ought
to give a medycyne cold / if it be by cause of coldenes / he ought to give
medycyne of hete / and so of other causes applycacyon. In like wise in the
physyke spyrytuall / for in like wise as Ihesu christ techeth / and the which
saint Gregorye declares / again lechery a man should put to abstynau^ce / in
drink and in meet / in y^ using / in taking head / again couetyse /
almesded^ / again Ire / and furour / pacyence / heaviness / again pride
humylyte / The which manner to remedy ought to be understand when there is no
cause suffycyent wherefore resonably a man should other wise do.

THe fourth rule of the physycyan / is to conserve Non in solo pane vivit ho^
sed i^ oi^ verbo quoth procedit de ore dei. deuteronomy. viii. and mat. iiii. Qui
perseuerauerit in fine^: hic saluus erit. mat..x. Quid pri^cipiis obsta sero

malu^. hiero. xiii. c.
the health recoueryd the which thing is done in four manners. The first in
the using of good meets. Secondly in taking of good drink. Thyrdly in
eschewynge drink excessyf noysau^t. Fourthly in holding him in good air In
like wise is it unto the deed spyrytuall. First in herynge good doctrynes and
predycacyons. Se condly to desire always to do better and to be more worth.
Thyrdly in occupyenge him in holy operacyons / forellys at long going a man
may not eschew these euylles. Fourthly in persevering in good works / for
without perseuerau^ce in good life a man may never come to the hyre or reward.

THe fyfth rule of the physycyan / is dylyge^ce for to remedy at the
beginning of syknesses. For with more great pain is the thorn areched of as
much as she puts her rote the more in depnes / applycacyon / a like thing
it is of sin who so him will plant in the soul / be it Ire / envy / pride /
lechery or other sin / for who y^ will resyste at the beginning he thereto
may come easily / but who that it deffereth by long time with great pain he
thereto comes / And therefore says well holy scripture that he has the
blessing of god the which casts his lytelnes and yongth nourysshed / and it
chaseth again the stone / by thesely Fu^dame^tu^ aliud nemo po^t ponere pter
illud quoth pos^tu^ e^ jesus xp^s*to ^i. iiii.
tell young and newely borne ben sygnyfyed these evil thoughts and moeuynges
of sin the why che ben casten again the stone / when a man requires the
aid of Ihesu christ the which is named the true stone / for as much as he is
the foundacyon of the holy faith catholyque and of all holy church.

THe syxte rule ^f a phesycyan is yt he ought to know the tokenes of the
sykenes the which Nota quattuor signa ifirm^^a^^s.
ben four. The first when the person has lost all apetyte. The second
when he eteth and forth with he it auoydeth by y^ way that he has it
received. The third when he appetyteth not but things the which unto him be
contraryous. applycacyon / Alyke thing it is unto the deed of the soul when
she enioyneth not to receive good doc / tryne / it is the first token of his
sykenes or when she herkeneth gladly euoweth but nothing she reteyneth that is
as unto the second / or when shere ceyueth and retayneth but she puts
nothing in work by good dygestyon y^ is as unto the third as evil token /
or when she desires not but things worldly / and erthly and without mesure /
as by symony or usury.

THe seventh rule of a phesycyan is to know Erit tp^s cum sana^ doctrina^ non
sustinebu^t. i. thim. iiii. Ad tp^s credu^t et i^ tp^e te^ptaco^is recedu^t.
luce. viii. Dicu^t et no^ faciu^t mathei. xxiii. c. Quatuor signa sanitatis.
Qui ex deo e^ verba dei audit. io. viii. c.
the tokenes of health the which ben four and contrary unto the four tokenes
of syknes before said. applycacyon. when the soul appetyteth to here good
doctrine and puts pain to retain / and to put it in work by good life /
and eschew evil langage and folysshe co^panyes. Than she is nourysshed with
remembrance by holy medytacyons those things the which unto her may
prouffyte / and by that she increases and fortyfyeth in every benediccion.

THe.viii. rule of a phesycyan yt is to avoid pain and heaviness unto the
pacyent in gyuynge good medycyne. Example / great abstynence and dyete for to
hele fevers with porcyon of herbs bitter to perce and cleue in diverse manners
botches Pene in montibus su^t medicinales secu^dum aristo.
swellynges / and apostumes / to give pylles or triacle made of venym / and of
porsons / and of bitter things / for to avoid these evil humors / for to
break bones / synewes / veins in members evil set and crokyd / for to
bring them again and the^ remytte in their right point / and soof many other
medecines. applicato^. so is it in medicine spiritua* for who that suffers the
brennynge of cursyd concupyscence carnal he ought to make dyete / who that
has botche and swellynge of pride / ought to consider the humylyte of the
king of glory / his life and his passion and humble himself / he that is in
Ire / or in envy the tryacle of bitter compassyon unto him is necessary and him
behooves to make fraccyon of the hardenes of his heart. Also as he has one
membre crokyd and dysordoned from his place in requyrynge pardon and in
humblynge hy^ to ward those that he might offend / and by such wise he him
shall redress and shall live with his neighbor.

THe.ix. rule is little / and little and by succes ^umb^ nissemad vos fre^s
veni no^ i sublimitate sermonisaut sapie. i. cor^ (...) se^tur i. c. iii.
^a^que ^^^lis i xp^o la^ vobis potu^ dedi no^ esca^ mu^du^ ei poteraris

syon of time he should give medycynes pur gatyues / for nature may not work
suddenly / and therefore to give medycyne without dysposycyon is adventure to
lose all / applycacyon. This form ought the physycyan spyrytuall to keep / for
at the beginning of the reduccyon of the syke body that is to understand of
the sinner he ought not to enjoin things of hye perfeccyon or strong / or
hard restytucyons / or sodeyne / but ought him to reduce from little unto more
greater / for to come unto correccyon and amendment / And such doctrine
holds and techeth saint Poul / the true medycyne spyrytuall as it appears by
his wrytynges.

THe. x. rule is to have good knowledge to purge the body of his evil humors /
for of as much as they abound they co^uerten the good meets in to them self
/ wherefore it is to understand that in four manners he may make purgaryon of
evil humour^ / for sometime he does it byneth / and another time by the mouth
/ another time by bledynge / or by seething and by force of fire. applycacyon /
like chynge is it in the deed of the soul / for his purgacyon is made byneth
when the sinner co^sydereth the great and horrible pains of hell the Date
elemosina^ ^ oia mu^dasu^t vob. lu. xi. Purgabit filios leui and co^flabit eos
quasi aurum and quasi argentu^. malachie. te^^io.
which ben maderedy unto syuners / sometime it is made by the opper* part by a
co^syderacyon that he leseth the blyssed royalme of paradyse / by the which
the sinner is moeued to make an entyere and parfyte contessyon / sometime it is
made by alms deed in putting out from him of his goods and of his substance
/ another time by the seething and by the fire of trybulacyon taken and endured
in good pacyence.

THe.xi. rule of a phesycyan is to know the tokenes of death to the end that
he may denou^ce as well unto the pacyence as unto his friends that they
puruayen of the surplus for than the physycyan is at the end of his knowledge
and may never bring again health / wherefore it is to be noted that in a syke
body there may be four tokenes of death corporal. The first is when he felyth
not his sykenes / for then nature is to much low. The second when he has
noshame that a man sees all this members / for shame is the token of good
dysposycyon in blood of person reasonable the which dysposycyon is than
dystroyed. The third when he knows no more those persons the which other
times he knew / for that is a token that the brain and the pryncypall organes
ben lately deed / or excessyuely troubled. The.iiii. is when he is in franesye
/ for then not alonely the brain but with that the heart is in tormente. /
applycacyon. In like wise may a man have four tokenes of the death spyrytuall
of the soul / And of the conscience of the sinner. The first when Amplius
la^a me dn^e ab u^ ^tate m^a ^a pcto^ meo mu^da me etc. qm^ u^ ^tatem mea^ ego
cognosco p^s. l I^^ciu^ salutis est agnicio prope mi^tatis. ^n^.
the sinner knows not his gylte and his sin / it is a token euydent that of
such syknes he may not escape but that he go unto the death eternal / The
second when he has no shame to sin openly The third is when his
affection is in such wise dysordynate and applied unto ill that he has no
knowledge of his deed nor of his peril of his soul and dampnacyon. The fourth
when the sensualyte rules so in him that he has no reason nor strength for to
resyste unto the passions of Ire / of envy / of wrath / of lechery / or other
ye which upon him comes. By these four tokenes a man may know that the syke
body spyrytually is dysposed unto the death of hell.

THe.xii. rule of the physycyan is to know the tokenes of life and of health /
for to denou^ce it unto the pacyent to the end that it him may enjoy and
recomforte in his spyryte the which thing helps much unto the health
corporal By the which it is to be noted that the tokenes for to mow recover
health ben four / The first wha^ the sykenes is mynysshed and that nature is
strengthed those ben tweyne tokenes of health. The third when the matter of the
syknes begins to dygeste. The fourth when by any manner of euacuacyon a man
puts out humors and matters the which causen the syknes. applycacyon. These
four tokenes to recover health spyrytuall be^ showed spyrytually. First when
the person restrayneth and reproves his passions. The second when be him
enforseth to purchasse virtues and good habytuacyons for to resyste. The third
when reason argues and comprehends the inconuenyens ye which may follow
to obey unto his passions sensualles. By the which she requires y^ aid of
god and of his blyssed saints for to resyste again them. The fourth when he
flees unto his power the occasyons of sin as from the place from the time /
from the persons and so of other things the which him may enduce unto
sin. / By these things before said appears in brefe the applycacyon of
medycyne spyrytuall unto the medycyne corporal and who answers of the one
unto the other who so well does unto his prouffyte / health must he have
eternal amen.

Here follows some brefe interrogacyons that a man may make to every good
christian man that a man sees labourynge in the article of death / or the which
if he can or may and first ought for to do.
Christian man / or christian woman believe you sted fastly all ye artycles of the
faith. That is to understand in god the fader ye which is creator of heaven
and of the earth / and of all other things vysyble and inuysyble: Also in Jhesu
christ his sone the which for us has be conceived and borne of the vyrgyn
Mary. The which for us to teache and to again bye has so much suffered of
pain / and finally the death right cruel / and the third day arose / and the
which is styed into heaven / and shall come again to Juge the quycke and the
deed for to yield unto every creator that / that he has deserved. Believe you
that by the grace of the holy ghost the holy church is sustained and
nourysshed and the holy sacraments ordened and that after our descesse we all
shall arise. The answer yes. Be not ye well Joyful to dye in the christian
faith / and in the unity and obedyence of our mother the holy church / The
answer yes. Confess ye to have so poorly lived that you have not deserved
any merit of goodness / and yt ye better should have lived than ye have done /
The answer yes / Knowledge ye that ye have offended your god / your creatur
right often and right grievously / The answer yes. Have not you sorrow and
dyspleaser of all the sins that ye have done and of the godenes that ye have
left to do / of the gifts and of the graces of god the which ye have not
well used answer yes / have not ye good purpose and will you to amend if god
you grant to come unto health. answer yes / pardon you not with good heart for
the love of god all them that you have offended answer yes / require not you
also and demand right humbly pardon and mercy generally of all those yt ye
have offended / answer yes / Believe you well yt for you our lord would dye /
and that otherwise than by his blessed passion ye may not be saved / answer
yes / Of this and of other innumerable graces that he unto you has done and
unto all the world yield ye not him graces and mercy with heart as much as ye
may / if the person may speak with very faith and good conscience with heart
alonely / or with heart and with mouth togyders these things before said / and
answer in like wise as it is said / and in such estate desseaceth / it is a
right great token of salvation. Than the person the which in such wise is
dysposed all holely him ought to reco^mau^de and to committee unto the blyssed
passion of our lord in putting thereto his hope / and not in other merit or
good deed and thereon ought he to think contynually in as much that the syknes
he may endure and bear / for by that been surmou^ted and beten down the diverse
temptacyo^s of the devil of hell / And than a man ought between god the fader
and the greuousnes of ye gylte of his sins put and oppose the death of his
sweet child without otherwise to plead or aledge / and also for the merytes
that he ought to have and that he has not he ought to offer the merytes of
our sauyoure Jhesu christ / the which ben infynyte comen unto all those the
which duly them axe and reclayme and think on him / Or a man should call
unto his mind the story of ye good thief how he knowleged his gylte and his
sin and the swetnes and pity of our lord the which required god the fader
for the sin of those the which him put and held in torments and in
deseases of death / by the which* co^syderacyon he was inspyred to require the
aid of Jhesu christ saying (Memento meidn^e) That is to say lord have pity
and mind of me. The which thing ought he to say unto his power ye which
labors in the extremetes of death / and also ought to say his confyteor /
and after to make protestacyon that he will dye in the troth of the holy faith
catholyque / what so ever illusyon / or freuesaye unto him come in the article
of death. And afterward say in manus tuas dn^e co^mendo spiritum meum etc.

Here folowen. vi. aduysementes right prouffytable for to enduce them that be
living for to dye.
HOr as much as in ye consystorye of the blyssed Caplm xxix.
trynyte is determined irreuocably that it us behooves all to dye and before
god at ye hour of death us represent all and that every creator in pertyculer
for tore^eyue Jugement and fynall sentence of salvation or of da^pnasyon after
at every of them has deserved / it is sovereign wisdom Quocu^que eni^ die
co^ederitis de fru^ tu ligni sci^e boni and mali morte morte mini. g^ene. i. ^
for him to study to dye well. Than for to have some knowledge of peryllous
things ye which comen unto every creator at the hour of death and for to
have matter and exitacyon us to prepayre from day Statutu^e^ hoi^bus semel mori
et post hoc iudiciu^* hebre. ix. c.
to day so that contynually we approach unto that hour right doubfull. Here
folowen syx aduyseme^tes for to conceive fere by the which we may dysprayse
this present world and for to prepayre us to depart surely from this present
life.

THe first auysement is that at the hour of death of every creature is the
end of the world and the great Jugement as unto regard of the sentence / and
of things the which theder comen and ben done unto the case partyculer of the
creature vbi te iuenio ibi te iudicabo.
reasonable / for in yt estate in the which a man is found in that estate and
hour a man is Jugyd and sentence irreuocably unto the which sentence he may
not resyste / let or it dyffer / by science / by puyssau^ce / by love / or by
favor. Alas popes / Emperors / Kings. Dukes / Earls / Barons / and all other
of what so ever preemynence / or condycyons be it a man or a woman / old or
young / all by the condycyouegalle we be now acyted for to appear unto such
and so meruaylous Jugement / And full few there are the which on it thinks
duly The which thing these worldely people shown clearly by their life that
they holden and leden the (which is dampnable / for the more part of them ben
begyled De^s morimut et quast aque delabimur in terra^ ^ no^ reuptta^tur. iii.
reg xiiii. capitulo.
by the temptacyon of the devil the which the^ makes ymagen that they have
true repentance before that they ben presented unto the Jugement of god / and
unto the hour of the death as it is said / wherefore Ducu^t i^ bonis dies suos
and ipu^to ad in ferna desce^du^t. (...). xxi. capitulo.
they doubt not to contynewe their vayn life / seculer and worldly / and when
they comen unto the end they fallen by Justice secret and infynyte in to
dyspayre and by the consequent with Judas ^ac ai^aduersie^ per ^uti^ peto^r vt
morieus obliui scatur su^ ^ du^ viueret et oblitus e^ del. an.
in eternal dampnacyon. By the which it is well and truly said / of good
life good end / of evil comes never good. And unto that purpose make these
theologyens such questyon. That is to understand Decentfi milibus hoibus
quorum vita erriteri^ mala vix rueretur saluari vnus ^a si vix iustus saluabit^
impius and peccator vbi pare bunt.
if the person ye which has led evil life till unto the syknes / or unto
the time of the death may come unto good end and have salvation The answer.
After saint Austen it is not possible but that he the which has been of evil
life may have a good end / but it is right hard for as says Eusebius in one
of his epystles / of an hundred. M persons the which have continued an evil
life comes there one unto a good end. And unto that purpose says Richard de
media villa that the penance is suffycyent unto salvation / when the sinner
has dyspleaser of his sin / and in purpose never to consent unto mortal
sin / and of time paste makes a true confession and an hole or in purpose
that to do in place and in time / and that unto all these things before said
it is moved and enduced pryncypally for the love of god and not pryncypally for
fere to be dampened or for other occasyon seuile or temporal / or else the
penance that a man does in the article of death suffyseth not to get
salvation / and for as much that right few of those the which have been of
evil life have the condycyons before said at the hour of death it follows
that of those the which dyfferre^ and taryen to do true penance till the
bed and at ye time of death full few there aren that be saved / For if it be
so that they have not will to love god faithfully during the time that he
unto them gives so much of his goods and of his graces / as may be y^ body
and the soul / health / prosperyte / of wit of mind of goods erthly /
^other things / how may they him love and reclayme with heart pyteous and
tayth full when he them shall hold in great dysti esle in the prison of
grievous syknes in taking from the^ health plays / dysportes / Joys / and
gladnesses and all pleasures worldly In the which they have put their hertes
and their study. This thing is right hard for to ymagen. That is to
understand that than they love god by true charity the which prouen these
doctors by many reasons / the first is for the great and horiyble passion of
the syknes and of a fere seruyle and hateful in y^ which talleth than the
espyryte humayn the which has not god with him by grace when there come such
necessyte / as Dfie si pauci sunt q^ salua^iur. quame au^t dixit ad illos Lote^
dite itrare per augusta^ port^ dito vovis qr multi quera^t itrare and no^
potuerunt. lu. xiii. c. Ite^. ps. vi. No e^ imorte ^ memor sit tui.
if any had the foot in the tire / or in ye water seething he may not find
his understanding Than for to reknowlege his sins for the great so row that
he suffers / and by the consequente may not have ye dyspleaser ye which is
necessary before yt god pardons ye synnet / and y^ he gives his grace and
therefore says well holy scripture as unto such people they think not on god
suffycyantly for to find grace when the hour of death comes / For Justyce and
reason requyren y^ he the which has no will to recorne unto god by promesses
/ and by gifts / by thretenynges and by increpacyons / yt god has continued
toward some by thyrty / or by fyfty years / more or less / As ben
predycacyo^s / remors of conscience / prosperytes worldly / examples and Qui
fecit tesine tenoiustificabit te sieve te. au. Ite^ greg Justu^ vt ^ noluit
penitere cu^potuit cu^ voluerit sero sit
Jugementes of god they ben comen as in their time as of the death of those the
which they known And parauenture them resemb^n in estate and in manner of
living and in other manners without no^bre unto god called and be not in will
to return during yt he had the time and the hour / by ye which god them
suffers Justly to fall into dampnacion eternal / for he sees and knows in
his science dyuine and infynyte / yt where by. M. of days and of years / he
the^ taryeth / yet ever more they abyden in their obstynacyon / and therefore
notwtstondynge yt when the end comes and their necessyte they them would
confess and amend it is to late for to abide. Also as in all case comenly
such penance proceeds of fere seruyle / as is ye fere pryncypally to be
dampened. and Paucos ex his credo saluari ^ vsque in fine expecta^t iustifica^^.
Ne tardesco^uertiad d^^im nec diffe^as de die i die^. eccle. v. Si mutare po^t
et^iops pelle^ sua^ et perdus varietates suas and vos poteritis v^facere cu^
diceritis malu^. hi^. xiii.
therefore says and byleueth saint Jerome that of such there aren right few
saved / By the which it appears clearly enough y^ he the which dyfferreth
true parfyte penance till unto y^ time of death he him dysposeth unto
da^pnacyon / and does again the admonicyon of y^ holy ghost. The second
lettynge to do true penan^ce when the end of the life comes it is an
habytuacyon of sy^ne the which is in the soul of them the which have longely
continued an evil life. The which habytuacyon is Ha^c ^^adue^sio^e per cuci^
pcto^r vt morie^s obliuisca^ su^ ^du^ viueret oblitus est dei. aug^.
unto them also as natural. By the which it should be a right hard thing it
for to break / dystroye and put away when it comes unto the end and
consu^macyon of the life and there where the person has so little of time and
so many of lettynges that to do. The third lettynge is the temptacyon of y^
devil the which tempts the person at the time of the death more than ever he
had done in the days of his life / and the person him resyste not with
times paste / and in the time of his great knowledge of his health and y^ which
has not deseruyd so much again god as y^ blyssed saints of paradyse to find
aid in yt last necessyte / what may he do in such shortenes of time / and in
such oppress of pains and of te^ptacyons y^ which comes on all parties.
The fourth lettynge is dyffaylynge of wit humayne For in as much ye the
sinner has put his heart and his understanding in things erthly and
transytoryes the which faylen at need ben they women / children / rychesses /
delytes / pleasures / and other goods of this life they fallen in a confusyon
of understanding / and is in a dyspleaser of the Jugement of god. By the
which he them makes to lose and to leave the thing in the which they have
put their love / and their pleasaunce / and by such passions / as well in the
understanding / as in the will they forgeten god and their salvation / By the
which god suffers tyght Justly that they fallen and abyden among the hands
of their en (nemyes / many other great and also as innumerable lettynges comen
unto sinners at the hour of the death when they have been of evil life / And so
appears the troth of the questyon. That is to understand if the sinner the
which has led an evil life till unto the time of his syknes mortal may
come unto salvation and this is as unto the first aduysement.

THe second aduysement is of the mysterye of the two angels of the creature
the which should dye That is to understand of the good and of the evil / for
every person the which has good and reasonable understanding ought to be
aduysed y^ he has a good angel / the which has vnusquis^^ ab exordio vite
su^habz ^onu angel^ custo d^ et malu^ angelu^ excitante. He magister
sentenc^aru^ (...). d^. secundi.
the office and commandment of god him to purge / illumyne and enduce to come
unto perfeccyon. And also him to defend from the devil of hell. And to keep
him from the h^ure of the creacyon of the soul till unto the departing from
ye body the which is the hour of death. And in like wise he has an evil
spyryte for to tempte him and enduce unto all ill and fynably unto dampnacyon
if he may / And a man ought to understand that as w^ll the good angel as the
evil have greter knowledge natural / than ever might have philosopher /
astronomyer / or physycyan / by the which it follows that they may know
naturally y^ complexion the causes / and the greef of the syknes of the person
of whom they have the charge / and the cure* /: That is to understand the
good to enduce him unto salvation. And the cursyd unto dyspayre and unto
eternal dampnacyon. And therefore wha^ ^mnis (...)onis vid^ fine. ^s. ^xviii.
Co^stituite pri^cipem super ^i^ ^ias suscip^ed ^.
the good angel sees / and knows the end and the hour of the death of
such person to be comen / and knows not what shall be the sentence of the
Jugement of god / he shows and brings this matter with the blyssed and
glorious archangell saint Michell unto whom god has given office to receive
the souls the which have obeyed unto the good inspyracyons of the blyssed
angels and than the said archangell gives and assygneth certain nombre of
the chyualry of paradyse unto the said angel for to d^scende and to come unto
ye Jugement of the little world. That is to understood of man and of woman
the which of good right is named and called the little world / for it is the
co^clusyon and co^su^macyon of all the great world / and than the angel so
nobly accompanied more or less after y^ dygnyte of y^ office / or the
prelacyon of the person y^ which ought to be Juged descends and him
presents on the right side. And in like wise the evil spyryte y^ which has
had ye office to tempte that person makes great dylygence to fetch unto
Lucyfer y^ end and the Jugement of ye person yt he has tempted to be come /
and has not than certain knowledge if he shall be saved or dampened for any ill
or sy^ne yt he him has made to do. And tha^ Lucyfer unto hy^ gives company of
deuylles more or less after ye vocacyon and the degree of ye person in like
wise as it is said of ye good angel. and than y^ devil so accompanied comes
and him presents on y^ left side of y^ champyon / be it man or woman yt is
bataylled and than comes as well unto y^ body as unto y^ soul of such
person so great and so Imcompreuable battle of disease / of sorrow / and of
fere / yt there is no tongue nor writing yt it may declare and tell / for there
was never so holy a person y^ by the way of nature and of comen course may be
assured of his case and what shall be the end of his Jugement. And therefore
those ye which ben present at such departing should pray with the company of
holy creatures the which ben presented for the poor creature the which is in
the most great necessyte and dystresse yt ever unto hy^ *may come in this
world / and him they sholden recomforte and enduce unto hope in she wynge him
y^ token of y^ ryghtt pyteous passion of our blyssed sauyoure and rede^ptour
Jhesu christ / the which is the confusyon of deuylles of hell in namynge him
/ or make to speak the name of Jhesus / for tha^ it is no time to bring unto
their mind dettes restytucyons / or the great hates and sins / for that
ought to have be made before yt they were come^ unto such extremyte of pains
and of dyseases y^ which than them holden in all parts. Also it is to be noted
y^ by preuylege synguler god shows unto some holy persons their go de and
holy departing before the hour of their death By y^ which they be not more
ferefull as it is said But they ben in one peace and gladness spyrytuall the
which unto them is now a begynnyge of glory / O very fader omnipotent what
have we this hour and this battle before our eyes of our understanding for
to arm us with merytes and with virtues and for to dyspose us and to deserve
agay^ the saints of paradyse and syngulerly again y^ virgin Mary to mo we

things it shall behoue to yield acompte right straytly / as shall be said here

THe third aduysement is that every creature ben they good or evil shall se

sayen unto god the fader (Pater in manus tuas co^mendo spiritum meum) wherefore
it is well to be noted that the person so approchynge unto y^ death comes unto
such passage that he leseth the usage of his five wits of nature all holly /
for if all the bellys and bombardes of the world sowned in his ere he them
hereth not / and so of the sight and of other wits unto regard of sight / of
feeling / of smelling / and of tastynge / and than in that moment yt the yates
of the body. That is to understand the five wits ben closed / the yates of
his soul yet being in his body ben open / for than the soul sees all
clearly the blyssed Jhesu christ in the form and estate as it is said before /
Also she sees her holy angel with great company of glorious spyrytes / And
also sees the devil and his compa^y the which all abyden the sentence dyuyne
/ be if* of salvation or of dampnacyon and than the bokesben open / for the
soul be it good / or evil seeing the blyssed Ihesu christ the which is named
truly the book of life writes within and without sees than clearly all y^
process of his life / for never had he thought in his life but than thereof
than she has clear knowledge of all togyders and of every of them in
partyculer weren they good or evil. And in like wise of delyres of wyiles /
and of words and by a more greter reason of all his works ben they good or
ill and of the good deeds of the which a man has had oportunyte to do and
that aman has not done / and also in like wise of the evil. and all these
things shall be weyed and examyned by the Just balau^ce of the Justice
dyuyne. and than many things the which seems to be gold / silver / precious
stones after the Judgment humayne shall not be but donge / earth / and caryn.
That is to say that many semen unto ye world to be of great devotion and of
great perfeccyon shall be than known to be full of ypocresye and of
abhomynacyon here rynnen to socours / ye right glorious virgyn mary and the
holy saints of paradyse / unto whom the person has done honor and service
in his life / and also the good works and merytes that a man has purchased
during that a man has had time and space. And those the which have not
deseruyd to be aided suffysen not to answer / or them to excuse. O very god
the which sercheste and examynest the hertes / the synewes / ye (...) veins
and the mouynges of the bones of humayns. That is to say the causes / ye
reasons and the intencyons / and these other cyrcu^staunces of deeds humayns /
what shall he be that may tha^ answer before thyn right holy face / before the
holy angels / and before the deuylles. Also shall be demanded reason and a
compte of all the time of our life and so till / unto the shettynge of the eye.
And of all the goods ye which unto us has been given in our life ben they
gifts of grace / of nature / or of fortune / as we them have used be it Qui
g^abitu^ (...) mu^du^ se h^e. cori.
in prosperyte / or aduersyte. Alas more than a. M. times alas / Alas what may
than answer those the which so folysshely and so vaynly passen and so lesen
the time of mercy / and therefore at ye hour of death the soul be it good or
evil / shall see and know by the puyssaunce dyuyne all the process of his life
/ for the book of his conscience unto him shall be showed so clearly that by
the bou^te / pity / and mercy of god she is of the nombre of the saved / or
that by the Justice dyuyne she ought to be Justly condampned and delivered unto
the deuylles for his defaute and right cursyd life. And this is as unto the
third aduysement.

THe fourth aduysement is of the sentence of the Judge / for than our lord
shall appear so terry^^e unto them that have not deserved saluacy on that none
vnderstondy^ge suffyseth it to ymage^ Rebrobi malent o^^e torme^tu^ sust^ nere

And therefore says well saint Austen that there is no torment in the world
that is so hard to endure as is to be presented before ye face of Ihesu christ
and has deserved his Ire / and his maledyccyon / for he shall reproach unto
the cursyd / their sins great and horrible geuyng unto them clear knowledge of
their unkindness / and how they have him crucyfyed Uoc^ui and re niuistis

which he gives his flesh and his blood they ben returned unto their sy^nes

show clearly the myste^ye of his blyssed in carnacyon / and of his passion /

things they have dyspraysed in as much that they have not them used unto
salvation. and therefore in that last hour right Justly he them dyspraysynge

unto the soul dampened Depart thou forthwith / with thy body cursyd creature /
and go thou unto the fire of hell and unto the torments eternal / the which
unto the ben made redye / and the which thou have* Justly deserved with the
spyrytes dampened unto temptacyons of whom thou haste wylled to obey / Than
the soul accursyd is constrained to depart from the body / and seeing that
she is in the bond and maledyccyon of god / and more over sees the cruel best
enraged / that is the devil of hell y^ which is ready and in awaytynge her to
receive. Than fynably she her torneth and co^uerteth toward her holy angel
the which always till unto yt hour has her defended from yt evil enemy in
desiring naturally yet to have socoure and defense. But the good angel in
approuynge ye right Just sentence of god unto him says / Go thou with the
devil acursyd by the sentence of the blyssed Trynyte and of all the company of
heaven / for thou haste not in time passed wylled for to know thy creator /
and the seruy^e yt to the has be done by his commandment in defending y^
from the aduersytes and in procuring the to remors of conscience and
inspyracyons to do well / and to leave sin / but you m^ haste refused / and
therefore now of good right god and every holy creature ye ought well to
refuse / and there with all ye to leave unto those unto whom thou haste obeyed
and than ye poor soul seeing that she has not socours nor aid in heaven nor
in earth / and that she may not flee nor auoy de the hand and puyssaunce of
deuylles the which ben present as these slawghter men of hell for to execute
the sentence dyuyne makes so great acrye spyrytuall and makes so great sorrow
and so great complaynt / as says the book of angels that there is no
torment in this world that a man or a woman ne bears more easily than to see
the pyteous departing of the soul and of his holy angel Opyteous hertes
humayns why have not you regard in this matter that may have remedy unto such
in conuenyent / for if a person had done all the sins that ever were done /
so may she during the time of mercy do penance and amendment / By the
which she may euade and escape ye and has deserved his Ire / and his
maledyccyon / for he shall reproach unto the cursyd / their sins great and

deuylles of hell done in taking the possessyon and seasyne of the soul
condemned the which is a thing pyteous and also to marvel* yt by writing
it can not be duly spoken nor recompted / for than she takes and receives
for heritage eternal pains of hell declared in the treatise following unto
whom it shall please also them to see. Alas well may she curse the hour of
her creacyon when by his defaute he leseth the royalme of paradyse and falls
in to the furoure of god and of his enemies.

THe fyfth aduysement is unto the regard Qui hol mor^enti apparuit jesus xp^s

of the soul the which has deserved salvation / for she being in the
battle of death as it has be said before. Incontinent that she sees the
blessed sweet Jhesu christ in the form and manner that has been said. That is
to understand in the estate that he was in at the hour that his right holy
soul was departed. She shall know clearly that by the bou^te and mercy of god
and ye merit of his passion she is of the nombre of the saved and shall see
manyfestly and openly the ylles that she has euaded and escaped and all the
means / By the which she shall come unto such end / as it shall be to have
believe unto good inspyracyons of his holy angel and to have fere and love god
in keeping and acco^plysshynge his holy co^man^dementes for else it had be
impossyble for to come unto a good end And the blyssed sweet Jhesu christ his
god / his love / his espouse him shall comfort of pains / of sorrows / of the
fere / and of the doubt and of the peril from whom she came / and so shall
be assured of the devil the which than shall be all confused seeing and
knowing that he has lost his pray and that the holy person / be it man or
woman / him vaynquyssed in deseruynge to have the royal me and glory of
paradyse / The which he has lost by his pride and defaute / none
understanding ne may comprehend. No clerk worth^ly express the Joye and
exaltacyon the which than comes unto the soul the which has deserved to be
of the nombre and of the company of them that be chose^ For she her sees and
knows the espouse of Jhesu christ / And by the consequent queen of paradyse
And therefore Jhesu christ in ^allynge her / unto her says right gracyously
come you* with me mine espouse. Also she her sees so much loved of Jhesu
christ the which has wylled to suffer death and passion for her on the tree of
the cross / and in the manner in the which he appeared than as if he would say
unto the soul / Reknowlege right dear creature that by this passion how much
I you desire and love for no creature may not more strongly love tha^ to will
to dye wylfully for the love of his friend. / Also she sees the humanyte united
with the deyte in the person of his love and of his espouse / by the which
she knows to be the daughter / sister and love of the king of glory and
honored more than nature angelyque as unto that. And therefore Jhesu christ in
calling yet again unto her says (...) mei ^ul santis aperi mic^i soror^^a
amica^^a colu^ba mea imacu lat^ ^ea. ca^t^. v.
Come unto me my sister and my dou^ / and than the blyssed soul so departs
unto the voice of her love the which calls so swetely / she her departs and
leueth her body and her represents unto hy^ unto his blyssed pleaser and
commandment / and than all the angels and saints of paradyse receyuen a
new iubylacyon in gyuynge praysynges and graces unto the creature the which
by his mercy has given such aid and comfort unto his creature that she is
escaped vyctoryo^sly the devil of hell / the world / and the fless^^ / and
than the glorious angels right reverently taken the daughter of god the fader
/ and the love of god the sone y^ temple and habytacle of the blyssed holy
ghost and her conduyteth Joyously in to the possessyon eternal of the royalme
of parady^e the which from the beginning of the world unto him has been
prepared promyssed and given. O he^te faithful and pyteous and of the virtue of
the faith yllumyned ymagyned / contemple / and esmeruayll the great and
incompreuable dyfference the which is at y^ hour of death / between the good
soul and the evil For in like wise as the death is the yate of paradyse unto
the good soul. Also is it the yate of hell unto the evil / Come with me
blyssed of god my fader. And by the contrary he says unto evil / Go thou unto
the devil acursyd and seperat from all the blyssed trynyte. And even in like
wise as these holy angels taken accompanyen and comfort the good soul of
Joye inestymable. In semblable ^yse by the contrary the deuylle^ taken / and
deuouren the soul of the dampened in gyuynge unto her fere disease / and
torments without end and without relesynge / And this dyfference appears
more plainly unto him that will read and consider the treatise of the pains of
hell / and of y^ Joys of paradyse.

THe syxte aduysement is of the estate of purgatory / of the which every man
ought to vn^e^stonde that it is one part of hell and the place of right
maruayl^us pain / For first the soule^ the which be^ in that torment ben
boldyd and tarried to see the ensence dyuyne / the which unto them is noysau^t
incompreuable / Also they ben in affleccio^ of fire and of torments much
sharp / or of other pains after the Jugement dyuyne. Whereof says saint
Bernarde in his wrytynges / that the pain of purgatory of one day
surmou^teth the pain y^ which all martres and other saints of paradyse have
suffered / For the Justyce dyuyne punyssheth otherwise in the other world. And
therefore says saint Austen that a man may more acquyte of the pain due unto
sin by weeping one ^ere in this present life than a man should do in ten
years by y^ pain of purgatory / for as much that a man is in the other world
in the court of Justyce. And in this world a man is in the court of mercy /
of that place and of that estate has full few y^ knowledge y^ co^munyte of
christian people y^ which lyuen at this day y^ which will not fast / or do
other penance y^ which little does for any manner of s^ne that they have
committed. how be it it behooves to do dygne penance in this world or in the
other. And therefore says well saint Gregorye and saint Ambrose that a man
fyndeth in paradyse more of saved the which have kept y^ innocence of baptem
than of those the which have longely lived / and does such penance of their
sins that after the death they should not be holden in purgatory and
notwithstondynge their great pain / how be it be they certain that they shall
be saved / And they ben visyted by those angels of paradyse and aided right
gretely as well by the blyssed saints unto who me they have had deuoeyon and
done service in this w^rlde as by the suffrages and orysons of holy church /
for as much as those of paradyse and of purgatory / And those the which yet
ben in this present life in the estate of grace ben one body mystical in Jhesu
christ by the union of charity / for all these before said have the blyssed
holy ghost by grace / for if the one membre serve unto the other naturally by
more stronger reason the saints of paradyse may aid as well unto us the which
ben in this world for to praise them and reclayme as unto the^ of purgatory
the which have deserved on this halue to be aided / For comenly after as some
does their devour to pray and to acquyte the^ agay^ the^ yt ben departed / In
like wise shall it be done for hy^ after his death Also these doctors sayen
that they of purgatory prayen for us y^ which ben in this world and yt much
of goods corporal and spyrytuall unto us come^ by y^ merytes and oryso^s of
faith full people departed / specially when we do our de uoure again them and
by the contrary those y^ which them dyffrauden as done these possessours the
which posseden / lauds / rentes / and houses / be it in little / or in great
ye which to them be come and succeed from their friends / and predecessors
departed. / and as ben those y^ which ben charged of y^ execucio^ of
testamentes / and to do alms ordoned by the last will of y^ deed / and also
as done people of the church he which posseden rentes / lauds / and renownes
/ and which have been given and ordened comenly for to ^o coure and aid those
yt ben departed. Also as ben these beggars ben they relegyous or other the
which live of daily alms / Of all these manner of people playnen they of
purgatory and requyren y^ vengeance of god / for those the which them may
and should aid as well by y^ oblygacyon of right of nature / as of y^
ordenau^ce of holy church the^ leven tormented cruelly / notwtstondynge y^
they cryen in demau^dynge aid co^tynually and in sayen (Miserem^^i mei salte^
vocis amici mei) That is to say / have pity have mercy / have mercy on me / at
y^ leest ye my sons and daughters / nyeces and neuewes / cosyn and cosy^s /
and ye other unto whom I have left my goods / and for to understand y^
crudelyte of many again the yt ben departed / we ymagen y^ when y^ sone or the
daughter / or other friend seen their fader or mother or sister or other friend
in any cruel torment as of fire / or of water boyllynge / and the^ they may
aid. Nevertheless they take no head nor dylygence to so cour the^. shewe^ they
not clearly to be cruel and dygne of y^ vengeance of god / and certainly we
may say by more greter reason y^ they ben right cruel. and in the Ire of god
y^ which acquyte them not again In firmus and i carcere era^ et no^ visita

them departed after yt yt they ben beholden more or less / for at yt end of
their life our lord unto the^ shall say / I have be^ in hard prison and ye
have not vysyte me / comforted nor taken pain to deliver me and than they
shall answer / when see we ye in pryso^ or in such necessyte / and than he
unto the^ shall say. that yt ye have not wylled to do unto my me^bres to my
chylder and to my friends y^ which were in hard prison were it in ye world /

to what vsages gone at this day ye gods by the which a man should aid the^
yt ben departed / well should I tell it if I were not constrained to keep ye
half hour of silence yt him behooves to endure in these present days. Those
ye which done well their devour for the^ yt be^ departed purchasen great aid

purgatory of one departed or of many by the which they comen the more sooner
sometime of a year more or less unto ye vysyon of god and of ye vyrgyn Mary and
to possede the glory and the royalme of paradyse / it shall never be but that
these blyssed holy saints men or women the which in such have been aided /
and made shortene hold the^ redeuables and bound unto him or unto them the
which them so have socoured in their necessyte and aided the more sooner for
to come unto the glory before said / for in like wise as a man speaks and
writes other times some the which now ben in ye glory of paradyse / to see
the vyrgyn Mary by the espace of one year alonely in the glory of her majesty
is so great goodness yt a man should Joyfully endure. all the marterdomes that
have been suffered in this present world with all the martres and other say^tes
of paradyse for to come unto such goodness as it should be to see the vyrgyn
Marye in so little time unto the which vy syon us will bring for eternyte her
dear child the sweet Jhesns unto whom be honor and glory in secula
seculorum amen bone Jhesu.

Here follows the fyfth and final party of this book in the which is made
mencyon of ye pains of hell and of the Joys of paradyse and first of the
pains of hell.


FOr as much that every good person humaynehym ought to conform after as it
is of reason unto the will dyuyne the which is such That is to know yt we
eschew all ill and y^ we us enforce to prouffyte in virtues and in good works
unto the which thing to do we be induced naturally / by fere in regard to
purchase merits and virtues. Here follows thetreatyse of ye pains of hell
and of the Joys of paradyse the which is ye In oibus operibus tuis memorare
nouissima and i^eternu^ non peccabis. eccle. vii.
fyfth and the last party of this book / by the consyderacyon of the which
we have the souerayn matter and occasyon the which may be found / or ymagened
for to fere / and for to love. That is to understand for to fere the pains of
hell / and for to love and desire the glory of paradyse. The which thing to
do ye holy scripture us has warned the which says that if we consider well
the things last or extreme / we should never do sin wherefore it is to be
noted that hell and paradyse ben named the extremites / or the things last y^
we should think and consider that they ben right extreme in comparyson of this
present world as unto the sytuacyon of the place and as unto their qualytes as
unto the place and sytuacyon / for this present world is between hell and
paradyse / and for as much that every thyngemeane has comparyson and
partycypacyon with his extremytes / we se sensybly that in this world there
are many of ylles /. and many of goodnesses / for there are ylles as well of
culpe as of pain. That is to understood cold and hete / wyndes / raynes /
hayles / thonder / lightening / and other tempests / as well upon the sea as
upon the land / Also honger / thruste / and syknesses of diverse condycyons /
As ben fevers / styches / goutes / botches / and rottynges of members /
swellynges / venymes / and apostumes. Also wars batayles / dyuysyons /
mortalytes / famynes and other ylles innumerable / the which ben noisome and
adversaries of the body. Also of the party of the soul there are ylles of
sy^ne and of culpe great and without number / and temptacyons the which comen
unto some by cause of their diverse occupacyons worldely / these other of the
cautelle and malice of the devil / these other by cause of our own
inclynacyons and of the corrupcyon and fragylyte humane. By the which the
esperyte humayne falls in to heaviness / and thought / and indesmaye / in Ire /

in malancoly / and also in sins detestables and more horrible than
understanding may understand / or ymagen. And also those things bensom what
fygured / with representacyon and royal representacyon of the extremyte of
pains and of torments the which ben in hell without end. Also on the other
par^e we see in some persons of this world / Joye / gladness / health / beauty
/ honors / rychesses / pleasures / dysportes / games / and delytes* after the
desires of heart humayne / and fornycacyon of the pleaser of creatures. As
delectable odor of the sauoure of diverse fruytes / wynes / meets / and the
delectacyon the which is in pleasant touchynges. Also in the sound and
melodye / of dyue^s sou^des / as well of Instruments musyques / as in the
Joyous modulacyon of voice humayne and other things pleasauntes and
delectables / as well unto the five wits of nature / as unto all the
puyssau^ces of the soul. The which things ben the symelytude and
representacyon of the glory and beatytude of paradyse. By the which it
appears clearly that in this world all is meddled. That is to understand

good and ill / as death and life / health and sykenes pouerte / and richesse /
sorrow and gladness. and so of all other things contraryes and opposytes by
such condycyon how be it y^ in this world there is no good parfayte / but
alonely is found and ho^ed in paradyse. In like wise the ylles and
trybulacyons of this world be not ylles souerayns and extremes / but ben
alonely found of the dampened in hell / and therefore the god of nature the
which puts order and reason in every creature and yeldeth and brings
every thing unto the end and Ode^t peccate m^i formid^e pene o^eru^t

and recyte for to put us in fere and love the which ben the two rotes for to
flee and to leave all ill / and to take the pain to Ecce ipsi pcto^res and

do well. And first of the pains of hell. and secondely of the Joys of
paradyse. As unto ye first it is to understand yt no christian man ne ought to
doubt but yt in hell there is prepayred pain eternal. unto those the which
refusen and dyfferren to do yt / yt is unto their salvation in the shortenes of
this life / for it is the troth anou^ced by the holy scryptures and prechynges
by the mouth of Jhesu christ and a thing confermed in the light of reason.
The holy scryptures the which wytnessen that in hell / and the eternal
pains of it the which ben reserved unto the cursyd ben enough manyfeste. The
reason unto that may be such. Syns it is so that god is of Justyce infynyte /
it is impossyble but that such Justyce ordeneth and suffers that every sin
be right Justely punysshed. The which thing is not always done in this
world / For of the more comen course the most gretest sinners / have the most
of felycyte worldly. By the which it behooves Malal^^^nidicere vel cogitare

to conclude that they shall be punysshed in the other. Of the which punycyon
it behooves to see first in general and afterward more in especyall. As unto
the generalyte of the pains of hell comen unto purpose / the saying of saint
Austen in the book named de tribus habitaculis. In ye which is declared that
none understanding create suffyseth for to think / or ymagen y^ torments of
hell and of eternal dampnacyon such as they ben / for they ben right more
grievous and excess if than may be spoken or thought / and how be it an hye and
a fair understanding may think pains and formentes much to meruayll / as
should be the bytternes and horrybylyte to see in fire / or in metal molten
with out having power to taste the death the which is than in hell of as much
or more desired of the dampened the which is not in this world redoubted / and
of good right unto them it is denied For as much that in this world they have

consider the generalyte / the dyuersyte / and the eternyte of the said pains
the which* the dampened suffren as well unto the body as unto all the
puyssaunces of the soul in such rayge and varyacyon mayntenau^t of cold and
after of hete that every understanding there fails. Also the wepynges and

that / that the dampened mayen by length of eternyte be enhardened or acustumed
for the less greffe them to endure and bear. Also a man may consider ^ich^^
ardet ^^^e^ no nisi propria vol^^as. aug.
the remors and the dyspleasures that these dampened have. When they known
certainly that they had been saved if they had would / and for a momente of
the pleasure of this present world they ben given unto such inco^uenyent
that never in their case there is no hope nor abydyng of reparacyon and many of
other such contemplacyons may be ymagyned by intent humayne and how be it as
says saint Austen in the book before said that it is as nothing in compa^yson
of the deed and of the royalte of that / yt suffren the dampened and yt
notwithstondynge yet we should us enforce after our little and obscure capacyte
to understand and think that / yt by the holy scryptures unto us has be
given and showed / for the fere yt we seche by this co^syderacyon comes and
proceeds when a man apprehends and takes by understanding some thing
terryble and of as much that a man considers and that a man understands
such thing horrible more in special and in partyculer of as much conceyueth
a man the more greter fere. and for as much that in the second point the
which is the consyderacyon of the said pains in partyculer mouynge the aid
of the holy ghost. I shall reher^e ten pains pryncypalles of the party of the
body and ten other of the party of the soul. And every of the twenty pains
is dyuysed in four / and so there shall be four and twenty pains partyculers
taken of ye pains infynyte and without nombre that suffren and shall suffer
ever without end (these cursyd dampened souls / by the consyderacyon of the
which the heart humayn the which them will read or harken shall be to much
enhardened and tayde of the bonds of the fend of hell the which conceyueth
not fere / and trembling for to come after the shortenes of this present life
unto such and so horrible tormente.

Here follows the ten pains of the party of ye body that these dampened
suffren in hell and every of the^ devised in four and so they ben. xl. pains.
THe first is fire right cruelly bre^nynge. The second is cold so much
fresynge. The third great cries of dolor without ceassynge The fourth smoke the
which may not in hell be left. The fyfth odoure and stynkynge much horrible
The syxte vysyon of deuylles terryble. The seventh hungre tormentynge cruelly.
The.viii. thruste y^ which tormenteth in like wise The.ix. great shame and
confusyon. The tenth in all his members afflyccyon.
THe first pain is of fire brennynge of the which it is to understand yt
notwithstondynge yt the fire of hell is a thing corporal and of ye same
nature as is yt of this world / how be it they dyfferen in four things. The
first is in sharpenes of hete / for it is more hot than is ours / of as
much as ours is more hoter than yt the which is painted on a wall after as
says saint Austen the which is none other thing to understand but y^ we be
not suffycyent for to ymagen the excess of ye fire of hell in regard and
comparyson of ours. Of the which ever more we have so meruaylous experyens
that there is no metal / ne other thing but that it melts / brenneth / or
altreth / and therefore esmeruayll ye torment of the fire of hell what it may
be. The second dyfference of the fire of hell / and of ours / is as unto the
hardenes for ours is in being lesseth and consumes his matter / but that of
hell is eternal / and never lesseth / For for ever her matter shall endure*
That is to understand the body and ye soul of dampened sinners them holden
always in one manner. Thyrdly they dyfferen in light / for how be it that /
that of hell is great and brennynge ever more / y et it yeldeth no light the
which is any thing plea saunt / but all the sight and light the which is in
hell / it is for to torment grievously those yt ben dampened. Fourthly they
dyfferen / for it conserueth in being ye thing that it brenneth and boyleth
to change in to ashes / or in to other nature. By these four things
appears that none understanding is suffycyent to comprehend the horrybylyte
of such tormente.

THe second pain is of water cold / and dyffereth from that of this present
world in four things. The first is oppress of cold / for like wise as the
brennynge of the fire of hell surmounteth the brennynge of ours / even so the
cold in the other world surmounteth the cold in this world by such manner
that if the most greteste mountain of the world were of yren massyf and
embrased as was ever stele for to forge / and it were put in the tormente of
the ponde of yse in the coldenes of hell^ / it should be from part to part
yse. also as in a moment. And therefore says well saint Gregorye that such
cold is intolerable / and if a man demand wherefore our lord says not as
well in the gospel / depart you from me acursed dampened and go ye in to the
cold eternal as he says into the fire eternal. The answer / for asomoche
as the fire among other elements is y^ most actyf and the most afflyctyf /
therefore god unto us gives example of fire more sooner than of the yse. I put
that he it gives enough to understand by other places of y^ gospel / where
he says that these dampened shall weep and shall grynde their teeth for
coldenes. The second dyffere^ce of ye water of hell and of this world is for
y^ of hell never chauffeth for any thing hot y^ which unto it may be given /
but ever more abides in one estate and degree of coldenes. The third
dyfference is that / yt of hell is evermore trouble full of stenche and
incomparable error: The fourth dyfference is for that hell makes not these
dampened to dye but in like wise as these fysshes lyuen in the water in this
world / so these dampened may not dye in the water in that world.

THe third pain is to cry and to braye in weeping and in playnynge ye which
torment is the cause for four things. Therefore as much that the dampened
known that they shall never se god / the which is the most gretest pain of
hell for these saved / or these dampened love better to be in hell for ever /
and to see god than to be in paradyse and see him not if such thing were
possible And in such wise yt none ne may speak nor think the melodye the
which is made in paradyse as well of the blyssed angels as of holy men and
women yblyssed. In like wise there is none that may declare the pyteous and
horrible try and howlynge the which is made in hell as well of deuylles / as
of other dampened / And if a man demand what they say in cryenge. The
answer. All the dampened cursen the creature. Also they curse togyders / as
their fader and mother / and the hour that they were begoten / that they were
borne / and that they were put unto nourysshynge / and those y^ them should
correct and teache / and also those that have been the occasyon of their sins
/ as the baude cursyd be the baude / and also of other occasyons in diverse
sins. The second cause of the cry of them dampened is for the consyderacyon
that they have of the time of mercy the which is paste. In ye which they may
do penance and purchase paradyse / The third cause is of their cry for by
cause of y^ horrible pains that they enduren. As we may co^sydere that if an
hundredth persons had every of them one foot and one hand in the fire or in
the water seething without power to dye / what bruyt and what cry they should
make / but that should be less than nothing in comparyson of deuylles and of
other dampened / for they ben more than an hundredth thousand thousands the
which all-togyders unto them does noysau^ce / and all in one thondre cryenge
and brayen horrybly. The fourth reason of such clamoure is for as much that
they be^ dyspeyred for ever to have remedy. A man may demand how that may be
as after the Justyce dyuyne that for one oonly sin the which has be so sone
done and so lightly committee a. soul the which has been of god so much
beloved the which unto the image of himself has be made and fermed is dampened
eternally unto so great depnes and confusyon of pains and torments. The
answer may be made by the example of a byeng of an heritage the which is done
in a little time and how be it he gives the right of possessyon in perpetuyte.
In like wise the sinner sells his soul and the right that he has unto ye
royalme of paradyse in little while. By the which he is dysenheryte for ever /
and unto eternyte of pains condampned. Also a stroke is sone stryken whereof ye
death follows without ever to recover the life. Also a man is anon fallen in
to such a dytche so yt the arysynge is impossyble. The answer by reasons the
sinners the which in their end have be found in sin mortal have sin in
eternyte for if they had lived in this world ever more had they continued
their sy^ne. By the which of good right they should have pain without end.
Also after the death the soul and the will ben innuuables be it in good or in
ill. And for as much that the cursyd will of those that be dampened dureth and
perseuereth in her iniquyte she ought for ever more to abide in pains also the
sin in the which ye dampened ben deed / is again the god of eternyte / By
the which after Justyce eternal and infynyte the pain ought to be without
end. Also for a little time of true penance / or of a good work done in the
estate of grace / god gives in eternyte y^ royalme of paradyse / by the which
Justyce it requires that in like wise / also for one oonly sin mortal of
the which a man might in lycell time do penance is given pain eternal and
of yt eternyte of pains shall be spoken after more play^ly.

THe fourth pain is smoke. By the which it is to understand that even in
like wise as smoke herebyneth is the cause of the thyknes of the fire from
whens it shows derke and black and ingendreth stenche and prycketh the eyes
/ procures terys / lets the sight and hurts ye brain So in showing that
of all pains possybles there are in hell abundau^ce. The holy scripture says
^laye. lxvi. Fumus erit in furore meo fumus arde^s tota die.
that in hell is smoke the which proceeds of four things / first of the
place infecte and stynkynge / where there are so many of fylthes / and dyrte /
as sins again the law of god / sins indycybles sins again nature /
rebellyons / obstynacyons / impenyta^ce / and cursyd example and doctrine
showed ysa. vi. Domus iplera e^ fumo. and ^s. xvii. ^sce^dit fumus in i^a eius:
unto young people. of ye which ylles in this world the smoke / yt is the
reno^me ye which is so much fylthy and dangerous and for yt / yt in hell ever
more it wexeth grene and abou^deth therefore ever more there is it and
increases. And how be it yt in hell there is great Hiere. xx. Male dicta
dies iqua natus sum and in qua (...) perit me matter mea.
fire and horrible / it consumes not the said smoke. but ever more it
augme^teth. Secondly it proceeds of the matter the which there is burnt / for
even in like wise as nothing enters in to paradyse but that is pure and clean
/ even so in hell enters nothing but stenche and dyrte / whereof the smoke
may not be but inuysyble / and so as these sins on this halue / blyndeth and
lets the understanding so ye smoke of ye fire of hell in ye quenches
their true knowledge in such wise that they dyspysen / Job. xli. De naribus
eius procedit fumus. apo. x. De ore eius percedebat ignus fumus et fulfur.
and dyspraysen / and cursen their Justyce / they curse also fader and mother
and all their friends. the third thing whereof the said smoke proceeds is of
the assystence and presence in the said place of hell / for by the experyens
wese that in places where Apo. xiii Fumus tor me^to^ eius asce^dit in secula
seculoru^.
ben people infecte / foul and stynkynge / of their nose / of their bodies of
their clothy^ges / proceeds smoke / and odoure engendrynge heaviness / and
makes him that may to fle the place. In like wise of deuylles and of the
dampened proceeds / for they ben full of all uncleanliness and smoke being full
of sorrow / and the which engenders derkenesses outward / and vnfelynge. The
fourth thing whereof proceeds the habundau^ce of the said smoke / is that in
the said place of hell there is no way nor other place from whens it may
depart / but from the time that the cursyd angels were create / and they
rebelled again god / and that Cayme ye which was the first dampened of men /
all ye smokes ben abiding there. Than I rest that ye place is much blind
derke dyspleasau^t and noyfull

THe fyfth pain is odor stynkynge and horrible cause of four parts. The
first party shall be for as much yt all the stynkynge things that ever were
or ever shall be. Than shall be assembled and cast in to the dytche of hell.
And a body humayne the which rotteth in a way / or in a quarefoure of a town
without being buried is so great stynche specially in the time of great hete
that such stynche rotteth and enpoysoneth all ye enhabytances of a cite. What
may that be of the multitude of the bodies of all the dampened / lecherous
people ydolatres / and other without nombre the which shall be wors than roten
in the fire and in the smoke the which may not out of hell avoid think who
so can. The second pain shall be of sulfre embrased after as says holy
scripture. / The third shall be of the flesh humayne as it is said the
which after the dyuersyte and greuousnes of sins shall be stynkyng more or
less / the fourth shall proceed of the presence of deuylles of the stenche of
whom god has showed many examples as it apereth in the legende of saint
Martyn y^ when they appeared in this world they left astynche intolerable.

THe syxte pain is of the vysyon of deuylles vide^tes turbabu^^ ^more
horribili and miserabuntur etc. Cap. v.
the which causen unto the dampened four manner of pains. The first is fere
and trembly^ge / for if a man fere much to see / or to mete a dog / or a
lion enraged / or other creature foul / cruel and ghastly / what may that be to
see contynually all the deuylles / for a man fyndeth in writing yt if any
person mortal see one oonly in that figure that these dampened the^ seen it
should suffyce for to make him dye / or for to be mad and to lose al his
understanding. The second pain the which gives such vysyon unto the
dampened is contynuall reproach of sins that they them have made to acompte.
The third shall be flagellacyons and torments inexplycables it without end
or with out releasynge. The fourth shall be that they shall foil and threste all
the dampened togyders and in more greter dystresse tha^ ever were stones in a
wall or in other thing by forceof engyne of pressures.

THe seventh pain is hongre imcompreuable Fame^ pacientur vt canes ^s. lviii.

for four things. The first for unto such hongre by no mean these dampened
ne may have remedy. The second / for thing the which is in hell has not
dysposycyon for to be satyfyed The third for the remembrance that they have
of the delight that they were wont to take for to ete The fourth for as much
that they know such hongre shall never cease and so they know well that
these torments before said and those the which folowen ben come in nature
humayne. By the occasyon of cursyd eetynge of the fruit yt god had defendyd
unto our fore faders.

THe. viii. pain is of thruste inestymable the which tormenteth not alonely
the tongue / the throat / or the mouth / but with that all the parties of the
body without and within and such torment comes by four things. The first
for as much that the dampened have water presented of the which they may not
taste. The second for as much that in such thruste there is no release / or
hope for any time to come / of that torment says Ihesu christ in the gospel
yt the cursyd rich man required the days of Abraham one poor and little
Pater abraho^mit te lazaru^ vt ^tigat extre mu^digiti s^^^ aqua vt refrigeret
li^gua^ mea^^a cruci or ^ha^ fla^ma. luce ^ vncapitulo.
drop of water and never might he have it / nor never shall he have it* a
man fyndeth in wryty^ge that the said cursyd rich man had to name Tantalus
and was of the people of hebryeus the which thing men afferme for as much as
he called Abraham his fader* and he was four ho^dreth year before the coming
of Ihesu christ and in the time of the great physosypher Arystole / and
euersyns / nor never shall cease to dye and for to enrage for thruste. In the
which it appears how yt Horre^du^ e^ incide^e ^ manu de^v^^e^ t^s. ^^e. x.
it is great error for to fall in the Justice dyuyne / The third is for a
savor that these dampened have in their taste the which is made and composed
of galle and of the bitter things of hell the which holy scripture names ye
galle of dragons the which is a torment in explymable / for in like Fell
dra^ho^u^ vi^^u^ eo^^ venenu^ aspidu^ ^ sana^ile. de vtero. xxxiii. Per que^s

as in this world it is a thing much pleasant as to taste and savor
precious wynes and delycyous meets. Also in the other world it is a thing
much cruelle as the tormente the which is to taste. /: The fourth is a rage
the which is of the teeth / for in like wise as the teeth have been somewhat an
instrument to taste / they ben in the other world an instrument for to
tormente.

THe. ix. is a pain right excessyue for four reasons. The first / for they
shall be en-treated right cruelly. The second by cause of the place the which
is right vile and right stynkynge. The third for they shall be in seruytude of
the right ill sauoure that is of ye deuylles and unto the sins the which
they have loved. The fourth for the company / for every of the dampened has
partyculer pain for the presence and dampnacyon of the other / as well of
deuylles as of the men and women.

THe tenth pain of those that been dampened is as unto the touching / for all
the parties of the body of them dampened ben more tender as to be hurted and
dyseased than they were in this world when by botches and apostumes they were
half ^oten and that notwithstondynge they shall have agreuaunce of four
parties. The first shall be of the ponderosyte and collygacyon from the one
membre unto the other the which is of as much great greuaunce / as the health
and the good dysposycyon was the comfort and aid of other members in the
present life and more great of as much as the life where ye estate to come
excedeth in good or in ill that of this present life. The aid that the one
membre does unto the other may be known in considering the operacyon and
usage of every membre in regard of the other / as we see that the operacyon of
the mouth is the cause of ye life of all the other / so of the eyes / so of
the foot / and of every of the other members secret in asmoche that the
sykenes and dystruccyon of the one is the dystruccyon of the other / And so in
like wise may a man say of the dolor the which is in every membre of the
dampened / for it is suffycyent unto the death of all these other if death
corporal might be in hell recovered / and so this may be understand not
aloonly of the members of the body of nature. but with that of the members of
the body mystycall / that is to say that if ony^ were in hell with out having
other pain than that / that he sees and knows in his neighbors he should
suffer for to dye of as many dethes as there are of persons dampened in such
wise that as many of members Asserunt theologi (...) ^te (...) diciu^ ge (...)

as many of dethes. The second pain is for the touching of the place in the
which they ben the which fire enbraseth not aloonly by nature / but more over
by operacyon dyuyne for that / that he is the instrument to excersyce the
Justice of god. /: And for as much that these operacyons dyuynes / and
maryculousses ben much more excellentes than those the which ben done symply
after the course of nature the embrasynge and the tormente of the fire of hell
excedeth the hete of all metalles molten the which may be ymagyned more
excessyuely than heart may think. And therefore when such fire is in the
depnes of the heart / of bones / of synewes / and of veins / of blood and of
the flesh of the dampened and the which is more to esmeruayll in all ye
puyssaunces of ye soul. who may than think the anguysshe of them the which
ben in such torment without ever to have power A questyon.
to dye. But some may make such a questyon If it be so that these dampened
shall be bayned in a ponde of yse after* as holy scripture says / and lately
has been said before that as much is the great oppress of cold as that of
fire / as it may be to enjoin hete and cold in one self torment and in those
ye which may not be remeuyd from one place unto another. The answer unto that
/ the great The answer
Alberte that such alteracyon of cold and of hete in one self body makes /
is not made yt it is put from one place in to another. But in like wise as the*
sykenes of a fever gives first coldenes and afterward meruayllous hete /
even so the torments of hell ben varyed among these dampened with out mutacyon
of the place of their prison and hell perpetual. The third pain is for the
touching of other bodies dampened and embrased as a man sees sensybly that of
as much that there is much wode in a fire / of as much it brenneth ye more
stro^gely / and therefore the fire embrased in a town is Poe^s eos vt cliba nu^
ignis i^ tp^e vultus tui. ^s. x.
right peryllous for the multitude of the houses ye which ben togyders. Not
alonely to feel or for the damage that it does / but with that unto the
regard of him or of those y^ which nothing shall possede in the said cite /
for by the error and abhomynacyon of such embrasynge a man may lose the
wit and the understanding / Now think he that may what it may be of those
the which felen them and vnderstonden to be dampened in the fire of hell for

every of them shall make more greter fire than should that of ye most greatest

the deuylles make upon ye bodies and upon ye souls of those that been dampened
/ and for a brete epilogacyon of all the pains of the party of the body it is
to be noted that all the five wtyttes naturalles of the dampened shall be
replenys^hed with things Co^gregabo super eos mala. and p^. 1. sagittas meas

the which unto them shall give torments above all estymacyons / as the cite

mother / and ye mother the daughter / the systers and the brother kynnesfolke and
other friends. Also the husbonde the wife / and the wife her husbonde / and so
of an hundredth thousand other things / that every of the dampened sees and
knows and of every thing unto sorrow and disease pertyculerly / and so of
the herynge / in herynge ye cry / the lightening and the thondre of hete and
of cold the which contynually ben assembled the one as great as an other / of
the which assemble and press spryngeth a co^fusyon of sou^de as sometime we
may se when one puts an iron embrased in the water / or wha^ a cloud cold
assembleth with another cloud hot Than it causes ye lightening and the
thondre the which of times unto us is hateful for ye error of the great
sou^de and of the cries / if it than be so that the body of every of the
dampened be a corner of ye lightening and of the tormente of hell / what
confusyon of cry and of thonder there may he have think he that may. Also the
taste / the smell / and ye touching ben in semblables varyacyons and
inno^brables pains and torments. By the consyderacyon alonely of the pains
before said the which is a little thing in comparyson of them the which
folowen all understanding the which may unto such pains come or him keep
theder for to come should well in himself conceive on such ferechat / by that
he him enforce to do well / and all ill for to eschew and fle / the which
thing is the end unto the which we entende in all the process of this
present book.

Here folowen in one manner of the generalyte of the pains of the soul dampened.
AFter y^ forty pains corporalles nombred and reherced before it behooves some
what to reherce of the pains of the soul to the end yt those the which will
not or may not conceive fere by the consyderacyon of the said pains
corporalles that for the spyrytualles they may come unto the fere of the
creature the which has puyssaunce to dampne body and soul in hell / for the
pains spyrytualles ben more cruel and more to be doubted Eu^ timete ^ po^t
per de^e corpus and aiam i gehe^nam.
of as much that the soul is more greter thing tha^ ye body / ye which
co^paryson surmou^teth now the capacyte of understanding humayne in this
(matter / and by the consequent a man may not comprehend parfytly the pains of
the soul / for as it has been before said after saint Austen they be much
more greter than a man may speak or think. And that notwitstondynge some
thing shall be here reherced how be it that it be little / and first in
general and secondly more in pertyculer. As unto the first it is to
understand that unto god the fader is given puyssaunce infynyte / unto god the
sone semblable sapyence / and unto the god the holy ghost like bonte and
bukso^nes / and this blyssed trynyte one dyuynyte / one self essence / one
majesty by his puyssaunce / his sapyence and bonte to create soul reasonable
unto his semblau^ce / unto his image / in gyuynge her mind / understanding /
and will in so high degree of noblesse natural that he unto her has given
fre choice to do well or ill / so that it shall proceed of the free will / and
if she her will humble in yeldynge unto god the obedyence and ye service that
she knows by reason natural to be due unto the creature / she her vnyeth
with him by grace being partener unto the glory of his dyuynyte by so high
excellence of dyuynyte that he her calls the daughter of god / the espouse of
Jhesu / christ / and queen of paradyse. And she the which knows and may all
things in god / And by the contrary when so noble a creature her peruerteth
contraryous and rebelle again god her creature ye which in such wise her
has autorysed endoned and ennobled and yt she will of her propre will agay^
the commandment and ordenau^ce of her god creator and redemptour. The which
thing is agay^ all reason natural. Than she supposes unto god her creator /
makes of herself her god in presumynge and sechynge dysordenatly in all
things her propre honor / her glory / and her praise / and for that / that
such god is nothing folly and error / the poor soul miserable falls and
abides adversary and contraryous unto god the creatoure in whom is all
goodness and all puyssaunce infynytly / and he oonly unto whom is given all
honor. and therefore so as we see that derkenesses be^ contraryes unto light /
beauty and honest / unto foulnes and unto all fylth / pouerte / richesse /
health syknes / the death / unto the life and so of all other things
contraryous. In like wise it behooves to say of the soul the which is
contraryous and adversary unto god And for as much that in god as it is said /
is puyssaunce / sapyence / bonte / beauty / richesse / glory / honor /
pleasures. delytes / life / troth / Justyce / equytes / swetnes / and all
other perfeccyons infynytly and without nombre / it follows well that in the
soul the which by the abusyon of his propre will / is unto hy^ contraryous in
fermynge aduersarye and contraryous unto the will dyuyne is all froward and
the contrary of the things before said. That is to understand / debylyte and
miserable feebleness / folly and cursydnes / horrible defermyte of foulnes /
pouerte of all godenes so great yt the death / or to be adnychylate him should
seem to be for a great good / mysery / and dyshonoure of all parts
dyspleasau^ce / disease / pains / and do lours without nombre and without
mesure death eternal unto him is his partage and propre heritage falsete /
iniquyte / malice / and such crudelyte that he curses god and all creatures
in desiring that all the world were dampened as she notwithstondynge that she
knows well that better with her it shall nothing be but ever worse. And for
asmoche yt she has clear understanding of herself and that she knows and
sees her dysposycyon her da^pnacyon / and the ylles and the inco^uenye^tes
before said and the which follow without no^bre and without end in the which
is put and given by her propre will. also Co^me^ducauer^it liguas suaspre do
lore and blasyhemauersit deu^ celi p^ ^o loribus and vulneri bus suis. a^o. xvi.
she has knowledge of ye goods of the glory that she has lost by her
defaute / And the which may never be recovered / and sees that of all these
ylles she oonly is the culpe and defaute / she hates herself and curses
above all things. And in like wise as she is dysordynatly loved she her self
hates and of good right / and would she had never ben made but she may not
have ye thing that she desires / who knows the foulnesand dyrte that she
may not drive a way or wasshe her dishonor that she may not recover / her
iniquyte that she may not correct / her loss that she may not recover / for
the which things and for the great rage in the which she is holden she
byteth and eats her hands and her tongue has well to understand and she may
not helselfe bear ne endure / wherefore there is none understanding tongue ne
writing by ye which a man may declare the pain and grievous rage of the
dampened and this is as unto the generalyte of the pains of hell of the party
of the soul.

Here follows of the ten pains pryncypalles of the soul the which is
dampened / and every of the^ dyuysed in four.

THe first is of all glory defayllynge. THe second remors without end of
conscience The third Ire / rancure / and murmr. The fourth pride and
rebellyon hard. The fyfth of another man's wealth cursyd envy. The syxte is fere
that much men noyeth The.vii. pain is torment the which fails not.
The.viii. is of all Joye defaute. The.ix. desire of the death right hydeous.
The.x. is trybulacyon shamfull.
THe first pain is to be depryued from the glory of paradyse / and for to
understand some what the gretenes of this pain / it is well to be noted that
as much great ill is the loss of some Visio dei totamerces. gio. super illud
^ oste^ da^illi salutare meu^. Ego ei multo grauiores quam gehe^na esse dico
cruciatus remoueri and ab^ci ab illa gtia nec puto ita acerba esse gehe^ne i

Simali posset male^t deu^ videre i infer no and in penis quam extra pena ^ deu^
non videre.
good as is great the value of that good lost / as for example. If a man
demand how much the great ill of sykenes / a man may truly answer that it
is as much great ill as health is great good for as much as the sykenes is
contraryous unto health. also what ill is the death / it is as much great ill as
y^ life is great good. In like wise if a man demand what ill is dampnacyon
eternal / it is as much great ill as the glory of paradyse is great good.
and for as much that ye glory of paradyse is more great good than the
torments of pain sensytyue before said ben great ill / it follows that the
pain (of the damage that these dampened souls have that is to be depreuyd
from the beatytude eternal is more great ill than all the pains corporalles
before said. This pain of y^ do^mage causes four great and inco^preuables
ylles unto the dampened. The first is to be depryued to see the blyssed trynyte
the which is as much great ill / as god is great good after as it is declared
before / ymagen he that may and not I ye ill of such loss and dampnacyon. And
therefore says well saint Austen that there is no saint in paradyse but that
loves better to be in the fire and torments of pains and too see god than to
be in the glory of paradyse except to see good. The second ill is to de
depreuyd from the co^solacyon and glory that the saved have for the company
and present of blyssed angellys. The third ill is to be depryued from ye Joye
and gladness that all saints have for the presence the one of the other. The
fourth ill is to be depryued from the contree and from the royalme of paradyse
the which of good right is named the land of life / as this present world is
well named the land of death. Wherefore it is to be notyd that as to lose a
duche / or a royalme in this valee of mesery and of ye country of death and
right peryllous to enhabyte / it is a thing so much ferefull and so much
playnnynge yt for to keep him from such peril / a man does arms / bataylles
/ assaults / as *should every man in the right of himself to do for to
eschew the loss of such good as the royalme of paradyse. Whereof says saint
Gregorye that the least of the Propter caritate^ magna^ hereditas illa oibus e^
vna and singularis tota.
saved have entyerly and perfytly the possessyon of all paradyse / for charity
by the which a man loves his neighbor as himself makes all gods to be
common specially in the said royalme of paradyse.

THe second pain of the party of the soul vermis eorum ^o^ morietur. ysaie.
vl^.
is named the worm or the remors of conscience and a pain the which
proceeds of clear knowledge the which than is in the soul / by ye which she
knows she had been saved if she had wylled when she should have wylled to
do the works. Also she knows that in such loss there is no recover / and
this unto her is a dyspleaser incompreuable as we may see some what in this
world of them the which by their defaute or neclygence. lesen a great good
that they ben in remors and in dyspleaser again themself / and this pain is
augmented Quid pro fuit nobis superbia aut diuicia ru^ iacta^c ^ ^d no bis
contulit. ^ap^. v.
unto the dampened of four parts. The first is of the mind of all the sins
yt they ever did in their lives / have they be pardo^ned other times on this
behalue or not / for in as much that god them has pardo^ned many sins and
by many times / of asmoche have they be the more unkind to be returned and
finally to dwell in sins. and when they see the little pleaser / the
prouffyte and the hardenes yt they have had in sy^ne and they felen the pain
and known ye eternyte / think who so may ye rage in ye which they ben
without ceasynge. The second is of the mind that they have of ye good deeds
that he might have done in little time / as penance and to purchase merytes
and the royalme of paradyse and that all is paste without ever there to have
remedy. The third is of ye mind of ye goods / of the honors and of ye
rychesses yt god unto them has Horre^do and cito apparebit vobis qm^ iudiciu^
durissimu^i^ his ^ ^su^t fiet exig no e^^rcedit^ mi^a. Ite^ pote^tespote^t
^orme^ta pacie^tur sap^. vi. Ite^ ibidem fortioribus forcior instat cruciatus.
given in this world for to praise him and serve hy^ and they have been abused
in making war and dyshonoure unto ye creature and unto the saints of
paradyse. wherefore not aloonly the Justyce and majesty dyuyne them holden
offended / but with yt the creatures in asmoche as ye unkindness and the
offense is great / now is it ynough-clere by reason natural yt the offense
made again the puyssaunce / sapyence and bonte infynyte / his malice /
iniquyte / and folly infynyte / by the which it behooves ^ the Justyce dyuyne
punysshe justly / and by torments infynyte as afterward shall be showed /
and this knows and sees every dampened to be done by the Justyce infynyte.
The which they hate soueraynly and unto whom they may not resyste / in any
wise flee / or escape. The fourth of the mind of the goods of grace that they
have other times had / or yt they might have had / of the which they have
lost ye merit and retrybucyon the which was the vysyon of god and all the
royalme and beatytude of paradyse. Also they have clear knowledge of the
benefyce of the Incarnacyon of our lord and of his blyssed passion / the
which thing unto them is as much great pain / as the love and the benefyce
was great and incompreuable and upon this ymagen profoundly every creature
after the grace that the sweet Jhesus unto him shall give / for I am enough
certain that none understanding create ne may it comprehend all plain.

THe third pain of the soul is Ire / and rancure incompreuable again four
things specially. The first is again the puyssaunce of god unto the which
they may not resyste as yt is said / notwithstondynge that they it desyren
soueraynly and ben certain to have no power theder to come / by the which
they ben in Ire intolerable. /: The second is again their mysery and
dampnacyon in such wise yt every of them is in sorrow and in anguysshe of his
propre will and do^mage more or less after the color and the damage. and for
as much y^ the soul dampened has clear knowledge of all her ylles she is
enraged of an Ire without mesure. the third is again the deuylles by y^
temptacyon and suggestyon whereof they be comen unto such estate and also yt
these torments ben without remedy. The fourth is again ye persons ye which
other times have consented unto their sins / or the which have not done their
devour for to teache them / or correct and in regard of this ye subieccyon
again their prelates / ye children again y^ fader and mother / the harlotte
again the harlotte / ben in such a rage of Ire / that none may it think or
write.

THe fourth pain is pride enuenumyd and they may not it aue^ge and it
proceeds of. iiii parts. The first is as unto ye regard of y^ lordeshyp and
dominacyon infynyte / and general of y^ creature and for asmoche yt the soul
da^mpned it adversary and co^trarious unto god she has of asmoche great
dyspleaser of ye honor and domynacyo^ of ye creature as such honor is
excellent and great. The secon de is unto the regard of ye Justyce dyuyne /
after y^ which she her sees aiuged unto ye eternyte of excessyue pains yt
she feleth and endures / and for asmoche yt she has been unjust in usurping
glory / honor / and the vsau^ce of her propre will she is made and formed
co^traryous and adversary of y^ Justyce dyuyne / by the which she abides
Justely in ye obstynacyon of her pride / and by y^ consequent of her torment
without end. The.iii. is unto ye regard of their propre will of ye which they
have made their god / and for y^ / yt they have loved such god above all other
things. and they hy^ se again ye contrary / and tormented without mesure / and
as unto any manner of thing desired they may not come they ben in a se of
anguysshe torment. The.iiii. is unto ye regard of ye holiness of virtues and of
troth yt she has lost and to the^ is co^traryous / and always sees and
knows yt troth Justyce / and glory arysen and ben taken from their torment
and from their pain by the^ the which ben in paradyse / by the which she
enrageth of dolor.

THe fyfth pain of y^ soul is of cruel envy in regard of four things. The
first is of the bonte of god / for syns that she is contraryous unto god as it
is said / she has in her the contrary of the proprytes and excellences the
which ben in god. Now is it certain that in god is pity / swetenes / and
mercy infynytly / by the which it follows that in the soul dampened there is
envy / crudelyte and anguysshe of all the goodnesses the which come and
proceden unto creatures of the bonte. and mercy of god. And for as much that
such goods innumerables as well in nature a^gelyque as in nature humayne / as
well in heaven as in earth the torment of y^ envy of those dampened may not be
suffycyently ymagyned. This torment is showed somewhat of this present world in
the torment yt these enuyous people suffren in the prosperyte of their
neighbors. The second is unto the regard of ye noblesse and excellence ye
which is in nature angelyque. The third unto the regard of other blyssed men
and women / for as it is great and is showed the mercy and bonte infynyte unto
ye salvation of y^ multitude of the blyssed saints / of as much is it great /
and is multyplyed ye enrage of envy of those y^ ben dampened. The fourth is unto
ye regard of little children ye which ben deed in orygynall sin / The
which shall be in ye fire of hell without suffry^ge pain sensyble. In like wise
as says these doctors and of yt company the which shall be right great / the
dampened shall be affrayed for the crudelyte of their envy unto whom all wealth
shall be co^traryous as enough it has be showed before.

THe. vi. pain of ye soul is fere immuable in the which they were first
cast in to hell and co^dampned / for syns in hell there is no rede^pcyon it
behooves to say yt they shall abide in perpetuyte in ye degree of ye pain in ye
which they ben first co^dampned. this fere proceeds of four things. the
first is unto the regard of ye Juge yt they known to be puyssau^te and of
justice infynyte. Also they known yt their iniquyte is incompreuable and
dampnable and of such comparyson and knowledge proceeds fere seruyle
inestymable and without ever to cease. The second is unto the regard of ye
company of men and of women dampened / for it fauteth not to ymagen that they
ben less ferefull in hell that they were on this halue / but more in as much
that they may more suffer of fere than they have had on this halue. Now is it
so that if they had seen or met one dampened on this halue they had had fere
to have been mad / think than who that may unto what thing it may be in the
other world / where these dampened fyn^en an hundredth thousand myllyons The
third is unto y^ regard of deuylles / for in as much that they have not
feryd unto them to obey in this world / it is ye good Justyce of god that
they feren their presence / their lokes and their torments in hell eternally.
This fere over that / that it is natural it is grauyd after the Justyce dyuyne
in form and manner iudycyble The fourth is unto the regard of the great and
horrible pains of hell / as for an example. If a man show unto any in this
present life a water hot / or a metal molten and that a man him certefye that
he therein shall be put by Justyce / by the espace of a month or of a year / he
should have much great dread and great fere advise every creature after that
that he may ymagen the understanding of souls dampened the which be not in
nothing tarried / but more sooner above all nature aided and chosen to
understand clearly as well the pains corporalles as spyrytualles the which
unto them ben made ready unto / to that think he that may.

THe seventh pain of the soul dampened is certaynte yt never in such pain
there shall be end / term / respyte / or releasynge for four things / The
first is for the reason of him that she has offended by her sin that is god
the which is infynyte and eternal: The second is by reason of the nature of
sin fynall / That is to understand he the which at th^deth is found
without true repentance. The third is unto the regard of the Justyce dyuyne.
But for as much as of that eternyte of pains due unto every sin mortal
shall be a chapytr^in the end of this matter / it is not as now necessary
other wise to draw these four points or pain /.

THe eight pain of the soul dampened is defaute of all consolacyon the which
defaute unto them comes of four parts / The first is in the regard of the
dyuyne fountain of Joye and of consolacyon / from the which the cursyd
dampened ben put fer away and departed. By the which they ben fallen in to the
contrary party / That is to understand in to the sea and in to the
depenesses of heuynesses and of all desolacyon. /: The second is in regard of
nature angelyque the which after god is the synguler consolacyon of nature
humayne specially unto the speryte / and for as much that these dampened have
not obeyed unto ye good inspyracyons of their holy angels but more sooner to
ye suggestyo^s of their gostly enemy instead of the keeping and consolacyon
angelyque they have ye presence and the desolucyon inestymable of deuylles. The
third is in regard of ye holy company of those that been blyssed / as is Jhesu
christ the vyrgyn Mary / and all those other holy saints of paradyse the
which have not in any manner co^passyon of those that been dampened / but they
enyoye in the crudelyte and eternyte of their torments the which thing y^
dampened sees and knows By the which they ben inestymably tormented and
dyscomforted. The fourth is unto the regard of the company of the dampened /
for the one shall not have compassyon of the other. By the which they curse
each other / and so shall be depryued from all co^passyon / as well of those of
paradyse / as of them of hell. nor in them self they may not in any wise have
it / but they it hate and curse pryncypally / for they ben the cause
defayllynge of all / of all the torments unto the which the ben come.

THe.ix. pain of the soul dampened is desire to mow dye unto the which she
may never come. Of good right they may not find the death in the other world
the which have refused ye life on this behalue. By the which they desyren
four things / unto the which they may not come The first is that they would
they had not ben create. The second that they might be as nothy^ge. The
third that they had not ben redemyd / The fourth that they should not arise.
For in like wise as these four things ben great glory and gladness unto the
blyssed. In like wise it is anoysaunce and heaviness unto those acursyd more than
ever man may think.

THe tenth pain of the soul dampened is co^fusyble retrybuco^n for four
things. The first is for that / that the dampened ben certain yt god the
which is their adversary sees their confusyble dampna^yon / for in like wise
as to se god is eternal and perfyte retrybucyon unto the blyssed / In like
wise to be seen of god in eternal dampnacyon is inestymable confusyon in all
these dampened and some what appears the confusyon / of y^ torment in this
world / for a thief has shame to be seen and known in his theft of any man
notable. but soueraynly he should fere to be seen of him y^ which hy^ shall
Juge. The second is for as much yt the torments and the multitude and their
greuys ben in y^ clear vysyon and knowledge of god not aloonly / but with hy^ and
all the court celestyn / and in like wise as y^ glory of the blyssed is
gretely trurstyd by ye da^pnacyon of those acursyd. In like wise y^ da^pnacio^
of those reproved is a grauyte inestymable by cause of y^ knowledge of those y^
ben saved. of y^ manner of this sight no theologie^ ne ought to doubt for they
of paradyse see in god all ye things ye which ben to y^ augmentaco^n of their
glory / as be^ y^ torments of hell in like wise as it has been said before.
and shall be more plainly in y^ chapter of y^ eternyte of y^ pay^es
internalles. Also if any make marvel how it may be y^ a child sauyd shall
have as gre te Joye and as perfyte gladness of the dampnaco^n of his fader / and
of his mother / or of the one of the^ or the fader and the mother sauyd of the
dampnaco^n of their child and other friends. The will of the sauyd is in such
wise united with the will dyuyne that all yt / that god will / is the Joye and
the will right parfyte of all the sauyd for yt / that god would or should will
after the puyssaunce and Justyce unto that dampnacyon and for as much is it
the will and glory of all those yt ben chosen. The third is of the lokes of
one upon another / for every of them shall see the sin and the conscye^ce /
the one of the other / and for yt / that soul reasonable notwtstondynge that
she be dampened leseth not her propryte yt she had shame of her sy^ne and of her
confusyon she shall be in sovereign anger in herself and unto the sight of all
the world as well of the sauyd as of ye dampened. The fourth is for asmoche as
she sees clearly the multitude of her sins the grefe and the unkindness that
she has committed again ye creator / and so as the sauyd have in themself a
Joye and a gladness of the good dedys yt they have done in this world* In like
wise the dampened seeing all their sins shall have for every sin partyculer
shame and abhomynacyon and incompreuable co^fusyon. Now behold who y^ may what
it shall be of all togyders / by these things before said it appears that
there are.xl. pains partyculers of y^ party of the body and in like wise as
many of y^ soul And so there ben four score pains partyculers in every
dampened in body and in soul / for as it is said all the five wits of nature.
That is the sight / y^ herynge / the smelling / the taste / and the touching
Also the bones / the mary / the synewes / the veins the flesh / the blood /
the humors / and qualytes corporalles shall be replenysshed with sovereign and
in dycybles / dolours / and anguysshes. Also all y^ puyssaunces of the soul /
as the mind / y^ vnderstondy^ge / and the will / shall be in Ire / and in
rancure / in pyrde and in rebellyon / in obstynacyon / and in profoundyte of
sovereign / eternal desolacyon / and of confusyons and so inno^brables that if
all y^ see were in ke for to write / and the sky and all the four alementes
parchement drawn in length / and all y^ tongues of the blessed sesse not in an
hondreth years to name and to nombre the partyculer pains unto the which is
adiuged and condampned every dampened a man might not speak nor write in an
hundredth thousand year the pains of one dampened aloonly / for if for every
year that he shall be in hell he might weep one oonly tere / when he had so
much wept that it amounts all the sea / yet should it not be but a manner to
begin his torment and his weeping. Also if he were a stone a thousand times
more greater than all the earth and that there came a bird / and from an
hondreth thousand years unto an hondreth thousand years and none of tener and
for every vyage he takes and consumes of the said stone also great aloonly as
is the tenth part of a corn of whete. In such wise that in ten hondreth
thousand years he had not taken of y^ stone but ye mou^tenau^ce of a grain of
the said corn and that god had made promise to one dampened y^ when the said
stone should be all eten and no sooner he should have than y^ glory of
paradyse but in the releasynge of his pain / the said dampened should be now
lately dyschargyd of one of the horrible torments of hell yt is y^ he should
have hope of y^ time and of ye hour y^ the stone should be al eeten / and that
than he should have some releasynge But alas alas and a. C. thousa^de times
alas / and wha^ shall y^ be / And ever more all y^ dampened ben depryued and put
from such trust and from every other hope or remedy / and ben certain yt
for ever without end and eternally they shall be in pain and in the torment
that they feel and endure / and this pain is dyspayre / no creature it can
suffycyently think. O hertes pyteous think profou^dly where shall become your
aege and your times / think where is your love and your understanding /
think if ye be in the way of glory / or of torment and ymagen that there are
an hondreth myllyons in hell yt if they had y^ fourth part of the half hour
to do penance and to recover mercy in such wise that it to do ye have the
days the months and the years they should do dylygence and such penance the
which there they shall never find / y^ which thing they shall never
recover. Alas think who that may / the we pynges / the waylynges / the
lamentacyons / and ye complayntes that they make in sessybly in cursynge the
hour that they were ever begoten / that ever they were borne of their mother /
that ever they were nourysshed and given souke / they have contynually in the
mind and in the understanding ye great goods that they have lost. and the
great ylles in to ye which they ben come / by the which they may say. Alas
where is become ye time in y^ which we might have been sauyd full little while
have endured our laughynges our plays / / and our plesurs of y^ world. Alas
what have prouffyted us honors / rychesses / and delytes / great castelles /
houses / dygnytes / offices / all is paste more sooner than y^ wind and with
^s abides not but ye maledyccyon of god / mysery and torment / cursyd be ye
hour yt we had not ben famysshed and deed more sooner than Male dicetregisu^
and deo fuo. ysu. vii
borne / we have lost y^ merit of y^ passion / we have lost paradyse and
eternal benedyccyon / alas god wherefore haste thou us create / cursyd be the
creature of creatures / and the hour also of ye creacyon / well ben we acursyd
and co^fou^ded / we have fere to cry to curse / and blaspheme ye one may not
y^ other comfort but well away may each with other sorrow. O how much is this
horrible thing cruel and to redoubte as to offend god and his
commandments to trespass but to late it is him to advise and repent. such
remors and other without nombre ben in y^ song of y^ acursyd / of ye estate of
whom and of their pains none ne may speak nor write plainly / in co^paryson
of y^ / that they suffer / but yt notwithstondy^ge who y^ well takes head and
weyeth in his heart y^ the which is said and reherced in this treatise he
shall conceive fere if ever by mean of writing / or by other way erthely he
yt should conceive and unto that purpose is found by scripture that a yo geler
a man excessyuely worldely and of all vanyte plainly named Fulques one time
among other was laid in a fair bed soft and pleasau^te but he might not
sleep as he desired and him it ennoyed that the light of the day came not unto
him no sooner / not for to here mass / or else for to pray unto god / but
for to excercyse his folyes and his vanytes worldly. And he being in such
ennoysau^ce thought in himself profou^dly what ennoye and doloure he might
have if he were conda^pned him to hold and abide in the bed where he lay
till unto y^ espace of two or of three years without seeing other light / or
person / and conceived in himself yt for no so^me of gold / or of silver /
he would suffer to be comdampned unto such ennoye and such torment. And
afterward thought yet more profoundly what it might be of those the which
have not done suffycyently penance on this behalue / by the which they ben
Justely adiuged to be an hondreth years and some other more / and other less
in torments and in the sharp fire of purgatory / the which is so hard and
so anguysshous a thing to bear and endure / yt none ne may it think / and
much he meruaylled of the pain / and of y^ ennoye that they might have in
awaytynge the day of gladness that they should be crowned in the royalme of
paradyse and delivered from all the pains for ever without end. But so as god
would he thought more profoundly what it might be of those the which ben in
hell dampened in eternyte of torments who awayte not nor trust not for ever
to have socours ne lyghtynge in any space of days or of myllyons of years /
and by this consyderacyon and thy^ king he conceived such fere / and so great
admyracyon that for his folysshe and cursyd life he might not one time come
unto such confusyon where incontinent he dysposed hy^ to leave his life
worldely and right peryllous in co^syderynge y^ with great pain / and well
late thynken these worldly people of things y^ which unto them ben finally
for to come / and after in full few days left y^ world and entered in to y^
relegyon of cystoriencis in y^ which he prouffyted so gretely in thinking on
y^ pains of hell. the Joys of paradyse and other holy medytacyons / y^ for
his great holiness and medytacyon and perfecco^n of good life he was chosen
right holely bishop of toulouse / in y^ which office and dygnyte he ended
unto y^ glory of god his days. By this example appears clearly the great
prouffyte y^ which came of holy medytacyon and to think on the pains of
hell and unto the eternyte of their hardenes. And therefore to y^ end y^ those
y^ which will study in this present book having matter more habou^dantly
offere and to esmeruayll y^ eternyte of the said pains of hell. Here follows
a chapter in y^ which ben contained many causes and reasons shows wherefore
god punyssheth sin eternally. without ever there to have an end.

Here follows the chapter of y^ causes and reasons wherefore ye pains of
hell should be eternal.
NOtwithstondynge that some thing has been touched of the eternyte of pains
and torments of them reproved yet for the more greater admyracyon and also for
to mete with folysshe se^tences and oppynyons yt the devil sows among the
hertes of many worldly people blinded and dowed in their sins. Here folowen
many causes and reasons by the which it is euydently showed y^ the said pains
ought to be eternalles without ever there to have releasynge / and pryncypally
for three reasons generalles. The first is unto ye regard of y^ condycyon of
mortal sin. The second unto the regard of the creator the which is
glorious and eternal. The third is the consyderacyon of the universal world.

AS unto the first yt is of the consyderaco^n of sin it is to understand yt
for four reasons Justyce dyuyne requires y^ sin be punysshed in eternyte.
The first is for yt / that after all Jugement of reason / ye offense of sy^ne
ought to be w^yed and punysshed after the dygnyte / great / little or mean of
him the which is offended / for none ne may ymagen yt it were no great offense
to stryke unjustly a bishop tha^ a simple chapelayne / or y^ souerayn bishop
yt is y^ pope tha^ another man of the church in less dygnyte. Now is it so
that by every sin mortal god is offended soueraynly and as much grievously
as his majesty is dygne and infynyte. By the which it follows that Justyce
requires pain who answers / and by the consequent infynyte for every
mortal sin. The second reason is for as much that by mortal sin every
(creature is depryued from wealth eternal the which is god / and by such wise
he him submytteth unto his oposyte / y^ is damp nacyon eternal. The third
reason is for asmoche y^ mortal sin depryueth y^ creature from wealth paste /
present / and to come. The wealth paste yt is the passion of y^ blyssed Jhesu
christ without ye which it were impossible unto all ye world to mow euade
the bonds of y^ devil / and ever more by mortal sin a man him depryueth
from such benefyce. The good present yt is the merit of holy church from the
which the sinner being as a sinner is depryued and seueryd. The goods to
come yt ben the goods of glory y^ which by good Justyce should not be given
in any wise unto those the which ben enemies and adversaries unto the
creatoure as ben all those y^ which finally abyden in mortal sin. The
fourth reason is for asmoche that mortal sin of his propre condycyon
destroys all the good deeds of the creature y^ which he committed / for
every thing destroys his contrary in as much as is in him / as it appears
of fire and of water / of light and of derkenes / and so of other things
contraryes. Now is it enough certain yt there is nothing contraryous unto the
will dyuyne but oonly sin / and by the consequent sin destroys and
puts unto naught as much as is in him the will dyuyne and so puts all y^
blyssed Trynyte unto nothing and in such wise he destroys all the world /
as well the holy men and women of paradyse / as also all these other creatures
/ for it is Impossyble that creature may be to have enduryd but in that / that
god him holds and conserueth and if god be dystroyed by sy^ne the which
aloonly unto him is contrary / every creature is deed and destroyed in the death
of the In iterno au^t ^s ^fitebi^ tibi quas^ dicerz nullus. p^. vi. I te^ qr
no^ ifernus co^fitebit tibi neque morslaudabit ten^ expectabu^t ^ desce^ dut i^
lacu^verita^e^ tua^. vsa. xxx viii.
creator. But it is a thing impossyble ye god may not be / or to dye / by the
which it follows and behooves yt sin be punysshed after ye puyssau^ce /
sapyence and eternyte of his contrary yt is god / and if it were not done /
there should be defaute of Justyce. and if Justyce dyuyne and infynyte defayle
/ god should defayle / Also the sinner the which dies in mortal sin /
synneth in eternyte / for if he always had lived / always he had sinned.
And in as much as that he endures in sin / he ought to endure punycyon.
Also if the sy^ne the which ever endures were not for ever punysshed / the
Justyce penytyue should be to much unlawfully dyuynysshed and all troth
dyuyne defraudyd / ye anoyntyd the which ben things to much impossybles.
Also as much great is the transgressyon / as y^ great oblygacyon. Now is it
troth that every creature is bound to serve and honor his creator the
which thing he may not do the which is in dedely sin / but more sooner
does the contrary that is to know to blaspheme and to dyshonoure god. By the
which he is the transgressour of the law dyuyne and of nature the which ben
laws eternal les. By the which it follows that such transgressyon ought to
be punysshed eternally.

AS unto the second point the which is in the comparyson of the sin / and
of the creature again whom it is done / it is to understand that for four
reasons he ought to be punysshed eternally. The first is for the grace that
god has done unto the creature humayne / For of as much as the grace / or the
benefyce done unto any is great / of as much is greter the offense or the for
fayte of him the which is redeuable / or shall yield account before him whom
he ought to serve and honor / As for an example. The king gives a thousand
pound of rent unto one knight and unto another an hundredth thousands pound
both tweyne offend and commytte treason again the king. Than it shall be
Jugyd that the treason of him the which had an hundredth thousand pound is
more grievous thanne is that of him ye which had not but aloonly a thousand
pound / and therefore for as much that an hundredth thousand pound is more
greater thing then a thousand pound aloonly. And unto the purpose god unto
us has given the body and the soul the which ben also as the two knights /
unto the body he has given / sight / tastynge / smelling and herynge / and so
of other gifts corporalles but unto the soul he has given understanding
mind / and in creatynge her unto his image and unto his semblaunce in gyuynge
unto her him the which is the good and tresour infynyte / and not
(withstondynge that she it forfayteth and co^mytteth treason as many times and
as often as when she her consents unto dedely sin / for she withdraws ye
honor the obedyence / and the glory that she owes unto her creatoure by ye
which it behooves to say y^ as is much great the offense as was great the
benefyce / and for as much that he was infynyte / also is the transgressyon
and punycyon infynyte by so right Justyce that any creature needs to doubt.
The second reason is by cause of the injury done unto god in that / that the
soul her consents unto the gylte of mortal sin choseth and loves better
any good create than she does her creator. Now is it so y^ between the good
created what so ever that it be and the good increatyd ye which is god unto
ye dysta^ce infynyte and of as much yt the good that a man choseth more sooner
than a man does god is little the injury is y^ more great as unto the
consyderacy on / by the which it appears yt lecherous men and women the
which makes of they^ belly and of their pleasure of their sensualyte their
god / and the couetyse men and women of their gold and of their silver / and
proud men and women of wind of abusyon and of vain glory does horrible in
jury unto god and infynyte and may not abide unpunished after as it unto him
appertains that is to know infynytly / or else he should not be the god of
Justyce infynyte ye which is a thing Impossyble. The third reason is by
cause of the majesty dyuyne y^ which has be enough showed before That is to
understand of asmoche that he ye which is offended / is of more great
noblesse / dygnyte sapyence / Jurysdyccyon / and auctoryte / and of as much
that a man is more holden and bound / of as much is the offense again him y^
more great And for as much yt god is of majesty infynyte and yt the creature
unto him is bound infynytly That is to say asmoche as she has being /
substance and other goods / ben they of nature / of grace / or of fortune it
follows clearly yt the offense of mortal sin ought to be infynytly
punysshed. The fourth reason is by cause of the Justyce dyuyne the which
thing he may also show / if it appertain unto ye Justyce and mercy dyuyne to
reward the blessed in eternyte of glory / for ye obedience / honor and
reverence yt they have done unto their creator in this world by yt same self
Justyce it behooves yt he punysshe eternally ye inobedyence / y^ dishonor and
irreuerence yt these cursyd dampened have done to god their creator in this
present life.

AS unto y^ third point pryncypall and fynal the which is yt sy^ne ought to
be punysshed in eternyte after y^ comparyson y^ it has unto the universal
world / it is to understand ye every per sone of his propre nature and
condycyon desires to come unto wealth eternal. and therefore ye soul ye which
her consents unto mortal sin / choseth some good create / as ben honors /
in proud people rychesses in couetyse people / delytes pleasurs carnalles unto
lecherous people / he constytuteth his end / and blyssednes in ye thing yt he
desires soueraynly and all these things the which him may serve / be it god
/ the saints the angels or other thing for to come unto such end / he
them desires not but by the end and felycyte before said and of such people
is there without nombre yt would have in this world yt / that they desire and
never to see god or other blessydnes to have. And for as much yt in such love
and such desire they ben found at the hour of death / it is not again the
inclynacyon natural of the soul. That is to understand that she abides in
her eternyte under the punycyon of the deceuable beatytude yt she has chosen
above god and again god / and this is for the first reason of ye third point
ye which shows wherefore the puny cyon of the dampened ought to be eternal.
The second reason has been lately touched before / for y^ perfeccyon of the
world universal requires that he there has felycyte eternal / and this
here is ordened by Justyce unto them the which have resysted and foughten in
this present life again their sensualyte and propre will again the world and
In me^sura^ co^tra me^sura^ ca^ abiecta fuerit iudicabit dn^s. ysa. xxvii. c.
Ite^. xxviii. ca. Ponam in po^dcre iudiciu^ et iust^am in ^^^nsnra.
the devil and have perseueryd till unto the end. And by that same self
Justyce behooves it that punycyon eternal be prepayred and reseruyd unto them
the which have not wylled to fight / but have obeyed unto their adversaries /
and so when every creature shall have Just retrybucyon after his nierytes /
or demerytes / all the world shall be in her perfeccyon / In the which he
shall have no more / as to add / to mynysshe / or to varye / for it
appertains unto the puyssaunce / sapyence and Justyce dyuyne to conserve all
things in their fynalle perfeccyons. The third reason for the great vtyly te
the which comes of the eternyte and mysery of the dampened unto the perfeccyon
of the universal world / for first god is feryd soueraynly. Also his
commandments ben kept the more humbly and Deo ei^ militat oe^ quod obstat.
her ^lexa^der de halis.
the more dylygently / and in so doing a man purchases finally ferefylyale or
chyldly merit and salvation. And therefore to say that the pains of the
dampened ben and ought to be eternal / it is no pity / but sovereign iniquyte
and manyfeste subuercyon of the troth of god contained and showed in holy
scryptures and all the destruccyon of our holy faith catholyque. The fourth
reason of the eternyte of ye pains of the dampened yt is for ye glory of the
creator ye which is ye sovereign end wherefore Qui bona eger^^t ibu^t i vita^
eternal. ^ vero malo i ign^ etnu^. Hec e^ fides catholica etc. hec athana. i

all things ben create / made / formed / and ordained The which glory
shyneth and is showed unto all the world / great noble and infynyte / in as
much yt y^ multitude of ye dampened and their pains / dolours and torments
ben great innumerable and eternal. for in like wise as the mercy infynyte of
ye creator is showed / in ye great beatytude or blessydnes of paradyse / so is
manyfested ye Justyce by the eternyte of ye torments of y^ dampmed / and of
such manyfestacyon of mercy and of Justyce comes and accords a melodye of
glory whereof says holy scripture that a man ought to sing before god the
versycle / or the song of mercy and of Justyce. by the which we may
understand and also it see in practyse yt melodye of musyque may not be
perfyte if there Misericordia^ and in diciuiu ca^rabo ^ivi domine. p^s.
be not parfeccyon of tenoure / and if the tenoure were not eternal the
melodye should not be eternal (In like wise the melodye of the glory of the
blessed shall not have tenor if the pains of the dampened were not eternalle /
I understand by the tenor of the glorious melodye of paradyse the cry and
the braye and horrible thondre of hell. By ye counter tenoure ye joy and the
gladness of the blessed men and women of paradyse. By the florysshynge of that
melodyous musyque I understand the Joye and exaltacyon and the gladness
angelyque the which incompreuable and inenarrable / for she is not aloonly in
joy corporal but with that in the e^es of the soul. In like wise as it shall
be drawn in the treatise of the Joys of paradyse / unto the which us will
bring and led the sweet Jesus unto whom be al honor and glory with the
fader and the holy ghost.

AMEN
Here after follows the treatise of the Joys of paradyse and first the
prologue for the fyfth chapter.


AFter the treatise of the pains of hell here follows of the Joys of
paradyse by the consyderacyon of whom and mouynge the light of the holy faith
catholyque / the will / the desire and the love of heart humayne is draw
upward / for in like wise as by the consyderacyon of ye horrible pains before
written a man comes unto fere / great little / or mean / after as y^
understanding and co^syderacyon of those pains / is great or little. even so
in like wise comes a man for to love and to desire the Joys of paradyse after
that they ben considered much or little of heart humayne whereof for to
excercyse the love and the desire of heart hu^ main for to purchase the glory
of paradyse some thing I put that it be little is here after written first in
general and secondly more in especyall. As unto the first it is to
understand that after as saint Austen says / a mortal man may not speak or
ymagen the multitude the gretenes / and ye nobles of the Joys of paradyse /
for they ben much greater than tongue ne can tell / or heart ne may think
There is found sovereign pease without war rest without labor / Joy
without sorrow / infynyte rychesses / faythfulnes / yongth / and gladness
fountain of all goods that understanding may think / or that heart may
desire / for the blessed see god face to face / and all other things in god
and god in them self. Also they see the humanyte of Ihesu christ / they see
the vyrgyn Mary / and all her holy company of the blessed vyrgyns / of the
which vysyon says saint Austen and also saint Gregorye that who so it should
not have but by the espace of one Journey aloonly a man should for to purchase
such good desprayse all ye rychesses / and honors pleasurs / and delytes that
a man might have in an hondreth myllyons of years in this present world and
with that to suffer all the martyrdomes / anguysses and-orowes the which may
be spoken or thought. That is to know for to come unto good for to mow see in
so little espace of time the blessydnes the which is promised unto all the
friends of god to possede eternally. O blessed very god eternal / that these
poor blind worldly people may not such meruaylles / here / read / or
understand some what / for than may they co^prehende certainly that all wealth
erthely and worldly is not* but pure Si co^sideramus ^ and qua^ta su^t q^nobis^

and lettynge / pouerte / health / is but syknes / wisdom but folly / gladness
ennoye and heaviness / youth decrepyte and aege / life temporal a languor
mortal and so of other things blind and transytoryes in co^paryson of the
goods of eternal glory / As unto the second point all shall be recyted ten
pryncypall Joys of the parties of ye soul. And in like wise ten of the body
contraryes and opposytes unto the pains and torments of the dampened. / And
every of them shall be dyuysed in four by the consyderacyon of the which
Joys the espyryte humayne shall not be aloonly a sleep / but ryally deed and
insensyble the which him shall not move by a fervent desire for to come unto
wealth incomparable. The which thing is the pryncypall end and intencyon of
all the process of this present book.

Here follows the ten pryncypall Joys of the party of the soul.
The first of god right clear knowledge. The second the love of all his
puyssaunce. The third with him without end to abide. The fourth Joy the which
ever shall endure. The.v. of all wealth right large habou^dance. The syxte great
honor and great reverence. The.vii. beauty of y^ soul meruaylous. The.viii.
parfyte pease and gracyous. The.ix. refeccyon desyderable. The tenth felycyte
muaryable.
THe first Joy of paradyse of the party of Caplm.vi.
the soul is the clear vysyon of god and of all other things the which
appertain unto the glory of ye sauyd. Wherefore it is to be noted that ye
blessed shall have three manner of knowleges. The first is named the knowledge in
the clerenes of the myddaye the which is none other thing to understand but
to see right parfytly the essence dyuyne. The second is named the knowledge in
the clerenes of the morning / that isto know all the creatures spyrytualles
or corporalles in ye myrrour of the blessed trynyte that is to understand in
the blessed sone of god unto whom is granted / sapyence eternal. The third
is named the knowledge in the clerenes of the euentyde that is to know the
creatures in their propre essences and natures. By the which appears that
this Joy of the clear vysyon shall proceed of four parts. The first shall be
to se the dyuynyte the which never creature sees in this mortal life but in
the light of the faith than he him shall show right clearly / and after as
witnesses holy scripture the soul shall be in such wise transumed in god
that in her the which is unto the image of the blessed trynyte shall appear
unto all the world the sovereign puyssaunce sapyence / and bou^te the which
ben in god and shall be than semblau^te unto god by grace dyuyne. who shall be
more shynynge than is the son for her clerenes: Of this vysyon or knowledge
the which is in compreuable as for this present life comes and proceeds a
love the which is as much great as is that knowledge and of the love and
knowledge comes and proceeds Joy as much great as ben knowledge and love /
and they ben inestymables. Also is the joy which of it proceeds / and than
when the soul her shall see the daughter and the espouse of the king eternal
enherytour and in ye ryall possessyon of the royalme of paradyse for ever
eternally. Who may it think what Joy she may have / for in such
co^templacyon ye derkenes of my little understanding defauteth. The second
shall be unto the blessed company of paradyse as well angelyque as humayn and
of the gretenes and multitude of merytes of all the saints / the which thing
may be some what under stand if a man understand the perfeccyon of the charity
y^ which is in paradyse. That is to understand y^ every of them loves his
neighbor as himself / to love some thing proprely / that is to will him
good / and hy^ to rejoice of his honor of his Joy / of his blessydnes / of
his richesse / and of his wisdom / of his promise and so of other gifts and
perfeccyons as well of the party of the body as of the party of the soul.
Wherefore it behooves to conclude yt every of them that been blessed has
partyculer Joy of all the sauyd / of whom some may not be more blessed /
other less / and other egally. and for to have matter of meruaylous
contemplacyon and ymagynacyon / and in like wise is it royally where that one
sauyd sees and knows an hundredth thousand the which ben egall unto him in
glory it behooves to say if he love their wealth as his own that he has an
hundredth thousand times more great Joye of their glory than he has of his
own propre and synguler / ymagen we secondly that he sees and knows
hondreth myllyons of whom every of them has more of glory by the half than
he has / it behooves to say ye an hondreth myllyons of times in double / he
has more great Joye of such multitude of the sauyd than he has of his
synguler Joye. and if mortal man were never on this halue suffycyent for to
no^bre or for to write ye glory partyculer of ye lest sauyd / what may it be
/ what may a man say of this present co^paryson unto such multitude of the
sauyd. Also says and practyseth saint Barnardyn yt every of ye saints of
paradyse has more great joy of y^ glory y^ which is in ye blessed vyrgyn
M^ry than of his own propre / and of yt that he may have of all the court
celestyall above of her of asmoche as her me rytes and her graces exceden y^
gifts and the graces of all those y^ ben chosen / In y^ which dyfferrence of
merit a man may ryally ymagen as much great excess as he may have in y^
circo^fere^ce of ye sky in comparyson of ^ center of the earth / for she is the
natural mother of god ye which pryuylege excedeth all the excellences y^ a man
may speak or think. also the wye that every of ye sauyd the right holy
humanyte of Jhesu christ is of asmoche the more great as yt / that he has of
himself of ye vyrgyn Mary and all the company of paradyse as ye gifts and
graces of Jhesu christ exceden y^ gifts and merytes of all ye sauyd / the
which excess is infynyte for as much yt such a man that is to know Jhesu
christ is god egall unto the fader and unto the blessed holy ghost in all
majesty dyuyne and all these comparysons before said of ye multyplycacyon of
every of the sauyd they ought to be understand as unto the nombre and
multitude of ye glory and not asmoche or more parfytly to love. That is to
say yt every sauyd loves more parfytly his propre and partyculer glory than
he ne does yt of all the sauyd / and so he it ought to do by good charity ye
which begy^neth unto himself but for asmoche yt charity makes all things to
be common be it good / or ill / every of the sauy^ has accydentall Joye as well
of ye multitude of the sauyd as of their merytes and of every of them
inpartyculer more or less after ye degrees of the glory yt he sees and
knows and louech in euer^ of his neighbors. Who may think and nombre this
glory or it feign to comprayse and to esmeruayll. The third manner of knowledge
is that they shall see and know clearly all the sins great and horrible
that they have committed. And also they shall see the cautelles the subtylytees
Cuiminus dimittitur minus diligit. luce. vii. cap^.
and temptacyons deceuables that they have escaped / were they of the world /
or their propre sensualyte / or of the devil / and of as much that they ben
escaped / the more vyctoryously and from the more stronger bataylle and from
more greater perils / of as much known they the more aid and the mercy of
god with out the which they had had full little power for to resyste or
them to releue after the byenge of the death for the gylte culpe of sin and as
much as they know to have had the more great grace and aid of god Scimus
qm^ dilige^tibus deu^ oia coope ra^tur i bonu^ rom^.
of as much love they him the more and of as much that they love hy^ the more
/ of as much have they viii. wi glo. iterlinearisoia sieve prosperasiue

the more great Joye / for as it has be said before / after the love great or
little is mesured the Joye ye which in it proceeds and so it appertains not
aloonly the merytes of the saved ben unto ye augmentacyon of glory / but with
that ye sins that they other times committed / of whom they have glory not
to have done them / or of the condycyon of sin / but accydently for as much
as they have done penance / and that they ben releuyd. The.iiii. manner of
knowledge shall be yt they shall se and know the dampened the error and the
multitude of their Letabitur iustus cu^viderit vidicta^manus suas lauabit i
sanguine pcto^rie. pros. lvii. Stultorum ifinitus e^numerus. proverb.
pains and torments wherefore unto them shall be declared and manyfested y^
Justyce of y^ sapyence dyuyne / and of asmoche yt they know y^ m^^e great and
infynyte Justyce of as much they him approve and him love / and of asmoche
they love him the more / and of asmoche they the^ enjoy / and for as much
that y^ dampened and the multitude and gretenes of their sins ben innumerable
of asmoche have they y^ more great Joye. In ye which appears yt never ye
dampened ne committee sin whereof he ne receives augmentacyon of the glory of
every of the sauyd. Also it appears that in like wyle as the augmentacion of
the glory that they seen in y^ sauyd / and that they receyuen the one of the
other is incompreuable as it is said before. In like wise is incompreuable the
augmentacyon of the glory the which comes in the sauyd by the occasyon of
the dampened and them seluen for as much that there aren mo of ye dampened than
of the sauyd. Also many the which have been other times great sinners / as
saint poul saint Mathewe / and mary Mawdelayn / shall see the great and
horrible torments yt they have Justly deseruyd. The which they have escaped
by ye bonte and mercy of god / wherefore they ben the more embrased and sharp
in the love of god / and by the consequent it follows yt they have the more
great delectacyon and Joye of asmoche as the love is ye more great in like wise
as it is said. By these things before said well notyd appears clearly that
all things ben reduced finally unto the glory of god / for who so refuses or
him yeldeth indygne of the grace and mercy of god / falls and is reducyd
under the Justyce / and of asmoche is the thing dygne for to meruayll and for
to praise god in his Justyce infynyte as in his mercy / who may it think such
infynyte and such depnes of glory.

THe second Joye of the party of the soul / is parfyte to love ye which
proceeds of. iiii things. The first is god wherefore it is to be notyd that
reason and experyens unto us shown that of as much that some thing is of
more great valor / of as much is it worthy to be the better beloved / and of
as much that it is the better beloved and desired it is the more great Joye
for to have the possessyon and the fruycyon. Now is it so that in god is all
bonte / sapyence / honor / and noblesse / swetnes Joye and gladness / and so
of other perfeccyons infynytes the which may be desired and loved. By the
which it behooves to say that all those y^ which of such and so great
goods have sure possessyon eternal they have much more greater Joye of him /
than of any other thing / of as much that god is more great good than is all
other good create. And syns he is all good and wealth in fynyte it appears
clearly that he ought to be by loved infynytly above all other goods the
which may be spoken or thought. Now is it showed that of love comes Joye and
gladness as great as the love may be. By the which it follows that the Joye
that these blessed have / for the love that they have unto god / in god / and
of god is infynytly in infynyte above all other Joys that they may have. / of
any other good create by such manner that such Joyous pleasurs and gladnesses
that ever weren in person or creature / or myghtebe / ben less thing unto
the regard of them the which proceden of the lively fountain of the blessed
Trynyte theme is a drope of water unto the regard of all the sees. The second
thing the which we should love after god / that is our seluen after the
ordenaunce of god and also of nature and of true charity. And therefore for as
much that the sauyd seen that they have purchased wealth infynytly and
everlasting withoutende / and that they have done the thing by the which
they ben comen unto the grace of god / and unto the glory of paradyse they him
louen / and the goods that they have purchased as much as they ben / and that
they have purchased great wealth. For as much as they have purchased wealth
infynyte and everlasting / as much is great their love in them seluen and of
them seluen. And by the consequent as much is great their Joye and nombre /
think it who that may. The third thing the which we should love / that is
that we should love our neighbors and the manner of the love after god and holy
scripture is as our leluen and of this Joye it has bentouched here before in
the second article of the first Joye. I put that it is another chynge to se
and to understand the wealth of his neighbor / and another thing him to love
/ for the one proceeds of the understanding / and the other of the will / but
for the common rule it suffyseth as now that every sauyd enjoys him of the
wealth and merytes of his neighbors of as much the more that they ben in the
more great no^bre and in the more high degree of merytes. By ye which it
b^houeth for to say that in like wise as the understanding is full of the
knowledge of the great felycyte and also the beatytude of his neighbors. And in
like wise is the will full of love / of the which proceeds a Joye and a
gladness as much great as may be the knowledge and the love. And for as much
that of god aloonly is known the nombre of the chosen and the degree of all
their Joys and merytes. And also is y^ glory of cuery of them yt he has unto
the regard of ye love of his neighbor. The fourth thing that we should love
our own bodies / the which shall be than clear and shynynge more than the
son of some much of other little after their degree of ye glory and of the
merytes of the soul as it shall be said here after and syns it is so y^ these
worldly people have pleasur and gladness to see them clothed and enornyd with
precious clothes as gold and sylke / and of diverse and of many furs of wild
bestes the which abyllymentes may not long endure with out gadrynge of worms
and that they ne change color / what may be the Joye of the blessed and the
shynynge of the rube of inmortalyte y^ which unto them shall be given and
presentyd by the blessed The su christ the king of glory for lyueray. The
which they have deseruyd in this present world / for that / yt they have
subduyd their sensualyte for to do penance who so may it compass.

THe third Joye of the party of the soul / is to be sure and certain that
the glory and the blessydnes in the which a man him sees and Spe^s est certa
erpectacio future be atitudiser dei gr^aet bonis meritis ^redentibus pueniens

knows shall never defayle / and in like wise as the first Joye precedent
succedeth unto the merit of the faith that a man has holden and kept and the
second unto the merit of charity / sembla bly this third Joye of certaynte
is unto the regard of the virtue of the true hope that a man has had in the
bonte of god to mow come unto such glory. By the which a man him dysposeth
(by holy works. This Joye of certaynte is the cause of four parts. The
first is for ye promise Out (...)te^ p(...) e^ itra^^^ i^^^^nu^ (...) lorum.
mat. vii. Ite^ mat. xxv. Iusti in trabu^ti vita^ eternal. Ite^ de hoc e^
articulusfidei. Uita^ eternal Ite^ ^ bona ege^t ibu^tivita^ e^ na^. In symbo.
that god has made unto the blessed to have and possede eternally the Joys
and the royalme of paradyse. The which promise is written in many places of
the holy scripture the which may never lie / and by the which we may know
some what the great and mestymable dyfferrence of the poor and deceuable
glory worldly and of that the which is the very glory eternal. For first
the glory the which is worldly is in things outward and not always in the
soul / for many the which have and po^ede the royalmes of the earth suffren
much of ylles and of thought and of anguysshes in their conscyences and
oftentimes they ben much myserables and in prison and bonds of y^ enemy of
hell by the great and horrible mortal sins / but those the which have the
glory of paradyse ben and shall be in all ever glorious in body and in soul.
Also the glory of the world is inperfyte / for he that most has the more he
defauteth / but that of paradyse is right parfyte without any indygence. Also
that of the world endures not long. Where is now the great and noble king*
Dauyd. Salam^n. Arphazat. Ptholomee Naby godono^er. A(...)der and Charlemayne /
and those other great l(...)nd kings erthely y^ which have been(...)lde /
great / glorious / and puyssaunte(...)es and in rychesses / their glory
(...)h anon be passed. But so is it not of the glo(...)f the blessed / for
there is not so little a saint in paradyse but that he has more honor of
praise / of glory / / and of rychesses than there shall mou^te in one man
oonly all the glory that Beatitudo e^ status o^m bonorum aggregaco^e ^fectus.
hoecius.
ever was and shall be till unto the end of the world in all y^ lyuers upon
earth. O how much ought he to have great desire / and great hope the which
infynytly is certain for to come unto so great good. The second cause of this
certaynte / is for as much as god and nature have ordained that every thing
the which is comen unto his end cesse his mouynge in receyuynge the
perfeccyon the which appertains unto the degree of his nature and of his
condycyon. Now is it so that the esperyte humayne create so nobly by
puyssaunce dyuyne than is in the end and consu^macyon when it is united with
god as well by grace as by glory / for in that he has the accomplysshment of
all his desires and possessyon of goods infynyte. By the which he may never
other thing appetyte / but abide always in such stedfastnes of the beatytude
everlasting. The third cause of certaynte is for by cause of the estate of
inmortalyte / For syns that spyryte create has taken his body / unto the
which he has natural inclynacyon / and that he has deseruyd in this brefe
and mortal life for to come unto the beginning of every creature the which
is god / it is Impossyble after the laws / that have been instytute by the
sapyence dyuyne unto his creatures but that he abide in the stedfastnes of the
eternal vysyon of the blessed trynyte. The fourth cause of this sure sted
fastnes if for the valu of the good / unto the which these blessed ben come /
that is god the which is the good infynyte. / And more over the which is not
Impossyble that a man may other thing love / but in him and for him. By the
which as well the mind as the understanding and will ben parfytly deyfyed
and so there is parfyte certaynte of the beatytude eternal without any
admyxicyon to put in of varyablyte / wherefore every creature should take pain
for to come unto such blessydnes eternal.

THe fou^th Joy of the party of the soul / Inebriabu^tur ab vbertatedom^ tue
and torre^te voluptat^ tue potabis eos. p^s. xxxv. O^^sei hoies scire
desidera^t. proverb. xxii. ca. Ead sente^cia he^tur. i. math. Extrema gaudit
luctus occupat. qui additscie^cia^ addit et dolorem.
is a meruaylous and a great exaltacyon and gladness inuenerable the which
causes four things in the soul yblessyd. The first is that by such Joy
all things unto him ben put in Joy. /: The second is that she fulfylleth and
makes drunk the will / for it is a thing Impossyble but that the will of the
blessed be not all holly replenysshed with gladness. The third is that
notwithstondynge her excess and abondaunce she shall not be in ennoye ne in
anguysshe / but ever more soft / sweet and pleasant. The fourth is that she
parfyteth all the desire as well of the understanding as of the will the
which naturally desyren gladness and coming. The which things may not be
parfytly found in this present world transytorye in like wise as it appears
enough by experyence / for all the gladness worldly ends and takes his term
in anguysshe and in sorrow and a like thing is it of coming worldly and
erthly the which better ought to be called folly than coming.

THe fyfth Joy of the party of the soul / is abondaunce of all goods the
which ben yelden them in the soul in four parts. The first is of god the
which is fountain and depnesse of all goods the which may never be spoken
nor written / nor heart humayne ne may it think / and therefore he the which
has such perfeccyon of goods he has all without that / that it unto him may
any thing defayle / And he that had an hondreth thousand worlds and ^holde
be pryue of this In the which is such parfeccyon of gods he might well say
that he had nothing. The second is of himself / for the soul yblessyd her
possedeth in god in her sovereign perfeccyon of all his puyssaunces / and of
his virtues / and merytes. And therefore it is well said that who so puts his
heart above all in god he has his heart / and so has god / and he that it
puts in another place he leseth his heart / and so leseth god. The third is
for the presence of the company as well of y^.ix. ordres of aungelles / as of
the patryarches / appostles / martyrs / confessors / and vyrgynes / and for
the consummacyon of the charity the which is in paradyse the wealth of the one
is the wealth of the other in like wise as it has been before said and declared.
The fourth is for that that the gods before said ben all togyders not the one
after the other / or the one without the other / and the soul chosen in him
and by him the which is al / mighty / is so vygoryous in all his puyssaunces
that she may have knowledge / love and also great gladness / as well of god / as
of all the creatures / as well in every of them in partyculer as of all
togyders for every momemt / and for ever without end By this it appears that
every true christian man hy^ should enforce to mow come unto such goods to
suffer an hundredth thousand times y^ death right Ioyously if it were possible
and god it should require / but by his mercy he does it an hondreth. M times
better chepe unto the which the poor worldely people have right little
regard.

THe syxte Joy of the party of the soul is honor incomparable for four
things. The first is for his devotion / devotion is asmoche to say as
dedycacyon / or to be ordained to serve god and him praise. And for as much
that ye soul yblessyd is right parfytly the temple of the blessed trynyte /
she is bayned in the light of the love infynyte / and embrased with sovereign
and right parfyte devotion. The second is for as much y^ she her sees the
daughter of god by true adopcyon and if lordshyppes erthely and worldly is
reputed thing high dygne and honorable / as it should be to be the sone of an
Earl / of a duke / or of a king / what may a man think of that spyrytuall and
dyuyne lygnage / who may it think. The third follows by the second / that
is that by such adopcyon she her sees and knows the queen of paradyse / who
may in such honor compass and thy^ke / he has matter enough for to delay.
The fourth / that is that not aloonly such is the daughter Ego dixi dii estis^
filu excelsi omnes. ^s. lxxxi.
and queen of paradyse / but with that she is aduowed and reknowleged goddess
by partycypacyon. By the which all the court celestyall unto her bears
reverence with gretae honor and of good right syns that god her solmoche
honors and right excellently deyfyeth.

THe seventh Joye of the party of the soul is beautefull of admyracyon in
four manners. The first is in beauty of understanding / the which is the
clear knowledge of god and also of his creatures / As it has been touched here
before. The second knowledge is the beauty dyuyne the which illumyneth and
makes the soul glorious for to shine an hondreth thousand times more than ye
son The third is y^ beauty of noble virtues with the which the soul is
innornyd / as should be a right rich vestyment with great multitude of gold
and of precious stones the which has been set by a werkeman sovereign in
shynynge varyacyon of diverse colors / for he the which has innornyd the
heaven with diverse bodies shynynge and the earth with the erbes and the trees
being grene / and the sea and the air with fysshes and fowls fleing /
flowers and feders so dyuersely painted and fygured that sovereign work man
has inestymable painted / and ennornyd his daughter / his love / and his
espouse / his trone and his reclynatorye. That is to understand the soul
glorious and blessed. The fourth is the comparyson of ye four virtues
cardynales ye which than shall be in their sovereign operacyon. That is to
understand / Justyce / force / prudence / and attemperaunce / shall hold the
soul without any resystence in her operacyons again god / and again every
creature / for by the virtue of force the soul is united with god / by Justyce
she is subject unto god / by prudence she cheseth to see god above all things
/ by attemperaunce she is not subject nor let by any mouynge of passion the
contrary / yt is beauty and ordenaunce spyrytuall ne may not be showed unto
understanding humayne for this presentlyfe but right little in comparyson of
the troth.

THe eight Joye of the party of the soul is for the eternyte of her glory
the which is great and incompreuable for four things. The first is for the
presence and conformyte that she has with god. The second for the company and
amyable charity that she has with the aungelles and the aungelles with her.
The third for the union and Joyous consyderacyon of her will with the saints of
paradyse / and all the saints with her. The fourth for the tranquylyte that
she has in herself by that / that she shall be sure and confermed in the
eternyte of her glory and blessydnes and for as much that all these things
the which have been touched here before / it is not necessary to prolonge this
article.

THe nynth Joye of the party of the soul is Crede^tes aute^ ex u^^avi^
leticia in^ narrabili and glorifi catareportates fi^e^ fideive^^ salute^
aiarum. v^. irum. i. pe. i. c Aug. xxii. de ci. dei
refeccyon right delectable for four things. The first is for as much that
than the spyryte humayne is the sovereign consu^macyon of al perfeccyon of all
delectacyon / and of all his desires / and so is come unto that / that he had
before byleued and hoped / and unto that unto the which she never rechyd nor
over come. The second for as much that all pain / all labor / all thought /
fynysshed De^ e^ ^ims desiderinrum ^t^orum ^ sine fine videbt^. sie fasti dio
amavit^ sine fa tigacio^e laudabt^.
in this world has no t^ryenge or rest but in glory there is no thought /
labor / nor dysmaye / but all to the contrary. That is to understand / peace
/ Joye / and consolacyon. The third for that that the company is right
delectable / As some what it appears in person of great honor fre and
lyberall unto whom it suffyseth not to have in his house abou^dantes and
delycyous meets O israel quam magna e^ domus dei and inge^s locus possessiois
eius ^aruth. tercio. cap^
if he have not company like. In like wise is it of the soul yblessyd the
which has the king Jhesus / and the queen the mother of god and the musyque
and melodye angelyque and all the princes dukes / Countes / and barons /
esquyres / ladies / ge^tylwomen without nombre the which all them delyten
right Joyously in the beauty and in the noble virtues and merytes of the soul
yblessyd. /: The fourth for that that the palace where such feste is songen
and such dinner is inestymable great / pleasant / and ennornyd the which is
the propre heritage of the soul gloryfyed after as holy / scripture says. And
if it be so that in this life mortal a man has Joye / lotes and pryse for the
(proprete or possyon of a royalme or of a duchye what may heart humayne ymagen
of the glory the which apperteyneth unto the soul to have the conquest of
such heritage.

THe. x. Joye of the party of the soul is blessydnes without any varyacyon or
diminucyon or imperfeccyon the which ben found in worldely glory. The first
admixcion of some thought for there was never so glorious a man erthely and
worldely but that has some defaute. Many be rich the which have no health /
these other rich and in health the which have not beauty or they be not of all
folk byloued / these other rich hole and fair but they have not all that yt
their heart desires / but in the glory of paradyse there ne is defaute
diminucyon of beauty / of richesse / of pleasure / of charity / The second
imperfeccyon of glory worldely is a Ho^ natus de muliere breu^ viue^s the
repiet^ multis meseriis. Job. xiii.
manner of anoysaunce / for in wine or in meet / in carnal delight / in
dysporte / in rychesses / or in what some ever other thing that he may desire
comen finally to anoysau^ce and has been the less praised / but in the delytes
of paradyse is never found any varyacyon / always in love without tidings /
always begins ever more beloved / ever more delectables Breues dies hois
sunt. Job. xiii.
and pleasau^tes. The third inperfeccyon of glory worldely is that it may not
endure / for life humayne and temporal is compared unto a wind / unto the
smoke / or the arowe the which is departed and shote with the bow the which
has no taryenge till unto that yt she is in the mark aduysed and determined
of him the which it shoteth / but sensualyte / for that that it is submytte
unto the spirit after the order of reason. And therefore all the glory of the
body comes of god by the mean of the soul. In like wise as dampnacyon comes
un to the soul by the mean of the body / and in such wise appyred the order
of this treatise and the answer unto the questyon. And therefore of the glory
of the body and of his douers is now to treat first in general and
afterward more in especyall. As unto the first it is to understand that the
body glorious has four pryncypales excellences that these theologyens callen
the douers of the body / that is to know clerenes right delectable /
impassybylyte in enarrable / subtylyte inestymable / and agylyte incomparable.
Also after saint Ancelme / beauty / force / lyberte / health / all other delytes
and pleasures that may be spoken and ymagyned in regard of the operacyon of
the five wits of nature and of the place and of all other circonstau^ces in
like wise as it appyred here after shall be in all the bodies of the saved and
in so right great and inestymable excellence that any tongue mortal is not
suffycyent for to speak it / but for as much as god excused the fragylyte
humayne the which does that that in him is / here follows in partyculer
the.x. pryncypall Joys the which ben in every body united with the soul
glorious.

Here folowen the.x. Joys of ye party of ye body.
The first of the body excellent clerenes. The second perfect inpassybylyte.
The third subtylyte meruayllous. The fourth agylyte incompreuable. The fyfth
celestyall habytacyon. The sixte much delectable vysyon. The seventh melodye
right agreeable. The eight prayenge inestymable. The nyneth savor and pleasant
tastynge. The tenth the praise of voices without ^essynge.
THe first Joye of the party of the body is clerenes the which may be
compared unto four things. The first is unto the soul / for as much that
the soul shall be more dygne / more noble / and of more greter degree of
merit of as much unto him shall be yelden his body the more shynynge in the
douaire of the clerenes of glory / As for example. Who so takes a light great
or ly tell and it should put in a lamp / or in another vessel of glass / of
as much as the light should be the Benedicamus patre^ and filiu^ cu^ ^^o^
spiritu laudemus and superexaltemus ^u^ in secula. Dan^. iii.
more great / the said glass should be the more shynynge. The second
comparyson is unto diverse parties of the body / for a man ought not ymagen
that the eyes and the face of the body glorious aren in any degree more clear
and more shynynge than shall be the foot or the leg. The third comparyson is
unto these other bodies glorious / for in like wise as we see yt the son and
the moon and all ye sterres of ye sky have one such dyfference in their
clerenes yt tweyne may not be found in all semblables / a like thing is it of
the bodies of ye blessed. The fourth comparyson of the good works done during
the union of the body and of the soul in this mortal life / for the blessed
have glory and praise of all the good works yt they ever did in this world
for the love of god weren they in the estate of grace or in mortal sin / how
be it that in that there is great dyfference in like wise as it has been said
before. By the which it appyred that a man may desire to live longely for to
amend his life / and for to excercyse him in his good works / of the which a
man may have Joye and praise without end. The praise of the good deeds done in
the estate of mortal sin is a Joye accydentale the which comes as well
unto the body as unto the soul for as much that they have in some wise
disposicyon and preparacyon to return unto the estate of grace. Of that says
Alexander of hales in his sum that the good works may be such that during
the time that a man is occupied in them a man taryeth as for any succession of
time the mortal sin is not aggrauate during the occupacyon of those good
works. Also saint Bernardyne in his treatise de contractibus in the sermon
lxiiij. the which thus begins. Ecce ego vobiscu^sum and^. recyteth twelve
other prouffytes the which comen of good works done in mortal sin. First
they defenden the person from some sins in the which he should fall if
were not those good works. Also they dysposen the soul unto other or
semblables good works. Also they continue the soul in life mortal and
virtuous. Also those the which done their penance in such estate of sin
ben acquyte. Also they occupye the time in such wise that without those good
works a man should fall in to ydlenes or in to more great ylle. Also they
make the person partener in the good deeds of his neighbor. Also they letten
many great losses and cursyd adventures the which these sinners have deserved
and augmenten the goods temporels as ben health of body / richesse of gold and
silver / and of other possessions / for the which goods they shall have
honor and glory if they ben one time sauyd. Also they letten the puyssau^ce
of their goostly enemy the which had ye more great occasyon to make the
sinner to fall in to temptacyon if were not those good works. Also a man is
not so much punysshed in hell or in purgatory as if a man had been ydell or
occupied in evil works in the time that a man has done those good deeds.
Also they prouoken the bonte of the creatoure for to give grace unto the sinner
to reknowlege his gylte and for to find mercy. By the which it behooves to
say that the body and the soul of the saved have glory accydentale for such
works how be it that they have been done in the estate of mortal sin.

THe second Joye of the party of the body is perfect impassybylyte for four
things. The first for he may not have thing in this world that unto him may
be contraryous / be it withoutforth or within. The second for as much as the
body has other times endured in as much as mortal and passyble of as much
shall he be in the more high degree of Impassybylyte as before has been said
that some shall be more clear than other. The third for as much that all the
parties of the body shall be egall in such manner that if he were in the fire
of hell where an hundred thousand glauyes right sharp stryken again him
where he might not in any wise suffer them. The fourth for as much as the
contemperacyon of the four elements of the which the body humayne is
composed ben in their sovereign and right perfect consu^macyon by ye which
may never fall passion / corrupcyon / ne alteracyon / and in such wise they
abyden impassybles eternally^.

THe third Joye of the party of the body is subtylyte in four manners. The
first / for such body glorious may be with and wtin an other body not glorious
in like wise as the fire the which is a thing corporell may be by the way of
nature without and wtin in all the parties of an yren on fire and therefore if by
way naturell such penytracyon is done in a body not glorious / it ought not
to be right great meruaylle if it be done by puyssaunce dyuyne in the bodies
the which ben gloryfyed. The second for the body glorious shall not be Hec
dicit thomas anglici in suo. iiii.
with the body glorious / for two bodies glorious for to be togydres repugne of
good congruyte and unto the order that the sapyence inyfynyte has put in
things treat. The third / for the body glorious shall be egally subtyle in
all parts the which ought to be understand as to think on an other body not
glorious / for the eye shall not find more of resystence than the foot or the
hand and in like wise of other members / but nevertheless the one membre
shall be more subtyle or less after as it apperteyned unto the disposicyon of
the body humayne. The fourth is the body glorious shall be and abide in that
degree of subtylte ye he has deserved for ever without finding end and without
fyndy^ge resystence the which makes lettynge unto the will of ye soul but yt
the body glorious may be in a moment from ye heaven in the earth and from ye
earth in heaven / and from the one part of heaven in ye other in less space of
time than now it may be spoken understand / or thought.

THe fourth Joye of the party of the body is agylyte in four manners. The
first / for the body glorious shall be above all obeyssau^ce unto the will of
ye soul / and shall not let it in no mane^ but yt she be inco^tynent from
one place in to an other Augus xxii. de ci. (...) vbi volet spu^s ibi protinus
erit.
as may be now our thought as soon far as nere. The second / for the body
glorious shall not have more of disposico^n to descend than to ascend / but
all his propre inclynacyon shall be obeyed unto the puyssau^ce and will of the
soul the which such glory unto her has pryncypally purchased in obeyenge
unto the creatoure. The third for as much as the body glorious is not borne
from one place in to an other for necessyte or indygence as we see in this
world / but all oonly for the pleasure and glory of the soul / and therefore
in no thing that may be ymagyned the body glorious ought not to let or tarry
the soul. The fourth for as much as the body glorious may not alonge him from
the presence of god / for in what soever place that the body and the soul
glorious be borne always In ipso viuimus, mouemur and sumus eccle. xvii.
they ben present and have the clear vysyon of god. And so it appyred shortly
of the four douaires of the body that is claryte / impassybylyte / subtylyte /
and agylyte / the which ben of the high perfeccyon Corpus quod corrumpit^
aggrauat animam.
that is in the least of the glorious that is or the which finally shall be in
glory with ye blessed that none entendement with holden and aggreued in body
mortal ne may it comprehend / but every creature in his own right ought
faithfully to labor to the intent that he may finally have the experyence of
such meruaylle.

THe fyfth Joye of the party of the body is by cause of the habytacyon of y^
heaven emperyall for four things. That is to understand for the beauty / for
ye force and for the resonau^ce. The beauty of heaven is such and so great that
it may not be compared unto no beauty erthely. The gretnes of the earth is also
as nothing in regard of the gretnes of heaven / force / Joye / and gladness
there proceden and habonden in all parties in such manner yt the five wits
glorious ben soueraynly replenysshed every of them that that he appetyteth /
that is Ca^tate dn^o canticu^ nouu^. p^s. c. l. Ite^. Ca^temus dn^o gliose em^
honoridicatus e^ etc. exo. xv. In p^ma e^ laus vocalis prout dicit glo. super
illud. Exultaco^es dei i^ gutture eorum. Qui habitat in domo tua i^ secula
seculorum laudabu^t te. p^s. lxxxiii.
is to know that the sight is full of Joye and of gladness for four things.
The first is the humanyte of Ihesu christ. The second for the presence of the
glorious queen the mother of god. The third is in seenge the great and
innumerable company of the blessed. The fourth is for the clerenes of the
glory the which is the shynynge of all saints assembled in one light. Think
he yt may what thing it may be to see these things beforesayd / for no
writing ne may suffyse for to declare the one of them all oonly as it is /
also that the clerenes of the lest body glorious the which is or shall be
finally in paradyse shall be greter / than shall be the clerenes of the son
if she were. xiiij. times more great than she is now ones. O hertes humayns
think than what may be ye clerenes of the precious and right glorious body of
Ihesu christ and of his blyss^d and right dygne mother and also of other every
of them in his degree. But what may yt be of all together but oonly one depnes
of Joye and of gladness as much great as is yt light. And this is as unto the
fyfth Joye of the body.

THe herynge shall be full of Joye and gladness for four things. The first
shall be for ye melody of ye voice the which is and shall be herd in the
glory celestyall. The second for ye great nombre of them the which maken and
given such melodye / for there ben men and women / angels and archangelles
in one accord of dyuyne and celestyall musyke. The third for by cause that
the song be foresaid prodeth of love and of Joye infynyte. The fourth for the
reason of him unto whom is made such Joyous melodye / that is unto all the
blessed trynyte the which gives so much of goodness and so much of honor
unto all the company of the saved the which never may cesse to magnyfye god
and him to praise without noysaunce or being weary. And this is for the sixte
Joye of the party of the body.

THe smelle shall be full of Joye and of gladness for four things. The first is
for ye smelle of the precious body of Jhesu christ. The second for the savor
of ye virgyn Mary The third for y^ smelle partyculer of every saint in
paradyse. The fourth for an inestymable and redolente odo^re the which is
composed of all togyders / for in likewise as the sight and the herynge ben
full of swetnes and of melodye ye which proceden of diverse parties. so is the
smelling of every of them in partyculer and of all togydre. And this is for
the.vij. Joye of ye body.

THe taste shall be replenysshed with savor incompreuable / for in as much yt in
y^ glory of paradyse is al wealth assembled it behooved yt it replenysshe the
taste and the touching in like wise as these other wits corporelles / by the
which such thing is named in the gospel y^ dinner or ye souper of paradyse
for four reasons. The first for as much yt in likewise as the meet corporell
unto us co^trybuteth y^ life mortal of this present world. In like wise the
glory of paradyse contynueth ye life ^ternall unto all the sa^ed. Also for as
much as it suffyseth right abondau^tly. Also for as much as it gives
s^uerayne perfeccyon unto the operacyon of the taste / for of all the savors
pleasau^tes and delectables that ever were in wynes and meets in fruytes or
other things there shall be made and composed one sovereign the which shall
have the perfeccyon and delectacyon infynytly of all these other the which
contynually shall refresshe the blessed. Also for as much yt the ^ast shall be
ever more in (...) (...) and (...) disposicyon well to taste and to sa^^^^
(...) o^ less after the degree y^ the soul has (...). And in like wise is it
of the touching / for (...) shall be in such delectacyon that the pleasure ^
(...) ne may be declared by no tongue mortal / by the which things it appyred
in what ma^er and h^w after the fragylyte and little power of entendement
humayne / how the blessed ben ryght^ul of glory / of love / of Joye / of health
/ of gladness / of Si vis ad vita^ i^gred^ serua ma^data. Math. xix.
beante / of bonte / of richesse / and of all other goods without end and with
out mesure that may be spoken or comprysed by entendement of person morsall be
it as unto the glory of the body or of the soul. the which thing ought to
move / pryke / and exhort our hertes for to come unto such glory the which
right derely the blessed Jhesu christ unto us has conquered and promised
infallybly if we him will obey in holding the pathe of his right holy
commandments. And this is as unto the.ix. Joye of the party of the body.

OVer these things before spo^en and nombred Ha^c materia^ vid^ as i^
cathol^^on ^an^e^sis i ^llo verbo virgo.
it is to understand that there are certain persons among the saved ye
which have glory accydentall excellent and synguler / the which glory is
named aureole the which is as much to say a^ a little crown y^ which is
given unto such blessed for the synguler battle in the which they have be^
victoryous as ben those and they the which have kept pure ^ug^^yte with out
corrupcyon volu^tarye of their body be it in sy^^^ or other wise y^ they had
hope and purpose to mo^e come unto such victory for the love of god to have
in will alonely to break her virgynyte ne makes to lose the aureole if a man
him repent and that the deed has not ben accomplysshed. Also she the which is
defiled against her will and afterward perseuered in her good purpose shall not
lose the aureole / and if she had conceived lygne in the said vyolacyon. Also
the aurcole is promised unto doctors the which have vertuosly resysted unto
the devil as well for them as for their neighbors. And by the doctor ought a
man also to understand the good prechours and those the which written
doctrynes morales unto the glory of god and for the salvation of souls / for
unto such is promised the aureole and not all oonly unto them the which have
the degree and professyon of doctor. Also unto martyrs the which have had
vyctorye of the world in suffrynge the death or effusyon of their blood for the
love of god and for the trought of the holy faith catholyke. These three
aureoles has soueraynly the blessed Jhesu christ / for he is a virgyn and the
sone of a virgyn / doctor and martyr right excellent. Some of those that be
chosen have had as many aloonly / some ^ther tweyne and some other all three.

THe. x. Joye of the party of the body is for the praise vocale the which is
made generally unto every saved in partyculer and of all togyders before the
throne of the blessed trynyte pryncypally for four things. The first for as
much ^ Alia ^ claritas s^lis alia claritas lu^e et alia claritas stella^.
Stel^a ^i
god has given unto creature reasonable his ym^ge and his semblau^ce unto the
creacyon of things ^ in like wise as the gift of creacyon is incompreuable
differt a stella i^ c^aritete s^c and resur ^ ^tio mortuo rum. i. corin. xv. De
lyra. per clar^tate^ sol^s it^lligit^ cla^^tas xp^i per claritate^ lune
cla^itas virginis marie. per claritate^ stella rum claritas al^o rum sancto rum
and sancta rum
for the semblau^ce y^ which is between god and the soul deifyed and saved /
also is inenarrable the Joye of such comparyson of semblau^ce and y^ praise
the which for such gift and benefyce is yelden unto the creatoure. The
second for the redempcyon of humayne lygnage / for in that that y^ blessed
seen clearly and manyfestly the love infynyte that god unto them has showed by
his blessed In carnacyon and right pyteous passion / and the which them has
delivered from eternal dampnacyon / they given graces and praysynges vocales
and melodyous unto the redemp^our so much excellently that no mortal man ne
may it speak worthily. The third for the benedyccyon of the grace dyuyne of
the which the mercy infynyte them has worshypped and overcome in this world
and oftentimes them has called again / releued and preserved from great and
detestable sins as well by the mysterye of the sacraments of holy church as
also in g^uynge them the keeping and the service of all the blessed angels of
the cour^e celestyall / the which graces and benefyces all the saved known it
right well perfectly by the which they given praise unto god incessably. The
fourth for the glory unto the which they seen to be come and ben certain
that it shall never be less nor it shall never defayle neither in body ne in
soul / ^ut ben and shall dwell in eternyte of peace and of love in force / in
beauty / in youth / and all other goods more great and infynyte than any heart
ne may think. O right glorious company. O right glorious royalme. O right
delectable life. O felycyte infynyte. There is none suffycyant for you to
understand / for you to write / for you to nombre / for you to comprehend /
for all these things beforesayd notwithstanding that they ben of great
meruaylle plainly they ben a less thing in comparyson of the ryall veryte
than is a right little drop of dew in regard of all y^ water that god has
create. And therefore better it is to cesse so much to write and him to return
unto deugute oryson without the which none ought not any thing to begin in
like wise to end. And for the true god of mercy / of peace / and of consolacyon
/ fontayne of love / of pity / and of swetnes / the light infynyte and life
eternal unto you me yield dygne of cruel death / depnes of ignorance of all
mysery and of all wealth assured and indygne more than I can speak in you
besechynge right humbly that it may please you me to give taste and feeling in
this presentlyf that as of the pains of hell and of the Joys of parady se me
ye have given grace for to speak and in this present treatise to write unto
that that I you may fere and redoubte and finally with all mine heart you to
love. O creatoure of heaven and of earth the which right Justely gyuest hell
unto the dampened and your blessed paradyse unto the saved I confess and aduowe
to be that haytyf and sinner the which the goods of the body and of the soul
has right folysshely dyspended unworthy to lift up my face against the son
or the moon. But that with standing very god fader pyteous of every creature and
fontayne of mercy right Justely I require the aid of all your court celestyall
/ and right syngulerly of the virgyne glorious the mother of our sovereign lord
/ the ^rpnes of grace d(...)ne and advocate of sinners to the end that by
their intercessyons and excellent merytes my sins great and innumerables ben
unto me in this present life forgyuen and pardonned / and that this the which I
have here done by you and you / and for your glory unto you may be agreeable
and unto the edyfycacyon of every good creature not for my merytes or dyg^e
operacyons but by the infynyte bonte / swetnes / and humylyte of our blessed
savior Jhesus / and of his ^yght holy mother unto whom I me submytte and yield
unto the death and unto the life Amen.

more great ylle than may be spoken or thought to have be in these years and
days before said / that is that the commandments of god ben well nere all
dyspraysed and right dampnably trespassed / the which thing is the most
great exces of the dolorous pity that may be ymagyued / for than it follows
that almoost all the world the which reigned in these right peryllous and
dangerous days go unto perdycyon. The consyderacyon of the which exces has
be the cause motyue of the composycyon of this present book for the
consolacyon and reuocacyon of simple people. And to the end that those the
which it will read or here may consider that that they have auouwed unto holy
baptem and also to understand the trought of the commandments of god and of
the works of mercy. By the which knowledge they may them correct and purefye
from their sins by holy and entyere confession and to fere and redoubte the
horrible pains of hell in ferme hope to mow come unto the right glorious
company of paradyse mouynge the aid and benedyccyon of all the blessed trynyte
unto the which fader sone and holy ghost be honor and glory in heaven and in
earth / ex hoc sicut nunc et semper.
