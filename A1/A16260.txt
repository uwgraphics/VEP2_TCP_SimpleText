A pleasant and delightful History, of Galesus Cymon and Iphigenia: Describing
the fickleness of Fortune in love.

Translated out of Italian into English verse, by T. C. Gent.

Di rozzo inerto, e vil, fa spesso amore.
Generoso, et cortese, un nobil core.

TO THE READER.
FOR SO MVCHE AS (gentle Reader) Man is not born to ye only profit, and
pleasuring of him self alone (as witnesses TVLLIE.) But part of his birth,
his Country does challeng: part his parents, and part his friends? I thought
good therefore, to offer unto thy attentive and benevolent ears, this present
History: Wherein thou may see, the puissant force of ragyng love, and the
mutabylytie, and fickle state of Fortune: And so much the rather, I have
yielded this History into thy hands, for y^ it is affirmed, of grave and
ancient Fathers, that a History is to be esteemed and accounted, as a most
clear Glass, for imitacion, of ordering, and institution of man's life. Both
to young men, that by reading of diverse things, are made equal in wisdom, to
their Elders: And also to Au^cientes, whose continuance of time ministers
experience of many matters. Moreover, that it makes private men, worthy of
honor: forces ^lowte, and valiant Captains, (for emulation of glory*) to
accomplish invincible exploites:

Encourages Sowldiers to be more prompt, and ready (for desire of praise which
never dies) to hazard life for the sauegarde of their Country. And is a
terror to wicked men to offend, for fear of Infamy and reproach. For a
History is a Treasorer of Ualiaunce, and a witness against ill doers. I crave
not of thee any hyre for my pains (gentell Reader) but friendly acceptance,
and that thou would stop with an Iron Bar, and Bolte of Brass the ^elchyng
Nosethrils of RHINOCEROS subtle Snowte, and his raging* furious ^o wling,
co^pesce, and mitigate with perpended Judgment. And lastly, that thy friendly
word, breathyng and blowyng* a cool, and gentle blaste, of Golden Air, may
happily yield, unto my first fruits, a calm and favorable wind.

Fare ye well.

Read with advice: and scan with discrecion*

Your Friend to use. T. C.

The Argument.
Lo here, the fiery force of love,
redeemes the worthy wit,
From servile yoke: being drownde in sincke
and stinkyng muddie pytie.
Behold how Reason yeldes to love,
and Virtue gives place:
The Ruler, blinded by desire,
his noble fame deface.
And see how wavering Fortune turns,
with every blast of wind:
First, gentle face, then frowning f^ets,
she cast^ on longyng mind.
From lowryng looks, to smilyng cheers
she eftsoons flittes again:
The lingering lover thus she feeds,
with hope his love to gain.
And then from top of whirlyng wheel,
she throws him in the suddes:
The captive thence to ransom then,
with aid in haste she scuddes.
And graunts at length his wisshed pray
and only hearts delight:
Which he enjoyed against the force,
of foreign foes despite.
A pleasant and most delightful History, of GALESVS, CYMON, and IPHIGENIA.
AN Island stands in TRITONS reign,
that CYPRVS has to name:
A Seat sometime, of Kingdoms nyn^
renowmde with lastyng fame.
And for the great Amenitie,
and fertilnes of soil:
Not subject, or of value less,
then any Occean I Will.
Wherein, recorded lies in time,
of aged Fathers days:
Amonst the Ancient Chronicles,
and Monumentes of praise.
This History, so rare to hear,
as pleasant to be read:
Of such as can with skyll peruse
the same, with iudgyng head.
THere whilom was a noble man,
that ARISTIPPVS hight:
Whom Fortune decked with worldly gifts
above each other wight.
So that, both termed well, he might
and justly happy be:
If his good hap not clouded were
with Fortunes Tirrannie.
For ma^y Sons he had, yet one
in beauty bare the Bell:
In s^emlynes of stature, eke
did others far excel.
For all these gifts of nature, yet
a meycocke wretch, was he:
Whose name, his Parents first assig^de,
GALESVS for to b^e.
But sith, he neither could conceive,
by Tutours learned mouth:
The documentes of PALLAS Art,
nor Muses skyll in youth^.
Ne yet his fathers, grave Advise,
nor industry of guide:
Could make him lead a Courtiers life
or from his ^olie slide.
And (for his speech was gross, and thick^
and he inclined more
To beastly, rude behavior, then
to ciuyll Courtly lore.)
He was of all men (SIMON) call^e,
in jest, in sport and game:
Which word inferth, in Cyprian tongue
a vile, reprochefull name.
And when his idle sluggish life,
was grief, to fathers heart,
And of redress, he saw all hope*
was plainly laid aparte.
And fearyng, least he should be vexte
with daily present woe:
Sent CYMON, to vplandysh soil,
far from his sight to go.
And Husbandry to practice there.
amongste the Clownish sort:
Of such as delue, with Spade and Sholue,
not like to City sport:
Which thing, delighted Cymons heart
(for one so rude* as he,
Do joy in Swinish manners more
then in Cyuilitie.)
WHylste he therefore, in Country toil
and travail spendes the day:
In tearyng up with tusked Ploughe,
the Land, (that does repay
Twice toulde, and yearly, treble gain)
his mind he does convert:
In lieu of liberal Sciences,
of Tilthe to learn the Art.
It chaunc'de therefore upon a day,
at after noone, as he
Was walking, through his Fathers fields
his Meades, and Groves to see.
Alone with walking staff in hand
he entered in a wood:
But small: yet passing sweet of all,
that in the Country stood.
And (for it was the Month of May)
and temperate pleasant Air:
Being clothd with green delightful boughs
it seemde to CYMON fair.
Where vainly stalkyng up and down,
with gazing here and there:
To view the pleasure, of the place,
(Fortune his guide) came near:
And foot by foot, he passed through,
a little Meadow Plotte:
Which hugie Trees, with lofty tops,
had compast, as a Moate.
And through the place, a River ran,
whose springyng Silver Streams
Did flow with cool, and glisteryng ebbes,
against sir PHEBVS Beams.
Not far from which, upon the grass
he viewd, with fixed eye:
A Uirgyn there, surprisde with sleep,
of Beauty great, to lie.
The Garment, wherewith she was clad,
was thin, and shonne so bright,
That almost no part, of her Corpse,
was hid from CYMONS sight.
And she was girtte, below the waste,
with Lynnen, white as Skies:
Nigh her two handmaides, took their rest
an Eunuche, slept likewise.
When Cymon first, this Uirgyn viewd
amazde, be stood in mind:
Like as if he, in all his days,
had not seen Womankinde.
And leanyng on his knaggy Staff,
beholdes her Courtly grace:
And speachlesse restes, and marketh well
the Beauty of her face.
With diligence he prieth about,
with never winkyng eye:
Till all proporcions of her face,
^e did directly spy.
Then forthwith, in his senseless head,
and gross polluted mind:
(Which no step of U^^^anitie,
by vertisment of frinde,
And thousand gentle documentes,
could pearce, before this time.)
This new devise, is risen now,
this thought, his fancy clime:
Which musing, he in blockish brain,
to reason thus began:
And being brutish as he was,
in troubled head, did scan
The fulgent brightness of her face,
and (oh what thing,) said he,
Is equipollent, in this world
to her ^ormos^tie?
Then pondred he with i^dgyng eye,
her amiable look:
And viewed the Uirgyns seemelinesse,
in lieu of Psalter Book.
And noated all her lineamentes,
of perfect form and shape:
And praised greatly in his heart,
in Natures Art, her hap
And first her He^^e, like goulden wyre,
he painted forth with praise,
And fully was resolved in mind,
they shonne as PHEBVS rays.
And then her forehead, nose, and mouth,
her neck, her Arms and breast:
To laud in heart, and muse thereon
in mind, he never ceaste.
Thus he, a rude, vplandish man,
in twincklyng of an eye:
Is now become of Beauty Judge,
to scan of Phisnomie.
His greatest care, was now to see,
her splendent glisteryng eye:
Which drownde with sleep and drowsy dreams
fast closde with lids, did lie.
Which, (CYMON) that he might behold
was minded to awake:
From sleep, this Damsel bright yt he
the view thereof might take.
But sith she fairest seemde of all
that erst he saw with eye:
He began to fear, least that she were
a Goddess in the Sky.
And (for he was so blunt of wit,
that well he did not know:
If heavenly things, more worthy were
then things on earth that grow.
Therefore somewhat, he brideled lust,
and staide a time to see,
If that her eyes, of own free will
would wake, or opened be.
And though this pawsinge seemed long,
and grief it was, to stay
Unwonted pleasure, heald his heart
from partyng yet away:
Thus CYMON gazyng still, and yet
enioyng liberty
To gaze: out of her sleep, behold
she walk^th by and by.
Her name hight IPHIGENIA,
(so Parents did devise:)
Which, when she lifted up her head,
and opened wide her eyes:
And CYMON leanyng on his staff,
before her stand, she see:
Amazde in mind, these words, or like
to him then uttered she.
(For Cyprians, knew their CYMON well,
for his simplicity:
And partly for his Fathers wealth,
and great Nobylytie.)
What seekste thou CYMON in this wood,
at this time of the day?
Why wandrest thou so far from home
what causes thee to stay?
But Answer CYMON rendered none
to IHPHIGENIA:
But fi^t his staryng eyes, on hers,
not lookyng once away.
For sure (he thought) a passing smell,
and great suavitie
Proceeded from the fulgent light,
of pleasant pearcyng eye.
Which warmd his heart with present ^ight
and sodeine, wontlesse joy:
(A sovereign salve to Maladies,
to Cares, the chief annoye.)
But when the Uirgyn well had markd
his never winkyng look:
A chillyng horror shakd her limbs
and fear her Senses took.
For doughte, least his uncivil life,
with Clounish manners fraught:
Might cause suspect, of Uirgyns vaunte
that he, the pray had caught.
(Which seeing, might without desert,
redownde to her reproach:
And knowing well, how sclaunderous ^ongs
on Uirgyns fame encroche:)
In haste her handmaides she awak^e,
in purpose to depart:
And farewell (CYMON) then she said,
Adieu with all my heart.
The^ answered CYMON in this sort*
my heart shall way^e on thee:
(My ^oye) my self where ere thou go,
shall bear thee company.
And though she flatly did refuse,
his offered curtes^e:
Yet could she not reject her Mate,
until with open eye
He viewd, the stately dwelling place,
of her that made him thrall:
Whose Aunsweres were to him more sharp
then taste of bitter gall.
For when that swel^yng heat of love
did boil within his breast:
And ^lamyng fire, did burn his lymmes
and rage his heart oppressed.
And that he ^rau'de of her, (to quench
his drowgh,) one drop of grace:
She spewd forth spiteful tau^ting glikes
at him, with frownyng face.
And yet that most procured his grief,
was partyng from her sight:
That had attachd his Senses all
with view, of lively light.
For (when she past, with ste^lyng steps,
her Fathers hugie Gate:)
She bard the same with might and main,
against her friendly Mate.
Then booted not, he knew right well,
with showtyng cries to call:
And then perceived, she scornd his love,
yet he remainde her thrall.
A thousand thoughts then h^md his wits
in Cave and stuck of woe*
And sundry fancies framde, in him,
the root of grief to grow:
His Brain was eke, besiegde with care,
what ways he might devise:
To conquer hate: and gain the love,
of her, that bleard his eyes.
Thus musing now in mind, he stands
in study cold as Ice:
And still devising how he may
atchiue his enterprise.
At length determinde, to reuer^e,
unto his mansion place:
And still he hoopde, in tracte of time,
to look for better grace.
And tumbled now, on careful couche,
in Country Cabyn lay:
Inuentyng several ways, now this,
now that, he did assay.
But (sundry consultacions passde,)
in end, he did conclude:
To live exilde from Country soil,
(for Country Clownes are rude.)
Therefore, to Court in haste, he hyes
him, to his Fathers house:
And stoutely to his Parents swears
that he will hold the Plowes
No longer now, or dig, and delue,
and be a Country Slave:
But loathyng Country life, begyns,
a civil life to crave.
Then newly began his Fathers cares,
and treble, wonted woe:
His Friends, and Kinsmens grief likewise
began again to grow.
Yet purposde they, a while to stay,
the perfect cause, to know:
Of sodeyne chang, that forc'de this man
his former g^ise forgo.
Therefore: w^e^ Cupids shaft, had perc'de
this CYMONS restles heart:
Through which could never penetrate,
one ^ote of learned Art.
When CYMONS, sense was ravished
with IPHIGENIAES face.
Whose pulchritude of lively look,
his glimpse of eye, did daze.)
He, was not he, but changed his coat,
his manners he began
To change likewise, and was be come
from thence, an altered man.
This chang, to Courtiers seemed strange
a wonder, to his feeres:
An admiration, to his kin,
a joy to fathers years.
Then of his Father, first he craved,
to be apparaild brave:
As others of his Breethren were,
and like Attire to have.
His Father granted his request,
and straight began he then
To match himself, in fellowship,
of Courtly Gentlemen:
With diligence, he searchde, what things
were, to a Lover fit:
And now in stud^yng Tha'^te of Love,
(...) exercise his wit.
And (which is merueilous to tell,)
in mom^ntarie space:
To (...), geuyng hot delight,
he learning did embrace.
Amongste the wise Philosophers,
he gained likewi^e, fame
With musing moved, to all men's minds
that knew of CYMONS name.
The cause, of all this sodeyne change,
was IHPHIGENIAS love:
Which made him banish lobbish life,
and rudenes to remove.
For (love his guide) he did refourme,
the stuttyng of his tongue:
And of a ^^sked l^sping voice,
his speech most sweetly ronge
In vttryng pleasant words, and he
of Music learnde the Art:
Of skyll in strydyng tramplyng Steedes,
he had likewise, his part.
And skylfull was in feats of Arms,
and Acts of Chivalry:
In warfare, well experienced too,
by land, and eke by Sea.
And briefly, least his qualyties,
and virtuous deeds, I show:
First this, then that, particularly,
as in his heart they grew.
In fine, I say: in four years space:
he waxde a wiser man:
And of more tried towardness,
then any Cyprian.
So that, more eloquent in words,
and grave in countinaunce:
He was esteemde, then Courtiers all,
whom Fame, with praise did haunce*
What shall I therefore, speak of love?
my Pen how shall I frame?
To yield to him, deserved praise?
or blase his worthy fame?
For when the fatal Stars, had dewde
this CYMONS gentle heart:
With Gentleman like qualyties,
and skyll in Muses Art.
Disdainful nature, causde the same
within his heart, to lie.
Fast bownde and chainde with fettered linkes
in LETHE waves, to die:
And drown for aye, in whirlepools huge
yet Love vn^wounde the knot^e:
And vanquished nature with his force,
as foe, to luckie lotte.
For Love, oftimes is wont to raise
from duskish drowsy dreams:
The drowned wits, in sincke of ^louth*
and Grave of LETHE streams.
And wrapped in clowdie darkness thick,
CVPIDO bringes to light,
The Senses: ren^ing servile yoacke,
(such is his veil, and might^
And causes them with glimeryng beams,
eftsoons, for to appear:
And show ^o bright, to all m^ns sight,
as PHEBVS ^l^ming Sphere.
And raunso^mes o^te, the noble hearts,
from deep, and darksome den:
And brings the^, with his glittering rays
unto ^LISIOS ^enne.
Therefore, while swelti^g heat, of love
did thril through CYMONS heart
And he did (as the amorous sort,)
from right and reason starte:
Yet ARISTIPPVS was con^ent,
what ever CYMON did:
And ioyed to see his son, so chaungde*
which from his breast has ^yd
All noisome cares: for that by love
his CYMON now became:
From first, a sheep, and clownish lowte
a cyuill Gentylman.
The Father, daily adds Spurs,
unto his Sons ^esire:
And wills him never stay, till he
unto his lusts aspyre.
When CYMONS mind c^nceu'd the truth
his name GALESVS h^ght:
Remembering IPHIGENIA, callde
him, CYMON, in despite.
It grieved his heart, and then his care
was, to extirpe that ^ame:
And out of memrie, root and weed,
that lewd despightfull name.
And studiyng diverse times, to quench,
his parchyng Brondes, of love:
(Whose fi^rie flakes, his heart assaylde,
and mirth to mew had drove.)
Of IPHIGENIAS father, he
(who CYPSEVS hight) did crave.
In gaynyng o^ his daughters love,
his friendly will to have.
But he affirmthe, a former grant,
is now already pas^e:
And his consent, to PASYMONDE,
before was fully plac'de.
And said, he would not falsify
to him, his plyghted ^routhe:
(This PASMONDE was a Gentleman
of RHODES* and flower of youth.
And now the time, to celebrate
Thespousels, draws near:
The Bridegroom sent, to fetch the Bride
with gladsome merry cheer:
All this, when CYMON had reuolu'd
and pondred in his breast:
The time approaches now, thought he,
to purchase quiet rest.
If ever, now: he minds to show
to IPHIGENIA:
The scorchyng heat, of broylynge love,
that in his breast did stay.
And now with diligence, to prove
his vowed Loyalty:
With mighty hand, for to withstand,
her partynge from his eye.
For thee, (he said) I fry and swelt,
in Furnace, of desire:
For of a Beast, to manly shape
thou madste me to aspire.
If that the Gods will grant, that I
to wife, may thee enjoy:
And thy Society, to embrace,
that shall my cares destroy.
And doubtless, would I think in joy*
to pass my goulden years:
And for to lead an Angels life,
amongst the Princely Peers,
And certes, Death shall end my days,
with dint of bloody knife:
But I, in spite of hateful foes,
will win thee to my wife.
He (reasonyng thus, in troubled brain,)
his friends by stealth did call:
(Such as were borne, of noble blood,
to know what should befall.)
To private counsel, which he held,
and opened there his mind:
To them, and what he would have done,
he leaves not behind.
A Ship, then closely, he prepares,
and deckes with furniture:
Meet for the war by Sea: and long
against his foes, to dure.
Which vittailde well, and armed then
he enters in the Ship.
And cuttes the Seas, and sail, and stern,
to EOLVS does commyt.
The restless Tide, that bears his Bark
with waltryng waves ^n Sea:
Rows wambling forth: with hope and mirth
were fed his Mates and he,
Away, the meerie Mariner hales,
deuyding fomyng streams:
The braggyng Boy, hies up to top
of Mastes lofty Beams.
The waueryng Flag for Joy is vaunst,
the Seas begin to swell:
And he in hope amidst the storms,
of surgyng Seas, do dwell.
And there, for IPHIGENIA ES Sail,
he purposde then to stay:
In which the Rhodians, to her Lord
to Rhoodes, should her conuaye.
And now the Father of the Bryde,
receyu^d with courtesy:
And honor great: the men of Rhoodes*
which from her Husband be:
To Cyprus sent, to that intent,
to fetch her home in peace:
Which shortly leave, the fertyll land,
and lanche unto the Seas.
And toward Rhoodes, their Sails they bend^
and Mastes they do direct:
But CYMON lo, which to that end,
(thereof not once suspecte*)
Had warely wate^de, with wakyng eye,
the morrow ^exte appear:
When PHEBVS banished, mistie clouds
and shonne i^ Skies full cl^^re.
And with his garnisht Barcke for warr^
ad^urnde with Armor bright:
Encountered IPHIGENIAS Hulke,
not distant far from sight.
And standing foremost in the front
of swiftie Nauies Snoute:
To IPHIGENIAS company,
be cries with clamor stout,
And says: abide ye men of Rhoodes,
and quickly strike ye Sail:
Else none shall escape the Gulphe of Seas
(e^cepte my heart me fail.
Then drew his foes, their shini^g Blades
and armde themselves for fight:
With courage stout, and force, for to
withstand sir CYMONS might.
Whereto, when CYMON had respect,
he threw with man^y might,
A Grapple in the Rhodians Ship,
to let the same from flight.
Wherewith, he staide their Bark: and then
most firmly fastened it
Unto his Ship, with stemmes of Brass,
armde for the purpose fit.
And like the maned Lion then,
not crauynge aid of Mates:
Alone he leapes into their S^ip,
and troubles all estates.
For (love, augmentyng t^en his force,)
he runs with valiant heart:
Upon his foes, with bytyng Glay^e,
and plays the Tigers part.
And like the Calydonian Boar,
or LERNAS Lions fierce:
Whom ere he ratcht* with Transfer bright
their faintyng ly^^s, did pearce.
From some, he carved the shoul^er boane,
from others, made to slide
The legs: from others, he likewise
did head from Corpse divide.
And when of them were diverse slain,
and many wounded sore:
And here did one, another there,
lie sprawlyng in the floor.
The Rhodians, then perceyuyng well,
theirforce, was far unlike:
And half despeyryng, in their strength,
thought bootelesse was to stryke,
Or make resistance: and they saw
by flight they could not seape.
To him did yield their captive corse,
to whom, thus CYMON spoke.
YE men of Rhodes, not want of wealth
nor greediness of pray:
Nor cancred hate, restes in my heart,
or toward you do stay:
That moved me come, from Cyprus soil:
and you vnarmde, invade,
In midste of Seas: being armde my self,
with kee^e and caruyng Blade.
But this is cause, that force me thus,
and seems great, to me:
Which to atchieue, I make account,
a recompense to be.
In guerdon of my former toil,
and hyre of travail pas^e,
Which easily, and with quiet, you
may grant: (and purchase rest.
Mine IPHIGENIA, she it is,
who dearer is to me:
And grateful more, then land or life,
is her socyetie.
Whom, when by gentle means I could*
not of her Father gain:
Love forc'de me the^ with Shield, with Spear
and Swoorde, her love obtain.
And armde with glitteryng Helm, and creste
by violence her to take
From you: For so my mind is bent,
my Spouse and feere to make
Her. And in lieu of PASYMONDE
his function execute:
Wherefore, deliver her to me,
in haste, without pursuit.
And NEPTVNE guidyng well your sails
to pass the swellyng Seas:
Reuerte into your native land,
and hence depart with peace.
The Rhodians then, wh^m force co^straind
not frank, and free good will:
With weepyng eyes, the Uirgyn yeldes
Sir CYMON now until.
Which, when she saw her Corse was pledge
and ransom for the rest:
The trickling tears, like flowing stremes
distylled down her breast.
Then (gentle Uirgyn) CYMON said,
blurre not thy face with tears:
But dry thine eyes, and cease thy grief,
there is no cause of fears.
I am thy CYMON, that long time,
have loved thee in my heart:
And more deserue'd thee, to my wife,
then PASMONDE, for his part.
For broylyng brands, of lawless love,
have pearc'd for thee, my breast:
And PASMONDE only claymeth thee
by reason of beehest
And covenant, which thy father made,
(this said) he does return,
Unto his Mates* which in the Ship,
did all that time, soiourne.
And brought his IPHIGENIA
to Ship with him by hand:
Unspoylde of stuff, the Rhodian Ship
he sent to Rhodian land.
Then CYMON, which on live, did think
himself the happiest wight:
Enrichde with such a Royal pray,
and precious to his sight.
D^uised with his fellows now,
their voyage to direct:
On Seas, not to the Cyprian Soil:
but backewarde to reflecte.
By commen counsel holden, they
agreed, to Creete to sail:
Where all, and chiefly CYMON thought,
their foes could not prevail.
Against them there, for that they had
both friends and kinsmen too:
So now, by all men's full consent,
to Thyle of Creete, they go.
Then lanche they forth, and hoiste up Sail
(O TRITON be their guide:
And bring them safe to wisshed Port,
their face from foes to hide.)
But see how waywarde Fortune now,
begyns to turn her wheel:
And grutchyng at his good success,
her crooked Spyndelles reele.
For she that CYMON gratified,
with IPHIGENIA:
As noble, famous Goddess? now
has to^^de her face away.
And changde his Joys, and goulden hap,
in moment of an hour:
To soakyng sighs, to waylynge groans,
of frownyng Fortunes lowre.
Be packynge Muses, to your Mownte,
your help is bootelesse, here:
I must amongst the Hellish shades,
go seek, to find MEGERE.
ALECTO, fly from LIMBO lake,
and scudde from PLVTOS den:
And with your aid, assiste my Uerse,
direct my rugged Pen.
TWice.ij. hours* scarcely ended were
sith Rhodi^ns home return:
But night with dimming darkness came,
and mistie clouds by turn
Appearde in Skies: to CYMONS heart,
a joyful wisshed night.
Which should be pleasant more, he thought
to him: then ever chanc'de to wight.
But lo, a stormy tempest rise,
the Skies with clouds are black:
And wauie Seas, with whirlyng winds,
do toss the Ships to wrack.
This hurly burly, blindes their eyes,
and dulles their Senses so:
That of them all, not one man knew,
what thing was best to do.
For all men, then began to fear*
forgettyng Shipmens skyll:
But who can paint with proper terms
or plainly Pen, with quyll.
What gr^e^e y^ time, gripte CYMONS heart
for Gods would not regard:
He thought, the force of flaming love,
and sith before he sparde
Not: life to lose, his love to win,
in thought, then sure, said he:)
With sharper stinge of death, the Gods,
will take revenge on me.
Now Cymons Mates, do weep and wayle
But IPHIGENIA
Above the rest shed bitter tears,
and often cried wellawaye.
And gul^fde with gripyng ^ittes, did quail
at every blaste of wind:
And every storm of wallowing waves,
oppressed with wo^her mind,
And drownde her eyes, with sal^ish tears,
she utterly deteste:
Sir CYMONS love, and boldness, that
had purchaste her vnreste.
As though, that stormy whirlwindes, not
of other cause did swell:
But by the wrathful ire of Gods,
to wreacke with fury fell
His boulde attempt: And wyllyng not
that CYMON should enjoy
The rauishte Uirgyn, quietlye,
or fr^e, without annoye.
But sure she thought, by sentence just,
of Gods, they both should die:
And end their wretched direful days,
in woeful myserie.
Amongst these Girlysh waylynges, the^^,
and anguish of the mind:
The watermen, and Maryners,
were wauerynge as the wind,
And doubtful much, which way to turn
their Ship, and them to save:
And (still the winds beginning more,
with boysteous blastes, to rave.
Their bark, was driu^ to the I Will of Rhodes
which for the tempest, they
Could not discern, and know to be,
upon the Rhodian Sea.
And studiyng now, for only health,
they put their helpyng hand:
Both all, and some to leave the Seas,
and bring their Ship to lanoe.
Where (as the Constellacions wrought)
they landed at that place
To which the Rhodians came before,
which CYMON let to pass.
And yet they knew not that they were
ar^u'd at Rhodes, before
That SOL displaide his splendent beams
next morrow on the shore.
For then they saw, the Ship at Haven,
which they did let depart:
The day before* not distant more,
from them, then throw of Dar^e.
Wherefore, Sir Cymon pensive now,
least that should chance did fear
To him, which happed presently,
as you shall after hear.
Then he commaundes with diligence
the Ship from thence remove,
In ^aste: not caryng to what Port,
their Tacklynges else they shooue:
For well he knew^, all other Ports,
from dangers more were free:
And SCYLLAS womb, less wrackfull,
where now they landed be.
The Shipmens painful travail, and then
his Mates endeavor now
Were bootelesse: For the shrillie winds,
still backewardes did them blow.
And by their force and sturdie strength,
are driven upon the shore:
Against their will, for wrastlyng still,
to turn from thence their Ore.
The winds did land them, at the Haven
of Rhoodes: where by and by:
The Rhodian Shipmen, knew right well
and did them straight descrie.
Then of them one, did hastily run,
to Town, not distant far:
Where all the route, of Gallantes stout,
that time assembled ware.
And orderly, reuealth to them,
that IPHIGENIA:
And CYMON, blown y^ stormy blasts
tossed on the roaryng Sea.
Are now arrived at Rhodian land,
and all the circumstaunce,
He shows to them: And all things else,
that hapte to them, by chance.
(Which heard) the lusty youth of Rhodes
did leap for present joy:
Even like, as did the valient Greeks,
at overthrow of Troy.
And rushyng forth, like ragyng route,
they mustred many men:
And then with speed, unto the Seas,
they flockmeale, all did run.
Where CYMON, hasting now his flight
with IPHIGENIA:
The Rhodians, him in midst of course
preuente, and make to stay:
Yet failed not his noble heart,
to stand in his defense:
Against the Rhodian warlyke Troop,
for first, he did dispense.
With life: And wyllyng was to spend,
his blood upon his (...)*
And many, by his Knightly force,
their S^nces did forgo.
And thr^ugh his prowess, some did yield
to ATROPOS their breathe:
And some were maymde, and other slain
with direful darte of Death.
Yet ^^^led not, his valiant Acts:
and chiualrous Renown:
For taken, him they Prisoner led,
to next adioynyng Town.
Then thither came LISYMACHVS,
which in that year by chance:
Was Maiestrate: And in that I Will
had chiefest governance.
Being guarded with a warlyke route,
co^maund^s, that CYMON, then
And all his Aidantes, should be thrown
to deep, and darksome den.
For PASMONDE, and the Senate (...)
of Rhoodes appointed to.
When they, how all the matter stood,
effectually did know.
Now has the unhappy Lover, loss
his IPHIGENIA.
Whom he had gainde not much before,
by fight upon the Sea.
Of whom he never tasted sweet,
besides a little hope:
For hire of pains allredy pas^e,
to reap the goulden croppe.
Save that, he collde her lilly neck,
and kissed her rosy lips:
And claspte her often in foulded Arms,
again: her Corpse he clyppes.
But all this sudden joy, is turnde
agyne to wonted woe:
His IPHIGENIA, now he must
against his will forgo.
Thus wandrynge wide, to seek for rest,
in stormy tides is trapte:
And labouryng long, through Gulphes of waves,
in care unawares, is wrapte.
Then fawnyng Fortune framde (he said)
with painted face for sh^e:
O brittle cursed Fate, that forc'de
my state to alter so.
The chief, and ancient Matrones, then
receiu'de her courteously:
And cherisde her with nourishmentes:
And of captyuitie:
Being partly sad, her gulpyng grief
with sola^e, they appease:
And partly weried, with the toil,
and travail on the Seas.
And there abode she still with them,
vntyil the appointed day.
To celebrate Thespousell rites,
had chasde the night away.
To lead a captive Prisoners life,
the Senate granted now
To CYMON and his Mates, for that
some favor they did show
Unto the Rhodians: (for they gave
them, license to depart:
With bag, and baggage, free from death)
But PASMONDE, for his part,
With instant suite, did urge that they,
in prison might be slain:
To which, they were condemnde for aye
to lead their lives in pain.
Where they should end their wretched days
(as Reason did require:)
While breath does last, depryu'de of hope
to pleasures to aspyre.
The mean while now, when PASYMOND
for Nuptialles does prepare:
And all provision needful, he
prouides with carkyng care.
Behold, how Fortune moved with ruthe
of former act repent:
And now for CYMON, healthful ayd^
she friendly does invent.
Thus, lo: in gripe of death is life,
in Hell mouth, help is found:
And LACHESIS, the knot half losde,
has fast, and firmly twounde.
For entryng in, at PLVTOS door,
and yeldyng up the Ghost:
With gaspyng often for breath, see how
his virtue, Death has just.
And life begynnes in him again,
to run his wonted race:
So, Death is banishd, and life restorde
by Fortunes gentle grace.
THis PASMONDE, had a Brother, namde
HORMIDAS, young of years:
But yet not less, in valiantness
then PASMONDE, or his peers.
Which (long deliberation had)
decreed to take to wi^e:
A Uirgyn callde CASANDRA: and
with her to lead his life.
And for she was, of seemly shape,
adournde with Courtly grace:
LISYMACHVS the Senator
did coueit to embrace.
With stretched Arms, her comely Corpse,
whom with affection: he
Lykde in such sort, that he desirde
her Lover for to be.
For restless rag^* of scorchyng love,
tormented so^e his heart*
Being clapped unawares in V^NVS clawe^
and stong with CVPIDS darte.
Now PASIMONDE, S^temp^^i^yng,
the Nuptial iolytie:
With sumptuous preparations, as
was mee^eor his degree.
Thought good, his Brother HORMIDAS,
for to persuade, that they
Might (entryng both in IVNOES Rites,)
be Brydegr^omes on adaye.
So should they save, the double charge,
and coasts, of Marriage feast:
Yet meante he, that of b^th their charge,
his Brothers should be least.
He therefore, with CASSANDRAES friends
the matter does (...)
And of her father ^rau'd, to grant
her, to be feere, and mate
Unto his Brother HORMIDAS:
and given to him, to wy^^*
They should be ioynde i^ sacr^d bonds,
of wedlock* all their life.
And that same day, as (...)
his IPHIGENIA:
His Brother should be married (...)
his Lady CASSANDRA.
These consul^acions, cor^yes were,
unto LISYMACHVS hea^te:
For (wanne of hope: and comfortless)
from joys, he did depart:
Yet with persuasions, fancy feeds
him, that CASSANDRA will,
Be linckd with him, in IVNOES laws,
and his desire fulfill.
If that HORMIDAS wedde her not,
and take her to his wife:
These, and such like occursions, then
in mazed mind were ryfe.
But as a prudent man should d^^,
(that claymes of wisdom part:)
He closely k^epes, his dolor deep:
enc^einde, within his heart.
And compassyng in swarming brain,
what ways he might with sp^ede:
Disturb this Marriage, could not find
a lawful means, in deed.
Therefore, agrees he with him self,
and fully does conclude:
To win by force, the Uirgyns grace,
and cares so to exclude.
which, well (he thought,) he might atchiue
and plainly bring to pass:
For that he bare the chiefest sway,
and honor in that place.
On th^ther part, his dignytie
and tipe of high renown
Renockte him, from that enterprise,
which to his shame, should sown.
For that his ^shining Fame, does add
dishonor to the fact:
The more, if one of his estate,
commit so lewd an act.
But after much aduisement had,
Sir Love, did gain the place,
Of honesty: and Reason too,
to lust, did yield his trace.
And now LISYMACHVS, does haste
with danger of his health:
Yea: and with loss of life: to take
his pray away by stealthe.
And roulyng often in searchyng head,
what order he might take:
Or what assistentes he might use,
an end ther^^to make.
An^ bring the matter to good pass,
bethought himself an (...):
(As hap would have, and Fortune gave)
of CYMON that did mon^
His thraldom, being closely clapte,
in Gayle, and Dungeon deep:
Where straightly, him, and all his mate^,
the Wardeyne still did keep*
He, therefore pondryng well, the cause
with, heart, and hand agree:
Unto this sentence: which, he minds
should ra^yfied ^ee.
That no man could be found more true,
or of fidelytie:
This weighty charge, to take in hand
then CYMON was, whom he
The next night after, brought by stelthe,
from deep, and Hellike lake:
Unto his Chamber, bossde with Goulde,
and thus to him he spoke.
ORATION LISYMACHI AD CYMONEM.
Even as (sir CYMON) Gods are bent
and always ready be.
To give their gracious gifts to men
with store abundantly.
So do they too require of them,
both paynfull industry:
And valiantness with diligence.
and whom again they see
Strong hearted, in calamity,
to suffer crabbed chance:
Those they, as worthy, manlyke men
to honors great advance.
The Gods would, of thy courage stout,
a greater trial take:
And more experience, of thy might.
(more glorious it to make.
Then thou thy self, in Fathers house,
of riches (...) with store:)
Could make to shine, and show it self
like bright, and glistring ore*
And (as the Fame flies through y^ town)
the Gods, have framed thee:
Of dull, and senseless block: a wise,
and witty man to be
Besides: with Fortune wrastlyng now,
and thrall to filthy gayle.
The Gods will try thee, if thy strength,
within thy heart do quayle.
Or if thou be that man, as earste,
when thou with manlyke might:
Obteinde the happy conquest: and
didste win thy pray by fight:
For if thou show thy self the same,
(as late thou were,) to be:
The Gods, did never give to man,
more mirthfull iolytie.
Or wisshed pleasure, and more Joy
th^n now they do entende:
To grant and yield unto thy heart,
thy heaped cares to end.
And what that is, I will in brief,
and few words, tell to th^e,
That thou maiste gather wonted heart,
and animositie.
THe glad* and joyful PASYMONDE
at thine unhappy chance:
And chief procurour of thy death,
makes haste himself t'aduaunce.
In marriage, to thy rightful Bryde,
thine IPHIGENIA:
Thespouselles eke to celebrate,
appoinctes a solemp^e day.
That ther^y, he might taste the sweet,
of that thy conquerde pray:
Which smiling fortune, gave to thee,
and frowning took away.
And well I know, what cors^e this
should be unto thy heart:
If in thy breast, of scaldyng heat
of love, thou feale the smarte.
HORMIDAS lo^: that self same day,
intendes like injury:
And wrong to me, and like despyte,
with hateful Tirranie.
For he will wed CASSANDRA, whom
I mind to take to wife:
Whose sight, so dear is to my heart,
as is to m^e my life.
To take revenge, of this reproach,
and contumelious wrong:
Fortune, has only manhood left
to us: as Fortress strong.
Go too therefore, and (she our guide)
let us with naked Blade:
Make viotent way, and valiantly
resistynge Foes invade.
To second rauisshement, for thee
pluck up thy noble heart.
And first for me, let force be found,
To play his w^nted part.
If thou wylt stoutly follow me,
the Captain, of this ^^cte:
And guide of famous enterprise,
and glorious shyning fact.
Behold, I yield into thy hands,
both ancient liberty:
And IPHIGENIA, I will give,
thy lawful wife to be.
The^ which two things, thou ought it ^raue
none earthly Treasure more:
(For hearts delight, all men prefere.
and health, their wealth before.)
These saynges of LISYMACHVS,
did CYMONS heart revive:
And ^rylled, through his ^rased Corse,
where Death, with life did strive:
And hope, has vanquished now despeyre,
and wilshed quiet rest*
Enioyes within his heart, the place,
that dolors once possessed.
Then presently without delay,
unto LISYMACHVS:
Sir CYMON, framde his filed tale,
and then, he answered thus.
(LISYMACHVS) thou shall not find^
(...) hardier man then me:
Or of more tried faithfulness,
or greater Constancy.
To compass this thy stout attempt,
if so (as thou do say:
That Fortune shall pursue the fact,
in yeldyng granted pray.
Therefore, what charge unto my lot,
thou will assign, forsee:
And look what office thou appoincte,
shall grateful be to me.
And I will tread what pathe thou will
and venture life, to tread
Amidste the steps, of enemies Tents,
or yeldyng Serpents head.
Say on therefore, not heartlesse, I
or dreadyng fumyng foes:
Will follow thee my Captain, though
my life thereby I lose:
To this LISYMACVS replied,
within two days, said he:
Our foes concluded to proceed,
unto Solemnytie.
In marriage of thy wife and mine,
and then they shall be brought:
Unto their Bridegroomes mansion place,
lo: thus I have bethought.
We armde, with other trusty Mates,
at first watch of the night:
Shall rushynge in the house, convey
them from the feast, by might:
And ra^ishde: bring them to a Ship*
which for that purpose, I
Have made: and hoouerynge causde on seas,
not distant far, to lie
And no man will we spare, of those,
that will our purpose stay:
Or our intent, with violence let,
forestallynge us, the way.
The order, to accomplysh thus
the matter, pleased him well:
Which in the Prison, till that day,
dissembling wise did dwell.
And now has PYROEIS* EOVS eke,
with AETHON, and PHLEGON,
Drawn forth in Skies, the golden wain^
of bright, and glisteryng Son.
And lo: AVRORE, her purple doors,
has opened in the east:
And LVCIFER, has chasde the stars,
and LVNA takes her rest.
The day assignde, for marriage rytes,
of lovers wishde, is come:
Which gorgeously, solemnizde were,
with pomp: of all, and some
While all the house, of brothers both,
with regal riot, shine:
And they in midste of costly cates,
and quaffyng BACCHVS wine:
The mean while, ^ow LISYMACHVS
not sleapyng his entente:
Appointed well, with needful things*
to due accomplishment.
Of late decr^ed enterprice,
his carved Blade does hide:
Within his Garment: so the rest,
for fear, least they be spyde.
Sir CYMON then, and CYMONS men,
and his men, he divide:
To three wings: lottyng to each rank,
a Captain, and a guide.
For some by stealthe, unto the Haven,
LISYMACHVS has sent:
Least Rhodians, stay their purpose, and
of shyppyng them preuente.
Some in y^ Porch of PASMONDS house
he closely causde to stay:
For fear therfoes, their passage stop,
or enterclude their way.
He, with the rest, and CYMON too,
about pr^fi^ed time:
And as agreement was before,
the Brydale house do clyme.
They scale the walls, and win the Forte
then enter they with force:
The suppyng Chamber, where the Brides,
refreshd with food their Corse.
Amongste them, other Ladies sat,
by order, in degree:
At royal Table, richely dight,
and garnishde sumptuously.
With massy Bowls, of golden Cups,
bedecte with Pearl, and Stone:
With other Ge^mes, APOLLOS beams
not much unlike that shonne.
And furnishde well with special cates,
and dainty Princelike fare:
Yet CYMON and LISYMACHVS,
for naught their purpose spare.
But Tables headlong down they hurl,
and rush with revel coil:
And take their Ladies, each his own,
deuidyng so the spoil.
And to their Pages them commyt,
which to that end did stay:
To bring with speed unto their ships
their long desired pray.
The Brides, and other Matrones then
complete with howlynge cries,
With waylings huge, and clamours great,
do fill the hautie Skies.
Now CYMON and LISYMACHVS,
with bloody Blades in hand:
Do make them way, for no man dare,
with force against them stand.
Descendyng swiftly down, they pass
the Stayers with hasty foot:
For (gainde their booty) there to stay,
they thought it was no boot.
Where PASMOND met with them, and mazde
with all this rustlyng broyle:
And troublous rufflyng: purposde then,
to rescue conquerde spoil.
And armde him with a hugie Staff,
and rashly wantynge might:
To CYMON ran with headlong pace,
to vanquish him by fight:
But all in vain, with peised stroke,
well aimed at his head:
He feld him, where he staggeryng lay*
before his feet for dead.
HORMIDAS too, endeuouryng now,
to quitte his Brothers death:
Through CYMONS wou^d, lies on the ground
and gaspeth for his breathe.
And diverse other reelde to the earth,
that by his might were slain
Which hand to hand, durst ieebard life,
the Combatte to darrayne.
Thus have these Lovers, won with Sword,
and ventred life to gain
Their Ladies. And withstanders all
before their feet are slain.
And then, they leaving PASMONDES house
reflowynge all with blood:
(Whereof the great effusion staynde
the ground, where as they stood.
And bellowyng often, with weepyng groans
and boisterous stearyng prease)
Without disturbers, all arryue,
in safety, at the Seas.
And setlynge in the Brigantine,
the Uirgyns won by force:
And clymbynge with their Mates, the Ship,
they take the Sea, perforce.
Committyng to the wind, their Sails,
and using Shipmens Art:
And active diligence: with speed,
from shore, they all depart.
Which presently was stoorde with such,
as ^atsome aid did bring,
Unto the captive Damselles: that
for woe, their Ioinctes did wringe.
But they came safe to Th'ile of CREETE,
where, of their friends, they were
And kinsmen: Gestwise entertainde,
with gentle, curteise cheer.
Where at their enter in the Town,
the Belles for joy were ronge.
And thousands came by heaps to meet,
Sir CYMON, and his thronge.
And after duty done, they cried
all, with consentyng voice:
And said: The Gods (Sir CYMON) grant thee ever to rejoice.
And spend the rest of vital days,
in heaped store of mirth:
Till ATROPOS shall cause thy Corse
entumbde to lie in earth.
For thou haste tasted soppe of gall,
before thou did obtain:
In hyre of restless, tossyng toil,
the long desired gain.
Where, after few days spent in sportes
and showtyng pleasant plays:
And solemn feasts, to mighty MARS
for yeldynge happy prays.
They celebrate the Nuptial joys,
and wed their wis^^ed wives:
Enioyng of that rauine myrthe,
contynuynge both their lives.
Amongste the RHODIANS, CYPRIANS eke,
great discord did ary^e:
And troublesome encumbrance spronge
twixte them in hateful wise.
But finally, on either part,
entreatie of their friends:
And kynsmens medyacion, tournde
their foes obdured minds.
And stablishde then: that (for a time,
sustained brief exyle:
And banishment from natyue land,
to last a ly^le w^yle.)
With IPHIGENIA, CYMON should,
at CYPRVS Soil soiourne:
And with CASSANDRA home to Rhodes
LISYMACHE might return.
Each to his Country back again,
in short time to reuerte:
Where, with their wives, they lyu'd in joy
with glad and merry heart:
For when the storms of cancred hate,
were ouerblowen and past:
And scorneful spite, had spew^e his gall
on Seas by whyrlynge blaste.
And Enuies belching Jaws were stopde
by VENUS loving Boy:
And tracte of time, ware out of mind,
all gnawyng cares anoye.
And LETHE gulffde in drenchyng brink
the death of PASIMONDE:
And IPHIGENIA, now dischargde
of former vowed ^o^de.
Did yield at length with willing mind,
to CYMONS gentel heart:
And by the grant of wisshed grace,
deuorc'de his former smarte.
And thus they passde their happy days,
in never diynge bliss:
Of which, I crave of God, for aye
good Ladies never miss.
