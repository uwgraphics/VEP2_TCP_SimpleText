The true remedy against Famine and wars.

Five Sermons upon the first chapter of the prophecy of Joel, wherein the
Council that the holy Ghost gave the Israelites to redress the famine which
they felt and prevent the wars that were threatened to come upon them; is
applied in particular unto our present time: Preached in the time of the
dearth. 1586.

correction.

AT LONDON. Printed by Robert Walde-graue, for T. Man, and T. Gubbins.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, Lord AMBROSE DVDLEY, Earl of Warwick, Baron Lisle,
Master of her Majesty's Ordinance, Knight of the most noble order of the
Garter, and one of her Highness privy Council: And to the right Honorable, and
godly Lady his wife; John Vdall, wishes increase of all true Honor, and
comfort in this life, and everlasting happiness, in that which is to come
IT has ever been the natural disposition of man, (right Honorable) in all
those miseries that fall upon him, to turn his mind a contrary way, and
think amiss of the cause of his estate and condition, and thereupon to use
such means for the redres thereof, as shall never amend, but rather make worse
that which they would help; or if they take in hand any of the ways that be
lawful, yet it is that which should be the last, as their own policy and
wisdom, and never think of their sins that have procured Gods displeasure
against them, that they might begin by repentance to seek reconciliation with
him: which prepostrous dealing does not only possess the heart of particular
men, but also bears the swaye (for the most part) even in commonwealths
and gouernements. For we see, that when any thing is amiss in the same, there is
great consultation, and provident aduising, how things may be redressed: but
the ways that be taken, are (for the most part) framed in the shop of humane
policy only, and therefore the effect thereof, is but as the loppinge of some
boughs or twigges from the top of a tree, after which, it does rather
flowrish the more, then wither away: whereas it should be considered, that all
ennormities and disorder do proceed from sin, and every breach in a state,
from the displeasure of the Lord for the contempt or neglect of his holy
commandments: and therefore (if ever we look to have our policies prosper)
to search more narowly into the will of God, to the end it may be established
with more authority, and practiced with more holy obedience; and then should
those wise plots, that the guiftes of nature or experience do teach us, (when
once they com in their place attendinge upon that Sovereign scepter of Gods
most blessed word) receive a blessinge from the Lord and have a good issue,
which else shall be as the wind, that beeinge long traveled of, when it is
brought forth does vanishe, as the smoke in the sight of the sun. This
lesson does the holy Ghost, (by this his Prophet JOEL) teach unto us in his
first chapter, more at large, the doctrine whereof (as near as I could
remember) according as the Lord did enable me to utter it, I have penned,
being drawn thereunto, both by the importunity of some, whom I might not well
deny in so honest a request, as also by the conueniencye of the doctrine, for
the instruction of more then heard it.

Now among many other notable instruments, that the Lord (in his mercy)
has stirred up, not only to wish well unto, but also to travail for the
good of that poor people his faithful servants, among whom it has pleased
him to place me, not only I, but they also do stand bound in duty (and shall
so remain still) unto your HH. for that careful diligence, that it pleased
you both to use, then, to entreat for us, when (if God had not been on our
side) the floodes of malicious men's practices had run over our heads, to the
utter undoing of all good beginninges among us, so that whatsoever good it
shall please the LORD to do in his Church by my weak labors, (whereunto
I thought an end had been added) your Honors may justly be reputed the
instruments of the same: In regard whereof, I (desiringe too have some
opportunitye, to show the thankfulness of our hearts) have especially made
choice of your Honors, unto whom I might dedicate these my poor labors,
most humblye intreatinge the same, to accept hereof, not according to the
valewe that it caryeth, (which is very small) but according to the affection
of the giver, who acknoweledging himself (together with that people which
have the benefit of my ministry) to be bound to pray unfeignedly unto the Lord
for your Hh. that it would please him to increase all the graces of his
sanctifying spirit upon the same, to the further advancement of his glory,
the greater benefit of his poor Church, and fuller consolation of your own
souls. Sobeit.

JOEL. 1. verse. 1, 2. The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of
Pethuel. Hear ye this, O elders, and hearken ye all inhabitants of the land,
whether such a thing has bin in your days, or yet in the days of your
fathers.
COncerning the time when this Prophet lived, and prophesied, diverse men have
showed their diverse judgments and opinions: whereof, if the best and most
probable be received, yet it is but a conjecture, and therefore I will leave it
(as does the holy ghost in this place) undetermined, and so much the rather,
for that the ignorance thereof, brings neither any damage to the truth of
the prophecy, nor yet any darkness unto the understanding of the same. This
only is to be observed, that the time when he lived, and the age whereunto he
did prophecy, had great need of the doctrine which he taught them: for that
(as appears by the course of his words) they were grown unto great
extremity in rebellion against the Lord, and besotted so senslesly in their
iniquity, that albeit the hand of God was heavy upon them, yet they
considered it not, but to the end that those on whom God had ordained to
bestow his grace, might be rowzed out of their sleepiness, and they whom in
his heavy and eternal displeasure he had cast off, might be made the more
without excuse: the Lord stirred up this prophet to speak unto them, which
teaches unto us this doctrine for our instruction, that in those places, and
among that people, God never punishes in his visible church before he give
warning.
where (in any manner) his name is called upon, the Lord will ever (in more or
less measure) make known his judgments for their particular sins, and
show unto them the way to escape the same, and means how to prevent it: to
this end, that when either in any one private person, the matter shall be
discoursed in the court of his own conscience, or when the Lord shall call men
unto a reckoning, all color of excuse may be taken away, and their judgment
(if they repent not) may be made unto them (even by their own confession) more
just: for albeit that the very visible creatures of God, which we daily see
before our eyes, and have (by the blessing of God) from time to time to attend
upon us, and minister unto our several necessities, are sufficient to teach
us, so much of the wisdom and knowledge of God, as to make us excuselesse:
yet when God ^^all go thus far with us, as to speak unto us out of his holy
word, to teach us, not only in general, what he required at our hands, but
in particular also, to convict us of the sins that we stand guilty of
before his majesty, and to show us both the means how to be rid of them,
and to do the things that he commands: when (I say) the Lord shall go thus
far with us, if then we turn not unto him, in forsaking the ways of
wickedness, and submitting our selves to the rule and government of his blessed
word, our excuse being (even in our own judgment) less, our judgment must
needs be the more heavy. Now every one of us must apply this to our own
hearts, and make it a particular doctrine for our several instructions, seeing
that God (in most plentiful manner) has showed unto us this unspeakable
mercy and grace, as to teach us from time to time the ways that we are to
walk in, which if we do not, we make our selves guilty of our judgment above
the^ of Sodom, and bring our selves into a more miserable condition than they
of Gomorrah?

Now, to show you ye cause, of this change of my course, in leaving of our
ordinary porti^ns of scripture, and taking this in hand, it is briefly this:
as all scripture does at all times belong to gods church, good is to be taught
therein: so are there some parts thereof that do more properly belong unto some
times, Our time like unto that in which Joel prophesied.
places, and persons: Now for so much as that time, and this, wherein we
presently do live, being compared together, are found to be (in every respect)
very like the one to the other, I think the doctrine that then fitted them, to
be very necessary for us, upon ye like occasion, for as the hand of God was
upon them in the want of bread, so (though not in the like measure) is it upon
us: as they had little sense, or feeling thereof, to acknowledge it, the
punishment of god upon the^ for their sins, but ascribed it to other causes, so
do we, imputing it, some to the hardness of wise men's hearts, some to the the
every of transporting, and some to the unseasonable times, A comparison betwixt
Israel and us, containing the sum of these sermons.
but few look into themselves, and their sins, that procure the Lord to turn ye
hearts of men, and the benefit of heaven and earth from us: as the Lord having
sent famine, which prevailed not with them, to their conversion, did threaten
to send a more violent and forcible rod, the invasion of strangers upon ye
land: so does he by many warnings and tokens threaten the same unto us, and
(lastly) as the Lord prescribed unto them, if ever they looked to have his
judgments present, removed, or those yt hanged over their heads, turned away,
they must meet the Lord, and prevent his wrath, by fasting and prayer, which
might be as means to bring them to the true humiliation of their souls: so we,
that by the same sins, are punished, and threatened in the same manner, by the
hand and rod of the same ielous God, if ever we look to be reduced soundlye
again into his favor, must take the same course, that he (which did know
the best way) prescribed unto them.

The word of the Lord.) Before that the holy Ghost sets down unto us the
matter of his prophecy, he first of all speaks of the party, that was sent
to do this message, and the Author from whom it was addressed, contained in
the first verse: wherein, he describing the Ambassador that GOD, did send,
does not show his pedigree, from any notable, and famous man in Israel, nor
of what Tribe he was, whether he was of the ordinary ministers of the order of
Leui, or of some other family, raised up extraordinarylie from God, without
the calling of men: the which, (though it be so) brings no doubt either of
the doctrine to be delivered, or of the party by whom it is to be made known.
For as concerning the doctrine, albeit it be every way authentical (that is,
of sufficient authority in it self) yet when we look into the matters for
which this prophet is alleged, in the new Testament we shall see, that with
the Lord it is of sovereign account, being made (as it were) the vmpare of so
great matters: for it is not only alleged by the apostle Acts. 2.16.
Peter in the defense of the disciples accused to be full of new wine, and the
miracle of diverse toongs bestowed upon them: but also in that grave and
weighty disputation of the calling of the Gentiles, the apostle Romans 10.13
Paul does allege it, as a testimony of most evident truth to clear the
matter in hand, and as concerning the party, the lad (no doubt) of special
purpose, passes him over with few words, not so carefully describing his
slocke, as often he does in others of the Prophets, to the end, that the
matter whereof he was to speak, being of so great importance they might regard
and respect it, and not the party by whom it was to be uttered: which thing is
also unto us worthy the consideration, to teach us that we may not hang the
credit or truth of the word of God, The authority of gods word depends not
on man.
on the sleeue of him that utters it, but to receive and embrace it (as it is
indeed) for the word of God whatsoever he be that speaks it: whereby I
do not mean that we are indifferently, and with the like affection to hear
him that sinisterly, or of a sinister purpose preaches the word, and him also
that sincerely, and with a sincere conscience delivers it, but for the thing
it self, to esteem of it as it is, in what vessel soever it be carried, and
yet to desire, and (by all means) to labor that we may receive it in a
vessel fit and worthy (as near as can be) so precious treasure: the which may
be made more evident by a comparison from the body to the soul, and from the
food of the body to the food of the soul: for as meat is still the creature
of God, ordained for the nourishing of man's body whatsoever it be, dressed and
made ready by a neat and cleanly cook, or by him that does handle it
sluttishly and vnhansomly: so is the word of God, being ordained for the
feeding of the soul, still to be esteemed the same in it self, whatsoever he
be that dispenses it unto us, but as there is no man that has care of the
health of his body, that will have his meat dressed (if he can choose) by him
that either for want of skill can not, or of curious vanity will not use it as
he should, least by the rawnesse thereof, or by some evil and unwholesome
mixture, it bring poison in stead of nourishment, even so, no man that has
care in deed of his own soul, will commit it indifferently (without any
choice) to the riffe-raffe, and common sort of Popish priests, but to such a
one, as both for knowledge is able, and willingness will be careful to divide
unto him the word of God aright, and give him his portion in due season.

The word of the Lord that came unto Joel, that is, ye doctrine which is to be
delivered, is that which God determining to make known unto the people of
Israel, did first reveal unto his servant Joel, that he might speak it unto
them, which words being diligently marked, do affoorde unto us diverse
doctrines for our instruction, the first is that, wherein the calling of the
prophet is proved both unto his own conscience, and also to the people: to
his own conscience thus, that when he should enter into the trial of
himself, It is needful for a Minister to be assured of his calling.
and into the consideration of his estate, and seeing his course to be such as
few would like of, yet this might be his comfort, the Lord had set him
aworke: and surely this is a thing most needful to be examined and considered
of, in these our days of the ministers of God, not only in general in
respect of their calling, and the manner of their dealing in it, that is almost
every where gainesaid, but especially in those particular things, for which
they are often called into question, condemned, and (as malefactors) punished
by the worldlings that usurp upon them: for as on the one side, if we shall
take that course which is displesant unto God, and whereby we do also come
into disgrace with men, our estate is most wretched and miserable, so on the
other side, if we do nothing but that which is come unto us by the word of the
Lord, that is enjoined us from God that has placed us in our calling, though
the world think hardly of us for it, and we suffer ignominy, loss, and smarte
because of it, yea, though it bring tediousness unto our own flesh, and
wearisomnesse to our spirits, yet this shall be unto us as an invincible
fortress, as a brazen wall against our adversaries, and as a thousand
witnesses to testify with us, and give us comfort in the midst of all
extremities. Again, the calling of the prophet is approved by the fame (even)
unto men, for, if they should have denied yt which he spoke to be true, or him
to be the prophet of God, he had wherewith to answer and convince them in both
respects: in the first, that that which he said must needs be true, for that
it came from God: on the behalf of the second, that he was the prophet of God,
for that the word came not in general to all, or to many, but particularly to
him, for that he was furnished, and every way enabled, not only in the
understanding of that which he was to deliver, but also in his own conscience
persuaded to be the man, for so much as GOD, sending the message unto him, did
thereby assure him, that he had allotted, and called him to that function. Which
if we mark it well, and gather a general doctrine for our instruction out of
it, does teach us how to know the most real and essential marks of those
whom we are to esteem the messengers of God sent unto us: The marks of a
true minister.
for if it be true that God sends first his word unto him (that is,
furnishes him with knowledge of his will, and care to advance his glory in the
deliverance of it unto his people) then must it needs follow, that they who by
reason of lack of knowledge, diligently employ themselves (in an ordinary and
lawful calling, to break unto the people of GOD the bread of life, and train
them up to the knowledge of the gospel, were never sent of God into that
place, and therefore are not (of his people) to be received and esteemed as
ambassadors from his majesty, but as wolves bursting in, and rauenners sent of
Satan to the keeping from them the kay of knowledge, and so fore-closing unto
them (as much as in them lies) the passage and entry into the kingdom of
heaven, for Gods people (who are to think as the Lord has taught them in his
word) must acknowledge and receive (only them that are found to be qualified
with the gifts of his ministers, the first whereof is every where in the word
of god) said to be the gift of teaching, the knowledge of his mysteries, which
caused the Lord (before he sent the prophet Ezech. 2.8.
Ezech. to preach unto his people, and denounce those judgments that he meant
to inflict upon them) to show to him a book, and command him to eat it, which
signified, ye knowledge and present readiness that he should have in executing
his office: it is always said, ye word of the Lord came to ye prophets: our
savior christ says, that Mat. 13.52.
a Scribe taught unto ye law, must be as one that brings out of his tresury
old and new, and S. Paul describes a B. (by which he means every Minister of
ye gospel) that he Tit. 1.9.
must be apt to teach and convince the gainsaier: but I will not stand on this
point that is so clear (to the^ that have eyes) as the sun at noone-daye.
Every man will confess, that no earthly prince will send an ambassador that
wants either knowledge or utterance to deliver his message, and is not God
far wiser than men?

Again, in that it is said, The word of the Lord came unto Joel, we must note
to what end it was, namely, as follows in his practice, that he might make
it known unto the elders of the land, which is to be noted, for many there be
in the world, who (if they have any more understanding than the common sort
have) do by and by persuade themselves that they are (as they are termed)
learned ministers, albeit they have neither vttera^ce to deliver that which
they know, neither (if they have any gift that way) yet make small conscience
whether they employ themselves in painful preaching or no: the end for which
ye word came to Joel, Learning makes not a Minister.
conde^neth both the sorts of the^. For the first we must note, that ye holy
ghost when he requires of a Minister, to be apt to teach, we must not
think, that he means him that has it within him, and is as a tub without
any vent, for that is but as a candle lighted, and after covered with a
bushel, but he means him that is so prepared and furnished thereunto, that he
is also set on work in the same: and therefore it is, that the prophet Esaias
says Esaias. 50.4.
that God had given unto him a learned tongue, that he might know to minister
the word in time to him that is weary: and the apostls in their prayer
entreated God for ye gift of Acts. 4.29
utterance: and for the second it is clear as the sun, that he who (having all
the gifts that may furnish a Minister unto his calling) laboreth not painefully
with them to teach others, denies the end for which he is placed there, which
is 2. Tim. 4.2.
to preach in season and out of seson, to teach, impro^ue, exhort, and comfort
with all continuance, and long-suffering to lift up his Esaias. 58.1.
voice like a trumpet, to Ezekiel. 33.7.
watch daily, and show the coming of the enemy: to conclude, to deliver Act.
20.27.
all the council of God, so far as he has received, and to Mat. 28.20
teach his people to observe whatsoever Christ has commanded, and therefore
let a man have never so much knowledge, and imploye it not painefully
hereunto, though he brag of his sufficiency never so much, and his people
or worldly friends enroll him never so high in the catalogue of learned
Ministers, the holie-ghost will take him down, and place him in his proper
standing, that is, in the rank of those Esaias. 56.10
dumb dogs, and idol sheepeheards that the Lord by his prophet condemns.
Moreover, in that it is said, that this word of the Lord was unto Joel, before
it came to the people, we learn another lesson for our instruction, which is,
that as the Lord meant, that this word should be common unto all Israel,
yet sent it first to his prophet, that by his ministry they might be taught
it, so does he ever (in that ordinary way which he in his word has
commended and commanded unto us) deal with his people, that is, bring them to
the knowledge of his word by the ministry of men, to the end, The preaching
of the word is the means whereby God will be known.
that we may learn (if we be willing to let God be our teacher) to submit
our selves unto that his ordinance, and by such means as he has and does out
of the same daily affoorde unto us, to beg and expect the blessing of
knowledge, and the graces that accompany the same from his hands: which
doctrine is very needful to be learned, for we see that men wax so wise in
their own conceit, that for the knowledge of the way to heaven, they think (as
their practice declares) to find out a better way, and make it a shorter cut
than GOD has appointed: for whereas God has ordained the preaching ministry
of his word to be daily sounding in his church, to bring men unto knowledge,
and by knowledge unto faith, and so to salvation, it is come now to pass, that
(the most men think that way not so needful, but as an indifferent thing to
be attended upon, or to be refused at their pleasure, and therefore do betake
themselves, either to such a sheepeheard, as shall keep them in ignorance (for
that he cannot open unto them the Scriptures) all the days of their lives, and
think their estate better then theirs that be daily instructed, or else they
persuade them selves, that they can come to knowledge sufficient by their own
private reading, and so contemn, or account it too base a matter to be a
scholar to preching, but if they had learned that the governor of Queen
Candares, was as wise as they, and yet confessed that he could Acts. 8.31.
not understand that which he read, without a guide, if they could be
persuaded, that God is wiser then they, and yet he has ordained yt 1. Cor. 1.21
foolishnes of preching, (as wordlinges account it) to save them that believe:
they were come so far as to think, that the blessing of God is tied unto his
own ordinance, and his curse upon them, and all their doings, that swerve
from the rule of his commandments, they would be a great deal more careful,
to let him be their counselor, and his word their instructour in this
point, but the 2. Cor. 4.4.
GOD of this world has so blinded their eyes, that they believe not the word
of the Lord to be true, and therefore no marvel, if they yield no obedience
thereunto: but let us that have learned otherwise, take heed that their example
draw us not away, but that we with fear and reverence, submit our selves unto
the ordinances of gods word, knowing that by it we shall be John. 12.48
judged at the day of reckoning: Lastly, in that it is said, that the word of
the Lord came unto him saying, Hear, etc.) We may observe what it was that
he delivered unto them, to wit, Gods ministers may speak no more nor less
then gods word.
that which he had received, the word of the Lord, whereby is set down unto
us the duty of every faithful Minister of God, which is to keep himself
unto the contents of his commission with all faithfulness, neither declineth
to the right hand, nor the left, neither dyminishing any thing therefrom, nor
adding any thing thereunto, but teaching all that which God has put into his
mouth, and no more, which is diligently to be observed, and carefully to be
looked unto, because there is (often) great fault committed herein on both
sides, for some are very willing to deliver, or have delivered unto the
people, some of the word of GOD, but if there be any thing, that may
offend, or bring any danger unto the parties, they think that in any case,
that should not be meddled wythall, affirming, that other things are more
necessary, and that they belong not so much (as they persuade them selves)
unto the auditorie which in some things may after a sort be true, for albeit
the knowledge of the word of GOD, and every part thereof, belongs unto
every member of his Church, in respect of the doctrine therein contained, yet
there is some place and time, wherein the Minister of GOD, is not bound to
speak some things contained directly in his commission: as for example, to
make choice of a text to preach upon unto a country people, that teaches the
duty of kings, and out of the same to deliver only that doctrine, is not
convenient: how then is it, and after what sort must we deliver all that we
know? Surely thus: we proceeding in an ordinary course, and coming by order
of the text unto places of Scriptures, that contain the duties of those that
hear us not, yet are we bound to deliver herein, all the council of God: but
you will say unto me, those matters (not belonging unto your people) you are to
pass over and to teach that which is more necessary. I answer: that so
should I betraye that word that God has put into my hand. For albeit the
practice of a Kings office belongs not unto the ploughman, yet the doctrine
is needful for him to know. For seeing the Lord will be praised for the
blessing that we reap by good and virtuous rulers, and prayed unto for the
amendment of them that be evil, how shall this be performed of him that
has not been taught it out of the word. For God accepts no praises,
neither hears any prayers, which are offered unto him without faith and
nothing is done in faith, but that which is grounded upon knowledge: the like
is to be said of the corruptions, and wants that are from time to time
descried to be in the Church, for the attaining of the amendment whereof, the
prayer of the faithful, is very forcible in the presence of GOD: and so of
all other things, what soever concerns the good or hurt of the whole Church
of God, or any member of the same: (though it be not for every one to
practice) is to be taught by the Minister of GOD, unto the Church, and learned
of every hearer, that he may give GOD his due praise for the one, and entreat
his favor for the other.

But the Minister of God, which labors to do that which shall be found
unblameable, will both deliver without fear, (as God offers convenient
opportunity) Acts. 20.27
all the counsel of God, and also, (knowing the fountain of knowledge and
wisdom, to be infinitely deep in the word of God, and past drying up,
and him self neither to have received any thing else in commission nor to have
any promise of blessing upon any other course) will keep him self from time
to time, within the bounds of the same, for every thing that he shall deliver
unto the people of God.

Hear ye this) the calling of the prophet being confirmed, and the manner how
he was furnished, being laid down unto us, it remains that we come to the
words that he uttered unto them, wherein (before we come to the matter) he
exh^^teth them to attendaunce, and diligently to listen to that which he was to
speak unto them: as if he should have said, seeing that I am sent from God, and
furnished with the knowledge o^ his word, to the end that by my means you may
be instructed from him in that which he would have you to know and put in
practice, it behooves therefore that every one o^ you, from the highest to the
lowest, not only the rulers and ancients of this land, but also all that
dwell therein, do carefully and with all reverence harken unto and receive,
that which I am to deliver unto you: this being the sum of his entrance, it
remains that we consider more at large, the particular duties that are to
be learned out of the same. First, let us note: Because God speaks man must
hear.
how and upon what cause, this exhortation is uttered, (for no man will be
persuaded to harken unto a thing, but being induced thereunto by some reason
rather) and if you mark well, you shall see that it is inferred upon the words
of the former verse, as if he should say unto them on this wise, the Lord
has ordained me his messenger, and given me a message, to deliver vno you, and
therefore it is meet, that with all carfulness, you hearken unto the same,
and (if it be ryghtlie considered) it is a most forcible reason, for seeing
that the LORD is he by whom Act. 17.28.
we have our being, to whose glory Prou 16.4.
we are created, and from whom we Iam. 1.17.
receive every good thing, there is great reason that when he speaks, we
should lay our hands upon our mouths, and with all reverence receue that
which he will utter: but how soever, men in general terms, will acknowledge that
it should be so, yet indeed, when we come to the trial of ye general, by his
particulars, we shall find ye very few do believe yt it should be so: or if the
tree be knoen by his fruit, Math. 7.16.
then this persuasion is seen to rest in the hearts of a very few. For albeit
many are found, that with their outward appearance, seem to be thus affected,
yet, few are found, that learn this word with any love, or reform their lives
after ye rule of the same with any care or endeavor. Now can we think, that
they believe it to be gods word, or the messenger thereof to be sent from
God, which despise the particulars, that be taught unto them out of the same,
and care not a jot for any obedience thereunto; no, it is impossible for if
ever it entered into their minds, that it were a message from God in deed, then
would they also be persuaded, that the contempt and disobedience thereunto, were
great and heinous offenses against his glorious majesty, which he would never
leave unrevenged, and so (if not for love of virtue, yet for very fear of
punishment) they would not go on in such monstrous disobedience as they do.
And therefore let every one of us make trial of our selves by this, They that
obey not the word do not believe it to be of God.
how surely we are persuaded in our hearts yt it is the word of God, which is
even in so much measure, as we carefully yield obedience thereunto, and no
more. Again, we se how the prophet names first of all the elders, whereby he
meneth those, that were assistant unto the priests in ye government of the
church, who are so called, for yt they were (commonly) before they were
acou^ted fit for that place, men of ancient years, and of great gravity among

their authority, and persons of great regard among the people (and therefore
easily drawing after the^ the greater number) yelding obedience, Great men
should be forwardest in all godliness.
might be forcible means to bring on others, or refusing to harke^, might
lead many with the^ to disobedience: the holy ghost thought it meet, that his
prophet should be al first with them: whereby we have to learn this lesson for
our instruction, that it behooves the^ whom God has placed in authority,
either in ye church, or commonweal, to be very careful and take especial
heed that they (yielding obedience to the voice of GOD by his prophet, in this
place) do carefully harken unto the word of God, and in their lives (as they
be placed above others) give no example for them to follow, but that which is
good and holy, and (if they would well consider of it) they should see that
there is great cause that they should do so, for as the great Cedars in
Libanon, while they stayed, are a defense unto many shrubbes and bushes under
them, but if they fall, they crush all that be within their reach, even so,
they that are of higher estate and calling, while they continue in the fear of
God, and the ways of holiness, are as props and stays unto many that look upon
them, and great means to draw others on by their authority and example, but
when they fall and give them selves unto the ways of sin and wickedness, they
go not that way alone, but are an occasion of falling unto many others
besides of their inferiors, and followers, now albeit it be true that
(because one man sins willingly) the Eze. 18.4.
soul that sins shall die, yet shall their blood be required at the
hands of all them, that have not done their duty to bring them to GOD, but
being means to drive them from him, if we could be persuaded of the truth
of this, O what care it would work in the hearts of every one in his
calling, it would make the princes of this world, A meditation for all
superiors.
and all the rulers put in authority to reason thus with themselves, is it
true that I have a share in ye actions of every one that is under my
jurisdiction, either in his goodness (if by my authority and good example he
be brought thereunto) or in his wickedness, if I govern him not aright, or give
him in my life any other example than that which is good and lawful: then
surely have I great need to look narrowly unto my own ways, and study
carefully how I may be unto all that cast their eyes upon me, a president
and pattern of all virtue and godliness, then would the Minister that has
charge of men's souls reason thus with himself: so would the master of
family, the father of children, and in a word, all of any superior estate
would make this use of it. The cause that makes all superiors evil.
But alas, it is clean contrary, for almost every man looks upon the
pleasure, ease, and gain, that may be had in his calling, and follows after
that to the uttermost, not respecting what offense he give either unto God or
man, but few are found in any estate whatsoever, that duly enter into the
meditation aforesaid: and yet howsoever this is followed after, and the other
not regarded, sure it is, that the former is that which GOD looks for at our
hands, and (which he teaches us in this place) and the latter is that which
shall most severely be punished. Moreover, the Prophet having spoken unto the
elders, thereby assuring them, that the matter concerns them in private,
least either they or the rest of the people should think, that it should
stretch no further, he also calls upon all the inhabitants of the land, of
what condition soever they be, to the end, that the judgments that were to be
denounced, lessons that were to be taught, and persuasions (for their own
good) to be enforced, might be known aforehand to appertain unto them all.
Which teaches unto us thus much for our instruction, that the word of GOD
(for so much as it proceeds from that GOD who requires obedience of all,
ministers instruction needful for all, and offers those benefits that
every man persuadeth him self to have portion in) is not to be restrained
unto any one kind of people, and thought not to belong unto some others, but
is to be heard, learned, believed, and practiced of all: for if that be true,
that Hebr. 11.6.
without faith it is not possible to please God, and that also, that Romans 10.14
none can believe without hearing of the word preached (for that by the same is
knowledge, the groundwork of faith begotten in the heart of man) and that he
that believes not John. 5.12. All that will be saved must hear Gods word.
has not the Son, that is, no part of redemption purchased by Jesus Christ
the Son of God, it must needs follow, that if ever we look to please God in
this life, or to inherit the kingdom of heaven after this life, we must most
carefully (of what estate soever we be) endeavor our selves to use those
means (which GOD has ordained thereunto) that may daily increase and
confirm knowledge in our hearts. If we were persuaded of this, it would make
the word of GOD to be of more price with us than it is, and provoke us more
carefullye to seek after it than we do: then should not the neglect and
contempt of so precious and inestimable a Treasure, so generallye ouerspread
the face of this land, as it does. But let us, whom it pleases GOD to
teach these things, labor, to make right use of them. For our continual
instruction and comfort we have yet to observe an other thing in the manner of
the Prophets speech, which is, that whereas he might have spoken indefinitely
unto the inhabitants of the land, which indeed comprehends the elders also,
he speaks distinctly unto the elders, and then unto the inhabitants, as if
he should say, hearken, both you to whom God has given greatest measure of his
graces, and so are advanced unto the place of government, and also you who have
obtained less, and therefore live in meaner condition: that is, let neither
the knowledge or authority of the elders, keep them from the hearing this
word of God, nor mean estate or calling drive away the inferior, but let
every one of every condition hearken: in the manner of which speech, the
prophet seems, as it were of set purpose, to take away the excuse, that they
might allege to keep them away, The reasons that the greter sort allege to
keep themselves from hearing Gods word.
first from the elders, and then from the people, from the elders thus. It
might be (if he had spoken indefinitly) that the elders might have refused to
hear, saying thus: God will have his word heard, but of whom, even them that
are ignorant and need instruction, but as for us we are learned, and know as
much of the word as the preacher can tell us: or, we have business about our
offices and calling, that we cannot attend to hear him, we will do it when
other things are dispatched: no doubt, if the elders were of that mind, whereof
the greatest part of superiors be among us, they would quickly allege such
things for themselves that they might be exempted from hearing: How the
ungodly that have any learning esteem of preaching.
for it is a common thing now adays, that if a man have in his own opinion,
any smattering in learning, that he be able in any sort to speak of the
principles of the humane arts, he is by and by puffed up with such a pride in
himself by the ouerweening of his own gifts, that he disdaineth to submit
himself to the ordinance of GOD for any instruction, not only refusing to
be instructed by the same, but persuadyng himself (the spirit of pride
possessing his heart) that he can learn as much, yea far more by his own
private study, in so much that he accounts himself abused if he should
be thought so mean, as that he could learn any thing at sermons, and
therefore does he usually absent himself: or if it happen that he come now and
then dropping in, is it, think you, with reverent preparation of his heart to
receive, and humble submission of his affections to be informed by the Lords
message? Nothing less: but that he may sit there as a judge, to censure
whatsoever shall be spoken, to approve or disprove whatsoever his humor
leads him unto, and so in deed to set him self against the Lords
ordinance, to disgrace it, never giving any more reverence unto the word of
God there delivered, than the man that speaks, carries opinion of learning in
his foolish conceit: and this is (in very deed) no less than to judge even the
Lord, as many do use it, and to set him to school: but when the wisdom of
such men shall be found more perfect than the Lords, then shall they have
part in the benefit brought unto us by that word which they make so small
account of: on the other side, if we be called unto office, be it never so
mean and easily performed, it is as common with the most to make that a
sufficient excuse to keep them from the hearing of the word of GOD, Why so few
magistrates be religious.
and if they can allege, that they have such and such affairs of the
commonwealth, to be employed about (albeit it be oftentimes nothing so) they
do think themselves excused sufficientlye, both before GOD and man, in so
much, that it is a rare thing of all other men, to see magistrates be ordinary
hearers of the word: but if they had either any care to discharge their
duties with a good conscience, or any religion in their hearts at all (which
makes men to think reverently of the word) they would say with
themselves, how can we think, that any thing we take in hand shall
prosper, seeing we have no more care to hear the voice of GOD: if good
success depend upon GODS blessing unto that course which he has commanded,
then must we first Matt. 6.33^
seek the kingdom of GOD, and his righteousness: but whilst these things are
not thought upon, and so the word of GOD (even at their doors) neglected,
and not hearkened unto, it comes to pass, by the just judgment of GOD, upon
that preposterous dealing, that little, or no good at all is done, by the
authority and government of the most: but contrariwise, they being great, and
despising of instruction, become (often) the most notorious enemies unto
religion in the places where they dwell: not without special reason therefore,
does the Prophet speak to the elders by name, least they should find some
hole to creep out at, and think them selves exempted. Again, he seems to
take away excuse from the people, What the ignorant do allege to keep them
from hearing Gods word.
in that he names them apart, after he had called upon the elders, for (if
they were of the mind of the common sort in our time) they would quickly
have said for themselves, we are unlearned, the word of God is a mystery
that exceeds our capacity, and we are mean men that have enough to do in
our calling, we can spare no time thereunto, we are not bookish, and therefore
he does not mean us, but our rulers, and them that be learned, that are
able to understand him. The Prophet therefore in the manner of his speaking does
prevent such objections, and teaches us, that even the simplest and
vnlearnedst is to be taught out of the word of God, and not to refuse it
because he lacks lerning, but rather to be more desirous of it: for it is the
only treasury of all true and heavenly learning, and it is so tempered by the
holie-ghost, who indicted it, that (unless he be a fool that has it in
handling) it speaks to the understanding of the most ignorant and simplest of
al other, I mean of them that be the children of: God, and are sealed by his
spirit, for else it is too profound, and passes the capacity of the
learned clearks in the world, which are (in Gods just judgment) cast off:
which caused our savior Christ Mat. 11.25.
to praise his father, who had kept the secrets of the gospel from the wise
and prudent, and revealed them unto habes, and therefore ^nles thou think thy
self too mean to desire to be saved, never make thy self too simple to
keep thy self from the knowledge of the word of God.

Whether such a thing) the Prophet having showed unto whom this his commission
is to be made known, 4.
he now enters into an admiration of the matter, before he speak it: and
all to the end that the people might be affected with ye greater expectation
of some strange and unaccustomed matter: for the matter being extraordinary,
it behooves them that will rightly profit by it to be moved with
extraordinary affections. Now albeit the works of God, even in the course of
the same, and moving of the planets: yea, to the order of nature in every
thing, be in themselves strange and wonderful, yet for so much as we are
daily used unto them, and costome has made them familiar unto vs^ the view of
them do not make so deep impression in our hearts, (...) that which comes
seldom, though it be of his own nature not of the like importance does
strike us with greater consideration: therefore is it that the Prophet says,
that the matter is so (...), that neither they nor their fathers have heard of
ye like: so that by this manner of speech he sets before our eyes, first
himself for an example of a faithful Minister of GOD, A faithful Minister
must labor to affect the hearts of his people with that which he techeth.
who is to labor by all means, to affect the hearts of the people with the
fence and feling of the doctrine that they teach, and not to pass it over (as
the greatest number do) with a (...), regarding rather how to show
themselves learned, than to bring the people to feeling, by their patheticall
and powerful persuasions. Again, in that they had felt the thing (especially
the first punishment of Famine) and yet had not laid it to heart, nor been
affected there wythall: but in a certain sleepie security had passed it over;
not using it as a means to draw them unto any further consideration of their
sins, and the horror of them before the Majesty of God, that they might
learn them, his manner of speech does the more reprove them, and convince
them of the greater hardness of heart, and setlednesse in sin, as if he
should have said: You have passed over the matter slightly, and had no more
care to amend than before, and yet the thing that GOD has wrought among you,
is strange and wonderful: which (doubtless) is done to this end, that you
might be made the more willing to be reduced out of your sins. The Prophet
Amos handling the like argument, speaks in the same manner, but in more expres
terms, saying: Amos. 4.6.
I have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and scarceness of
bread in all your places, and yet have ye not returned unto me, says the
Lord: as if he should have said, I have not only bestowed upon you my
word, whereby you may learn to leave your sins, but also have pinched you
with penury, to bring you home the more effectually, and yet all will not
serve, so that this does first show unto us, that they are far gone in
obstinacy, whom none of these things do move: God afflicts man, to draw
him to repentance.
secondly, it shows to what end the Lord does from time to time exercise us
with sundry temporal calamities and troubles, which is, that we might be the
more effectually drawn unto him, which is diligently to be noted, and by the
same our own hearts to be examined how they stand affected in this behalf,
whereby we shall have just matter ministered unto us, either of comfort, or of
fear: for it is evident, that not only the Lord does now and then send
upon whole nations some punishment or other, but more, that every one of us of
what estate soever, if he look narrowly into his own estate, shall find the
Lords rod upon him, and himself greatly to be crossed one way or other.
Now every man either uses his cross, as a means to humble him further, and
make him return the more effectually unto GOD, or he passes it over as a
matter of course, persuading himself, that there is no further matter in it:
So then, here is the trial of thy self, GOD punishes, that we might amend,
and we do not, then surely, we are such as profit not in his school: on
the other side, GOD lays his cross upon me, I feel it, I acknowledge it
his rod for mine offenses, and I am brought to a more carfulness, and
heede-taking unto my ways, then may I conceive comfort unto mine own heart, in
that I profit by the Lords correction.

The second sermon. Verse. 3. Tell you your children of it, and let your
children show it to their children, and their children to another generation.
Tell it unto your children) Having showed how strange a thing it is that he is
to speak, 5
least they should think, that it were but for the time present, or for
themselves alone, he shows in these words, We may not consider of Gods word
or works for the time only.
that they must so learn and mark it, that they may from time to time recount
it, and teach it their children, with charge to have it propagated unto the
generations that should come after: whereby we learn first, that we are not
to hear or make use of the words of God for the time present, or consider of
his works in mercy or judgment while they are fresh and new, and no longer,
but to use his word as we do the food of our bodies, that is, to eat it, that
we may digest it, be norished by it, and made more able in the strength of it
to walk in the course of this life.

We must learn gods word for our selves, and our children also
Again, we see, that it is enjoined them, not only, to know and consider
those things themselves, but also to make them known, and teach the right use
of them to their children, which being spoken to them in one particular, is
also enjoined unto us in regard of ye whole word of God in general, that is,
that we have a care to instruct and bring up our children in the knowledge and
fear of God, that the honor of God may be retained among men, and to their
posterity, as also, that we may leave behind us a godly seed: the which,
albeit it was enjoined unto them under the Deuteronomy. 6.7.
law, and confirmed unto us in the time of the Ephesians. 6.4.
gospel, that it might appear to be a duty for ever required of the people of
God, yet we see how little it is (almost every where) regarded: in so much, that
for lack of godly education (the parents letting them run at randon) the youth
of this land does seem already to have received unto themselves the profession
of Atheism and al impiety* which (if parents thought it their duty to
instruct them otherwise) should among us be redressed. But let all that fear
GOD, and make a conscience to obey his will, look unto their duties in this
behalf, and take heed, that they pass not over with carelessness, the
education of their children, as is the manner of the wicked among whom they do
dwell. Besides this, we see that the Prophet wills this to be made known to
the generations following, and so from one to an other, and yet it is a
particular action, the force whereof they only felt, Gods works once showed
have a perpetual rest.
which teaches unto us, that the works of God that he brings to pass in
extraordinary manner upon the face of the earth, are (in regard of the use and
end of them) to be considered and regarded in all generations. For if they be
the works of his wrath in the punishementes of his foes, or sharp and bitter
afflictions upon his people falling from obedience to his truth, or yet of his
mercy showed unto penitent sinners, or revenge for the injuries done unto his
saints (the Lord being always the same) they are to be looked for upon the
like occasions, and especially those that it has pleased the holie-ghost to
register in the holy Scriptures, which are therefore set down, that we might
learn by them the punishments that we sin not as they did that felt them,
least we feel them also, and the mercies that we may take the same course
which they did (that in the love of God) we may find the like favor, and so
make the word of GOD both in the precepts, and also examples thereof a
continual direction for the course of our whole life.

6
That which is left of the palmer-worme, etc.) This is the thing that he has
made so much preparation for, the sum whereof is thus much, that the hand of
God was so upon them with punishment by famine and dearth, that not their
superfluity, or a part of their necessary food was kept from them, but the
LORD had sent his several punishementes upon them, one after an other, that
among them they had devoured all, and left nothing. Now if we look into this
that the Prophet speaks according to the action don, there was none of the
people that needed to be so prepared, that they might understand it, for it was
apparent even before their eyes, so that the prophet seems after so great
speeches before hand, at the end to say (in effect) nothing, for if a man
should come among us, and call men in the marketplace to draw near, and
calling for attention, to a solemn proclamation, should in the end tell the
people that corn is dear, and so depart, a number would condemn him of
folly, and yet he should say as much (in effect) as the words of this
prophet do express: but we must understand and that it is not simply the
thing, that the prophet names them to consider of, and no more, but it is
their sencelessenesse, and security, in that they being thus smitten of the
Lord, were not yet moved with repentance, nor cared any whit to seek
reconciliation with his majesty: so that, the meaning of the holy ghoost
being evident, it remains that we observe those things out of the words
that are to be noted for our instruction, first, these so diverse and present
punishments one after another, to execute that part of the Lords
determination, which ye former had left undone, does commend to us ye power
that God is of to punish ye sinners and transgressors of his law, to ye end
that we may learn to take heed, and beware that we cast not behind our backs
(as many me^ do) ye consideration of Gods high hand against iniquity, God is
both able, and very willing to punish the transgressors of his law.
but rather (considering his power to plague his foes) to have all watchfulnes
over our own affections, and regard to his commandments to do the^, least we
procure against our selves ye force of that his power, which (taking hold on
us) must needs throw us into a most forlorn and wretched co^ditio^. Besides
this, we may behold ye readiness of the lords will to put this his power in
execution, which also is to be observed: for every one of us, is easly drawn to
acknowledge gods power and ability, to do what he will, but we think so little
of his justice, and presume so much upon his mercy, that we persuade our selves
he will not execute his vengeance upon us, albeit, we have done and do daily
provoke him thereto by our manifold rebellio^s against him, but if we could
believe that this people had as great cause (indeed) to stand upon his mercy
(for that they had as much experience as any since ever had, or could have) as
we can any way pretend for our selves, and yet when they walked a course, not
agreeable to the calling whereunto he had called the^, were severely punished, it
would make us more careful to do well, yt we feel not ye smart of his powerful
vengeance, and not go on in the course of our own ways, persuading our selves
yt no evil shall happen to us, because the lord is gracious and merciful.
Again, we are to consider of the instruments that God uses to show forth his
displeasure upon the^ in this place, and they be, not the great and puissant
princes that then lived, (though they be also at gods commandment) nor the
power of darkness yt rules in the air, nor the angels that attend continually
upon him to do his will, for all those we acou^t to be great and mighty in our
own eyes, but it is the seely and pore vermin, yt be of al other gods creatures
in their own nature the weakest, and in our eyes most contemptible, which
notwithstanding) when they be set on work are armed with such force and
might, The least of gods creatures, can confound the greatest men when God will.
as ye holy ghost terms the^ and such like, ye lords mighty host, whereby god
has many times ouerthrown great and mighty monarks, as Pharao, Herod, and
others, to teach us on ye one side, how all the creatures of God, that have
their being in and upon earth round about us, are Gods prepared soldiers to
work our utter ruin, when we transgress his holy commandments, and on
the other side, what little cause man has (if he weigh his estate aright) to
be proud in his own conceit, or persuade him self of any valor whereof he
may boast to be in him self, (especially when he walks in the ways of
wickedness) seeing he is environed with so many and diverse of Gods creatures,
the least, and meanest whereof, is of power sufficient, (if God speak but the
word) to deface all that whereof he boasts, and to dissapoint him of that
felicity, that he vainly persuades him self long to enjoy: we may further
observe out of these words, that God punished not this people with one
affliction, and so leave them untouched any more, but sends upon the^ one of
these creatures after another, because that the first had not effected that in
their hearts for which the Lord sent it: for GOD scourged them to the end that
they might be reclaimed from their wicked ways, unto true repentance, and
amendment of life. Now when he seeeth that, the destruction which the
Palmer-worme made in their fruits, did not draw them thereunto, he sends the
grassehopper to spoil that which the other had left, and so after a third and
a fourth kind of consuming vermin. Whereby we may learn this lesson for our
instruction, God will never leave punishing till we be either converted or
vtter-confounded
that whenever. God sends upon a people, any punishment to call them to
repentance, and it work not the same effect, God will still send punishment
upon punishment, and always the latter to be sharper then the former, until
that people be either brought to renounce that course which God punishes them
for, and to walk in his ways, or else until it appear, (as it did in
Pharaoh, and his people, by their several plagues, whereby they profited
nothing) that it is a stiff-necked generation, apparantlie refusing his grace,
and so to be cast off in his eternal displesure. Mark well this application.
Which doctrine (if we can rightly apply it unto our selves) is very
necessary for our present instruction, to make us see in what case we be at
this instant. We all know, that God has begun to deal with us in this point,
as he did with the Israelites in this place: that is, to abridge us of that
plenty of bread, that heretofore (by his great mercy) we have long enjoyed:
and yet by the show that appears upon the earth, in the forwardnes of the
corn, he seems to have made, or (at ye least) to promise, an end of ye
former scarsitie, whereby we also promise to our selves abundance, and in the
meane-while, never alter our ways from any former course, wherein they have
been framed, nor amend any thing that is amiss, either in the whole church and
commonwealth, or any particular member of the same: wherein it may be, that
we shall not be dissappointed of our hope, (for God may do what pleases him
best) but this I dare say, (and as sure as the Lord lives, and his word is
true, it shall come to pass) that for so much as this small sign of gods anger,
has wroght no amendment in us, (which is the end why God afflicts his people)
either he sees, that we are a nation who have so long dallied with his word
that he means to remove it to a nation that will bring forth more fruit, and
so (leaving of to smite us any more) will let us run on to our own
destruction: or (if we be that people with whom he means to continue his
word, and whom he will soundly convert unto him self, he will not let us
alone with this light easy blow that he laid upon us, but he will either in
the same kind, by remoouing all the fruits of the earth from us) touch us
more nearely, then yet he has, or by some other more sharp and bitter
purgation, cleanse away the dross that cleaves so fast unto us, that he may
make us pure gold, fit to be made vessels of his honor, and therefore, let us
not thus ^ooth up our selves in persuasion of peace and plenty, for if they be
restored unto us without our sound conversion unto God, and that in a more
effectual manner, then yet England has seen, our state shall be of all men's most
miserable.

Awake ye drunkards) The prophet in these words, 7
laboreth to draw the people unto the due consideration of their estate, and to
make ye right use of that punishment which was upon them, wherein albeit he
speaks unto ye drunkards perticularly, yet we must not think that he
means them alone, for the want, laying hold generally upon all the end
thereof, must also be urged unto al, but he names one kind of people,
instead of al, and them above any other, both for that the abuse of their
former plenty was most apparent (even in the sight of the blyndest) in them,
for who is so senseless, that will not confess, that the drunkard mispendeth
the creatures of god, as also, because of all the sorts of people, that were
most settled in their sins, and brought unto the greatest depth of security,
the drunkarde is the greatest, for as it is the nature of the excess of
drink, whylest it is in man's head, by his fuming power and efficacy, to make
that man reasonlesse like a brute beast, and senseless, as a block,
Drunkards are hardest (of all other) drawn to repentance.
unfit unto the common and natural duties of a man: so it is the natural
effect of drunkenness, to deprive him (even when he is sober) of all
understanding* and capacity of instruction, in so much, that of all wanderers
from the Lord, they go the furthest, and of all impenitent sinners, they are in
the most desperate condition, and the hardliest converted* to the end
therefore that the Lord might by his Prophet declare, that he looked for such
a general amendment of the land, as might reform every estate, he speaks
by name unto the drunkardes, which of al other were the furthest off from any
such repentance. He makes also choice of this kind of sin, rather tha^ any
other, to the end that he might show unto the people what estate they were
generally in, even so settled in sin, and drowned in the depth thereof, and
contented to abide therein as the drunkard is in his drunkenness, that they might
be brought the more thorowlie to see their own wretched condition, the more
vnfaignedlie conceive detestation of the fame^, and the more endeavor their
speedy amendment, which does also teach us, how necessary a matter it is for
us to have our sinful condition laid open unto us by the ministry of Gods
holy word, not only in a general manner to be told that we be
sinners, for that passes away as water from the top of a stone, and pearceth
not our hearts, but even in particular, how severally and diverse ways we
are faulty, how ouglie and loathsome our estate is before the majesty of God,
and in what fearful plight we be, when our hearts are not wrought unto
unfeigned remorce for the same. Again, in that the Lord by his general
punishment, does labor to draw the very drunkard unto sense and feeling, we
learn that when God begins to inflict his punishments upon a people, Gods
judgments shall move the most senseless.
he will make them of such force, that they shall be felt of the most
senseless, even of them that have labored most to put out of their hearts,
the remembrance of all punishment for sin* which is worthy to be noted, for if
we look into the affections of men, we shall plainly see, Amos. 6, 3.
yt he who puts furthest from himself the evil day, and least believes
any part of the word of God, persuadeth himself to be in best case: for yt he
takes his pleasure in yt things of this life according to his hearts desire:
but if he knew in what state he stands, and how suddenly god will tech him by
his own foolish experience, ye vanity of his own persuasion, it would make him
look better about him, and examine his own ways, not by the crooked measure
of his own deceitful heart, but by the undeceivable line of gods holy word, and
esteem of them according as (in deed) they are, and not as they have seemed
unto his own reason to be. If we look further into these words in searchinge
of the causes why, this one kind of sin is named rather then any other, we
shall see, yt by this example, whose offenses were palpable, ye holy ghost would
show them, the principal cause of this scarcity that now they suffered, to be
their lauishing, and excessive mispending of Gods blessings wherewith he had
enriched them, and therefore do the Esaias. 5.11. and 56.12.
prophets often (no doubt, not meaning them only, but al other mispenders of
gods blessings) inuey sharply and threaten most grievous punishments against
drunkards, The mispending of gods blessings the cause of scarcity.
to the end that all those that had in any other kind, mis-bestowed the
things of this life, might be brought to amendment of their wais: which is
worthy ye consideration for us to be admonished by, to see (as it were
aforehand) what GOD threatens and may by the same justice bring upon us: for
if the abusing of the fat of the land of Canaan, by ye Israelites, gods own
people, provoked the lord in his justice, not only to remove from them the
superfluity and superaboundance, that they wallowed in, but even those
necessaries, which nature for the sustentation thereof did need: O Lord, what
may we look for, from the seat of gods justice to befall us, if he should deal
with us as he did with the^? surely nothing but utter ruin and desolation from
being a people any more in ye sight of ye sun: for if we shall match our state
with theirs in particular, We exceed in abusing Gods blessings every way more
then the Jews did*
and lay open (even) the worst that is in all the word of GOD to be found of
them, and then look into our selves with that blind sight that our weknes can
offend us, we shall find that in nothing we are behind them, but in many, do
we far go beyond them, for, is not drunkenness which we have heard to be
so apparent a misusing of Gods blessings, so it is, yea, and much exceeding
with us, then ever can be proved to be in Israel? With us it is not only a
common thing to sin, (as it were for the prize) who can be strongest to
devour strong drink, and exceed his companion in heaping up the measure of
his beastlines above his fellows: but also (which former times, were never
acquainted with) to bestow not small cost upon others, to the end to make them
also of our own wretched condition, to the end that we may sport and laugh at
them, and be not the blessings of God another way, (I mean in eating and
drinking) as far misbestowed? what superfluity in banqueting? what excess
in ordinary diet? what variety of dishes more then need be euery-where used?
whereby it comes to pass, that of all people, we Englishmen are termed (and
that worthyly) the greatest eaters that are, and as for aparell, another of the
blessings of God, ordained (only) for to cover our shame, in a civil
decency, is not our exceeding vanity, most monstrously to be seen therein? not
only, in the excess and cost lines thereof, but in the several forms and
fashions also, wherein, we are so apish in imitating all nations, that we
show our selves the most inconstant people of all other: yea and for the
feeding of our monstrous humor of vanity, even in the highest degree, how
many thousands of quarters of the purest wheat, which God ordained for the
food of man, are yearlie converted into that most deuelish device of Startch,
it cannot be unknown unto many, for so much as it was evidently laid open
(not long ago) in the Parliament, and yet (alas) no remedy provided to
redress it. A sin so abominable, that (if there were no other) it does
cry so loudly in the Lords ears for vengeance, as his justice must needs
proceed against us for it, without speedy repentance: so that (all these laid
together) the Lords riches wherewith he has infinitely beautified this land,
being euery-way so heinoussie abused, there remains nothing for us to look
for, (except GOD work in our hearts speedy repentance) but final hauock, and
utter desolation. The prophet in this place persuades ye drunkards to weep,
which is a behauior, that of all other people, they are furthest from, and
which they labor (as it were of purpose) to put from themselves, God
dissapointeth the sinner of his purpose.
and rather to enforce their senses unto an extraordinary riot and mirth, which
they propound unto themselves as their final felicity: and yet the prophet
persuadeth them unto weeping, which is the thing that they least of all dreamed
ever to be brought unto: but such is the manner of the Lords dealing, with them
that seek to build themselves in sin, and to be persuaded of an assurance,
thereby even utterly to dissapoint them of their purpose, to the end that we
may learn to behold the exceeding vanity that man is blinded with, when he
promises unto him self any good condition, with the disobedience unto gods
commandments, or leaving of any part of his duty undone: which is a thing
worthy to be learned of us, and so much the rather, for that so few do observe
the ishue of it, and therefore believe it not, for do we not see that (almost)
every man in every calling, does of purpose keep back, and (as it were) abridge
the Lord of that obedience yt his calling owes unto him? and al upon these
grounds: if I do these, and these things, I shall expose my self unto many
dangers, and inconveniences, and if I leave them undone, and in steed thereof, do
such and such a thing, (which indeed be ungodly and sinful) I shall find great
ease and benefit in it: if we could be persuaded (which is most true) that the
only true safety is to yield obedience unto the word of God in every point:
and (on the other side) save the ^^auing of any part of our duties undone, or
ye committing of any sin, to carry never such a show, and make us never so
fair promises we shall be dissapointed thereby and fall unto that which we least
feared, it would make us not to trust (as the most men do) unto such weak
and broken reeds* but only unto the LORD, in his blessing upon the
obedience of his own commandment, laboring above all things to put the same
in practice, and to commit the success of it unto him, who (only is wise,
and knows how to bring every thing to a prosperous end. The Prophet does
yet further proceed, in laying open this matter, God (often) punishes the
abuse of greatest abundance with greatest want.
and urging them to be affected with it, showing that the drunkardes, who
heretofore have wallowed in all abundance of wine, even unto excess, shall
have their condytion so far changed, that it shall utterly be cut from their
mouths, that is, they shall not have any taste of it at al a merueilous change,
(if it be well considered) that they shall come from so great plentye unto
such exceeding penury: but we may see therein the just judgment of God, y^
sends upon man the gretest want of those things wherein he has most abused
himself, the which is notably set down by our Savior Christ, Luke. 15.16.
in the example of the prodical son, of whom it is said, yt after he had
lauished out his patrimony upon whores and riotous company, he came unto such
exceeding misery, that he would gladly have fed upon the husks that the swine
ate, but none gave them unto him, to the end (if we will profit by it) that we
may learn to imploye all Gods blessings aright, but especially those whereof
we have most abundance, least the Lord conceiving displeasure against us,
do so remove them from us, as we be brought into greater misery and want then
they y^ never inioyed any of them. The manner how this great want shall come
upon them, is also to be observed, whereas it is said, that it shall be
pulled or (as the original word signifies) be cut from their mouths,
whereby he means, that it shall be taken away without any remnant left, to
come unto them, to the end, that they might further consider of the exceeding
need that they should be driven into, and so be persuaded, that the wrath of
the Lord was more fierce against them* which could not be appeased without a
special repentance on their behalf, and that in more measure than was
required of others, who had in less measure provoked his displeasure. For
albeit the Lord is no way appeased with any, unless he do unfeignedly repent
him of his wicked wais: yet he looks for a more deep lamentation and sorrow
to be in those who have most grievously offended his majesty. The greatest
sinner must repent most deeply.
Besides this, the manner of the speech does show unto us the marvelous
security that they were overwhelmed in, and the greatness of their
incredulity, that being so sinful, as their own consciences could not choose
but now and then accuse them, and having among others, this prophet, The
impenitent never leave* their sin until Gods vengeance enforce them.
so plainly to deal with them, do yet cleave so fast unto their sins, as
nothing can remove them from delighting therein, until the means whereby
they are fostered, be violently taken away, in whom we see a right pattern
of the obstinate and impenitent sinner, who will never be brought to mislike
his offenses, nor to be persuaded that he is (by reason of them) in dangerous
plight, until such time as GOD do set to his hand, and by some unwonted
work of his justice do punish them, or until they fall into that
punnishement which before has been threatened against them: the examples that
the word of GOD does affoorde unto us (besides the too plentiful experience
that we have of it) do show this to be true: the destruction that was
denounced against the old world by the space of Genesis 6.3.
120 years, could never make them believe, that GOD would punish them
indeed: it had been a hard matter to make the Genesis 19.14
Sodomites believe that they should be consumed with fire and brimstone until
they felt it by their woeful experience: little thought Pharaoh that ever the
Israelites should depart out of Egypt, and he with his people be drowned for
pursuing them, until the sea Ezo. 14.27.
overwhelmed him and all his host: and would not the Jews have laughed him to
scorn (think you) that should have avouched that unto them which our savior
told his disciples, that even the day should come when Luke 19.44.
one stone of their goodly temple should not be left upon an other. The
Scripture is full of such examples, and the world more full: it is the nature of
sin to chain men's affections so near unto it, as all the threatenings,
persuasions, exhortations, or any other the most forcible kind of speech that
can be used, are not able to prevail with him, to make him believe it shall be
so, until it come to pass, and that he see it is so indeed: and therefore
it is no marvel (there being no discipline to drive men unto outward
godliness unless it please them) if so many in every place, (yea where the
word is most sincerely preached) do run the race of wickedness (it being
a matter so hard to leave) and so few that do unfeignedly fear God, and show
forth the fruits of it in their conversation.

Yea a nation comes) Albeit the word that is here translated, Yea, 8.9.
does naturally signify, For, or Because, and the word, Comes, in the
Hebrewe be the time past: whereby these words may seem to be either a reason
of the former threatenings, or else a speech of an other punishment, which the
Jews did already feel more grievous than the Famine: for that it is not
greatly material, it being spoken to declare their mystery, and bring them to
repentance: whether it be spoken of the plague past, or to come, I will not
much stand upon the one more than the other, albeit I see nothing against it,
why we may not rather understand it of that which is to come, than of any thing
that they felt already, both for that it is clear, that he speaks of a
different plague from the former, as also, that some things be spoken in the
discourse following, which can hardly be said of the time past: neither does
that any way prejudice this sense, that the words in the Hebrew do all run, in
the time past, as speaking of a thing already done: for they that are but a
little acquainted with the phrase of the Prophets, do know, that it is their
usual manner, to speak of the things to come, as though they were already
come to pass; to the end, that the certainty of their prophecies may more
evidently appear. The sum of the words, is a description of the force and
(...) of their enemies, to the end, that they might be driven to seek unto GOD
for aid and strength to resist them. The lessons that we have to learn out of
the same be diverse: first, in that the Lord, for the reclaiming of man unto
him self, God uses many and diverse means to draw man unto himself.
does (besides his word which is the ordinary means) use many and diverse
afflictions, oftentimes of contrary kind one to an other, to the end, that if
he will not be moved with the one, yet he may be drawn on by the other, so
did he deal with the Egyptians his ennimies, first, sending one plague, then
an other, after that a third, and so to the number of ten, and all to the
end that he might draw them to yield obedience to his commandment of
letting his people go: so dealte he also with the Israelites his chosen people,
often, sometimes afflicting them with civil wars at Judge. 12.1.
home, sometimes with invasion of ennimies from Esaias 36.1.
far, and sometimes with great 2. Kin. 6.25.
dearths and scarcity of vittailes, sometimes with grievous diseases, as the
2. Sa. 24.15.
plague and pestilence: and all to this end, that they might be drawn out of
those corruptions and enormities wherein they delighted, unto the true and
sincere service of the everliving God, whose people they always professed
themselves to be, so does he deal with us (as we may see by our own
experience) sometimes he afflicts us with sickness, and if that do us no
good, he sends outward trouble by unquiet neighbors, if that prevail not,
he brings us into poverty, after that into troubles, in respect of our
wives, children, families, or kinsefolkes: all which he does to drive us from
delighting in any thing of this life, that might draw us unto sin, and to
put our whole affiaunce in him alone: This doctrine commend unto us: 1. Gods
care of our good. 2. How excuse is taken from us, and that by the testimony of
our own conscience.

the which, as it does on the one side commend unto us the great desire that
the Lord shows himself to have of our good, in that he tieth so many
conclusions to profit us, so on the other side it shows unto us, how al
coulor of excuse is taken from man, that when he does any way amiss, and is
punished for it, he shall be able to lay the blame in nothing in the world but
himself only, yea, he shall by his own knowledge aggrauate unto himself
his own damnation: for he shall truly say of himself: Has not GOD from
time to time told me of my faults, by the ministry of his seruanutes, and
called me to repentance? And when that would not serve, has he not put to
his own hand touching me with diverse afflictions, to bring me unto
himself, and have not I despised all these means, and preferred my delight
and pleasure in sin above whatsoever was promised in his holy word? What
can I say for my self but even this? That all the punishements that can be
inflicted upon me, either in this life, or in that which is to come, are no
more than my misdemeanour and obstinate refusal of grace and goodness have
justly deserved.

It does also declare unto us the miserable corruption that Manne is
naturallye defiled wythall: 3. Our palpable corruption.
and the great backewardnesse that is in him toward any good thing, that
being by so many, and so excellent means invited unto his own wealth, does
yet notwythstanding, still renounce and refuse it, to the end, that we may
learn how hard a matter it is for a man to beecome truly religious, and
how easy a thing it is for a man to deceive himself, in a persuasion of that
which (in deed) he is far from. For do we not see, that he whose estate
(of all other) is most wretched, does yet notwithstanding flatter him self,
deeming his condition to be as good as the best, and so either thinks that
he is so religious as he needs to be, or else, that it is a thing easly
attained unto, whereupon it comes to pass that he says Job. 21.14.
unto knowledge, depart from me, and unto reformation, I will not be acquainted
with thee. But if his eyes were opened by the spirit of God, that he might
see what a straight gate he must enter in at, before he can come to the
treasure of an upright conscience, and how many lets and hindrances rest in
himself to keep him from it, how many colorable deceits his own heart
hatcheth to keep him in sin, then should he be brought willingly to
confess how deeply he had drunk before, of the cup of corrupt judgment,
and how far he was from any goodness, when he thought him self to be in
excellent estate.

Diverse objections of of the Israelites answered.
The prophet describing the quality of their enemies, does speak in such
manner, as every word that he utters does prevent an objection that they
might allege, and for their safety and security in that land against all
adversaries. The first objection. God placed us here.
For first, whereas they might say for themselves, we are such a people as
there is not the like, being al of the stock of one man, and brought from
elsewhere to inhabit this land, in spite of all that could be against it,
and therefore being placed here by the hand of god, what people is there in
the world that can annoy us, to which the prophet answers, by saying: a
nation comes, as if he should say you can allege no thing for your selves in
regard of any privileges or immunities that you enjoy, but God is able to
entitle an other people into the like: yea, and will now do it, for the sins of
the Cananites having driven them out before your face, what cause can there be
why your sins also should not expel you before your enemies, unless you think
that God is not as much displeased with sin in one people, as he is in another.
Now this being diligently marked, is very profitable for our present
instruction: for when we hear of invasions to come upon this land, and of
foreign foes to bend their power against us, we do by and by flee unto that
broken reed of our own settled estate, and allege carnal reasons for our selves
whereby we persuade our own hearts of continuance in the same condition, as
before, and so make no reckoning (at least to work any amendment in us before
god) but say peace, peace, and promise to our selves invincible security: but
let it be said unto us, as it might justly be said to the Israelites. Was not
the people that inhabited this land, of as great valor as we are? Nay, were
they not Anachims, that is, great and mighty giants upon the face of the earth?
what was it the^ that overthrew them, and placed us in their rooms, our own
strength or multitude? Alas, no, for they were mo in number, and stronger in
strength than they that overcame them, but it was their exceeding sin, the
measure whereof was come to the full, and the heinousness whereof ascended into
the ears of the Lord of Hosts, and cried for vengeance: but this (you may
say) was long ago, and it may be it was not true. Admit it were so, let me
then propound it in an example, so late and new as many of us are eye and
eare-witnesses of: the kingdom of the Pope, that even (as it were) yesterday,
was so seated and settled in this land, that it held all men willingly captive
thereunto. What ouerthrewe that? We cannot say, that it was our number, for
the most of us were then in the loins of them that mourned for the overthrow
of their honor, neither can we say, that it was our strength, wisdom, or
policy, for in all these they did far exceed us: but it was even the
heinous and horrible sins that were committed (without controllment) amongst
them, even in the sight of the Sun: if then it be found (which a blind man
may easilye find out) that sin is grown unto as great a head amongst us
as it was amongst them, and as little punished as then it was: what can we
look for, but even the judgment that fell upon them, unless we think the
Lord to be partial on our sides more than on theirs.

But you will say, the case is not alike, for they were idolaters, and thrown
out for their idolatry, that we might be planted that profess and maintain
true religion: it is true, but might not the Israelites allege this much
rather for themselves? and yet when they sinned, it profited them nothing: let
us not therefore cover our shame with any of these fig leaves, but rather say
with the apostle Romans 11.21 The second objection. We are the Lords inheritance.
if God spared not the natural branches, take heed least he also spare not
thee. They might further say for themselves, the Lords inheritance is here,
and though he should be willing to let us be overrun, yet he will respect
us, for so much as we are the people with whom he has chosen to dwell for ever.
That this pretense might also be removed, the Lord says by his Prophet, A
nation comes upon my land, as if he should say, albeit I have separated it
unto my self, and chosen my self a seat to dwell there, yet shall not that
privilege be any let: but I will nevertheless send upon them the rod of my
wrath to execute my justice and vengeance upon their sins: this being then
the meaning of the holie-ghost in this point, it remains that we observe out
of the same, these two profitable doctrines for our instruction: the first is
this, in that the Lord calls it his land, we do learn, that whatsoever
preeminences they had, wherewith they could prefer themselves unto other
people, it came from the Lords blessing alone, for they themselves were as
miserable when God took them to himself as any people could be (which if it
be well weyed) will teach us when we think of our prerogatives that we
excel others in, Exech. 16. If we excel others, it comes from the Lord
alone.
not to insulte presumptuously over them, and to wax insolent, forgetting who
separated us, but to give all glory unto God alone, from whom (indeed) every
good thing that we have did come, and not from any thing in our selves:
secondly, in that he sends this nation to the overthrow of his own people,
we learn, that the privilege of grace and mercy, in the favor of GOD, or
any prerogative of this life does not give us license to sin, The
privileges of grace give us not leave to sin, then much less any other.
or be more careless of the true worship and service of God, but
(notwithstanding all that we can say for our selves) when we transgress the
commandments of God, we shall receive the punishment due unto the same, which
thing is worthy to be noted, for we see that very many take occasion to live
looselie in the course of their life, under pretense of this, that they are
received unto grace, Christ died for sinners: and many will do that which is
unlawful, because they be wealthy, and can buy it out, or great in calling,
and can bolster it, or have many friends, and who dare meddle with them. If
any of these would reason thus with themselves, the Israelites had as many
things to allege for themselves as they, and yet when they sinned, they
escaped not unpunished, it would make them more careful that they offend not
the Lord, whose punishing hand is not turned away, but rather made more heavy,
by those his blessings, wherewyth he has enriched us.

The third objection. We are strong.
Moreover, if they should say, though they come, they can do us no harm, for
we are strong, and full of manhood and courage, the Prophet wipeth away that
objection also, when he says, that the nation that comes is mighty, as if
he should have said, never stand upon such terms, as that you be valiant,
and therefore they can not hurt you, for they are a mighty people strengthened
with the power of that God, who hitherto has enabled you against all those
enemies that set themselves against you, but now he has turned his face, not
against the^ that come against you, but even against your selves: whereby the
Prophet teaches unto us this lesson, that it is a vain thing for any man
(when he hears of the coming of enemies) to stand upon his reputation, and
persuade himself, that he and his countri-men be of such courage, that none
shall do them any hurt, and it is (indeed) the common speech of us
Englishemen, for we are so proud in our power, and so warlike (as we take
our selves, especially when we sit on our ale-bench) that we think every
stranger does quake at the name of an Englishman, and we have to allege for
our selves the Histories of former times, in which it appears that our
ancestors have done great matters that way: which I do confess to be true,
and if we were as well acquainted with the Chronicles of other nations, it
may be we should find as great matters (if not greater) brought to pass
by many of them, for GOD has ever given unto several nations their glory
one above an other, to one in this age, to an other in the next, as the course
of the four Monarchs does euidentlye declare. But can we say any more for
our selves in this point, than the Babylonians might have said for themselves,
the Medes and Persians for themselves, the Assyrians for themselves, the
Grecians for themselves, and the Romans for themselves? and yet their glory
is decayed, and every one of them has sustained a shameful foil by their
adversaries, yea, of obscure name in the world. Nay, can we build our selves
in more saftie than the Israelites might? who had all the privileges that God
ever bestowed upon any, and so many triumphant victories over their several
adversaries, that their very name made the hearts of the kings on the earth to
quake: and yet for all this, where are they now? what is become of their
glorious estate that was so famous throughout the world? Surely, it is defaced
and brought to utter ruin, so that they are become a byword, and speech of
reproach unto all nations under the sun, a most vain thing it is therefore, to
stand upon our own strength, seeing, that they only shall prevail in
battle, whom the Lord will make mighty, yea though they be as weak as
David, and their adversaries so strong (in the judgment of men) as Goliath the
Philistin. The fourth objection. We are many.
Now if they should yet except against the Prophet, that they are a people of
infinite number, insomuch, that to go about to overthrow them, were to dry up
the sea, and measure the sand upon the shore. He preuenteth that when he
says, that this mighty people that comes, is without number, that is, as
many as no man is able to reckon: and this is also a common allegation, that we
bring to persuade our selves that no foreign foes can ouerrunne us, seeing that
our land is so peopled, that we seem to be as the stars in the sky, that
cannot be numbered: but it is as vain, as any of the former. For may not one
nation be as populous as an other? can there be so many fighting men in one
kingdom, as cannot be found elsewhere, and though it were so, that our
adversaries were not able to match us this way, has the victory alwais fallen
on the side of the greatest host? no, for the holy word of God affords
unto us many examples to the contrary. Genesis 14.17
Abraham going out with 318. men, only did discomfite four kings and all
their hosts, and delivered Lot from their captivity. A man would think that
the Judge. 7.12.
Medianites and Amalekites, being against Israel in number as the sand of the
sea, should never have been overthrown: and yet the Lord discomfited them by
the hand of Gideon, Judge. 17.12.
and his three hundred soldiers, without any stroke of weapon, but only the
breaking of pichers, blowing of trumpettes, and crying, the swoorde of the Lord
and of Gideon. Was not ye power of Senacherib king of Ashur, with a mighty
number by the conduction of his servant Rabshaketh, when he besieged
Jerusalem with an army of Esaias. 37.36
an hundred, four score and 50000. valiant men, and yet they were al
overthrown in one night: so that it is a broken reed of Egypt, when we rely
upon multitudes, who are nothing against those few, unto whom the Lord will
give the victory. The 5. obection. They will be dismayed being in a strange
country.
In the words following does the prophet also prevent that which might be
alleged against the enemies, that if they come, being in a strange land, they
could not tell in how many dangers they should be, they should not be able to
have any stomach to proceed or if they did, they would quickly be quailed,
because they should never see an end of encounters, and so forth: all which is
meet with all, when he says, that they shall have teeth as a lion, that is, be
sharp and fierce, and besides that, have the jaws of a great lion, that is,
not run them selves out of breath, with their fiercenes, but prevail and
become invincible: In which words, are the enemies of the Church of GOD very
notably described, whether they be such as have a will and cannot, or have
not only a will, but also power to make havoc, and do hurt unto Gods
people.

The first sort of enemies be described in the former Metaphor, wherein they
are said, to have the teeth of a lion, that is, to be sharp, and bitter, very
willing and desirous to rauine and devour, and prepared for the purpose against
the day that they desire. And of this mind are (no doubt) all the Papists,
that are in England, whether they be recusants or church-papistes,
notwithstanding that they pretend a love unto the state, The affection of an
English papist.
and a contentedness to live quietly in it, so that they may be let alone to
use their conscience (as they falselye do term their heretical opinions) yet
indeed, because they bear a deadly hatred unto the religion of Jesus Christ
(which is the only pillar whereon the safety of her Majesty, and the
commonwealth stands, and shall stand so safelye as they lean unto it, and
no more nor longer) if they do not unto us all the mischief that can be
devised, it is for no other cause but only this, that God takes away from
them opportunity to bring it to pass: and to the end that this may appear to
be true, (for they have plaide the part of Ismael so long, that too many of
us be brought to be as credulous as Gedoliah) look into the perticulars of
their behavior, Iere. 40.16.
in their several countries where they dwell, and callinges wherein they are:
and you shall see that they bend all their credit, and authority to the
crossing of religion, Let them observe this that think papists may be good
subjects.
(which is the staff of our state) and the countenauncing of treacherous
papists, who be the sworn underminers of our welfare, either in soul or
body: and therefore I marvel, that any wise men can be drawn to think, that
ever a papist can perform any loyal service to her Majesty, or good to his
country, unless it be to wind him self in, that he may after do the
greater hurt, as the experience of many of them has showed in the sight of all
men. And this is not only true in those rich enemies to religion the papists,
but even in all other that be wicked men, whether they be Atheists, or men
given unto wickedness of life: we see how (oftentimes) many of them do currie
with Gods Children, but yet let us never trust them the more, albeit, it be
better that a dog fawn upon us, then bark and bite us, yet it is most sure
that they never fawn, but to the end that they may come near unto us, and
bite more earnestly. The second sort of enemies, is described in both these
terms set together: for the one importing sharpnes, and the other strength or
might, his meaning is, that they shall have an earnest desire to devour, and an
invincible might to execute the same: which when they meet together, what spoil
they make of all good things, the daily experience of them where they are
lysted to do what they will, As appears by the Guise and his accomplices of
France.
does evidently show unto us, and the effect that this of theirs in this place
brings to pass, will declare unto us in the next sermon: only let this be
the sum for this time, that all men who are not truly religious, do bear a
bitter emnitie unto the same, and the professors thereof, which if it appear
not by their works, it is either because, they want power to their will, or
because God brideleth them by one means or other, to the end that we may
learn to take heed, how we be familiar with any of them, or trust them
further than we see them, for if we do, we shall see at one tine or other,
that they never did bear any faithful friendship unto us.

The third sermon. Verse. 7. He makes my vine waste, and pilleth off the bark
of my fig tree: he makes it bare, and casts it down: the branches
thereof are made white.
10.11.
HE makes my vine waste.) The prophet having showed, ye power, multitude, and
fury of the enemies that came upon the land, he now proceeds to declare,
what they shall do, and that in a borrowed speech, wherein he comparing the
people of Israel and their land, unto a vine, he does in the perticulars,
explane the hurt that this inuading people should do, saying, he pulls down
the hedge, and all defense that was round about it, and not only that, but
least it should flourish, and bring forth in such abundance, as heretofore,
he pilleth the bark from it, to the end that the sap which it should be
nourished withal, may neither ascend, nor descend, yea he makes it bare
round about, that no hope of juice may be left in it, he throws it down,
least the roots should send up some new branches, insomuch that it is clean
wythered away: the meaning (in one word) is, he brings it to utter ruin
and final destruction, that it shall be past hope, ever to recover again.
The end of all these so many words to express the thing, is, that the
people might be brought unto a deep consideration thereof, not only in the
truth, but also the measure of it: For such is our nature, that when any
danger is fore-tolde, to fall upon us, either we do not believe it,
persuading our selves that no such matter shall come to pass, or if we
think it will so fall out indeed, we do in our own opinions so extenuate and
lessen it, that it makes (in a manner) no impression in our hearts, never
moving us to take it to heart vnfeygnedlie: and therefore does the Prophet lay
open this judgment of theirs so perticularly: so that the prophets meaning
being this, we learn from ye same, first this lesson, It is the property of the
godly to do good, and of the wicked to make havoc of every good thing.
to wit, by what note, and mark we may discern the godly from the wicked,
which is by their fruits, for as it is the property of gods children
(considering) that they are placed in this life to advance Gods glory, and
benefit his Church) to labor by all lawful means how they may do good, and
better things that any way are amiss, and may be amended by them: so on
the other side the wicked, because they are the children of confusion, and
disorder, do (if it lie in their hands) make havoc of every good thing,
quickly ouerturning that, which has been long in framing by the careful
diligence of others. Now in that the Lord by the mouth of his prophet says
that they bring destruction upon his vine, he means thereby (as David Psalm.
80.8.
does in the like case) the people of Israel his Church, which he had there
planted with his own right hand, whereby he does first of all give them to
understand, that what soever privileges they could any way challenge unto
themselves above all other nations, the same proceeded not from any good
thing, that came of themselves, but only from this, that the Lord had
beautified them with some excellency beyond others, to the end that they
might know, that the Lord in his promise, of deliverance and protection, was
no longer tied unto them, then they were careful to perform the couenaunts of
the league which were to be done on their behalf: which thing is worthy the
noting, that we may make our own profit of it, for we see that many men,
being of greater gifts in the outward things of this life then others be, do
so insolently demean them selves, that they offer injury unto many, yea (by
sinning against the Lord) unto their own souls, and persuade them selves,
that for such and such causes no evil shall happen unto them: but if they did
consider with themselves, yt if they enjoy any good thing, it arises from
this, that the Lord has (in mercy enriched them) it would make them both more
humble in their own eyes, and made careful to yield obedience unto the Lord,
who has so many ways been good unto them: again, in that the Lord calls
not only the land his (as in the former verse) but also them with all the
beautye wherein they excelled to be his, that is brought to ye pass by his
framing and furnishing of them: he showed that he had so put his blessings
into their hands, We may not do what we list with gods blessings bestowed on us.
as yet they remained still his own by which he did look to be honored and
served: which techeth unto us this lesson, yt all the things which we do enjoy
here upon the face of the earth, (whether they be for ye furniture of the mind)
as learning, wisdom and such like) or for the body, as riches, honor, credit,
health, or strength, or whatsoever else: are not so absolutely in our possession
as we may imploye them as please us without controllment, but only as of
trust, to be bestowed unto his use that is the owner of them: that is, to the
glory of that GOD, whose only they are: which thing is worthy to be noted, for
albeit it be true, that there is not (almost) any one that will not easily
confess in words, that we are but stewards of these things for a time, yet
(indeed) a very few of us do steadfastlie believe it, for if every man
were fully persuaded, that he must give account of his stewardship unto the
Lord, who will be answered how every thing is bestowed: were it possible
(think you) that the blessings of God that are given us for the advancement
of his glory and our own good, should so generaly he turned to the defacing of
his honor, and destruction of our own souls? is it possible, for the idle
person that loytereth out that good leisure which he has, doing no good? or
the ruffin that lauisheth out all his patrimony upon bravery? or the
whoormonger, that gives him self over to uncleanness, or the Atheist that
makes a jest of Gods word, to make any man of reason believe, that he
thinks that ever he shall come to a reckoning for these things? no, no: if
he did think it (indeed) it would make his heart quake within him to think
of the rearedges that he is already run into, and the straightnes of the
judge, when he takes the account, and in consideration thereof, it would make
him have such a watchful eye over himself, that he would never cease to use al
good means that might draw his affections inwardly, and his temporal blessings
outwardly, to be holy bent to honor him* whose heavenly disposition has cast
them upon him to ye end, besides this: he calls it his vine, to this end,
that he might bring the^ to a due consideration of his continual care over
them, that so their own consciences might convict the^ of the greater
ingratitude against his majesty, and declare them to be worthy of the more
heavy judgments which also serves for our instruction, for if this be a true
saiing of Christ our Savior, that he that has Mat. 25.16.
received five talents must make his account according to that rate, that is,
must gain to his master, the increase of such a quantity, if he and his
reckoning be accepted: and if this be also true, that he who has most Luke
7.43.
debt forgiven him, ought (in reason) to acknowledge himself best beholden
unto the forgiuer, and so love him more entirely: then surely that stands
as an infallible truth, in the eyes of the majesty of God, that the more
blessings we receive from his hand, the greater must our obedience be unto
him, or else the more intolerable shall our damnation be. Which if it were
learned, then should this be a general rule in the world, the greater that a
man is in riches, wisdom credit, or any other preferment, the holier, the
zealouser, and more obedient unto God he should be, but while it is not
regarded, the clean contrary is practiced, that so many things as we excel
others in, or abound in, so many occasions do we take to draw us into sin,
and wickedness, but let such persons (if they will learn any thing) know,
that as they have been advanced higher, in the things of this life then
others have, so shall they (for abusing the good blessings of God be thrown
down lower into hell, and receive the greater condemnation. Moreover in that,
this vine of the lords own planting and dressing, is said to come to such a
miserable confusion and ruin, we may first behold the vnspeake-able hatred
that the Lord bears unto sin, who cannot abide it, nor let it go
unpunished, God cannot abide sin, no not in his dearest children.
no not in his peculier people whom he made more reckoning off, then of all
the world besides, which if we could see and perceive, and make profit of it
for our selves, we should find it an exceeding help unto godliness, and a
breaknecke, of all impiety and wickedness: for we see that the most men
now-adaies (yea many of them, that take them selves to be great gospellers)
do but make a very mock of sin, not esteeming it of any importance, either to
do good or harm, but if they have committed it, laugh it out, or if they
cannot shift it off, an other help shall come, God is merciful: they them
selves in the mean while conceiving no grief at it at al, but if they had
learned on the one side, that God does most infinitlye detest sin in all men,
whose fierce wrath (without repentance) they can never hide themselves from:
and on the other side, that if they be the children of GOD, there must be a
likeness between him and them, that those things which he loves without
measure, they ought to love vnfeignedlie, and those things that he hates
with a perfect hatred, they must hate from the bottom of their hearts, or else
they can have no assurance, that they be any better tha^ bastards, it would
(doubtless) make them to look better about them, and have in more detestation,
all sin and iniquity both in themselves and others. The malice of the wicked
against the church is unappeasable.
Secondly we do learn the unappeasable malice, that the wicked do bear to the
church of God, for albeit this punishment was a just judgment of God upon the
Israelites for their rebellion against his majesty, yet the instruments that
he used for the effecting thereof, had no such intent, but did run on head,
being set on fire with an hateful spite against them, and a thirsting desire
to satisfy their own affection: now in that it is said, that they not only
lay it wast, but pill it, make it bare, and cast it down: it appears
manifestly, that their malice was not satisfied in hurting them, nor spoiling
them, nor yet in killing and destroying many of them: but still they proceeded
to the utter racing out of their memory (as much as in them was) from under the
sun: and if we look into the examples of the word of God, we shall see the
same verified in practice from time to time. Pharaoh the king of Egypt, did not
only impose upon the Israelites such Ezo. 1.11.15.
burdens as they were not able to bear, but also gave commandment, that all
the male children should be killed, to the end, that within one generation,
they might be rooted out: the malice of the Jews against Christ, and his
church, appears in the history of the Evangelists and Acts, to be so great,
that they not only pursued him to death, but also other, that would any way
take his part, the daily experience of the bloud-sucking papists does verify
the same: and if any man do seem to marvel why it should be so, seeing,
that we be all the sons of Adam, and therefore shall be desirous to ask a
reason of it, if he will look into the holy word of God, he shall easily
find that the cause thereof is this: God has not ordained all men to be saved,
Why the wicked do so deadly hate the godly.
but has cast off the greatest number in his eternal displeasure to be
vessels of his wrath with the Devil and his angels, all which being in this
life the vassals of satan, to put in execution his ancient emnity against
Gods people, are set on fire by him, from time to time, to work Christ Jesus
(in his members) the greatest spite that they can, whereupon it comes, that
the wicked do from time to time do so much hurt, and bear so unreconcilable
hatred to the godly: the use of which doctrine is, that we never promise unto
our selves any security here, but prepare our bodies and souls unto the batel
against sin, the world, and the Devil, so long as we shall be in this vale of
misery. The havoc that the enemies make in Israel, does clearlie show unto
us, what will and courage they came up withal, to wit, with a hope and purpose
to overcome the whole Land, and yet a man would have thought (if they had
but considered the vnspeake-able victories* that the Israelites had gotten
against all their enemies of all nations) that they never durst have set
upon them, least the same cude should befall them, that came unto the
attempters of the like, and so much the rather, for that it was observed by
the wise men of the Gentiles (as appears by the words of Ester. 6.13.
Zeresh, the wife of Haman, who told her husband, that if Mordecay were of the
seed of the Jews, before whom he had begun to fall, he should not
prevail, but fall before him) that the people of Israel had always the
victory over their ennimies in the end. But their example does show unto us,
the marvelous blindness of the enemies of the truth, who albeit they have
never so often the repulse, and receive never so many shameful overthrows by
setting themselves against the godly, yet they will never learn to leave off,
but always go on in the hardness of their heart (as Pharaoh did) until they
come to be drowned in the red sea of eternal perdition from the presence of
god, which is the cause that men go on even in these last days, as earnestly
in the course of ungodliness, as ever they did. For if time (which makes men
wise by experience in other things) could teach the ungodly any fear of
God, or if continual course of Gods vengeance against sinners (some presidentes
whereof the eyes of all men do now and then behold) yea, if our own
particular experience could profit us any whit that way: the world being now
so old, should have been before this time marvelous holy: but the god of
this world having (above all other) fore-closed the eyes of the reprobate, that
they should not see these things, and also ruling in the^, with that vncessa^t
hatred (which we heard of before) against the godly, does so cunningly
blindfold them, that the wiser they should be (by reason of their time) the
worse they wax, and further from al goodness.

Now it remains that we make one entire aplication of ye whole matter unto
our selves, for our further instruction considering that Romans 15.4.
whatsoever was written before was written for our learning, and seeing that
the Holy Ghost tells us, that 1. Cor. 10.11.
these things fell upon ye Israelites for exampls, and were written to
admonish us upon whom the ends of the world are come, that the word of the
Lord being the unsearchable rule of his eternal will, might tech unto us what we
are to look for, either in the performance of his mercies to the^ that fear
him, or ye execution of his judgments upon the transgressors of his
commandments, to the end (then) that this application may be the more
evident, Mark this application, and note the conclusion of it.
we are first to lay this foundation, that God remains now the same that then
he was, the arm of his power to execute his vengeance being no way shortened,
and the fountain of his mercy toward his elect, being not drawn dry:
secondly, we are to be resolved of this, yt his word is therefore left unto us
that we may learn out of the same what is his will (which he will in his
appointed time bring to pass) among men. These two principls being laid, we
must a little consider the manner of the Lords dealing with the Israelites* how
it agrees with his dealing with us, and so conclude the application unto our
selves. The Israelites having had many a blessing bestowed upon the^ (as namely
the quiet possession of the land of Canaan, with the plentiful store of al
good things that it yielded unto them) were not only taught by the lords
messe^gers (which he raised up among them from time to time) the true fear
of God, and manner how he will be worshipped, but also the right use of those
blessings: and we have received from his hands the like temporal blessings
(if not greater) and have been taught and instructed in as plentiful a manner,
how to fear God and employ his benefits bestowed upon us (or if we have
not, the cause rests in our selves, that have refused instruction, and the
means that might have doubled it amongst us.) The Israelites began to wax
fat with the good things of this life, and over turning the sincere worship
of God, fell to Idolatry, and all other ungodly behavior: and we did long
ago begin to be at Amos. 6.1.
ease in Syon, and rest upon the mountains of Samaria, insomuch that we are
now approached unto the seat of all iniquity, not only in that, many that
never saw the golden calfe in the wilderness, are fallen to the worship of
the whore of Rome, but also in that all iniquity does so prevail that a
general Atheism ouerspredeth the face of the whole land. The Israelites were
(by those prophets whom God sent unto them) reproved for their backesliding,
threatened to be plagued by the hand of God, and cried out of that good land,
and also taught how to begin and proceed in a reformation acceptable in the
sight of God: and we have (both by the lively voice, and writings of Gods
ministers) been reproved the judgments of God denounced out of his word
against us, and plainly taught out of the same word, what way to take, both
for the appeasing of Gods wrath against our sins already committed, and also
for taking such a way, as may (indeed) stop up the spring heads of all the
abominations in this land. The Israelites were so far from hearkening to the
voice of God by his Prophets, that they entreated them evil, imprisoned, and
shamefullie abused them: and we have so little profited by the voice of God
sounding in our ears, by the mouths of Gods Ministers, and make so little
account of the reformation offered unto us by the mouth of God, that we
conceive displeasure against the messengers.

The Israelites (when the Lord saw that the ministry of his servants
profited them not) were afflicted with the hand of God, and among other
scourges, with a scarcity of bread, which they had inioyed before in great
abundance: and we have had the hand of God many ways upon us (howsoever we
have felt it) and among others, with that scarcity of bread (though not in the
like extremity) that they felt. The Israelites not profiting by this gentle
correction from the Lord, but continuing in their ungodly ways without
repentance, were threatened to have their foreign foes invade them, and utterly
to ouerturne both the state of religion, and the common wealth, subduing the
land unto intolerable misery: and we are threatened (I will not say with whom,
nor when, no more tha^ this Prophet did) with a people as great as they were,
as ravenous to devour, as desirous of our confusion, as their foes were of
theirs. If then we have no more to allege for our selves than they had, if we
have sinned as grievously as they had, if God have taken the same course with
us, that he did with them, if we profit as little by it as they did, and if
he remain the same God without changing that then he did: then let me see
who can allege any reason why I may not conclude, that as fearful a
destruction approaches fast upon England as fell upon them.

12.
Mourn like a virgin) The Prophet having denounced against the Israelites
those judgments which their sins had procured against them, and the
holy ghost had put in his mouth to speak of, least that now they should
proceed in desparate manner in the committing and increasing of their sins,
because there was no way with them but destruction, he proceeds now to show
unto them the only way that is to be found for the^ to take, that they may
escape the judgments which aproched on them, and be freed from those that they
did already feel. God threatens to the end to draw us to repentance.
In that the prophet having simply denounced gods judgments without any clause
of exception (unless they repent or any such like) and yet does afterward enter
into this trety of persuading the^ to mourn, we may plainly see the end of
the Lords threatening of us by his word, through the ministry of his servants,
not to be our final desolation (unless we stop our ears refusing admonishment,
and harden our hearts, not believing his word) but to the end that we being
brought to the sight of our miserable estate by reason of sin, and of the
punishments that we deserve for the same might be rowzed from the delighting
in, and love of any transgression, unto a true and unfeigned amendment of our
ways, and so into a better condition than before: the which (indeed) causes ye
godly not only to be contented to hear their faults ripped up, their sins
reproved, and the judgments of God laid open against them, but even to desire
and long after it in such wise that they think themselves best edified, when
their corruptions be most ripped up, because they think it to be an argument
of the Lords great love toward them, who will not only have them to
profess, believe, and take comfort in his truth, but also to be daily more and
more conformed unto the image of his son Christ Jesus, by unfeigned obedience
unto his laws. But the ungodly on the other side) because they cannot 1. Cor.
2.14
discern the things that are of God, and therefore not perceive what good the
Lord offers unto them, when he launcheth the festered wound of their
sins, with the sharp knife of the law of God, nay because they cannot be
persuaded, that the particular application of reproof unto their several
conditions of men, is of God, but only proceeding from the fantastical
immagynation or chollericke affection of the speaker, therefore it comes to
pass, that they hearing any thing spoken that seems to point at them, they
storm like mad men and conceive such a heavy displeasure against the speaker,
that (if it lie in their power) he shall know by their kicking, that they
felt themselves pitifully galled: but if they do know, or could be brought to
believe, that such reproouers be the instruments of GOD for their good, it
would make them to be so far from being offended with the^, that it would
make them esteem of them with such reverence, as the messengers of so good
things are worthy of, but because it works these contrary effects in men
of contrary dispositions, the one being a note of a godly heart* and the
other bewraying a wicked mind; it rests, that every one of us, enter into
consideration of our own estates, tying our several hearts by this
touchstone, whereby we shall know whether we be of that number which are
godly, or of the sort of them which abhor the ways of the Lord.

When the Holy Ghost does in this place by the mouth of the Prophet exhorts
the Israelites to mourn, he means not only the outward lamentation which is
apparent in the eyes of men, but rather that, whereby this mourning is
effected, to wit, the sorrow and inward grief of heart, which they were to
conceive in regard of the anger of God against them appearing by so many
fearful effects: So that the meaning of the Prophet being laid down, it
remains that we observe the things that are to be noted for our
instruction: the first is, the ground whereupon this lamentation must be
taken up, which may seem to be only in regard of the temporal
punishementes that so heavily pressed them, The difference between the sorrow
of the wicked and the godly.
which if it were true, then were there no more required at their hands, but
only that which the wicked may easily, and do dailye (in the like case)
perform: for we see it a common thing, in daily proof, that the ungodly
(whose felicity is in this life) being deprived of any worldly commodity,
do take it so to heart, as it wringeth (often) from them great sorrow and
lamentation, and yet they no whit the nearer to GOD: so did Genesis 27.34
Esau, when he saw that he had lost the blessing, which contained in it many
worldly privileges, it is said, that he wept for very sorrow, and yet Heb.
12.17
found he no place to repentance.

The Holy Ghost (therefore) lays the foundation of this mourning more deep,
and fetches it from a further fountain, which is the meditation of this* that
they had so misdemeaned themselves, that they had not only purchased worldly
misery and desolation to fall upon them, but (which was much more grievous to
think of) the anger, wrath, and deep displeasure of that GOD, of whose love,
liberality, and protection, they had had so manifold experience, which is
diligently to be marked, and to be meditated of by every one of us in the like
case. For albeit it be a gre^uous thing to be punished with any misery in
this life, as sickness, poverty, disgrace, or any such like. Yet we
remaining in the favor of GOD, these things can not greatly hurt us, but when
it comes to pass, that these, and whatsoever else light upon us, proceed
from the Lords wrath and displeasure. Where then shall we have any comfort?
Of whom shall we be relieved? And what means can we find out whereby we
may be helped? Surely none, for all good things come from him, and all places
are in his presence, we ca^ neither in death nor in life hide us from the
fierceness of his wrath. And therefore of all things that may grieve us, this
must sit nearest unto us, that we do any way displease his Majesty, whose
goodness we have so much tasted of, and whose heavy hand is every way so
intolerable: and surely, the repentance of the godly, is in this point
especially discerned from that of the wicked, for whereas they are drawn to
repentance by the loss of some carnal pleasure and worldly profit, the
godly are induced thereunto by this, that they have wandered from him, in whom
their chief felicity consists, but because the heart of man is full of
subtlety, and (this being a principal ground of true religion) Satan does
easily deceive manne, persuading him, that he mourns aright, when (indeed)
it is nothing so, we are to know that the true lamentation which is that not
to be lamented for, approoueth it self, both unto the Lord, our own hearts,
and unto others, by two such infallible effects, as will be able to clear and
justify the same against all adversaries whatsoever, and those be, first an
unfeigned and hearty loathing of that former estate which procured the anger of
God against us, and a turning of it into a better, that is, a serious and
earnest endeavor to practice those virtues, which are most contrary unto our
former transgressions: and without this, we plainly declare our selves
either not to mourn, or to do it with Esaus affecction, which shall profit
us nothing, but to increase our punishment in more clear and evident
condemnation.

Again, in that the Prophet having showed the miseries of the land, and after
going about to teach them how to redress them, persuades the people unto
repentance, we learn: that whenever the Lord has conceived a displeasure
against any nation, or any particular congregation, or person, the only way
to be reconciled again, and to return into his favor, The only true way
to be rid of any misery.
is true and unfeigned repentance, or whenever any be oppressed with the
burden of any affliction, wherewith they are grieved (afflictions being to
us, the punishements of GOD for sin) the only sound remedy against it* and
means to turn it away, is, seeking unto him that smites by humble prayer, in
the anguishe of thy repenting soul. Which doctrine is diligently to be noted:
for as it is the nature of al men when any grief trobleth them, or any danger
hangs over their heads, to endeavor many ways how to be eased, and to use
diverse remedies to prevent the dangers approaching: so is it not in the nature
of any man to go about or find out the right salve for any such kind of sore,
and therefore we see it comes to pass, that some labor to put from
themselves* the sense of sorrow present, or remembrance of dangers imminent
by music, ^^^des, or some other pastime (as they term it) that their minds
being possessed with the vanity present, may be emptied of the grief, which
else should have possessed them* others (persuading themselves to be of
invincible valor) do rest upon their own wisdom, knowledge, or strength, as
on a tower, not able to be overthrown* others betake themselves unto the
politic devises of their worldly wise acquaintance, thinking that to be a
means that must needs prevail: to conclude, all (whose hearts the spirit of
grace has not taught to aspire higher) rest upon the second cause and lean
unto the worldly helps that are to be had under the sun. Whereas (indeed)
they should consider; that all miseries are the punishements of GOD for sin,
and every approaching danger, a messenger of the Lords heavy hand for the
same: and that there is no way to satisfy Gods anger but by repentance: and
therefore that the only true refuge in any distress is to flee unto him in
the grief of our hearts, craving pardon for that which has procured his
heavy countenance against us, and promising (by the assistance of his
gracious spirit) the unfeigned endeavor of the amendment of our ways. But
while these things are not thought upon of many, nor known of more, it comes
to pass* that we are smitten oftentimes, and never feel it, or if we do, yet
conceive we not whose hand it is, what cause thereof is in our selves, nor to
what end we are touched, and so become so far from making the right use of
it, that it rather hardens our hearts, and makes us more careless,
ascribing the same to Nature or Fortune, which we could not wythstande, and
not at all to our sins, Gods judgments denounced must greatly move us to
sorrow.
which we should amend. Lastly, in that they are persuaded by the Prophet
upon the judgments laid open against them, to mourn, we do learn that the
threatening of Gods judgments against sin by the ministry of his servants,
is not lightly to be regarded, or easily to be passed over, but so to be
applied unto our own hearts, as that the consideration of them do effect us
in such manner, that it may work in us a sorrowing of heart, and mourning of
soul, yea though they be such judgments as we our selves (by the mercy of
God) shall be sure to escape, for if our hearts be framed unto that sympathy
and fellow feeling that one member has of another condition, then must the
myseries of our brethren (yea though they be only brethren according to the
flesh) so grieve us, as the meditation thereof do leave that impression of the
grief in us, which may enforce us in the feruencie of our spirits, to power
out our prayers unto the Lord in their behalf: then much rather must we take
heed, that when those threatenings are uttered, whereof we our selves are
guilty, that we be not senseless, and (as the greatest number do) carelessly
let it pass: for those me^ must needs be in a fearful plight, who are not
moved with those things whereat the very diuelles do quake and tremble.

Like a virgin girded, etc. 13.
) To the end that the prophet might enforce this mourning the more effectually,
he urges it by a comparison, that is more familiar, even unto natural men,
which is, that this mourning which they are to take up, in regard of the
miseries that they feel, and are to look for, must not be a slight touch of
heart, easily conceived, and quickly passed away, but it must be like unto
that which the virgin is affected withal, who being be-couched in her youth
unto an husband whom she does dearly love, and settling her affections
upon him above all men in the world, rejoicing in the hope of that society
where in she is to live with him all the days of her life, has him suddenly
taken from her, and all her expectation being dissappointed, she is driven
into an exceeding agony, and grief of mind, which wounds her so woefully,
as any earthly thing, can any man in the world. Now (says the prophet)
this goes very near her, and your misery must as deeply affect you: so
that this being the meaning of the prophet: it remains, that we see what
profitable instructions, this same comparison affords unto us: First albeit
the comparison, be brought to enforce the sorrow of the Israelites, yet the
proportion thereof unto the matter in hand is to be weighed, which also
carries not the least force, in the urging of the thing: for it is an usual
thing in the scriptures, to compare the Lord and his church, Christ the
husband, and we the spouse, what we do learn by it.
unto the husband and the spouse, both in regard of that nearnes which it has
plesed the Lord to make betwixt himself, and her, as also in respect of the
love and liking of the one unto the other: now this comparison does first of
all convict the Israelites of most heinous and horrible ingratitude, for that
the Lord finding them in such woeful case as the prophet Chap. 16.3
Ezechiell does tell us he did, and having advanced them to so high a dignity
as to make them even his own darling, that they should so monstrouslie requite
him with unthankfulness, as to fall from him, and go a wh^^ring after their own
ways: for we all of us easily condemn that wife, who (the husband making
choice of her above all other women) shall refuse him and be take her self to
a stranger, but especially if he being a king, of royal majesty, shall
(finding her no better than a beggars brat*) advance her (...) the estate of a
Queen ^ if she do not love him, reverence him, obey him, and be every way
pliable unto his will, we all of us will easily say that she is unworthy to
live, much more unworthy of that high and glorious dignity: and even so it
fares with us, we profess our selves to be the church of God, and therefore
look to be pertakers in those priueleges which God bestows upon the same,
he found us in the state of damnation, of his own free mercy, he begat us
again by the word of truth, and has set us into the glorious liberty of
the sons of God, joining us in the inheritance with his only son: Now if
we shall by our wicked lives any way stain that glory that he has
bestowed upon us, if our conversation be not every way answerable unto that
thankful love, fear, and obedience which he requires at our hands, then
shall we be found guilty (even our own mouths condemning us) of the most
heinous rebellion, and most horrible ingratitude, that can be committed
amongst the sons of men: And therefore we have great need to look more
circumspectly unto our ways, that our steps be straight in the ways of
Godliness, for the blessings of God (with the embracing of his gospel) are so
many and so great, that if they draw us not to an unfeigned holiness of life,
they shall rise up against us at the day of judgment, as so many witnesses to
justify, and so many just accusers to aggrauat and increase our condemation,
the drift of this comparison, is to urge them unto a deep, and unfeigned
grief of heart for sin, whereby we learn, that we must have it in a high
detestation, loathing and abhorring it in all men, but especially in our
selves, and greeuing at the committing of it in any, laboring by all the good
means we may to stay the streams of it, and where we cannot, to be
grieved at the very heart at it, which lesson, though every one will acknowledge
to be true, yet very few do in any measure put it in execution, but rather
clean contray, making but a test of sin, as though it carried no
inconveniences with it, but the Lord in this place teaches al them that will
be instructed by him out of his blessed word, to have it in more detestation,
and when it is committed, to be more sensibly affected with grief for it,
then for any other thing in the world: the which is further to be learned in
the consideration of this comparison, for when he bids the^ mourn like a
virgin for the husband of her youth, it is as much as if he should say, you
have as great cause to mourn as ever any such virgins have, for you have lost
as great a loss and greater, as any of them can, thereby declaring, that
their disobedience had so ascended into the ears of the Lord of hosts, that
it had procured a Hosa. 2.19.
divorce between him and them: for as the Lord matcheth his church unto him
self in righteousness, and in judgment, and in mercy, and compassion: so when
we fall to iniquity, and forgetting the Lord, fall to do those things that
seem good in our own eyes, then is it the nature of those sins to be Esaias.
59.2.
separate betwixt God and us, and to hide his face that he will not hear: and
therefore, seeing, that it depriueth us of all the blessings of God, and
procures his anger and displeasure against us, what cause have we to bid
battle against it, all the days of our life, and to hate it, above all
things that we hate most, seeing, that it is of that nature, to deprive us of
every good thing, and to wrappe us in all misery and desolation.

The fourth sermon. Verse. 9. The meat offering and the drinke-offering is
cut off from the house of the Lord, the priests the lords ministers mourn.
THe meat offering, etc.) Having showed the sorrow that they were to conceive,
14
in regard of the heavy hand of God upon them, and also the manner how it was
to be increased by the comparison of the virgin mourning for the husband of
her youth, and knowing that this true and unfeigned repentance, is hardly
persuaded unto flesh and blood, because naturally we like not of it, he
proceeds now to lay open the causes, that were yet further to induce them
thereunto: the first whereof consists in the consideration of the miserye
that was upon them in regard of the temple, and the public service of God: for
when he says, The meat offering and drinke-offering is cut off from the
house of the Lord, his meaning is as much as if he should say* have you not
great cause to mourn and lament? seeing that the temple which is your glory
among the nations, and the daily sacrifices wherewith you daily served God
there, shall by reason of the ruin that your foes shall bring upon the land,
be so left desolate and forsaken, that there shall be no resorting thither, with
any meate-effrings and drink-offrings: (...) this woeful state did fall upon
them because of their transgressions, and disobedience unto the word of God,
which teaches unto us this doctrine, that when, or whersoeuer, the publik
profession of the gospel decaieth, or the gifts of the ministry wither away,
From what cause the decay of religion arises.
or the labor of gods servants become fruitles, it arises from the
disobedience and ungodly behavior of the people, it springs from this, that
they for whose instruction ye lord has erected ye ministry of his gospel,
rejecting the food of their souls offered unto them, do acount themselves Act.
13.46.
unworthy of eternal life, which doctrine is diligently to be observed: for it
is now every where the just complaint of all that have any sight into religion:
that the profession of thereof does decaie, the lyking thereof is in so few
men's hearts, that Atheism and popery is in more request every where then true
religion, which is true: again it is the complaint of many, that the word is
not of that power in the mouth of ye ministers thereof* yt it has bin
hertofore, which also is to true.

But where is the fault* no doubt, Satan is not to be excused, that
slaundereth the truth, nor his instruments to be accounted giltlesse, that
could stop the passage of the same: but if we could learn the lesson which the
holy ghost teaches the Israelites in this place, we should say, let us mourn
for that our sins have caused the meat-offeringes and drinke-offeringes to
cease from the house of our God, that is, the passages of true religion to be
stopped, that it floweeth not unto us in such streams as it has done
heretofore, and does at this day unto others, for why should we think that
the sins of the reprobate, ordained to destruction, Not the sins of the
reprobate but of gods people darken the beauty of the gospel.
should any way hinder or further the proceedings of the gospel: for whether
it be taught, or buried in silence, whether it flowrish, or be extinguished,
it is no matter to them: it is therefore the sins of the people of god, that
dammeth up the proceeding of the truth: for even as it was a matter no way
appertaining to the nation which GOD threatens by his prophet to come upon the
land of Israel, whether the lords worship in the temple flourished or no: but
was a thing perticularlie belonging unto the Jews, Gods chosen nation, and it
was not their sins, but the sins of the Israelites, that procured the decaie
thereof: even so it is in the Church of God for ever, the sins of the
ungodly, and those that are without, do never cause the Lord to ouerturne, or
give small success unto his own ordinance, but the transgressions of those who
having received the word of life, do not frame their hearts within, and
conversation without, according to the rule of the same, this made the prophet
Iere. 5.25.
Jeremy to tell them of Judah, that their sins had turned away Gods blessings,
and their transgressions turned good things from them, the Propet Isaiah
like-wise tells them Isa. 59.14.
that their sins were the cause, that judgment was turned backward, and
justice stood a far off, that truth was fallen in the streets, and equity
could not enter. And therefore, let us never post the fault over to any
other, as Adam did unto Eu^^, if any thing be not as it should be, but let us
lay the fault where it is, to wit, in our own sins: for assuredly, if we
could in the unrighteousness of our hearts, consent together amongst our
selves, A necessary thing to be observed,
and with one accord seek the advancement of Gods glory. First in our
selves, and then in others: What wicked man? what Pope? What Devil should be
able to withstand us? and therefore have we just cause to mourn when we see
the preaching of the Gospel cut off from the people, and the power thereof
lessened that it conuerteth not where it is preached, seeing that our own
sins be the cause of al these, with many more abominations: For the zeal
of the people to receive and practice the truth, does open the mouth, enlarge
the heart, and furnish the minister of GOD with graces in great abundance,
that may make his word more powerful unto them: whereas on the other side,
their sins, and cold attendance thereunto, do freeze his affections, and
stop his mouth, that he cannot speak unto them with that majesty, that so
glorious a message requires. Again, by this sequel following, upon the
wars in Israel, that the daily offerings should be cut off, we learn,
that of all the troubles, and afflictions that befall unto the Church of GOD,
wars be the greatest enemy unto the public profession of religion: Why
wars be so great a so to religion.
for though it be true, that as all other trialls, so this makes the godly
more fervent* and stirs them up to more feeling then they had in the
time of their prosperity and peace, yet, such is the contradiction betwixt
wars and the open profession of religion, that they do hardly stand
together, but especialie if the enemies thereof prevail, then prove they the
bane of it, and though they do not, yet such is the hurt that it receives
thereby, as it is long before it recover the former condition: For a good
course being once interrupted, is hardly renewed: So many hynderaunces can
Satan invent, and so ready is our nature to take up every let, and
allege it for an excuse, besides that, because it is the nature of man: first
to provide for his own 2. Sam. 7.2.
steeled house, though the Ark of GOD dwell between the curtains, that is,
to have greater care of his private estate: then of the public benefit of
others, especially in matters of Religion: and yet when troubles arise in a
nation, the first thing that is discontinued, is Religion: Therefore it is,
that Wars be so great an enemy thereunto: Then it should follow of the
contrary, that peace should begette the most perfect building of the kingdoome
of Christ, and so should we be the most glorious that way: but alas,
though it should be so, yet it is fallen out clean contrary, for we have
employed our selves in this time of our quietness to build our selves strong
in sin, and to fortify our hearts against the entrance of any good thing,
so that in stead of the grapes, that our vine being so dressed should have
brought forth, we have yielded sower Isay. 5.1.
grapes, and such as causes the Lord to threaten the casting down of the
hedge, the overthrow of the wine press, and the utter ruin of the whole
vineyard: how much better had it been for us (if God had so been pleased) if
we had been left with the rest of our breathren, and good neighbors round
about us, unto the wind and wether, that our faith might the more have been
purged, and our zeal made more fervent: and not placed in this settled
security (as a standing people) which gathers unto it, and reteineth all
kind of filth and corruption: let us now consider (a little) the reason which
the Prophet uses, to see whether it be of force sufficient to persuade them
to mourn, and it may seem that it is not: for the meat-offeringes and
drinke-offeringes that were brought into the temple, were either consecrated
unto the fire, or (for the most part) allotted unto the priests, and therefore
this reason seems to reach no further then only unto them, that were to
minister in the temple, because their livings did decaie: but we must note,
that he means not only that they should mourn because their ministers
lacked living, (albeit, even that is a just cause, for the people of God to
mourn) but especially he had regard unto the exercise of the ministry in
the temple, which concerned both the glory of God, and the salvation of their
own souls, and then the reason is in effect thus much: there is great cause
you should mourn, seeing not only, the means whereby your souls have been
fed, is taken away, but also the manner how the honor of God has bin made more
glorious among you then in any other nation under the sun. And surely the
reason (unto all those that have any sparkle of grace in them) is very
forcible, for seeing it is evident by many places of the scripture, that the
principal end of our creation, is, that we might with all possible endeavor,
set forth the glory of God, it must follow that when he is glorified by us in
deed, we must rejoice above all other things whereof we may take pleasure in
this world: again, the principal end of our creation, and redemption (in
respect of our selves) being the salvation of our souls, when the means to
draw us thereunto be (by the the mercy of God) bestowed upon us, it ought
to affect our hearts with more gladness, then any other thing that can befall
unto us: but when it shall come to pass, that the passage for both these
shall be stopped up, that is, that the greatest help for the advancement of his
glory, and the attaining unto the salvation of our souls, is taken away: what
cause have we then, to take delight in any thing under the sun, but even to
wish that our eyes may be made a fountain of tears, that we may thoroughly
bewail our miserable estate, Ierem. 9.1.
and so pass out our time in lamentation and sorrow. There is no question,
unto the^ that see any thing, whether the public ministry of the gospel
in the purity and sincerity thereof, be this principal means whereof we
speak* and therefore we are to make this use of this doctrine unto our selves,
that whenever the Lord shall remove, or threaten to extinguish the same, it
being the chief thing that we can enjoy in this life, and our sins being the
only cause of the removing of the same, it must sit (of all other things) most
near unto us, and draw our hearts unto the greatest sorrow: and (doubtless) it
dies so in them that have received any feeling of the sweetness of the same:
for they know what heavenly consolations are to be learned out of it, and in
what woeful case they be that are deprived of it.

What miserable condition be they then in, that are so far from taking this
course, or being of this mind, that they bend all their powers both of their
minds and bodies, to extinguish and race out of memory, that inestimable
treasure of Gods holy word, and never think themselves in good estate,
until they have defaced the same? surely if the aduauncemente of it be an
argument of a care to honor GOD, and to have thine own soul saved, then the
disanullinge, or desiring the overthrow thereof, is a fearful token, that
thou neither carest for the glory of God, nor the salvation of thine own
soul, but rather (for that thou set thy self against the means of them
both) art a professed enemy both to God and thine own salvation. If those
that are such enemies unto the preaching of the word, were persuaded, that this
were true of them, they would look more carefully about them, weying in what
state they stand, but while they go on in the contempt of all instrucion, and
consider not that they contemn the Lord of hosts, and destroy their own
souls, it comes to pass, that they pass on blindfold unto their own
destruction.

The Priests the Lords ministers do mourn) these words contain in them a
second reason to persuade them to mourn, which is thus: there is great cause
that you should all mourn and lament, seeing they whom I have made your
guydes, in the matters of religion, who know more then you do, and who are to
have that estimation among you, which becomes messengers of so great affayers
from so mighty a prince, Gods people must frame their affections unto the good
example of their ministers.
do go heavily, and take up a lamentation, out of which reason, ye prophet does
teach unto us this lesson, that the ministers of ye land, whom he has placed
over a people, are by the same people diligently to be observed, and their
affections to be imitated by those whom they are sent to instruct, for in this
reason ye Lord says unto them mourn you, because the Lords Ministers do
mourn, as if he should say, mark them well that I have set over you: and in
all things that are not unlawful, frame your selves according unto them, the
reason of the same is this: God appointing his minister to be his own mouth
unto his people, reuealeth unto him all that his will, which he would have
them to know. And again, he being a watchman unto the people, stands aloft
in the tower, and espieth a far off the enemies that are a coming and giving
the people a sign thereof, they receive it, and demean themselves accordingly,
or else are worthily set upon by their enemies of a sudden, and overthrown: so
that the minister knowing more than the people of the will of GOD, and seeing
the judgments of GOD approaching, when the people (otherwise very godly) can
not deserve them, it is meet that they so observe his course, as if he take up
a mourning, it is because of the evil that he sees approaching upon them, and
therefore they are to mourn also, to the end, that by their unfeigned joining
together in repentance, they may meet the Lord by the way, and prevent his
judgments, that else should have light upon them. Again, in that he
wills them to mourn because the Lords Ministers do so: The people may
fear, that give their Minister cause of grief.
we do learn that that people among whom the Minister of GOD has cause given
to be grieved, have just cause to be grieved themselves, whether it do arise
from that badde entertainment that he has among them, or from that careless
attendaunce that they give unto the doctrine of the truth taught them by him,
in both which respects our Savior Christ shows the causes: for in regard
of the person he says: Luke 10.16.
He that refuses you refuses me, as if he should say, that
entertainment which they give to you, who represent my person unto them, I
take to be given unto my self, and neither more nor less. And in respect of
the doctrine he says: Math 10.11.
When you enter into a house, abide there, and if the son of peace be there,
your peace shall abide with him, but if not, it shall return unto you again:
and whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart
thence, shake off the dust of your feet. Surely, I say unto you, it shall be
easier for them of the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than
for that city. The reasons then are thus to be gathered, they that give Gods
Minister cause of grief among them, do it either in the evil entreating of
his person, or rejecting of his doctrine: but if they receive not his person
with the entertainment due to the messenger of god, they refuse Jesus Christ,
and if they refuse his doctrine, the dust of his feet that brought unto them
glad tidings of peace, Roma. 10.15
shall be a witness against them.

And therefore have that people, who by either of these means make GODS
Minister heavy hearted just cause to sorrow, for that the misery which
greeueth him shall one day light upon them. If this were considered, and the
truth thereof persuaded unto our consciences, could we (think you) offer
unto them that villainy which we do, by slanders, reproaches, disgraces, and
all kind of molestations? Could we suffer them to live amongst us like
beggars for want of maintenance, while they 2. Cor. 6.10
make us rich with the heavenly treasure of Gods holy word? No, no, it would
make us so affected to them, as the Galathians were to saint Paul, who Gal.
14.13.
if it had been possible would have plucked out their own eyes, to have given
them unto him: it would make us learn, Galat. 6.6.
that he who is instructed in the word, should make him that teaches him
partaker of all his goods: or could we (think you) make a mart of the
doctrine taught by them, refusing to give it the hearing? Or if we do determine
before hand, not to believe it, saving so far as it pleases our humor, no
it is not possible, but rather it would make us, with all zealous care attend
unto the voice of God speaking to us by them: pray to God continually, to
teach us the understanding of the same, and to endeavor unfeignedly to put in
execution whatsoever appears unto us to be enjoined from the mouth of the
Lord. I am persuaded, that among many our sins that cry to the Lord for
vengeance upon us, this is not the least, that the true Ministers of God, and
indeed the doctrine of the truth taught by them, have so many snubs, and
discouragements: and on the other side, they that prophecy unto us of wine and
strong drink, and speak unto us pleasant things, are had in such estimation,
and their lying vanities so highly regarded: wherein is truly performed that
evil that Solomon saw Eccle. 10.6
in his time, that folly is set in great excellency and the rich set in low
place. Well, the land has cause to mourn that gives the Ministers of God
occasion of sadness.

The field is wasted) In these words the Prophet shows yet an other reason
to induce them unto mourning, 15.
which is annexed unto the former, as a thing, though (in it self) not
greater, yet by reason of man's corruption, who feels the wantes of his body
sooner than of his foul, it is that which would more sensibly be felt, in
which words he reasons thus: Albeit neither the decay of religion, nor the
sorrow of Gods Ministers do move you to mourn, yet (if you do look well
into your estate) there is a misery coming upon you, which will touch you
very nearly, and that is, your fruitful and pleasant fields, shall be so
laid waste, that even the very ground shall mourn and lament, to see her
increase so consumed, for the corn, the wine, and the oil (which are the
chief yield in the land, and the fruits which, you stand in greatest need
of) perish and come to nothing. Out of which we learn first this lesson,
that those whom neither the care of Gods glory by the flourishing of true
religion, If Gods word move us not, he will touch us in that which will move
us.
nor the salvation of their own Souls, by the preaching of the truth, will
any thing move at all, are yet (often) by the just judgment of GOD, brought
unto the sense and feeling of their misery by the remoouing of those things,
that their affections are most settled upon: the which, (if we look into the
word of God) is manifest unto us by diverse exampls, Ge. 4.6 14.
Cain that wicked murderer, when he would neither be moved with the voice of
GOD speaking to him from heaven, nor the innocence of his brother, justified
unto him, to refrain from his devilish purpose: the Lord set a mark of
such ignominy upon him, as made him even by his guilty conscience think that
all men abhorred him. All the wicked (of whom we read from the beginning to
the ending of the book of GOD) have ever rejected the word of truth, that
they might with more free liberty delight in the pleasures of sin: but the
LORD, has ever in the end, either removed from them those things which
possessed their minds, and kept them from Godliness, or (which is more)
inflycted upon them the earnest of his eternal displeasure: the which is
diligently to be noted, (that we may make our profit of it) for if we
could learn it, and be truly persuaded of it, we should hear with more
reverence, and obey with greater obedience, the holy word of the Lord our
GOD. What is the cause that makes men so lightly to esteem, The cause that
so few do truly embrace the word of god
that heavenly course of life which the Gospel propounds unto us, but only
this: that through the corruption of their own hearts, and seducementes of
Satan: They have framed unto themselves, some course of life, and promised to
their own hearts some present blessedness, which can not stand with the
practice of sincere Godliness: Now if this could be driven into their
heads, that there is nothing wherein we can have any safetye or true
happiness, when the word of the Lord is disobeyed, it would make them above
all things seek unto it, that they might learn out of the same, that true
and unfeigned atonement with God, whereby the lawful fruition and delight in
the things of this life, might be possessed by them with more peace: but
whilst they never once intertaine any such cogitation, but rather, on the
contrary part think, ye religion brings with it these and these
inconveniences, depriueth of such and such commodities, and abandoneth many of
those pleasures that they cannot leave, it comes to pass that they are so
far from thinking well of godliness, as they bid battle unto it, as if it
were their greatest foe, to the end (as they falsely persuade themselves) that
they may be the more safe in their sinful purpose. But (poor souls) if they
could learn, or be persuaded of that which both Gods word, and daily
experience lays before our eyes, that the Lord will be sure to cross that
course which is any way taken in hand, to the impairing of his glory, (yea
which hinders us from being grieved at it when other impare it) they would
always labor to learn that lesson taught by our Savior Christ, Math. 6.33.
first seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and then all these
things shall be ministered unto you. Again, in that the Prophet presently upon
the overthrow of religion does speak of the misery of the land, as a present
sequel upon the former, we learn, that wheresoever the honor of God in the
building of his church, by the ministry of his word decaieth, or is
hindered, Religion being ouerthrown, the commonwealth cannot stand long.
there does follow desolation and misery to that commonwealth. For seeing
that the glory of God is the end for which he has ordained people to be ruled
by magistrates, which glory is no way advanced but by the gospel. And seeing
that the Lord says plainly, Prou. 8.15.
that kings reign by him, and it is he that Esaias 45.7.
gives peace and makes war, sends plenty, and pincheth with penury: to
conclude, seeing that God ordained, that even Esaias 49.23*
kings should be foster fathers, and queens nursing mothers unto the church of
God, and therefore commanded them Psalm. 2.12.
to kiss his son Jesus Christ, least he waxing angry, they perish in the way it
must needs be that that commonwealth which is founded upon any other
groundwork, than only true religion, must needs come to ruin and desolation*
which doctrine is diligently to be observed, especially in these our days,
wherein the most blasphemous conclusions, and pestiferous platformes of that
Italian helhound Machiauell, Against Machiauils policy.
are so reputed of and esteemed, that he only is reckoned a right politist,
that frames his course after his rules, and who so does not iumpe with him, is
esteemed no man of state, (as they be termed) nor worthy to rule in the
lowest place of any government: and yet does he esteem as much of religion,
as of Aesopes fables: whereupon it comes that one chief principle with the
Machiauilites is Athisme, or refusal of all religion further then may serve
their turns, for the better effecting of their practices. And whereas it may
be said, that many commonwealths have flourished, whose law-giuers never
knew God, as the Lacedemonian, Grecian, and Roman, gouernements: I answer,
that for a time, they did seem to be glorious, and quickly vanished away: but
(indeed) there was no such matter in them, for not every government, The right
flourishing of a common-welth.
whose Princes are victorers, and greatly honored of men, is flourishing (for
then should the popedom, then which none was ever more tyrannical, be
reckoned in the same rank) but that is truly to be so esteemed, whose subjects
in general, and particular do enjoy the benefit thereof, as well as their nobles
and princes, but he that marketh well, shall see that the most flourishing state
that can be without the advancement of true religion, though it have many
outward titles of glory in the face of men, yet does it gall ye hearts, and
grieve the souls of the best people, that live under the fame, and shall in the
end (albeit God may suffer it to grow for a time) bring in utter hauock and
miserable confusion: the which we see also verified in particular men, for
many seem in most nottable manner, to grow great in this life, some in
honor, some in riches, some in one preferment, some in another, the
foot-steppes of whose excellency (if you look into their posterity) are
scarce to be found: Now from what ground shall we say that this did arise,
but even hence, that the foundation was not laid in the Lord, the kingdoome
of GOD was not first sought and conscience grounded upon true Religion, did
not direct the^ in the course which they took, but they would seem to grow
great, whether the Lord would or no, and therefore in the continuance of
their building, he lets them see their own folly at the beginning.

The use then of all this which is said, (if we have any care to profit by
religion in deed) is first in general for whole peoples, nations, and
kingdoms, that if ever they look to have such a settled estate as shall be
immovable, then must they build it upon mount Sion, that is, they must lay
the first stone of the foundation in true religion, by the sincere
establishment of the same, for god cannot away with that building, whose
arch-piller and corner stone his son Christ Jesus is not: and secondly, it is
for the instruction of every particular man, that seeing we do all desire our
own good, and the benefit of our posterity, that we have this care above
all things, that we advance true religion in our own hearts, and in the
hearts of our children, making it the principal care that we have, and then
in all other things to go no further than the rules thereof will permit us,
either in the matter that we take in hand, or in the manner how we do it,
which is, the only way that the Lord prescribed to the Israelites for their
Deu. 10.13 Iere. 32.39.
wealth and good of their posterity after them. If this lesson were learned,
it would make these greedy and covetous worldlinges that think the time
spent ill which is bestowed in the hearing and learning of the word of GOD,
more careful to attend upon the same: but while they esteem Religion a
needelesse thing, and think they shall do well enough, though they never look
into it, (all one in effect, as if they should think to do well enough
whether GOD will or no) it comes to pass, that they prospering for a time,
receive that success, which such ungodly proceedings do justly deserve.

Be ye ashamed O ye husbandmen) The Prophet having persuaded them unto
lamentation for their miseries, 16.
and enforced the same by diverse effectual reasons, because that it is a
hard matter to frame the heart of man unto that true repentance, which is
required at his hand: he enters now into a more narrow way, and applies
his speeches which before were general, unto particular estates: and first
he begins with the husbandman, laying before his eyes the particular
miseries that he should feel.

Now in that the Prophet having laid open their misery so plainly, as none
could exempt him self, but every one must needs be touched, does yet
notwithstanding enter into a more particular application. Application of
doctrine is very needful.
We are to consider what should be the cause thereof, for we may not think that
it was for lack of other matter (as the wicked think of Gods Ministers in the
like case) nor, that the people were well enough taught that point before, for
then had he spoken in vain: but it was (doubtless) to teach them, and us,
and all the godly for ever, that it is meet and convenient, if we look for
any profit by the ministry of Gods word, or would have his Ministers deal
substantiallye with us for our good, that not only they tell us the truth in
general, but also apply it so neerelie unto us, that every one of us have no
way to shift the doctrine from being specially spoken to our selves, for such
is the backwardnes of our nature, and unwillingness to make aplication unto our
selves, that if we can find any starting-holes, or any shifts to remove it
from us, it shall take no hold on us, to do us any good.

Whereupon it comes to pass (as we see by daily experience) that whenever
we hear any sin reproved in general terms, or the judgments of God
denounced against the same, we are very ready to apply it unto others, and
to say, he means by such a one, or this was a good lesson for such and such
people (albeit he be as nearly touching himself) never entering into his own
heart, to make use of it for his proper instruction: the Lord therefore knowing
our wants this way, and (in his mercy) intending unfeignedly our good, has
provided a remedy against the same, in the ministry of his servant,
putting not only his word in their mouths to deliver unto his people, but
also giving them the word of wisdom, whereby they may apply it according to
the circumstaunces of time, place, and person, unto every estate and
condition, to the end, that either they might be soundly brought home unto
him, or else al color of excuse might be taken away from them.

Again, in this application the Prophet names one kind of people, and
leaves the rest, because it were very tedious to write every particular
calling: but the cause why (of all the commonwealth) he names the husbandmen
may seem to be this, for that they might persuade themselves to be furthest
from that miserye which he had spoken of, because that (if any fruit of the
earth at all were to be had) they being the owners thereof, would first serve
themselves, and therefore might (as flesh and blood would easilye teach
them) say, let them mourn that want, for we are likest to shift of all
others, seeinge they can have nothing but our reuersion and leauinges: to the
end that they might also put that in practice which (from the mouth of the
Lord (he had enjoined unto all, he speaks unto them by name, whereby we
learn first this lesson, that those, who having greater abundance then others
in time of a common calamity, They that are not moved with the misery of
others, shall be brought to feel it themselves.
do labor only to provide for themselves, and are careless and hard
hearted to them that are in need, the Lord will increase that punishment
until it take hold also upon them, or else send some other, which they shall be
sure to have their part in with ye depest, which lesson is worthy to be
learned, for it is to common a thing with men, that the greatest provide only
for them selves, and every man (as the saying is) to see to one, in the mean
while little care is had over them that cannot see to them selves, yea I
appeal unto every man's conscience, whether (in this time of scarcity) he
has not had this cogitation often, in his head: I hope I shall provide for my
self, and mine own family: I trust I shall have sufficient for mine own
turn, and then I care not: but if we would learn the right use of this
doctrine, we must say in such a case, GOD has straightned his hand among us,
partly to see how we of more wealth will open ours to them that need, and
partly to see how careful we will be to make the best, for many, of that
which is in the possession of a few, and therefore are we carefully to advise
how we may remedy that want which is among us, and not (as is the manner of the
most) make the dearest times serve our turns best, and seek to grow rich by
the miseries of many, for if we do so, we shall hear such a voice as GOD
utters unto this people: that he will send a punishment that shall be sure to
touch us, because we had no remorse nor pity over the want of our pore
brethren: Those shall soonest be punished that least look for it.
Secondly it teaches unto us this lesson, that when the Lord means to
punish a nation, he will not (of all other) suffer them to escape, that
pretend most privileges to exempte them selves from the same, as for example,
in this case of the Jews general hauock is threatened to all, but by name,
unto the husbandmen, who might have many things to say for them selves: but
(if you note it well) it falls out to be especialy grievous unto such by the
just judgment of God, for when the Lord sent famine upon the land, (no doubt)
there were many among them that being of more wealth then others, were hard
hearted toward them, now the second punishment coming to move them, whom
the former could not, of all other it must needs lay hold upon them, and surely
this fitteth us in these our days merueilous well, for if yt should ensue, this
want of bread, which was threatened to come upon the Israelites, should the
rych (think you) whose hearts are pyttilesse to their brethren be spared? no,
no, the hungry soldier, that fights for the spoil, will be sure (of all
other) to ransacke him, because there is more hope of booty, then with the
poor man that is in extremity, and then may the rich man say that against
himself, which he would never believe before: this is gods just judgment
upon me, for my hard heart against the needy, that because I had no care to
let him have something of that which GOD has given me in plentiful manner,
when he was driven into exstremitie: he has justly sent upon me these
spoilers, who shall have no pity over me, and therefore let us be careful
to demean our selves religiously in this time of the Lords gentle warning*
least we provoking his Majesty unto displeasure, purchase unto our selves,
those judgments that shall lie more heavily upon us. The thing that he
wills them to do, is, that they should be ashamed, that is, by reason of
their sins and transgressions, to account them selves unworthy the name of men,
and (as it were) to hide their faces before the creatures of God: whereby the
Prophet teaches us, how greatly we should be grieved with our selves, and
mislike our condition when we consider of the sins and rebellions that we
commit against the Lord, for you know that the thing whereof man is ashamed,
does greatly move him unto an inward condemnation of that which he has done:
but (alas) sinfulnes through custom, Mo be ashamed of godliness then of sin.
has put on such a brazen face, and godliness by discontinuance is so strange
among us, that it is an easy thing to find him that will be ashamed of weldoing,
and bear out all manner of ungodliness with a bold countenance, and hard to
find him that is ashamed of sin, blushing at the committing thereof, and
contrariwise, follows after truth and righteousness with a bold face, and an
invincible courage.

The reason why the prophet persuades them hereunto, 17
is set down in the words following, to wit, because the harvest of the
field is perished: the vine is dried up, Ill success in our calling must draw
us to repentance.
etc. Generally, because they had so ill success in their callings, whereby we
learn this lesson, that whenever we do carefully employe our selves in the
discharge of our duty in that calling, wherein the Lord has set us, and we see
little fruit redound unto us from the same, we have just cause to howl and be
ashamed, because that our sins have stepped between the Lord and us, to
keep from us his blessing upon our labors, which doctrine is needful to be
learned in every condition, for if we, that are the ministers of the word,
could be persuaded, that ye not profiting of our people is because of our
sins, if the Magistrate could believe that the rebellion and unruliness of his
subjects, were the fruit of Gods anger against him for his offenses: if masters
and Parents could be persuaded that the unfaithfulness of their servants, and
ungraciousness of their children were a punishment from God for their
transgressions. To conclude, if he that goes backwarde, in the world, could
think that God punishes him therewith for his carelessness in godliness, it
would make every one of us more religious and godly, and to lessen the
kingdom of sin within us daily more and more. The cause which the Prophet
alleges is, (as you see) set down in very many words, The necessity of
urging the word in teaching.
all which do signify one thing in effect, and might (as before) have been
expressed in one short sentence, but the Prophet knowing how hard a thing it
was to make them believe that they should so be deprived of their
commodities, does not only tell it unto them, but also urge, and (as it were)
in force it unto them, that they might with the more sense and feeling be
affected with the same, which teaches unto us, how necessary a thing it is,
for us, not only to have the truth of Gods word told in plain and clear
terms, but also urged, enlarged, and stood upon to the end, that our hearts
which are dull, may by little and little, receive impression with the same, and
be the more throwly conformed to the liking of it, and therefore it is, that
the holy ghost requires in a minister, to be instaunt in season and out of
seson, to improve, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering, and doctrine, for we
see that the capacitye of man is so narrow, that oftentimes he gainsaying a
good thing propounded generally unto him, which afterward being laid open, and
enlarged by the causes, commodities and circumstances thereof, he imbraceth with
great liking, to the end that we may learn to like of and embrace: the
necessitye of those continual discourses, whereby the word of God is persuaded
unto our consciences, and not (as is the manner of many) to contemn and despise
them. Lastly, the prophet having laid open this matter by his particulars,
concludes it with an epiphoneme, or general sentence, saying: surely ye joy
is withered away from the sons of men, that is, the thing wherein the sons
of men use to rejoice, the which the Prophet does not only term by the name of
joy, because men so rely of it, but also, because the Lord has allowed us
so to use them as we may rejoice therein, for that they are the blessings of
God bestowed upon us, for our necessity and delight, yet so, as it be with
these conditions, first, that our greatest and chief pleasure be in the
meditation, With what conditions we may rejoice in the things of this life.
and practice of the law of God: secondly, that our hearts be purified by faith
in Christ, for the^ are all things clean unto us: thirdly, that we do rejoice
in them to the end to make us more fit to joy in the Lord, who is the giver of
them, if these things be not observed, not only our reioycinge in the
things of this life is unlawful in us, and sinful unto us, but also, even
the ver^e use thereof for our necessity, shall turn to our condemnation.

The fifth sermon. verse 13. to the end* 13 Gird your selves and lament, ye
priests: howl ye ministers of the altar come, and lie al night in sackcloth,
ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering, and the drink offering is taken
away from the House of your God. etc.
GIrde your selves, O ye priests) the Prophet having spoken before in
particular unto the husbandmen, 18
does now continue his former course of application unto an other sort of
men, and that is, to the priests of the Temple, that attended upon the daily
sacrifices, and were the Lords ministers, and before that he show them what
they are to do, in public to the Lord, in the name of all the people, he
teaches them, the things that concern themselves in private, and which may
the better prepare them unto that public action: saying, Gird your selves, etc
as if he should say, seeinge that this misery comes upon the whole land, and
seeing that you have the places of the Lords remembrancers, to put him in
mind of his covenant unto Abraham, Esai. 62.6.
and his mercy to his church, it behooves you not to think lightly, or
carelessly of these things, but with such grief and sorrow to conceive
them, as may enforce you to all outward signs of the same, that your example
may draw the people on unto the like humiliation and repentance: The ministers
must give al good example unto their flocks.
which speech of the Prophet does teach unto us, first this lesson, that the
ministers of the word of God (for so much as they are to guide the people in
the ways of knowledge, and to persuade the^ to the observation of those things
which they teach them out of the word) and for so much as they be like unto
the City set on a hill, that is, Math. 5.14
looked unto far and near, whose behavior is (often) regarded, as much (if
not more, as their doctrine) must not only in general have a care and
regard, that their behavior be agreeable to their speches, but yt also as the
knowledge of the will of God, is first reueyled unto them, and by their
ministry unto the people, so they may be the first, and most forward in the
execution of every good duty of Christianitye, to the end, that it may
appear that they teach others no course of life, but that which they
themselves do^e with all carfulness walk in. And surely, how so ever it
be true, that the ill life of the minister is no sufficient cause to make any
man give less obedience unto the doctrine, then is meet, for that they
sittinge in Moses his chair, Math. 23.2.
we are to do as they say, and not as they do: when they say well, and do
not accordingly, yet (whosoever looks into the experience thereof) shall see,
that such as do as well in their holy behavior, as wholesome doctrine
preach unto their people, be the only ministers, whose labors are found
fruitful: and on the otherside, they that have not this care, are seen to
labor (if yet they labor at all) with little or small profit to them that
hear them.

For the simple people (yea, and those that think themselves no fools also)
when they hear any doctrine delivered unto them, that seems not to agree
with flesh and blood, do by and by say: but will he do as he says, if it
appear by any of his disorders, that he does not, forthwith they say: why
should we believe him, or do as he tells us, when he does clean contrary
himself, with out doubt, that which he says, is but for fashion sake, for
he knows some nearer way to heaven then he tells us (for else he would
not do clean contrary) and therefore we will venture as well as he. I know
(beloved) that the ministers of God, whose life is no way to be reproved of
men, are often charged to be such: but it is not of them that I speak, it is
too true, that the complaint is most just of many, whose behauior (though they
can speak never so smoothly in their pretenced eloquence) does sow more seeds
of atheism in one year, then their doctrine will root out in their whole life:
and so much the greter cause have we to lament our condition, that (being
plunged in so many miseries) have so few to be found among a great number, that
may faithfully go before us in the practice of ye course, which may lead to
the preventing of gods just judgment against us. In that the ministers are
willed to gyrd them selves, the Prophet uses a borrowed speech, from the
behavior of the body in the businesses of this life unto that which
concerns the life to come. For it was the manner (as many places of scripture
teach us) of the Jews and other the people of the East countries, to go in
long garmences, which (when they were to do any labor of importance) they did
gird up, to the end that they might no way be hindered, but might perform
the same, with more readiness, and more effectually. Now the prophet by this
kind of speech, does teach the ministers, first, that they employ themselves
in the execution of those means that may turn away the judgments of God
from the people with all expedition, and teaches us this lesson, that
whatsoever the Lord commands us out of his word, We may not put off from
day to day.
we take heed, of deferring or putting of from day to day, (for that the
wrath of the Lord comes of a sudden) and with all speedines, endeavor to do
the same, not consulting with flesh and blood, but propounding before our eyes
the authority of him that commands, and the punishments which do abide the
transgressi^ours, and disobedient. Secondly, (in this kind of speech) he
wills the Priests, the Lords ministers to lay aside all lettes and
impediments that might any way keep them from, or make them cold in the
perfourmaunce of this duty: whereby we learn, We must carefully avoid al
lets unto godliness.
that the Lord our God, does not only require at our hands (in a general
sort) that we do his will, but also that we do wax wise by observation, and
diligently mark by experience, what things they be that are any way a
hinderance unto us in the discharge of that duty that we owe unto God, and
carefully to use al those means that may direct us to avoid them, which is a
lesson that is very needful to be learned of every Christian, and (being
rightly used) shall greatly increase us in true spiritual wisdom and
holiness, for in this regard it is, that christians are called soldiers not
only that they may fight against the enemies of their souls, but also, that
by experience, they may wax wise and spirituallie polliticke, to observe
diligently wherein it is that they be most overtaken, and carefully to
fortify them selves there, not only by strengthening their spiritual
armor, but also by lessening the power of the old man, in taking away all
those allurements, or baytes that he has fed him self upon, to fight
against the soul. He wills them to lament, which is that earnest grief
which is conceived in the heart by the lively sense of any misery. And this
is not only enjoined unto them, as they are a part of the people, and
therefore subject to the general punishment, but especially, for that they
being the ministers of GOD, to stand (as it were in the gappe) between God
and his people, to entreat the Lord for them, and to speak in the name of
all: for which cause it is requisite that the Ministers of God be such as
have an especial sense of the things that the people stand in need of, and
that in more measure then any common Christian, for else shall they never deal
effectually with the LORD for them, nor faithfully with them from him.

Again, He bids them lie in sackcloth, which is also a phrase of speech
expressing the manner of their behavior in the actions of grief and sorrow:
for they were wont in such cases to cover themselves with Sackclothe, that
they might be the more induced unto mourning: the meaning (for the general
equity and truth thereof unto the Godly for ever) is, that as we were
taught out of the word Gird, to remove from us all impediments that may let
us from well-dooing: so in this we learn, We must use al lawful prouocations
and helps to stir us up to godliness.
that we must take unto our selves, all provoking means, whereby we may be
made more fit, and able to discharge our duties the more effectually, the
which is (also) diligently to be observed, for as the nature of man, being
prone to all ill, has (on the one side) many inticements, to draw him from
all goodness, if they be not wisely looked unto: so has it (on the other
side) by reason of the dullness that it is of unto any goodness, need of
many spurs and pricks to stir him up, without which, he shall not
only keep him self from the perfourming of many duties that be required at
his hands, but also freeze and wax cold in that which he has begun: So
that (joining the former and this together) he that determines to beecome a
Christian indeed, and ever looks to attain unto any acceptable measure of
Godliness, or having attained thereunto, to continue therein, unto the end,
must carefully watch to remove all things that he sees may hinder him,
and diligently take up, all those helps which may further him in the same.

The lack of observation whereof, is the cause, that so many in these last and
dangerous days take upon the^ the name of christians with so small reformation,
and that so many shrink away from that good course which at the first they had
begun. It is not only required at their hands, that they do this, but also,
that they lie therein all night, whereby he means to show them, that they
must abide in that kind of humiliation, and not presently to begin and end the
same, teaching unto us this doctrine, that the Lord our God does not only
require at our hands, We must not only begin well, but continue so unto the
end.
only that we begin well, or that we like of good and godly motions for a
time, and after suffer them to be quenched and die, but also that we so begin
that we may continue, and so continue, that it may endure unto the end, which
lesson we have great need to learn, in these declining days, when men do so
generally fall from their first love for we see, that the truth is of such
majesty in it self, that it captiueth the hearts of the very reprobate, unto
the like thereof for a season, but it is (only) as the flashe of a lightning,
that comes and goes (almost) in one moment, but we are to know, that albeit
it be a good thing to begin well, yet it profits us nothing, unless we
continue therein, 2. Tim. 2.5.
for none are crowned but they yt strive aright, and he only that Mat. 24.13
endures to the end shall be saved. In most miserable case then be they that
have set their hand to the Luke 9.62.
plough and look back, that have Revel. 2.4.
lost their first love, and fall away from the sincerity of religion, for our
Savior tells us Mat. 12.45
that the end of such persons is worse than their beginning.

Now least they should take exceptions against him, as one that took too much
upon him, and reproved those that were to reprove him, he calls them, Ye
ministers of my God) wherein first of all, he avouches his authority and
warrant, by virtue whereof he did so instruct them, to show them that in
disobeying his words their offense was not against him, but the Lord.
Secondly, he shows that he does acknowledge them to be the Ministers of God,
and yet does justly show them their duty, teaching unto us, that even the
ministers that are to instruct others when they do amiss, or fail in any
duty, are to be reproved for their fault, and taught how to amend.

As he dealt with the husbandmen, so does he with the priests, that is, 19.
declares them the special cause that is to draw them to lamentation and
mourning, which is, that the meat offering and drinke-offering is taken away
from the house of god: whereby he does first of all teach them, that
for so much as the glory of God in the visible advancement of the same, stood
in this, that the temple had great abundance of sacrifices brought unto it:
now that those offerings were to cease, The abridging of the gospel must
grieve us.
the Ministers of the Lord must so much be grieved therewithal, as the glory
of God is dear unto them. The use of which doctrine (for our instruction) is
this, that as the outward service consisted then in the multitude of
sacrifices, so does it now in the enlargement of the preaching profession,
and practice of the gospel, so that whenever the same is any way abridged
(if we have that zeal of Gods glory that we should) it must drive us unto the
same sorrow that these are commanded to take up in the like case. Again, we
learn by this (comparing it with the cause thereof) that whenever the word of
God, either in the profession or practice of the same has not that free
passage that is meet, the cause thereof rests in the sins of the people, that
profes ye same word according as we heard yesterday delivered unto us more at
large.

Now in that he says (The house of your God) he does not only put them in
mind of their calling from whence it came, and the Judge to whom they must
give account, how they have demeaned themselves in it, The comfort of the
Minister when the people be back ward.
but also (in the general backewardnesse of the people) comfort so many of
them as lay these things to heart, that howsoever they might be discouraged
by the frowardnes of the people, and fear, that God was not therefore pleased
with them, he notwithstanding remained still their God, and reckned of them
according to their faithfulness in their calling, and not after the fruit that
came of it, which he always reserueth in his own hand, to lessen or increase
it, according to his good pleasure. And surely, this lesson is very needful
to be learned in these evil days, of those faithful Ministers that do with
a good conscience discharge their duties: for ye discoragements that we have,
by the carelesnes, and obstinat disobedience of the people to whom our feet
ought to be most beautiful, are many and grievous, Romans 10 15.
the depth whereof is hardly conceived by any, save those that have experience
of them. Now if we should measure al our comfort by the succes that we see our
ministry have in ye world, we should quickly be brought to say with the
Prophet Iere. 20.9.
that we will speak no more in the name of the Lord, but we have a more sure
staff to lean to, which is that whatsoever fruit come of our labors though we
be to all 2. Cor. 2.15
that hear us, the savor of death, yet are we still a sweet smelling savor
unto the Lord, for as it pleased his Majesty to Genesis 18.26
like well of Abraham's entreaty for Sodom, and to accept it as a worship
unto his name, notwithstanding nothing to their profit: so is it his gracious
good will, to accept of the faithful diligence of his servants in the
ministry of his word, though they do not convert one soul, for howsoever
it be, Gods glory shall be advanced thereby, which must be the principal
mark that we are (in all our actions) to aim at.

Sanctify you a fast, etc.) After that he has showed unto them how they are
to behave themselves privately, 20.21.
and to prepare themselves to give the people al good example of forwardness,
he now proceeds to show unto them what they are to do publicly, that the
punishment threatened being general, the whole people might be drawn unto a
solemn repentance. These words (contained in the first of these verses) do
describe unto us, the exercise of a public fast, almost in every circumstaunce
of the same: so that I might have just occasion here to handle the whole
common place of it, which I think not so meet at this present, yet will I
briefly set it down, so far as this present place gives warrant. And first
of al, whereas he wills them to sanctify a fast, What a public fast is.
we are first to consider what this fast is, to the end, that it may the
better appear how it is to be done: briefly therefore it may be thus
described* it is an abstinence commanded of the Lord, thereby to make solemn
profession of our repentance. It is called an abstinence, not as if that were
all and every thing required at our hands in such an action* but because it is
the most noted outward help thereunto: for indeed fasting is no part of the
thing, but only an outward help to draw us the better unto the inward sense
of that unfeigned repentance, which we are to show forth. Now this fasting
is not like that of the Papists, wherein they abstain from some kind of
food, and cram themselves with others: but it is an utter refusal of all the
commodities and pleasures of this life, thereby to make us ye apter to the
inward virtue. And therefore we read, that the godly were accustomed to
refrain from all kind of food, vnttil the evening. Judge. 20.26. Upon what
occasion fasts are to be sanctified.
Secondly, we are to see, when, and upon what occasion this exercise is to be
taken in hand. One, and not the least, the words of our Prophet do show
us, who upon consideration of the misery that they felt, and judgments that
they feared, were commanded to humble themselves before the lord: so that
whenever the Church of God is in any distress, or fears any danger
approaching, it is the duty of the guides thereof, to call them unto this
solemn fasting. Other causes there be of the same, as the electing of
ministers or magistrates, Acts 13.2.
but because they be not in my text, and my purpose is not to handle any more
of the common place than it affords, I will not speak of them. Furthermore,
this being an extraordinary exercise, it is to be considered, whom the Lord
has given the authority unto to proclaim it, some say, that it rests in
the authority of the Magistrate, and some affirm it to be a duty of the
ministers: Whether it belongs to the magistrates or ministers to sanctify a
fast.

2. Cro. 20.3. Jonah. 3.5.


they that lay it upon the magistrate, do allege for their proof the
examples of Iehosaphat, king of Judah, and the king of Niniuie, who both in the
like extremity proclaimed general fasts amongst their people: but they are
answered thus: First, that their particular examples do not prove a general
doctrine in this case, seeing that the commandment of God (as shall appear)
is express on the other side. Secondly, it can not be proved, that
Iehosaphat (for the other was a heathen king, whose example can prove nothing)
did any more in that action, than both he might and was commanded to do
in every part of religion, and, that is, to proclaim and by his authority to
compel them to whom the Church matters appertained to do their duties
faithfully, and therefore it is, that the Holie-ghost in that place, (and also
in that of Jonah) uses a word far different from this in this place: for
there the word signifies to call or send forth, which may in general be
applied unto the promulgation of any edict whatsoever, and here it imports
(as it were) a conseecration, or hallowing withal, which is a thing peculiar
to ye Ministers of the word, so that thus far it belongs to the Magistrate
to see it done, to enioine the doing of it, and (if it please him) to appoint
the time thereof unto the ministers, but that the particular notifieng of it to
ye people belongs unto the ministers of the word it is evident by these
reasons: first, that which the Lord commands out of his word unto the
Ministers of a Church established, the same (unless it be repealed by some
countermaunde) is the office of the Ministers of the word for ever: but the
Lord out of his word commands in this place, the Ministers of the Church
of Israel, which was an established Church, and that under a king, to
sanctify a fast, and call the solemn assembly, therefore it is the duty of
the Ministers of ye word for ever: secondly, yt which cannot be done without
doctrine and public prayer, that same is the office of the Minister: but the
sanctifieng of a fast (that is, the preparing of the people by instruction what
it is, and to what end, and praying unto God to enable them thereunto) can not
be done without doctrine and prayer, 1. Tim. 4.5.
(for every thing is sanctified unto us by the word and prayer) therefore to
call a solemn fast, is the office of the Minister: thirdly, whatsoever
belongs to the public service of God in the congregation, that same is the
proper duty of the Minister, but to sanctify a fast belongs to the public
service of God in the congregation: therefore, it is the proper duty of the
Minister. And that it belongs to the public service of God in the
congregation, it appears by the turning of the reason thus: whatsoever is
required of a Minister in regard of his ministry, that same is a part of the
public service of God: but to sanctify a fast, is required of the priests in
this place, in respect of their ministry, and therefore it is a part of the
public service of God. But you may say unto me, every Minister has his proper
charge, the limits whereof he may not pass, but a solemn fast is a general
thing, peradventure through a whole kingdom, and therefore is it a matter, that
(being larger than he has authority to deal in) belongs not unto him.
Whereunto I answer, that it is true, An objection answered.
one Minister has no further authority than his particular flock, and
therefore can call no public fast further than amongst his own people. But
the whole Church being guided by a Council of Ministers, is to be prepared to
a fast, by the authority of the whole.

You may further say unto me: What if the Eldershippe of Ministers do not, or
will not proclaim it, whether ought a particular Minister (who in that case
is as a private manne) to do it or no? An other objection answered.
I answer, that if other men will not do their duty, yet I may not meddle
with it, but the example or authority of others, must not make me leave mine
own duty undone. So that it is true a general fast, in a whole kingdom, or
in many parts thereof may not be proclaimed by one minister: yet may he,
(and by the word of God he ought) when God threatens or punishes, What is
the end of a public fast.
call his own charge unto this same exercise.

Lastly, he shows in the latter end of the verse, 22.
to what end all this is, to wit, that they may cry unto the Lord, that is,
be the more effectually drawn unto the feeling of their sins, and the
desert thereof, that so they might power out their prayers more effectually unto
the Lord, for the remission of the same: so that this fasting or solemn
assembly or any other of the outward thing thereof, he not commanded as any
part of Gods service (for bodily exercise profits nothing, 1. Tim. 4.8.
and whether we eat we are not the worse, Romans 14.17.
or whether we eat not we are never the better, in respect of any religion or
holiness) but as means to draw us the better unto it. Our repentance in the
day of fasting must be more than ordinary.
And therefore, when all these things are enjoined, to the end, that we may
cry unto the Lord: we learn, that it is not an ordinary sorrow for sin,
a craving of pardon, that will serve the turn at such a time, but as the
circumstaunces be more, and the causes more weightye, so must our humiliation
be in more measure, than at any other time before or after, if it may be
accepted of the Lord.

Alas for the day) The cry that they are to make unto the LORD, is in general
sort set down in this Uerse, whereunto the entrance is with a kind of
speech, not only expressing a great and heavy grief, but also a mind
exceedingly troubled in the same: for the words ( Alas this day) which should
go together, do in effect signify thus much: Great and grievous is our
misery, and the burden thereof lies so heavy upon us, that this day we are
as utterly cast away, and feel such a smarte of the Lords displeasure at
hand as we tremble and quake to think of it: So that these words do
express unto us, what humbled souls, and what grieved hearts we are to be
of, when (the Lord threatening to punish us) we are employed in this exercise,
to the end that we may learn, even (as it were) to break our own hearts,
and to enforce them unto a more deep meditation of our forlorn condition than
ever has entered into us heretofore. Again, whereas they are willed to say,
the day of the Lord is at hand, he does not mean that general day, wherein
he will call to account both the quick and the dead: but in consideration of
that miserable ruin which was to fall upon the land, What is meant by the day
of the Lord.
wherein the people thereof shall seem to be cut off from under heaven, and
in regard of the mighty power wherewith the Lord will stretche out his arm
in such a manner, as though he meant to consecrate it, as a peculiar day to
express his majesty. For as the Lord is said (of man) to sleep, Psalm.
7.6.
when he shows not forth his might, and (as it were) to have left things
unto their own disposition, so on the other side, it is said to be his day,
when by any extraordinary power he declares himself, either by deliverance
of his, or overthrow of their foes.

Moreover, it is said to be at hand, thereby to teach them, that if they
would in such manner as might be acceptable unto God, humble themselves before
him, then must they beware of promising unto themselves one hour space, but
rather to assure themselves of present desolation, which is diligently to be
learned of all persons, and at all times of repentance: For he that will any
way sooth him self in hope of the least time of forbearing, True repentance
gives no place to put far off the evil day.
shall so quench all the motions of true repentance, that he shall perform
nothing therein, but in such superficial manner as shall be to no purpose. The
fountain from whence all this woe must be looked for to fall upon them, is
said to be the Almighty, which name is properly given to God, when he shows
himself a victorer or ouercommer, whereby the Prophet gives them an other
meditation of their misery, that the Lord of heaven and earth, by whom, not
only all things are guyded and governed, but also they (in peculiar manner)
had many ways bin enriched and blessed, was no more to be looked for as a
deliverer or a protector, but as a most terrible Judge, and severe destroier,
because that they had rebelled against him, who had ever been so gracious
and bountiful unto them: and it teaches unto us this lesson, that if we
enjoy the blessings of God, and make not the right use of them, when the Lord
sees that we swarne from him, and do that which seems good in our own
eyes, he will come against us with his severity so much the more intolerable,
as we have received his blessings in greater abundance.

23.
Is not the meat offering, etc.) The causes of mourning (which we have heard
at large before) are here repeated: for in a solemn sorrow before the Lord,
what can go more near us (if we look into the matter aright) than this, that
the honor of God shall be stained, and (the ministry of the word ceasing)
the price of the precious blood of the Son of GOD fall to the ground, by
reason that his kingdom receives no increase by the preaching of the Gospel
which may convert souls unto him? Now in that he calls it joy and
gladness, he does first of all teach us, that (if we be of the number of
them that do in heart wish, that which in words they daily beg at the
hand of God, that is, that his kingdom may come, then is our principal joy,
and chiefest thing that we long after to labor to enlarge the spreading abroad
of the gospel, that many may embrace it, The joy of the godly.
and bring forth fruits worthy the same, but if we have little or small
care hereof (which indeed is the disposition of the most) it is a sign, that
we never yet profited so far in godliness, as these people, who (for all
that are ready to be thrown into final destruction.

And moreover, it does teach us, Religion decaying, the godly have not matter
of gladness in this world
that if we want this, and see that it goes to wrack, then is there nothing
under the sun that can give unto us any just matter of gladness. And
(indeed) if we consider well of it, we shall see, that it is most apparaunt:
For if we Mat. 16.26
gain the whole world, and do loose our own souls, what does it avail us.
But if we be not partakers of the ministry of Gods word, the means of our
salvation does cease, and therefore, though we should enjoy honor, wealth,
pleasure, and all that our heart can desire, and be without Christ Jesus, who
is the Savior of them (only) that learn by the knowledge of his blessed
word, to believe in him, we should but enjoy so many weyghts to wey down
our condemnation, and make it more intolerable unto us.

24.
Is not the seed?) The destruction of the commonwealth (which also we heard
before) is here repeated as a matter for them to meditate upon, and commend
the redress of it to the Lord, the particular speeches which are here more
than in that before, are to be considered: first, where he says: that the
seed is rotten under the clods, his mening is, that their seed which they did
sow, and hoped to reap again with increase, did never spring up, but
rotted under the ground. Now if this was a cause to induce the Israelites to
say: Alas for this day, then surely have we just cause for to sing the very
same Song, or rather for to mourn with the very same lamentation: for we can
none of us be ignorant, how the Lord has dealt with us, in sending so great
abundance of moisture, whose nature is to nourish, and so drowning the earth
therewith, whose kind is to bring forth for the use of man, that the earth was
unto the corn, as a grain, and the rain unto the earth, as the running of a
floode, and both they, so bent against man for his disobedience to his maker,
that in many places of this land, they denied him all, not accompting him
worthy to receive his seed again: so that we may assure our selves of the
lords anger against us, which will be sure to burst out as Iere. 4.4*
a fire, which none shall be able to quench, unless, we return by speedy
repentance.

How did the beasts mourn?) The prophet does further will them to say unto
the Lord, that the beasts did mourn, whereby he first shows the miserable
case of this people, that were so afflicted, as the very sense thereof did
(after a sort) move the brute beasts, and yet did they remain hard hearted,
whereby he shows their condition to be worse then that of the beast without
understanding. Secondly he shows the miserable confusion that the sin of
man brings upon all creatures, that for the same (even) the whole frame of
heaven, and earth becomes out of square: and the dumb creatures, are pinched
with penury, in such wise, as they according to their kind do groan, under
the burden of man's transgressions.

Now whereas he says, that the flocks of sheep are destroyed, he
touches one kind of punishment that we are to think of, for albeit, it be
true that if we respect the general number, it is not so with us, yet in
regard of the particular estate of diverse, it may be truly said that it
has also fallen upon us, for it is known, that the unseasonable wette that
did fall, infected with rottennes, very many flocks in diverse countries, so
that this being another of the causes of the Israelites sorrow, we are to
assure our selves that unless we make the right use of it, we shall feel that
punishment, and far greater, In seeking to redress any thing we must begin
with seeking reconciliation with God.
(except in time we repent) that yet we do not perceive.

In all this council, which the Lord by his Prophet gives them here, is no
mention made of any advice to prepare them selves for the Wars, that they
might resist the enemies, nor of pollitike provision in the time of this dearth
to make things reach so far, and be so well ordered as may be, which he
does not leave our, as though they were unlawful.

But he speaks of that which is the first to be done, and being truly
performed, will both teach and give a blessing unto the second means,
whereby we learn this lesson, that unless we take this course first, and
afterward proceed unto the second, (which also was the practice of that good
king: 2. Chro. 20.
Iehosaphat, in the like case) all our preparation and politic devises shall
vanish as the smoke, and do more harm then good: which thing (O the want of
England herein) if it were considered, then should we see a better issue, of
many notable plottes, that fall to the ground, and do no good, because the
LORD cannot away to be made servant unto flesh and blood, and therefore
when he smyteth or threateneth to smite us, and we flee to any other help
then him, or to any other good means that he has allowed us, before we
seek reconciliation with him, he will be sure to lay his curse upon our
labors, that they shall bring forth wind, and therefore let us pray unto the
Lord our God, that he would direct those that he has set over us, first, to
seek true reconciliation with him, and then shall their policy prosper, or
else can we look for nothing in the end but misery and desolation: and let
every private man learn the lesson for his own profit, that whenever any
thing goes a cross with him, and he would amend it, let him know that the
cause being in his sin that has displeased the Lord, if ever he look to
have it helped indeed, he must begin with this sound conversion unto GOD,
with whom he being once at one, other things shall fall out well, but he
continuing in displeasure with him (which he will do so long as he abides in
impenitencie) how can any thing that he takes in hand go well with him.

To thee will I cry.) The prophet seeing that these things did move them very
little, 25.26.
and perceiving the wretchedness that they are now growing into, resolves
with himself, that though they regard not their own good, yet will he
continue his care over them, in entreating the lord for them, whereby we
learn first this lesson, that the ministers of God, How Gods ministers must
behave themselves, when all good things are resisted.
must never be so discouraged, as to leave that calling wherein GOD has set
them, for any desert of the people: again, that Gods ministers must have a
care over the^ (being of their charge) that care not for themselves, but run
headlong to destruction: according as our savior has given them an example,
praying for his pesecutors, and saying: Luke 23.34.
Father forgive them for they know not what they do: lastly, when all things
are in such desperate condition, that godliness is oppugned (even) with high
hand, and the minister of the word, can do no good in his ministry, no nor be
suffered to exercise the same, yet must he not cast of the care of the church of
God, but even get him (with Jeremy) a cottage in the wilderness, Iere. 9.2.
and spend his dais in mourning for the desolation of Syon. Let us beseech the
Lord our God, even for his beloved son Christ's sake, to pardon the sins, and
forget the offenses of this land, or else, the ministers of his truth shall
(before it be long) have just occasion to lament with Jeremy and say: How
does the land become solitary, etc.

The honor be to God alone, and the profit to his Church.
