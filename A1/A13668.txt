Here begins the life of the blessed martyr saint Thomas.
The martyr saint Thomas was son to Gylberde Bequet a burgeys of the Cite of
London. And was borne in ye place where as now stands the church called
saint Thomas of Akers. And this Gylberde was a good deuote man / and took the
cross upon him / and went on pilgrimage to the holy land / and had a
servant with him. And when he had acomplisshed his pilgrimage / he was taken
homwarde by the hethenmen / and brought in prison of a prince named Amerau^t
where long time he / and his felyshyp suffered much pain and sorrow. And the
prince had great affection toward this Gylberd / and had often co^munycyon
with him of the christian feyth / and of ye royalme of England by which
conversation: it fortuned / that ye daughter of this prince had especial love
unto this gylberde / and was famylier with him: and on a time she disclosed her
love to him / saying if he would promise to wed her / she should forsake
friends / heritage / and country for his love / and become christian / and after
long comunycacion between them / he promised to wed her if she would become
christian / and told to her the place of his dwelling in England / and after by
the purueau^ce of god / the same Gylberd escaped and came home / and after this
it fortuned so yt this princes daughter stale away and passed many a wild
place and great adventure and by gods purueau^ce came at the last to london
demau^dynge and crie^ge Beket beket / for more english could she not /
wherefor the people drew a boute her what for the strange array of her / as
for that they understood her not / and many a shrewed boy / so long she went
till she came before gylberdes door / and as she stood there ye seruante that
had be with Gylberd in prison / which was named Rychard saw her and knew anon
that it was the princes daughter yt had them in prison / he showed it to his
master / and told to him how this maid stood at his door / and anon he went
forth to se her / and as soon as she saw him she fell in a soune for Joy /
and gylberd took her up and comforted her and brought her in to his house / and
sith went to the bishops which then were six at Poules and rehearsed all the
matter / and after they crystened her / and forthwith weded her unto gylberd
beket. And within time reasonable and accustomed was brought forth between thyem
a fair sone named Thomas. And after this / yet the said gylberde went again
in to the holy land / and was.iii. year or he came again / and this child
grew forth till he was set to scole / and learned well and be came virtuous.
And when he was.xxiiii. year old his mother passed out of this world / and
after this he served a merchau^te of London a while in keeping his charge and
comptes and from him he went to Stygande archebyssope of Canterbury / and he
was in so great favor with him that he made him archedeken and chief of his
counsel. And well executed he his office / i^ punysshynge the culpable / and
cherisshynge ye good people / and diverse times went to Rome to supporte and
help holy church. And after this Harry the second that was the empres sone
was made king of england / and he ordained this Thomas chau^celer / and had
great rule / and the land stood in prosperity / and saint Thom^s stood so
greatly in the kings favor yt the king was content with all that he did /
and wha^ the king went in to normandy / he betoke the governance of his sone
and the realm in to ye rule of saint Thomas / which he wisely governed till
his return again / and anon after dyed Thybaude tharchebyssope of
Cau^terburye / and the king gave his nomynacion to saint Thomas / and by the
chapyter was elect in ye year of his age.xliiii. and was full loath to take that
great charge on him / and so at last had his bulls / he was sacred and stalled
/ and became an holy man suddenly changed in to a new man doing great
penance as in werynge here with knottes / and abreche of the same down to ye
knees / and on a trynite sunday he received his dygnyte / and there was at
that time the king with many a great lord and.xvi. bysshopes. And fro thens
was sent the abbote of Euesam to the pope with diverse other clerks for the
Paul which he gate and brought to him / and he full mekelye received it. And
under his habyte he ware the abyte of a monk / and so was he withinforth a
monk / and outward a clerk and did great abstyne^ce making his body lene /
and his soul fat / and he used to be well seruyde at his table / and took but
a little refeccion thereof / and lyuede holyly in gyuynge good ensample. After
this many times ye king went over in to normandye / and in his absence always
saint Thomas had the rule of his son and of the realm / ye which was governed
so well / that the king could him great thank / and then abode long in this
realm / and when so was yt the king did anyethynge against the fraunchyses and
lybertes of holy church saint thomas ever withstode it to his power. And on a
time when the fees of London and of Wynchestre were vacant and void / the
king kept them both long in his hands for to have the profytes of them
wherefore. Thomas was heavy and came to the king and desired him to give tho.ii.
byssopryches to some virtuous men / and anon the king granted him his
desire / and ordained one master Roger bysshope of wynchestre / and the earl of
glocestres sone bysshope of london named sir Robert / and anon after saint
Thomas hallowed the abbaye of redynge / which ye first harry founded. And ye
same year he translated saint Edward king and co^fessoure at westmynster where
he was laid in a rich shryne / and in short time after by the entyseme^t of
the devil fell great debate varyaunce and strife between ye king and saint
Thomas / and ye king send for all the bysshoppes to appear before him at
westmynster at a certain day. At which day they assembled before him whom
he welcomed / and after said to them how yt the archebyssop would destroy his
law / and not suffer him to enjoy such things as his predecessors had used
before him / whereto saint Thom^s answered yt he never entendyd to do thing
that should displease the king / as far as it touchede not ye fraunchyse and
lyberte of holy church. Than the king rehearsed how he would not suffer clerks
that were thieves have ye execucion of ye law. To which saint Thom^s said yt
he ought not execute them / but they long to ye correccion of holy church /
and other diverse points / to which saint Thom^s would not agree To which ye
king said now I se well you would for do ye laws of this land yt have been
used in the days of my predycessours / but it shall not ly in thy power / and
so the king being wroth depperted. Than ye bysshopes all cou^seyled saint
Thom^s to follow ye kings intent or else ye land should be in great trouble /
and in likewise the lords temporal yt were his friends cou^seylled him the
same / and saint Thom^s said I take god to record it was never mine intent to
displeas ye king or to take any thing yt longs to his right and honor /
and than ye lords were glade and brought him to the king to oxenford / and ye
king dayned not to speak to him / and than ye king called all ye lords
spiritual and temporal to him / and said he would have all ye laws of his
fornfaders there new confermed. And there they were co^fermed by the all ye
lords spirytuall and temporal. And after this ye king charged them for to
come to him in Claryndon to his perlament at a certain day assygned / on
pain to run i^ his indygnacyon and at that time so departed. And this
perlament was holden at claryndon the.ix. year of the kings reygne and the
year of our lord. xi. C. Ixiiii. At this perlament were many lords / which
al were against saint Thomas. And than the king syttyng in his parlyament in
the prefe^ce of all his lords demanded them if they would abide and keep the
laws yt had been used in his forfathers days. Than saint Thomas spoke for the
party of holy church and said. All old laws yt ben good and right and not
against our mother holy church I grant with good will to keep them. And than the
king said yt he would not leave one point of his law and wexed wroth with saint
Thomas / and than certain bysshopes required saint Thom^s to obey yt kings
desire and will and saint Thom^s desired respyte to know the laws and than to
gyfe an answer / and when he understood them all / to some he consented / but
many he denied and would never be agreeable to the^ wherefore ye king mas wroth
/ and said he would hold and keep the^ / like as his p^dycessours had done
before him / and would not mynysshe one point of them. Than saint Thom^s said to
the king with full great sorrow and heavy chere. Now my most dear lord and
gracious king have pity on us of holy church your bedemen / and give us
respyte for a certain time / and thus departed every man. And saint Thomas
went to wynchester / and there prayed our lord devoutly for holy church / and
to gyfe him aid and strength for to defend yt. For utterly he determined to
abide by the lybertes and frau^chyse / and fell down on his knees full sore
weeping and said. O good lord I knowledge yt I have offended / and for mine
offense and trespass this trouble comes to holy church I purpose good lord to
go to Rome to be assoyled of mine offenses and deperted toward Canterbury and
anon ye king sent his officers to his manoyres and despoylled them / because
he would not obey ye kings statutes. And the king co^mauded to cease all his
lands and goods in to his hands / and than his seruau^ts deperted from him
/ and he went to ye seesyde for to have gone over the sea / but the wind was
against him and so thryes he took his shype and might not pass / and than he
knew that it was not our lords will yt yet he should not depart / and
returned secretly to Caunterbury / at whose coming his men made great Joy /
and on the morn came ye kings officers for to have seized all his goods. For
the noise was yt saint Thom^s fled the land. Wherefore they had dispoyled all
his manoyres / and seized them in to ye kings hands / and wha^ they came they
found him at Caunterbury / where they were sore abashed / and returned to
the king enfourmynge him yt he was yet at Canterbury / and anon after saint
Thomas came to the king to wodestoke for to pray him to be better dysposed to
ward holy church / and than said ye king to him in skorne / may not we two
dwell both in this land / art you of(...) sturdy and hard of heart / to whom
saint Thom^s answered sir yt was never my thought / but I would feign please you
/ and do all yt ye desire / so that ye hurt not the lybertes of holy church /
for them will I maintain while I live ever to my power / with which words ye
king was sore moved / and swore that he would have them kept / and in
especyall if a clerk were a thief he should be Iuged and executed after ye
kings law / and by no spirytuall law. And said he would never suffer a
clerk to be his master in his owen land. And charged saint Thom^s to apere
before him at North hampton / and bring all the bysshopps of this land with
him and so departed. Saint Thomas besought god of help and socoure / for ye
bysshopps which ougte to be with him were most against him. And after this saint
Thomas went to northa^pton / where ye king held than his great cou^seyl / in
the castle with all his lords. And when he came before the king / he said I
am come to obey your commandment / but before this time was never bysshope of
canterbury thus entreated / for I am head of ye church of all england and am
to you sir king your goostly father / and yt was never gods law that the
sone should destroy yt father which has charge of your soul / and by your
sterynge has made all the bishops yt should abide by ye right of ye church to
be against holy church and me. And ye know well that I may not fight / but I
am redye to suffer death / rather than I should suffer to lose ye right of holy
church. Than said ye king you spekest as a proud clerk / but I shall abbate
thy pride or I leave the. For I must taken with the. Thou understand well
that thou were my chaunceler many years. And ones I lent to the. v. C. pound
which you never yet have repayed / which I will that thou pay me again / or
else in contynent thoushalte go to prison. And than saint Thom^s answered ye
gave me that.v. C. pound and it is not sitting to demand yt which ye have
given / not withstanding he found suerte for ye said v. C. pound / and
departed for that day. And after this the next day the king demanded.xxx. M.
pound that he had surmysed on him to have stole^ he being chaunceler /
whereupon he desired day to answer at which time he said yt when he was
archebysshop he set him fre theryn without any clay me or debt before good
record / wherefore he ought not to answer to ye demand / and the bishops
desired saint Thom^s to obey the king / but in no wise he would not agree to
such things as should touch against the lybertes of the thurche. And than
they came to the king and forsook saint Thom^s and agreed to all the kings
desire and the proper servants of saint Thom^s flede from him and forsook
him / and than pore people came and acco^panyed him / and in ye night came to
him tow lords and told to him yt the kings meyny had enprysed to sle him.
And the next night after he departed in thabbyte of a brother of Sympryngham
and so cheuysshed yt he we^touer see. And in the mean while certain bishops
went to Rome to complain on him to the pope / and the king sent letters to
the king of france not to receive him / and the king Lewys said though a man
were banysshedand had co^mised there trespaces / yet he should be fre in
france / and so after when this holy saint Thomas came / he received him well
and gave him license to abide and do there what he would. In this meanewhyle the
king of england sent certain lords to the pope co^playnynge on the
archebysshope Thomas which made greuouse co^playntes / which wha^ the pope
had herd he would give none answer till he had hard tharchebysshope Thom^s
speak which would hastily come thither / but they would not adyde his coming
but departed without spedynge of their ententes / and came into england
again. And anon after saint Thom^s came to rome on saint. Marcus day at
afternone. And when his Cature should have brought fie sshe for his dinner /
because it was fasting day / he could get non for no money / and came and
told his lord saint Thomas so / and he bad him by such as he could get /
and than he bought flesh and made it ready for their dinner / and saint Thom^s
was served with a capon roasted and his memny with boylled mete and so it was that
ye pope herd yt he was come / and sent a cardynall to welcome him / and he
foun him at his dinner etynge flesh / which anon returned / and told to the
pope how he was not so perfyght a man as he had supposed. For contrary to the
rule of the church / he eteth this day flesh. The pope would not believe him
but sent another cardynall which for more euydent took the leg of the capon
in his kerchyef / and affermed the same. And opened his kerchyef before ye pope
and he found the leg turned in to a fysshe called a carpe and when ye pope
saw it he say de they were not trwemen to say such things of his good
bysshope / they said feythfully yt it was flesh that he ete. And after this
saint Thomas came to ye pope and did his reave rence and obedience whom ye pope
welcomed / and after certain co^munycacions / he demanded him what mete yt he
had eten / and said flesh as ye have hard before because he could find no
fysshe / and verry need c^pelled him thereto / than ye pope vunderstode of ye
miracle that the capons leg was turned in to a carpe of his goodness granted
to him and to all them of ye dyocise of canterbury lyce^ce to ete flesh ever
after on saint Marcus day when et falls on a fysshe day / and perdon with all
which is kept and accustomed unto this day and than saint Thomas enfourmed
the pope how yt the king of england would have him consent to diverse
artycles against ye lybertes of holy church / add what wrong he did to ye same
/ and yt for to dye he would never consent to them / and when ye pope had hard
him he wept for pity and thanked god that he had such a bysshope under him yt
had sowell defended ye lyberesholy church / and a non wroteroute letters and
bulls commau^dynge all ye bishops of criste^dome to observe and keep ye same.
And than saint Thomas offered to the pope his bysshopryke in to his hands and
his mytre in the cross ring / and the pope commanded him to Keep it still /
and said he knew no man so able as he was and after saint Thomas said mass
before ye pope in a white chessyble and after mass he said to ye pope that he
knew by reuelacion yt he should dye for ye right of holy church / and when it
should fall ye chessyble should be turned from white to read. And after he
deperted fro ye pope and came down in to france / unto thabbay of pou^tney /
and there had knwlege yt when lords spyrytuall and temporal which had been at
Rome were come home and had told ye king yt they in no wise might have their
intent / Than the king was greatly wroth. And anon banysshed all the
kynnesmen yt were longing to saint Thom^s yt they should in co^tynent void
his land and made them to swear yt they should go to him / and tell him for
his sake they were exyled / and so they went over see to him to pountney and he
being there was full sorry for the^ / and after there was a great chapyter in
england of ye monks of cisteaus and there ye king desired the^ to write to
pou^tney that they should no longer keep ne sustain Thomas the archebysshope.
For if they did he would destroy them of that order being in england / and
for fere thereof they wrote so over to pountney that he must depart thens with
his kynnesmen. And so he did / and was than full heavy / and remytted his cause
to god. And a none after the king of france sent to him yt he should abide
where it pleased him and dwell in his realime and would pay for ye costs of
him and his kynnesmen and he departed and went to seynes and thabbote brought
him on the way and saint Thomas told him how he knew by a vysyon yt he should
suffer death and martyrdom for the right of the church and the prayed him to
keep secret during his life / after this ye king of england came in to
france / and there told ye king how saint Thom^s would destroy his realm /
and than said how he would fordo such laws as his elders had used before /
wherefore saint Thom^s was sent for / and they were brought to gydder and the
king of frannce labored sore to set them at accord but it would not before yt
on would not mynysshe his laws and accustomes and saint Thomas would not grant
that he should not do contrary ye lybertes of holy church / and than the king
of france held with the king of england against saint Thom^s and was wroth with
him and commanded him to void his realm with his kynnesmen and than saint
Thomas wist not whether to go but comforted his kynnesmen as well as he might /
and purposed to have gone into province / for to have begged his bread / and as
he was going the king of france sent for him again / and wha^ he came he
cried him mercy and said he had offended god and him / and bad him abide in
his realm where he would / and he would pay for ye dispe^ses of him and all
his kynnesmen. And in ye mean while ye king of england ordained his sone king
/ and made him to be crowned by tharche bysshope of york / and other
bysshoppes which were ayenste the statutes of the land. For the archebysshope
of Caunterburye should have also consented / and also have crowned him
wherefore saint Thomas gat a bulle for to accurse them that so did ayenste him
and also on them yt occupye ye goods longing to him and yet after this the
king labored so much yt he accorded the king of england and saint thomas
which accord endured not long / for the king varyed from it afterward /
but saint Thomas upon his accord came home to Cau^terburye / where he was
received worshypfully and sent for them that had trespased against him / and by
ye auctorypte / of ye popes bull openly denounced them accursed / unto ye time
they came to amendeme^t / and when they knew this they came to him and would
have made him to assoyle them by force / and sent word over to the king how
he had done / whereof the king was much wroth / and said if he had me^ in his
land that loved him / they would not suffer such a traitor in his land a
live / and forthwith four knights took their counseyle togydder / and thought
they would do the king a pleasure and emprysed to slay saint thomas / and
suddenly departed and took their shyppynge toward england / and wha^ the
king knew of their departing he was sorry and sent after them but they were
on the se and departed or the messe^gers came wherefore ye king was heavy and
sorry. These ben the names of ye four knights. Sir Reignolde bereson sir Hughe
moruele / sir Wylliam tracy / and sir Richard de bryto. On crystenmas day
saint Thomas made a sermon at Caunterbury in his owen church / and weeping
prayed ye people to pray for him / for he knew well his time was nygh / and
there executed ye sentence on them yt were against ye right of holy church /
and yt same day as ye king sat at mete all ye bred that they handled wared
anon mowly / and hoar yt no man might ete of it / and ye bred yt they touched
not was fair and good for to ete / and hese.iiii. knyghtyes before said came to
Caunturbury on ye tewesdaye in Cristmas weke about euensonge time / and came
to saint Thomas and said that the king commanded him to make amends for ye
wrongs yt he had done / and also yt he should assoyle all them yt he had
acursed anon or else they would sle him. Than said Thomas all yt I ought to
do by right yt will I with a good will do / but as the sentence that is
executed I may not undo / but yt they will submyt them to ye correccion of holy
church for it was done by our holy father ye pope and not by me Than said sir
Reynold but if you assoyle ye king and us under standing the curse it shall
cost the thy life. and saint Thomas said you know well enough yt the king
and I were accorded on mary Magdaleyns day and yt this curse should go forth on
them yt had offended the church Than on of the knights smote him as he kneled
before the altar on the heed / and on sir edward gryme that was his croyser
put for the his arm with ye cross to bear of ye stroke / and the stroke smote
the cross in sondre / and his arm almoost of / wherefore he fled for fere /
and so did all ye monks that were yt time at complyn / and they smote each at
him / yt they smote of a great piece of ye skulle of his heed yt his brain
fell on ye pauement / and so they slew him and martred him and there cruelly
that one of them brake the point of his sword against the pauement / and thus
this holy archebysshop saint Thomas suffered death in his own church for the
right of holy church / and when he was deed they stired his brain / and after
went in to his chamber and took away his goods / and his horse out of his
stable: and took away his bulls and wryttynges / and delivered them to sir
Robert Broke to bear in to France to the king / and as they serched his
chamber they found in a cheste. ii. shertes of hear made full of great
knottes / and they said certainly he was a good man / and coming down into ye
church ward they began to dread and fere yt the ground would not have borne
them / and were sore aghast / for they supposed ye the earth would have swalowed
them all quick / than they knew that they had done amys / and anon it was
known all about how yt he was martred / and anon after took this holy body
and unclothed him and found bisshops clothing above / and habit of a monk
under / next his flesh a hard hear full of knottes / which was his sherte
/ and his breche was of the same / and the knottes styked fast within the
skin / and all his body full of worms he suffered great pain / and was thus
martred the year of our lord.xi. C. lxxi. and was.liii. year old. And soon
after tidings came to the king how he was slain wherefore the king took
great sorrow / and sent to Rome for his absolucion / now after that saint
Thomas departed fro the pope / the pope would daily look upon the white
chesyle: that saint Thomas had said mass in / and that same day that he was
martered he saw it torn into red: where by he knew well that that same day
he suffered martyrdom for yt right of holy church / and commanded a mass to
requiem slempnly to be song for his soul. And when that the quere began for
to sing Requiem / an aungel on hie above began the office of a martyr.
Letabitur iustus. And than anon after / all the hole quere followed singing
forth the mass of ye office of a martyr. And than the pope thanked god yt it
pleased him to show such miracles for his holy martyr / at whose tomb by the
merit and prayers of this holy martyr / our blessed lord there has showed
many miracles / the blind have recovered there their sight / the dombe their
speech / the deef their herynge / the lame their lymmes / and the deed their
life. Therefore let us pray to this glorious martyr / to be our advocate / that
by his peticion we may come unto everlasting bliss.

Amen.
Thus ends the life of the blessed martyr saint Thomas of Caunturbury.
