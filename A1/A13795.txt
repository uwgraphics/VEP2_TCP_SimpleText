A pleasant new Ballad of Tobias: wherein is showed the wonderful things which
chanced to him in his youth; and how he wedded a young Damsel that had had
seven husbands and never enjoyed their company: who were all slain by a wicked
spirit.


IN Ninivie old Toby dwelt,
an aged man and blind was he,
And much affliction he had felt,
which brought him unto poverty.
He had by Anna his true wife,
one only son and eke no more,
Which was the comfort of his life,
and he by him did set great store.
He brought him up most virtuously,
in true obedience and awe,
And every day he did apply,
to fear the Lord and keep his Law.
Upon a time it came to pass,
he called to him his son with speed,
And thus to him his words did frame,
my son, quoth he thou knost my need.
Thou must unto Gabael go,
at Raguels in Media land,
For I did lend him long ago,
ten talents on his only band.
My father dear Tobias said,
at your command straight will I go,
How shall I get the money paid,
seeing the man I did never know?
Take here the writing then, quoth he,
which is sufficient being seen,
And get a guide to go with thee.
since thou that way have never been.
A Guide Tobias son had got,
an Angel in the shape of man,
Which thing he did not know God wot,
the Lord did so appoint it than.
Tobias with his blessed guide,
went on his journey then with speed:
Until they came to Tigris side,
at that fair flood they did abide.
Tobias would wash him there,
by reason of the Summers heat,
A mighty fish put him in fear,
which leapt out of the waters great.
Cut up the fish, the Angel said,
but keep the Liver, Heart, and Gall,
To do the same be not afraid,
great cures there shall be done withal.
When this was done, away they went,
and coming near their iourneys end,
We Will lodge to night the Angel said,
with Raguel thy fathers friend.
He has a daughter fair of face,
and also of a virtuous life,
And when we come into that place,
I Will speak that the may be thy wife.
Why Azarias, then quoth he,
so Toby did the Angel call,
I wis the is no mate for me,
swift death does to her Lovers fall.
Seven men have to her married been.
which in her love did take delight.
When her bed chamber they have seen.
they have not lived out half the night.
A wicked spirit loves her so.
he will not suffer any man,
With her into the bed to go,
but works his: death do what he can.
The Angel said, good courage take,
for so it shall not be with thee,
For such perfumes I will thee make,
the wicked spirit away shall flee.
To Raguels house away they came*
where Sara met them fair and bright,
And after salutations done,
she brought him to her Parents sight.
The second part,
to the same tune.


GReat cheer they made and down they sat,
and all for young Tobias sake;
And after long and pleasant chat,
betwixt these two a match they made.
By Moses Law they married were,
the Brides chamber prepared likewise:
When young Tobias came in there,
the tears fell down from Sara's eyes.
A pan of coals he brought with him,
the fishes heart and liver there
Within that fire did he cast in,
which cast a savor every where.
And by that sweet and precious smell,
the wicked spirit was displac't,
Within that room he could not dwell,
where out away he went in have.
In bed they laid the beauteous Bride,
the chamber door they shut therefore,
young Toby lay down by her side*
whom he did think to see no more.
And therefore Raguel in the night
for him before had made a grave;
And to his wife he wept, and said,
there is no means his life to save.
One of the maidens send, quoth he,
to see how all the matter stands*
If it be so that dead he be,
he shall be buried by my hands.
The maiden joyful news did bring,
Tobias is a live, quoth she,
When Raguel heard of this thing,
he did rejoice exceedingly.
For joy he^ a solemn feast,
the Bridell (...) ^^ye^ he kept,
Thereto c(...) a friendly guest:
in sorrow now no more they slept.
Then Azarias went straight way,
and to the feast Gabael brought,
Rejoicing at this marriage day,
did pay the money which he ought.
But yet old Toby and his wife
did all the time in sorrow dwell,
They thought their son had lost his life,
and nothing could their grief expel*
His aged mother every day
did watch along the high way side,
And for his welfare often did pray,
no meat nor drink she could abide.
But when the wedding ended was,
young Toby with his lovely Bride,
To Ninivy did home ward pass,
with goods and cattle on each side.
But Toby and the Angel bright,
before his Wife made haste to go,
For to prepare all things aright
his lovely Bride to welcome tho.
His mother watching in the way,
full soon espied her tender son,
Rejoicing at the happy day,
she told her husband he was come.
Whereat old Toby stumbled out,
for he was blind, and could not see:
Young Toby with the fishes Gall
rubbed both his eyes immediately.
Whereat the whiteness of his eyes
incontinent did fall out quite:
So that before he did arise*
he had again his perfect sight.
Great joy was then on every side,
young Toby told his father all:
Who went to meet his lovely Bride,
with joy and mirth that was not small*
