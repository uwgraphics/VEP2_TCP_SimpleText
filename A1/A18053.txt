24.

Q. Was Christ his raising from the dead a matter of so great moment?

A. Yes; he was delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our

Q. As David by promise received from God an everlasting kingdom, 2. Sam. 7.
13. etc. which promise was made good in and by the resurrection of Christ; so
we: But where is this promise of the kingdom, since they who most believe in
him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, seem many times of all other
most miserable, and that even to their very dying day?

A. God, according to his abundant mercy, has begotten us again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 1. Pet. 1. 3.

Q. What hope is that?

A. To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fades not away,
reserved in heaven for us, 1. Pet. 1. 4.

Q. That is indeed reserved for us: But how are we (so frail by nature, and so
beset on every side with many sore temptations) reserved for it?

A. We are kept (as in a fort) by the power of God, through faith unto
salvation, 1. Pet. 1. 5.

Q. This salvation is to be revealed in the last time, as it is there said: But
how shall we possess our souls in the mean season?

A. By our patience, Luke 21. 19.

Q. Is there so great need of patience?

A. Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise, Heb. 10. 36.

Q. It is true indeed. For we must needs drink of the cup which God reaches
unto us: neither can any be a true Christian which does not patiently offer
himself in sacrifice to God.

Regeneration.
HOw do men attain to that high dignity of being believers in Christ Jesus?

A. They are borne of God, Ioh. 1. 13.

that we being delivered from sin, should live in righteousness: What is it to
live in righteousness?

1. Pet. 4. 2.

Q. What is the will of God?

A. This is the will of God, even your Sanctification, 1. These. 4. 3.

Q. When is our sanctification according to the will of God?

A. When, as he that calls us is holy, so we be holy in all manner of
conversation, 1. Pet. 1. 15.

Q. What reason is given why it should be so?

A. Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy, Verse. 16.

Q. So we are commanded to be perfect, as our Father which is in heaven is
perfect; not for the degree, for in that we come infinitely short of Gods
holiness, or perfection; but for truth and universality of obedience to his
laws. This leaves no liberty to men to live after the flesh in any thing?

A. No: For if you live after the flesh, you shall die* Romans 8. 13.

Q. What course then is to be taken to save our lives?

A. If through the Spirit we do mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live,
Rom 8. 13.

Q. By this it plainly appears, that a necessity lies upon us, of striving
to enter in at the strait gate?

A Yes: Because, Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto
life, and few there be that find it, Mat. 7. 14.

Of the holy Scriptures.
Question. Whence is the will of God to be learned?

A. Out of the holy Scriptures, all given by inspiration of God, 2 Timothy 3. 16.

Q. This is their excellency above all other writings, to be all given by
inspiration of God. Wherein else do they excel all other writings?

A. They are able to make us wise unto salvation, through faith which is in
Christ Jesus, 2. Tim. 3 15.

Q How are we to be affected toward them, in regard of these excellencies?

A. Not to let them depart out of our mouth, but to meditate therein day and
night, Josh. 1. 8.

Q. To what end?

A. That we may observe and do according to all that is written therein, ibid.

Q What good will come of that?

A. Then shall we make our way prosperous, and then shall we have good
success, Josh 1. 8.

Q. Do not diverse very studious of the holy Scriptures meet with many losses
and crosses?

A. Yes; but mark the upright man, and behold the just, for the end of that
man is peace, Psalm. 37. 37.

Q. How comes that to pass?

A. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of
them all, Psalm. 34. 19.

Recovery and reconciliation after Offense.
Question. THe righteous are delivered at Gods appointed time, though no*
always corporally, yet most graciously and happily; their heavenly Father
making all things to work for their good, and sending them, as he did his own
Son, and the holy Martyrs, by the chariot of the cross, into their heavenly
country. But, when we fall into sin (as who lives and sins not?) what is
then our refuge?

A. We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is
the propitiation for all our sins, 1. Ioh. 2. 1.

A. He that confesses and forsakes his sin, shall have mercy, Prove. 28. 13.
1. Ioh. 1. 9. Psalm. 32. 6.

Q. What is to be done then of every good man, when he has offended God?

A. For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto God in a time
when he may be found, Psalm. 32. 7.

Q. What special fruit comes of that?

A. Surely in the flood of great waters, they shall not come nigh unto him,
Psalm. 32. 7.

Q. God will keep them from being swallowed up in the deepest gulfes of
dangers, and even of death it self: Does not this embolden men to sin,
seeing their pardon is so ready and certain?

A. He that is borne of God keeps himself, that the wicked one touches him
not, 1. Ioh. 5. 18.

Q. Satan touches him not with a mortal wound, but what course is to be taken
in offenses between man and man?

A. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent,
forgive him, Luk 17. 3.

Q. How far must this readiness to forgive extend?

A. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a
day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shall forgive him, Luke 17. 4.

Q. And what is more to be done herein?

A. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another that you may
be healed, Iam. 5. 16.

them that are his; but the meaning is, to make it sure to our own souls and
consciences: What other necessary use is there of good works?

A. Our work shall have a reward, 2. Chr. 15 7. Luke 14. 14. Rev. 14. 13.

Q. Even to a cup of cold water given to a disciple in the name of a disciple;
but of grace, not of merit: What other necessary use is there?

A. That if any obey not the word, they may without the word be won by our
conversation, 1. Pet. 3. 1. 2.

Q. Be won to the love and admiration of the word, and so be prepared to their
conversion. Is there any other use?

A. So is the will of God, that by welldoing we may put to silence the
ignorance of foolish men, 1. Pet. 2. 15.

fervency in the practice of good works?

Q. So indeed he answered a Lawyer, who would needs know of him what he should
do. And again, Mat. 19. 17. to a young man enquiring of him, what good thing

A. To ask in faith and waver not, Iam. 1. 6.

Q. What else?

A. To forgive if any offense be, or else our heavenly Father will not forgive
us, Mark. 11. 25. 26.

Q. What else?

A. To be most humble with the poor Publicane, lest we take the repulse with
the proud Pharisee, Luke 18. 9.

Q. What else?

A. To be fervent in prayer, and not faint, Iam. 5. 16. Luke 18. 1.

Q. What say you of thankesgiving to God?

there for that?

A. This is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 18.

Q. What other reason is there?

Q. What set form of prayer has Christ left unto us, to pray, and to frame
our prayers by?

heaven, etc. Matthew. 6. 9. Luke 11. 2.

Q. Of this most holy prayer I have briefly set down my mind else where?

Sacraments.
ARe not Baptism and the Lords Supper worthy means also to uphold our weak
faith, and to further our zeal toward God, and charity one toward another?

A. Yes; For these Sacraments are seals of the righteousness of faith, Romans
4. 11.

Q. They are indeed seals for confirmation of our most holy faith, which even
our father Abraham himself had need of: But are they not in like manner seals
for confirmation of Christian unity and amity?

A. Yes; By one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, and have been all
made to drink into one spirit, 1. Cor. 12. 13.

Q. This is a mavelous mystery, by one spirit to be all incorporate in our
Baptism, into me mystical body of Christ, which is his holy Catholic Church;
and to be all made to drink in the Lords Supper into one Spirit, by partaking
the mystical Cup, or quickening blood of Christ Jesus, truly exhibited to all
the faithful therein. What does this blessed Union and Communion with our Head
Christ, and with his holy Body the Church, necessarily bind us unto?

A. To an endeavor of keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,
Ephesians. 4. 3.

Q. When is that bond of peace kept undefiled?

A. When there be no dissentions among us, but we be knit together in one
mind, and in one judgment, 1. Cor. 1. 10.

Q. What is Baptism?

A. The washing of the new birth, Tit. 3. 5.

Q. Wherein consists this washing of the new birth?

A. Not in putting away the filth of the flesh; but in the renewing of the holy
Ghost 1. Pet. 3. 21. Tit. 3. 5.

Q. What is the manner and means of this renewing of us, who are so wholly
polluted and unclean by nature?

A. We are washed, we are sanctified, we are justified, in the Name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of God, 1. Cor. 6. 11.

Q. We are washed in Baptism, in token that we are sanctified and justified by
the merit of Christ, in whose Name we are baptized, and by the efficacy of
Gods Spirit given unto us therein: But why are we baptized in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost?

A. In token of the Covenant betwixt God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, and
us, Genesis 17. 11.

Q. As Circumcision was, so Baptism is a sign of the Covenant between God and
his people: What is that Covenant on Gods part?

A. That he will be our God, and the God of our seed, Genesis 17. 11.

Q. What on our part?

A. We pass into the Covenant of God, to be his people, and so to observe all
things, whatsoever Christ has commanded us; Deuteronomy. 29. 12. Mat. 28. 20.

Q. Is not this to make three Gods?

A. No; These three, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost are one, 1. Ioh.
5. 7.

Q. They are one in substance and consent, yet three Persons, or distinct
manners of being in the Godhead: What is proper to the person of the Father?

A. To be called one God, and the only true God, of whom are all things, 1.
Cor. 8. 6. Ioh. 17. 3.

Q. The Godhead is commonly ascribed to the Father, because in him is the
beginning of it: who has not only his essence as God, but his personal being
as Father of himself: he is also called the only true God, not to exclude the
Son, and the holy Ghost (who are of the same substance and glory with him)
but all idols and creatures only: What is proper to the person of the Son?

A. He is the only begotten of the Father, the power of God, and the wisdom
of God, by whom are all things, Ioh. 1. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 24. and 8. 6.

Q. What is proper to the person of the holy Ghost?

A. He proceeds and is sent of the Father, and the Son, from whom he
works all, in all things, Ioh. 14. 26. and 15. 26. 1. Cor. 12. 11.

Q. Set down some few texts of holy Scriptures, prooving this most high and
incomprehensible mystery, the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity.

A. Matthew. 3. 16. 17. and 28. 19. 1. Cor. 13. 13. Ephesians. 2. 18. 1. Ioh. 5. 7.
Revel. 1. 4. 5. Let him that reads understand, etc.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A. The Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ, 1. Cor. 10. 16.

Q. What is the bread which is solemnly blessed and broken?

A. The body of Christ broken for us, 1. Cor. 11. 24.

Q. And what is the Cup of blessing which we bless?

A. The blood of Christ, or the New Testament in his blood, Matthew. 26. 28. 1.
Cor. 11. 25.

Q. Does not this make for Popish transubstantiation?

A. Nothing at all: It is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profiteh
nothing, Ioh. 6. 63.

Q. It is most true, that the spirit, or spiritual receiving of the flesh and
blood of Christ crucified for us, by faith in him, gives life to the receiver:
the flesh, or bodily receiving without that, profits nothing: But why are we
to eat this Bread, and drink this Cup?

A. Do this in remembrance of me, says our blessed Savior twice over, 1.
Cor. 11. 24. 25.

Q. To what end are we so solemnly to be put in remembrance of him in this
holy action?

A. That so often as we eat this bread and drink this cup, we may show the
Lords death till he come, 1. Cor. 11. 26.

Q. His most bitter and meritorious death, with the sweet fruits of it, are
upon this occasion to be declared at all hands, both publicly, and privately,
with the greatest alacrity, joy, thankfulness, and zeal, that possibly can
be: But how are we to prepare and address our selves to this holy banquet?

A. Let every man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and
drink of this cup, 1. Cor 11. 28.

Q. What is the danger of the neglect hereof?

A. To be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, 1. Cor. 11. 27.

Q. No marvel, since abuse offered to the Sacrament, which is an holy
instrument, seal, and image of the King of Kings, even by divine institution,
must needs redound to the Lord himself: They must needs therefore eat and
drink their own damnation, that do so requite the Lord for this inestimable
mercy: But whereof must we chiefly examine our selves?

A. Whether we (...) in the faith; whether Christ be in us or ^^. 2. Cor. 13. ^.

Q Whereby will it appear that we be of sound religion, and have saving faith?

A. Saving faith purifieth the heart, Act. 15. 9.

Q. How else?

A. It works also by charity, Gal. 5. 6.

Q. How else?

A. It makes us as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word, that
we may grow thereby, 1. Pet. 2. 2.

Q. Whereby shall we know that Christ is in us?

A. Hereby we know that Christ abides in us, even by the Spirit that he has
given unto us, 1. Ioh. 3. 24

Q. And how may the Spirit of God be discerned in us?

A. By his fruits; Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance. Gal. 5. 22, 23.

Q. How may we be assured, that the fruits of the Spirit are in us in truth?

A. If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit, Gal. 5. 25.

Q When, by living and walking in the Spirit, that is, by the habit or
customary practice of his fruits, with a holy delight therein, we have found
that Christ abides in us: What remains further to be examined?

A. How we grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, 2. Pet. ^. 18.

Q. A very necessary point to be examined of us all; ^o^,: Christ (...) not to
grow, is to go down the (...): But when is this our solemn and serious
examination of our selves thoroughly performed?

A. When having considered our ways, we turn our feet unto Gods testimonies,
Psalm. 119. 59.

Question. What is constantly to be done of him that desires a quiet life,
and to see good days in this world?

A. Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile: Depart from
evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it, Psalm. 34. 13. 14.

Q. And what is to be done to escape the most desperate dangers that can befall
men here, or hereafter?

A. Watch you, says Christ, and pray continually, that you may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things, that shall come to pass, and to stand
before the Son of man, Luke 21. 36.

ACTS 24. 15. I have hope toward God, that there shall be a resurrection of
the dead, both of the just, and unjust.

16. And herein I exercise my self, to have always a conscience void of
offense, toward God, and toward men.


FINIS.
