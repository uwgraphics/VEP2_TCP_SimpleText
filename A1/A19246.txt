THE WORLD TVRN'D TOPSIE TVRVIE BY PAPISTS.
IN old World, The Bishops of Rome preached painefully, and ordinarily, as may
appear by the Homilies which are extant unto this day, under the names of Leo
the First, and Gregory the First: But a multis seculis vix quisquam (ex Romany
Pont.) reperitur e Cathedra docuisse: It can hardly be proved, that any one
Bishop of Rome, for many of these hundred years last past, were seen in a
Pulpit, as De Rege ex li. 3. cap. 2. p. 225.
Ioh. Mariana confesses.

In old World, The Bishops of Rome were Censu pauperrimi, eruditione diuites*
Poor in purse, but rich in wisdom and goodness: But, nunc aliquoties
contingunt Romans Pont. aerario locupletissimi Apostolicis opibus, hoc est, sacra
doctrina, and pietate nudissimi: In these latter days we have many Bishops of
Rome, rich in purse, but as poor in learning and piety, as Job of wealth, in
his greatest misery, as Scholijs in Ep. Hieron. ad Demet. de virgin. seruand.
To. 1. operum Hieron.
Erasmus witnesses, In pontificibus nemo hodie sanctitatem requirit: No man,
in these days, looks for honesty in a Bishop of Rome, as De verb. Episc. l.
6. in vit. July 3. page 401. b.
Mussonus confesses.

In old World, All Bishops, and such Presbyters who were of any special note
for their honesty and learning were called Popes, as Panopl. lib. 4. cap. 80.
fol. 4^2.
Lindan, Tract. de vocu^ obscur. Eccles. Interpret. ad finem Plat. de vit. Pont.
Onuphrius, De suc. Eccles. minist. ac benefic. lib. 1. cap. 10.
Duaren, and Not. in Martyr. To. Ian. 10. c.
Baronius confess. Saint Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage; Saint Austin, Bishop of
Hippo: Saint Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, were called Popes. But now the
Bishop of Rome claymes it in his sole right to be called Pope. Ad sin. Epist.
55. Greg. 7. apud Binn. To. 3. Conc. part. 2. pa. 1196.
Gregory the Seventh, about the year 1073. (a little after the Devil was let
loose) made a Decree to that purpose, providing: Vt Papae nomen vnicum esset in
vniuerso orb Christiano, nec liceret alicui seipsum vel alium eo nomine
appellare: That there should be but one man in all Christendom called Pope:
and that no man should dare to style himself, or any other, with the name of
Pope.

In old World, The Bishops of Rome were styled by other Bishops with such
Titles as argued good fellowship among them, and no superiority in one over
another. Ep. 52. Anton.
Saint Cyprian termed Cornelius Bishop of Rome, frater, Collega, Coepiscopus,
Brother, Colleague, and fellow Bishop. The Theodor. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 8.
Bishops assembled in Council at Sardica, speaking of Julius Bishop of Rome,
gave him no other titles, than that of Brother, and Colleague: which they gave
indifferently to Athanasius, Asclepas, and all other Bishops to whom they writ,
and of whom they had occasion to speak. In like manner, the Theodor. Hist.
lib. 5. cap. 9.
Bishops of Constantinople used Damasus Bishop of Rome, Brothering him, and
Colleaguing him, as they did others, to whom they writ as well as to him. But
now the Bishop of Rome is called, Bell. l. 2. de To. Pont. cap. 31.

universal Bishop; the universal Pastor; the universal Judge; the Viceroy of
heaven; a mortal God; the best, and the greatest; the highest power on earth;
the head of the whole Church; the father of the Church; the Churches husband;
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.

In old World, Cicarell. in vita Sixti 5. ad finem Platinae.
The Bishops of Rome stood not upon superscriptions of Letters, but received
such as were sent unto them, how ever they were indorsed: But now they have
made a Decree in consistory: Ne post hac ab vllis Principibus missae
recipiantur literae, quae debitis Titulis non sunt inscriptae: That no Letters
be received from any Prince, unless they give the Bishop of Rome his due
titles. Constantinus Melchiadi. Eusebius. Hist. lib. 10. cap. 5.


In old World, When Emperors writ to the Bishops of Rome, they prefixed their
own names before the Bishops: Constantio Liberius apud Baron. Annal. Tom. 3.
ad Ann. 354. nu. 2.
and when the Bishops writ to the Emperor, they set their names after the
Emperors: But hic stylus impraesentiarum in Romans Curia exoleuit: This manner
of writing is out of use in the Roman Court in our days. In literis ad nos
missis nomen tuum nostro praeponis, Alcial. in Codic. Justinian, de sum.
Trinit. and fide Cathol. c. inter claras.
in quo, insolentiae, non dicam arrogantiae, nomen incurris: In the letters
which you sent unto us, you set your own name before ours: whereby you incur
suspicion of insolency, I will not say arrogance, says Pope Adrian to
Frederick the Emperor. Append. ad Radeuicum quae habetur apud Baron. Annal.
Tom. 12. ad An. 1159. nu. 5.
And, Falsum-praesumi rescriptum, in quo non legatur summi Pontificis nomen
ante caetera: That is supposed to be a false writ, in which the Popes name is
not set in the first place, says a Popish Lawyer.

In old World, Guilielm. in spec. de prased. Re script. test Alciato loco
citato. Apud Baron. Annal. Tom. 12. ad. An. 1159. nu. 4.
They who writ unto the Pope, used words of the singular number, thou-ing hint,
as they did others. But Pope Adrian took that in great snuff at the hands of
Frederick the Emperor: And since that, no man dares thou the Pope.

In old World, Greg. 8. Epist. lib. 2. Indict. 11. Epist. 61.
The Pope of Rome acknowledged the Emperor for his Lord and Master: But in
these latter times, the Popes of Rome have taught the Emperor to acknowledge
them for his Lord and Master.

In old World, even till Gregory the First his time (by Did. 63. Tibi Domino.
Bell. his confession) Imperator dominium temporale in vrbem Romans Lib. 2. de
sum^ Pont. cap. 28.
habebat: The Emperor had the temporal government of the City of Rome: But
now the Pope (...) taken it into his own hands. The Emperor has not so much
as a Goose-gate in the City of Rome.

In old World, the Popes were not wont to give arms, as Princes and Noblemen
did: Veteres Pontifices talem, morem non leguntur habuisse: The ancient Popes
had no such custom, says Institut. Moral. part. 2. cap. 43. Col. 941.
Azorius: But, about the year 1040. this custom was taken up, and is
continued, Vt To. Pont. insignibus Gentilitijs vterentur, says the same
Azorius.

In old World, till Siluesters time, Cardinalium nomen non legimus: we read
not so much as of the name of Cardinal, as Instit. moral. part. 2. lib. 4. ca.
1. 4. quaer. Col. 604.
Azorius confesses; yet now the name is common.

In old World, there were Cardinals in other places, as well as at Rome. Onuph.
Tract. de obscur. voc. interpretat. and Moscon. de May Eccl. Milit. lib. 1.
part. 1. c. 5.
There were Cardinals at Rauenna, at Pisa, at Millan, at Naples in Italy, at
Compostella in Spain, at Episcopus Eliensis resp. ad Bell. Apolog. cap. 4.
page 103.
Paul's Church in London: But now, as the Bishop of Rome has robbed other
Bishops of the name Pope: so has he robbed other Cardinals of the name
Cardinal. Pius 5. in suo deplomate Anno 1568. penitus hoc nomen in omnibus
alijs Ecclesijs praeterquam in Romans extinxit: and solummodo Cardinalis
nomencompetere voluit Cardinalibus S. R. E. a Papacreatis. Pius the 5. in his
Bull, bearing date 1568. has cried down the name Cardinal in all other
Churches but in Rome: and he has decreed, that such only as are created
Cardinals of the Church of Rome, by the Pope, shall be called Cardinals, as is
witnessed by Loco supra citat.
Mosconius, Vicar general to the Archbishop of Bononia.

In old World, the Cardinals of Rome were inferior to Bishops: in so much,
that a Cardinall-ship was but a step to a Bishopric* But now Cardinals are
superiors to all Bishops. A Bishopric is a step to a Cardinal-ship, as Lib.
1. de Clericis, cap. 16.
Bell. himself confesses.

In old World, it was decreed, Conc. Narbon. sub Necca. Rege, Anno 589. apud
Bin. Tom. 2. Conc. p. 722.
Vt nullus Clericorum vestimenta purpura induat: That none of the Clergy should
wear purple: But now the Pope and his Cardinals are clad in purple: And Tom.
8. Annal. ad Ann. 589.
Baronius iustifies them therein.

In old World, it was decreed, Matter Histor.
Ne deinceps To. Pont. and Cardinales vterentur Equis and Mulis sed tantum
Asinis, Christi, cuius videri vellent vicarij, exemplo: That the Popes of Rome,
and their Cardinals, should not ride upon Horses or Mules, but on Asses, as our
Savior Christ did, whose Vicars, they say, they are. But Chronolog. lib. 4. ad
An. 1294.
Genebrard upon mention of this, cries out, O legem nunc prodigiose euersa^! O
excellent Law, but as now quite out of force!

In old World, it was Greg. lib. 4. Epis. ep. 55.
decreed, That no Archbishop should pay any thing for the Platina in vita Leon
2.
Pall which they received of the Bishop of Rome: But Sleidan Comment. lib. 13.
de Archiep. Mogunt pallio.
now it stands some, ere they can get it home, in 30. fere millibus aureorum,
almost 30000. French Crowns.

In old World, it was Anastas. in vit. Bonifacij 3. and Baron. Annal. Tom. 8.
ad An. 606.
decreed, under pain of the great Curse; That no man should dare so much as to
talk of electing a new Pope or Bishop of the City wherein he lived, nisi
tertio die depositionis eius, but the third day after his burial: But since
the making of this, Massonus de vib. Ep. in Coelest. 3. Plat. de vit. Pont. in
Leo 3.
they have chosen new Popes at Rome, ere the former Popes were buried, yea, ere
their bones were thoroughly cold.

In old World, even in Chrysostom, Ambrose, Austin, Leo the First, Gregory the
First his time, all Bishops, even the Bishops of Rome, were chosen by the
Clergy, and people of their Cities, as Lib. 1. de Cl^ricis, cap 9.
Bell. confesses: But now the Su. Pol. Virg. de Invent. rerum, lib. 4. cap. 10.
Bishop of Rome is chosen by the Cardinals only: and all other Bishops are
chosen by the Bishop of Rome. A custom so absurd, that In sum. verb. Lex. 13.
quaer^.
Siluester Prierias did note it in these words: Hodie, quando ambitio and
lasciuia totam Ecclesiam deturpauit, Papa reseruat sibi collationem omnium
dignitatum, (.i.) Patriarcharum, Metropolitanorum, Episcoporum, etc.

In old World, In Ioh. cap. 6. Annot. 27.
as Cardinal Tolet confesses, Prohibita fuit sub vna specie communio, and
iniunctum Catholicis, vt sub vtraque communicarent: It was forbidden the Laity
to communicate in one kind, and enjoined them to receive in both kinds: But
now Conc. Irid. sess. 24. Can. 2.
the Laity among the Papists, receive in one kind only: Conc. Constant. sess.
13.
The Priest who delivered it to a Layman in both kinds, is excommunicate.

In old World, Eucharistia sub vtraque specie (...)lita: The Communion was
reserved in both kinds, (...) Annal. Tom. 5. ad An. 404. nu. 32.
Baronius confesses. But Ibid.
now the Popish Church has taken order it shall be reserved in one kind
only, to wit, in bread.

In old World, the words of Consecration were uttered openly, Tho. Aq. Sum.
Theol. part. 3. q. 78. Art. 1. Hardings Answer to Bishop Jewels challenge, 16.
Article.
as the Papists generally confess. But Conc. Trid. sess. 22. Can. 9.
now, submissa voce proferuntur: they are uttered in secret.

In old World, Painel. Annot. in Cyprian. de Lapsis, nu. 82.
It was the custom to deliver the Sacrament of Christ's body into the hands of
the Receiver. But Ibid. and Durantus de ritibus Eccl. lib. 1. ca. 16. nu. 12.
now (by Papists) the Sacrament is put into the Receivers mouth, and not given
into his hand.

In old World, Greg. dial. l. 2. Cap. 23.
the Deacon was accustomed to bid then depart, who did not communicate.
Chrysostom. Hom. 3. in Epist. ad Ephesians.
They were reputed impudent, and wicked wretches, who looked on, and
communicated not. But now Papists allow lookers on.

In old World, It was the custom to communicate ^uery day: Nomo Catholicus
inficiari potest fuisse Apostolorum, and S. Romans Ecclesiae consuetudinem, imo
institutum vtque sancitum ab Anacleti temporibus, viz. vt omnes quotidie
co^municarent: No Catholic can deny, but that it was the custom of the
Apostles, and of the Church of Rome, ever since Pope Anaclotus days: yea, no
Catholic can deny, but it was an Ordinance and Decree of the Apostles, and of
the Roman Church ever since Anacletus days, That men should communicate every
day, De frequenti communione c. 4.
says Madridus the Jesuit. But now, Videtur relictum arbitrio cuiuslibet: it
seems to be left to every man's choice, whether he will do so or no, as the In
cap. peracta de consecrat. d. 2.
Glosser notes.

In old World, this Canon stood in force, Conc. Agathense, Can. 18.
Seculares qui in Natali Domini, Pascha, Pentecoste, non communicauerint, nec
inter Catholicos numerentur: Those Laymen who do not communicate at
Christ-masse, Easter, and Whitsuntide, shall not be called, nor held for
Catholics. But their Decree consuetudine abrogatus est; is repealed by a
contrary custom, Instit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 5. cap. 19.
says Azorius.

In old World, they were wont to break the Sacramental bread. And, Ecclesia
Graeca, and Ethiopica reti^^^ veterem illam consuetudinem: The Greek and
Ethiopian Church retains that ancient custom still, Comment. in Act. 2.
says Lorinus. But now, Non vsurpatur fractio, sed singuli panes, seu minores
hostiae consecrantur ad vitandum periculum decidentiu^ micaerum; there is no
breaking of bread used, but little Wafer-Cakes are consecrated, and delivered
whole, for fear, that if they were broken, some crummes should fall to the
ground, Ibid.
says the same man.

In old World, Chrysostom. Hom. 18. in 2. Cor.
the people had as good a share of the Communion bread as the Priest had: But
now the Laity and such of the Clergy as consecrate not, are taught, That they
must be content with a lesser Host than that which the consecrating Iorinus
loc. citat.
Priest has.

In old World, the tradition of the Romish Church was such, Innocent. 1. in
Epist. ad Decent. cap. 4.
That they did not consecrate upon any Friday or Saturday thorow-out the year.
But now, the Papists consecrate every day, save only on Good Friday.

In old World, the Papists (on Sheare-Thursday) might have celebrated the
Communion, though they had not bin fasting: for, vt Sacramentum Altaris non
nisi a ieiunis hominibus celebretur, excepto vno die anniuersario, quo Coena
Domini celebratur, was Can. 29.
decreed by the third Council at Carthage. But now, hac Decreti posterior pars
abrogatur: this latter part of the Decree is repealed, Anton. Aug. de Emendat.
Great. lib. 1. Dial. 16. page 138.
as Papists confess.

In old World (as Papists say) it was decreed, That such as received the
Sacrament, should fast certain hours after. But this, hodie non seruatur, sed
paulo post comedi potest, secundum Thomam, says In Sum. verb. Lex. 13.
quaeritur.
Siluester. Consuetudo sieve praecep^um nihil comedendi post susceptionem
Eucharistiae, per contrariam consuetudinem abrogatum est: The custom or
commandment of not eating after the receiving of the Sacrament, is abrogated
by a contrary custom, Part. 1. quaest. in 4. Sentent. q. de suscip. Euch.
difficult. 4.
says Josephus Angles.

In old World, Omnes simul psallebant in Ecclesia: All Christians sung together
in the Church. Yet now, soli Cleri^i canunt: the Clerks only sing, as Lib. 2.
de verbo Dei. cap. 16. and lib. 1. de boni^ (...)peribus in partio. cap. 16.
Bell. confesses. Yea, though the (...) To(...). Conc. Not. in Conc. Iaodic.
Can. 11. p. 293.
Papists confess, that it was given in commandment by Saint Paul, Vt fideles
in suis conuentibus Psalmis and Hymnis alternatim cord simul and ore
decantatis Deum laudent: That the faithful in their Assemblies should in their
turns praise God with heart and voice, by singing of Psalms: yet Idem. ibid.
they tell us, that Ecclesiastica instit optime prouisum est, ne praeter certos
ad hoc inscriptes, alij in Ecclesia psallerent: It is excellently well provided
for by the orders of the Church, that none shall sing but a set number
appointed for that purpose, viz. Priests, Clerks, and Quiristers.

In old World, even ab initio naescentis Ecclesiae, populus post recitatas
preces, respondebat, Amen: from the first birth of the Church, the common
people at the end of prayers, said Amen, as De Rit. Eccl. lib. 2. cap. 17. nu.
2. ser. Baron. Annal. Tom. 1. ad An. 60. nu. 28.
Durantus proves. But now with Papists, the Parish-Clerke only says Amen.

In old World, the Bible was translated into known Languages, as Bell. lib. 2.
de Verbo Dei, c. 16.
Papists confess. But now, Id ipsum fieri omnino non expedit: It is not meet
it should be so, Alfons. de Castro aduers. haer. li. 1. cap. 13. Sixth. Senens.
lib. 6. Annal, 152.
say they.

In old World, it was ordered, That no books should be read in the Church,
nisi solos libros noui and vet. Test. but the Books of the Old and New
Testament. But, hodie quorumlibet somnia, imo muliercularum deliramenta
leguntur inter diuinas Scripturas: At this day every idle bodies dreams, and
old wives fancies are read with the Canonical Scriptures, Schol. in Catal.
script. Eccl. Hieron. verto Ephraen.
says Erasmus.

In old World, Patres dicebant, ad Hebraicos vel Graecos codices recurrendum
esse: The Fathers said, we ought to have recourse to the Hebrew or to the
Greek Copies, says Instit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 8. cap. 3.
Azorius. But now, Non est quod ad Hebraica vel Graeca ex^mplaria recurramus:
There is no reason why we should do so, says Ibid.
the same man.

In old World, Bishops and Presbyters read all manner of books; heretical as
well as orthodoxall: by the Velofillus Aduertat. in 9. tom. Hieron. ad 9.
quaesitum p. 171.
Papists confession. Yet at this day, they are agreed upon this point,
Haereticorum libros non esse legendos hodie, nisi solum ad illis, quibus ex
speciali licentia summi Pontificis id concessum fuerit: Ibid.
That no man may read in these days any heretical books, except they have a
special license from the Pope. Quod partibus antiquissimis licuit, nobis non
licet; It is not lawful for us to do that, which it was lawful for the
ancient Fathers to do, Ibid.
say Papists.

In old World, he was thought to wrong a Martyr, who prayed for him: for it ran
current of old, Iniuriam facit Martyri, qui orat pro Martyr. But now, the
Papists pray for them whom they account Martyrs, for, pro celeberrimis illis
Carthusianis in Anglia Martyribus, totus, ordo Carthusiae per orbem Christianum
diffusus, consuetas pro defunctis preces ad Deum fudit; The whole Order of the
Carthusian Monks thorow-out the world, said their ordinary prayers for the
dead, for those famous Carthusian Monks who were martyred in England, says
Resp. Quodlibet ad 3. quaest. dict. Louanij 1568. cap. 6.
Molanus: concluding, that pro nostri temporis Martyribns absque iniuria
oratur: Men may pray for the Martyrs of these days without wronging them:
giving this pretty reason hereof, Because Ibid.
plerunque sunt imperfecti Martyrs: The most of the Martyrs in our time are
poor Martyrs, such are all your Tyburne Martyrs.

In old World, Leo the First said, Epist. 63. tom. 1. Conc. apud Binnium, page
970.
Non permittendum est vt quisquam extra Sacerdotalem ordinem constitutus,
gradum sibi praedicatoris assumat: It is not to be suffered that any who is not
Priested should preach. But now the Popes of Rome dispense with Jesuits,
Lay-Iesuites, who are not Priested, to preach, as De Ritibus Eccl. Cathol. lib.
2. cap. 25. number. 7.
Durantus witnesses.

In old World, Imperator congregabat Concilia: The Emperor called Counsels,
says a Franc. Zabarel. de schismat. P^nt.
Cardinal of France Tempore magni Constantini and aliorum Augustorum ad
congreganda Concilia non quaesitus est magnopere Roman assensus Papae: In the
time of Constantine the Great, and other Emperors, the Bishop of Rome his
assent was not greatly required to the calling of a Council, says De gest.
Conc. Basil. lib. 1. p^. 20.
Aeneas Siluius. But now it is Bell. lib. 1. de Conc. cap. 12.
ouer-ruled, That calling of Councels belongs to the Pope, and not to the
Emperor.

In old World, A tempore Apostolorum per multos annos, etiam per aliquot
secula, Presbyteri et Diocam omnes ad Concilia vocabantur: From the Apostles
times, for many years, yea for many ages, all Elders (Priests if you will) and
Deacons were called unto Councels, as Lib. 1. de Cleicis, cap. 16.
Bellarm* confesses. But now, either few or none are called. Now Bishops only
are the Domini facientes totum.

In old World, Reges ac Imperatores non adfuisse tantum Synodo, sed praefuisse
legimus: We read that Kings and Emperors were not only present at Councels,
but as Presidents of them, De suc. Eccl. Minist. li. 1. c. 20.
says Duaren. And so much may be gathered out of Marcianus the Emperors
words, which are to be found in d. 96. Nos ad fidem.
Gratian. But Bell. lib. 1. de Conc. cap. 19.
now, the Pope must needs be President, either in his own person, or by his
Deputy.

In old World, primis sexcentis veloctingentis annis, summi Pontifices cogebant
Concilia Nationalia Episcoporum Italiae: for the space of six hundred or eight
hundred years after Christ, the Bishops of Rome, for the weightier matters of
the Church, called National Councels of the Bishops of Italy, as Lib. 1. de
Clericis, cap. 16.
Bell. confesses. But now they have left that. Now the Pope and his Cardinals
dispatch all, as Ibid.
Bell. tells us.

In old World, before Gregory the First his days, Lent always began on that
day which we call the First-Sunday in Lent, as Instit. moral. part. 1. lib. 7.
c. 12. 2. quaeritur.
AZorius proves well. But now, all men know, theirs begins on Ash Wednesday.

In old World, Lent was thought to end upon Palme-Sunday: for Quadragesima
impletur ad Festum Palmaru^, says Quaest. in script. q. 77. Col. 98. Tom. 1.
Bibl. vet. pat. edit. 3.
Anastasius Nicaenus. But now, theirs is thought to end upon Easter-euen.

In old World, it was decreed, Gratian. d. 4. Statuimus.
That the Clergy should have one week more in their Lent than the Laity. But
now this Decree is out of force, says Instit. moral. part. 1. lib. 5. cap. 19.
page 399.
Azorius: Clerici hodie non servant, sed initium faciunt i^iuniorum vt Lays:
The Clergy keep not this Decree, but begin Lent when the Laity begin it, says
De emendat. Great. lib. 1. dial. 16. page 134.
Antonius Augustinus.

In old World, Wednesday was commanded to be a Fasting-day, as Lib. 2. de bonis
operibus in party. cap. 17.
Bell. and Instit. moral. part. 1. lib. 7. cap. 15. 3. quae^itur.
Azorius prove fully. But now, a man may eat flesh upon Wednesday, by both
their confessions.

In old World, Ser. Bell. de bonis operibus in partic. lib. 2. cap. 20.
they fasted at Rome in the time of Aduent. But now they use not to fast then.

In old World, they might drink no wine on Fasting-dayes; for veteres Canones
vinum interdixere diebus ieiuniorum; The old Canons forbade wine on
Fasting-dayes, says De Abstinant* doctrine. Cathol. cap. 4.
Alfonsus Pisanus. But Azorius instit. moral. part. 1. lib. 7. cap. 10. 7.
quaeritur.
now Papists drink, and may drink wine, hold belly, hold.

In old World, Pisanus loco citato.
veteres Canones interdixere siceram, and omne quod inebriare potest, and
mulsam, and cerui^iam: It was not lawful to drink any liquor which might
intoxicate a man's brains. But Azor. loco citato.
now no liquor is exempted on fasting-dayes.

In old World, veteres Canones interdixere Pisces: the ancient Canons forbade
fish on fasting-dayes, says Ibid.
Pisanus. But now, Piscibus vti licet: a man of their Church, may lawfully eat
fish, says the same Ibid.
Pisanus.

In old World, they who fasted, ate but one meal on a day: for, Vnicam in
ieiunio refectionem esse debere, exempla Scripturarum, testimonia Patrum, and
perpetua consuetudo fidelium probant: The examples in Scriptures, the
testimonies of the Fathers, and the continual practice of the faithful, prove
they should have no more, says Lib. 2. de bonis operibus in pertit. cap. 2.
Bellarmine. But Azor. instit. moral. part. 1. lib. 7. cap. 8. 4. and 7.
quaeritur.
now, over and besides a dinner, men may have at night refectiunculam, or
collationem, as some of them call it: indeed, a banquet (for it consists of
fruits, and sweetmeats) upon a fasting-day. Yea, they may have this, though
refectiunculae nocturnae veteribus prorsus ignotae: Such night-banquets were
altogether unknown to antiquity, says Loco supra citato.
Pisanus.

In old World, they used not on fasting-dayes to take their meal before night,
or toward night; Apud veteres inauditum est prorsus vt ante horam 9. quae est
tertia post merid. ieinnium quodcunque soluatur: It was never heard of among
the Ancients, that any Fast ended before three of the clock in the
afternoon, says Loco supra citato.
Bell. But now, Jeiunium in vesperam vsque prorogari solitum, in meridiem
transtulit Ecclesia: The Popish Church allows men on fasting-dayes to take
their meal at noone, which was wont to be* taken at night, as In Epist. de
delectu ciborum ad Episc. Basil. cap. 11. loco supra citato.
Erasmus notes. Suppers are changed into dinners, says Bellarmine.

In old World, Vt constat ex Patribus, praesertim Ambrosio, Augustino, Leone,
ieiunia cum Eleemosynis, precibus and vigilijs de more coniung ebantur: Fasting
was accompanied with Alms, with prayer, with watching, as the Fathers
testify, especially Ambrose, Austin, and Leo, says Instit. moral. part. 1.
lib. 7. cap. 20. 9. quaeritur.
A Zorius. But now, Vsu and more vigiliae sunt sublatae, and consuetudine
factum est, vt ieiunia nostra careant illis comitibus quos extra solebat
habere, nimirum precibus, and ele^mosynis: Watching is out of use, and so is
prayer, and alms: fasting walks by it self: it has lost his old companions,
as the same Ibid.
Azorius confesses.

In old World, Formula ieiunij prisci vere Christiana: The manner of fasting
was truly Christian. But, Ieiunia Catholicorum passim Epicurea: the manner of
fasting observed by Papists at this day, is Epicurean-like, as Panopl. lib. 3.
cap. 11.
Bishop Lindan confesses.

In old World, d. 93. a Subdiacono.
Abbots were inferior to the meanest of the Clergy, even to dog-keepers, or
doore-keepers, as they call them. But now, Abbots are next to Bishops: and some
of them are Bishops fellows, Cassan^eus Catal. gloria mundi, part. 4. consid.

entitled not as the ordinary sort, Reuerend^ Patres, Reverend Fathers: but
Reuerendi Patres in Christo; Reverend Fathers in Christ.

In old World, d. 93. a Subdiacono.
Monks were underlings to Abbots: even then when Abbots were underlings to
doore-keepers. But now Monks have gotten the precedence of most of the Clergy,
as Institut. moral. part. 1. lib. 12. cap. 19. 11. quaeritur.
AZorius confesses.

In old World, Monks lived in Wildernesses, remote from all press of people,
as out of the world: which the Du^ren. de sac. Eccl. Minist. ac benesic. lib.
1. cap. 20. Polyd. Virgil. de invent. rerum lib. 7. cap. 1.
Papists themselves are driven to confess, as sufficiently proved by Saint
Hierom: for, Epist. ad Paulin. de institut. Monachi.
Si cupis esse quod diceris, Monachus. 1. solus: quid facis in vrbibus, quae
vbique non sunt solorum habitacula, sed multorum: If thou desire to be that
indeed which thou art called, a Monk, that is, a solitary person: what do
thou mean to live in a City, which is not a place for solitary persons, but
for such as love good-fellowship, says Saint Hierome? Upon which a Popish In
cap. 16. q. 1. Si cupis.
glozer (...), Quod Monasteria non sunt constrai(...) in vrbibus: There should
be no Monasteries in Cities. But now there are Monasteries in Cities: and as
much good fellowship among Monks, as among good-fellowes of the Town. The
case is now altered. A Monk is a merry fellow.

In old World, Socrates hist. 4. cap. 1^. Duaren. lib. and cap. sup. citat.
Monks lived by the labor of their hands. The Monk that labored not with
his hands for his living, was reputed a Thief. But now Monks live either
altogether idly, or after another manner than in old time. They cannot away to
work.

In old World, Monks were in no degree of Church-Ministery. Monachos vsque ad
tempus Eusebij, SoZimi, and Siricij, Monachos simpliciter and non Clericos
fuisse, Ecclesiastica testatur Historia: The Ecclesiastical Histories
witness, that til about. EuZebius, Sozimus, and Siricius days, Monks were
Monks only, and not of the Clergy, says Cap. 16. q. 1. post. cap. 39. Hinc
est.
Gratian: Primum Monachi omnes, etiam Abbates Laici erant: At the first all
Monks, yea and Abbots, were Lay persons, says Instit. moral. part. 1. lib.
12. cap. 19. 11. quaeritur.
Azoriu^, Loco supra citato.
Duaren, and others. But now, Azorius loco citato.
Vsus obtinuit vt Monachi, ijsdem atque Clerici muneribus and Officijs in
Ecclesia fungerentur; The Monks are turned Clerks, and do all the offices
belonging unto the Clergy.

In old World, Monks were of sparing diet: for, Conuiuia fugias, sit vilis and
vespertinu^ cibus, etc. Take heed of feasting, and let thy meat be of the
worst, and eat it toward evening, etc. says Epist. ad Paulin. de instit.
Monachi.
Saint Hierome: giving his opinion how Monks should be dieted. But now Monks
have so pleasant and large fare, and so many meals, that their fatness and
great bellies are grown into a proverb.

In old World, Monks were not notorious by singular weed, but every (...) ware
such apparel as he thought good, so it were decent. They were not tied to
this or that, which made them markeable in the streets as they went: for, in
vest nulla discretia, nulla admiratio: vtcunque placuerit incedere, nec
detractionis est, nec laudis, says Epistol. ad Marcellum, vt co^migret*
Bethle^m.
Saint Hierome, speaking of a Monk. But now, as there (...)
