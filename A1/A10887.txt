Cum priuilegio Regali, ad imprimendum solum.

An admonicion to the reader.
FOr so much as we have enterprysed the interpretation of this present book,
offering and dedicatyng it unto our most gracyous and virtuous Queen Kateryn
only, by it myndyng and tenderyng the vtilite and wealth of all women, as
touching the great parell and dangeours, which most commenly oppresses them
in their paynefull labors. I require all such men in the name of God, which
at any time shall chaunse to have this book, that they use it godly, and only
to the profet of their neighbors, utterly eschuynge all rebawde and unseemly
communicacion of any things contained in the same, as they will answer before
God, which as witnesses Christ, will require a count of all ydell words,
and much more then of all rebawde and uncharitable words. Every thing, as
says Solomon, has his time, and truly that is far out of time, yea and
far from all good honesty, that some use at the commune tables and without
any difference before all companyes rudelye and leudelye to talk of such
things, in the which they ought rather to know much, and to say little,
but only where it may do good, magnifyeng the mighty God of nature in all his
works, compassionatynge and pytyenge our even Christians, the women which
sustain and endure for the time so great dolor and pain for the birth of
mankind and delyueraunce of the same in to the world.

Praise God in all his works.
Unto the most gracious / and in all goodness most excellent virtuous Lady
Queen Katheryne / wife and most derely beloved spouse unto the most mighty
sapient Christen prince / King Henry the.viii. Richard Jonas wyssheth
perpetual joy and felicyte.
WHere as of late (most excellent virtuous Queen) many goodly and proper
treatise / as well concerning holy scripture / wherein is contained the only
comfort and consolacio^ of all godly people: as other profane arts and
sciences right necessary to be known and had in use / have been by the
paynefull dyligence of such clerks which have embusyed them in the same very
earnestlye and circumspectlye set forth in this our wulgare English tunge /
to the great enrytchynge of our mother langage / and also the great vtilite
and profet of all people using the same / and among all other things / out
of the noble science of Phisyke have been diverse / proper / and profitable
matters compyled and translated from the Laten tunge in to English / by the
reading of the which right many have confessed them selfs to have received
great light and knowledge of such things in the which they have found no small
comfort and profet. And in this behalf there is in the Laten speech a book
entytled / departu hominis: that is to say / of the birth of mankind /
compyled by a famous doctor in Physycke / called Eucharius / the which he
wrote in his own mother tunge / that is being a Germayn / in the Germayne
speech / afterward by an other honest clarke / at the request and desire of
his friend transposed in to Laten: the which book for the syngular vtilite and
profete that ensues unto all such as read it / and most spetiallye unto all
women (for whose only cause it was written) has been sithe in the Doutche
and French speech set forth and emprynted in great number / so that there be
few matrones and women in that parts / but (if they can read) will have this
book always in readynesse: considering then that the same commodite and
profet which they in their regyons do obtain by enioyng of this little book in
their maternall langage / might also ensue unto all women in this noble realm
of England / if it be set forth in the English speech / as concerning this /
I have done my simple endeavor for the love of all womanhode / and chieflye
for the most bound service / the which I owe unto your most gracyous
hyghnes to translate the same into our tunge. Most humbly desyryng first your
graces hyghnes / and then consequentlye all noble ladies and gentylwomen with
other honest matrones to accept my pains and good will employed in the same:
the which thing as I do not doubt for the woonte and incomperable benignite
/ goodness / and gentylnes inset and planted in your graces nature / so shall
it be no little encourragynge unto me hereafter with farther deliberation and
pains to reuyse and ouerse the same again / and with much more diligence / to
set it forth. For considering the manyfolde / daily / and imminente
daungeorus and parelles / the which all manner of women of what estate or degree
so ever they be in their labor do sustain and abide: yea many times with
parell of their life / of the which there be to many examples nedelesse here
to be rehearsed. I thought it should be a very charytable and laudable deed: yea
and thankefullye to be accepted of all honorable and other honest matrons / if
this little treatise so fruitful and profitable for the same purpose were
made Englysh / so that by that means it might be read and understand of them
all / for as touching mydwyfes / as there be many of them right expert /
dilligent / wise / circumspecte / and tender about such business: so be there
again many mo full vndyscreate / unreasonable / chorleshe / and far to seek
in such things / the which should chieflye help and socoure the good women
in their most paynefull labor and thronges. Through whose rudeness and
rasshenesse only I doubt not / but that a great number are cast away and
destroyed (the more petye.) For this cause and for the honor of almighty god /
and for the most bound service / the which I owe unto your grace / most
gracyous and virtuous Queen / I have judged my labor and pains in this behalf
right well bestowed / requyrynge all other women of what estate so ever they be
/ which shall by reading of the same find light and comfort to yield and
render thanks unto your most gracyous hyghnes / wysshyng greatly that it
might please all honest and motherlye mydwyfes dylygently to read and ouerse
the same / of the which although there be many / which do know much more
peradventure / then is here expressed / yet am I sure in the reading of it /
their understanding shall be much cleared and have some what farther
perceueraunce in the same. It is no small charge the which they take upon them
/ for if when any strange or peryllous case does chanse / the mydwyfe be
ignorant / or to seek in such things which are to be had in remembrance in
that case / then is the party lost and utterly does perysshe / for lack of
due knowledge requysite to be had in the mydwyfe. Wherefore I beseech almyghtye
God / that this my simple industrye and labor may be through your grace unto
the vtilite / wealth / and profet / of all English women / according to my
utter and hartye desire and entente / to whom also I daily pray long to
preserve and prospere your most gracyous hyghnes both to the contynuall
comfort and consolacion of our most redoubted and without co^paryson most
excellent Christen Prince / and also the joy and gladness of all his loving
subjects.

Amen.

be had only at the Apothecaries / being of them right well known wherefore when
ye shall need any such thing if ye send the same names in your byll to the
apothecaries they will soon speed your purpose: neither do this if ye may
without the advice of some expert and well learned physytiane.

Here after begins the first book.
THE FIRST BOOK.
THE FIRST After what manner and fasshyon the birth lyethe in the mothers
womb, and how many caules it is compassed and wrapped in. Cap.i.
IN so much as our intent is in this book following to entreat and speak of
the birth of mankind / and of such things which happen and chaunse to the
mother in her labor and travail / in the deliverance of the same / it shall be
first very necessary to show after what manner and fasshyon the infant lies
in the mothers womb / and in how many caules the same is lapped and wrapped:
to the farther knowledge and perceuerance of such things the which we shall
entreat of hereafter.

wherefore ye shall understand that the birth lies in the mother after this
manner: First it lies rownde in manner as a bowl the hands being between the
knees / and the hedde lenyng on the knees: either of the eyes ioynynge upon
either of the knees: the right eye upon the right knee: and the left upon
the left / the noose dependyng between the knees / so that the face and
foreparte of the infant is toward the inward parts of the woman / lyenge in
manner vpryght in the mothers matryce.

Farther ye must understand that there be three coueres or caules in the
which the birth is contained and lapped: of the which the one compassyth and
embrasyth rownd about the birth / and the other two caules also: and it is
called the secondyne second birth or the after birth: the which defends
the birth from noysum and ill humors encreasynge in the matryce after
conception by retensyon of the flowers otherwise wont to pass and issue
furthe ones in the monethe / the which ill humors if they should touch or
come nere to the birth would greatly peryshe and hurt the same. But after the
deliverance of the pryncipall birth these humors also with the foresaid caul
or secondyne issue furthe / and is called the after birth.

The second caul with the which the birth is coueryd / compasses the same
birth from the nauyll down ward / covering all the inferyour parts of the
infant / and this skin or caul is as it were fulle of plyghtes and wrynkles:
and through this caul the birth is defended and kept from ill and sharp
humors as vryne or pysse yssuynge from the infant and swette. etc. for so
long as the child is in the mothers womb it sends furthe urine / not by
the due members but by the vain which proceeds out of the navel.

The third shynne or caul likewise contains all the birth in it defending
also the same from humors and vryne: and from the boystesnes of the secondyne
or first caul and this is called the armoure or defense of the birth.

This is the manner of the sytuation and lodgyng of the infant in the mothers
bellye: and these be the three caules contaynynge and enclosyng in the birth.
Now will we speak of the time of birth.

Of the time of birth, and which is called natural or unnatural. Cap.ii.
ANd when the time of birth approchyth nere / most commenly these signs
following come before: by the which the time of labor is known to be at hand.

First certain dolours and pains begin to grow about the guts / the
navel / and in the raynes of the back / and likewise about the thyghes and
the other places being nere to the privy parts / which likewise then
begins to swell and to burn and to expel humors / so that it gives
plain and evident token that the labor is nere.

But ye shall note that there is two manner of byrthes / the one called
natural / the other contrary to nature. Natural birth is when the child is
borne both in due season and also in due fashion. The due season is most
commenlye after the.ix. month or about.xl. wekes after the conception /
although some be delivered sometimes in the seuenthe month / and the child
proves very well. But such as are borne in the eight month / other they be
dead before the birth / or else live not long after / as the noble medicine
Auicenna does testifye.

The due fashion of birth is this / according as witnesses Albert the great
/ first the head comes forward / then follows the neck and shouldes / the
arms with the hands lyenge close to the body toward the fete / the face and
forepart of the child being toward the face and foreparte of the mother / as
it appears in the first of the birth fygures. For as Albertus writes / and
as we have rehearsed before also / before the time of delyueraunce the child
lies in the mothers womb the face and breast being toward the back of the
mother / but when it should be delivered / it is turned clean contrary / the
head downewarde / the fete upward / and the face toward the mothers bellye /
and that if the birth be natural. Another thing also is this / that if the
birth be natural / the delyuerance is easy without long taryenge or
lokynge for it.

The birth contrary to nature is / when the mother is delivered before her
time / or out of due season / or after any other fashion then is here
specyfyed before / as when both legs proceed first / or one alone / with
both the hands up / or both down / other else the one up and the other down
/ and diverse otherwise as shall be hereafter more clearly declared

Of easy, and uneasy, difficull, or dolorous delyueraunce, and the causes of
it, with the sygues how to know, and forese the same. Cap.iii.
VEry many be the parelles / dangerous and stronges which chanse to women in
their labor / which ensue and come in diverse ways / and for diverse causes /
such as I shall here declare.

First when the woman that laboreth is conceived over young / as before.xii.
ye or.xv. year of aege / which cha^seth sometime / though not very often / and
that the passage be over angust streate or naro we / other naturally / or else
for some disease and infirmite / which may happen about that part / as
apostumes / pusshes / pyles / or blysterres / and such other / through the
which causes nature can not (but with great dolor and pain) open and dilate
it self to the expellynge and delyuerance of the child. And sometime the
vesyke or bladder / or other intralles being about the matrice or womb be also
apostumat and blystered / which being greaued / the matrice or womb likewise
is greaued with them / and that hyndereth greatly the deliverance. Also
sometime in the fundament are emerrodes or pyles and other pusshes / chappynges
or chynnes which cause great pain / also hardness and difficulte or byndynge
of the belly / which things for the grefe and pain that ensues of them
causes the woman to have little power to help herself in her labor.

Farthermore if the party be weke and of feeble complexion / or of nature very
cold / or to young / or very aged / or to gross and fat / or contrary wise
to spare and lean / or that she never had child before / or that she be over
timorous and fearful / diverse waywarde / or such one as will not be ruled /
remouyng her self from one place to another / all such things causes the
labor to be much more pain full / cruel / and dolorous / then it would
otherwise be. Also ye must understand that generallye the birth of the man is
easyer then the birth of the female.

Item if the child be of a fuller and greater grows than that it may
easelye pass that narowe passage / or contrary wise / if it be so faint /
weak / and tender / that it can not turn it self / or does it very slowly /
or if the woman have two children at ones / other else that it with the which
she laboreth be a menster / as for example / if it have but one body and two
heddes / as appears in the.xvij. of the birth fygures / such as of late was
seen in the dominion of werdenberghe.

Again when it proceeds not in due time or after due fashion / as when it
comes forth with both fete or both knees together / or else with one foot
only / or with both fete downewarde and both hands upward / other else (the
which is most perellous) sydelong / arselonge / or backelonge / other having
two at a birth / both proceed with their fete first / or one with his fete and
the other with his head / by those and diverse other ways the woman susteyneth
great doloure pain and anguysh.

Item if the woman suffer aborsme^t / that is to say bring forth her child
in the.iiii. or v. month after the conception / which is before the due time
/ in this case it shall be great pain to her / for so much as (according to
Galenus saying) in that time the entrance of the womb is so firmly and
strongely enclosed / that scace the point of a nedle may enter in at it.

Also if the child be dead in the mothers bellye it is a very perellous thing
/ forsomuche as it can not be easily turned / another can it weld or help it
self to come forth / or if the child be sick or weakened / so that it can not
for feablenesse help it self. The which thing may be foresene and known
by these tokens: If the woman with child have been long sick before her labor
/ if she have been sore laxed / if after her conception she have had daily and
vnwontly her flowers / if streate after one month upon the conception her
breasts yield any milk / if the child steare not ne move at such time as is
convenient for it: these be tokens that it should be very weak. By what
tokens ye shall know it is dead / I shall show you in the nynth chapter
hereafter.

Also there is great parell in laboring / when the secondyne or latter birth
is over fyrme or strong / and will not sone ryue or break asunder / so that
the child may have his easy coming forth. And contrary wise when it is over
weak slender or thynne / so that it breaks asunder before that the child be
turned or apt to issue forth / for then the humors which are collecte and
gathered to gether about this secondyne or secoside birth pass away sooner then
it should do / and the birth shall lack his due humidite and moystenes /
which should cause it the ^^selyar to proceed and with less pain.

The birth also is hindered by over much cold or over much heete / for in
over much cold the passage and all other powers of the laboring woman be
coarted and made narrower then they would otherwise be. Likewise over much
heat debiliteth / weakeneth and faynteth both the woman and the child / so
that neither of them in that case can well welde or help them selfs for
faintness.

And forther if the woman have used to eat commenly such meat or fruytes /
which do exiccat or dry and constrayne or bind / as medlars / chestenuttes /
all sour fruit / as trabbes / chokeperes / and such other / with over much
use of vergers / and such like sour sauces / with rise myll / and many other
things / all this shall greatly hinder the birth.

Also the use of cold bathes after the.v. month following the conception or to
bathe in such water where alome is / iron / or salt / or any such things
which do coarcte and constrayne / or if she have been oftentimes heavy and
murnyng / or ill at ease / or if she have been kept over hungrye and thurstye /
or have used over much watch and walkinge / other if she used a little before
her labor things of great odor smell or sauoure / for such things attracte
and draw up ward the mother or matrice / the which is great hynderaunce to
the birth.

Also if the woman feel pain only in the back and above the navel and not
under / it is sign of hard labor / likewise if she ware wont to be delivered
with great pain in times passed / is a sign of great labor always in the
birth.

Now signs and tokens of an expedite and easy delyueraunce be such as be
contrary to all those that go before. As for example / when the woman has been
wont in times passed easelye to be (...) that in her labor she feale but
little thronge or dolor / or though she have great pains / yet they remain
not always in the vppar parts / but descend to the nether parts or botome of
the bellye.

And to be short in all paynefull and troublesome labors / these signs
betoke^ and signify good speed and luck in the labor: unquietness / much
stearynge of the child in the mothers belly / all the thronges and pains
tomblynge in the fore part of the botome of the bellye / and when the woman is
strong and mighty of nature / and such as can well and strongelye help her
self to the expellynge of the birth. And again evil signs be those / when
she swetethe cold sweet: and that her pulces beat and labor over sore / and
that she her self in the laboring faint and swowne: these be unlucky and
mortal signs.

How a woman with child shall use herself, and what remedies be fo^^ them
that have hard labor. Cap.iiii.
T^ (...) such as are in such difficull parell of labor / as we have spoken of
before / ye must observe / keep and mark those things which we shall (by the
grace of god) show you in this chapter following. First the woman with child
must keep two dyettes / the one a monethe before her labor / the other in the
very laboring / and above all things she must exchue and forbear all such
things which may hinder the birth so nere as she can possible / the which we
rehearsed in the chapter before / but if there be any such thing which can
not be avoided / for so much as it comes by nature or by long contynuance and
custom: in this case yet ye shall use some such remedies / the which may
somewhat assuage it / mollifye it / or make it more easy or tolerable / so
that it hinder the birth so much the less.

But if it so be / that any infirmity or disease / swellyng / or other
apostumation chanse about the mother or the preuy part / or about the vesyke
or bladder / as the stone / the strangurye / and such like: the which things
may cause such straytenesse and coarctation that uneath great and horrible
pain / the party can be delivered or discharged: in these cases it behouethe
such things to be looked unto and cured before the time of labor commethe / by
the advise of some expert Surgion.

Also if the woman be over much constipat / or bound all ways / she must
use the monethe before her labor such things / the which may lemfye /
mollifye / dissolve / and loose the bellye: as aples fried with sugre taken
fasting in the morning / and after that a draughte of pure wine alone / or
else tempered with the juice of sweet and ripe apples. Also to eat fygges in
the morning fasting and at night / loosethe well the bellye.

Again in this case she must refrain from all such things as do harden /
restraynt / and constipat: as be such things / the which be browled or
roasted / and rise / hard eggs and myll / and such like.

Also if farther necessite require she may receive a clyster / but it must be
very gentell and easy tempered other with cheken brothe or brothe of other
flesh: she may use also some other easy and temperat purgation to mollifye
and loose her with all: also a suppositar tempered with soap / larde / or the
yolke of eggs.

And if it chaunse that (the labor drawing nere) she wax faynte or syckelye:
then must ye comfort her with good comfortable meat / drink / wholesome and
noble electuaries / and in this time must she do all such things the which
can make her apt and sufficient to her labor / and to use such things the
which may laxe / open / and mollifye the nature and passage / so that the
birth may the more freely proceed: and that chieflye in the younger women. The
elder women for because that / that parts in them be somewhat dryer and harder
/ therefore they must use hot and moist things which have properte to lenifye
and sople / and that both in meat and drink / and also in outward
fomentations / bathynges / suppositaries and anoyntme^tes: Anoyntmentes
wherewith ye may sople the privy place / be these: hens grese / duckes
grese / goose grese / also oil olyfe / or lynesede oil / or oil of fenegreke
/ or the viscosite of holyoke and such other / and for drink let her use good
type wine mixed with water: also there must be a consideration in the dietynge
of the woman / that she may use such things the which may moysten her / and
not make her fat. Contrarye-wyse let her avoid such things the which
should exiccat dry constrayne or coarte her: and that all the monethe before
her labor. But about.x. days before the time (if she feel any pain or grefe)
let her use every day to wash or bathe her with warm water / in the which
also that she tarry not over long in bathing for weakening of her: in the bath
let her stand so chat the water come above the navel a little / and let be
sodde in the water mallows / holyoke / camomell / mercurye / maydenhere /
lynesede / fenegreke sede / and such other things which have virtue to
mollifye and suple: and if it so be that for weakness of the body she may
not endure this bathing in warm water / then with a sponge or other cloth
dypped in the foresaid bathe / let her sokynglye wash her fete / her thyghs /
and her pryuy parts / the which thing shall greatly profet to her. But in
such time beware ye come not in the common hot houses / for they would cause
you to be feeble and faynte / which ware ill in this case.

And when ye are thus bathed or washed / then shall it be very convenient for
you to annoynte with the foresaid greses and oils your back / belly /
navel / sides / and such places as are nere to the preuy^e parts. Farthermore
it shall be greatelye profitable for her to conueye inward in to the preuye
part these foresaid oils or greses with a sponge or other thing made for
the purpose / she lyenge vpryght the mids of her body most highest / so that it
may the better remain within her / and that chieflye / if the matrice be dry
/ other else the party very lean and spare.

It shall be also very profitable for her to suffume the nether places with
musk / ambre / gallia muscata / which put on embers yield a goodlye savor
/ by the which the nether places open the^ self and draw downwarde.

Also as I said before / she must take good head to her dyette / that she take
things the which may comfort and strenghten the body / feadynge not over
much of any thing / and to drink pleasant and well sauerynge wine / or
other drink / also moderatly to exersyce the body in doing some thing /
stearynge / mouinge / going / or standing / more then other wise she was wo^t
to do: these things farther the birth and make it the easyer: and this is the
manner of dyette the which we advise the woman to keep the month before her
labor or longer.

Another dyette there is / the which she ought to observe in the time of labor
/ when the storms and thronges begin to come on / and the humors / which yet
hitherto have remained about the matrice or mother collected / now begin to
flow forth: and this manner of dyette consysteth in two sorts. First that
such things be procured and had in redynesse which may cause the birth or
labor to be very easy. Secondly to withstand / defend and to put away so
nere as may be the instant and present dolours. And as touching this point /
it shall be very profitable for her for the space of an hour to sit still / the^
rysyng again to go up and down a pair of stayres cryeng or reaching so loud
as she ca^ / so to stere herself.

Also it shall be very good for a time to retain and keep in her brethe / for
because that through that means the guts and intralles be thrust to gether
and depressed downward. Also it shall be very good to receive the same medicine
/ the which we shall describe hereafter / for that medicine expellethe and
sends forth the birth.

But when the woman perceaueth the matrice or mother to wax laxe or loose /
and to be dyssolued / and that the humors issue forth in great plente / then
shall it be mete for her to sit down lenynge backewarde in manner vpryght. For
the which purpose in some regio^s (as in France and Germanye) the mydwyfes have
stools for the purpose / which being but low and not hye from the ground
/ is made so compase wise and cave or holowe in the mids / that that may be
received from underneath which is looked for: and the back of the stool
lenyng backewarde / receauethe the back of the woman / the fashion of the
which stole is set in the beginning of the birth sygures hereafter.

And when the time of labor is come / in the same stole ought to be put many
clothes or clowtes in the back of it / the which the midwife may remove from
one side to another according as necessite shall require. The mydwyfe herself
shall sit before the laboryng woman / and shall diligently obserut and wait
how much and after what manner the child stearethe it self: also shall with
her hands first anointed with the oil of almondes or the oil of white
lylies rule and direct every thing / as shall seem best. Also the mydwyfe
must enstructe and comfort the party not only refresshynge her with good
meat and drink / but also with sweet words / geuynge her good hope of a
spedefull delyueraunce / encouragyng and enstomacking her to patience and
tolleraunce / byddyng her to hold in her brethe in so much as she may / also
strekynge gentylly with her hands her belly above the nauel / for that helps
to depresse the birth downewarde.

But and if the woman be any thing gross / fat / or flesshly it shall be best
for her to lie grouelyng / for by that menes the matrice is thrust and
depressed down ward / anoyntynge also the preuy parts with the oil of white
lyllies. And if necessite require it / let not the mydwyfe be afraid ne
asshamed to handle the places and to relaxe and lose the straytes / for so
much as shall lie in her / for that shall help well to the more expedite and
quycke labor.

But this must the mydwyfe above all things take heed of that she compel not
the woman to labor / before the birth come forewarde / and show it self. For
before that time all labor is in vain / labor as much as ye list. And in this
case many times it comes to pass / that the party has labored so sore
before the time / that when she should labor in deed / her might and strength
is spent before in vain / so that she is not now able to help her self /
and that is a peryllous case.

Farthermore when the secondine or second birth (in the which the birth is
wrapped and contained) does ones appear / then may ye know that the labor is
at hand / wherefore if the same secondine break not of his own kind / it
shall be the myd wyfes part and office with her nails easily and gentely to
break it / and rent it / or if it may not so conuenientlye be done / then
reyse up between your fyngers a piece of it / and cut it of with a pair of
sheeres / or a sharp knyfe / but so that ye hurt not the birth with the
cut / this done / by and by ensues consequently the flux and flow of
humors / of the which I spoke before / and then next follows immediately the
birth.

But if it so chanse the secondine should be cut by the mydwyfe and all the
watery part yshued and spent before due time and necessite should require it /
so that the preuye passage be lest exiccat and dry / the birth not yet
appearing / and by this means the labor should be hyndered and let. In
this case ye shall annoint and mollify that preuy passage with the oil of
white lillies / or some of the greses spoken of before / first wharmed and so
conveyed in to the preuy parts the which things will cause the way to be
slypperye / sople / and easy for the birth to pass. But chiefly in this
difficulties should profette the white of an egg to gether with the yolke
powered in to that same place / which should cause it to be most slypperye and
slydynge.

And if it so be / that the birth be of a great grows / and the head stycke
in the coming forth / then must the mydwyfe help all that she may / with
her hands first anointed with some oil openyng and enlargynge the way /
that the issue may be be the frear: likewise must be done if she bare two
children at once. And all this is spoken of the natural birth when that first
proceeds the head / and then the rest of the body ordinatly / as ye mayese in
the first of the birth fygures following.

ij. But when the birth comes contrary to nature / then must the mydwyfe do
all her diligence and pain / if it may be possible / to turn the birth
tenderlye with her anointed hands / so that it may be reduced again to a
natural birth / as for example: Some time it chanseth the child to come the
legs and both arines and hands downewarde cloose to the sides first forth
/ as appearethe in the second of the birth figures / in this case the mydwife
must do all her pain with tender handelyng and annoyntyng to receive forth
the child / the legs being still close to gether / and the hands likewise
remaining / as appears in the say^e.ij. figure. How be it / it were far
better (if it may be by any means) that the mydwyfe should turn these legs
coming first forth vpwardes again by the bellywarde / so that the head
might descend downward by the back part of the womb for then naturally
again and without parell as the first might it proceed and come forth.

iii. Again sometime the birth comes forth with both legs and fete first
/ the hands being lyfted up above the head of the child / and this is the
parelloust manner of birth / that is as appears in the iij. of the birth
figures. And here must the myd wife do what she may to turn the birth if it
may be possible to the first figure / and if it will not be / must reduce the
hands of it down to the sides / and so to reduce it into the ij. figure. But
if this also will not be: then receive the feate as they come forth / and bind
them with some fair lynnen clothe / and so tenderly and very softly loose out
the birth till all be come forth / and this is a very ^copardous labor.

iiij. Also sometime the birth comes forward with one fore only / the other
being left upward / as appears in the.iiij. figure. And in this case it
behooves the laboring woman to lay her vpryght upon her back / holding up
her thyghes and belly / so that her head be the lower part of her body: then
let the mydwyfe with her hand return in again the fore that comes out
first in as tender manner as may be / and warn the woman that laboreth to
stere and move her self / so that by the mouynge and sterynge the birth may
be turned the head downewarde / and so to make a natural birth of it / and
then to set the woman in the stole again / and to do as ye did in the first
figure / but if it so be that notwithstanding the mothers stearynge and mouynge
the birth do not torn / then must the mydwyfe with her hand softelye fetch
out the other leg which remained behind / evermore taking head of this
that by handelynge of the child she do not remove ne set out of their place
the two hands hangyng downewarde toward the fete.

v. Likewise sometime it comes to pass that the side of the child comes
forward / as appears in the.v. figure / and then must the mydwyfe do so /
that it may be returned to his natural fasshion / and so to come forth.

vi. Also sometime the child comes forth the fete forward / the legs
being abroad / as in the.vi. figure / and then must the mydwyfe se / that
the fete and legs may be joined to gether / and so to proceed and come forth
/ ever more regarding the hands / as I warned you before.

vij. If it come with one of the knees or both forewarde / as in the.vij.
figure / then must the mydwyfe put up the birth / till such time as the
legs and fete come right forth / and then to do as before.

viij. When the child comes hedlonge / one of the hands coming out and
appearyng before / as in the.viij. figure / then let the birth proceed no
farther / but let the mydwyfe put in her hand and tenderlye by the shoulders
thrust in the birth again / so that the hand may be setteled in his place
again and the birth to come forth ordinatly and naturally / as in the first
figure / but if by this means the hand come not to his convenient place / then
let the woman lie vpryght with her thyghes and bellye vpwardes / and her head
downewardes / so that by that means it may be brought to pass / and then to
bring her to her seat again.

ix. But if it proceed with both hands forewardes / then must ye likewise do
as before: by the shulders thrustynge it back again / until such time as the
hands lie close to the sides / and so to come forth as appears in the.ix.
figure.

x. But when it comes arsewarde / as in the.x. figure may be seen / then
must the mydwyfe with her hands return it again / until such time that the
birth be turned / the legs and fete forward / otherels if it may so be / it
ware best that the head might come forward / and so naturallye to proceed.

xi. And if it so be that it appear and come forth first with the sholders / as
in the.xi. figure / then must ye fair and softely thrust it back again by
the sholders / till such time as the head come forewarde.

xii. But when the birth comes forth with both hands and both fete at once
/ as in the.xij. figure / then must the mydwyfe tenderly take the child by
the head / and return the legs upward / and so to receive it forth.

xiij. And when it comes brestewarde / as in the.xiij. figure / the legs and
hands bydynge behynd / then let the mydwyfe take it by the fete or by the head
/ which that shall be most apt and commodious to come forward / returning
the rest upward / and so to receive it forth / but if it may be hedlong / it
shall be best.

xiiij. Now sometime it chaunseth the woman to have two at a burden / and that
both proceed to gether headlonge / as in the xiiij. figure / and then must the
midwyfe receue the one after the other / but so that she let not slyppe the one
whylest she takes the first.

xv. If both come forth at once with their fete foreward / then must the
mydwyfe be very diligent to receive first the one / and then the other / as
has been showed before.

xvi. When the one comes hedlonge / the other fotewyse / then must the
mydwyfe help the birth that is most nerest the issue / and it that comes
fotelo^g (if she ca^) to return it upon the head / as is spoken of before /
taking ever the head / that the one be not noyso^ to the other i^ receiving
forth of either of the^.

And to be short / let the mydwyfe often times annoynte and mollifye the way
and passage with some of the foresaid oyntmentes / to make the woman's labor so
much the easyar / and have the less thronge travel and pain / and if there
chanse to be any apostume / or disease about that places in this time by such
annoyntynge to alaye and swage the pain: so that for the time it may be the
less grefe to the party / as I poke of before also / and for them that be in
this case / it shall be best to lie growelyng / as I said of the gross fat
and flesshly woman.

Remedies and Medicines by the which the labor may be made more tolerable,
easy, and without great pain. Cap.v.
ALl such things as help the birth and make it more easy / are those: First
the woman that laboreth must other sit grouling or else vpryght leaning
backewarde / according as it shall seem commodious and necessary to the
party / or as she is accustomed. And in winter or cold whether the chamber
wherein she laboreth must be warmed / but in somer or hot whether / let in the
air to refresshe her withal / lest between extreme heat and labor the woman
faint and sound / and farthermore she must be provoked to sneesynge / and that
other with the powder of Eleborus / or else of pepper. Also the sides of the
woman must be streke^ downewarde with the hands / which thing helps greatly
and farthereth / and let the mydwyfe always be very diligent prouidyng and
saying what shall be necessary for the woman / annoyntinge the priuities with
oil or other such grese as I spoke of before in this fasshion: Take the oil
of white lyllies or duckes grese / and with that temper two graynes wayghte of
Safran and one grain of musk / and with that oyntmente annoynte the secret
parts. If this profet nothing / then use this suffumigation.

Take myrrh / galbanum / castorium / let those be beten and make like pylles
of them tempered to gether with bulls gaul / then take a dram of this
pylles / and put it on hot coals / and let the woman receive the fume and
sauoure of it underneath.

Another perfume: Take yelowe brymstone / myrrh / mader / galbanum /
oppoponacum / of each like much / and temper all these to gether / making of
them pylles / and with those also ye may make fume to be received underneath.
Ite^ the fume of culuer dunge or of hawks dunge by puttyng to of oppoponacum /
is sovereign for the same. All these fumes open the poores benethe / and
causes nature to be the frear in delyueraunce.

Also it is very good to dyp wool in the juice of rue / and the same to convey
into the secreates. Also the powder of aristolochia rotu^da / or the rote
called bothor martis / or malum terre / or the sede of staphisagre: any of
these wrapped in wool and conveyed inward provoke and calls forth the
birth.

Item take heleborus / oppoponacu^ / and wrap them to gether in wool / and
ministre them inward: for that will bring forth and provoke the birth /
whether it be alive or dead. Also the rynde and bark of cassia fistula beaten
to powder / and tempered with wine and dronke^ / provoke well the birth.

Item asa fetida of the bygnes and weight of a pese myngled to gether with
castorium of the wayght of a dram^: beaten to gether and tempered with wine
myxt with water and so dronke^ / is very good to provoke the birth Also canell
drunk with wine is very good.

Item take a scruple of roses / with the water of the sede of fenegreke /
cicercula / may denhere / all beaten to gether and soden / and the oil of
blewe flower de luce a small quantite tempered there with all: and then give it
to the woman that laboreth / and it shall provoke the birth greatly. Also
cassia lignea and asa fetida drunk with wine / be very good for the same. Also
holyoke soden in water and dronke^ / is souerayn for the same purpose / and it
is very good for her to wash her in the water / in the which this holyoke is
decocte and soden in.

Certain pylles the which make the labor easy and without pain.
TAke canell or cinamome and of sauyne of each a dram^ / of cassia lignea a
dram^ and a half / of myrrh / aristolochia rotunda / and costemary of each a
dram^ / of storax liquida half a dram^ / and of oppium the wayght of.xij.
graynes / beat these all to gether / and form them into pylles / and give unto
the woman two dram^s of these pylles with.ij. ounces of good old wine.

Item Safrane and Syler Montanum provoke the birth of any living thing / if
it be droncke^: how be it to a woman give never passing a drame at once of
Safrane / for greater quantite should greatly hurt.

Item take.v. drames of Sauyne / of rue or herb grace one dragm^ and an half
/ of juniper byryes.ij. dram^s / of asa fetida / amoniacum / madder / of
each.ij. dram^s: of these make pylles / given to the woman in labor with water
in the which is soden sauyne and penyryall / or else with the brothe of
cicercula / and the juice of rue shall help very greatly.

Item take.ij. dram^s of sauyne / of asa fetida / armoniacum / and madder / of
each half a dram^ / these temper to gether in pills / and give her with
wine.ij. dram^s of the same.

Item take of aristolochia longa / pepper and myrrh / of each like much /
confict them to gether with wine and make pylles of them / and minister them
with an ounce of water of the decoction of lupynes / these pylles be of such
efficacy and strength that it alleuiateth and vnpayneth the birth / it
delyuereth the matrice or mother from all manner of birth / be it alive or dead.

Item take of white bedellium / myrrh / and sauyne / of each like much: temper
these with cassia lignea and honey / and make pylles of them of the byggenesse
of pesen / and of these pylles give at each time.v. to the laborer / which be
of the same might and strength with the other pylles spoken of here next
before.

Item take of myrrh / castorium / and storax / of each one dram^ / temper them
with honey / and make pylles of it / these for this purpose excel and pass al
other / they be of such virtue and strength in operation.

A plaster to provoke the birth: Take wyld goward / and seth it in water / in
the same water temper myrrh / the juice of rue / and barlye meal / so much
as shall be sufficient / stamp these things to gether / and make it plasterwyse
/ then lay it to the woman's belly between the nauel and the nether part this
plaster shall help meruelouslye.

And although many other things there be the which have virtue and power to
provoke birth and to help it / yet leuyng all such things for breuite and
shortenesse we have set here such things / which are chief and most
principally conducent for the same purpose.

How the Secondyne or second birth shall be sorsed to issue forth, if it come
not frelye of his own kind. Cap.vi.
HEre also sometime it comes to pass / that the Secondine / which is wont to
come to gether with the birth / remain and tarry behind and follow not. And
that for diverse causes / one is: For because peradventure the woman has been
so sore weakened and feblysshed with travel / dolor / and pain / of that
first birth / that she has no strength remaining to help herself to the
expellynge of this second birth / another may be / that it be entangled /
tied / or let within the matrice / which cha^seth many times / or that it be
destitute of humors / so that the water be flowen from it sooner then it should
/ which should make the places more slyppery and more easy to pass through /
or else that the places over weryed with long and sore labor / for pain
contract or gather together / and enclose themself again / or that the places
be swollen for anguysshe and pain / and so let the coming forth of the
second birth.

But to be short of what so ever cause it be thus stopped / the mydwyfe in
any wise must find such means that it may be unloosed and expulsed. For
otherwise great inconuemency should chaunse to the party / and specially
suffocation and chokynge of the matrice / which also must so much the more be
taken head to / for because the second birth retained and kept within / will
sone putrifye and rot: whereof will ensue ill noysom and pestiferous vapors /
ascendynge to the heart / the brains / and the mydryffe / through the which
means the woman shall be short wynded / faint hearted / often soundynge and
lyenge without any manner of mouynge or stearing in the pulces: ye and many
times is plainly suffocated / strangled / and dead of it: wherefore that none of
these things happen / with all diligens and pain it must be provided that
the secondyne be expelled.

If retention of it come by weakness of the laborer through long travel /
then must she be recomforted and stre^gthed with good comfortable meats and
drynkes which may enharte her / as brothe made of the yolke of eggs / or with
good old wine and good fat and tydy flesh / or birds / hens flesh /
capon / partrige / pyginnes / and such like.

And if retentio^ of this secondine come / because the place is contract to
gether again / otherelles that the matrice is swollen for long pain / then
must be used such things to provoke it out / the which do make the way
slypper / sople / and easy for it to proceed / with the oils or oyntementes
spoken of before / as oil of white lyllies / of maiora^ / and of blewe
lyllies. Item the beryes of iumper or galbanum beaten to powder and drunk with
luke warmed wine / will cause the same to issue out. Ite^ sothernwood / or
else penyryall soden in wine / and the decoction dronken / is of the same
virtue.

Item to suffume the secreates with the perfumes written of before / is good
for this purpose / and the fume of the water / in which mallous holyoke / and
berefutte vt soden in / received beneth / is like good. Also to wash that
parts i^ water in which is sode^ branne / or to hold a little bagfull of
soden branne to the place / and therewythall to sooke the place / is very
profitable.

But if the retention of the secondyne come by reason that it is entanglyd or
fastened in some place of the matrice / so that it will not resolve ne lose then
make a fume underneath of brymstone / yuie leaves / and cresses or else of
cresses and fygges.

Also of all odoriferous and sweet smelling things: as ambre / musk /
frankencense / gallia muscata and confection nere / the which sauoures and
perfumes put on the emberres must be so closely received underneath / that no
part of the smell do ascend to the nose of the woman. For to the nose should
the savor of nothing come / but only of such things / the which stynke or
have abominable smell: as asa fetida / casto rium / man's here or woman's here
burnt / pecockes feathers burnt. Item in this case it shall be very good to make a
perfume underneath of the houe of an ass / which things although they be of
ill sauoure / yet they be of such nature and efficacy / that they occasionat
not only the seco^dine / but also dead byrthes to proceed and come forth out
of the matrice.

And in this case also let the woman with hold her brethe in ward in so much
as she can / for that shall drive downewarde such things as be in the bodyr
to be expelled. Item let her be provoked to sneese with the powder of eleborus
or pepper put in the nose holding her mouth and nose so cloose as may be.

Also the ointment / which is called vnguentum Basilicon / conveyed into the
matrice / is very good / for it mollifyeth the place and draws out the
secondine parforce / the which so soon as it is expelled / infude the oil of
rooses in to the same matrice. Item roosewater tempered with a quantite of the
powder of holyoke / and drunk / is good to expel the secondine.

And if it be so that any part of the secondine do appear / let the mydwyfe
receive it tenderlye / loosynge it out fair and softely lest it break / and
if ye doubt that it will break / then let the mydwyfe tie that part of the
which she has handfast to the woman's leg or foot / not very straight /
lest it break / nether very lax / lest it slyp in again / and then cause her
to snese. Then if the secondine tarry or stycke / so that it come not quyckly
forewarde / then loose it a little and a little very tenderlye wrething it
from one side to another / till such time as it be gotten out / but ever
beware of violent and hastye mouyng of it / lest that with the second birth ye
remove the matrice also.

And if in this mean while the women faint or sown by reasone of great pain
ensuynge of the taking a way of this secondine / then must ye minister such
things to her the which comfort the head and the heart as be electuaries which
are conficte with musk / ambre / and the confectio^ of precious stones / as
Diamargariton / and such other. Also such things the which comfort the
stomach / as Diagalanga / Dia cinamomu^ / and such other which are always in a
readiness at the apothecaries / the which things she shall receive with wine.

Item to remove the secondine and to expel it: take rue / horehownd /
Sothernewood / and motherwort / of ethe like quantite / and then take so much
of the oil of lyshes / as may be sufficient to stype / moysten and soke the
foresaid herbs in / put all this to gether into a glased pot covered with
such a cover that it have a little hole or vent above in the top of it /
then set this pot over the fire of coals / so that it boil a while / then take
it from the fire / and set it under the stole where the woman sytteth made
for the nonce having a pype made for that purpose of the which the one end ye
shall put into the vent or hole of the cover to the pot and the other end must
the party receive in to her body. And so to sit cloosed round about with
clothes / that no vapoure or air go forth of the pot having a few coals
under it / to keep it hot / and thus sytte the space of an hour or two / till
such time as the secondyne move and begin to proceed of his own kind. And
if it be so that ye profette not this ways / yet then lay this plaster on the
bellye between the navel and the secreates / of the which we shall speak
hereafter / the which is of such operation and efficacite that it expels
dead byrthes: if for all this the secondyne come not forewarde / then leave it
/ and use no more medicines ne remedies to that purpose but let it alone / for
with in few days it will putrifye and corrupt / and dyssolue into a watery
substance / thycke like bryne / or other fex myxed with water / and so issue
forth. Howheit in the mean while it will put the woman to great pain in the
head / in the heart / the stomach / as we touthed before.

How that many things chaunse to the women after their labor, and how to
avoid, defend, or to remedy the same. Cap.vii.
IT is also to be understood / that many times after the delyueraunce
happens to women other the fever or ague / or swellyng or inflation of the
body / other tumbling in the belly / or else commotion or settelynge out of
order of the mother or matrice. Cause of the which things is somtymes lack of
due and sufficient purgation and clensyng of the flowers after the birth / or
else contrary wise over much flowinge of the same / which sore does weaken
the woman. Also the great labor and stearynge of the matrice in the birth.

Then as often as it comes for lack of due purgation of the flowers / then
must be ministered such things / the which may provoke the same / whether it
be by medicines taken at the mouth / or by lotyon and washyng of the fete / or
by fumes or odours or emplastration / or by decoction of herbs serving to
that purpose / other else by oyntmentes / and such other things / according
as the person or the parell does require / of the which things few or no
women be ignorant. And ye must take diligent head that she be exactly and
utterly purged: to this be agreeable all such things / the which provoke
vryne and open the veins / making free way for the blood to pass / and
send the humors and matter downewarde / as motherworte / azure / sauyne /
penyryall / parcelye / cheruyll / anyse sede / fenel sede / iumper byries / rue
/ baybyries / germaunder / valeriane / time / cinomome / spykenarde / and such
other. All those things as they do provoke and cause urine so do they also
provoke and cause the flowers to depart. Howbeit as nere as ye can use none of
these things without the counsel of an expert physisyon / lest whylest ye
help one place ye hurt another / also to sneese helps much in this matter /
and to hold in the brethe enclosynge the noose and the mouth. Also fumigation
made of the yes of salt fysshes / or of the houe of a horse underneath /
provoke the flowers. If ye profet not by this means then if she be able to
bare it / let her blood in the vain / called Saphena / under the ancles of
the fete / for this provoke flowers chieflye of all other things.

Likewise do / if the woman have the ague after her labor / for that comes
of like cause by retention of the flowers / and in the fever let her use to
drink water / in the which is decocte barlye beaten / or cicer and barlye to
gether / or water in which be soden Tamaryndi / or way of milk / and let
her eat cullys made of a cock / and sweet pome Granates: for these things do
provoke the flowers / and mitigateth the immoderat heat / refresshynge
greatelye the body / loosynge and opening such things / the which before
ware constricte and cluddered to gether.

If the body after labor do swel and inflate then let her drink water in the
which is soden cicer and cummyn beaten to gether. Item good old wine with the
electuarium called diamarte / or the which is called alcakengi: of the which
Auicenna speaks in his.v. book. Item gum serapine / organnie / and
masticke. Also in this case a glyster made of such things / the which do
vaynqueshe and expelle ventositees and wyndenesse / also a pessarie or
suppositar made for that part of Aristolochia rotunda / squinan tum / storax
liquida / doronicum / zeduaria.

Again if the woman after her labor have frettynge and knawyng of the guts /
and pain of the matrice and other secreate parts there about / then let her
use the vapor and fume of such things the which have virtue to mitigate
swage and alay the pain / as mallows / holyoke / fenegreke / cummyn / camomell
/ sauyne / and hemlocke.

Also to annoint the places with oleum sesaminum / or with oil of sweet
almondes And if no great heat do abou^de in the woman / she may drink
tryacle or trifera magna with wine in which is decoct motherwort or muggeworke.

Also against pains in the preuy parts / take penyriall / policaria / syx
leaves of bay tree: sethe them to gether / and receive the vapor underneath
closely. Item take rue / red motherworte / sothernwood / beat them to gether /
and temper them with the oil of penny ryall / and put all to gether into a pot
/ and set it over the fire a while / till it be somewhat soden to gether / and
then take it of again / and put it all in to a little round lynnen bag
made for the purpose / the which with this herbs in it ye shall co^uaye into
the secrets.

Item take camomell and line of each like much.iiij. handefulles: braye them to
gether and sethe them with white wine / and then put it in a round bag of
lynnen / as before was done / and convey it into the womans preuy parts. Ite^
let her drink for the same purpose ij. graynes of musk with wine. Ite^ take
white onyons and cover the^ under the hot ashes the which when they be well
roasted / beat the^ to gether with fresh butter unsalted / and make it in
manner of a plaster / and then put it in a lynne^ bag / and co^uey itin to the
places / as before / in the mean while perfumyng the preuy parts with white
fra^kencense and storax.

If it be so that the woman be vexed about the back and loins after her labor
/ take camomell / and muggewoort / of each.ij. handfulles of woorwode /
sothernewood of each one handefull / of motherwort.iij. handefulles / of
cinamome and nutmegges bete^ small half an ounce / decocte all these things
together / and in the water of this decoction being warm / dyp a sponge or
other lynnen clothes fomentynge / sokynge / and strekynge the back with the
same / and so do often times / or else put all these foresaid herbs to gether
soden in a bag / and lay it plasterwyse to the back.

If this profette not: take oil nardine / oil of white lyllies / of each an
ounce and an half / to the which put a dram^ of nutmegges beaten to small
powder / with this annoynte the back. Item take oil of anys / oil of
camomell / of each an ounce / oil of white lyllies.ij. ounces / of wax.ij.
dram^s: dissolve all these to gether over the fire / and there with annoint the
back.

But if after the labor the flowers issue more vehementlye and in greater
abundance then they should / to the great effeablysshyng of the woman and
inducynge of much langor and paynefulnes: then syrst shall ye note where upon
it comes: for the cause known the disease may the more readelye be recured:
and causes of it be diverse: but most espetiall those that follow / that is to
say: Of much abundant superfluous blood contained in the hole body: or of
much commistion of the melancholy humor and the blood to gether / by the
which the blood is e^fyred and chawfed: and so distendeth opens and sets
abroad the veins which descend to the matrice. Also the blood being very
thynne and wateryshe: for so it penetrateth / thrylleth / and yssueth forth
the sooner. Also if the veins be very large / and receive much blood: for in
that case they send forth the more again. Also if the matrice be vnmyghty and
weakened / the veins likewise weak and large: so that they can not retain
nor witholde the blood. Also if the body of the woman or the outward parts be
very dense / cloose / and compacte to gether: so that the outward powers be
contracte and shut in such wise that no vapors or swette can issue out at
them: then this shall cause the ill humors (which otherwise would pass
thorough the powers in swette) to remain within the body / and there to
engender and encreace greater flux and abou^da^ce of matter / which proceeds
with the flowers and augmenteth the quantite of them. Also if the veins /
which be named hemorroides / in the matrice be open and flow forth. Also if
the matrice be peryshed or otherwise viciat. Also if it chanse that the woman
have had a fall / or has been thrust or beaten / by all and any of this means
may come this inordinat flux of flowers.

Now stynge then that it ensues by so manyfolde occasions and causes it
shall be mete that women in this case be nothing ashamed ne abashed to disclose
their mind unto expert physicians / showyng them every thing in it / as they
know where upon it should come: so that the physician understanding the
woman's mind / may the sooner by his learning and experience consider the true
cause of it / and the very remedy to amend it. And many things there be which
sease and restrain this over much flowynge of flowers: both electuaries /
confections / trochiskes pouders / clisteres / odoures / suffumigations bathes
/ plasters and oyntementes / of which for the love of women I will here set
forth the most principal and best.

First then to stynte and restrain the owtragius flux of flowers it shall be
very good to bind the arms very straight and strongely and not the fete or
hands as: some unwise men do teach / and then to set a ventose or box or cup
of glass with fire (which is called boxynge) under the breasts / but cuttynge
no part of the skin / layeng also lynnen clothes dypped in vyn^g^e on the
bellye between the navel and the secreates: conueyenge also into the places
such things / which have virtue to restrain blood / as balaustium / the
ryne of pome granate / carabe / terra sigillata / bole armenyacke / sanguis
draconis / hematites / the red rose / white frankencense / and galls: all
those things or as many of them as ye can conuenientlye get / beat them to
powder in like portion / and temper them with thycke and gross wine / making
of it a plaster / the which so te^pered put it in to a little round bag
the quantite of a man's thombe the which she shall put in to the preuye places.

Item an other plaster to be ministered likewise: Take of the bloudestone /
called Emathites / bole armenyacke: of each half an ounce: sanguis draconis /
licium / of each.ij. dram^s: Karabe: the cups of Acornes / Cipresse nuttes /
Balaustium or psidiu^ / of each one dram^: of the scales of iron one dram^ and
an half: Turbyntyne and pyche like quantite / or so much as shall be sufficient
to make a plaster: beat and braye all these to gether / temperinge it to a
plaster: and then do with it as ye did with the other before.

An oyntemente for the same purpose: Take oil Myrtine / oil of rooses / of
each half a pound: Carabe / the scraping of yuerye / the scrapynge of a
gootes horn / read coral: terra sigillata / white frankencense / of each one
ounce / of white wax.iij. ounces / all those tempered to gether / make them in
an ointment / and therewith annoint the womb and the secreates.

A batthe concerning the same: Take wurmewud / plantayne the more and the
less the tops of vynes / fresshe branches of wyld mulberyes / unripe
damsenes slowes / or boloes / wild peers / medlers or myspylles / of each.iij.
handefulles / of red roose leaves three handefulles / of oak bark.iiij.
handfulles / of dayses / of all sorts of thystles / of each.ij. handfulles: of
cinkefoyle / the leaves and rotes / tormentyll the roots / colubrine / of each
an handefull: also of acorne cups a saw ser full / of gawlles / of acorns
pylled / of bursa pastoris / of each.ij. handefulles: beat all these to powder
/ cuttynge and brosynge that / that will not be beaten to powder / and sethe
them to gether in rain water / or else in water / in the which.x. or.xij.
burnte s^ones have been quenchyd: this done / let the woman bathe herself in
this water up to the navel / and when she comes forth of the bathe / give her
to drink.ij. dram^s of electuarium athanasie / or miclete / which plantayne
water / or if she be sore thurstye with red wine.

And likewise ye may give unto her of these electuaries that follow: take good
old roose sugre.ij. ounces / of red coral / burnte yuery / bole armenyacke /
of each two dram^s / of hematites three dram^s / beat all these things to
gether / temperynge it with the roose sugre / and let her receive of it in the
morning and evening with two dram^s of plantane water / or else the water of
bursa pastoris.

Item take the stone Emathites / and rub it on a whetstone / till the
whetstone seem read / then wash it of again from the whetstone with
plantaynewater / and so do oftentimes / until such time that thou have a good
quantite of it / and every morning and evening let the woman drink two or
three sponefulles of the same.

Farthermore there be at the apothecaries trochiskes which help greatly in
this case / as the trochiskes of karabe / and the trochiskes of bole armoniacke
which must be ministered a dram^ or more of either of them / with.iiij. or.v.
sponeful of plantayne water. Who that requires farther in this matter let them
ask counseill of the phisytions / for we have set here but such things
which may seem most necessary.

Now if it so be that there be engendered any apostume or other disease in the
preuye places after her labor / then most the apostumes and deseases be
cleansed / purged / and healed / the pain and ache of it mitigated and swaged
with the juice of the beryes of solatrum and the juice of plantane / also the
oil of rooses / so that all these things be tempered to gether / and the
places anointed therewith.

Ite^ otherwise: take the wit of an egg / womans milk / the juice of
purselayne / and temper all these to gether / and conueye it to the dyseased
place / also let a bathe be made of water / in the which be soden psida /
red rose leaves / the cups of acornes / oak bark / tormentyll / colubryne /
and cinkefoyle / the leaves and the rotes / let all these things be soden to
gether / and in the water the woman to bathe her self up to the navel: and
after that the grieved parts be healed and cleansed let the place be anointed
with vnguentum album / or vnguentum rubeum / which is to be had at the
apothecaries / and with such other things whose property be to refrige rate
and cool. And look what cure and remedies be mynystred to this places being
apostumate / or otherwise deseased / the same also seruethe / if the matrice or
any other part of the secreates be rupte or broken.

Many times also it chanseth that the foundament gut comes forth both in man
and woman / and spetially in women in this business / by reason of their great
labor and stryuynge with themself: wherefore in this case it is the mydwifes
part with her hand warmed and wet in whyt wine / to reduce it back into his
place again / the which if she can not by this means / for because that per
adventure it be swollen / then let her dissolve butter in whyt wine warmed /
and there in dyp wool with the which wrappe the same gutte a while / so doing
often times / till it be swaged / that it may be returned in again and ye may
use in the stead of wine luke warm milk. And when it is thus returned and
reduced into his place: take wax / and melt it to gether with masticke / or
whyt frankencense / then sprede it upon lynne^ plasterwyse / and lay it over
the place where it came forth byndynge it to it with a lynnen clothe or roller
for partynge of / and let this be done thus so often as she goythe to stole
after that she has done / until such time that it be so setteled within /
that it come no more out / and if ye will not occupye wax / then dyp wool in
the oil of masticke or of speak nardy / and lay it unto the place over the
fundament / byndynge it fast upon the place / as before. Item another way:
wasshe and soke the gut with the water in which is decoct and soden such
things which exiccat dry and constrayne or combyne / as gauls / cypress
nuttes / spida / karabe / mastick / frankencense / sanguis draconis / and when
it is well washed and soked with this water / then take the powder of an
hearts horn burnte / and strue it round about the gutte / and so restore it
again in to his place.

Again if it chanse / that after the woman's labor the matryce be removed out
of his place / and appear forth / then let it be washed and soked with the
water in which be soden these things following: take of cupresse nuttes /
spicanarde / psida / balaustium / acorne cups / of each an ounce: of
mespylles and vntype wild peers / and unripe aples / plummes / and damsens or
bolous: of each a handefull and such / of those as be to be powdered beat them
to powder and the rest divide / and cut them small: then seathe them all to
gether in rayn water / or else in water in the which stele being red hot
has been often times quenched: and in the same water let the party bathe
her up to the navel / or else dyp a spo^ge or a lock of wool in it / and
therewith wasshe and soke the same matrice oftentimes then / ever with a fair
clean lynnen clothe wype it clean again and strewe upon it the powder
following / beaten very small and searched thorough sylke.

Take of frankencense / karabe / galls / pside / balaustie / cypress nuttes /
alome / antymonye / bole armoniacke / masticke / of each like much: beat these
to very fine powder / and strewe the matrice with it / then tenderlye reduce it
in to his place again with warm lynnen clothes byndynge it up.

But if so be that the matrice be swolle^ / so that by this means it will not
be restored to his natural place again / then dissolve butter in white wine /
as ye did before / and with the same soke it unto such time as it be assuaged
/ and then reduce it.

Again sometime it chanseth that the woman's navel thoroughe labor is
dyssolued / so that it opens it self: then make a small tente of fine lynnen
/ and anoynte it with this oyntement that follows / and the same put it in to
the navel: take white frankensence / and beat it to powder / and then te^per
it with the white of an egg / so that it be after the manner of lyquyd honye:
with this annoynte the navel within and without / annoyntynge also the tente
/ the which being put in the hole of the navel bind some clothe over it to
keep it in his place.

Item many times it chanseth that through the great difficulty and thronges
of labor the preuye part and the foundament be come one / by reason of rupture
and breaking of the same part in the delyueraunce of the child / and that by
that means the matrice descends and yssueth down / the which thing
chanseth sometimes by reason that the same place is very narowe and also tender
/ and the birth bygge / and of great growethe / so that it proceeds with
such violence / that it breakethe the way before it.

When this myshappe fallethe / then first wasshe and soke the matrice / and
alsoo reduce it to his place again / after the manner as I told you here
immediately before / then heal these bracke and wound sowynge of both sides
of it to gyther again with a sylken threde / as surgeons do other wounds: and
if that like ye not then / may ye cure it otherwise without sowyng thus.

Take two little pieces of lynnen cloth / each of the length of the wound /
and in breadth two fyngers broad: spread the little clothes with some fast
cleauynge plaster the which will cause the clouthes to stycke fast where they
shall be set / then fasten them the one on the one side of the ryfte / the other
on the other side / so that nothing appear between the pieces of lynnen in the
mids of them / but only the clefte and ryfte of the wound in the breadthe
of a straw / then this done / sow these sides of lynnen to gether close as
before I bed you to sow the skin: and when they be thus stytched to gether /
lay a little lyquyd pytche upon the seem: and this done the lappes and sides
of the wond under the lynnen plaster will grow to gether again and heal /
and the^ may ye remove your plasters.

I^e^ another way: take camfely dried / and beat it to powder / also cummyn
and cynamome both beaten to powder / join all three to gether / and strew of
this powder into the wound / and without fault it shall heal.

Of aborcementes or vntymelye byrthes and the causes of it, and by what
remedies it may be defended, helped and eased. Cap.viii.
ABorcement or untimely birth is / when the woman is delivered before due
season and before the fruit be ripe: as in the.iij.iiij. or.v. monethe before
the birth have life and sometimes after it has life it is delivered before it
steare being by some chaunse dead in the mothers womb. Of the which thing
there be many and diverse causes.

First sometimes the mouth of the matrice is so large and ample / that it can
not conveniently shytte it self to gether / nether contain the feture or
conceptio^ / or it is corrupt and infect with such vicyous and ill humors that
it is so slyppery that the feture slyppeth and slydeth forth. Also sometimes
the matrice is apostumated and sore / so that for pain it can not contain the
conception.

Item sometime the cotilydons / that is the veins and synnues by the which the
co^ception and feature is tied and fastened in the matrice (through the which
also the feature receaueth noryshment and fode) be stopped with vyscous and ill
humors / or else swollen by inflation / so that they break / by the which
means the feature destitute of his wont noryshment peryssheth and dies / and
that most commonly in the second or third monethe after conception:
wherefore Hypocrates says: All such women which be impregnat or conceived
being of a mean state in her body / that is to say / neither to fat or
gross / ne to spare or lean: if it chanse any such to aborce in the second
or third month (no other evident cause appearyng) know ye for certain that
it ensues for because the cotilydons be opplete / stopped / and stuffed with
ill humors / and be swollen and puffed therewith / that they break / and so
co^seque^tly the feature dries for fault of fode.

Item aborcemente sometime comes by reason that some of the places about the
matrice be deseased and greaued: as if intestinum rectum / which is called the
fundament gutte be exulcerat / having the pyles or hemorroides / or the vysyke
or bladder be swollen or encombred with the stone / the strangurye / or other
ill / in these cases thorough the great labor and pain the which the party
has in endeuourynge and enforsynge her self other to stole or to make water
/ be engendered great motions downewarde / by the which means many times the
cotylydons be enfringed and broken.

Also aborcement may come of a disease called Tenasmus / the which is when
one has ever great desire and lust to the stole and yet can do nothing /
never the less the parties greatly do enforce and pain them self to it / as
Hypocrates says: The pregnant woman which has tenasmum / for the most part
aborteth.

Item the coughe / if it be grievous / causes the same / and as the forenamed
excellent phisytiane says / such as are very spare and lean and brought low
evermore lyghtlye does aborte / for because that as Auicenna writes: all the
meat and fode the which they receive / turns to the fode / noryshme^t / and
restoration of their own bodies / and so is the conception destitute of fode
/ wherefore necessarily it dies.

Item this chanse also comes by over much bleadynge or yssuyng of the
flowers / when they issue immoderatly. And so says Hypocrates: If the woman
yield flowers after her conception / it can not be that the feature do long
prove / the which saying must be understand / if they flow vehementlye / or
that the party be weak and very spare / or if it be after the third month
/ for it may be well that in the first and second month flowers may issue /
and yet no danger / for as yet little fode and noryshment satisfies the
conception.

Item to be let blood / may be the cause of aborcement as Hypocrates says:
which must be understand in such as have but little store of blood: but
such as have great copy and plenty of blood may without any parell (if any
cause require it) be let blood / so that it be after the.iiij. month and
before the.vii. How be it I would that none should be let blood / except some
great and urgent cause did require it.

Item it may come by taking of some strong purgation before the.iiij.
monethe and after the vii. month / and if it be so that any necessity do so
require that she must needs receive a purgation / let it be done betwent
the.iiij. and the.vij. month after the conception: for then may it be with
lest parell / and se that the purgation be very gentell and easy.

Also this may come by reason of a continual flux / be it bloody or
otherwise / and spetially if the woman be weak and spare / for by that means
the conception is greatly weakened and peryshed. Item over much vomytynge may
be cause of aborcement / for by over much galpynge and reachynge vpwardes the
cotilydons may be broken / and so the feature to perysshe.

Item over much famyne or hunger and also sharp and faruent syckenesse may
be the cause hereof / as the pestelence / apostume in the breast / the soden
palsy / the falling syckenes. etc. Also over much dronkenesse and excess
fedynge and surfetynge / by the which the birth is suffocat and strangeled in
the bellye and the fode corrupt for lack of due digestion. Ite^ if the birth
be sick by any outward or inward cause / or if the secondyne in the which
the feature is contained / do break before his time and the humors and
waterres of the same flow and issue forth / causes the place to be slyppery /
and so the birth to slide away untimely / or if the mother have taken very
great cold / which may sone chanse in the far north parts / or over
great heat / which weakeneth both mother and child. And therefore ought women
with child to eschew much bathing or going to the hot houses in their
temyng for that may do hurt three ways / first that it kenleth and enflameth
the air or brethe contained in the body / and so styfleth the child and
sometimes the mother to / secondly that it relaxeth / dissolueth / and loses
the cotylydo^s / and so makes the birth to issue forth / thyrdlye that the
utter hette of the bathe increases the inward heat of the body / in so much
that the birth not being able to sustain and abide the heat naturallye
proceeds for refrigeration and colynge / but in the time or about the time of
labor she may use bathes / as I declared before for the redyar and more
expedite delyueraunce.

Item the intemperancie and mutation of the air / and whether may be cause of
aborcemente / for as Hypocrates wrytteth / when so ever the winter is hot and
moist / and the spring tide after cold and dry / such women in that spring
tide may sone and of a light cause have aborcement / or if they aborce not /
yet they shall be delivered with great pain / and the birth shall be very
weak and syckelye / so that it shall dye straight / or if it dye not by and
by / it shall prove but very slenderlye / the cause of the which thing is
this: for when that such wynterynge chaunseth / the hot and moist whether
heateth and moisteth the woman's body / and by that the body is opened /
unloosed / and resolved / no less then thought she ware every day bathed /
and upon this when the spring tide comes / if it be cold and dry: finding
the body open and unloosed after such sort / the cold entryth and percethe
the body the sooner and the more vehementlye / and the birth fealynge the
soden cold and change of whether / pyneth away and dyethe in the mothers
bellye / or anon after it is delivered / or if it live / it lykethe not / nor
prouethe not / and great pain shall it be to keep life in it.

Item aborcement may happen by over much stearynge of the body in laboring
/ daunsynge / or leaping: or by some fall or thrust against some wall / or
beatynge / or by some sudden anger / fear / dredde / sorrow / or some soden
and unlooked for joy. Thus have I rehearsed all the causes of the which most
commonly may ensue aborcemente or untimely birth: the which no doubt is
much more grefe and vain to the woman then the very natural labor / for
such things as chaunse to man or woman contrary to nature / or before nature
does require it / is far greater grefe then the same happenyng and coming
in his due season.

Signs whereby ye may forsee aborceme^t. When the woman shall labor before her
time / these signs are wont to go before: First her breasts which before
were hoole / sound / and full / shall begin to were less / to fall / and to
flagge: and then ever for the most part aborcement follows. But if it be so
that she go with two children at once / if one of the breasts swage / which
before was in good liking / the other remaynyng sound and safe / then look of
what side the breast is of / and the child of that side is in parell / wherefore
Hypocrates writes: If the right breast slake or flagge / the masculyne or male
birth is in parel: if the left / the female birth: for because that for the
most part when there be two at once / the one is masculyne and the other
femenyne / the man lies in the right side / and the woman in the left.

Also an other sign of aborcemente is / when the woman has great pains and
dolours of the matrice / and that she begin to wexe read in the face / and all
parts of her body to shake and tremble / as though it ware in a fever / or
the palsye in the head. Item when she feleth great ache in the ynner part of
the eyes toward the brains / the rest of the body taken as it were with a
werynesse and languesshynge / these things portende and sygnifye aborcement to
be at hand / spetiallye if at the same time the flowers issue also.

Item if the woman's body do swell and inflate with a certain hardness or
styfnesse and that she feel stytches and as it were ven tosyte or wind
runnynge from one side of the body to the other / and yet the belly not
withstanding / being nothing the more ponderous or wayghtye / and that the
same inflacion do persyst and continue any while the woman taking and eating
such things which have virtue to discuss and vanqueshe ventosite and
wyndenesse: this thing I say does betoken parell of aborcemente through
ventosite and inflacion / and that chieflye about the third or fourth month
after the conception. Now have I sufficiently declared evident and sufficient
signs where by may be provided and forsene the aborcement before it come /
now will I show you the remedies / whereby it may be auerted and let.

The chief remedy to avoid aborceme^t is: to avoid and shun all such things
which may be cause of it / the which I have competentlye entreated of
already: but if ye fear aborcement because that the mouth of the matrice be
over ample and large / then must ye use such things / whose operation is to
contrahe / constrayne / and bring to gether: as bathes / fumigations /
oyntementes / plasters / odours / and such like / of the whithe I spoke before
in the seuenthe chapter / and such things the which repress and stynte the
flowers flowynge over much after the birth.

Again if ye fear this parell / because the mouth of the matrice is moist
and flypperye / other because that the cotylydons be repleate and fulfilled
with vyscous humors / and with inflations or ventosytees: then may ye defend
it by using of such things / whose qualitees be to purifye / cleanse /
exiccat / or dry / and to repress ventosytees.

How be it / in all this matter let not to make some expert physytyan of
your counseill / if ye may have such one / for because that many such
things come / and not all by one way or mean.

And if ye doubt parell / for because that the matrice or other places about
be infected / exulcerated / or appostumat / or having the stone or strangurye
/ and such other things / then ask / and use the advise of some well learned
medycyne / and he shall show you how all things shall be recured.

If again ye fear aborcement / because the party is very weak and low
brought / then let her feade on such things the which moysten and norysshe
well or fatten the body / as capon flesh / kydde / lamme / young veale /
partrige / and such other.

Again if the woman be taken with any sharp and fell decease / then let her
be cured of the same as shortelye as can be with such things the which
appertain to the curing of such desease / or if she have sustained any long
famyne or hunger: then let her be fed with good meats and drynkes
moderatlye taken / and if she have surfeted by over much eating and drinking
(as now a days most commenlye people do) then let her absteyne for a time /
and if it may be conuenientlye done / let her receive some casy and gentle
medicine / which may alleuiat and lyghten her of her surfetynge burden.

Now if it so be / that the woman abound in blood / then shall it be very
good a little to let her blood / both for her self and also for the birth
/ which through over much adoundance of it might happen to be suffocated and
strangeled / of the which thing also I have spoken largely before.

Farthermore if the woman fear aborcement / by reason of contynuad coughe / or
over much vomyte and perbrakynge / or the flux / or of the desease called
tenasmus / or of over much yssuynge of blood / whether it be by the nose / or
other parts of the body axe thaduyse of a physitia^ for remedy / if for the
fragilite / tenderness / and bracke / of the secondyne she fear this
aborcemente / for because that in this case the secondyne shall not be able to
hold and contain the birth / as for this / there is no other medicine to
defend it / but only that the party take heed that she hurt not her self
by over much mouynge or stearynge / as by laboring / daunsynge / runnynge /
standing / fast going / or caryenge of ponderous and weyghtye things / or
leftynge of the same. And to be short / let her with all warynesse take heed
and be diligent that she exchue and abstain from all such things the which
might cause and induce aborcement.

Of dead byrthes, and by what signs or tokens it may be known, and by what
means it may also be expelled. Cap.ix.
IT shall be now convenient for us to speak of dead byrthes / how it shall be
known that they be dead / and how they may be expelled from the mother.
Signs then that the birth is dead in the mothers womb be these: j. First if
the mothers breasts do suddenly slake / as I touched before in the.viij.
chapter.ij. If it move it self no more being wont before to steare it
self.in. If when the mother torneth her from the one side on the other / she
feale it falling from the one side to the other like a stone or aded
wayght.iiij. If her bellye and navel begin to were cold / which before was
wont to be temperatly hot.

v. If any stynkynge and filthy humors flow from the matrice / and chieflye
after some fell desease.vi. If the woman's eyes wexe holowe / and that her color
change from white to swarte and dunne color / and that her eyes and nose wexe
astoned / and have not their right use / and her lyppes wexe wan.

vij. If benethe the navel and about the secreate parts she feale great
thronge and pain / the color of her face changynge into worsse and worsse /
otherwise then it was wont to do.viij. If she have appetyte to eat such
things / the which be against nature / and not wont to be eaten or
dronken.ix. If she be in her sleep vexed with bayne dreams.x. If she be payned
contynuallye with the strangurye / or that she enforce her self much to the
stole / and with all her power / and yet can not do any thing.

xi. If her brethe begin to stynke / the which thing lyghtlye happens two
or three days after the birth be dead.

xij. If her hands put in to very warm water / and then laid on the woman's
bellye / and the child steare not / is a sign that it is dead.

Of all these signs now the more that come to gether of the^ at one time and
in one person / the surer may ye be that the birth is ded the which being ones
ded / all diligence must be had that it may be expelled out of the woman's body:
but here must ye se again whether it may be expelled / the mothers life saved
or no / for some time it chaunseth that the mother dies with all / and
sometimes the mother does well and prospers.

Whether the mother shall be in parell withal or no / by these things shall ye
know if the woman being in the labor sown or fare as though she ware in a
transe / if her remembrance fail her / and she wax feable and scant able to
mou^e or steare herself / if she (called with a loud voice) can answer
nothing at all / or else very little and that very softelye / as though her
voice began to fail her: if she be invaded or taken among in the laboring
with conuulsion or shrynkeling to gether: if she refuse or can not broke meat
/ if her pulces beat very fast / the which signs when ye se in the woman
laboring: it is an ruident toke^ that she shall not live long after her birth /
wherefore commit the cure of her to the hands of almyghtye god / but if none of
these signs do appear / then have good hope / for the woman shall do well /
the birth being once departed: wherefore give all diligence to the expultion
of it / that the woman may be delivered of this dead burden: the which
thing may be done by two ways / other by medicines expulsyue / or else by
certain instruments made for the nonce.

First without instruments with this fumigation: take other the houe or dunge
of an ass / and put it on coals / and let the woman receive the fume
underneath. Another: take the skin of an adder / myrrh / castoreum /
brymstone / galbanum / oppoponacum / madder that the dyerres occupye / pygeons
dunge / or hawks dunge: beat all these to powder / and temper them with ox
gall / and make pylles of it each of the quantite of a fylbert nutte / and then
put one after another in the coals / and receive the fume through a pype or
conduyte made for that purpose in to the priuities.

Another: take encense / oppoponacum / galbanum / brymstone / of each like
much / beat them to gether and temper them with ox galle / and make pylles
of them / and then of the same make fumigations / as before.

A potion for the same purpose: take asafetida half a dram^ / of rue iij.
dram^s / of myrrh.ij. dram^s: and beat them to powder / and give to the woman
at each time a dram^ of this powder with white wine / or with water in the
which sauyne is soden.

Another: take fygges / fenegreke / organnye / and sethe them in water the
which gene unto the woman to drink / for this drink will engendre lubrycyte
and slypperynesse in the nether parts / and use also some of those things
which have virtue to provoke the birth / whereof we entreated before.

Item certain pessaries or suppositaries concerning the same: take gum
armoniacke / oppoponacum / helleborus niger / staphisagre / aristolochia longa
/ and colocynthis without his kernelles: beat all these things to gether /
temperyng them with ox gall and also with the juice of fresshe rue / then make
a pessarie of woollen / and annoint and wet the pessarie with the same /
conueynge it into the secreate places.

Item another: make a pessarie of wolle^ of the length and thyckenesse of a
finger / and do it in the juice of rue in the which is dissolved a quantity of
scammome / and do with that pessarie / as before.

Item take aristolochia rotunda / sauyne / guard cresses / of each like much /
beat them to powder / and temper them with ox gall: with this annoint a
pessarie made and ordered as before is spoken of. Item if the woman drink the
milk of another woman / it will steare and expel the birth.

Item take of the juice of dyttayne or of the powder of the root of the same
herb.ij. dram^s / and give the same to drink to the woman with wine / except
she be in great heat / for then shall ye give it her with luke warm water /
and this shall expel the dead birth without any parell of the mother.

Item take of myrrh.iiij. drammes / of cinamome / galbanum / castoriu^ / of
each two drammes: of oppoponacum one dram^: all those beaten / and tempered to
gether with ox gall / make pylles of them / wayenge each of them a dram^ / and
with the fume of those perfume the nether parts / by this vapoure the dead
birth is brought forth / inflammation and suffocation of blood is expelled.

Item take of water mynte / sothernwood / muggewort / of each a handefull / of
asphaltum half an ounce / of madder two ounces and an half / of camomell /
barotum / fenegreke / of each two ounces: sethe all these things to gether in
rain water: in the which let the woman bathe her self / then take of
hensgrece and duckes greece / of each.iiij. dram^s: to the which add two ounces
of oil of anues sede / with this oyntme^t annoint the womans head coming out
of the bath: then take datestones and beat them to powder a dram^ and a half
/ with a scruple of safrane tempered to gether with whyt wine: the which let
her immediatlye drink after she come forth of the bathe.

Item take oppoponacum / and make there of a pessarye the quantity of a finger
/ conueye it into the priuities / this expelieth the dead birth.

Item take of galbanum a dram^ or some what less: of gotes milk an ounce and
a half or two ounces in the which the galbanum being dissolved / give it to
the woman to drink.

Item a plaster for the same: take galbanum beaten and tempered with the juice
of motherworte / and of this make a plaster by puttyng to of wexe a certain
qua^tite / than take a lynnen cloth of such length and breadth that it may
cover all the belly under the nauel to the priuities from one side to the other
/ on this cloth spread this plaster of the thyckenesse of a straw / and lay it
to the bellye. Item take the tryacle which is called diatessaron: and give of
it to the woman for to drink / and it will expel this dead birth.

But if all these medicines profette not / then must be used more severe and
hard remedies / with instruments / as hokes / tongues / and such other
things made for the nonce. And first the woman must be laid a long vpryght /
the myddell part of her body lyeng hyer then all the rest / companyed of
women assistynge her about to comfort her / and to keape her down / that
when the birth is plucked out she rise not withal. Then let the mydwyfe
annoint her left hand with the oil of white lyllyes or other that may make it
sople and smouth: and holding out her fyngers shytting to gether her hand let
her put it to the matrice to feale and perceive after what fasshion the dead
birth lies in the mothers womb: so that she may the better put in hokes
and such other instruments to pluck it out with all.

If it be so that it lie the head forewarde / then fasten a hoke other upon one
of the eyes of it / or the rofe of the mouth / or under the chyn / on one of
the sholders / which of these parts shall seem most commodious and handsome
to take it out bye / and the hoke fastened to draw it out very tenderlye
for hurtynge of the woman.

But if it lie the fete forewarde / then fasten the hoke on the bone above the
priuye parts / or by some ribbe / or some of the back bones / or of the
breast bones / and when this hoke is thus fastened / the midwyfe may not by and
by draw and pluck at it / but holding it in her left hand / let her with
her right hand fasten another in some other part of the birth right
against the first / and then tenderlye let her draw both to gether / so that
the birth may proceed and come forth on both sides equallye / mouynge it from
one side to another / till ye have gotten out alto gether / and now and then
to help it in the coming forth with the fore finger well anointed / if it
chanse to stycke or to be let any where: and as it comes forth / always to
remove the hokes farther and farther on the dead birth.

Again if it chanse that one of the hands only of the birth do appear / and
that it can not conuenientlye be reduced and returned upward again / by
reason of the narownesse of the place / then byndt it with a lynne^ cloth /
that it slyp not up again / and then to pluck it outward / until such time
that the hole arm be out and then with a sharp knyfe cut it of from the body
/ and even so do if both hands appear first at once / or one leg or both
/ if they can not be returned back / to be otherwise taken out convenient lie
/ as ye cut the arm from the sholders / so likewise cuttinge the legs
from the thyghes / for the which purpose the surgeo^s have me^e instruments
made for the nonce with the which such legs and arms may sone be cut from
the body / these parts being once rese^te and cut from the body / then
turn the test / so that it may easylye proceed with as little pain to the
mother / as may be.

If it be so that the chyldes head be so swollen by inflation / swellynge / or
resort of humors that it will not conveniently issue out that narowe places /
then let the mydwyfe with a sharp penknyfe cut open the head / that the
humors contained in it may issue and run forth / and so the head to wax
less able to be plucked out: but if it so be that not by any such casualte
the head be bygge / but only of a natural grows / then must the head be
broken in pieces / and the parts evermore taken forth with such instruments /
as the surgeons have ready and necessary for such purposes.

Again if that after the head were come forth / yet the breast part would not
follow for greatenesse / then must ye break and cut likewise that part /
unto such time that it may be had forth. And even so likewise / if all the
rest of the body should be so swollen that it would not proceed ne come forth
/ then must it likewise be broken in pieces / and so had forth.

Farthermore if by chanse or bysease it come to pass that the mouth of the
matrice be exulcerat or apostumat / so that the passage be made the narower by
that means / the dryer and the more contracte / then must ye first study
and endeavor you to sople and ease the places by oils and other greces / such
as I spoke of sufficientlye before in the fyfth chapter with bathes and
fumigations.

Also if the dead birth come sydelonge / then must ye do what may be dove to
convert and torn it to such fashion / that it may most easyly be brought
forth: the matrice and other secreates must be anointed / perfumed / and
vapored with such things / the which may make it more ample and large / if
it can not be thus had forth hole: then let it be cut out by pese mele / as is
before spoken of. And if after this delyueraunce the flowers issue over
vehementlye / then use such things as have virtue to restrain them / of the
which I have spoken in the.vij. chapter before. But contrary to all this / if
it cha^se that the woman in her labor dye / and the child having life in it /
the^ shall it be mete to keep open the womans mouth / and also the nether
places / so that the child may by that means both receive and also expel
air and brethe which otherwise might be stopped / and the^ to turn her on the
left side / and there to cut her open / and so to take out the child / and
they that are borne after this fashion be called cesares / for because they be
cut out of their mothers belly / whereupon also the noble Roman caesar the.j. of
that name i^ Rome took his name.

How the infant newlye borne, must be handled, nouryshed, and looked to.
Cap.x.
AFter that the infant is once borne / by and by the nauel must be cut three
fyngers bredthe from the belly / and so knyt up: then as Auice^na writes / let
be strued on the head of that that remains / of the powder of bole arm
nyacke / and sanguis draconis / sarcocolla / myrrha and comyne / of each like
much beaten to powder / strewe on the cut of that piece that remains / then
upon that bind a piece of wool dypped in oil olyfe that the powder fall not
of: some use first to knyt the navel / and after to cut it so much / as is
before rehearsed.

And farthermore some say that of what length the rest of the navel is left
/ of the same length shall the chyldes tongue be / if it be a man child. Item
Auicenna says that diverse things may be known by merkynge of the chyldes
navel / for as he says / when the woman is delivered of her first child /
then behold the navel of the child / which if in that part of it which is
next un to the body it have never a wryncle / it proten death and does signifye
perpetual from thensforth sterilite or barennesse / and if it have any
wrynkles in it / then so many wrynkles / so many children shall the woman have
in time to come. Also some add to this and say: that if there be lytteli
space between these wrynkles in the navel / then shall there be also little
space between the barynge of the children / if much / it syngnifyeth long
time between the barynge of them.

Now to return to our purpose / when that the nauel is cut of / and the rest
knytte up: annoint all the chyldes body with the oil of acornes / for that is
syngularly good to confirm / steadfast / and to defend the body from noysom
things / which may chaunse from without: as smoke / cold / and such other
things which if the infant be greaued with all / streate after the birth /
being yet very tender / it should hurt it greatly.

After this annoyntynge wasshe the infant with warm water / and with your
finger (the nail being pared) open the chyldes nosestrelles / and purge them
of the fylthynesse. Item it shall be good to put a little oil into the eyes:
and also that the mother or nource handle so the childs syttyng place that it
may be provoked to purge the belly. And chieflye it must be defended from
over much cold or over much heat.

After that that the part extante or boging forth of the navel is fallen /
the which commonly chanseth after the third or.iiij. day then on the rest
remaynyng strewe the powder or ashes of a calfes houe burnt / or of snayle
shelles / or the powder of led / called read led / tempered with wine.

Farthermore when the infant is swadeled and laid in cradell / the nource
must give all diligence and head that she bind every part right and in his
due place and order / and that with all tenderness and gentell entreatynge /
and not crokedlye and confusely / the which also must be done oftentimes in
the day: for in this is it as it is in young and tender ympes / plants / and
twigs / the which even as ye bow them in their youth / so will they
evermore remayn unto aege. And even so the infant if it be bound and swadeled
/ the members lyenge right and straight / then shall it grow streate and
vpryght / if it be crokedlye handled / il will grow likewise / and to the ill
negligence of many nources may be imputed the crokednesse and deformite of
many a man and woman / which otherwise might seem well fauered as any other.

Item let the chyldes eyes be oftentimes wyped and cleansed with a fine and
clean lynnen clothe or with sylke: and let the arms of the infant be very
straight laid down by the sides / that they may grow right / and sometime
strokynge the bellye of the child before the vesike of bladder to help to ease
and to provoke the child to the making of water / and when ye lay it in the
cradell to sleep / set the cradell in such a place that nether the beams of
the son by day nether of the moon by night come on the infant: but rather
set it in a dark and shadow place: layenge also the head ever somewhat hyer
then the rest of the body.

And farther let it be washed two or three times in the day / and that anon
after stepe in the winter with hot water / in the summer with luke warm
water: nether let it tarry long in the water but unto such time as the body
begin to waxered for hete: but take heed that none of the water come in to the
infantes ear / for that should greatelye hurt his hearing another day.

Then to be short / when it is taken out of the bathe / let it be wyped and
handeled with gentell and soft lynnen cloth warmed / and then to lay it on
her lap the back upward / the which with her hands let her tenderly stroke
and rub / and then to lap it up / and to swadell it / and when it is
swadeled / to put a drop or two of water in to the nostrelles of it / is very
good for the eye sight. And so lay it to rest.

Of the nourse, and her milk, and how long the child should soucke.
AS conternynge the bringing up nourisshement and geuyng of suck to the
child / it shall be best / if the mother give her child suck herself / for
the mothers milk is more convenient and agreeable to the infant then any
other woman's / and more does it nourysshe it / for because that in the mothers
bellye it was wont to the same and fed with it / and therefore also it does
more desyrouslye covet the same / as that / with the which it is best acque^ted
/ and to be short / the mothers milk is most holsomste for the child. As
Auicenna writes: it shall be sufficient to give it suck twyse or thryse in a
day. And always beware / ye give not the child to much suck at once in this
tender aege of it / for clowyng of it / and lest also it loathe it / but rather
let it have often of it / and little at once / then few times / and over much
at once. For such as be over clowed with the mothers milk / causethe their
body to swell and inflate / and in their urine shall it appear that it is not
over come ne concocied or digested in the child / which thing yet if it
chaunse / let the infant be kept fasting / until such time as that the which
it has received already / be compleately digested. Item if the mothers milk
be somewhat sharp or egre / let her never give the child her breast
fasting.

If it be so that the mother can not give the infant suck herself / either for
because of syckenesse or that her breasts be sore and her milk corrupted: then
let her chose a holsom nurse with these conditions following.

First that she be of a good color and complexion / and that her bulk and
breast be of good largeness. Secondly that it be not to sone after her labor /
ne to long after / so that it be two months after her labor at the least /
and that (if it may be) such one which had a man child / thyrdelye that she
be of mean and measurable liking / neither to fat ne to lean. Fourthelye
that she be good and honest of conversation / neither over hastye or yrefull ne
to sad or soleme / nether to fearful or timorous: for these affections and
qualitees be parnicious and hurtful to the milk / corruptynge it / and pass
forth through the milk in to the child / making the child of like condition
and manners / also that they be not over light and wanton of behauoure.
Fyftelye that her breasts be full and have sufficient plenty of milk: and
that they be neither to great / soft / hanging / and flaggynge / ne to
little / hard / or contracte / but of a measurable quantity.

Also look upon her milk / that it be not blackysshe / blueysshe / gray or
reddysshe / neither sour / sharp / saltysshe / or brackysshe / nether thyn
and fluye / neither over gross and thycke: but temperatly white and pleasante
in taste: and to be short: that milk is best and most to be chosen of the
which a drop being mylked softelye on the nail of the thombe holdyng your
finger still / it rolleth not of / nether flytteth abroad / but if ye move your
hand a little it will slide of by and by: but if when it is mylked on the
nail it spread abroad / and flyt by and by / then is it to thyn: but if it
cleave still when that ye move a little your hand then is it so spysse and
thycke / the mean between both is best.

If it be so / that the nourses milk be to hot or sharp / then let her
never give the child suck her self being fasting.

Sometime it chaunseth / that the mothers or nourses milk does fail or
decrease / the which thing may come by diverse causes: as by syckenesse / by
decease in the breasts / or by taking of cold in the same / and so stop and
cludder the milk: or for because she lackethe such things / the which might
engender milk / other by over much fasting / hungre / and thirst: the
which causes must be well considered / and then according to that minyster a
remedy.

Things which do augment and increase milk / be those: let her use to eat
parsenyp / other the sede or the rote. Also the sede or rote of fenell soden in
the brothe made with barley or cicercula: let her eat of that with other
meats that she feadeth on. Item to eat shepes breast and the milk of them is
good. Item take an ounce of cow butter / and dissolve it in warmed wine / the
which let the nource drink. Item boxynge under the breasts does well / not
cuttynge the skin.

Item a plaster for the same of frankensence / mastycke / and pytche laid to
the breasts or under the breasts the skin first being anointed with oil /
left it should cleave over fast to the place. Item it shall be very good to
rub softelye with the hand the breasts / or else in bathing after dynner
or supper to cause some to suck her breast.

Item take the oil of white lyllyes or of violettes / and myngle with it musk
/ encense / and laudanum well tempered to gether / in the same dip a pese of
wool / and clappe it to the breasts / and soke them with it. Item wasshe them
/ and soke them often times with wine / in the which is decoct and soden myntes
/ roses / violettes / and xiloaloes. Also to eat of the brothe in the which is
soden a hen / with cynamome / maces / and cardamomum / and also the yowlke of
an egg. Item it is good for her to eat fresshe chese and milk / and to
refrain from all manner of great labor and hard works. Also potage made of
bean meal / rise / and bread made of fine flower / tempered with milk and
sugre / putting to it also a quantite of fenell sede or of the ^eues / is very
good for her.

Item take of anys sede / of syler montanum / of each.iii. dram^s / of
crystal beten to powder. u. dram^s / and as much of sugre / give her this to
drink about.x. days at morning / evening / and myddaye. Ite^ take of fenell
sede or the leaves / and of horehownde of each.ij. ha^ofulles / of ams sede
iiij. dram^s / of safrane beaten one scruple: also of fresshe butter.iij.
ounces / and sethe all these in sufficient water / making hereof a plaster /
and the same plaster whylst it is hot / lay it to the nourses breast.

Item take of common sede an ounce and an half / and of clarifyed honey.iij.
ounces: sethe it in.vi. li. wayght of water alto gether being put into a new
pot and let it sethe to the third part / and of this decoction give the nourse
the^ ofte^tymes to drink. Ite^ take of beetes well washed one ounce: of
co^myn half an ounce of honey.vi. ounces: of these myngled and tempered to
gether / make an electuarie / of the which let her take both in the morninge
and eueninge at each time a sponefull. Ite^ take two dram^s of crystal beaten
into fine powder and deuyde that in four equal parts / one of these parts
give unto the nourse the space of.iiij. days to drink / with brothe made
other of cicer / or else of peason: also all those things following increase and
augme^t milk in the breasts: annes and annes sede / dyll and the sede /
horehownde / cardomome / fresshe chese / wortes made of old ehece / cicer /
crislal beaten to powder and taken with honey: lettuse / fenell / wine in which
rosemary or serpillu^ be sode^. Ite^ to abstain from venery or man's company /
for if she use that / it shall spend and consume the milk and make it
unsavory and unwholesome: nether can the child well broke it / but most commonly
shall cast it up again / because it can not digest it Also it shall be best that
the child suck not of the mothers breast by and by as soon as it is borne: but
rather of some other woman's for a day or two / for because that the creme (as
they call it) streit after the birth the first day in all women does thycke^
and congeyle. Item if it chaunse that the nourse be over sore laxed / or that
she be over bound / so that she take any medycynes to remedy it / then let
another give the child suck / whylst she be recovered again. And when the
child is laid in cradell to be rocked: rock not to fast / lest through over
much rockyng and stearyng the chyldes stomach torn and the milk there
corrupt for lack of rest. Auicen auyseth to give the child suck two years /
how be it among us most commenlye they suck but one year. And when ye will
wene them / then not to do it suddenly / but a little and little / and to make
for it little pylles of bread and sugre to eat and accustom it so / till it
be able to eat all manner of meat: and this shall suffyce for the education
and bringing up of infantes at this time / notwithstanding diverse other
things here are left unspoken of / another time god willing we shall declare
them at large.

Thus ends the first book.
THE SECOND BOOK.
Of diverse deceases and infirmities which chaunse to children lately borne,
and the remedies therefore.
AL though there be in manner infinite deceases which happen to infantes / as
writes Hypocrates / Galenus / Rasis / Amce^na / and diverse other: yet for
breuite and shortness we will rehearse here only such of them / which most
commenly happen to the same / and that be those: Exulceration of the gummes /
flyx of the belly or over much looseness of the same / the belly hardbownd /
the crampe / the cough / and distillation of the head / short wynded /
bladders on the tongue / exulceration or chyppynge of the mouth / apostume in
the ears / apostume in the brain / swellynge and bolnynge of the eyes / skum
or creme of the eyes / the fever / knawynge in the bellye / the body swellynge
and puffed up / often sneesynge / whelkes or bladders on the body / swellynge
of the coddes / swelling of the navel / vnslepynesse / yexynge / appetyte to
perbrake / fearefulnes in the dreams / the mother / yssuyng out of the
fondament gut / worms in the belly / chawfynge / the falling syckenesse / the
consumsyon / the palsye / trymblynge of the parts of the body / the stone /
gogell eyes.

How to cure and to remedy all these / now will I show in order. First in
exulceration of the gummes are wont certain pusshes and as it were wheles
grow on the gummes or in the corners of the jaws / the which put the place to
much greuance: and to remedy this it shall be good that ye with your finger
rub the infa^tes gummes and the pusshes or whelkes with all: and then to
annoint the same gummes with ointment made of hens grese / hares brain /
oil of camomell mixed with honye / other else turpen tyne tempered with honey /
then take water / and in it sethe camomell and dyll / the which water being
hot: power it on the chyldes head / holding it a foot above the head.

Of the flyx or over much looseness of the bellye.
For this take the sede of roses / cu^myn / anyse and the sede of smalege:
beat all those together and make them plaster wise / and lay it to the
chyldes bellye: if it stynte not by this remedy / then take of the coagulu^ of
a kyd a half penny wayght or a little more / and give it to the child to
drink with cold water / and all the same day let the child be kept from
suckynge / lest the milk should curde in the stomach of it / but in the
mean while let it eat of the yowlke of poched eggs / or of white bread
soden in water.

And farther if that it which the infant voydeth be of / read or yelowe
color / then let drink, of the syrup of roses / or of crabbes / other
else of pome granates / tempered with a little mynte water.

child alsoo have a weak and waterysshe stomach / wherefore ye must help the
infant after this manner: first let the child suck less then it did before
/ and then alsoo mark that the which the child does perbrake / whether it
sauer sharpelye like vynegre / and that it be whytysshe: for if it be so /
then take of white frankensence.viij. graynes / of dried rue.xx. graynes /

it by this means / then demand farther counceill of the physytyons.

If the child be emcombred with the stone or with any other thing the which
may let, and stop the vryne / the which may be known by these tokens:
First if he have the stra^gury / if it be provoked often to pysse and yet can
do but little at once / and that with great pain and dolor / if the vryne
be thynne and clear / and also (being a man child) if the prycke be ever
standing: all which things ye shall remedy thus:

First bathe the child in water wherein is decocte malous / holyoke / lynsede /
and paritorye / then give it to drink some such thing which has qualite to
provoke vryne and also when the nourse lays it to sleep / let her annoynte
the pryuie parts with oil and give the child to drink the water of
mulberyes with milk / or otherwise: take the blood of a got / and the powder
of a burnt scorpion / with the oil of scorpions / or the oil of white lyllyes
tempered plasterwyse / and lay it to the chyldes bellye above the pryuie
members.

Of google eyes or lokynge a squynt.
If the child have google eyes / or that it look a squynt / then first set the
cradel in such a place / that the light may come directelye and right in the
chyldes face / neither in the one side / neither in the other / neither above
the head / lest it torn the syghte after the light. Also mark / on which
side that the eyes do gogle / and let the light come unto it on the contrary
side / so to return the sight. And in the night season set a candell on the
contrary side / so that by this mean the goglynge of the eyes may be
returned to the right place. And farther it shall be good to hang clothes of
diverse and fresh colors on the contrary side / and spetially of the color
of light grene / or yelowe / for the child shall have pleasure to behold
these strange colors / and in retornynge the eye syghte toward such things
/ it shall be occasion to rectifye the sight again: and this shall be sufficient
for this time of the dyseases of children / after they be borne making here an
end of this second book.

THE THIRD BOOK.
Of such things the which shall be entreated of in this third book. Cap.i.
IN these two precedente books we have sufficientelye for this time declared
such things the which are wont to happen unto women before their labor / in
their labor / and also after their labor / and farther of such infirmities and
deseases / which are wont to vex the infant after it is delivered into this
wordle / with competent remedies for the same.

And here in this third book (by the leave of god) shall brefelye be declared
such things which may farther or hinder the conception of man / which as
it may be by diverse means let and hyndered / so also by many other ways
it may be farthered and amended. Also to know by certain signs and tokens
whether the woman be conceived or no / and whether the conception be male or
female / and finally certain remedies and medycynes to farther and help
conceptio^ / and so to conclude this small tracte or treatyce.

Of conception, and how many ways it may be hyndered or let. Cap.ii.
THere is nothing under heaven which so manifestly and plainly does declare
and show the magnifice^t myghtynesse of that omnipote^t living god / as does
the perpetual and continual generation and conception of living things here
in earth / by the which is saved / proroged / and augmented the kind of al
things. And where that this almighty lord and creator has so institute and
ordained / that no syngular thing in it self (here upon the earth) should
contynually remain and abide / yet has he given from the beginning and
instincted such a power and virtue unto these mortal creatures / that they
may engender and produce other like things unto them self / and unto their
own sunilitude / in the which always is saved the sede of posterite / were not
this provision had by almyghtye god / the nature and kind of all manner of
things would sone perysh and com to an end / the which virtue and power of
generation many times does halt and miss / by defect and the contrary
disposition in the parts genera^t.

As ye may euidentlye see in the sowynge of corn and all other manner of seade
/ so that there be in all manner of generation three principal parts co^curre^t
to the same: the sower / the scade sown / and the receptacle or place
receauynge and contaynynge the seade. If there be fault in any of these three /
then shall there never be due generation / unto such time as the fault be
removed or amended. The earth unto all seades is as a mother and nource
contaynynge / clyppynge and enbrasynge them in her womb / feadynge and
fosterynge them as the mother does the child in her belly ormatrice / until
such time as they come unto the growyth / quantite / and per fection due unto
their nature and kind but if this seade conceived in the bowelles of the earth
do not prove or fructifye / then be thou sure that other there is let in the
sower / in the seade / or else in the earth. The earth may be over
waterysshe / dankesshe / or over hot and dry / or else full of stones /
gravel / or other rubryshe / or full of ill weeds / which may strangle and
choke the good corn in his growing / also the sede may be putrifyed / or
otherwise viciat and corrupted / and so the life and sprete of it vanyshed
away and destroyed. The sowar may vnordynatlye strewe and cast the seade on
the earth. etc. So that if there be let in none of these three parts
concurrent to generation / or that the lettes be removed and done away / then
doubt less will ensue multiplicacion and encreaseme^t of that kind / of the
which the seade comes / according to the natural enclination the which
almyghtye god has enplanted and set in the kind of all things.

How many ways conception may be let. and how the causes may be known.
Cap.iii.
EVerye thing then the which does increase in his kind must first be
conceived in the womb and matrice of the mother / which is apt and
conueniente for the receate of such seade. And as I said before / as there
may be defecte and lack in the mother receauynge the seade / so may there
be fault and defecte in the sower / and in the seade it self also.

And in woman there may be four general causes / by the which the
conception may be impedyte and let: over much calidite or heat of the matrice
/ over much coldness / over much humidite or moystenesse / and over much
dryenesse. Any of these four qualitees exceadynge temperancye / may be
sufficient causes to let due conception.

Wherefore the right excellent physician Hypocra^tes in the.v. book of his
Amphorysmes says: All such women the which have cold and dense matrices / can
not conceive / nor such as have moist and waterysshe matrices can conceive /
for the power of the seade is extynguyshed in it. Also having dry matryces /
conceive not / for the seade peryssheth for lack of due nutriment and fode /
but that matrice the which has all these qualities in temperancye / that is
fruytfull / this is Hypocrates saying / the which thing also may be well
perceived by a famylyer example of the sowynge of corn.

For if it be sown in over cold places / such as be in the parts of a
country / called Sithia / and in certain places of Almayne / or in such
places where is contynuall snow or froste / or where the son does not shine
/ in this places the seade or grain sown / will never come to proof / nor
fructyfye / but through the vehemente coldenesse of the place in the which it
is conceived / the life and quyckenesse of the grain is utterly destroyed and
adnyhilat.

And farther as concerning over much humidite: If ye sow your grain in a fen
or marysse and watery ground / the seade will perysshe through the over much
abounda^ce of water which extynguyssheth the lyuelynesse and the natural
power of the grain and sede.

Likewise if it be sown in such a country or place where is over great heat
/ not te^pered with water and rain / or if the year be so dry / that there
came no rain at al to alay the extreme and farue^t heat of the son / then
shall the seade sown whyther and dry away / and the power of it be consumed
and burnt.

Also if it be sown in dry places / where never comes rain / or on the
sand / and grauelye places / in such a place the grain can never take / ne
prove / ne be conceived in it to come to any fruit or profet.

Wherefore if the matrice be distempered by the excess of any of these four
qualities / then must ye reduce it again to temperancie by such remedies / as
I shall show you hereafter. Likewise may there be defecte and lack in the
man / as if the seade be over hot / the which the woman shall feale / as it
were burning hot / or to cold the which he shall feale / as it were in manner
cold as yise / or to fluye or thynne. etc. diverse other other ways also it
may be let / which shall not need here to be rehearsed.

Now if the woman can not conceive / the cause coming of over much
frigidite and coldenesse in the matrice / that shall she know by these tokens:
she shall feale great cold about the sides / the raynes of the back and the
matrice / her vryne shall appear white and thynnysshe / and sometimes also
somewhat spysse and thycke / and all manner of cold things shall noye her /
hot things shall greatly comfort her.

But if it come by over much humidite of the matrice / that shall she know by
these signs: If the body of her be of a fat and gross disposition / if
with her flowers issue forth at the beginning and the latterende of them
certain vyscous and waterye substance / and that her urine be white / thycke
/ and sometime as it were milk. Alsoo that she feale great cold and pain
about the matrice and pryuie parts / and much dolor in her sides and in the
raynes of her back.

And when over much heat or dries in the matrice / is cause of the
hynderaunce of conception / then is the vryne hye coldred / red or yelowe /
being thynne with certain motes appearyng in the water / the woman has
great thyrste / and bitter rysynge or belking out of the stomach in to the
mouth. And many times they that are in this case / are very spare and lean
in all their body / having also but small quantite of flowers / the which
thing may happen other by over much watch / or over much fasting / labor /
travel / sorrow / syckenesse. etc. But such women which naturally are thus
spare and lene / may very hardely be brought to a temperancye again and be
made apt to conceive. And this shall be sufficient for this time to know
which qualite by his excess causes sterilite / now will we show how it
shall be known whether lack of conception be in the woman or else in the man /
and how to know whether the woman be conceived or no / according to the
mind of right expert doctors of physycke.

How to know whether lack of conception be of the woman or of the man, and
how it may be perceived whether she be conceived or no. Cap.iiii.
IF ye be desirous to know whether the man or the woman be hynderance in
conception: let each of them take of whete and barlye corns / and of beenes
of each.vii. the which they shall suffer to be steped in their several vryne /
the space of.xxiiij. hours / then take.ij. pottes / such as they set
gylyflowres in / fill them with good earth / and in the one let be set the
whete / barlye / and beans / styped in the man's water / and in the other the
whete / barlye / and beans / styped in the woman's water / and every morning
the space of eight or ten days / let each of them with their proper vryne /
water the said seades sown in the forenamed pottes / and mark whose pot
does prove / and the seades therein contained does grow / in that party is
not the lack of conception / but see that there come no other water or rain
on the pottes.

Ite^ according to Hypocrates writing if ye will know whether the fault be in
the woman or no / then let the woman receive in to her body underneath /
being well and closely closed round about the fume of some odoriferous perfume
/ as laudanum / storax / calamyte / lignum aloes / musk / ambre / and such
other / and if the odor and savor of such things assende through her body
up unto her nose / ye shall understand / that sterilite comes not of the
woman's part / if not: then is the defecte in her.

Item if she take garlycke being pylled out of the husks / and conueye of it
into the pryuie parts / and if the sent of it assende up through the body
unto the nose / the woman is fautelesse / if not: then is there lack in her.
These are signs to know whether the lack be in the man or the woman.

Whether she be conceived already or no / ye shall know by these signs:
First the flowers issue not in so great quantite as they are wo^t / but wexe
less and less / and in manner nothing at all comes from them. Also the
breasts begin to wax rounder / harder / and styffar then they were wont to be
/ the woman shall long after certain things otherwise the^ she was used to
do before that time. Also her vryne waxes spysse and thyckysshe / by retension
of the superfluyties. Also the woman fealeth her matrice very fastelye
enclosed and shytte / in so much that as Hypocrates says / the point of a
nedle may scace enter.

Item to know whether she be conceaned or no / according to Hypocrates mind
/ in the.v. of his Ampho. give unto the woman when she is going to bed a
quantite of mellicratum to drink / and if after that drink she feale great
pain / gnawing / and tumbling in her belly / then be ye sure / that she is
conceived: if not / she is not conceived / this mellicratum is a drink made of
one part wine / an other part water soden together / with a quantite of honey.

But if ye be desirous to know whether the conception be man or woman: then
let a drop of her milk or twain be mylked on a smothe glass / or a
bright knyfe / other else on the nail of one of her fyngers / and if the
milk flewe and spredde abroad upon it / by and by then is it a woman child:
but if the drop of milk continue and stand still upon that / the which it
is mylked on / then is it sign of a man child. Item if it be a male / then
shall the woman with child be well colored / and light in going / her belly
round / bygger toward the right side then the left / for always the man
child lies in the right side / the woman in the left side.

Of certain remedies and medycynes which shall cause the woman to conceive.
Cap.v.
ALl sterilite then for the most part ensues and comes of the
dystemperancye of one of these.iiij. forenamed qualities / wherefore the remedy
and cure of the same when it chaunseth / must be done by such things / the
which have contracye power and operation to the excessyue qualities for by
that shall it be reduced to his temperancye again.

As if that coldenesse and moystenesse exceadynge temperancye in the matrice be
occasion of sterilite / then must she apply such things to that place / the
which be of nature hot and dry / the which may calify and warm the place
/ and alsoo dry up the ill moystenes and humors contained in the same /
hindering conception.

Wherefore take of sauyne / baytreleues / the flowers of camomell / melylote /
maiora^ / caprifolium / herba paralysis / cytron leaves / and such other things
of aromatycall and hot nature: and sethe these in water to gether / and let
the woman receive the vapor and fume hereof underneath in to her body through
some co^duite or pype made for that purpose: her clothes being close about her
/ that none of the vapor or air issue out / and over this let her sit all a
night / if she may / receauyng ever the fume hereof in to her body / and in
the morning let her accompany with her husband / and she shall conceive.

A bathe also for the same purpose: when the time of her flowers about the
end of the last quartar of the moon is almost fynyshed: let her bathe
herself in a bathe / where in is decocte and soden caprifolium / malowes /
french malowes / holyoke / rooses / iunyper beryes / parytarye / wild myntes
/ bay leaves / myrtylles / sauyne / camomell / pynpernell / myntes / maioram /
cytron leaves / basyll / penyryall / and such other. But before that she bathe
her in this water / it shall be best for her to be purged and cleansed from the
cold humors with theodoricon / or with benedicta / or with the pylles which
be called sinequibus esse nolo / to be had at the apothecaryes / and then let
her enter in to this foresaid bathe / and when she comes forth of the bathe
again / then let her take of diamargariton / or of muscata / to the qua^tite
of a nutte / drinking it with good and odoriferous or well sinellynge wine /
other else let her take of this electuarye following / which is very
excellent for that purpose.

Take of spyke / nuttemegges / cloves / zedoarium / galyngale / long peper /
dry rosesstorax / alipta muscata / of each of these like much / then take of
the root of tormentyll as much as of all the other forenamed things to
gether / and beat all these to powder / temperynge them with a sufficient
qua^tite of clarifyed honye / to the which also add a little of pure musk.
Of this electuarium both evening and morning the space of ten days let the
woman take to the mountenaunce of a nutte with good odoryferous wine bathing
her self also every day the space of the said ten days: at her coming
forth of the bathe / receauyng of the foresaid electuarye / then also let her
perfume her pryuities with the sauoure and fume of laudanum / frankencense /
xiloaloes / storax / ambre / alipta / xilobalsamum / and such other things.
And after this let her make a supposytarye anointed with magna trifera / or
esdra / with the powder of olibanum / and the dyle of bays myxte and tempered
to gether / and let her retain this supposytarye in her pryuities all the day
time the foresaid space of ten days / and then at the ten days end (the man
and woman accompanynge together) god willing / she shall be conceived / and
these be the remedies if the defecte and lack of conception come by reason of
coldenesse and moystenesse.

But if it come by distemperaunce of the matrice in hot and dry / first
let the humor which is cause of it / be purged by conneniente medycynes /
and then every night the space of ten days let her bathe herself in warm
water / nothing else being put unto it / and in this batthe let her remain
not long / and at her coming forth give her to drink of trifera magna / with
watered wine / and after this receive she the vapoure and fume of the decoction
of these herbs underneath into her privy parts: take violettes / beerefote /
parytarye / and penyryall / sethe them in water: and then conuaye in to the
same place a supposytary of trifera magna with the powder of olibanum.

Item a suppositarye which is wonderful good in expellynge and dowyng away
such things which let conception: take of siler montanum beaten to
powder.ij. dram^s / of the renatte of an hare the.iiij. part of a dram^ / and
temper these to gether with clarifyed honye and the oil of bays / and annoint
here with a supposytarye / the which let the woman retain in her secreates
the space of a day and a night.

Ite^ a supposytary made of hares dunge and honey tempered to gether / is very
excellent for the same purpose / but let the woman abstain from all manner of
salt and sharp meats / and use to drink good odoriferous and pleasant
wynes alayd with water.

Also to drink of the wine in which is dissolved musk / or else viscus
quercinus / is good to help to conception / also the heart bone of an heart /
and the scrapynge of yuery is very good for the same.

Item a supposytary for the same / which has been many times well proved for
that purpose: Take garlycke pylled and cleansed from the husks / and sethe it
in the oil of rooses / or else the oil of maioram unto the time that it be
dyssolued / and that all the moystenes be departed from it / then take it out
of the oil again / and stamp it / and then wrappe it in wool / and conuaye
it supposytarywyse in to the pryuie parts / and there keape it the space of a
day: this thing is marvelous good for conception / and has been well proved.

Diverse other lettes of conception and remedies for the same might here have been declared / which for breuite and shortenesse we for this time do let pass
/ making here an end of this treatise / the which we have composed and
translated out of Laten / to the honor of God / the vtilite and profette of
all honest matrones.

Deo gratias.
