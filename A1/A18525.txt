The prouffytable book for man^es soul / And right comfortable to the body /
and specially in aduersitee and trybulacyon / which book is called The
Chastysing of gods Chyldern

IN dread of almighty god Relygyous suster a short pistle I send you of the
matter of temptaco^ns* which pystle as me thinks may resonably he cleped The
Chastisyng of Gods Childern. Of this matter ye have desired to know in
comfort of your soul. But nedeful it were to you pacyently and gladly to
suffer such goostly chastysing with full faith and sad hope / and abide his
ordenau^ce till he send comfort by grace and by mercy. Sometime it falls by
the Lightwysnes and wysdom of god / the more knoweng a man has. the stronger
ben his temptacyons. And all his cu^nynge is hyd away / and stondyth him in
full lityl comfort. as for that time / in to that it pleyse god for his great
pity to comfort him by grace / so that in him is oonly our knoweng.
chastysing / and comfort / Also my suster I dread to write of such high
matters. for I neither have felyng ne knoweng openly to declare them in
englyssh tongue. for it passyth my wit to show you in any manner of common
langage the terms of diuynite. Also I feel myself unworthy to have the goostly
science / whereby I should know or have an Inward feling what doctors would
mean in her holy writynge The causes considered. and many other skylfully. I
may dread to write of this chastyfing But askyng help of god almighty / by
whoos might the ass had speech to the prophet Balaam after your desire as
ferforth as I dare or know of te^ptaco^ns / I will she we you in special and
in general: and to hem remedies with some other matters that lightly will fall
to purpose / submyttyng me evermore lowly to correccyon of wysemen and clerks.
and men of ghostly knowing. This pistle which I clepe chastysig of gods
chyldern / I will begin with ye same words which our lord Ihesu christ said
to his apostles / wha^ he badde hem wake and pray / before he went to his
passion / thise words I will follow. and with hem make an end. as god will
give me grace.

UIgilate et orate vt no^ intretis in temptacione^. Wakyth and prays that ye
enter not in to temptaco^n Thise ben the words of our lord Ihesu christ. the
which need none other declaraco^n than the same understanding of theselfe
words Therefore I leave diuysions of matters / plainly to write as god will give
me grace somewhat of temptaco^ns / and of remedy again hem. to your ghostly
comfort / Take now then good head of thise holy words / Wakyth and prays
that ye fall not in to temptaco^n / Ye shall understood / contynuell and besy
prayer: when he says / wakyth and prays / and when he says / that ye enter
not in to temptaco^n. ye shall understood that ye be not overcome with
temptaco^n / Thus have ye then by the techyng of our lord a special remedy
again al temptaco^ns and that is besie prayer / Prays then besely in all
time of need / But now to our purpos take heed what our lord says. He says
not prays that ye be not tempted / but he says that ye fall not in
temptacion That good lord knows well by his grace and ordenau^ce how
profitable it is to good men and wymen much to be tempted and to be
trowblid. ye semyth by his words which he spekyth by the prophet to a man or
to a woman that is trowbled / I am with him in his tribulacyon / I shall
deliver him. and I shall glorifye him. Of this we have ensample of our holy
faders which grievously were tempted. as ye shall here after. and among all of
our glorious lady which passed all other in holiness and most was troubled /
therefore he is disceyued ye wenyth he be holy for he is not tempted / For soth
it is to good men and wymen that traueyle to be perfyghte ben more tempted than
other which be recheles of living. And a cause why is / for a mountain the
hyer he is there is the gretter wind / In the same manner the hyer a man's
living is the strenger is the temptaco^n of his goostly enmye / Wherefore if men
or wymen of religyon or of any perfeccyon feel no temptaco^ns then ought
they sorest to dread / for then they ben most tempted when they feel hem not
tempted / therefore says saint gregory / Then art thou most assaylled when
thou felest the not assailed / Also when our lord suffers us be tempted in our
beginynge. he plays with us as the mother with the child. which sometime
flees away and hides her / and suffers the child to weep and cry: and
besely to seek her with sobbyng and we pyng. but then^e comes the mother
suddenly with merry chere and laughige beclippyng her child and kyssyng and
wipeth away the teres. Thus fares our lord with us. as for a time he
wythdraweth his grace and comfort fro us / In somoche that in his absence we
ben al cold and dry / swetnesse have we none ne savor in devotion / Slow we
ben to prayer or to traueyle / the wretchyd soul suddenly is changed and made
full heavy and full of sorrow and care Then^e is the body sluggy and the heart
full hard And all our spirytes so dulle. that the lif of our body is to us
noyous. All that we here or see thouh it be good yet for the time it is not.
And soth for to say / weary be we then^e of goodness / and like for to fall in
to vices: and feeble to withsto^de temptaco^ns Such heaviness we find in absence
of our fader / And yet our fader leuyth us nevertheless / but hides him for a
time and plays with us for great love / This absence and forsakyng for a time
the prophet understood well when he said. Lord forsake me not at all times /
therefore upon these words says saint gregory. he knew we ye he should be
forsake but for a while / that asked to be forsake not at all times / The
presence of our lord / I clepe his gracyous werkyng in us. And I clepe his
absence the wythdrawe^g of his comfortes fro us. But now some man that redeth
this / perauenture will say this is a strange play / what is this play that
thus heui we ben of the absence of our lord / The play of love is Joye and
sorrow which to come diverse times one after a another by the presence and by
the absence of him that is our love. this is a properte of love / that when we
have him present whom we love we know not how much we love. But when he is
away / then we perceive by his absence what matter we have to love him The joy
of his presence causes sorrow in his absence / not so that he is cause of
sorrow / But for his presence is to us so Joyful. that with his absence we
must needs be sorrowful: I have rehearsed here shortly what manner of sorrow we
have in absence. For ye shall have it more openly after But says now what Joy
comyth and matere of Joy by his blessed presence. Anon at his coming the soul
wexeth light and Joyful / the conscience is clear and much in rest. the
spirytes that were dull and deed ben quick / and ready to traueylle / and all
thing yt was hard and sharp. and Impossible to semyng. anon they wexe soft
and sweet. and all manner of exercise in fasting and in wakyng and all good
works of such exercise is turned in to mirth for great desire and love / The
soul is fyllid with charity and all manner of clennes / She is fed with such
ghostly swetnesse that for such great likyng in ghostly fedyng / all outward
things ben almost forgoten Then^e comes so merry meditaco^ns with plente of
teres of co^pascyon / teres of co^pu^ccion / teres of love / and of devotion /
and though there comen no teres there come other vysitaco^ns yt passen all
worldly mirth / and therwyth so great plente of grace / that what is asked it
is granted / what is. sought is found / and the yate of grace is opened to all that ask then to entree / By thise tokens which I have rehearsed / we mow
well feel and know the presence and the absence of our lord. Therefore that he
wythdrawe him not for yowre own defawte. wakyth and prays that ye fall not
in to temptaco^n / Vigilate et orate / and c^.

Of vj. pryncypal causes why our lord wythdraweth his comfortes fro his
chyldern / and of diverse manner of ghostly affeccio^s which sometime ben
wythdrawen for great necligence and unkindness Caplm / ij.
WHy our lord withdraws him fro some more than fro some / why he vysiteth
some more than some. we may not plainly determyn. But some causes of his
wythdraweng I will show now / or I write ferder more of any matere / and after
that I will show remedies to get again his presence / One cause may be that
the lover should fall not by pride: For many rich gifts and gladness of chere
/ which ben given and showed by the presence of our lord wheche should be our
love. The second cause may be that we sh^lde know our own Infirmyte / and
that is full prouffytable. for as saint gregory says / It is a great refecco^n
a man to see and know his own Imperfeccyon / The third cause is for man
should not hold himself siker For great trust of sikernes engenders
necligence and presu^pcion / and those two together inobedye^ce / The fourth
canse is that we should the more besely seek him / weep and cry after him / as
the child after the mother / The fyfth cause is that we should receive his
coming after his wythdrawyng with more Joye and gladness / The sixte cause is
that the should be the more wise and the more strong to keep him When we have
him All thise causes of wythdrawynge ben but for our prouffyte after gods
ordenaunce / But other causes there may. be for our own defawtes / sometime for
necligence / and sometime for vnku^nyng unkindness: Therefore this cause of
wythdrawe^g I will declare in party / for Itrow it be spe defull to men and
wymen in her beginyng to know of this matere wha^ they feel swetnes or
deuoco^n in ghostly living. After the saying of the philosophers: When ye see
the son^e is hye in the mydse of may / then has the son dowble virtue of
werkyng in trees herbs and all thing that is growyng. if ye planetes then^e
which govern the nature be well ordained / after that the time of the year
askith / Then^e draws the son^e the humors up in to the air / of the which
comen dew and rain whereby the fruit of the earth prouffyteth / and is
multeplied. Now to our purpose / in the same maner^ / when that clear sone our
lord Ihesu is lift up in our hertes above all other things of our kind /
then if bodily dysposicyon be well ruled after dyscreco^n If virtues. which
I clepe ghostly humors ben enhabyted by long exercise. which virtues shall
be presented with thankynges / and worshyppes to that clear son ihesu /
Then^e sometime of al thise virtues comes a sweet rayn of an inward
beholdynge. and an heavenly dew of the swetnes of the godhede. This is a
special werkyng of our lord Ihu christ in hertes of his lovers / And in all
his louyd chyldern. of this heue^li swetnes comes such a likyng to the heart
and to all the body. that it seems a man Inwardly / that fully he is beclipped
with the love of god / This likynge is more delectable to the body. and soul
than all the myrthe and likyng that all the world might give for the time: In
this likynge god sends in to the heart so great savors / comfortes. by
gifts of gladness. that it thinks for the time he is fulfullid with gifts of
gostly comfort / And of this comith a ghostly dronken^es. which falls to
diverse me^ in many diverse manners / This manner dronkenes makyth some men singe
and worship god for fulfylling of gladness / Some men in that time stirynge
with all the members of her body so that they must skyppe or ren^e or dance /
Some for Joye beat her hondes together / Some cry loud with an hye woys / Some
ben stille and may not speak. Sometime seems hem that all the world faren as
they done. And some have wonder that all the world fares not as they done /
Hem thynken oftymes that they may never forgoo the likyng that they have /
Some men that have such likyng wondren what hem eilen. and what thing it may
be that makyth hem so merry and Joyful. Sometime it happeth this likyng is so
great / that it semyth to some man that his heart should break for Joye / Such
maner^ werki^g ged wrouht oftymes to men and wymen in her first beginning /
when they drew to ghostli living. and when they turned hem holy to god / when
they forsook all worldly comfort. and put her hope fully in god / And yet for
all this they ben right tender as chylderne that need milk and soft mete and
sweet / For hard metes and sour they may not suffer / that is to say they may
not suffer no strong temptaco^ns For they may not ne cu^ne not suffer easily
the absence of our lord / For when they ben forsake alityll / that is to say.
when liki^ge and comfort is wythdrawen for a time / Anon they ben grutchynge.
and fall then in to such heaviness / that for defawte of knowing how they
should have hem in his presence / they ben so necligent in his abse^ce. that
some time they leave of much of her traueyle / by cause they have no likyng /
Here is a great unkindness / and for unkindness grace is often wythdrawen / But
this unkindness is caused of vncu^nyng Yet for it is god to know how we should
have us in his presence / yt for our vnki^dnes we cause not his absence / Also
how we should have us in his absence that for any sloth or neclige^ce we lose
not his presence / Of this matere somewhat shortly I will weyte and show some
short remedy to have aye^ our love wha^ he is wythdraw But yet leest yt ye
lose him in your own defawte / wakyth and prays that ye fall not in to
temptaco^n / Vigilate et orate and c^.

How a man shall have him in receyui^g of grace and ghostly vysitaco^ns and how
some be^ begyled with a falls swetnes / when they be^ vysited with any such
co^fortes iij.
HOw we should know ye presence of our lord Ihu. I have reherced before but
some for vncu^nynge of receyui^g of his yefte and al such gostly co^fortes
wene yt they receive hem by her own merits / and that they deserve hem for
her own traueyle / This is a foul blindness: which lets and dystroyeth ye
flowers / and the fruits of al goostly virtues / ne here is no love showed to
him yt mynistreth al matter of love and what he be yt thinkith thus / he has
him not dewely in the presence of our lord Therefore it is needful to each man
to set his heart in lowenes at all maner^ times / and namly in wonderful
werkynges of our lord. and in his confortable visitaco^ns. that he of his
endless might may so work. and of his great goodness will vysite so poor a
creature with so plenteuous yeftes And well may he set him in lowenes / for
what ever he deseruyth It comes only of god / and yet each low spirit
thi^kyth him unworthy to any such yeftes / So then I trow it be full
spedefull to each man lowli to receive the presence of our lord / that is to
say his wonderful visitaco^ns. and such ghostly likings which are not had
but by his presence and with a meke spirit yeui^g up thankynges with enterly
deuoco^n / chynkyng and saying such maner^ words / A gracyous lord christ Ihu
goddis sone full precious ben thy yeftes / worship be to the without end in
all thy noble been feytes / I am not worthy ne can not thank the as I ought of
debt but after the cu^nyng that I have / thank the my lord for all this
gostly comfort. Good curteys Ihu take me in to thy governance / and save me by
thy keeping after thy most pleysure. In not^e pr^is et filij. and c^ Or else
in latin ye may say thus / Laus tibi xp^e pr^is verbu^ su^t hec tua dona de
cuius veniu^t munere tanta bona Agimus tibi gra^s oip^os deus pro vniuersis
bn^ficiis tuis / qui viuis and regnas deus per oi^a scl^a scl^orum / Salua me
pie Ih^u in tua custodia sicut scis and vis ad bn^ placitu^ tuu^ dn^e. In noi^e
pr^is. and c^. With such lownes and tha^kynges we should receive the yeftes of
our lord / wha^ it pleyseth hi^ of his grace to vysite us / Ferdermore yet
other there be^ which be^ not dewli in ghostli visitaco^ns. for some rest to
sore / and more delight have of the comfort and such maner^ swetnes. tha^ of
the gracious lover / ye freeli yeueth such gifts This is also a foul
bli^dnes and derknes. which feblith al ye myghtes of the soul. and lets
the knowe^g of very sothfastnes / and sometime it happeth yt with such me^
abides a maner^ falls swetnes by the craft of the fend / Therefore how ye
should void such maner^ be gilinges. and how ye should have you in receyui^g
of such yefte Iwyll sheew you first by ensample / and afterward more openly
to the same purpose Among al bestes ther^ is a gracious best / which me^ call
apes. a be is so wise in ki^de yt when it will abide still / it will abide
and rest in a hieue with his felawes / and wha^ there is no tempest in a
pesible weder while the son^e shines it gooth out and seeks flowers. in the
which he may find swetnes. But be the flower never so fair / or have never
somoche swetnes it rests upon non^ but wiseli does her profit and draws
out honey and wax. which bears to ye hieue that she cam^ fro. and there abide
with her company. and werketh in kind till time com^ that ye son^e shine aye^
/ and that it goth and tastes aye^ of many fair flowers: but evermore ye fruit
of swetnes she bears to the hieue / Thus shall each wyseman do that is in
ghostly living he shall with al meknes and al gladness of spirit wha^ our lord
Ihesu lightneth his heart inward receive his yefte. and taste the swetnes with
reyson and discreco^n / and behold wisely ye qua^tite of his benefeytes. and
take hem as comfort as of ghostly liki^ge But he shall not abide and rest upon
such co^fortes be they never so fay^ / ne savor they never so sweet But with
ye comfort and swetnes / and with all the benefeytes / he shall turn and flee
aye^ to the hyue / yt is to our lord with worshippes and thankynges / and
there abide and rest till the son^e shine aye^ / yt is to say till Ihu crist
lightneth his heart / and ordeneth hi^ by grace to flee about while time is
merry to taste of his benefeytes / But evermore as I said ye comfort and the
swetnes that he fi^deth he shall lowely bear aye^ to our lord in whose worship
he receives and gadreth all such swetnesse / If ye receive in this maner^ the
vysitaco^n of out lord. then shall ye have you deweli in our lords presence
/ And that ye may so have you wakyth and prays that ye fall not in to
temptaco^n Vigilate^ c^.

How desolate a man stondeth in absence of our lord. and how lowli he shall
bear him when comfort is wythdrawen. Caplm iiij.
HOw must we see ferdermore / when he wythdraweth him. how lowely we should
bear us in pleysure of him. to get again his presence / I liknyd before the
coming of our lord to the virtuous werkyng of the son when he is at his
height in the middle of may / And for asmoche as I purpose to write of this
wythdraweng I make an other liknes of the son going dou^warde. Wha^ the son
in time of year begyn^eth to wythdrawe dou^warde / then^e re igneth he in a
planete that we call Virgyne. and the cause why it is callid virgyne is for
that time of the year it is not fructuous no more than a maid yt bears no
fruit of children / In this time of the year / the hete of the wheder is
mynysshed. hard fruit corn and wine ben gadered home: And then is some
seeds sown to prouffyte of man: Als^ the werkynge of the son^e as for that
year is then^ fulfillid. For thene he withdrawith his werkyng. In the same
manner when our glorious son^e christ Ihu begyn^eth to come down / and to hide
in the inward shinynge of his son^e beme / and when he forsakyth us and leuyth
us alone / then is there lityll fervor of love: then fi^de we us full poor
and al forsaken as outla was that was before likyng / and hete is then full
cold and alayed / and all that was so plenteuous is come in to need and
pouerte / Then^e of your wretchydnes we wonder / and see where is all this
fervent love and tha^kyng to god. Where is all this ly: king and worship to god
/ where is all the souls comfort. gladness and savor / what may this be.
Wheder is all this become. Why fai^^th this now / how is it / that all this
strong love / and all thise noble yeftes ben away and deed / Thus we fare as
me^ unwise / that think our traueylle lost / and some time in some men and
wimen / the bodily kind is feblid by a soden heaviness in her begin^ing and they
wot not whi / and that is sometime for a strife between the spirit and the
flesh / Some by sloth and folly / wylfully leave her traueyle some fall in
doubt wheder they shall traueile or no^ Some wha^ they should sleep. then hem
list wake and pray

Some when they should wake and pray. then hem lust to sleep. But many by
grace keep her Journey. and then falls to hem which will a bide and
traueyle / that sometime our lord for great love preueth hem sorer than other /
for then of his suffrau^ce they lose outward benefaytes and likings / that
his to friends and kynes me^. and lightly be^ forsake of al other knowleching /
they that did him chere before have him now in soorne / troth find they
nowhere / but wrongs / detracco^ns / and unkindness. They have also great
infirmytees in body and in soul / Some fall in perplexitees for a thing ye
naught is to charge or lityl And there they cowde counsel other. in that and
other doubts / then sto^deth himself desolate and in great doubt / Some ben
so hard preuyd with goostly temptacyons / which passen all dyseases. that
what for dread and doubt / all comfort is lost / sauf oonly hope of mercy /
Of such goostly temptaco^ns and trybulacyons ye shall see more openly
afterward / A good god what grace is in thy presence / how precious is thy
love / When all love and grace fails in thine absence / Now then it were
good to know how a man should bear him in all this sorrowful morning. First I
counsel every man to think or put it to his own defawte that grace is
wythdrawe by some maner^ neclygence / or special defawte by dyssolute bering /
or for withdrawe^g the heart from god by diverse vayn thoughts. and though his
conscye^ce deem not this always in special / yet good it is to dread / and as
openly as he can often declare his conscye^ce to his goostly fader / In special
if he can. or else in general words. And this is a souerayn medicyn to al
temptaco^ns Also he shall not leave his traueyle for no maner^ heaviness / for
your prayer savor not as at that time / It is accept full hye to god. and
turns peraue^ture to more mede. than though he vysited with likynge and
swetnes: And yet I will not counsel that he keep always the same time of
prayer / for sometime it is spedeful to leave it for good intent / For what
occupacio^ it be / prayer or meditaco^n. redyng writing / or else good
comenyng or what thing it be / that most steryth him to the love of god / that
I hold spedefull to use / as for that time / for that dryueth away heaviness /
and comfort the soul / Also it is nedeful in all such time to take bodily
sustenau^ce / and other nedeful rest in reasonable maner^ / and so the soul
may be too wblid that hit is need that he take a soppe in ale or in wine before
mete. and after for comfort of the spyrites to be the more strong against heavy
temptacyons. Also is is good to such men and wymen to visit seek folk that
be^ holden goostly lyuers. and with al meknes commend hem to her prayers. and
if need be ask hem of her counseyle. Also for lowenes it is a another remedy a
man in such disease set himself at naught / and think in his heart that
naught he has / naught he had. ne naught may have. but oonly of god and after
ensample of Job he may then say or think / Our lord has yeuen / our lord
has taken away / as it pleyseth our lord so it is do / blessid be the name
of our lord god / Sn^s dedit dn^s abstulit sicut dn^o placuit ita factum est
sit nomen dn^i bn^dietu^. Also he may think or say. Good merciful lord if
it pleyse the that I ^e thus poor of all maner^ comfort then will I desire
this pouertee that thy holy will be fulfilled in me. And though the will of
kind grutche / the will of the spirit grutcheth not. and though I will but
fayntly / my will is to will perfyghtly. that thy will. and not my will in

By such manner of laws we may soonest purchase the presence of our lord
Now thus have I showed you of the play of love / and a lityll I have spoken of
the matere of temptaco^ns / But now of ye mater^ I think more openly to write
/ as god will give me grace / but to eschew the peril of indiscreet heaviness in
our lords absence / contynual prayer is evermore nedful Wakyth therefore and
prays that ye enter not in to temptacyons.

How our lord chastyseth his chyldern by ensaple of the mother and of her
loving child / caplm v.
I Likened before the play of our lord with men and wyme^ which ben new
converted to a loving mother / that lists to play with her souking child /
which mother in her play sometime hydeth her / and comes again to know by the
countenance of the child how well it loves ye mother / But now we must see
ferdermore. how ye mother preueth the child after the tender age A good loving
mother suffers her child to souke / and tenderly nourysshed till it have more
stre^g the to suffer more hardness / Then^e she wythdraweth a lityll and a
lityll the milk and other delicacyes. and makyth asaye of harder and sharper
metes to nourissh hi^ forth in hardness / She wythdraweth her glad chere. and
spekyth sometime sharply / Sometime she threteth. and if the child woxe wanton
she beteth him first with a lityll rod / And the strenger he wexeth the
gretter rod she takyth. and sharply beteth on Sometime to keep him in. when
needs he would out / And if he have been out against the moders pleysure / she
fetches him home again And as a loving mother she receyuyth him gladly / But the
more she louyth him ye sharper she beteth him / to make him abide at home / and
all is for love / For loath she is to forgoo her child / the which she derely
louyth. Now to our purpose on the same manner. our good loving lord Ihesu
christ goodis sone first in the beginning of his dear chyldern which ben
goostly lyuers / he fedyth hem with soft metes / which is goostly swetnesse /
But after time they ben strengthed by exercise of virtues / he with draws in
party that swetnes / and asayeth hem with bytternesse. he takyth fro hem rest
of heart: and suffers hem be trowblid. to preue well her pacyence / easily
first wythoutwarde things / as bacbitynge and soornes / repreues. and wrongs
/ and worldly dyseases / He spekyth afterward sharply / and brings hem in
ddredfull doubts / And if they were wanton by dyssolute beryng in heete / or
in deed / First he smyteth softely with easy temptacions / And ^^n they never
so easy / yet they grieve the soul. For how ever the soul before was
chastysed with doubts and dredes. it felt no smerte sharply till the rod
came. Which I clepe temptaco^n / The strenger ye soul is to the love of god /
by meknes and suffraunce. the sharper rod our lord takyth. for after the
soul may bear / he mesureth the strekes of temptaco^ns If the soul he
necligent / or else by Infyrmyte will walk out abroad to any manner vanyte.
our lord smyteth then sharply with some manner temptaco^n. to take fro him
that vain lust and for he should abide with him. and lose not his love: And if
it hap by suffrau^ce that ye soul has be far out. assentyng or
perfourmyng to any manner vanytee Yet will not that loving lord lose his dear
child / but by grace he clepyth him / and if he wylfully come home / gladli he
is received / And for love that our lord has to his chosen child bitterli
he beteth him to purge him for his trespass / and touches him with sharpnes
evermore to abide at home in our lords seruyse / and all this chastysing is
for love / For as our lord says himself. he chastises whom he loves /
Chastysing may be in many manners / But by cause your intent is oonly to here of
te^ptacyons / therefore at this time I leave al manner other chastysing / plainly
to speak / and write of the sharpnes of thise ghostly rods / which I clepe
temptaco^ns But or I write any more / first always I counsel you. wake and
pray that ye fall not in to te^ptaco^n. Vigilate and c^

Of vi-generall temptaco^ns and other in special / caplm vj.
No man may. nombre te^ptacyons in special but some temptaco^ns I will sheew
in general. which fall gene: rally to diverse men in each degree. and
afterward I will show some te^ptaco^ns in special / with the which goostly
livers ben more specially traueylid than other men / Vj. general temptaco^ns
there ben which traueylen a man's spirit thise temptacyons ben medlid after
the setting of a ma^nis bodi that is to say / before and behind / and above
and beneth / on the right side and on the lift side / The temptaco^n that is
beneth is repreuable. the temptacyon that is above is wonderful. the temptacio^
that is before is dredful the te^ptaco^n that is behind is unseemly. the
temptaco^n that is on the right side is mouable / the temptaco^n that is on the
lift side is grievous. The first ye is of beneth comes of our own flessh /
which s^orneth us al day with glosig and flatri^g. by cause we should follow his
lust and desires / and this te^ptaco^n is repreuable / The second temptaco^n
tha^t is c^eped above / is of our reison / which is the over part of our
soul / as when reison assenteth / and deliteth / and is drawn to serve the
flesh / which should be subget to reason / and this temptaco^n is wonderful.

The third temptaco^n that is clepyd before / is wicked I^^sions. and falls
suggestyons of the wicked deuylses. the which ever more whether we become
wakyng or slepyng they cast gynnes to catch us that uneath we may escape / and
this is full dredefull / The fourth temptacyon, that is behind / is mind and
thought of sins before done with lykyng and pleysau^ce of ye flesh in
vanytee / or any thing that naught is, and this is unseemly / The vtemptacyon
that is on the right si de / is of great prosperity. as when all fortune and
case fallen to a man evermore abidynge without any loss or disease / This is
meuable. as a bird that flees. Which sometime is so merry / that in his best
flighte falls down and deyeth and that is meuable / The sixth te^ptacyon that
is on the lift side / is great aduersite. which somlyme bri^geth the soul in
to so great heaviness / yt either it makyth him sore grutche against god / orels
to think and say amys against god. and al is to bri^ge him into to dispeyre /
and this te^ptacion is grievous / Of thise vi. te^ptacyons generally I clepe him
for bo the worldly men and ghostly men be^ traueylid with such temptaco^ns
some man more / and some sesse. some with one and some with an other. after
dysposico^n of kind / and ordenau^ce and suffrau^ce of god / so that every man
in each degree is somewhat traueled that most done her befinesse to come to
perfight love / for to him the devil has most envy / Therefore as I said
before to some goostly livers. there fallen many dredes both waking and
slepyng / to some by horrible sightes / to some by wonderful heryng / and to
some by dredful bodily felyng / Also to some in her begyn^ynge comes
Imagynacyon of dreadful things / which they may not put away but by a
special grace of god / To some such thoughts be^ so dredful and grievous.
that gladly they would suffer all manner bodily pains / if it plesed god / so
they might be deliuerd of such manner thoughts / for then the soul dredeth
so sore / yt he recstyth not of the body. Aslonge as the soul pacyently
suffers such te^ptaco^ns. and desires not by will of reison to have him away
/ but to the plesing of god so long these temptacyons ben no sin, but
purgacyon for the soul, and hye increase of merit / But when a a man desires
him always for his own ease. and not to plesing of god Ye and though he would
gladly suffer all bodily pains for to be delyuerde of hem and Yet in asmoche
as he desires his own will. for his own ease / he falls into a another
te^ptaco^n by that desire / and sin^eth / for asmoche as he asse^teth to that
unreasonable desire again the will of god / And then such temptacyons of
thoughts ben not merytory to the soul / by cause of the unreasonable
grutchi^g. but rather peraue^ture pain for grutchyng / For as saint gregory
says / Each syn^e that is not soon wasshte away by sacrament of penance. as
by co^ tryco^n / and confession. either it is sin / and cause of sin
following or else it is syn^e / and pain of sin done before / So it semyth
well yt when a man wylfully grutchyth again such temptaco^ns. ye shall abide
much the longer / and then such temptaco^ns ben pain of sin / Such
dredful thoughts that I have spoken of / it needs not to specyfie. for they
that have be chastysed with such ghostly temptacy o^s / knowe^wel in her
souls what I would mean / Also it is peryllous to specify such thoughts /
for some ben traueyled with one thought / that a another man or woman would
never. ne never perauenture should Imagyne such a thought but by other men's
tellyng Therefore I will not show such thoughts inspecyall: Also though I
would I may not / ne can not / For there was never man ne woman that herd or
asayed hem all / Therefore I said before / no man may nombre in special
which all te^ptacyons, for they ben out of nombre. But yet some will I show /
which most comunely false in me^nys speech. and openly to knowenge / Some when
they here any mischeef fall to any man or woman / or here hem speak any hard
words or dreadful before her death / anon by temptaco^n they fall in to a
dread / ye long time after they may not put it fro her hertes / for night and
day / in prayer and all other times they ben so trowblid therwyth that verily
almoost they vaast away for dread of the soul / and makyth hem desire the death
of the body for to be deliuerde of that temptaco^n / but that desire without
pleysing of god is sin / as I said before. Thus it fares by hem also that
will ymagyne of the predestynaco^n and of ye prescience / or of the
foreknowinge of god. And such men sometime ben dredful for sins done before /
and some time to dreadful. Wherefore some ben in point to fall in dispeyre /
some again her will ben trauey led with dyspeyre / Notwythstondyng they know
well our lords mercy passes all her sins. Some also ben traueysed with
points of the faith much against her will / and with such thoughts stonden
and abide in great dread and doubt what god will do with hem / With such
maner^ hardness our lord asayeth his chyldern in the begyn^yng after her
conversion. These* many such moo be^ in his goostly rods / with the which
sometime he threbeth, and sometime sha^rly he smyteth to keep in his chyldern
that they should not sterte abroad fro the soole of love / Other rods there
ben / that some men dread sorer. for to some of tender kind they ben much
more dredful. sauf oonly the temptaco^n of dyspeyre which comunely comes of
hem / or with hem / Thise temptaco^ns yt Imeane ben horrible sightes / and
dredefull ferdnes of wicked spirytes which come to some as well as wakyng as
slepyng / as I said before Some time they tarry the body outward / felingly
that a man may not sleep / ne ete / ne pray / ne drink in rest / Some have had
oftfithes sweet savors two days or three togider. or longer time / that wheder
ever they went / or what ever they did / it semyd as they smellid spyces. This
savor may be a temptaco^n and yllusion of the devil / As when it lets
deuoco^n or prayer / Also some in the country have had sometime wyckid savors
and foul stenches in her nose, mouth / and throat. and all is yllusion of the
wyekyd spirit to let a man / when he sees him so feuent in the beginning.
Sometime they have power to traueyle the body with Informyte. and somtymee they
enter in to ye body by the suffraunce of god: and feeble so the bodily
strength / that the kind wits and strength of ye soul ben febled Also for
the time so forth. that what such a man spekyth or does for that time. it is
by that wyckid spirit / Some men also and wymmen ben tempted with presu^pco^n,
or sterynges of vain glory for bodily virtues / and ghostly for special
yeftes and comfortes: or for specyal grace that they have to comfort other / by
writing or cunnyng. or for reuelaco^ns. or vysio^s or for some other special
yeftes of god / which they have bigrace more passingly than other / Thise
te^ptaco^ns and like to such ben more peryllous than other / which I have
reherced before Therefore I have showed hem here. and remedies against hem I will
show herafter. Moo tomp taco^ns ye shall see in the v. chapyters following /
how some for unstableness fall in to diverse ghostli siknes / And how some for
unlust fall fro perfecco^n. and live all contrariously against goddis techyng.
Other temptaco^ns in this chapter I showed not in special more tha^ I have.
for what ever temptaco^n it be that I have not rehearsed or spece fyed here. it
is a spyce or a brau^che of some of those that I have showed in special or in
general / And for as ye see that te^ptaco^ns be^ so dreadful and without
no^bre / wakyth and prays yt ye fall not in to te^ptaco^n / Vigilate / and c^

How a man shall conferme hi^ to our lord in sotnes and hardness / and how some
for grutchyng be^ forsaken of our lord. for that time / and litly falen in to
ghostly infyrmytees / Cap^m vij.
IN certain time of the year / the son^e begyn^eth in a planete that me^ call
libra / that is asmoche to say as a balau^ce / for then the days and the
nytes stand eue^like. for then^e the son^e departs even / and like
proporco^n the lit and the derknes / In the same maner^ our lord Ihu christ
stondyth with his ghostly childern which vtterli have forsaken hemself / and
stand eue^ after the will of our loving lord When that our blessid lord
Ihesu will visit hem with swetnesse. or chastise hem with sharpness / wha^ it
is his pleysure to send derknes or clerenes of lite / or what ever he put to
his childern / always they sto^de eue^ in all maner^ thing: sauf only in sin^e.
which is neteful to flee for that comes not of god / And wha^ such childern
be^ perfitly ordained and stabled / and lack all comfort / and be^ forsake of
all creatures / if they can then^e well gader togider fruit and herbs of
virtues than shall the^ be plenteuous / for all her virtues ben then ripe and
perfyte and well tempred without any grutchyng of ye soul What ever then ye
body may do or suffer gladly the soul offer that our lord god / Also all
other inward virtues that ever he had before in likyng of the love of god he
has then after his knowing offer hem to Ihesu christ and with all traueyle
and with all the heit have h^ in exercise / Such oblaco^ns and mekenes with
wertues living ben more acceptable to god / and more worthy / more noble / and
more clener than ever they were before then and stondeth in such perfecco^n
/ yt gladly he will lack all maner^ comfort that ever god yaf him before and
sto^ de even at goddis will / not in lit now in derknes / and take all this in
like well / so it be to the worship of god / In this maner^ as I have rehearsed
each perfyte liver shall gader in the fruit of virtues / with you which he shall
be rich and plenteuo? and dwell in the presence of god ever more lastyng. By
such men's living. and ensample of her patience / all other men that hem knew
or be with hem conuersaunt / or famylier ben taught and amended / and prouffyte
in virtue / so that the fruit and the herbs of her virtuous living be set
and sown / and plenteuously multyplied to other men's prouffyte / Every such
man yt has this prefeccyon / and comyth to this lownes and suffrau^ce is first
sharply threted and assayed. well prouyd. and tempted of god and of him self.
and of all creatures / Therefore the forsakyng of himself / and of his own
will. is to him a special and hye perfeccyon / nevertheless each man that shall
be saved / must forsake his own will: and put his will to goddis will. For
else he is not obedyent to our fader in heaven / But now ye shall know
ferdermore. that in this same time of the year / the son comes down. and
the weder is full cold / therefore in some unwise man and vnauy sed the wicked
humors ben styred. and make the stomocke replete / wherefore they fall in to
diverse siknesses / They put always all delight and savor of metes and drynkes.
and sometime it happeth that they bring some men or wymen to the death / Of
such evil humors. some men ben changed out of her own kyndely complexion
/ and fall in to a dropesie or other Infyrmitees: Also sometime of unkindly
humors wexe perilous fevers by which siknes after long langour men oftymes
deyeng: In the same maner^ when some me^ of goosily living / or men of good
will or men that have assayed of ghostly swetnes / and of other yefte of god
fall away fro sothfastnes. and by necligence and Infirmytee goo out fro god /
and out fro the scole of love / Anon they wexe so seek that either they fall
fro virtues of else they fall in to peril of death. or else utterly they
lityll / and deye by long contynuau^ce of ghostli sickness For an unwise man
or necligent that indiscreetly governs himself. lightly falls in to these
Infyrmytees / by cause yt time is to him cold / Wherefore the kindly werkynge
of virtues and of good deeds wexen slow and unreasonable Such a man desires
and sekyth the prouffyte and ease to the body / more than hem nedith / Some men
by such Infirmytee desiren comfort of god / so he would send it him without
traueyle and pain / Some think they ben so feeble and so tender. and waasted
for age / or for traueyle / yt all thing they thike nedeful what ever they may
get to the rest and profit of the body / Some seken comfort and solace of men
and wymen. and of other creatures more than needs: whereof fallith great
peril of soul. when such men vnresonably and vndyscretly incline so to the
rest and co^modyte of the body / then all these wicked humors make thr
stomach repfete / that is to say / fulfill the heart with evil will / and
let the savor of all good virtues / Also when such men wexe seek for cold /
then they fall in to ye dropesie / and anon they ben ouercharged with water
/ that is to say they desire worldly goods / And ye more they have the more
they coueyte / by cause they ben seek of the dropesie. the body that is to say
the lust and couetyse vexen fast / and swelle^ great. But the thurst is never
the less / The fat face that is the conscience wexeth lene. for he has
lost the savor of good metes / that is to say he lackyth ye fruit of grace.
For they will not work with grace / and this is the cause of all thise
siknesses for werki^g with grace is needful / as ye shall here and see after.
now then^e first will I speak of ghostly fevers / and so fourth of diverse
mennys errors / But that ye fall not in to no such siknes ne errors: wakith
and prays yt ye fall not in to te^ptacion / vigilate / and c^

Of four ghostly Infyrmytees which ben likned to four diverse fevers / Caplm
/ viij
Dnuers men as I speak of which ben so replete of wicked humors / that is to
sa ey to vnskylfully / and vnresonably ben encliued to lusts and cases of the
body. fallen often times in to four maner^ of fevers. Diverse men in to diverse
fevers / after he is dysposed. The first feuer^ is callid a cotydian / in
which is properly in ghostly meuyng a varyaunce of the heart. For some there
ben that will know of all things and of each living. they common of each
matere / and entremete of each cause / both of temporell and spirytuell many
things they deem and blame. but often times they forgete he^selfe / Gladly they
bear outward charges and besinesses / And if they here any word of matere of
disple sure. lightly they ben styred. and sometime trowblid. Her thoughts ben
full chau^gable. now here / now there / now so / now thus like to wind / this
is cotydian fever / for with such varyaunce / they ben tarried and occupied fro
morrow to even / and some time of night both slepynge and waking / Also
though this Infyrmytee may some time stand without dedely sin: It lets
nevertheless goostly exercise and savor of god. And so long it may last that
it brings the soul in to peril / The second fever is callid a tercian:
which may be said Inconstau^ce / or unstableness / And all though this goo
and come. yet it is peryllous / This fever tercian comyth sometime of an
vnordynate hete and somtym^ of cold they that have the tercyan the which
comyth of hete / ben such men yt when they ben styred to deuocyonor when they
ben towehed of our lord with any ghostly comfort or else after time they have
assayed and lived in perfyght living if our lord then^e leuenth hem / and
suffer hem stand allone. some of hem fall anon in to unstableness / for this
day they chese one living or devotion. tomorow they chese a another. One certain
time. or one hour they will keep seylence. an other time they bucke the rule.
and gladly they will speak and common / Some time they will give largely her
goods for the love of god / and sometime they ben so hard / that neither they
will give ne lene Some time they will goo on pylgremage / Sometime they will be
recluse / so^time they will singe often if they be priests / and somtym^ they
take but little head of that maner^ devotion All thise fall of unstableness
which noyeth much a man / and lets of goostly understanding and puts
away the ground of perfeccyon / But takyth here head whereof this unstableness
comyth: When a man sets or stablith his entenco^n and his besines and
werkynges more to outward exercise of virtues / than to god Inward / or to be
united in heart and in spirit with god / notwythstondyng though he be then in
grace / by cause he dwellith in virtues. yet his lif is chaungable and unstable
/ For as much as he felith not him rest in god perfyghtly above all virtues /
Therefore such a man has that he knows / for he has him in himself / who^
he sekyth without with great bodily and goostly exercise.

Therefore if a man will put away or overcome this unstableness. he must rest him
/ and make his aby dyng in god / and with god / above al other virtues /
comfortes / and swetnesse: and all other likyng as I said before in the third
chapter The second fever of unstableness / is caused of cold / to the
which thing they put her heart unwisely. and love it more than need is Such
men ben dyuyded in hemselfe / Also such men. now feeble one way. now a another:
now they will be shryuen of one man / and tell all her life. and ask of him
counsel / a another day they chese a another. but it happeth full selde wheder
such done after counsel / of whom they ben blamyd / or for what thing they
show hemself full In^ocente and besie they ben to color their defaute Fair
words they show without. but the contrary is in heart. they desire her virtues
to be known / and for a few virtues / yet they would have worship / Other
men they will teache and blame hem for her defawtes. but they will not be taught
of other / ne take of other correcco^n An vnresonably enclinyn^g of the
flesshly kind. and a derke pride preuely hyd may be cause of such unstableness
/ In some men the fever quartein is caused of unstableness / that is to say when
a man is aliened / or wylfully gooth out fro god / from himself / fro all
sothfastnes. and fro al virtues / Such a man comyth lightly in to a byewaye /
and for many errors he slidethful folyly / so that he wot never where he is.
ne wheder he shall / what he has ne what he shall do. this sickness is more
perilous. than of the other which Ihaue rehercedOut of this quarteyn / that is
callid alienaco^n some men false in to a another fever that is cleped double
quartein / that is to say necligence / or slowthe / which is living without
charge of besines / then is the fourth day dowblid. and fro that day uneath he
shall get hele / by cause he is sloew and necligent in all maner^ things that
longs to every lastyng hele / Also by such slowthe and neclige^ce / he is
likly to fall in to sinful living. as man yt never had known god before. And
some men in this siknes hold falls opinions in her own conceytes / and
da^ynable before god / of which men I will declare you more openly. four
manner sects. that ye may be the more ware of hem. and of her opynyons.

And for asmoche as ye have seen here before what Infirmytees fallen to ghostly
lyuers. Wakyth and prays that ye false not in to temptacico^n vigilate / and
c^.

That some men by temptaco^n seken kyndly rest / and a falls ydlenes as for hye
perfecco^n. and by this error they fall in to other errors Caplm ix.
SOme there ben. or have be^ that seem full good / and perfect of living which
life is contraryous to all manner of virtues and specially I speak of hem at
this time which in hemselfe seek rest in kind. and wylfully seue the rest in
god And the louyngly enclinyng of the soul in god and to god ye which is
above kide. all they yt live without yt blestfull love which is above kind /
needs they ben inclined to hemself sekyng res te to some other thing / For
kyndely all creatures hen bowynge to have rest / and desire so / that rest is
sought in diverse manners / as well of good as of badde Upon this ye may
understand / that when a man stondeth nakid in soul without any Imagynacyons
/ or besynesses of kyndely wits / and all void and idle / no thing
yoccupyed with the ouyr wits of the soul / then by very kind he comyth in
to rest. This rest men may find by very kind in hemselfe / without werkyng
of grace / if they can void / and deliver hem from all maner^ Imagynacyons and
deeds and works / But in this voydau^ce and idleness. a good living soul
may have no rest. for good love and fervent charity. and thi^war de werki^g
and techyng of ye grace of god. will not suffer a man rest in this maner^
idleness / or voydau^ce Such an Inward liver / that is to say a ghostly
lover may not long endure in kindly rest with ease of heart / and hole of
conscience / But ferdermore it is good to knoew how kyndely rest may be / and
what exercise it has / In kyndely rest there is an Inward scylence that is to
say / peace and rest in the inward wits. and outward wits In a maner^
idleness / without thought / or Imagynacyon / without any maner^ exercise
outward or inward / so that rest in this wise may be hid / and not let
by no maner^ way / But rest in this maner^ is no thing lefull / For this
maner^ werkyng brings a man in such blindenes / that though he shall know and
into a maner^ of / bowyng dou^warde to himself. and in to himself wythouten
any deed or works This rest is not else but a maner^ ydlenes in himself. and
auoydaunce of in himself / forgetinge himself. god / and other thing / This
rest is contrarious to ye rest in god. For the Rest in god which is above
kind / is a louyngly beholding in to an hye clernes / that may not be
comprehended. this rest in god is sought always / and had with a contynuell
werkyng / and when it is had. it is soute nevertheless. butasmoche desires
above kyndli rest as god is hy^st above all creatures Therefore al they be^
foul deceived / the which behold or entende only to hemself. and they also
that bowe^ dou^warde in to kindly rest / Also that seek not god with contynuel
desire / or find not god with a laftyng love / set ever to god / and in god
by contynuell use without chau^gyng in will. For all other that seek or desire
kyndly rest / her ^este stondeth in a manner y^^e^es / To the which they ben
bowed down by kind by custom But in such kind rest god may not be found /
for this kyndly rest brings a man into such ydlenes se that Jews and
paynems they find and all other men / be they never so sinful so that they
live in sin without accusaco^n of conscience so that can void all thoughts
and Imagynaco^ns. In such an ydlenes kyndly rest is delectable. and such a
rest in his own proper being is no sin / For sometime it falls in you / in
me / and in all men. as when a man sto^deth or sits as he were astonyed. or
were in a thought / and in sothe ne he thinks ne ymagyneth rihtnought / For
he thinks not upon that thing that he lokyth upon / but yole he is and void
for the time fro al maner^ thoute and deed And this rest of his owne^ propertee
is no sin^e But wha^ a man besieth him / and in full will desires to have
such rest / without exercise of virtues bodily and ghostly inward and
outward / here is no doubt the rest is turned in to a great sin^e. for then^e
he fallith perillously in to a ghostly pride. that is to say in to a full
pleasau^ce of his own will for his most rest and ease / He weneth then yt
he is or that he has / that never he shall have or come to / Wha^ a man has
such rest by a falls ydlenes / and wha^ all other exercise that brings in
love. / is to him lettyng / then^e he dwellith and abides only upon himself /
and himself utterly voydeth fro al virtuous living This error is a foul
begyn^yng of all ghostly virtues. by cause of the pride and presu^pcyon Of this
ye may see an ensample wha^ angels were first made they had a free choys. so
some in ye first meuyng of the free will began to worship god by a great
fervor of love / and fulli turned to god with all that they had received of
god. ever to abide in bliss And ^i yt her will was conseruyd so to stand
evermore without any chau^gyng But those angels that anon rested on hemself.
and sought pleysa u^ce in her own light to follow her own will against the
kind of reason / her rest was full short by cause it was unskillful and also
unlawful / therefore they lackyd light. and in her own blyndenes slode and
fell in to everlasting derkenesse And for unreasonable desire of her own rest
/ they were put in to unrest ever more during / Thus have I showed you a great
error / yt some time falls among goostly men. Wakyth therefore and prays
that ye fall not in to temptaco^n Vigilate and orate ne intretis in
temptaco^nem /

That some men lyuen in great penance / and done many things outward / to be
holden holy. but they lyuen contraryously. to charity and live sinfully / for
they seek all the love of kind / and hold preuest many other opinyons / x.
THe second sect of contrarious living comes of therrou^s. which Ishewed
before in hem that seke^ and desire^ her own ease and rest by foul pride and
pre: su^pcyon. Of this pride comyth a spirituel or ghostli lecheri. for wha^ a
man will have rest in a maner^ ydlenes / without any desire or ^esi sekyng to
god. then he is full dyssposed to false in to all errors. by cause he is
turned away fro god. and turned to himself by a kindly love And by cause he
desires and sekyth all that is to pleysure and to lust and liking Such a man
is like to a marchaut. for in all his works he is ever enclinyng and bowyng by
entenco^n to his own rest / and to his own profit / but no thing for the
worship of god. This man that thus rests upon his own love to his proper
person / may well be callid a proprytayre / the which vice is da^pnable in all
obeysau^t chylderne / Nevertheless some of these childern live in great penance
/ and do many things outward / that her life may be known / and her name in
reputacyon among holy men. For each such love of kind is favorable to
himself / Also some of these men by a great singularytee desire of god some
specyalle theft abouen other / either of werkynge miracles / or vysions or of
reuelacions / or some other specyalte: wherefor often times they ben disceyued
by the devil / For sometime they have of the devil that they desiren Then^e
they wene it comyth to hem for her merit. and wene that it be sent fro god for
her holy living. Such men / ben both proud and blind. for hem lacken all
goostly light and felinge / And a full lityll thing may comfort such men /
for they know not what hem lac keth / This is cleped a spirituell lecherye.
for it is an unreasonable and a vnordynal will against reason. ever more boweng
down by the love of kind to his own prouffyte and all ease and rest / Such
men also ben proud and full sullen of will and to hard of heart / Thefore her
desire. and her foul couetyse retchyth some time / and spredeth so ferforthe.
that what they desire they. have / And some in her lives have been taken of the
fend / and long time traueylid with wicked spytes / and some unto the lives
end / Also these men that in this wise (...) / ^^ue contrariously to charity
and to the love of god: / with the why che a man offreth himself fulli /
inward and outward. in all yt he may in to the worship of god. For there may
no thing suffyse to a perfight lover / ne no thing may hi^ plese. sauf only
/ one goodness that may not be comprehended / the which goodness is god himself
/ for he is all chapyte / In goodness of charity is a bond of love / ye which
draeth us to god. In the which love we forsake ourself and therwyth we ben
vnied to god But the love of my nde dwellith upon himself. and ever is boweng
to his own prouffyte / Nevertheless the love of kind is as like to charity /
as to the werkyng outward / as two here is of an head / but the wills of the
meuynges be^ much discordyng and un like / For a good ma^nys heart is evermore
upward to god and his entencyon. and always desires the worship of god / But
in naturell love a ma^nys will loves to his own profit and ease / When the
love of kind passes thus ye love of god / and charity by contraryous will and
werkyng / then a man fallith into iiij peryllous sin^es / that is to say into
pride. auaryce / glotenye. and lecherye. thus fylle adam in paradys / and all
mankind with him / For the cause of the love that he had to himself by
turnyng fro the will of god / and by pride he did against godis commandment /
and by auaryce he coueyted knowe^g and wisdom / he sought by glotenye savor
and delight / and then after this he was steryd to lechery / But our blessid
lady fo^de the grace aye^. which ada^ had lost yt glorious ladi and mother of
love paf us ensample in living how we should love. this noble lady for the time
of the birth evermore turned her heart to god bo the actyf lif and ghostli. yt
it is to say with exercise of outward and ^war de virtues. by great desire and
fervent love to god received christ with al maner^ lownes and mekenes in this ye
blessid ladi fond grace against pride. Also she offrid up that worthi lord her
dear sone to the fader in heaven with her worldly possession and with al maner^
plente or largenes of heart in full affecco^n / yeldyng tha^kynges and worshyppes
to almyghti god. and in this she fond grace aye^ ste auaryce Also she rested
never upon comfort. ne gracious yeftes. which she plenteuously received of al
myty god / but al yt savor and swetnes she yaf holy to hi^ yt al goodness sent
/ and here she fo^de grace against glote: nigh / Also what clen^esse she had in
body and soul / it nedith not texpresse for all criste^ faith know well there
was never erthli creature yt had ye grace of so full clen^es as she had / in
which she fo^de grace against lecherye that grace that adam lost. that glorious
lady fond again / Who so then will overcome and wythstonde ye contrarious
living which I reherced before / must follow after his power our blessid lady
outward and Inward / in mekenes and largeness / in abstynence. and
clennesse. But for we ben feeble to stand / and by freylte dreadful to fall /
therefore as I said before / Wakith and prays that ye fall not in to

How some other men went they have fredom of spyrite. and that they ben united
to god wythouten any mean Wherefore they say that they ben not bound to no
laws of holy church. and that they ben dyscharged of all maner^ werkynges and
of all outward virtues / xj.
WHat time a man has in such Jolenesse kindly rest as I said before / and
oonly beholds himself / and stondeth stably upon his own propre will /
there whiles he may not be vnied togod by cause he lives in all contraryousnes
to have the love of god / for clean he is without charity / So after begyn^eth
the third contrari ous living / the which is wers tha^ any of ye two that I
have reherced For then he begins a life unrightful and unskillful / full
of goosth errors and al maner^ wretchidnes / What such men ben / and how ye
shall know hem / as by her opinions I will show you / Thise men in her own
sight ben full contem platyf / but in gods sight they be^ very fy^tifs
^eyners / by cause they have ronn away / and fled far fro god / And as they
ben fled from god so. so it is needful that all men flee away from hem /
as fro a ghostly enmye / Thise men wene ye they ben the holiest men that lyuen
Notwythsto^dyng they live co^traryously to all good men / For thy se bear her
opynions / they hold by ye kyndly rest which they have. and by that ydlenes /
the which they have when they stand so alone upon hemself / that they ben
free in spirit and united to god with any mean. Also that they ben enhau^ced
by perfecco^n above all the obscruau^ce of holy church / Above the heestes of
god. and above all gods law / and above all virtues works that any man may
have in exercise / hem thynken that her ydlenes and her kindly rest is so hie
of perfecco^n: and so great that they should not be let with no maner^
werkyng / In as much as that ydlenes / and that voydau^ce passes all virtues
/ Therefore they stand in a maner^ passion or suffreu^ce without werkynge /
nether upward ne dou^warde / but ever abide still as a deed stock. or an other
Instrumente that lies stylleyd^^ till the werker come and set it (...) work
/ For they think if they did any thing wylfully werkynge by her own werkynge
/ or besines / god should then^e be let of his own werkyng. Therefore they
make hem void of all maner^ virtues / In somoche that they will yield no
thankynges to god ne worshyppes* naught they will say / they will have no
knowing. no love. ne worship. ne desire to god / For hem thynken they have
that they might desire or pray / By this they say they ben poor of spyrite /
by cause they ben without will or desire / And that they have forsake all
things / and that they live without any choys or propertee / for to her sight
they stand all void / and as they say they be^ passed all that wherefore
exercise of virtues and obseruaunce in holy church is ordened / Also they say
that no man / ne god himself may make hem decreace and encreace / for they
be^ passed the traueyle of exercise as they say. and dyscharged of all virtues
/ Also they say that a man needs more to traueyle to be discharged of virtues.
than for to get he^ By all these opynions they will stand free. yeuing to

bishop / ne to the parysshe pressed. ne to none other man / not wythstondyng
that some of them show otherwise out ward / but inward / another in will ne in
deed they will be subget to no man. for they ben passed and dyscharged of all
maner^ ordenau^ce of holy church / Also upon this they say that as long as a
man besieth hi^ to gader virtues: he is not yet so perfight / but in her own
feeling they ben in perfeccyon above all saints and angels / and above all
mede that any men may deserve / therefore they trow that they may increase in
virtues. and that they may deserve no more mede and that there may deo no more
sin / in a smoche as to her own sight there live without will / and that
they had god her spirit / and that they ben noned to god / Therefore freely and
boldly hem thynkyth they may do what ye bodily kind desires. for they ben
come to In^ocence and subget to no law If her bodily kind be styred to any
lust or likyng so ferforth that the spirit that has not his freedom / ne
stondeth not in rest for the time. then they will fulfill the will of the
kind that her ydlenes ne rest of the spirit be not let Of fasting they
take no head / ne of festes of holy church / ne of the ordenau^ce / ne
obseruau^ce of holy church. sauf only for speech of men for in all things
they line without dome of conscience / Of these men whose living and opinyons.
I have rehearsed / I hope to god there ben but few / but sothe is is. there
have be^ such late in our days. and after have been turned and comen in to the
right way. But it is full hard or they be turned. for some ben hard of heart
/ that they will not be turned / And then by suffrau^ce ce of god: the devil
has power of hem / and by this power and techyng they wexe so wyser so
subtle yt they may not be overcome with no reason / and so they ben dysceyued
but grace be gotten by other men^is prayers:

How some of such men holden that to what every thing they ben styred /
whether it acorde to crystes living and techynge or not. All comyth of the holy
ghost / xij.
OTher men there ben of contrarious living / and ypocrites in kind which will
ben called gods pacyentes / these men holden the same obseruau^ce ye thise
other me^ done / which I rehearsed before / for they keep hem from al werkyng /
and stand all idle as a Instrument of god in maner^ abydyng and suffrau^ce till
god will work in hem / But somewhat they ben contrarions to tho before. in
asmoche as they say that all the works which god werkith by hem be m^r^noble
and medeful. than any other men may deserve. They say also yt they ben gods
pacyentes. by cause they suffer all thing that god will werk in hem And thouh
they stand void and idle fro all werkynge / yet they will therwyth stand
void fro al maner^ rewards and great merytes. What ever they done it may be
no sin^e / for what ever god will that is wrought in he^ / and not else /
Thise men have al forsaken hemself inward / and live as hem thi^ken in

so hard of heart / and stand so strong on her own opynio^s / that will
rather chese the death / than leave and for sake any point or article which they

Some of hem say the contrary / that for her living they deserve more mede tha^

foul deceued of the devil / for every man that has understanding or knowing
of holy writ: or feling in doctrine of ho^^ church wot well they err foul

they ben messagers of antcryste / by cause of her untruth / they wene they
ben co^templatyf and holier than any other / and yet they will prefer in
obedyence and other vices before al other works and virtue / The werst thing
that is they will color it and make it fair / and in all thing they be^
contrarious to god / to saints / and to al perfecco^n / and yet they make hem

I Read that Almighty god in two mauers wounds his childern. which he will
bring again to hele: Sometime he smyteth the body and the flesh / and softneth
the hardness of ye soul by dread thus then god callith again by health whom he
chastyseth outward* his chosen chyldern / for they should have hele inward
Therefore says our lord by the prophet / I shall slece / and I shall make to
live. I shall smite: and I shall hele / Our good lord ^leeth / for he will make
to live, he smyteth. that he may hele / he beteth outward. that he may hele
inward. the wou^des of trespace / and thus he smyteth ye flesh / and makes
it tender the hardness of the soul / Also in a another maner^ god wou^deth his
chosen chyldern / when he wou^deth y^ soul inward / and ^^aceth of his betyng
outward / for then he smyteth the hardness of our heart with his desire / But
wha^ he smyteth / he heleth. for he callith us again to the feling of his
rightwysnesse as when we ben forfestned with a dart of his ferdnes. Our hertes
ben full evil helid when they ben not wounded with no love of god When they
feel not the harms and the perils of our begyn^yng. wha^ they langour not by
way of compassion. ne by none affecco^ns / ne for Infirmyte / or disease of our
neighbor. Also sometime our lord wounds our hertes / for they should be hole
/ when he smyteth our souls which have no feling / Sometime with sharp darts
of his love / and anon he makyth there a ghostly feling by the hete of charity
/ Thus then ye have herd hew our lord wou^deth outward and inward his
chosen chyldern to make hem hole. Afterward then skylfully may we say as Job
said / Blessid is ye man that is under evermore ^hastysed of our lord. Two
virtues be^ in this vndernemyng. one is to make him flee sin^e / yt he do it
not Or else to amend those that bendone. and that is the second virtue of
his chastysing / But oftyme it happeth yt we flee not alonely blames and
pery^les that we know / and see / But some time we wot not ne know not how ne
when we offend* and thus wexeth our soul blind / and is full of derknes. in
asmoche as it understands not the harm and the peril of h^^ blindness /
Therefore some time of the largnesse of the yefte of god. pain follows the
trespace / and sharp s^orges and chastysing to open the eyes of ye
trespassours / whoos eyes among vices were made blind with sikernesse / A
slow will is towched with a stroke of our lord to awake him / and make him
quycke / that he may see where he lies by strokes and tourmentes, which by
syckernes he had lost the hye way of rightwysnes / Thus is the sharpenes of
vndernemyng and chastising begyn^yng of clear light to the soul. therefore
says the wise man / He ling shall make the sins to sease Also we read that
our lord castyseth whom he loves. He soorgeth each a child that he
receives. Also our lord says to saint John. I vnderneme and chastyse hem /
that I love Thus chastysing is spedeful and needful to a mannys soul for Joy
that is to come / all though the soul and the bliss may not come together.
Yet skylfully may be said before Blessid is that m^^ that is vnderneme of our
lord / T^^se words which I have said before ben the words of saint
gregorye: To this purpose of chastysing of goddis chyldern accords an other
^^ly clerk / Ysodorus / and says God spares not the sinful man that
trespaceth / for either he chasty seth him to pourge him with his rod. or
else he leuyth him by his preuy dome to be punysshyd euerlastyngly / Or else
a man punyssheth himself with penance for his misdeeds by his own devotion /
or by auctoryte of holy church / And for that some time god withdraws his
rods and spares him by his mercy / The mercy of god is full reasonable and
gracyous. that first amendeth a man and pourgeth him here by sharp chastising
and delivers him afterward fro everlasting tourment / A goddis child chosen
of god is all to hurlid with sorrow and pains of this life / that he may
win perfyghte Joy. and everlasting life / Such chastysinges in this world
brings a ryhtfull man to bliss without end. Therefore a rightful man should
be glad here in pains and a wicked man may sore dread in prosperyte^* Our
lord wythdraweth not his mercy / ne his rightwisnes fro a rightful man / ne
fro a reasonable man / For he demyth good men by tourment / and disease / and
rewards hem in his bliss by his mercy / But here he rewards wicked men by
a temporell case and prouffyte by his goodness / and punyssheth hem / and demyth
hem after her death by his ever lastyng rightwysnes / so that in this life
our lord spares not his louid chylderne. This chastysing that I speak of /
is not oonly of bodily diseases / but also of ghoostly dyseases / For it is
full needful some time a good man or woman to be tempted with vices* and be
b^ten^wyth a goostly rod: That while he is assailed with vices he shall not
be proud of virtues. Also while he is hurlyd with pains of the soul / or of
the body / he shall wyth^raew his her^e fro the love of the world / Such
prouffyte and much more than I may sheweyow comyth to the soul by assaylinge
of temptacyon. But now I will tell five pryncypalle causes why temptaco^ns or
trylulacyons ben sent to men / and what is the cause of such chastysinge The
first cause is that a man or woman be not proud of his ghos^ly gifts /
which god by specyalle grace has given him / Therefore a wicked angel was
sent to saint poule* to tourment him with temptacyons. that be should not be
to high. for the reuelacyons which he had / The second cause may be for to
make him clenner to increase his mede. Thus was Io^ and thobye / and many other
trowblid in this world. The third cause may be / for god should be the more
worshypped and glorified in his works / As it befelle by the child that was
borne blind* Of whom our lord said / that he was not blind for his sin^e /
ne for his fader. ne mother / but that ye works of god should be showed in him
The fourth cause may be for chastisinge and purging him of for his sins. as
mary the suster of moses was chastysed / Also the chylderne of Israhel / and
other men and wymen. which god all day chastyseth with bodily siknesses / and
other trybulacyons / both bodily and goostly. The fyfthe cause has fallen to
some men. for everlasting pain that they should suffer after her death thus was
herodes punysshyd. and they of Sodom. Dathan / and Abyron / and such other /
Thise ben five pryncypalle causes of trybulacyons and temptacyons / But many
other skylles there ben. why some be^ more traueyled with temptaco^ns And one
notable skylle is for they s^^lde the better counseyle and comfort other in
matters of ghostly diseases / the which they have asayed and know by
experyence. Therefore says an holy clerk Ysodorus* It is needful to ryghtfull
men and holy men be towchyd with aduers^tre / to preue their pacyence / which
shows prouffytably ensamples in prosperyte / may have them in formacyon of
the virtue of strength in temptacyons and other aduersitee / Also some there
have been that after long stryffe against certain temptacyons / Suddenly they
have fallen by the suffrau^ce of god For they should be more lowly and pooer in
spirit afterward / And the cause of her falling. has been* For they thought
not lowely in their soul no dread / not / mekely their own Infirmytee. by
her own strength / or else by bodily / or goostly werkynges / For such
presumpcyon. our lord has suffryd both men and wymmen of hye living. fall
in some sin which wenyd never to fall in / These words I trow shall
suffyse to you / what prouffyte is in the chastysinge of gods chylderne / and
what is the cause of such chastysinge / Now ferdermore. I will write openly of
temptacyons / of the which I towchyd before. and showed you remedies against
hem in special / and in generalle. And first I will begin at the temptacyon
of dyspeyre / But yet thouh temptacyons and such chastysinges ben prouffytable
/ as I said before. Wakyth and prays yt ye fall not in to temptacion:

Vigilate / and orate ne intretis in temptacionem.

Of the temptacyons of dyspeyre / and of remedies against such temptacyons /
Caplm / xiiij.
A Man that is sori for a thing that is lost. the gladder he is when it is
found again / Of this our lord puts an emsample in the gospel by a sheep
herd how gladly and with how great myrthe and Joye he bears some again his
sheep that first was lost* and after found again / By this ensample and
figure. no man shall have mystrust of foryeuenesse of what someuer sin man
has done. And though saint aus* tyn and some other doctors speak hard of
them / that evermore lie in sin. all the days of their life Yet says an
holy clerk Ysodorus that a man should never mystruste though he be not turned
in to the last end / so that by the lest time of repentance he shall be
received in to mercy. Therefore says the same clerk / In each mannys living
we should take heed of the end. for our lord lokyth not oonly how we have
lived before in our life / But rather he takyth head what we ben in the ending
of the life To this accords saint Johan Crysostom / and says the goodness of
god. that is without mesure so gracyous has ordained for us / that he would
not mesure our of to urnyng another long ne short. For in the leest moment of
an hour: if we turn to him / he takyth us in to grace / The pety of god is
so great / that he dyspiseth never penance / where it is offered by in to him
clearly and with a simple and meke herd / For if a man have be never so evil.
and he be in will to turn fro vices to virtues / our lord gladly takyth him
/ and beclippeth him / and by his mercy refourmeth him again to his first
astate / It nedyth not to write much of this matrre: and also I trow ye
desire not as for yourselfe / for well ye wot that the mercy of god is above
all his works / But now as for remedy again for this temptacyon / First ye
shall understand that dyspeyre comyth of three things / that is to say / of
the gretnesse of sin. of the nombre of sin^es / and of the contynuaunce / and
long abiding in sin / Again thyes matters of dyspeyre: there ben three
manners of remedies / As for the gretnesse or quanty tree of sin / it is a good
remedy to think on the passion of Ihesu christ / which passion was strenger
to unbind than any snnne may bind. As for the multitude or nombre of sins
/ it is good to think on the techynge of christ / which byddeth us not oonly
for these fewes sythes / but seventy times seven sythes / As for the long
contynuaunce or custom of in sin. It is good to think / on the words of
our lord where he says / A man that tourneth from al his wyckidnesse that he
has done. he shall live / and he shall not deye / Of these things ven
auctorytes / many both of holy writ / and of doctors Other three remedies
there ben in dyspeyre of perseueraunce / For sum as I said before ben so
sore traueyled against their will / that they dread to false / against such
mystrust / there ben three remedies. The first is to comfort him to think
that the fend is so feeble of himself. that he has no power to overcome any
mannys soul but if a man will himself. That the fend has no power / I
shall show after.

The second remedy is that a man shall think on his own strength / that he
has by the yef te of god. This strength is conceyuyd of Joye / of libertee /
of armor and of felishyp / It is a great Joye to man when he thinks how
he is dyscharged of the heavy burden of sin by the sacrament of confession and
penance and this joy is to him a great stceingth against the devil / Also it
is a great fredom and libertee when a man is deliuerde of the seruage of the
devil / and made free to god by ye sacrament of confession and penance / this
libertee is a great strength against the fend / Also he that had none armor
while he lay in sin now he is armed with gods armor / by crystis passion /
and this armor is a great strength against the devil. Also he that was first
alone. while he lay in sin by his conversion and dooyng of penance (...) is
assoylled / to the company of all rightful men / this felishyp also (...)
agrete strength against the devil The third remedy is for to think
steadfastly. how our lord lightneth us. and defends us / as the prophet said
/ Our lord is my light and my health. whom shall I dread

Thise ben remedies for hem that been traueyled with the temptaco^n of dyspeyre
/ to be saved / And remedies for hem that hen in dyspryre of perseuerau^ce
after time they ben turned / But now prrauenture some man will say / I wot
well. that goddis mercy is above al his were kes / but how shall I know that I
am able to receive his mercy / To this me thinks each man may see and feel /
that he shell think himself able to receive merci / if he will ask it. As
thus / If ye were brought by temptaco^n in so great perplexyte that ye were in
dreadful doubt / how it should stand with you then ye might think and
ask your ownself in your soul. wheder ye would forgive any man his trespace.
which greuosly had offended you. if he asked you lowly mercy / and proferyd
you with all his heart to make you amends to this your reason would say / and
graunce that needs ye would forgive it him and take him in to your mercy

^e should think then or ask yourself of whom have ye this will and this
mercyful heart nedis ye must say. that ye have it of god. Thesie may ye
conclude thus by reyson and think that god has put in me and yeuen me such a
will and virtue and he gives no thing. but that he has himself / Then
must it needs follow / that if I ask him mercy / he will take me in to merci
This may be a remedy to comfort a man if he will thus think. Thus then by
auctorytes es. and by scryptures. and some what by reason / ye may see and
feel how merciful our lord is. What strength also a man has again the fend
/ and how our enmie is holden down by strength of holy church / therefore there
should no man be in dyspeyre / but in each dread and doubt: evermore a man
should cast his heart to god with a sad trust / as the prophet says / Cast
thy thought in god / and he shall nourysshe the Also for a nedful and a
general remedy in this te^ptaco^n specyalli and such other peryllous and
dredfulle temptaco^ns / it is good to show to a manis confessor / or eles to
one or to other ghostly livers. and ask often counseyle / and to meke him to
other men^is prayers / For there falls man ne woman in myscheif / but such
as gooth fro the / and will not show her heart to no man / and so they ben
accombred for else they should not false in to te^ptaco^n: Therefore it is good
to ask cou^serle in each need. and besily to pray for grace For he yt stondeth

Of predestinacion and prescience of god / and of hem that been traueylled with
such maner^ matters / xv.
I Said also in the sixth chapter that some be n sore traueyled in Imagynacyons
and thoughts of predestynacyon / and of the prescye^ce of god / of the which
matere Idrede for to write for thise terms have other sentence in latin. than
I can show in englisshe / Nevertheless sowhat I will show you shortly.
Predestinaco^n comes euermor^ to god / Prescye^ce of god may be understand to
evil / And in this te^ptaco^n / a man is tempted with both / For in
predestynaco^n he doubts whether god has ordained him to be saved / And in
the ymaginaco^n of yt prescience of god he doubts to be dampened. Predesty
naco^n is begone by the ordenaunce of god and it is helped by the pray er of
saints / and it is e^ded by a ma^nys own werkyng. First I say it is begone of
god. Thereof witnesses thappostle poul / and says thus Our lord has forse^t
or made his predestynacyon / before the beginning of the world / But yet this
predestynacyon / puts not ne concludes not a needful good werkyng in him
to him / that shol de be sauyd. Ne his prescience that is to say in englisshe
/ his forknowyng puts not a needful evil werkynge. to them that shall be
dampened / For god has given a man a free will. both for to will to do. and
to perform that will in deed. As thus when a man gooeth in to the feldes
while he gooth. needs he must goo there / and yet he gooth of his own free
will / Therefore says they postle poule. God has wroughte in you a will / and
to perform for the a good will. does therefore / all thing without grutching /
and doubts that ye may be without peril and that ye be simple gods chylder
/ By the which words we ben taught evermore to co^tynue in good werkyng. and
not work for a time / in a venture / that if we leave our good werkyng by our
folly we ben acompted by the prescyence of god among hem. that shall be put out
of the book of life. For if we live in good works and continue then by the
ordinance of god / we shall be acompted among the chyldern / of ye which poul
spekyth the Our lord has callid hem ye which he ordained by predestynaco^n.
and he has made rihtful hem ye he has callid / and he has magnefyed hem in
everlasting lif which he made riht full: Thus then is predestynaco^n begone of
thordenau^ce of god. I said also that prrdestynaco^n is helpen by prayers of
saints and of holy men / Of this I read that those thiges yt holy men done /
or whereof they have grace in werkyng to other. they be so ordained before by
predestynaco^n / that they have al such werkinges through her prayers to this
acorde saint austyn where he spekith of the fourth man yt god should have raised
fro death to life / of the which man. god said to one of his discyples / Suffer
ye deed men bery deed me^ / follow ye me Upon thise words saint austyn says.
that our lord raised iij. deed men fro death by prayer of other And he herd
by showing of one of his dyscyples / that there was the fourth deed man / But
for there were none there / yt should pray for him he was not raised to the lif
/ So thus by prayer of other men predestinaco^n is helped / Also
predestinaco^n is pended by a manis own werkyng To this acordeth saint peul
where he said that we be the helpers of the werking of god for predestinaco^n
of god / is fulfyllid by ye prayer of saints. and by a manis deseruyng. And
for asmoche as we be not knowing which ben ordened of god / that should be in
the book of life. For the which it is needful that we do always well and
beseli work with ye grace that has sen de us for then may we trust se /
kerly / that he has ordened us to be of the nombrr of his chosen childerne /
An holy clerk Bonauenture puts a remedy to this te^p tacyon / which
accords to these words before said. as ye shall see / If ye be traueyled
with any thought of the predestynacyon / or of any prescience of god. then
may ye answer to the devil. yt he puts in you that suggestyon and say with
the heart. and with the tongue in open speech to his confusion. For he knows
not our thoughts but by outward tokenes. And when he knows that he is
despised / and set at naught. he leueth his pursuit for shame of his confusion
Therefore who ever be tempted with this temptacyon shall speak to him thise
maner^ words. How ever it be of me soth it is. that thou art dampened and
though it be so the. by the prescience of god / that I shall not have my lord
god after this life. yet I will traueyle with all my strength. that I may have
him as much as I may. and that I fall not. ne lack not. so much goodness.
both in this life. and after this life / If I shall have but wretchydnes after
this life / I will not leave. ne lose the lityll time yt I shall have here. but
after my power. I will set my Joye and all my delight in my lord god / A
great wodnes it were if I should be turme^ted with everlasting pain to take me
now in to mine enmyes hondes. and so for the to be with him ever more / there
for^ I will give me holy to my god that ordeyneth for me his predestynaco^n.
that there shall be no thing inme. to my poor heart. ne tongue. ne no member
/ but all shall be ocupyed in my lords seruyse / how ever my lord god has
knowing what shall fall of me. I wot well he may not forsak himself. therefore
hi^ I will beclippe with all my inward wits. and fast I will hold hi^ that
he shall not leave me. but if he give me his blessing Also I shall hyde me in
deep holes of his wounds. and there I will ust me for ^ut of tho he shall not
fi^de me: he will not compelse me to goo out for he says himself. I shall not
cast hi^ out that comyth to me / and thus he shall not da^pne me. but if he
will do again his own dome / I will also fall down to his moders fete and
say to her lowly / that for synful men she was made his mother. and her will I
pray that she ask for me foryeuenes / That lady may not put me away for all
men say and of her done write that she is well of pity / Therefore of great
compassion she shall low her sone to mercy: So that in this I shall have
treble help and refute. for if my lord has ordained me by predestynacyon to
be one of his chyldern in bliss fro this time forward. I wylse live more
like. an angels lif than a ma^s lif / To him I yeye me holyly that has give
himself to me. of his yefte I hold me apayde. frohens forward I desire no more
but him therefore what ever shall be done of me / I will not fail / ne leave the
seruyse of my lord / But woo is to the and evermore shall be / for you may ste
not do him service / ne never shall thou Joye in his blestful presence / Thus
with be^ines and virtuous living / and devout prayer shall ye wythstonth and
ouercom^ this te^ptacyon: And traueyling of the Jmaginyng and thynkyng of the
predestinaco^n / and prescyence of god* Wakith therefore and prays yt ye fal^e
not in to temptacion /

Of wyckid spirytes and her power that they have by suffraunce of god. and how
grievous they were in old time to our holy faders / Caplm xvj
A Great dyfference there is between prynes. that a rihtful man suffers bodily
outward and temptacions which a goostly man suffers inward / And all though
a spirit be ever besie to traueyle and disease good men: Yet might neither
power has he none / but what he has by the suffraunce of god. Therefore saint
gregory says in his morallis. that the will of the devil is always wicked /
but his power is never unrightful / for a will he has of himself. but power
he has of our lord. what ever he purposes or desire to pr(...) by mali^^ god
suffers not but that it be rightful. Therefore we read in the book of kings
thus the wick^d spirit of our lord styrte in to the saul / that is to say
the spirit of our lord that is to believe of a rightful power / and the wyckid
spyrite / by the desire of an unrightful will / styrte in to Saul. Then^e
should we not dread him / that naught may do / but by suffrau^ce / When any
disease falls to goddis childern. it is tempered by times by a wonderful
grace of god / Therefore says saint poul / It is a good true god which shall
not su^^re you be tempted ou^t your power and might of wythstondyng / but he
shall do some prouffyte with that temptacyon. that ye shall mow suffer it
Therefore says the prophet in the psalm / Preue me lord and tempte me. that
is to say openly / Lord first behold my strength / and then suffer me as I
may bear. Thus then we have yt the wicked spirit has no power: but by leave
and suffraunce of god What prouffyte is it to the soul in suffrynge of
temptacyons / I will show after / Therefore I goo to my purpoos to show you as
I said before what power the wyckid spirytes have in man by suffrau^ce of god /
To afferme the words of saint Gregorye of the power of wicked spyrites. the
story of Job shows openly. where y^ send durst no more tempte him / than was
granted him by the leave of god. Also the con^usion of ye same wicked spirytes*
by rightwisnes: that they have no power of hemself / by that. they said to
christ in the gospel if thou cast us out / se^de us in to a ^^rde of hogs /
Much more than we should trow. that there have no might at her will to enter
in to a man / which is made and fourmed after the soul to the image of god
when they had no power without suffrau^ce of god to enter in to the dombe and
soul unclean bestes / Also if they had libertee and power to noye man at her
own will / then should not men* have dwellid stably in wilderness by
hemselfe / as our faders did by old time.

Also to show / that all power both of man / and of spyrites / comyth oonly
of god. We have an open ensample by the words of criste / when he said to
Mylate / thou sholdest have no power in me. but if it had be given the from
above / But as of power of evil spyrytes / I (...) in the ^ollacyons of our
holy faders / that in their time the fendes had not so great st^^yngthe as they
had before time* in the beginning of Ankers / and of other solitary men in
wyldernes when there was but lityll any congregaco^n of monks / In that old
time the wicked spyrites were so feers / that uneath there were any that might
abide in solitarye living / though they were never so stable. Where any
congregacy on that time was of monks. of eight. or ten together / the malice of
the wydkyd spirytes was so great in the coming of hem / so open to sight
outward / that the monks durst not on nyghtes sleep together but while some
took rest / some woke in prayers and redyng And wha^ need drew hem to slombryng
/ or sleep / they awoke her felawes to keep hem while they slepte / But such
saw^es / and ferdnes of evil spyrytes was much assuaged in the tyme^ of thise
holy faders / that came afterward / For yet that time and much more now.
there was so much feebleness of spirit / and unlust. and unstableness in many
men. that needful it was with all softnes to tr^ ten hem. and make hem abide
styl^t* Therefore they would say to hem / yt were young and tender of heart. and
feeble in spyrite / Sytteth in your celles / and asmoche as ^elustith yeteth.
and drinkyth / and slepeth. so that ye abide stil^e. and perform that ye ben
comen* ^ore* But to speak of the evil spirytes. what power they have to entree
in to men / Sooth it is they may tarry a man with thoughts / though he be never
so holy / but entree may they not / with full power to traueylle a man in
soul. till they find a man void of the dread. and mind of god /. and nakyd
from all ghostly medytaco^ns and affecco^ns / Where they find a man so clean
/ unarmed fro all ghostly armoure / there sometime they enter by the suffrau^ce
of god / to vex hi^ and traueyle sore with ghostly temptacyons* and sometime
with bodeli Infyrmytees. But yet bodeli vexaco^n or bodily Infirmytees is not
most to be dradde / for often times the wicked spirytes tormeten the body and
does naught to the soul / but god suffers. and has suffered that to holy men
for punysshyng and chastysing / as ye shall here after / At this time I speak
no more of ye power of wicked spirytes / For now ferdermore I will show you by
ensample. how they have used. and may use her power by the suffrau^ce of god
But since. ye see. that her power is rightful / as I said before / by cause it
comyth of god. Bewaar therefore / and wakyth and prays / that ye fall not in
to temptaco^n.

Vigilate and orate / and c^.

Of special ensamplis how holy men in old time for light defawtes to our
sight. were chastysed suddenly with bodily Infyrmytees / and sometime grievously
traueiled with yllusions and wicked spirits / And what ^emedye longs to hem
that been traueiled with wicked spirits or fulli assented to her yllusions /
Caplm xvij
^Vll h^ly men for light defawtes have been take bodily to the wicked spirytes
/ for they should be traueilid with great siknes / that no spotte of sin
should be seen in her day of dome but that they sholden be clean purged (...)
come streyghte to bliss as we read God flamyth whom he louyth and chastyseth
each a child that he receives Also we find well that fire preuyth gold and
silver but man is preuid by mekenes in chastisinge / Of this we have ensample
of a prophet. which for a defawte yt he did / not wylfully. ne of malice but
by sterynge of a another: Yet he was all to drawn of a lion In which
chastysinge god showed openly his trespace / for though he was betake to the
power of the beast / and slain by that lion Yet the lion after his death* had
no power to towche his body*

Other ensamples we have of our holy faders: One is of an a^^^t powle when he
went with an other monk to vysite a solitary* man / as they went by hap /
soden ly they met a woman / and anon^ poule thabbot turned. and fled with a
great speed home to his mynstre / and for cry ne for prayer of tholde monk /
he would not a bide / and not withstondyng he did it of virtue yet be exceded
thobseruau^ce of his rule / therefore he was smyten with such a palsy / that
he had no member of his body in case and in in rest. hondes ne* fete. eyes /
ne tongue / ne e res at his will: but all had lost her strength. And after it
happed yt no keeping might suffyse him but keeping of wymen / which lasted
thabbot iiij. years to his lives end / And yet in all his feebleness there was
such grace in him by* virtue of holiness. that what man was anointed with oil
that tou chyd his body / he received hele of al maner^ siknes Thus was that
holy man chastysed for a lityll trespace done again the obseruaunce of his
rule / Also the abbotte secun dus. an holy man / and of hye perfeccyon / which
dwellid in wilderness This man by cause of an opinion / that he held styfli by
sharp words. in dysputacyon against the holy man Macharium / anon he was so
fervently taken with the wicked spyrite / that he deliuerde at his mouth kyndly
def^enge of mete and drink / This chastysing he had by grace. for purging of
the soul that no thing should abide vnclensed But anon as Machary^ prayed
for him / ye wicked spirit fled away / By thise ensamples* and many such
that we read of / and have read of / we s^^lde not despise hem that be^
traueyled with strong temptacyons. another hem that been wexed with wicked
spyrytes / For two things we should steadfastly hope / The first is that no
man is tempted but by the suffraunce of god / The s^n^onde is that what so
ever god sends us whether it seem sorrowful or Joye full. it is yeuen us /
and send us / fro our loving fader. and fro our soue ^^yne leche* and for our
great prouf fyte / that when we pass fro this world. either we shall goo to
bliss clean purged. or else suffer the less pain in purgatory.

Also we should not dyspise hem ne loathe hem yt ben traueyled with wicked
spyrytes. ne deem of hem that been out of her mind / as we see all day both
men and wymen. come by feb^enes of brain. come by disposico^n of kind / come
by diverse Infyrmytres / and some by wykyd spiri^^s we should not deem none of
these / For though the body of man be tormented by Infyrmyte. and traueyled
with foul doings or countenance. or with ^oule speech outward he may stand
full well in soul / For the soul of him that is so traueyled / often times goes
euin streyt to bliss* for he is Innocent of that / that the devil spekyth or
werkyth in him. Of this we may see full often ensamples / both of men and of
wymen. as clean of lif as any child / and perfyght in living / how in sickness
before her end. and in her endyng / they have spoken of fylth and foul sin.
that never they knew and in all contynuau^ce and werkynges and speech, fared
also foul / as thouh all her life / they had been wyckid livers / and for all
these torments / yet it is no doubt the soul was more blistful. Therefore to
such me^ and wymen that been traueyled with wicked spyrites / it is fpedefull
to have prayers of holy church / As our holy faders in old time said / and
so say some yet* that in some vex aco^ns / for a special remedy they might
receive the sacraments of holy church / so that it might be duly and
honestly done. as what time they have reason and devotion for so were our holy
faders deliuerde in old time: For the ferder the fend sees a man departed
from ghostly medicynes / the harder he tempts him / and traueylith him.

But here ye must take heed / and vnderstone: that some men be^ traueyled of
gods suffraunce / by the wicked spyrite / with bodily siknesnes / as with the
palsy dropesie or other sickness. as Job was. but evermore by grace they had
their wits and reyson with hem. Also some ben styred or pryckid. some ben
traueyled and toowbled with some temptacyons against her will. without any
assenting / as with dys^ey^e or obstynace. or else with a spyrite of
blaspfemye. or with doubt of predestynacio^ / or with dread of pre destynaco^n.
or with dread of ye prescyence of god / what shall fall of him / or with
doubts of dredes. yt needs not to reherce in special.

All such temptacyons ben full needful to men and wymen / and speed* full to
purge the soul / and to keep ^e^ in virtues and for many other causes as I
showed before. in the ^welfthe chapitre Remedy to such is often confession.
and besy prayer and receyuyng of the sacrament. with other comfortes / as I
wrote before a. yenst the temptaco^ns of dyspeyre / and of such other dredful
temptacyons / Other men and wymen that have been. that for defawte of counsel
for asmoche as they would ask no counsel in such dreadful temptacions: or
el^es for long contynuau^ce in great and horrible sin^e without repentance
were acombred and trau^ilid contynuelly with the wicked spirit. whereby they
assented by semyng outward to the temptacio^s and fell in to dyspeyre. wenynge
yt her sy^e was more than the mercy of the goodness of god / In the same maner^
some have fallen in to obstynacy / which men have be^ so hard of heart. yt of
malice they will not be repentau^te / or else that they said / or thought
that they would do penance / but not yet. and some have been that would not
ask forgyuenes. ne do no penance. but it has stand full hard with such.
Nevertheless we should yet pray for hem. how ever they dey in pryue prayers /
with a condyco^n as if they ^e^ in way of saluaco^n. or if it plese god. But if
we knew a certain yt such men deyed without repentance / then should we not
pray for he^ But that / we may not know / for in the leest moment they may ask
mercy in heart / and taken to mercy / Also some have fallen into blasphemy
which be^ they that speke^ unhonestly of god / or else thought the same
pryuely in her hertes. In all these and such other temptaco^ns like to these /
some men and wymen have be^ traueyled. and overcome to our sight outward / by
special suffrau^ce in the pryue dome of god / To al such men / whose inward
wits be^ bl^ de. and so stopped for the time. other menns prayers and wymens
be^ nedeful / Also fasting and other bodily afflicco^ns of her friends. and
specially of her confessors: and of other holy men in charity / Also to lead
hem to holy relics and to saints yt ben shryned Also comynyng of good men
and wymen with hem. and (...) ging of holy water / Also such me dycynes may be
spedefull. and remedy able by grace of god to such / that been comynly ocupyed
and ^r^ueyled with wicked spyrites. Thus I have showed shortly how wicked
spyrites have used or may use her power by suffrau^ce of god / Much more I
might write you of this matere. which needs you not to know / This that I
have written I(...) it be nedeful to you ^oknow both for your own prouffyte.
and co^ forte of other / But here may ye see by ye chastysing of our holy
faders and other h^ly men / that needs we must dread our lord / which
rightfully chastyseth and beteth his chyldern. Wakith therefore and prays that
ye fall not in to temptacion /

Vigilate and orate / and c^.

That many men and wymen b^ dysceyued by many ^euelacyons* vysions: and that
there ben three pryncypall kinds of vysions / Capitulum xviij.
Among other temptacions which I showed before In general: And in special I
said that some men and wymen were often disceyued with vysions and ^euelacyons /
Thereto I will first show you here which ben the kinds of vysions / and
after how ye shall know hem. when they come of a good angel and when not /
After the writing and opynyons of doctors / there ben three pri^cypall kinds
of vysions / The first is called a corporal vision with bodily eyes / when any
bodily thing by the gift of god is showed to a mannys bodily sight / which
other men see not / ne may not see As Heliseus saw brennyng chares / as they
had been al a fire. wha^ Helias was taken up in to thayre Also Balthazar the
king saw an hand writing in the wall Mane techell phares / The second kind
of vysion. is callid a spyrytuell vysion or Imagynatyf. wha^ a man is in his
sleep / or when a man is rauisshed fully in spirit in time of prayer / or in
other time / Sees images and fygures of diverse things. but no bodies be
showing* of ^euelacyon of god As saint Johan the evangelist / when he was
rauysshyd in spyryte saw many figures and images. As we read in the apocalipce

Also saint peter saw in such a Rauysshynge a dysshe full of diverse bestes /
And herd a voys say to him / Sle^ and ete /

The third pryncypal kind of vysions / is called an Intellectuel vision /
when no body / ne image. not figure is seen. But when in such a Rauysshynge
/ the Insighte of the soul / by a wonderful might of go^ / is clearly
fastnyd in vnbodely substance / with a soothfaste knowing* To this vysion
saint Poule was Rauysshyd as do tours sayen / That he saw without any
figure. or image god in himself That is to say in the god hode / This third
kind of vysio^s is more excellent* and more worthy thanne corporal. or
spyrytuel or any other Thise then ben three pryncypall kinds of vysions

The first is called corporal. by cause it is seen outward. by bodily eye
wit(...) The second is spyrituall. for each thing that is no body if it be
substancyall it is callid a spirit / The third is Intellectuell by cause of
Inward understanding / and knowing of ye soul. with out any body or image.
or figure Balthazar in the first vysion saw an hand writing as I said before
Anon as he saw it an image of such bodeli thing. was Impressid to his spirit
/ and when the vysion was done and passed away. it abode stylle / that image
in his thought And all this was but ymagyna cyon of that corporal vysio^ he
saw well in spyryte by ymagynacyon all that he saw before bodily / but another
in time of the vysions. ne after in his ymagynaco^n he had no knowing what it
betokened. tylle Danyel came and told him by a spyrite of prophecy In the
second vysion saint peter saw a dyshful of of beestes. as I said before / not
slepyng / but in rauysshi^g. which rauysshyng. after the saying of saint
austyn / may properly be callid a swownyng. as wha^ / the beholdi^ge of the
soul / or the intent of the inward will is fulli turned away fro the bodily
wits / then it may skylfully be callid a rauysshi^ge / or a swowning. For
what ever bodily thing be then presented. it is not see^ with the bodily eye
/ ne voice herd with the ere / for then all the beholding of the soul.
either it is in images / fygures / and ghoostly sight / or else in things
vnbodely without any image / by a sothfast knowing. by the wonderful might of
god. as it is in a vision Intellectuel / as I said before After this vision of
saint peter whanhe had gadred again to him his bodily wits / the same yt he
had before in spirit / he saw after in ye same spirit by thought and
ymagynaco^n. and also those things yt he saw in the first time wha^ he was
rauysshyd or afterward wha^ he had he^ in thou^t / were no bodeli things /
but images of bodeli things But in yt time of his vision / ne after in besy
ythnki^g / he wist not what it betokened till he was helped by ye grace of god
and then afterward he understood by ghostli feli^g and knowe^g what it should
betoke^ / In ye third vision yt is callid Intellectuel / ye soul sees tho
things yt be^ no bodies ne have no liknes / ne form of bodies. as man's
soul. and each a good affecco^n of ye soul / yt is to say / love charity and
devotion / Joye. pees / and such other / None of such things bodeli may be
showed by image / but only in ye soul / by ye myt of god. as it is in his
own substance For there may no man see ne know charity / as it is / but he yt
has it in his soul / and so it fares by all other ghostly affecco^ns of ye
soul This vision had saint poul after ye writing of ye doctors. for asmoche
as he was rauysshed into y^ third heaven. y^ is to say to y^ knowe^g of y^
godhede / he herd preuy words / y^ is to say he had a shewe^g of y^ preuy
being of god with out any figure. This third vision y^ is callid Intellectuell
by al doctors is most excellent / for insuche visio^s our merciful and loui^g
lord ofttymes litneth me^nes souls and concsie^ces by words of doctrine. and
so^ time comforts me^ / and techith hem of things y^ be^ to come / and of
other holy techi^ges / and of his preuet^es with his inward speech of godhede
/ by such an inward vysion. of knowing / as I said before / Of this speech of
godhede saint gregory makyth distynco^n / Either he says we ben enfourmed with
the words of god. when he spekyth himself or^elles wha^ his words comen to
us for our enformacyon by angels. wha^ he spekith to us by hym^elfe / then is
oonly the strength of thynwarde showing and knowing opened to us Also when he

apperen wicked spyrytes / But ever ye shall know the one fro the other / in

How they should be ^yamyned that have vysions or ^^u^laco^ns to know whether
they comen of a good angel / or of a wyckid spiry te: Caplm xix.
BY the saying of our holy faders and doctors of holy church / wheder he be
man / or woman that have vysions / thus they should be examyned. to preue her
^euelacyons. whether they ben of the good angel. or of the badde / First it is
to take heed / whether he that sees. be a goostly liver. or seculer / and
worldly / Also whether he live under obedyence / special. or contynuall
techyng. or dyscypline of some elder dyscrete virtuous holy and expert and
preuyd man / which is his goostli fader / or else at his own proper will /
Also whether he submytteth him in his vysions lowely to the dome of his ghostly
fader / or of other dyscrete / and sad ghostly lyuers / for dread of
yllusions / or elskepith hem preuy. and show hem not but stondeth to his own
examini^ge and to his own dome. Also whether he have any presu^psion of his
visions / or make any boost of hem with vaynglory. or holds himself the more
of reputacyon. or has any other men in dispyte or indygnaco^n / Also if any
good deeds or virtues of obedyence / or mekenes or charity. or besy. prayer be
Joyful or likyng to him for that time / or else whether there be in him any
sheweng of vaynglory / or presu^pco^n of ^lacyon. of pride. of neclig^ce of
prayer / or else desire of worship or dignyt^e. Also wheder this man or woman
be holden. and preuid among ghostly livers / holy and true obedient to his
prelates and souer^ynes and governors of holy church / or else wheder he be
hold defectyf. or suspect in the faith. or holdyng opynyons. against
thordinau^ce and techiug of holy church. and not obeyeng to the hedes and
prelates of holy church / Also whether he have long continued in gholi living
mekely / and in penance and in exercysing of vysions and reuelaco^ns. or else
whether he be but a nouyce. as in the begyn^yng / Also whether he have kyndly
understanding or feling. or any ghostli knowyn. or any true or dyscrete dome of
reison or of ghostly ma^^^ y^ longs to y^ soul / Also whether he be light in
kind or light of fr^ylte in chere and word, or in deed / or else whether he
has feeble understanding: or whether he have a sad knowing or felinge or
else a soden wit or fantastyk. Also whether he have be often times examined in
such materes of visio^s or reuelaco^ns of wise me^ and lettred / and dyscrete
ghostli living men or none. This examynaco^n needs to hi^ / that has vysions
/ For saint gregory says / holy me^ have a special grace and discrecyo^or an
insight of knowe^g between reuelacio^s and visions in heringe of voices And
seeing of images. with bodily / or goostly eye / that they may know. what ye
shall take of a good spyryte for comfort / And what they shall suffer of y^
wyckid spyrite by yllusion / Therefore he that has vysions or reuelacions / it
is good to show hem to other by mekenes and that he sto^de not to his own
dome / for dread of pride or of presu^pcyon. As to the maner^ of saying. or
heryng / or receyuyng reuelacyons / yet must the seer be examyned. ferthermore
/ Also wheder he that has hem* sees / or heryth he^ wakyng / or slepyng / or
dremynge Also whether in bodily sight. or by ymagynaco^n / or ghostly fight or
else by an Inward understanding. and true knowing of the yefte of the holy
ghost / Which three dinysions of vysio^s I have showed you before. Also whether
he feel in his soul any ghostly swetnesse of the love of god above kindly

vysion / Yet must the (...) be examyned ferthermore / And the quantyte also of
the vysions. Also whether the vysions or ^euelacyons accord with holy
scripture / or not. Also whether that vysion accord / or besteryng of virtues
living / and helping to mannys soul / Also whether that vysion in showing /
is en^linyng to any error of holy church of the faith or to any wonder / or
to any new thing / or to any thing against reyson / Also whether that vysion

(...) and soueraynes of holy church / Thus and in many other wise as falls
to a mannys mind. must they be examyned the which have ^euelacyons. For but
if there were such examynacyon before. there myighte be fall great error /
and great peril / Sometime in the aff^^mynge of the vysions: And sometime in the
^eceyuynge both of the vysions and of him y^ receives hem For if they be
demed suddenly and vndyscretly then shall soth be take: for falls. and falls
somty me for sooth in to great peril / and so good vysions and sooth should
be forsake. and men should not obey to the preuy speches of god. ne give no
credence to hem / but rather take error for troth / as oftymes has fallen
all day. for defawte of discrete and true examynaco^n / And all such lightly
taking of vysio^s and reuelacions ben but temptaco^ns Wakyth therefore and
prays that ye fall not in to temptaco^n Vigilat^et orate / and c^ /

Of vij. special tokens / by the which a man shall know visyons of a good
spirit f^o illusio^s of the devil / Caplm xx.
NOw ferdermore ye shall see how ye shall know vysions of a good spyrite fro
yllusion of the devil by vij. tokenes / The first token / is siker / that it
comyth of a good spirit. when the person that sees the vysion is preuyd meke
Inward under the o bedyence and techyng of his goostly fader / or under the
counsel and techin ge of some sad preuyd man / dyscrete and virtuous / and
of ghostly living. And when he has no pre su^pcyon / ne makyth no bost / ne
desires no praising / ne hydeth not his vysions / but with very mekenes
shows his temptaco^ns and vysions to the dome of such a good man / to be
examyned / And then that he hold forsooth. that good me^ approve / such a
soul may not be dysceyued after the sentence of our holy faders / For among
other col lacyons I read of one that heyghte Moses / which said in this wise
There may no man be dysceyued that lives under the dome and ensample of elder
and dyscrete me^ / Of this ye have ensample of that noble lady and precious
saint Bryde / As long as she lived. young and old / she lived ever under
obedience and techinge of holy clerks / and virtuous and dyscrete elder men.
Therefore by the words of that holy man moses and other holy faders acordyng
to the same* clearly it is preuyd / that all her reuelaco^ns in her books came
of y^ holy ghost. and not of the devil* and this is a general techyng / amon
ge al ghostli livers / thus for to do^ ^or to void / or wythstonde
temptacyons. or suggestyons / or yllusions of the devil / The second token to
know a good vysion of a soul / that he be not dysceyued / is when the soul
that s^^th that vysion / (...) himself fulfyllid / o^ ^a uysshyd / or chau^^ed
/ or (...) with a ghostly savor in the love of god This inward charity and
swetnes of love / the devil may not give for no man / ne the devil gives
not that he has not / as I said before / therefore in this it may be sothly
concluded / that it is god that so werkyth in a ma^nnes soul. and that namly
if the soul be then streng thed in the full faith of holy church. with
obedience / and lowely mekenes / to the hedes and the ordenau^ce of holy
church. Thus preueth an holy man Hugo de sancto victore / Also saint Antony in
vitas patrum Also says saint Gregory / where he shows how god spekyth to us
by himself / as I showed before in ye xviij. chapter. The third token to know
a vysion. is wha^ he that sees that vysion / whether in bodily sight or in
ghostly sight. felith in his soul a soden ghostli thing spri^gyng / with an
Inward felinge / and a knowing of sothfastnes / what it meneth and betokens
/ that sight that he sees and when the under stondyng of all the matere that
he sees is verily showed to him in his soul / and clerly is opened to him and
plainly all that is nedeful to be known of that vysion. This Inward knowing
and goostly light of true showing. comyth not of the devil. for he may not
put that in the soul / but oonly god / To this acoordeth saint Thomas Alquynus
and says. the devil shows not to men that they known by goostly light of
understanding above kind. but by some other vysion ymagynatif / or else by
sensible s^che / and so in this manner sheweng. ye shall know a falls vysion
or reuelacyon / or prophecye fro a true. To this mater^ acorden many other
doctors. whose words it ne death not to show* for it suffiseth to you to here
ye clerks acorde to th^^ ye see of other men's writynge The fourth token is
when he that sees fyndeth always sooth that he seth. and when it is always
showed to him in such visions (...) techyng acordeth to honest and to virtuous
living. Such tokens when they come. they come of god for the devil in his
yllusions sometime seyth soth to dysceyue and sometime false But the holy ghost
shows and tellith always so the and never falls therefore says saint Thomas
alquin^ In some outward signs the prophecye of the devil may be known fro
reuelacyons of god / Therefore says saint John Crysostom Some sheew prophecye
in the spyrite of devil as ben thise men and wymen which men call dyuynours /
or sothsayers Such men say soth by her spirytes. and sometime falls / But the
holy ghost always says soth / The fyfthe token to know thise vysions is by the
works and the living of hem that have thise vysions. For as we read / A badde
tr^e may not bring forth good fruit / Also our lord says ye shall know hem
by the fruit that comyth of hem The sixth token is when a vysion comyth of god
by the endyng and worshypful death of hem that have such reuelacions / For when
any such man that has vysions / and if he be disceyued with such yllusio^s
of the devil. As when they show some things sooth to dysceyue he^ in some
other comynly* w^^fynde by our holy faders writing. that such men make a
dreadful end. for either they fall in to errors in endyng / or deyen
peryllously: or soden death / and without sacrament of holy church. and that is
the will of god For he would that other men should dread such yllusions / and
better beware But it is the contrary in holy me^ which ben comforted with
vysions in her lif. For god in her endi^ge comynly werkyth or shows by grace
As was in the death of sayn te Johan the euangeliste / and many other saints /
The seventh token to know vysions or reuelaco^ns comes of a good angel / or
of the holy ghost. is showing of miracles after the death of hem that sees the
vysions: For he that is overcome by begyling of vysio^s of the devil in all his
life / is not worthy that miracles shield be showed for hi^ after his death /
Therefore after the death of saints. good showed miracles in reyfing of deed men
/ In gyuyng sight to blind men. herynge to deef men / speech to dombe men. and
in many other miracles / by cause they were not begyled with yllusions in her
life / For they yaf no credence to no vysion ne reuelacyon / till it were
examyned in maner^ as I said before / Thus then by thise seven tokens and
examynyng of vysions which I have showed ye may say shortly after the saying
of our hol^ faders* that a man or a woman which sees. or has reuelacyons. if
he be found meke in examynac^ on / and namly if he live under obedyence / or
governance or techynge of his ghostly fader / ^or some sad dyscrete holy
liver. and if he felith his heart and his mind rauysshed upward to god in time
of prayer with a special ghostli savor of y^ love of god. and he then being
in ghosttly vysion / whether it be in bodily image. or vnbodeli / by an Inward
simple understanding. the^ ne if he be showed to him clear knowing / and
fulfyllyng with a soden coming of an holy heet^ and swetnesse of the mater^.
that he sees in such such vysions. and if evermore it be showed sooth / that
he sees in his vysions / he and his even christian ben edefyed / and amended,
Such a person what he be / is not begiled of the devil. ne his vysion should
not be despised but ^lowly they shol de be received. As of the soul of god: In
manner as I said before after the techyng of doctors of holy church / and
other holy faders

Now thus have I showed you seven tokens / to know which be^ reuelacyons* and
vysions of a good angel / But some perauenture, for such vysions: and for
other grace that they have to teache or comfort other ben tempted with
presu^pco^n Therefore some words of this matere I will show you / and for
asmoche as men and wymen have been dysceyued by yllusions of the devil in such
vysions and reuelacyons / every man should mekely dread vysions / for peril
that might fall Wakith and prays that ye fall! not in to temptacion /

Vigilate / and c^ / That vysions prophecies / dona cyons / or other ghost^y
comfortynges. or werkynge of miracles preue not a man nor woman holy ne
perfyghte* And how a man shall receive all such special ghostly graces / that
he be not dysceyued Capitulum xxi.
MAny men and wymen have had and have reuelacyons and vysions. and some have a
spyryte of prophecye / Also have devotion and great plente of teres / and
comfort much other folk. and cou^seylle and convert hem with her holy speech
/ and with her techynge / as other with devout speech / or prechynge / or with
holy terms in wrytynges / and making of books in latin or in englissh But all
these and such other preue not a man ne woman holy ne perfyghte / For a
repreuable may have all these virtues / and many other / Therefore in all such
virtues / the which s^yre us to any va ynglory / or ypoc^^sie. we have great
need to dread. and set our (...) evermore in lowenes and mekenes / in love
and charity. For what man has mekenes and charity he is holy and perfyghte
though he have none of all the other before / And though he have all the
virtues together* but if he have mekenes and charity. he is another holy ne good
/

I read of our lords dyscyples when they had preched. they came again to our
lord with great glad nesse / and said / Lord in thy name wicked spyrites ben
subget to us and obey to our com^aundementes And anon our lord answerde thus
/ Makes no gladness for y^ but rather be glad / for your names ben written in
heaven. In as^o che as they were glad oonly of her miracles. they had in her
heart a preuy temporell Joye / But in thoos words that our lord badde hem be
glad. For her names were written in heaven / they were called again fro her a
pryuat gladness in a common / and fro a temporal gladness in to everlasting /
All holy me^ and wy men which I call gods chosen chyldern / how they work
no miracles. ne have no spirit of prophecye. ne reuelaco^ns ne vysions. and
yet her names ben written in y^ book of life / Good gods chyldern and good
lovers shall no Joye have but in common among all men and in him / or in y^
where no e^de is of Joy and gladness / It is full needful in all our works
outward / whether they ben in deuoco^n / and comfort / or or techyng to
other* or in any special grace / put in us. y^ wisely we deem ourselfe first of
any thing. and s^ly search ourself. that we see and know what we ben within /
And then think that all thise yeftes / which we receive ben yeue^ to us /
not for our merits. but forher grace and for her profit. that been comforted
with such yeftes / that god ^e^deth us / Thus then to think y^ such yef^^
come^ for her grace and her profit / and to think on our sins and
unworthiness / though we be styred or pryckyd with vai^glory. we should with
lowenes of heart put it away. we should also dread in all such special yefte.
For as I said be for^ / our holy faders for a lityll trespace to our knowing
outward our lord chastysed hem sore / and for a time wythdrewe his gifts.
and his special grace fro hem / Of this also we have an ensample of Moses. We
read and know well that by specyal grace he brought gods people out of egypt /
Also of his miracles we read that in the mount of si nay after his fasting /
he received the tables of the law / which god would have kept: Also that in
all the lightnyng and thondryng when all the people d^ad. he alone spoke ho ^mly
with god / He departed the re ^d see / that the people might sauf go over By his
prayer the people had mete fro heaven to assuage her hun gre / He yaaf hem also
flessh by miracle / But what time they had need of drink. for great thirst
that they had / then moses fell in mis trust / and was in doubt whether
they should have water of the stones there god badde him smite or none / But yet
he smote on the stone / and they had plente of water. Thyrty year after this.
he wroughte many miracles: And wha^ he came to y^ land of beheest / he was
called to an hylle / and there he herd how much was his trespace / when he
doubted and trowed not to have water out of the stone* and for that offense he
wist well he might not come in to the land of beheest / By this we may see how
we should ever more dread y^ preuy dome of god. that so punissheth his
servant / after so many miracles and visions / and many wonderful works /
and after so many years / oonly for one trespace / If then such a man so
specially chose^ of god was punysshed for one trespace / howmay we have pride
and vaynglorye of vysions / or of any other yeftes and tokens outwar ward Also
to show how repreual men may have such yef tes / we have in the gospel how
our lord says / Many shall come to me in that day and say. lord in thy name
we have showed prophecyes. and in thy name we have cast out fendes / and done
many virtues deeds But I shall say again to hem / I know you not / goo away fro
me werkers of wyckidnes / If then miracles and such open virtues be^ not
greatly to be charged / we shall then^ lityll set by reuelaco^ns. or vysions /
as to have hem in any deynte as for hemselfe / or for our comfort here. But as
much as they styre us. or increase us in to the love of god* with mekenes and
charity. so that the conclusion of this matere for remedy to hem that been
traueyled with pride / or vaynglory: for il lusions or for other special grace
is best to each man and woman to traueyle for mekenes and charity. and to
ground hem on thise two virtues passing all other / Also I said beforo in the
v^. chapter / that some for tenderness of kind. ben soon styred to weeping
teres and to other goostli comfortes as I reherced in the second chapitre Of
this matere I read that the dyscyple of love asked how he might torn to the
worship of god such te^es. and other goostli comfortes. of the which he was
in doubt whether they (...) of tenderness of kind or n^^ (...) wysdom of god
answerde thus to his Inward vnder^^o ^yng (...) is hard to know of such
maner^ te^^res which be^ of kind (...) which be^ above kind for by cause
they be^ so like* Therefore as soon as thou fe lest any such gladness. or Joye
in thy soul / or any such swetnes of teres / or of other tokens of comfort.
you shall lift up thyn ^ert and ^ondes. as a bell did in manner of sacr^fyse to
him y^ sends al gladness: and offer up al gladness and ghostli Joye desiryng
with full heart y^ it might be turned and spended to his worship that is maker
of al mankind and gyuer of al grace. and then such teres and tokens of
grace which were peraue^ture first but of the naturell kind. and without
merit / may be made merytorye and above kind. Thus then in this chapter I
have showed you y^ no man should be presu^pt^ous for no reuelaco^n / ne for
none other special yeftes of god / Also how a man shall turn ki^ deli
affeccio^s / and make he^ merytory above kind. Now ferdermor^ I will answer^ to
thy ghostli sickness se* which I spoke of in the vij. and viij. chapiters /
and to iiij. sects of living / y^ I showed before after y^ viij chapyter / But
for asmoche as ye see euermor^ that mani perilles fallen to ghostli livers be
they never so holy Therefore wake and pray that ye fall not in to te^ptaco^n /
Vigilate:

How sloth and Idleness gender siknes and how werkyng with grace is nedful /
and how three. kinds of me^ fall by unstableness / and that unstableness is cause
of all other / the iiij. ghostli fevers and cause of all other errors showed
before / and what remedy may be to he^ that been fall in to such errors / ca.
xxij.
IN such sickness it is good to know what is the cause of the sickness / and
then for a pryncipal remedy. it is speed full to void the cause if it may
be voyded / Right so to our purpose it is good to see / what is the cause of
thise ghostli fevers and errors which I have showed / and so by a voy dau^ce
of the cause. cast remedy for the sickness / I said in the vij. chapter /
that by cause so^^ men will not with grace. they fall in to such sickness.
the which I showed in y^ same chapitre / or other chapitres foloweng. for as I
said there / Sloth gendreth sickness and werkyng with grace is nedeful In
this y^ men will not work by grace / many perisshe^ / for they find not
grace: or see it not / or else though they find grace. they leave it and
forsake it for dyfficulte of traueyll / Therefore says an holy clerk / ^i
cardus de s^to victore / They err foul and go far out of the hie way which
trust somoche on grace that they leave the werkyng of her own^ free will. But
yet they err much more* y^ stand upon her own free will. and take no head
of grace / Merit of good living may not be without grace. there is no
merit but al evil / therefore they goo in the even riht way that feel in
werkynge by dyscreco^n / y^ another free will may be meritory without grace. ne
that grace may not work* without a free will For another god without man* ne
man without god / but god and man work togider. Therefore says thapostle / not
on^li I myself but y^ grace of god with me. for we be^ werkyng with god / and
god with us. the grace of god gooth before our will. y^ god should be the leder
/ and not man For man shall yield and offer to god / and not to himself all y^
he may do to the worship of god. and work with grace / By thise words slou
the ge^dreth sickness. and werkynge with grace is nedful^ for y^ bri^geth
perfecco^n. that is a specyal remedy to put away that noieth / and take to us
that helps / and that is the most so^^eyne medycin to such ghostly sickness
/ Other sickness there ben as I said before / which I liken to diverse kinds
of fevers. thise gho stli fevers also may be helped as I said before in y^
maner^ / to put away y^ cause of the siknes. which cause is unstableness Three
kinds of me^ fall in to unstableness. the first be^ they. make any vow or
begin oni thing / and hold it not / y^ second be^ they that forsake her
charge / after time they have be^ charged. the third be^ they that change her
state. or her degree / The first kind of unstableness is repreued in the law of
holy church / Where saint gregory shows / how a man y^ was named Ananias
deyed a foul death. for he yielded not the money that behote. as we have by
holy writ. Upon the which text doctors saye^ / that it is much more
alienaco^n a man^es own person / than alyenacyon of money. If then so
great peril fell by unstableness / for brekynge of byheest of a dedely thing.
Much more then ben they in peril that wythdrawe her living. which they
have behight to god. Therefore say the the wise man. the unstableness of a man by
lustful couetyse turns up sodowne the wit / The second kind of
unstableness also is repreuyd by saint Jerome of a man which after time he had
chosen solitary living he wolded well in cytees. Also right as a man in his
baptesme takes a name of his (...) stendom. and behoteth a g^od ^rysten life.
if he break then^e afterward / he is unstable in all ways Right so in the
same manner ^e unstable that changes his sad love from god. and by a falls
colour^ loves other things more than needs / As when he will change his
living / to have now one maner^ living / tomorough a another The third kind of
unstableness is also repreued by a decree where men of holy church ben
repreuyd. y^ forsake: or change that they have taken tofore / and goo to a
another. for her own case which is lighter and not of so great merit: ne so
helpyng to his soul / If he then be to blame* that has him so unstable in
his charge. of a another man It is no doubt but he is mo che more worthy great
blame that him so unstable in keeping himself therefore y^ souereyn remedy aye^
all thise ghostli fevers. in what degree a man stand. It is good that he to
work by counsel that he fall not fro no good living. ne fro his devotion /
ne. change not to wers by his own unstableness / I showed you also before.
after thise infyrmytees of iiij. manner sects of men but they be^ knytte
togider thise me^ ben so blind in her soul. that they hold by presu^pcion
and ypocresye false opinyons and errors / and live co^ traryousli to all good
living / they forsake all ghostli traueyle and exercise of virtues. and besieth
hem to geteful rest of kide / Also through this rest. they leave all charity. and
s^ke only love of kind / and all her bodeli ple sau^ce Also there they hold
that her ydlenes and kyndly rest is so hie perfercyon / that they should not be
let with no maner^ werkyng / and so they say / they ben poor of spyrite
by cause they have forsaken al will and desire / Also they say what ever they
do it may be no sin For what ever they do they be ladde by the ho^i ghost
therefore they may do what they will without any sin / Al thise men live
much contrariously to god / and to holy church techyng. For by all holy
writ and do tours of ho^i church / it is needful to each man so to live /
that he live not contraryousu^ to virtues. al though he have not virtues
perfyghtly. For if a man live contrarious to virtues. he lives in sin / To
this accords y^ words of our lord / there he said. he that is not with me:
he is against me / or contraryous to me. / Therefore he that is not meke. is
proud / and longs not to god and so of other vices and virtues, the^ ne
seems it well / that it is need full / either to have virtues / and be in
grace. or else live contrariously to virtues / and abide in sin^e for that
time. Also they live contraryously / For by holy scripture that we read / a man
may never hold himself perfyght while he is in this life / For the more
perfyght that he is. y^ more he will hold himself vnperfighte / Therefore every

with all deuoco^n and virtues / and with al exercyce of bodeli traueyle or
ghostly* for god must be loved in all good work. for in wicked works god may
not be loved / In such work if a man's entenco^n be set to y^ loving and
worship of god. then y^ his purpose or entenco^n more rihtful / and more
acceptable to god / and more loves and restores hi^ to god tha^ any other

when he said thus / he that will come to the he yth of contemplaco^n he may
never rest while he wakyth / but euermor^ he must areyse his heart upward /
For in stirynge upward. unrest is rest: (...) he that desires rest is ta^yed.
and traueyled. and may not so lightly goo upward / as he did before while he
traueyled. Thus then I have showed you how such men ben deceived. and fall
in to errors when they traueyle and seek ki^dely rest / But hard it is to
tell a remedy to such men that been dysceyued / for vtterli they ben so
blinded that they see no defawte in he^ self / And though her prayer or

Of affecco^ns. and specyal of reasonable affecco^n / which sometime by
te^ptaco^ns be^ turned and changed: and what is the cause and remedy against
this te^ptaco^n Caplm xxiij.
AFfecco^n is a wylfull bowyng / or enclinyng of a ma^nys ^ert with love to a
another man / Of this affecco^n there be^ three diverse ki^des. Some affecco^n is
gostli some is reasonable. and some is unreasonable. some is offycial some is
naturel and some is carnel of ghostli and reasonable affecco^n I will show you
and pass over fro all other affecco^ns An ho^i clerk A(...)d abbot of ^yuars
s^^kyth of holy affeccio^ and says y^ ghostli affection may be understood in
two manners For the heart or the will of a man is st^ed what time the soul by
^o^ pucco^n is made soft (...) light. and is molte^ in to the swetnes of the
love of god. or in to a tenderness of charity in broderhede with a preuy (...)
also then visitacio^ of y^ holy ghost y^ manners and y^ tokens of such
visitacio^s. Ishewed you before in y^ ij. chapitre The ij. ghostli affeccio^ is
y^ (...) which is al contrario^ to this. the which is ge^dred and stired of
y^ wi^ bid spirit. by y^ which falls affeccio^s a man is stired to al filth
and sine / of y^ which spirit the prophet spoke / wha^ he said. y^ spirit
of for nycio^ has deceived he^ Of this affection I speak no more /

Another affection there is that falls most (...) purpose which is (...)
reasonable affeccy(...) comyth (...) inward beholdy(...) a another man's virtue
as (...) a vert(...) an holiness know of (...) woman. by common fame / or by
(...) dyng of any man's life / moves our souls in to a tender softnes of
love / this affection styreth a man to a soft compucco^n* and makith him have
mind with a likynge ghostly medytacyon of virtues deeds that been done before
As when he heryth of the glorious passion of martyrs / and of other saints
lives. Also it is a reasonable affection when we ben styred to love of man or of
woman more thanto a another / for virtuous living or techyng / or ensample of
hem. by who^ we be edefied ghostly and styred to better living. Also reason
sometime month a man to the love of god and of his eu^^cristen / or neighbor
al though none affecco^n me(...) Butthe holier the love is. it is more sikeret
and the more reasonable / and the more profitable. Therefore reason dryueth us
for three skylles to the desire of the love of god and to love god / The first
is for our own mede / the second is for our profit. and the third is for he
is worthy to be loved / It it is nedeful to us tesche we da^pnaco^n / it is
profitableto get^ us bliss / and he is worthy to be (...) / for he loved first
us without deserving / of us. But this love is not most profitable love. ne
it is not most perfect skylle / whi we should love hi^ pryncipalli / for
himself and for his godenes / and for he is al go (...) (...) good god and
lord be (...) for his godenes and worthyn(...) without his godenesse we (...)
wretches. and with his good(...) full blessid / y^ good lor(...)s goodness /
which has no(...) to our godenes for man / woe(...) man and dey for man /
^eso^ th(...) dryueth us to love this good Ihu / and if y^ heart of the soul
asse^t to this reason / all thouh a man have it not of ghostli affeccio^ / as I
said before / so y^ of a good will be he stired into a desire ofy^ love of god
reason does his devour / and thus love may be callid a reasonable love to god /
thouh it be not full ghostli affeccio^ / Also by the heest of god each man is
lou^de to love his neighbor as himself. also by reason each man shall be stired
to yield good to his neighbor But first must we see what he is y^ is our
neighbor / each man y^ is our neighbor / either he is our friend or he is
not our enmye. or else he is our enmye. peraue^ture our friend. for he
profits us. or has profited us / he is not our e^mye for he noyeth us not.
or has not noted us. he is our e^my for he does v^ha^m^ / or has done / or
would us harm / he is our friend / either by kynrede or by grate: He is not our
enmye / by cause he is In^ocent / he is our enmy for wrong that he does
Therefore reason puts three skylles why a man should love his friend / He
puts two skylles why he should love his enmye. We should love our. friend by
naturell reison. for he is a man of familiarte with us. and by office that is
to say to reward him aye^ for his friendship And for we be bound by the
precepte of god to love our even christian / we shall also that is not our
enemy. by kind / for he is a man. and by the precept of god / we shall love
our enmye only / for god badde us love our enmyes / Each man y^ can thus bow
his will to reyson for to love his neighbor. though he feel none affection /
he shall not lease charity / I have showed you more of this love to god. and to
our neighbor. than I was in purpoos at the begyn^yng of this chapter /
nevertheless it may prouffyte other simple folk when ye common with hem. But now
to our purpoos among reasonable affeccyons that is most perfyghte / which
comes for a another man's virtues living / For that love is full virtuous /
and full profitable / for what desire of virtues that we ben excyted or
styred to by affection / And what for the lothynge of sin and dread that we
have by techynge or ensample of living of such goostly livers. and if our
mind stondeth always even. and clear without any corrupco^n in such affecyon /
then is it none harm / if we desire the presence of such men that we have
in affeccion For by her ensample we ben corrected if we ben evil / if we ben
good we be strengthed by hem. If we have the same perfecco^n that they have /
either may be stabled and comforted by other But though it be profitable to
desire the bodily presence in good affecco^n of good men and of holy men and
wymen. It is not profitable to seek hem often. or to be tom^che with he^ for
sometime they may be sought more than it nedyth as I said before By bodily
presence of saint poule and barnabe was full comfortable to her ghostli bredern
in an tioche* Yet they herd how it was said to hem the by the holy ghost.
Depart poule and barnabe in to mynys tracyon / in y^ which I have callid he^
to her prayers and let he^ goo. Also in all such affeccions it is full
needful to see the end. that might fall. thereof. as well as the beginynge /
that the cause of that affection for falls suggestyons and subtyltees of our
enemy. and by our own^ vnstabylnes and infirmite Thise affeccyons ben in the
beginning holy and reasonable / but som^tyme they ben e^ded in a another manner
affection / or somewhat changed / Of this chaungyng I read many ensamples / how
full holy me^ have been begyled / which ensa^ples nedennot to be showed at this
tune in special / also I will not / For so me when they read such ensa^ples
that been written for good intent / they torn it after to their nyce conceytes.
and make thereof sportes and scorns. and the cause is. for they ben so blind.
that they may not ne can not see her own Infyrmite But this I say for a
general rule what man or woman / religious or other degree that dredeth not
such affeccyons / he stondeth or goth in a full slipper way / and he or she
what he be: is likly to have a foul false / but he bewaar / The cause of
chau^gyng of such affecco^ns is to much famyliarite / or for tobe to hoomly /
Therefore the best remedy to flee the peril of unreasonable affection, is
evermore to dread the end that the affecco^n in the end be none other through
to much famyliaryte that it was in the beginning For among all preuy deceytes
and temptaco^ns this is one of the most preuy and the most deceyuable

Of this mater^ now no more Much more I might write if need were. But this I
hope suffyseth to you / Now ferdermore I will she we general remedies against al
ghostli temptaco^ns: But for a souereyne remedy against all this and all other
/ euermor^ I counsel you

Wakyth and prays that ye fall not in to temptacion /

Vigilate / and c^ /

How pacycus is a general remedy against all traueyles and temptaco^ns / and of
other general remedies against all goostly temptacyons / caplm xxiiij
IN all trybulacyons and te^p. tacyons / it is needful to be pacyent / as for
pryncypall remedy against all hodely dyseases and goostly. each man if he
search his conscience well and his defawtes / for the which he is rightfully
chastysed. he shall bear much the more liter the chastysing that he suffers /
Therefore says an holy clerk Ysiderus / No man ne woman should grutche in
gods scorgynges / for as much as he is amended by that that he is undertake
and chastysed. And in this we should learn not to grutche when we suffer
hardenes or aduersitee. though it be so / that we know not / for what defawte
we suffer. For he that is chastysed of god. and grutcheth against god. accuses
the rightwysnes of him / that demith rightfully. Thes^e it is spedefull in all
the chastysinge of god mekely to suffer without any grutchyng / Also it is a
another remedy to deem ourselfe worthy all such chastysinges and many harder /
/ though they come / For in that demyng we shall the better suffer hardenes and
sharpnes. And well we may suppose that rightfully we shall suffer / For of him
we ben demed. whose dome may never be unrightful / Therefore says the clerk
Ysiderus he that knows in his heart. that all his chasti singe that he
suffers comyth of a ryghtfull dome of god. though he know not for what
defawte he suffers. yet he is Justified in the sight of god. in asmoche as he
acuseth himself and worshipeth and commends the rightwis god / And though y^
soul be tormented with ghostle te^ptacyons of the wicked spirit we should not
suppose therefore that we ben not aliened or forsake of our good lord. But we
shall trustly hope that we ben the more acceptable to god. when we deem so of
ourselfe / and worship god and thank him of his rightwysnes. Also it is a
another remedy against such te^ptacyons / to thank god for his rightful
chastysing / For he chasstyseth us never: but for our great profit. Therefore
says the same clerk Ysiderus. A rightful man soul is traueled with diverse
te^ptacyons for his great profit by ye dome of god. For the which if he give
lowely and lovely thankynges to god / and deem al chastising r^^^t fulli send
of god for his own de fawte. then shall all that passion that he suffers be
accounted to him for virtue. For as much as gladly he suffers and demyth
himself worthy to suffer. and thankyth god lowely for his passions that he
suffers Thus then have we showed you three pryncypall remedies against
temptacions. Firs te to suffer patiently the s(...) to deem ourself worthy to
suffer and y^ third to thank god for his chastysing loweli Also in each
temptaco^n and trybulacion bodily or ghostly it is full comfortable to think
on the words that says by y^ prophet in the psalm. Cu^ ip^o su^
intribulacione (...) c^: As I said in the beginning of the first chapter /
Upon these words thought sain te bernarde when he said / Lord give me always
trybulaco^n / that y^ inward always be with me By these words the will of reason
desires always temptaco^n or trybulacyon. for purgynge or chastysing of the
soul / but the will of kind desires the contrary. And aslonge as we
wythstonde te^ptacion / never assentyng to hem by the will of reason. so long
they trowblid us. and by y^ they ben needful / For if we assente to hem against
reyson / then should we incline to y^ nether will / which is the will of
kind / and then we stand in great peril. Therefore what ever great
temptaco^n a man have / whether it be of the faith / or of any dread. or of any
stirynge of dyspeyre / or blasphemye / or of any wicked temptaco^n. ghostli or
other Aslonge as the will of reyson says contrary / there is no dread. for it
is no sin. For though any be traueyled by thynstygaco^n of y^ fend / that
he is in doubt of the believe of the sacrament of the awter Aslonge as he is
sorry thereof: that he may not believe it fully / but feign he would / this man
therwhyles sin^eth not in that. and thus it fares by all hie temptacyons /
Also if a man or woman / love not his neighbor. or brother or suster / or
else perauenture has envy to hem / if it so he that he would love hem. and
is so be that he love hem not / in this he syn^eth not / For as says saint
austyn / that each sin that is not wylfull is no sin^e / that is to say. no
dedeli sin. But all though such temptaco^ns ben no sin^e. which ben not
wylfull. yet it is nedeful to deem in ourself / that they come to us for some
sin. known to us / or unknown. As I said before / for a general rule
against al temptaco^ns. It is nedeful to show it to our confessors / either in
general words / or in special. For such a confessor it might be / that it
were not spedefull. to show him all goostli temptaco^ns in pecy all that fall
or may fall to a ghostli liver / Therefore to such a confessor it suffyseth
to speak of temptacio^s generally / in to time a man may com^ and ask
counsel of a another man more discrete and more expert in such mater^ / Thus
then shall ye conferme your will to gods will! in all temptaco^ns / and
say or think in the maner^ as I said before in the first chapitre Also a
another remedy is and a special against wyckid spyrites to think on the passion
of christ. crossing upon the forhede and the breast. and some done pryncypalli
with the toke^ of thaw / and say In not^e Ihu signo me thaw. and with other
blessings / Some say a verse that is in the ympne Cultor dei meme^to / in this
maner^ O tortuose serpens discede disce de xp^s hic est. cristus hic est
liquesce signu^ (...) ipsi nosci da^pnat tuam caterua^. Some say Ihus aute^
transie^s p medium illo^^ that: In noi^e pr^is / and c^. Per crucis hoc signu^.
and c^. Ihesu / when it is callid to our help it is to us a gracyous liight /
to light us in derknes of our soul / It is also mete fulfylli^g us with great
ghostli savors / and it is to us medicyne / to all to hele al our sores
Therefore says saint bernarde upon the cantycles / No thing refreyneth the
feernes and the malen colie or of Ire / as to call this name Ihu / no thing
so swageth hi enes of pride as y^ holy name / No thing so helith the wound of
envy as the virtue of that name / No thing tempreth so couetyse / as to
think on that name / No thing so resceyneth the lust of lecherye as to
think on the virtue of that name / No thing voydeth so sone slouthe as this
name / and so forth of al other / All thise and such other ben siknes and
sores of the soul. But to call to this name Ihu / and to think on the virtue
/ that is souereyne medicine to all these go ostli sickness. and that our lord
shows us by his own teching / wha^he said by the words of the prophet.
Call me in the day of trybulascyon. for I shall deliver the. and I shall worship
the / So in all maner^ of temptaco^n. it is a souereyne remedy / to use and
call this name Ihu / Saint Ancelme thought well also / there was great virtue
and comfort in this name. and therefore he used to say often Ihesu Ihu ihu /
propter nome^ tuu^ s^tm sis michi Ihus Also some use much to say this ve^rs /
Deus in adiutoriu^ meum intend. Of this verse I read / that saint Ildegare an
heli non^e / when she said her sawter / though she vnderstodenot what she ^ad /
yet acerte^ verse / and specially anon as she began this psalm. she saw how
the fendes tanne away fro her / Also an holy fader Ysaac / as I reed in y^
collaco^n of the faders taught that verse. Deus in adiutoriu^ meu^ intend. and
c^. for a general remedy against all steringes of temptaco^ns todely or
ghostly sleping. or wakinge Also many other me^ use other verses of the
saulter. which ben of great virtue against vyckyd spyrites / and all
temptaco^ns: Some use to say the last verse of the psalm / Inclins / which
ben thise Respice i^ me. and c^ / and fac mecu^n signu^ in bonu^ and c^ / Some
use also this verse / Diripusti dn^e vineula mea. and c^. which verse after the
opinyons of some clerks is of great virtue Also some use thise four last
verses in the psalm Dn^e ^yau di the latter. which verses ben these Eripe me
de inimicis meis and c^ / Spu^s tuus bonus / and c^. Educes de tribulacio^e /
and c^. Et pdes oe^s qui tribulant ai^am / and c^ All thise verses with other
virtues siuynge: and other holy prayers may be strength and comfortable and
remedyable against all temptaco^ns and tribulaco^ns. Also I read how our ladi
taught saint Bride wha^ she was tempted with any wicked spirit. that she
should say with a loud voys to the fend dyspysing him. Rescede a me malign
sp^us nolo vias tuas / That is to say / goo away fro me thou wyckid spirit /
I will not of thy ways Also it is a great confusion to the devil / when he is
repreuyd and dyspised / as I said before in the xv. chapitre. Therefore it is a
spedeful remedy / when a man or woman felith any stirynge of thise hye
temptaco^ons / anon then to speak out. and say that the devil may know what
a man says / to his shame and confusion in this maner^, Almighty god fader in
heaven if it be pleysinge to the / with all mine heart I desire y^ my soul
might have a place and an office in thy bliss. where this cursid spirit
miyght have been if he had would / There lord grant me to be euermor^ to
worship the. where this false fend should have be that thus is abowte to begyle
me / A my good curteys lord fader almighty. my wyl^ is as often as this foul
spirit trow blithe me with temptacyons to offer to y^ mine heart in sacrefice
wythal deuoco^n and worshippes that may be to thy plesinge / In this maner^ as
I read by many examples shall the devil soonest be discomfited Thus then I
have showed you ^emedyes against dreadful ghostly temptaco^ns. and for as much
as many men and wymen that been full holy of living / and every man and woman
is somewhat traueyled with some passions. or else at the leest with some manner
passion of the vij. pryncypall vices / or of the branches of hem / therefore
now I will show you some special remedies against such general passions

But euermor^ in all passions and dis eases. prayer is most souereyne remedy /
Wakyth therefore and prays that ye fall not in to temptacion / Migilate and
orate / and c^.

Of a special remedy against diverse traueyles and passions / that come of the
seven pryncipall vices Capitulum xxv
AChe man and woman knows or should know / which ben the vij. dedeli sin^es
/ other many frau^ches there ben / which men know not! but ye by discreco^n
and by that ye have read and herd. I hope in god ye know more than many
other: both which ben the sin^es and which ben the branches / when ye be
prycked with any of hem But perauenture ye have not always in mind / the
medicynes and remedies to wythsto^de hem / or to que^che hem if need were /
therefore both for yourself and help to other: such remedies as clerks show I
will write to you here y^ye mayhaue he^ redi in time of need. Thise ben the
vij. vices. Pride. couetyse. wrath / en uye. slouthe / glotenye and lecherye /
otherwise me^ sets hem in order in diverse manners / but therefore lityll
charge at this time / For I will show but special remedies against each of
hem. First then against pride and against the spices of pride / it is a
special remedy to behold our own fylthe and freyltee / that is to say to
behold in our self what we ben in kind / fro the time that we ben first
conceived unto the death and in the deyeng and after the death We should also
think / that all te^porell gods ben not lastyng: For riches and worshippes
ben but lent / to man / for a time. to yield rekeni^ge of hem how they ben
spended Also we should think that the riches and y^ ghostli yeftes that the
soul has. be not ours. but they ben y^ yeftes of god / as wit and knowing.
and other yeftes of al which shall yield hard rekenyng. The evil deeds be^
sikerli ours / therefore but we do mekeli penance for hem / we shall find hem
in pain after our death Therefore says saint Gregorye to proud men / Thou man
that art but earth and ashes / or powder foul and freyl in kind / harken
what ye wise man says. The gretter thou art in worship or in dignyte / or in
any reputaco^n. meke the in all things. and then thou shall find grace
before god and man / Also it is needful to each man that is traueyled with any
spyce or pride. to use deeds of mekenes / that is to say to vysite the seek.
and the deed and to be hold hem inwardly and to ky se y^ ba regrou^de / and
other such lowlynes. whereby a man may abate the pride that is within. Also
meknes of prayers / is a special remedy aye^s te pride. Against couetyse and
against the spyces thereof it is a rem(...) to think. what (...)ryll it is in
g(...) of riches what besines (...) tra^^y^e is in the keeping fro (...) and
(...) deceyuable men Also it is good to think that a rich man is no(...)re
siker. (...) may lityll and lityll multeplie / but soden^ they ben dys perklid
Also riches increases anatyce in a covetous man as drink encreseth thurst in
a man that ha the the dropesie. therefore it is a great folly to coueyte that
dyseaseth both body and soul. Also a pryncipal remedy against auaryce / is to
trust stedfastli in god which forsakyth not hem that trust in him after his
beheest where he says / Be not besie in thynkyng what ye shall (...) te or
drink and so forth / Your fader in heaven knows well what ye have need of al
thise thyn ges. If wicked men and cruel me^ or bestes nourysshe her childern.
much more than that noble and soth fast fader will not forsake his childern /
which trust on him / Our lord will ordeyne one of three things for hem that
cast away coueti se. and put her trust in him For either he will ^^deyne for
hem that needs / er else (...)est for her liuelode. or else he will ordeyne
a man in such need and myscheyf / as great strength / as though he were in
great plentee / and that is merry to be stro^ ge with a litil / or else that he
with draws fro the body. he puts in the soul by goostly comfort / that
will fully and gladly he will lack bo deli plentee to have ghostli richesse Also
it is good to think that he deseruyth great bliss / y^ for the love of god
wylfully suffers bodeli need / For as our lord says / poor me^ ben blessid /
for he is y^ bliss of hem. Also it is a special remedy aga ynst this
temptacyon. to think much on the death / For saint Jerome says a good word /
Lightly he dyspyseth al in this world that thynkyth always he shall deye / Al
so it is a remedy to him that is traueyled with couetyse / to yield again
other men's goods / and to give freely of his own gods Thise that I have
reherced with prayers may be remedies against the passion of couetyse:

Against wrath or malencolie. and spyces thereof / It is good a man to think on
his own misdeeds what may come to mind for the time / Also it is good and
spedeful to each man that has great pasion of malencolie / or of Ire: to
refreyne his tongue. when he has occaso^n of wrath / unto the time that his
malencolie be abated. Also in tyne of wrath it is good to change his
occupacyon / and put him to some other likyng besines / where by the heart may
be occupied with some good communycacyon / or with some wisdom to make him
forgete his wrath. Of this passy on it is good to bewar^ For it hurts soon
the conscience / and takyth away a man's fame / It sclaundreth other men / It
makyth the heart in unrest: It dryueth out the holy ghost / It deseruyth
pains / Also it is a remedy for this passion to use deeds of lowlynes and
sofnes / As a man to ask for gyuenesse first of him that wrathyd him. Also for
to use kneling as for satysfaccyon of this sin / Also to wasshe poor men's
fete / To speak fair and soft. and in good lowely / and in glad chere.
Thise remedies with the remedy of keeping of scylence. and with prayers for
hem that wrath us may be spedefull and comfortable in time of need / and
remedyable to refreyne his passion /

Against envy and the spyces there of / it is remedy to desire not / ne love
not that the world loves. As worshippes. richesses. lusts / or vanytees. and
such passing things For he that desires such. has co nunely envy to hem.
that has such. but if he may have the same or like. Also it is good to
think that though he had not that thing / for the which he has envy to
other Yet perauenture should he not have it. Whereto then should we be
trowblid for any good / or worship or for any other thing / that a another man
has. without our harm. In this envy / if a man fall in to hatred: then
it is good to think / that god forgyueth not a man's sins / aslonge as he
hates his neighbor. Also it is good to think / if a man shall be saved he
must conferme him to his brother. therefore beter it is to do at betyme. than
abide till it be to late. Also it is good to think / that it helps not to
think long on wrongs. but rather it turmenteth and bryndeth a man in to
unrest / therefore it is good do after techyng of saint poul. that says Be not
overcome of evil / but overcome evil in good. Also against the passion of
envy / it is a souereyne remedy a man or a woman to be bon^^^ / and to use
deeds of charity. and to love his enmyes to pray for hem yt disease him / to
do good to him that hates him / to comfort hem yt ben heavy and sorry. to teache
hem that been vncu^nyng and to part with other that have need of his goods.
both bodeli and ghostly / such as god has sent to him / Thise remedies with
contynell prayers may help much against the passion of euie or hate / Against
sloth and the spices thereof it is a reme dye to think often upon the traueile
/ that crist had in earth and upon his good works to whose goodness al good
works: that all me^ may do ben not in co^paryson. but as a drope of water to
the quantyte of the great see / Also it is good to be often with good me^ and
wymen that gladly will speak of god.

Also some time great heaviness comyth of slowthe. Therefore to such diverse
occupacyons. and chaungynges from one good work to a another. ben to such men
or wymmen to put away heaviness Also though that a man or woman be heavy or
weary in goostly works. as for prayer or other devotion / It is a remedy to
strive therwyth and keep still his traueyle / till he may have comfort by grace
/ as I said before in the fourth chapter. Also against sloth it is a remedy
to think what perils we fall in night and day / slepyng and wakyng. In
slepyng men fall sometime in peril of fire and water / and thieves wakyng.
there ryseth up in our hertes great floodes of vanytees / and many vycked
thoughts / or else fire of some wicked desires / is kyndled in our conscience
/ or else thieves. that is to say wicked spirytes. or wicked men ^^he day
assail us / Therefore saint Jerome says / Do always some good that the devil
find ye never vnocupyed Also against sloth it is a remedy to think how good
and how delectable is the everlasting mede. to the which may no man come
without fructuous labor. Also to think how herryble and how dredful. is the
everlasting pain / to the which pain men may be brought by s^outhe and
ydlenes and werynes of good deeds.

Thus then have I showed that besinesse and ocupacyon / and chaungyng of
works / As some time to read some time to pray and other honest traueyle, ^en
special remedies against slouthe / and idleness /

Against Glotenye and the spyces thereof. It is to take heed. that mete when it
is mesurably taken and well defied: it makyth a man hole in body* and sharpeth
a ma^nys wit / and makyth him well dysposed to serve god. And excess of mete
werkyth all the contrary It feblith and dulleth a mannys wits / It gendreth
sickness / It brings a man soon to death* and most peril of all. It makyth
a man like a be / In that / that he dystroyeth in hyms^lf the use of reason.
Also it is good not to ete ofter / than at ^ouenable time. but if sickness
make it / For the law is not put to sike men / Also the most spedefull remedy
is to him that is traueyled with this passion / is for to forbere curyou^ and
delicate metes / and drynkes / to re(...) freyne the lust of glotenye / In
this passion / it is needful to stry. ue. and fight dyscretely. For the
leesse we strive therewith. the stronger it will be / And the less it is
overcome / the stronger all other vices ben against us / And we ben the more
feeble against him / By this sin death enters in to mankind / therefore the
devil tempted first christ by glotenye. as by then tryng of all vices /
supposing thereby that he might lightly afterward tempte him by other
temptaco^ns Also against glotenye dyggyng of water. and abstyne^ce of flesh /
al these with prayer be^ remedies aye^ste the vice of glotenye. Against lechery
and aye^nst the spyces of lechery / to destroy vtterli that vice. fasting is
nedeful / Also a pryncipal remedy and a needful is to each man or woman to
flee thoccasion that is cause of his passo^n. this needs not to be expressed
to you. For ye know well that in diverse men and wymen ben diverse passions of
the spyces of this s(...) / And each man or woman felith in himself to what
spyce he is most dysposed / therefore it is the most souereyne remedy thereto:
to put away the pryncipal occasion. what ever itus. Also it is a remedy
evermore to dread his own dysposicyon / though he seem never so siker / for
fulholi me^ (...) wymen after many years in her living / have fallen by the
suffrau^ce of god: and perauentur^ presu^pcion has be cause thereof / for it is
a remedy euermor^ to dread. We have ensample hereof in the old law. how Dauyd
that was so holy fell. Salamon / that was so wise fell / Sa^pson that was
so strong fell. and so of other men and wymen / Also if this passion or
stiryng come of the hyenes of the flesh. It is needful then to tempre it /
with abstyne^ce or wakyng or some other bodily traueyle. and with some sharp
weringes and hard / so it be done dyscretly For it is not good to destreye
the more for the less* ne the substance for the accydent. Also sometime this
passion comyth of great trowbling of thoughts by temptaco^n of the fend. And
sometime by dysposicyon of a man. or of a woman though he be right feeble of
comp(...)yon / or ^ll^^ for pain to him for his sins done before. w(...)
(...) of sin ^o not fully dystroyed by satysfaccyon then it is a remedy
evermore to dread as I said before And think that the r(...) of his old sin
eleuyth: always v(...) him And that often confession knowlegyng his own
Infirmy(...). (...) use also lowlines. shar^e dyseyplines with his own ^^ndes
with ^oddes. as in par^ye of satysfaccyon for such unreasonable lust of the
flesh. Also it is a remedy to think often on the death. Therefore says the
wise man. Sone bethynke the on thy last end. and thou shall never sin / Also
ocupaco^n in good and honest besines is a sou(...) reyne medicyn. Therefore
says sa(...) (...) Alwa^^ do some good Also some use for to traueylle of
thou(...) of stirynges of the flesh / to say th^se words with smy^yng on
the breast Scrutator (...) diu^ and renu^ deus miserere miserere mei. Thise
words serve for Jole thoughts / and for delectaco^n in thinking / Also some
use to refreyne such lusts / for to think on yt passion of Ihu. and say
thries this verse with smyting on the breast. Saluator mu^di salua nos / qui per
cruce^ and sanguine^ tuu^ redemisti nos auxiliare nobis te depcamut d^e deus
(...) / Also some use that discypline and soorgynges for such passions / say
therwyth thise verses / Vulnera quinque deisint medicina mei / and this verse of
the saulter therwyth. Qm^ lu^bi mei ^pleti su^t illusionibus et no^ e^ sanitas
in carne mea. Also in the same time some use this verse / Quinque plage dn^i
(...)i (...) xp^i profuit michi ad remissionem p^to^^. meoru^ and ad vita^
eternam / a^ with this verse of the saulter / Delicta iuue^tut me and
ignorancias meas ne memineris dn^e: Thise remedies with other prayers / and
with ter^s of contrico^n. or of compassion. and of deuoco^n with redyng and
medytacions ben spedefull against such stirynges of lecherye.

And for as much as this ma(...) longs so^dele to satysfacco^n wha^ it is
do by auctorite. therefore now I will show you of satisfacco^n / and other
ghostly ne^. prayer is taken for a souereyne remedy / Wakyth therefore and
prays that ye fall not in to temptaco^n Vigilate / and (...)

That satisfacco^n and traueylle with bodeli afflicco^ns and ghostli be^
nedeful to purgaco^n of the soul. aslonge as a man or woman is traueyled with
any manner passion / Capitulum xxvj.
IT is nedeful ^ule in general order or living to a man or woman. which has
done vnlefully / that he ref^^yne him self fro that / which is lefull / In
this refreynyng we must hold ij. things. that is to say / the manner of
satysfacco^n. and the need of purgaco^n. The manner of satysfacco^n is that
af(...) the trespaas. the refreynyng of that / that is leefull / be mesured by
auctoryte of holy church that after the words of saint Johan / we may do
worthy fruytes of p^^au^ce / But this manner of satysfaccyon longs to him to
know that has cure of soul. as it is written in holy church law. to you /
It needs not to know / Therefore I pass over of satysfaccyon. But now to
show of the need of purgacyon of the soul Ye shall understand that it is not
oonly needful to ^e* freyne fro things / that been lefull for satysfacco^n.
but also to use afflicco^ns / or traueyle in ghostli werking outward / to put
away passions / or make hem less* which we have in custom. For Itrowe each
man and woman has some traueyle with (...) thing more than with a another
thing: and that traueylle we call a passion / Thise traueylles which we done
outward / which ben callid exercise / ben Instruments of the soul Inward /
with such exercise and Instruments. wicked passions ben put away / which
deface the soul / Therefore it is need to each man and woman first to take heed
besely / what passion is most against him. and most traueyle him and to seek
out wyseli which ben the Instruments against all such passions* Then^e it is
good to set against each passion a maner^ Instrument that is most acording to
fight with that passion. As thus wakyng against vnvable heart. Scilence against
wrath. occupacyon and traueyle against sloth and heaviness. Abstynence and
sharp dyscypline against the passion of lecherye. and so for the of other
passions / that each passion be chastysed with an Instrument of the soul /
which Instrument as I said before is an exercise of y^ body outward / in some
bodily penance and traueyle But yet must we here bewaar that we be not so
fervent to quench one passion only* that the Instrument of the bodi fail to
fight against another / Ne it is not good to traueylle utterly to quench al
maner^ passions. but dyscreyli so to traueyle and so to use other
instruments. that when any passion arise it may be aswage(...) te^pered by the
dome of reison Thise afflicco^ns and wylfull traueylle inward. and pacyence in
temptaco^n be^ needful purgynges for a man's soul: All such traueyles
wylfulli offered to almighti god. may skilfully be a^^u^pted for acceptable
sacrefyse / therefore said the pro(...) (...) spirit trowbled is sacrefyse to
god But now ye shall vnderst^nde that there. is a wylfull sacrefys(...) which
is more acceptable to god y^ is not constreyned For the other sacrefyse in
maner^ is constreyned by y^ trowbling and the traueyle of y^ spirit / Of this
wylfull sacrefise the prophet thoute wha^ he said Lord wilfulli I shall to y^
sacrefise. for it is good. This wylfull sacrefyse is wha^ a man by free liberte
of y^ spyrite lifts up his ^^rt b^ fervor of y^ ^oue for thiges that (...)
granted with he^ / or by hem y^ ben com^aunded to y^ medes of the bliss.
which y^ ordened to he^ that traueyle for he^. to this perfeccyon our lord
and our savior calls such men and wymen that been of fervent love and faith.
if thou wylt be perfyght / goo and selle all thy gods. and give hem to pore
men. and come and follow me / Thus then these ben wylful sacrefysesas thus.
when a man wilfully / and of devotion forsakes y^ world. or when he voweth
chastity / or byndeth him to any streyt living / by auctoryte or perfeccion:
and though it be so. that by Infyrmyte or unstableness of heart / sometime by
temptacyons a man's heart torneth again to the desire of ye world / after time
he has forsake it Also / though a man or woman feel corrupco^n in his flesh
/ after time he has auowed chastyte / and though a man or woman takes more
rest and ease / after time he is bound to a streyghter living / will never
leave god therefore / That perfeccion of living shall be acoou^pted among
wylfull sacrefyse / for as much as in the begyn^yng wylfully he offered
himself to such a perfeccion / Therefore it is good for each man and woman
that freeli has take any perfeccyon / besely to behold first / what longs
to his vow / and in what things / and how much he is bound / and then
dyscretely feel in himself / what outward bodeli strength and Inward he
has to continue in exercerse of traueyle bodeli and goostli / as his vow or
bond of perfeccyon askyth / Inward strengthes I call pacyence in dysese. and
stablenes of heart / and will and strength by fervor of love in prayers
redynge and other goostli affliccyons / with the which a man stryueth al day
in battle of temptacyons / Outward strengthes I call. health of body
strength of brain / and of other. bodeli limes / with the which he may
continue /. and suffer his charges of his bodeli traueyle / to the which he is
bound / And all though outward and Inward labor be nedful to hem that been
not fully perfighte Yet bodily traueyle and affliccyons specially purge the
soul / from fylthes of passions / And ghostli teaueyles and exercise of prayer
/ and medytacyons. and redyng fulfill the soul most specially of swetnes of
love. Therefore affliccyons and bodeli penance outward with prayer be^
needful to hem that been traueyled with passions. When the passions ben
aswaged. or quenched. then it is leeful to abate the penance bodeli. and use
more fervent Inward traueyles / as redyng / meditacyon / prayer / and
contemplacyon is yeuen him by special grace. so that all thing in dew time
he discretli and loweli used / and not with presumpcyon / in no point / that
is contrary to his vow / or to his rule / Thus then have I showed you of
nedeful purgaco^n for a man's soul. and of a wylful sacrefyce. and how bodeli
penance and traueyle purge the soul fro the fylthes of passions Now will I
shortly reherce the matere of the chapytrees before / and so forth make an
end / But for as much as I spoke of passions / if ye feel any of those that I
have showed Wakith and prays that ye fall not in to temptaco^n / Vigilate /
and c^

Recapytulaco^n of all thise matters. and of four manner of prayers Capitulum
xvij.
AFter your desire / ^eligious suster a few words I have written to you of the
chastysing of gods childern. First how our loving lord Ihesu criste plays
with his chylder by ensample of the mother and her child / As sometime he
wythdraweth his comfortable yeftes / when he absenteth him ^s by his graco^us
werkyng Also how ye shall bear you in his presence / and in his absence / and
what is his presence and his absence. and which may be the cause of his
absence / But for as much as necligence and unkindness were the most dredful
causes of his absence. therefore I say to you. Wakyth and prays y^ ye fall
not in to temptaco^n / I have showed you also by example of a loving mother /
how our good lord as says and preuyth his chyldern with hardness / after time
they ben strengthed with exercise of virtues / First how he wythdraweth his
co^fortes to preue his chyldern with stablenes / Afterward how sharply he
spekith: and threteth his childern sore by dreadful temptaco^ns / which be^
grievous passions But some as I say wylfully ren^e out / and fall in foul
errors for presu^pcyon or for unstableness Also I have showed you of y^ power
of wyckid spitrytes. and how some in old time for lityll / or light defawtes
by the suffrau^ce of god have be traueyled by wicked spirytes / Also how some
with vysions and reuelaco^ns have be deceived. Such perils I have showed you
in general words (...) some in special for yesholde (...) of your enmye /
and therefore I said Wakith and prays that ye fall not in to temptaco^n.

I Have showed you also what profit is Also I have showed you specyal remedies
against certain dredful temptaco^ns. and general remedy against all ghostli
temptaco^ns / And special remedies aye^ such passions. that comen of ye vij
peyncypall vices Also how bodeli affliccyons with ghostli traueylle is needful
to each man and woman as long as he f(...)h the grenaunce of passions. and by
cause that contynuel traueyle outward and inward with devout prayers ben
needful in all te^ptaco^ns / therefore for a special remedy evermore I say /
Wakyth / and c^ / Prays then ententyfli in time of prayer / of your dew
service / for to y^ prayer ye be most bound. and in y^ time of prayer ye
should desire / and thereto do your besines. and dispose you to have swetnes of
devotion / if it would fall / than any other prive prayer / But often time it
falls / that some men and wymen in her beginning wene they feel great
deuoco^n. or ghostli liking in her own prive prayers / or meditaco^ns / or
else in her time of her contemplaco^n / they say the more hasty and with less
savor her service that they ben bound to do / for great desire that they
have to other special deuoco^ns / which they have not in charge. this is a
temptaco^n / of the which I should have made a menco^n before among other
te^ptacions. but it was not then present to my mind. Of this defawte it is
good to bewaar. for many me^ and wymen ben deceived in this defawte. wenyng it
be no syn^e / But soth it is syn^e to hem which have knowing. that it is /
sin^e so for to do. but they do her besines with all heart to say her service
/ with as much deuoco^n as god will send for y^ time. for if they hye hem
wylfully (...) without reasonable cause. more in ye time than in her other
preuy prayers. they may not exscuse he^. but that they ben neclige^t of gods
service. Then^e it is nedeful as ferforthe as I feel. and as I have learned / y^
we dooo our besines to pray entyfli in time of our service / that is to say. in
time that we say hours of the night and the day. and in the time y^ we say
mass. or here / after the ordenau^ce of holy church. and in the manner as it
was ordened of our holy faders. I say in the maner^ as it was ordened for some
now in thise days use to say in englissh her sawter and matynes of our lady /
y^ vij / psalms / and the letanye / Many repreue it to have the sawter /
matynes / or the gospel. or the bible in englisshe / by cause they may not be
translated into no vulgar word. by word / as it sto^deth: without great
circu^locuco^n: after the feling of the first writers. which translated. that
in to latin / by techyng of y^ holy ghost. neruertheles I will not repreue to
have hem in englissh / ne to read on hem / where they may stire you more to
devotion / and to the love of god. But vnterli to use hem in englissh. and leave
the latin I hold it not com^endable. and namly in hem y^ ^e^^ou^de to say her
sawter / or her matynes of our lady. For if a man's confessor give him
penance to say his sawter. without any other words / and he gooth forth and
say it in e^glissh / and not in latin as it was ordained. this man I wene does
not his penance / Causes I might show reasonable and many. but by cause I
trust to god: that ye will not use your sauter in that maner^. therefore I leave
to speak of this matere / and counsel you as I said before to pray ententyfli
in time of your service / whereto ye ben bound. after the ordenaunce of holy
church / and in the maner^ as it was ordained of our holy faders. If ye will
ask how ye shall pray deuoutely in prayer. which ye vnderstde o^not / I will
answer^ thereto. and say that for the virtue of the words / and your lowenes
and obeysau^ce m holy church / with feruert desire upward to god after your
intent / though ye understand no word that ye say / it may be to you more
medefull and more acceptable to god. than great deuoco^n that ye wene ye have
in other preuy deuocyons. Of this we have ensample of mani saints / which
needs not to reherce here / for I trow every man that has reasonable or
ghostli feling will say the same / Also ferdermore some man peraue^tur^ will
make obieccion here. and pleyne or exscuse him / that in time of service often
he is let and tarried with diverse thoughts. wherefore he may never have
deuoco^n to god ward. ne have his heart upon that he should say. Sooth it is
that many man and woman has this Infirmite and passion / that by temptacion of
the fend they be more trowbled with thoughts in saying of her dew service /
than in other time of private prayer or of medytaco^n / and some ben so ferforth
distraught / and her heart so often and so far / and so long time a^ened that
when they come again to hemself it is clean fro her mind where they left. and
what they said or what they said not. And thus some begin again so often there
they left that uneath in all a day and night the^ may come away to say her
service / y^ (...) conscience might be dyscharged In this obiecco^n I
perceyuen. dyseases / the first is a greece dread in conscience. and the second
is a noyous traueyle by temptaco^n and thoughts To thise two dyseases it
needs to show comfort and remedy. comfort to the conscience / and remedy to
the traueile. To show you comfort of conscye^ce in this mater^ / it is nedeful
to each man or woman that duly will say his service / that he dispose him
outward to put away occasyons of all maner^ lettyng outward / to take time
and be in place when and where he shall have leest lettyng / inward. to set his
intent in full will to void all idle thoughts / and holy to set his mind
upward to god. in all maner^ deuoco^n if then after / in time of saying his
heart be aliened any time by (...) or by temptacyon of thought^ / and when he
perceyueth that his mi^de was away and turns then^e his b^rt anon aye^ to
god though then he fares s(...) often in a lityl time / him needs not to
(...) again. so that he be si(...)er that he said it or wot where he left For
such often rehersing may be a taryeng of y^ ^ende. to heavy a man in conscience
/ and by that to let him fro other ghost. i besines. and yet to some it h^
(...)th: that both before (...) after. they ben skylfully in peace of (...)
st^^yd to devotion / But of this saying of service it is no dread of
conscience though a man have not his mind thereupon / so that he dyspose him
outward and inward in the maner^ as I have reherced Nevertheless all such
neclygence by interupco^n of thought in g^ddes service. we must show to our
confessors / in each confession to ston(...) more clear in conscience / for
our own demyng in open confession puts away dread of conscye^ce:
Ferdermo(...) as for remedy against the traueyle and of temptaco^n of thought^
it needs not to reherce here. for of this mater^ in party. ye have in some
chapitre before. But yet specyal Remedies may be showed to hem that been much
traueyled with any thought or ren^yng thoughts in time of her service / Oo
remedy is to say all thing upon the book / what thing he will say. though he
can it never so well by heart / A another remedy there is (...) a more siker.
when a manfelith hi^ so vnsiable of mind to say with a felaw / asofte and
asmoche as he may Thise ben spedefull remedies to he^ that in her service ben
let / o^ trowblid with thoughts to make more ententyfli to pray And have
heart to god ward. Prays therefore ententyfli in time of your service. prays
also devoutly in other time of prayer / and for asmoche as many men and wymen
desire to know a manner rule of prayenge in time of prayer / therefore I will
show you of feur maner^ of prayers in time of prayeng / Before ye goo to prayer
/ occupye your Inward wits with some maner^ meditacio^ of goostli mater^
which ye have read before or herd by com^unycacion: that by some ghostli
savor ye may the sooner be styred and better be dysposed to devotion. Pray
then^e first for yourself. as ye think most nedful and spedfull / both for
mercy and for grace. with a specyal prayer as comes to your mind / by the
yefte of god for the atyme. Pray also for your friends. and for your enmies /
and also in general for all other both quycke and deed / Your third prayer
shall be oblacyon. and sacrefyce offryng up to god your open vow that ye have
made in your holy baptesme: Your other preuy vows that ye have made by way of
devotion / All other deuocyons preuy or peert. all your ghostli affecco^ns and
all your bodeli affliccyons. with meke heart. besechyng that all these may be
acceptable to him / as sacrefyce and oblacyon. for you. and for all other / for
whom ye be bound to pray or have com^ended hem to your prayers. Your fourth
prayer shall be worship herynges and thankynges yeldyng to god for yourselfe /
and for all his gracyous yeftes freely yeuen to you / and to your friends / In
thise four maner^ of prayers. ordeyneth your time of prayer / after your
dysposicyon / as god will give you grace / For thise manner of prayers. should
goostli lyuers use. by the techyng of our holy faders and by specyal ensample
of our lord Ihu crist / when he prayed to his fader in heaven. As for the first
maner^ of prayeng he showed us ensample / when he said Pater fipossibile. and
e^. Fader if it be possible suffer this passion goo fro me / Also when he said
Deus meus deus me^. and e^. My god my god whi have thou forsaken me. In the
same manner should we pray to almighty god our fader in heaven. First specially
for mercy for all defawtes / in which we have offended him And then with
condicyonall prayer in all temptacions and trybulacyons / in all ang^es and
dyseases / and in all other need / that ^f it be his will / he send us comfort
in aduersite: and grace and strength to wythsto^de temptaco^ns / and all maner^
sin^e. (...) perseuerau^ce in virtue / and tem(...)au^ce in prosperyte. As for
the second manner of prayeng. our lord gaaf us ensample. when he said Pater
quod dedisti michi / and e^. Fader hem that y^ haste given to me / I will y^
where I am / they be with me. that they see my Joye which y^ have given to me
/ Also when he said / Pater igno^e illis / and e^ / Fade^ forgive hem that wot
not what they do. In the same maner^ s^el^ we pray. first for all the sta^e of
holy church. and for all the states reyny^ge in earth. and specially for our
friends both bodeli and g^^stli. as we would pray for ourself / and as most m^^
be profitable to body and to soul / as falls to mind for the time Also for
our enmyes y^ god grant hem charity / and forgive hem her ignorance / For
the third manner of prayer / our lord gaaf us ensample when he said. Ego
clarificaui de sup terra^ I have clarifyed the upon the earth I have made an
end of that werk that y^ yauest me to do. Also wha^ he said Pro eis sci^fico.
and e^ / For him I halowe my self y^ they may be hallowed in sothfastnes. In
the same maner^ we should offer up oureself both body and soul with all our
heart. with all our vows preuy or peert / Al our deuocions and al our
affeccyons / all ghostly traueyles / and all our bodly affliccyons / and all
graces and gifts. ^yen to him in a maner^ of sacrefyce* both for ourselfe /
and for all our friends quycke and deed / and for all other that needs help
or comfort / Thus prayed the prophet when he said. Volu^tarie sacrificabo
tibi qm^ bonu^ est / Also in a another place when he say Dirupisti dn^e vincula
mea tibi sacrificabo hostia^ laudis et nomen dn^i inuocabo / For the fourth
maner^ of prayenge we have ensample of our lord when he said Confitebor tibi /
and e^. I knowledge to y^ lord fader of heaven and of earth for thou haste hyd
these things fro wise men / and fro men of great cunning. and thou have showed
hem to small chyldern Also when he laid Pater gr^as ago tibi / and e^ / Fader
I yield thankynges to the for thou have herd me / In y^ same maner^ should we
lowely knowleche to our fader of heaven his might / his wysdo me and his
godenes. his sothfastnes his rightwysnes. and his mercy his benygnytee / his
softnes / and his swetnes. and such other virtue of his godhede. with lowely
thankynges for ourself: and for our friends / First for our creaco^n / and for
reformacyon. and for our preseruyng / For our grace and comfortes: for health
and prosperyte. and for all his gracyous gifts to body and soul / In this
knowlegi^g and thankynges. we worship our fader in heaven / For worship and
h^ryng to god is knowlegyng of his yeftes / and all such knowing / is
worshipyng and thanking to him. then with such knowlegyng and tha^ kings /
we should worship god in thise four maner^ of prayers / Thus have. I showed
you four maner^ of prayeng / The first is callid properly obsecracyon / the
second postulacyon. the third oryson / and the fourth thankynges. Thise four
maner^ of prayeng / the apostle showed in each oryson and obsecracion / with
thankynges your postulacyon must be known. and for god / In this maner^
then prays after the techynge of the apostle / Wakith and prays that ye
fall not in to temptaco^n Vigilate and orate vt non intretis in temptacione^ Of
t^is pistle now I make an end wyt^ thankynges to god. and if I have (...) in
my simple writing / for ygnerau^ce / or for defawte of felinge / I com^ende me
to your prayers. and lowely submytte me to other men^es correcco^n / And as I
am wont to say. or to write: so here I say for all defawtes. A Ihu mercy he
then that his almighty rightful and merciful in his tihtw^s chastysing have
mercy on the syn full Amen / Ihu xp^e vere quos castigas miserere /

Amen.

temptacyons the s^n^t the better it is to understand. that as dauyd says in
the sawte^ / The thout^ and the thynkes of man ben often idle and vain / And as
boli doctors sayen thereupon such thynkynges of me^ ben diverse and with out
nombre. Wherefore a man shall not tarry ne dwell in such thoughts / Ne
wounder much on them / neither enserche them in his soul / ne dyspute the
causes of them / For the more besely that he medleth him with such errors
and falsenes for to auayde them oonly by souereyntee of his own wit / The
more and also the ferder in he wadeth in to hem ward And perauenture
ouerdepeth and drenchyth himself in them. Wherefore a man shall not for such
fal^ mysrennynges in to his soul anger him self in hem, or disease him / or
went that such sorry thought come oonly of his own malice / or of his own
wit. for such a maner^ temptaco^n / so it be mekeli and easeli / is more to
his punysshyng than to encresing of gylte / or of his pain / And why For to a
man that willith to be faithful. such maner^ temptacio^ is dyspleysing / and
much against his will / wherfor^ it is painful to him but not gyltfull of
fin^e. Sith enery syn^e is wylfull. or else no fin^e as says saint austyn in
his book of perfecco^n of rightwysnes / Also saint Ysidere says he that is
tormented by the deuylles ensautes with ghostli temptaco^ns or passions. look
he trow ne bileue not the refor^ / that he is utterly forsaken of his god.
that suffers him so to be tempted / but look on each side y^ more ofter he
worship god. and yet y^ same clerk ysidere says. The devil tempts never
ferder the chosen of god / than god will suffer / and thou the fend would not
it were so / yet magre him / he makyth hem to take much profit by his
te^ptyng / so y^ they be goodly and meke. Also in the same book / the said
ysidere says Our aduersarye the devil is not weary to grieve y^ rihtwysma^ / ne
he rests never to reyse bataylles of te^ptaco^ns against him. for either he
fulfylleth him with anguysshe of heart or of soul.. or eltes he a^^^yth against
him bodily sorrows / and often times he tormenteth so man^es thought with
dyseases of such maner^ temptacyons / that a man falls almoost in wanhope /
But yet netheles if such a soul stondeth then steadfast in the dread of god.
and in his love. such manner of anguysshe shall much avail and profit him
in encreace of his mede And then such a soul is not twyn^ed ne departed
from his god. But rather Joined to him / when he is angered / and tormented with
such manner anguysshes / so that that he keep him within the bonds of
pacyence.

Many disease suffers a ^ightwys man's soul. by false suggestyon. and
Instygacyon. and stiryng of the devil / But yet may he not make him to
perysshe thereby ne mynysshe him of the bliss of heaven. For our lord god that
is so meke and merciful / accounts not to man's gylt or sin: that he of
his mighty lordshyp and mageste will that a man suffer / For as holy doctors
sayen / There we done amys / and synnen / where that we fallen / and ben
overcome with couetyse or lust: But there that by vyolence / and mawgry us we
ben brought in to wretchydnesse / It is only pain to us and not sin Thus
says this worthy clerk Ysidere. Netheles it seems that such maner^
te^ptacion of mysweni^g put in to man^es soul by yllusion And scornyng of the
devil were great gylte or^sin^e / wha^ it is an excitacyon for to put away
do^bte For each gylte done by will or un knowing. as if a man would not know of
his froward will / or else of vncu^nyng / as is sin / for such maner^ will
torneth more in to error than in to truth / Then^e since it is so that faith
is habyte of will / who so have will to believe. byleueth / who so has will
to hope. hops / who so is not in will to doubt / doubts not And in this
wise thouh a man be asesed in manner as I said before / Yet nevertheless. and
his heart stand to believe well / he byleueth well. For only in will that may
not be constreyned / stondeth man's mede and mawgre But otherwhile man's
soul is so derkid and dym^ed that he may not see for the time what that he
wyllyth but thereof no force for good works wytnessith good will. and evil
deeds evil will / and so men owe to suppose and trow thereof. till the reuerse
be openly prouyd or showed Yet over this if it be so / that such maner^
temptaco^n last forth and stinte not / but spekith by maner^ of the serpent
meuyng within forth fantasies. And in many maner^ wise turnyng about. offering

ne wonder: though he see our enmye y^ devil in such diverse maner^ tempte
such gods servants or chosen For this enmye as^yeth the feebleness and
freylte of every man^es complexyon / And whom he sees most sprent with the
moyst^^ of malen colie. him he trowblith and ^^aueylith most with goostli
temptacyon For clerks that treten of kind tellen y^ the smoke of black
color passing up in to the brayn comyth even to the place of the mind. and
derkyth his light. and trowbleth. lettyng the soul that it may not de me as
it should / And those that be^ traueyled in such wise. ben often sorry / and
dredful for ouerthwartnes And heaviness of her complexyon without oni skyle or
cause and such dread or sorrow is no sin / since it is so paynfull / and
so vnwylfull to the sufferer. And often put in of the devil / In so much
that it makyth many a man wene that falls things ben sooth. And that error
were troth / For thylke maner^ smoke of black color ouercouereth the
brain. and lets such men's dome / that they see not utterly the
sothfastnes of things. Therefore the cursid enmye considers. and beholds
the state of every man / For as says ^eo the pope tretyng of circumcysion this
old enmye leueth never of to cast forth against man his gren^es of deceytes
so that he might some wise destroy the faith of hem that be^ in good believe /
For he knows well enough to whom he shall profer^ the desire: and the eernyng
of couetyse / to whom the foul lusts of glotenye / to whom also he shall put
forth the steryng of lecherye / And to whom he shall poor in the venym of
envy / Whom he shall dyse ase with sorrow. And whom he shall begyle with idle
Joye / whom he shall disease with sorrow / And whom he shall disease with
woundryng / For he takyth head to all men's customs and weneweth the cures /
And awayteth her occupacyons / and sekyth out her wynnynges / And there he
besieth him most to anoye / where he fyndeth a man most studyously occupied
Thus says this clerk leo y^ pope And often he brings so great heuyness. and
bytternes in to diverse men's hertes And so over traueylith her complexion.

^emedye to stern and to be deed / In so much that often it happeth of such.
that they fall nygh in dyspeyre And wanhope of body and soul / For they trowen
that by encheson of such maner^ temptacyon. they ben forgeten of her god. / or
utterly forsake of him. the which has suffered his own chosen so to be
tempted and assayed. for as the wyseman says / Vasa figuli probat forna^ /
that is to say / the even proves ye vessels of earth / wheder they will
lightly break / or else dure and last / In the same maner^ such te^ptaco^ns
of tribu laco^n and disese assay and prove rihtful me^ / ^oo what Job says.
God has prouyd me as gold that is I molten and fined in the fire. For he
knows all my paths and my ways Wherefore says the apostle. suffer a lityll
while / if so it behouyth that ye should be dyseased in this world and made
sorrowful / that the prouyng of your faith made be made more precious / than
any gold that pasleth thorugh the fire / And the angel Raphael said to Tobye
/ for y^ were accepted. and well told of to thy god / It was needful that he
should assaye. Therefore in this caas it needs greatly of ghostly strength for
to suffer pacyently / and mekely such manner bytternesse / put in to the heart
of temptaco^n and tribulacion / Where for love every such one say with Job /
that is ferme of pacyence / If we have received good things of the lords
hand / why owe not we to receive evil things. ye and bethynke he the merit
of pacyence now / and the mede of Joye after. and say with Job. and pray thus
Lord spare me not of disease. and thou you slay me. yet I shall hope in ye What
wonder is it though a dedely man and a sin^er be angered and anguysshid here /
since our Savior says himself Tristis est ai^a mea vs^^ ad morte^. That is to
say: my soul is sorrowful and dredful to the death / Also in his passion he
cried thus / my god / my god why have y^ forsake me. Look also that he bring
to mind the word that Ysaye says in god the faders behalf to Ihesu christ
his sone / and to each of his lim^es / As for a lityl stounde I have left the
/ And for a lityll moment of mine Indygnacyon. and lityll setting by of the
for a time I have hedde my face a while from the. But in many things I shall
gader the again to me / and in everlasting mercy. I shall have mercy on the. It
is but lityll and soon passing. what so we suffer here in degarde of the
pain / that sinful deseruyth to have in / a another world save the mercy of
god / Ne wounder no thing though a chosen of god be goostli tempted and
assayed passyngli. all be it that he have good will to his god. for he is but
one of believe / ne out of charity by such maner^ of temptacion but he is more
sadly strengthed thereby in all good virtues / so that such one be pacient. and
take it easily: The manner of this temptacyon and the remedy. Christ showed to
his own dyscyples / When he said. Ecce satan expetiuit vos. and c^ / That is
to say loo sathanas the devil has coueyted you: for to syfte you he there and
thither / as who syfteth whete A man is syfted when he is Inwardely / and
utterly examyned And assayed with diverse temptacio^s But he is stre^gthed and
made full perfytly: when by virtue of pa cyence and of prayer / and also by the
hol some counsel of his friend / he is confermed and made sad in good / And
herfor^. it follows Ego aute^ rogaui pro tell and c^. that is to say / but I
have prayed for the that thy faith fall not / in such maner^ of tempta cyon /
And therefore thyself somtym^ turned again to god Make steadfast thy bredern /
that is counsel thy brodern (...)r to stand sadly against such ghos(...)
gryesli temptaco^ns. and fon dynges / Wherfor^ look that each su c(...)ne / as
often as he is tempted in such wise / that he say with the prophet david.
Quare tristis es ai^a mea / and c^. that is to say. My soul why art thou so
heavy and sorry / and why dyst^^wsist thou me. Hope and trust in thy god. how
ever so he will do with the / And also look such one pray. and singe if he
can / And do sometime other good deeds among / Also look he behold holy
writ / and the sawes of prophe(...) and pryncypally crystis sawes is the
gospel / And all he it that he feel no sensible devotion. ne swetnes therein /
as for that time / yet look he suffer mekely. For the good will that he has
thereto / shall suffyce / and be sufficyent to him to salvation. Often times the
devotion that a man should have and fest. is profytabli wythdrawe from him.
that his pra^yer may be the more merytory and nedeful. Loo what lernarde
says upon this text of the cantycles I have sought / and found naught /
For otherwhile he says / our spou se and our lord hydeth him / when he is
sought. that we should seek him the more besely / Herto acordeth saint austyn
in a book de verbo dn^i God yeuyth otherwhile latter. for we should tell the
more deynte of his yeftes / For things long desired ben the more sweet and
likynge to the geter. And often times things soon gotten / ben in lityll price
as to regard / Ask therefore. and seche besely in thine askyng. And hold on.
and increase in thine seeking that thou may win and get. For god kepyth to
the. that he will not that a man give to the / And why does he so / for thou
sheldest learn to desire greatly great yeftes. Loo also what saint gregory says.

Then ben gods chosen best herd / when they be not hard of him after her
own desire / For god gives to some in the beginning of her lurnyng a feling
of swetnesse in d^uocion / by y^ which they may be g^ou^ded in the love of her
god.

And yet afterward he wythdraweth it from him so through disease that they
suffer in such manner / y^ they may get hem the more mede and merit
afterward / for her huge pacyence and suffrynge For as witnesses the
philosopher: virtue sto^ death most in hard getyng of things and in trauerses
to come there to. then semith it well hereof / that ye good gotten of full hard
/ so it be truly gotten / is longest / and with most virtue holden and had.
And to be token this our savior said to saint peter / When thou were young
thou gyrdest the and walkedest wh;^^^ you would / But when thou shalt be
clear. another shall gyrde the. and led the whether thou wylt not / Also the
apostle says to men new converted. I yaue you milk. and not sad mete / for
as childern they were as to be nonrysshed with ye milk of swetnes and devotion
And after he makyth hem strong with fode of sorrow and tribulacyon / It is pure
easy and sweet to follow god and serve him in time of tranquylite and pees of
heart / and with contynuall fyghtyng within forth / between faith and the ghost
/ Certes it was full sweet to Peter for to be with christ at his
transfyguracyon. For peter said / lord it is good that we dwell stylle here /
But it was full hard and ferefull to him for to be with christ in his cruel
persecucyon. When he said I knew never that man. And netheles he that for a
word of a wenche forsook him tho. afterward through yefte and strength of the
holy ghost / he knowleged him before kings and princes / And stood with him
stiffly all to the death / Therefore if such ghosily temptacyon come / wexe in
thine heart therefore. as soon as you may afterward / and pray besely. god
of his grace. and thou shalt be strenger in thy bileue after. than ever thou
were before ferdermor^ for asmoche as such manner temptacyons fallen somewhat
of outrthwartnes of compleco^n. look each such one that is so tempted that he
be not much alone by himself. ne that he besie him not ouermoche when he is
alone in thynkyng on such thoughts. But let him use wise counseyle / and
speak of wise men and sad. And as they will read him look he stand that to
in oni wise / Lo what says the wise man Woo to him yt is alone for when he
falls he has none to help him up. and then wha^ a man is thus trowblid is
angry and heavy and dredeful of complexion. and also of his temptacion. let him
therefore draw to dysporte and honest myrthe with strength and virtue of soul
/ And ye more that he is traueled / somoche ye more look he give him as I said
ever to honest mirth and gladness This did gods apostles for thy went Joyful
fro the dome of princes and of other domes men tha^king god that they might be
worthy to suffer pain and passion for his love And all be it that he feel no
such goostli comfort in his soul wha^ he is so tro wblid / as thise holy
appostles felten / But perauenture he felith lityll or none. yet look he suffer
mekeli. And draw him there he may be comferted outward with honest company
and clean / lest as says the apostle / Such one might be spylled with
ouermoche heaviness / And though such one draw ofter to company and to mirth.
than does another that is not so tempted / he synneth not there in / so, he
do it to recover his hele And not for lust and vanyte.

Also it is to understand that the apostle says / The angel sathanas and of
derkaes turns often: himself. all though we see it not into angel of light.
making men deem that vices ben virtues / hidynge errors and falsnes under
color of truth / Loo what says saint gregory / This angel of the devil
otherwhile when he sees a man ocupyed in goddis service / the which he is
holden to do of debt / he makyth him to leave it / And for to think on his
sins: and for to have conscience thereof. And for to mu se thereon / and
dispute thereof in that time / under color of good thynkyng / when it ought
be do: or to fore or after. For as the wise man says / All thing has time /
And therefore each thing should be do time / his /

THe most souereyne remedy. And approuyd for to drive away such fantasy es
and conceytes of goostly temptacyons. is for to pray / And in time of prayer
to let all such thoughts to slide away / and tarry not upon hem / For
though the en mye bring that time in to thy thought. whether thou be truly
shryue as thou sholdest / and also brings the in doubt. whether thy sins
ben foryeuen the. or no. the which weren foryeue^ / and done away thorugh
very confession and contricy on long before / And though he know it to be so
some time. now is it hid from his mind / and also his good deeds by craft of
the enmye / that brings in thus to such a man's mind gastnesse and dread.
Ne he purposith not by sendyng in of such thoughts for his sin^es that his
soul should be the more clean by confession / Or by such manner of examynaco^n
and ransakyng But for to trowble it. and bring it from rest and pees / For
this angel and spyrite of pestylence desires. and wylleth always the debate
of soul. whoos deceytes and false tyzfiynges in that party / a man shall
waarly wythstonde / that is for to leave such manner consession which is
brought in to the mind by such maner^ of traueyle. For all be it that
confession be helthfull and nedfull / which is brought in through very bityng
of conscience Netheles that conferssyon is neither needful / ne spedefull. ne
profitable / which is brought in by fall se wenynge or doubt / Ne this
confession is not left in dyspite of religyon / and of holy church / But by
cause for to put away such ma ner^ temptacyon / And that thing is well done.
that is done for good meaning. All be it though it seem evil to some / For the
intent. and the menyng of things done bring fynall mede. or pain to the doer
/ Loo what christ did / when the fend bare him on hand that he was goddis
sone / And that he miyght come down fro the pynacle of the temple if he had
would. Yet came he not down in haast at his byddyng / But choos rather to come
down by the grees of virtues and dyscrecion / yeuyng us ensample y^ we should
not anon be buxum to his false entyfinge put in to us under liknes of good /
but to with stand holsomly by way of dyscre cyon / and of good dome.

Also this false spirit of error brings in otherwhyle and wrappeth y^ mind
with diverse perplex ytees. and doubtynges. with wonderful and preuy sterynges.
that he makith such one wene that thige that is leefull and good / to be
sin. and venyall sin to be dedely sin. And that he must be shriuen of all
such sins in special Not for he would that a man were clean. But for he
would trouble his soul / and disease it / And bring a man in to error of
conscience and mysdemyng. Ye in so much that he dryueth man's soul some
time more for to assente to an error / than for to meke him after dew
dyscrecyon / and good demyng. and this is heresy / Wherfor^ eueri sucht one
leave his errors after dyscre^^ counseyle / and dome of holy men. and wise: and
follow truth / And if such one say that he may not put it away / he says
not sooth / And he may wylle^ to put from him. and thn^e as for that time it is
away And by that as often as he wylneth so / as often it is away. For all be it
that error occupy his soul. yet he may have will that time to be make and
buxum / This showed the apostle when he said / Leave ye not ne trust ye not to
every spirit / but preueth and assayeth first what hem ben / In this manner
asked Josue / whether the angel was for him / or ^l^es for his enmyes / and
therefore dysc^^cyon and good dome is needful / For as said sometime a wise man.
It is need that there be a wise ruler of virtues. so that a man may rightfully
deem / between good and evil / ^^est a man under lickenes of good be begylyd
with evil / ^oo what says Aus tin de sp^u and ai^a / That is to say in the
book of man's soul. Other while he says / a good spirit / other while an
evil spirit rauyssheth a man's soul /

And of this manner of ^auys shing. we may not well wete / which it is of hem
but for the good spirit draws a man to good / and to the / And the other
begyleth him and sedyth him away ward / Ye in so much the wy^^tid spirit
rauysshith some men's souls / that it semyth to him that is thus traueyled /
that he and the spyrite which that traueyleth him were both but one /
Wherefore such one wenyth / that such unkind temptacyons / as he has / comen
oonly of himself / when they came by steryng of the wicked spirit / But it is
not to trow / ne stand to his own wit in this party / but rather obey to
truth / and dyscrete rule / For this old edd^r is both falls and slye. and
wyckid / and disceyuer of sowles / And when he may not put the mind in to
er^^ ur by such disceytes. he besieth him to make it paynfully bitter / thru^
smytyng in of a falls dread: And by pouryng in the venym of his wyckidnes /
Therefore it (...)uyth in every maner^ wise to with stand his dysceyuable
entysinges put in to man under lickenes of good thing / And suffer pacyently
and mekely the pain of bytternesse: that he puts in to a ferdefull soul /
And therefore a man shall put such myswenyng away from him / ne dwell not. ne
henge not long thereupon / But suffer pacyently. and mekely. And trust al:
way as he can and may for the time in grace and godenes of his god / For this
serpent is so subtle and so sligh that when he sees y^ he may not utterly
make a man to ^inne / while he is wakyng / he does what he may to distrouble
him with diverse yllu^io^s scornynges and fer^s when he is slepyng. Hereof says
saint Gregorye upon Job in this wise / The old enmye the devil has fered me
by swemes For this wyckid spirit is evermore awaytyng to hinder man in what he
may^ / And when he may not accombre ne overcome while he is waking / he does
all that he can the more to bring thereto s^e^ynge / And yet our good god
suffers him to do in such wise / for cause that a man's bodily sleep should
not be / idle to the soul. But rather enc^^a^inge ^ede thereto / - Aa lord in
how many ma^^r wonderful maneres and ways is man's soul tourmented and
traueyled / all be it that he love and dread his god / Herto I answer by an
^mpne of lent / where in it is wreten thus O to^tuose serpe^s qui mill per
meandros. That is to mean thus. O thou edder so often wrethen alowte / and
tornynge hyder and thither by a thousand holet^^s and halkes / thou sekyst and
castest thy qweynt* and over / thwart gy^^s for to trau^ylle / and disease

temptacyons may fall unto a righfull man's soul / and truly byleuynge /
Comfort the well in this. that the holy ghost will not leave the without his

A how py^^ous. and prouffytable / how charitable and helthful it is to
comfort. and strength the man / that is trowb^id and tormented / desolate /
and forsaken. And to ^^ed out in to refute of rest and of comfort him that
