IN perusing this little volume entitled, A mystical devise, being requested
of my friend thereunto, I did find such a pleasantnes therein, that my heart
rejoiced and gave du signs what pleasure and delight my mind of it conceived.
For surely (gentle Reder) if thou couit to hear any old bables, as I may
term them, or stale tales of Chauser, or to learn how Acteon came by his
horned head? If thy mind be fixed to any such metamorphocall toys, this book
is not apt nor fit for thy purpose. But if thou art contrary wise bent, to
hear, or to read wholesome documentes, as it becomes all Christians, then take
this same: For thou shall find it sweeter (as the Prophet says) then the
honye or the honye comb. For Solomon had great delight in the making of these,
to recreat and renyue his spirits, and called them by this name, Canticum
Canticorum, which is to say: the song of songs.

Would to God that all our rebald songs were abrogated and cast quit away, and
that we would once call to mind this sweet saying of our Lord God. (O that my
people would have harkened unto me.) Therefore let us follow the good
counsel of the Apostle, that is: To cast away the works of darkness, and
put on the Armor of light, which light is the true word of the most hiest: as
David in his Psalms writteth. Thy word is a Lantern unto my feet, and a
light unto my path. God grant that we may frame our lives according to that
light.

Vale.
Christ speaks to the Church.
COme wend unto my garden gay
my sister and my spowse:
For I have gathered Mirre with spice
and other goodly bows.
I mean to eat my honnye, and
my honny comb so sweet,
And I will drink my wine and milk
for so it seems meet.
Christ to the Apostles.
Eat now my frinds do nothing spare
but be of perfect cheer:
And drink with mirth, for you of me
are sure be loved dear.
The voice of the church.
As I lay in a slombring sleep,
but being wake in mind:
I heard my true love speak and knock
and all was me to find.
Christ to the church.
Open me the gates said he,
my sister and my love:
My darling and my hearts desire,
my only Turtle Dove.
For why, my head is full of dew,
and so are all my locks
bedecked well in comely wise
with these benighted drops.
The voice of the Spouses.
I have put off my coat, how can
I put it on again:
And if I fyle my washed feet,
then washed I them in vain.
The voice of the church. speaking of christ.
But when my love put in his hand,
then was my heart so pressed
To him that I was m^ned much,
and took but little rest.
So that I stood up by and by,
to open him the door:
But then my hands could drop
with Myrre as was not seen before.
Which Myrre ran down my fingers fast
when they were on the lock
When I was opening him the door,
that there before did knock.
But when to my beloved, I
the door had opened wide:
He was departed thence away,
and gone his ways aside.
And now as he before did speak
when I could not refrain:
So now I sought him mournfullye
but found him not again.
And then I cried after him
as one that was forsake:
And listened still, but answer none
would he unto me make.
The church complains of her Persecutors.
And then ye watchme^ that did ward
about the city there:
Found me out and wounded me,
deuoyde of any fear.
And also they that kept the walls,
like thieves did nothing spare:
To take my garment from my back,
and left me very bare.
The Spouses to her companions.
Wherefore I charge you every one,
accomplished let it be,
You daughters of Jerusalem,
that I do say to ye.
And if that you do find my love
then do express with speed,
That I am sick and very sick
for love of him in deed.
The voice of the Sinagog.
Why what is he that is thy love,
above all other lovers:
O thou which in all women's sights
art fairest of all others.
Or what can this thy love do more
than other lovers can,
That thou so straightly chargest us
for to reveal it than.
The church aunswering, of christ.
As for my love, you shall well know
is collourde white and read,
And is a person singular,
where thousands they be spread:
His head is of the glittering gold,
none fyner can be tryde:
His locks are busshed berrie brown
as is the euenyng tide.
His eyes are as the eyes of Do^^s,
that by the water brooks,
So ste^^ly seames of every one
that thereon lovely looks.
And being washed with milk so whit
it does become his grace:
Remaining in a fertile foil,
and in a plenteous place.
His cheeks are like a garden bed,
where Potticaries use
To plant each thing yt seems sweet
which they do seem to choose.
His lips do drop as do the flowers
of Myrre most principal:
His hands are decked with ryngs of gold
and precious stones withal,
His body is the Iuery pure,
with Saphiers bedighted,
His legs are marble Pillars, set
on golden sockets righted.
His face it is as Libanus,
So all they say that sees;
And eke his beauty is comparde
unto the Cedar Trees,
His throat is sweet and sweet again
what should I more express:
He altogether lovely is,
and full of comlynesse.
Lo daughters of Jerusalem,
such a one is he,
Yea such is my beloved sure,
as every man may see.
The voice of the Sinagog, speaking to the church.
Whether is thy love thou sweet
departed do declare:
For we to seek him out with thee,
do nothing mean to spare.
The voice of the Church.
My love is to his garden gone
as he has thought it meet:
For tore fresh himself among
the smelling boddes so sweet.
and there he gathers goodly flours
although he syllye is:
He is thine, and his am I
which fedeth with the Lillies.
Christ to the church.
Thou art pleasant O my love,
yea lovely art thou sure:
As fair as is Jerusalem,
whose beauty does endure.
Thou art as glorious O my love,
as I would wish to have.
And as an army is of men,
with all their Banners brave.
Turn away thine eyes from me
to make my body shrowde
For when as I do look on them,
they make me to be proud.
Thy, hearie locks are like a florke
of Goats on Galaad mount:
Thy ^^eth are like a flock of sheep
in fruit which do surmount.
And look how from yt washing place,
they go as it is seen.
And every one has their ii. twins
so art thou as I ween.
In them is no vnfruitefulnes,
not one does barren bide:
And so art thou my best beloved,
whom I love time and tide.
Thy checkes are like a piece of pure
Pomegranat very five,
beside that which there lies within
so sweet by course of line.
There are three score Queens,
and iiii. score Concubines I trow
And many youthful weomento,
as I full well do know.
But one there is that is my love,
my darling and my dear:
who of her mother is beloved.
with loving lovely cheer.
When as the daughters saw her face
they said she blessed was:
The Queens and all the Concubines,
did praise her fot to pass.
The voice of the Sinagog.
What, and is she this in deed
that peepes as Morning free:
who is as fair as is the Moon,
in every one degree.
And excellent as is the Sun
and glorious to beside.
As is an Army that displayes
their Banners time and tide.
Christ to the Sinagog.
Into the Nut garden went I,
to see what there did grow:
All by the brooks that were so brave
which bravely sure did show.
For to behold the Uinyarde, if
that it did flourish well:
And see the Pomgranats shot forth,
whose beauty did excel.
The voice of the Sinagog.
Then did the Charrets of the prince,
who was my peoples head,
make me afraid so sodeinly,
that I amazed fledd.
The Church calling again the Sinagog.
Do turn again thou Sulamite,
thou shall not turn in vain:
That we may look upon the^e well,
and therefore turn again.
The end of the v. and vi. chapters of Canticum Canticorum.
Finis.
A coppie of the Epistle that Ieremye sent unto the Jews, which were led away
Prisoners by the king of Babylon, wherein he certifyeth them of the things
which was commanded him of god.
BEcause ye have committed sin
against the myghtie God:
Ye may be certain to possess
his scourging Whip and Rod,
Nabuchodonosor the king
shall lead you captives all,
Unto the Babilonians soil,
and there remain ye shall.
Long season, yea and many days,
for God has so decreede:
That seven generations
shall there be spent in deed.
But afterward with peace and rest
from thence I will you bring:
In safety and in save guard sure,
as underneath my wing.
But yet whyist that in Babylon,
ye do as Captives bide:
There shall you see the Gods of gold
and Silver time and tide:
And eke their Gods of wood and stone
which they on shoulders bear:
Which tends unto nothing, but
the heathen for to fear.
But when you see the multitude
which gives honor due
Unto these flattering fained Gods
then do remember you
O Lord it is thy Majesty,
that ought for to have
the adoration, whereof now,
the heathen thee deprave.
This being done, my Angel shall
be with you as you are,
And I my self will surely seem,
for all your souls to care.
As for the timber of those Gods,
the Carpenter you see,
Has polyshed, and yet beside
they gaily gilted be.
Yet are they things of vanity,
and never seem to speak:
and therefore they that worship them
do my cominaundement break.
And as a wenche that paramours
does love both night and day,
Is trimly decked with golden gear
even surely so are they.
Crowns of Gold upon their heads
they daily seem to wear,
So that their priests, when they see good
do not them selves forbear,
To teke the Gold from of their gods
to be at harlots call:
And from their harlots yet again
do deck their Gods withal.
Yet cannot these same sayned Gods
preserve them selves from rust,
But they which still do worship them
must keep them clean from dust.
One has aceptar in his hand,
as he wear Judge elected,
Yet has not power to slaye yt wight
who has his hestes neglected.
Another has a sword in hand
or else an axe in deed,
Yet can he not defend himself
from battle that's decreed.
By this ye may deserne, the name
of Gods they ought not bear,
wherefore in no cas worship them,
nor seem not them to fear.
For as a vessel which we use,
when it in pieces lies:
we do account it nothing worth,
but do the same despise:
even so it is with their gorgious gods
for, why behold and see:
Through feet of men their eyes with dust
for aye encombred be.
And as the doors are shut on him
that has the king offended:
So are the doors upon their Gods,
from Robbers daily tended.
They set up candels burning still
before them light to show:
Yet can they not deserne the light;
but bide as blocks you know.
The worms that creap from out the earth
constime the^ as they stand.
Yet have not they the sense to feel
nor cannot move a hand.
Their faces are bedewed black
the Owls and Swalloes still
do fly upon them, and the Cattes
run over them at will.
By this you may perceive and see
no Gods they are reputed:
Then fear them not, for if you do,
you shall be quite confuted.
They are bedect you see with Gold
yet needs of force there must
attentive head be to them given,
to dight away their rust.
For money they are daily bought,
no life they have to show:
But on the shoulders still of men,
are carried to and fro.
Confounded are their worshippers,
because they are so vain,
That if they fall unto the ground,
They cannot rise again.
Yet note though helpers with their hands
do set them right to tread:
yet must they have there props beneth
as men that now be dead.
The priests do ^el their offered gifts
their wines thereafter live,
But to the poor and impotent
they nothing seem to give.
From whence proceeds then ye names
of Gods which they obtain,
S^^h that their priests with open mouths
do roar to them in vain.
The priests bereue the^ of their robes,
their children for to deck,
And yet these gods cannot perceue,
nor nothing do they reck.
They neither may give riches,
reward the evil spite,
And though men frustrat make their vows
yet do they not requight,
They nothing can avail the blind,
nor help a man at need,
Nor to the widows ought extend,
nor yet do good in deed.
Their idols carved forth of stone
if truth should be expressed,
Are as the other in the rocks,
that lie among the rest.
Then wherefore dare me^ call the^ gods
which are their only work,
Whereby they know that neither life
nor breath in them does lurk.
Vain therefore are all these things,
and shame it is to see,
That they behind them seem to leave
to their posterity.
For when there comes any wars,
or plagues that they possess,
their priests will hyde the^ selves with ^^e^
immagining no less,
They neither can defend them selves
from broyling battles doom,
Nor yet from no misfortune else
which seems for to come.
And kings shall well hereafter know
and plain it shall be told
That they be vain, the very work
of men upon the moulde.
They cannot set a governor
to rain within the land,
They cannot give no sentenes, when
a matter should be scande.
They are not able to compare
sure with the silly crow,
that slyes between the heaven and earth
as every man does know.
For when a fire do chance to come
where all these Gods they been:
The priests do fly, but they themselves
do burn as balkes within.
It Is better sure to be a door
to keep each thing in safety,
Then to be counted such a God,
that vain is vylde and naughty
The Sun, the Moon and al ye stars
obedient do appear:
And when yt lightning glistreth forth
then all things seems clear.
The wind does blow in every coast
he seems not to spare,
And so the clouds about the world
go when they bidden are.
These heathenish Gods may not compare
with any one of these,
Because in be wtie and in strength
they pass them all degrees.
wherefore men should not think nor Judge
that they be Gods at all.
Because they neither see nor say,
nor harken to your call,
No tokens can they surely show,
by any means in heaven,
For those that be their worshippers,
that is thimruly heathen.
The beasts deuoyde of reason quite
in sense are surely better,
For underneath the roof they wend
to keep them selnes from wether.
I like them to a frayboggarde,
where Cocumbers do grow,
which cannot keep, such be their gods,
Experience this does show.
And as a white thorn which does grow
in orchards hear and theare:
which every Bird does sit upon
and forces not to fear:
And as a carkas that is dead,
being cast into the dark:
Even so be they both dead and dum,
this every man may mark,
And as the Skarlet, which upon
them, they do use to lay,
Does not endure, but in the end
does seem to vade a way:
Even so do they them selves also,
whereby do understand,
They shall consume, and it will be
confusion of the land.
Blessed be the godly man,
which does not God deprave,
Of honor through those Images
which still the heathen have.
For far he shall be from reproof
the Holy ghost does say.
To whom with God and Christ his son
be honor every day.
The end of the Prophecy of Baruch.

Babes beware of Images
The commandments of God our Creator, given by Moses. Exodus xx.
Lift up your hearts, open your eyes
you people obstinate and ill:
To hear Gods voice you exercise,
And seek his precepts to fulfill.
I am, says he, thy God and Lord
Which from Bondage, did set thee free
Therefore see that thou do accord,
to serve no Gods but only me.
Similitude, none make thou shall,
Of any thing in heaven on hye,
Nor in the earth, thereon to call,
For such sin sharply plage will I.
The name of God, take not in vain,
Abuse it not after thy will:
For if thou do I tell thee plain,
In his wrath soon he will thee spil.
In six days God his work did end
and the seventh day did sanctify:
So thou and thine that day pretend
To serve thy Lord and God only.
To thy Parents due honor give,
as Gods precepts do thee comaunde
That ye long days and good may live
where God has plaste thee in yt land
With murder be not thou infect,
All filthy fornication fear:
With theft see thou be not detect
False witness against no man bear.
Thy neighbors house do not desire
his wife, man, maid, seek not to have
His Ox his Ass do not require,
of his seek him not to depryue.
Our sins heareby we do descrye,
wherefore forgeuenes Lord we pray
and strength our faith by grace heavenly
That we may serve the lord always.
Deuteronomy. 6.
These words which I comaund thee this day, shall be in thine heart, and thou
shall teach them thy children, and shall talk of them when thou art at home
in thine house. etc.

Deuteronomy. 12.
No man shall do that which seems good unto him self, but only that
which God comaundeth, and put nothing to it, nor take any thing from it. Apo.

Deuteronomy. 27.
Cursed are they which abides not in all that is written in the book of the
law, and do not the same.

Psalm. 19.
The law of the Lord is a perfect law, it quickens the soul. The
Testimony of the Lord is true, and geeueth wisdom even unto Babes. The
statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoices the heart. The commandments of
the Lord are pure, and geeueth light unto the eyes.

The word of the Lord endures for ever.

The commandments of Satan, put in practice daily by the Pope.
Attend my people and listen well
and hear what precepts I you give
For they are such as does excel,
The which of force you must believe.
I am your earthly God alone,
You need none other but only me
Believe this and other seek none,
For this is my will and decree.
Set up Idols abundantly,
This is my will, let this be done:
If them to ador, any deny,
Mine ire he shall feel right soon.
My name highly you shall esteem
And honor, if ye do love me:
And if Gods name you do blasphem
By me absolved you shall be.
Of workedaies, holy days I made
that thou and thine from work may cease
Observe them as before is said
and come and hear my chapleins Mass.
Father and mother do refuse
and seek the spiritual occupacion,
This is the first precept I use,
To teach among my shorlings nation.
If in whoredom or theft thou fall,
Or in any other grievous foil:
I will absolve thee of them all,
If I may have part of the spoil.
If any manset his delyght
His neighbors wife and goods to get,
For monye I will him acquit,
And free from sin I will him set.
Have not my laws a goodly grace
No man of them afentd may be:
and al those which follow their trace
Shall have their salvation with me.
This is also that which God speaks by his holy Prophet. Zacharias. 11.
I will raise up a sheparde in the land, which shall not seek after the
things that be lost, nor care for such as go astraye. He shall not heal the
wounded. He shall not norishe the thing that is whole: But he shall eat the
flesh of such as be fatt, and tear their claws in pieces.

O Idle sheperde that leaves the flock, the Sword shall come upon his arm,
and upon his right eye, his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye
shall be sore blinded.

The warnyng which S. Paul gives to the Thessalonians, how they should
learn to know Antychrist. 2. These. 2.
Let no man deceive you by any means, for the Lord comes not, except there
come a departing first, and that, that sinful man be opened, the son of
perdicion, which is an adversary, and exalts him self above all that is
called God, or that is worshipped. So that he shall sit as God, and show him
self as God.
