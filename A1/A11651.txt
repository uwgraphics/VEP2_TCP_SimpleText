ACT 1.
ANENT THE TAXATION GRANTED TO His MAJESTY of thirty shillings Tearmly upon
the pound Land, and the sixteenth penny of all Annuall-rents.
IN THE PARLIAMENT holden at Edinburgh, the twenty eighth day of June, the
year of God, 1633. THE THREE ESTATES of Parliament being assembled, having
taken to their consideration the many blessings, which this nation does enjoy
under his Majesty's most wise, happy, and peaceable government, whereof each
Estate is most sensible, his Majesty's royal zeal for propagating the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, his care for providing sufficient maintenance for the Clergy,
his extraordinary pains taken for uniting the disjoynted members of this
Commonwealth, and extirping of all roots of discords, releeving the oppressed,
and with so eaven and fatherly a hand curing the wounds of this Commonwealth,
as the wisest eye can find no blemish in the temper of all his royal actions:
And last, the great comfort they have by enjoying his Majesty's royal
presence, pains taken, and expenses disbursed by his Majesty in this his
Majesty's journey: with a most thankful acknowledgement, are most earnestly
and humbly to entreat his sacred Majesty, to accept of this their voluntary
offer of one taxation to be imposed, collected, and paid to his gracious
Majesty, in manner, and at the terms following: That is to say, The Dukes,
Marquesses, Earls, Vicounts, Lords, and Commissioners of Shires for the
temporal Estate, have granted, that there shall be uplifted of every pound
land of old extent within this Kingdom, pertaining to Dukes, Marquesses,
Earls, Vicounts, Lords, Barons, and Freeholders, and Fewers of his Majesty's
proper lands, the sum of thirty shillings money at every one of the six
several terms following: viz. The sum of thirty shillings money at the
feast and term of Martinmas, in the year of God, 1634. The sum of other
thirty shillings money at the feast and term of Martinmas, in the year of God
1635. The sum of other thirty shillings money at the feast and term of
Martinmas, in the year of God, 1636. The sum of other thirty shillings money
at the feast and term of Martinmas, in the year of God, 1637. The sum of
other thirty shillings money at the feast and term of Martinmas, in the year
of God, 1638. And the sum of other thirty shillings money at the feast and
term of Martinmas, in the year of God, 1639. AND the Archbishops and Bishops
for the spiritual Estate, have granted that there shall be uplifted of all
Archbishopricks, Bishoprics, Abbacies, Pryories, and other inferior ^enefices
within this Kingdom, at every one of the six terms above-specified, the just
taxation thereof, as they have been accustomed to be taxed unto in all time
bygone, whenever the Temporal lands of this Kingdom were stinted to thirty
shillings the pound land of old extent: And the same taxation to be paid at
every one of the six several terms above-specified. AND the Commissioners of
Burrows for their Estate have granted, that there shall be uplifted of all the
Burrows within this Kingdom, at every one of the six terms above-specified,
the just taxation thereof as they have been accustomed to be taxed unto in all
time bygone, whenever the Temporal Lands of this Kingdom were stinted to
thirty shillings the pound land of old extent. And the said Taxation to be
paid at every one of the six several terms above-written. AND in regard that
his Majesty has erected sundry Prelacies in temporal Lordships, whereby the
owners thereof may claim to be taxed with the Barons of the Temporal Estate,
and thereby his Majesty will be defrauded of a great part of the said Taxation.

THEREFORE THE SAID ESTATES ordain, that all erections of Prelacies, and other
small Benefices, in whole or in part in Temporal Lordships, shall in payment
of the said Taxation pay to the Collectour thereof so much of the same Taxation
( pro rata) as if they were no ways erected, and as they were subject to do
before the erection of the same. AND such like it is statute and ordained, that
all dissolved Benefices within this Kingdom, in whole or in part, shall be
subject in payment of so much of the same taxation ( pro rata) as they would
have been subject to pay, though the same had not been dissolved. And that
those parties, who have gotten any part or portion of any Prelacies or other
inferior Benefices dissolved, and new securities made unto them by his Majesty
of that part and portion thereof so dissolved, shall be subject in payment of
the Taxation thereof to the Prelate or other beneficed person for his relief
of the same Taxation, as they would have been, so the same had not been
dissolved, notwithstanding of any condition contained in the infeofments and
securities made by his Majesty to them in the contrary thereof.

AND FURTHER, his Majesty and the said Estates annull and discharge all
privileges and immunities whatsoever, whereby any persons may think themselves
free of payment of this present Taxation (The privileges granted to the
ordinary Lords and Senators of the College of Justice, and the taxation of
Benefices, given, disponed, and mortified for entertainment of the
Universities, Colleges, and Hospitalls within this Kingdom only excepted.)
AND further, the said Estates, for a more ample testification of their
exceeding great affection to his Majesty's service, have (beside and attour the
ordinary taxation above-written) made a free and willing offer to his Majesty
of one yearly extraordinary taxation of the sixteenth penny of all annual
rents which any person or persons within this Kingdom has freely due and
payable to them yearly or termly (Their own annual rents, wherein they are
adebted to others being first deduced): The first terms payment whereof shall
be, and begin at the Feast and term of Martinmasse, in the year of God, one
thousand six hundred thirty four years, and so forth yearly and termly at
Whitsunday, and Martinmasse for the space of six years, while the said six
years and twelve terms payment thereof be full and completely outrun.

AND for the better trial of every man his annuall-rents, which he has
yearly or termly due to him: It is ordained, that this act be published at the
Market Cross of Edinburgh, and of the whole head burrows of the Sheriffedomes,
Stewartries, bayleries, and Regalities, within this Kingdom, whereby all his
Majesty's Lieges may have true notice thereof. AND therewithal the said
Estates will, command, and ordain all his Majesty's subjects that have any
annual rents payable to them, That they compeir within the head burgh of the
Sheriffedome, Stewartrie, baylerie, or Regalitie, or the head burgh of any of
those Jurisdictions, wherein the head Courts are holden, and where the said
annual renters dwell, and have their ordinary residence in any court day in
one of the two last weeks immediately preceding, and in one of the two first
weeks immediately following Whitsunday, and Martinmasse. At which time the
Sheriffs, Stewards, Bailiffs, and Bailiffs of Regalities, and Provest, and
bailiffs of free burrows within the bounds of their Jurisdictions, shall be
obliged to hold Courts weekly, to the effect after specified. And the Lieges
resorting to the said Courts, shall give up one inventar to the Clerk thereof,
of the whole sums of money for which annual rent is due to them yearly or
termly, with the names of their debtors, designed by name and surname, and the
ordinary place of their residence. As also the whole sums of money for which
they are subject in payment of annual rents to others, with the names of their
creditors, to whom the same is due, designed likewise by name and surname, and
the place of their ordinary residence, whether the same annual rent be in
victual, or in silver: the annual of victual to be esteemed according to the
stock of money for which it is paid, at eight for ilk hundred thereof. And
shall cause the parties, up-givers of the said inventars, every party
subscribe his own inventar himself, if he can write; and if he cannot write,
the Clerk of the said Court shall subscribe the said inventar in face of the
court before the members thereof. And also the sheriffs, stewards, bailiffs,
bailiffs of regalities, provest, and bailiffs of free burrowes within the
bounds of their jurisdictions: And the clerks themselves shall make and give up
an inventar of the debts owing to themselves, and by themselves, as said is. IT
IS always provided, that if any person impedit by reason of sickness, or
distracted by some other just occasion, shall not be present himself to give
up the said inventar, It shall be lawful for him to cause any honest respons
all man within the jurisdiction where he dwells, compeir and give up his
inventar, providing the same be subscribed by himself, or any notar at his
command, which the ingiver shall declare to be one true deed, and shall abide
at the same upon the like hazard and danger, as the principal party should
underlye: which shall be als sufficient, as if the inventar had been given
personally up by the principal party himself. And an inventar being once
made and given up, shall still stand, and be a ground to charge any person,
during the time of the six years of the said taxation, unless the party
change, or otherways employ his sums: and then he shall give up a new
inventar, which shall be a new ground of a charge, and the former shall cease.
And the said Clerk shall make a Record in his Register of the said whole
inventars: which inventars being so recorded, shall be extracted by the said
Clerk, and subscribed with his hand, And three extracts made of the same; one
to be given to the party, if he require the same; another to be sent by the
said Clerk to the Collector of the same taxation; and the third to be sent by
the said Clerk, to the CLERK of His MAJESTY'S REGISTER, to be kept amongst
the Records of his Majesty's Exchequer, to the intent it may be known how far
every party is liable in payment of the said extraordinary taxation. For the
which extract and note made in Register, the said Clerk shall have of every
person, up-giver of an inventar, the sum of four shillings money. And if by
sloth or malice the Clerk shall happen to delay, or shift the Lieges,
resorting to the said courts to the effect foresaid, (complaint being made
thereof to the Lords of his Majesty's privy Council) the said Clerks shall
be punished accordingly, at the discretion of the said Lords. And at any court
day, in any of the said two weeks preceding or immediately following any
term, it shall be leasome to any person to compeir and offer to give up his
inventar (he making payment of the taxation due for the same) which the Clerk
and Judge shall be astricted to receive.

AND albeit it be declared, that an inventar once given up shall still stand,
and be a ground to charge any person during the whole terms of the said
taxation, except the same be changed in manner foresaid: Yet because sundry,
who have this liberty, delay to make payment of the taxation of their moneys
after the time be expired, THEREFORE it is provided and declared, that if they
failye to make payment of the due taxation of their moneys within twenty days
after each term, that the party so failying, shall be subject in payment of the
triple of the said taxation, for each term wherein he failyes, and letters
shall be direct against them, for payment thereof in form as effeiris.

FURTHER, for the better observation of this Act, It is declared, that
whosoever receives, retains, or conditions to receive any annual rent, and
concealeth the same, or any part thereof: Or in giving up his inventar of debts
and annuals owing by him to his just creditors, gives up more than he is
justly adebted, the up-giver thereof shall forfeit that terms annual to his
Majesty's use. AND whosoever first discovers, or reveals, either the annual
concealed, or annual which is more than the up-givers just debt; shall for his
reward have the half of that terms concealed annual, and as much as the half
of that annual which shall be discovered to have been unjustly given up. AND
in case it shall happen any person or persons whatsoever, by virtue of his
up-given inventar, to be charged for payment of his taxation, and at the time
of his charge to declare in presence of a Judge by his great oath solemnly
sworn, that his debtor is a bankrupt, whereby he is disabled to make payment
of his taxation, and is content the Kings Majesty shall have the whole
annuall-rent adebted to him by his bankrupt debtor for that term, The said
declaration shall be a sufficient liberation to him of the same: AND for
eschewing of malicious dilators of those who have omitted or concealed their
sums, IT is ordained, That whenever any person shall accuse, or dilate
another of concealing, or omitting of sums, the time of making his inventar,
he shall condescend upon some probable cause of his dilation, and shall find
caution de judicato solvi, incase he fail in proving that which he dilates.
And there shall no such actions of dilations be lawful against dead persons,
their heirs, nor executors, except what the same has been intended before
the said persons their decease. Neither shall it be lawful after year and day
after the expiring of the said taxation, to intend any such action. AND incase
any person purchase wodset of Lands, and set the same back again in tak to him
who wodset the same, The taklmen, possessors of the Lands, shall pay for the
stent of the Lands, and the haver of the wod-set shall pay for the annual-rent
of his money which he has on the Land, as if the same were employed for
annuall-rent. ATTOUR it shall not be lawful by no manner of way to any
creditor, to get relief of his debtor for this taxation which is imposed upon
annuall-rents, by this statute, under the pains contained in the Acts of
Parliament made anent Usurers. AND concerning Minors, it is declared, That
their minority shall no ways privilege them, but their tutors and curators
shall give up their inventars of their annuall-rents in their names, which if
the said tutors and curators failye to do, the said Minors shall incur the
like danger as others, and at their perfect age, shall have action of relief
against the said tutors and curators for that cause. AND incase any person
depart out of this Kingdom after the publication of this present Act, the same
shall no ways excuse him from giving up an inventar of his annuall-rents, and
payment of the said Taxation, and underlying of the danger contained in this
present Act. But they who are presently forth of this Kingdom, and shall not
return before the term of Whitsunday, in the year of God, one thousand six
hundred thirty five, they shall not come under the danger of this Act until
the term of Martinmasse thereafter, providing, that at that term, they give
up their inventars, and pay their Taxation, as if they had been present within
the Kingdom, before the foresaid term of Martinmasse: AND for uplifting of
the same Taxation, granted upon annuall-rents, and to the intent his Majesty's
general Collector thereof, may know whom to crave and charge for the same; IT
is statute and ordained, that within every Sheriffdome, Stewartrie, Baylyerie,
and regalitie, where the offices of Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bailiffs are heritable,
and the Provest and Bailiffs of free Burrowes, these heritable officers and
their deputes, for whom they shall be holden to answer, and Provest and
Bailieffs of free Burrowes, shall collect the said Taxation, and make payment
thereof to his Majesty's Collector general of his said Taxations. And where
these offices of Sheriffs, Stewarts, and Bailiffs, are not heritable but
changeable; The Clerks within the said jurisdictions (having their offices ad
vitam) shall be collectors thereof. And incase the said Clerks have not
already found sufficient caution for discharging of their offices, they shall
be holden before they have any intromission with the same Taxation, or
exercise their office of Sheriff Clerk, after the foresaid term of
Martinmasse, in the year of God, one thousand six hundred thirty four years,
to find sufficient caution for that effect. AND where there are no heritable
Officers, nor Clerks (having their offices ad vitam) and have not found caution

and his Deputes in his name sufficiently authorized by him, and for whom he
shall be holden to answer, And whose name he shall cause publish at the
Market cross of the head Burgh of that jurisdiction, where there is no

which payment being made, the receiver thereof shall be obliged to deliver to
the payer thereof an acquittance upon the receipt of the same, gratis, without
payment of any money for the same. IT IS likewise provided, that the fees of
the collectors and receivers of the same Taxation of annuall-rents, shall be,
likeas hereby they are remitted to the discretion and arbitrament of the Lords
of his Majesty's privy Council, to be let down and agreed upon by them. AND
and the said Estates hereby discern and declare, that all burgesses and
freemen within burgh, albeit they be taxed in the ordinary Taxation above
written, with their neighbors, conform to the order prescribed for collecting
of the burrowes part of the said ordinary Taxation; yet the same shall no ways
liberate nor free them from payment of their parts of the said extraordinary
Taxation, according to the proportion of the sixteenth penny of their
annuall-rents, but shall be liable in payment thereof, as others his Majesty's
Lieges are. ATTOUR the said Estates aunuall, and discharge all privileges, and
immunities whatsoever, whereby any person may think themselves free of payment
of any part of this present extraordinary Taxation, the privileges and

sustentation and upholding of Kirks and bridges, with the annuall-rent that

AT EDINBVRGH, The penult day of March, the year of God, 1630 years. The which
day in presence of the Lords of Council and Session compeered personally, sir
Thomas Hope of Craige-hall, Knight Baronet, his Majesty's Advocate, and
presented a letter directed from his sacred Majesty, whereof the tenor
follows.

REX: Right trusty, and right welbeloved Cousin and Counceller, and trusty and
welbelowed, We greet you well. Whereas by Act of Parliament made in the month
June. 1617 years, all heritable rights cled with forty years possession, are
declared to be irreduceable in all time coming, except the same be quarrelled
within the space of forty years: And by the same Act their is liberty granted
to all persons, who might be prejudged by the said prescription of forty
years already run and expired, before the date of the said Act. To intend their
actions within the space of thirteen years after theate of the said act: And
whereas we, shortly after the decease of our dearest Father, or eternal
memory, made our general revocation in the month of October, 1625 years.
Which revocation we by two special letters of declaration, one of the date at
White Hall the twenty sixth day of Januarie, 1626 years: And registrate in the
books of secret Council the ninth of February, 1626 years, And an other of
the date at Wainsteed, the eleventh of July, 1626 years: And registrate in the
books of secret Council upon the twenty one of July, 1626 years, Have
restricted to the annulling of rights of the property of the Crown, as well
annaxed as unannexed, whereof account has been made in Exchequer, and of the
principality unlawfully disponed by our Predecessors: against the laws and
Acts then standing, and to the annuling of erections and other dispositions of
whatsoever lands, teinds, partronages, and benefices formerly belonging to the
Kirk, and since annexed to the Crown. And of any other lands and benefices
mortified and devoted to pious uses: And of Regalities and heritable offices,
and of the change from the ancient holdings of ward and relief to blensh or
taxt ward, since the year of God 1540 years. And because We were unwilling to
enter in process with our Subjects anent the premises, but rather desired to
take a fair course with all such as would voluntarily treat with Us or our
Commissioners there-anent.

THEREFORE We were pleased by our Commission of the date at White Hall the
seventeenth day of January, 1627 years, to appoint certain of our Nobility,
Clergy, Gentry, Barons, and Burrowes, to be commissioners, to treat and deal
betwixt Us and our Subjects, anent the premises. And albeit the said
Commission has made a good progress in the said matter of erection and
teinds: and that a great number of our subjects, having interest therein; have
subscribed to us general submissions, whereupon We have given forth our
several determinations for the good of our Subjects, and establishing of the
perpetual quietness, and peace of that our ancient Kingdom; Yet it is
certain that many of these who have interest in erections and teinds, lie
forth, and have not subscribed the said general submissions. Like as also the
remanant points of our said Commission anent the patronage of Kirks, rights,
and infeftments of our Property, and Principality, Regalities, Heritable
offices, and Changed tenours of holding in blensh or taxt Wards, are not as yet
begun to be handled and treated, and cannot be possibly finished and closed,
before the expiring of the time and years of interruption, allowed by the said
Act. And because We will not suffer our self or our Successors to be prejudged
by delay of the execution of the said commission of the lawful actions
competent to us and them, for reducing of such rights of the premises, to the
which We have undoubted interest. And seeing a multitude cannot be commodiously
summoned and warned personally, or at their dwelling places in so short time as
is to run of the said time of prescription; Therefore and for preservation of
our rights and actions competent to us and our Successors anent the premises,
Necessary it is, that some solemn Act be done by us, to testify our will and
resolution, to prosecute our said actions in the own time, if the same be not
taken away and removed by the said commission, which we think cannot be more
properly and conveniently done, nor by inserting of this our declaration in
your Books of Session, and directing of Letters of publication thereupon,
certifying all our Lieges who have interest in the premises, by open
proclamation at the market cross of our Burgh of Edinburgh, and other places
needful, of this our pleasure, will and declaration. And that the same be
declared by you, to have the strength, force, virtue, and power of a legal and
perfect interruption; And therefore, We require you immediately after the sight
hereof, to cause insert these presents in your Books of Session: and to
declare the same to have the force of a legal and lawful interruption, and to
direct Letters of publication thereupon, in form as effeires. Which, not
doubting you will do, We bid you, farewell. From our Court at White Hall, the
twenty ninth day of November, 1629 years, with the which letter, tenor,
contents, and desire thereof, after that the same with the act of parliament
wheruno it is relative, was read in their whole presence; The said Lords being
well and ripely advised, and having considered the justice and equity of his
Majesty's will and pleasure therein contained: they have ordained and ordain
the said letter and declaration therein contained, to be insert, and registrate
in their books of Sederunt: and ordain Letters of publication to be direct
and pass thereupon, certifying all his Majesty's Lieges who have interest, by
open proclamation at the market cross of Edinburgh, and other market crosses
of the Kingdom, where the lands, Baronies, and others under written lie: or
where the persons and subjects dwell and remain, against whom the said
declaration is to have the effect of a legal interruption, in manner
following. And by open proclamation at the said market cross of Edinburgh,
Pier and shore of Leith, for all such of his Majesty's Lieges, who are forth of
this Realm, Of his Majesty's pleasure, will, and declaration, and of the said
Lords their decrete, and authority interponed thereto. Like as the said Lords
declare, That the said declaration registrate as said is, and to be published
in manner foresaid, shall have the strength, force, and power of a legal and
perfect interruption, against all persons having interest: and that in so far
alennerly as may be extended to the particulars followings: To wit, To his
Majesty's annexed property, and his Majesty's property unannexed, whereof the
fermes duties or few-fermes have been compted in his Majesty's Exchequer, since
the month of August 1455 years, and unlawfully disponed by his Majesty's
predecessors, against the acts of Parliament and laws of the Kingdom: and to
the principality unlawfully disponed by his Majesty's predecessors, against
the acts of Parliament and laws of this Kingdom: and to the reduction of
whatsoever erections of whatsoever benefices, spirituality or temporality
thereof, against the laws and acts of Parliament: and to the reduction of
whatsoever patronages of kirkes pertaining to his Majesty and his
predecessors, and unlawfully disponed by them against the acts of Parliament:
and against unlawful dispositions of whatsoever lands, teinds or rents doted
to Hospitalities, or mason-dieus, and unlawfullie disponed against the acts of
Parliament: and against Regalities and heritable offices unlawfullie disponed,
contrary the acts of Parliament: and against all changed tenors of holding
from ward to blensh or taxt ward, granted by the Kings and Princes in their
minorities, and not granted or ratified by any king or prince being major: with
this declaration, like as the said Lords declare that the same shall not
prejudge any person whatsoever of their lawful defense competent to them,
against any action to be intended hereafter, at his Majesty's instance and his
successors; except in so far as concern the said act of prescription,
whereupon the said Lords declare, that no exception shall be founded in
prejudice of his Majesty and his successors, concerning the premises.
Follows the tenor of the Act of Secret Council.

process with our Subjects anent the premises, but rather desired to take a
fair course with all such as would voluntarily treat with Us or our
commssioners there-anent:

THEREFORE We were pleased by our commission of the date at White Hall the
seventeenth day of Januarie, 1627 years; To appoint certain of our Nobility,
Clergy, Gentry, Barons, and Burrowes, to be commssioners to treat and deal
betwixt Us and our Subjects, in the premises: And albeit the said commission
has made a good progress in the said matter of erections and teinds, and that
a great number of our subjects having interest therein, have subscribed unto us
general submissions, whereupon We have given forth our several determinations
for the good of our subjects, and establishing the perpetual quietness and
peace of that our ancient Kingdom; Yet it is certain, that many of these who
have interest in erections and teinds, lie forth, and have not subscribed the
said general submissions: Like as also the remanent points of our said
commission anent the patronage of kirks, rights, infeftments of our Property
and Principality, Regalities, Heritable office, and Changed tenor of holdings
in blensh, or taxt Wards, are not as yet begun to be handled and treated, and
cannot possibly be finished and closed, before the expiring of the time and
years of the interruption allowed by the said act. And because we will not
suffer our self nor our successors to be prejudged, by delay of the execution
of the said commission, of the lawful actions competent to Us and them for
reducing such rights of the premises, unto the which we have undoubted
interest; And seeing a multitude cannot be commodiously summoned and warned
personally, and at their dwelling places, in so short time as is to run of the
said time of prescription: Therefore, and for preservation of our rights and
actions competent of Us and our successors anent the premises, necessary it
is, that some solemn Act be done by Us, to testify our will and resolution,
to prosecute our said actions in the own time, if the same be not taken away
and removed by the said commission, which we think cannot be more properly and
conveniently done, nor by inserting of that our declaration in your books of
Session, and directing of Letters of publication thereupon: certifying all our
Lieges who have interest in the premises, by open proclamation at the market
cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, of that our pleasure, and
declaration: and that the same be declared by you, to have the strength, force,
power, and virtue of a legal and perfect interruption. And therefore, We
require you immediately after the sight hereof, to cause insert these presents
in your books of Session, and to declare the same to have the force of a
legal and lawful interruption, and to direct Letters of publication
thereupon, in form as effeir is. Which not doubting you will do, We bid you
farewell. From our court, at White Hall, the twenty ninth day of November,
1629 years. With the which Letter, tenor, contents, and desire thereof, after

cross of Edinburgh, Pier and Shore of Leith, for all such of his Majesty's
subjects as are forth of this Realm, Of his Majesty's pleasure, will and
declaration, and of the said Lords their decrete and authority interponed

according to the order set down and prescribed by the Commissioners of
surrenders and teinds, or to be set down by the Commissioners appointed, or to

to be paid for the said space to his MAJESTY.
IN THE PARLIAMENT Holden at Edin burgh, upon the twenty eight day of June,
the year of God 1633. For so much as his Majesty's Lieges and good Subjects
are heavily oppressed and burdened with exorbitant annual-rents, and interest
taken for the use of money, far exceeding the rate and proportion taken in
England, France, and other neighbor countries: THEREFORE His Majesty, with
advise of the Estates, statutes and ordains, that notwithstanding of any former

ACT XXII.
ANENT THE LORDS OF SESSION, THEIR Taxation of ten shillings to be imposed upon
every pound land of old extent.
IN THE PARLIAMENT Holden at Edinburgh upon the twenty eighth of June, the
year of God, 1633. OUR SOVEREIGN Lord the Kings sacred Majesty and Estates of
Parliament presently conveened: Remembering that at the first institution of the
college of Justice, and diverse times thereafter in the Parliaments ratifying
the same, his Majesty's royal Antecessors, and Estates of the Realm then
assembled, found the erection of that honorable Consistory (which is a biding
monument of the glory of their reigns) not only to be most useful for
royal service, but also necessary and profitable for the peace of the
Kingdom, and to the seen good and comfort of all the subjects. And
considering that the provision allowed of before to the Lords of Session, was
no ways sufficient for defraying of their charges, and that through their
continual attendance, their private affairs are neglected, and great losses
thereby sustained by them.

THEREFORE, and to the effect the said Senators, and Lords of Session present
and to come, may be more encouraged to go on, and to persist as they do in
their zeal and affections to his Majesty's service, and in faithful
ministration of Justice, to the general weal of the Realm, and all the
Lieges: The said Estates with the special approbation, and gracious good
liking of the Kings sacred Majesty, have most freely condiscended, statute,
and enacted, that a taxation be presently imposed upon their lands and means,
which with his Majesty's consent foresaid, they ordain to be collected and
paid to the effect, in manner, and at the terms following, That is to say,
The Duke, Marquesses, Earls, Vicounts, Lords, and Commissioners of Shires for
the temporal Estate, have granted that there shall be up-lifted of every pound
land of old extent within this Kingdom, pertaining to Dukes, Marquesses,
Vicounts, Lords, Barons, and Freeholders, and Fewars of his Majesty's proper
lands, the sum of ten shillings money, at every one of the four terms
following, viz. The sum often shillings money at the feast and term of
Martinmasse next to come, in this instant year of God, 1633 years: the sum of
other ten shillings money, at the feast and term of Martinmasse, 1634 years
the sum of other ten shillings money, at the feast and term of Martinmasse,
1635 years: and the sum of other ten shillings money, at the feast and term
of Martinmasse, 1636 years. And the Archbishops, and Bishops for the
spiritual Estate have granted that there shall be up-lifted of all
Archbishopricks, Bishoprics, Abbacies, Pryories, and other inferior Benefices,
within this Kingdom, at every one of the four terms above-specified, the
just taxation thereof, as they have been accustomed to be taxed in all time
bygone, whenever the temporal lands of this Kingdom were stented to ten
shillings the pound land of old extent: And the same taxation to be paid at
every one of the four terms above-specified. And the Commissioners of
Burrowes for their Estate have granted, that there shall be up-lifted of all
the Burrowes within this Kingdom, at every one of the four terms
above-written, the just taxation thereof, as they have been accustomed to be
taxed unto in all time bygone, whenever the temporal lands of this Kingdom
were stented to ten shillings the pound land of old extent: And the said
taxation to be paid at every one of the said four terms above-written. And
in regard that his Majesty has erected sundry Prelacies in temporal
Lordships, whereby the owners thereof may claim to be taxed with the Barons of
the temporal Estate, whereby the said Lords of the Session would be defrauded
of a great part of the said taxation, destinate and appointed as said is.

Therefore the said Estates ordain that all erections of Prelacies, and other
small benefices, in whole or in part, in temporal Lordships, shall in payment
of the said taxation, pay to the collectors thereof, so much of the said
taxation; ( pro rata) as if they were no ways erected, and as they were
subject to do before the erection of the same. And sick like, it is statute
and ordained that all dissolved benefices within this kingdom in whole or in
part, shall be subject in payment of so much of the same taxation ( pro rata)
as they would have been subject to pay, though the same had not been
dissolved. And that the parties who have gotten any part or portion of any
Prelacies, or other inferior benefices dissolved, and new securities made unto
them by his Majesty, of that part and portion thereof so dissolved, shall be
subject in payment of the taxation thereof to the Prelate, or other beneficed
person for his relief of the same taxation, as they would have been, so the
same had not been dissolved, notwithstanding of any condition contained in the
Infeftments and securities made by his Majesty to them in the contrary thereof.
And farther, the said Estates annull and discharge all privileges and
immunities whatsoever, whereby any persons may think themselves free of
payment of this present taxation: the privileges granted to the ordinary Lords
and Senators of the College of Justice; and the taxation of the benefices
given, disponed, and mortified for intertainment of the Universities,
Colleges, and Hospitalls within this Kingdom, only excepted. Attour, our
said Sovereign Lord, and Estates foresaid, have given and granted, and by
these presents give and grant full power and authority to the said Lords of
Session, to nominate, appoint, and elect their own Collectors, one or more, as
they shall think most expedient for up-lifting of the foresaid taxation, to
the effect foresaid. Which sums of money, after they shall be in-gathered, as
is before appointed; Our Sovereign Lord, and the Estates foresaid destinate
and ordain to be mortified by employment upon land heritably, or for
annual-rent, or other sufficient security, as may conveniently be found, for
the use and benefit of the said ordinary Lords of Session, present, and to
come: To the effect, that the yearly profit and annual of the said lands or
moneys, (as the same shall happen to be employed) may be received by them and
their successors in their said offices, yearly and termely, after the terms
of payment of the same, and applied to their behove, in manner, and conform to
the consuetude of the division of the yearly duty, presently allowed and
received by them: and that by and attour the present provision and rents
allotted to them by Parliaments heretofore. And to that effect, the said
ordinary Lords of Session, shall with all convenient diligence make, subscribe,
and deliver to his Majesty's Thesaurer principal and deputy, a sufficient and
valide security by band or contract, made by the sight and advice of his
Majesty's Advocate, for employing of the said taxation, and whole benefit
thereof, in whole or in part, as the same shall be up-lifted to the use and
effect above-specified. And ordain the particular form and manner of
up-lifting and in-gathering of the said taxation, and relief of the Prelates,
Lord of erections, and other beneficed persons, to be conform to his Majesty's
own taxation, granted in this present Parliament in all points, except in so
far as concerns the particular day to be appointed to the Vassals, for
conveening with the Prelates, Lords of erections, and other beneficed persons,
for appointing and setting down of their due and right proportions of the said
taxations, which they ordain to be upon the seventeenth day of September next
to come, which is declared to be the precise day of meeting, to the effect
foresaid; And that no farther citation, nor summoning shall be requisite to
that effect, than the publication and proclamation of this present Act, at the
market Crosses of the head Burrowes of this Realm, and holds the whole
remnant clauses, and provisions of the Act of relief of his Majesty's
taxations, as here repeated. And ordaines letters to be direct hereupon.

before the Lords of his Majesty's privy Council, that such order may be
taken with the said rebels, as the said Lords shall think expedient. And
farther, our said Sovereign Lord declares, that if any of his Highness good
subjects shall happen in intaking of the said rebels, to hurt, mutilate or slay
