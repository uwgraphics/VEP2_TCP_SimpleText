A compendious form and sum of Christian doctrine, called the Testimony of a
true Faith, meet for well disposed families, for the more knowledge in God,
and better nourishing up, and confirming of all such, as love salvation in
Jesus Christ.

Gathered, corrected, and newly augmented, by Christopher Shut, Master of
Art, Seen and allowed.

Psalm. 34.11. Come ye children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of
the Lord.

Imprinted at London by Thomas Dawson, dwelling at the three Cranes in the
Vinetree. 1579.

To the right Honorable, and his singular good Lord, George, Earl of
Cumberland etc. Christopher Shut wishes all increase of grace in the holy
Ghost, and long continuance of life in all happy health and prosperity.
AFter that I called to mind (Right Honorable, 1. Re. 2.1. Pro. 4.1. 2. Re.
23.1.
and my very good Lord) the diligent care, and prudent provision, which David
and other good Princes and rulers of Israel had, for planting true religion in
their Families, for their better conversation and good government, according
to the law and rule of faith: and had been also often entreated and earnestly
invited by some, my very friends, and such as love the salvation of the
faithful, to contract some compendious and Christian form of godly
instructions and sweet prayers much requisite in well disposed families, whose
godly demand I was not willing to deny, 1. Luc. 214.
both because I see the lack thereof in many families, to require so
needful a labor, and also, because I would not abridge my duty to my
brethren and fellowship of the faithful, if it were but, with the poor
widow, to cast two mites into the treasury: And waying also with my self,
how many busy brains are occupied, to quarrel without a cause with truth
it self. I thought your honors Godly Patronage to be a sure asyle, to
support and defend against the sting of carping Zoilus, whatsoever in godly
wise herein I should propound. And therefore I have boldly presumed too rest
upon your Honors hoped protection, as the chiefest anchore hold I had
herein, and take effect, to the end my labors might the better proceed.
Whereto (my good Lord) I was diversely incensed. First by your Honors good
liking and procuration of good litterature from time to time which, never
happened to any without deserved praise and just commendation.

Secondly, I was moved by your Honors good acceptance of my studies in the
Lord, and other good remembraunces toward me, both of your honor, unto
whom I recount my self most deeply indebted, and also of my good and most
virtuous Lady, whom the Lord has joined, as a most comfortable delight and
help, unto your honor. Whose faithful society and happy fellowship,
imports an evident argument of Gods great goodness toward you, in
blessing you with the fellowship of such a one, as few or none excel or go
beyond in true godliness, honesty, and virtue. To whom for her Honors good
affection to Christian religion, I recognize my self much bound with all
obedience.

Thirdly, I was provoked hereunto, specially, because such is and ought to be
the zeal and love of all nobility, (whereof your honor is a most towwarde
Branch) always with maine and might, to defend the cause of true Religion to
the glory of God, and salvation of his people, for which cause the Lord has
stirred up most noble men and godly Magistrates, to be as Patrones, and
protectoures to the Ambassadoures of his word, for the better proceeding of
religion. So he raised up Moses to Aaron, Joshua to Eleazar, David to Nathan,
Asa too Azariah, Iehosaphat to Micha, Ezechias and others to Esaie and Jeremy,
Zerubbabel to Iehoshua, and finally, the Emperor Constantine to the council
of Nice. All which were rightly termed Nobles, for the zeal and love they had
to true religion. And albeit, by sinister and crooked means some were
ennobled, and so crept into the careful chair of worldly dignity, yet none
were ever rightly and in very deed accounted noble, but such as undertook
the patronage and aid of Christian religion, which thing I humbly crave upon
your Honor. For even in this wise, Deuteronomy. 4.4.
Moses does call the Israelites a precious and a noble generation, so long as
they observed the commandments of the Lord. Upon the like condition, Psalm.
89. and. 132.
the Lord established his mercies with king David his Servant: that the throne
of Judah should not be destitute of one to reign upon the same for ever. 1.
Reg. 2.1.
To which thing David had respect, when he lay upon his death bed, and
thereupon councelled Solomon his son, (to whom the kingdom was promised,) to
walk in the way of truth, wherein he had been brought up: to the end he might
prosper and have good success. Fox Page 125
To like purpose, Romanus a man of great nobility, being carried to the place
of martirdom for the profession of Christian religion, (a rare thing in Nobles
to behold) boldly avouched, that his nobility rested not so much in the
blood of his Auncestoures, as in the profession of the Christian faith, and
other virtues thereto agreeing. And therefore he said, Non progenitorum
sanguis, sed Christianae pietatis professio me nobilem facit, that is, Not the
blood of my progenitoures, but the profession of Christian religion, makes me
noble and renowned. Romans 11.17.
And in deed if we should with a single eye, look to the Prosapie of Adam,
Ephesians. 2.23.
and wild olive tree, out of the which all flesh was taken, there would be no
great cause of triumph to any, of any thing which we have of nature: To.
6.5. and. 8.15 16.
But this is and ought to be manns chief nobility, that he is graffed in
Christ Jesus by faith, adopted to be the child of God, made by faith pertaker
of his graces, Theodorit. lib. 5. ca. 17.
and fellow heir of his kingdom, and this is very nobility. Wherewith Saint
Ambrose being moved, advertised the Emperor Theodosius (and in him all
nobility) to consider his nature to be frail, least happily principallitie
should blind him, and make him quite forget himself, and his obedience
toward God.

Whereupon, it may be gathered (right honorable) that not only the Potentates
of al sorts, ought well to remember their calling, but specially, to address
them selves in all obedience, to serve the Lord, to foster his church, to
promote and defend his true religion: For therefore are they called to
nobility, Psalm. 2.11. Isa. 49.23.
wherein, I would to God it might well please even all degrees of such as be
exalted on high and gouernoures of families, deeply to acknowledge and
confess, that the Lord has made them Fathers for his truth, Patrones to
maintain religion, and lights of godly life for others to follow. For, like
as the son in the firmament, Plato.
gives light to all the regions round about him, and by his bright appearing
expels the darkness, comfort and cheereth the world: Semblably,
should nobility banish sin and corrupt religion, and be a lantern of Godly
life to comfort and shine to others, that they might direct their lives
after their good ensamples, Phillip 2.15.
as the Apostle wishes the godly to be without rebuke, in the midst of a
naughty and crooked generation, among whom they should shine as lights in the
world. For as the Philosopher Plato says, such as the Heads and Rulers be,
such commonly be the rest of the common multitude. Isocrates
Upon the which consideration the Athenians Orator Isocrates wishes all men
of nobility, to propose their lives, as a pattern for others, to follow,
knowing, that the manners of a whole town or country do resemble the ways
and dooinges of the higher sort. Lib. 3. Ca. 1.
To the like end says Enagrius in the ecclesiastical histories. that the
life of a noble man should be an image of virtue, for his subjects to follow,
Contra Donaristas.
that they might the sooner be allured to virtue and godliness. Thus Saint
Augustine says, that rulers ought to serve GOD, not only in living godly
and modestly themselves, but also in bringing others to virtue and true
Religion. Thus it was said to Arcadius the Emperor, that godliness was
sufficient to the salvation of the noble men, without the which their Pomp
and outward strength was nothing worth. Whereupon (my very good and
virtuous Lord) I may conclude and define with Sozomenus, Sozo. lib. 9. Cap. 1.
that godliness or love of true Religion, Lib. 1. Ca. 1.
is the greatest honor and renown of true nobility. And therefore as
Constantine said sometimes to Sapors king of Persia, Theodorit. lib. 1. Ca. 25.
so say I to all such of high degrees, which fear the Lord: like as in
keeping of the sacred faith, they are pertakers of the light of truth: so in
following the light of truth, as a guide, they attain straight to the sacred
faith: which thing may well inkindle in the loving and zealous hearts of noble
men and all others a fervent mind, to the embracing and spreading abroad of
true religion. Niceph. lib. 4. Ca. 34.
And even as Cyprian let no day pass, without the reading of Tertulian: nor
Alexander without the reading of Homer: nor finally, Apelles without some line
proportioned: so were it meet that no degrees, should lose any opportunity
or occasion granted to the meditation of Christian religion: but rather being
taught by the example of the Emperor Constantine, would repose their whole
study in the word of God And as for other things in the world, they are but
vanity and vexation of spirit. For all flesh is grass, Eccle. 1. Isa. 40.6.
and all the glory of man is as the flower of the field, which stands
beautiful to day, but tomorow is cut down, dried up, and withered. And what
harm were it then, if some good man would put all degrees in mind, as the
Macedonian did Phillip, 1. John. 2.16.
and say: remember man, that thou art but mortal, and that nothing is in the
world, but the lust of the flesh, 1. Cor. 7.31. 2. Cor. 5.10.
the lust of the eyes and pride of life, and that the figure of this world
vadeth fast away, that we must also all appear before the tribunal seat of
God, that every one may render an account for that which he has do ne in the
body, be it good or evil. Were it not a means, to make every one more
watchefull in his office? wherein than ought man's delight to be? surely as the
Prophet says: Let not the wiseman glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man
in his strength, Iere. 9.23.
nor the rich man in his riches: but let him that rejoices, rejoice in this,
that he understands and knows me: For I am the Lord, which show mercy,
judgment, Eccle. 11.9.10. and. 12.2.
and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the
Lord. To the like purpose, is the good and wholesome counsel of the Preacher,
Rejoice (O young men) says he, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee,
in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the
sight of thine eyes, but know that for all these things, God will bring thee
to judgment: therefore take away grief out of thine heart, and cause evil,
to depart from thy flesh: for childehoode and youth are vanity. Remember now
thy Creator in the days of thy youth, whiles the evil days come not, nor the
years approach, wherein thou shall say, I have no pleasure in them. O would
to God that this godly counsel might prevail in princely and noble hearts,
and in every high and low degree, and especially in heads of housholdes,
which best becomes their personages: Than would they enquire after the
Lord, and make his truth, their chief delight, and lay a sure foundation in
the way of righteousness, than should this be their joy and triumph: To
know the Lord to be their GOD, and themselves to be his people, and to have
the testimony of a good conscience. Than should they make answer to their
obedience rightly to the word of GOD, 2. Cor. 12.
than should they do the duties of faithful and loyal subjects, and
satisfy her Majesty's desire. Finally, than would they tender the state of
Church and common weal, and show themselves careful for the salvation of
Israel.

And because there is no good beginning for the accomplishing of these things,
but in the wisdom, fear, and knowledge of the Lord, the seed whereof is
sown in your honors heart, to my great comfort and happy hope of help,
that your honor will set forward and maintain the truth of Jesus Christ in
this poor country, and Labirinth of ignorance and sin, I here most humbly
commend unto your honors godly zeal, a short form of Christian Religion,
and godly government, most meet in well disposed families to be observed.
Wherein is to be scene the sum of Christian doctrine, faith, and godly
prayers, most meet for this our present estate: beseeching your good Honor,
in lieu of better, to accept the same in good part, at my willing hands,
recognizing my self much bounden unto your Honor, with all obedience for
ever. And therefore knowing the knowledge of true Religion, to be the delight
and comfort of the godly, Psla. 119.24.105. To. 10.8. Isa. 11.4. John. 1027.
2. Cor. 2.16
the light unto their paths, the doctrine of faith unto salvation, the scepter
and protection of Gods kingdom, the mark and badge of Gods Elect, and savor
unto life, I here do present, the sum thereof unto your Lordship, in token of
a thankful remembrance of your Honors courtesy toward me, and in hope
of favorable acceptance thereof, Wishing no less unto your Lordeship, then
increase of all heavenly graces and perfect happiness through the mediation of
the Lord Jesus: in whom I bid your Honor most heartily fare well.

Your good Honors most humble to command C. Shut.

The Testimony of a true faith, containing short questions very necessary to
all Families for the more knowledge of God, and better bringing up of children
in his faith and fear.
1. Question.
For So Much as our Savior Christ in the Gospel admonishes his elect, Matthew.
6.33.
first to seek the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, and thereto
adioyneth the promise of other, blessings to ensewe: I would gladly understand,
how the same might be performed, which he requires so necessarily.

Answer.
There is no way so expedient to the atteyning of Gods heavenly graces, as to
lay a good foundation of true religion in the fear of God. Forasmuch as Deuteronomy.
28. toto Psalm. 1.2.3.13.^.15.22.
obedience to the Law of God, is he readiest and only way, to the fountain
of all perfect happiness. And for this cause Deuteronomy. 6.6. 2. Sam. 6.11 Reg. 2.3.
Act. 4.23. Luke. 19.9.
the godly men of all ages, provided always from time to time, that they might
nourish true religion in their Families, to the end, both they and theirs might
be instructed better in the Law of God, and have good success in those
things which they went about.

2. Question.
Do thou than think, that those housholdes are disordered, and not rightly
ruled, where there is no daily meditation of religion kept?

Answer.
Such Families may rather be accounted a sincke of sin, where the people are
careful of worldy profits and vain delight, and careless of the word of God,
and true religion. 1. Sam. 2.25.
And therefore they arein this case often times nearer to destruction.

3. Question.
How do thou order and govern thy house in Christian religion.

Answer.
Deu. 6.6
As Moses commanded the people of Israel, to teach their children the Law of
the Lord, that in all their affairs they might have an eye unto the same: so
am I careful, that my whole Family fear God and know his word by some daily
exercise, and meditation thereof. So as 1. Pet. 3.15.
they may be the better able to render a reason of their faith. Act. 4.23.
They pray and give thanks together in all their doings. Tit. 2.12.
They live godlily, soberly and righteously. Luke. 19.9
They make restitution, to whom they have done wrong. And finally whatsoever
they do, they do all to the glory of God, Ios. 1.8.
and so they prosper, to God be praise therefore.

4. Question.
Well than I pray thee show me the sum of that religion, which thou do
keep in thy Family? For it is the duty of a true Christian, always to be
ready 1. Pet. 3.15.
to render an account of his faith, to the end it may appear, that he is not
Mat. 10.32. Romans 10.10.
ashamed of Christ and his doctrine. Let me therefore hear what thou can say
of the principal points of Christian Religion.

Answer.
There be three special parts thereof, the first is John. 17.3. 2. Cor. 13.5.
to know God and my elfe: the second is, Ioh. 5.24.
the means whereby my salvation is wrought: the third, Mat. 6.9. and 26.26.
what helps God does further me withal unto life everlasting.

5. Question.
What say thou of the knowledge of God?

Answer.
The same is of two sorts: the one is universal, and known Romans 1.19. Psalm.
19.1.
by the creation of heaven and earth, wherein God offers himself to be seen
and known of me, as the only fountain of all goodness, who alone Deuteronomy. 6.13.
ought to be worshipped. For his Genesis 1.1. Act. 17.24.
eternity appears in the making of the world: his Psalm. 36.
goodness in preserving the same: his Psalm. 107. Act. 17.28. Psalm. 115.3.
providence in the tokens which are seen and felt, whereby what pleases his
godly will comes to pass, and not by blind fortune: his Psalm. 104.24
wisdom in ordering of the things created: his Romans 2.7.8.9.10.
righteousness in delivering the godly, and punishing the wicked: his Ezec.
18.32
mercy in patiently forbearing sinners, and calling them to repentance. So that
what may be known of God, is manifest in the things created, which universal
knowledge takes away Romans 1.20.
all excuse from the ungodly, which woorship not God aright: but to me, it is a
Psalm. 19.1.
ready way to bring me to the true worship of God.

The other knowledge is special, and only proper Ioh. 17.3. Iere. 31.34.
to the elect, whereby, through faith poured into my heart by the holy Ghost, I
am assured that my salvation is wrought by Christ the son of God: by whom
Romans 8.16.
I am made the child of God through grace, and heir with Christ of his
kingdom: which knowledge only comes of Luke. 10.21
grace, and so is given to me, but it is restrained from the wicked, because of
their Math. 13.14
sin and hardenesse of heart.

6. Question.
What say thou of the knowledge of thy self?

Answer.
By creation I was made in Adam, according to the Gene. 2.27.
Image of GOD (I mean not any bodily shape, for God is a John. 4.24.
spirit, and without body) in true righteousness and holiness, Ephe. 4.24.
that is to say, in all perfection and happiness of nature, both in right
judgment, reason, will and strength. In which happy state, if Adam had
continued, both I and all his posterity had been blessed for ever.

7. Question.
How did thou fall from this grace.

Answer.
My fall appears, in that Gene. 3. toto.
Adam who had this blessing for me, through the intisement of the Serpent brake
the commandment of God, in eating of the forbidden fruit, and by the same
deprived himself of his former happiness, and brought sin, death, hell, the
wrath of God, and all kind of miseries into the world, Romans 5.12.
as just punishments for his deserts. In which his sinful act, his pride,
disobedience, lack of faith, unthankfulness to his creator, and light
credit to the Devil appeared. In which offense, both I and al his ofspringe
are wrapped, in as much as in him we all have sinned, for he had the blessing
given to keep or loose for him and his. Wherefore I and all others descending
of him, by him, and in him, have fallen from grace, and are infected with his
corruptions, Psalm. 51.5.
conceived in sin, borne in iniquity, and Ephesians. 2.3.
by nature the children of wrath, Romans 3.10.
and utterly undone, without the grace and mercy of God.

8. Question.
What is man's free will, his power, strength, wisdom, and such like virtues
lost by this his fall in Adam, all which he had in the beginning?

Answer.
Concerning man's will, before his fall the same was free, but afterward not so,
John. 8.36.
but as the same is freed by grace. For Psalm. 14.2.3
his judgment is imperfect and often deceived, his will in many things
hindered, and his strength decayed, John. 3.5. and 15.4. 2. Cor. 3.5. Phillip.
1.6. and. 2.13.
that of himself, he cannot perceive the things which belong to the kingdom
of God. So that as now to will aright is the gift of grace, so, to will and
chose amiss, is the lack of grace: And yet this will of man not regenerate,
in some respect may be termed free, because Eccle. 13.9.
a man does evil by his own consent, and not by compulsion. And as for other
his virtues and good gifts, which he had before his fall, like as in a ruinous
house, there remain certaines relics of an house, although nothing
comparable to their former excellency: so after Adams fall, man not egenerate
Isa. 29.4. 1. Cor. 1.19. To. 8.7. and. 10.3.
has a certain kind of wisdom, carnal knowledge, show of religion and
holiness, and yet the same so imperfect, both by his natural corruption, and by
the tyranny of the Devil, that John. 3.5.
till he be regenerate and sanctified with grace from above, he can not
please God.

9. Question.
How art thou restored to grace again?

Answer.
My restoration comes through Tit. 3.5. Ephe. 2.4.
the free mercy and favor of God, who after this my fall in Adam, raised both
him and me up again with the comfortable Genes. 3.15 and. 12.2. and. 22 18.
promise of a Savior, who by his Romans 3.25. Col. 1.22. 2. Cor. 5.21.
death should pacify the wrath of God, and bring me into his favor again:
Romans 5.19
by whose obedience I am made righteous: which my regeneration comes thus to
me, whilst Matthew. 3.2. Luke. 24.47.
by the preaching of the Law, I am brought to the feeeling of my sins, and
raised up with the comfortable promises of the Gospel, Act. 15.9. 1. Cor. 3.16.
received by faith. My heart is lightened, purified, and governed by the holy
Ghost: Ephe. 4.24
my will and mind reformed, and the Image of God renewed again in me.

10. Question,
Why did God regenerate thee, and not raither get him self glory, by
condemning thee according to thy sins.

Answer.
Although the Lord Romans 3.10. and 9. toto. Deuteronomy. 7.8. Ezech. 36.22. Ioh.
15.16. Ephe. 2.4. 2. Tit. 1.9. Tit. 3.5
might justly have condemned all Adams posterity, by reason of their sins,
yet notwithstanding some of them according to his just judgments, he leaves
in their own corruption, deuoid of all grace, and Vessels of his wrath unto
damnation: Othersome he embraces in his great love unto salvation, whom he
accepts in mercy without any deserts of their own. Of which number, my
conscience does persuade me that I am one. And therefore he has regenerate
me, Ephesians. 14.5. 1. Pet. 1.3. John. 3.16. Romans 8.29.30.
first to declare his great love, mercy and everlasting kindness toward me,
whom he chose in his son Christ to salvation. And therefore in an happy
time, he has called me by the preaching of his word, and justified me by my
only faith in Christ's death: Matthew. 5.16. Romans 6. toto. Ephesians. 2.10. 2. Pet.
1.10.
Secondly, that I being thus borne anewe, may bring forth the fruits of
righteousness to glorify him withal. 1 Pet. 1.3.4. Act. 26.18. Romans 6.22.
Thirdly, that all the end of my regeneration is life everlasting: so at the
Lords good time, I may receive the same among his Saints.

11. Question.
Show me what be the means, whereby thy salvation is wrought?

Answer.
The ordinary means commonly are two, that is to say, Luke 24.47. Romans 10.17.
the word of God, and faith.

12. Question.
What is the word of God?

Answer.
It is those Canonical scriptures 2. Tim. 3.16 2. Pet. 1.21.
written by the spirit of God, and commended to man both in the old and new
Testament, wherein are contained Deuteronomy. 4.2. and 12.32. Galat. 1.8. Luke. 16.29.
all things necessary to our salvation, according to the which, the Lord will
have all his religion measured, without either adding or diminishing.

13 Question.
How can thou know the true religion, in so many sundry opinions of the
same, as be in the world?

Answer.
Act. 17.11.
First, I try the religion taught me by the word of God, and by his spirit
given me to understand the same. John. 5.39.
Secondly, 1. John. 4.1.2.
I know this spirit to be a right spirit, because it confesses Christ to be
come in the flesh, that is to say, ascribes the whole work of my salvation
to him, and to no other thing. Thirdly, Romans 3.31.
I expound one place of Scripture, as it is not contrary to another. And thus
I try the truth, John. 12.48.
making the word of GOD to judge and determine what I ought to follow.

14. Question.
What is the cause why the word of God is preached to many, and yet takes
place but in few?

Answer.
The causes are many, To. 10.16. and 11.7.
first manns own disobedience and contempt of the word, through want of faith,

2. Cor. 4.4.
Secondly, the malice of Satan, who blinds and hardens the hearts of the
unfaithful, that they should not see and believe the truth.

2 These. 2.11. Romans 1.14. Apoc. 13.8. and. 14.9.
Thirdly, the just judgment of God: Who, because they refuse to receive and
believe the truth, does give them up into a reprobate mind, and sends strong
delusion among them, that as they do delight in lies and m unrighteousness,
so the same may be their destruction.

15. Question.
How is the word of GOD divided?

Answer.
Into the Mat 3.2. Luke. 24.47.
Law and the Gospel.

16. Question.
What is the Law.?

Answer.
It is the ten commandments of God, requiring of every one Deuteronomy. 27.26.
most pure perfect, and perpetual obedience, Leuit. 18.5. Romans 10.5. Mat.
19.17.
promising salvation to them which fulfill the same, threatening death and
damnation to the transgressors thereof.

17. Question.
Rehearse the same to me.

Answer.
1 Exodus 20.
Thou shall have none other Gods but me.

2 Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under
the earth: thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them, for I the Lord
thy God am a ielous God, and visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thousands in them that love me, and keep my commandments.

3 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord
will not hold him guilteles, that takes his name in vain:

4 Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day: six days shall thou labor
and do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy GOD, in it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son,
and thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid servant, thy cattle, and the
stranger within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the
Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

5 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land,
which the Lord thy God gives thee.

6 Thou shall not kill.

7 Thou shall not commit adultery.

8 Thou shall not steal.

9 Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

10 Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shalt not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass,
nor any thing that is his.

18. Question.
What say thou of the first commandment?

Answer.
The Lord therein requires 1. Sa. 15.22. Deuteronomy. 10.12.
true obedience to his word, the fear and love of his name, John. 3.15.16.
a sure faith and trust in his promises, Psalm. 50.15. and 23.
the right invocation upon his name, with thankesgeuing for his benefits,
whereby his true worship may be known aright: which things as he does
command, so does he forbid Deuteronomy. 4.15.
all manner of superstition and idolatry, 2. These. 1.8. 2. Tim. 4.4.
the contempt and denial of his word, Romans 3.18. Jacob. 2.14. 1. John. 3.10.
the lack of fear, faith and love toward him, Apo. 13.6. and 19.10. and.
22.9.
calling upon other creatures, and finally, whatsoever polluteth his service,
or our consciences in whose presence all our doings do appear.

19. Question.
What say thou of the second? Thou shall not make. etc.

Answer.
God does therein declare how he will be worshipped. For seeing that his true
worship Deuteronomy. 6.13. Romans 14.23 Matthew. 5.16.

to his glory; as he is a John. 4.24.
spirit, so he will be woorshiped in spirit and truth, without Leuit. 18.3

the making of Images, to express him by Exodus 34.14. Psalm. 97.7.
all manner devotion or reverence giving to them, either in looking at them, or
in bowing the knee before them in prayer: he is the Lord our God, and will not
have his power to be contemned: Exodus 34.14 1. Cor. 11.2.
he is ielous over us, and will not suffer either our souls or bodies to be
defiled with any filthiness of Idolatry: which if we do, he will reuenenge
the same to the third and fourth generation. Briefly he forbids hereby Deuteronomy.
12.2.
all representations and tokens of Idolatry, Esaias. 29.13.
all strange worship devised by man, Apoc. 13.15 and 14.9, and 18 4.
all antichristian Decrees and whatsoever corrupts the true service and
spiritual woorship of God.

Answer.
The Lord commands not only 1. Cor. 6.15 1. These. 4.4
perfect chastity both in soul and body, whether it be in marriage or in
single life, that all our parties may be sanctified unto him: but also he
forbids Galat. 5.20 Apoc. 21.8.
all manner of adultery and fornication, 1. Tim. 4.3 Eccles. 5.5
the restraining of lawful marriage in any calling, and the rash vowing of
single life, Math. 5.28. Rom 6.12. and 7.7.
vnlawfulll lusts, Esaias. 3.16. 1. Ti. 2.9 1. Pet. 3.5.
light behavior, and unseemly adorning of the body, Ephe. 4.29. and.54.

26. Question.
Declare the eight, Thou shall not steal.

Answer.
Herein God commands Psalm. 15.2. Tit. 2.12. Romans 13.8
righteousness and true dealing in every calling, and that every man be
content with his own state, giving to every one what of right he ought to
have: forbidding also Ephe. 4.28. 1. These. 4.6.
all robbing and falsehoode, Luke. 12.15 Psalm. 15.5. Prouer. 11.1.
couetuousnesse, usury, oppression, bying and selling with false measures, 2.
These. 3.10
idle living, Luke. 15.13.
dishonest wasting of goods or substance, and what else does sauoure of
deceit, the same is stealing.

27. Question.
Show the sense and meaning of the neinth? Thou shall not bear false
witness, etc.

Answer.
God commands herein, Ephesians. 4.25. Isai. 33.15.
in court and judgment, and in all our words and couenantes, that truth may
florishe, to save our neighbors harmless, Deuteronomy. 1.16. Isai. 10.15.
forbidding wrong judgment, or any respect of persons therein, the making of
wicked laws and decrees, also Deuteronomy. 19.16. Ephesians. 4.25. 1. Cor. 13. toto.
false witness, and lying tales, flattery, suspicions, false accusations, and
whatsoever impaireth the good name of our brethren.

28. Question.
What say thou of the last, Thou shall not covet etc?

Answer.
In this the Lord commands Deuteronomy. 6.5. Matthew. 22.37. Luke. 10.27.
the whole heart to be possessed with love, that whatsoever man does wish or
desire, may be free from lust and corrupt affections, and serve to the glory
of God, and profit of his neighbors, forbidding hereby Genes. 6.5. Matthew.
5.28. Romans 6.12.
all wicked thoughts and unlawful desires both of soul and body, although
our consent be not thereto, Ephe. 2.24.
all corruption of original sin by Adam, all lack of grace, and whatsoever
wants of the integrity and perfection wherein man was made. By all which
precepts, it may appear, that Job. 15.14. Deuteronomy. 27.26. Leuit. 18.5. Luke.
17.10.
nothing but true righteousness and innocence can please God.

29. Question.
By this I understand, that thou art not able of thy self, Rom 8.3.
because of thy sins, to fulfill these laws: why therefore did God command
that, which thou can not do?

Answer.
First, hereby he declares how that his image in me Ephesians. 4 23.24.
is corrupted with sin, for nothing is here required, which I could not have
done before my fall in Adam.

Secondly, Deuteronomy. 27.26
here is nothing commanded which I am not bound to do.

Thirdly, Deuteronomy. 6.25.
he does not respect what I of my self can do, but what his justice does
require. Last of all, it sets forth the Romans 4.15. and.7.7.
wrath of God, and brings me to the feeling of my sins.

30. Question.
Why, God is merciful to thousands, and will not surely punish sin so
sharply, as thou think.

Answer
Exodus 20.6.
God in deed is merciful to them that love him, and truly repent, but he is a
psalm. 7.6. and. 11.7. Deuteronomy. 32.35.
just judge, and a God of vengeance, to punish the wickedness of the ungodly,
which break his commandments.

31. Question.
By this I gather, that many are in a woeful case.

Answer.
Concerning the wicked, which be void of faith and of the mercy of God, 1.
Tit. 1.9 Deuteronomy. 27.26
the curse of the Law hangs upon them: But touching the elect, of which
company I am persuaded that I am one, John. 3.16 2. Cor. 5.21. Romans 3.25
Jesus Christ the son of God in mine own nature has suffered, to deliver me
from sin, and the punishments thereof, and has brought me into favor of
God again, of which benefit I lay hold Romans 1.16 Act. 15.11
with a true faith, Romans 10.17
which comes by the preaching of the Gospel.

32. Question.
What is the Gospel?

Answer.
It is the Romans 10.8
doctrine of faith, Math. 11.28 John. 5.24.
containing the promises of God unto salvation, Luke. 24.47. John. 3.15. and
6.47.
to all which truly repent, and lay hold of Christ's merits, by a sure trust
in the same.

33 Question.
Why call thou the Gospel the doctrine of faith?

Answer.
First because Romans 10.17.
faith comes, and is nourished by the preaching of the Gospel: Secondly John.
3.16
because the promises thereof, must be received only by faith.

34. Question.
What do the promises of the Gospel mean:

Answer.
First they teach me that the Law of God is fulfilled for me by Christ, Romans
5.19. Ephe. 2.15 Galat. 3.13.
by who^ I have my sins forgiven, and with 1. Cor. 1.30 2. Cor. 5.21.
whose righteousness I am clothed, and may now boldly stand before the
judgment seat of God.

Secondly that my salvation Romans 3.24. and.4.5.16.
comes only of the free mercy of God, without my merits or good deeds.

Thirdly Matt. 22.14.
although they be offered to all, yet they take effect in none to salvation, but
only in the elect, whose hearts GOD lighteneth with faith.

35. Question.
Show me what faith is.

Answer.
There is a kind of faith, called James. 2.14. Act. 8.13.
a dead faith, believing the word of God to be true, and all things therein
contained, and goes no farther: but the true faith is John. 17.3.
the sure knowledge of the fatherly good will and mercy of God showed toward
man in Christ, Ephesians. 3.17.
and a sure trust in the same, which Romans 6. toto.
in due time brings forth the fruits of good living.

36. Question.
What do thou learn hereby?

Answer.
First I learn to know God, who is made Romans 8.16.
my Father by Christ, through adoption and grace.

2 Secondly, Galat. 2.20.
I apply to my self by this my faith, all the merits of Christ as fully, as
if I had done the same my self.

3 Thirdly, Romans 4.19. Hebr. 4.16. and 10.22.
I have a sure trust in his merits and mercy, and boldness to offer up my
prayers to GOD the father by him.

4 Last of all I know his promises to Heb. 11.1.
be faithful and true, and that he will perform them, when it pleases his
godly wisdom.

37. Question.
Whence comes faith?

Answer.
It is the gift Math. 11.25 27. and. 13.11. Act. 16.14. Romans 12.6 Galat. 5.22.
Ephe. 2.8
of GOD, wrought in my heart by the preaching of the Gospel, and by the holy
Ghost.

38. Question.
What is the sum of faith?

Answer.
I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus
Christ his only son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne
of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Poncius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and
buried, he descended into Hell, and rose again the third day from the dead,
he ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the father
almighty: from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I
believe in the holy Ghost: the holy catholic Church, the communion of
saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and the life
everlasting.

39. Question.
What art thou taught hereby?

Answer.
1 First, what to believe of God my father and creator: 2 Secondly, of Christ
my redeemer: 3 Thirdly, of the holy Ghost my sanctifiour: Last of all,
concerning the church of God:
40. Question.
What can thou say of God?

Answer.
God is John. 4.24
a spiritual nature, Romans 16.26.
everlasting, Sam. 45.5.6.7. Romans 3.4
almighty, Psalm. 139.7.8.9.
infinite, Psalm. 119.137.
true, Matthew. 19.17
good Psalm. 11.7.
righteous, and merciful, Exodus 34.6.
who has made the world, and Genes. 1.1
has begotten the Son of himself from everlasting.

John. 1.1.
The son is the Prouer. 8.23 Hebr. 1.3. Apoc. 1.8.
wisdom and image of the father, begotten of the father, very God of very God,
John. 1.14. Galat. 4.4.
who, in his time appointed, became man.

The holy Ghost is John. 14.16 26.
the power and virtue proceeding from them both, which three, although they be
Ma^h. 3.16 27.
distinct in persons yet are they Deuteronomy. 4 6.
equal and al one in Godhead, John. 1.1. and.5.18.21. 1. John. 5.7
eternity, dignity, and power.

41. Question.
What say thou of the first part of this faith?

Answer.
I believe, that God is not only the Math. 3.17 Romans 8.16.
natural father of his son Christ, but also that he is by grace my father,
by whose wisdom as heaven and earth, and all things therein contained, were
made, so the same by his Psalm. 145.15. Heb. 1.3. Mat. 10.28.
power is governed and preserved.

42. Question.
What think thou of the second?

Answer.
I believe that Heb. 5.15.
the son of God became man, in all things like unto me, only sin
excepted, and in my nature wrought what was needful to my salvation, Matthew.
1.21. Act. 4.12.
wherefore he is named Jesus, that is, a Savior.

43. Question.
How is thy salvation wrought.

Answer.
This word Christ, does teach the same, for first it signifies him to be a
king, and to have purchased to him self Act. 20.28. Luke. 1.33.
by his blood, the spiritual kingdom of his Church, John. 8. 1. John. ^
all the enemies thereof conquered. Which kingdom now he governs Ephe. 1.13
1. Cor. 6.19
by his word, and by his spirit, whereby he reigns in my heart, and in the
hearts of his elect.

Secondly, it teaches that he was a Heb. 5.5.6.7
priest to offer up him self once for all, a sweet sacrifice, to take away my
sins, and to be a John. 14.13. Romans 8.34
mediator, by whom, and in whose name I may offer up my prayers to God my
heavenly father, and through him be heard.

Thirdly, it puts me in mind that he was Act. 3.21
a Prophet, sent to preach the will of his heavenly father, whom Math. 17.5.
alone I must hear and obey, as my Lord: who being thus appointed of his
father, Mark. 14.10 and.15.15.24 John. 19.38.
was betrayed of Judas, condemned by Pilat, crucified by the Jews, buried by
Joseph of Aromathia and Nicodemus, suffered Esaias. 53.4. Collos. 1.2.20.
in his body, not only the punishments due to my body, but also Math. 27.46.
in his soul, the punishments due to my soul, that was the very torments of
hell and death, and separation from God, Romans 5.19. Col. 2.14 1. John. 3.8 Apoc.
20.14.
by whose death my obedience is wrought the malediction of Gods Law cancelled,
the Devil, and his power subdued, the wrath of God appeased, and I set in his
favor again. And thus is the death of Christ, the only and full ransom for
my sins, by virtue whereof, sin also dies and is killed in me.

44. Question.
It is very needful to keep this excellent benefit always in mind: tell
me therefore, how thou can meditate the same aright.

Answer.
First Isay. 53 toto Romans 4.25. Galat. 3.13 Ephe. 2.14.
I consider, how great the wrath of God was toward my sins, which could be
appeased with nothing, but only with the dear bloudshedding of his son:
and thereby, I begin to hate and eschew sin evermore.

Secondly, John. 3.16 and, 10.17
herein I do behold also the great love of GOD, John. 4.10
which spared not his son for my sake, and likewise the great love of his
son, that vouchesafed to do so much for me.

Thirdly, I Gallat. 2.20.
apply and appropriate the same unto my self, whatsoever Jesus Christ herein
has done: for I am fully assured, that he did it for me.

45. Question.
What say thou of his resurrection?

Answer.
As he died for my sins, so he rose again for my justification, 1. John. 3.8.
having gotten the victory over sin, death, hell, and damnation, and gives
me power through his spirit, Romans 8.10.11.
to rise unto newnes of life, assuring me, that my bodily death shall be no
destruction, but that I shall rise again at the last day, to life everlasting.

46. Question
Show thy mind of his ascension.

Answer.
He ascended act. 1.9. and 3.21. Mat. 28.18.20.
with his body into heaven, where he remains, having all power given him of
his father, but with his spirit he is present with his people: John. 14.2.
Tit. 2.5 Collos. 3.1.2.
by which his ascension, he has taken possession for me in heaven, where he
also continues a mediator to make intercession for me to his father, and
finally, teaches me to set mine affection upon heavenly things.

47. Question.
What meanest thou by his coming to judgment?

Answer.
I believe, that he which is my savior Mat. 24.31. 2. These. 1.8.10. Luke.
21.35.
shall come to clear me and all his elect in judgment, and to condemn the
wicked, which in their life time refused him, to follow their pleasures.

48. Question.
What say thou of the holy Ghost?

Answer.
I believe that 1. Cor. 6.11.
he is the spirit of sanctification, 2. Cor 4.6.
given to lighten my mind, 1 hn. 16.13
and to lead me into all truth, he is 2 Cor. 1.22
the earnest of mine inheritance in heaven, Ephesians. 1.13.
the seal to imprinte Gods promises in my heart, John. 7.36. Esaias. 55.1
the fountain of grace, and the water which purges me from mine uncleanness,
and Romans 8.10.11.
makes me to die to sin, and to be holy unto God.

49. Question.
Show thy mind concerning the Church.

Answer
The Church is Romans 8.29. Ephesians. 1.4.10.11.
the society of all faithful people, whom God in Christ has chosen to
salvation before the world was made, of 1. Cor. 15.55
which number I believe that I am one.

50. Question.
What, is there no salvation without the Church?

Answer.
No, John. 16.4.
for as the branch, except it abide in the Vine, cannot bring forth fruit,
but dies and withers, and so is cast into the fire: even so, except a man be
graffed into the body of Christ, which is the Church, and therein continue, he
can not be saved. And therefore not every religion shall save the professor
thereof, but only the truth of Jesus Christ.

51. Question.
What be the marks thereof.

Answer.
John. 8.47. and. 10.27.
The sincere word of God, Matthew. 28.19
the right administration of the Sacraments, Matthew. 18.17 1. Cor. 5.1.
and Ecclesiastical discipline,

52. Question.
Why is the Church called holy?

Answer.
Because God will have his people to live Tit. 2.12.
holily, soberly, and righteously in this world, and not Ephesians 4.30
to grieve the holy Ghost by any uncleanness, by whom they be sanctified, and
by whom, whilst they suffer themselves to be led, they John. 16.13.
cannot err in matters of faith and salvation.

53. Question.
I pray thee herein by the way, what think thou of the church of Rome, whose
doctrine has been received many years, has she erred and been deceived.

Answer.
The Church of Rome in the beginning and long after the Apostles time, was a
true Church, and so long as she followed John 14.16.17.
the word of God, and suffered her self to be guided with his spirit, she
was free from eroure in matters of faith. 1. Tit. 6.5. 2. Tit. 3.2. Apoc. 18.11.
But when she began to abound in wealth, she forgate her former husband Christ
Jesus, and committed fornication with strange Gods, Galat. 1.6.7.8. 2. Tit.
4.5. 2. Pet. 2.4.
leaving the doctrine of Christ and his religion, and devising a new worship
of her own, wherein 2. These. 2.11. Apoc. 14.8.
according to the just judgment of God, she flourished a long time, and
therewithal, polluted and made drounken the most part of the world, whilst
so many embraced her laws and religion, yea, even all those which were not
Apoc. 7.3. and. 13.8. and. 17.5.
chosen to salvation, and sealed by the spirit of faith. 2. Tit. 4.3.
And of this her departing from the faith, sprang that great darkness, and
ignorance of true religion in these latter days.

54. Question.
What means the communion of Saints?

Answer.
It signifies Romans 12.5. 1. Cor. 12.12.
the fellowship which all the elect have one with an other, 1. pet. 4.10.
Galat. 6.2.
communicating according to the measure of faith, all spiritual graces
amongst themselves, Ephesians. 4.3.
and the studying to keep the unity of the spirit in the bound of peace.

55. Question.
What beleeuest thou of the forgiveness of sins?

Answer.
First, I believe that before my sins be forgeuen me, Romans 5.8.10. Ephesians.
2.1.2. 1. C^r. 6.11.
there is nothing in me but mere wickedness.

Secondly, I believe that al my sins, and the punishment thereof be taken
away P^t. 2.4. Esaias. 53.5. 1. Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.21.
by Christ's death, and I made pertaker of his righteousness.

Thirdly, I believe Romans 3.25.
that faith alone, without any worthiness of my self, does make me partaker
of these graces, and this my righteousness before God.

56. Question.
What say thou of the rest, the resurrection of the body, and life
everlasting?

Answer.
I believe when this life is ended, that Eccle. 12.7. Apoc. 14.13. Luke. 16.22.
Phillip. 1.23.
my soul shall go to God, and my body, to rest in the earth til the last
day, when they shall both join together again 1. Cor. 15.53.
incorruptible, and remain with God for ever in the kingdom of heaven.

57. Question.
How know thou, that thou have such a faith as this?

Answer.
First, I know the same To. 8.16.
by the testimony of the holy Ghost, which assures my conscience, that I am
the child of God, and which makes me cry, Abba father, in full and perfect
assurance thereof.

Secondly, I know Romans 8.9.10. Gal. 2.20. Romans 6. toto.
by the works and fruits of faith, which Jesus Christ being united and
joined unto me, brings forth in me, by the virtue of his spirit, killing my
corrupt and sinful nature and quickening me, to righteousness of life.

58. Question.
Than cannot such a faith as this be fruitelesse, and without good works.

Answer.
No, but good works do follow faith, as the Mat. 7.17. Jacob. 2.24. 1. Pet.
1.12.
testimonies and fruits of my thankfulness to God, whereby my faith is
known, and approved of men: Galat. 5.6.
wherefore it is called faith, which works by love.

59. Question.
What works must thou do?

Answer.
Such as be commanded me in the Mat. 19.17.18.
law of God, 1. Cor. 1.8. Ephesians. 2.10.
which as they come of grace given me, and not of mine own power, so must
they needs be done: for first 1. Pet. 1.16.
God has so commanded. Secondly, his Romans 6. toto. Tit. 2.14.
benefits bind me thereto. Thirdly, Colos. 2.12.
my baptism does teach me to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness.
Fourthly, Mat. 5.16. 1. pet. 2.12.
I must glorify God by my well doing. Last of all, 2. pet. 1.10.
I must make strong my faith and election, and learn to avoid the wrath of
God.

60. Question.
What reward shall thou have for thy good deeds?

Answer.
The works, which I do before I be justified before God by Christ, Romans
14.23. Heb. 11.6. John. 3.36.
can not please him, because they be done without faith. The works which
follow my regeneration, Apoc. 7.14. Math. 25.40. Luke. 17.10. 1. Cor. 15.58.
do please GOD, not because of any worthiness of mine in them, but God
accepts them, because of my faith in Christ, through whom they are not done
in vain, so that the reward which is given unto them, comes only of Apo.
22.
the free mercy and favor of God whilst he rewards not my deserts, but
crowns his gifts of grace in me.

61. Question.
But the Scripture makes mention often, of reward to good works.

Answer.
It is true Cor. 15.58. Luke. 17.10.
that my labor is not in vain in the Lord, yet my good works are not such,
that of themselves they can deserve any such thing. For there be three
things required to the nature of merits: First, that the good works be man's
own, for but to bestow and repay again the same which he had lent him, what
reward can he have. But as 1. Cor. 4.7. Ephesians. 2.10. Luke. 16.2. and 19.13.
for man's good works, they be not his own, but the gifts of God lent him to
use, and he himself Gods instrument to occupy the same.

Secondly, it is required, that a man do the work of his own accord,
without constreint, or respect of duty, for he that is bound to do the same,
cannot well plead of merit, for he does but what of duty he ought to do.
But whatsoever the righteous do, Psalm. 115.1. Romans 8.12.
it is of duty, for he is infinite ways indebted unto God. Thirdly, to the
nature of deserving, it is required, that there be a just proportion between
the thing given, and the thing received: but Romans 8.18. Apoc. 22.17.
none of man's works are comparable to everlasting life. And therefore, I
confess, that I can not deserve any thing of the kingdom of heaven by mine
own works, for the reward which God gives unto my works, is the free gift
of grace, given to me only for my faithes sake in Christ, in whom my works
please God. Wherefore, if man be never so virtuous in the sight of the world
and have never so fair a show of good deeds, and not being graffed by faith
on Jesus Christ, they are altogether unfruitful and vain.

62. Question.
With what helps does God further thee to salvation?

Answer.
Besides that the word of God, 2. These. 3.3.
does help to uphold my faith, the sacraments and prayer are also helps to
me, for by them the Lord helps mine infirmity, by Mat. 28.19 1. Cor. 11.23.
Genes. 11.17.
outward signs representing to me spiritual graces.

63. Question.
Do the Sacraments serve thee to any other purpose?

Answer.
They serve not only to Exodus 12.11.12.13. Mat. 26.26. 1. Cor. 11.23.26. 1.
Cor. 10.17.
teach me heavenly things, but also to kindle a desire of Gods promises in
my heart, to stir me up to thankesgeuing for my redemption, to knitte me in
love with the Godly, and as marks of religion to testify how. I differ from
the heathen and wicked. Wherefore, such as refuse to use the same, do Mark.
8.38. Luke 14.18.24.
not only deny God, but are also arrogant and proud. And therefore not to be
accounted Christians, because they refuse in using of the Sacraments, to make
open profession thereof.

64. Question.
What is a Sacrament?

Answer.
It is an holy sign, instituted of Mat. 21.25. John. 3.5. Act. 2.38. Romans 4.11.
God to confirm my faith, and to seal in my heart the promises of Gods mercy
toward me, for the forgiveness of my sins and salvation in Christ.

65. Question.
Whether do the Sacraments give grace to the receiver, or no?

Answer.
They John. 1.33. Act. 8.18. 1. Cor. 10.5. To. 2.29. 1. Pet. 3.21
neither of themselves nor in themselves include or give grace, for that is the
gift of the holy Ghost, but they be holy signs, whereby, as by an instrument,
God does work and seal grace in my heart by faith received, and yet they be
not bare or naked signs, but grace is truly present to my faith, when I
receive the same aright.

66. Question.
Who ought to minister the Sacraments?

Answer.
Genesis 6.14. and 17.23 Mat. 28.19.
None but such as be ministers too preach the word, for these two offices in
the scriptures, concur and go together, and therefore to none, but to such
as may lawfully minister the word, apperteineth the ministering of the
Sacraments. And hereby women are forbidden to minister baptism.

67 Question.
How many Sacraments be there?

Answer.
Two, the one is Baptism, wherewith I am received into Christ's church. The
other is the Supper of the Lord, wherewith I am nourished in the same.

68. Question.
What is Baptism?

Answer.
It is a Sacrament, wherein, as water washes away the filthiness of my body,
so Act. 2.38 1. Pet. 3.21
the blood of Christ sprinkled upon my soul, by the hand of faith washes away
my sins, and the punishment thereof, whereby Romans 6.5.
I am incorporate into his body, and made partaker of his benefits, to dye
unto sin, and to live unto righteousness, and this is the right use of
baptism, that we be sure that our conscience be clean, and that we show it
to others by our good works, in mortifying our affections and in doing the
will of God.

69. Question.
Why are children to be baptized?

Answer.
Because by Ephe. 2.3. Romans 5.12. Act. 2.39. Genesis 17.7
nature they be the children of wrath, by Adams sin, to whom also the promise
of Gods free mercy and favor reaches. So that being inhetours of Gods free
graces, they must be baptized, and when they come to age, be instructed, what
the meaning of baptism is.

70. Question.
What is the Lords Supper?

Answer.
Mat. 26.26.
It is a Sacrament of redemption die the death of Christ, wherein by the
mystical receiving of bread and wine, through a true faith, I am made 1. Cor.
10.16 Luke. 21.19. John. 6.51.
pertaker of all the benefits of Christ's passion, for as bread broken does
feed and nourish my body, and wine refresh my heart, so the Luke. 22.19 John.
6.51.
body of Christ was torn upon the cross, and his blood shed, to wash away my
sins, and to feed and refresh my soul, to life everlasting,

71. Question.
Whether is the bread changed into the natural body of Christ or no?

Answer.
The Sacraments of bread and wine Mat. 26.29. John. 6.51.53.5. 1. Cor.
10.16.17. and 11.24.
remain still in their former nature and substance, nevertheless there is a
great change, for those things which before were but as common meats, are
now made the Sacraments or holy signs of Christ's body and blood, b but so
that we must seek Christ's body in heaven, and not in the Sacrament.

72. Question.
How do thou eat Christ's body, or drink his blood?

Answer.
John. 6.35. Romans 4.24.
Spiritually by grace, whilst I believe that he dyed for my sins, and rose
again for my justification, for it is faith that makes me pertaker of his
benefits, and goodness which are sealed to me, by his Sacraments. And therefore
by faith I am made one with him, for by his spirit he dwells in me, and is
joined with me, as the head with the members. So then by this conjunction, I
may be pertaker of his graces.

73. Question.
Do all men, which receive this Sacrament, receive the spiritual grace alyke?

Answer.
As in baptism none 1. Pet. 3.21. Act. 2.38. and 8.18. Mark. 16.16.
but the faithful receive remission of their sins, 1. Cor. 11.28.29.
so in the Lords supper, none but such are pertakers of the grace, and
benefittes of Christ's death. The wicked in deed receive the outward elements
of bread and wine, but because they lack true faith, they are not partakers
of the spiritual grace.

74. Question.
Whither must thou once a year, as some do of custom, or often, come to the
Lords supper?

Answer.
Although the benefit rest not in the often, but in the worthy receiving
thereof, yet must I so often as I can conveniently, do the same, ever more and
more to be thankful for my redemption wrought by Christ.

75. Question.
How must thou frame thy self, to receive this Sacrament worthily?

Answer.
First I must Mat. 26.75. Iere. 24.7 Joel. 2.12.13. Romans 6. toto.
consider the greeuousnesse of my sins, and from my heart unfeignedly, hate and
detest the same, and ever after give my self to godliness and virtue.
Secondly, 1. Cor. 11.28. and 2. Cor. 13.5.
I must try and examen my self, whether I have a true faith in the promises of
Christ. Thirdly, Mat. 5.24 and 22.39.
I I must reconcile my self to all men, and continue in Christian love.

76. Question.
What thing is required, that thou may do these things the better?

Answer.
Mat. 3.1. and 26.21 Act. 31.14 and 20.7. 1. Cor. 11.28 2. Par. 23.19
It is very expedient, that as in the primitive Church the word of God was
preached before the administration of the Sacraments, which thing is the life
of the Sacrament, and also an examination taken of the communicantes, before
the Lords supper was eaten: So is it I say, necessary, that the word be
preached, and the people instructed in this mystery, that they may show forth
the Lords death until his coming again.

77. Question.
Now remains the other help given thee of God, that is to say prayer? Tell
me what it is.

Answer.
Prayer is the Mat. 6.6. John. 16.23. 1. Tit. 2.8.
lifting up of my heart to God and asking in Christ's name, of things needful
to me and the whole Church, Phillip. 4.6. Colos. 4.2.
with thankesgeuing, for his benefits, and goodness.

77. Question.
To whom must thou pray?

Answer.
To a God alone: first, because I b believe in him alone. Psalm. 50.15. John.
16.33.
Secondly, he alone 1. Reg. 8.39.
knows my heart: Romans 10.14
thirdly, Esaias. 42.8.
he will not give his glory to any other, and therefore I am forbidden to pray
to Saints.

79. Question.
How can thou, which art a sinner, pray to God that hates sin? Ioh.
14.13.14. and.16.23. Act. 4.12. 1. Tit. 2.5.6. 1. John. 2.2.


Answer.
I pray not in trust of mine own righteousness, but in the name of Christ,
who is the John. 14.16.
way for me to come to the father, who Romans 8.34. 1. Tit. 2.5.6. 1. John. 2.2.
continues my Mediator at the right hand of the Father, John. 13.34.
loves me and has Colos. 1.22.
reconciled me to the Father, Matt. 3.17.
and in whom the Father is well pleased.

80. Question.
For whom must thou pray?

Answer.
For all men living, for 1. Tit. 2.1.2. Math. 5.44. Luke. 6.27.
kings, magistrates, ministers, yea and for my enemies: but for the dead I
have no commandment to pray, neither can I help them after they be gonne
hence, for as they be found at the day of their death, so shall they rise
again, only this can I do, to give God thanks for their deliverance out of
this world.

81. Question.
How must thou prepare thy self to pray?

Answer.
First, I must Romans 8.26. 1. John. 5.14.
be touched with the necessity of those things which I pray for, my mind
must be devout, Mat. 6.7.
and not carried to and fro with vain thoughts. I must appear before God
Psalm. 51.17. Jacob. 1.6.
in true repentance and faith, Mat. 5.23.
being at love with all men, Esaias. 1.18. and.59.2.
framing my life ryghteously, and 1. John. 5.14. 1. Cor. 14. toto. Mat. 6.
Luke. 11.1.
asking in such a tongue as I understand, acording to the will of God.

82. Question.
How must thou pray?

Answer.
According to the form prescribed of our Savior Christ, in these words: Our
Father which art in heaven: hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive the^ that trespass against us. And lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory, for ever, and ever. So be it.

83. Question.
What is the meaning of this prayer?

Answer
We pray to God in the first petition that psalm. 89.5.6 1. Cor. 10.31 Iosu.
24.14.15
his glory may appear, and that Romans 2.24.
our lives and conversation may set forth the same. In the second, we pray
that God would John. 16.13. Romans 8.10.11
govern the kingdom of his Church, killing sin, and the lusts thereof in
the same, and to renew it to righteousness of life. That he would also Romans
16.20. 1. John. 3.8.
tread down Satan and al his power, and that he would shortly Apoc. 22.20.
accomplish the number of his elect, and hasten the coming of Christ to
judgment. In the third we pray Luke. 22.42
that all our doings may be agreeable to his will, without contradiction or
murmuring. In the fourth, we desire him Psalm. 14.1.15
to grant us what soever is needful to the sustenance and preservation of
our life, and that all our dooinges may be to his glory, and the profit of our
neighbors. In the fifth, we pray Psalm. 51.9 1. John. 2.12. and 18.35. Mat.
5.45.
for the forgiveness of our sins and the punishment thereof, for his mercies
sake, even as we shall pardon others their offenses done to us, without
bearing malice, or hatred toward them.

In the last we pray that God Ephesians. 6.10. Romans 16.20.
would guide us with his spirit, that we may get the victory over Satan,
sin, and hell, and be defended from all evils. After we conclude with these
words: For thine is the kingdom etc. To set forth our desire to his glory,
his honor, and praise, whose power is also infinite, and therefore he can
grant our requests. To. 11.36. Act. 4.9.11. Psalm. 114.7. 1. Chro. 29.10.
We make an end with this word, Amen, both desiring, that what we have asked
may be fulfilled, and also assuring our selves, that our requests shall be
fulfilled accordingly as they be agreeing to the will of God.

84. Question.
What if God do not grant thy petitions at the first?

Answer.
That may be Luke. 11.12. 1. John. 5.14.
either because I have not asked in assurance of faith and according to the
will of God, or else by differring the grant of my requests, he will try and
exercise my faith more in calling upon him, that I might continue in prayer and
depend upon his merciful goodness, who notwithstanding at the first he does
not grant my requests, yet in his good time he will accomplish the same.

85. Question.
Is there any help for thee to pray more devoutly?

Answer.
Yea truly, 1. Pet. 5.11. Act. 13.3.
fasting is a special preparatiue to the same.

86. Question.
What is a Christian fast?

Answer.
It is not only an Esai. 58.3. Joel. 2.12. Psalm. 35.13. Zach. 7.5.
abstinence from meats, and drinks, to chastise my body but also from sin
and the delights thereof, which hurt the soul, to the end through true
repentance, faith, Godly prayer, and renouncing of evil, the Spirit may have
dominion in me.

87. Question.
What is the right use of fasting?

Answer.
1. Cor. 9.27.
First to chastise my body, and to bring it into subjection to the spirit.

Joel. 2.12.
Secondly, to be a witness of my true repentance and submission to the will of
God.

M 26.41.
Thirdly, that my spirit way be more ready to prayer.

88. Question
Is there any abuse in the exercise of fasting?

Answer.
Yea, many, Esai. 58.3. Zach. 7.5.
first to fast longer then the body may endure, and after to tare more
deliciously. Secondly, Colos. 2.16. Galat. 4.10. 1. Tit. 4.3.
to put holiness in fasting one day more than an other, or in abstayning from
one meat more than from another. Thirdly, Esai. 58.3. Romans 3.24.
to think by fasting to purchase forgeuenes of sins: whereas the same
comes only of the free mercy of God in Christ, without any man's
worthiness or deserving. Last of all in abstayning from meats, and not to
Galat. 5.24. Tit. 2.12.
abstain from sins, and all things which cause or nourish the same.

89. Question.
Hitherto thou have answered very well to all points of thy faith, yet one
thing further I desire to know, which is, why al men be not of this opinion in
religion, that thou art of?

Answer.
Although there be but one true God, Ephesians. 4.5.
and one perfect religion, yet must you not think that all men will ever agree
together in one religion, for there Gene. 5.13.
is and has been always a continual hatred between Christ the seed of the
woman and the seed of the serpent. And therefore many are professed enemies to
the way of truth.

100. Question.
What way than think thou best, to win such as be out of the way, and to
bring them to the embracing of true religion?

Answer.
As it is specially required in building of an house, first to remove away the
impedimentes, and than to Mat. 7.24. 1. Cor. 3.11.
lay a sure foundation, and afterward to uphold the building: likewise those
things which tend not to the glory of God, 2. Re. 18.44.
but which men have abused must be rooted out, as all relics of papistrie
and superstition, and in stead thereof a good foundation laid by the word of
God, Exodus 25.40. 1. Reg. 23.3.
by which all reformation must be made. Secondly, 1. Re. 2.35. Tit. 1.5. Prou.
11.14.
it is specially required, that a good and godly preaching minister be placed
in every congregation, for where such a one wants, the people perish. Thirdly
Mat. 18.15. Act. 14.23. Romans 12.8.
that there be a right and perfect use of ecclesiastical censure and
correction, to the end the congregation may be better kept in awe of duty and
obedience, so that the best may be afraid to offend.

101. Question.
To be short, do thou think it sufficient, only to know these things
aforesaid?

Answer
No, but Mat. 7.21. Phillip. 1.27. Colos. 1.23. Jacob. 1.22.
it is required, that I join good life and conversation with knowledge, and
therefore I pray daiely that I may have grace given me, that I may live
godlily righteously and soberly, in this world, and so be confirmed in the
truth, that I may proceed from faith to faith, and be so comforted with the
good spirit of God, that my whole delight may be reposed, where true joys are
to be sought, that when I shall finish this mortal race, I may end the same in
the faith and true profession of Jesus Christ my only redeemer and savior. To
whom with the father and the holy ghost, three distinct persons and one eternal
God, be al glory and praise for ever. So be it.

A prayer to be said, before the receiving of the Lords Supper.
O Most merciful God, which of thine everlasting kindness, haste wroght our
redemption by the mediation of thy only son our Savior Jesus Christ, and
also sealed the same unto us, for the more confirmation of our faith, by the
heavenly and mystical banquet of his last supper, instituted and ordained as a
pledge of his endless love toward us, that we in using the same, from time to
time might keep a continual remembrance of his death and passion, and
testify our thankfulness for our redemption: We most humbly beseech thee in
thy tender mercies to look upon us, and to pardon us all our iniquities, our
incredulity, and hardness of heart, and to pour into us thy heavenly grace,
that we being watered with the same, and purified by faith in thine everlasting
promises, may be arrayed and clothed with the excellent righteousness of Jesus
Christ, to the end having upon us our wedding garment, we may be welcome
ghuests, by thy grace, to thy holy table, Where our souls may be nourished
with the precious merits of thy son our Saviors death and passion, and that
we also through faith in the same, by thy grace may be fed unto immortallitie
and life. O Lord we beseech thee to nourish and sustain our hungry souls,
with the spiritual graces of thy son, quench the thirst of our hearts, with the
dew of thy holy spirit, that we may feel our sins clearly to be forgiven
us, and our consciences assured by faith of all the benifites of thy sons
sufferings, even so fully to be done for us, as if we had done the same our
selves. Good Lord for his sake, give us grace to proced from faith to faith,
and more and more to be confirmed in the way of our salvation, by the reverent
and godly use of these thy holy mysteries, give us a right judgment and
understanding thereof, and ever hold us from all Popish corruptions of the
same, unite us more and more through thy grace unto thy Son, that he may
dwell in us and we in him, that he may be one with us and we with him to the
end that being graffed and planted in him, we may be thankful, and bring
forth the fruits of all holiness of life, to the honor and glory of thy holy
name, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So be it.

1. Cor. 11.28.



The form of the confession of the Christian faith, meet for all well
goueruerned housholdes, and necessary for every one to confess, which
sincerely profess Christ and his truth.
I Believe and confess my Lord God, the only true, eternal and almighty
God, inco^prehensible, infinite, righteous, and merciful, being but one in
nature and substance, but distinct in three persons, the father, son and
holy Ghost. Which God by his wisdom and almighty power, made heaven and
earth, and all things therein, and now by his fatherly providence, governs
and preserves the same.

I believe and confess that Jesus Christ the son of God, equal to the father
and the holy Ghost, at the time appointed of the father, became perfect man,
yet without sin, borne of the virgin Mary, the Godhead and manhood being
united and joined together. Who in mine own nature sanctified by his grace,
fulfilled the Law of God for me, and suffered in his body and soul, the
punishments due to my sins, and made full satisfaction and payment for the
same, with his sacrifice upon the cross, done once for all. And delivered me
from the curse of the Law, from sin, hell, death, and damnation, reconciled
me to God the Father, washed me from my sins, clothed me with his
righteousness, and renewed me to righteousness of life. And as by his death my
sins are taken away, and I set in the favor God, so by his resurrection,
death was conquered, and righteousness restored unto me, wherein the victory
of my faith consists. I believe and confess, that Jesus Christ ascended into
heaven with my flesh, where he has taken possession for me, and where he
makes intercession for me. And yet nevertheless, is present with me, and all
his elect, by his spirit and grace, and at the end of the world, shall visibly
come to judgment.

I believe the holy Ghost equal with the father and the son, who
regenerateth and sanctifies me, from my uncleanness, to live holilie, and
righteously in this world, assuring my conscience, that I am the child of
God, and heir with Jesus Christ of life everlasting.

I believe and acknowledge the universal Church of Christ, even all the
company of the elect, agreeing together in the unity of spirit and truth,
which church is not seen to the eyes of man, but only known to God, of which
number I am persuaded that I am one.

I acknowledge also a visible Church of God in this world, wherein first, the
sacred word of God is taught unto his people, being sufficient to instruct
them in all things necessary to salvation. Wherewith together with the
ministry of the spirit, he rules the same. Secondly in this Church, the two
Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper are rightly and sincerely
ministered. Wherein, as by Baptism I am regenerate and received into the
household and fellowship of Christians, my sins being washed away through faith
in Christ's blood: So by the Supper of the Lord, wherein spiritually by faith
my soul is fed with the graces and benefits of Jesus Christ I am nourished and
sustained in the church being one with Christ, and Christ with me, dwelling
also in him and he in me.

Thirdly, there is in this Church due punishment and correction for offenses,
the end whereof is excommunication by the consent of the Church.

Lastly, I believe and confess, that only in this Church there is salvation,
and free forgiveness of sins to me and all the elect of God, through faith in
Christ, by whose obedience we be made righteous, and by whom we are chosen to
an inheritance immortal and everlasting in heaven. Which I most humbly
beseech my Lord God to confirm and strengthen in me, and shortly to make an
end of these sorrowful days, and to translate me to everlasting glory,
through Jesus Christ my redeemer and Savior. Amen.

O Lord increase our faith.
