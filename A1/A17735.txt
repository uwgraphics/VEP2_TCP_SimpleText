Cambridge, July 6. 1638.
A general bill of all those which have been buried in the 14 parishes of
Cambridge, and the liberties of the same, from the 17 of May until this
present 6 of July, 1638.
THat the number of all those which are dead of the plague, or other diseases
in Cambridge, and the 14 parishes of the same, may be truly known, (after due
examination of the Churchwardens and Clerks of the several parishes) we have
thought fit to publish this bill, wherein is truly set down the number of all
those persons which have died in any of the parishes in Cambridge, or at the
pesthouse, and of what diseases, since the 17 day of May, until the 6 of July,
being full seven weeks, and before any infection of the plague, or suspicion of
the same was perceived in Cambridge. Hereafter we intend every fortnight to
publish the like bills, that thereby all such as desire, may be truly informed
from time to time how the sickness increases or decreaseth with us.

All the Colleges (God be praised) are, and have continued without any
infection of the plague, except Jesus College, where only one died of the
plague the 12 of June.
