TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON KNIGHT, LORD CHAVNCELOR OF
ENGland Knight of the noble order of the Garter, and most worthy Chaunceler of
the University of Oxford: my singular good Lord.
RIGHT Honorable, I was long in a strange debate with my self, whether it
were best for me to write some thing in excuse of this slack performance of my
promise made unto your Lordship now more then a year past, for the speedy
translation of VVageners two books of Navigations; or simply to present it
unto your L. leaving all excuse apart, as that negligent servant of Athens, in
Plutarch, who in a cloudie day being sent home in have for his masters cloak,
went therewith directly to Rome, from whence about a year after returning and
watching when his master was abroad in a great shower, came running as though
he had been but then sent, and cast the cloak on his masters back, saying,
Sat cito si satis oportune. Though this might somewhat fit my purpose, and was
very well taken for the time as a sufficient satisfaction for the offense
committed: yet in my conceit, it can not be thought but a very undutiful and
reprouable part. And therefore I choose rather (as in duty it becomes)
humbly to beseech your L. pardon, then to borrow any shift or color to shadow
my default: with assured hope (notwithstanding) that as I was willing to commit
the error, in taking upon me a matter so far beyond my reach: So your L.
will be pleased to give ear unto such honest reasons as may make way for mine
excuse in your L. grave judgment. I must then plainly and simply confess
that I no sooner vnder-took this woork then mistook it, not considering what
perfect knowledge, proper terms and peculier phrases are necessarily and
inseperablie incident to the true interpretation of any Mechanical science,
much more to this notable art of Hidrographie or Navigations: the want whereof
did drive me to read many books, and to confer with such as either for their
knowledge or experience could any ways further mine intent. But as it
chances to busy Builders desirous to excel the Model, not forecasting such
accidents as might interrupt my purpose, I was likewise much deceived even in
the estimate of my labor, time, and charge of the compassyng of my dessein:
For by reason of my daily attendance on your L. and the rest of my Lords of
her Majesty's most Honorable privy counsel, I was forced to take such time
for this work, as I could, by stealth, both for the translation it self, and
for the ouer-seeyng of the negligent grauers: besides many other my particular
and private lets. Howbeit I may assure, that (except some errors in the
printing) there is herein performed the part of a faithful interpretour: and
(be it spoken without prejudice to the Aucthour) by the advice of the best
experienced, have in many places amended and bettered him: Besides the fit
application of the Tables to the English style and Calculation, explaned with
diverse familier examples. Moreover in most of the Plots, the Sea is purposly
left in blanc, because the Traueiler, finding perchance some point of the
Compass, risings of Lands, Depths, Soundings, or ought else mistaken; or some
Rock, Sand, or other danger left out, or not rightly expressed (for nothing so
perfect but has his fault) may as he traueileth set down and correct the same
with his own hand, as it shall best like himself: which doubtless will be no
small furtherance and contentment even to the best Docters in this science. In
this translation I have endeavored by all means (which in this and all other
arts ought to be used) to imitate the plainest style and common manner of
speech, as easiest to be understood of all sorts of men.

But concerning the goodly science of Hidrographie how worthy of all praise it
is, both in it self and in respect of the fruits thereof, as it has heretofore
appeared by Histories of time and testimonies of men: so of late has it shined
most brightlie since our most famous traueilours (to their endless renown and
honor of their country) have adventured the discovery of diverse unknown
coasts: and by the singular assistance of the Almighty God, have compassed the
Globe of the whole earth: whereby (no doubt) many excellent wits have by their
manifold experiences and observations contrived one perfect art: in so much as,
me thincketh, there is ministered very great reason to prefer it before all
other arts or sciences whatsoever. For to omit those commen commendations
wherewith Gorgias and Protagoras wear wont to garnish all arts, pleasant for
knowledge, profitable for practice, necessary for life: this having an
excellent abundance of all these, with many other rare and peculier virtues
all redounding by the use and practice thereof, to the public benefit of the
whole body of the common wealth, and each particular member in the same, has
been not only, as an Elipha^t, ten years in breeding, but even as much time as
the world has yet stood to come to perfection. The first invention whereof,
furthered with the artificial aid of many a hidden, strange and almost
supernatural devise, since added to the same by the most studious trauillour
and industrious Mathematician, He that would thoroughly consider, should find
matter rather myraculous to wonder at, then to be thought compassable within
the reach of man's Capacity: yea he may in this as in a mirror, behold the
inestimable bounty and infinite goodness of God, who, of his unspeakable love
toward man kind, which in his secreat wisdom he had determined for the
maintenance and releef of humane society, has from above powered this
excellent skill and knowledge into the minds of men, only thereby to have
his wonderful works known, his praises published, and his holy name from
one nation to another glorified.

But what do I seem to enter into the particular praise of this art, seeing
things of greatest profit are set forth with least price: where the matter it
self carries credit, the man with his comment gains small commendation. It
should be therefore, me thinks, a greater show of a pregnant wit then perfect
judgment, with affected eloquence to commend this art, or to express how
necessary the perfect knowledge thereof were for all nations.

Yet if this peereles mystery be of such excellent desert, and high account to
all the rest of the world, it must needs be most beneficial and acceptable unto
this our native country, not only for that it is an Island, and that, one of
the most famous in all the world, liyng, as it wear a Triangle, in the great
Ocean, environed with most dangerous waves, Races, Sands, Rocks and Shoalds;
and having a people naturally apt and given to Seafaring: Besides many other
necessary and political reasons: But for that it is the holy Sanctuary, and
(almost) only refuge for the afflicted: and the blessed seat of her Sacred
Majesty: whose incomparable and divine virtue, the enemies of God and man do
most maliciously envy: and incessantly seek by all devilish devises and
practices whatsoever to bereave us of, as of a most precious Iuell; which all
true Christians esteem of far greater worth and value, then all the Indian
riches.

Wherefore I cannot but persuade my self, but as their raging malice does
daily increase and come to height, so the means of our defense in this skill
shall still be multiplied. And albeit your L. commandment and charge given me
to translate these books, has manifested your zeal and affection for this
common good: yet in mine opinion it has more highly commended and advanced
the work it self, in that your Honorable approbation has credited and
auctorized it. For if the Geometritians triumph, of that Oracle which Appollo
gave to the inhabitants of Delos, asking counsel at his mouth for remedy of
their plague: that they should double his cubick Altar: which Plato construed,
that they must study Geometry: How much more ought all such as trauaill by
Sea, and especially our English Mariners, rejoice and resolve themselves of
the worthiness of this woork: and hereby (no doubt) have no less cause duly
and daily to pray for you by sea, then an infinite number of others her
Majesty's good subjects, for your bounty, piety, and Justice uprightly
ministered do zealously by land.

As for the unskillfulness in handling hereof, I have no other means to cover
it, but as the Poet Accius did his shortness, who being a person of a very low
stature, pourtraied for himself a very tall picture: so I, being but of small
desert, have gotten me a most honorable and worthy patron. Following herein
Teucer, who thought himself salf under the shield of Ajax: protesting, that, as
by the daily most comfortable testimonies of your especial favor and goodness
toward me, I am above all men living most bounden to you. So do I acknowledge
me your only own, and do utterly disclayme of any manner interest in my self:
which, with this; and ought else within the compass of my little power
whatsoever; I humbly offer up unto your L. as a pledge of my most dewtifull
and faithful affection to you and yours. And thus all together unable to
satisfy my self in sufficiently expressing my thankful mind and loyal heart,
with my fervent prayer I commit the rest to be supplied by the giver of all
goodness, whom I most humbly beseech bountifully to reward your L. with
increase of Honor and all happiness, in this world, and after a long race
heroically run, a crown of everlasting honor.

From the Court at S. James. 20. October: 1588. Your L. most Bounden and Devoted.

THE AVTHORS ADMONITION TO THE READER.
FReendly Reader, forasmuch as all skillful and experienced in the art of
Navigations, do well know, that certain of the sandy coasts and shoares, as
also diverse mouths and entries of rivers, as well of Holland and Frizeland, as
of Yutland (which in old time was called Cimbrica Chersonesus) and of other
countries, are moveable, and have not always their being in one self place, as
in these Tables or Chartes, rightly, fitly and faithfully they are set down: I
could do no less then admonish the thereof, that thou might diligently
observe and mark them by these Mappes, as things most necessary to be
regarded. For it is perfectly known to all Pilots and Masters, that, by force
of tempests and violence of boisterous winds, huge heaps of sand are so
dispersed, that at length they are made even with the plain Seashore. Which
Keteldune of North Holland, the isle Busk or Corensand, lying betwixt Lawers and
Scilla, near the shore of East Frizland, and the better part of Ameland in
this our age, do most evidently and certainly bewray. For these Sand-hils are
in such sort blown abroad and scattered, that at this day they can scarcely be
perceived, nay they do scant differ in show from the plain low shore:
especially Buske or the Isle of Corensand, which has been so notably
metamorphosed, that in a raging and wrought sea it is quite overflowed at an
high water. In like manner all Masters and Pilots do understand, that, by force
and violence of outrageous storms (which cause most mighty and overthwart
billows) diverse sandy entraunces and Channels of the Sea along the foresaid
coasts, are sometimes choked with sands, and sometimes do shift their seat.
Wherefore by the law of the Sea, such places are expressly forbidden to be
entered without sounding: and therefore they are called Waters of Pilotage. I
have observed and marked these strange chaunges of late years, both in the Maze
and elsewhere: and therefore do find this most true, that for the former causes,
many havens are decayed, and many are altered, as the old Ripe-deep in Yutland
does sufficiently manifest the same: which having had his channel heretofore
between Rim and Manu, has it now welneere two leagues more Northward between
Manu and Fanu. But these only may suffice for examples sake. And although all
these and such like alterations, which have hitherto been found, are with
great care faithfully corrected and reformed by me in the pourtraicts and
descriptions of these Sea-Cardes: yet could I not omit this my well meaning and
sincere admonition for two causes: First, that by these examples thou might
understand, that upon the like causes, the like chaunges may happen: next that
the unskillful and especially the envious backbiter and carper, may have no
matter to cavil, nor occasion to carp: seeing that things to come, and
uncertain, can by no means possible, be perfectly described. And for that it
is but too apparent, how much evil speech, hatred and envy prevail in this
our wretched age. I have thought good to rehearse briefly in this place the
beginning and progress of this my labor. First I endeavored by all my study,
pains, diligence and care to draw the general Sea-Cardes, and the other
particular plots, exactly and faithfully, (as became me) and in the most
faultlesse form that I could: because on them both the lives and goods of such
as traficke and trauill by Sea do depend. Whereby it came to pass, that many
years since (be it spoken without envy) they have been so highly accoumpted
of: that I was earnestly required and oftentimes importuned, of diverse
skillful Pilots and Masters in these countries, besides many principal and
rich Merchants, and owners of ships, to print and publish the same, for the
furderance of salfer seafaring, and the behoof and benefit of the inhabitants
of Holland, Zealand and Frizland, which most of all use traffic by Sea. At
that time for many causes, I yielded not to their requests: specially for that
my mean ability was not sufficient to defray so great expe^se. But at length,
overcome by the importunat suite of Mariners, Masters, and Merchants: but
chiefly by reason of my sincere love and affection toward the commonweal, and
posterity: with the continual instance and exhortation of many persons, of
quality and judgment which egged me on, and, both with promises and
performance, help and furthered the work: I set upon it with a cheerful
mind, and incessant labor: And printed the first part of this Mariners
Mirror, which contains the whole western Navigations, to wit, of the coasts
of France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Portugal etc. and published it
in the year of our Lord. 1583. being dedicated to the most famous Prince of
Orange of happy Memory, who took no small delight therein: and of his great
bounty bestowed large allowance toward the finishing of the work begun.
Wherefore presently I betook my self to the second part: being advertised in
the mean time, by the skilfullest Pilotes, Masters, and Mariners, with how
great commendation the first part was received, and how profitable it was
found, for all such as travail by Sea: which I leave to be remembered of
others.

Moreover I was informed by many Pilots of good credit, with how great
good-liking these Sea-Cardes were received in many other countries and
kingdoms: namely by these most famous and learned men Io. Dowza Baron of
Nortwick, and M. Doctor Maelson who this last year were Ambassadors for the
States of the united Provinces of the low countries, unto the most renowned
Queen of England: where a book of these Sea-cardes was presented at the
Counsel table, by the most Noble Lord, My Lord Charles Howard, Baron of
Effingham, Lord Admiral of England, and was esteemed by the chief personages
of that grave Counsel, worthy to be translated and Printed into a language
familiar to all Nations, that it might be both read and understood of all.
Wherefore from that time, I purposed with my self, to perform the same,
as soon as I might. Shortly after I printed and published the other part of this
MIRROVR, which co^prehendeth the whole Navigations of the German, Scottish and
North Ocean, as also of the Northeast and Baltik Sea. This I dedicated to the
States of Holland and Westfrizland, who graciously and thankefully receiving
it, rewarded me with such recompense as whilst I live I shall never be able
to deserve. This encouraged me, upon the former reasons, to procure, that the
descriptions of these Cards might be translated into Latin: to the end, that,
al nations, which understand that language, might reap both profit and
pleasure out of the same: hoping that it will be very profitable unto all those
which are studious in the knowledge of Navigations, and no less acceptable to
al courteous readers, who may take likyng thereof and accept of this my labor
in thankful manner.

Farewell, From Einchusen. 1586.

THE SAME ENGLISHED IN PRAISE OF THE VVOORK.
TIphis, who first set sail to the winds which blasted yet untried,
And first bended his oars, in streams which waued yet unknown*
Often did he bruze his keele, on shoalds, and often upon hard rocks,
Often by the course not kept, or mayn-storme mightily driving,
With furious whirlewinds, his ships made wrack in a tempest.
Now Mariners henceforth at Sea may ye live very careless,
For that a saulfe journey cleared from dangerous extremes,
Is for ye prepared. For now may ye into good harbor
Hale even at pleasure now does lo the form oath mayn-deepe,
And all shoalds proffer themselves to be clearly beholden.
All this praise is dew to thy wit, to thy pains, to thy charges,
Ingenious VVagener, which have so worthily guyded,
That VVagon on Mayn-sea which winds cause fly to the compass:
As if upon thy both hands and knees with curious insight
Strongly thy self had crept, and searched out the Ocean althrough.
Moreover unless that perauenture a Searcher of East-seas,
Or Northren passage, should want any thing that he searches:
Thou shewst each Region far of, what sort it arises.
Nor Venus in Mirror could view her self any cleerer,
Then Tethys in this Glass may well discern her apeeraunce:
Hold on amayn valiant courage with virtue auanced,
Thou that durst the secreat closet of Seagoddeses enter,
And draw th'astonished Sea-calues to the gaze to behold thee.
And lodge with Dolphins in the deep: thee th'azured whole skulls
Of Proteus pasture reverence: Matuta the Sea-queene,
Yields thee up her Regiment: Lady Doris stoopes lo thy handmayd,
Neptunes Musicien studieth with his horn to delight thee:
VVhiles thou a more certain searcher then Cola the straunge-fish
Searchest out th'entries scant known to the Meyny o fishes,
And openest th'hidden secreats of the old Lady Tethys.
What profit in searching dark realms, sited under horizon:
And Rocks condemned to be pincht with a frost never ending:
Or to go with Magelan to the South sea passages utmost.
What profit in Styx lake? I Will none of your Argos auenturs
VVestern discouerers: it is enough for me to have a corner
In this swift carauell to behold these Tables in order:
And learn how Northern Nereus has spread many branches.
And what in our regio^s th'heights are: who knows whither oneday
This Lukes discovery shall rayze those Riphean hil-topps
Where the Hyperborean long-liud people are to be found out:
Though thither yet no star, nor lead, has led any Spaignard.
A NOTE OF CERTAIN WONDERFVL and most dangerous places in the Sea, which
Wagenar has set down in his Epistle to the Prince of Orange.
Among the merueilous works, that the Almighty God has created both upon
and in the Sea, by, and along all coasts: besides all other dangers whereunto
the sea-faryng men are subject, as tempests, storms, winds, sands, rocks,
etc: there are certain places, where the waves and floods, do so encounter
each other, and engoulph themselves with such violence and swiftness, that
many ships, men and goods have been cast away er they were ware of them. The
principal and most perilous of all, is the Maelstreame, well or Slorp, called
the Mouskstream, which lies on the back side of Norvvay, in 68. degrees on the
North-side of an Island or Rock called VVeeray. This well draws the water
unto it self during the whole flood (which is the space of six hours
and.xij. minutes) with such an indraught and force, and with such a noise,
through the tombling and falling of the waves and streams the one upon the
other that it is rather to wonder at then to write of. So that during that
time, with in the space of more then two leagues round about that Rock of
Mousk (under which that water flows) no ship or other vessel may come near,
for they should to their utter destruction be drawn into it and swallowed up.
But all the time of the Ebb, the water is so strongly cast up again, that no
kind of substance or mettell, how heavy so ever it be, can there sincke. So
that the Northren Fishers at that time do with their Iollen or fishing boats,
take many and strange formed fishes, which they draw unto their boats with
hooks and lines, which they have ready laid for that purpose: for that,
during the ebb, they cannot return into the goulphe, nor get under the water
by any means.

The Northren people that inhabit about those Rocks, do think, that that
stream passes away underneath a part of Norvvay unto the North bottom in
East Finland: because in that place there is likewise such a Maelstream, though
not algether so strong nor dangerous: where the like fishes are taken and the
water is in like sort troublesome, as it is underneath and about the Rock of
Mousk.

VVheruppon many experimented Pilots, do call the said Slorp the Navel of the
sea: which causes the course of the Ebbes and Floods about all the lands that
are on this Northside of the Equinoctial, as the most conuement place for that
purpose to spread the waters South, North, East and west, that is to say,
Northerly toward the Pole Artick: South easterly on the backside of Russia
and Tartarie, toward the streict of the great South Sea called Mar del Sur:
wherein the Spicerie Islands called the Moluccas, near the Equinoctial are
liyng: Southwards, toward the North-sea of these Low countries: as also on
the backside of Scotland, and Ireland, toward the Spanish and Atlantic seas:
And toward the Northwest beyond Izland toward Furbushers streicts, where it
is thought the way unto Catay may be found.

There are more over to be feared upon the western seas very dangerous streams
and goulphs, as is the Ras of Portland, where often times happens such a
turnyng and tombling of waves and streams, that the Ships which pass that way
are many times in great peril.

Moreover the Ras of Blancquert between Normandy and the Isle of Alderney,
roreth and rages so dangerously, that many ships fall therein hedlong so deep,
that soddenly they are swalowed up and sunck unto the very bottom.

The Ras of Founteney is more dangerous then all these, wherein many small
vessels and barks of Britteny and of other countries are suddenly devoured and
cast away. And the entrance of ye Garronne, called the River of Bourdeaux,
between the to w rs of Cordam and the Southern and Northern Asses, is likewise
very perilous and many ships do often perish there, if the Pilots be not
skillful and well acqueinted with the place. And these be the most dangerous
goulphs and streams in the northern and western seas, whereof it behooves the
seafaryng man to take special heed.

OF THE USE AND PRACTICE OF THIS BOOK.
Whosoever will use these Charts of seafaring as they ought, and as the
practice it self requires: must first know and diligently mark, that the
several arisings and appearing of every country are particularly pourtrayed
in the uppermost part of the Chart, or else, where is greatest room: and
sometimes in the map following for the fitnes of the place: as appears in
the Charte of Flaunders, where the chief appearances of Holland and Zealand
are set down in the uppermost part of the Charte, in the same fashion as they
show and appear first, to those which come from the sea, which may be known
by mountains, valleys, woods, hills, cliffes, towers, cities, beakons, or
capes, etc. But after that the coast is descried, a skillful Pilot must
consider, how he may sail thither: and upon what point of the compass the
haven or river lies: what banks, shoalds, tail sands, rocks under and above
water, what blind rocks you must shun, and what depth is near the shore.
And being come nearer, what shore marks, steeples, windmils, hills and
cliffes, and what trees are to be brought in one to come to the true depth or
channel. Moreover how the Buys be set near the havens or rivers both in
going out and coming in, and how far they lie one from another. And that is
expressed at large and in good order in the several description of every
Charte. And seeing that many which were never at Sea will not without cause
marvel when they see these particular maps, why in some coasts, rivers, and
other Inland waters, the towns, towers, rocks, and other marks or signs do
seem on one side to stand upright, and on the other side clean contrary: The
gentle Reader shall understand that in the particular Chartes I have treated
little thereof, as a matter not incident to the treaty of Navigations. But
forasmuch as Pilots, Shipmasters, Mariners, and many others (whom it specially
concerns) which set out daily to the seas, have hitherto continually used,
and as yet do always use the like charts: so that with the least alteration
thereof they may often put in danger their ship and goods: I thought it not
requisite by and by to change the same: although I know and have proved for
certainty, that it will seem very absurd and against reason to all cunning
and skillful men: whom I earnestly desire for that cause to have me excused:
least by reason of the straungnes and such doubtful alteration, those which go
to the sea should be brought to any doubt or confusion, whereby many dangers
and discommodities might ensue. And let it not seem strange to any if
peradventure some of the sea coasts, havens, countries, etc. appear not so
fully and plainly, and show themselves as indeed they are, and as they are
pourtraied in our several Chartes. For albeit (besides mine own skill and
experience) I have conferred and shown whatsoever is contained in this book
to diverse Shipmasters and expert Pilots, and have corrected the same by their
notes, who according to their several experience and judgment, have praised
and allowed all these several Chartes: which since that I have published in
the same form: yet because it is natural for men to be deceived, and for that
diverse men have not only diverse opinions, but also evident faults: perhaps many
errors will be found in this book, which a painful and diligent Pilot will
easily amend, seeing it is far easier to correct that which is already
invented, then to frame a new.

OF THE SPECIAL PROPERTY OF THE SEA, WHICH AS WELL IN times past, as at this
present makes many to wonder.
NO man doubts that the waves of the great Ocean, and the force of the
stream (notwithstanding a contrary wind) do always come from the
North-west, and flow very swiftly upon all the sea coasts, and in the seas of
our usual navigations. The waves are mounted on such an height, and separated
so far asunder, that when two ships are parted by such waves, each others
mastes and tops cannot be seen: which happens commonly at a still water,
or calm weather. And these waves are so far distant, that you cannot shoot
from one ship to another with a Caliuer. Moreover in all the streicts or Leuant
sea, the waves always drive, and rise up against the coasts, creekes, and
shores, and also the little streams and rivers (notwithstanding a contrary
wind) always roll up against the shore: a thing doubtless, strange and
wonderful. But yet I think that no man has hitherto (as far as I know)
certainly declared or defined the natural cause of this motion. Wherefore in
few words I will declare my opinion hereof. The cause of this motion may
proceed (without prejudice to other men's opinions) from the North-west
quarter: because many tempests and storms arise in the North and North-west
countries, by reason of the coldness and intemperature of the air, land and
sea: from whence blow such mighty and forcible winds, driving and beating the
sea and the waves thereof with such might, that no contrary wind can stop or
resist the course or tossing thereof: and that happens by reason of the
continual succession of the waves and surges which drive one another from a
coast so far off. But some man may demand why it proceeds not rather from
the South-west, where the sea is widest and largest: who may be thus
answered: That the sun with his natural heat does so temper and moderate
the winds, surges and waves under the South Clymates, that there cannot arise
such great tempests. For it is seen and proved by daily experience in the
Indian Navigations, that the sun being high in the South Clymates, does make
the weather calm, and the waters smooth. Contrariwise, the sun being in the
North and North-west has no such force, but yields lesser heat: which may
be the cause why the waves are always troublesome North-westward, and come
rouling about all the sea coasts of Europe. But I believe that a ship far
from the shore, and under sail in the midst of the Northwest sea, perceaueth
no such matter. But when you draw near or about Nevv-found land, you shall
doubtless find again that the floods and narrow seas within the land are
stirred up and flow from the North-east. And this, gentle Reader, is my opinion
hereof, submitting my self to the better censure of other men. But the
secrets of Almighty God, the only creator and governor of all things, are so
incomprehensible and insearcheable, although we behold the heavens, the air,
the land and seas: that we are altogether unable, in respect of his
omnipotency, or rather unworthy to judge or set down any certainty thereof:
but so far as our endeavor and the compass of our human wit given us of
God can naturally conceive, and no farther. The rest we most humbly refer to
his divine majesty, until we are changed from this miserable and wretched
life.

AN EXHORTATION TO the Apprentises of the Art of Navigations.
THe first and chiefest way to attain to the perfect skill and science of
Navigations, is, whenever any Shipmaster or Mariner shall set forth from land
out of any River or Haven, diligently to mark, what buildings, Castles,
Towers, Churches, Hills, Bals, Downs, VVindmils, or other marks are standing on
the land. All which, or many of them, let him pourtray with his pen, how they
bear, and how far distaunt: but upon the true and certain points of the
Compass, upon which he first set sail, and shaped his course, whilst yet
every mark on the land may be clearly and evidently perceived, to the end
the true arising thereof may be the better had. He must also very often cast
the Lead, that he may most exactly note in his Compt-booke, how far off, all
the shoalds and sands lie from the shore.

In like manner must he proceed that descrieth, and arriueth toward any other
country, to wit: as soon as the arising and show of the land, be it high or
low, with the beakons and other marks may be plainly perceived: straightway
must he compare them all with those our Chartes and Tables. And when the Coast
is thus known either wholly or in part: then must he warily and diligently
endeavor to seek out and find the true depth and channel by certain Marks,
Towers, Churches, Beakons, etc. which are found almost at every port, entry,
cape or point: and no less heedfully consider, how his course lies inwardes
and outwardes. Any Mariner that will diligently, and with understanding
practice these precepts, shall attain the true skill and science of
Navigations. For that which any man either young or old exercises, searches
out and observes himself, sticks faster in memory, then that which he
learneth of others. Notwithstanding let him not neglect, nor shame to enquire
of the Master of the ship, and other men exercised in this study, the
situation of countries, the courses upon several points, the depths or
soundings, and the eleuations of the Pole: and practice with the Cross staff,
and Astrolabe. The which two, are the principal instruments (next the
Compass) that belong to safe and skillful seafaring.

This admonition and instruction is here set down, only for the help and
furtherance of young beginners in this Art.

A TABLE OF THE PRIME, OR GOLden number, and of the Epact according to either
computation.
Away to find out the Golden number, without Ephemerides or Calendar.
Golden Numb. New Epacts The Old Epacts 1 1 11 2 12 22 3 23 3 4 4 14 5 15 25 6

IF you will find out the golden number of the year of our Lord 1588. cast
away 1500. years, and divide the 88. that remains by 19. (which is the full
number of the circle of the Moon) and there remains 12. which is the golden
number of this year to which for every year following add one until you
come to 19. which is the last number of the Circle of the Moon. Then reckon
again the number in order viz. 1. 2. 3. etc.

This golden number is called the circle of the moon, because in the space of
19. years, the Moon after having made all her changes and conjunctions with
the Sun, and passed through the signs of the Zodiac, begins again to
change, almost at the very same hour and day as before.

How to find out the Epact without an Ephemerides, or Almanacke, according to
the new style.
YOu must have the Golden number ready in your mind by the former rule, which
you shall reckon upon the ioyncts of your thombe, from the lowest to the
uppermost: and if your account do end at the lowest joint the Golden number
and the Epact shall be one. But if it end upon the second, add x. to the
Golden number, which being put together make the Epact for that year: But if
it ends on the highest joint add.20. to the golden number and so being put
together, you have the Epact: But if it pass.30. cast that away and keep the
remainder for your Epact.

For example.

I would know the Epact of the year 1588. I find the Golden number to be 12.
by the rule aforesaid: which being reckened ends upon the uppermost joint of
the thombe: and therefore do I add 20. to the Golden number which makes 32. so
that 2. is the Epact for that year, which is also expressed in the former
table.

That you may learn the time of the new Moon rightly from the year.1588. to
the year 1606.
Seek in the Table following the Golden number of the year for which you seek
in the first Colomne, and you shall find in the side entrance the new Moons
for the whole year through all the months, what day, houer and minut they
are, (which as VVagenar made according to the new style and Calculated for the
Meridian of Enchuysen, so here they are reduced to the old style and
calculated to the Meridian of London,) It happens sometimes that two new
moons are in one month, which the Table will show. But after the time of
1606. is expired: this Table gives you the new Moons according to the middle
or equal motion of both lights upon the same day, but deducting an hour and a
half, and having regard to the Leap year.

A WAY TO FIND OVT THE LEAP YEAR WITHOUT either Calender or Ephemerides.
Divide the years of our Lord by 4. and if nothing remain after the division,
that year is Leap year, but if the number of 1. 2. or 3. shall remain, it
signifies what year it is after the Leap year. As for example. Take the
year since the Nativity of Christ, 1588. which being divided by 4. nothing
remains, wherefore it is Leap year. And the year 1589. the first after the
Leap year. The year 1590. the second, and the year 1591. the third. But the
year 1592. shall be a Leap year again, and so forwards.

OF THE DECLINATION OF THE Sun, and the use thereof.
FOr as much as for many and weighty causes ten days are once for ever cut off
from the year by certain Monarchs of Europe as needless, that thereby the
Equinoctial or Solstitiall points might be brought to the same days of the
month as of old time they were, in the time of the Nicene council: and so the
4. seasons of the year (viz.) the Spring, Summer, Harvest, and VVinter, begin
on the same days as they were wont.

And furthermore as the appearances and suppositions of the 8. sphere do show a
manifest inequality in the greatness of the sun: so in continuance of time, as
apparent an alteration is perceived in his greatest obliquation. For by the
observations of Erarosthenes, Hipparchus, and Ptolomy, of which, the two first
lived a little before the beginning of the Roman Empire: and the third, a
little after: the greatest obliquation of the sun was found to be almost even
with his utmost declination: so that in the time of Julius Caesar, and the
beginning of the Roman Empire, the greatest was of 23. degrees, and 52
minutes. But afterward it decreased by little and little, as plainly appears
by the observations of Albaregnius, and since by Arzahel the Spanyard, Almeon,
Almanzor, Prophatius the Jew, and many others, which for this last hundred
years, by the diligent study, and observing of George Purbachius, Johannes
Regiomontanus, Vernerus, Copernicus, etc. is yet found still decreasing: so
that at this time, it is well near upon the last and farthest point, (viz.) in
23. degrees, and 28. minutes, or at least wanting a few seconds.

Therefore VVagener thought it not impertinent to set down the table of the
declination of the Sun for the behoof of all Pilots, Shipmasters, and all
kind of Sailors, as well according to the right course of the sun, as this
apparent obliquation of our time: hoping that he should do therein that which
should be acceptable, and not unprofitable unto them. But it has since been
thought fitter for us in England to follow our ancient and accustomed style,
not acknowledging any such perfection of the Gregorian reformation.

OF THE USE OF THE Table following for the Suns declination.
FIrst you must know whether it be a Leap year, or the first, second, or
third year after the Leap year: and when you understand the same, entering
the Table of that year, you shall seek out your purposed month and day in
the top and side titles: for the common Angle will show the declination of
the sun, for the same day, northward from the 10. of March to the 13. of
September, and southward from the 13. of September to the 10. of March, and
these days are marked thus.

Now if you desire to know the latitude of any country or height of the Pole,
take the meridian height of the sun by your Astrolabe or Cross staff, and
it will show the distance of the sun from the Zenith, or highest point. And
if the declination of the sun be Northward the same day, add it to the
distance of the sun from the Zenith. But contrariwise deduct it again if the
declination be Southward, and you shall have the latitude of that place, or the
altitude of the Pole. As for example. VVagener in the year 1583. the 21. of
January, took by Astrolabe at Enchuysen the meridian altitude of the sun
about 20. degrees, and 50. minutes: wherefore the distance thereof from the
Zenith is near 69. degrees, and 10. minutes. In the Table of the declination
of the Sun the third year after the Leap year, he found the same day
(after his accoumpt) the obliquation of the sun in 17. and 20. minutes
southward, which being deducted from the distance of the sun from the Zenith,
because it is Southward, there remain 52. degrees, and 50. minutes, which is
the latitude or altitude of the Pole of the City of Enchuysen.

In the year 1588. the 8. of July, at London the meridian altitude of the
Sun was observed 59. degrees, 28. minutes. Wherefore his distaunce from the
Zenith is 30. degrees, 32. minutes. In the Table of the Suns declination for
the Leap year I find for that day the Suns Northren Obliquation 21. degrees,
2. minutes, which added to the Suns distance from the Zenith, because it is
Northerly, makes the whole 51. degrees 34. minutes, which is the true latitude
of the place, or altitude of the Pole for the City of London.

TO FIND OVT THE NEW MOON, AND THE AGE OF THE MOON at any time, according
to the ancient computation, without either Calender or Ephemerides.
FIrst you must learn perfectly by the former Tables the Golden number and the
Epact of that year, and their difference. But know this, that the Golden
number always begins in the Calendes of January, and every year increases
one until the circle of the Moon be ended, which then returns to 1. 2. 3.
But the Epact begins in the Calendes of March, and increases every year
11. and ends at 30. Wherefore when it exceeds 30. by casting away the
whole circle, the remainder is the Epact, to which every year is added 11. as
is aforesaid.

Now if you will know what day of every month the new Moon does happen: take
the number of the Epact of the present year: and add thereunto the number of
the months past from the beginning of March, reckoning also the month
present. And if these numbers being added together amount not above 30. then
as much as you want of 30. is the day of the new Moon of that month.

But if you look for the age of the Moon, add the days that are past of the
month present to the Epact, and the months since March: and the number
remaining after the substraction of 30. declares the age of the Moon. But if,
being added together, it be under 30. that self same tells how old the
Moon is. But you may perceive these things more plainly by examples.

The example of the first.
I would know the new Moon of the month of June, Anno 1588. The Epact of this
year is 12. whereunto I add 4. for the 4. months, beginning at March, which
being put together make 16. Now this number is less then 30. and therefore I
substract 16. from 30. and there remains 14. so that the new Moon was the
14. of June.

The other example.
I demand how old the Moon shall be the 24. of August of this same year
1588. The Epact is 12. to it I add 6. for the months past: they make 18.
whereunto I add 24. the number of the days of August, and then have I 42.
which exceeds 30. by 12. which shows the age of the Moon: and therefore
the 24. of August the Moon shall be 12. days old.

If you will find the Epact without any book begin to reckon 10. at the lowest
joint of your thombe, at the other 20. at the third and last 30. which done,
count the Golden number upon the joints of your thombe, reckoning from the
lowest to the highest, until you come to the end of it. And if your account
shall end on the lowest joint of your thombe where I have set 10. add ten to
the Golden number, which being both put together do make the Epact for that
year. But if the reckoning shall end upon the second joint, add 20. to the
Golden number, and both the numbers together do show the Epact. But if it end
on the third, the Golden number and the Epact shall be one. As for example.

The question is what the Epact is Anno 1588. the Golden number is 12. which in
numbering ends on the third joint where stand 30. which being added make 42.
of which 30. being cast away the remaynder is the Epact: which begins
always the first of March: as the Golden number does the first of January.

OF THE FIXED STARS AND THEIR USE.
FIrst it is necessary for you to know that the obliquitie or declination of
the fixed stars is of two sorts: to wit, Northward and Southward, which in
the Catalogue of the fixed stars are marked with these letters, N, and S.

If you will seek the height of the Pole in any place by the help of any
fixed star set down in the Table following, take her Meridian altitude by
the quadrant or Cross staff. Then by the Table following seek out her North
or South declination, which you must add to the altitude, if the declination
be southerly, or substract it, if it be northerly, and it will show you the
altitude of the Equator: which being deducted from 90, expresses the height
of the Pole. As you shall perceive more plainly by familiar example; In the
year 1583. on the 10. day of January about five a clock in the morning
Wagener took at Enchuysen the Meridian altitude of Spica virginis with the
Cross staff, in 28. degrees and 15. minutes. The Table shows that her
Southward declination is 8. degrees and 55. minutes, which being added to the
Meridian altitude, declares the Equator to be 37. degrees, and 10. minutes
high: which being subtracted from 90. there remains 52. degrees and 50.
minutes, which is the altitude of the Pole for Enchuysen.

Another example is, that the 11. day of January in the same year about 8. of
the clock toward the evening, Wagener took the Meridian altitude of
Palilicium, or Oculus Tauri of 53. degrees, and 4. minutes. The Table teaches
that his Northward declination is of 15. degrees, and 54. minutes, which you
must take from the altitude, because it is Northward, and leave 37. degrees,
10. minutes, for the altitude of the Equator, when you have subtracted these
numbers from 90. that which remains being 52. degrees, and 50. minutes, is
the height of the Pole, as aforesaid.

If you will learn the true hour of the night by the fixed stars, mark
well some one of the fyxed stars which you know, standing in the South: then
look for the same in the Table, and take the hours and minutes from the
declination. And seek also for the day of the year in the next Table to the
Catalogue, and substract the hours and minutes which you find there, from the
hours and minutes which are allotted to the star: and that which remains
signifies the hours and minutes of the midday last past. But if it shall
happen that the star shall have less hours and minutes then a natural day
has, then add 24. hours to those of the star, and substract, as aforesaid.

It will appear more plainly by this example. We have before marked Spica
virginis upon the 10. of January, and therefore must we seek out the hour of
his observation. In the Catalogue right against this star, are 13. hours,
and 3. minutes, and in the Table of the days the 10. day of January has 20.
hours, and 10. minutes. Wherefore we add 24. hours to the hours of the
star, and they make together 37. hours, and 3. minutes. Substract from hence
20. hours, and 10. minutes, and there remain 16. hours, and 53. minutes,
which are the hours from the last midday. And therefore the observation was
made at 4. a clock, 53. minutes in the morning, or after midnight.

An other example is. Wagenar saw the 11. day of January aforesaid Palilicium,
or Oculus Tauri. In the Catalogue you shall find hard by the star 4. hours
12. minutes. Likewise the Table of the days about the 11. day of January,
gives you 20. hours, 14. minutes. And because the hours of the star are
fewer then those of the day, he added 24. hours, which being put together make
28. and 12. minutes. He subtracted from them 20. hours, 14. minutes, and
there remained 7. hours, and 58. minutes. And therefore the time to mark the
star was at 7. a clock, and 58. minutes in the afternoon.

I will also show a third example. The 17. of March, Anno Domini 1583. Wagenar
took the Meridian altitude of the star called Rostrum Corui, that is, the
Ravens byll: the hour thereof he gathered after this manner. In the Catalogue
where this star is mentioned, you have 11. hours, 48. minutes. In the Table
of the days you find 17. days of March, hours 0. minutes 24. which being
deducted from the hours of the star, are 11. hours, and 24. minutes
remaining. Wherefore this observation was taken the 11. hour 24. minutes after
midday. And so proceed with other fixed stars.

The Dodecatemories in the Zodiac, are partly Northerly, and partly
Southerly. The North signs are, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, for
the Summer season: the Southern, are, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius,
Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, which are the signs for the Winter. To every
several sign are appointed particular months: March, April, May, June,
July, August, are assigned for the Summer, and September, October, November,
December, January, February for the Winter.

THE WAY TO FIND OVT THE HEIGHT OF THE POLE BY THE STARS WHICH ARE WITHIN
the Tropicks declining from the Equator.
FIrst you have the South star called Alhabor, or the great dog, which
declineth from the Equator 15. degrees. 55. min. to the Southwardes. Take his
distance from the Zenith, and substract from it the degrees and minutes of the
declination, because it is Southerly, the remainder shows the height of the
Pole. But if the Poles height must be sought for by Orions right shoulder: ad
to his distance from the Zenith, 6. degrees. 19. minutes of the declination,
because it is Northward, and you shall find that you seek for.

But if you will find it out by Orions left foot: substract from the
distaunce thereof to the Zenith 9. degrees. 10. minutes of the declination,
because it is Southward: the rest, shows the height of the Pole. And in like
manner shall you proceed by the first of Orions girdle. For substracting from
the distaunce thereof to the Zenith, one degree, 16. minutes of Southern
declination, the residue is the Poles height. So may you do with all the
stars which are within the Tropicks, declining from the Equator: so that
their declinations both Southern and Northern in the just degrees and
minutes, be first known unto you. For if the declination be Southward, it must
be subducted from the Zenithes distance: but if Northward, added: and then the
whole some, or the remainder will demonstrate the height of the Pole. The
meridian height of the Star is taken by the cross staff, or other fit
instruments, and being deducted from 90. degrees, shows you the distance
from the zenith.

The Poles height may also be found, by the stars, which turn about the Pole
within the Arcticke circle, and every 24. hours pass the meridian twice,
under and over the Pole: so that you may take them twice in one day, if
occasion serve: for example. The middle star of the Guardes in Vrsa minor,
declineth from the Acquinoctiall, 75. degrees, 40. minutes: distant from the
Pole both above and under, 14. degrees 20. minutes. Take his meridian height,
and add to it the degrees of the Poles distance, if it be above: or substract
it, if it be under: the sum or the remainder will show the elevation. The same
way must you work by the stars of Vrsa mayor (which are more in number) so
that you certainly know their distances from the Pole, being under or above by
adding (as is said) the degrees of the distance, to the Altitude which you
find, if it be above the Pole, or subtracting, if it be under.

So may you work with the rest of the stars, which can be seen and applied
to use by Nauigatours.

A DECLARATION OF THIS instrument which follows.
IN the compass and borders of the uttermost circle, there is set down the
circulare course of the Guardes in Vrsa Minor, as they turn in all the 8.
points of the instrument or compass about the North star: which have also
certain numbers assigned both to be added and subtracted, so that when the
said stars come in any of those points, you must add or substract the
number which is there marked. You must also know, that all the stars do pass
the meridian: but every one in a several declination from the Equator.

The other compass or circle, which moves, has the chiefest of these stars
which enuiron the Pole, or are carried round within the Tropikes of Cancer and
Capricorn. The Northern stars serve to find out without difficulty the
hours of the night at any time of ye year, especially the Guardes in Vrsa
Minor: which on the 30. day of April at midnight stand North, above the Pole,
and then is it 12. a clock at after midnoone. And after 15. days, the said
stars remain in the same place, at eleven a clock at night, and at the end of
May, at ten a clock: so that in every 24. hours: by 4. minutes of an hour
they prevent the same place, and in every 15. days, one hour sooner, they
become North above the pole: which if any man do rightly mark, he may easily
find out ye hour of ye night at any time.

But if you will fitly apply to this purpose of the South stars, the greatest
part whereof do move within the Tropikes of Cancer and Capricorn: you shall
turn about the uppermost round circle or the moveable wheel, wherein the
Guardes of Vrsa minor are purtraied: and taking ye same point in this circle,
you shall set it right upon the Southeast point of the compass, where you shall
begin: Then the Southern star which is called Canis Mayor, and Alhabor
will stand in the Meridian about 16. degrees from the Equator. Three hours
after when the said stars are in the East point, Lucida hydrae which is also
called Alphard, stands in the Meridian: and right above it is placed the
Maunger or Nebulosa Cancri. But when the same stars are North northeast and
North and by East, then Spica virginis stands in the Meridian: and about 4.
hours after, when those Guardes or watchers of Vrsa minor being mounted
higher, possess the N. w. region of the firmament: Cor Scorpii stands in the
Meridian, declining from the Equator almost 25. degrees. But when the said
stars bear west and by North, then Lucida Sagittarii keeps the Meridian, but
when you have brought it west Southwest, Fomahand keeps the meridian. Both
the latter stars have a great declination from the Equator then the rest:
for the one bears to the Southward 26. degrees and 27. minutes: and the other
33. degrees, and 27. minutes. Now if the said watch stars stand South
southwest, then the Whales Tail keeps the meridian, declining, 19. degrees
48. minutes Southward from the Aequatot. But if the said stars be South and
by East, and South southeast. The Bulls eye, and Orion shall possess the
midnoone stead. After an hour and half the great Dog returns again to the
meridian. All these rehearsed stars, do most of all agree and serve fitly for
the observation of Nauigators, which are made with the cross staff, or other
instruments. Two or three of these may be cut in the transuersarie of your
staff which must be long or short, according as the declination of the star
is Southerly. For that which has a greater declining from the Aequinoctial,
requires a shorter cross or transuersarie, which beneath in the making of the
sea cross staff, is more largely delared.

Yet we would have the reader admonished, that the Guards or watchers are
placed in this Instrumenc exactly opposite to their due place: leaving
nevertheless the two greater stars of those Guards, in their own place
between the Pole star and the Dragons tail: that thereby may be known,
what stars are in the meridian, when the Guardes, are in those points. But
let the upper part of the book, which represents the North, be turned to the
South, and yet in such sort, that the East point, may be right Eastward. For so
shall these stars stand in order. Afterward the book may be turned and
tossed at pleasure, so that heed be taken, that you miss not in the point of
the compass.

(...) AN INSTRVMENT VRANICALL OR MOVEABLE COMPASS FOR THE STARS


OF THE MAKING AL manner of the Sea cross staves.
TO make a cross staff, first you must draw a circle with your compass, and
divide it with two diameters into four quadrants, of which the nethermost must
be parted into 9. even portions: and every one of them subdivided into ten even
parts: of which each again must be divided into two equal sections, which by
imagination are to be divided into five parts, so that each quadrant thus
disparted by five, shall contain 90. parts, This done, draw forth at length
your nethermost half diameter, which represents the staff. And then on each
side of the circle, to the utmost border draw two right lines, of (...)
distance and length with the line of your staff. Then from the highest point
of the uppermost half diameter, draw several lines, by the several
partitions of the inferior quadrants, unto the border of the utmost lines,
according to the length of your staff: as is here evidently taught in this
present pattern. These things finished: you shall make your transuersarie or
cross, according to the length of the whole diameter: but so that the midst of
it, touch the marckes of the first degrees of the staff. And if any man will
make a longer transuersarie: he must remove the lines, which are on either
side of the circle, so far off from the circle, as he would lengthen his
Cross: And then, as before, draw the lines of degrees from the top of the
upper half diameter, to the inmost verge of the utter lines. The length of the
cross shall always be such, that it may reach from 30. to 60. degrees, but so
that these degrees may be discerned, at both ends of it.

The making of a cross staff, serving for diverse South stars.
FIrst you must observe by the Guardes, what stars are in the meridian? for
example. The great dog, which is also called the South star, declining
near 16. degrees from the Equator: from which you must begin to number: but
so that the midst of your cross, and the nether part of your staff: contain
exactly 16. degrees which, there beginning to reckon, shall end descending to
the Equator: from whence again ascending: the numbers are engraven to the
staves end, as the Pattern following sets clearly before your eyes. And if
you will make a cross for some other more Southerly star, to wit, which
declineth 20. or 25. degrees from the Equator: then you must begin your
account from the same degree unto the Equator, and then Northward unto the
end of the staff, as before. But if you will apply your Cross unto those
stars, which have Northern declination: as are the right and left shoulder of
Orion: of which the one declineth from the Equator Northward six degrees and
the other five degrees, and: you must begin your reckoning, at like degrees,
unto which afterward you add as many more, from the first degree of the
Equator: in such order that the midst of the cross, and the nether end of the
staff, may exactly touch the Aequinoctiall, although the beginning was taken
higher and more to the North. In this manner may a cross staff be made
perfect, and applied to all sorts of stars, as may be seen in the Pattern.

THE MAKING OF A CROSSTAF


HOW TO DRAVV and use a true and perfect Sea Card.
FIrst with a large pair of compasses, you must draw a circle: and then
divide it with two diameters in 4. even quarters: every of which is to be
subdivided in four equal parts, to represent the sixteen points of the
compass. This done, draw first the lines of East, West, South and North: next
of Southest, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast. Then of west Southwest, East
Northeast, South Southeast. North Northwest, East Southeast, South southwest:
West Northwest, North, Northeast: And lastly the bywindes, as west and by
South, South and by west, and so forth, which must from point to point be
extended, until all the points be drawn.

Your Sea-card in this sort drawn: get in a readiness a perfect pattern of
some Sea-card: and fasten it under yours in such manner, that the lines of the
one, may answer the lines of the other, which done, set the^ both upon some
table of glass, against the light, and draw your Card with black lead, that
ye may after perfect it with your pen. For so shall you have an absolute, and
authentical Sea-carde.

It remaynes to entreat of the use of it. Suppose you are to sail from the
Lizard, or from Vshant to Spain or the Tercera (which is one of the Flemishe
Islands) here must you take a course fit for your voyage, placing your center,
or first prick in that point, so far distant in the Card from the said
countries, as you guess your self to be distant indeed: that so beginning at
this prick, for one or two 24. hours space, you may hold your course
Southwest or Southwest and by South. Then take two pair of compasses, and with
one pair measure the leagues, which by guess you you have run, extending it so
long, till the feet of both pair meet: There with a blunt needle or the
sharp foot of the compass, you shall make a new prick, which may be defaced
again with chalk.

But if you happen to shape an other course, to wit, to the South Southwest, or
west Southwest: then must you commit to memory how far you have sailed, and
run on this or that point. Wherefore it avails sometimes to cast out a
line a stearne, with a lead to it, fastened to a pole or some piece of wood,
and setting the compass aloft in the poope, to consider how much the ship
goes to the Leeward, or misseth of the intended course, that you may less
err in gessing your course. This done, with one pair of co^passes measure the
leagues from the last prick; but with the other the course or point: and there
again make a new prick: and so forwards. For one foot of the compass must be
set upon that line in the Card, which answers nearest to that point or
course on which you have sailed: and with the other foot must you seek the
ships course: But with the other pair you must compare with your kale how many
leagues you have run.

It is commendable every 24. hours, to prick the Card once, and set down
how much you have sailed and made: that in the degrees of the Card you may
see, what height you are in, and how all capes and coasts bear from you. It is
also a goodly matter for the master every morning and evening to write, or
cause to be written down, what course and upon what point he has run: that
afterward also in his Sea-card this may be noted and considered how the capes
and chanells bear from him: whosoever shall use such a Sea Card, as is here
described: shall enjoy thereby no small opportunity and commodity, in right
seafaring.

moveable Compass; which only divides the Horizon in his plain, and shows
absolutely, in what Azimuth or Vertical circle, the Sun or the Moon
stands: by which the floods are not governed. For experience teaches, that
the Sun entering into Cancer, in his greatest declination: in Spain, and
other countries having the like Elevation of the Pole, comes first into the
East point at eight of the clock in the morning, and into the West point at
four in the afternoon. But in our Climate about half an hour after eight,
and as much before five: So that in 8. or 9. hours, by this Compass account,
he finisheth his course from the East to the West: and contrariwise by night
from the West to the East in 15. or 16 hours. But this happens once a month
to the Moon, which sometimes ends her course from the East to the West
almost a whole hour sooner then the Sun, because she ascends above 5.
degrees more Northward then the Sun. Therefore you must understand, and
conceive in mind; as if the lines of the Compass were drawn from the Pole of
the world: For then, be the Sun and Moon high or low, ever at six of the
clock they are in the East and West. By which occasion, seeing those lines are
none other, then the hour circles, we have reduced those unto these: allowing
unto every line 45. minutes or three quarters of an hour: so that four lines,
make three hours; and eight, six. Thus may the tides be reckened by this
Table, for any place or day, so that the Moons age be known. Seek the day in
the right line, in which your place stands; and it shall show you the hour
and minute of the tide. Fol. 31.

AN INSTRVCTION TO KNOW HOW MANY LEAGVES YOU DO SAIL UPON EVERY POINT OF
THE COMPASS FOR A DEGREE: WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR COURSE BESIDES THE SOVTH OR
NORTH OVT OF THE RIGHT MERIDIAN LINE: And how much you decline toward the
East or west, upon every point or course, on this side or beyond the
Acquinoctiall.
Upon the South or North point, we hold still one Meridian, and you shall
sail to raise one degree. leag. 15. Upon the South and by west point, for one
degree. leag. 15. you are declined from the Meridian. leag. 3. Upon the South
South-vvest point, for one degree. leag. 16. you are declined from the
Meridian. leag. 6. Upon the Southvvest and by south point, for one degree.
leag. 18. you are then declined from the Meridian. leag. 10. Upon a Northeast
and a southvvest course, one degree is leag. 21. then are you declined from the
Meridian. leag. 15. Upon a southvvest and by west course, one degree is, leag.
27. then are you beside the Meridian. leag. 22. Upon a west southvvest course
your sail for one degree. leag. 40. then are you past the Meridian. leag. 36.
Upon a west and by south course, for one degree you run, leag. 78. then have
you left the Meridian Line. leag. 75. But sailing an East and West course, you
remain alvvayes in the same Parallel betvveene the Pole and the Equator,
declining neither Northvvardes, nor southvvardes: but keeping the same height
of the Pole continually. After this manner may you consider the other three
quarters.

A COMPASS AND TABLE CONTAINING THE READIEST AND SHORTEST WAY TO FIND OVT ALL THE TIDES ALONG ALL THE COASTS OF SPAIN, FRANCE England, Ireland, Flaunders,
Holland and Frisland, as well within the havens as without from shore: of
which compass the inner Circle shows the full seas upon all those coasts,
and in the havens themselves.
The other utter Circle shows the full seas off from shore along all those
said coasts in the channels, or other deepes.

(...) THIS UPPER HALF CIRCLE declares the Number of Leagues, that you must
sail upon each point of the compass, before you can raise or lay a Degree,
Southwards or Northwards.

The nether half circle contains the Number of Leagues which. you run from yor.
Meridian in altering of each point of the Compass



A DECLARATION OF THE TABLE FOLLOWING, WHICH Contains all the full seas and
ebs upon the same point.
THis is first to be noted, that all the places, which have their full seas on
the same poyncte, are sorted together in the table following, whose parts have
this order. The first number of the Column notes the age of the moon: the
two that follow signify the hours and minutes of the tide in those places
assigned. As for example. At the new or full moon, you have at Enchuysen, and
in all the places ranged with it, under the title of a South and North Moon,
full sea at 12. a clock. When the Moon is one day old, it shall be there
full sea at 12. of the clock 45. minutes: when she is two days old, at 1. a
clock. 30. minutes. A three days moon, at 2. a clock 15. min. and at four
days, at 3. a clock. Then is she horned, and has run the eight part of her
course. But when she shall be half full or one quarter old, it shall flow
still in those places till six a clock, morning and evening. After this the
tide shall be later every day then other, by three quarters of an hour. Thus
by this which has been said, the just time of the full sea, may be accounted
with ease, in what place soever.

As every 15. day, one point of the compass is given overplus to the full
moon: the cause is, that the compass has 32. points, and the moon but 30.
days. Whereupon in this table of Tides you must begin your account again at
the full or new moon, the 15. day. And when the moon is half a quarter old,
being Northeast, and Southwest, it shall be high water at 3. in the morning,
and afternoon. But on the quarter days an East and West moon at 6. a clock
morning and evening, shall cause full sea. For in this manner are the tides
reckoned of Pilotes and all Mariners every day.

A perfect Table to find out easily, upon each point of the Compass, what day
of the Moons age, and what hour and minute of the day or night you shall
have full Sea, or falling water in all places.

then fall together with a great whorling and noise over the said bank toward
the coasts of Flaunders, and therefore is that bank called the Galper.
Furthermore, in the North Sea, between the Riff and the White Sand, does the
flood turn with the Moon, and makes a strong tide there abouts, as likewise
upon the shoald called Brood veerthien. And in the right course, between

of a tide East, Southeast, and the rest N.E. At the Sept Isles, the flood
falls E. and by S. From the Sept Isles to S. Pol, along the shore, E. and
by S. From S. Pol to the Fourne, it falls E. and by S. From the Fourne to S.
Mathews poynct S. and by E. In the Bresont between Vshant and the Seames.
E.N.E. In the Ras of Fontenay, the flood falls thwart over the Rock called
the Emperesse, and makes a very great noise and tumbling, on the bank called
the Calfe. Furthermore upon all the coasts of Poictou, Gascoyne, Biscay,
Gallicia, Portugal and Spain, it falls always right of and on, to and fro.
FOrasmuch as of late days many skillful and experienced nauigators, and
shipmaisters have most earnestly trauayled to find out a sure and perfect way
whereby with the help of some certain signs, or instruments, as well the
Longitude of the place, from East to West, as the Altitude of the Pole between
South and North might in sailing be secretly known: yet have brought nothing to
light more then what long ago was well known to our ancestors, that is to
say: the use of certain instruments which in this thing are uncertain,
though very good and perfect in that use to the which they were first made: and
seeing that by them all there is not discovered any hidden way in the
firmament, by the which the Longitude of the place might certainly be observed
and used, I will not at this time make any mention thereof, but defer it till
a fitter and more commodious time, that I may then discover to all men what I
know therein. Wherefore I would entreat all those that happily might find
this strange, in a matter of such weight and importance not to be grieved
thereat, but patiently expect that which remains.

An exact description of the depths and soundings near the diverse provinces of
our navigations, and first of Gascoigne Poictou and Brittayn.
WIthout Garumna the river of Bourdeaux there is 14. fatham depth: but when you
come within sight of Cordam tower, but 30. fatham.

Over against the coast of Poictou, 16. leagues without Oleron you have 25.
fath. depth: but coming near the land of Poictou, 8. leagues from the shore
you have 35. fatham. In the channel between Porthuis and Heys, it is 30.
fatham deep: and as much in the channel of Heys as also between Heys and
Belile is the same depth. Without the channel it is 35. fatham deep, but
within are 25. fatham only: without Heys two Kenninges off there is found 45.
fatham.

22. Leagues Southwardes of Belile you have 70. fatham: but nine leagues from
the Northwest point of that Island toward the Southwest, is 60. fatham depth.
And over against the midst of Belile in 40. fatham depth you shall see land. In
your course between Belile and the Seems, you may come no near then 50. or
45. fatham. If you sail from Belile west and by North, when you are against
Gloyland, you shall find 60. fatham depth: without and within the rock which
stands off Gloyland to the seawardes, you have 40. fatham water. In 65. fatham
depth without the west Penmarques you may sail Northwest and by west without
the Seems, but by night come no nearer then in 55. fatham, for the ground is
gross and red sand full of round flints: half a league west Southwest of the
Seems, is a ledge of rocks, where you have 7. fatham depth: but between the
Seems, and the rocks there is 50. fatham water.

In the channel between the Seems and Heissand, called Vshant you have 55.
fath. depth, the ground is gross red sand mingled with little round stones red
and black, near to Vshant there is 45. fatham, but within it is of an unequal
and variable depth. Southwestwardes almost six leagues off Vshant you have 70.
fatham, and the ground is fine white sand mingled with little white shelles and
other small things like needles: and then is Vshant East from you: but if the
sand be gross and white mingled with great and white shells, then is it
Southeast to you. But if you doubt of these grounds go Northerly, if your sound
be deeper, then you are toward the Seems: if not so deep, then are you in
the channel almost North of Vshant.

Between vshant and Obeurac in the trade it is 60. fatham deep: between
vshant, and the Isles of Silly or sorlinges in the midst of the channel there
is 70. fatham depth. If you sail between the Seems, and Vshant in 70. fatham
water, the ground will be of little black stones easy to be broken, and of
yellow earth or clay: but if you find red and hard sand, go Northward till
you happen on white sand mingled with long strakes: and then without doubt you
sail in the channel.

If setting from Cizarga, you sail N. northeastward in the Spanish seas
toward Vshant and find your self in 80. fatham, ye are 14. or 15. leagues
off Vshant: but coming nearer you shall have 70. fatham water, and be 10.
leagues distant of Vshant: But if you find the ground to be yellow shells and
little black stones, then are you toward the Seems: wherefore you must with
the tide bear off northward, to shun Vshant until you find white sand and
things like needles, for such are the grounds of the channel,

Between Vshant and the I Will Base when you sail at 4. fatham water you are 4.
leagues off the shore: but by night come no nearer then 25. fatham: when you
are two leagues off Obcurac, you shall find 25. fatham depth: but 8. leagues
off the Sept Islands you have 55. fatham.

A league without the rocks of Obeurac there is a blind or hidden rock. So
that if you are to sail upon a board between the Fourns and Obeurac, come no
near that blind rock, then 40. fatham, but Eastwardes you may sail in 30.
or 25. fatham.

If a ship sailing west Southwest, and Southwest and by west of the Isles of
Sylly or Sorlinges, at 80. fatham water, be found by the crossestaffe or the
Astrolabe to be under 49. degrees and 15. minutes of Altitude, she is 26.
leagues from land, and must go East and by North till she get 66. fatham
water. For then certainly she is in the channel between the Isles of Sylly and
Vshant: and then if she be bound for England she must sail more Northward, and
between the lands end and the Lilard she shall have 55. fatham depth.

A diligent description of the soundinges and grounds between Ireland,
England, and Normandy.
THree leagues without the Isles of Dorsey under Ireland it is 45. fatham deep.
In the channel between Dorsey and Cape clear is 42. or 43. fatham. The
channel from Cape Clear to the Islands of Saltees, has 45. fatham: But two
leagues off Ireland it has but 40. Between the Isles of Saltees and Milford
it is 44. fatham deep and between Londay and the Isles of Sylly 38. fath. In
the mid way between the Isles of Sylly and Milford it is 44. fatham deep: but
plain North of Sylly 40. and 42. fatham. Near England by the lands end the
channel is of 50. fatham depth.

A ship that comes from Cape Finisterre sailing North Northeast, if she has
80. fatham sounding, she is 20. leagues off the shore: and the ground is small
black stones mingled with great red sand. In the same course when you have but
60. fatham water, you are within 12. or 14. leagues off the shore, yet shall
you not so soon ken land as you would think: for you shall a great while have
60. fath. depth, for it is at the North parts of the channel, about the Isles
of sylly. Between Vshant and the Isles of sylly the channel is 70. fatham
deep. On the Southside of the Isles of sylly the ground is small red stones
and fine white sand. Over against the Lizard and Falmouth 4. leagues from
shore it is 52. fatham deep. Betwixt Foy and Plimmouth sound in the midst of
the channel it is 60. fatham deep. Between the Lyzard and the start bear no
nearer the shore then 35. fatham. You may cast anchor in the trade or channel
in 25. fatham, and so shall you lie within the foreland stream. Between
Plimmouth and the Sept Isles in the midst of the channel it is 55. fatham
deep. But 4. leagues South Southwest of Plimmouth, it is but 35. fatham. South
Southeastward of the midland of the start, it is 45. fatham deep: but from
thence 5. or 6. leagues Southeast you have 54. fatham. In the channel between
the Caskets and Portland it is 40. fatham deep: and a league Northward off the
Isle of Alderney is a hole or pit 80. fatham deep: all the rest of the
channel between Portland and the Isle of Alderney is of equal deapth viz.
40. fatham. When you are within kinning of Portland, your sounding is 34.
fatham: and 3. leagues off the Isle of VVight 36. fatham: as also two leagues
Eastward of Beachy. Between picardie and the Isle of VVight the channel in
the midst is 38. fatham deep. Between VVinchelsey and picardy 24. fatham.
The shoald between the Heads called the Vrovven-sand, has but three fatham
depth and a half: but on the Southside of it there is 24. fatham. And in all
the fair way betwetne Zeland and Dover it is 24. fatham deep.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION of the depths of the North Sea from Englands foreland.
or the mouth of Flaunders.
IN the channel and course from Englandes fore-land and sands of Flaunders, you
have 24. fatham depth: but three leagues Northwest and by west of the country
of Zierickze, there is a shoald commonly called Borbreck, which has 4. fatham
depth. Without this shoald the Channel of Zealand is 26. fatham deep.
Northwest of Harlem, 8. or 9. miles within the sea there begins a shelf,
commonly called de breed Verthien, reaching alongest the coast of Holland to
the plain of Ameland where it ends. Over against Harlem and Egmond is 13.
14. and 15. fatham depth, and the ground is of all Oase mingled with black
sand like unto Mustard-seede. The said shelfe or shoald, has 15. 16. or 17.
fatham depth, between Texel, and Vlieland, where the ground is gross red
sand, 6. or 7. leagues from shore, for there the shoald is narrower then it is
toward the Southend. The Channel without the shoald between zealand, and
Texel is 26, fatham deep even as far as the shoald which the fishers call
Doggsant.

In the Channel on England side over against Yermouth is 32. fatham depth, but
right against Flamborough and Scarborough point 38. fatham whereas the white
shelf commonly called Doggsant begins reaching into the North seas to the
channel of Helichland. This shoald where it is within kenning of Flamborough
point, has but 9. or 10. fatham depth: But when in the same sand you find 12.
fatham depth: then Texel is from you Southest almost 30. leagues, but when you
are come to 16. fatham depth, then are you within 21. leagues South Southeast
of Vlieland.

A ship that comes from the Riffe, finding 18. fath. depth on the foresaid
sand, is then 20. leagues South and by East of Vlieland: but coming to 22.
fatham, must then sail toward the Vlie S. and by westward, and South
southwestward. But if in the Channel of Helichland 24. 26. fatham depth be
found, then must you sail Southwest, and S.w. and by S. and then are you come
to the Scellinghe, but when as in Helichland sound you have 27. fatham, then
are you altogether to the Eastwards of it. Between the Riffe, and the shoald
called Doggersant, the channel is 26. fath. deep: without the channel
westwards it is 32. fath. deep. A ship that comes out of the English
straightes, or out of zealand, having at the riffe 24. fatham depth is distant
from the No's in Norvvay 18. leagues almost North and by East: but having 20.
fatham is 16. leagues from it Northward: and finding but 18. fatham is then 18.
leagues off it, North and by west. The course from thence to the Holmes is 12.
leagues North and by E. And from thence toward the point of Scakghens 18.
leagues Northeast and by East. There is a rock of one only fatham depth
standing Northeast, and Northeast and by East of the Holmes two leagues from
the shore.

The depth of the Northern Ocean near unto Iutland and Ameland.
IN the sea without Iutland a mile distant from Dodenberg there is a banck
called Reef-horn, stretching out 8. leagues w. and by S. which in some places
has but three fatham depth, and in some places may be sailed over, and become
a road for a Northwest and a North wind, in 20. fatham depth. From Ameland
toward the sea, the ground is gross sand, red, and black mingled with
shelles. From thence sailing Southward in 16. fatham three hours, you shall
come to the smooth Sea of Ameland, where your ground is fine sand mingled with
shelles. North from Schellinghe in 24. fatham depth is found altogether fine
white sand, and afterward in 18. fatham white and black sand mingled.

Vlieland has white sand mingled with shelles, and thin black sand, in 16.
fatham depth: from the west end of Vlieland is great and red sand mingled with
black like unto mustardseede, about 6. or 7. leagues from the shore. At the
East end of schellingh to the seawards at 18. fatham water is found fine white
sand mingled with black, having in it things like needles. Over against
Borckom in the vvester Ems at 17. or 18. fatham depth, land may be seen: the
ground is of gross grauelly sand. At 14. fatham depth may Ameland be kend: but
schellingh at 16. fatham: and Vliland at 15. or 16. fatham water. Any man may
by night trust to these measures. At the North Hook of Texel, land may be
seen at 16. fatham depth. Holland is seen at 14. or 15. fath. water when you
sail within the shoald called the breed Veerthiene, which begins at the
Northwest of Harlem, and stretches along the coast of Holland to the west
end of Vliland, and is 7. or 8. leagues distant from the shore.

The soundinges and grounds of Iutland near the point of the Cimbrians
commonly called Schagen, or Schaw.
A Great league west and by North from the schavv is 35. fatham depth. North
northeast a great league of the corner of this point is found 38. fatham depth.
And when the point is northwest from you, then you have 17. fatham water.
Between this point and Lesou, the channel is 20. fath. deep, and the ground
like clay or dirt. Betwixt Anhout and VVaersberg in the midst of the Channel
is 22. fatham water. Between Lesou and Anhout the ground is firm and stony:
near VVaersbergh is a shoald of 17. fatham depth. Between Anhout and Col is
another shoald of 17. fatham: where sometimes it is troublesome like a
whirepoole.

The depths and grounds of the Balthic or Eastern seas.
Between Oeland and Gothland the soundinges are unequal sometimes of 20.
sometimes of 23. fath. the ground of black and stony gross sand like unto
Peace. When the South end of Oeland is two leagues distant from you westwardes
you have 27. fatham water, where also you may commodiously gage water. But when
the chapel in Sudernoorden bears west Northwest off you: then have you 31.
fatham depth, and ground fit to gage water. Over against the rock in the fair
way is 52. fatham and a claye ground but fit for gaging. Between the greater
and lesser Carla you have 14. fath. depth under which is safe road for ships.
There is a shoald between Houburg and Ostergard containing 24. fath. depth,
the ground is great red sand: but hardly from thence can you ken Gothland out
of the top. There is also to the Eastward another shoald of 36. fath. depth,
which when you are past, you have more then 40. fatham water. When the point
of Righ is 3. leagues Southeast from you, then have you 30. fatham depth: but
when it is from you half a league South south-easterly you have 15. fatham:
the ground is white sand. But when it bears west a small league from you,
then you shall find 16. fatham water. Over against Heel half a league from
the shore it is almost 32. fatham deep. The road for ships at Heel has
25. fatham depth. Between Moan and Falsterborn is 14. fatham depth. Between
sted and Falsterborn in the very channel it is but 12. fath. deep: near
Falsterborn it is full of shoaldes: but near Sted you have 13. fatham water.
Between Drakerriff and Southolmen, which is more shoaldie, there is 5. fatham
depth wanting two foot. From thence toward the Sound, it is sometime deeper,
as 6. 7. 8. 9. or 10. fatham.

A DESCRIPTION AND POVRTRAICT OF THE GREATEST PART OF THE SEACOASTES OF EVROPE.
FOr as much as, these particular Sea Chartes, which I have set forth of the
Western, Eastern and Northern Navigations, with the rest, which I hope
hereafter at the first opportunity to publish, have their original and
beginning from this general Charte of the Sea Coasts of Europe: wherein you may
plainly perceive, how the particular Countries are annexed and joined each to
other, and every one of them in his right place, distance, point of compass,
degrees, minutes. etc. I have therefore thought necessary to place this
general table (or pourtraict) at the very beginning of this book before all
the rest: to the end, you may thereby the better seek and find out the
particulars, observing the order and method of this book. Thinking it
needelesse to make any larger discourse thereof for the use of Saylyng.
Considering, that the particular descriptions with their Charts being taken out
of this general and enlarged, do very sufficiently, teach and show, both the
countries themselves, and their commodities (so they be rightly examined)
according to the true art of Navigations, employinge therewithal such
necessary instruments as appertain thereunto.

A SHORT INSTRVCTION OF THE FORM AND fashion of Buys, Beakons, and other
marks, etc. which are set for Shoaldes, Sands, or hidden Rocks, as they are
marked in the particular Chartes of the Fliestreame, Eemse, Weeser, the Elue,
Meersdiep, and the Mase.
Upon all the Rivers and Streams of Holland, Friesland, and Zeland, the Buys
at the upper end are round and great, and at the lower end, small and sharp
like unto this mark 1 buoy being made black with Pitche or Tar, lying for the
most part upon the right hand in Saylinge out, and on the lefthand in
coming in: And on the other side for sands, flats and shoaldes do commonly
stand the Beakons and other higher and more apparent marks made of Oasyers,
after this manner, 2 beacon that they may be the farther of perceived: And
where there is danger of poincts of Rocks, Sands, and shoaldes, that stand
out, there are (that you may shun them) white Tons or Buys made after this
fashion, barrel marker which do always he upon the contrary side of the
foresaid black buys. The eye marks, whereby you may assuredly find these
buys and other marks, are sufficiently declared in the description before
each Charte. But, you must understand that the Buys and marks are herein
noted, as they wear Anno. 1582. Moreover because the depthes and channels of
the Rivers do yearly shift and change their places, both by reason of the
uncertainty and instabilitie of the sandy grounds, and for that the
entringes and mouths of the Rivers do daily wax wider and brother: therefore
these streams are to be tried by soundyng, and to be sailed in with skillful
and experienced Pilots and masters. The land marks placed at the entries of
Rivers I have, for streightnes of room, marked thus. land marker But where
there is false road and ground fit for Ankering, I have set down this form
of an Anchor. anchor The Figures which are placed in all Haue^s Rivers, Streams
and Channels, as well in the main sea as elsewhere, upon all the shoaldes, Sands
and Rocks, do signify the depth of the places, as 1. 2. 3. 10. 12. Fatham,
and so forth: which is always to be understood at half flood or ebb. The
little Crosses marked in this manner alonge the Coasts near Islandes and
elsewhere, betoken hidden and dangerous Rocks, of which you must carefully
beware: And where the double crosses are, there lie greater Rocks covered with
the water. These marks in the Chartes are made thus. ^. ^. ^. ^. ^.

A TRVE DESCRIPTION OF THE VLIE AND THE MARSDEEP, TWO OF the notablest Rivers
of all Holland, from the Northern unto the Southern sea.
HE that will sail from the North sea up to Amsterdam, or Enchuisen, by the
entry of the VLIE, commonly called Noordergat, must so direct his course that
the Lande-marke of Schelling may exactly answer to the three Downs, and the
Black down, must be directly opposite to the midst of the high White down.

Then appears the first Buy, from which he shall sail unto the second South
and by East, or South and by West: according as the wind and tide will serve.
From thence until he come to the Buy, which lies upon the Buske, South and by
West, or South, still carefully observing your tide. From thence let him sail
unto the Buy in Moncksloot, South, or Southe and by West: thence to Longsand,
South and by East: then to Wolfshouk south east and by South, but till he come
to Cashoucke, let him keep south south east.

The eye mark of Cashoucke is, when the Tower of Franike appears near the
haven of Harling. From Cashouck unto Schutsande, the course is East south east,
the marks whereof are these, viz. That Cornwerde on the East side is right
opposite to Bolswerde, and Winald is discerned above the Castle of Harling.
From Schutsand he must sail to Swaenbalg South east, where the Buy lies with
these marks. viz. When Boldeswerde appears on the Eastside of the broad
tower, or the high buildynge, on the Southside of Cornewerde: But when
Bolswerde is perceived between Destin and Cornewerd, then may he plie that
reach up or down at his pleasure. From Swaenbalg he may pass to Middleground
South south east, and the marks hereof are: when the two picked steeples of
Harlynge on the Southside, are right against two other Towers on the Northside.
The way from Middlegrounde unto Idelhooeck, and the West of Worcum lies
Southward, and then Coldum shows it self on the South end of Hinlopen, which
is the mark for the Buy of West Worcum: From thence unto the Buy that
leads to Bocht South south east, where Pandagra appears standing at the
Southside of Volwerd in a valley: and when you shall perceive Pandagra near
the houses, keep the right form of the Tower in your sight, until you come
to the Buy, that lies upon the flat of Freislande: there is deep water, and
that reach stretches, South Southwest: From thence to Creile South and by
West, the marks whereof are, when Mirnys touches the South parts of the
Cliffe, and the Corn milles appear on the Westside of Medenblicke. The way
from Creyl to Crepelsand is South south east, and South east and by East, the
marks of the Buy of Creplesand are Enchuisen standing by Venhuysen and
Broocke nigh unto Hem: From hence you may sail unto the first Buy in
Hillegat, South south east, and South and by East, and then up toward the
Beacon, South and by East, but from the innermost Buy unto the Road of
Enchuisen, South and by West.

Moreover sailing from Enchuisen to Texel, he must (as the wind and tide
suffer) begin his course, from the Buy that is Northward in the going forth,
(commonly called Noordergat) North north west, or North and by West, until
Brook may be kenned near Hem, where he shall find the Buy of Creplesand.
From thence he shall go to the Wicker mark or Beacon of the said Creplesand
Northwest, and when Lytebrooke is seen near Hem, he shall find out this
mark: From whence he may sail unto the South Buy upon the Flats of Wiring,
North west and by West, having regard to the wind and tide. This Buy is
known when the Twisch by Almerdorpe and Brook do show between two Heyrickes,
and the Western tower of Wiringe perceived near unto the houses. Then he may
pass toward the middle Buy Northwest and by North, until he find that the
Wind mill of Wyringe stands at the South-ende of the houses that are out of
the town. From the middle Buy unto the Northern, we sail North northwest,
the marks are, when the two piked Steeples are one: and on the East side of
the Buy there is a deep Poole fit for great Ships: from thence he may sail
to Vlieter, North northwest, and North and by west, keepyng Medenbliche, and
the Buy in one, so long as he can see them, and keep still his course North
and by West, until he come to Nesse, where he shall find a Buy on the
Eastside, and there over against stands a mark made of Wicker or Basket
work upon the Nesse: the tokens whereof are, when the Mill upon the shore is
opposite to ye valley, which is upon the West side of the shore, and the tower
standing toward the west, joins to the West part of the houses. From
thence to Vogelsand, West north west, sometimes windyng about. But when he
comes near Vogelsand, let him take heed, that Horn tower in Texel may be
seen near the houses which stand under Geest, and keep them so in sight
until he come to the Merchants Road, there may he Anchor before Geest in
Texel, where he shall think best. But if he will fourth into the Ocean, his
course is to the New Deep, and shun the Shoaldes of Geest, two Gables length
from the shore side of Huisdune, until he come to the shoalde called Dry
Hake, and keep the shore marks which stand upon Huisdune five foot one
from the other. Then must he hold on his course to the Sea, by the entry or
channel of Marsdiep, commonly called Spaignarsgat: for Keysars plat has two
Fadam water at half flood, so that the said shore marks may be almost joined
together.

And if coming from the Sea, he would bear in with the entry of Marsdiep,
called Spaignarsgat, he must set Wammes or S. John's tower on the Northside of
the high Down of Texel, and the Landmarkes upon Huisdune, the distance of 5.
foot from each other, which being so set, and kept, he may enter ye channel.
But if he will enter the mouth of Maersdeep called Dorley, let him keep the
Landmarke and the Spear steeple of Texell a Sail breadth a sunder, and let him
hold on his course until the Landmarkes of Huisdune appear five foot each
from the other, saylyng East and by south toward Huisdune. If he will go in
at the entry called Ebbegat, let him keep likewise the foresaid marks of
Dorley, five foot a sunder. But if you will sail in at Lantdiep, called
Swidergat: set the Church of Geest even with the shore of Huisdune, and so
enter. Afterward let him keep along the shore of Huisdune, about the length
of two Cables of: until he have passed the New Deep, then let him conde the
ship Northeast, until he come to the Road where great ships and Huyes lie
near to Geest in Texell, where he may cast Anchor in. 10. or 12. fatham.

It would be too tedious to set down all the Trades and Traffic of all the
cities and Towns upon this South sea: notwithstanding I will touch it in few
words: There is Amsterdam that most renowned Mart town, which in all Europe
has not her peer, for variety and plenty of all Trades, especially of all
kind of Eastern and Northern commodities, Wares and Marchandizes, and
abundance of Factors.

There stands likewise upon this Sea the famous city of Enchuisen: where
such abundance of Hering is taken, not far from the town, at sometimes of
the year in this South sea, as suffiseth (as may be daily seen by experience)
at one time to fraught many Huyes, Boats and Pinckes for merchandise up
through all the Maze, whereof some are dried or smoked, called Tybucking,
especially about Christide, which are accounted daynties among noble men, and
are used for Newyeares gifts to the better sort. But those that we do call
March hearing are not so good, notwithstanding great plenty of them is
carried up the River of Elue into Germany, Boheme, Hungary, and further down
the River of Danube toward Turkey or the lesser ASIA where the same are
sold, spente, and greatly accounted of.

And HORN that noble city is seated toward that South sea, where besides
the Traffic on the Seas, the Country yields such stoare and plenty of the
best cheese and Butter, that it is rather to be wondered at, then to be written
of, which all Germany, Brabant, Spain, and many other countries can
sufficiently testify.

A Description of the two famous Rivers Streams or Channells the Fly and the
Maersdeepe streaching up in to the Sowther sea before Enchuysen unto Amstredam
with all the sands barckes and Showldes, lying upon the said streams


A TRVE DESCRIPTION AND POVRTRAICT OF THE MAZE, TOGETHER with the entries of
the Goer in South Holland, and the Vere in Zealand, and also of the Wielinghe.
FIrst if you will find out the right depth or channel of the Maze, set the
Tower of the Bryll, South east and by east from you, and sail on so until on
the Larboorde Haghe steeple appear as within two mastes length wide of the
South side of the square tower of Mounster, and on the Starrebord the
watchtower of Eastuoren be brought to the West end of the town. These are the
marks of the South entry, commonly called the Suidergate, and there shall you
find the uttermost or first buy. The entries which lie near the Bryll by the
shoaldes of the Dary or Botkill, are at this day commodious: For there are
buys fastened, and then the Brill bears nearehand South-east from you. Then
must you sail to the point near the Bulwark from buy to buy, even till you
come to the Brill, where along the shore about a Cables length off, is good
road and harborough unto the old Maze. Thence you cross over by the Breach,
called the Sceur, the marks for it are when Couwerscie, and the trees are come
together. Thence must you sail up to Roterdam in the midst of the Channel.

But to enter the Goer, set Goer steeple West off the watchtower: set small
sail a long the shore a while, until you are past the watchtower, shunning
the point, least you strike on the start, or tail sand, that stretches down
from the lands. Then bring the Windmill which stands in the Oelkens platt,
5. foot distant Northward from Diricsland tower, and enter the port of Goer,
where in the Channel you shall anchor at 6. or 7. fatham.

But if you will go into Brouwersgate, and go clear of the shoalde called
Drooghericke, which stretches down from Goer, take heed that the land marks
of Schowen (called Zericksea) do join together, until Outdorpe be joined with
Goer steeple. Then without regard of the shore marks, keep these towers
joined together, till the land mark be one with the Down, which commonly is
called white Blencke, or Lange wit sand. Then with all speed leave the said
towers because of the Scere which reaches from the farthest parts of Goer,
for the tide sets so strongly between Droogerecke and Scere, that it would
with his violence carry the ship upon the tail of the Scere. Wherefore bearing
on as near the shore of Ziericsea, as you can, you shall come to
Brouwershaven, where you may anchor at 7. or 8. fatham.

But if you will enter the Vere, see that East Caple may be right against
Middleborough South-east from you, and so sail up until you have brought the
steeples of Cortigien in one, then set forwards by Polder, alias the Hook,
and when you are past the same, pass on to VValcheren sailing still near the
bank until you come to Teruere.

To sail into Dorley, bring the tower of Flushing East and by South, and
VVulpen East South East, and so cross over Dorley, for it is there deep and
broad. The true marks where of are when East Souburge stands distant almost
one pace Northward from West Souburge: those keep in the same distance,
until the steeples of Bruges alias Brugghellingh be brought together: for
there it is three fatham deep, but it is requisite that the steeples of the
two Souburges do shut and open, and that Flushing be East and by South from
you, and so hold on the Dorley.

If you will enter the VVielinghe bring Terdoes Church distant from the West
end of the steeple of Liswegen a ships length, which you must so keep until
west-caple appears at the East end of the Church of Heist. For when Terdoes
Church is brought one with Liswegen you are within the entry of the VVielinge.
Then keep the Tower which is on the East side of Heist a ships length off,
until you shall have six fatham water: Then let the little tower of
Blanckenberge alias t'Hauentorenken be brought one with the watch tower of
Blankenberge, before the light tower of Hiest, be one with the steeple of
Heist, then shall you be clear of the Pol. Therefore entering ye VViclings let
the little Tower of Blankenberge (as I have said) first touch the watch tower,
before Heist be one with his Lantern: sail then East North east, bearing
somewhat toward the East, and keep Blankenbergs watch tower between the said
little tower and the town house, and so have you the best of the Channel. But
when you shall see on the starboord side the Tower of VVotkirke 2. sails
breadth south from the Northern Tower, and right before you another Tower
distant the space of 5. foot Northwarde from the steeple of the Abbey of
Middleborough, then have you the right marks to sail thorough the VVicling, as
long as you can see the said steeple: but having lost the sight thereof Saint
Lambertes steeple shows it self in a valley at the East side of Catsand,
which are the sure marks to sail into the deep: and when you shall have gone
so far that the watch tower of Blankenberge appears between the little
tower of the same and the Towne-house, then have you gotten the right course:
Then bring the Lantern of Heist to his steeple before the watch tower of
Blankenberge be joined to the little tower of the same, and you shall go
clear of the sands called the French Pole. But if all the aforesaid marks at
one self time come together, you shall run right upon it, where there is but
the depth of one fatham: yet notwithstanding in calm weather a ship ye draws
18. foot water may at half flood pass over the sands called the Caybanke.
And if any man entering the VVicling will go out by Dorley, he must keep
VVest-caple and Cnock distant a sails breadth, and must sail North-west
until the steeples of Souburge be separate five foot a sunder: then set West
North-west until you have Flusshing East and by South, and so shall you not
endaunger your self upon the shoalds. There are shoaldes in the inner part of
VViclinge commonly called the Vlack vanne gatt. When the watch tower of
Blankenberge is one with the Town house, you are then past them. But when you
have gotten ten fatham, sail toward Flushing two Cables distant from the
shore of VValkeren, until you come to the castle of Ramekens: but take heed
you be not carried with the swift tide upon Natgat, where it sets inward with
great violence.

The traffic and Merchandises of this part of Zealand cannot easily be
described, notwithstanding there is in Brabant upon the Scheld, the city of
Antwerp, sometimes the most famous mart town in all the world, where there was
great plenty and abundance of all nations, and of all precious commodities
which were brought thither from Spain, and other Countries in great ships and
hulkes. Besides there is in Zealand an Island called VValkeren, where the
famous mart town of Middleborough is situate, whither all kind of French
and Spanish wines, being brought in great abundance, are there sold and
vented. There is also within that Isle a little town called Armu, where the
course bay salt which is brought thither in great quantities from France and
Spain, is purified, and made white, and from thence is transported and
dispersed throughout all Europe.

And Roterdam stands upon the Maze, where there is great store of little
ships, and boats called Buisen and Pincken, and much traffic and intercourse
of marchaunts for pickell herring.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF FLANDERS WITHAL THE SANDS,
FLATS, BANCKS AND SHOALDS THEREOF.
WHen you sail out of the Wielinge toward the straights between Callis and
Dover, called the Heads, you must bring the watch tower of Blanckenberge one
with the steeple thereof, and then Westcappel, ioignes with the Lantern of
Heyst. But when Lisweghen is brought one with Terdoes church, then are you in
the mouth of the Wielynge: hold then west southwest, bearing a little west and
by north: then have you the true depth in 6. fatham water at half flood.

Or else you may take this course to sail thorough the Wielinge, your leading
mark is to keep Middleborough steeple a little sail breadth open to the south
wards of the watch tower, and so sail west southwest upon that mark as far
as you can see it, that being out of sight, go west southwest and borow of
either side at your best advantage, as the wind serves, until Blanckenbourgh
be south southeast from you, then go west upon the flood and west southwest
upon the ebb, till you be in 12. fatham, then shape your course, for you are
clear.

There lies near Blankenberge a long bancke called Witsand, stretching along
the shore unto Winduyn. It chances that mariners are here often deceived, who
reckoning themselves to be entered the wielinge are shut up betwixt the same
and the shore: wherefore if they that come in from the sea would shun this
bank, let them set the broad steeple of Liswegen eastward thereof, and so
bearing along the shore in 6. fatham water they shall go clear of it.

When wotkerke is one with Blankenberge: and S. Catalina shuts into Ostend,
you are then before the mouth of the wielinge: but when the steeple of Ostend
is one with S. Catherins then you run upon the shallow called Trix, which
always turns about in manner of a whirlpoole by reason of the violent meeting
of sundry currents and tides: and there you have.5. fatham water. Over against
Ostend there lies a bank of sand a dutch mile from the town, called the old
Morebank having.2. fadam water at the lowest ebb: There is also another lyeng
west and by north of Ostend called Dijestall, that at the greatest ebb has 3.
fatham water.

Moreover when the Down Friery called the Broers stands south from you, you
are within the Broers bank: But when Dunkerke bears south and by west from
you, you are past the most dangerous and uttermost part of this bank. There
stands an high and ragged down west of Newporte, over against which this
bank has his beginning which reaches four dutch leagues north northwest
into the sea, and does lie from Newport northwest, but when you have Newporte
southeast and by south, you are past the bank.

There are also two or three dangerous banks, northwest, and northwest and by
west from Dunkerk, the first lies from the shore two dutch miles, and the
other three. The midst is called Poldervan-dijckt: But that which is called
Ruting: is most dangerous for that it lies in the fair way and in the very
entry of the Channel. Either of them has 2. fatham at low water, which you
must warily pass by.

There are also two other Banks north west and by north from Dunkerke, almost
ii. dutch miles distant from the shore, whereof one is called Dristall, the
other Quaehanck, which at lowest water are but 2. fatham and an half: you may
safely sail along the coasts of Flaunders, between the shore and the
shoaldes at 5. or 6. fatham, but it is dangerous for great vessels because the
waves both in ebbing and flowing do for the most part set thwart over the
shoaldes.

North northeast from Callis cliffe, three dutch miles from the shore lies
another shoald which at low water has 3. fatham. There lies also an other
Bancke or shoald of the same depth almost two dutch miles from Graueling.

There is safe road and harborowe under the tower called the Oldman for a
north wind, where you have 7. or 8. fatham.

In the very midst of the streightes there lies a shoald 4. fathams deep:
of which both by south and by north there are 20. and 22. fatham: Right before
the entry of the river of Some two dutch miles into the sea it is not past 5.
or 6. fatham deep.

He that will sail to Deep, setting out from the tower called the Oldman,
must go forth south southwest, so shall he ariue to the entry of Deep: at the
very mouth thereof on the Larrbord are marks made of Oasiers but it must be
half floude before a great ship be able to come in.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLES OF ALDERNEY, GARNZEY AND IERZEY, AND THE
QVASKETTES CALLED the Kaskets, together with all the coasts, rocks, and
shoalds, lying thereabouts both within and without.
FEcam bears westward from Deep 7. leagues, and is a bard haven: Beyond it
lies the point of Strusard, from whence you may sail to Seyne head S. S. W.
Newhauen (called Hable-neuf) stands inward from thence half a league, where
you may anchor, to stay for the tide and sail up the Seyne to Roane, so that
before the tide be unbent you pass over the first traues or Drybancks: and the
way from Newhauen to Honfleur lies S. E. But you must sail along the south
shore, because the north side of the river to Quillebeuf is full of shoaldes,
and then are you through the first traues: But you must be very heedfull of that
strong spring of the Sea (called the Bar or bear) in which the tide sets
so violently and swiftly, that a ship can scarce be kept up with all her ankers
and cables. But all this reach is to be sounded.

Southwest of Seyne head lies a bank of three fatham: and before the dike of
Cadom (called the Fosse of Caen) there are banks, which you may sail round
abouts by the channel of Caen, which is a bard haven.

Six leagues or thereaboutes toward the west, stands the Cape of Cherbourge
where for a rough northwest wind is good harbor: there lie sands overthwart
the bay, which at low water have but two fatham depth.

Against a north and northwest wind you may safely anchor under Alderney by the
little bard haven, in a sandy bay hard abourd the shore: where it is 7. or 8.
fatham deep.

If you will enter the race of Blancquerd, you may run in, either in the
midst of the channel, or at your discretion between the cape of Haghe, and
Alderney: for you may borow the north shore along upon 10. or 12. fatham,
until you are past the Sans, which is a row or ledge of hidden rocks, to be
left on the starreboord: there cast anchor in the channel at 7. or 8. fatham,
and against the broad tower. The race of Blanquerd reaches inwardly south and
by east, and south south east: But if you will sail on the backside of the
great Isle of Iersey, you must cross over, and anchor under the same where you
please for in every place thereaboutes is good ground.

And there is an other safe road for ships, under the main of Saint Malo
(called Conkall) you may sail into the same both by East and west: before it
lies a ledge of rocks above water. The bay is great and the harbor safe,
having at low water 4. or 5. fatham. From this road you may descrie the Isle
of Ierzey right over against the same, almost 5. dutch miles off.

But, if by reason of a northwest tempest, you are driven to seek safe
ankering under Garnezcy, or elsewhere, you must set for Garnezcy or the little
Isle of Arm, avoiding on the west side the great rocks of the Quasquettes
(called the Kaskets) sailing south and by east until the castle which stands
in the sea be brought to the south point of Garnezcy. Then sail between the
greater and the lesser Island, where you may anchor by south or by north from
the castle, where you please, in 7. or 8 fathams. But if you will anchor at the
south side of the said Island, bear aloof to sea-ward from the outmost point
of the land, because all that shore is full of rocks: after you have doubled
that point you may anchor at 12. or 14. fatham: you may go out again Eastward
between the Isles Arm and Sarke, or seek there for road as you list. Sarke
stands from the Cape of the Haghe, or the trade of Alderney, 6. dutch leagues
south and by west.

Although these Islandes lie near the coasts of France they are
notwithstanding subject to the Crown and government of England: their trade
is little or nothing at all, and therefore unknown to us.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS BETWEEN S. MALO, AND BEYOND THE PORT
OF ROSCOVV.
IF you come from the Western sea, and seek harbor under Garnezey, you must
sail in by the south shore of the land, and may Anchor in the Channel at 20.
or 25. Fatham near to the sharp tower or else where at your pleasure. Ierzey
stands from Garnezey southeast almost 5. dutch leagues, where is also safe
road for ships. S. Malo is distant from Ierzey. 8. leagues toward the
south and is a bard haven: at the entry whereof are rocks, between which you
must sail into the river, and cast anchor before the city at 5. or 6. fatham.
And there lies a bancke westward two or three dutch leagues from the town,
under which there is safe road in 5. fatham water: There is also an Island
called Brybac standing from thence three dutch leagues, which you may sail
round about, and cast Anchor where you will. And 2. leagues from thence there is
a river called Lantrilliers, which has many rocks and shoaldes on the west
side.

From thence stand the sept Isles distant two dutch leagues: within which lies
white haven (called Port blanc) of 6. or 7. fatham. Those Islandes may be
sailed round about.

There lies a shoald called Octobers northwest from the west point of the said
Island about a league and a half of the shore. Vlisshauen (called Green
Island is situated a dutche league westwarde, which may on both sides be
entered: and is a most safe haven for all wether.

The River of Morlays lies five dutche leagues from the sept Isles and is a
bard haven: you may anchor amongst the rocks at 5. fatham in the Channel. Two
dutche leagues from that place stands an Islande (commonly called Taureau) by
which you may sail into the River of S. Paul de Lion, which without is full of
rocks, but within them you may anchor at 6. or 7. fatham. There lies an Isle
called Ysle de bas 2. dutch leagues distante from thence: you may sail in on
both sides of it to the Channel or Road of Roscou which contains 7. or 8.
fatham both on the east and west side. Obcurac bears from Roscou 5. leagues
having many white sandy bays alongest the shore, which are most certain
marks of that coast.

The Inhabitants of these countries have great intercourse and traffic with
the Portugalles, viz. of wheat, Rye, linen Cloth, and other like gross
marcchaundizes.

map of coastal Brittany THE SHOWING OR APPEARING of the Sea coasts of
Britain eue^ as they open and show between S. Malo and Roscou


A TRVE DESCRIPTION OF CONQVET, BREAST, AND FONTENEAV, THE WONDERFVL COASTS OF
BRITANY.
A Dutch league Eastward of the Cape of Gobe, called Les Fours, or the Fourn
there are many black rocks lieng along the coast, which our seamen call the
Backouens, and within the same are many little white sandy bays: The land is
also somewhat low and bewtified here and there with some houses. To get the
Channel or passage between the foresaid rocks and bays, you must sail 2.
Cables length from the said rocks almost South Southeast, keeping S. Matthewes
Abbey in the valley Eastward from Conquet point: then bear inwardes until you
come to Blanc-hauen or Conquet point, hale then to the outwardes, until S.
Mathewes Abbey be open unto you without Conquet point, sailing alongest a
Cables length off: for so shall you not strike upon the Bell, which lies off
Conquet point, almost three cables length. But keep Flemynes bay full west of
the white Friars called the Blancs Moines: But when you may plainly discern
Conquet you are thwart the rocks called Les Fenestriers, which lie under water
at the east side of Conquet haven. But if being at Sea you must turn in, bring
S. Mathewes Abbey right without Conquet point, and sail again about the
rocks called the Hagles which lie almost a third part of the breadth of the
way from Vshant.

There is a harborough betwixt Fenestriers, and the Blancs Moines under S.
Matthewes point in 6. or 7. fatham

And if you will put over from S. Matthewes point to the Race of Fonteneau, you
must conde ye ship from Blancs Moines south and by east, until you come to the
Emperors and Emperes rocks called the Keiser, and Keiserine. But as you must
not press to near Keiser, least you strike upon the rocks which lie under
water, so great heed is to be taken that you be not carried away with the tide
or currente, which commonly sets in toward the Keiserine upon the shoald
called the Calfe, which stretches down from Keiserine like a tongue: and it
is always there as a whirlepoole, and very tempestuous. The Race of Fonteneau
lies out into the Sea South Southwest: But Bresont stretches into the sea
west and by South four dutch leagues from S. Matthewes. The mark to cross
the Race from S. Mathewes to the Keyser, is the mill of Fenestriers, standing
directly westward off S. Matthewes Abbey.

But if you will sail to Croixduyns from S. Matthewes point, hold on east and
by south, so that you keep still the Southermost part of the rocks, called
the Cheminees without Blancs Moines, until you get the bay of Crodune, and the
chapel appear on the grauelly shore, toward which chapel you may safely
bear, and there anchor, in 9, or 10. fatham. Over against Crodun by the north
shore lies Bertrandes-bay, being a very good harborough for a north and
northwest wind. But he which will go up to Breast or Landerneau, must get
good Pilots, for it is all sounding water.

The Collignier bears South Southeast about a league and a half from S.
Matthewes point. The Faukenes lie off from the west point of Crodun about the
fourth part of a league west southwest. The southermost Faukenes stands from
the northermost about half a league South South-east, and is vnder-water at a
high springtide. A cables length off north north-east lies a blind rock,
which at lowest ebb is even with the water. This South Faukenes bears
north-east and by north from Crodun. There is also another hidden rock
westward from the north-east Faukenes which appears at lowest water. The
rock called the Hen lies distant from Faukenes west South-west two Cables
length. There is another called the Chicken almost north-west and by west from
the Hen, being two sharp rocks, which at a great ebb are either even or
little above the water. There lies also a rock east and by south from S.
Matthewes point, lyeng in the midst of Bertrandes-bay, by the North-side of
the water of Breast: And these are his marks, viz. when the southermost of the
rocks, called Cheminees, are one with S. Matthewes point, then you strike upon
this rock, but if it appear a little without, then you go clear.

West Penmarques is a bard haven, which is to be entered on the East Side
along the shore, and leave the great rock on the starre-boord side, which
being once past, you may anchor at three fatham water: for as you come in,
without the rock, you have 8. or 9. fatham: you may also sail within the East
Penmarques: for the maine is sandy strande, where you may anchor in 10. or 12.
fatham very safely, near unto the Isle of Morton, for there is fair ground.

AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE SOVTH COASTS OF BRITANY BETWEEN BLAVET, AND
Picquelier, wherein is also contained Belisle and Groy.
TO sail into Blauet, when you have the East point of the Island called Groy
South and by west, then are you come to the entry thereof which stretches
inwardes north northeast, where is a very safe harborough for any wind or
wether at 6. or 7. fatham water. In the entry you have 4. fatham water but
there lie some shoalds which you must shun. On the west side of the entry
stands a great sharp steeple. There is also under Groy good ground for
ankering 7. or 8. fatham deep, and safe harborough for a south-west wind. But
beware of the south-east shore, for it is rockie ground. But if you will
harbor under Belisle, you may go in, on both sides all at large, where you
may let fall your anchor at 10. or 12. fatham water by S. Paul's spire steeple.
But at a Northeast or north north-west wind, you must way and plie up to the
East side of the Island, where before S. Helen you have safe road at 10.
fatham. But if the wind come above at south, or south south-east, return then
before the foresaid steeple of S. Paul. There lie 3. Islands about a league
and half from Belisle, the midst whereof has safe harborough: you may sail
betwixt them from Island to Island, and in some places find good riding. About
two leagues thence lies the maine land, where are 2. great bays, or rivers:
from whence you may betwixt the maine, and the foresaid Islandes, within
Belisle, sail to Croyswicke, or Croisill, and the river of Nantes, called the
Loyre.

Croyswicke lies from Belisle about 8. dutch leagues East and by North, and
East North-east. And from Croyswicke to the river of Loyre it is about 3.
leagues. He which will go up that river, let him run along the shore of
Croyswicke 3. cables length off to the pierced rock, which he may look thorough
like a great gate. From thence let him keep still two cables length off the
northern shore, straight to the point, whereon stands a sharp steeple,
until he be within the rocks called Les Pourceaux, which lie in the midst
of the river betwixt the pierced rock, and the steeple. But when he is past S.
Nazarethes steeple, he may anchor in the channel at 10. or 12. fatham, where he
must take in a Pilotte to lead him up the Loyre unto Nantes, by the help of
the plummet. There lie Banckes to the Sea-ward a league and a half off
Croyswicke point: between which, and the land called La Collecte he may sail
unto the bay of Armentyer.

If ye will go from the East Side of Belisle with the bay of Armentyer, let
him conde East and by South till he come to the Abbie of Armentyer: beyond
which on the coast side stands a wood: then he must sail East North-east
till the same wood open a good way Northwarde from the Abbey: then shall he
be clear of the shoald called the Munkes Ledge. Then must he set Eastwardes
toward the rock called Peter Meyne, which you may on both sides sail by:
as soon as you are past it, anchor at 6. or 7. fatham, for the rest is to be
sounded. Right over against Armentyer point stands Picquelier: from whence
the course lies South and by East to the Island Heys or Hoy, under which is a
dangerous road, and only safe against a South-west and a west South-west
wind: there is always a great noise and troublesome whirling.

These coasts do yield almost the whole year, wines, white linen cloth,
Graynes, damask Prunes, and Chesse-nuttes: which are transported thence to
other countries. And Nantes, is the chiefest mart town of these parts, whither
the best Orleans wines are brought down the river of Loyre.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF PICQVELIER, ROCHELL, BROVAGE, AND
OF THE Islandes, rocks, and shoaldes adjoining, even as far as Garunne the
river of Bordeaux.
FIrst if you will sail from Heys to the Kellyats, shape your course E and by
S. and E S E until you are past the rock called Le Baer d'Olone, which you may
sail round about: Then may you hale along the coast of Poitou, leaving two
third parts of the water toward the Isle of S. Martyns, until Vrcke come
without the point of the Downs, and then may you see a little Tower and a
wood in the land of Bos, keep that tower so long shut up in the wood, until
the steeple in the coast of Poitou (which is called the Leper) do come over
against Vrcke, which you must so hold, until Rochell appear without Bos
point: then have you passed the Lauerdine: And then may you sail forth
thorough Porthuis, or else cast anchor under the coast of Bos at 6. or 7. fatham.

The marks of Lauerdine are these: If you will anchor under the Bos, keep
Rochell from Bos a ships length, so you shall be clear of the Lauerdine: But
if you will anchor under the Abbey of S. Martynes Island, keep the Abbey right
without the sandy point of the said Island, and hold on your course into the
sandy bay Eastward of the Abbey, and so shall you escape the shoaldes of
Lauerdine, for there is the road for ships that are bound outward.

Porthuis is wide and broad, and stretches inward East South east: Brant or
Burning Island stands from S. Martynes three dutch miles S E and by East:
from whence you may sail to the Eastern shoaldes called Oesterbanke South
South-east: keep the little Tower of Hers on the west side of the wood, until
the red round tilde house, which stands ou the South side of the river
Charante, be one with the steeple called Le Four: Then sail East Southeast,
and South East and by East, until Soubyse be joined to the gray village called
Grave Dorpe, that stands on the shore side, and the little steeple of Hers,
will show it self right on the East Side of the Valley which is in Hers wood:
go then by the marks South Southeast, keeping both the little steeple which
is in the Valley on the East Side thereof, and the East little steeple of Hers,
in the white sandy place. And these are the true marks of the channel of
Brouage inwardes and outwardes unto the Eastern flattes called Oesterbanke:
and when the red round house covered with Slates appears beyond the broad
tower of Vere, then are you past out of Brouage channel. Now if you will
cross over to Brant Island, bring not Rochell tower out of the Isle until you
come near the Island, because of the shoald called the Baniaert, which
stretches down by the Isle Oleron, and is seen at low water. And the road
under Brantysle is, where you may anchor to heave out your ballast in 12. or 13.
fatham.

If you will enter the river of Bordeaux called Garunne, keep the steeple of
Cordam in your sight East South-east, or somewhat more Easterly. On the other
side of the river stands an high read Down, which you must bring Northeast
from you, until you come near the Down which lies Northward: then coast
along that side, until you have entered the river on the North side: anchor
then before Royan at 6. or 7. fatham: all the rest is to be sounded. The
Northside of the river has read Downs, and somewhat high, without trees.
Three or four leagues from the river side are low Downs, where grow some trees
and woods.

In these coasts is great trade of bay salt, and wine, all the whole year:
great plenty whereof is transported from thence to diverse countries: But
Rochell is the ehiefcst town of traffic there aboutes.

Eastern part of Biscay unto Castro.
ABout 18. leagues Southward of the river of Bourdeaux, is a port called
Acason, at the entry whereof are two great rocks, but on the North side it is
broadest: shun the inner point of the Port, because it is full of rocks. In
the very entry you have 5. fatham water, but Northward it is deeper and fair
ground: and contrariwise toward the South lie many perilous rocks, whereof
it behooves you to be heedefull: you may sail in at this haven between the
maine land and the rock, amiddest the channel.

Foureteen leagues Southward from Acason, lies the haven of Bayon, whose
entry is wide and broad. Set the tower at the North point or cape of the
land, and so sail between the rocks and the cape, until you come into the
haven, where you may anchor within the point before the town at 4. or. 5.
fatham water. From thence the course is Southward to S. John de Lux three
leagues within the rocks, which stretch inwards Southeast, and Southeast and
by South, where stands a hill like a saddle bearing Southeast from you: The
town lies in a great bay, and so does Fuenterabie upon a fresh water river.
Passai bears 5. leagues from S. John de Lux west Northwest. From thence you
go westward two leagues to the port of Otera which stretches inwards South
Southeast, and there have you in the entry 3. fatham water, but when you are
within it is wide and broad, and the haven is bard. Four leagues westwarde of
Otera lies Bilbao streching inwardes South and by East: after you are in, you
may turn up Eastward, where you have 4. or 6. fatham water: on the South Side
of the haven lies an Island, where stands a light tower, which you must set
South and by East from you as you sail in, where it is. 3. fatham deep.

Machichaco a good haven lies five leagues from Bilbao west south west, and
Southwest, and by west, which from the west side stretches inwards Southest
and by East in 8. or 9, fatham. In the midst of the entry you shall find a
rock, which you must leave on the Larbord side: you may also sail in at the
East side of the rock, but there you have but 3. fatham: From the entry, the
haven is wide and broad, and you may anchor in any place of the channel at 8.
or 9. fatham. Castro bears three leagues westward from Machichaco, and
stretches inward westerly. In the midst of the entry stands a rock almost
south-west, which you may sail round about in 6. or 7. fatham. The
straightness bears up Southerly: you may turn in toward the East, and
cast anchor in the channel at 10. or 12. fatham.

These ports yield Rosin, Chessenuttes, Iron, wool, Orenges, Filbberdnuttes,
and steel, which are their trades.

A CARD OF THE SEA COASTS of Acason and Biscay with their havens, and opening
of their lands, hills, and Mountains *


A TRVE DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS BETWEEN Laredo and Sentillana.
LAredo bears westward from Castro five Dutche leagues. To enter the bay, set
S. Anthonies hill South East from you, and hale along S. Anthonies shore until
you are clear of the East point of the land. Then turn up Eastward until you
come to Laredo where you may lay out anchor in 6. or 7. fatham. But if you will
bear into the haven within the two walls, you must do it at high water: for
it is a port for barks, and vessels of small burden. There lies a shoald
amiddest the entry of the haven, wheare it is always very troublesome, and
may be sayld about. S. Ander lies four Dutch leagues from S. Anthonies mount:
hale along the west shore until you come to the great rock, whereon stands
a little house, on either side whereof you may sail in. S. Anders haven
stretches in from the entrance Northwest, and has 6. or 7. fatham water.

Four Dutch leagues from S. Ander lies S. Martyns. It is very narrow as you
come in and a bard haven, and parts it self inwardes into two little
streams. Five dutch leagues by west of S. Martyns stands S. Vincents whose
haven also is bard, and has a Rock standinge westward of the entree, and a
little fillet or riffe of sand from the East poyncte: you must sail in
between this sand, and the rock, where it is narrow, but within it is a
round haven, mayntained by a little river.

Three Dutch leagues westward lies Lhanes likewise a bard haven, on the East
side of which lies a bank: sail in on the west side of it, there is likewise
a little river.

In these countries is great store of wool, Iron, Chesse-nuttes, Orenges,
Steel, and Rosin, of all which things there is great traffic.

pass before them


A TRVE DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS BETWEEN Rio de Sella, and Auiles.
SIx Dutch leagues Westward of L'hanes lies Rio de Sella. If you will enter
the haven, mark the maste which stands upon the Eastern shore, near which
you must enter, because the west side is rockie and dangerous inwardes. And
being past the mast anchor before the town: it is a bard haven.

Villa viciosa bears 10. Dutch leagues westward of Rio de Sella, you must
come in by the western shore, because the Eastern is slat and perilous.
Right within the mouth of the haven you shall find a little shoald, which
appears at a low ebb, this is likewise a bard haven. The town stands on
the west side, whither you may sail, and anchor in the largest place. Six
leagues from Villa viciosa westward lies Sanpsons cape, and on the East side
thereof stands a little Island with a small tower: between these two is
goodharborough, and fair ground to anchor in at 6. or 7. fatham: on the
westside of Sanpson even right before the little port is likewise good riding
in 6. or 7. fatham.

VVestward of Sanpson lies Gyon having a peer of stone, under which
Th'inhabitantes do lay their fisher boats: A good Dutch mile from thence
westward is the bay of Tores, where is safe harbarough, and 8. or 9. fatham
water. On the cape stands an high tower. Two leagues farther westward lies
Cape de Pennas, from whence a rewe of rocks stretches out into the sea. Two
leagues from thence stands Auiles, the best port of all these coasts: On
the Eastside thereof is a chapple, near unto the point you must pass, until
you are within two rocks, where it is wide and broad. By the west point there
runs up a little sandy riffe along the shore, reaching inwardes by the
haven toward the town, where it is very shoaldie on both sides, and on the
westside of the haven lie two great rocks right against the little Church, that
stands by the sandy bay.

There is in these coasts far greater plenty and store of fruits, wines,
and other good marchandises, than is in Biscay.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF RIBA DEOS, BIVIERO, AND LVARCA.
FRom Auiles unto Luarca, are six dutch leagues South-west and by west, it is
an haven for small ships and stretches Southeast inwards, the Eastside is
dangerous, but the west is good and fair. Riba Deos, bears Southwest and by
west from Luarca, and is a good haven for all ships: westward of it stands a
sharp steeple, and a little from thence into the sea lies a hidden rock:
when you enter the mouth of the haven two other Towers come in sight at the
west side of the haven, the one on high, the other below nigh the shore: Then
conde through the very midst of the channel until you come against the
second or farthest tower within the haven: where you may anchor on both sides at
your pleasure: But the west side is deeper containing 4. 5. or 6. fatham even
up to Riba Deos, which stands upon a great bay.

The Cape of Brilo is six leagues Northwest from Riba Deos. westward from this
cape stands S. Ciprian, over against which lie two great round rocks. A
league thence westward, stands an Island thwart the mouth of the haven of
Biuiero, which you may sail about on both sides: yet best roming in, is on the
west side: where being clear of the point, you may anchor at 6. or 7. fatham.
Two leagues to the west of S. Ciprian is S. Marks road, which is a fair bay.
Two leagues from thence is a little haven called Quirins, which on the west
side is full of rocks, but on the East side fair and good to enter at. Three
leagues from Quirin lies the Cape of Ortegall where also stands a Castle,
near which you have safe road for a west and a Southwest wind.

This country yields great plenty of the best wynes of Ribadeos as well red
as claret, and likewise abundance of Orenges, Apples, Pears, Chessenuttes and
other fruits: all which are both comfortable and wholesome for man's body.

THE SEA COASTS of Gallicia from Cape of Auiles unto Ortegal.


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF CORVNNA CALLED THE GROYNE, FEROLES, and Monsej the
cheifest ports of Gallicia.
THe haven of Siguera bears three dutche leagues South westward from
Ortegall, it stretches inward South east, and is a good Port, the Southside
thereof has a low point, and is good, but the Northside is all rockie and
foul gound. You must anchor before you come to the village of Siguera. Four
dutche leagues westwarde from thence lies Cape de Prior, which reaches out
into the sea. Two dutch leagues farther southward you have the haven of
Feroles, upon the northside thereof are 2. or 3. sandy Bays, of which the most
Southerly is the greatest, whereupon do stand a house or two, when you are come
nigh the house, then appears unto you somewhat Southerly the haven of
Feroles, where you may sail in at the midst of the water, and being clear
of the North corner, geuynge it a little bieth, anchor in the Channel at 12.
fatham, for before the village it self it is flat and rockie. The south point
of Feroles stretches far outward, and is full of rocks: you may set out from
Feroles to Corunna, South, and South and by East, until you be somewhat within
the tower, which stands upon a round Hill or Cliffe. Then shall you see on
the starborde side a little Island wherein stands a little Church called S.
Blase, hale alonge a Cables length of it, and anchor before the town at 6. or
7. fatham.

If you will run into the Channel of Coruna from the Island Cyzarga (called
by the Fleminges Caesarea) you must shape your course East south east about 5.
leagues, until you are within sight of the tower which stands on the west
coast of the land: for then shall you keep 4. or 5. Cables length of the
shore, and may hold on your course in the Chanel right South east 4. or 5.
leagues: (and being past Corunna) may cast anchor at Fontenne or Pytance, on
the west side under a rue of Rocks at 10. or 12. fatham water.

And over against Corunna East north east stands a city called Puente de
Mas, where you may also anchor at 10. or 12. fatham. There have you likewise on
the northside a rue of Rocks, and over the River a great Bridge.

There lies an Haven called Queres South south west, and South and by west, of
the Island Cyzarga, whose entry is fair: after you are entered you must turn
in westward a great half league, and may anchor there at 8. or 9. fatham in the
channel. Seven dutch leagues westward of Cyzarga lies the east point of
Monsei or C. de Bellem, near which you may sail to Monsei South south east,
and Southeast and by south. If you will come in thither from the west, keep the
cape of Corrian called the Groyne without Cape de conde two ships lengths,
until you may see Marikerke which stands on the westside clear without Monsei
point. Continue your course toward Marykerke through the channel south east
and anchor behind the Rokes before the town at 8. or 9. fatham. Yet shall you
not sail into Monsei before Marykerke be seen without the point of Monsei.
There you may likewise anchor on the Northside of the haven at 6. or 7. fatham.
On the Southside of the town of Monsei, there is a Bay, before which lies a
shoald East north east about two cables length thwart the haven.

Marykerke lies from Monsei North and by East, but it lies East North east
from the Shingles. When you come from Sea, if Marykerke be from you South
east, you may enter at the west side of the rocks: the rocks lie from Monsei
South west and by south: but the inner end of the rocks bears South and by
west.

The Cape de Finisterre, and Monte Lauro, lie from each other South east, and
North west, and the Rocks betwixt them bear South south east. There is a Bay
between the Capes of Finisterre and Corrian, where eastward of the great Rock
you may anchor before the sandy Bay at 6. or 7. fatham. A little dutch league to
the Eastward of Finisterre bears the haven of Corcouia, which the Fleminges
call Corco baiona: It stretches inwards to the North, where you may cast anchor
in the channel at the sandy Bay in 8. or 9. Fatham.

These Coasts or Ports do yield like Marchandises and Fruits as the
aforesaid coasts of Riba deos etc. They take besides at certain seasons every
year a wonderful great quantity of whales, to their great profit and
commodity.

comme sailinge along Out of the Spannishe Sea


A TRVE DECLARATION OF THE SEA COASTS OF GALLITIA FROM the Cape de Finisterre
beyond Camino.
IF you will sail into Muros or Moors, set Montelauro called Mounteluer
Northeast and by East from you, hold then on toward Montelauro, and you
shall go clear of the Rocks that he on both sides, but borow most of the
south side, because that is the salfest. But when you come near Montelauro,
you shall see many high Rocks, which you must leave on the larebord side three
cables length, and so go in. South south east of Montelauro you have a blind
Rock in the midst of the Channel, which you must leave on the starbord
side. But when the Town that lies in Northwards of Montelauro comes full
open unto you, then are you past this blind Rock, which lies South and by
East, somewhat more Easterly of the East end of the town. You must shun the
first point within Montelauro, two Cables length of, and having past the other
point, bear in Northwardes to the town which is on the starbord side. The
city Muros stands on the west side of the haven, where you may anchor at.12.
or.13. fatham.

But if you will enter the River of Roxo, you must set Southwarde without the
cape of Muros, for there are many rocks stretching out into the sea on the
Northside of the haven of Roxo, which you cannot sail between. Wherefore
hold on till you be south of the great rock, and having left all the rocks
on your Larebordside or to the seawards, continue your course between the firm
land and the rock, until you may see the haven open before you. Then must
you pass up in the midst of the channel unto the Island Roxo, and there
anchor where you please. But on the Southside are 2. or 3. bays where is good
anchor hold. If you will go to Puente Vedra set in on the Southside of the Isle
Blidedones, which is a very flat land, lying in length East north east about
two dutch leagues: then shall you come to a little Island in the midst of the
Haven, which you shall leave on the Larboorde. To the Southward of it you may
perceive a tower on the main land, before which you must sail, and anchor at
7. or 8. fatham.

Four dutch leagues from Puente vedra lie the Islandes of Bayon, which to such
as come out of the sea, show like gray rocks, or cliffes. If you will go in at
the North-side, your course lies in midde water, between these Islandes, and
the main land, until the channel of Cannas or Cangas and Vigo be opened
unto you: then go Eastwarde in. The Haven is fair and large, you may ride on
both sides, either before Vigo or Cangas: and may likewise go farther in
beyond the South point to Rondello, where both ship and lading may be salfe
in the Oase without cable or anchor.

But if you will sail in by the south Island of Bayone, your course lies in
the midst of the channel between the said Island and the main land, until
you are clear of the point of Bayon. Then set toward the East point of Boyon,
whereupon stands a castle afterward turn southwarde behind the Castle to
the city, where you may anchor at 6. or 7. fatham. You may also cross over
thence to Vigo, betwixt the point and the Islande or Rock that lies in the
other side of the haven at 3. or 4. fatham.

But if you will sail from the southermost Islande to Vigo or Cangas, hold on
two leagues Northeast until you may see thorough between the main and the
North Island, and that the city of Cangas appear without the corner, which
is on the North side of the haven. Then arises a low point on the starboord
side, hold on in the midst of the channel between the said point, and the
North land, where you may anchor in what place you please: both on the Southside
before Vigo, and on the North side before Cangas in 12. or 13. fatham.

These countries and ports yield great abundance of Orenges, Chestnuts, and
very small wines. And thither is carried great quantity of Corn, to the great
benefit and behoof of many Marchaunts and Mariners.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COSTS OF THE NORTH PART of Portugale viz.
from Viana, to cape de Montego.
ABout three dutch leagues to the Southward of Bayone stands a monastery upon
the strand. Five Dutch leagues from hence is the river of Viana called Rio de
Lymas, at the entry whereof lies a notable ledge of rocks. That you may go
clear of the same, hold on still Southward, until the two fire or watch
Towers which stand upon South-land be brought in one. For by these marks you
may hale along the shore in 4. or 5. fatham, until the two houses and the
little steeple which you see upon the Northside of the land be brought together.

Then hold on so alongest the shore on the East side of the rock whereon
stands a mast, until the river lie open before you. Then sail inwards on the
South side of the second rock, whereon also stands a maste. Then crossing up
Northward to Viana anchor at 7. or 8. fatham. In the very entry lies a bar,
whereon is two fatham water. Five Dutch leagues South of Viana stands Villa
del Conde, and at the entry of that haven are many rocks, round about which
you may safely pass in 5. or 6. fatham depth. Farther inward lies a bar or
a shoald thwarting all the mouth of the haven and has 2. fatham water, the
deepest place in all the haven is not above 3. or 4. fatham, but the best depth
is to the Southward. It is a bard haven, and in the North part, full of rocks
and sands.

Three leagues Southward of Villa del Conde lie the great high rocks of Lesons
half a league to the Northward of the river of Port de Port, called Rio Duero,
betwixt which rocks and the main, you may sail in on both sides, and there
ride at 6. or 7. fatham, for the ground is very good for ankering. There lies
a rock under water half a league Southwest of the west corner of the said
rocks.

The port of Metellyn, lies within the foresaid high rocks, being a bard
haven of 2. fatham. A league Southward of Lesons rocks, lies the River Port
de Port. into which you must hale on the Northside, keeping all the rocks
Northward of the river, and sail along the South shore East and by North,
until you are clear of the rock whereon stands a cross, then fare you
forward in the midst of the river to the city Port de port. Inwardes it is
10. or 12. fatham, but the entry is only 3. or 4. fatham deep, at half
flood. You may enter likewise on the South side along the shore, where at high
water there is 3. fatham.

From Port de port to Aueiro is 8. leagues, all the coast along the shore is
downs. About the mouth of Aueiro are ragged downs, and may hale along the
strand at 10. or 12. fatham: when the high black hill within the land bears
East and by South from you: then are you in the entry and right before Aueiro
river. when you are come in 6. or 7. fatham water, you shall see three mastes
standing upon the shore, which you must keep together, bearing inwardes East
and by South, and East South east, until you come near the shore, where
these mastes stand by the sand bancks. Then set Northward, and holding on near
the North shore, leave all the flattes on the starreboord, until you have the
river open before you. Then turn in again East South east up to Aueiro, in
the midst of the channel, between both the coasts. At the entrance upon the
shoald at half flood, you have but 2. fatham, until you are within it, where
you have 5. or 6. fatham depth.

Five Dutch leagues Southward of Aueiro bears the Cape de Montego, and a
eague to the Southward of that Cape, lies the bard haven Pisage: half a
league to the westward from thence in the sea lies a bancke containing 6.
fatham water, under which you may ride at 12. or 13. fatham. Under the
Burlynges which are pourtraied in the next Table, you may cast anchor at 10.
fatham right against the Hermitage, where you have very fair ground.

These countries yield store of wines, Oringes, Oil, and Olives, and much good
Salt is carried from Aueiro. But the city of port de port is the chiefest
Town of traffic in all these coasts.

havens thereof Exactly do^ne, and corected with great diligence.


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF THE MOST notable part of
Portugal. viz. from the Burlinges to beyond Saint Vues.
THe Cape of Roxent bears 12. leagues South and by East, and South south-east
from the Burlings. About a league to the Eastward of Roxent lies the Road
called Cascals: where against a North wind you may anchor at 10. or 12. fatham.
If you will from Cascals into the river of Lysbone, hale along the north shore
bearing a loofe from the first black point, about a cables length. Then go
toward S. Gyles point a quarter of a Cables length of it: but take heed you
enter not in a calm and a low ebb, because the tide sets strongly upon the
northern shoalde, called the north Malechopos or Katchupps: when you are within
S. Gyles, bear alongest the North shore, until you are past the castle
called Restiers, or Rastels, and anchor at 12. or 13. fatham, before the Town
called Bolin.

But if you will sail in the channel called the Craeck deep, or great deep
of Lisbone, set the west point of Roxent right against Cas-cals, until the
abbey which stands upon the hill westward of Restiers answers to the
little tower which bears Northwardes upon the land: Then go so toward the
Abbey of S. Katherynes almost North-east, and North-east and by East, until on
your Larbord side you have two third parts of the river. Continue then your
course toward Restiers, until you are past the castle, where you may anchor
at your pleasure.

But if through the Craicke deep you will turn in or out upon a board, bring
the said little Tower two mastes length westward and the like distance to the
northward of the said Abbey, and every time when you have brought your marks
after this sort, turn the ship, until you come to S. Katherynes bay.

But if you will set toward the Banks of S. Vues or S. Toous, keep the
first point lying to the westward of Zizembre a ships length without the
point that bears Eastward of it, until you see a white house appear over
against the castle that stands on the shore: Then may you discover the
castle of Palmedo in a great valley: keep these marks after this manner, and
go North Northeast and North-east and by North, until you are past the
aforesaid castle on the shore. And from thence hale along that shore at a
cables length to S. Vues. In the banks of S. Vues lie 7. shoaldes or bars,
which at full sea have 4. fatham water. On the South Side these banks are
dry, and do for the most part show above water. The entry along the South
coasts is only for Barks, and small vessels, anchor near the city of S. Vues
at 6. or 7. fatham.

In this part of Portugal is so great trade and variety of traffic, that it
is hardly to be matched in all Europe. For there is great plenty of all kind
of spices, sugar, silver, gold, wine, oil, salt, Iuory, cochenille, brasill,
and innumerable other kinds of marchandises, that are brought thither out of
the Indies, and from thence transported and dispersed throughout all Europe.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF ALGARBES the Southern part of
Portugal.
AT the Cape of S. Vincent you have salfe harborow for a North and Northwest
wind: Two leagues from Lagos, lies a great rock under water, and a great
league Southward from Villa Noua: whether if ye will go bring the tower and
the mast standing upon the East land, together, and hold alonge the shore
until you are past the tower, then bear in Northward till you come before the
city of Villa Noua, where on the South side you have a great dry bancke: at
the entry or mouth is only 2. fatham water at half flood, and the north side
is full of bancks and shoaldes. About 6. leagues Eastward bears the city
Faraon, where, upon the shore stands a light tower, from the corner whereof
lies out a banck which you must avoid. Go in on the East side setting the
tower on the Larbord, and the shore of Tauilas on the starrebord side. Four
leagues Northward of Faraon lies Tauilas, the entrance is crooked and full of
shoalds which you must pass by obseruyng the shore marks, beacons, and other
signs before you may enter. At half flood you have there not above 10. or 12.
foot depth, and every year the channel shifteth. Four leagues from thence
Northward lies Aimont, a good haven, and you may bear right in from the sea,
or may enter by the Eastside hard abord the shore: within, it is wide and
broad, you may turn to Castro-Marin or Aimont, where you may anchor at 5. or
6. fatham, as you shall think best.

Five leagues further Eastward you have the channel of L'epe which does
change almost every year. Two leagues Eastward from thence lies the entry
of S. Michael where you may come directly in from the sea, and then from S.
Michaels with little barks you may pass the shoaldes to L'epe or Cartaya,
where you may take in the good Bastard wine.

These Havens do yield figs, oil, cork, and wines, there is also great
store of fish taken at Lagos, which is carried thorough the straightes of
Gibraltar, sold and distributed among the most part of the towns of the Leuant.

A Description of the Sea Coasts, of the land of Algarbe, and a part of the
Condado with their show and opening


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS AND HAVENS OF ANDALVZIA.
SAltees bears 4. leagues Eastward from S. Michaell, you may sail by it, to
the great Condado, and may go in by the west entrance, and keep Guelua, which
we call the Vuoolfe, over the Eastern point of the haven, bearing inwardes to
Saltees. But if you will enter by the land side, then must you bear in with
the west end of the white cliffe: hale then a cables length off alongest the
shore by the great tree, that stands westward of the cliffe, keepyng still
the point of the haven right over against the Tower of Odier, until you are
clear of the Island. Then set Northward to Palos, where you may anchor at 5. or
6. fatham.

Saltees lies 8. leagues from Chipiona South-east: you may here enter the
river of S. Lucar de Barrameda called Guadalgueuir two cables length from the
shore: and when you are clear of the second shoalde, give it a birth of the
South shore, until the Abbey, and the great tree are one: then hold on to S.
Lucyfers Church commonly called S. Lucar de Barrameda. To get the true depth
and channel of the river set the said great tree right over the East End of
the Abbey, and so may you enter or go forth. But when Chipiona bears South
Southwest from you, and the castle and tower are one, then are you near the
first blind rock or shoalde. The marks of the rock that lies in the
entrance of S. Lucars channel are, when the windmill and the white Frierie are
brought together on the East Side of S. Lucar, for then should you by sailing
forwards strike upon the rock. wherefore keep the windmill five foot
distant Northward of the Abbey, and then shall you enter in the best of the
channel, which at half tide is 4. fatham deep. within, it is wide and
broad, anchor there at 10. or 12. fatham before the little Church which
stands on the North shore.

Calis-malis lies South-east from Chipiona 7. leagues, there have you the
entry wide and broad. You may sail in about two cables length of the Puercos,
which lie about half a league from the North corner of Calis. About a great
half league North-east and by North from thence lies a rock under water
called the Diamant: then appears S. Maryes little Church between two great
high hills.

If you will go farther in then Calis, hold on South-east beyond Puntall, where
is good harborough for all winds. Calis bay is wide and broad and of 15. or 16.
fatham depth. A North-west wind beats full upon it. From Calis to the
straight of Gibraltar you have eight leagues: and three leagues thence to the
haven or road of Gibraltar, which is a very fair bay, and is able to conteyne
many ships.

About the point of Tariffa or the straight, half a league from land, lies a
shoalde no deeper then 1. fatham, which you must be heedefull to avoid.

These countries bring forth all kinds of the best wines, fruits, and other
Marchandises, as Seckes, Bastard, and Romany, Figs, Reasins, Oil, Olives,
Pomegranets, Cytherons, or Orenges, Sugar, Skins of India, and great plenty
of the best Salt.

A DECLARATION OF THE SEA CHART FROM THE FARTHEST part of England to Plymouth.
IF coming out of the East, you are bound with the Sorlinges, shape your
course in by the Eastern shore at 8. or 9. fatham. There is a Bulwark or
sconce before the castle: And thence off a little way lies a rock under
water, you may sail betwixt it and the Bulwark. On the west side of the haven
are two rocks, keep them in one, and go near the North shore, so shall you
safely sail without the point in 10. fatham, but take heed you come no
nearer. To go clear of the rock that lies in the entrance, set the northern
rock northward of the other rock, so much as you may see thorough them, and
then are you on the North-side of the rock that lies in the entry. And when
you are past the rocks that are above water, turn Northward near the
castle, and anchor at 8. or 9. fatham. If you will go from the Lysarde to
Monsbay, hold on west North-west, until you see the castle in Monsbay upon a
high round rock. Then bear into the Bay, right on the west side of the
castle, until you discern a little Island nigh the west coast, whereupon are
two sharp steeples like unto watch-towers or beakons. And go so into the Bay
nigh to that Island or rock, (for there alongest it is clear) leaving the
castle a good way on your starrebord side. by reason of the rocks adjoining.
When you are past the Island, you shall see a great sandy bay, where you may
anchor in 7. or 8. fatham. But the best of the road against a South and South
South-east wind is at 6. or 7. fatha^.

If you will sail to Fallmouth, hale inwardes alongest the Eastern shore two
cables off, that you may be clear of the blind rock that lies in the
entry. Beyond the haven stands a high wood, which you must keep beyond the
Northern point of the west land. By that wood are two chalky marks, which you
must likewise keep above the said point, then bear toward the midst of the
high west land, where you may anchor at 15. fatham, at the northern point of
the high land: But if you will run farther in, plie Eastward toward the
Bay, and when you are clear of the shoald which reaches down from the
Eastern tower inwards toward the midst along the haven, there anchor within
the bancke near the East land at 8. or 10. fatham.

Foy stands also in a great Bay, being a bard haven, where on each side
stands a tower. Bear in between both shoares. But on the west side the water
is broader between the stakes and the tower which stands on the west coast.
But if you will hale in along the west shore within the stakes, bearing a
little off from the land, hold about the midst of the channel, but nearer
to the westward, until you come before the town where at full sea you have
depth enough.

Here is no great trade or traffic, but for broad clothes, kersies, and
Tin. The greatest part of the inhabitants live upon grasing, and shipping.

map of coastal England THE SEA COASTS of England, from the Sorlinges by the
lands end to Plymouth with the havens and harbrowghes


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF ENGLAND between Plymouth and
Portland.
IF you will sail into the Sound of Plymouth and go clear of the Rock,
bear along hard by the East Side of the Island where it is 5. fatham deep at
high water, until you see the Church of Lyme-house on the west side of the
valley, for then are you clear of the rock: behind that Island and upon the
maine land of Plymouth stands a wall, which if you do heedefully mark and
Lyme-house Church appear on the North head of the aforesaid valley, then
shall you run right upon the Rock, where you have but 3. fatham at low
water: yet behind the Island you may anchor in.12. or 13. fatham. But if you
will forwards into the west harborough, set westward between the Island and the
main land until you have opened the west harborough haven, then hold on in
the midst of the channel between both lands, until you are within the west
point, where you may cast anchor at 9. or 10. fatham. When you will sail from
the Cape called Ramhead into Catvvater, then plie toward Plymouth point until
Catvvater lie open before you, leave the greater part of the water on your
starborde side, and so sail into the midst of the channel, where you may
anchor right against the northland in 4. or 5. fatham at a dead low water: And
you may anchor also on the side of the entry under the Cape of Ramhead
Northward thereof by the shore in 10. fatham water for there is clear ground.

If your course lies to Dartmouth, you shall diserne a red point on the
East Side of the Haven, and a black point at the waters side. In the Red point
lies a great white rock: when you have brought this rock right over the
Black point, you are hard abourde the Blind rock, that lies thwart the
Channel of Dartmouth, yet nearer to the Eastward. But when you come to
discern the Kay of the town that stands on the East Side of the Haven,
keep amidst the channel, until you may perfectly see the same, then hale
inwardes until you are within the two Castles standing on the havens side, and
you shall go clear of the Rock. The haven is wide within: you may turn
westward and let fall anchor before the town or the Brew-houses where you list.
Three leagues Eastward from thence is the road of Torbay, which is very salfe
for a South-west wind: you may likewise anchor on the East Side of the start
where is good anchor hold in 8. or 9. fatha^. Four leagues to the Northward of
Torbay lies the bay of Tynmouth a salfe harborough for a South wind, where is
also good ground for ankering in 7. or 8. fatham. If you come out of the west
into Portland road, hold on two cables length off along Porteland shore:
and having past the point, turn westwardes till you come to the castle: where
is good road against a South, and South and by East wind at 7. or 8. fatham.
Northwarde of Portland, lies a little bard haven, called Waymouth, where you
may anchor at 4. or 5. fatham. If you will ride under S. Aldomes Land shun the
Needles of Shipmans poole, and so sail into the town, which at a low water you
have ankeryng at 3. fatham.

These Ports yield almost nothing else but wool and clothe: the inhabitants
do live chiefly upon grazyng.

map of coastal England A DESCRIPTION OF THE Sea coasts of England. Between
Plymmouth and Portland with the, cheifest havens thereof according unto their
Situation


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS BETVVEENE THE Isle of Wight and Dover.
TO go in at the west end of Wight, you must look well to the tide for the
flood sets very sore upon the Needles, and the ebb likewise westwarde upon the
Shingels and Chalkie Rocks which lie westwardes of the Needles, and it is very
narrow between the Needles and the Shingels, wherefore sail directly with the
Needles very near them, and keep the inner point of the Isle right without
the Needles: And when you are so come within the Needles, bear somewhat off
the Island between the Chesell and the Isles point, (because of the Rocks
called the Wardens, which lie on VVight-side near the shore) then turninge
Eastward over against Calshorte, you must cast anchor in 7. or 8. fatham.

But if you will enter at the East end of VVight, keep the Castle right
against the Lime-kil that lies above Portesmouth until that Culuer cliffe come
within the point of the I Will, for then shall you have brought the Lyme-kill to
the east end of Portesmouth: which you must so hold until the Castle which
stands to the westward of Portesmouth do appear on the East side of the
wood: and then plie sometimes toward Saint Helens Abbey, keepyng your marks
in this sort, you shall take no hurt on the Shoaldes or Sands. But if you
cannot see the Limekill, then shall you keep the Castle on the west side of
Culuer cliffe, until you have brought S. Helens church with out the point of
the Island a ships length. Then may you freely sail Northwest up, without
any danger of the Riffe or tayle-sand that lies out. Then keep the square
Tower between the East end of Portesmouth and the Castle: until you may see
the Castle which stands on the west side of Portesmouth, Eastward of the
wood: and so may you go inwardes.

The marks of these Shoalds and Flats are these. viz. The Castle standinge
Eastwards of Portesmouth, and the square tower, whereof I have now treated.

When you have brought the Lymekill so much to the Eastward of the Castle,
that you may but see betwixt the^, then are you upon a little shoald, which at
low water has 5. fatham and a half: and then have you the Castle that
stands on the west end of Portesmouth, at the west corner of the wood. But
when the square tower that stands by East of Portesmouth is brought westward
of the Castle: then the Castle by west of Portesmouth stands at the woods
west end. You have there at high water 6. fatham. And when the square tower is
seen between the East end of Portsmouth and the Castle, and the Castle stands
right betwixt the Limekill and the tower: and likewise when the Castle on the
west end of Portesmouth stands to the Eastwarde of the wood, then have you
11. fatham at high water. But when the Limekill and Portesmouth tower are one,
and the castle bears westward of the wood, then have you 10. fatham at high
water, and lastly when S. Helen lies south west and by west from you, then the
South east end of the shoald bears North east, and by north from you.

Three leagues Eastward of VVeenbridge lies Arundel, which is a bard haven,
and at half flood.2. fatham deep: you must go in by the west coast, and let
fall your anchor before the town in.5. fatham. Four leagues from Arundell
stands New Shoram,

The East side thereof has a grauelly Chesell, where alongest you may sail in,
and in the entry you have.3. fatha^ water at half flood: in the midst before
the haven lie rocks under water. The entry on the west side is wide and
broad, and is at half flood 2. fatham deep, the haven is large and broad
within, where you may anchor in 4. or 5. fatham.

If you will sail into the Cammer of Rye, shape your course along the
Shingels: and when you shall be a Cables length of the point of the Shingels,
turn up toward the Castle of VVinchelzey, leaving all the shore or shoald
marks on your starbord, then let fall your Anchor in the River of Rye, called
the Rother at 4. or 5. fatham: for the Cammer where in times past we were wont
to lie is now foul and full of shoaldes.

These countries yield little else but wool, Clothe, and Fier-wood, which are
transported from thence.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION AND POVRTRAICT OF THE CHIEFEST PART OF England viz. of
Thames the river of London, and of all the sands, banks, flattes, and
shoaldes unto Harwich.
IF you come from the West, and will pass within the Goodwin to the foreland:
first shape your course North north-east, and North and by east: and then the
windmill standing westward of the foreland, appears on the west side of the
valley, hold then on North and by East, until you have brought the tower of the
Foreland on the East Side of the said valley: and then are you on the North
side of the Querns. The marks hereof are, when you see a little tower standing
on the forelandes point, and an other on the Southforeland over against the
third white down at the castles side. But if you come from the North and will
sail within the Goodwin, take heed you come no nearer the Quernes then 7.
fatha^. Then setting the south Foreland from you South south west, you have the
best depth: when the broad Tower is brought into Ramsgate, you are then at the
Quernes: But when the windmill appears in Ramsgate, or in the valley, you are
then on the South of the Quernes. But when you be at the downs, and the
innermost corner of the cliffe be South Southwest from you, then the Quernes
bear North and by East: and the North-end of the Goodwin North-east and by
North, and Northeast from you.

If you will sail from Margate into the Thames, shape your course by north the
foreland west South west: then hold on alongest the coast west, and west and
by north to the Reculuers, where a ship that draws much water must stay for
the tide, to pass over the shoaldes called the Lastes between a buy and a
beacon, where is 3. fatham depth. From the buy set west north west, and west
and by north toward the Beacon standing northward, where you have also 3.
fatham water: and as soon as you are past that Beacon, it is but 2. fatham
deep at half flood: from thence plie west northwest into the channel: hold
then for the most part toward the north shore, because of the Norre, which
reaches down from the South shore, and go so forth amiddest the river up
unto Grauesend: But if you will back again alongest the North coast out into
the Sea, shun Blactaeil point before the middle shoald, afterward plie
Northeast, and northeast and by north until you have brought a certain Sharp
steeple in the midst between two others. The great spire steeple is called
S. Matthevves Abbey. By these marks you may pass thorough the Spittes, within
half a cables length off the shore: then hold on alongest the shore
Northeast unto the Nase, where two trees stand upon a high hill: and when they
are both in one, cond North Northwest, by the marks of Harvvich, until you
come before the haven: And from thence hold on northeast and by North to
Orfordnesse, and so North Eastward into the sea. But when you shall be come to
the Spittes, and the Beacon standing upon the shoaldes of Shovv bear west
Southwest. You are then in the Kings channel which lies to the seaward North
northeast, where at low water you have 4. fatham.

If you will bear in with Harvvich, set the broad tower standing westward of
Harvvich in the wood, Southward of Harvvich, and enter northwest and by north,
and north northwest, until you are clear of the fishers stakes. Then turn in
westward or northward as you please, and anchor in 6. or 7. fatham. About half
a league from the northend of the red cliffe lies the shoald of Bavvdsey. If
you will enter near Orfordnesse, hale along the shore until Alborough lie
north and by west from you, and then shall you be on the west side of White
Sand, and right against Orfordnesse haven. From thence setting South and by
west, pass by the shoald of Bavvdsey on the outside: then hold on
Southwest-ward, till you may see Harvvich open of the point of the haven. Then
comes Bavvdsey to lie westward of the red cliffe: where is safe road in 5.
fatham. west northwest of Alborough lies a shoalde called Abreknocke: from
thence you have unto Galper 8. leagues South Southeast: And from Galper to the
North foreland 4. leagues Southwest and by South, where the tide from the north
and South do cross each other along the coasts of England, where also a
north and a South moon makes full sea.

In these coasts is very great traffic, but chiefly of English clothes,
wool, tin, pewter, lead, safron, sea-coles, firewood, and other
commodities, which these countries do yield. Contrariwise all kind of
salt-fish, and great store of linnencloth, and other merchaundises is brought
thither from Holland, and Zealand, and there uttered and distributed.

and sholdes there abouts according to their (...) Salvation and appearing*


THE NORTH COASTS OF ENGLAND BETVVEENE VVALDERSwicke and Burnham, withal the
banks and shoalds.
WHen Eston bears Southwest and by South from you, then are you on the
Northside of Couehith shoald. But when Kesland lies west North-west, you are
on the South Side of that shoald. When Lestofs tower stands Southward of the
tree, you are then on the Southside of the banckes of Leistofe. If you will
anchor on the South of Leistof, borrow of the shore at 4. fatham, till the
tower be west, and west and by North from you, where you may cast anchor in 4.
fatham water. But if you will go thorough the narrow places within the banks
to the brew house, give it a little birth of the shore: then edge Northward,
and North and by westward, and anchor in the North road before the brew house,
at 6. or 7. fatham. And if you will out to sea thorough the shoaldes, bring the
brew house and the windmill in one, and cross so thorough the shoaldes. But if
you will hold on your course toward Yermouth, keep Suthon over against the
North head or pierre, and the great tree southward of the flat church, and hold
on so straight by yermouth shoaldes called the Holmes. Northwarde of the Haven
of Yermouth lies a shoald called Middle-platt: at the west side thereof you
have 7. fatham water. Not far from yermouth lies an other shoald called
Rocklyn 9. fatham deep, which you may pass by on both sides to the seawardes.
There also stands a broad tower on the Northside of yermouth, lying inwardes
from the shore: when you have brought the same to the Southend of the wood,
you are then on the North part of yermouthes shoaldes.

If VVynterthon bear South southwest from you as you come from the North, you
are Southward of the shoald of VVinterthon. Thence borrow of the shore at 3.
or 4. fatham, till you come Southward of Rocklyn. To the Eastward and East and
by Northward of yermouth beyond the shoaldes lies a new bancke, which has
been there but these 3. or 4. years past, being of 2. fatham deepth, but
as well on the North as the Southside you have there 20. fatham water.

Blackneie is a bard haven, you must enter along the shore, and in the entry
lie Buys. Between Blackneie and Welles lies a shoalde called the Pol and
Peper: At the west side of this shoald is the channel of Welles, which has
also Buys in the entry. Burnam stands 4. leagues westward of welles, where
is shallaw water, and the flats stretch far into the sea. Burnam channel
lies inwardes by the shore, and has on the Larbord side, as you enter
certain Beacons. To the westward, lies an other road or channel of 3.
fatham depth called burneham pits: about 3. leagues thence to seawardes you
have but 2. fatham water. If you will set toward Linne, go hard under S.
Edmunds Chapel, leaving the shoalde called the Suncke, which lies above water
a seabord of you, then hold on your course South and by west to the first Buy
that lies in the entry of Linne.

The commodities and traffic that these coasts yield is wool, Cloth: and in
some places, wheat, Barley, Malte, Beer, Herringes and Sprattes: In exchange
whereof much Salt Fish, and Linen Clothe is brought thither, and vented
especially at Linne.

AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE COASTS AND CHANNELS OF Linne, Hull, Filey,
Scarborough, with the shoalds and banckes adjoining.
IF you will sail from Wells to the haven of Lynne, keep the high flat tower
between the two other high towers, then are you in the right way to Lynne.
When S. Edmunds Chapel bears East from you, and the trees that stand upon
the innermost point do come on the west end of the Chapel, then shape your
course in Southeast, and Southeast and by South toward the first buy: for now
are you entered the Eastern channel of Lynne: from thence hold South
south-west, and South and by west to the first Beacon, from thence to the
second South Southwest, and so forth unto the third Southwest and by South.
Then your course lies by two buys Southwest, and Southwest and by South, till
you be within the point of the Land: from whence you may conde between the
shoaldes to the west entry or channel, and out again by the Buys and eye
marks. This channel lies to the seawardes Northeast, and Northeast and by
East. But if you will enter Bostons channel set toward the coast of
Skegnesse, bear in hard abord the shore, and you shall be clear of the shoald
called the Drosing or Ellen-knocke. when you have brought the three trees
Southward of Somcall or of the sharp steeple, then Ellen-knocke. stands so
seawardes from you. And then may you bear up alongest the coast of Leake in 3.
fatham water into the river of Bostone. But you may return back again to sea
between Ellen-knock and long sand, in 3. fatham water East North-East.

And if you will enter the channel of Humber, hale in alongest the Northern
point of Sprunhead, because the Southside is flat and full of shoaldes, but
being entered a little way, borrow of the other side of the river toward
Grymsbie within the shoald, where you may ride in 6. or 7. fatham. But if you
will go farther in up to Hull, keep on west northwest along by the
Southside to the furthermost end of the shoalde: then turn Northward into the
river, where after you are entered, you must hold west Southwest, and west and
by South.

Bridlingstone is situate in a bay, where is safe harborough for a North and a
Northwest wind. Three leagues to the Northward of Flamburgh lies the bay of
Filey, where you may safely anchor for a North Northeast wind, between the
Peer, and Filey bridge, (which is a rock that lies under water at a spring
tide.) Scarbrough bears two leagues northward of Filay, and has two peers,
wherein you may cast anchor, and lie on the sand at low water.

The traffic of these parts is Barley, Malte, wheat, and course Clothes.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE NORTHERMOST COASTS OF ENGLAND, WHERE THE River
of Newcastle is the chiefest haven.
FRom Scarborough to Whitby you have 4. leagues North west and by west, the
Haven or River is barde. Southwardes of the Haven stretches out a Shoalde half
a league into the Sea. If you will sail to VVhitby, bear in between two
beakons, till you come between two lands, where you shall find it somewhat
shallow. Hertlepole lies from VVhitby. 7. leagues, westwarde thereof is a
great Bay or River called the Teis. It is a very fair Haven and stretches
inwardes to the west southwest. In the very midst of it, you have 30. fatham
water, but farther inwardes before Sockton, not above 4. fatham.

The Cape or point of Sonderland lies seven leagues northward from Hartlepole.
Two leagues from thence more Northward is the castle of Tinmouth, on the
Southside of it is the mouth of the River of Nevvcastell. The marks to enter
are, when two watch Towers, and the wood are brought in one, by these marks
you may sail in and out, until you come before the Town, where you have 3.
fatham and a half. But in the entry only 2. fatham at half flood. Cocket
Islande is 7. leagues from Tinmouth North North west, which you may sail
round about, and may cast Anchor salfely at 4. or 5. fatham.

In these Coasts and specially at Newcastle is merueilous great traffic for
sea Coals, which are transported thence to other Countries. It does yeald also
Barley, wheat, Malte, and course Clothes,

A TRVE DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS BETWEEN Bambourgh and Aberdyne.
HOlley Islande bears 4. leagues North North west from Coket Isle, and has
in the South Side thereof a Bay wherein is salfe road at 3. or 4. fatham, but
best riding is before the castle. Between the west point of the Staples and
Holy Islande are 2. Rocks, one opposite to another, called the Plough, and the
Goldstone. Bring Dunstabourgh one with Bambourgh, and so sail out betwixt
them. Barvvick lies from thence five leagues west northwest: if you will enter
the haven set the two Beacons on your starboord, and so hold on to the city:
from thence five leagues North northwest lies S. Tabbes head. The Isle of
Basse is four leagues distant from S. Tabbes head, west northwest: whither
from the farthermost point of the Staples you have 6. leagues Northwest: From
S. Tabbes head to May Island, four leagues northwest and north west and by
north: From May to Fisnes one league Northeast and by east. Basse bears South
west and south west and by south from May, two great leagues, and but one from
the western shore. Brant Island stands to the westward, and west and by
northward of Bass three leagues, by the south side of which you may sail.
Three leagues westward of Brant Isle lies Edenbrough the chiefest mart of all
Scotland.

S. Andrevvs Bay bears northward of Fisnes, where is salfe harborough for a
western wind: from S. Andrevvs three leagues northward lies the river of Donde
which stretches directly in from the sea: and may anchor before the city of
Donde: A little farther in stands a town called S. John's: there lies also a
rock called the Scaepe before the rivers mouth about half a league off the
shore South eastward from Donde. Two leagues to the North Eastward of Donde
stands a high tower upon the point called Albror: from whence lies the haven
of Manros two leagues to the northward: where, on both sides is clear ground:
and you may safely enter amidst the channel: and turning up northward may
anchor before the city: from Manros you have three leagues Northeast-ward to
the cape or point called Seynhooft, whereon stands a castle. And two leagues
Northward from thence lies the port of Aberdyne: the west side is foul, but
Eastward it is good and fair, enter therefore hard a board the East shore,
till you come into the haven: in the entry there is 3. fatham water, and you
may anchor before the city in 4. or 5. fatham.

From these coasts are transported course scottish clothes, frises, sea coals,
and some barley and malt, which are the commodities of those ports.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE coasts between Bamburgh and Aberdeine whereof Edinburgh
is the chiefest martrowne


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE SOVTHERMOST PART OF Norway, and of the coasts
adjoining.
IF you will sail into the Naze of Norway, enter Westward thereof North
northwest, leaving the rock called the Bishop boden on your Larbord, which
lies in the midst of the Channel: Being clear of the same you must carefully
as you go inwards beware of another Rock that lies under water: but within it
you shall cast anchor right against a white Church. If you will enter on the
west side of Maensounde sail in North north east, but shun the Rocks, which
lie under water on the starborde, about the innermost Isle. And being clear of
them, anchor in.9. or.10. fatham.

But if you will enter the Clooffe, keep the Cow and Calfe North north east
from you, and sail in westward of Melou, but shun the rock which lies in
the fair midway. And let fall Anchor in 15. or 16. fatham by the west shore
within the point, and on the East side of Melou, you may go to Schaersounde
and Oedendale.

If you will bear in with the western haven of Vlecker or Flecorie, Conde a
longest the out Schaers of Heiligen sound: and when the Bay of Vlecker opens
before you North north east, then hold in between the Island and the maine,
anchor in 15. or 16. fatham against the Rock, whereon stands a pair of
Gallows. The Eastern entry stretches inwardes west northwest: and you may
see the Bay called the Vos open before you: Set all the black rocks on the
starrebord, and the rock with the two high stony beacons (which are called
warders) on the Larbord-side, and so sail inwards. But if you will set
toward Repervvicke, keep the two sharp rocks standing upon VVolfsound on
the starbord, and the three warders, with all the rocks on the Larbord, and
continue your course so in Northward: but being clear of the point, turn up
westward where you may anchor in 10. fatham.

The Eastern entry of VVolfsounde stretches inwardes Northwest, you must
leave the great rock to the westward, whereon stands an high warder. In the
Isle of vvolfsounde are three warders, turn in westward, where you may anchor
in 25. fatham, you may also pass betwixt the rocks to Old Hill sound which
lies inwards west Northwest.

Amersounde lies North north-east in, and you may anchor behind the Island,
near unto the high warder 30. fatham depth.

The Eastern gate or entry of Amersounde lies northwest, and southeast,
westward thereof stands a rock with a high warder on it.

The Isle of Hesnes has two warders upon it: It is there very deep, but
toward the little church is not so deep, viz. 30. fatham. You may sail
within the rocks to Mardou. And when the little hills or Holmen are northwest
the^ you are before Mardou. The Isle of Mardou has two high warders upon it:
hold on between the Nie-Holmen and the Island (where lies also a suncken
rock near unto the said Isle) And being past the point, edge North northwest
into the great bay, and anchor therein 30. fatham. You have in the Eastern
entry of Mardou but 3. fatham water, and it lies outward and inwardes East
northeast, and west Southwest. Being within the Island, you may cast anchor in
12. or 13. fatham.

From all these havens are transported great store of Oken beams, rafters,
railes, and all kind of Oken wood and timber: and some sawed bordes, and
planckes, which in the low countries are much employed in buildinges.

A PLAIN DESCRIPTION OF THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE EASTERN SEA COASTS OF
NORway, and the countries adjoining.
IF you will enter Tromsounde you may sail in beyond Mardou through the fair
channel, on the Northside stand two warders upon a high hill, where you may
let fall anchor, or sail on farther to Mardou behind Trom Island.

If you will bear in with Oxefoort, keep along under the rock of
Tromsounde, and go first Northwardes: and having brought the long rock on the
Larbord, hold on still Northward: when you are a little way entered you shall
find a rock under water, in the very entry, which you must bring on your
starbord, then continue your course until you are clear of the western
point: where also lies a rock under water near the point. And from thence
sail to the west, and west and by North toward the high land, to the Eastern
shore, where stands an high warder where you may anchor in 20. or 25. fatham.

Between Oxefoorte and Santfort lies Longen, on the Eastern side stands a
mast with a tonne on it: hence off two leagues is Santforde, thwart which
alongest in the sea lies a bank which in some places has but 3. or 4. fatham
water, and ends about West Kiell. West Kiell lies in Northward, and you
may enter hard by the out rocks of Iofferlande, and may sail about the said
Island or anchor behind it in 15. or 20. fatham. Longsande bears from that
Island a great league North northeast. Kings haven stretches inwardes North
northwest where is 30. fatham sounding: hale inwardes alongest the ragged point
from whence the rock called the Baers lies not far: but if you would go to
the Nesse being clear of the great rock whereon stands an high warder on
your starbord, you may sail between the old Longsande, and the said rock
through into the Nesse passing by the ragged Isle: and anchor there in 20. or
30. fatham.

From Longsande set East northeast to Farther, between which lies Larvvicke,
Stavvangen and Tonsbargen. But Bast bears Northward from Farther. And from
thence shape your course to Anslo, Copervvicke, and Soen water, and so
forwards thorough the rocks called Lammeren to Braekenes which is a shallow
river toward the sides, where most part of the fur board and timber is
sawed.

Rogh point lies four leagues North northeast from Farther, the rocks called
the Sisters are 3. leagues Northeast and by North from Farther. The Isle of
Akersounde is distant from thence 5. leagues to the Northeast. In these parts
lie the havens of the Northeast country, where now a days is the chiefest
taking of herringes, which was wont to be in Malstrande.

From all these havens come deal bordes, great and little mastes, rayles,
rafters, timber to make hoopes, fire wood and such like stuff fit for
building.

right situation


AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE NORTHEAST COUNTRIES, where Malstrande is the
cheifest Port.
IF you will sail from the cape called Schagen or Scaw to Masterlande, shape
your course East north east, till you may discover an high round rock or hill,
called Bretto: toward which you must bear East North east, till the rocks
called the Pater nosters be in sight, which you shall leave on your larbord:
And when you shall be nigh the shore, the entry of Masterland will be open
before you on your South side liyng Eastward and East south eastwardes: And
leave the Island wherein stands a beakon or warlocke, on your starbord. But
when you come to the point, then the city lies open before you, make fast a
Cable to the Kay, and cast Anchor to the Seawards. You may sail out again
Southward into the main two or three ways.

If you will bear in with Calfsounde enter hard aborde the great Rock whereon
stands a high warlocke: you may by holding on the same course, sail into
Coyhell and Bahuys: you may also set forwards to the River of Nilues: called
VVinder, between the Rocks, where on the East side you have the main, and the
channel lies open before you. Right before the River lies a ragged Island,
which you must leave on the Larborde. You may anchor under the same in 15. or
16. fatham, the haven is called Reefsounde.

Two leagues Eastward of Reefsounde lies the Island Malesounde which you may
sail round about. Consbaeke lies from thence two leagues to the East north
eastward: Monstersounde stands also on the East Side of the haven: and from
thence VVaersberghe lies 3. leagues to the Southward.

If you will sail to vvaersberghe, bring the Castle which stands in the
main land South of you, and hold on thorough the midst of the channel
between the Island and the Eastern shore, but edge nearer the island because
of the rock vnderwater that stretches out from the eastern point.

There is also a blind Rock at the point of the Island, when you are clear
thereof you may borrow of the Northern shore, and there come to anchor, for it
is broad and 4. or 5. fatham deep.

Part of these Coasts do belong to the government of the King of
Svvedeland, and part to the King of Denmark. Their traffic is all sorts
of Tallow, and such gross wares, Skines, Hides, Barley, and great stoare of
Filberd-nuttes.

North East land part of Norway part of Swedeland as it lies between
Distelbergh and Waersbergh


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL PART OF Denmark, where stands the
famous city of Capen-hauen, the cheifest place of the kings residence.
NOrth-east and by North of Coll, lies an Island called Swedero, which is like
an haven on the inside, but it is open on the Northside. If you cannot go
clear of Coll, bear boldly with the said Island, and hold on straight within
the great rock near the church, where you may anchor in 10. fatham and ride
safely. From Anholte set South southeast toward Zealande. And if by reason
that the wind hangs Easterly you cannot get into the Sound, hale along the
coast of Zealand, on the backside of Haselin, where is good ground in every
place for ankering. There is also a great bay which is a good harborough
ouer-right along the coasts of Zealand for a Northeast wind, where is 5. or
6. fatham water.

To sail into the Sound, hold Southeasterly in from Coll, but bring not the
Isle of VVeen open of Elsenoers castle till you are clear of Svvynebode. Then
may you pass by Lappesande thorough the midst of the channel: and being
past the castle anchor where you list. Toward VVeen are certain places where
is good riding in 7. fatham water, but it lies far from the shore.

If you sail from the Sound to Coppen haven, being come to the end of the
wood, you may sound the whole channel as you go upon 5. or 6. fatham, and not
fail to find the Buy: but keep still in 5. fatham. when the tower of Coppen
haven is Southwest from you, then are you come near the first Buy, where you
have 7. fatham on the East side: hold on from the Northern Buy to the other,
South and by East: borrow of the western coast, if the wind hang westerly, in
6. or 7. fatham, where you have also 9. or 10. fatham water. Set Southward from
the second to the third Buy, for there have you 10. or 11. fatham and then are
you right against Southolme, where it is shallower and narower: from thence
continue your course south, to the Buy of Casperkine, where is 7. fatham water.
The Fissher lies from the Buy in Casperkine East and by North: the west side
thereof is very shallow. Your course from Casperkine to the shoald or sand
called Drakerriff is South, where a Buy lies in 5. fatham water: but from
Drakerriff to Steden South and by westward: and then have you sometimes deeper
sounding. But when you are betwixt Steden and Falsterborne, and the flat broad
tower of Falsterborne be one with the castle, then are you at the point of the
Riffe or bancke where lies a Buy in 4. fatham depth: and there begins the
Eastern sea called the Belt: and may shape your course thence Easterly
toward Brontholme. If you will back again from Steden toward Draker, when
you come near Drakerriff, if the tower of Coppen haven appear on the East
side of Draker wood, bring Draker North and by west off you, so shall you go
clear of the Riff. And when the tower of Coppen haven is to sight a ships
length Eastward from the wood, you are thwart of Drakerriff Buy: where you have
5. fatham water. Your course from Drakerriff to the Buy in Casperkine, is
almost plain North, where it is about 6. or 7. fatham deep, and there the
channel is narrower. But from Casperkine to the other three Buys, set North,
and north and by west, where you have 10. 9. 8. or 7. fatha^ water: when Coppen
haven is Southwest, then are you come to the North Buy. The eye mark of the
other Buy, is, when the broad tower seems to be a ships length off from the
great Church of Coppen haven: The third Buys mark is when the broad and
picked towers are one. But the mark of the Buy in Casperkine, is when the
sharp tower comes over against Coppen haven castle.

All the traffic of these coasts depends most of Malt, Barley, Nuttes,
and store of some kind of Tallow and Fatt: the Herring season there, is now
little worth, which heretofore has been very great.

AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF BLECSIDE AND CALMERSOVNDE lyinge at the entrance of
Swethlande.
IN the Erthholmes there is a Haven of 4. fatham depth. If you will set out
from Santvvicke in Bornholmes toward Ahuys, shape your course North and by
west toward Hano. Hano is a round Islande, and has round about it good
ground for ankeringe. From thence hold on North north west to Ahuys which
lies by a little River. Their commodities and trade is Maulte, Barlie, and all
kind of gross wares (viz.) Pitche, Tar, Tallowe, Hides. etc.

If you will from the East end of Borneholme, to Kalmer, sail from Borneholme
North north east, toward the Rock which lies from thence 14. leagues: then
hold on to Kalmer, first to the North-warde and North and by westward, but
being clear of the Riffe or shoald called Suydernorte, Calmersounde stretches
inwardes North and by East up to Kalmer, until you are clear of the straight
passages of the Rocks which lie before the town.

And from thence plie to the hill called Svveets Yunckfrovv, north north east,
and North and by East.

Suydernorte bears toward the west point of Oclande: From whence
stretches a foul rockie bank or riffe, South and by west, a league and a
half out into the Sea, and in the fair way by the South Side of Oclande, you
have 28. or 31. fatham water about 3. leagues from land. The Isle of Oclande
is long and narrow, and has 18. flat towers.

The trade of Calmer, and the countries adjoining, is Tar of Svvedelande, all
kind of Fells, and Skins of wild beasts, Salt, Hides, Goats skins,
gross wares, and some Brass and Iron.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF WESTERWICK ABOUT THE mount of the Swethish
Yunck-frow, the beginning of the rocks called the Schares of Swedeland.
THe mount called Sweetse Yunck-frow or young maiden, bears 8. leagues from
Calmer N. N. E. and North and by East: and Silbuy is the first haven within the
Schares, from whence you may set between the Schares to VVestervvike, Flerbuy,
and schelsheuer: for your way is fair. The entries of Stockholme lie 18.
leagues from Svveetse yunckfrovv North north-east: and the coast of Stockholme
turns up East. The entries stretch inwardes, first North-east and by north,
and after North north-east to Durhauen setting the rock called VVigsteen on
the Larbord side, and the middle steene on the starborde. The rock which is
called the redd Cow lies two leagues within the entries. And the entries of
Stockholme lie inwardes from Durhauen for the most part North west, Northwest
and by west, and North and by West to VViexholme. within the Schares of
VVestervvicke is every where good anchor hold in 16. or 20. fatham.

The foresaid havens are subject to the king of Svvedelande, and in a short
time are grown so welthie that now there is great traffic of all kind of
commodities viz. of Tar, Barley, Malt, diverse sorts of skins and other
marchaundizes, besides gross wares and nuttes, but chiefly Iron and Brass.

The famous Isle of Gothland part of the dominion of the king of Denmark lies
upon the coasts of vvestervvicke or Svvedelande, and is about 10. or 12.
leagues off the shore. The notablest port thereof is VVisbuy a city in time
past the mart for many countries, and much haunted by reason of the
intercourse of factors, where al laws concerning seafaring and sea rights were
established and ordained: but the Islande being impouerished and utterly
destroyed by cruel wars, at this day lives by husbandry. Notwithstanding there
is still some traffic of Pitch and Tar. It contains in length eighteen
leagues, and in breadth five: has eighteen villages with spear steeples. It
took name of the Goths, which did once inhabit it.

A PLAIN DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS BETWEEN Weiburghe and the Narue the
farthest parts of the Belt, with their situations and commodities.
THe Isle of Somer bears 9. leagues from Hogelande Northeast more Easterly.
But your course from Hoglande to the Island called Putsfager lies Northwest
and by north: From thence you may sail within the Schares of Svvedeland where
you list. From Putsfager set toward Somer East, and East and by South: and from
Somer toward the Island called Red Hell North east, and north east and by
north: you have two Rocks on the Larborde in the very channel, called the
Eastern and western Fishers. From Red Hell to Tralesande it is counted 2.
leagues almost Northeast, from whence you must go crossynge northeasterly in
and out from Beaken to Beaken till you come to VVeyburgh, where the Eastern sea
ends. The Isle of Somer lies near the coast of Rusland, having right
against it the Schares of East Finland.

The Narue bears 10. leagues from Somer South east: leave the Isle Tutters on
the starre-borde side: when you come near the Narue, you shall descerne a Maste
with a Barrel on it upon the strand, keep that right over the wooden castle,
and hold so along the shore into the river of Narue.

The Narue is known by the round hills Southward of the Road: and you have
from thence unto Eackholme 14. leagues northward. About the North, and North
and by Eastward of Telsbourgh lie the Rocks of the greater and lesser Hooft or
head, about which are many shoaldes which you must avoyde. The lymie shoald or
kalke ground of 2. or 3. fatha^ depth stretches down into the sea from the
greater Hooft almost to Eackholme.

Under Eackholme you have harborough, and clear ground on every side.
Lyfeland shore all along up to Narue has no rocks at all. North west and by
west of Hogelande lies a rock under water, about 3. leagues of the shore in
2. fatham.

In these parts of Rusland and svvedeland, in times past none might traffic
but those of Lubek, whereby they became very wealthy. For there are rich and
costly marchandises, (viz.) All kind of Skins, Furs, Hemp, Flax, Tallowe,
wheat, Rye, and such like.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF LIFLAND ABOUT REVEL AND Moonsound and of the coasts
adjoining.
FRom the Isle of Nargen to the buy you have a great league East and by South:
and from the buy to Revel two great leagues: not far from the Isle of
VVolfsound is a blind rock: when the tower of Revel appears over the point
of the Island you are come near the Rock which lies half a league Northwest
from VVolfsound. On the East side of vvolfsound are two Islandes called
VVrangen, you may anchor within them in the channel at 10. or 12. fatham. A
league and a half to the North northwest of them, lies a blind rock: and an
other half a league off plain North. The shore of Lyfland is all clear
ground.

If you will sail from Oegens-holme into Moonsund, keep South southwest, and
Southwest and by west, until you are within Osse-holme. Grasholme lies a
league beyond Osseholme which you may sail round about or ride there at your
pleasure. Grasgrond lies a league within Grasholme in the midst of the
channel: but borow of the land of Syburgnesse or Dagerorts, along by the little
Islands a reasonable distance off, keep within all the Islandes S and by E. and
S. until you come to the western coast of Oesell nigh the great tree, where
you have 4. fatham water, sometimes but three. Hold on along the coast of
Oesell four or five leagues Southeast and by East till you come to a little
Island, then keep on between that Island and Oesell, until you come to the
farthest parts of Oessell where is 8. fatham water. Half a league from thence
lies a shoalde called the Pater noster which you must sail aloufe off. Then
may you plie again Southward to Runen, which is an Island situate ten leagues
hence in the great bay of Righe.

Revel, being the most famous Mart of the whole country, so flourished
thirty years past, that every year there arrived and were unladen above an
hundredth great ships with salt, which were also wont to be fraighted there
again with Wheat, Rye, Wax, Flax, Hemp, all kind of Skins and Furs,
and such like commodities of good value. But it is now so decayed by reason of
the continual wars with the Muscouytes, that through the whole year there
are scarce six ships laden: which has been to the general impouerishing of
this city and country.

A PLAIN DESCRIPTION OF RIGHE AND PARNOVT, AND OF the Islandes adioyninge.
YOu must sail from Domesnest to Runen 6. leagues East, and East and by North:
and from Runen to the northeren coast of Oesell, where Moonsound begins, you
have 10. leagues North, and North and by East: from Runen again unto Kyne 8.
leagues East north east. From Kyne to Pernout it is 7. leagues North east and
by East, where in the entry you have but 6. or.8. foot depth, the channel
sometimes shifteth from place to place, and serves only for small vessels,
called Boyers. There stands a little town between Pernout and Righe called
Salles where lies a shoald in 8. foot depth before the entry, and serves
likewise but for small vessels.

Duinemonde of Righe bears from Runen 12. leagues South east. The eye marks
to enter the river of Duina, are when the watch-house that stands a little way
from the castle of Duinemond is one with the great tree, and the southside of
the city of Righe with the point of Terspille. These are the right marks to
sail into the River a good ways, turn then up sometimes Southward, till you
come between both lands. Then borrow of the South coast to the point of
Terspille, where you may anchor in any place in 6. or 7. fatham: you must go by
your Lead because the channel alters almost every year 4. leagues: to the
Southward of Domesnest is a little river where many small vessels do lade.

In these two places thirty or forty years past was great traffic of al
kind of costly marchandizes which through the continual wars with the
Muscouytes is almost utterly decayed. Notwithstanding there is yet some
traffic at Righe, for every year thirty or forty ships laden with Salt
are there discharged: and above an hundred ships are likewise fraighted with
wheat, Rye, Clawbordes and waynscot, wax, Flax, Hemp, Pitch Tar, Salt, and
dry Hides, Sheepe-skinnes, Furs and other like commodities of good value.

A MOST PLAIN DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLE OF OESEL, WHICH lies between the Belt
and the bay of Righ, and stretches up from the narrow entry or straight
toward Righe and Parnout.
YOur course from Domesnest to Runen is 6. leagues East and by North: and so
far lies Abbrick from Runen, whereaboutes are many dangerous shoaldes in
your fair way 3. or 4. fatham deep: But being past Domesnest, you may see it
when you are a great league from Oesell. Aberburgh bears westward of it,
where ships are fraighted with Barley, Malt, Tar, all kind of gross
wares, and diverse Skins and Furs. From Domesnest lies a very dangerous
riffe or a rough and stone bancke, a league out into the sea, Northeast, and
Northeast, and by East. The road of Oesell, lies from Domesnest three leagues
Northwest, and Northwest and by west: where in 7. fatham is good ground to
anchor. There stretches down also from the South end of Oesell a riffe or
bancke two leagues in length into the sea Southward, and South and by westward,
which is both hard and roomie: westward from this riffe lie many scattering
shoaldes and banckes which stretch out Northward along the coast of Oesell,
where in many places you have only 2. 3. 4. 5. fatham etc. There are besides
in Oesell two other havens where ships are laden: viz. VVyck, and another 5.
leagues from thence Northward.

Hontsfort, bears from VVyck eight leagues North, and from thence have you
six leagues to Dagerort North Northwest wherein stands an high Tower, which
you may see on both sides of the land. Between both these heads you may sail
to Hontsvvick, which is a perilous bay: for there are many shipwrackes by
reason the pilots are not skillful thereaboutes. Now that I may again set
down the entrance of Moonsound. Sail from Runen North, and North and by East,
to the North point of Oesell, and they lie ten leagues one from an other: but
bear aloufe from the shoald called the Pater noster, which joins to Oesells
point: when you are clear of it, you may see a little Island which you must
bring on the starbord: hold on in 8. fatham depth between Oesell and that little
Island, then set Northwest til ye get another Island on the starreborde side,
whereupon stand two or three high trees, but keep alongest the coasts of
Oesell until you see a great tree: which being past, you shall perceive many
little Islandes on your Larbord, which you must set half a league on the same
side from you. In this place you may best consider by your compass how all the
channels of this entry do stretch: Oesell, is a rough country and very hard
to be known by such as are on the outside of the coasts.

This Charte also contains part of Curland, where stands Dervvind the
cheifest city, yet known to few Sea men: and sometime (though very seldom) a
small vessel or two are fraighted there with clowbord and wainscot.

A LARGE DESCRIPTION OF PRVSLAND WHEREOF DANTzick is the chiefest mart.
IF you will sail from Heell to Dantzyck, conde South and South and by west
toward the castle of Termonde, where you must pass through the old entry
from the Eastwarde: go in between two Buys, until you are clear of the
Peerres, called kysten: where along lies a new entry which now is very
commodious for little vessels called Boyers. From Heell to the entry of
Kingsborovv, shape your course full East, where you shall commonly have two
entries (viz.) the one lying South southeast up along the high land of
Hanheer, the other E, and E, Southeast: But you must not trust much to the
incertentie, because every year they change their course, sometimes Southeast,
and at other times inwards South Southeast, when you are within, there is a
great Lake, called the Hafr, whith parts it self two ways, the one toward
Meluing, the other toward Kingsborovv. Your course to Meluing lies
Southsouthwest, and South and by west, but Kingsborovv bears about six
leagues East and by Northward.

Moreover if you will set out from Righ head toward Memell your right course
is twenty leagues Northeast and by East: the entrance of Memell is 2. fatham
deep: being within it: turn westward, and being clear of the point anchor in
5. fatham water.

Southward up lies a notable great bay or Lake called the Haft, into which
runs Chronus the river of Memell out of Littuania, from whence comes great
store of flax: and likewise the River of Dune near unto Kingsborovv: so that
many streams do meet in this Lake.

The Dukedom of Prusland contains five notable mart towns viz. Dantzike,
Meluing, Brimburgh, Kingsbourgh and Memell, amongst them all Dantzike is held
for the cheifest, where every day is sold above a 1000. lastes of wheat and
rye, and likewise Rafters, Pitch, Tar, Flax, Hemp, Pruse beer, commonly
called Iupenbeer, and many other commodities of great prise. The trade in
Meluinge and Brimsburghe is of such like merchandises in great abundance: at
kingsbourgh is the cheifest staple for dealebord, and clowbord. It yields
also great store of Wheat, Rye, Flax, Wax, Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Soap Ashes
and like merchandises in such great quantity, that it may worthily be counted
amongst the most famous. And so also may Memell, whose traffic is most of
Flax, besides all such merchandises as may be had in kingsborough. But I
purpose not to perticularize every thing that is transported thence.

Notwithstanding I must confess that this is a most fertile and plentiful
country, which God has blessed above all her neighbors and other countries.

THE CARD of the sea coasts of the land (...) with all the havens and ru^^s
from Memel unto Heel


AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE COASTS OF POMERLAND and the countries adjoining.
Five Leagues from Vernorde lies Righe head, and from thence to Serneuisse you
have 3. leagues: along the shore runs a small River, which farther
inwards spreads into a great Lake. And from Serneuisse to Liba it is five
leagues where a creek goes in called the Osse. On the East side thereof stand
many little rocks or stumpes, called VVollesaken. From thence unto Reefcoll,
(which is a high Mountain whereby the coaste is known) you have four leagues
and so far lies the Stolp or Gars-head from Reescoll, where is the mouth of
a little River, fit for vessels of light burden. From Gars-head to Revvold it is
three leagues: in that entry called VVipper you have 4. fatham. Colesbourghe
lies from Revvolde seven leagues, where also lies a little stream or creek
called Radyng. Between Colesbourgh and Iasmonde are reckned 12. leagues, and do
lie plain East and west the one from the other. South east and Northwest from
Colsbourgh bears the Island Borneholme, where you have round about good
anchor hold. Eertholmen is distant from Borneholme two great leagues North
Northeast.

Upon the coasts of Pomerland stands Stattyn the principal mart town of
that country, from whence is transported great store of Wheat, Rye Barley,
Maulte, and the Beer of Mesons. There lies also the Island of Rughen, which
at sometimes yields great plenty of Rye, but commonly it is restrained by
the inhabitants.

A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW DEEP THAT Stretches up to Stattin and
Mesound, and of the Sea coasts of Mekelenburgh, Lubeck, the Belt, Greensound,
Moon. etc.
IF you will sail into the new deep, set from Iasmonde two leagues South
Southeast toward the wood called Peert or Bock, from whence you must hold on
a league Southerly. The entry turns inward west Southwest, where you have
shallow water, both within and without: As you sail, set Mesound on the
starborde and Stattyn on the larbord side, where is commonly calm water.

Grypsvvolde is situate upon the very mouth of a litte river before you as you
go in.

If you will pass through the Yell, which runs near Dorenbosch, keep
between the coasts of Barts and the Isle of Rughen, where you have but 1. or
2. fatham water, and is only for small vessels. This course may you also take
to sail into Mesound: at Barts you have a little river or creek goinge in,
which bears only Boyers and other small vessels.

Southwest and by west from VVitmond lies Rostvvyck 12. leagues, and is a port
for small vessels, and from Rostvvick to VVismere have you 7. leagues
Southwest, it is a good haven for all ships. Lubeck lies from vvismer first
to the west South west, and then South west and by south, where is a deep
channel for great ships to pass thorough, for the shoald or bar that lies
in the entry is of 12. foot depth. There have you a great Bay or a notable
good haven most safe for any wind, except a Northeast and a North northeast.

From thence bears Femeren eight leagues, and your course lies from thence
South southwest and North northeast. The Belt runs in between Longland and
Laland: From the coasts of Laland stretches out a Riff into the sea a league
distant from Langland: when you have brought the Tower of Maschou Northwest
from you, then do you strike upon the Riff: wherefore shape your course near
Longland side in 5. fatham water, and so shall you go clear of the point
called Laland Haecken. But when the said Tower bears East Northeast from you,
you are past the point, then conde Northward unto Sproy, along Langeland.
Under the Isle of Moon is good anchor ground on both sides, albeit from the
North coast there stretches out a Riff within which you may anchor: and on the
South side there is good harborough from a North northeast, and a Northwinde
viz. from the Northeast to the northwest side along hard by the point, the
ground is fair and clear from rocks, as you may perceive by the charte.
Geester-riff, lies six leagues South southwest from the point of Moon.

This country of Mekelenburgh utters sundry sorts of Beer viz. Mesan
Rostroyck, and Lubeck Beer, besides much Rye, Wheat, Tallow, VVood, and
skins: In the Island of Rughen, which belongs to this Dukedom, is good
store of Rye.

Femer also is one of the chiefest places both for wheat, Barley, Malt, and
such like things. Over against Femer lies Laland from whence is carried at
sometimes some small quantity of Barley and Malt.

Belt, which thwart over against Laland Riff is 6. or 7. fatham deep. The North
coast of Langland is five or six leagues Northward from hence: but the Sproy is
not past three leagues to the Northwest from the Northbound of Langland, and
you may sail round about it: from the South coast of it, there trendeth a riff
well near a quarter of a league into the sea. The sound of Newburgh is distant
from thence two leagues Southwest and by West: and it is roomy and large: You
must give a good birth off the Northern bulwark, because it is rockie. The
entry has 5. 6. and 7. fatham water. There is the kings custom paid. There is
a little Island to the Southwardes of Newburghs mouth, called Frisell, that way
may you sail to Flensburgh between the Island and Swyneland: In the same
course you shall meet with another little Island called Omen.

Groen sound, or the Northbound of Laland, is two great leagues of Sproy: And
Groen sound sloweth between Zealand and Laland: but hard by Geester riff it
falls again into the Traue of Femeren: there the Belt is 10. or 12. fatham
deep. The Riems lie two leagues North Northwest from the Sproy and as much from
Knoutshead. Now Riems is an Island about the point of Finland, and can hardly
be sailed about, for that there wants water at the West side: under it there is
good road on both sides, in 6. or 7. fatham. The uttermost part of Swyneland
lies North and by West, two leagues from Riems. From hence the Isle of Sampson
lies about two great leagues, on the South side whereof are many straggling
shoalds of two or three fatham: Between the North point of Finland and the
South point of Sampson you may sail into Meluersound, which runs between
Yutland and Fynland.

It has many Ports wherein ships are fraught, to wit, Flensbourgh,
Hadderslo, Meluer, and many other little towns as may be seen in the
particular Table.

From Riems Northwest four leagues lies a shoald called the Beltsack in the
midst of the channel: from whence three leagues to the North north east,
stands a high Rocky Island called VVero: This course or channel has 10. or
12. fatham. There are three or four other Rocks or Holmes to the Westward:
between which in many places you may sail in small Boats, but the course is
most perilous, because it is full of rocks and shoalds between the Sampson
and the VVero.

About Northeast from VVero is Syro a little Island: between these two is a most
dangerous sand called Hatters riff, yet keeping on your course a quarter of a
league of them, you shall go clear of it: you have 4. or 5. fatham water on
the side next to VVero, but on the East side of Syro, you have deeper water fit
for great vessels.

Rednes is three great leagues South and by West from Syro: and of the North
west side of Syro there is a a Riff or shoald to be taken heed of: Both of
them in many places show above water. Stephen head lies from these sands
fiues leagues North Northwest.

The great Helmes lie from VVero and Hatersriff two leagues, North Northwest
having 4. or 5. fatham depth.

From hence into Arhuse sound, your course lies near hand West Northwest:
Arhuse is seated in a Bay which has 2. or 3. fatha^ depth. Southward from
Arhuse sound runs VVedersound, between Yuthland and Sampson but every where
full of Shoaldes: So that he that will sail it, has need of good experience
of this course: For it abounds with shoaldes and sands. But between the
great Helmes and Yuthland there is 6. or 7. fatham deepth. Stephens head lies
from the great Helmes five leagues, first Southeast and then North northeast.

Half a great league Southward of Stephens head lies a shoald of two or three
foot water, called Caleground: Southward whereof there runs in the
Grymsound, in which you may sail up to Grimstead, which is a haven fit to
frayght Pinnaces and such like vessels.

From the South point of Stephens head lies Aelburgh sound, Seven leagues off
North and by West: In the very haven or sound there are two Buys, and there
is almost two fatham water.

On the West side of that Sound is a flat steeple called Hals, from whence to
Haselyng (which is an Island near to Codanonia or Zeland) the course is
fifteen leagues almost Southeast and by east.

From the North coast of Haseling about two great leagues North east and by
North lie the shoaldes of Looseground or quicksande, which have not past four
or five foot water. The Island may be seen in the Wast of the ship: if you
set sail from out of the Sound with a West wind take heed of these shoaldes.

But if you will set from Stephens head toward Sebuy, you shall meet with a
bancke of 6. or 7. fatham, called Sweetering thwart off Aelburgh sound: But
when you are come so far that the high hill behind Sebuy begins to appear
to you Northwest and by North, set your course North northwest: and when you
have shallow water, then have you the right course.

The Riff or sand of Lesow has 8. or 9. fatham water in the channel: but the
shifting shoaldes have but 2. or 2. and a half.

The Cape of Denmark called the Schaghen or Scaw, lies six leagues North and
by East from thence.

The traffiques of these countries are manifold: viz. Suet, Fatt, and all kind
of Tallow, and other marchandises, as Filbeards, Barley, Malt, Wheat, Rye,
and such like.

A CARD of the Beldt, with all the Sea coasts, Bounds, and Site of the
countries called Laland, unto Steuens head


A PLAIN DESCRIPTION OF THE UTTERMOST COASTE OF JVTLAND, that stretches out
with a point toward the farthest parts of the North sea opposite to Norway.
IF you will sail from Schagen called the Scaw toward Sebuy, your right
course lies six leagues South and by west: Southwardes of it are dangerous
scattering shoaldes or sands, in 2. 3. or 4. fatham, but in the channel you
have 5. or 6. fatham water. The broad tower of Hals bears from Sebuy five
leagues South southwest, and South and by west, on the east side whereof is the
deep of Aelburgh. In the entry are two Buys, and the Tower called Hals
stands on the Northside thereof: Aelburgh lies three leagues from the deep
up the river. Two leagues Eastward of the deep is a shoalde called Svveteryn
of 6. or 7. fatham depth, which you must strike over sailing into the Belt: for
in the Channel you have 10. or 11. fatham water. The Isle of Leson is all
round about flat and shallow a good league into the sea, containing but 3.
fatham water: but on the Southside the like depth reaches into the Sea two
leagues and it is beeset with banks of 2. or 3. fatham depth: But from the
South coast, where stands a Church, stretches out a riffe toward the East
two great leagues into the sea: within which you may anchor in 6. or 7. fatham
for a South southeast wind: There lies out also from the Northside a riffe a
league into the sea. Tryndell bears from hence three little leagues to the
seaward Northeast, and has a shoald an aker and a half large and is scarce
four foot deep: near to the Northeast part thereof lies always a buy,
least the ships which come from Schagen should strike upon it. The lesser
Helmen bears from Schagen four leagues South southwest, you may sail round
about it for there is no danger and it is 5. fatham deep. Trindell lies from
Schagen six leagues Southeast, somewhat easterly.

If you come by night about Schagen to sail into the Sound, bring the watch
fire, or the fire beakon it self Southwest and by west from you, before you set
South eastwards, for then stands the fire beakon in the midst of the east
town, and you are far enough beyond the Riff or point of Schagen, which are
the surest marks by night. But if you come out of the Sound by night, set the
fire beakon south south west from you before you turn about Schagen Riff up
toward Hartshals: when the watch fire bears South southwest from you, you
may perceive the watch beakon five foot distant Eastwards of the eastern
town, which are most certain marks to go clear of Schagen. But if you will
by night pass by Schagen with an Easterly wind, take heed of the stream or
current of the Belt, for you may easily be carried under Norvvay where there is
a deep, which you must carefully look too.

Aelburg is the chiefest town of traffic of this country, from whence is
transported stoare of Barley and Malt, besides some Hides, Tallow, and such
like things. The outtermost coast toward the northern sea has a hard and
dangerous shore, whereof it stands you greatly upon to beware, for many
ships do there perish, because there be no Havens nor Roades.

A Description of the outtermost coasts of Jutland both of the Belt side and
of the North Sea side as they are situated between Aelburger Diep or haven and
Rijncopen


A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF OF THE SEA COASTS OF JVTLAND CALLED Yotland and of
the havens, streams, rivers and Islandes thereunto belonging.
THere runs in by Bouenbergen a little creek about 2. fatham deep at half
flood: if you will go in there, tarry your tide, and then hold straight into
the haven as the charte shows you: and when you are within the point, cast
anchor where you have 3. fatham at full sea: for within it is shallow and most
commonly dry. If you will enter the creek of Numit or Rincopen, and being come
as far as the shoald of Reef-horne, in 3. fatham depth turn up Northeast and
by North, until you perceive Blevvberch on your starrebord: which lies about
two leagues Southerly from the said creek: and on the sand side of the entry
are two white Downs: When you have brought Blevvberch, East Southeast and
both the white Downs are hidden almost Northeast from you, bear boldly with
the Downs almost hard abord the shore, and then shall you see the land marks
upon the North coast, which when they shall be open before you ten foot
distance one from another, hale along the shore in 2. fatham water (if you
list) with your Lead: But when you are past the two Downs turn over toward
the two land marks and ride within by the North shore in 3. or 4. fatham. The
entry near the Iap stretches inwardes, Northeast and by North, and North
Northeast. Right over against the North side of the white Down stands a
broad Tower, which you must keep so, until the land marks be one: then by
those marks run alongest the Iap in: and it stretches most North North-east
inwards until you are past the land marks: if you will go farther in, stay for
a low water that you may perceive how the dry Shoaldes and sands lie on both
sides for the channel is crooked and must be sounded. Rincopen lies inwardes
about three leagues, and there is eight leagues distance betwixt Numit and
Sursuyt.

If you will sail toward Sursuyt or Scelinckeroog coming from the North
over the shoald called Reefhorne in 3. fatham or thereaboutes, you must conde
along the South side of this shoald in 6. or 7. fatham water until you see
the land on the Larbord, you shall perceive a gray Down called Doodbergh,
hold along the land (which is a low sand stretching from the East to the
Westward) in 3. fatham depth until you are come to the farthest end of the
sand. Then turn up Westward, and being within the sands point, anchor in 3.
fatham water or more. There lies also a river or creek ouerright the corner
or point of this sand, where a Boyer may enter in. Here is the chief place of
fishing of all Iutland: where a ship without either cable or anchor may be saved
in time of need.

From thence bears Graevv diep, three leagues South, Southeast: In the entry
you have at half flood 2 fatham: Northward of the entrance is a point, near
which you may bear in 2. fatham: you may also go in there by your plumet, and
cast anchor when you are past the point: For all the whole channel is crooked
sounding ground, therefore as soon as you are within the point, cast anchor. You
may likewise take your course toward Fanu, in 3. fatham, and so enter along
the South coast. There lies inward a river or creek up into the land,
whereupon stands a little Tower called VVoer, or VVoerd, and on the Westside
of this River Boyers are laden: as soon as you are within Graew diep, there
lies a long sandy hill called Langleg: hale in alongest that sand and leave it
on your Larbord.

Knutse diep lies from Graews diep, two great leagues, where two land marks
stand upon a dry shoald, which you must set almost East Southeast: and East
and by South, and when they are one, you shall find the first Buy: from whence
hold on to the second East Southeast, until you are past the land marks. Then
have you also on the Larbord side a little shoald, when you are past the same
turn up Northwarde toward the beacons and cast anchor in 3. 4. or 5. fatham.
There lie the ships that are bound outward from Rypen. On the South end of Fanu
are two indifferent high white Downs, and are called the Southern head. On
the North side stands a broad Tower whereby the coast is very easily known.
About a great league Southward of Fanu, lies a little round Island called
Manu, from whence stretches a flatt, about a league and a half into the
seaward. As much Southward from thence bears the Isle of Ryme, which is two
leagues long: from thence two leagues into the sea is shallow water. The Diep
of Rypen, goes in between Ryme and Manu, which is naught and all flat, and
now a days not used by such as travel to Rypen. Silt is distant from Rym a
league: between these Islands goes in the best Diep or channel of all
Iutland, for when the water is lowest, it is 5. or 6. fatham deep and
stretches inwardes most East Southeast, and East and by South. On the
Northpart of Sylt is an high read cliff whereon stands a church built minster
like, and a mill. But within Silt you may peceiue a little Island whereon
stands a house: and when you have brought that house about a cables length
Northward of the Northcoast of Sylt, and the black inland begins to cover
the red cliff and to take it from your sight, then are you come to the
entrance, and then sail in East Southeast, until you are within the Rust,
which is left on the starbord side.

And being past it you have yet two other small shoaldes by the point of Sylt
from whence runs down a violent and mighty stream toward the North
coast. In the channel it is 10. 11. and 12. fatham deep. Then turn up
toward the house almost Southeast, and you shall perceive in Sylt a house
which is the Admiralles, whether you must direct your course and cast anchor,
for there is safe riding in all weathers. But if you are bound up to Lutk
Tonderen, you must there take in a Pilott which must sound the channel. Your
course from hence to Tonderen lies East southeast and East and by South: you
may also go in by the shoald of the Isle of Ryme sounding as you pass in 3. or
4. fatham. There is also a little entry hard by Sylt, which you may pass into
under the same Island. But when you are clear of the Rust, turn toward Rym
and sail then upon the marks.

Your course lies from the Vlie to Numit North Northeast more Easterly 40.
leagues.

From the Vlie to Scelenckrooge, you have xxxiiii. leagues Northeast and by
North from the Vlie to Knuyts diep, your course is Northeast and most
Northerly 32. leagues, and this is your way to Ripen.

From the Vlie to Sylt your course lies Northeast 30. leagues, out of this
part of Iutland, comes a great number of Beefes, Barley, Malt, Fatt, Suet,
Tallow and such like.

THE Situation of (...) with the ^auens Rivers, shoalds, and (...) from
Boeuenberger unto the I Will of Silt


An exact and most dilligent description of Eyderste, Ditmers, and of the Sea
coasts adjoining, with their true site and distances.
TO sail from holy land to List or Silt Deep, your course is North, and
North and by West, until you are past the shoald called Amerenborne, which
lies out in vii or viii. fatham depth, almost west south west of the Isle of
Ameren. From whence set North north East, vi. or vii. leagues toward the North
side of Sylt or List: how this Channel is to be entered the former Charte does
sufficiently instruct you. There is also a little deep, near the South shore
of Sylt, fit for small vessels and fisher boats, which at half floode has
about two fatham water. On the South side of this entry, lies a shoald
along the Isle of Ameren, and from thence stretches down, almost 11.
leagues and a half into the sea, where you have iiii. or v. fatham. By night
you can come no nearer this shoald then in 7. fatham water, for about half a
league from the Island it lies above water. And you may anchor under the same
in x. or xi. fatham: then may you see Ameren almost half a league from you,
East, and East and by North. But when it shall be north East from you, or north
East and by East, you are on the South side of the shoald, and may borrowe of
the shore in four or five fatham. Then sail in between Ameren and the said
shoald North, and north and by East, toward the North Coast of the Island. But
about Ameren you must go with your lead until you have brought it Southward
of you, where you shall anchor between the shoaldes of Sylt and Ameren, which
are both dry at low water. There is safe riding in five or six fatham at
half floode for any wind.

And if it happen that you are put to anchor under the same with a ship that
draws much water, bring the north part of Ameren North and by East from you,
and hold on to the North Coast of Ameren until you are clear of the shoald:
where you may anchor in what place you list, because it is there deep enough.
This entry is called the Red deep. If coming from the sea you will sail in
here, set the highest Down of Ameren south East. Sail in between the shoald
and the banks of the narrow deep called Small Deep, until you are come
near the Coast of Ameren. And borrowe along of the shore in vi. or vii.
fatham until you are past the north point of the Island, and set the Island
South from you. But this entry is not for ships of burden. The Fishermen of
Voren do use this place both for their going in and out on the South side of
Sylt. And if you will bear in with Small Deep, bring the Tower of Pielwormen
East and by North, and the highest down of Ameren North. Sail in North north
East by the out shoalds, but when you are within a little way, hold on north
East and by north to Voren, keeping the Isle of Voren on your larboord, and the
north Maze on your starreboord side. The Small Deep has at half floode two
fatham and a half. But if you will sail from holy land to the River of Heuer,
set north east a little more easterly: when you have brought the Tower of
Pielworme north East and by north, and a Cables length northwarde of the
southern Koehuse, or cowhouse, you are at the outtermost buy. Thence hold on to
the second north East, and north-east and by East and the tower of Pielwormen
will stand north north-east. but continue your course from the second buy to
the two first Beacons north east and by East: and from thence to the other two
middle East north-east: and then north-east and by east to the other like
marks, but all these marks stand on the starboord as you go into the River
of Heuer. There is a four square deep stretching to Huis bridge. The entry of
the north Heuer lies near Suderoge which is a very lettle Island having three
or four rewes of houses in it: but at the shoald alled Quaghe it meets
again with the right Channel. There is also a safe Road between Pelworme and
Suderoge, but bear somewhat a loofe of the west side of Suderoge, for there
lies out from thence a small sand: wherefore sail in along the land of
Pelworme, and you shall see a green Island called Nubell, where you may anchor
on the west side in four or five fatham, for there is safe riding for ships
fraighted and ready to go out. But if you will to Huyse, you may set the Isle
of Nubell on your larboord side, and return again into Huyse-deepe. There is
also a Channel or entry near the land of Eydorsteede, leave the shoald
called Quaghe on the larboord side, and enter north, north-east, until you are
past the Beakons which stand upon Quaghe, and when you are come again to the
true Channel of Heuar, which lies inwards most north-east and by east, in the
very entry of Heuar you have iii. fatham water, but on the shoalde called
Suidbalge only two and a half.

But if you will go from holy Island to Eyder: shape your course east and by
north, till you perceive the Tower of Gartingen on the south side of the
Downs, and north-east and by north from you. By these marks sail along by
the shoald called Blaewart as long as you have v. or vi fatham, where you may
gage water. But when you have brought Wisselen-beeren east and by north at v.
or vi. fatham enter east south-east and east and by south, turning sometimes
eastward, until you are clear of the new ground: for then will the Beakon
upon the shoald of the Hont stand south south-east from you. But when the
Church of Taringhen appears a ships length eastward of the Village Ees, you
are past the new ground. Then hold on about a league and half north
north-east toward the Green land called Coeberge: and if you are to take in
any Oxen, hale along this shore north north-east, bearing sometimes somewhat
more casterlie to Vlckehorne: into the Channel called Doodebalge which you
must warpe out of. But when you are right against the south side of Coeberge,
there you enter into the Channel called Hetlanddeep which stretches down from
the little Downs on the south-west: and from thence reaches Eyder straight up
to ^onnenghen, first east, and east and by north along Dinners shore and
then northeast to Tonnenghen. The depth of Eyder is almost in every place like,
and at half flood it has v. vi. or vii. fatham. If you will from Eyder to the
Pipe, set small sail a while until the Church of Tatinghen appear right to
the most easterly house of Ees. Then sail between the uttermost part of Hont
and the shoald of Blaeworte, about a quarter of a mile: where at half flood
you shall find two fatham and a half water: so holding on a little, you shall
come to the Channel, of Pipe, in v. or vi. fatham. There set almost east
south-east until you are past the Beakon, and from thence south-east and by
east, somewhat more southerly toward the shoalds of Hunen, whereon stands a
Beakon, and there have you safe harborough for any wind: you may also turn in
northward within the Riff or shoald, and anchor before Buysen. If you will go
from Buysen to the Elue: run through the Channel called Black stroome almost
south-west, where you have in the way two or three Beacons, set them on the
starboord side as you sail out, and you shall enter the Elue near unto the
seventh buy. And then shall you have Neweworke almost south-west from you.

If you will sail to the Elue from holy land, your course is south-east and by
east, and when the marks are one, you find the outermost or first buy, and the
Neweworke will stand from you south-east and by south, from the first buy to
the second, set east, and east and by south. And from thence to the buy that
lies by the new entry, east north-east, and north-east and by east. This buy
lies from the Neweworke south, and south and by east. Hold on from the buy
called Coolton, to the fourth buy north-east, somewhat more easterly: from
whence to the fifth buy east north-east, and from the fifth to the sixth sail
east somewhat to the northwardes. The sixth buy and the New work, lie
south-west and by south, and the north east and by north. These buys lie not
as they were wont, but are new placed in a rank not far from the New
Shoaldes: wherefore look dilligently to your tide, about these four or five
buys, for the flood enters south-easterly through the new shoaldes, and the
ebb contrariwise sets through the northren shoaldes: but you may sound the
new shoaldes in v. or vi fatham (viz.) from the fourth buy to the farthest part
of the new shoalder from the vi. buy to the vii. your course lies east and by
south, and east south-east: and from the vii. to the viii. south-east, and
south east and by east, and from thence to the ninth, where the shoald is
called Kos, south-east, and south-east and by south: then from this buy to the
shoald called Meem: south-east and by east, and from Meem to Crutporte. or the
first buy which lies in the open stream, east south-east: and then set
toward the shoald called Pilgrimsand, or the buy in Do east and by south,
which you may sail unto in four or v. fatham water: from thence to
Brunsbuttell hold eastward, next to the shoald of Saltshorne or Friburghe
eastward along the north shore, then keep east southeast along the north
shore, to the buy which lies over against Steur, and then forwards to the buy
that lies upon Rugero^tesande south-east and south-east and by east. This buy
is right against Bilenburghe in the midst of the Channel, and there have you
also an other buy. Now keep on south south-east from Rugerorie to the buy
upon Stadersand, leaving the buy on the starboord and the Fishers stakes on
the larboord side, from thence to the buy in the Channel called Willern^
Vliet, or Luy, south-east, and south-east and by south: and so to the buy of
Terloo east southeast: and from thence hold eastward to the buy in Hanneball:
but from Hanneball you must plie toward the buy upon the shoald called
Blanckenewsand east, and east and by north: keep this buy aunswering to the
great tree upon Blancknewsand, haling northward along the shore to the
fyshing place, and from thence edge south-east to the buy that lies upon
Bucht, so to Ecchour east by north, and where you have 3. or 4. fa water as
your course lies. The Elue has xiiii. or xv. fa. without the Channel, and a
little from Scorton buy lies Honts balch stretching inwards for the most part
south south-east and south and by east to the Beacons which stand on the west
side, but without it is wide and large and serves for small Vessels to pass by
the shoald called Wadt into the Weser. Between the Weser and Honts balch are
two other Roades called Balgen. If you be distressed about the southern shoalds
called Sudergronden, sail to them in five or six fa. water. and after hale
along by them but when you shall have found a greater depth (viz.) viii. or
ix. fa. and yt you gage water, you are come to the other shoalde. They lie both
inwards east south-east: and all the shoares may be sounded until you have a
safe Road within the shoaldes. The southern or western shoald called
Breebalge lies a kenning from the New work. If you will sail into the
Weeser shape your course toward the Islande called Wrangeroaghe in vii.
fatham water: then edge north-east, till you have x. or xi. fatham depth, where
lies the uttermost buy north north-west of Menser Church, and at the outermost
part or end of Red sand. From thence hold on to the fifth buy eastward which
lies at the head of the Red sand, and north and by east of Menser Church, on
the north side thereof begins the middle shoald called the Midleplate:
between which, and the white grounds you may pass with your plummet in four
fatham water to go to the Elue. for the shoaldes called white ground are but
three or four fatham deep The flood sets into this Channel or course by the
Red sand southeast. and the eb contrariwise from the buy at the head of the
shoald, to the buy that lies in the maine Channel or way south-east and
south-east and by south. And in the same way lies also an other buy, and the
course from the true deepth to the buy called Nolletton is south east somewhat
more easterly: and this buy lies at the end of the high way called the Hoogs
wegh. And from thence to the buy in Bolsserfile south-east a little more
southerly, from thence to the wicker mark called the Bolbaecken, south
south-east, which being past you shall find an other Beakon, where you have
good harborough for a west wind. From the mark called Bolbaecken to the buy
in the open Channel set south-east more easterly, or from the other said mark
east south-east, and south-east and by east. That buy lies north north-east of
Longworde Church. And the Boelbaecken bears northward of the same Church your
course from the first buy of this shoald to the next, lies east south-east,
and south-east and by east, and it is at the end or foot of Cappelmans sand,
you may pass on the west side of it in two fa. and a half at half flood.
Between these buys are two or three Beakons which you must leave on the
larboord, you may sail from the innermost buy of the shoald by Cappelmans
sand, toward Waddens south-east and south south-east, then along the west
shore to Blixen, where is the Road for ships that go out. But if you go to
the Wester Weser called Iaa, hold on toward the Island Wrangeroghe in four or
five fatham water, and sail in eastward till you are past the said Island,
where you have the first buy at the point of Steenbalge shoald, which you may
sail in by at three or four fatham water, where also Mensser Church stands
south from you, from thence set east south-east to the second and third buys:
east and by south from thence lies a buy called Iaa tun: from hence you may
almost perceive an other buy in Weeser Channel, north and north and by east.
From the buy upon the shoalde called Mensser-olde-ort, to Scollich-ort or
Huick-syll, keep south and south and by west: but from Huick-syll, along the
west shore, south and south and by east: and from Huick-syll to Sypkes sand
east south-east and south-east and by south, you may sail by the shoald of
Sypkessand but hold along the east shore till you come to the passage, then
turn westward and let fall anchor: it is there large and wide, and full of
little Islands inwards. The worst depth of the Iaa is of three fatham. But if
you will into Harle deep, set toward the Island Spickerooges in three or
four fatham where you shall enter eastward, and there you have the outmost
buy, from whence you may go to the next, east, and east and by south: where at
half floode is two fatham depth: and a little after you are past this other
buy, there lies a shoalde which you may pass by on both sides, and your
course then lies south south-west, and otherwhile more southerly to Fouksyle.
There lies out from the west point of ye Islande Spikerooghe a Riffe, sail in
on the southside of that Riffe, at the entry called Ossebalche along the
Island called Langerooche in three or four fatham, but in the very enttry
within the ryffe you have only two fatham water, but when you are come to the
farthest part of the Isle Langerooche bear toward the riffe, for between
that and the shoald is 7. or 8. fatham water. when you are clear off the
should, hold on south-east, then toward the Wester Wadt more east, and south
south-east. The enter course and traffic of these Coasts and Havens is of
many sundry kinds of merchandises, as Soap Ashes, wheat, Rye and Barlie. They
yield also salt and dry: Mydes, sawed Boards, Timber, Pitch, Tar, Hamborough
Bear, Tallow etc. And many other commodities. But the cheifest and principal
Mart of these Contries is Hamboroughe.

A MOST EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE SEA COASTS OF FRISELAND, WITH the rivers of
Weser and Emes, and of Scholbalch.
IF you will sail into the Weser, shape your course toward the Isle of
VVrangerough in 9. fatham: but take heed of the wester VVeser, which goes in
near the Island of VVrangerough. From hence hold on Northeast until you come
to the first Buy, and then will Menset bear South Southeast from you. Menser
church that stands in Vrovv land, is square and has no steeple: your right
course from the first Buy to the fifth lies for the most part East and East
and by North. And when you are come to the fifth Buy Menser will stand to your
sight South Southwest. Then go South southeast to the Buy that lies upon the
Maller: and from thence to the Buy in the channel Southeast: and so forward to
the Buy that lies in Bolsersyle, Southeast and by south: and being past it,
conde toward the South coast, where you have two beacons, and safe harborough
for a west wind. And you may turn over into the river of Iad, by the point of
the red sand: for there lies a Buy between the fair way and the red sand.

If you will sail into East Eames, it stretches in alongest by Borckomfriff,
East Southeast: wherefore if you come from the East, bring the Tower of Borckom
South and by East from you, and go in toward Borckoms shore in 4. or 5.
fatham: then hale so alongest the shore till the tower be South southwest from
you. Then turn up toward Iayst, for you are clear of the Riff, so that you
cannot strike upon the same. And when you are past the East end of borckom
called Hooghen horn, you find high sands on both sides: and on the west side
stand beacons where you may sail in from beacon to beacon: for so long as
Norden Tower and the Island come not together, you incur no danger in the
East Eams: but when that Tower is one with the Isle of bant, you meet with a
bancke or shoald called Kings-platt: wherefore keep along the west shore
from beacon to beacon to Pelsommer shoald and you shall go safe.

But if you will bear in with the wester Emes, bring the Island called the
Bosch south and by East, and the west end of Rottom Southeast from you and the
shore marks in one, and sail in so to the first Buy where it is 6. fatham
deep: from thence to the second Buy East, and East and by North which lies at
low water in 4. fatham: and so forward to the third Buy Eastward where you have
at low water 5. fatham: and from thence hold on to the other two Buys East
and by South, where it is 6. fatham deep, and sometime more, as 7. or 8.
fatham: until you come unto Hubets shoald: and keep then most along by the
Riff to Borckom East southeast: from borckom unto the Ranzeel South East and by
East: and from Ranzeel to the Buy that lies upon the shoald called Ruyd, East
Southeast. On the west side of it stand 3. beacons: from that Buy toward
Eamshorne set East Southeast where are two beacons betwixt: but when you are
past Emes-horne, hold on sometimes Southeast, South southeast, South, and at
last South south west, toward Groninger land through the straights, where also
upon the west shore you have three beacons: and from thence hale along near
the coasts of Groninger, southeast, and East southeast, that you may go clear
of the shoald called Paep: which lies opposite to Delfsyll, and appears above
water at a low ebb. And when you have gotten Fermsum, cross over toward
Knock least you strike on the shoald called Riddersant. And then must you keep
along the coast of Eamden two cables length off to Loegen. By Knock is the
road for ships that go out. But if you will sail into Scholbalch, you find two
Buys in the very entry which stretches inwardes by the shoald called
Peerdemart. Bring the shore marks of the Island Schirmonick-ooghe in one, and
sail along the said shoald from the first Buy to the second, until you are
hard abord Schirmenick-oogh. Then enter in South southwest and turn up
southward, and at the last south southeast to the banck. And so run through the
channel toward Groningh southeast, and toward Dockum south.

There lies also an entry on the Eastside, which stretches in southwest
alongest the Island schirmonicke-ooghe, until you are past the beacons of
scholbalch. And by the schelling runs in boren diep, where you have 3. or 4.
fatham water: fail in leaving Boren Riff on your Larbord, for the most part
East, and East southeast to the coast of Ameland.

The traffic of these countries is not very great: some corn is transported
from the VVeser and good store of bremer beer, crooked wood, and like things
out of Oudenburgh, where Breme is the chiefest tower. The greatest intercourse
by sea is at Emden: but such abundance of Butter, Cheese Bacon, Barley,
Beans, Pease and such like merchandise is transported from Gronighe, and
Frisland, as suffices for the substance almost of all the low countries and
German, to the great benefit and commodity of the inhabitants.
