A new book of purgatory which is a dyaloge and dysputacyon between one
Comyngo an Almayne a Christen man / and one Gyngemyn a turk of Machomett law /
dysputynge by natural reason and good phi losophye / whether there be a
purgatory or no purgatory. which book is divided into three dyalogys.

The first dyaloge shows and treats of the merueylous exystens of god. The
second dyaloge treats of the immortalyte of mannys soul. The third dyaloge
treats of purgatory.
The prologe of the auctor.
IT happened so but late that for diverse besynes and other affairs concerning
my self I took a vyage out of this realm and passyd over this narow Occyan
see, and traueylyd in to diverse far countries in the eest parties / and at
the last as it was my chance I came into a great city / where I made mine
abode and there tarried by the space of. xx. days or above / in which city
there uses contynually to resort a great company of marchauntys / which be
borne in sondrye and diverse nacyons / which be not only Englyshmen /
Frenchmen / Spanyardes / Almaynes / and other diverse (...) / but also they yt
be Turks and Saracie^s / and other that be of Machametys law. And because of
interchaungynge of marchaundyses / y^ said marchauntys do daily mete together in
diverse placys within the same city / and when they have talked together of
thing concerning their own besynes / yet for a recreacyon among them self /
they be desirous each of other to know news and strange things of other
contrees. And as it happened to me on a season to be in the company of diverse
of those marchauntys / among them all special there were. ii. of the^ / of
the which one was a turk called Gyngemyn borne under Machometys law / and y^
other was a Christenman called Comyngo / borne in hye (...) / which were of
old famylyer accoyntau^ce / and both of them men of great wit and of good
learning / and specially y^ turk / which was well lern^d both in moral
phylosophye and natural / betw^ne whom I herd myth good communycacion /
argumentys and rea sons / which lyked me very well / and so well pleased me that
immedyatly after that I took pen and ^nke and tytled it in writing / and
reported every argument and reason as nygh as my wit and remembrance would
serve me / after the manner as here after follows in this little book. And in
the beg^nnynge of their said co^munycacyon Comyngo the Almayn asked of Gy^gemyn
the Turk / what tythynges or news were in his country / which Gyngemyn showed
him of the great (...) which y^ great Turk had lately had in diverse places / as
well of the great sege of y^ Rodes / as of the great batayles / which he had
lately had in ^ungarye. But yet the said Gyngemyn was not so glad to tell the
tythyngys and news in and about his country / as he was desirous to know of
some strange news in other placis in Christendom. And often times required this
Comyngo to show him some new tythynges of his country. To y^ which Comyngo the
Al main answered and showed him that there was a new varyaunce in
Christendom and a s^ysme begone of late among the people there / co^ce^nyng
their faith and believe / and said that there was a new opinyon spronge among
the people / that there is no purgatory / nor that the soul of man after it is
separate from the body / shall never be purged nor puryfyed of no sin that
remains therein / but y^ it shall immedyatly after it is separate from the body
/ go to heaven to eternal joy and salvation / or else to hell to eternal
pain and dampnacyon. To whom Gyngemyn answered / and said that y^ opinion was
but folysh and agayns all good natural reason / because that all people in y^
world of what country so ever they have be or be / or of what law and sect so
ever they have be or be / as well the Panyms / the Jews / and you that be of
Christ's faith / and we that be of Machomets law / and all other that ever
lived or do live after the order of any good reason / have ever byleued and do
believe that there is a purgatory / where man's souls shall be purged after
this mortal life. Therefore quod he I meruell greatly that there should any
such fond opinyon begin among the people now in any country / considering
y^ there is no reason to maynteyne their opinion that ever I could here.

The reasons of them that hold opynyo^ that there is no purgatory. To whom
Comyngo y^ Almayne answered and said that they had diverse reasons to maynteyne
their opinion theri^ / whereof one is this. They say y^ contrycyo^ which some
call repentance / is that which is the very payment and satysfaccyon for
sin / and they say that when a man commyttyth a sin / and after is
repentaunte therefore / that god of his goodness does forgive him / and that y^
repentance is the only satysfaccyon that god would have to be made and done
for that sin. And than sith that a man which is a sinner / by such
repentance has made such payment and satysfaccyon for his sin as god would
have to be made therefore / if than that man should go to purgatory / and have a
new punyshme^t after his death / that repentance that he had before should be
but void.

A another reason / they alege that man was ordained and made to have an
infynyte being / therefore after this mortal death he must have infynyte joy
or infynyte pain. So tha^ he is not ordained to have pain in purgatory that
has an end.

A another reason they alege and that is this. God by the order of his justice
has ordained heaven / where that good men shall be rewarded / and hell where
sinners shall be punysshed / and in both those places orders and degrees /
that is to say / that he which deserves a great and an hye reward shall have
in heaven a great joy / and he that deserves a smaller reward / shall have a
smaller joy / and also he that deserves a great punishment / shall have in
hell great pain / and he that deserves a less punishment / shall have in
hell less pain. So that whether a man have deseruyd a great joy or a small
joy / a great pain or a small pain god may by his order of good justice
reward or punysh him according to his deseruynge so that there needs no place
of purgatory.

A another reason they alege / that though a man be not clearly purged of his
^ynne when he dies / and though some spot and toke^ thereof remain in his
soul whereby he is some what deformed / yet yt soul may do some mean and low
service or pleasure to god in heaven / though it be not the highest and best
service / nor though it have not the greatest ^oye in heaven / yet it may have
some small joy / and be in some low place in heaven / and there have a ^oyous
life / wherewith it will be right well content / and so rewa^ d^d according to
his desert / though it be not purged and made so clean as other souls that be
there / and so nedeles to ordeyn for that soul any other place of purgatory.

A another reason they alege / y^ god has ordained heaven to be a place of (...)
^oy / and hell to be a place of infinyte pain / and yerth where we be to be a
place myxte / sometime of ^oy / sometime of pain / which never endures but for
a time / y^ shall have end. And than sith that the soul offends being here
with the body / it is conuenyent it should be purged here with y^ body. And
because y^ god has ordained this place in yerth to be a place (...) of ^oy and
pain y^ shall have end / it is most co^uenyc^t y^ the place of purgatory
should be here in yerth / because it is y^ place ordained for pain that shall
have an end / and ^o needs to put none other place of purgatory / and if
the^e be any other place / where is y^ place of purgatory.

A another they alege / that bycau^e the mercy of god ca^ not be without his (...)
and rem^ssyon is ever incydent to repentance / therefore as soon as repentance
is taken god of his justice must give remyssyon / and therefore (...)
repentance and remyssyon there ought to be no purgatory.

A another ob^eccyon they alege / that if thou do an offense to god and to thy
neighbor / when god forgyueth it need none other satysfaccyo^ to thy neighbor
because god is the very owner of all / and thy neighbor has no properte / but
as a servant to god / as but to make accou^pte to god

To whom this Gyngemyn the turk anon answered and sa^d / that as for all
those reasons they may be sone answered and avoided / and if thou wylt give to
me dylygent heryng / I shall give the suffycyent soluc^ons to al those reasons
and satysfye thy mind. And further I shall prove to ye by other arguments and
by natural reason and good phylosophye / y^ there must nedys be a purgatory /
where y^ soul of man after y^ it is separat from the body / shall be purged and
puryfyed. To whom this Comyngo said / yt he would be marvelous glad to here his
mind therein. To whom this Gyngem^n than said / yt he must immedyatly go in to
the street to speak with a merchant / to ask of him but one short question
touching y^ besynes of his marchau^dyse / and said that he would return again
incontyne^t / which as he said / he did / and tarried not long but shortly
camagayn. And as soon as ever they were mete there again / they began their
co^munycacio^ / and Co myngo y^ (...) began first to speak / and said as
hereafter now follows.

finis prologi.
The first d'aloge of the merueylous existens of god.
An introduccyon to the matter. Caput primum.
COmyngo the almayne. Now my frynde Gyngem^n becaw^e thou say dest cre while
that thou would prove to me by natural reason and good phi loso^hye / that
there is a purgatory: where the soul of man after that yt is separate from
the body shall be (...) and puryfred: I pray the let me know thine opinion
therein / and let me here what reasons thou can alege therefore.


Gyngemin the turk I shall prove the that or thou go if thou will abide the
argument thereof / and pacyently with good delyberacyon here me. Comyngo. I
shall be content to give dylygent herynge thereto / but yet I pray the then to
suffer me to answer the and to obiecte and to replye against the / when that I
think in mine opinion that thy arguments and reasons be not suffycyent to
satysfye my mind.


Gyngemyn. Therwyth I am well content / and thy request is reasonable. For with
reasons and arguments made pro et contra / and on both parties answered /
replied / and objected / the truth of every proposycyon shlal sooner and better
be known: but yet one thing I will warn the / considering that my only
purpose is to prove the thing by reason / that in thy reasons and obieccyons
against me / that thou aledge no manner text nor authoryte / neither of the
bokys of the old bible / nor of the new testament: neither of no other book /
of that that thou calleste the holy scripture of the deuynrte of thy crrsten
faith / nor of the laws made therefore: which thou by thy faith art bound
to belyue. For thou may well know / yt will be but a thing in vain to
aledge such textrs or authorrtees to me / for that that I and all other turkys
of our laws and sect will utterly deny many of the prynciples and many of
the text^s and authorrtees of thy christian believe and farth.


Comyngo. Because thou (...) so I shall not trouble the with aledgynge of any
such textrs or authorrtees of our faith or law. And there fore I pray the
likewise ^se the same manner unto me / nor aledge thou no text nor authorytees
of the book of thy law called the Alcoron / nor of any other book of thy
Machomett^s law / for if thou do / I will be as ready to deny those textes and
authorytees of thy faith and law / as thou will be ready to deny those
textes and authorytees of my believe and faith.


Gyngemyn. It is but ^eash thou should so do therefore let us now both ley
all textys and authorytees of either of our beleuys and lawys appart: and se
how we can prove by reason and good natural phi losophy that there is a
purgatory / where that mennys sowles should be purged and puryfyed.


Comyngo. But I think yt will be hard for the to prove yt. Therefore I pray
the begin and let me here thy reason.


Gyngemyn. with right good will / but yet then first or that I proceed to that
matter concerning purgatory / thou must first grant me two pryncyples or
conclusyons. One is that there is a god above all / which rules and governs
all / and conserueth and kepepyth all / and regards and takes head to all. A
another is that the soul of man is immortal / and shall never dye / but has
a life perpetual.


Common. As to those two poyntys I must nedys grant the.


Gyngemyn. what moves the to grant them so sone.


Comyngo. Mary because y^ our holy scripture shows yt and techeth us so. And
also all our laws byndeth us and co^pellyth us to belyue it.


Gyng. ye but yet lay all the scry pture and laws apart and tell me what
thynkest thou by those two point in natural reason.


Comyngo. By my troth I think that no man only by reason can prove that
there is a god that governs all / conserueth all / and takes head to all /
nor that that the soul of man is immortal and does never dye.


Gyngemyn. yes I shall prove to the both those poyntys by reason / so that
thine only reason shall judge them to be true / if thou wylt d^scretly scretly
consider yt and search yt profoundly and put and give thy reason thereto
delyberatly to dyscusse yt.


Common. By what reason can thou first prove that there is a god that
governs all.


Gyng. Hark and I shall show the.


That god was without beginning and the first cawse of all thing. Cap. ii.
Hyrst I trust thou wylt grant me that there was evermore a thing or nothing /
somewhat or no what / being or not being.

Common. As to yt I must nedys grant / that there was ever a thing or no thing
as the laten men call it / res vel nihil / somewhat or no what which they call
aliquid vel non aliquid / being or not being / which they call esse vel non
esse / for as the philosopher says omnium oppositoru^ alteru^ est vetu^ / of
two things opposyte or contradyctoryes evermore the one must nedys be true.


Gynge. Then thus / every thing is somewhat / and every thing that is somewhat
is being / so that a thing / somewhat / and being / signifye one sense / and
also their contraryes / nothing / no what / and not being / do sygnyfye all
one sense.


Comyngo. That is true.


Gy^gemyn. Then furthermore whether was there a thing before nothing / or
nothing before a thing.


Comyngo. Mary a thing must nedis be before nothing / or else the world nor
nothing therein now cowde be / for of nothing nothing can proceed nor come.


Gyngemyn. There in thou sayste truth for one contrary can never bring forth
his contra ry / for if that onys nothing was being then of that nothing can
never come a thing or being / for of nothing naught can be made / therefore
yt follows well that there was evermore a thing being. And tha^ that thing
which was ever before all other things must nedys be without beginning for
every thing that is made or create had a cause of his beginning / ergo then
yt must follow that that thing which was first of all made / must nedys
have a maker / which was unmade for if any thing were before that thing
which thou call the first maker / then that which thou call the first
maker / can not be called the first maker and the first cause of all / because
yt has a another maker or a another cawse before yt / so yt must nedys follow
that there is one thing which was the first maker and first cawse of all
things / which has no maker nor no cause there / ofout of who^ as of the
very founteyne of all cawsys every thing is deryued / and takes his being /
so that thing which was first being / must nedys be the cause and foundacyon
of all thing / b of all being / and that first cause or first maker can have no
beginning but was ever without beginning / which first cause and first
thing among all people is called god / and that first cause is most worthy to
be called god.


Comyngo. That conclusyon follows so re sonably that yt can not be denied.


That god is and shall be without end. Capitulum. iii.
Gyngemyn. Then sith that god is the first cawse of every thing / and the
first and pryncypall cause of the being of every thing / yt requires that
there be in him such a being so perf^te / that every thing not god / have a
another being which must lack somewhat of the perfec cion of his being / so
that his being must be the most perfyte most substa^ cyall beonge / and the
most sure being that is or can by.


Comyngo what than.


Gyngemyn. Than further that thing has the most perfyte being / the most
substancyall being and the most sure being / which shall never have end /
for if yt shall have an end / it is not most perfyte / most substauncyall and
most sure being / but yt must be such a being which excludyth every
unperfeccyon that so wnyth or tendyth to not being / for perfyte being /
substauncyall being and sure being / be all contraryaunt to not being / so
that the one is repugnaunt to the other / and denies the other clearly. And
therefore it must then nedy^ follow y^. god which is the most perfyte being /
most substauncyall and most sure being / must have a being that never shall
have end. So there is no time paste in which he was not / nor no time present
in which he is not / nor no time to come in which he shall not be: so of
necessyte yt to loweth that his being was ever without beginning / and is and
shall be ever without end.


Comyngo. I must nedys affirm the same.


That god is most of power and the most noble thing that can be. Cap. iiii.
Gyngemyn. Then forthermore sithe that god is without beginning or end and
the cawse of every thing that is which has taken takes or shall take any
affecte / as I prouyd the before / and the cause is ever the more strong than
the effect. And also the cawse is ever that / which has power to make the
effect to be / therefore sith that god causes all / therefore it must nedys
follow that god has power to do all / and because he may do all / therefore
conuenyently god is called omnipotent / and is most of power and might: and by
the same reason also I may prove the nobylyte of god / for the cause is always
more noble than y^ effect / and noblenes is that which has lest need of
foreyne help / that is to say of help of any other thing / and than sithe
god is the cause of all thing / and every other thing takes his effect by
god / and comes and proceeds of god as of his first cause / and the cause as
I said before is more noble tha^ the effect / and every thing that takes any
effect / has need of the caw^e / for that that without the cawse the effect
coud never have been / but the cawse has never no need of the effect / for
the cawse may be without the effect / but the effect can not be without that
cause: Therefore sithe that god is the first cause of all thing / yt must
follow that every thing has need of god / and that god has need of nothing /
and than sith that noblenes is that which has no need of foreyne help / or
help of any other thing / yt must of a necessary conclusyon follow that god is
the most noble thing that can be.


Comyngo. I agree.


That god is the very life / and that he has the most joyful and pleasant
life that can be. Cap. v.
Gyngemyn. Than moreover sithe that I have prouyd to the here^ before that
being and not being be two contraryauntys and that being must nedys be
before not being: so likewise life and not life be two contraryauntys / and yt
requires that life proceed and go before not life / for that thing which
has no life / can not be the only cause that that thing which has life.
For that thing which has no life nor never had life / may not by his only
power make a thing to have life.


Common. All that is reasonable.


Gynge. But we see many things in the world / which have life as man and
be / ergo that life which is in those creatures / is deryuyed and proceeds
and cam^ first of that creator which is the very life / and in whom first
must nedys be life. For as a founteyne / which is the very ground and cause
of all the tyuets and brokys of water / which come from that founteyne / of it
self must nedis be the very water / so god which is ground and cause of all
life / must need be ofhym self the very life. And than sith that god is first
creator and causer of every thing which has life / it follows than that in
him there was ^uer a very life / and that he is founteyne of all life and that
no life can be so very and parfyte a life as his life / because he is the first
ground and cause of all l^fe. yet forthermore sithe that god is the very life
and the ground of all / and cause of every thing that has life / than that
life and living which god has / must be a pleasant and joyful life / or
else a paynfull and sorrowful life. But if it should be a paynfull and a
sorrowful life / than it could not be a parfyte and sure life / but sith thou
have grauntyd to me here before that god has y^ most parfyte and ^urest
being that can be / and that which shall never have end / and sithe that
pain and sorrow is that / which causes the thing to perysh which suf^eryth
yt pain and sorrow / because it is contra ry to the nature and desire of the
thing which so suffers. And case and pleasure does co^^orte the nature of
that thing which suffers that ease and pleasure / and incr^aseth it / and
causes it the longer to contynewe. So if that the b^ynge and living of god
should be a life and being in pain and sorrow / that paynfull and sorrowful life
/ should be the cause that his being should not be parfyte / but should perysh
at the last / and so not to have an eternal and an infynyte being. But than
sith his being is most parfyte eternal / and never shall have end / it must
nedys follow that his life must nedys be a joyful and pleasant life / and the
most ^oyfull and most pleasant life that can be.


Comyngo. All that is conuenyent to grant.


That god has knowledge and understanding / and knows every thing that ever
was / is / or shall be Caput. vi.
Gyngemyn. Than by the same reason that pueth him to be y^ very life / I may
well prove his knowledge and understanding: for that thing which has no
knowledge nor understanding / can not be only cause of that thing / which
has knowledge and understanding And also as I said to the erewhyle / because
the being of god / is y^ first being and the cause of the being of every thing
/ and the most parfyte / most substauncyall / and most sure being / It must
than follow that he must have the most noble and most worthy byenge that can
be imagyned or thought to be / and than that thing which has being and life
also / is more worthy and more noble / than that thing which has but being
only / as the tree and herb / which have a quycknes of a life whereby they
grow and increase / have a more noble and worthy being / than a deed stok or a
deed stone which grow not. And as the brute be which has a life sensytyue
and power to move it self / and memory / has a more noble and a more worthy
being / than the tree or the herb / which has but quyckenynge and growing
without power to move or memory. And also as the being of man / which has both
life sensytyue power to move memory / and understanding / has a more noble
and a more worthy be yng / than the brute be / which has but life
sensytyue power to move and memory without understanding. So it must nedys
follow that understanding is the cause of the most noble and most worthy
being / and than sithe that god has the most noble being and most worthy
being that can be / it must nedis follow that in god there must be knowledge and
understanding / and that the same being of god must be with the same knowledge
and understanding. And than if the being of god / as I have prouyd to the
here before / be without beginning and ending / eterne / infyn^te and without
measure / his understanding must nedys be without beginning and ending /
eterne and infynyte without mesure. And also sith his being is / and has be
ever most perfyte / and as he him self may be him self / so may he him self
understand him self / so his being can not be seueryd from his knowledge and
understanding / nor his knowledge and understanding seueryd from his being. So
must it than follow / that he understands all and knows every thing that
was / is / or / shall be / and every ma^nys thought / and every act done in the
world or that shall be done in the world / so that every thing is present to
his knowledge.


Comyngo. That conclusyon pleases me well.


That god is the hye good thing and most perfyte goodness and the very truth.
Caput. vii.
Gyngemyn. Than further as being and not being be two contra ryauntys and
repugnauntes / and some call them contradyctoryes that is to say / that the one
always does deny and with say the other / and as life and not life be two
contraryauntes / and where such two co^ traryauntes be / every thing in the
world is verefyed upon one of them / and nothing in the world can be
verefyed upon them both / for every thing in the world is god or not god /
and every thing is a man or not a man / and every thing in the world that is
/ has life or no life. So I say that good and not good / which we call evil /
be two contrary auntes. Than it must nedys follow y^ sith god is being / that
god must nedys be either a good thing or an evil thing. But if god should be
of him self a^ evil thing / than there could no goodness proceed nor come
of god / for one contrary of it self only / can not bring forth his
contrary. But we see that there be many good things / which come from god and
be of the creacyon of god / and also every good thing takes his goodness of
god / for yt god is the first cause of every good thing. Therefore god of whom
every good thing comes / and of whom all goodness proceeds / must nedys be
him self the hye good thing / and the very and most hye goodness / and that
in no wise god may be evil,


Comyngo. As for that no reasonable man may deny,


That virtue is evermore in god. Caput. viij.
Gyngemyn. Than likewise as good and evil be two contraryauntys / so truth
and falshed be two contraryauntys: therefore god must than be either truth or
falshed / but falshed is of the kind of evil / and truth is of the kind of
goodness / and than sith god is the very goodness and the hye good thing him
self / and falshed is of y^ kind of evil / it must nedys follow that god in
no wise may be false / but that he him self must be the very truth. And than
sith I have proved unto the that god is a being and a thing without
beginning or endyng / and the most perfyte thing / the most substauncyal
thing / and most sure thing / the very truth and the best thing / god must
have in himself the best propertees that can be.


Comyngo. I grant well.


Gyngemyn. Than I pray the answer me to this / is not virtue the best
properte that can be in god.


Comyngo. If I should answer the thereto / we must first agree what thing virtue
is.


Gyngemyn. I think that virtue is nothing else / but the dysposycyon of the
mind well orderyd / so yt virtue rests ever in ye mind / as when the mind
does consent and agree to goodness. And I think that all clerks will agree to y^
same.


Common. And I think the same / and that virtue is nothing else but a good
mind: for always when the mind consentyth to goodness / than there is virtue /
whether it be in god or in his creatures / and this consent to goodness is
evermore in god.


Gyngemyn. Tha^ sith the mind and will of god does evermore consent to goodness
/ it follows well that virtue must evermore be in god.


Comyngo. I must nedys affirm the same.


That justice must be evermore in god, and god is ever ryghteous and just.
Caput. ix.
Gyngemyn. Then furthermore whyther is justice belonging and incydent to
virtue or no.


Comyngo. It must nedys be so / for all clerks have dyffynyd, that justice is
a constant and a perpetual will gyuyng to every thing his own, and therefore
me thinks it must nedys follow, that justice must nedys be a good thing and
an hye excellent virtue. Thou say truth, and by that hye excellent virtue of
justice god does rule and govern all, and that same self justice is the
constant well of god, whereby he governs all the world and every thing
therein, in a conuenyent and reasonable order, and so it must follow that god is
ever ryghteous and just


That god is ever merciful. Caput. x.
BUt now forther I will demand of the whyther mercy be a good properte and
incydent to virtue or no.

Common. Than let us first like as I said, before agree between us, what we
call mercy.


Gyn. I think that mercy is nothing else, but a loving mind of a pytefull
affecte. And sith that mercy is incydent to virtue / than it must be ever in
god, so yt always god by his justice does give punishment and reward to
every one as he does deserve, so by his mercy he does remytte punishment, and
inlargeth the reward.


Comyngo. That conclusyon is both proper and reasonable.


That the justice and mercy of god be correspondent and yt the one can not be
without the other. Caput. xi.
Gyngemyn. Than forther sith yt justice and mercy be both incydent and always
belonging to virtue, it follows of necessyte yt justice and mercy must always
be in god, and yt his justice can not be without his mercy / nor his mercy
without justice. And than it must need follow yt god does never punysh no
creature by his justice, but that by his mercy his punysh meant must be less
than he does deserve: and also that god does reward no creature by his justice
/ but that by his mercy which is a loving pytefull mind / he does give him a
greater reward tha^ he does deserve. For by his justice he gives punyshme^t
co^digne and dew / and by his mercy he remyt teth again part of the
punishment, and also by his justice he gives re ward co^digne and dew / and
by his mercy and goodness he inlargeth and gives more reward thereto. So it
follows for a necessary co^clusyo^ / yt the iusty ce of god and thy mercy of
god / be ever correspondent and correlatyue / and yt the one can not be without
the other / and that god is ever just and merciful.


Common. By my troth this is a merueylous goodly conclusyon.


That god does govern all / and conserueth all / and does take heed to all.
Cap. xii.
Gyngemyn. Than now to the purpose that I spoke of in the begin nynge / Sith
that god is infynyte and sees and knows all / and is him self the hye good
thing and the excellent goodness / and vsyth ever his justice and mercy which
be ever correspo^dent to gyther / yt must nedys follow that he by his justice
and mercy does rule all and govern all / and co^serueth and keeps all the
world and every thing therein.


Co. Thou haste driven that conclusyon upon so many reasonable pryncyples that
I can not deny it.


Gyngemyn. Than yet forther I must ask of the an other questyon / is not love
a thing and properte belongyng to virtue.


Common. yes mary it must nedys be so / for in y^ love of god and thy neighbor
for gods sake restyth all virtue.


Gynge. why than yt must nedys follow that love must be evermore in god and
that god does love the world / or else he would not by his prouydence govern
it and conserve it as he does / and than he can not govern yt and conserve yt
/ except he regard yt and take heed to yt and to every thing contained in the
world / and to every act and deed which is done in the world.


Comyngo. All that I grant well.


Gyngemyn. Than sith that he regards and takes head to the world / and to
every one of his creatures / he will of a congruens most specially take heed
to his creatures here in yerth / which be most worthy and noble / but man is
most worthy and noble of all his creatures in yerth / because he is most like
unto god.


Common. why is man more like to god than any other creature in yerth.


Gyngemyn. Because that man has both knowledge and un derstandynge as god has
/ and so has no another creature in yerth / and therefore of co^uenyence yt must
than nedys follow that god does regard and take heed to man and to the actys
and dedys of men. And than yt must forther follow that he must punysh and
reward every act and deed done by man after his deseruynge according to his
justice and mercy.


Common. All reason will agree to the same.


That god is every where / and always in every place of the world. Cap. xiii.
Gyngemyn. Than yet forther as touching the marvelous exystens of god / thou
remembrest I she wed the ere while that every thing in the world is present to
sight and knowledge of god. And than he must nedys know every thing / and
every man's thought and will / an^ as I said to the before becawse his
knowledge an^ understanding extends so large that he knows every thing /
every where and in every place and because his knowledge can not be seueryd from
his being nor his being from his knowledge / yt follows well that he must be
every where and in every place.


Comyngo. That conclusyon will be marvelous hard to prove.


Gyngemyn. yes that conclusyon I can prove the by an other reason and argument.


Comyngo. I pray the how.


Gynge. Thou know well I showed and proved to the erewhyle / that god is the
first cause of all thing and all being. And that there is no other first nor
pryncypall cause of the being of the world but only god: and that god is the
only cause thereof / and there is none other medyat cause thereof but only god.
Than thus as the philosopher says and where the cause ceasyth the effect
ceasyth. As thus if there be one cause of the being of a thing / if that cause
be taken away and be absent from the thing / than that thing can no longer
have being / nor can no longer continue but must cease for to be / and
because god is the first and only cause of the world and of every part of
the world / and no other cause but only god / if god should be absent from the
world / or from any part of the world. The world from which he should be
so absent / or that part of the world / from which he should be so absent /
cowde not be nor no longer continue / but now becawse there can not be put
an example like thereto in all points / yet shall I put the a famyliare
example / that somewhat shall be resemble thereto: as the fire and the flame
thereof / for we se by experyence that the fire is the cause of the flame /
therefore if the fire be clearly taken away the flame can not be / nor no longer
continue. And where so ever the flame is there the fire must nedys be: and
where so ever any part of the flame is there the fire must nedys be: so I say
of god and the world / where so ever the world is there god must nedys be /
and where so ever any part of the world is / there must god nedys be /
therefore it must nedys follow that god is present every where / in the world
and in every part of the world / and no where absent / and therefore because
that god is the first cause of the world / and no another cause of the world
but only god / if god should be absent from the hole world and not present in
the hole world / his absence should cawse the hole world to perysh. And also
if god should be present every where and in every part of the world that part
of the world from whens he is absent and not present / cowde no longer remain
in his being / because as I said before / god is the first and only cause
of the hole world and of every part of the world / and if the cause should
sease / the effect should sease / wherefore as I said before yt must follow for
a necessary conclusion / that god is every where and always present in the
world / and in every part and place of the world.


Common. Now I thank the for that co^clusyo^ ple^seth me well / but yet there
is one dout therein / wherein I would move the and that is thus / if that god be
every where in the world / and in every place of the world / yt should some
to some mennys fantasyes / yt god of himself should be diverse things / or
else diverse of his partys should be in diverse placys. As one part of god to
occupye one place / and a another part of god to occupye a another place


G^nge. Nay not so yt must nedys follow by reason that god is but one thing
and not dyners things / and that there be no mo goddys but one. And also that
y^ same one god may be hole in diverse placys.


Common. I pray the by what reason may I know and understand that.


That god is but one thing / and not diverse things. Cap. xiiii.
Gyngemyn. As touching the first that god is one thing and that there be no mo
goddys but one / thus yt may be prouyd / unity must be before pluralyte / or
else pluralyte must be before unity / so that god must nedys be an unity or
else a pluralyte / and every pluralyte con systeth of two things which be
dyfferent in them self / and two diverse thyngys. But between every two diverse
things is some dyscorde and varyaunce / for where is no manner of dyscorde of
being there is but one thing / but if god were several things and not one
thing / then should there be ever in him a dyscorde and a varyaunce / and if he
had such a being that ever varyed in him self then had not he the noblest
being / and the ioyfullest being / but a being miserable and wretched /
therefore sith he has the noblest being and most joyful that can be / as I have
pro u^d to the before / yt must nedys follow that god is but one thing / and
not diverse.


That there is but one god. Caput. xv.
ANd also by y^ same reason it folowetth that there must needs be but one god
and not many / for if there were many goddis / other then those goddys agree
among the^ self in every thing and every act / or else they dysagre and
dyscorde in every thing and every act / or else thyrdely they agree in some
thyngys and dyscorde in some thyngys / but as to the first / if they agree in
every thing ynd every act / then be they not many but one god / as to the
second if they dyscorde in every thing and in every act / then should there
be no concord in all the world nor the world nor nothing else cowde never
have been nor continued / for y^ which the one should have conserved / the other
should have destroyed. As to the third point they agree in some things and in
some things dys agree / then in those things in which they dyscorde must be
between the^ varyaunce / then if they varye between them self / neither of
them can have the most noble and joyful being / but each of them a being
miserable And also if there be two gods / there must be of every thing two
first begynnynges / so neither of them should be by him self suffycyent. Also
in every kind of things that which is the highest of the same kind is but one
thing / for the multitude of all several men is reducyd in to one mankind /
the multitude of every several horse in to one kind of horsys / and so of
other / and the multitude of several kyndys in to one general beginning and
head of all kinds / so the universal order of things is referryd to one hole
and universal beginning. And likewise as every synguler matter is reserryd in
to one matter / every membre of y^ world in to one hole member and body / so all
several nature be referryd to one hole nature / all several lyfys to one life
/ all several mouers to one mouer / all several orders to one hye hole
ordener of al thing / so it must nedys follow that there is but one god and no
mo / which is the first cause / beginning / ruler and ordener of all thyngys
/ and is but one in him self.

That god is hole in diverse placys. Caput. xvi.
ALso as to the other point it is not inco^uenient y^ that same self one god
may be hole in diverse places / for thou see by experye^ce that the sown of a
thing or a voice or a word spoken may be hole hard in diverse placys / and of
diverse men atones and yet every man hereth the hole voice, sown, or word / and
yt rebou^dyth hole in every man's erys. Also thy soul and life of thy body is
hole in thy hole body / and hole in every part of thy body / or else if perte
of thy body (as thy hand or thy fot^) were cut away or destroyed perte of thy
soul were ^ynysshed and destroyed but of that thou see at thine eye the
contrary experyence / and so thou see well that thy hole soul and life is
hole in diverse placys / wherefore sith thou see well yt these things which be
but ye creatures of god / have such power of being yt they may be hole in
diverse placys / yt follows well that god that is creator and cause of all /
has such power and nobilite of being that he may be hole in diverse placys.

Common. Now that is one of the properyst conclusyons for my learning that ever
I hard.


Gyn. yet tarry a little while / and I shall show the a another conclusyo^
touching ye marvelous existens of god / which peradventure shall please the as
well as that.


Common. That I would be glad to here / therefore I pray the show me what yt is.


That god is eternal. Cap. xvii.
Gyngemyn By these foresaid co^clusio^s I shall now prove to y^ y^ god is
eternal.


Comyngo. Thou haste me thinks prouyd that to me substauncyally all ready /
for thou haste prouyd that god is infynyte without beginning or endyng / and
that I call eternal.


Gyngemyn. Nay now I see well thou perceyuest not the perfyte ground of this
thing.


Common. why what call thou eternal.


Gyn. For^othe Eternal / is ye very perfyte possession of all to gyther of
life intermynable / yt is to say without chau^gynge of time / but all thing yt
is in the world living in time / occupyeth time present / and proceeds from
time past un to time to come / for yt has lost the time of yester day / and
yet occupyeth not the time of to morrow. For no man lives in this life but in
this present mouable and transytorye moment. And every thing that lives and
is in this world / occupyeth atones but one little moment of time / so y^ joy
that any creature can have in this life is as no joy / For I trow thou wylt
grant that that joy / which thou had yesterday / which is now passyd / is
now to the no joy / and y^ joy which thou shall have to morrow not yet common
is yet to the no joy / for if the pleasure which thou had yesterday in
tastynge of delycate metes be now past / the^ have thou now no such pleasure
in tastynge / or if thy body shall have after this time an case and pleasure in
the avoiding of the pain which thou now ^du ryst / yet have thou no such
pleasure now / so all the being life pleasure and joy which any creature has
in this life / is but during one little moment which is short / and little
worthy to be called any perfyte being orlyfe / or any perfyte joy / but the
eterne existens of god which must excel all other beynges / has in yt self
such a nobylyte that yt comprehen death all the hole plente of life together /
and knytteth time paste and time to come with the time present. And nothing is
to god past nor to come but all things be to him present. For if any thing
were to him newly known / tha^ god had not all perfyte knowledge in him at the
beginning. And so than there should be in god some mutabylyte / and change and
aug mentacron of knowledge / and becawse he had eue^ most perfyte being / and
most perfyte knowledge / and his knowledge can not be separate from his being /
as I have proved to the before / it must nedys follow / yt god knew all thing
ever / and every thing was ever / is / and shall be to him present.


Common. This is now one of the meruel^st conclusyo^s yt ever I herd / but sith
I now perceive yt nothing is worthy to be called eterne but only god / what
shall I call those things / which have such an existence / in transytory
momentes that never shall have end nor fynysh.


Gyn. Certes if I should give them a condygne name I must call them perpetual
/ and the existence of god eternal / and sithe that god is present every where
/ and all thing is present unto him / and ye understanding of god is his very
being / yt must nedys follow that god understands sees and knows every
thing in the world / ever present before him / every man's thought / every
act that is past / and every thing that is pre sent / and every thing that is
to come / and knows what every creature has done / does and shall do / and
what every man does or thinks or shall think or do / so every thing that
ever was / is / or shall be / is now to him known / and is now present before
him.


Common. Now doutles that is one of the noblest conclusions that ever I hard
sith I was borne / and therefore I thank the with all my heart / and not only
for this / but also for all thy other reasons which thou haste made to me here
before / where by thou have so forcyd me that I must nedys by reason grant /
that there is a god which by his hye prouydence rules and governs all / and
co^ serves and keeps all / and regards and takes head to all the world /
and to every thing there in contained. But at the beginning of our co^
munvcacyon thou she wedest me that thou coudest prove to me by reason a another
conclusyon and pryncyple / that is to say / that the soul of man is im mortal
and shall never dye.


Gyng. That conclusyon I purpose and can prove to the with so good
demonstratyue reasons / that I dout not but I shall therein right well satysfye
thy mind / but yet now becawse I have a little besynes to do / I pray the
spare me for a little season. And within the space of an hour or little more /
I shall mete the here again and than we shall proceed in our argument.


Common. with right good will I am content / and I shall not fail by goddys
grace to be here again within this hour / and than dylygently to attend upon
thy return / and therefore I pray the fail not to keep thy promise.


Gyngemyn. I shall not fail to keep my promise by the help of the great god.
And therefore for a season now fare well.


Comyngo. And fare well again with all mine heart


Thus ends the first dyaloge / declarynge the marvelous exystens of god
The second dialoge of the immor talyte of man's soul.
That it is conuenyent and needful to prove the immortalyte of man's soul by
reason. Caput. i.
Gyngemyn. Now by my troth well met for I thought as much yt I should be sure to
find ye here at my retorn


Common. And I made ye more have because I would be here before the. For I would
be loathe yt thou should prove in me any brech of covenant or (...).


Gyn. Therein thou art ye more to be co^mendyd / and therefore no we let us go
to our matter that we did promise between us to dyspute / that is to say / to
prove by natural reason only that the soul of man is immortal and shall
never dye.


Comyngo. I wot well thou dydest say to me / that thou coudest prove it by
natural reason: but I had lever here tell of the other conclusyon that thou
spakest of / that is to say / yt there is a purgatory / where the soul of man
shall be punysshed after it it separate from the body / which is more co^uenye^t
and more need full to be prouyd / than to prove the immortalyte of man's
soul: for there is but few people but that they believe that the soul of man
is immortal.


Gyn. And I think it is both conuenyent and needful / to prove first the
immortalyte of man's soul / for as touching the first point / I can not so
co^uenye^tly prove to ye by reason yt there is a purgatory / nor so well to
satysfye thy mind therein / except I should first prove to the by reason that
the soul of man is immortal / for that yt other the same groundys and
pryncyples which serve for the first will conuenye^tly serve for the other / or
else they will be antecedentes necessary to prove the said conseque^s. And as
to the second point me thinks it is now very needful / and for a common
virtuous wealth to prove by reason that y^ soul of man should be immortal. For
this I merk meruelously which I se by a comen experyens used in the world /
and specially in my country / yt many which be called the great wise men of
the world / which have deep and hye learning and also excellent wit / do live
abomynably and vycyously / some in pomp and pride some so inordynate covetous
that be never sacyate / some in rancor malice and dysdeyn / and many of them do
never co^uerte from those vices / during their lives / another by exhortacyon /
prechyng / techyng / another by pain / punishment / sekenes / nor other thing /
except it be for a very little season only while the pain endures / I say
than if such wise men and great clerkys so well studied and lernyd / believed
perfytely and surely that their souls were immortal / and should have pain or
joy in an other world / according as they deserve here in yerth / I suppose
verily they would never contynew in their vycyous living as they do / wherefore
it is a great co^iecturall argument unto me that they believe not their souls
to be imortall. But that they labor and study to bring other to believe the
immortalyte of man's soul / because they would have them obedyent unto them
and thereby to maynteyne their own vices and voluptuous appetites.


Common. Nay god forbed it should be so / but I think rather it is the fraylte
of their nature / and that they do but forget to do their duties to god for y^
time / but yet if there be any such men as thou spekest of / which will never
be converted by exhortacyo^ / prechyng / sekenes / nor other punishment / me
thinks for the^ there is no remedy.


Gyng. yes forsooth this thing which I purpose now to show the perad uenture may
be a remedy and help therein. For there is nothing in the world shall alter
and change a man's mind and believe so well and surely / as shall the
judgment of his own reason / for when a man is set in the perfyte believe of
any thing / though the prayer and opinion of other ca^ not turn his mind /
yet when a another reason comes to his m^nd which destroys that first reason
/ which causyth him to believe his first opynio^ to be true / y^ same other
reason so come^ to his m^nde shall change his first believe and opinion.
Therefore I say for such men as believe not the immortalyte of man's soul / yt
is necessary to persuade them by reasons and arguments and such as they never
herd before / or else though they have before hard them / yet they did never
in their minds with delyberacyon depely dyscusse them. And such reasons so
moved unto them shall cause them to alter and change their beleues and
opynyons. And where they believed before that the soul of man was mortal / they
shall by y^ per suasyon of such reasons change their opynyons / and believe
that it is immortal / and that it shall never dye.


what is a dyffynycyon / and what is a descrypcyon. Caput. ii.
COmyngo. By my truth thou say well unto me and therefore I pray the now
show me some of those reasons / which thou thynkest necessary to prove the
immortalyte of man's soul / for the contentacyo^ of my mind therein.


Gynge. with a right good will. But yet if I should satysfye thy mind in this
matter by way of argument and reasonynge / we had need first to agree between us
in y^ words and terms yt we shall speak / so that I may mean the same thing
always yt thou doste mean / and that thou mean always / the same thing that I
mean. For if I speak a word / and by that word that I speak I do mean fire
/ and by the same self word thou do mean water we shall never tha^ agree in
our arguments and reasons / nor by our argument never bring forth / nor prove
no true nor good co^clusyon. Therefore if we should talk of y^ body and of the
soul / and of man / it is first necessary to agree between us / what thing we
call a body / and what thing we call a soul / and what thing we call a man.


Common. Thou sayste well therein / therefore first I pray the tell me thyn
opynyo^ theri / and what thing thou call a body / and what thing thou
call a soul / and what thing thou call a man.


Gyn. I call a body as all y^ phylosophres before have defyned yt.


Co. what meanest thou by this word defyned.


Gyn. Mary dyffinycio^ as the philosophers say is a rule which shows and
techyth us the being of the thing / and what the thing is / only by terms
and words essencyall. But a descryp^on is a rule / which she weth and techeth
us the being of the thing and what the thing is by wordesaccidentall / and
words essenciall be those which sygnyfye such an essencyall thing / which can
not be taken a way from y^ same self thing / which we would have diffynyd and yt
thing still to remayn. But accydentall thing be those / which may be taken a
way from y^ thing wych we would have descrybyd / and yet yt thing may still
remain / as white black / hard / soft / good / bad / and such other be terms
accydentall for a horse or a man / for whytnes or blacknes / hardness / or
softnes / goodness or badnes may be changed in a horse or man / and taken a way
from those things and yet the same self horse or man may remain still in
their substauncyall being / and therefore they be called accydentall things
for a horse or a man but those terms a body and sensyble / be terms essencyall
for a horse or a man / for they may not be taken away from the substance of a
horse or a man / and the same self horse or man to remain / and therefore they
be call lyd essencyall terms for a horse or a man.


what is a body / what is a soul / and what is a man. Caput. iii.
COmyngo. All yt I perceive well and am agreed with y^ therein / therefore I pray
the proceed and tell me what thou call a body / and what thing thou call
a soul / and what thou call a man.


Gyng. I call that a body as I said before as the philosophers have dyffyned yt
/ that is thus: A body is that which has length / bread / and thickenes. And a
soul as y^ philosophers say / is ye act of a natural body having life in
power And a man is a body with a soul sensytyf and reasonable. But yet me
thinks there is a better dyffynycyon / than that for the soul after mine
opinyon.


Common. what is that?


Gyn. Surely after mine mind a soul is no another thing but a lyfely power /
and ought not always to be called the act of the natural body having life /
for I think that thou wylt grant that the soul of man / when it is separate
from his corruptyble body is a soul / and yet it is not than the act of the
body / for tha^ it does nothing with the body / nor that body does no act /
nor has no natural doing by reason of the soul / and therefore it seems it
is no good dyf fynycion of the soul to call it the act of the body / but the
best dyffynycyon of the soul is to call it the lyfely power.


Common. if that be thyn opynion / than thou go clean from the dyffynicyon of
the phylolophers and than I suppose that few clerkys therein will take thy part.


Gyng. Nay it is not clear again the philosophers mind / for peradventure
when they gave that dyffymcyon they meant that the soul being joined with the
body / is y^ act of the body.


Common. well than go forth with thy purpose.


Gyng. Then furthermore I say that of that soul there is three dye^rsytees /
that is to say / a soul vegetatyf / a soul sensytyf / and a soul
int^llectyf. A soul vegetatyue is that life that is in a plant / tree gras /
herb / or fruit which do grow. A soul sensytyue is that life which is in a
brute best / which occupyeth and uses the. v. wyttys and lacks reason and
understanding / as is a horse / a cow / a bird or a fysh. And y^ v. w^ttys by
the tastynge / the smelling / the herynge / the sight and the touching. And
therefore every kind of bestes having these. v. wyttys have a soul sensytyue.
But a soul intellectyue is that which has a live l^ understanding to know
good from ^ll / and right from wrong. And therefore a man is that creature to
whom god has given this soul int^f / which we call the reasonable soul. And
because man has growyng as plants and herbs have / he is therefore called
lyfelv / and because he has the use of the. v. senses as brute bestes have /
therefore he is called ^nsyble. And because he has reason and understanding /
therefore he is called reasonable. Therefore a man is nothing else but a lyfely
body sen sybl^ and reasonable / so those two things joined together that is to
say the body and the reasonable soul do make a man.


Common. This is a very good introduccyon to our matter and a reasonable /
therefore I am content to grant to the all these foresaid conclusyons /
therefore I pray the go forth with thy argument / and let me see how thou can
prove by rea son that the soul of man is immortal and shall never dye.


Gynge. That I trust I shall prove the / but yet first or we go to the
reasonyng ^rof (...) I shall prove to the y^ it is wysdom for a man to believe
that y^ soul of man is immortal / and shall never dye / and that it is great
folly to b^ue the contrary that it is immortal.


Comyngo. How can thou prove that.


Gyngemyn. Forsothe thus.


That it is wisdom to believe that the soul of man is immortal. Caput. iiii.
A Man must nedys other believe that the soul of man is immortal and shall
never dye / or else mortal and shall perysh with the body / but it is more
wisdom and profit for a man to believe that it shall never dye / then the
contrary. For in every doutfull thing the more surer way is to be chosen. But
if thou believe that it is immortal and shall never dye / though it be not so /
yet that believe by no possybylyte can never hurt the nor dysprofyte the / for
if it be immortal and shall have punishment after for his desert / that believe
may do the great good / if thou live the more virtuously. And if it be mortal
and shall dye / yet if thou believe y^ it is immortal / yt believe shall never
after thy death do the hurt / whyther thou live in this world virtuously or
vycyously / when thou have no life nor being after thy soul is departed from
thy body. But on the other side if thou believe that it is mortal and shall
dye with thy body / that be leave peradventure may do y^ great hurt. For if thy
soul live after thy body and be punysshed in an other world for thine offenses
done in this world / if the boldness of that believe have caused y^ to live the
more vycyously in this world / for which thou art in an other world
punysshed / then that believe that thy soul is mortal is cause to the of great
harm / therefore to believe that y^ soul of man shall dye with the body one way
may be cause to man afterward of great hurt. But of this believe that the soul
of man shall never dye / shall never by no possibylite be hurtful to man
afterward nor there can not folo we thereof to man any harm / wherefore I may
well conclude y^ a man to believe that his soul is incorruptyble and shall
never dye / is great wisdom / and to believe the contary is great folyshnes.

Co. That reason prouyth it more wisdom to believe y^ immortalyte of the soul
/ but yet that reason prouyth not the soul to be immortal.


if the soul of man should not be immortal / than were man the most
vnhappyest of all other crea tures and bestys. Caput. v.
Gyngemyn. But yet if thou wylt give me dilygent heryng / I trust I shall prove
the by reason that the soul of man is immortal / and that it is infynite and
shall never dye nor utterly perysh / and that I shall prove y^ by diverse
reasons.


Comyngo. I pray the by what reasons.


Gyngemyn. Dowtles by many good reasons / wherefore my first reason is this.
There is no creature of god in yerth which does to god so myche honor nor
prayseth god so myche as man does / nor also there is no creature in yerth
that has any knowledge and reason to know / how to do honor to god save
only man / than sith that man is only that crea ture / which does honor to
god here in yerth / it is conuenyent and stan death most with equity and
ryghtfull judgment and goodness of god / that god should therefore reward man
with a life and a being more plea saunt and better / than any other creature
or best here in yerth. But the life and being which man has here in yerth /
is more wreched sorrowful and worse / than the life of any other brute best
here in yerthe / ergo it is conuenyent and necessary that man have an other
life after the corrupcyon of his body / and that must nedys be the life and
being of his reasonable soul / because his body after his mortal death has
by nature no manner of life.


Common. why is the life of man here in yerthe more wreched sorrowful and worse
tha^ the life of any other brute best.


Gyn. That I shall she we the / for thou know well enough and see by
experyence that the body of man is more feeble and tender / than the body of
any other brute best / for the body of man is all tender and naked and myche
more tender than any other brute best / for y^ fysshes have of their nature
shell^ or skalys to cover and defend their bodies / the best^ be full of here
and have thycke skynnes / the fowls have feathers: but man is tender and naked
/ yt if he had not covering for him made of other best skin or here or other
things / he should perysh for cold / for which thing to be gotten man must
labor and study / where the bestes fysh or foul need not to labor for y^
obteynynge thereof / because they have all such thing needful for the^ given
them by nature / so that the life of man is more ne defull and wreched / than
the life of any other brute best. Also man takes and must take great labor
for the obteynynge of his necessary fode and living as to till the ground with
great labor to get him drynk and fode. where the bestes take no such pain for
drink nor other fode / but find always the water ready for their drink / and
all other thing ordained by nature ready for their fode without any study or
labor therefore to be taken. So the life of man is more laborous and paynfull
/ than y^ life of any other brute best. Also man idureth much vexacyo^ /
thought / study and unquietness of mind / which the brute bestes endure not /
for though yt man knows surely that he shall dye and often takes thought
therefore / yet the brute bestys have no knowledge of their death / nor take no
thought therefore. And also man does take thought and care for loss of riches
loss of honor or dygny te / and many a man takes so great care for loss of
such riches and honor / that during his life therefore he can never be merry.
And some man takes so great thought and care therefore that often times he dies
for sorrow / me^ and women also desire and covet gay and fresh apparel to cover
their bodies / goodly garnysshed and fair houses / and all bewteous syghte
plea saunt to the eye / as goodly pyctures and images / they desire and delight
also in sweet smellys and savors / and to here songs and armony and sweet
sownes pleasant to the ere / and takes great pain labor and study /
vexacyon and unquietness of mind for the obteynyng of such things. But yet the
brut best cares for no such things / but regards nothing but only for his
fode / his bodily lust ease and pleasure. Therefore it proves well yt man
indureth much vexacio^ thought study and unquietness of mind which the brute
bestes endure not. Therefore as I said before / if y^ soul of man should not
have a another life and being after it is separate from the body / then were
man in worse case than any other brute best / which were not consonaunt to the
justice nor goodness of god / that man which of all creatures yerthly gives
only honor and praise to god / should be rewarded with a life more wreched and
wore than any other best in yerth. And therefore god of his justice and goodness
must reward him with a better life / than that which any brute best indureth
/ which can not be except yt his soul have a life and being / after it is
separate from this corruptyble body. So of conuenyence it follows that the
soul of man must nedys be immortal.


Comyngo. That is a right proper reason which thou have made / but have any
other reason than that?


Gynge. ye forsooth that I have / and therefore my second reason shall be this.


That the soul of man uses his operacyon and properte without the body / and
so may have a being without the body. Caput. vi.
THe very operacyon and properte of the reasonable soul is to know and to
understand / then if the gross body of man be the cawse of the being of the
soul / so that the soul take his perfeccion ano corrup cyon of the gross
body / then can the soul never use his operacyon and pro perte without the
body. But if the soul of man may use his operacyon and properte without
occupyenge of that gross body / than is not the body the cause of the
perfeccyon and corrupcyon of the soul / but y^ soul may use his operacyon
and properte without occupyenge of the gross body / for the less that the
body or the. v. wyttys is moved or styred / the better and the more perfytly
does the soul use his operacyon and properte. For when a man moves not with
the body nor sees nothing nor hereth no noise / nor tastes nor smells
nothing / that should trouble the body / than does the soul of man use his
operacyon and properte of understanding most clearly and perfytly. And also yt
has been often times hard and known / that diverse men in their dremys have seen
many vy syons / some in their dreme thynk them self / in their living bodies to
be in other placys talking with other folks / and doing diverse things to
their pleasure or dyspleasure: when in deed their bodies be not there / but
they lie in their beds still a sleep / and these things and vysyons / which
they se in their dremys is the operacyon of their souls / for their bodies so
lyenge a sleep do see nor do no such thing / and therefore sith the soul of
man does see and does such things without the body / it fo lo weth well that
the soul of man has a being without the body / and so may have his being
when it is seueryd and separate from the body.

Co. Me thinks that reason proves as well yt the soul of a brute best may
have his being when it is separate from the body of that best. For as I
suppose a dog or a hog or any other brute best does dreme as well as a man does
/ for a dog in his sleep will bark and open like as he does when he is waking
/ a hog and diverse other bestys will cry and make noise in their sleep like as
they do being wakyng.


Gyn. As to that I say in mine opinyon / that no brute best in y^ world does
dreme but only man nor all the world can not prove the contrary. And I say
that though a dog or other best does cry and make noise in his sleep / yet yt
dremeth not nor sees nothing. For this we see often by experyence yt many a man
in his sleep does speak and move / and yet he dremeth not / nor sees no thing
/ nor when he is waking can another tell nor remember that he dre med of any
thing / all the while that he so spoke in his sleep / nor saw no thing that
while: and so that sometime a man speaks and makes noise in his sleep / and
sees no thing nor dremeth not / and yet sometime he speth and makes mouynge
or noise in his sleep / and does dreme and see vysyons / but that speaking and
mouyng which a man has in his sleep / while he sees nothing nor his mind
occupied / comes only of the na turall dysposycyon and complexyon of the body
/ and it is only the opera cyon of the body / and not the operacyo^ of the
soul / because yt the mind is no thing occupied that while / nor ^yueth nor
sees no thing that while. For proof whereof if ye will suddenly pryck a man
being a sleep / he will move and styr / and ^aduiture make cry or make noise
or sown and yet dremeth not that while of no such hurt done to his body /
nor his soul saw no thing that while / and if he be suddenly wakyd therewith he
ca^ another tell nor show of no manner dreme nor vysyon in his sleep that he had
that while. which operacion of the natural dysposycyon and com plexyon of the
body every brute be may have in his sleep / and that natural dysposycion of
the body / does cause yt best to cry and move in his sleep as when it feleth
pain it will cry in token of that pain as it does when it is waking / and
when it felyth ease and pleasure / it will make noise or sown / or make some
mouynge / betokenynge the same ease and pleasure as yt does when it is waking.
But yet there is no brute best in the world which is able to make any noise
cry / or sown in his sleep other wise, yt it is able to do when it is waking
/ but when it is waking / it is not able to do any thing / touching only the
operacyon and properte of y^ reasonable soul / for yt can not reken nor count
no nombers nor dyscusse what is right and wrong / good nor bad / nor make no
arguments nor reasons / which operacyon and propertees of the reasonable
soul no brute best can have nor use in his sleep / because he can not have
them nor use them when he is wakyng / but a man has those propertees of the
soul / as well waking as slepynge. For waking he can reken and count no^
bers and reason and dyscusse what is right and wrong / good and bad / and
inuente and find many sutell reasons and arguments / which the brute best
can not do / a man can also use the same lyenge a sleep in his dremys / for
many man also being a sleep in his dreme / does find diverse reasons and
arguments proving some conclusyon of some scyens and faculte / which reason
came never to his mind before while he was wakig / also many a man in his dreme
has had diverse vysyons / and has forseen and had knowledge of things to come
/ which has afterward fallen plain ly and truly according to his vysyon /
some of promocyon and wynnyng / and sometime of loss and bodily hurt / which
after has fallen to him and many a man in his dreme has seen and known his
own destruccio^ and death. Thus the soul of man has his knowledge / and uses
his properte of understanding not occupyenge the body and without any help of
the body / or of any of his. v. senses / or of any organe of the senses / or
of any member of the body. And yet forthermore many a man we ses by experyence
being seek feeble and weke / and the soul nygh the point of departing from
the body / a little before the hour of his death has for seen and fortolde his
own death / and also the death of other folks and die uers other things /
which afterward have truly come to pass. And also broad wakyng has seen
many sightes and vysions of diverse strange things of spyryt or deuyls and of
diverse persons / which have been deed before / and showed them that were than
present / that those vysyons did give him perfyte knowledge that he must nedys
dye. which strange visy ons other persons being there present with him coud in
no wise see nor perceive / wherefore if the soul of man should dye and corrupt
with the bo die / it seems agayns reason that it should be so perfyte in his
being to use his operacyo^ and properte of knowledge and understanding so
quyckly truly and perfytly so nygh the time of his corrupcyon / but rather
when yt begins to dye and corrupt / yt should begin to wax weke and feeble
in using his operacyon and properte. wherefore upon these ^inissys I man well
conclude / that sith the soul of man vsyth his operacyon and properte most
perfytly without occupyenge of the body or help of the body / that the most
parfyte being of the soul is without the body / so the body can not be the
cause of the corrupcyon of the soul of man / but that the soul may be without
the body / nor that the soul dies not when the body dies / nor when it is
separate from the body / but lives and has his being after and is immortal
and incorruptyble.


Common. That reason is right good and apparaunt.


Gynge. Nay I pray the take pacyence for a while and here me dylygently / for
I have diverse other reasons to prove the ^ortalyte of man's soul.


Common. I pray the go to / I shall be glad to give the herynge.


That god does will the perpetual life wealth and preseruacyon of man's soul
/ and that his will must be performed. Cap. vii.
Gyngemyn. Another reason I shall show the which is this / because the children
be somewhat like unto the father / and also because y^ fa there knows that they
be of his nature / therefore the father must and does naturally love his
children / and ever wylleth the wealth and prosperyte of his children still to
contynew. So like wise because y^ man is like unto god for yt yt god has made
him to his symylytude / because he has know lege and understanding somewhat
resembling to god / which most high knowledge and understanding is ever in
god / as I have proved y^ here before in our first dyaloge and dysputacyon.
And also because the soul of man is of the nature of god / and proceeds and
comes only of god / it must than consequently follow that god does love the
soul of man / and does greatly will the perpetual wealth and preseruacyon of
the soul of man st^ll to contynew. And if god do will the perpetual wealth and
preseruacyo^ of that soul / that great will of god must (...) take effect /
for ^f god should have ever a great w^ll to a thing / and that thing should
never take (...) / than god should never have his will fulfilled / and tha^ tha^
that should be a great dyspleasure to god / and so than god should have a
dysple^ life and being / and no ^oyfull life nor being / which is contrary
to that which I prouyd to the before in our first dyaloge and dyspu tacyon that
god must nedys have the most joyful life and being that can be and therefore
sith that the great will of god is to have the soul of m^n in perpetual wealth
and preseruacyon / ^t must nedys follow that the (...) of man must have a
perpetual life / and must neoys be unmortall.


C^myn. That reason me thinks proves not thy purpose / for if ^od have a will
that man's soul should be perpetually preseruyd / and that of (...) to that
will of god must nedys take effect / or else god should have no ^full life
nor being / thereof should follow / that god should suffer no (...) soul to be
dampened.


Gyn. Nay that ob^eccyon may be well assoyl^d by the symylytude that I did
show the before of y^ father and children. For though a father having many
children / have a natu rall will to the wealth and perpetual preseruacyon of
all his children / yet if any one of his children do dysplease him / and have
^yll concyc^ons or does hurt or intend the dyspleasure and destruccio^ of his
father / that father than will for such unkindness punysh him / till he can
reconcyle him again to goodness / but if he will not be reconcyled / he will
than utterly cast him to perpetual pain or prysonment / and that is for the
great love and (...) / that such a father has do to justice. So like wise god
wh^che o^ his infynyte goodness and mercy / has a will to the wealth and
perpetual preseruacion of mannis soul / and also a good will ever to do
iusty^ has ordained man's soul to have perpetual joy / and also has
ordained punishment for every soul / that does offend according to his
desert. So that the will of god does ever take effect according to his mercy
and justice / sometime to reward by his goodness and mercy / and sometime to
punysh by his justice. And also because god is loving to man and is merciful
and just / god can not mynyster his justice suffycyent unto man except that
his soul should be immortal / and have a another life after it is separate from
the body.


Common. yet me thinks thou have not suff^ntly prouyd that conclusyon / that
god can not mynyster his justice unto man / except his soul should be
immortal.


Gyngemyn. yes that I trust I shall prove the inco^tynent by a good apparent
rea son / if thou wylt here it.


Comyngo. yes mary with all mine heart / there fore I pray the say on.


if the soul of man should not be immortal / than god does not mynyster to
every man equal justice. Caput. viii.
Gyngemyn. Every reasonable man will grant / that god which is the first
cause of every thing / and the fou^teyne of all goodness / that he must ener be
ryghteous and tuste / as I have proved to the in our first dyaloge / and by
his justice he must reward and punysh every man according to his desert. But
we se that there be diverse men / and have been diverse men in the world / which
have done diverse and many good ded^ with good mind / and taken great pain and
labor for the love of god / and also suffered pacyently many wrongys / hurtes
/ and rebukes for the love of god / and never had reward therefore in this
world. And sone after such pain and labor taken / and such good deeds done
by them / or such wrongs suffered for gods sake they have dyed / and never
reward in this world therefore. So on y^ other side diverse men offend god in
this world and do many evil deeds / and never punysshed suffycyently in this
world therefore. Therefore it is necessary that man have a living and a being
after this bodily death / that god may reward him and punysh him by his
justice / for those good deeds and evil deeds / that he did in this world /
for the which he was not fuffycyently rewarded no^ punysh while he was here.
For else god does not minister to him equal justice. And also a man to honor
god in this world / it were a thing but in vayn / if yt he should dye without
any reward while he were living here / nor never have therefore reward after
his death in no place else where. And also it should conforte a man to live
vycyously / and to satysfye his own voluptuous appetytes / and to the
satysfyenge always of his inordynate desire and pleasure and froward mind and
will / and to do vycyous and Abo^ynable dedys / to the destruccyon and hurt of
his neighbors / if he should trust to avoid all punishment therefore to be
had in this life / nor never think to have punishment therefore / nor make any
satysfacio^ after his death in no other place else where / therefore I say by
the conue meant justice of god / it is necessary that man must have an other
life and being after his soul is separate from his body where he may
receive dew reward or punishment for such acts / for the which he was not
suffi ciently rewarded nor punysched / while he was here living in earth / which
life and being must nedys be the life of his immortal soul.


The soul of man is made to be part taker of blysfulnes and joy that ever
shall endure. Caput. ix.
Gyngemin. Another reason to prove y^ immortalite of man's soul is this. The
soul of man which is made to the syimlitude and likeness of god / because of
the understanding / is made to perceive and to have and to be parttaker of
blysfulnes and joy / for if the reasonable soul / which is formed to the
lykenes of god / should not be made to attain blesfulnes and joy / then no
creature is made to attain and come to the blesfulnes and joy / the^ if it be
made to attain blesfulnes and joy / either than that blesfulnes and joy is for
ever to endure / or ell^ to endure for a season / but so to endure joy for a
season and to have an end thereof / is no blesfulnes but heaviness / for then
should the soul ever be sad and heavy / to think it should depart from that
joy / that it endures for that season / for like as we be sad of that sorrow
that comes to us against our will / so be we sad for that joy that goth from
us against our will / then if the soul should be sure to depart from that joy
that it has / it should have cause to morn and to be sad / therefore it
seems than that the soul is not made to (...) that joy and blesfulnes that
endures but for a season / which is no joy but wrechednes. But it is made to
perceive that very joy that endures ever. Therefore it may be concluded that
the soul of man is made to endure for ever and so must nedys be immortal.


That the soul of man knows and perceyu^th many things without the body /
nor it depends not nor corrupts not with the body. Cap. x.
Gyngemyn. Another reason is this: we perceive that to the body belongs. v.
wits / that is to say / the herynge / seeing / felyng / tast^ng / and
smelling / and the organs and instruments of the. v. wits b^n the ^res for
herynge / the eyes for seeing / the nose for smelling / the mouth with the
tongue for tastynge / and the other members for touching / but our soul we se
perceyueth knows and understands many thing that be not perceived known
nor understand by the body / nor by no part of the body / nor by none of
the. v. wits. For the soul without oc cupyeng any of the. v. wits
conceyueth things that have no bodies / for it knows the goodness of god / it
knows right and wrong / truth and falshede / the soul can reke^ and tell
nombers / it knows proporcyo^s / it perceyueth things paste and things to
come / all though they be insensyble by means of the body / or by the. v.
wits / and all those things yt have no bodies / can not be seen / hard / nor
smellyd / tasted / nor touched by none of the. v. wits / nor by no
instrumente nor organe of them / yet can the soul perceive all such
incorporall and insensyble things of his own kind and by him self / and
therefore it appears that y^ soul has his operacyon beside the body / and
that the nature of the soul of man is not of necessyte dependenge to the body
/ nor to the. v. wits / nor to no part of them / nor corrupts not / when
the body and the. v. wits been corrupt / but has his being without the body
/ and so is immortal.


That the natural appetyte of the soul of man is to come to the knowledge of
the hye cause / which is god. Caput. xi.
Gyngemyn. A another reason yet I shall show the / which is this. The soul of
man knows it self / yt knows every thing / the being of every thing / and
the cause of the being of every thing / it knows things fynyte and things
infynyte and the causes thereof / and so further and further / hyer and hyer /
and cause by cause / and never cesyth till it has atteyned the knowledge of the
first cause of all thing / which is god that is infynyte / and the nere yt
does atteyne the knowledge of that first cause the more vehemently it desires
to know that first cause tha^ is infynyte Therefore it appears that the soul
of man has ever a natural appetyte and properte to come to the perfyte
knowledge and sight of the infinyte dyuynely substance and first cause / and
that god has given that natural properte to the soul to come to that perfyte
knowledge and sight. Then if that be the natural properte given of god / ergo
the soul must onys nedys use his properte / that is to say to have the parfyte
knowledge and sight of yt infynyte dyuynely substance yt is god. But sith the
soul of man can not use his properte / as to have that true parfyte knowledge
and sight thereof here in this dark life / but darkly as under a cloud or a
myste / therefore it is necessary that the soul of man have a being / in the
which he may have the true and parfyte syghte and knowledge of that dyuynely
substance and first cause which is god. But that parfyte sight and know lege
can the soul never have / while it is being joined with the gross body /
ergo yt follows / it must have a knowledge and sight without the gross body /
and so yt must nedys have a being without that gross bo die / and so it
follows that after the corrupcio^ of that gross body / it has a being and
is incorruptyble and immortal.


That the soul of man has none other cause of his being but god / which is
infynyte. Caput. xii.
Gyngemyn. A another reason yet is this. Every thing that is made of naught and
immedyatly create of god is infinite and shall never have end / for the heaven
/ yerth / hell and the hole ingynne of the world / were immedyatly made of god
and have no another cause of their being but only god which is infynyte. And
because that cause is infymte their beyng^ be naturally infynyte / but that
thing that has a another mean cause of his being than god / is cortuptyble /
as the body of man and best / or a house and such other / which have a
another mean cause of their growyng and being / which is the moisture of the
yerth / and the hete of the son / and form and the fassyon. Also the. v.
wyttys as the sight / the smelling / the tastynge / herynge / and touching
have a another mean cause of their being / which is the eye for the sight /
and the nose for the smelling / the tongue and mouth for tastyng / the eres for
herynge / the hands and other members of the body for touching / which. v.
wyttys have their cause and being of those members / then if the
understanding / the which is the soul of man / have none other mean cause of
his being but god yt is infynyte / ^ is immedyatly create of god / the soul
conuenyently must be infynyte. But that the soul has no another incane cause
of being but god / and that it is a thing which is immedyately create of god
/ thus it may be well proved. The soul must nedys be made of somewhat / or ^lle
of naught / ^t there can be nothing named of the which it is made / for if it
be made of any other mean thing or things / then must it be made of parts of
yt self / which so gadered togeder makes the hole soul / or (...) it is made
of some matter with some form and fassyon added thereto: but it is not made of
his parts gederyd / for the soul has no parts nor can not be deyuded. Nor
it is not made of no another matter / for every thing that is made of any matter
and be resoluyd unto the same matter whereof it was first made / when the form
or fassyon is broken and destroyed / as an image / a house / a cup of timber or
metal / and such other / which may be resoluyd unto the same matter / as unto
y^ same timber or metal / when the fassyo^ and form thereof is broken and
destroyed / and therefore sith the soul of man can not be resoluyd to no such
matter / whereof it is made / because it is but only a simple substance of it
self / er go it is made of no matter then if yt be another made of parts of it
self / another of no matter / yt has no mean cause of his creacyon and being
/ then must it ned^s be i^edyatly made of god / ergo god is only y^ cause of
his creacyon and being / and where it has no another cause of his being: but
that that it is infynyte / y^ immedyatly effect must nedys be infynyte So
consequently yt follows that the soul of man must nedys be infynyte
incorruptyble and immortal.


That the materyall substance of no thing in the world can be corruptyd / no
more can mannys soul Caput. xiii.
THere is nothing in the world that is made of any matter and form that
clearly corruptyth and comes to naught / for though y^ form and ta^yon be
corrupt and gone / yet the matter ever remains / for every corporal thing in
the world is co^pound of y^. iiii. eleme^tes / and ever it is resoluyd again
unto y^. iiii. elements / of the which it is co^pound / that is to say either
in to the fire / air water / or yerth. So that those. iiii. ele mentes nor no
part of the^ can never be corruptyd / because they were inmedyatly made and
create of god / for there is as much fire / air / water and yerth at this day
/ as ever was any time before this / and neither more nor less. And every
thing that is co^pounde and made of these. iiii. elements though the form
and fassyon may be corrupt / yet the matter ever remains. For take any
corporal thing that is in the world / be a stok / a stone / a plant or tree
/ or the body of any best / and break it or bren it / and do what ye can to
destroy it / yet ye shall never destroy the matter thereof to cause it utterly
to come to naught. For the yerth which is in it / will turn to yerth or ashes
/ y^ water and moisture therein will go to the ele meant of the water / so that
it will down to the holow places of the yerth / and so at the last in to the sea / or else it will be vapoured up by the hete of the son or sterrys / and
so at the last turn to reyne. The air and wind which is therein / will to
the air which is in his proper element. The fire therein will ascend to the
proper place and spear of the element of the fire. So that every one of the
elements will go to his own place and proper spear / so that the materyall
substance of every corporal thing does never perysh and come to naught but
does ever remain The^ sith that god suffered no corporal thing naturally to
corrupt and to come to naught / it is lykely that he will not suffer the soul
of man / which is so noble a thing and immedyatly made and create of god / as
I have pro ued to the before / and also made to his symylytude and lykenes /
utterly to corrupt and come to naught. So it must follow that the soul of man
must be immortal / and can never perysh and come to naught / but must ever
contynew in his being.

That man's soul that is the most perfyte and most noble thing that ever
god did ordeyne and create must have most long time to co^tynew / and remain
in his being. Cap. xiiii.
Gyngemyn. Another reason is this. Every thing the more perfyte and the more
noble that it is / the longer it is able to co^tynew in his being. But the
soul of man is the most perfyte creature and most noble c^ature that ever god
did ordeyne or create / because it is made to the sy mylytude and lykenes of
god / as I have proved to the in our first dyaloge and dysputacion. Therefore it
is most able to co^tynew in his being / but we se diverse creatures of god /
which be perfyte things and able to contynew by nature / and to have being
infynyte / as the elements that is to say / the fire / the air / the water /
the earth / as I prouyd to the here before / and also the bodies above as the
son moan and sterrys by their proper tees have a being / yt naturally they
shall never be utterly corrupt nor pe rysshed / because there is no cause of
their corrupcyon / ergo the soul of man / which is the most perfyte and most
noble thing that ever god made and ordained / must have such a being / that
shall be able to contynewe and to have a being infynyte. Therefore it must
follow that the soul of man is immortal / and shall ever co^tynue and remain
in his being.


That the soul of man has his full perfeccyon as soon as it is annexed to the
body / and that it increasyth not successyuely. Caput. xv.
COmyngo. Thy reasons so depely enter in to my heart / yt I can not avoid it /
but I must nedys grant the soul of man to be unmortall / and to have a
being / after the corrupcyon of the body. But yet one thing moves me greatly
whether y^ soul of man have his being and full perfeccyon as soon as it is
annexed to the body / or if it increase his perfeccyo^ successyuely.


Gyn. As to that it must nedys be af f^med y^ the soul has his full
perfeccyon and being / as soon as ever it is annexed to y^ body.


Common. That seems to me a strange thing / for this I suppose must be
granted yt the soul intellectyf is nothing elle but the^ understanding /
which being in the body of man is annexed to the sensytyue life / but we well
perceive that y^ body of a child in the womb of the mother has quycknes of
life / and yet lacks understanding long time both before the birth and
after / and long time after y^ birth so co^tynueth / nor has no more
pro^yuvng nor understanding then a brute best / but after by process of time
/ by techynge and instruccyon y^ understanding increasyth / wherefore it se^eth
to me / that his soul has not his perfyte being and perfeccion at the
beg^nnyng / but rather grows and ^syth as the body does.


Gyn. That doubt that thou mouest may well be asso^d / but because thou shall
better perceive my solucyon / I shall put the this symilitude / like wise as a
harper uses his harp which is his instrument to make melodye / so does the
reasonable soul use the body for his instrumente / and like wise as the harper
can not make nor she we no melodye with his harp / except yt be strynged and
in tewne / no more can the reasonable soul use nor have his operacyon in the
body nor show no reason with the body which is y^ instrument / because yt is
not perfytyde nor tewnyd. And like wise as the harper has his co^nyng and
properte of harpynge / all though he lack his harp and though his in strument
/ his harp be not parfytyd and tewnyd / and though he can not show his
connyng and properte with his instrument that is imperfect / so like wise the
soul in the body of the young child has his properte of understanding
though yt can not be showed with that vnparfyte body which is his instrument.


The dyfferens between the memory and phantasye of a brute best and the soul
of man / and that all (...) is in mannys soul at the beginning. Caput. xvi.
COmyngo. yet there is one thing wherein I am not fully satysfyed / if so be
the soul of man have his perfeccio^ of understanding in the beginning being
in the body of such an infant / then when that the infant comes to parfyte
age of dyscrecyon / yt reasonable soul being in him should have remembrance
and memory of such things / that he d^d in his infancy and chyldhode / but of
that we se the contrary by experyence therefore it should seem that the soul
has no parfyte perfeccyon of understanding in the beginning.


Gynge. As touching that questyon thou must first consider that the memory and
phantasye is not ever the same thing that the reasonable understanding is.
For memory is the power of the soul / by the which one does remember things
paste and done / and the phantasye is the operacyon of the knowledge / which is
had by reason of the. v. sensys or wits / and the brute bestes have this
phantasye and memory / which is presentyd to them by the. v. wits / yet have
they no reasonable understanding.


Co. Al yt I grant.


Gyn. Tha^ thus I wot well thou wylt grant / yt a man being of the age of.
xxx. years has than his perfyte reasonable soul / and yet that man may be so
overcome by sykenes or by dronknes that he shall lose his memory / neither can
not use his understanding reasonable / as he can do when his body is in
te^per. And yet thou wylt grant / that as long as his sensytyue life abides
in the body / his reasonable soul is not departed away / and when that man
comes again to health or to sobernes / he can not remember of that yt he did
in his seknes or dronkenes. Therefore all though that his perfyte remembrance
and memory was gone for a season / yet the reasonable soul was not then
departed and gone / and the cause is that the soul that t^me had not a body
dysposed and his perfyte instrumente / in the which he might show his
properte and use his op^racyon of understanding / for in such dronknes a man
uses but the operacyo^ of his phantasye / and not his understanding that is
the properte of his soul / therefore it stands not agayns reason that the
soul of man has his perfytnes and knowledge of scyens and conning as well in
the beginning as afterward.


Common. That conclusyon me thinks not good / yt the soul of man has as
perfyte scyens and knowledge of all thing in the be gynnyng as after / for this
we se by experye^ce that many a man incresyth his understanding by redyng /
studyeng / and techynge of other.


Gyn. But yet take heed to this point that yt thou supposyst that y^ soul
incresyth in understanding and lerneth scyens and conning by redyng and
techynge / is no thing ^llys but the repetycyon and remembrance of such
scyens and conning that the soul had before / which the memory had
forgotten and could not rehearse / for this I wot that thou and every other
reasonable man can imagyne and make many great reasons and fyndeth many subtle
inuencyo^s of reasons / which were to them never taught / and which they never
learned by redyng nor instruccyon of other men / but of their own minds and
imagynacyons / therefore because men have other understanding / scyens /
knowledge / that they have not by learning and techynge of other men. Therefore
now it must needs follow that yt science and knowledge was in the soul of man
long time before. But yet it is not so of a brute best that has but a memory
and pha^ tasye / for the best can remember nothing nor knows nothing / but
that that is presentyd and showed to him by reasons of y^. v. wits nor no
another thing can know but sensyble thing and corporal / but y^ soul of man
contrary wise remembers and knows as well things insensyble and incorporall
as corporal / as I have proved to the lately here before. Therefore between the
understanding of man / and the memory and phantasy of a brute best is a
great dyfference / and be of a contrary nature.


That the phantasye and memory of a brute best is corruptyble and mortal /
and the soul of man unmortall. Caput. xvii.
COmyngo. All that now I perceive / but al though that there be some dyfference
between the memory and phantasye of a brute best and the understanding and
soul of man / yet because the memory and phantasye of a brute best is a
thing insensyble and incorporall as well as the soul of man is / therefore it
seems it should be incorruptible as well as y^ other.


Gyn. if y^ memory or phantasy of a brute best be a thing insensyble and
incorporall / that proves it not to be incorruptyble / for the sight and
heryng of a brute best be incorporall things / yet they be not incorruptybie
/ and the cause is for those incorporall thing / depend and ha ue their
being upon things corporal. For if the eye which is the cause of the sight
and the organ of the sight be perysshed and corrupt / the sight is perysshed
and corrupt / and yet is the sight a thing incorporall. And so of all the
other. v. wits / and of the instruments and organs of them. So like wise
though the phantasye of a brute best be incorporall yet it depe^ death and
belongs to the. v. wits / and to the organs and instruments of the. v.
wits / which be things corruptyble and corporal / and also the phantasy of
a brute best never works but in and upon such thing as be sensyble and
corporal / and which may be perceived by the. v. wit nor no another things
can pceyue nor know / nor the phantasy of a brute best is never moved nor
styred but by such sensyble things / and corpo rall things which be
corruptyble and mortal / wherefore sith it depends and belongs and has his
being and operacyon upon such corrupty ble and mortal causes / it follows
well that it must needs be corruptible and mortal. Also the memory or phantasy
of a brute best judges every thing yt it seeeh hereth or perceyueth by any
of the. v. sensys all for y^ body and for the fedyng / pleasure / or ease of
the body / and to the satisfaccio^ of the bodily desire or appetyte. And the
brute best never moves nor styreth / nor labors voluntarely / but only
for the use of the body / as for his fedynge and conseruacyon of the body.
Also the brute best has no natural inclynacyo^ nor desire to any thing but
that that is for the conseruacyon of his body. Therefore sith the brute best
judged all for the body / naturally coueteth nor desires nothing but for the
body / yt follows well that the pryncypall perfeccyon and exystens of the
brute best is only the bodily life / which bodily life is mortal and
corruptyble / so the wits or senses and the organs of the^ / and the
phantasye and memory which is caused by the^ and so belongs to the brute
best must ned^s be corruptyble and mortal / nor it can not be proved that any
brute best na turally and voluntarely does nor has intended the destruccyon
of his own body / but contrary many a man has wyllyngly desired the
destruccyon of his own body and voluntarely suffered death / and so naturally
judges loves coueteth and desires the conseruacyon of an other thing than
the bodily life / so it appears to be in man a another life without the body
and his pryncypall perfeccyon not to be the bodily life / for he judges and
knows insensyble things / and things that be incorruptyble and infynyte /
otherwise than the phanthasye and memore of a brute best judges or knows.


That the soul of man uses not always his operacyon and properte. Caput. xviii.
COmyngo. yet me thinks by reason the soul of man which is the understanding
should be corruptible / because it seems though it depend not upon the hole
body / yet it depends upon che brain of y^ hed^ / which is the pryncypall
part of the body / for when a man is hurt in the brain anon his reason and
understanding begins to faint and go away / than anon that man leseth his
understanding / therefore it seems that fall the brain be clearly perysshed
and corrupt / that all y^ understanding / which is y^ soul / is clearly
perysshed and corrupt.


Gyn. That is plainly untrue and must needs be denied / that the understand
dynge depends upon the brain / for though the brain be hurt / yet is not
the understanding perysshed / but for that season the soul is occupied about
the cur^nge and helyng of that member / for as long as the soul is joined
with the body it is necessary that it have some occupacyo^ with the body / and
when any member of the body is is vehemently and hougly styred / moved / or
sore smerteth / or aketh for hurt or pain or ache anon the soul because it
is joined with y^ body / it helps to co^serue the body and it is tornyd from
the co^templacio^ of dyuynely things / and is occu pyed in such low things
longyng to the body / and puts his strength all in considering the
vehement pain / so that when the brain is hurt so that y^ humors and vapors
styre and move the specys and kinds of the phantasye / than all the strength
of the understanding of the soul intends to the phantasye / and to the
curing of those members / and for the while renneth and is occupied with the
phantasye / and so at such time the soul leseth not his perfeccyon / but
because his body with which it is joined / is not perfyte in his members /
therefore than it uses not his operacyons in contemplacyon of dyuynely things
/ but uses other open racyo^s longing to y^ body and to the phantasy. As a
harper when his har pe is out of tune must be occupied about ye wrastynge of
his harp strings / and so set them in tune before he shall be able to show any
melody or armony with his harp / and so during the time that he is tunynge
his harp / he can show no melodye nor armonye. And so the soul of man while
it is occupied in curing and tunyng his body / can not show his open racyon and
properte of his clear understanding. Therefore it appears that the
understanding depends not upon the brain / for than every brute best which
has the head and the brain hole and parfyte / and not hurt nor troubled with
superfluous humors / should have understanding / which is clearly false.


That every man's soul is of like perfeccyon. Laput. xix.
Common. Tha^ sith thou affyrmest yt ye soul never lesyth his noblenes nor
(...) / I would again know whether every man's soul be like perfyte


Gyn. I suppose ye.


Common. Me thinks thereof y^ contrary / for we se ^uyde^tly that every man
has not like understanding nor wit. For many a man can perceive and learn
that reason and scyens / that a another can not though it be never so plainly
and well declared.


Gyn. As I said to the before the cause thereof is naught else but the
vndysposycyon of his body / because of the humors in his head or in his body /
which perturbeth it / for when the head and the body is full of humors by
excessyue etyng or drynkyng / tha^ yt man uses not his vndersta^ dyng so
perfyte as he does when the body is clear of such superfluous hu mours / for
when a man is fasting / tha^ he uses his understanding more perfyte / than
when his body is so replete with superfluous humors and the mete or y^ drink
vndygested. Therefore because some men be of such complexyon / and be never
without such humors / and their heedes never clean but full of superfluous
humors / therefore they never use their understanding so parfyte and clear / as
other men that be of purer co^plexyon / and their heedes less trobled with
such superfluous humors. And also thou see this often by experience / that
many a man is apt to learn and to understand some scyens / and to perceive
the reasons thereof quyckly and perfytly / and to learn a another scyens or
conning / he is nothing apt but very dull / as sometime if two men of like
age be / the one shall be apt to learn or to understand the scyens of musyke
and synging of dyscant / but to learn the scyens of logyke or philosophy he
shall be but dull / and the other man shall be apt to learn and also to
understand the scyens of logyke and phylosophye: but to learn the scyens of
musyke as dyscante or singing he shall be but dull. And some that be apt to
learn both logyke phylosop^ / and musyke as dyscant and singing / shall never
yet well perceive the methematycall scyens as geometrye / arithmetryk or as
tronomye / so yt apperyth that it is the dysposycyon and complexyon of his
body / that causes y^ aptenes thereof. Therefore though every man be not like
in dysposycio^ of the body / yet every man's soul is like perfyte.


what knowledge ma^nys soul has after it is separate from the body / and what
manner of being yt has. Laput. xx.
COmyngo. Than yet I pray the let me know thy mind in one questyon / what
manner of knowledge man's soul has after it is separate from y^ body / and
what manner of being it has.


Gyn. As touching that / the soul of man being in the body / as I have showed
to the before does understand and knows it self / and it knows well yt it
has that knowledge / and has a being in the body which body it uses as his
instrument and being in this materyall body / and by reason of materyall
things it knows things which be unmateryall / as things that be racyonal
and incorporall / as universal things and kinds of thing. It knows al^o
vice and virtue / good and bad / right and wrong / and al other things
racyonall / which be no corporal things / nor be not perceived nor known by
none of the. v. senses / nor by no instrument nor or gane of the senses / which
incorporall things be called racyonall thyng^ as god / angel man's soul /
vice / virtue and all such other / because they be known and perceived only by
reason: for though a corporal thing which is good or bad / may be seen or
felt or by any organe of the senses perceived and known that it is such a
corporal thing: yet the goodness or the badnes thereof is known but by the
reason / for a brute best may by his eye or other member see or feel a man /
that is to say / to see or feel the body of a man / but yet that brute best
can not by none of his senses know whether it be a good man or an evil man /
or whether he be vycyous or virtuous / nor know the qualytees nor y^ condycyo^s
of the man / but these propertees and qualitees be known only by reason / and
the reason only does judge them whether they be good or bad.

Also the soul of man being in his natural body does know both things
materyall and unmateryall / but yet the less that the body is mo ued and
styred / and the more quiet that the body is / the more perfyte know lege that
soul has / for a man shall better study and bring to pas any hard and
subtle conclusyon when the body is quyete and at rest / than when it is moved
and styred / or has any disease and unquietness. A man also when he is fasting
has more fresshe and quyck wit to study or to learn any scyens / art or
other conclusyon / then he has when his body is replete with mete or drink or
with superfluous humors. Also the reasonable soul of man does know and
dyscusse what is virtue and what is vice / and does reprove and dyspyseth that
thing / which the sensual appe tyte does approve / desire and follow. The
honest men virtuous men / and holy men do despise the sensual appetytes and
pleasures of the body and of the world / and sometime wyllingly put them self to
death / where no brute best will never covet nor desire his own destruccyon /
and the cause thereof is / for that yt the soul does know that it is ordained
for to have an other heynge tha^ y^ being / which it has when it is joined
with the body. And this knowledge that the soul has when it is joined with the
body it does never lose / but yt has it also when it is separate from the
body: for it is often time seen also / yt many a man being deed to all me^nes
knowledge and perceiving for y^ space of. x. or. xii. hours / and some for the
space of a day and more / has after that reuyued again / which during that
while (as the comen term is) has leyne in a trance / and after he has been
then so reuyued has told many wonderful things that he has seen being so in
a trau^ce as deed / which is an euydent prove that manne soul has an other
being without the body / and has knowledge and un derstandyng after that it is
separate from the body. Than sith the soul of man uses his properte of
understanding much better and more perfytly without y^ body / as I have proved
to the / when the body is lest moved and styred / and when it is most quiet /
and when the soul does medell lest with the body: it follows therefore
consequently that it has most knowledge when it is clearly separate from y^
body. And forther sith that the soul of man being joined with the body does
know that there is a god that go uerneth all / and has some knowledge what is
good and what is bad / and also has some knowledge what is right and what is
wrong / and that the perfyte perfeccyon as I have proved to the / is when it is
separate from y^ body / than after such separacyon / that soul must have a
more knowledge of god / and a more knowledge what is good and what is bad / and a
more knowledge what is right and what is wrong / and a more knowledge in eve ry
other cause and thing / than it had when it was joined with this corruptyble
body.


Common. That conclusion follows right well / but yet I pray the sith the soul
of man has such knowledge as thou say / yet than I would know what manner of
being the soul has after it is sepa rate from the body / and where does
that soul remain or become.


Gynge. As touching the being of the soul / as I have showed the / the soul
is but a spyrituall substance / and has his being in no natural place.


Common. why what call thou a natural place.


Gynge. I call a natural place as ye philosophers have defyned yt / that is
thus. A place is the utter and extreme term or part and holowe superfycyes of
a body co^teynyng a another body within it.


Common. why what call thou a super^ves?


Gyn. A superfycyes is that which has but length and bread and no manner of
thyckenes / for if it have length bread and thycknes than it is a body / so
that every thing that I see / which is the obiecte of my sight and whervppon
my sight does rest / not consyderyng the thyck nes is called a superfycyes / so
that the utter part of every bodily thing that I do see is called the
superfycyes / because I do see the length and bread thereof / and not the
thycknes thereof / tha^ as I said before / as touching y^ dyffinycyon of a
natural place / it is but the utter and extreme term or part and y^ holow
superfycyes of a body conteynyng a another body / which is within it / as by
example a tonne is called by the comen people the place of the wine / because yt
conteyneth the wine within it / and so that holow superfycies of the tonne is
the very natural place of the wine. And than forther to thy questyon I say /
that the soul has his being in no natu rall place / because it is but a
spyrytuall substance and no corporal substance nor body. And such a
natural place doth-conteyne within it always a corporal substance and a
bodily thing / and therefore the soul can never be contained nor rest in no
natural place / for though that every thing which is in any such natural place
has a being / yet every thing y^ has being is not in a natural place /
therefore the soul of man has h^s being in no natural place / but is there
where it does please god to lymyte it to be / which no man's wit nor capacyte
living in yerth is able to co^prehende. But by the justice of god / as I
showed the before / if it have deserved in this world to have a joyful being
/ yt shall have a joyful being perpetual / and if it have deseruyd to have a
miserable and a sorrowful being / it shall have a miserable and a sorrowful
being perpetual / so that the soul of man is ever a thing perpetual / and
has an infinyte being.


Common. Now thy solucyons be so m^lous and also so rea sonable that they please
me well / and thou have fully satysfyed my mind in all my questyons and
demaundes / that I must nedys consent and agree by very reason that the soul
of man is immortal and shall never dye / how be it I meruell myche where thou
have learned and had all this conning knowledge of all these things / which
thou have declared unto me: for I here say that in thy country there is but a
little learning or study of philosophy. And I here say that the comen people
there shall not be suffered to study any manner of subtle s^s or art / nor
that ye have no manner of places ordained by your heddys and governors / where
the people shall re sort to gyder for the learning thereof / nor no ways used
that children and young men dysposed to learning / shall have any exhibycyon or
fyndyng or help or fortherans thereto / as we se in Chrystendome to have diverse
places of studyes and vnyuersytees / where such as be dysposed to learn may
resort and have good exhybicion and help to the same.


Gyn. As touching that matter I assure the / the lernyng that I have gotten /
has not ben all in mine own country / for in my youth I had good parents
and friends that for the love they bare to me / and because they would I should
use the fete of marchaundyse among chrystenmen (because that great lucre
comes thereby) did put me forth to the intent I should learn some other
strange languages / by whose help and means I was in diverse cities and
vnyuersytees in crystendome long time abydyng and suggernyng where I learned
part of my phylosophye and of other scyens.


Common. Than I meruell much the less / and I thank the with all my heart for
this that I have now learned of the / wherein as I said / thou have merueylously
pleased me and satysfyed my mind.


Gyn. I am very glad if I have done to the any pleasure. Therefore sith yt thy
mind is somewhat satysfyed: I purpose now to depart from the / for a season
somewhat to be occupied about mine own be synes.


Comyngo. Nay I pray the tarry yet a little while for my mind is not yet fully
sa tysfyed in other things.


Gyngemyn. I am content yet for thy pleasure to tarry with the still for a sea
son and therefore I pray the now show me forther thy mind / and say on what
thou wylt.


Thus ends the second dyaloge of the immortalyte of man's soul.
The third dialoge
That the soul does suffer and noth the body / and that by the justice of god
there must be a purgatory / because that sometime man dies without making
full satysfaccyon. Cap. i.
COmyngo. As touching the meuelous existens of god / and the immortalyte of
man's soul / thou have made to me so many merueylous reasons / y^ I must
nedys affirm both thy pryncyples / that is to say / that there is one god
which governs all conserueth all / and regards all / and also that the
soul of man is immortal and shall never dye / but that yt shall re ceyue joy
or sorrow in a another world after yt it is sepa rate from this corruptyble body.
But yet me thinks thou have made a great dygressyon from the matter that we
first began / which was yt there is a purgatory / where the soul of man after
this mortal life shall be pu nysshed for such offenses done here in yerth /
wherefore he made not here full satysfaccion / and so to be puryfyed before that
yt come to the place of joy.


Gynge. Nay I have made not dygressyon from the matter / but I have made a
preparacyon to the matter / for the reasons which I have showed to the here
before / and the conclusyons that I have proved touching the marvelous exystens
of god / and yt immortalyte of man's soul / be but the antecedens of the
arguments / which I purpose to make in prouyng that there is a purgatory.


Comyngo. Than I pray the go breuely to the matter and let us spend no time in
vain / but yet first I pray the tell me one thing / whether is it the soul
of man alone that suf fereth the pain and sorrow / or whether is it the body
of man alone that, suffers pain and sorrow / or both to geder.


Gyngemyn. It is the soul that sussereth always pain and sorrow and not the
body / for there is nothing that can suffer pain or pleasure but that thing /
which at y^ lest has sensytyue soul and life / for a stone / a tree / nor
other thing / which have no sensytyue life can suffer another pain nor
pleasure / but yet some time that soul does suffer pain beyngewyth the body /
as when the body is perturbed and let from the natural course of his
conseruacyon / as when y^ body is to much hot or to much cold / or to much
dry / or to much moist / or has other impedyment which l^teth the natural
course of his conseruacyon / than that soul suffers pain being with the
body.


Common. That stands as me seems with good reason / therefore I pray the
proceed to the matter.


Gynge. with right good will / and therefore I pray the now take heed. Thou
reme^brest well that I have prouyd unto the in our second dyaloge and
dysputacyon / that god is of him self ryghteous and just / and executyth
evermore good and indyffere^t justice to cuery one of his creatures / and does
reward and punysh every creature according to his desert. And that man is the
only creature / whom he has created here living upon yerth / to do him honor
and service / and that no another creature here in earth does service and honor
to god but only man / as I have prouyd unto the here before in our second dya
loge and dysputacyon. And because that many a man here in yerth does not honor
nor serve god as he ought to do / but is neglygent therein and br^keth the
commandments of god / and is dysobe dyent unto god / and is not therefore
suffyc^e^tly punysshed in this world but dies before such punishment or
satisfaccion here upon yerth by him made / it must needs therefore follow that
god of his ryghteousnes must cause that man to be purged and puryfyed in a
another place to make satysfaccyon for those offen ces / before that he shall be
able to perceive the eternal joy / or to be partyner of the goodness of god /
for the which he was created and made. And so by the justice of god there must
nedys be a purgatory.


An obieccyon / because repentance is the only thing / that clearly wassheth
and puttyth away ^ll sin done by man / and that god of his justice must than
dyscharge him thereof / therefore it needs tha^ no another purgatory. Laput. ii.
COmyngo. That reason me thinks takes but small hold / for thou know
well and all clerks here to agree / yt repentance is the very only thing that
wasshyth and puttyth clearly a way all sin done by man agayns god: and that
repentance is only that thing that god would have to be made and done for the
satysfaccio^ of the sin / for which repentance so made and had / god of
his merciful goodness does dys charge acquyte and pardon the man for that sin
and offense so done / all though that man never took nor suffered any other
penance or pain therefore here upon yerthe / as by example if that I owe to
the an L. (...). of true det / and if yt I humbly desire the to forgive me my
det / tha^ if thou of thy gentylnes only for that love that thou knows that
I bear unto the wylt dyscharge and pardon to me that det / and make a clear
relese un to me thereof. I am tha^ clearly dyscharged of that det nor am never
bound by order of no law nor justice to make any other payment or satysfaccyo^
to the therefore. So like wise when god of his goodness forgyueth me mine offense
and sin for the repentance that I have taken therefore / I am tha^ clearly
releasyd and dyschargyd of that offense and sin / and ought never to have
other punyshme^t or to make other satysfaccyon therefore / and so than it shall
not stand with any co^uenyent reason / yt there should be any purgatory / or
place of punishment for that offense and sin which is pardoned and released /
but that after such pardon and release made by god to me for mine offense and
sin / that god of his goodness should reward me / and so to make me
partyner of the eternal joy in heaven / for the which I was create and made.
And on the other side if I were never repentaunt for my offense / but dyed
unpenytent / than god of hi^ iusty^ must give me eternal punishment therefore
in hell / and therefore to put any purgarye / yt should seem by the ryght^ousnes
of god to be but in v^yne.


The solucyon if god should be compelled to forgive the sin immedyatly after
repentance / he should be restreyned of his syberte / and from the exe^ucyon of
his justice. Laput. iii.
Gyngemyn. Thy answer methy^beth is not suffycyent / for in the case which
thou ha^ put / if thou desire my forgyuenes of thy. L. (...). yet yt it is at
my lyberte and of my gentylnes / whether I will will forgive the ye hole. L.
(...). or else part thereof. And if I think in my mind that the forgynenes
of the hole. L. li. is to great a reward to the for any louc or kyndnes that
thou haste. she wed unto me / or else if I th^nke that thy love and kyndnes
showed to me is a suffyey^nt recompense for that L. (...). but yet per
adventure I think that it is not a suffy^nt satye ^cyon and recompense for the
loss of time and damages / hurt and hynderaunce that I have had for the none
payment of the. L. (...). wh^che peradventure should have been paid to me long
time before: than y^ I of my gentilnes do forgrue the the hole L. li. and yet
for that gentylnes yt I she we to the (because it is at my lyberte / whether I
will forgive the or no) I will that thou should do me some other service / and
take some pa^n or (...) for me by the space of two or (...) daees. Than thou
can not say / but than I do to the no (...) / but show to the gentylnes and
great metcy. So like wise when thou take repentauce and ask^st mercy of god
for thy synnc: no man ought to be so folysh to think that god should be
restrained and compelled / but that he is at his lyberte always to execute hi^
^ustyce or mercy at his pleasure / and that evermore it is at his liberte
whether he will forgive or no. For if god should be compelled to do the one or
the other / than god should have no noble being / but a being and a life in a
manner in boundage and seruytude. But god must nedys have the most noblest life
and most pleasant life as I have proved before to the in our second dyaloge /
than god must evermore be at his lyberte to execute his justice or mercy at
his pleasure. And than if that god upon the repentance will forgive the / and
yet if he think that yt repentance which thou have taken for thy sin / is
not suffycyent satysfaceyon therefore and than if thou dyc before any other
satysfaccyon made / tha^ god of necessite if he, (...) ^xecute his justice /
must need (cause ye to be punished in a another place / to make a full
satysfaccyon for thine offense / but yet in that case if he will execute his
mercy / he may than at his pleasure forgive the all thy hole offense and sin
/ without any other satysfaccyon to be suffered or done by the therefore. But yet
if god in that case should think that thy repentance here in yerth were no
full satisfaccyon for thy sin / than if god should be so restrained / y^ he
should not ordeyne a place of purgacyon for thy soul / where it should for a
season remain and have punishment to make a full satysfaccyon for thyn offense
and sin: than thou would exclude god both from his lyberte and from the
execucyon of his justice. Therefore yt follows by all conuenyent reason / that
there must nedys be a purgatory / where me^nes soul shall be purged / or ellis
they that should hold that opynyo^ that there is no such purgatory / should
offer to god a great wrong / and should exclude goddys power / and put him
both^ from his lyberte and execucyon of his justice.


An obi^yon because man is ordained to have an infy nyte being / therefore
after his death he must have infynyte joy or infynyte pain / and so no pain in
purgatory which has an end. Caput. iiii.
COmyngo. Though one should hold that opinion that there is no purgatory / yet
he should thereby another mynysh y^ power of god another restrain his lyberte /
another exclude the justice of god / for man is made and ordained by god to have
a being infynyte / and that there is but two things ordained for man's soul
/ which is joy or sorrow. And sith the soul of man after that it is separate
from this corruptyble body must nedys have an infynyte being / as thou have
proucd in thy second dyaloge / which must be than infynyte sorrow or infynyte
joy / and tha^ as soon as it is separate from the corruptyble body / god must
than of his justice judge that soul other to the place where is infynyte joy /
or to that place where is infinyte sorw / according as it has deserved. So
tha^ yt should se^e in vain to put any purgatory / where the soul should have
any sorrow yt should have an end / or to put any other place of joy / where
the soul should have joy / which joy should have an end.


The solucyon as there be degrees in sin / as some sin is more and some
less: so there be degrees in repentance / as some may be more and some less:
and also degrees of pardon and forgy uenes / therefore man for lak of sufficient
repentance must be purged. Laput. v.
Gyngemyn. To satysfye thy mind in that point thou must consy der that god of
his goodness has create the world and all thing therein contained / in a
conuenyent order of degree. And thus / of all the kind of things that ever
god made / some be more and some less / some be small and some smaller. As of
corporal things some be hard / some more hard / and some be soft and some
be more soft / some be hot and some be more hot / and some be cold and some
be more cold / like wise of things incorporall some be great and some be
greater. As of virtue / some is good and some better and of vice some is evil
and some is worse how say thou thynkest not thou that this pryncyple / is
reasonable and true.


Comyngo. I think yt is true that thou say.


Gyngemyn. Than thus is not some syn and offense that a man co^mytteth sometime
more and sometime less.


Common. I think so.


Gyn. And does not every offense deserve punishment.


Common. yes.


Gyng. Than is there no degrees in punishment / as well as there is degrees in
sin and offense / so that some punishment / is more and some is less / and
is there not also degrees in repentance / and some repentance is great and
some greater: and also degrees in forgyuenes and pardone / as some forgyuenes
and pardone great and some greater.


Common. what than.


Gynge. Tha^ ought not every offense and sin be punysshed by ye justice of
god in order and degree according as it is / so yt if ye offense and sin be
great / it ought to have a great punishment: and if it be small it ought to
have small punishment.


Co. Just.


Gyn. Than I say / wha^ that a man here in yerth has committed a great sin
and offense / and taken repentance whereby the sin is forgyuen / and yet has
not taken such sufficient repentance therefore / nor had any suffycyent
punishment / which should make a full payment and satisfaccyo^ for that sin /
and dies before any co^dygne or full satysfaccion made / god must nedys than
of his ryghteous nes ordeyne a place of purgatory / where his soul shall have
a forther pu nyshment to make a condygne and full satysfaccyo^ for that sin /
and so to be purged and puryfyed before yt shall be able and worthy to be
admytted to receive the eternal joy in heaven. As by example / if a man commit
a treason against his prince / wherefore he ought by order of the law to lose
his goods / and to have imprysonment / and also to be put to detche and when
he is conuycted there upon / than because he seeyth he can not avoid from the
punishment of the law / he is repentaunt and sorry for his offense and prays
his prince of forgyuenes / yet this repentance and sorrow that he takes for
his offense (...) can never be so great / but that yet this prince by justice
may take his good / and inpryson his body / and af ter that put him to death
for the said offense by order of his laws / and do him justice. And so at his
pleasure execute ye extremyte of his law / with out doing any wrong to him.
But yet this prince may if he will by his mercy pardon his life / and take his
goods and impryson his body for a time and season / or as long as he will at
his pleasure / and according to the degree and qualyte of the same offense /
till he have made a full satysfaccyon to his prince for that treason done to
him / but yet if y^ prince should punyshe every offender to thexstremyte of death
without any mercy: it should seem a thing so wnyng to cruelte / and also
clearly agayns y^ prerogatyue of his merciful power and auctoryte. And also if
a prince in such case should forgive every such offender for such a great
offense / which has taken but a small repentance and soro we therefore / it
should both be an example to all such offenders / and to give the^ and all
other comfort and boldness to do like offenses / which were a thing / yt
should (...) to the subuersyon of his law / and derogacion of iustyee.
Therefore if such a prince would be reputed for a dyscret prince / and a
merciful prince he must sometime forgive the hole offense / and sometime execute
justice according to his laws / and also sometime pardone part of the
punishment condign for the offense / and give but a temporal pun^shment for a
time and season according to the degree and qualyte of the o^fence / and of the
repentance. And so like wise when that a man has committed a sin and an
offense / and takes some repentance therefore / but not suffy cyent / and than
dies: tha^ god of his goodness by y^ order of his justice and mercy / must
sometime pardone that offense from the eternal death / and yet give him some
punishment / which should not be to the extremyte / as to condem^ne his soul to
eternal sorrow and pain / but to have some (...) for a time and season to
puryfye and to purge the soul of that offense / according to degree and
qualyte of the offense / for as I said before / as there is degeees in
repentance / as some is more and some is (...) / ^o god of h^s justice must
use degrees in forgyuenes and in pardon: so that though he forgive the eternal
pain and sorrow / which is co^dygne for the great offense and sin which the
man did commit: yet it ston death with the great dyscreat wysdom of god to
punysh the soul for that offense for a season to puryfye and purge it that yt
may be able to be admytted to come to the eternal joy / for the which he was
made and create For if that men co^myttynge diverse sins or offenses agayns
god / in diverse orders and degrees / as some more and some less / and diverse
of the^ take repentance dyuersly / some more / and some less / and than if
god should not use diverse degrees of forgyuenes and pardon / but punysshe every
of them eternally therefore / yt should sown than to the subuersyon of his own
law^ / and derogacyon of his justice / and also agayns the prerogatyfe if his
merciful power and authoryte. Therefore it must nedys be agreed by all reason /
that there must be a purgatory / where the soul of man must be puryfyed and
purged for a season to make full satysfaccyon for such offenses and sins /
for the which the man made not suf fycyent fatysfaccyon here in yerth / and
took not suffycyent repentance therefore.


An obieccyon / that because there be degrees in heaven and hell of joy and
pain / that it is nedeles for god to put any purgatory / for he may execute
his full and indysferent ius^yce in one of those two places. Laput. vi.
COmyngo. Thou have made to me a marvelous reason herein / but yet me thinks
though that god by the marvelous order of his c^e acion / has create every
thing in order and degrees / as some great and some greater / so of offense and
syn / some is great and some is greater and of punishment therefore some to be
great / and some greater / of merytoryous deeds some great some greater / and
of repentance some great and some greater / and of forgyuenes and pardon some
great and some greater: yet that proves not that by the dyscrete wisdom and
justice of god / that there must nedys be a purgatory / for god may by the
order of good justice punysh every offense done by man / in order and ac
cordynge to his degrees / and reward every merytoryous act in order and
degree as they ought to be / some more and some less / though there be no
purgatory but only heaven and hell / for like wise as thou saydest ^rewhyle /
as there is orders and degrees of every thing here in yerthe / so I suppose
and doubt not but there is degrees both in heaven and hell / as some soul in
heaven shall have a great joy / and some shall have a grea ter joy / and yet
both these joys to be infynyte / and also in hell some sou le there to have a
great punishment and some a greater / and yet both these punyshmentes to be
infynyte. So that god by his justice may punysh every soul in hell / and
reward every soul in heaven in conuenyent order and degree according to their
deserts: and yet all those punyshmentes and rewards to be infynyte / and so
every thing in his order and degree. Therefore it should seem nedeles for god
than to put or to ordeyne any purgatory.


The solucyon / that as the appell which has a vegetatyue soul / and as the beast which has a sensytyue soul / may be purged after that they be
seuer^d from their natural growyng and life / of such tokens and spots
which be a deformyte to them / so the soul intellcctyue must be purged of
those tokens and spots of sin / which was a deformyte to yt. Laput. vii.
Gyngemyn. That is a very sore obieccyon / that thou have now put and aledged.
But yet not wythstandynge / if thou will pacyently here me / I dout not but I
shall give the a good suffycyent solucyo^ thereto and to satilfye thy mind
therein Therefore I pray the take good head to this that I shall now show to
the / I trust it is not out of thy re membrau^ce that I showed the / but late
that there be. iii. kyndys of souls One is a soul vegetative / which is in
every plant / tree / grass / herb / and fruit. Another is a soul sensytiue
which is in every brute sen suall best / as well horse sheep and such other as
go and crepe upon the yerth as in the birds that fle in the air / and fyshe
which swym in the water which use and occupy their. v. senses / that is to
sey / tastyng / smellyng / heryng / seeing / and touching. And the third soul
is ye soul intellectiue which is i^ man / which is nothig else but ye lively
understanding / whereby man knowith the good from the evil / dyscussynge the
thing by arguments and reasons / for the one part and for the other / till at
the last he thereby fyndith out the truth / and so thereby knowith which is
good and which is evil.


Common. All that I am content to grant.


Gyng. Sith this thing is now well by the perceived / now will I proceed to the
solucyon of thine obieccyon. But first I will show the an example of thyngys
having soul vegetative as an apple which has but soul vegetative if such
an apple growyng on the tree be hurt with some great stroke / and thereby in some
part somewhat rotten and peryshed / and if that apple immedyatly after be
pulled from the tree / now that apple can never len ger grow: and then if
thou woldeste keep that same apple to the intent to serve the at thy table at
some great dinner and feast that thou would af terwarde make to thy frendys
and lovers / this appell shall not be able than to do to the no good service /
because the longer thou kepeste it / it will be wors and worse / and by reason
of that stroke it will wax more rotten / and at the last wax all to naught and
not able to be eten: and also if thou lay that appell among other apples / it
will infecte all those appels / which lie nygh it / and make them rotten and
naught. But yet if such an appell ha uynge such a stroke growing upon the tree
/ be suffered still to grow and not pulled of the tree / such an apple oftymes
will naturally preserve and hele it self again / and the radycall natural
humor of that appell will increase while it is growing / and expulse those
humors which were corrupt by reason of the said stroke / and so make that
appell a hole and a sownde appell / able to be kept to do thy service after at
thy table / when thou shall make thy dinner and feast to thy fre^des and lovers.
But yet if thou take an appell from that tree / which is a sownde appell but
yet it is not fully ripe / because there remains i it such a sour watery
humor which makes yt not pleasant to be eten / yet if thou lay that appell
in fair straw in some house where the temperate eyer may come to it / tha^
that eyer will puryfye and purge that appell from that sour humor and vapor
out the tartnes and sowernes of that humor / and so make it melowe and
pleasant to be eten. So like wise now I may say of a man which has soul
intellectyue / if he be infecte or corrupted with the stroke of doing some
great mortal sin and offense agayns god / and than the soul immedyatly
pulled and separate from the body by natural death without repentance / tha^
the soul of that man shall never be able to be received of god / and do him
service in heaven / because it has such a mortal wou^d whereby it is infecte
and putryfyed not worthy to be admytted to accompany with ye clean pure souls
in heaven. And yet yt man while his soul was joy nyd with y^ corruptyble body
might have taken repe^tau^ce which might have restored him again to health and
to virtue. But after the natural death that man can take no such repentance /
whereby he should be helyd of that mortal synnc and offense / than god of his
justice must cler^ly expulse his soul from the eternal joy in heaven / because
it is putryfyed and corrupted. But yet if a man have committed such a great
mortal sin and offense to god / and has taken repentance / whereby that
mortal stroke and wou^d is heled before his death / and before his soul is
separate and pulled fro yt body: but yet that man is not fully purged thereof /
or ^lle not clean of other small offenses / nor ready nor ripe to do pure and
clean service to god in heaven / but that there remains in him some tokens and
spots of sin and offense god of his justice may not then condemn his
soul to eternal punishment / nor immedyatly to rec^yue that soul to the
bliss ofheue^ / to joy and to company with those gloryfyed and pure souls in
heaven / till those tokens and spots of sin be clear washed away and
purged / and he made re die and (...) to do to god pure and clean service in
heaven. Therefore than by conuenyent justice of god / there inuste nedys be a
place of purgacyon / where his soul must be purged and made clean of those
tokens and spots of sin / or that it be able to be received to the eternal
joy in heaven. And also a like resemblaunce I may make of things which have
soul sensy tyue / as if thou have a swyne which is infected with pox or other
syknes or an ox that is infected with any syknes / which swyne or ox if they
should be than slain / were not good nor wholesome for ma^nys mete / but the
flesh putryfyed corupte / and yet by medicine and good keeping that swyne or ox
may be heled / and than while those (...) be living / nature shall ex pulse
those infectuos humors / and bring those bestes again to health and make
them so wnde and their flesh good and wholesome for mannys mete. But yet if those
bestes which have ven infecte with such corrupt syknes have taken medycyne /
and that corrupt syknes thereby expelled / and ever in cresynge to more health
and the felsh wholesome enough to be eten for man ^ys mete. But yet the flesh is
so bare and lene / that it is not pleasant to ete as other flesh is. Or cllys
if such bestys have taken some disease by ex cessyue cold or hete / and the
flesh not putryfyed nor corrupt / but bare and lene / and therefore not
pleasant to be eten for mannys mete: yet if those best us be killed / yet thou
may make the flesh of those bestys / though it be never so lene by seething
or rostynge it with butter or fat larde to be good man's mete / and pleasant
to be eten able to serve the at thy dinner or feast for thy friends and lovers.
So in the same manner it is / wha^ that a man is infecte with a great mortal
sin which he has committed agayns god. And if his soul were than separate
from his body / yet then his soul ought not to be received of god in to heaven
/ nor to do service there unto god because it is putryfyed and corrupted with
yt foul mortal sin / but if that man had taken the medecin of full
repentance in his life / that medecyn would have restored him again to his
soul health and virtue. But yet if he have taken some repentance for that
sin and of fence and not suffycient / and not had suffycyent time to make
suffycyent sa tysfaccyon therefore: yet by the taking of that medecyn of
repentance / that syn is expelled and gone / and the soul of that s^kenes and
sin is clearly hole: but yet the tokens and spottys of that sin which is a
defor myt^ to the soul do still remanyn in that soul / till yt soul have a
time to be washed and purged from those tokens and spottys to make yt pure and
dene of that deformyte.


An obieccyon / that the soul unpurged may do some mean and low service to
god in h^ue^ / though it be not the highest and best seruyc^ /so that it needs
not to be purged. Caput. viii.
COmyngo. yet me thinks that proves not y^ of necessyte there must be a
purgatory / to purge and to wasshe a way clean those spots and tokens which
is but a deformyte to the soul / but co^syderynge that by that medecyne of
repentance / that sekenes of the soul is thereby put away and expelled / and
the soul so made hole again / all though that there be spots and tokens
remaining which is but a deformyte to the soul and no mortal sekenes / those
tokens and spots than need not to be washed away / but if they remain still
yet they do no hurt / but yt soul may do good and perfyte service to god in
heaven: for all though that god will not put such souls in the highest and most
purest place in heaven becau se they be not so pure as other souls be / but
somewhat deformed which is but as an eye sore / yet he will not clearly expel
the^ out of heaven / but put them in some other low place in heaven. As by
example / if y^ a man which keeps an honorable house and uses to feast great
lords and estates at his table / and prepares fine dyaper table clothys and
napkyns / where with to serve them at his table at his dyners and feast / if
any of those table clothes or napke^s be defouled with dust fylth or other
foul matter which is not sweet / yet yt man will not suffer those clothes to be
occupied at his table / till they be washed and made clean / and the fylth so
clearly expelled / that they may be sweet and clean and worthy to serve him at
his table. But yet if they have been so defouled with some foul fylth / where by
they be stained that though they be washed never so clean / yet some spot and
token will remain of that staynynge / so that though they be pure clean and
sweet enough to do service at his table / yet y^ spots and tokens of the
steynynge which remain be than a great deformyte and ^ye sore: yet this man if
he be wise will not cast away those clothes / but will that they shall do him
service in some other place and office of his house as in his buttry or ewry or
his chamber / where they shall do to him as good service / as though they were
not stained nor had no such spots nor tokens of deformyte to the eye. And
like resemblance also. I may make of a prince / which must retain in his house
to be his household servants such men as he ca^ choose in his reame which be
clean me^ and hole me^ of body some to be in his pryue chamber / some in his
hall / and some in his kychyn and some in other places of his house / if any
such servants / which this prince has chosen to be in his house / have had
any great syknes whereof he is by medecyne thoroughly helyd / and yet there
remaynyth some deformite in his face or other part of his body^ / as that his
skyn of his face is parched and shronke by brennyge of fire / or else bleryed
/ or his nose rot ted away and so his face utterly deformed / or ellis any
other member of his body deformed / and yet the man is clear hole of all syknes
and strong and able to do good service to his prince in diverse romes and
offices in his house / all though it be not conuenyent for the honor of this
prince to hauc this deformed person to be in his chamber of estate or in his
hall / yet this person so deformed and being hole may serve this prince in his
kyche^ there to be his scollyon / or in some other office to bear water / wode
/ or to cleanse gutters / or other vile place in this pricis house / and so in
this prince house to have a joyful and merry life / wherewyth he wylbe
meruelously well content / all though he never be admitted to do service in his
chamber nor hall. So like wise in heaven god has ordained for them that be the
most pure and clean souls / the most pure and clean places / where they
shall have most highest joy / and for the other mean souls a mean place of
joy. And for those souls that have been infected with some mortal sin / and
heled thereof by the medecyne of repentance / and yet the spots and tokens of
that sin do still appear and remain in the soul / which is but as an eye
sore or a deformyte to the soul / yet because that mortal sekenes by the
medecyn of repentance is clearly expelled and gone / and destroyed / god may
not than of his justice cast that soul away out of heaven unto eternal
punyshme^t in hell / but will suffer that soul to live and to joy with him in
heaven in some low and mean place in heaven: all though that he will not suffer
this soul to come to the highest places / where most joy is in heaven / because
it is not co^uenyent that this soul should possede the highest joys in heaven /
because that it is not worthy to be received and admytted thereto / for that
that yt is somewhat deformed and not worthy to come to so high a place and
rome: but yet in the low plac^s and romys in heaven / this soul not
withstanding it be somewhat deformed / may do to god there some service and
pleasure / and yet there have a joyous life / wherewyth this soul will be
right well contentyd. And therefore sith y^ god by justice and equity may
ordeyne this soul a conuenyent place in heaven / according as it is worthy and
has deserved: it were than a thing frustrate and in vain for god to ordeyne
any place of purgatory / where that soul should be purged for a season / and
after that to be restored and received in to heaven / because that god may
reward that soul in heaven according to his deseruynge / and so nedelesse to
ordeyne for it any place of purgacyon.


The solucyon that nothing unpurged and vnpure may remain and abide in heaven.
Caput. ix.
Gyngemyn. That obieccion and symylytude which thou have made me thinks is
nothing to purpose / for thou must consider that god in whom is all goodness /
justice / wisdom / virtue and perfeccyon in his marvelous workys of creacyon
of things has create and ordered every thing in so good and perfyte an
order / that can not be amended. And has ordained some places of joy / and
some places of punishment convenient for every creature / which does deserve
other y^ one or the other: and that he has ordained heaven to be the place of
felycyte / where is all joy and pleasure without pain or disease / and that
this place where we and other bestes live here upon yerth / is y^ place myxed
with joy and pain and yt all creatures living here sometime suffer joy and
sometime pain. And the low place which we call hell / is y^ place of eternal
punishment and pain without any joy or pleasure: and that the place of heaven
where his pleasure is to be eternally gloryfyed with the company of his angels
and holy saints / is a place of eternal joy / and by all conuenyent reason
worthy to be so clean / so pure / so fair / so pleasant / so full of joy and
felycyte / that there can be no place more pure / more clear / more pleasant
nor of more joy / nor of more pleasure / but that place must be so clean of
nature / that it must expel all manner of impuryte and uncleanness / nor suffer
any thing therein / that is of any manner of uncleanness or evil / or other
thing unpleasant. For as ye see by experyence as the eyer / which of yt self
is myche more pure and clean than the element of the yerth / if there be any
corrupt stynkynge water or other humor upon yerth / that water or humor by
the hete of the son vapored up in to the hye regyone of the eyer / is there
so puryfyed that when yt descendyth it is without any corrupcyo^ stynke or salt
taste / but fresh / sweet and clear / that yt can never be purer / so that the
hye region of the eleme^t of the pure eyer will suffer no water nor other
humor to abide there / which is not clean and pure. And like wise we may
behold this pure regyon ethereall / where the son and y^ other stars re^ne
in their speres we see them so lyghtsom / so pure and clean / that it is
impossible any corporal thing to be clener or more pure. Than sith that god by
his wonderful power great wisdom and good nesse has created those visible
thing / which appear to us of such puryte and clennes that no fylthy nor foul
thing nor other thing vnpure can remain in them or nyghe them / yt seems
than that by all conuenyence of reason yt must nedys follow that that glorious
place of heaven / which is a place more higher and excellent than those other
places / which be the regyons elementall and regyons ethereall / and where his
mageste is glo fyed / and eternally honored by his angels and saints / must
be clean and pure fair / and above all other places / and that there can be no
thing suffered to be there / but that which is all clean and pure without any
ma ner spotte or token of uncleanness / so yt it follows that no soul can be
suf fered to be there yt should have any spotte or token of sin in yt / or
any manner of deformyte which should be in any wise unpleasant. For all though
that there be places in heaven some pure and clean / and some more pure and some
more clean. And that there be joys / as some great joy / and some greatter joy:
yet there can be no places there / whereof one should be pure and a another foul
/ nor whereof one should be sweet and a another should be stynkynge / nor no life
whereof one should be a joyful life / and a another a paynfull life / nor that
no soul can be there / whereof one should be a pure and clean soul / and a
another vnpure and unclean / nor yt one soul should be fair pleasant and
goodly to behold / and a another to be foul and deformed and vglye / nor yt
one soul there should suffer joy / and a another to suffer sorrow. So now it
follows that when yt a man has committed a mortal sin and after taken
repentance / and dies by the which he is heled of that foul infyrmyte: but
yet the spottys and tokens thereof do re main / for lack of full satysfaccyon /
god of his justice may not conde^pne his soul to eternal pain in hell for
that offense / which is purged and put away / and the soul thereof clearly
discharged and made hole: and yet god by his justice nor by his dyscrete
wisdom and goodness ought not immediately to receive that soul in to that clean
and most pure place in heaven to accompany with those pure au^gelles and saints
that be there in that place / where there can be no thing but that which is all
puryfyed and clean until such time / that yt soul be cleansed and puryfyed of
those tokens and spots of sin / which remain in that soul / which tokens
and spots is ever a great deformyte to y^ soul as long as they do therein
remain / Therefore by all co^uenyent reason it must nedys follow / that beside
that glorious and joyful place of heaven / and also beside that miserable and
sorrowful place of hell / there must nedys be a third place of purgacyon /
where the soul must be puryfyed and made clean of such spottys and to kens of
sin / which remain in it / before that yt shall be able to be received in to
that glorious place in heaven / in which place there can be nothing suffered
to be / but that which is all pure and clean without any tokens or spots of
sin or uncleanness.


An obieccyon / that if there should be any place of pu^ gacyon / than that
place should be here in yerth / or else if there be any other place / where is
that place of purgatory. Caput x.
COmyngo. This is a marvelous sore and hye reason that thou haste made / but
yet me thinks / though that beside heaven and hell there should be a third
place of purgatyon / yt should seem conuenye^t that that place should be here in
yerth / and that man which has so offended / whom god would have to be purged
therefore / and after that to be received and admytted to joy wy^h him in heaven
/ may be most conuenyent ly purged thereof here in yerth / and while his soul
is joined with his bo die / because that the soul offends being with the body
/ therefore it were most convenient that that soul should be purged and
punysshed with the body. And also because that god has ordained heaven to be a
place of infynyte joy / and hell to be a place of infynyte pain / and yerth
to be a place ^yxte sometime of joy / and sometime of pain / which never
endures but for a time that shall have an end. Therefore it is most conuenyent
y^ the place of purgatory should be here in yerth / because it is the place
ordained for pain which shall have an end. And also that purgatory and
punishment here in yerth should be a great good example to all other me^ here
living / to put them in fere to do any like offense / and should cause many
men the rather to absteyne from the doing and committing of any such like
offense and sin.


The solucyon / that if god should be compelled to make purgatory here in yerth
/ that than god / yt is the hye judge should be restrained from his lyberte and
auctoryte more than any other yerthly judge / and also that it is a folysh
questyon to ask where purgatory is. Caput xi.
Gynge. That saying me seems is not to be allowed / for thy first reason /
proved not only that there should be no purgatory but only here in yerth / but
that reason proves as well that there should be no there heaven nor hell but only
here in yerth. For if a man have lived so vet tuously in yerth / whereby he
ought to be saved and go to the joys of heaven / because he did never
merytoryous act / but only when his soul was joined here with the body / then
he should never be rewarded therefore but only here in yerth while his soul was
joined with the body. And also every synue which a man co^mytteth / is done
while the soul is joined with the body / ergo than he should never have any
punishment therefore but only here in yerth while the soul is joined with the
body / and so that first reason that thou have made should prove that there is
another heaven nor hell prepared for man but here in yerth / which is clear
contrary to all the ground and pryncyples which thou have granted to me
before. And also where thou say that of co^uenyence that y^ if there should
be any pur gatory / the place should be no where else but here in yerth while
the soul is being with the body: me se^eth that therein thou would clearly
take away the liberte prerogatyue and authorite of god / and bind god to be in
more bondage and seruytude than any temporal judge / which has power to give
sentence here in yerth in any civil or te^porall causys. For a judge here in
yerth / which by the order of the law may give sentence and judgment upon any
traitor or felon / is not so bound nor restrained but that he may judge him
to be put in execucion in what place that this judge shall think conuenyent /
and also in what day and time that he will. Than god myche more by his
prerogatyue and authoryte ought to have lyberte to give his judgment and
sentence / yt the punyshme^t which is condygne for the sin and offense /
which a man here in yerth co^mytteth / shall be had in such place where god him
self shall thynk most co^ue nyent / other in yerth or in some other place at
his pleasure and lyberte / and in what time and season that he shall think
conuenyent therefore.


Common. Than I demand of the if purgatory be not here in yerth in what place
should yt be?


Gyng. As to that I say that purgatory is / that that is ordained to purge
me^nes souls / when they be separate from the body. And a soul which is no
corporal substance / but a spyrytuall does occupye no place / no more than
thy thought or mind does / which occupyeth no place. And as touching that
questyon / where and in what place purgatory is / me thinks it is great
folyshnes to demand that questyon. For I may ask the again where is heaven /
whether over thy head as thou stand / or else under thy foot / or else
before thy face / or else behynd thy back / or else upon thy right hand or
upon thy left hand or else if I ask where is the place where the glorious
trone of god is / or I ask y^ where is the highest part of hen^ / and what
thing is above the highest place or perte of heaven / or if I ask y^ / of what
matter is the heaven made / or y^ fyrmament / or y^ son moan and sterres / or
what does cause the^ to move so marvelous swyftly / which go and move about y^
yerth more tha^ C. M. mile in every. xxiiii. hours / or if I ask y^ what
thing god is and to what thing is god like / or what thing the devil is / or
what thing y^ devil is like / or to what thing a soul or angel is like / or
if I should ask y^ how many mile it is to y^ fyrmament / or how far it is to
the highest part of heaven. As for all those high questyons and many other that
may be demanded all the men in the world be not able to assoyle them / thou
may se well that this little pryk the yerth / which is no more in comparyson
to the fyrmament / than a little pese is in comparyson to a great town or
castle: It is perued by a good true and apparent co^clusyons of astronomye /
yt the son and many other of the stars in y^ fyrma^t / be every of them
much bygger than the hole yerth. There is no man in the world able to ymagyne
the greatness of the fyrmame^t / much less is he able to ymagyn the great
nesse of the heaven and of the hole world / which conteyneth all thing with in
it: for if man should be able to ymagyne or give a plain solucio^ to these and
all other such high questyons / than man should have knowledge as god. Thou
may well by thy reason perceive that god which has made this little pryk and
spotte the yerth with so many creatures living there in / has not made all the
other placys of the world beside to be destytute and vacant of creatures. But
if I should ask the / what other creatures be there in every other place of
the world / thou art not able to give me any solucyon thereto. Therefore
though god have given to man here in yerth some little understanding / reason
and knowledge of some causys and things / yet he has reserved the knowledge of
all such high causys and questyons to him self. For though that man being in
yerth here by his reason may perceive and know that there is a god that is
the cause of all / and governs all / yet he shall not be able to ymagyne nor
know what thing god is / nor to what thing he is like / and all though man
here in yerth by his reason may perceive that there is a heaven / where god of
his justice shall reward the good souls with eternal joy: yet he shall never
be able to ymagyne nor to know by his reason what manner joy yt is / nor what
thing they shall do / nor what pastyme they shall have And also all though that
man here in yerth by his reason is able to perceive and know / that god by his
justice has ordained a purgatory / where that man nys soul shall be purged of
his sin after it is separate from the body / yet he shall be never able while
he is here / to perceive nor to know where and in what place that purgatory is
/ nor what certain / nor what kind of pain they shall suffer and have / nor
how / nor in what manner that sou le is able to suffer that pain / but god has
reserved y^ knowledge of these things unto him self: therefore thou man what so
ever thou art / art very folysh / that desyrest the knowledge of such things
while thou art here in yerth / for thou nor all the men in yerth be not able
to ymagyne a solucyon for these questyons. But yet this is undoubted / that god
has or deyned a place of joy / and a place of pain / where every man's
soul shall be rewarded according to his desert / but where the place is or
what joy or what pain it shall be / or in what manner or how / no man in y^ world
can tell / but only god alone.


Common. Tha^ I am as far from the solucyon of my questyo^ as I was before.


Gyn. well than because thou art not yet fully satysfyed / I shall yet therein
peradventure ease thy mind a another way / if thy wit be able to perceive y^
reasons that I shall show the but the matter is somewhat hard / therefore as y^
latin me^ say / capiat qui ca pere potest / let him perceive the matter that can
perceive yt / for every man is not of like capacyte.


Com. Tha^ yet I pray the show yt me to see whether I can perceive it or no.


Gynge. with right good will / there fore I pray the now take good head / thou
must understand first / that there be two kinds of things which have being /
y^ one is a real thing the other is a racyonall thing. A real thing is that
which is perceived by the organes and instruments of the. v. wyttys / as the
thing which may be seen hard tasted / felt or smelled / be called real
things. But racyonall things be those which be not perceived by y^. v. wyttys
/ but only be per ceyued by reason / and they be things incorporal / as love /
charity / meke nes / abstyne^s / pride / malice / sloth and such other.
Further thou must consider that of places there be three dyuersytees. One is a
place contynen tyue / a another is a place lymytatyue / and the third is a
place operatyue. A place contynentyue is that / wherein real things as bodies
/ images and figures be contained / as y^ tonne wherein the wine is contained /
is y^ place contynentyue of the wine. A place symytatyue is / where things
racyonall and incorporall be lymyted to be / as the place lymytatyue for love /
is that thing which is loved / and that thing which is so loved / is y^ place
lymytatyue for that love / and there the love is in his place lymytatyue /
which place lymytatyue of love can not be ever certain but mutable / and
because love may be at onys in diverse things / therefore love may be in diverse
places lymytatyue at one time. A place operative is y^ place where the operacyon
of the thing is / as because we see that the marvelous ^e racyon of god is the
marvelous swyft mouynge of the heavenly speres and bodies above / which do
appear to us / therefore we say that the place where god is / is heaven: so that
where so ever the operacyo^ of god appears / there is the place operatyue of
god / and there god is. Therefore as touching thy questyon where purgatory is /
I say to the yt is no place certain con tynentyue / for that y^ a place
contyne^tyue is that which conteyneth with in yt things that be corporal. But
because purgatory is a place by god lymyted and ordained / for the purgynge of
souls / which be things racyonall and incorporall / therefore purgatory can be
no place co^tynentyue but purgatory may be a place lymytatyue / and also a
place operatyue. For where so ever that god does lymyt the soul of man after
it is separate from the body to be purged / there is y^ place lymytatyue of the
soul / and there is the purgatory of that soul. For there can be no
purgatory / but there where the soul is purged / and where so ever god does
lymyt y^ soul to be purged / there is y^ lymytatyue place of purgatory. Also
where the virtuous operacyon of god is / and where his virtuous work does
appear / there is the operatyue place of god / and there god him self is in
his place operatyue: and therefore because the marvelous operacyon and work of
god appears in every place of the world: therefore god is in every place and
part of the world according as I have proved to the here before in our first
dyaloge. And also because that purgatory where me^nys souls be purged is that
/ where god works his virtuous operation in execucio^ of his justice:
therefore that purgatory is the very place operatyue of god / which is in no
certain place contynentyue / but there where pleases god / and there and in
such time / or times / where and when and how his pleasure is that it shall be.
Therefore to thy questyon I say / y^ pur gatory is no place contynentyue of it
self / because yt conteyneth no real nor corporal things within it /
because it is ordained only for purging of souls / which be things racyonall
and incorporall. Nor also purgato ry is within no place contynentyue / because
it is no such real thing of it self / that may be perceived by any of our
five senses and wits.


An obieccyon because the mercy of god ca^ not be with out his justice / and
remyssyon is incydent to repentance: therefore as soon as repentance is taken
/ god of his justice must give remyssyon / and therefore there ought to be no
purgatory. Caput xii.
COmyngo. Thou art so subtle in thy solucyon / that I wot not well how to
reply unto the / but yet I pray the let me see how thou canste satysfye my
mind in one point. Thou dydest prove to me but late in our first dyaloge and
dysputacyon / that two things of neces syte be belonging and be incydent to
the goodness of god / that was justice and mercy / and that the one can not be
without the other.


Gyng That is truth


Comyngo. And the very dyffynycyon of justice is thus: Justice is a constant
and a perpetual will / gyuyng to every thing his own. And mercy is no more
but the mind of a pytefull affecte / and merit is the execucyon of justice /
and remyssyon is ye execucyon of mercy: and merit is always incydent to
justice / so that god by the order of justice must give to every creature his
own merit according as it does deserve to have / that is to say for sin and
offense to give punishment of pain or sorrow / and for virtue to give reward
of joy or pleasure. And that as merit is of necessyte incydent to the justice
of god / so is re myssyon incydent to the mercy of god: so that god can not
mynyster his mercy to no creature without remyssyon. And every sin that is
commit ted / by y^ justice of god it must have punyshme^t / and by the mercy of
god remyssyon. And as thou dydest grant me ere while / y^ sin is always put
away expelled and destroyed by the only medecyne of repentance: and than as
punishment by the justice of god is incydent to the repentance which takes a
way ye sin / so as god by y^ order of justice ought to give punishment for
the sin which remains / so like wise he ought by y^ order of justice to
give remissyon for that medecyn of repentance / which has taken away the
sin. And because the justice of god and the mercy of god be so correlatyue /
that the one can not be without the other / than god can never mynyster his
justice with his mercy / except that he grue remissyon as soon as the
repentance is taken. Therefore yt stands not only with y^ mercy of god / but
also with y^ justice of god / y^ as soon as repe^ taunce is taken / that god
must give remissyon / and than when god has remytted that sin / god has
than fully executed both his justice and his mercy / but if he should after that
give a ferther punyshme^t for that sin so remytted other in purgatory or
else where / yt should follow then y^ god d^de not execute his justice before /
and so than the mercy of god and the justice of god cowde not be correlatyue /
but that his mercy might be without his justice / which is contrary to that
pryncyple that we both first agreed / that his justice and mercy can not be
the one without the other / therefore yt seems there ought to be no purgatory.


The solucyon / if god should give full remyssyon for every sin without other
satisfaccyon / than god should my ^ster his mercy without justice. And as a man
may offend to god alone / and also to god and to his neighbor: therefore
satysfaccyon must be made both to god and to his neighbor / or else his
neighbor is not restored to his own. Caput. xiii.
Gyngemyn. Thou do ymagyn so many subtle obteccions in this matter / that I
can not well tell how to satys^ye thy mind / but yet this reason that thou
haste last made / does make agayns the as me seems / for we both agree that
the justice of god and the mercy of god be evermore correlatyue and concurrant
to geder / and that god does never punysh any sin / but that the pun^shment
is less than yt does deserve and therein he shows his mercy. And also god
does never reward no creature for any virtue / but that his reward is
greater than he does dedeserue to have: and therein also god does execute his
mercy / and does give remyssyon: for his remyssio^ is nothing else but a gift
of his grace and goodness / but he never gives his remyssyon but for a
conuenyent cause / which is according to his justice / because his justice
and mercy must evermore go to geder / and therefore forgofen in your douch tongue
is a very proper word for remyssyon / because it is a gift for a cawse. But
than to answer thine obieccyon / I say if that god should give remyssyon for
every sin that is committed / as soon as he has taken repentance therefore
without any other satysfaccyon / or ferther punyshme^t to be had therefore /
tha^ god should minyster his mercy without justice / for by his justice he must
give to every thing his own / which own is ye thing which it deserves to
have / so that if the repentance / which a man has taken here for his sin
be not suffycyent sorrow to counterpeyle ye pleasure which he took in doing
that sin / god must by his justice give him a ferther punyshme^t / which
must be to suffer pain or sorrow suffy cent to purge him of y^ sin / or
else y^ remyssyon which god does give for the only repentance of sin /
should be an execucyon of his mercy / and lacking execucyon of his justice
which can not be / for as we have both agreed / the mercy of god and the
justice of god be ever correlatyue and must nedys be always concurrant to
geder. And yet to satysfye thy mind forther in this point / thou wylt grant
me that the justice of god must g^ue to every creature his own / and not to
take away fro^e no creature that thing which is his: as by example if so be
that I do beat thy servant which is thine apprentyse or retained servant /
and do (...) him as cut of his hand / or hurt some other member of him / where
by thou do lose his service / and also that this servant thereby is not abl^
well dur^ng his life to get his living / if so be that thou do forgive and
release to me that offense that I have done to the for hurtyng of thy (...)
whereby thou haste lost his service: yet not withstanding thy ^uenes and thy
release made to me / yet I am bound to make a another (...) to thy servant for
the hurt that I have done to him / which is y^ cause of the hynderau^ce of his
living. But yet if I do the a trespace so y^ no man is hurted by yt trespace /
but only thou thy self / in that case if thou forgive me that trespace / I am
never bound to make other satisfaccio^ to no another man for yt trespace done
only to the. So say I like wise a man may committee here in earth diverse sins
/ some agayns god alone / and some both agayns god and his neighbor / as when
a man is negligent to serve god / or proud dysdeynous / and uses sloth or
gloteny and yet hurts not his neighbor. Also a man may do some sin / which
is both agayns god and yet so hurts his neighbor / as when I take mine
neighbors good wrongfully / or hurt his body. In that case if I take
repentance for that sin so done by me agayns god and my neighbor / though
god pardone me for that offense / whrche I have committed both agayns god and
also my neighbor: yet god by his justice may not clearly release and discharge
me without recompense and satysfaccion made to my neighbor therefore / for
justice must give to every man his own / ergo than that wrong done to my
neighbor / or that thing by wrong take in from my neighbor / must be
restored or some recompense made therefore / but if that repentance which I
have taken for that sin done to god and my neighbor / should be a clear
dyscharge to me without any satysfaccio^ made / than my neighbor in that case
should not have his own / and so justice not mynystred to him: wherefore in that
case though god forgive me / yet I am bound to make restitucio^ to my
neighbor.


Co. Than I put cause I have no goods lest nor other thing / wherewith all to
make restytucion or satysfaccyon to my neighbor / but yt I d^e be fore any
such satisfaccion made / or I put case I have enough to make sa tyssaccion to
my neighbor. But when I am repentaunt therefore and ask forgyuenes of god /
and yet I am not in will to make satysfaccio^ to mine neighbor / what shall be
tha^ done now to me by y^ justice of god.


Gyn. In that last case which thou have put / where thou art not willinge to
make satysfaccion to thy neighbor in that case it appears thou art not
repentaunte / for as a payment or redelyuere of the goods is a satisfaccyon
for the goods wrongefully taken / so repentance is a satisfaccyon in the
mind and will / for the sin which thou dedest: for the sin is ever done
with thy will / and than the repentance for thy sin to put the sin away
must be a contrary will / for as thou had a wyllwro^gfully to take thy
neighbors goods / so in the repentance thou most have a will to restore
the^ / which is a good mind and will contrary to y^ other evil mind and will
which thou had in the wro^gfull taking of the^: so I say it is impossyble
for the to have repe^tau^ce / except thou have a will to restore and to make
satysfaccion of the thing wrongfully taken. So then as I said to the before /
sith that god by his justice can not grant the his mercy and forgyuenes for
the sin except thou be repentaunt / it follows tha^ that thou can never be
forgyuen of god / except thou have a will to make restytucion and satysfaccyon
for these wrongs done by the to thy neygh bour. But to consider forther in the
other case which thou dydest put / if thou be repentaunt and ask mercy of
god and willing to make satysfaccyon / and have not wherwyth all / yet than
there is a satysfaccyon be hynde which thou ought to do to thy neighbor /
and than if thou dye and because thou can not make a satysfaccyon to him in
yerth / by the co^ue nyent justice of god thou must make a satysfaccyon to him
in a another place / which must nedys be in purgatory by some punishment which
thou must suffer therefore.


Comyngo. why what is my neighbor the better for that punishment that I have
in purgatory / or what restytucyon or satysfaccyon has he thereby.


Gyn. That punishment which thou shall have in purgatory therefore / shall be
to the releasynge of other pains and punyshmentes that thy neighbor ought to
have for other offenses which he has done agayns god / or else yt shall be to
the augme^ tynge of y^ ^oy that he ought to have for other merytoryous deeds /
which he has done for the love of god: and this does stand with conuenyent
reason / for when thou do an offense to thy neighbor there is not only a
will to do evil / but there is also an ^uyll act / and though that ^uyll will
were dyscharged by an other contrary will / which was that other good will
which thou had in the time of thy repentance and co^trycyo^ / yet yt ^uyll
act is not dyscharged till there be an other act done yt is contrary to yt
act. And all this stands with y^ justice of god / yt in the foresaid case
that thy neighbor to whom the wrong was so done must be restored and
satysfyed / because as I showed the before / the justice of god is always to
give every thing his own / and than if thy neighbor be not satysfyed and
restored for that wrong done unto him / than he has not yet his own / and
therefore by the order of justice he ought to be restored.


An obi^ccyon / that when god forgyueth it need no satysfaccyon to thy
neighbor / because god is very owner of all / and thy neyghbonr has no
properte but as a servant to god / as but to make ^ count to god. Caput.
xiiii.
COmyngo. That reason me thinks makes not agayns myn^ opinion / nor prouyth
not that if god have ons forgyuen me / yt I ought to make any forther
satisfaccion / as I shall prove it to the by an euydent example which is this:
I put case thou have a servant / who^ thou doste put in trust to have the use
and occupy^ge of thy goods and marchau^dises / and gyuest him auctoryte to
make bargayns thereof / and to change them and sell the^ to thy use / and to
make aquitaunc^s and relesis in his name / and to take bonds made to him to
thy use / and to make accounte thereof / if thy servant sell part of thy
ware / and take an oblygacyon for the payment of. xx. (...). of money for the
same / if thou after ward knowing of this / for y^ love which thou have to
the same dettour or ^duenture for some other cause wylt make to him a relesse
and a clear acquitaunce of the same. xx. (...). I suppose thou wylt not deny /
but yt this dettour is clearly dyscharged for ever of this. xx (...). nor is
not bound by any justice to make any other satisfaccio^ / another to thy
servant nor to no another person in y^ world / because thou art only the very
owner thereof and no another person / and thy servant had never but the
occupacyon thereof as to give to the an account thereof. So I say / because god
is the very owner of all goods and of all things / thou have but the
occupacion thereof as to give to god but account thereof: therefore if god do
release and forgive the / thou nedest never to make any other satysfaccyon to
thy neygh bour nor to have no another punishment therefore.


The solucion that god has an absolute power and an ordynary power / and that
by his ordynary power he ca^ not dyscharge the if thy repentance be not
suffycyent. And also that thou can not co^pelle god to forgive the by his
absolute power at thy pleasure. Caput. xv.
Gyng. As touching y^ obi^ccio^ thou must consider yt god of him self has.
(...). powers. One is an absolute power / and an other is an ordinary power.
The absolute power is yt authoryte yt god has over all thing in the world /
whereby yt he may do with every thing his own plea sure / because he is the
very and y^ first and y^ pryncypall cause of every thing / and by that power he
may give to every creature what pleases him / and also re myt and forgive
every offense done by any creature at his pleasure without any cause. But by
his ordynarye power he does every thing by order of justice and equity / as to
reward and to punysh every creature according to his desert / but when he will
execute and use his absolute power / and when he will use his ordynary power /
yt is always at his pleasure. But in the case which thou have put / when that
thou do an offense to god and also to thy neighbor / as to take thy
neighbors goods from him by vio lence and wrong / or to hurt his body /
and than if thou ask god forgyuenesse therefore / and art not wyllyng to make
satysfaccyon to thy neygh bour / in that point thou art not repentaunte /
becawse as I sarde to the here before / thou have not a contrary will to that
will / which thou had when thou had a pleasure to do to thy neighbor
that wrong and hurt which thou dyddest to him. And than if god should clearly
forgive the without any satysfaccyon or restytucyo^ to thy neighbor / than
there in god should not use his ordynary power according to his justice /
because thy neighbor is not restored to his own / which was by wrong taken
from him: and also thou should be remytted and forgyuen of god without
repentance / which is also contrary to the ordynary power of gods justice /
so yt if god in that case should forgive y^ without any will of satysfaccion to
thy neighbor / god should not use his ordynary power according to his justice
/ so I say in that case by the ordynary power of god / thou canste not be
clearly forgyuen. But furthermore if thou will say / that in that case god by
his absolute power does forgive y^ / tha^ thou would ^de god to execute his
ab^olute power at thy pleasure / which is contrary to the nature of the
absolute power of god / for his absolute power is to give and to remytte at his
own only pleasure without any cause.


Common. But than I put case that if I be repentau^t and ask forgyuenes of god
and do make satysfaccion to my neighbor for yt wrong that I did to him / or
else if I have not where with to make to him satysfaccion / but a will to do
satysfaccyon / and that I dye / if than because of my repentance god by his
ordynary power of his justice must forgive me / because that repentance is
that thing only which god would have to be done for the satysfaccyon of that
sin / and if that sin be clearly thereby dyscharged / than ^t were but vain
to put any purgatory / to put away or to wasshe away the sin / which was so
by god clearly dyscharged


Gynge. if thou think thy self by repentance to be clearly dys charged of
that sin without any other ponyshment to be had in purgatory therefore / yt
seems that there in thou art very folysh so to thynk / for if thou should be
clearly dyschargyd / either tha^ yt should be by the or dynary power of god / or
else by y^ absolute power of god / but thou can not judge thy self / and be
sure yt thou art dyschargyd by the ordinary power of god / because that there
is degrees in repentance / as some repentance is more and some is less. And
than thou can not tell how that god will accept thy repentance / nor whether
yt he will judge yt to be co^dygne and sufficye^t to wasshe away yt sin or no
/ for if it be but a small repentance so that the sorrow that thou take in
that repentance / do not co^terpeyse the pleasure / which thou had in
doing of that sin and the contynua^ce thereof / tha^ by his ordynary power he
may not clearly forgive the^ but must by the order of his justice give the a
further punyshmet in pur gatory / yt that punyshme^t may be a full recompense
to conterpayse y^ plea sure / which thou had in doing of that sin and
co^tynuance of y^ ^ame so that yt pain and sorrow sufferd afterward must be as
great as y^ pleasure which thou had before. Therefore thou art a fool to
think thy self clearly dischargyd by gods ordinary power / because thou
know not whether thy repentance be suffycyent or no. But yet further if
thou wylt say that in ca^ where thy repentance is not suffycyent to wasshe
away ^erely and fully the sin / that yet god by his absolute power does
forgive the: than as I said before / thou wylt compel god to execute his ab
solute power at thy pleasure / and at such time as thou have any repentance
though it be never so little a repentance / which as I said to the is con
crary to the nature of his absolute power. And yet in that case thou wylt bind
god to be in a manner in bondage / and to have less liberte and auctorite than
princes and kings have in this world: for thou know well that a prince or a
king may by his power remitte and perdone any traitor / mor derer ^rer felon
^in his realm / though he have deserved therefore to dye / (...) yet there is
no such traitor / in^rderer nor felon / that can compel that prince to
pardone him / al though that he ask him forgyuenes / but that that p^ynce may
execute his ordynary power upon him / and at his lyberte to put him to death by
y^ order of his laws / or else to ydone him of death ^ue him some other
punyshme^t for his offense / as prysonme^t or some other pain by his dyscr^yo^
/ so thy repentance may be such and so great yt god by his or^ynary power may
and will forgive the clearly both the sin ^ y^ satysfaccio^ therefore / and
it may be so small a repentance / that god will forgive the y^ sin and not
clearly expulse the out of his favor / but yet will that thou shall have a
forther punishment to make the as pure and clear as thou wast before / and so
than able to be received in to his f^ uour / and to be pertyner of his glory /
so these things co^sydered / it must follow necessarely that there must needs
be a purgatory.

A another reason for a conclusyon of this matter I shall show the (because I
can not tarry myche longer with the) if thou or any other should hold this
opinion / chat god for a little repentance had be thy for thine offenses and
sins / should so perdone and forgive the / so yt thou should not need to
make any other satysfaccyo^ or restitucyon to thy neighbor whom thou haste so
wronged / and after thy death thou should have no another punishment in
purgatory therefore: and to believe that there is no purgatory ordained therefore
/ this thing should put away y^ dread of god from the most part of the people
in the world / and give them boldness to do and commytte offenses and sins /
and if the people should believe that they never neded to make any satysfaccion /
nor restytucion to their neighbors for the wrongs that they have done to
their neighbors / and that such a light repentance should be suffycyent for
any other satys faccyon to be made / yt should give to the people such boldness
that they would never force nor care what wrongs / e^ons / theftes / roberyes^
nor morders that they did / and so in conclusyon should destroy all virtue and
increase vice and sin and also utterly destroy the comen welthe and quiet
living of the people.


^go. Thy reasons and solucyon to all my questyons and obieccions be so good
that thou have marvelous well satysfyed my mind in every thing / and yt should
seem a great meruel how thou should come to so hye learning and knowledge /
save yt I meruell much the less / because I herd the say / that thou have be
brought up some part of thy youth in crystendome / and ben a student in diverse
^rsytes in cryste^dome / where thou saydest thou dydest ierne and read ^ych
phylosophye: whereby as I said thou hastnow satysfyed my mind right well / and
that now I must nedys consent unto the that there must ned^ be a purgatory for
y^ purging of me^nes souls / after that they be separat from the body / and
also by the same last reason which thou have showed / yt proves well that yt
should be a great folyshnes for y^ people to believe the contrary thereof / that
is to say / yt there should be no purgatory / for yt folysh believe should be
marvelous hurtful to y^ people / for first as thou saydest it should bring the^
from the dread of god / which dread of god is the beginning of all wysdom. And
we know well yt y^ fraylte of mankind is such / y^ it is evermore more prone
and ready to vice tha^ to virtue: wherefore man has need to have both a brydel
of law / which is to punysh vice in this world / and also a brydell of y^ dread
of god / which is a dread to offend for y^ love of god / and a dread to be
punysshed in an other world for offense done here in this transytory life. But
if men should believe that there is no purga tory / but that immediately the
soul of man for a little small repentance taken should go straight to heaven:
yt should as thou saydest / give the^ such a boldness that many men would little
regard what hurt or wrong they did to their neighbors: and so should be the
cause to bring the people to live to geder contynually in trouble / vexacyon /
unquietness of mind and to the destruction of their own come^ wealth in this
world. It should also cause the utter loss and dampnacion in hell of many
thousand souls / be cause they would ever trust / that if they lived never so
vyciously / that yet they would or they dyed take some repentance / wherein
peraduentur^ many should be deceived. For we se by experyence / that there be
many pe ple in the world which dye suddenly / some be suddenly drowned / some
suddenly slayn^ and some dye suddenly of some other sekenes / and peradue^ ture
have no time to remember god or think of any repentance / and than if such
people that so dye have offended god and committed some great mortal sin /
for the which god by his justice must condemn him to eternal dampnacyon in
hell: this boldness of trust to take repen taunce or there dye where they be
deceived for lack of time / should ca^ many thousands of people to be eternally
dampened in hell. And an other thing yet there is to be considered / which I
have gederd upon thy re^ sons and arguments / that if a man offend and
commytte some small venyall sin / for the which god will that by his justice
he must have some punishment therefore / but yet not eternal dampnacyon / if
such a synnet dye suddenly / and before he have had any time to take any
repentaunce^ his soul as yt is prouyd by all thy foresaid argume^tys and
reasons / ought neither immedyatly to come in to y^ glorious place of heaven /
because yt is somewhat defouled with sin: nor also ought not to go to hell to
etet nall dampnacy on but by all good order of justice must go to a place to be
purged and there to be made clean / that yt may be received after that in to
the glorious place of heaven. Therefore upon these reasons which thou have showed
/ and these premysses considered / he shall be proved a very stark fool / that
will believe that there is no purgatory.


Gynge. I am very glad now that thy mind is satysfyed in this matter / and
therefore now be cause I have a little besynes to do touching y^ fete of my
marchaundyse / I will depart and bid the farewell.


Common. Now I thank the with all ^yn heart / and I shall love the while I live
/ and would to god y^ thou were of our holy sect and christian believe / and so I
will counsel the and require the to be.


Gynge. I thank you for your good counsel / but as to that request I will not
she we the my mind at this time / because I have now no time nor space / how
be yt I know well y^ Christ of whom ye christian men believe / was a very holy man
and a good and has taught you so many good lessons of virtue / yt there can be
no better / which I will ad uyse yt to obs^ and keep. And a another time
peradventure I shall mete with the again / and show to the my mind / but now I
pray y^ pardone me for I must nedys depart from the: therefore yet again I say
now farewell.


Common. well then sith thou wylt ned^ begone / I pray god give the grace yt
thou may do well / and to become one of our holy sect and believe / and I pray
god be thy gyde.


Amen

what is a body / what is a soul / and what is a man Caput iii. That it is

xviii that every man's soul is of like perfeccyon. Cap. xix. what knowledge
man's soul has after it is separate from the body / and what manner of being
yt has. Caput. xx.
The chapytres of the third dialoge.
that the soul does suffer and not the body / and that by y^ justice of god
there must be a purgatory / because that sometime man dies without making
full satysfaccyon. Caput pr^um. An obie^yo^ / because repentance is yt only
thing clearly yt wass^eth and put teth away all sin done by man / and y^ god
of his justice must than dyscharge him thereof / therefore yt needs tha^ no
another purgatory. Cap. ii. the solucion / if god should be compelled to forgive
the sin immedyatly after repentance / he should be restrained of his lyberte
/ and from the execucyon of his justice. Caput. iii. An obieccyon / because man
is ordained to have an infynyte being / there fore after his death he must have
infynyte joy or infynyte pain / and so no pain in purgatory which has an
end. Caput. iiii. the solucion / as there be degrees in syn / as some sin is
more and some less: so there be degrees in repentance / as some may be more
and some less / and also degrees of pardon and forgyuenes / therefore man for
lack of suffycyent repentance must be purged. Caput. v. An obieccion / that
because there be degrees in heaven and hell of joy and pain / that it is
nedeles for god to put any purgatory / for he may execute his full and
indyfferent justice in one of those two placys. Ca. vi. The solucyon / that as
the appell which has a vegetatyue soul / and as the best which has a
sensytyue soul / may be purged after that they be seueryd from their natural
growing and life / of such tokens and spotte which be a deformyte to the^ / so
the soul intellectyfe must be purged of those tokens and spott^ of sin /
which was a d^formyte to it. Ca. vii. An obieccion / that the soul unpurged
may do some mean and low service to god in heaven / though it be not the highest
and best service / so that it needs not to be purged. Ca. viii. The solucyon /
that nothing unpurged and vnpure may remain or abide in heaven. Cap. ix. An
obieccyon / that if there should be any place of purgatory / than that place
should be here in earth / or else if there be any other place / where is that
place of purgatory. Cap. x. The solucyon / that if god should be compelled to
make purgatory here in earth / that than god / that is the hye judge / should be
restrained from his lyberte and authoryte more than any other yerthly judge /
and also y^ it is a folysh questyon to ask where purgatory is. Cap. xi. An
obieccyon / because the mercy of god can not be without his justice / and
remissyon is ^ydent to repentance: therefore as soon as repentance is taken /
god of his justice must give re^yssyon / and therefore there ought to be no
purgatory. Cap. xii. The solucyon / if god should give full remyssyon for every
sin without other satysfaccion / tha^ god should minyster his mercy without
justice. And as a man may offend to god alone / and also to god and to his
neygh bour: therefore satysfaccyon must be made both to god and to his neygh
boure / or else his neighbor is not restored to his own. Cap xiii. An
obieccyon / that when god forgyueth it need no satysfaccyon to thy neighbor /
because god is the very owner of all / and thy neighbor has no properte but
as a servant to god / as but to make acounte to god therefore. Cap. xiiii. The
solucyon / that god has an absolute power and an ordynary power and that by
his ordynary power he can not discharge the if thy repentance be not
suffycyent. And also yt thou canste not compelle god to forgive the by his
absolute power at thy pleasure. Cap. xv.
