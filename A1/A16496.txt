A worthy Myrrour, wherein ye may mark, An excellent Discourse of a breeding
Lark:
By readyng whereof, perceive well ye may: What trust is Friends, or on
Kinsfolks ^o stay.
A LARK sometimes did breed,
within a field of Corn:
And had increase when as yt Grain
was ready to be shorn.
She wary of the time:
and careful for her nest,
Debated wisely with her self.
what thing to do were best.
For to abide the rage,
of cruel Reapers hand,
She knew it was to perilous,
with safety for to stand:
And to dislodge her Brood,
unable yet to fly:
(Not knowing whither to remove,)
great harms might hap thereby
Therefore she meant to stay,
till Force censtraynd to fleet:
And in the while for to provide,
some other place as meet.
The better to provide,
the purpose of her mind:
She would forthwith go seek abroad,
and leave her Young behind:
But first, she bad them all
attend their Mothers will,
Which careful was for to eschew
each likelihood of ill:
This Corn is ripe (quoth she,)
wherein we nestled are:
The which (if heed preuents not harms,)
may cause our mortal care.
Therefore to fence with skyll,
the sequeall of mishappes:
I will provide some other place,
for fear of afterclappes:
Whilste I for this and Food,
am flowen hence away:
With heedefull ears attentive be,
what co^mers by do say.
Thus said, she vaunste her self,
upon her longest ^oe:
And mounted up into the Skies,
still singing as she flow:
Anon she home returnde,
full fraught with choice of meat:
But lo, (a sudden change) her Birds
for fear could nothing eat.
Therewith aghast, she cried:
what how? what means this?
I charge ye on my blessyng, tell:
what thing has chaunst amiss?
Are these my welcomes home,
or thanks for Food I have?
Ye wonted were with chirping cheer,
to gape before I gave:
But now such Quawmes oppress
your former quiet kind:
That (quite tra^sformd) dumb mute things
and Senseless Souls I find:
The Prime and eldest Bird,
(thus checked) began to say,
Alas dear Dame, such news we hard,
sense ye were flowen away.
That were it ^ot the trust
that we repose in you,
Our lives were lost remediles,
we know it well ynow:
The Owner of this Plot,
came hither with his Son,
And said to him, this wheat must down
it is more then time it were don:
Go get thee to my friends,
and bid them come to morn,
And tell them that I crave their helps,
to reap a piece of Corn:
The Lark that was the Dam,
stood in a dump a while,
And after said, his Frindes (quod he)
and then began to smile.
Tush, Friends are hard to find,
true friendship se^^d appears:
A man miss to have a Friend,
that lives old NESTORS years,
True DAMON and his Friend,
long ere our time were dead:
It was in Greece, a great way hence
where such two friends were bred:
Our Country is to cold,
to foster up a Friend:
Till proof be made, each one will say,
still yours unto the end.
But try in time of need,
and all your friends are flowen,
Such fruitless Seed, such fickle stay
in faithless Friends, is sown:
Therefore be of good cheer,
revive your dulled Sprites,
Expel the Care, that causeless thus,
bereaues you of delights:
Let no surmised fear,
deprive your eyes of sleep,
My self will be amongst ye still,
that safely shall ye keep.
And swear ^eene by the Tufte,
that grows upon my Crown:
If all his help be in his Friends,
this Corn shall not go down.
The Young assured by her,
That such an Oath did swear:
Did pass the time with wonted sleep,
and banished former fear.
And when the drowsy Night,
was fled from gladsome Day:
She bad them wake and look about
for she must go her way.
And said, I warrant you,
these friends will not come here:
Yet notwithstanding, listen well,
and tell me what you hear.
Anon, the Farmer came,
enraged wellnie mad:
And swear, who so depends on friends
his case is worse then badde.
I will go set my Kin*
to help me with this gear,
In things of greater weight then this,
their kindred shall appear,
The Larkes, their Dam returned,
informed her of all,
And how, that he himself was gone,
his kindred for to call:
But when she hard of Kinn^,
she laughinge, cried amayne:
A Pin for Kin: a ^igge for Friends,
yet Kin the worste of twain.
This man him self is poor,
though wealthy Kine he have:
And kindred now a days does quail,
when need compelles to crave.
No, no: he shall return,
with ill contented myn^e:
His pains shall yeald but loss of time,
no succoure he shall find.
They all are so addicte
unto their private gain,
That if ye lack power to requite,
your Suits are all in vain.
My self am ouerchardgde,
with Harvest ye may see,
And nearer is my Skin, then Shirte,
this shall their Answer be.
Therefore, as ^ars^e of Friends,
so say I now of Kin:
We shall receive no hurt by them,
nor he no profit win.
Yet listen once again,
what now is Refuge is,
For kindred shall be like to Friends.
be well assured of this:
I must go furnish up,
a Neast I have begone:
And will return and bring ye meat,
as soon as it is don.
Then up she clam the Clouds,
with such a lusty Lay:
That it re^o^st^ her Yonglinges hearts
as in their Neast they lay:
And much they did commend,
their Mothers lofty gate,
And thought it long til time had brought
them selves to such estate.
Thus whilste their twinkelynge eyes,
were rouyng to and fro:
They saw where as the Farmer came.
that was their mortal Foe.
Who after due complaints,
Thus said in the end:
I will from henceforth trust my self,
and not to kin nor Friend.
Who geues me glosing words,
and fayles me at my need:
May in my PATER NOSTER be
but never in my CREED,
My self will have it down,
since needs it must be so,
For proof has taught me too mutch wit
to trust to any mo.
The Birds that listenyng lay,
attentive to the same:
In^ormde their Mother of the whole,
as soon as ere she came.
Ye mary then quoth she,
the case now altered is:
We will no longer hear abide,
I always feared this,
But out she got them all,
and trudged away apace,
And through the Corn she brought them safe,
into another place.
God send her luck to shun
both Hawk and Fowlers Gin,
And me the hap to have no need,
of Friends, nor yet of Kin,
FINIS.
Arthur Bour.
