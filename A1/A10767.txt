A merry new Ballad entitled the pinnyng of the Basket:
And is to be song to the tune of the down right Squire.
IT was my hap of late to hear,
a pretty ieste:
The which by me as may appear
is here expreste.
With tantara, tantara, tantara,
for this belonges thereto:
With bitter broils, and bickeryng (...),
and strife with much (...).
Mark then for now this marvel strange,
I will declare:
A Ioigner sent his man to change,
money for ware.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
unto the town he gose:
And hasted to the Chandlers shop,
his money to dispose.
But see the chance the Chandler dry,
was gone to drink:
Or else poor soul to play thereby,
at sice and sincke:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
whereat his wife did chafe:
And out she went then in a rage,
to seek her good man Rafe.
She ranged forth and could not rest,
upon the molde:
When she him found, the bedlam beast,
began to scolde:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
quoth she unthrifty knave*
If thou be at the good Ale tappe,
thou have that thou would have.
This quiet man acquainted was,
with her rough talk:
And patiently ^orth with her pass
^
Tantara, tara, tantara,
at home she found him place:
Till he had served his customer,
and then began the fraie.
For having done, hold here quoth he,
the Basket Dame:
Go gossip give it him and see,
you pin the same.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
now does the sport begin*
Know thou quoth she sir knave that I,
the Basket will not pin.
Her housebande sore insenste did swear,
by stocks and stones:
She should or else he would prepare,
to baste her bones.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
quoth he I Will tame your tongue,
And make you pin the Basket to,
doubt not ere it be long.
Then with a bastian that stood by,
which he did smell*
At her he freely did let fly,
and bumbde her well
Tantara, tara, tantara,
vnguentum Ba^^aline:
Did make this houswife ^^ickly ^,
the Basket passing (...).
This pastyme pleased well the Page,
that all this while*
Sat on his horse, and saw this rage,
and bitter broyle*
Tantara, tara, tantara.
the good wife does retire,
(...) swears she will no more deny,
her housebandes just desire.
The Basket pin, the Page departes,
when (...):
He spurs his ^^tt^, the Jade startes,
he was so fraied:
Tantara, tara, tantara*
in haste he homewarde rides,
Yet when he comes, for tariyng long,
his Master chafes and chides.
His M(...)rs too as one half mad,
began to rave*
Bec^^se too long he tarried had,
(...) (...) him knave:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
he spoke his Mistres fair:
And told her she should know the cause,
of his long tariyng there.
Then boldly he began his tale,
and told them all:
Betwixt these two, how Deaudly Ale,
had bred a braull:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
quoth he the Chandlers wife,
Would not entreated be to pin,
the Basket for his life.
Till he to beat her did begin,
with bounsyng bloose:
Then quickly she in post to pin,
the Basket goose:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
the Ioigner joys at (...),
But sure his wife to hear this tale,
was quite bereft of (...).
^,
(...) grace,
Was changed, with began to frame:
a ^^nnyng face:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
quoth she for all his bloose,
The knave the Basket should have pin,
him self spite of his nose.
Here then her housebande did begin,
quoth he if I:
Should bid you wife the Basket pin,
would you deny:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
to him she plainly told,
That she the Basket would not pin,
thereof he might be bold.
Then they hereof for to confer,
do haste to bed*
And here you see a second jar,
the Basket bredde:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
the third does now begin,
The silly Page to get some meat,
in haste does hye him in.
No whit amazed unto the maid,
(...) straight ^oeth go:
The queen of him no more afraid,
began to crow:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
(...) him knave and sot,
And used him that in the end,
a broken head he got.
Hence forht take head of making strife,
thou knave quoth she
(...) and his wife,
where (...) should be:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
with greef her words he hears:
But yet it grieved him more to feel,
the blood about his ears.
Yet up he stepped full stoutly then,
and bomde me Ione,
That she lent, he so paid again,
he made her groan.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
and getts his Supper too:
And made her sit and eat with him,
although with much a do.
His master on the morrow next,
of this was glad:
His mistres was herewith so vexte,
it made her mad.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
this hap brynges joy and care:
For now the Ioigners wife to pin,
the Basket must prepare.
Her housebande by his man's good hap,
does hope to win:
And makes her now spite of her cappe,
the Basket pin:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
again he does reply:
Will you the Basket pin or no,
she stoutly does deny.
Then with a bedstaffe he to baste,
her does begin:
Yet would she not for all his baste,
the Basket pin:
Tantara, tara, tantara,
this combat being done
^
(...) Dame does run.
And to this ioylly Justice wife,
discoueryng all:
Betwixt her spouse and her what sstrife,
(...) late befall.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
whom she would feign have bound,
Unto the peace if by the hap,
there might such means be found.
Of this her friend the francke cousent,
she sone had wone:
To do for her incontinent*
what might be done.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
this Justice wife now gose:
Her gossipps suit in haste unto,
her housebande to disclose.
Her housebande hearing by this tale,
how all things stood:
In mind he at this ieste so stale,
did laugh a good.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
a little more ado:
This Justice would have taught his wife,
to pin the Basket too.
Now all good wives beware by this,
your ^^^^es to blot,
The Basket pin with quietness:
deny it not.
Tantara, tara, tantara,
be counseled by your friend:
And of this Baskettes pinnyng now*
enough and so an end.
Finis.
