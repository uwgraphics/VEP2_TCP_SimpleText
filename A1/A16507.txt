AN ENCOVRAGEMENT TO COLONIES.
THe sending forth of Colonies (seeming a nouelty) is esteemed now to be a
strange thing, as not only being above the courage of common men, but
altogether alienated from their knowledge, which is no wonder, since that
course though both ancient, and usual, has been by the intermission of so
many ages discontinued, yea was impossible to be practiced so long as there was
no vast ground, howsoever men had been willing, whereupon Plantations might
have been made, yet there is none who will doubt but that the world in her
infancy, and innocence, was first peopled after this manner.

The next generations succeeding Shem planted in Asia, Chams in Afric, and
laphets, in Europe: Abraham and Lot were Captains of Colonies, the Land then
being as free as the Seas are now, since they parted them in every part where
they passed, not taking notice of natives without impediment. That memorable
troop of Jews which Moses led from Egypt to Cana^^ was a kind of Colonie
though miraculously conducted by God, who intended thereby to advance his
Church and to destroy the rejected Ethnikes. Salmanezer King of Ash^r was
remarked for the first who did violate the natural ingenuitie of this
commendable kind of policy by too politic an intention; for having transported
the ten Tribes of Israel, to the end that transplanting and dispersing them,
he might either weaken their strength, or abolish their memory by
incorporating of them with his other Subjects; he to prevent the dangers
incident amongst remote vassals did send a Colonie to inhabit Samaria of a
purpose thereby to secure his late and questionable conquest.

Who can imagine by this industrious course of Plantations, what an unexpected
progress from a despised beginning has been suddenly made to the height of
greatness! The Phoenicians quickly founded Sidon, and Tirus, so much renowned
both by sacred, and humane writers, and a few Tirians builded Carthage, which
had first no more ground allowed her than could be compassed by the extended
dimensions of a Bulls hide, which for acquiring of the more ground they divided
in as many sundry parts as was possible, yet in end that Town became the
Mistress of Afr^ke, and the rival of Rome: and Rome it self that great Lady
of the World, and terror to all Nations, ambitiously clayming for her first
founders a few scandalized fugitives that fled from the ruins of Troy, did
rise from small appearances to that exorbitancy of power, which at this day is
remembered with admiration; Though the walls of it at that time were very low
when the one brother did kill the other for jumping over them, either jealousy
already preuayling above natural affection, or else unadvised anger
constructing that which might have been casually or carelessly done, in a
sinistrous sense to the hateful behavior of insolency or scorn; Their number
then was not only very small, but they wanted women, without which they could
not increase, nor subsist, till they ravished the daughters of the Sabins, by a
violent match at first, portending their future rapins, and what a furious
offspring they were likely to engender. And when that haughty City began to
suffer the miseries which she had so long been accustomed to inflict upon
others, the venerable City of Venice (keeping for so many ages a spotless
reputation) was first begun by a few discouraged persons, who fleeing from
the fury of the barbarous Nations that then encroached upon Italy, were
distracted with fear and (seeking for their safety) did stumble upon a
commodious dwelling.

The Graecians were the first, at least of all the Gentiles, (who joining
learning with arms) did both do, and write that which was worthy to be
remembered; and that small parcel of ground whose greatness was then only
valued by the virtue of the inhabitants, did plant Trapizonde in the East, and
many other Cities in Asia the less, the protecting of whose liberties was the
first cause of war between them and the Persian Monarchs; then besides all
the adjacent Isles they planted Siracusa in Sicile, most part of Italy, which
made it to be called Graecia mayor, and Marseills in France. O what a strange
alteration! that this part, which did flourish thus, whilst it was possessed
by vigorous spirits, who were capable of great enterprises, did so many brave
things should now (the seat of base servile people) become the most abject and
contemptible part of all the Territories belonging to the barbarous Ottomans,
whose insolent Ianissaries (as the Pretorian Guards did with their Emperors,
and Mamalukes of Egypt with their Soldans) presume at this time to dispose of
the Regal power, vpbrayding the miserable folly of Christians, who
dangerously embarked in intestine wars, though invited by an encountering
occasion, neglect so great, so glorious, and so easy a conquest.

The Romanos coming to command a well peopled World, had no use of Colonies,
but only thereby to reward such old deserving Soldiers as (age and merit
pleading an immunitie from any further constrained travel) had bravely
exceeded the ordinary course of time appointed for military service, which
custom was used in Germany, France, Spain, and Britain, and likewise that
the Towns erected in this sort might serve for Citadels imposed upon every
conquered Province, whereof some do flourish at this day, and of others
nothing does remain but the very name only, their ruins being so ruined,
that we can hardly condescend upon what solitary part to bestow the fame of
their former being.

I am loath by disputable opinions to dig up the Tombs of them that more
extenuated then the dust are buried in oblivion and will leave these
disregarded relicts of greatness to continue as they are, the scorn of pride,
witnessing the power of time. Neither will I after the common custom of the
world, ouerualuing things past disualue the present, but considering seriously
of that which is lately done in Ireland, do find a Plantation there inferior
to none that has been heretofore. The Babylonians having conquered the
Israelites did transplant them as exposed to ruin in a remote Country,
sending others of their own Nation (that they might be utterly extirpated) to
inhabit Samvria in their places. And our King has only divided the most
seditious families of the Irish by dispersing them in sundry parts within the
Country, not to extinguish, but to dissipate their power, who now neither
have, nor give cause of fear. The Romans did build some Towns which they did
plant with their own people by all rigor to curb the Natives next adjacent
thereunto, And our King has incorporated some of his best Britains with the
Irish, planted in sundry places without power to oppress, but only to
ciuilize them by their example. Thus Ireland which heretofore was scarcely
discovered, and only irritated by others, proving to the English as the
Lowe-Countries did to Spain, a means whereby to waste their men, and their
money, is now really conquered, becoming a strength to the State, and a glory
to his Majesty's government, who has in the settling thereof excelled all that
was commended in any ancient Colonie.

As all first were encouraged to Plantations by the largeness of the conquests
that were proposed unto them, fearing only want of people, and not of land, so
in after ages when all known parts became peopled, they were quickly entangled
with the other extremity, grudging to be bounded within their prospect, and
jarring with their neighbors for small parcels of ground, a strife for limits
limiting the lives of many who entering first in controversy upon a point of
profit though with the loss of ten times more, valuing their honor by the
opinion of others behooued to proceed as engaged for the safety of their
reputation. Then richesse being acquired by industry, and glory by
employments, these two did beget avarice, and ambition, which lodging in some
subtle heads upon a politic consideration to unite intestine divisions did
transfer their spleen to foreign parts, not seeking to rectify the
affections, but to busy them abroad where least harm was feared, and most
benefit expected, so that where they had first in a peaceable sort sought for
Lands only wherewith to furnish their necessity, which conueniency, or
sufficiency, did easily accommodate, now aiming at greatness the desires of
men grown infinite, made them strangers to contentment, and enemies to rest.

Some Nations seeking to exchange for better seats, others to command their
neighbors, there was for many ages no speech but of wrongs and reuenges,
conquests and reuolts, razings and ruining of States, a continual revolution
determining the periods of Time by the miseries of mankind, and in regard of
the populousness of these ages during the Monarchies of the Assirians,
Persians, Graecians, and Romans, the world could not have subsisted if it had
not been purged of turbulent humors by letting out the blood of many
thousands, so that war was the universal Surgeon of these distempered
times: And thereafter O what monstrous multitudes of people were slain by huge
deluges of barbarous armies that ouerflowed Italy, France and Spain! and the
Christians have long been subject to the like calamities wanting a commodity
how they might (not wronging others) in a Christian manner employ the people
that were more chargeable then necessary at home, which was the cause of much
mischief among themselves, till at that time when Spain was striving with
France how to part Italy, as Italy had formerly done with Carthage how to
part Spain. Then it pleased God having pity of the Christians who for
purposes of small importance did prodigally prostitute the lives of them whom
he had purchased with so precious a ransom, as it were for diuerting that
violent kind of vanity, to discover a new world, which it would seem in all
reason should have transported them with designs of more moment, whereby glory
and profit with a guiltless labor was to be attained with less danger
whereunto they are as it were invited, and provoked with so many eminent
advantages palpably exposed to any clear judgment that I think (this obuious
facility vilifying that which a further difficulty might the more endeare) the
easiness of the prey has blunted the appetite.

When Christopher Columbus had in vain propounded this enterprise to diverse
Christian Princes, Isabella of Castile against the opinion of her husband
(though so much renowned for wit yet not reaching this mystery) did first
furnish him for a Voyage, as if it were fatal that that Nation should owe the
greatest part of their greatness to the female Sex, And if the Spaniards
would sincerely, and gratefully have bestowed the benefits whereby God did
allure them to possess this Land for the planting of it with Christians
inclined to civility, and religion, it had at this day considering the
excellency of the soil, for all the perfections that nature could afford;
been the most singularly accomplished place of the world, but it has
infortunatly fallen out far otherwise, that the treasures that are drawn
from thence (mines to blow up minds and rocks to ruin faith) do prove the
seed of dissension, the sinews of the war, and nurcerie of all the troubles
amongst Christians.

The Spaniards that were so happy as to chance first upon this new World, were
of all others (having but a vast mountainous Country) in regard of their
scarcity of people, most unfit for planting thereof, and could not but soon
have abandoned the same, if they had not so quickly encountered with the rich
Mines of Mexico, New Spain and Peru, which were once likely to have been lost
for lack of wood, till the way was invented of refining Silver by quicksiluer,
which may be easily done out of any oar that is free from Lead, and (all the
Spaniards disdayning work as a servile thing below their abilities) their
greatest trouble is the want of workmen: for the Natives that are extant,
suruiuing many vexations, if they become civil out of an indulgency to
liberty, and ease, whereunto all the Americans (liking better of a penurious
life thus then to have plenty with taking pains) are naturally inclined, that
they may have a secure ease warranted by an order, do betake themselves to
Cloisters, so that they have no means to prosecute these works but by drawing
yearly a great number of Negroes from Angola, and other parts, which being but
an unnatural merchandise, are bought at a dear rate, and maintained with
danger, for they once of late, as I have heard from one that was there at that
time designed to murder their Masters, by a plot which should have been put
in execution upon a Good Friday, when all being exercised at their devotion
were least apt to apprehend such a wicked course, and it is always feared that
to revenge what of necessity they must suffer, and to procure their liberty
hating most what they feel for the present, and hoping for better by a change,
they will join with any strong enemy that landing there dare attempt the
conquest of that Country.

I will not here insist in setting down the manner how the Spaniards made
themselves Masters of so many rich and pleasant Countries, but do leave that
to their own Histories, though I confess (like wisemen) they are very sparing
to report the estate of these parts, and do bar all strangers from having
access thereunto, wishing to enjoy that which they love in private, and not
inconsiderately vanting by the vanity of praises to procure unto themselves
the vexation that they might suffer by the earnest pursuit of emulating riuals,
but as they did bravely begin, and resolutely prosecute their Discoueries in
America, so has it justly recompensed their courage, proving the ground of all
that greatness which at this time (not without cause) does make them (as able,
or willing, to conquer others if not both) so much suspected by every jealous
State. And Henry the Seventh the Solomon of England had his judgment only
condemned for neglecting that good occasion which was first offered unto him by
Columbus, yet did he presently seek to repair his error by sending forth
Sebastian Chabot a Venetian who did discover the I Will of Newfound-land, and this
part of the Continent of America now intended to be planted by his Majesty's
Subjects under the name of New England, and New Scotland, so that the fruits of
his happy reign still growing to a greater perfection and now ripe to be
gathered by this age, as he made way by the marriage of his eldest daughter for
uniting these two Nations at home, so did he the same likewise by this
discovery abroad, but the accomplishment of both was reserved for his Majesty
now reigning, and no Prince in the world may more easily effectuate such a
purpose since his Dominions afford abundance of brave men singularly valued
for able bodies and active spirits whereof the English have already given good
proof of their sufficiency in foreign Plantations; but before I proceed
further in that which does concern them I must observe what the French have
done in this kind.

All such aduentrous designs out of ignorance, or envy (either contemned, or
doubtfully ce^sured) are never approved, nor imitated, til they be justified by
the success, and then many who had first been too distrustful falling in the
other extremity of an implicit confidence, to redeem their former neglects,
do precipitate themselves in needless dangers. After that the Spaniards were
known to prosper, and that it was conceived by the Voyage of Chabot what a
large vastness this new Continent was likely to prove, Francis the first did
furnish forth John Verrizzon a Florentine, who did discover that part of
America which was first (and most justly) called New France, and now Terra
Florida. And upon his return he affirming it to be (as it is indeed for all
the excellencies of nature) one of the most pleasant parts of the world, This
was the cause that after a long delay (during the space of two Princes whole
reigns) some new Discoueries reviving the memory of this, in the year of God
1562. Charles the ninth (having a haughty mind, and being so ravished with a
desire of glory, that he was sometimes tempted by sinistrous suggestions in
seeking after it to go upon wrong grounds) was quickly enamoured with the
eminency of such a singular design, wherein he did employ John Riba^t, who
coming to Florida, was kindly received by the Natives there, and having made
choice of a place where to build a Fort, after he had stayed a time giving
direction for such things as were necessary to be done, he left forty men
therein when he came away with one Captain Albert to command them, who after
that he had with difficulty been freed from the danger of famine, and of fire
(unseasonably affecting the disused austeritie of the Ancients) did for a small
offense hang one of his company with his own hands, so losing both the
dignity of his place, and the hearts of his people at one time, which he
should have been extremely studious to preserve, esteeming them as fellows of
his sufferings, and coheires of his hopes, at least the quality of the offense
and necessity of his death should have been made so clear, that as importing
a common good, all (if not urging it) should at least have condiscended
thereunto, but this error of his was acquitted in as rude a manner: for his
company putting him to death did make choice of another Captain, and
despairing of a new supply though wanting skillful workmen for such a purpose
(necessity sharpning their wits) they builded a little Barque which they
calfatted and made fit for the Seas with the Gummes of trees which they found
there in stead of Pitch, and in place of Sails they furnished her with such
linnens as they had upon their beds, and being thus set forth (courageously
ouercomming a number of admirable difficulties) did return to France after a
desperate manner.

The dangerlesse return, and plausible hopes of Ribaut, assisted by the
serious persuasions of the Admiral, (the received opinion of whose not
questioned wisdom was enough to warrant any thing that had his approbation)
did move the French King to send out a great number of men with a competent
provision of all things requisite under the charge of Monsieur Laudonier, who
had a prosperous Voyage, and a congratulated arrival at the French Fort by the
Savages in Florida, but immediately thereafter he was extremely perplexed with
the unexpected, mutinies and factious offers of some whom he had carried with
him, who had not gone thither intending what they pretended, out of a clear
resolution to inhabit that bounds, but did only flee from some inconveniences
that had vexed them at home, such men as hating labor they could not
industriously serve by their endeauours in a mechanike trade, so were they not
capable of generous inspirations that provoke magnanimity, but habitually bred
to vice were naturally enemies to virtue, which made thirty of them taking
away a Bark that belonged to the Plantation betake themselves to the Seas in
hope (continuing as they had been accustomed in naughty courses) to seize upon
a prize whereby they might incontinent be made rich; and their design in some
measure had the projected issue, but in place of raising their fortunes (the
Lord never blessing them that abandon such a worthy work, much less with a
mind to do mischief) it proved in end away to work their confusion, And
Laudoniere being happy to have his company purged of such pestiferous
fellows did carry himself bravely as became a commander, advisedly enquiring
concerning the Savages, what their force was, what relation they had one to
another, where they were friends or foes, how their pleasures were placed, and
by what accounts they reckoned their gains or losses, so that he was always
ready as might stand best with the good of his affairs to assist, or oppose,
to divide, or agree any party, thus by showing power purchasing authority,
til he drew the balance of all business to be swayed where he would as
being Master of the Country. Hereupon (the vmbragious aspersions of envy so
darkening reason that it could not discern merit at least out of a depraved
opinion with a derogatory censure cancelling all natural ingenuitie, could not
or would not acknowledge what was due thereunto) a report was spread in France
by some that Laudoniere lived like a Prince disdayning the condition of a
Subject, and the French out of a preposterous policy fearing what they should
have wished that one of their own Nation could be too great abroad, they sent
back Ribaut with a new commission to succeed him in his charge, (shaking
thereby the first foundation of a growing greatness) who seeking to steal
privately upon him to prevent aduertisements that he might take him at
unawares did hardly escape to have been sunk at his first entry.

Immediately after that Ribaut was admitted Governor (Laudoniere having showed
himself as dutiful to obey as he had been skillful in commanding)
intelligence was given them that six Spanish Ships were riding at an anchor
not far from thence, and he ambitiously aspiring to grace his beginning with
some great matter against the advice of all the rest with an obstinate
resolution would needs go and pursue them taking the best of the company with
him, and so left the Fort weakly guarded, which made it to prove an easy prey
for the Spaniards of whom the most part leaving their Ships (a mind
transported with hope not thinking of pain) did march through the woods whence
no peril was expected, and in a marvelous stormy night, as if the very
Heavens (accessarily culpable) had conspired with the malice of men for the
working of mischief. When the Frenchmen (too much affecting their own ease)
had neglected their watch, surprising their Fort did put them all to the sword,
which extreme cruelty of theirs was bravely revenged by one Captain Gorgues a
Gentleman of Bordeaux, who out of a generous disposition being sensible of this
public injury whereby all his Nation was interested, as if it had only in
particular imported the ruin of his own fortunes, went of purpose to this
part, and secretly before his coming was known contracting a great friendship
with the Savages who did hate the austere countenance, and rigorous government
of the Spaniards, when it came to be compared with the insinuating forms of
the French, he found the means by a stratagem that he used to entrap the
Spaniards, by the death of them all expiating that which they had made his
Countrymen formerly to suffer, yet after the manner of many being more apt to
acquire then to preserve (acting greater things when carried with the
impetuositie of a present fury then he could confirm with the constant
progress of a well settled resolution) he made no more use of his victory, but
returned back to France, flattering himself with the hope of a triumphall
welcome, in place whereof by some means made Court he was proclaimed a Rebel,
as a sacrifice appointed to appease Spain. This was the last thing that the
French did in Florida.

The next foreign adventure was likewise procured by the Admiral, a worthy
man, who would gladly have diuer ed the vindictiue dispositions of his
Countrymen from the bloody civil wars wherewith they were then entangled, to
prosecute some brave enterprise abroad whereby they might not be made guilty,
and yet have glory, The man that did offer himself for Conductor of the
Voyage was one Villegagnon a Knight of Malta who then pretended to be of the
reformed religion (as all do who affect to appear what they are not indeed)
making show of extraordinary remorse, and zeal, and that he had a desire to
retire himself from the vanity, corruption, and vexation of their parts to
some remote place in America, where professing himself such as he was, he
might (free from all kind of impediments) begin a new life, and where he hoped
to found such a Colony as should serve for a retreat to all those of the
reformed Religion who (weary of the persecutions at home) would go where they
might live with safety, and enjoy the liberty of their conscience, by this
means he got a great number to accompany him, amongst whom was John de Lerie
their Minister, a learned man who wrote a discourse of all that passed in this
Voyage, and there were sundry others that came from the Town of Geneua, so
that having a reasonable number and well provided, he embarked and sailed
toward Brasile, making choice of a place fit for a Plantation, where they
found (the soil excellent, the Natives well inclined toward them, and a
supply coming in due time) all things so concurring for their contentment
that they might have begun a great work happy and hopeful for their
posterity, if Uillagagnon had been the man that he made them believe he was,
but he apparently never loving them of the Religion in his heart had
counterfeited to do so for a time, only (angling their affections) by this
means to draw a supply from them; for as soon as he was settled in his
government, that he found himself strong enough by Catholics, and others of
his friends that he had with him to do (as he thought) what he would,
straight, removing the mask that hypocrisy had put upon him, he discharged
all exercise of the reformed religion which no man with more feruency had
professed then himself, commanding all to conform themselves to the orders
that he had set down, but (in place of fear which he purposed to give,
receiving but contempt) this base kind of carriage did quite overthrow his
authority, and they making a party amongst themselves did remove with their
Minister John de Lerie, which division of their Colonie in two was the cause
that neither could subsist, so that Villagagnon abandoning that Country, all
after many several designs returned unto France, having found no impediment
to so good a purpose but the perverseness of such minds as they had carried
with them.

Monsieur De Lara^erdier a very worthy Gentleman did of late enterprise the
like course in the same bounds, and was crossed in the same manner by the
difference of Religion (disputations quickening them to contrauert who will not
be converted) that distracted his company with several opinions, yet at this
time a long continuance making that less strange amongst the French then it
was wont to be, the Gentleman did command with such judgment, and discretion,
that what ever private dislike was, it never bursted forth in any open
insurrection. And for the space of four or five years being befriended by the
Natives, though continually opposed both by the Spaniards, and by the
Portugals, yet he always prevailed, living (as himself told me) with more
contentment then ever he had done in his time either before or since; he could
never discern any Winter there by the effects, seeing no stormy weather at
all, and finding a continual greenness to beautify the fields, which did
afford such abundance, and variety of all things necessary for the
maintaynance, that they were never in any danger of famine, but in end finding
no more people coming from France, and fearing that time should wear away
them that were with him; then being flattered with the love of his native
soil, longing to see his friends, and tempted by the hope of a present gain,
which as he imagined might the better enable him for some such purpose in an
other part, he capitulated with the Spaniards to surre^der the place having
assurace given him for a great sum of money which should have been delivered
in Spain, but coming to receive the same (it being more easy to pay debt by
revenging a pretended injury then with money which some would rather keep
then their Faith) he was cast in prison, where he remained long, till at last
he was delivered by the mediation of our Kings Ambassador, and came here where
I spoke with him of purpose to give his Majesty thanks. I hear that for the
present he is now at Rochell (with a hope to repair his error) ready to
embarque for some such like enterprise. This is all that the Frenchmen have
done in the South parts of America, and now I will make mention of their
proceedings in these parts that are next unto us.

Francis the first of France a brave Prince, and naturally given to great
things, after the Voyage made by John Verrizan (Chabot having discovered the
Continent for Henry the seventh) did send forth James Quartier one of Saint
Malo, who by two several Voyages did discover the River of Cannada, and by his
relation does commend it exceedingly as being fertile in variety of Fishes, and
bordered with many pleasant meadows, and stately woods, having in sundry parts
abundance of Vines growing wild, chiefly in one I Will which he has called by
the name of the I Will of Orleans. This man never made any Plantation at all, but
only discovered and traffiqued with the Savages, neither was there any further
done by Roberwall, who did live one Winter at Cape Breton.

The Marquess De la Roche by a Commission from Henry the fourth, intending a
Voyage for Cannada, happened by the way upon the I Will of Sablon (which is now
comprehended within the Patent of New Scotland) and there (trusting to the
strength of the place where there are no Savages at all) landed some of his men
till he should have found a convenient place within the maine Land fit for
habitation, promising then to return for them; but it was his fortune by
reason of contrary winds never to find the maine Land, being blown back to
France without seeing of them, where he was in the time of the civil wars
(such is the uncertainty of worldly things producing unexpected effects) taken
prisoner by the Duke of Mercoeur, and shortly after died, so that his people
whom he had left at Sablon furnished but for a short time had quickly spent
their provisions, and took for their maintaynance only such things as the
place it self did without labor freely afford, which has a race of Kowes
(as is thought) first transported thither by the Portugals that have long
continued there, and sundry roots fit to be eaten, with abundance of Fishes,
Foul and Venison. And (having no means to live but by sport) as for their
apparel they clothed themselves with the skins of such creatures as they
could kill by Land, or Sea, so that living there for the space of twelve years
when they were presented to Henry the fourth who had hired a Fisherman to bring
them home, as I have heard from them that did see them at first before the
King, they were in very good health, and looked as well, as if they had lived
all that time in France: But having been abused by the Fisherman who
(cunningly concealing that he had been directed by the King) did bargain with
them to have all their skins for transporting them home, which were of great
value, some of them being of black Foxes, which were sold at fifty pounds
sterling a piece, and above, for the recovery thereof they intended a process
against him before the Court of Parliament at Paris, wherein by the equity of
their cause or by the compassion of the Judges, they prevailed, gayning by that
means a stock wherewith to traffic in these parts again.

Monsieur De Montes procuring a Patent from Henry the fourth of Cannada from
the 40. degree Eastward comprehending all the bounds that is now both within
New England and New Scotland (after that Queen Elizabeth had formerly given
one thereof as belonging to this Crown by Chabots Discovery) did set forth
with a hundred persons fitted for a Plantation, carried in two ships of small
burden, which parting from France on several days did appoint their meeting
at the Port of Campseau, but the ship wherein Monsieur De Montes had placed
himself going first, and fearing the huge Mountains of Ice that dissoluing
from the far Northern parts come along the coast of Newfound-land during
the Spring time, did take her course more to the South, and arrived at Port De
Muton a Bay now in the fore-land of New Scotland, from whence one of the
Natives of the Country (either out of courtesy, or to gain a reward) leaving
his Wife and Children (as a pledge, or else to be nourished with them) went to
Campseau, and within a week brought them news from their other Ship that had
arrived there, which coming to them, and Monsieur Champlein who had gone in a
shallop to discover the coast being returned, they sailed together Westwards to
Cape Sable, and from thence Northwards to Bay Saint Mary's, where toward the
South side thereof they found good meadows and arable ground fit to be planted
upon, and toward the North a mountainous and mineral bounds, having
discovered one vein of metal that did hold Silver, and two of Iron stone:
After this, having seen Port Royal, they went to the River called by them
Sante Croix, but more fit now to be called Tweed, because it does divide New
England and New Scotland, bounding the one of them upon the East, and the other
upon the Westside thereof, here they made choice of an I Will that is within the
middle of the same where to winter, building houses sufficient to lodge their
number; There, besides other sorts of wood, they had store of Cedar trees, and
found the ground very fertile as it did prove afterward, bringing forth that
which they did sow with an extraordinary increase, yet during the Winter time
when they could not conveniently go to the maine Land, they found it a very
incommodious dwelling, specially for want of fresh Springs; And the soil being
of it self humid, and obnoxious to waters, they had not been so industrious
as to cast a ditch wherewith to dry the ground whereupon their houses stood,
and in end finding that a little I Will was but a kind of large prison, they
resolved to return unto Port Royal, whereof I will give a particular
Description, because it was the place of their residence, as I intend it to be
for the chief Colonie of the Scottish Nation, grounding that which I am to
deliver upon such Discourses as the Frenchmen have written, and upon that which
I have heard reported by sundry others who have seen the same.

The entry in Port Royal is from the South side of a great Bay, which does
make the South part of New Scotland almost an I Will, and has the passage at
first so narrow, with a current so violent, that Ships can hardly enter if they
take not the Tide right, and may easily be commanded by any Ordnance that is
planted on either side, where there are parts fit for that purpose; As soon as
they are within the Bay, it does enlarge itself to the breadth of seven or eight
miles, and does continue so as if it were square for the like bounds in length;
There are within the same two Isles every one of them extending itself about
three miles in circuit, and both are well garnished with trees, and grass;
Diverse Rivers and Brooks do fall within this large bosom on every side, of
which the chief is one that does come from the South, being discovered to be
above forty miles portatiue, and it has all along on every side for the
bounds of a mile, or half a mile at least, very fair meadows which are
subject to be ouerflowed at high tides, and there is Land fit to be labored
lying between them and the woods, which do compass all about with very fair
trees of sundry sorts, as Oaks, Ash, Playnes, Maple, Beech, Birch, Cypress,
Pinc and Fur; The great River does abound exceedingly in Salmon and Smelts
during their season, and every little Brook in Trouts. One Lake within this
Bay has yearly a great quantity of Herrings, which by reason of a strict way
which they pass are easy to be taken, and all the year over they never want
shellfish, such as Lobsters, Crabs, Cockles and Mussels. The chief beasts that
inhabit the Woods there, are Ellans, Heart, Hind, and fallow Dear, with store
of other wild beasts, such as Wolves, Bears, Foxes, and Otters, but the most
useful of all is the Beauer, both for his flesh that is esteemed to be very
delicate for eating, and for the skin that is of good value; as for wild
foul, there is great variety and store, of Partridges, Plouers, Woodcockes,
Larkes, Wild Geese, Wild Duckes, Heron and Crane, with many other sorts
peculiar to that part of the World, and not known here.

Upon the East side of this Port the French did entrench themselves, building
such houses as might serve to accommodate their number, and a little from
thence Monsieur Champlein did cut a walk through the Woods, where they
delighted to repair in Summer to shroud themselves from the heat, and the
rather that they had a sweet Melody which was made by the variety of voices,
of singing Birds which without any affectation did afford them natural
Music.

Some six miles further up that side of the River they built a Barn, and
labored ground for Wheat; over against which they made a Water-mill upon a
River, that does fall in on the West side, the Damme of it being there where
the Herrings haunt most, and they did likewise try some ground near by for
Wheat, whereas their own Writers make mention, they reaped above forty for
one, but what they did was rather trying the nature of the soil to satisfy
their curiosity then to have a qantitie fit for their maintenance, which they
trusted to be sent unto them by two Merchants from the Rochell, and were that
way well furnished so long as they kept their skins to give them in
exchange (but the Merchants either by some private conueyances) or by the
coming in of some Flemmings to traffic, being disappointed by the Planters
as soon as they missed their present Commodity did likewise frustrate them of
the provisions that they expected. Whereupon Monsieur de Montes betaking
himself to trade for Furs. Monsieur Poutrincourt resolved to prosecute the
Plantation at that place, and sent for his Son Biencourt to France, to bargain
with some that would send them a supply, such as was requisite for establishing
of that Colony.

The first that embraced his Propositions were the Jesuits who as they have
ordinarily good wits which made them the rather capable of so aduantagious a
project, so they were the more animated thereunto (by vpbrayding the laziness
of our Clergy) to show with what feruencie they travel to propagate the
Gospel in doing whereof (whither it be ambition or devotion that prouokes them
sparing no pains) they have traveled both to the East and West Indies, and to
that admired Kingdom of China; their Society in France preuayling with all
that had any inclination either to religion, or to virtue did easily gather a
voluntary contribution for the furthering of so commendable a purpose,
thereafter they sent away two Fathers of their company with a new supply of all
things necessary to the Plantation at Port Royal, but shortly after their
arrival (their predominant disposition hardly yielding to any Superior,
specially if it be a Secular power) they bebeganne to contradict Poutrincourt,
in the execution of these Decrees which had been given forth by him as Civil
Magistrate of that place. Whereupon the Gentleman extremely discontented, and
weary of contesting with them, having said that it was his part to rule them
upon earth, and theirs only to guide him the way to Heaven, he returned back
to France, leaving his Son Biencourt in his place, who being a youth at that
time of more courage then circumspectnesse, disdayning to be controlled by them
whom he had invited thither, and scorning their insupportable presumption, and
imperious kind of carriage, using Spiritual Arms for Temporal ends, whose
spleen had excommunicated and branded him with a Spiritual censure, he
threatened them by his Temporal power with a more palpable punishment, so that
after much controversy, resolving to separate themselves, the two Jesuits
taking a part of the company with them, went from thence to a place in New
England, called by them Mount Desert, where they seated themselves, and having
a supply from the Queen Mother, did plant sundry fruit trees of the most
delicate kinds in France, such as Apricockes and Peaches never intending to
remove from thence.

At this time Sir Samuel Argall, who has been Governor of Virginia,
coasting along New England, to traffic, discover, or to acquire things
necessary for the Southern Colonie in these parts, where the Lands are reputed
to be more fertile, and the Seas more frequented, did conceive by a description
made unto him by the Savages, that there were some come from this part of the
World to inhabit there, and being jealous of any thing that might derogate from
the honor, or prove prejudicial to the benefit of his Nation, whereof their
interest in this was easy to be apprehended, he went whereas he was informed
that they were, and his unexpected arrival, as it would seem, not only
amazing the minds of the French, but likewise preventing their preparation,
and resolution, he approached so near to a ship that lay before their Fort,
that he beat them all that were within, with Musket shot, from making any use
of their Ordnance, and killed one of the two Jesuits, who was giving fire to a
Piece; having taken the ship he landed and went before the Fort, summoning them
that were within to yield themselves, who at the first made some difficulty,
asking a time to advise, but that being refused, they privately abandoned the
Fort, stealing out by some back way into the Woods, where they stayed one
night, and the next day coming back rendered themselves, giving up the Patent
they had from the French King to be cancelled, he used them courteously, as
their own Writers do make mention, suffering such as had a mind to go for
France, to seek out fishers ships wherein they might be transported, the rest
that were willing to go for Virginia, went thither along with him, no man
having lost his life, but only that one Jesuit who was killed whilst they
made resistance during the time of the conflict, thereafter Father Biard the
other of the Jesuits coming back from Uirginia, with Sir Samuel Argall, out
of the indigestable malice that he had conceived against Biencourt, did inform
him where he had planted himself offering (as he did) to conduct him thither.
As soon as they were entered within the Port, near the uppermost of the
Islands, Sir Samuel directing the ship to ride at a reasonable distance to
attend occasions before the Fort, did land himself with forty of the best of
his men upon a Meadow, where immediately they heard a Piece of Ordnance from the
Fort, and he conceiving since it was shot whilst it could do no harm that it
was done either but to give terror to them, or to warn some that might happen
to be abroad, Did make the greater haste toward the Fort, where he
presently entered, finding it abandoned without any men at all, left for the
defense thereof, he went up the River side five or six miles, where he saw
their Barnes and the ground where a great quantity of Wheat had grown, which
he carried with him to serve for Seed in Virginia, he saw likewise their Corn
Mill very conveniently placed, which together with the Barnes he left standing
untouched. As for the Fort it self he destroyed it down to the ground, razing
the French Arms, and leaving no monument remaining, that might witness their
being there.

After this Biencourt who had been some where abroad traveling through the
Country, coming home desired to confer with Sir Samuel Argall, who did
meet with him apart from the Company upon a Meadow, and after they had
expostulated a space for what had past controuerting concerning the French and
English Title to these bounds, at last Biencourt offered (if he might have a
protection) to depend upon our King, and to draw the whole Furs of that
Country to one Port, where he would divide them with him, As likewise he would
show him good Metalls, whereof he gave him pieces, but the other refused to
join in any society with him, protesting that his Commission was only to
displant him, and that if he found him there, after that time he would use
him as an enemy. Biencourt laboring earnestly to have had the Jesuit (as he
confessed) with a purpose to hang him. Whilst they were discoursing together,
one of the Savages came suddenly forth from the Woods, and licentiated to come
near, did after his manner earnestly mediate a peace, wondering why they that
seemed to be of one Country should use others with such hostility, and that
with such a form of habit and gesture as made them both to laugh.

After this Biencourt remoouing from thence to some other part, Monsieur
Champlein who had lived long here, did carry a company with him from France,
of some forty persons or thereabouts up the River of Canada, whom he planted
on the North side thereof, with a purpose to serve for a Factorie, drawing all
the Trade of that far running River (which a Plantation would have dispersed
in many parts) within the hands of a few whom he does command otherwise if his
desires had been bended that way, he might have planted many people there ere
now, the place is called K^beck, where the French do prosper well, having
Corn by their own labor, which may furnish themselves for food, and likewise
for a stock to traffic with the Savages, with sundry Fruits, Roots, Vine,
Grapes and Turkey Wheat. Champlein has discovered the River of Canada, from
the Gulf upwards above twelve hundred miles, finding in it sometimes such
falls, as to escape the same, he must carry his Boat a little way by Land,
and then he did many times come to great Lakes at the end whereof he did
always find a River again, and the last Lake where he came was a very huge
one, judged to be three hundred miles in length, by the report of some
Savages, who did affirm unto him, that at the further end thereof they did
find Salt Water, and that they had seen great Vessels which made Champlein
believe that a passage might be there to the Bay of California, or to some part
of the South Sea, which would prove an inestimable benefit for the Inhabitants
of those parts, opening a near way to China, which has been so many sundry
ways with so great charges so long sought-for, howsoever in regard of the
season, and for want of necessary provisions, Champlein did return back at
that time with a purpose to go again another year, which if he has done is
not yet known, but this is most certain, that the River of Canada has a long
course and through many goodly Countries, some of these great Lakes by sending
forth, or by receiving great Rivers, do afford means of commerce as far as
to some parts of Terra Florida, as may be gathered by Champleins Discovery.
And now having given a breuiarie of all that is done by the French in America,
I will next report of that which has been done by some others.

I will not here make mention of the many and brave Voyages that at the Sea
have happily been performed by the English, which fame by eternal records
has recommended to be applauded by the best judgments of every age, but I
will only shortly touch that which they have attempted by way of Plantation,
beginning with the Newfound Land which was first discovered, and does lie
nearest to this Country. Sir Humfrey Gilbert having a Commission from Queen
Elizabeth did take possession of it in her name at Saint John's Harbor, and
thereafter purposed to have seen Canada, but encountering with some unexpected
crosses as he was returning from thence, seeking to condemn an opinion
(malice or envy ordinarily taxing all aspiring spirits whose virtue by way of
reflection does vpbraide the baseness of others) that had been conceived of
him as wanting courage, he precipitated himself upon an other extremity, not
to seem fearful, proving desperate; for in the tune of a storm, out of a
needless bravery, to show a contempt of danger, being in a little small
Pinnace, and refusing to come to his best Ship that was of a large burden,
he was suddenly swallowed up by the waves near to the I Will of Sablon, and his
death did overthrow great hopes of a Plantation that by the generousnesse of
his mind might justly have been expected from him, but long before his time
and ever since the English had used to fish upon the Bank, and within the
Bays of Newfound Land, and the sweetness of the benefit ar^ising from thence,
did persuade a company composed of Lond^^ers and West-country men to join
together for sending some to inhabit there, where before howsoever the Summer
was large as hot as here, the Winter was thought insufferable.

The first houses for a habitation were built in Cupids Coue within the Bay of
Conception, where people did dwell for sundry years together, and some well
satisfied both for pleasure, and profit, are dwelling there still, finding
small difference between the seasons of the year in that Climate, and here.
There is another Plantation begun at Harbor a Grace within the same Bay by
the City of Bristoll, called Bristols Hope, whereas by the sowing and rea^ing
of some Corns of sundry sorts does appear what further may possibly be
expected, And within these three years Master Secretary Caluert has planted a
company at Ferriland, who both for building and making trial of the ground
have done more then ever was performed before by any in so short a time, having
already there a brood of Horses, Kowes, and other beastial, and by the industry
of his people he is beginning to draw back yearly some benefit from thence
already: which course howsoever at first it prove good, or bad for his
particular, is by example beneficial for the public.

Last, I hear that my Lord Vicount Falkland now Lord Deputy of Ireland, has
this last year sent a company to inhabit at Reno^e a place lying South-west
from Ferriland, where the soil is esteemed to be the best whereupon any has
settled there as yet, and he has the shortest way, and best opportunity of
any within his Majesty's Dominions for transporting of people and cattle to
that part from Ireland, which if his course be rightly directed, as all have
reason to wish, may promise him a good success.

The first Patentees for Newfound-land have given me a grant of that part
thereof which does lie North-west from the Bay of Placentia to the great Gulf
of Canada oueragainst New Scotland, where I had made a Plantation ere now, if I
had not been diuerted by my designs for New Scotland, but I purpose to do it
as soon as conveniently I may. The most part of the bounds whereupon any has
planted as yet in Newfound Land is found to be rockie and not fit to be
manured: it may be these that made choice thereof (neglecting the Land) had
only a regard to dwell commodiously for making use of the Sea, the present
profits whereof does recompense the loss of that which might be expected by
the other, but there can be no hope of any constant dwelling where the people
that inhabit do not take a course to maintain themselves by their own
Corns, and pasture, as all there might do, if they would respect their
posterity more then the present time.

Before I come to the Continent I must remember the Isles of the Bermudas, whose
Discovery and Plantation was procured by so strange a means, for a Ship
happening to perish upon their Coast, her passingers seeking the next Land for
a refuge, they were compelled to do that out of necessity whereunto in good
reason, both for honor and profit, they might more warrantably have been
invited; Thus does benefit flow from loss, safety from ruin, and the
Plantation of a Land from the desolation of a Ship: they found at the first
store of Hogs, which in all appearance had their beginning from some such an
accident as theirs was, and the Fowls were there in abundance so easy to be
taken that they could scarcely be frighted away, these first people by
repairing of their Ship which was cast away upon the Land, or by building some
other Vessel out of her ruins, coming back to England, and reporting what
was past, some joined together in a company after they had taken a Patent
thereof from the King, and did send people of purpose to inhabit there, who
trusting too much to the goodness of the soil, and neglecting their own
industry, or not governing that well which was carried with them, were reduced
to a great distress for want of victuals, so that, if they had not been
confined within an Island (more sensible of a present suffering then capable of
future hopes) they would willingly have retired from thence, but a great
quantity of Ambergreece having been found by one by chance, and sent back in
a Ship that was going for London, their Merchants finding it to be of a great
value, were so encouraged by such a substantial argument, that they presently
dispatched away a new supply of persons and all provisions necessary, who
arriving there, and having considered what a gulf of famine was likely to have
swallowed their fellows, they improuing their judgment by the others
experience, by betaking themselves to labor in time did prevent the like
inconvenience; there is no Land where men can live without labor, nor none so
barren whence industry cannot draw some benefit, All Adams posterity were
appointed to work for their food, and none must dream of an absolute ease,
which can no where subsist positiuely, but only comparatively, according to
the occasions more or less.

This Plantation of the Bermudas, a place not known when the King came to
England, has prospered so in a shore time, that at this present, besides their
ordinary (and too extraordinarily valued) commodity of Tobacco, they have
growing there Oranges, Figs, and all kind of fruits that they please to plant,
and do now intend to have a Sugar work. These Isles being about twenty miles
in breadth can only be entered into but by one passage, which is fortified and
easily commanded by Ordnance, so that, having no Savages within, and fearing no
forces without, it is esteemed to be impregnable; and the number of the
Inhabitants there, being near three thousand persons, are sufficient for the
ground that they possess, This part may prove exceedingly steadable to this
State, if ever it happen to have (as it has heretofore had) any designs for
service in these Seas.

The first Plantation that ever the English intended abroad was in Uirginia,
which was first discovered and named so by Sir Walter Raleigh, who in the time
of Queen Elizabeth did place some persons to inhabit there, who not being
supplied in time, or out of ignorance, or laziness, not using the ordinary
means (the usual fault of all beginners) were brought by famine to a great
extremity. And Sir Francis Drakes coming by chance that way did transport them
back with him to England, whilst at the same time there was another company
furnished forth by Sir Walter Raleigh, who missing them whom they expected to
have found there, did remain still themselves; but what did become of them, if
they did remove to some other part, perish, disperse, or incorporate with the
Savages (no monument of them remaining) is altogether unknown; This noble
work having so hard a beginning after a long discontinuance was revived again
in the Kings time by a company composed of Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Merchants,
who (joining private purses with public supplies) did send thither a
sufficient Colonie, well furnished with all things necessary, who after their
first coming had a continual war with the Natives, till it was reconciled
by a Marriage of their Kings sister with one of the Colonie, who having come to
England, as she was returning back, died, and was buried at Grauesend. Thus
even amongst these Savages (liberty being valued above life) as they were
induced to contest in time, before that power which they suspected, could come
to such a height, that it might have a possibility of depressing them, so was
their malice with their fears, quickly calmed by the means of a marriage;
Lawful allyances thus by admitting equality remove contempt, and give a
promiscuous offspring extinguishing the distinction of persons, which if that
People become Christians, were in some sort tolerable, for it is the only
course that uniting minds, free from jealousies, can first make strangers
confide in a new friendship, which by communicating their blood with mutual
assurance is left hereditary to their posterity.

This longed for peace, though it bred a great contentment for the time, was
attended by wrapping them that apprehended no further danger (too common an
inconvenient) up in the lazy remissness of improuident security. For a
number leaving the seat of the main Colonie, did disperse themselves to live
apart, as if they had bin into a well inhabited Country, which (as perchance)
it had emboldened the Savages to embrace the first occasion of a quarrel, so
did it give them an easy way for executing the mischief that they intended,
by killing two or three hundred persons before they could aduertize one
another, far less, join to oppose them in a company together, which course
might not only then have made them able to resist, but preventing the others
resolution had kept them from being pursued: yet I hear of late, that they
have revenged this injury (though (as some report) not after a commendable
manner) by killing their King, with a great number of the chief of them whom
they suspected most.

This Plantation of Uirginia, if it had not been crossed by the Incursion of
the Savages abroad, and by the division of their Owners at home, had attained
to a great perfection ere now, having had Inhabitants from hence to the number
of near three thousand persons, and if some of them who are there, being Lords
of reasonable proportions of ground, and having people of their own, owing
nothing but due obedience to a Superior Power, and the leading of a life
conform to the Laws, had no care but (making their Lands to maintain
themselves) how to build, plant, and plenish in such sort as might best
establish a fortune for their Posterity, they might quickly make up a new
Nation, but it is a great discouragement unto them who dwell there, that they
must labor like the Servants of a Family, purchasing their food and raiment
from England, in exchange of Tobacco, as they are directed by their Masters,
many whereof are strangers to the estate of that bounds, and intending to
settle none of their Race there, have no care but how the best benefit may
presently be drawn back from thence, the number of voices at their
assemblies preuayling more then the soundness of judgment, otherwise that
Country before this time for Wine, Oil, Wheat, and other things necessary
for the life of man might have equalled for the like quantity any bounds
within Europe, to which the soil of it self lacking nothing but the like
industry is no way inferior. And it is to be exceedingly wished by all his
Majesty's subjects that the Plantation of Virginia may prosper well, which
lying nearest to the part from whence danger might come, may prove a Bulwark
for the safety of all the rest.

That which is now called New England was first comprehended within the Patent
of Virginia, being the Northeast part thereof, it was undertaken in a Patent by
a company of Gentlemen in the West of England, one of whom was Sir John Popha^
then Lord Chief Justice, who sent the first company that went of purpose to
inhabit there near to Segadahoek, but those that went thither, being pressed to
that enterprise, as endangered by the Law, or by their own necessities (no
enforced thing proving pleasant, discontented persons suffering, while as they
act can seldom have good success, and never satisfaction) they after a Winter
stay dreaming to themselves of new hopes at home returned back with the first
occasion, and to justify the suddenness of their return, they did coin many
excuses, burdening the bounds where they had been with all the aspersions that
possibly they could devise, seeking by that means to discourage all others,
whose provident forwardnes importuning a good success, might make their base
sluggishnesse for abandoning the beginning of a good work, to be the more
condemned.

About a four years since, a ship going for Virginia, coming by chance to
harbor in the South-west part of New England, near Cape Cod, the company whom
she carried for Plantation, being weary of the Sea, and enamored with the
beauty of the bounds that first offered it self unto them gorgeously
garnished with all wherewith pregnant nature rauishing the sight with variety)
can grace a fertile field, did resolve to stay, and seated themselves in that
place which is now called New Plimmouth, where they have builded good houses,
and by their own industry have provided themselves in such sort as they are
likely to subsist, keeping a good correspondencie with the Captains of the
Savages, who have done nothing hitherto that might offend them (and after this)
though they would dare attempt nothing to their prejudice, who are now above
two hundred persons, and do increase their number yearly. They find both the
Land and the Seas there abounding in all things needful for the use of man,
and do govern themselves after a very civil and provident manner.

Sir Ferdinando Gorge has been a chief man for the furtherance of all things
that might tend to the advancement of New England, having been at great
charges these many years past for the Discovery thereof, in doing which (a
good intention bent for other ends, casually bringing forth this effect) the
fishing there (not sought for) was found, which does prove now so profitable,
as forty or fifty Sail are employed there from England yearly, and all that
have gone thither, have made aduantagious Voyages.

This last year, he sent his Son Captain Robert Gorge with a Colonie to be
planted in Messasuats bonds, and as I hear out of a generous desire by his
example to encourage others for the advancement of so brave an Enterprise he is
resolved shortly to go him self in person, and to carry with him a great
number well fitted for such a purpose, and many Noblemen in England, (whose
names and proportions as they were marshalled by lot, may appear upon the Map)
having interressed themselves in that bounds, are to send several Colonies,
who may quickly make this to exceed all the other Plantations.

Having sundry times exactly weighed that which I have already delivered, and
being so exceedingly enflamed to do some good in that kind, that I would
rather bewray the weakness of my power, then conceal the greatness of my
desire, being much (...)aged hereunto by Sir Ferdinando Gorge, and some others
of the undertakers for New England, I show them that my Countrymen would never
adventure in such an Enterprise, unless it were as there was a New France, a
New Spain, and a New England, that they might likewise have a New Scotland,
and that for that effect they might have bounds with a correspondencie in
proportion (as others had) with the Country whereof it should bear the name,
which they might hold of their own Crown, and where they might be governed
by their own Laws; they wisely considering that either Uirginia, or New
England, has more bounds then all his Majesty's subjects are able to plant,
and that this purpose of mine, by breeding a virtuous emulation amongst us,
would tend much to the advancement of so brave a work, did yield to my desire,
de^^^^ing the bounds for me in that part, which had been questioned by the
French, and leaving the limits thereof to be appointed by his Majesty's
pleasure, which are expressed in the Pate^t granted unto me, under his great
Seal of his Kingdom of Scotland, matching upon the West toward the River of
Saint Croix now Tweed (where the Frenchmen did design their first Habitation)
with New England, and on all other parts it is compassed by the great Ocean,
and the great River of Canada, so that though sundry other preceding Patentes
are imaginarily limited by the degrees of the Heaven, I think that mine be the
first National Patent that ever was clearly bounded within America by
particular limits upon the Earth.

As soon as my Patent was passed, resolving to take possession of the Lands,
that were granted unto me, I provided my self of a ship at London, in the
month of March, in Anno 1622. but that the business might begin from that
Kingdom, which it does concern, whereby some of my Countrymen might be
persuaded to go, and others by conceiving a good opinion thereof, to depend by
expectation upon the reports of such of their acquaintance, as were to
adventure in that Voyage, I directedher to go about by S. Georges Channel, to
Kirkenbright, where she arrived in the end of May; Some Gentlemen of that
country, upon whose friendship I reposed most, happening at that time to be
out of the Kingdom, I encountered with sundry unexpected difficulties: the
prizes of victuals being within the space of three months, since I had
parted before from Scotland, suddenly tripled, and yet so scarce as I could
hardly in haste be well furnished, yet since I was so far advanced, lest I
should loose that which was done, if I did not the rest, I used the best
diligence I could to provide the ship with all things necessary. Then the
very people specially Artizens, of whom I stood in need, were at first loath to
imbarke for so remote a part, as they imagined this to be, some scarce
believing that there could be any such bounds at all, and no wonder, since
never any in that part had ever traveled thither, and all novelties being
distrusted, or disualued, few of good sort would go, and ordinary persons
were not capeable of such a purpose.

At last, in the end of June, they parted from thence to the I Will of Man, and
after some stay there, in the beginning of August, leaving the sight of his
Majesty's Dominions, did betake themselves to the Sea. Though by reason of the
latenesse of their setting forth, they had the winds very contrary about the
midst of September, they discovered Saint Peter's Islands, and were near to
Cape Bretton, but yet were beaten back again by a great storm to
New Foundland. And as they passed by the Bay of Placentia, neglecting the
occasion to place themselves in some part of my bounds, there as they might
have done, they went into Saint John's Harbor, where they concluded to stay
that Winter, and sent the ship home for a new supply of such things as were
needful.

Though it might have discouraged me much, that they had retired to
New Foundland, foreseeing that what they had with them might be wasted, and
that it would be as chargeable and difficult to furnish them forth from
thence, as if they were to go of new from Scotland, yet rather then they
should be in danger for want of provision, making me any way guilty of their
loss, that had adventured their lives, trusting to my care, I fraughted a
ship of purpose furnished with such things as were required in a Note, which
they sent home with their Messenger. This ship was dispatched by me from
London in the end of March 1623. but she happened to stay so long at
Plimmouth, first, upon some necessary occasions, and last by contrary winds, it
being the eight and twentieth of April, before she parted from thence, having
no good winds at all, that they arrived not at Saint John's Harbor, till the
fifth of June. At their coming they found the company not fit for a Plantion
which had first by an unexpected cause been divided in two during the Winter,
and in May some doubting of a supply, had engaged themselves to serve
Fishermen, by which means they gained their maintenance, and some means
beside, so that they could hardly be gathered together again, and their
Minister and Smith (both for Spiritual and Temporal respects, the two most
necessary members) were both dead, so that seeing no hope to plant themselves
in any good fashion that year, ten of the principal persons concluded to go
along with the ship to New Scotland, to discover the Country, and to make
choice of a fit place for a Habitation against the next year, considering very
well, that they could not do so much good by staying there with so few a
number, as they might do at their return, by reporting the truth to their
friends, of that which they had seen, whereby a new Colonie might be
encouraged to set forth well furnished, and instructed according to that which
might be learned by their experience.

The three and twentieth of June, they loosed from Saint John's Harbor, and
sailed toward New Scotland, where for the space of fourteen days, they were
by fogges and contrary winds kept back from spying Land till the eight of
July, that they saw the West part of Cape Bretton, and till the thirteenth day,
they sailed along the Coast, till they ran the length of Port de Mutton,
where they discovered three very pleasant Harbors, and went ashore in one of
them, which after the ships name, they called Lukes Bay, where they found a
great way up a very pleasant River, being three fathom deep at a low water at
the entry thereof, and on every side of the same they did see very delicate
Meadows, having Roses white and red, growing thereon with a kind of wild
Lilly, which had a dainty smell, the next day they resolved (coasting along
the land) to discover the next Harbor, which was but two leagues distant from
the other, where they found a more pleasant River then the first, being four
fathom deep at a low water with Meadows on both sides thereof, having Roses
and Lillies growing thereon as the other had, they found within this River, a
very fit place for a Plantation, both in regard that it was naturally apt to be
fortified, and that all the ground between the two Rivers, was without wood,
and very good fat Earth, having several sorts of beries growing thereon, as
Goose-beries, Straw-beries, Hind-beries, Rasberies, and a kind of red Wine
berie, as also some sorts of grain, as Pease, some Ears of Wheat, Barley and
Rye growing there wild; the Pease grow in abundance along the Coast, very
big and good to eat, but did taste of the fitch, this River is called Port
Jolly, from whence they coasted along to Port Negro, being twelve leagues
distant, where all the way as they sailed along, they spied a very pleasant
Country, having growing every where such things as were observed in the two
Harbors where they had been before. They found likewise in every River
abundance of Lobsters, Cockles, and other shel-fishes, and also not only in
the Rivers, but all the Coast along, numbers of several sorts of Wild-foule,
as Wild-goose, black Ducke, Woodcocke, Crane, Heron, Pidgeon, and many other
sorts of Foul which they knew not. They did kill as they sailed along the
Coast great store of Cod, with several other sorts of great fishes. The
Country is full of Woods not very thick, and the most part Oak, the rest are
Fur, Spruce, Birch, with some Sicamores, and Ashes, and many other sorts of
Wood which they had not seen before. Having discovered this part of the
Country, in regard of the Voyage their ship was to make to the Straits with
fishes, they resolved to coast along from Lukes Bay to Port de Mutton, being
four leagues to the East thereof, where they encountered with a Frenchman, that
in a very short time had made a great Voyage, for though he had furnished one
ship away with a great number of fishes, there were near so many ready as to
load himself and others. After they had taken a view of this Port, which to
their judgment they found no ways inferior to the rest they had seen
before, they resolved to retire back to New Foundland, where their ship was
to receive her loading of fishes. The 20. of July they loosed from thence, and
the seven and twentieth thereof they arrived at Saint John's Harbor, and from
thence sailed along to the Bay of Conception, where they left the ship, and
dispatched themselves home in several ships that belonged to the West part of
England.

This is no wonder, that the French being so slieghtly planted, did take no
deeper root in America, for they as only desirous to know the nature and
quality of the soil, and of things that were likely to grow there, did never
seek to have them in such quantity as was requisite for their maintenance,
affecting more by making a needless ostentation, that the World should know
they had been there, then that they did contiuue still to inhabit there, like
them, that were more in love with glory then with virtue, then being always
subject to divisions amongst themselves, it was impossible that they could
subsist, which proceeded sometime from emulation or envy, and at other times
from the laziness of the disposition of some, who (lothing labor) could be
commanded by none, who would impose more upon them then was agreeable with the
indifferency of their affections and superficial endeavors.

The English were free from these mutinies, and wanted not industry enough, but
either out of a custom they have to travel more for the benefit that does
flow from grass, then by manuring of the ground for Corn, or otherwise if
they were forced so to do by their Owners at London, who enforcing a speedy
return by their labor, would needs be trusted with furnishing of them
victuals, they applying themselves to Tobacco, and such things as might import
a present commodity, neglecting the time that might have been employed for
building, planting and husbandry, did live but like hired Servants, laboring
for their Masters, and not like Fathers providing for their Family and
Posterity, which can never be avoided till the ground be inhabited by them,
that being Owners thereof, will trust it with their maintenance, and do
content themselves with the delight of that which may give glory to them, and
profit to their heirs.

The Plantations in America do approach nearest to the purity of these that
(by an industrious diligence) in the infancy of the first age did extend the
mutiplying generations of Mankind, to people the then Desert Earth, for here
they may possess themselves without dispossessing of others, the Land either
wanting Inhabitants, or having none that do appropriate to themselves any
peculiar ground, but (in a straggling company) run like beasts after beasts,
seeking no soil, but only after their prey. And where of old the Danes,
Gauls, Goths, Hunnes, Uandals, Longobards, and thereafter Sarazens, Turks,
and Tartarians, did (with an inundation of people) encroach upon these places
of Europe, which were most civil, and where the Gospel was best planted, out
of an ambitious envy to draw unto themselves the glory that any Nation had
formerly gained, or out of an exorbitant avarice to swallow up their substance,
and to usurp (if they had power challenging right) any Lands that were better
then their own, as the most part did in Greece, Hungar^, Spain, Italy and
France. We here go to cause preach the Gospel where it was never heard, and
not to subdue but to ciuillize the Savages, for their ruin could give to us
neither glory nor benefit, since in place of fame it would breed infamy, and
would defraud us of many able bodies, that hereafter (besides the Christian
duty in saving their souls) by themselves or by their Posteritic may serve to
many good uses, when by our means they shall learn lawful Trades, and
industries, the Authors whereof (though preventing the like Superstition) may
acquire no less reverence from them, nor in like case of old Saturn, Bacchu^,
Ceres and Pallas, by teaching to plant Corn, Wine, and Oil, did get from the
credulous ignorance of them with whom they communicated their knowledge.

When I do consider with myself what things are necessary fot a Plantation,
I cannot but be confident that my own Countrymen are as fit for such a
purpose as any men in the world, having daring minds that upon any probable
appearances do despise danger, and bodies able to endure as much as the height
of their minds can undertake, naturally loving to make use of their own
ground, and not trusting to traffic. Then Scotland by reason of her
populousness being constrained to disburden her self (like the painful Bees)
did every year send forth swarms whereof great numbers did haunt Pole with
the most extreme kind of drudgerie (if not dying under the burden) scraping a
few crummes together, till now of late that they were compelled, abandoning
their ordinary calling, to betake themselves to the wars against the
Russians, Turks, or Swedens, as the Polonians were pleased to employ the^,
others of the better sort being bred in France, in regard of the ancient
league, did find the means to force out some small fortunes there, till of
late that the French though not altogether violating, yet not valuing (as
heretofore) that friendship which was so religiously observed by their
predecessors, and with so much danger and loss deserved by ours, have altered
the estate of the Guards, and do derogate from our former liberties, which
this King now reigning, we hope, will restore to the first integrity. The
necessities of Ireland are near supplied, and that great current which did
transport so many of our people is worn dry. The Low Countries have spent
many of our men, but have enriched few, and (though raising their flight with
such borrowed feathers, till they were checked by a present danger) did too
much vilipend these favorable Springs by which their weakness was chiefly
refreshed: But howsoever some particular men might prosper under a foreign
Prince, all that adventure so, do either perish by the way, or if they attain
unto any fortune, do lose the same by some color that strict laws urged
against a stranger can easily afford, or else naturalizing themselves where
they are, they must disclaim their King and Country, to which by time (the
object of their affections altered) being bound to have a care of that part
where there posterity must live, they turn every way strangers, which
necessity imposed upon them to take this course, and inconveniences following
thereupon, may be prevented by this new Plantation. And where the Scottish
Merchants before had no trade but by transporting Commodities that might have
been employed at home, and oftentimes money, to bring back Wine from France,
and Pitch, Tar, and Timber from the Easter Seas. Now only by exporting of
men, Corn, and Cattle, they may within a little time be able to furnish back
in exchange these things before named. As likewise a great benefit of fishes,
Furs, Timber and Metals, drawing forth our people to foreign Traffic,
where with they never have bin accustomed before, and that to the great
increase of the Customs, helping hereby to enrich that ancient Kingdom, which
of all the rest has only lost by his Majesty's greatness, being hereby not
only defrauded of his own presence, and of the comfort that his countenance
did continually afford, but likewise of many Commodities arising to any
Country where a Court is Resident, as the vniuersallpouertie thereof (having
few rich unless it be some Judges and their Clerks) by a common complaint
does too sensibly testify.

I have never remembered any thing with more admiration then America,
considering how it has pleased the Lord to lock it up so long amidst the
depths, concealing it from the curiosity of the Ancients, that it might be
discovered in a fit time for their posterity, they were so far of old from
apprehending it by any reach of reason, that the most learned men (as they
thought) by infallible grounds, in regard of the degrees of the Heaven, did
hold that these Zones could not be inhabited, which now are known to include
the most pleasant parts in the Word. This never came to the knowledge of any
Hebrew, Greek, or Roman, who had the most able minds to have found out such a
mystery: and howsoever some would gloss upon that Fable of Platoes Atlantic
Island, I have never observed any thing amongst the Ancient Writers tending to
such a purpose, if it be not these lines of Seneca the Tragedian, whereby he
might (if not with a prophetic, yet with a poetic rapture) deliver that which
he had a mind to make the posterity expect, and was in possibility to happen.

Uenientannis --
Secula seris, quibus ocean^^
Vincula rerum laxet, and ingens
Pateat tellus, Tophisque nonos
Detegat orbs; nec sit terris
Ultima Thule.
And it is a thing not yet comprehended by the course of natural reason, how
these parts of the World came first to be peopled: We must grant (according to
the grounds of Divinity) their people to be descended from Noah, and it is not
long since that (the Loadstone being found out) the best Sailors (scorning as
in fomer times to be only coasters) have brought the Art of Navigations to that
perfection, that they durst resolutely adventure to search the most remote
parts in the Ocean, and if any had gone thither of purpose to inhabit, they
would have carried with them the most useful kinds of tame Cattle, such as
Horses, Cowes, and Sheeps, whereof never any was found in these parts, till
they were transported thither of late years; but only such wild beasts as of
themselves might have wandered any where through vast Forests, and Deserts: so
that I do think there must be some narrow passage upon the East, toward
Terra Australis Incognita, not yet discovered, from whence people by time might
have come (crossing the Straits of Magelane) to inhabit Brasile, Chile, and
Peru, or rather I should think that there were some Continent, or Narrow Sea
toward the North, about the Straits of Anien, from whence the first
Inhabitants in America might have come; because the wild beasts that are there
are creatures most peculiar to the North, such as Elkes, Bears, and Beauers,
which are known to be ordinary with the Russians, and Tartarians; and I am
the more confirmed in this opinion, when I remember of the Mountains of Ice
that come floting every Spring along the Coast of New Foundland, which (as
it is likely) may dissolve from some Sea that has been frozen during the
Winter time, over which people, and wild beasts might have commodity to pass;
but this is a matter that can hardly be determined by demonstration or reason,
therefore (all men forming that which they know not, according to the square of
their own conceits.) We must leave this to the unlimited liberty of the
imagination of man.

But the thing most wonderful of all is this, though now it be clearly
discovered, that so few are willing to make use thereof; This does chiefly
proceed from want of knowledge, few being willing to adventure upon that
wherewith they are not acquainted by their own experience, and yet those who
have not made trial themselves, if they will trust others, may be abundantly
satisfied by the reports of a number, who to Plant and Traffic do yearly
haunt these parts. If the true estate of that which might be done at this time
by the joining of some reasonable company together were rightly understood,
then so many would not live at home as they do, losing their time, where they
can make no benefit, and burdenable to them to whom they are not useful,
rather admitted, then welcomed, the one thinking that their service should
deserve a reward, and the other that their maintenance is an unnecessary
charge, neither gaining, and both discontented: then would not so many
adventure their lives for the defense of strangers, whereby they scarce can
acquire that which does defray their own charges, and howsoever the hope of
Honor may flatter a generous spirit, there is no great appearance by this
means to provide for a Family, or for a Posterity. And if we rightly consider
the benefit that may arise by this enterprise abroad, it is not only able to
afford a sufficient means for their maintenance, who cannot conveniently live
at home, by disburdening the Country of them, but it is able to enable them to
deserve of their Country, by bringing unto it both Honor and Profit.

Where was ever Ambition baited with greater hopes then here, or where ever had
Virtue so large a field to reap the fruits of Glory, since any man, who does
go thither of good quality, able at first to transport a hundred persons with
him furnished with things necessary, shall have as much Bounds as may serve for
a great Man, whereupon he may build a Town of his own, giving it what form
or name he will, and being the first Founder of a new estate, which a pleasing
industry may quickly bring to a perfection, may leave a fair inheritance to
his posterity, who shall claim unto him as the Author of their Nobility
there, rather then to any of his Ancestors that had preceded him, though never
so nobly borne elsewhere, and if the vastenesse of their hopes cannot be
bounded within their first limits, as soon as they have strengthened themselves
for such a design, either by Sea or by Land, (in regard of the large Countries
next adjacent hereunto) there does always rest a fair possibility of a
further increase, either for them, or for their successors; and so every one
of inferior sort may expect proportionably according to his adventure: The
Merchans that are given to trade, where can they have a fairer ground for gain
then here; and that besides that which may be expected from so fertile a Land
by industry or husbandry hereafter, in present commodities, such as Cod fishes
and Herring in the Seas, Salmonds in the Rivers, Furs, Pype-staues,
Potashes, and all that may arise from the plenty of good Wood, Mineralls, and
other things though not known to strangers that only coast along the Lands,
that may be discovered hereafter by them that are to inhabit the Bounds.

Here those that are so disposed, without making a Monastical retreat (free
from a multitude of troubles) may enjoy the pleasures of contemplation, being
solitary when they will, and yet accompanied when they please, and that not
with such company as (pressed by importunity) they must discontentedly admit,
but only by them of whom they have made choice, and whom they have carried
with them, with whom (as partners of their trauells) by mutual discourses they
may remember their former dangers, and communicate their present joys: here
are all sorts of objects to satisfy the variety of desires. I might speak of
the sport that may be had by Hunting, Hawking, Fishing, and Fowling, where all
these creatures have had so long a time for increase, without being destroyed
or frighted, as likewise of the great contentment that must come by daily
discoueries of new Fields and Rivers, with the diversity of things not seen
before that may happen to be found in them: but I would rather have all at
first to think of the pains they must endure, in bringing of so notable a
Work to perfection, since no good thing can be had with ease, and all the
sons of men are borne to labor. But leaving these worldly respects, the
greatest encouragement of all for any true Christian is this, that here is a
large way for advancing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to whom Churches may be
builded in places where his Name was never known; and if the Saints of Heaven
rejoice at the conversion of a Sinner, what exceeding joy would it be to them
to see many thousands of Savage people (who do now live like brute beasts)
converted unto God, and I wish (leaving these dreams of Honor and Profit,
which do intoxicate the brains, and impoyson the mind with transitory
pleasures) that this might be our chief end to begin a new life, serving God
more sincerely then before, to whom we may draw more near, by retyring our
selves further from hence.

As I would have no man that has a mind for this course, to abuse his
judgment, by trusting too much to the fertility of the bounds where he is to
go, and too little to his own providence, and industry, whereby he may be
made to neglect the preparing himmselfe for this Voyage after such a manner as
is requisite, So I altogether dislike them that possessed with the preposterous
apprehensions of fear (like the lazy man of whom Solomon speaks, that
pretending difficulties to prevent travel, would say there was a Lion in the
way) will needs imagine the worst that is in possibility to happen: for such a
man (too ingeniously subtle in coniecturing danger) does both by preiudicated
opinions disable himself, and discourage them, who not being duly informed,
are confirmed by the confidence of other undertakers, that profess to have
knowledge, there is no man at home where he was borne, so free from the
accidents of fortune who may not quickly by a public, or by a private
calamity be brought in some measure to suffer, and much rather should we arm
our selves with a high resolution against all inconveniences that can occur
in such a foreign enterprise (being circumspectly provident, but not
confounded with a deiecting fear) where the greatness of so well grounded
hopes for us and for our Posterity should make us (hoping for pleasure) to
digest any present pain, with a courage greater then can be braued by any
apprehended trouble. And because the Lord in such eminent Exploits does
commonly glorify himself by a few number, I wish that all such whose hearts
do misgiue them portending any disaster (like them of Gideons troops that
bowed down like beasts to the water) should retire in time, ere the
contagiousnesse of their infirmity come to infect them that are more soundly
disposed. There is no just cause for a reasonable man to fear any worldly
thing, but only disgrace and want of necessary mayntenance: A man can hardly
fall in the first here, since an honorable intention what ever the success
prove must acquire praise, and the other by ordinary means, is easy to be
avoided, but I am so far from painting out a supposed facility to snare
weak minds, that I would have none (with whom it is not fit to communicate
more then they be capeable of) to imbarke in this business, but only such as do
resolve against the worst, for I profess as Cato did, when he was to enter the
Deserts of Arabia.

-- Neque enim mihi fallere quenquam
Est animus, tect^que metu perducere vulgus.
Himihi sint comites, quos ipsa pericula ducent,
Qui me test, pati, vel quae tristissima, pulchrum,
Romanumque putant; at qui sponsore salutis
Mileseget, capiturque animae dulcedine, vadat
Ad Dominum meliore via. --
And last should not these memorable Exploits of late performed in the East and
West Indies by the Flemmings, inflame us with a generous ardour to equal, or
rather to exceed them, whose penuritie of people (even at home) must be
supplied by the superfluity of ours: They have not only in the East Indies by
several Habitations appropriated large Territories to themselves, but likewise
to the great prejudice of their Neighbors, improouing their own profit, have
engrossed the general Commerce by consequence depending thereupon. And if they
seat themselves (as it is likely they will do) in Brasill, prouidently
prosecuting the good beginning that they have gotten by sparing people of their
own, or by interesting Strangers whom they dare trust for founding of a
sufficient Colonie, that being strong enough to defend and command the
Inhabitants. (Securely exacting a due obedience) may enable them for greater
matters; then confining with the very Springs whence the streams flow that
entertayne the power of their enemies (exhausting their substance both by Sea
and Land) they have a marvelous fair occasion offered to advance then selves
by depressing of the opposed party whose prosperous and desired success
(whilst the adding to one does derogate from another) if not emulated in time,
will be envied hereafter.

I know that many of my Nation if they had been as willing as they are able
had been more fit then I am for this purpose, but yet it has oftentimes
pleased God to do the greatest matters by the meanest Instruments. And as no
one man could accomplish such a Work by his own private fortunes, so if it
shall please his Majesty (as he has ever been disposed for the furthering of
all good Works more for the benefit of his Subjects, then for his own
particular) to give his help accustomed for matters of less moment hereunto,
making it appear to be a Work of his own, that others of his subjects may be
induced to co^curre in such a common cause, no man could have had my charge
that with more affection and sincerity should have used his endeavors for
discharging of the same, but I must trust to be supplied by some public helps,
such as has been had in other parts, for the like cause whereunto, as I doubt
not, but many will be willing out of the nobleness of their disposition, for
the advancing of so worthy a Work, So I hope will some others, the rather out
of their private respect to me, who shall continue as I have heretofore done,
both to do and write in so far, as so mean an ability as mine may reach,
what (I conceive) may prove for the credit or benefit of my Nation, to whom I
wish all happiness.

FINIS.
