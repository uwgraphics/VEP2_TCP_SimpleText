Our gracyous god most in magnyfyce^ce
His mercyful eyes casts from heaven on hi
Seeing his creatures in deedly vyolence
Him self complayneth by pity full ru^fully
Saying
Deus. o man deuoyde of intellygence
Open thine eeres unto my call and cry
And tell me if I have done to the offense
That thou forsakest my wyllyngly
Man such a love to the I did take
This world in seven days wha^ I it wrought
Thou was the last thing that I did make
Because I would thou wanted naught
What thing the might help did not lake
That at thy need if it were sought
Foul fysshe all thing for thy sake
For thy comfort all was forth brought
More over I gave the that dygnyte
All beestes to bow the until
I made the also like unto me
And gave the conning and freewyll
Me to serve that thou should se
To chose the good and leave the ill
I ask nothing again of the
But love thy sovereign as it is skyll
But unto this take thou none entente
Thou tournest fro me full unkindly
On loves unlawful thy love is lent
Thy heart beholds not heaven so hye
For all the goods I have the sent
The lysteth not ones to say gramercye
In time to come or thou repent
Man make amends or that thou dye

A christian soul conceived in sin
Received in conscience thus complanynge
He fell down flat with delefull dynne
And said
Homo. lord mercy sovereign king
I most unkind wretch of man kynne
I know I am thy traitor untrue in my living
This wicked life that I live in
I may it naught hyde from thy knowing
I want words and also wit
Of thy kyndnesse to speak a cause
That I have thou gave me it
Of thy goodness withouten cause
Though I have grieved the and do yet
Thy benefaytes thou naught withdrawse
I have deserved to have hell pytte
So have I lived against thy lawse
But lord thou know man's feblenesse
How frail it is and has been aye
For though the soul have thy likeness
Man is but fulsome earth and claye
In sin conceived and wretchedness
And to the soul rebel always
First a man grows as does gresse
And he wastes after as flowers or hay
Sith man is than so frail a thing
And thy power so great in kind
This world is but a twynkelynge
Thou may destroy the might of the find
With thy right lord mercy mynge
And to my sore salve thou send
Sore me repents of my my slyuynge
Mercy lord I will amend

Deus. Man I gave the bodyly hele
That thou should it spend in my service
Fayrenes also and fetures feel
Man what do thou with all these
Thou with delytes of the devil do dele
Which is to me a great despise
Thou lyuest a lecherous life vnlele
Fro year to year thou list not rise
Thou studyest after nyce array
And make great cost on thy clothing
To make the semely as who should say
Thou coudest amend my making
Thou purposed the day by day
To set my people in synnynge
Thy wretched will thou folowest always
What end sin has you thynkest nothing
In Noes time because of sin
And for lecherye in especyall
What vengeance came than to man's kynne
Save.viii. persons drowned were all
On Sodom / and Gomor / and the men wtin
How I made fire and brymstone fall
Fro heaven on them that bode therein
for sin were destroyed both great and small
Man wenest thou my might be less
Than it was than or that else I
Thou have no as much wickedness
As when I smote the most pyteously
But if thou will thy fautes redress
Thought I now spare for my mercy
Man think on my ryghtwysnesse
And make amends or that thou dye

The Prologue of the Translatoure.
O Mighty Mars yt with thy stern light
In Armies have / ye power and y^ might
And named art / from est till occident
The mighty lord / the god Armypotent
That with shynynge / of thy stremes read
By influence / do thy brydell led
Of chyualrie / as soueraygne and patron
Full hot and dry / of complexion
Irous and wode / and malencolyk
And of nature / brent and colleryk
Of color showing / like the fyrie glede
Whose ferce lokes / ben as full of dread
As the leuene / that alyghteth low
Down by the sky / from Iubiters bow
Thy stremys ben / so passing dispytous
To look upon / inly furyous.
And Canser / art with thy fyrie bemys
Of werre and strife / in many sundry reamys
Whose lordshyp is / most in Capricorn
But in the book / is thy power lorne
And Canser art of contek / and of strife
Now for the love / of Vulcanus wife
With whom whylom / you were at myschef take
So help me now / only for her sake
And for the love / of thy belloua
That with the dwellyth / beyond Cirrea
In Libye land / upon the sondes read
So be my help / in this great need
To do socour / my style to direct
And of my pen / the tracys to correct
Which barayne is / of aureat lycoure
But in thy grace / I find some socoure
For to convey i^ / with thine influence
That stumbleth aye / for fault of eloquence
For to rehearse / or write any word
Now help / o mars / y^ art of knyghthode lord
And have of manhood / the magnyficence
And Other / goddess / of prudence
This work texpleyte / that ye not refuse
But makes Clyo / for to be my muse
With her sustren / that on pernasa dwell
In Cirrea / by Elycon the well
Rennynge full clear / with stremys cristallyn
And called is / the well Caballyn
That spring by touch / of the pegase
And help also / o thou callyope
That were mother / unto Orpheus
Whose dytees were / so melodyous
That the werbles / of his resownynge harp
Appese did / the bitter words sharp
Both of parchas / and furyes infernal
And Cerbetus / locruell found at all
He coyed also / beast foul and tree
Now of thy grace / be helping unto me
And of thy golden dew / let the lycour wete
My dullyd breast / that with thine honey sweet
Sugryst tunges / of rethoricyens
And maystresse art / to musicyens
Now be mine help / to enlumyne with this work
Which am beset / with clouds dymme and derke
Of ygnoraunce / in making to proceed
To be lusty to them / that shall it read
Also in heart / I am so full of dread
When prudent lysters / here to shall take heed
That in making / more skyll can than I
To whom I pray / full benyngly
Of their goodness / to have compassyon
Where as I err / in my translacyon
For god I take / hyghly / to witness
That I this work / of hertely low humblesse
Took upon me / of entencion
Deuoyde of pride / and presumpcion
For to obey / without varyaunce
My lords bidding / fully and pleasaunce
Which has desire / sothely for to said
Of verray knyghthode / to remember again
The worthynesse / if I shall not lie
And the prowess / of old chyualrye
Because he has joy / and great deyntee
To read in books / of antiquytee
To find only virtue / for to sewe
By example of them / and also for to eschew
The cursed vice of slouthe / and ydelnesse
So he emoyeth / in virtuous business
In all that longs / to manhood dare I said
He besyeth ever / and thereto is so feign
To haunte his body / in plays marcyall
Thorugh exercise / to exclude s^outhe at all
After the doctrine / of vigecius
Thus is he both manfull and virtuous
More passyngly / than I can of him write
I want co^nyng / his high renown to endyte
So much of manhood / men may in him seen
And for to wit / whom I would mean
Theeldest sone / of the noble king
Henry y^ fourth / of knyghthod well and spring
In whom is showed / of what stock yt he grew
The rootis virtue / thus can the sent renew
In every part / the tarage is the same
Like his fader / of manners and of name
In sothfastnesse / this no tale is
Called Henry eke / the worthy prince of walys.
To whom shall long / by succession
For to govern / brutis albion
Which me co^maundyd / the drery pytous fate
Of them of troy / in ynglysshe to translate
The sege / also / and destruction
Like as the latin / makes mention
For to compyle / and after Guydo make
So I could / and write it for his sake
Because he would / that to high and low
The noble storye / openly were know
In our tunge / about in every age
And Iwryten / as well in our langage
As in latin / and in frensche it is
That of the storye / the truth we not mys
No More than does / each other nation
This was the fine of his entencion.
The which empryse / anon I gynne shall
In his worship / for a memoryall
And of the time / to make mention
When I began / on this translacion
It was the year / sothly to seyne
Fortene complete / of his faders reygne
The time of year / shortly to conclude
When.xx grees / was phoebus altitude
The hour when he / made his stedes draw
His rosen chariet / low under the wawe
To bathe his beme / in the wawysce
Gressyd like gold / as men might se
Passing the bordure / of our Occian
And lucyna of color / pale and wan
Her cold arisynge / in Octobre began to dyght
To enchace the derkenes / of the frosty night
In the mids / of the Scorpion
And Esperus / began to westre down
To have her course / again the morrow gray
And lucyfer the night / to void away
Is called than / messager of day
Our emysperie / to put out of affraye
With bright kalendis / of phoebus vprist shene
Out of the bounds / proserpma the queen
Where pluto dwells / the derke region
And the furies / have their mansion
Till after sone Apollo list not tarry
To take so^our / in the sagittarye.
Which time I began / the prologue to behold
Of troy book / I made by days old
Where was remembered / of auctours us beforne
Of the deed the verray true corn
So as it fell / severed fro the chafe
For in their hand / they hold for a staff
The truth oonly / which they have complied
Unto this fine / that we were not begyled
Of neclygence / thorugh for yet fullness
The which serpent / of age by process
Engendered is / fersely us to assail
Of the truth / to make us for to fail
For ner writers / all were out of mind
Not storyed oonly / but of nature and kind
The true knowing / should have gone to wrake
And from science / our wits put abake
Ne had our elders / cerched out and sought
The sothfast pythe / to ympe it in our thought
Of things passed / fordyrked of their hew
But thorugh writing / they be refresshed new
Of our Auncetres / left to us be hynde
To make a myrrour / oonly to our mind
Tose each thing / trewely as it was
More hight and clear / than in any glass
For ner their writing / now memoryall
Death with his sword / should have slain all
And I dymmed / with his sudden shoures
The great prowess / of these conqueres
And dyrked eke / the bryghtnesse of their fame
That shyneth yet / by report of their name
For unto us / their books represent
Without feynynge / the way that they went
In their days / when they were alive
Again the truth / who so euerstryue
Or counterplete / or make any debate
The sothe is read / of high or low estate
Without favor / who solyste take heed
For after death / clerks little dread
After decrete / for to bear witness
Nor of a tyrant / the truth to express
As men disserne / without excepcion
with lak or prys / they grant them their guerdon
Wherefore me seems / every manner man
Should by his line / in all that ever he can
For virtue oonly / eschew to do amys
For after death / plainly as it is
Clerks will write / and except none
The plain truth when a man is gone
And by old time / for their writing true
They cherysshed were / of lords yt them knew
And honored greatly / in tho days
For they enacted / and gylte with their says
Their high renown / their ma^hod and prowes
Their knyghthode eke / and their worthynesse
Their Tryumphes / also and victories
Their famous conquest / and their fonge glories
From point to point / rehersyng al y^ troth
Without fraud / neclygence or sloth
They did their labor / and their business
For else certain / the great worthynesse
Of their deeds / had been in vain
For dyrked age / else would have slain
By length of years / the noble worthy fame
Of conqueroures / and plainly of their name
For dymmed eke / the letters aureat
And diffaced / the palm laureat
Which yt they wan / by knyghode i^ their days
Whose fretynge ruste new / and new assayes
For to eclypse the honor / and the glory
Of high prowess / which clerks in memory
Have trewely set / thorugh dylygent labor
And enlumyned / with many coryous flower
Of Rethoryk / to make us comprehend
The truth of all / as it was in kind
Besyed them / and faithfully trauayled
Again all that / that age would assailed
In their books / every thing I set
And with the key / of remembrance it shet
Which lasts yet / and dureth ever in one
Record of Thebes / that was so long a gone
Of which the / ruin / and destruction
Ye may behold / by good inspeccion
Croppe and root / right as it was in deed
On Stace look / and there ye may it read
How Polynece / and Ethiocles
The brethren two / ne cowde not live in pes
Till Thebes / was brought unto ruin
And all the manner / how they did fine
That death also / of worthy Tideus
And how Edippus / with terys full pyteus
Wept out his eyes / and all his drery pain
And how the smokes / departed were on twain
At the feste / of fyres funeral
In great Stace / ye may read all
The fire engendered / by brotherly hatrede
Where thorugh that death / was the cruel mede
In very sothe / of many worthy man
Like as mine Auctour / well reherce can
Of Troy also / that was of latter years
By dylygence / of Cronycleres
Ye may behold / in their writing well
The strife / the werre / the sege and euerydell
Right as it was / so many years passyd
Whose storye yet / age has not dyffacyd
Nor cruel death / with his mortal strokes
For maugre death / ye may behold in books
The storye fully rehersyd new and new
And fresshely flower / of color / and of hew
From day to day / quycke and nothing feynt
For clerks have / this strorye so depeynt
That death nor age / by no manner weye
The troth / may not / make for to deye.
All be that some / have the truth spared
In the writing / and plainly not declared
So as it was / nor told out faithfully
But it transformyd / in their poysy
Thorugh vain fables / which of entencion
They have contryued / by falls transsumpcion
To hyde truth / falsely under cloud
And the sothe of malys / for to shrowde
As Omer did / the which in his writing
I feyned has / full many diverse thing
That never was / as Guydo list deuyse
And things done / in another wise
He has transformyd / than the truth was
And feyned falsely / that gods in this cas.
The worthy Greeks / help to werrey
Again Troyens / and how that they were sey
Like lyfely men / among them day by day
And in his dytees / that were so fresshe and gay
With sugared words / under honey soote
His galle is hyd / low by the root
That it may not / outward be aspyed
And all for he / with Greeks was allied
Therefore he was / to them favorable
In much thing / which is not commendable
Of them that lust / to deem after right
For in making / love has lost his sight
To give a prys / where none is deserved
Cupide is blind / whose domes ben observed
More after lust / than after equity
Or after reason / how the truth be
For syngulertee / and falls affection
Reyseth full often / by vain lausyon
A man to worship / that deserves none
By falls report / and thus full many one
Without merit / has his fame blow
Whereof another / the renown is unknow
That in arms / has meruayles wrought
Of whom paraunter / speaks no man naught
For favor oonly / is fostred more than ryghtes
That hyndred has / many worthy knights.
Ouyde also poet ycally / has closed
Falshed with truth / that makes men enosed
To which part / that they shall them hold
His mysty speech / so hard is to unfold
That it entryketh / reders that it se
Virgyle also / for love of Enee
In eneydos / rehersyth much thing
And was in party / true of his writing
Except oonly / that him list some while
The tracys follow / of Omeris style.
And of this sege / wrote eke Lollius
But tofore all / Dares frigius
Wrote most trewely / after that he fond
And dytees eke / of the greeks land
For they were present / and seyen euerydell
And as it fill / they write true and well
Each in his tunge / by such consonaunce
That in their books / was no varyaunce
Which after were / unto Athenes brought
And by process / cerchyd out and sought
By dylygence / of one Cornelius
Which was neuewe / unto Salustius
Of Rome I borne / which did his dew
Them to translate / and the tracys sewe
Of these Auctours / by good auysement
But because / he set all his intent
For to be breef / he left much behind
Of the story / as men in books find
The first meuynge / and cause orygenall
What was the gynnynge / and root in special
Ne how they came / by land or by nauye
How first the spark / was kyndled of envy
Betwyxt greeks / and them of troy town
Of which Cornelie / makes no menciowne
Of their ships / nor of their vytayle
Nor how / that greece / is called y^ tail
And the less / as books veryfye.
Is named now / the land of Romanye
What noumbre of kings / and of dukes went
Toward the sege / all of one assente
To win worship / and for excersyse
Of arms oonly / in full knyghtly wise
Abiding there / to se / the version
Of the cytee / and noble yllion
Nor what the manner was / of their armure
Nor at the sege / who lengest did endure
In what wise / each other did assail
Nor how often / they met in battle
How many worthy / lost there his life
Thorugh old hatred / wrought up new strife
Nor of their death / he datyth not the year
For his writing / was particulere
Without fruit / he was compendious
This foresaid romeynge / this Cornelius.
Wherefore but late / in comparysowne
There was an Auctour / of full high renown
That besyed him / the tracys for to sewe
Of dyte / and Dares / and cast him not transmewe
In all the storye / a word as in sentence
But follows them / by such conuenyence
That in effect / the substance is the same
And of columpna / Guydo was his name
Which had in writing / passing excellence
For he enlumyneth / by craft and cadence
This noble storye / with many fresshe color
Of Rethoryk / and many rich flower
Of eloquence / to make it sown bet
Hein the storye / has ympyd in and set
That in good faith / I trow he has no pere
To reken all / that wryted of this matere
As in his book / ye may behold and se
To whom I say / knelynge on mykne
Laud and honor / and excellence of fame
O Guydo master / be unto thy name
That excellest / by souereygne of style
All that write / this matter to compyle
Whom I shall / follow as nere as ever I may
That god grant it / to be to thy pay
Of him for whom / I have undertake
So as I can / this storye for to make
Prayeng to all / that shall it read or se
Where as I err / to amend me
Of humble heart / and low entencion
Committing all / to their correccion
And there of thank / my will is yt they wyn
For thorugh their support / thus I will begin.
Explicit Prologus.
Here begins the Troy book / translated by John^ Lydgate monk of Bery the
which speaks first / How the king of Thesalye named Pelleus had all his men
slain by dyuyne punycyon And how thorugh his prayer he had other again. Ca.
Primo.
IN the reygne / and land of Thesalye
The which is now / ynamed Salonye
There was a king / called Pelleus
Wise and discrete / and also virtuous
The which as Guydo / list to specyfye
Held the lordshyp / and the regalye
Of this isle / as governor and king
Of which the people / by record of writing
Myrundones were called / in tho days
Of whom Ouyde / seyneth in his says
Methamorphoscos / where as ye may read
How this people / soth fastly in deed
So as mine Auctour / makes mention
Were brought / echone to destruction
With sudden tempest / and with fyry leven
By the gods / sent down from the heaven
For they of ire / without more offense
With the sword and stroke / of pestylence
On this isle / whylom took vengaunce
Like as it is / put in remembrance
For this people / distroyed were certain
With thunder dynt / and with hayle and rain
Full unawarely / as Guydo list descryue
For there was none / of them left a live
In all the land / that the vyolence
Escape might / of this pestylence
Except the king / the which went alone
In to a wood / for to make his moan
Sool by him self / all disconsolate
In a place / that stood all desolate
Where this king romynge / to and fro
Complaining aye / of his fatal woe
And the harmys / that he did endure
Till at the last / of caas or adventure
Beside an holt / he saw where stood a tree
Of full great heyght / and large of quantytee
Hole by the root / as he cowde know
Where as he saw / by the earth low
Of Amptys crepe / passing great plente
With which syghte / he fylle down on his kne
And made his prayer / in his paynym wise
To the gods / with humble sacrefyse
Upon his woe / and great aduersytee
Oonly of mercy / for to have pytee
To turn these Amptys / into form of man
Thus began he pray / with color pale and wan
His land to enhabyte / which stands desolate
And he alone / a wapyd and a mate
Comfortles / of any creature
Him to releue of that he did endure
And as Ouyde / makes mention
That Iubiter / herd his orison
And has such routhe / on him at the least
That he anon fulfylleth his request
And of his might / which that is dyuyne
His grace he made / from heaven for to shine
Benyngly / unto the earth down
That a sudden / transmutaciowne
Was made of Amptes / to form of me^ anoon
Which on their fete / gonne straight to goon
To Thesalye / and salve there the king
And like his lyeges / took their dwelling
Whithin a Cytee / called tho Egee
As in Ouyde / ye may behold and se
The which people / for their worthynesse
For their strength / and great hardynesse
Myrundones / so long / have bore the name
As in the life / ye read may the same
Of saint Mathewe / how they be called so
Where the apostle / so much had a do
Which for wisdom / and prudent aduertence
Besye labor / and wylfull dylygence
By forseynge / and discrecyon
As I suppose / in mine oppynyon
That this fable / of Amptys was contryued
Which by their wysdom / have somoch acheued
Thorugh their knyghthod / who so list to look
Their manly dedys / thorugh Troy book
In all myscheif / so well they have them borne
That they full wisely / provided were toforne
Of that it fill / both in werre and pes
For of no s^outhe / they were not rekles.
But as the Ampte / to eschew ydelnesse
In somer / is so full of business
Or winter come / to save her fro cold
She tofore / astoryd has her hold.
But in this matere / I hold no sermon
I will no longer / make digression
Nor in fables / no more as now soiourne
But there I left / I will again return
Of Pelleus / ferther to proceed
Which king forsothe / in storye as I read
And as mine Auctour / lysteth to endyte
Had a wife / that called was Tedyte
Of which twain / platly this no lees
The manly man / the hardy Achilles
So as Guydo / lysteth to termyne
Descendyd was / sothly as by line
Most reno^med / of manhood and of might
Among Greeks / and the best knight
I hold in sothe / thorughout all the land
In worthynes / preued of his hand
Whose cruelte / troyens sore abought
By his meruayles / that he there wrought
During the syege / as ye shall after lere
Pacyently / if yelyst to here
This Pelleus / that I of spoke aforne
A brother had / of one mother borne
That hight Eson / so far I run in years
That he of lust / has lost all his desires
So far he was / cropen in to aege
That all his wit / was turned to dotage
For both mind / and memoryall
Fordulled were / and derked so all
That verayly / his dyscrecyon
Was hy^ berafte / in conclusyon
Wherefore / the regne and land of Thesalye
Crown and ceptre / with all the regalye
He has resygned / his brother for to queme
Estate royal / and also dyademe
How king Eson crowned his brother Pelleus king because that he was fallen in
age and might not welde it. Ca. ii.
Because he was / crooked lame and blind
And to govern / lost both wit and mind
So feeble was / his celle retentyfe
And forderked / his ymagynatyfe
That lost were / both memory and reason
For which he made / a resygnacyon
To his brother / next heir by degree
And nyest allye of his affynyte
But as some Auctours / in their books said
To youth he was / restoryd new again
By craf^e of Medee / the great Sorceresse
And renewed / to his lustynesse
For with her herbys / and with her pocions
Sotyll workynge / of confexions
By queyntyse eke / of her instruments
With her charms / and enchauntementes
She made a drink / in books as is told
In which / a yerde that was dry and old
Without abode / anon as she it cast
To blosme and budde / it began as fast
Turn grene / and fresshe to behold
And thorugh his drynk / she has fro years old
Eson restored / unto lusty age
And was of wit and reason / eke as sage
As ever he had / his life ben aforne
The which Eson / of his wife I borne
Had a sone / and Jason was his name
In work of whom / nature was not to blame
For she her craft / platlye and conning
Spent upon him / holy in werkynge
When she him made / with heart / will and thought
That of her craft / behind was right naught
To reken his shap / and also his fayrnesse
His strength / his beauty / and his lyflynesse
His gentylnesse / and his wise governance
How large he was / and of dalyaunce
The most goodly / that men cowde know
In all his por^e / both to high and low
And with all this / auyse and a tretable
That of conning / god wot I am not able
For to descryue / his virtues by and by
For as mine Auctour / tells faithfully
He was beloved / so of old and young
That thorugh the land / is his honor spronge
But for that he was / but young and sklendre
Of age also / miy grene and tender
He was comytted / to the gouernayle
Of Pelleus / to whom without fail
In every thing / he was as seruyable
As dylygent in chamber / and at table
As ever was any / child or man
Unto his lord / in all that ever he can
Glade in heart / and of faithful obeyssaunce
So that in chere / nor in countenance
Inward in heart / nor outward in showing
His uncle / ne was he not grutchynge
All be he had / holy in his hand
The worthy kingdom / and the rich land
Of this Jason / and the heritage
Oonly, for he was to young of age.
Unto whom / Pelleus did his pain
Against heart / falsely for to feign
To show other / than he mente in heart
And kept him close / y^ no thing him out sterte
Like an addre / vnderfloures fair
For to his heart / his tunge was contrayre
Benyngne of speech / of meuynge a serpente
For v^o^r color / was the treason blente
To show him goodly / unto his allye
But inward brent / of hate and of envy
The hoote fire / and yet there was no smeke
So covertly / the malys / was I reke
That no man might / as by sign espy
Toward Jason / in heart he bare envy
And marvel noon / for it was causeles
Save he dradde / that he for his encres
And for his manhood / lykly was to atteyne
For to succeed / in his fadres reyne
Which Pelleus / unjustly occupyeth
And day by day / cast and fantasyeth
How his venym / may by some pursuit
Upon Jason / be fully execute
Here on he museth / every hour and time
As he that dradde / to se an hasty pryme
Follow change / as it is wont to done
Suddenly after / a new moan
He cast ways / and compasses sore
And under color / always more and more
His fell malys / he began to close and hyde
Like a snake / that is wont to glyde
With his venym / under fresshe flowers
And as the son / is hoote after these shoures
So of envy hatter / brent the glede
Upon a time / he thought to proceed
To execute / his meuynge euerydell
In port / alambe / in heart a lion fell
Double as a Tygre / slyghly to compace
Galle in his breast / and lugre in his face
That no man has / to him suspeccion
How he purueyeth / the distruccion
Of his neuewe / and that within a while
Pretendynge love / all be the fine was gyle
His malys was yshet / so under keye
That his intent / there can no man bewreye
It was conceled / and closyd in secre
Under the lock / of pryue enmyte
And that in sothe / grieved him the more
Upon him self / the anger frette so sore
Abiding aye / till unto his intent
He find may / leyser conuenyent
Upon his purpose / platly to proceed
For to perform / it fully up in deed
Whereof Jason / has full little rought
His uncle / and he / ne were not in one thought
Of whose menynge / was no conuenyence
For malyse was coupled / with innocence
And ground of al / so as I can deuyse
Was envy / and couetyse
Which fret so sore / falsely for to win
As croppe and root / of every sorrow and sin
And cause has been / sithe go full yore
That many a realm / has a bought full sore
The dredefull venym / of couetyse alas
Let them beware / that stand in this caas.
To think before / and for to have in mind
That all falshed / draws to an end
For though it bide / and last a year or two
The end in sothe / shall be sorrow and woe
Of all that been false / and enuyous
Here of no more / but forth of Pelleus
I will you tell / that has solonge sought
Upon this thing / till there were to hy^ brought
Tidings new / and that so meruaylous
That he astonyd was / and all his house
Of a marvel / that newly was fall
Beside Troy / the plage oryentalle
How in Colchos / as the riding came
Whithin an isle / enclosed was a Ram
Which bare his flees / full rychely of gold
And for the rychesshe / it was kept in hold
With great aduyce / and great dylygence
That no man might / there to do offense.
And in this isle / there was a governor
A noble king / a worthy werreour
That Cethes hyghte / wise discrete and sage
Which was also / yronne fer in age
That in his time / as books can deuyse
Had vnderfonged / many great empryse
In peace and werre / and much worship won
And he was sone / also to the son
That gave him ure / to honor to atteyne
So as poets lysteth / for to feyne
Touching his line / I leave as now the great
And of this Ram / my purpose is entrete.
That was committed / I dare you well assure
To the keeping / and the besy cure
Of cruel Mars / the mighty god of werre
Which with the stremys / of his reed sterre
And influence / of his deytee
Ordained has / by full great crueltee
This Ram to keep / bollys full vnmylde
With brazen feet / ramageous and wild
And therewith / all full fell and dyspitous
And of nature / wood and furyous
To hurt and slay / ever of one desire
Out of whose mouth / leven and wild fire
Like a flawme / ever blased out
To brenne all them / that stood nyghe about
Eke of theyreyen / the lokes most horrible
To a fourneys / the stremes were visyble
And who that would / to increase his glory
This Ram of gold / win by the victory
First he must / of very force and might
Unto oultrance / with this bullys fight
And them venquysshe / alder first of all
And make them humble / as any ox in stall
And to the yok / and do them ere the land
Of very manhood / this must he take an hand
And after that / he must also endure
With a serpent / of huge and great stature
Without favor / plainly have a do
To oultrance eke / without words mo
The which serpent / shortly for to tell
Was like a fend / comen out of hell.
Full of venym / and of cruel hate
And with skalys / hard as any plate
He armed was / to stand at defense
And his brethe / werse than pestylence
Infecten would / enuyron all the air
In each place / where was his repeyre
He was so full / of corrupcion
And so dredefull / of infeccion
That death in ^oth / shortly to deuyse
Was the fine / of this high Empryse
To such as would / this quarrel take in hand
Ilyke in one / both to fre and bond
But if he cowde / the better him self defend
And of his conquest / this was eke the end
That when he had / the mighty serpent slawe
He must anon / by custom and by law.
Out of his head / his tethe echon arrace
And than sow them / in the self place
Where the Oxes / eryd had aforne
Of such seed / there sprange a wonder corn
Knights armed / passing of great might
Eueryche with other / ready for to fight
Till each his brother / had brought to ground
By mortal fate / and give his dethes wound
This was the end / of them euerychon
For in sothenesse / of all there was noon
That live might / by that fatal law
Any longer in sothe / than his felawe.
And by this way / dredefull and peryllous
Who desires / to be victoryous
He must pass / and manly to endure
And how so fall / take his adventure
Of none estate / was none excepcion
Chese who so will / for his conclusion
He may not escape / for fauourne for mede
Who so ever begin / a vyse him well I read
For by the statute / of the king I may
Who so that will / enter and assay
But after that he / ones has begone
He may not chese / till he have lost or won
y^et / as some of this Ram express
And of his flees / also bear witness
It was no thing / but gold and great treasoure
That Cethes king / withfull hye labor
Made keep it / by Incantacions
By sorcerye / and falls illusions.
That was spoke of in realms fer about
For which many / put their life in doubt
Of hye desire / they had for to win
The great treasoure / that was shyt within
Colchos land / as ye have herd deuyse
Whose pursuyte rose / out of couetyse
Ground and root / of woe and all myschaunce
By vain report / them self to auaunce
For which they put / them self / in ieopardye
Without rescues / lykely for to dye
There was no help / ne no sleyghte of arms
That veil might / again y^ cursyd charms
They were so strong / and superstycious
That many worthy / i^ knyghthod full famous
Enhasted were / unto their death alas
That list ieoparde / their lives in this cas.
And this lastyth till / afterward byfell
That Pelleus / platly herd tell
The great myschefes / and distruccions
In Colchos wrought / on sundry nations
That pursued / the auntres to conquer
Till Pelleus / so ferfoth began enquere
That he knew holy / how the truth was
And in his heart / anon he began compass
How he might / by any sleyght make
His neuewe Jason / for to under take
This hye Empryse / in Colchos for to wend
By which way / best he might him shende.
And began pretend a color / fresshe of hew
I gylt outward / so lusty and so new
As there were no treason / hid within
And saw it was time / to begin
On his purpose / thofirst / he made it queynte
And began with asour / and gold to peynte
His gaye words / in sownynge glorious
Knowing Jason / was young and desirous
Unto such thing / and lightly would enclyne
Therefore he thought / that he would fine
Plainly to work to his conclusion
And made anon / a conuocacion
Of his lords / and his baronye
About enuyron / the land of Thesalye
For to assemble / estates of degree
Of all his realm / within the chief cytee
For to hold a counsel / utterly cast
Thereby to acheue / his desire as fast
And so his court / continued days three
That the last / his hyd myquyte
He out began rake / that has be hyd so long
For he ne might / no longer forth prolonge
The venym hyd / that frete so at his heart
In so slye wise / that no man might auerte
Upon no side / but that he mente well
For the treason / was cured euerydell
And curtyned / under trecherye
For he this thing / so slyghly began to gye
At pryme face / that no man might deem
By any word / as it would seem
In chere / in port / by sign or dalyaunce
But that he cast / knyghtly for to auaunce
His young neuewe / as by lyklynesse
To hye honor / of manhood and prowess
For of the intent / of which he began purpose
No man cowde spy / theffecte he did so gloss
The text was so conveyed / so with flaterye
That the people / cowde not espy
Little or naught / of his intent within
For which anon / to preyse him they begin
That he such honor / to his neuewe would
For with such chere / he began unfold
Tofore them all / this entencion
That he has voyded / all suspeccion
From all that were / assembled in the place
And toward Jason / he turn began his face
Full louyngly / in countenance and cher^
And to him said / that all might it here
Thorughout y^ court / wha^ maked was silence
Thus word by word / platly in sentence.
How Pelleus counsayled his neuewe Jason by malice to go conquer the golden
^lees / and how he took it upon him. Ca. iii.
COsyn Iaso^ / take heed what I shall sayn
For the I am / so inly glad and fayn
And supprised / with myrthe thorugh my heart
That it enchasyth / and voydeth all my smerte
For to consider / in mine Inspeccion
Of thy youth / the disposicion
The which shortly / for to comprehend
Save to virtue / to no thing does entende
Unto worship / and to gentylnesse
To manly fredom / and to hye largess
That verrayly / where I wake or wynke
My joy is oonly / there on for to think
My self I hold / so passing fortunate
And all my land / of hye and low estate
That lykely are / in honor for to flete
And tolyue in rest / and quyete
Thorugh thy supporte / and supportayle
Whose man hode may / so much us avail
By lykelyhod / and so much amend
In verray sothe / to save us and defend
Again all tho / as I can descryue
That of malys / would against us strive
Or rebel / in any manner way
Of surquedrye / or pride to werraye
Our worthynesse / assuryd in tranquylle
From all assaute / of them that would us ylle
For to perturbe / our noble estate royal
Against whom when thou art our wall
Our mighty shyeld / and proteccion
Thus deem I fully / in mine oppynyon.
For of thine age / thy wit / thy prouydence
Thy knyghtly heart / thy manly excellence
Reported ben / and thine hye renown
In many land / and many regyowne
This round world / about in circuyte
How might I than / stand in better plyte
For thine honor / like as it is found
To my worship / so hyghly does rebounde
That I would plainly / and not cease
If I could help / to increase
Thine high renown / I wys in every hour
And thereupon / spenden my treasour
This high desire / withouten any fail
Of entyer love / me does so sore assail
That night nor day / I may have no rest^
And all shall turn / I hope for the best
For to enhaunce thyn honor / to the heaven
Above the pool / and the sterrys seven
To which thing / I have away espied
As I my wit / thereto have applied
This is to mean / what should I longer dwell
My dear Cosyn / as I shall the tell
If it so were / by manhood souereyne
Of thy knyghthode that thou durst atteyne
The flees of gold / to conquer by thy strength
Which is spoke of / so fer in bread and length
And return home / in body saufand sound
If this conquest might in the be found
That thou durst / achieue this empryse
More hertis wye / kowde I not deuyse
In all this world / for sothly at the best
My realm and I / were than in rest
For to thy manhood / all would us dread
Wherefore / cosyne / of knyghthode and manhede
Take upon the / my prayer and request
And here my truth / and take it for beheste
What ever needs / in meygne or costage
I will my self / toward this vyage
Ordeyney* ioughe / in harneyse and array
That naught shall fail / that is to thy pay
And moreover / I plainly the ensure
That if I se / thou do thy besycure
This high empryse / for to bring about
Thou shall not fere / nor eke ben in doubt
After my day / by succession
For to be king / of this Region
And holy have scepter / and regalye
Wherefore Jason / lift up thine heart is eye
Think thy name / shall be long recorded
Through out the world / wherefore be accorded
Within thy self / and plainly not ne spare
Of thine intent / the sum to declare.
When Jason had / his uncle understand
He reioyseth / for to take on hand
This dreadful labor / without auysement
He naught aduertith / the meuynge fraudulent
The pryue poison / under sugre cured
Nor how to galle / with honey he was lured
The derke deceyte / the clowdy falls engyne
Ygy^t without / but under was venyme
Whereto Jason / has noon aduertence
The king he wend / of clean conscience
Without fraud had / all this thing Iment
Wherefore anon / he yeueth full assent
At words few / and plainly began to seye
His uncles will / that he would obey
He was accordyd / in conclusion
With humble heart / and hoole entencion
Whereof the king / receives such gladness
That he vuneth / might it out express
But right as fast / did his besy pain
For this journey / in haste for to ordain
And for asmoche / as the Colchos country
Enclosed was / about with a see
And that no man / how long that he strive
Without ship / thither may arryue
To his prelence / anon he did call
Famous Argus / that cowde most of all
To make a ship / and first that art yfonde
To sail with / by see / f^o land to land
The which has wrought / a ship by sotyl craft
Which was the first / that ever wawe raft
To have enter / and Argon / bare the name
Gramariens record / yet the same
That each great ship / first for that marvel
Is called so / which proudely bare her sail
As this book / does us specefye
How it byfell / forth of this nauye.
When all was ready / meyne and vytayle
They ^yde naught / but wind for to sail
And many worthy was in that company
Of noble birth / and of great allye
In that vyage / ready for to gen
Both for love / and worship of Jason
Among which / the great hercules
Of force and might / of strength pereles
And he bygette was / upon Almene
Somly fair / and womanly to seen
Of Iubiter / and that full louge agon
Taking lyknesse / of Amphitrion
Down fro the heaven / for all his deyte
He was rauysshed / through lust of her beauty
For he her loved / with heart and hole entente
And of them two / sothly by discente
Came hercules the worthy famous knight
Most reno^med / of manhood / and of might
Which in his time / was so meruaylous
So excellent / and so victoryous
That Ouyde list / record him sylue
Methamorphoseos / his famous dedys twelve
Which ben remembered / there inspecyall
In his honor / for a memoryall.
And to rehearse them / in order by and by
If ye list here / I purpose viterly
He slough Antheon / in the eyer on hight
And many geau^t / what with might and s^eyght
He outrayed / for all their lymes rude
The serpent / y^dre / he sloughe eke in pallude
And Serberus the hounde / he bond so sore
At hell gates / that he brake no more
And made him void / his venym in y^ strife.
And upward gave him / such a laxatyfe
That all the world / his brethe contagyous
Infectyd has / it was so venymous
And with o wind / he would run ascadye
He catchyd arpyes / byrdys of archadye*
And slough Centaurus / the bestes monstrous
The first Lion / he brast his house
This is to feign / when that he was slawe
Out of his skin / he has him strypt and flawe
With cruel heart / thorugh his hye renown
The golden applys / he barefro the dragone
The firye catte / he slough without more
And of Archadye / the cruel tuskye bore
And at the last / on his shuldres square
Of very might / the firmament hebare
But for that / I may not reken all
His passing dedys which ben hystoryall
Read Ouyde / and there ye shall them find
Of his tryumphes / how he makes mind
Thorugh out y^ world / how he him honor fet
And of the pylers / at gades that he set
Which Alysaundre / of macedoyne king
That was so worthy / here in his living
Rood in his conquest / as Guydolyst to write
With all his host / proudely to visyte
Beyond which / no land is habytable
Nor see to sail / sothely couenable
So far it is / beyond the Occian
That shypmen / no further no skyll can
Sibilles streyghtes / maryners it call
And the bounds / be they named eke of all
Of hercules / for he him self them set
As for marks / all other for to let
Ferther to pass / as Guy do makes mind
And the place is called / as I find
Siracenyca / as fine of his labor
Of longa / saphy / record of mine auctour.
Of this matter what more should I said
For unto Jason / I will return again
That in all haste / does him ready make
Of his uncle / when he has leave take
Toward the sea / and Hercules yfere
With all his men / anoneas ye shall here.
THe time of year / when the shene son
In his spear / was so far up run
And he was passyd / the gemyny
And has his chare / whyrlyd up so hy
Thorough the draught / of Pirous so reed
That he had made / in the crabbys heed
His mansion / and his see royal
Where hallowed is / the stondyng escynall
Of fresshe Appollo / with his golden wayne
When herd men / in heart be so feign
For the hete / to shroude them in the shade
Under these branches / and these bowys glade
When phoebus bemys / that so bright shine
Descendyd ben / right as any line
And cause the eyer / by refleccion
To be full hoote / that lusty fresshe season
When cornys gynne / in the field to sede
And the grassys / in the grene mede
Fro year to year / ben of custom mow
And on the plain / cast and leyde full low
Till the moisture / consumed be away
On holte and hethe / the merye summers day
At which time / the young knight Jason
With hercules / is to ship gone
And with them eke / as I rehearse can
Of Greeks eke many lusty man
Shypped echon / with royal apparayle
And when they were / crossyd under fail
Within the ship / which that Argus made
Which was so stau^che / it might no water lade
They began to sail / and had wind at will
The ship began break / the sturdy wawes ill
Upon the sea / and so both day and night
To colchos ward / they held the way right
Gydynge their course / by the lode sterre
Where they sail / by costs nyghe or far
For philotetes / was their alder guide
That could before / so prudently provide
Of very insyght / to cast before and se
Tempest or wind / both on land and see
Or when there should / trouble of storms fall
For he was master / plainly of them all
In shypman craft / and chose their governor
And could them warn / before of every shour
That should fall / when sterres did appear
And specially / as Guydo does us lere
This philotetes / which was no fool
Had most his sight / erecte unto the pole
His aduertence / and clear inspeccion
To the sterres / and constellacion
With the axtre / round about gone
That clerks call / the septemtryon
For the pole / ycallyd arthycus
Ever in oon / apperyth unto us
Right so in sothe / who can look aryght
Antharticus is shrouded from our sight
But to shypmen / that be discrete and wise
That list their course / prudently deuyse
Upon the sea / have suffysaunce enough
To gye their passage / by Arthourys ploughe
For it to them / is direccion
Unto the costs / of every region
With help oonly / of nedle and of stone
They may not err / what costs that they gone
For maryners that be discrete and sage
And expert be / of their lodmanage
By str^^^ge costs / for to sail far
Gynne their course / oonly by the sterre
Which that Arthur / compasses enuyron
The which cercle / and constellacion
I called is the cercle Artophilax
Who knows it / needs no more to ax
For it to shypmen / on the sterry night
Is suffysaunt / when they se his light.
And as poetis / of these poolys twain
In their books / lyketh for to feign
And in their dytees / declare unto us
Calixto^e / and Archadius
Her own sone / were Istellyfyed
In the heaven / and I deyfyed
For that June / to her had envy
With Iubiter / when she did her espy.
For which she was / into a bear turned
And for her gylt / she has in earth mourned
Till into heaven / Nason can you tell
She was translatyd / eternally to dwell
Among sterres / where as she is stalled
And vrsa mayor / is of clerks called
So as her sone / for his worthy fame
Of vria minor / beryth it the name
Of such the course / might not asterte
Philotetes / that was the most expert
Of all shypmen / that ever I herd tell
For of conning / he might bear the bell.
And when the greeks / had long be
Fordryue and cast / saylynge in the sea
Forweryed / after travail
They cast to aryue / if it would avail
Them to refresshe / and disporte in joy
Upon the bounds / of the land of Troy.
How Jason g^ynge to conquer the golden flees took Land for to refresshe him
and his felawshyp beside Troy. Ca. iiii.
When Hercules / and Jason on his hand
Out of their ship / taken have y^ land
And with them eke / their knights euerychone
That fro the sea / be to land gone
Forweryed / after their travail
And they in sothe / come to aryuayle
At Symeounte / an haven of great renown
That was a little / beside Troy town
And they were glad / to be in sykernesse
From storm and tempest / after werynesse
For they ne mente / treason harm / nor gyle
But on the stronde / to resten them a while
To hyndre no wight / of no manner age
Nor in that isle / for to do damage
To man nor be / where ever that they go
But for to abide / there a day or two
Them to refresshe / and repair anon
When that the rage / of the sea were gone
And whiles they / upon the stronde lay
They no thing did / but disporte and play
And bathe and wasshe them / in the fresshe ryuere
And drunk waters / that were soote and clear
That sprange like cristall / in the cold well
And took right naught / but it were to selle
It was no thing / in their entencion
Unto no wight / to do offension
For to moleste / or grieve any wight
But the order / of fortunes might
Has ever envy / that men live in ese
Whose coursenhasteth / unawarely to dysese
For she was cause / god wot causeles
This gery fortune / this lady recheles
The blind goddess / of transmutacion
To turn her whele / by reuolucion
To make Troyens / unjustly for to wene
That greeks were / aryued them to tene
So that the cause / of this suspicion
Has many brought / unto destruction
Full many worthy / of kings and of princes
Thorughout the world / rekened in prouynces
Were by this sclaundre / unto myscheif brought
For thing alas / that was never thought
For it was cause / and occasiowne
That this cite / and this royal town
Distroyed was / as it is plainly found
Whose walls hye / were beat down to ground
And many a man / and many a worthy knight
Where slain there / and many lady bright
Was wedowe made / by duresshe of this werre
As it is kouthe / and reported far
And many maid / in grene and tender age
Be left were sool / in that great rage
Behind their fadres / alas it fall should
And for no thing / but that fortune would
Show her might / and her crueltee
In vengeance taking / upon this cytee.
Alas that ever / so worthy of estate
Should for little / fall at the debate
When it is gone / it is not like to staunche
For of graffynge / of a little branch
Full sturdy trees / grow up full often
Who clymbeth hye / may not fall soft
And of sparks / that be of sight small
Is fire engendered / that deuoureth all
And a gnast first / of little hate
Encauseth flawme / of contek and debate
And of envy / to sprede a broad full far
And thus alas / in realms mortal werre
Is first bygonne / as men may read and se
Of a spark / of little enmytee
That was not stau^chyd first / wha^ it was go^ne
For when the fire / is so fer yronne
That it embraseth / hertes by hatrede
To make them brenne / hoote as any glede
On other party / thorughe his cruel tene
There is no staunche / but sharp swerdes kene
The which alas / consumes all and slethe
And thus the fine / of enmyte is death
Though the gynnynge / be but casuell
The frete abiding / is passyngly cruel
To void realms / of rest peace and joy
As it fill whylom / of this worthy Troys
It does me weep / of this caas sudden
For every wight / ought to complain
That little gylt / should have such vengeance
Except parcaas / thorugh gods pourueaunce
That this myscheyf / should after be
Following parchaunce / of great felycyte
For Troy brought / unto destruction
Was the gynnynge / and occasion
In mine Auctour / as it is specyfyed
That worthy Rome / was after edyfyed
By the ofsprynge / of worthy Eneas
Whylom fro Troy / when he exyled was
The which Rome / read and ye may se
Of all the world / was head and cheyf cite
For the passing / famous worthynesse
And eke wha^ Troy / was brought in distress
And the walls cast and broke down
It was in cause / that many regyowne
Begone was / and many great cytee
For this Troyan / this manly man Enee
By sundry sees / began so long sail
Till of fortune / he came into y^tayle
And wan that land / as books tell us
With whom was eke / his sone Askanius
That after Ence / does by line succeed
The land of Italye / justly to possede
And after him / his sone Syluyus
Of whom came Brute / so passyngly famous
After whom / if I shall not feign
Whylom this land / called was bretayne
For he of geauntes / thorugh his manhood wan
This noble y^le / and it first began.
From Troy also / with this ylke Enee
Came worthy francus / a lord of hye degree
Which upon Rome / to increase his renown
Bylded in his time / a fall royal town
The which sothely / his honor to auaunce
After his name / he made call france
And thus began / as I understand
The name first / of that worthy land
And Authenor / departing fro Troyens
Began first the cite / of venycyens
And Sycanus / within alytell while
Began enhabyte / the land of Cecyle
And after partynge / of this Sycanus
His worthy brother / called Syculus
So as I find / reigned in that isle
And after him / it called was Cecyle.
But Eneas / is to Tuscy gone
It to enhabyte / with people right anon
And in Cecyle / he Naplys first began
To which full many / Neopolytane
Longs this day / full rich and of great might
And Dyomedes / the noble worthy knight
When Troy was fall / with his toures fair
And to his reygne / he cast to repair
His lyeges began to feyne a quarrel
Against him / and shope them to be rebel
And of malys / and conspiracy own
They him withhelde / both scepter and crown
Their deuty / and old lygeaunce
And him deny / truth and obeyssaunce
Wherefore anon / so as books tell
With a^l his folk / he went for to dwell
Unto Calabre / and began it to possede
And there the knights / of this Dyomede
That tro Troy / have him thither sewed
To form of birds / were anon tra^smewed
By Circes craft / daughter of the son
And in the air / to flee an one they gonne
And called ben / in ysydre as I read
Among greeks / brydes of Dyomede
But as some books / of them bear witness
This change was made / by venus y^ goddess
Of wrath yt she had / to this worthy knight
Oonly for the saw him ones fight
With Eneas / her own sone dear
At which time / as they faughte yfere
And Dyomede / with a darte I ground
Can ame at him / a deedly mortal wound.
This mother venus / began anon him shroude
Under a sky / and a mystye cloud
To save him / that time fro myschaunce
And for this skyl / venus took vengaunce
Into birds to turn / his meyne
And in that form / from year to year they fle
Unto his tomb / where as he is grave
So upon him / a mind they have
That of custom / for a remembrance
Aryte they hold / and an obseruaunce
At his exequyes / these brydes euerychone
A days space / and thennys not ne gone
And over more / as it to them is dew
They love greeks / and platly they eschew
Latynes all / for naught that may betyde
For they present / anon they fice aside
And each from other / as books us assure
These birds know / oonly of nature
Greeks / and latynes / kyndely assonder
When they them se / the which is such a wonder
Unto my wit / that I can not aspye
The causes hid / of such sorcerye
But well I wot / though my wit be blent
That root of all / was falls enchauntement
But of our faith / we ought to defye
Such apparences / showed to the eye
Which of the fend / is but illusion
Thereof no more / and thus when Troy town
Euersed was / and y^ brought to naught
Full many cite / was ybyld / and wrought.
And many land / and many rich town
Was edefyed / by the occasiowne
Of this werre / as ye have herd me tell
Which to declare / now I may not dwell
From point to point / like as books said
For to Jason / I will resort again
That landyd is / with worthy hercules
At Symeounte / the haven that he ches
As I have told / to rest them and comfort
And for not else / but oonly to disporte
But to the king / reygnynge in Troy town
That was that time called lamedowne
Of falls envy / reported was and told
How certain greeks / were of heart bold
To entrete his land / y^ which they not knew
Well arrayed / in a vessel new
Which to aryue / had no license
And them purpose / for to done offense
By lyklyheed / and his land to grieve
For they of pride / without any leave
Or sauf conduyte / have the stronde ytake
And such maystryes / on the land they make
As in their power / were all manner thing
Having no regard / plainly to the king.
Of his estate / take they none head
Of such strangers / great is to dread
If men be laches / outher neclygent
Fully to wete / what is their intent
But forth prolonge / and no peril cast
Such sudden thing / would be wist as fast
And not differred / till the harm be do
It were wysdom / that it were se to
Men may to long / suffer and abide
Of neclygence / for to let slide
For to enquere / of their governance
This was the speech / of the dalyaunce
Eueryche to other / by reuelaciowne
In every street / thorugh Troy town
Some rownynge / and some spoke a broad
And this speech / so long there a bode
From one to another / sothely that the sown
Reported was / to king Lamedowne
As ye have herd / the which of wylfulnesse
Without counsel / or a vysynesse
To hastily / maked has his sonde
To wit / how they were hardy for to land
Beside his leave / of presumpcion
Wherefore he bad / in conclusion
Without a bode / soon to remewe
Or finally / they should not eschew
To be compelled / maugre who says nay
And so the king / upon a certain day
In haste has sent / his embassatoure
Unto Jason / of greeks gouernoure
That nouther thought / harm nor villanye
But Innocent / with his company
Disportyd him / endlonge the stronde
And ever has do / sithe he came to land
And of the charge / that he on him laid
And word by word / to Jason how he said
As in effect / with every circumstaunce
This was the so^me / plainly in substance.
How king Lamedone of Troyesent a messenger unto Jason / for to bid him avoid
his Country / and of their langage between them. Capitulo. v.
THe wise worthy / and famous of renown
The mighty king / ye noble Lamedown
Has unto you / his message sent
Of which theffect / as in sentement
Is this in sothe / that he has marvel
Into his land / of your aryuayle
Bringing with you / greeks not afewe
And have no conduyte / for you for to show
Proteccion plainly / nor license
In preiudyce / of his magnyfycence
Wherefore he has / on me the charge laid
And will to you / that it be platly said
That ye anon / without more delay
Without noise / or any more affraye
Of Troy land / the bonds that ye leave
Or you and youres / he casts for to grieve
And better it is / with ease to depart
Than of folly / your lives to Ieoparte
In any wise / for lack of prouydence
Against his will / to make resystence
Outher of pride / or of wylfulnesse
For to be bold / without a vysynesse
To interrupte / his felycyte
For he desires / in tranquyllyte
To hold his reygne / without perturbaunce
In whose parsone / is made such allyaunce
At wene his manhood / and Royal mageste
That they will not suffer / none of no degree
To enpugne / his quyete / in any manner wise
Wherefore I counsel / as ye seem wise
To take heed / unto that I seye
And his bidding / not to disobeye.
Lest ye offend / his knyghtly excellence
For ye shall find / in experyence
Without feynynge / sothe all that I tell
Take heed therefore / I may no longer dwell
From point / to point / sith ye be wise and sage
For this is hool / the effect of my message.
When Jason herd / of the messagere
These words all / he began change there
And kept him close / with sobre countenance
And was not / hasty for Irene greuaunce
For no rancoure / he caughte of his tale
Save in his face / he began to wex pale
Long abiding / or aughte he would said
And or he spoke / any word again
Unto him that fro the king was sent
He began disclose / the so^me of his intent
Unto his folk / stondynge round about
For unto them / he discured out
The message / hool / first when he abreyde
And word by word / thus to them he seyde.
Syres he says / to you be it know
Take heed I pray / both hye and low
How Lamedone / that is king of Troy
Has sent to us / a wonderful enuoye
Chargynge in haste / to hye out of his land
And axeth how we / upon the stronde
For to aryue / had hardynesse
Without leave / se there his gentylnesse
And his fredom / the which is not alyte
How like a king / that he can him quyte
Unto strangers / that enter in his isle
For naught god wot / but for a little while
Them to refresshe / and to depart anoon
Like as ye can / record / euerychon
And bear witness / all and some
Alas fredom / where is it now become.
Where is manhood / and gentylnesse also
Which in a king / together both two
Should of custom / have their restyng place
And where is honor / that should also embrace
Alordes heart / which of kyngly right
Of manly fredome / with all his full might
Should strangers / refresshe and recomforte
That afterward / they might of him report.
Larges expert / manhood / and gentyllesse
That they have / found in his worthynesse
For if noblesse / were of his allye
And fredom / eke knyt with his regallye
So as longs / to honor of a king
He should have charged / first of all thing
His worthy lyeges / with all that might please
To have showed / the comfort and the ease
With all their might / and their besy cure
Unto strangers / that of a venture
Were in the sea / driven and dismayed
And of our comfort / not be evil apayed
For if that he / in any caas semblable
Outher by fortune / that is varyable
By sort or hap / that may not withstand
Aryued had / into greeks land
More honestly / like to his degree
He should of us / have received be
Like as it longs / unto gentrye
But sith that he / for ought I can espy^
Has fredom / honor / and humanyte
At ones made / out of his court to fle
Chose dishonor / and let worship gone
There is no more / but we shall every chone
That he has chose / help to fulfill
When power shall not / belyke his will
This is to say / and sothe it shall be found
That his deed / shall on him self rebounde
Sith of malys / he has this work begone
Perauenture / or the somer son
The sodyak / has thryes gone about
For let him trust / and no thing be in doubt
we shall him serve / with such as he has sought
For if I live / it shall be dear a bought
All be thereof / I set as now no tide
And in his land / I will no longer bide
Till I have leyser / better to soiourne
And with yt word / he began anon to turn
With manly face / and a stern chere
Suddenly / unto the messagere
That fro the king / was unto him sent
And in this wise / he shows his intent.
My friend quod he / I have well understand
The message hool / that thou took on hand
Of thy king / to bring unto us
Right now unawarely / and sith it stondeth thus
That I have his menynge / euerydele
From point to point / and understand it well
For word by word / I have it plainly contained
And the gifts / that we have received
On his behalf / in our great need
I will remember / and take of it right good head
To every thing / that thou haste us brought
For trust well / that I forgete it naught
But emprente / it well suerly in my mind
And with all this / how goodly that we find
The great bounte / in all manner thing
Within this land / of Lamedone the king
His welcomynge / and his great chere
And goodly sonde / that thou bryngest here
Not according / not to our intent
For god well wot / that we never meant
Harm unto him / nor plainly no damage
To none of his / of no manner age
And there upon / the gods inmortall
That of kind / ben celestyall
Unto record / with all mine heart I take
And touching this / my borowes I them make
In wytnessynge / we meant none offense
Ne took not / as by violence
Within his realm / of woman child nor man
And so thou may report / if thou can
But for that / we driven in the sea
Compelled were / of necessyte
For to aryue / as thou haste hard me said
Oonly to rest us / here upon the plain
Without more / unto a certain day
And afterward / to hold forth our way
Upon our journey / and make no taryenge
Like as thou may / record to thy king
And say him eke / he shall the time ^e
That he paraunter / shall mow thanked be
When time comes / by us or by some other
Go forth thy way / and say him thus my brother
And than anon / as Ialon was in pes
The manly knight / the worthy hercules
Wha^ he had herd / this thing fro poy^t to point
He was anon brought / in such disioynt
Of hasty rancoure / and of sudden Ire
The which his heart / almost set a fire
That suddenly / as he abreyde a bake
Of hye disdeyne / even thus he spoke
With chere askoyne / unto the messagere
And said felawe / be no thing in were
Of our abiding / but be right well certain
That are Tytan / his bemes reyse again
We shall depart / and to ship gone
That of our men / shall not leave one
Within this land / and god toforne to morrow
And there upon / have here my faith to borowe
For we no longer / shall hold here soioure
For else where / we shall make our retoure
To morrow erely / in the dawning
Upon pain of repref / and so go say thy king
And or three year / if god us grant life
Maugre who grutcheth / or make any strife
Unto this land / we shall again return
And cast / anchor a while / to soiourne
Take heed thereof / and note well the time
A new change / shall follow of this pryme
And than his power / shall not so large streche
Of his sauf conduyte / little shall we reche
I say the platly / as is our intent
We will not have / unto his maundement
But little regard / and we that day abide
For taking leave / shall be set a side
Because he has / begone a play
Which we shall quyte / by god if that I may
That turn shall into his own shame
And spare not / to say thy king the same.
This messager / than began again replye
And said sir ye may not deny
Of honest / my message to declare
Auyse you / for I will not spare
The kings sonde / plainly for to tell
And where so be / ye list to go or dwell
Ye may yet chese / who so be leef or loathe
Ye have no cause / with me to be wroth
For it sit not / unto your worthynesse
If ye take heed / by way of gentyllesse
Or manassynge / such arowes for to shete
For more honest it were / your thretynge to let
And keep secret / till ye be at your large
For certaynely / no parcel of my charge
Is to strive / with you or debate
But better it is / by times than to late
That ye beware / for harm that might fall
And for my part / I say unto you all
It were pytee / that ye destroyed were
Or any man hyndre / should or dear
So worthy parsones / in any manner wise
Which ben as lykly / to be discrete and wise
And lest with words / as now I do you grieve
I say no more / I take of you my leave.
THe night ypassed / at spri^gyng of y^ day
When that the ^arke / with a blessed lay
Began to salve / the lusty rows read
Of phoebus chare / there fresshely sprede
Upon the bordure / of the oryente
And Aurora / of heart and hool entente
With the swetnesse / of her silver shoures
Bedewed had / the fresshe somer flowers
And made the rose / with new bawme flete
The soote lylye / and the margarete
For to unclose / their tender leaves white
Oppressed hertes / with gladness to delight
That drery were / before of myghtes tene
And honey souklys / among the busshes grene
Enbawmed / had / enuyron all the air
Long or Tytan / began make his repeyre
With the bryghtnesse / of his bemys merye
For to rejoice all our emysperye
For long aforne / are he did arise
This worthy Jason / in full hasty wise
And his fellow / hercules also
I chargyd have / their shypmen have ado
To hale up anchor / and them ready make
And bad in haste / every man to take
The right way / unto ship anoon
For in sothenesse / this manly man Jason
Thought he was / not stuffed of meyne
To begin a werre / on Troy cite
For he was not / shortly to conclude
Egall in noumbre / nor in multitude
As for that time / a werre to begin
It was not lykly / that he should win
Victory as tho / for they were but a few
And it is not wholesome / a man to hew
Above his heed / when it is over hye
Lest the chyppes / will fall in his eye
Wherefore of frygye / they leave the costs blyue
They drew up sail / the ship began to drive
The wind was good / the gods favorable
Fortune their friend / though she be varyable
And thus to Colchos / sauf they ben I come
And unto land / both all and some
They ben aryued / in a little space
For in the sea / they have found grace
Of Neptunus / that caused them as blyue
As I said ere / at Colchos for to aryue
NOw in this isle / and this little land
y^ Colchos hyghte / ye shall understand
How that there was / a ryall cheyf cite
In all that reygne / most of dignyte
Of worthynesse / of richesse / and of fame
And Iachonytes / that time it bare the name
Cheuest of all / to speak of building
And streets large / and coryous housynge
And therewith all / dyched well without
Strong walled / and toured round about
Of huge heyght / and above batayled
Magecolde also / lest they were assailed
With many paleys / stately and royal
For there the sete was / most pryncypall
The king to abide / better than else where
And that time / it happed him be there
And he was called / Cethes as I read
Full reno^med / of knyghode and manhede
And about / him a well besene meyne
Like as was sitting / unto his degree
And every where / lands enuyrowne
The same spradde / of his hye renown
And all about / this mighty cheyfcytee
Where as Cethes / held his royal see
Were fresshe ryuers / of which the water clean
Like cristall shone / again the son shene
Fair playnes / as Guydo bears witness
And holsom hills / full of lustynesse
And many lay / and many lusty well
And there were eke / mine aucto^r can you tell
Full many a park / full fair and fresshe to seen
And many wode / and many medowe grene
With sundry flowers / among y^ herbs meynt
Which on their stalk / nature has depeynt
With sundry hewes / within and without
After the season / yt somer came about
For fysshynge / foulynge / and haukynge also
For venerye / and huatynge both two
The place was / I^ly delytable
Of corn / and greyne / passyngly greable
And plenteuous / in all manner thing
For there men herd / the birds fresshely sing
In time of year / in their armonye
That the noise / and soote melodye
On fresshe branches / full delycyous
Rejoice would / these folks amerous
Whom loves bronde / had fyred to the heart
And adawen / of their pains sinerte
That certaynely / when that grene vere
Ypassed were / aye fro year to year
And May was come / the monthe of gladness
And fresshe flora / of flowers Emperesse
Had cladde the soil / new at her deuyse
This noble place / was like paradyse
And Ceres / goddess / of largess and foyson
Such plente gave / unto that regyon
Of flesh / of fysshe / wine vytayle and corn
That the lycoure / of her full horn
Upon that land / so began rain and snow
That all astates / both high and low
Lad their life / in soueraygne suffysaunce
With all that nature / cowde or might auaunce
This little isle / with her gifts great
Like as toforne / ye have herd me treat
For there was plente / and there was habundau^ce
And there was all / that might do pleasaunce
To any heart / and all co^modytee
And so besell / that to this Cytee
Jason is come / and with him hercules
And after them / follows all the pres
Full well arrayed / and ryally be said
Army senclosyd together / twain and twain
A people chose / as it were for the nones
And therewith all / of brawnes and of bones
Eueryche of them / of making and facyon
Full well complete / by proporcyon
Young of age / and of good stature
Of countenance sad / and full demure
That every wyghte / had great plesaunce
To se the manner / of their governance
So young so fresshe / hardy and meke also
And all at ones / they to the paleys go
With such a chere / that eueryche has disporte
To se the manner / of their noble port
So gentylmanly / they demenyd were
That the people / began prese every where
Tose these strangers / like the greeks gyse
Demene them self / in so thryfty wise
And of desire / the people ne would ceesse
About them / to gader and empreesse
And to enquere / what they might be
That of new / with such ryalte
Ben suddenly entered / into the town
Thus eueryche would / with his felawe rowne
They were so rude / to stare and to gase
To gape and look / as it were on a mase
This townysshe folk / do so commonly
Of every thing / that falls suddenly
But how that Cethes / like a worthy king
When that he herd / first of their coming
Receives them / and holy the matere
If that ye list / an one ye shall it here.
When y^ ye king / has sothly understand
How the greeks / come were to land
And how Jason / was also therewith all
Borne by dyssent / of the blood royal
Of Thesalye / and lykly to be heir
If he by grace / have again repeyre
The auentures / achyeued of Colchos
The king anon / out of his see aroos
Of gentyllesse / in all the haste he may
In goodly wise / to mete them on the way
And them receives / with chere full benynge
And unto them / an one he does assygne
His officers / to awayte them night and day
Chargynge them / in all manner way
That what so ever / may to them do ese
Or any thing / that may them queme or plese
That they it have / in foyson and plente
Eueryche of them / like to his degree
Thus he commanded / in all manner thing
And than anon / this noble worthy king
As he that was / of fredom a myroure
Thorughe many halle / and many rich toure
By many turn / and many diverse way
By many gree made / of marbyll graye
Has them conveyed / a full easy pas
Till he them brought / there his ^hambre was
Where he with them / held his dalyaunce
And there anon / with every circumstaunce
Of manly fredom / he made to them chere
And in his chamber / englased bright and clear
That shone full shene / with gold and with asure
Of many image / that was there in pycture
He has commanded / to his officers
Oonly in honor of them / that were strangers
Sp^ces and wine / and after that anoon
The young fresshe / the lusty man Jason
As fast began / by license of the king
For to declare / the cause of this coming
But first the king / with great tyaltee
Assendyd is / into his royal see
Clothes of gold / hanged enuyron
After the custom / of that regyon
That to behold / it was a noble sight
Stondynge about / many a worthy knight
And many squyre / and many gentylman
Full well besene / and the king right than
Unto Jason / stondynge in presence
Co^maundyd has / of his magnyfycence
With Hercules / to sytte down beside
And Jason / than no longer list abide
Of his coming / the cause for to show
The effect of which / was this in words few
Save Jason / are he his tale began
Full well auysed / and chered like a man
Conceived has / and noted wonder well
From point to point / his matter euerydell
And not forgot a word / in all his speech
But even like as rethoryk / does teache
He began his tale / so by craft conueye
To make the king / to that he would seye
Condescende / and rather to enclyne
For to assente / that he might fine
Of his coming / the knyghtly hye empryse
Thus word by word / as I shall here deuyse.
RIght worthy prince / present i^ this place
Oonly with supporte / of your hye grace
And your goodness / most excellent and dygne
With pacyence / of your favor benyngne
Displease it not / that I may say and show
And declare / with words but a few
The fynall ground / and cause of my coming
So that ye list / which ben so noble a king
In goodly wise / without more offense
Benyngly / to give audyence
To my request / and that ye not disdeyne
Goodly to grant / that I may atteyne
In this y^le / if it may avail
The slees of gold / freely for to assail
As the gods / in this adventure
List to ordain / for my fatal eure
In whom lies all / plainly and fortune
For to govern things / in comune
In were and peace / conquest and victory
And of armies / the renown and glory
Discomfyture / and bringing to outraunce
All lies in them / to hyndre or to auaunte
Again whose might / no mortal man may ches^
But for all this / where I win or lose
Or life or death / befyne of my labor
If that ye list / to do me this favor
To give me leave / and no more delay
I am accorded / fully for to assaye
Like as the statute / makes mencyon
Me list to make / none excepcyon
Upon no side / favor for to find
But as the rytys / plainly make mind
What ever fall / I shall them under fonge
Lowly besechynge / that ye not prolonge
My purpose now / nor make no delay
But of your grace / set me a day
Mine empryse / that I may achyeue
For mine abode / stant upon your leave
Seyth but one word / of granting at y^ lest
And than I have / the fine of my request.
And when the king / had herd ceryously
The intent of Jason / said so manfully
He stynt alyte / and kept him close a while
Till at the last / he goodly began to smyle
Toward Jason / and said unto him thus
Jason quod he / though thou be desirous
To vnderfonge / this passing hye empryse
My counsel is / like as I shall deuyse
Full prudently / for to cast aforne
The mortal peryle / or that thou be lorne
For in this thing / there is a law set
Bychauntement / that may not belette
Nor remedyed / for favor nor for mede
For death in sothe / who so takes head
Is the guerdon / platly or they twynne
O fall yt cast them / the flees of gold to win
For help is none / in manhood nor fortune
The streyghte / way is so Importune
So dreadful eke / and so full of rage
That save death / there is no passage
Of victory / the palm to conquer
For sothly Jason / as I shall the lere
Founded of old / by meruaylous workynge
Be the statutes / of this mortal thing
So sore bound / under my regalye
That the rygour / I may not modefye
Wherefore Jason / or thou this thing at tame
Lest afterward / on me were laid the blame
Of thy lesynge / or destruction
Of feythfull heart / and true entencion
I warn the / my self for to quyte
So that no man / justly shall me wit
Though thou of youth / and of wylfulnesse
Thy life destroy / without a vysynesse
Sith Jason of this perylous caas
From point to point / have told the all y^ caas
Be now auysed / and put no fault in me
For the surplus / freely lies in the
Of all this thing / sithe thou may chese
And where so be / that thou win or lose
No man to me / it justly may arecte
For the law / that mars him self set
No mortal man / of dew right may pass
For hye or low / get noon other grace
Than the gods list / for him ordeyne
What ever he be / that cast him to darreyne
This diverse thing / most furyous of dread
Wherefore Jason / how ever that thou speed
I have to the / openly declared
Holy the peryle / and for favor spared
As fer in sothe / as reason will and right
For thou wotest well / it lies not in my might
For to declare / or any man to let
That of manhood / knyghtly cast to set
Upon this thing / as thou haste herd me tell
What should Ilenger / in this matter dwell
It were but vain / for now thou know all
Beware of her / that tourneth as a ball
For at this time / thou gettest no more of me
Do as thou list / I put the choys in the
And with that word / the king rose up anon
Upon the time / when he should gone
Unto his mete / and Jason by his side
As ye shall here / if ye list abide.
THe time aprocheth / and began to neygh fast
That officers / full besely them cast
To make ready / with all their full cure
And in the halle / the bordes for to cure
For by the dyall / the hour they began to mark
That phoebus shouthward / was raised i^ his arc
So hye a lofte / that it drew to noone
That it was time / for the king to gone
Unto his mete / and enter into halle
And Cethes than / with his lords all
And with his knights / about him euerychon
With Hercules / and also with Jason
Is set to mete / in his royal see
And every lord / like to his degree
But first of all / this worthy man Jason
Assygned was / by the king anoon
For to sytte / at his own board
And hercules / that was so great a lord
Was set also / fast by his side
And the marshall / no longer list abide
To assygne estates / where they should be
Like as they were / of hye or low degree
And after that / on scaffolde hye a lofte
The noise began loud / and no thing sof^e
Both of trompers / and of claryoners
And there with all / the noble officers
Full thryftely / served have the halle
Like as the season / that time did fall
With all deyntes / that may rekened be
That sothfastly / the foyson and plente
Of kyngly fredom / unto hye and low
So fulsomly / began to reygne and snow
That thorugh y^ hall / was y^ manhood preysed
Of the king / and his renown raised
That can his gestes / sothely for to sye
When that him list / chere and fes^ey
So like a king / and in so thryfty wise
With all deynte / that man can deuyse
For at this feste / and solempnyte
The greeks might / the great nobley see
Of king Cethes / and the worthynesse
And by report thereof / bear witness
Where so they come / after all their live
I want conning / by order to discryue
Of every course / the dyuersytees
The strange sewes / and the sotyltees
That were that day / served in that place
Have me excused / though I lightly pass
Though I can not / all in order said
Mine English / is to rude and eke to plain
For to endyte / of so hye a thing
But forth I will / rehearse how the king
To show his gestes / his nobley over all
Has for his daughter / sent in special
And bad she should / forth anoon be brought
The which in sothe / though men had sought
This world through out / I do you plain assure
Men might a found / no fayrer creature
More womanly of port / nor manner
Nor more demure / nor sadder of her chere
Whose beauty was / not lykely for to fade
And when she came / the greeks for to glade
The halle in sooth / she walks up and down
Of woman head / and pure affeccy own
To make chere / unto these gestes new
And thus Medca / with her rosen hew
And with fresshenesse / of the lyllye white
So enter meddled / of kind by delight
That nature made / in her face spr^de
So egally the white with the read
That the medlynge / in conclusion
So was ennewed / by proporcion
That finally / excess was there none
Of one nor other / for both two in one
So joined were / long to endure
By the emperesse / that called is nature
For she her made / like to her deuyse
That to behold / it was a paradyse
In very sothe / both to one and all
Of old and young / sitting in the hall
Thereto she was / as by succession
Borne to be heir / of that regyon
After her fader / by descent of line
If she abide / and dure after his fine
Sith he ^e had / by right to succeed
Noon heir male / that I can of read
She was also / the book makes mencyon
Were unto years / of discrecyon
Able for age / married for to be
And not withstondynge / also eke that she
Was of beauty / and of womanheed
One of the fairest that I can of reed
Yet none of both / have her youth let
That to clergy / her desire was set
So passyngly / that in special
In all the arts / called lyberall
She was expert / and knowing at the best
It was her ure / to konne what her lest
Of such a woman / herd I never tell
At Elycon / she drank so of the well
That in her time / was there none semblable
I found in sothe / ne none that was so able
To conceive by study / and doctrine
And of natures / dispute and termyne
She koude also / and the causes find
Of all things / formed as by kind
She had in learning / so her time spent
That she knew / of the fyrmament
The true course / and of the sterres all
And by their meuynge / what that should fall
So expert she was / in astronomye
But most she wrought / by nygromanyce
With exorsismes / and coniurisons
And used also / to make illusions
With her charms said / in sundry wise
And with rytes / of diverse sacrifyse
Encens / and rechelys / cast into the fire
To show things / like to her desire
With gootes horns / and with milk and blood
When the moon was / equat and stood
In the fyfthe / or syxte house
And was fortuned / with lokynge gracious
To chese an hour / that were conuenyent
And fortunat / by enchauntement
To make and work / sundry apparences
So well she knew / the heavenly influences
And aspectes both / wroth and glade
For she by them / all her things made
That appartene / to such experymentes
For when her list / by her enchauntementes
She cowde make / the wyndes for to blow
To thondre and light / and to hayle and snow
And frese also / to grieve men with pain
And suddenly she cowde / make to rain
Show what weder / that her list to have
And gasten men / with sodeyne earth quaue
And turn the day / unawarely unto night
And than anon / make the son bright
Show his bemes / full persynge and full shene
With golden horns / to void nyghtes tene
And reyse floodes / with many dreadful wawe
And when her list / she cowde them eft wtdrawe
Eke young trees / to sere root and rynde
And afterward / make them again kind
With lusty branches / blosme and budde new
Also in winter / with flowers flresshe of hew
Array the earth / and tappte him in grene
That to behold / a Joy it was to seen
With many color / showing full diverse
As white and read / grene ynde and pers
The dayesye / with her rich crown
And other flowers / that winter made frown^
Upon their stalk / fresshely for to appear
And suddenly / with a dedely chere
She cowde somer / into winter turn
Causynge the day / with mystes for to morn
And old men / she cowde make young
And eft again / or any here was spronge
She cowde them show / both in heed and berde
Full hoar and graye / in craft / she so lerede
And trees with fruit / she cowde eke make bare
Of rynde and leef / to do men on them stare
Clypse the moon / and the bright son
Or naturelly / they had their course yronne
To them apropred / which they may not pass
For if that Tytan / his course by kind trase
When he meueth / under clyptyk line
The clypse not follow / as auctours list diffyne
So that there be / by their description
Of both twain / full coniunccion
And that the son / with his bemes reed
Have his dwelling / in the dragon heed
And the moon / be set eke in the tail
As by nature / than it may not fail
That there must fall / eclips of very need
In sundry books / like as ye may read
Because of certain / intersecacions
Of diverse clerks / and reuolucions
That maked ben / in the heaven a lofte
Which cause us / for to fail often
Of the fresshe / comfortable stremes
That be to us shadde / from phoebus bemes
For the moon / has made dyuysion
By this sudden / interposicion
That of our sight / the stremes visuall
May not behold / nor I seen at all
Nor to our lust / fully comprehend
How Appollo / is in his chare chyuende
As we were wont / aforehande for to se
But of all this / the great tholome
King of Egypt / tells the great causes why
Within his book / full compendyously
Both of eclyps / and coniunccion
And why they fall / by naturell mocion
But of Medee / though this clerk suyde
To increase her name / upon every side
Lest in his fables / such things tell
Though he of poets / was the spring and well
Yet god forbede / ye should give credence
To such feynynge / or do so high offense
Sith of nature / must be denied
All such affermynge / and also be diffyed
Of every christian / steadfast in believe
For certainly / it would hyghly grieve
Our conscience / in any wise wene
Against kind / which is so hye a queen
That any wight / orlyuynge creature
Should have power / I do you plain ^^^ure
So cursyd things / supersticious
To do or work / to kind contraryous.
For god almighty / Judge of Iuges all
Has set a law / the which may not fall
Among planettes / perpetuelly to endure
Before ordained / in his eternal cure
The which may not / as clerks list termyne
Upon no side / bow / nor declyne
But as they were / from discord or debate
Eternally yformed / and create
Thorugh the finger / of his sapyence
Always / to meue in their intellygence
Like as they be / to his lordshyp bound
For never yet / ne was eclyps yfounde
The moon not being / in coniunccion
As I have told / save in the passion
The which eclips / was against kind
Nature her knot / that time did unbind
When gods sone / starfe upon the roode
The son of life / was dyrked for our good
When heaven and earth / with hye compunccion
Have signs showed / of Lamentacion
By earth quaues / light turned to dyrkenesse
And deed bodies / upward began them dress
From their tombs / again from death to live
Stone and rock / a sonder ganne ryue
In the temple / the veyll was kut a two
And signs many / were yshewed tho
That for wonder / and tokens meruaylous
The great worthy / Dyonysyous
Which at Athenes / as clerks of him write
Was called in scolys / Ariopagyte
That when he saw / this noble famous clerk
The bright day / suddenly so derke
All though he were apaynym / in tho days
And was infect / with rightes of their lays
As he that was most cheyf / and pryncypall
Of philosophers / for to reken all
Yet that time / astoned in his mind
Said platly / outher the god of kind
Suffers the death / outher out of doubt
This round world / which is so large about
Shall Be dissolved / and ybrought to naught
By sudden change / hasty as a thought.
By this clergy / he knew no better skyll
For god may / all change at his will
And has power of such coaccion
Under whose might / and disposicion
Is law of kind / constreyned sothe to seye
From point to point / lowely to obey
In every thing / that him list ordeyne
Of elements / he may the course restreyne
As holy wryt / witnesses ye may se
How at request / of worthy Iosue
The bright son / stood at Gabaon
Adays space / in one degree and shon
Showing his token / to his true knight
Finally / for to give him light
That he might / by his hye prowess
His cruel foon / manfully oppress
When that he faught / this knight this Iosue
With kings five / reygnynge in Amoree
So long last / the pursuit and the chaas
Till they were take / and for their trespaas
Dempt to be deed / the Bible can you tell
Now sith that god / thus hyghly list fulfylle
Of his knight / request and orison
What wonder was / though in the passion
Of criste Ihesu incarnat, for our sake
The son bemes / though they wex blake
Sith he has lordshyp of planettes all
And as him list / needs it must fall
For of Medea / though Ouydius
In his fables / reherseth and write thus
As he that list / her name to exalte
Yet from the truth / some while he does alte
All be she were / a passing sorceresse
And ferthest name / of any chaunteresse.
(...) I will pass over / again to my matere
And how she came / to mete / ye shall here
When her fader / had for her sent
She came anon / at his commandment
But or she came / I find that tofore
For to make her beauty / seem more
In her closet / she took her best array
For to increase / all that ever she may
Natures work / with royal apparayle
For this women / gladly will not fail
Wha^ they of beauty / have plenteuous largess
It to embellysshe / they do their business
With rich attire / upon every side
I fought be mysse / they can it close and hyde
For all the foul / shall covertly be wryed
That no defaute / outward be espied.
But she was both / fair / and well besayne
And in her port / so womanly certain
That her coming / gladeth all the halle
For it was joy / unto one and all
To se the manner / tho of her entree
To whom her fader / bad to take her see
Beside Jason / him for to disporte
Of womanhode / and to recomforte.
But oo alas / here lacked hye prudence
Discrete auyse / of inward prouydence
Wisdom also / with perell cast before
To trust a maid / of tender years bore
Of unhappy fond / wylfulnesse
For this king / of his gentylnesse
Commanded has / to his confusion
To his dishonor / and destruction
His own donghter / borne to be his heir
That was also / so womanly and feyre
So suddenly down / for to discende
Consydred not / the myscheif of the end
Alas why durst he / in her you the affye
To make her sytte / of his curtesye
Where she might / by casuell mocion
Full lightly catch / or have occasion
To do amysse / alas why did he so
Why list him not / take heed thereto
Nor to auerte / in his discrecion
Wisely to cast / before in his reason
The unware change / that is in womanhede
Which every wise man / ought for to dread
For who was ever / yet so mad or wood
That ought of reason / konne a right his good
To give faith / or hastily credence
To any woman / without experyence
In whom is nouther / trust nor sykernesse
They ben so double / and full of brytylnesse
That it is hard / in them to assure
For unto them / it longs of nature
From their birth to have allyaunce
With doubleness / and with varyaunce
Their hertes be so freell / and unstable
Namely in youth / so meuynge and mutable
That so as clerks / of them list to endyte
All be that I am / sorry for to write
They say / that change and mutabylyte
Apropred ben / to femynyte
This is affermed of them / that were full sage
And specially / while they be tender of age
In their wexynge / and when yt they be young
Whose heart accords / full selde with her tongue
For if the truth / inwardely be sought
With y^ surplus / and remenaunt of their thought
Men may there / the true patron find
Of inconstaunce / whose flaskysable kind
Is to and fro / meuynge as a wind
That Hercules / were not strong to bind
Nouther Sampson / so as I believe
Woman's heart / to make it not remeue
For as the blase / whyrleth of afyre
So to and fro / they flee in their desire
Till they accomplysshe / fully their delight
For as matere / by naturell appetyte
Kyndely desires / after form
Till he his course / by process may perform
So this women / refrain them ne can
To sewe their lust / as fro man to man
They will not cease / till all be assayed
But would god / as matere is apayed
With one form / and holds him content
When of his bounds / he has the term went
And not desire / ferther to proceed
But still abyte / and will it not excede
That by example / all women would
Rest in one / as dewely they should
And hold them paid / and stylle there abide
But unsure fotynge / does them often slide
For they be not / content with vnytee
They pursue aye / for pluralytee
So of nature / to meuynge they be thewed
All though among / by signs outward showed
They pretend / a manner of stabylnesse
But under that is hyd / the doublensse
Of secrely that outward at the eye
Full hard it is / the treason to espy
Under curtyn / and veyle of honest
Is closed change / and mutabylyte
For their desire / is kept full close in mewe
And thing they had / leuest for to sewe
O only outward / for to have a lawde
They can declyne / with faynynge and with frawde.
Wherefore Cethes / thy wit was to barayne
That thou before / by prudence naddyst said
What should follow / of this unhappy cas
Why were thou bold / for to suffer alas
Thyn own daughter / so fair and fresshe of hew
With strange gestys entered but of new
So folylye / for to let her dele
Where through thy hono^ / thy worship and thy hele
Was lost in haste / and she to myscheif brought
In strange land / with sorrow and much thought
Where as she / to great sclaundre of the
In great myserye / and aduersyte
An end made / and thou were left all sole
Thou myghtest well complain and make dole
Alas the while / if thy prudent sight
Thou had grace / to remember a right
And to have cast / by discrete purueaunce
And weyed wisely / by mesure in balaunce
The fraud of women / and the freelte
In whom full selde / is any sykerte
As in his latin / Guydo does express
Wherefore thou Cethes / of very rechelesnesse
Thou haste at ones / in Augment of thy woe
Without recure / both two forgo
First thy treasoure / and thy daughter dear
That was to the / so passyngly entere
And eke thine heir / for when yt she was gone
As says mine Auctour / other was there none
After thy day / for to occupye
Thy royal ceptre / nor thy land to gye.
But what was worth / y^ great prouydence
The waker keeping / or besy dylygence
Of mighty Mars / that god is of battle
What might it help / diffende or avail
Again the wit of woman / or the sleyghte
Whose frauds are / of so huge aweyghte
That as them list / aye the game gothe
Their purpose hold / who so be lyef or loathe
They be slye / so prudent and so wise
For as this storye / plainly does deuyse
This Medea / by her engyne and craft
From her fader / his treasour has berafte
Thorugh the worchynge / of her sleyght gyle
As ye shall here / within a little while
For as she sat / at mete in that tide
Next her fader / and Jason by her side
All suddenly / her fresshe rosen hew
Full often time / began change and renew
An hondreth fythe / in alytell space
For now the blood / from her goodly face
Unto her heart / unawarely began a bale
And therwithall / she wexeth deed and pale
And efte anon / who that can take heed
Her hew changes / into goodly read
But ever among / to ennewe her color
The rose was meynt / with the lylye f^oure
And though the rose / some delegan pace
yet the lylye / abides in his place
Till nature made them efte to mete
And thus with cold / and with sudden hete
Was Medea / in her self assailed
And passyngly bexed / and trauayled
For now she brent / and now she began to cold
And aye the more / that she began behold
This young Jason / the more she began desyr^
To look on him / so was she set afyre
With his beauty / and his semelynesse
And every thing / she inly began inpresse
What y^ she saw / both in mind and thought
She all emprenteth / and forgot right naught
For she considers / every circumstaunce
Both of his port / and his governance
His sonnysshe here / crisped like gold were
His knyghtly look / and his manly chere
His countenance / with many noble sign
His face also most gracious and benygne
Most acceptable / unto her plesaunce
For as she thought / it was suffisaunce
Without more / unto her alone
To consider and look on his parsone
For in that time / without any dread
Of mete or drink / she took but little head
For she of food / has lost her appetyte
To look on him / she has so great delight
He was so prynted / in her remembrance
Love has her caught / so newly in a trance
And I marked / with his fury bronde
That she may not / escape from his hand
Noreschewe his stroke / in special
For she was yolde / body heart and all
Unto Jason / platly for to seye
And ever among / on him she cast her eye
When that she fond / aleyser opportune
But of wysdom / she woldenat contune
Her look to long / lest men dempte amys
But as the manner / of these women is
She kept her close / and wonderly secree
That by her chere / no man might see
What that she mente / by none occasion
She put them out / of all suspeccion
For openly / there was no tokens seen
She cast rather / that men should wene
That the encheson / of her abstynence
And why that she / sat so in silence
How that it was oonly of womanhede
Of honest shame / and of chaste dread
That together / in her heart met
The which twain / so this maid let
Fro mete and drink / as it would seem
Thus of wisdom / she made them for to deem
And so to cast / in their oppynyon
And thus she blent them / by discrecion
For her chere / cowde every thing excuse
She gave no matter / fools for to muse.
No chere unbridled / that time her asterte
For there was one / enclosed in her heart
And another / in her chere declared
For maidens / has often sythes spared
To show out / that they desire in deed
As it falls / who so can take heed
That while they flouren / in virgynyte
And for youth / have no lyberte
To specefye / that their heart would
They keep them close / for they be not bold
To show out / the su^me / of their sentence
And thus Medea / keeping aye silence
Ne let no word / by her lyppes pace
But covertly / with ^obre chere and face
What she mente / shows with her eye
So secretly / that no man cowde espy
The hot fire / in her breast yreke
And in her self / right thus she began to speak
As she in sothe / that so much can
So would god / this young lusty man
Which so fair / and semely in my sight
Assured were / to be mine own kynght
Which is to me / most plesaunt and enteer
With berde yspronge / shynynge like gold weer
So well Ilymed / and compact by measure
Well grow on heyght / and of good stature
And lyketh me / in every part so well
That by assent of fortune / and her whele
Iewred were / to stand in his grace
For as me seems / upon his knyghtly face
It is to me / an heaven to behold
All be therewith / my heart I feel cold
And yet in sothe / it may none other be
Alas why ne has he / on my wopyte
Or at the least / he knew in his entente
How much truth / to him that I mente
Of which alas / he takes no manner head
All be for him / I brenne as does the glede
And to be deed / I dare me not discure
Alas my pytous / and woeful adventure
Is to rewefull / and my mortal pain
So to be murdered / and dare me not complayn^
To friend nor foo / of my chance alas
To find help / or socour in this cas
And trewely / yet as I shall deuyse
I no thing mean / but in honest wise
Like as it shall / openly be found
For I desire / to be knyt and bound
With him in wedlok / and never from him twyn
For my menynge / is withouten syn
Grounded and set / upon all clenlynesse
Without fraud / or any doubylnesse
So clean and pure / is mine entencion
Lo aye the manner / and condycion
Of these women / that so well can feign
And show one / though they think twain
And covertly / that no thing be said
With humble chere / and face playn^
Enclose their lusts / by such sotylte
Under the bounds / of all honest
Of their intent / though the trecherye
Withal the surplus / under be Iurye
And though that they / faith before pretend
And can their fraud / with florisshing well defend
And flaterye oonly / the world to blende
With doubylnesse / enclosed in the end
Yet aye deceyt / is benethe meant
Under the sugre / of feigned clean intent
As it were sothe / in very existence
But trust me well / all is but appearance
They can show one / and another mean
Whose blewe is lightly / dyed into grene
For under flowers depeynt / of stabylnesse
The serpent dares / of newfangelnesse
So plain they seem / with words fair glosed
But underneath / their covert wyles closed
For what thyngr / be most of their pay
They will deny / and rathest they swear nay.
THis lyketh Guydo / of women for to endyte
Alas why would he / so cursydly write
Against them / or with them debate
I am right sorry / in english to translate
Repreef of them / or any evil to seye
Lever me were / for their love deye
Wherefore I pray them / to take pacyence
My purpose is not / them to do offense
They be so good / and parfyte euerychone
To reken all / I trow there be not one
But that they be / in will and heart true
For though among / they chese the^ loves new
Who consydereth / they be no thing to blame
For often time / they se men do the same
They must them puruaye / wha^ me^ them refuse
And if I cowde / I would them excuse
It sytteth not / a woman live alone
It is no store / but they have mo than one
Prayeng to them / for to do me grace
For as I hope / to them is no trespace
Though my making / be the same in all
As Guydo write / in his origynall
Where he myssayth / let him bear the wit
For it sit well / that the vengaunce byte
On him that so / these women has offended
And if I might / it should be amended
He should receive / duly his penance
For if he deyed / without repentance
I am dispeyred / of his sauacion
How he should ever / have remyssion
But he were contryte / his sin to redress
It may not ben / as clerks bear witness.
And by my truth / and he were alive
I mean Guydo / and I should him shryue
So bitter penance / plainly he should have
That to the time / that he were ygraue
He should remember / and platly not a sterte
For to repent him / with all his hole heart
That he so spoke / to his confusion
I will no longer / make disgression
From my matere / but let Gnydo be
And tell forth / the workynge of Medee
That has license / of her fader nome
And to her chaumbre / is alone I come
When out of halle / withdrawn was the pres
And when Jason / and also hercules
Like as the king / after mete had
To their chambres / conveyed were and ladde
Full royally arrayed / and besayne
For every wall / was covered in certain
With clothe of gold / in full stately wise
And in this while / as ye have herd deuyse
Was Medea / to her chaumbre gone
Whereby her self / complaining ever in one
She gave issue / to her pains smerte
That her so sore / have wounded to the heart
For love has brought her / in a sudden rage
That was not lykly / soon for to aswage
For in Sothenesse / the furyous god Cupyde
Has such a fire / kynled in her side
That it was never / lykly for to let
So violent and fervent / was the hete
That more and more / increase began her pain
For in her breast / there was at wixe twain
A great debate / and a strong battle
So fervently / each other did assail
And this contek / in ernes and in game
Inparted was / betwyxt love and shame
Metynge togydre / there at unset steven
All be the field / was not parted even
For love in sothe / full of hye renown
Was bold and hardy / like a fyerse Lyowne
And was not ferefull of spear / sword nor knyfe
But hot and hasty / for to auntre his life
Eke surquydous / stout / and full of pride
Chief champyon / of the god cupyde
That causes often both f^e and bond
Full many peril / for to take on hand
And caused has / full many man his death
And many one / to yield up the breath
And made their wounds / largely to blede
For of peril / love takes none head
To get him honor / by excellence of fame
But in contrary / his enmye called shame
Like a cowarde / faint and hertles
As he that never / dare put himself in pres
For lack of manhood / draws hy^ ever a bake
He is so dreadful / and ferefull of the wrake
Like a child / young / and tender of age
For he has nouther / heart nor courage
For to assail / he is so febyll of might
And yet full often / he has stand in the sight
Of many lover / to let him for to speed
Thorugh false co^spyrynge / of his brother dread
For dread and shame / when they be allied
Of one assent / have pytously denied
Unto love / heart and hardynesse
That he ne durst / out a word express
For when that love / of manhood would speak
The wood fire / out of his breast to vnreke
Upon the point / when he should assay
Comes shame anon / and utterly faith nay
And causes love / horns for to shrynke
To abasshe his chere / and pytously to wynke
Cowardely his cause / to appayre
And thus is shame / froward and contrayre
Thorugh help of dread / lovers folk to fere
For doutlesse / if shame naught ne were
As it is kouthe / both nyghe and far
Love in his laws / often should err
And wind out / of honestes cheyne
Of his bonds / brydell break and reyne
Right as an horse / out of the trays at large
For little or naught / lovers would charge
To follow their will / and their lust to sewe
But all the while / that shame is kept in mewe
Within his breast / so that none it know
Outward in port / love bears him low
For ne were shame / as clerks have compyled
Out of their hertes danger were exyled
All strangeness / and feyned falls disdain
For ne were shame / plainly the wardayne
Of these women / by writing of these old
Without assaute / the castle were I yolde
It were no need / a sege for to layne
For in such caas / long tretye were in vain
For of nature / they love no process
But now alas dread / and shamefastness
Have daunted love / in full low manner
And made him full humble / of port and chere
And they have eke / by their vyolence
For all his manhood / put him in silence
And ben great cause / of morning of his pain
And amyddes / of this ylke twain
Of love and shame / even upon the point
Stood Medea / in full great disioynt
That she ne may / the pain not endure
So hoote she burnt / this woeful creature
Betwyxe both / I mean love and shame
For when that love / would any thing attame
Of his desires / to declare them out
Came shame anon / and put him in a doubt
And dread was ready / his lust for to deny
And thus she stood / in Iupardye
Of love and shame / in manner of a trance
Un euenly hanged / in balaunce
For shame was great / and love yet was more
As she well knew / by her syghes sore
And by her stormy / cruel adventure
For dread and shame / durst not discure
The fire that love has / in her breast enclosed
Which was full hard / for to be deposed
And thus she henge / even at wixe two
That shene wyste / what was best to do
Till that fortune / with her double face
Unhappily has wrought / to get her grace
With the whyrlynge / of her whele about
That causes wretches / full low dowe to loute
When they best wene / to sytte hye a lofte
By experyence / as men may se full often
By her gery / reuolucion
For this lady / of transmutacion
Full often time / falls and full unstable
Enhasteth things / to foolys full greable
Which in the end / to their confusion
Can under sugre / shrowde her poison
For aye fortune / as her manner is
To wretches shows / other than it is
For with fair chere / and face of flaterye
As she that can / with a benyngne eye
Fully of foolys / parfourme thentent
Where thorugh they be / in great myscheif shent
At the end / and can no craft to eschew
To unware harm / that at her tail does sewe
Right as it fell whylome of Medee
Gynnyge and ground / of her aduersyte.
For this lady / that called is fortune
I granted has / a leyser opportune
To show Jason / holy at her heart
Which made her after / full sore weep and smerte
For on a day / after merydyene
When Appollo / with his bemes shene
From the southe plage / began to westre fast
Cethes her fader / has I sent in haste
To Medea / to come to him anon
And bad to her that she should gone
Unto Jason / and to Hercules
To make them / chere / among all the pres
And when she kaught / oportune space
To her desire / and saw eke in the place
That her fader / was most occupied
As she that thought not / to be espied
Apparceyuynge / his great business
Toward Jason / anon she began her dress
And he in haste / with a full knyghtly chere
In curteys wise / began to draw nere
Toward her / and saw there was no let
And when that they were / together met
This Medea / with syghynge first abrayde
And to Jason / even thus she said.
How Medea showed Jason all the manner of the Conquest of the golden Flees /
and how he wan it. Ca. vi.
Jason quod she / of thine hye noblesse
Of thy manhood / and of thy gentylnesse
Both assembled / in thy parsone yfere
And of knyghthode / first I the requere
In thy conceyte / and oppynyon
Not to arecte / to presumpcyon
To doubylnesse / nor to inconstaunce
Of womanhede / nor varyaunce
That I am bold / and can for no thing spare
My menynge clearly / to you to declare
Without ^eynynge / in words plat and plain
Besechynge first / to that I shall said
Without more / of your goodlyhede
Benyngnely / for to take heed
And pacyently / to my words lest
And what I say / to take it for the best
In your intent / and no thing you to grieve
For things two / mine heart sore meue
This is to say / love and gentylnesse
What that I mean / clearly to express
To your person / and no thing to counsele
Or we part / like as ye shall feel
For me seems / first of curtesye
In soth fastness / and of genterye
That to strangers / every manner wight
Is bound and hold / of very due right
To make chere / and trewely as of me
Because Jason / that I in you se
So much manhood / and so great worthynesse
I will not feign / with all my business
To help and further / in all that may you like
And with that word / of heart she began to syke
For his sake / and said over more
For you I feel / full great anoy and sore
That meued are / without auysenesse
Oonly of youth / and wylfull hardynesse
The flees of gold / to get if ye may
The which empryse / who ever assay
More peryllous is / plainly to achyeue
In very sothe / than ye cowdelyeue
For douteles / I do you well assure
The fynall mede / of this adventure
Is not but death / save report of shame
For there ye wene / to get you a name
The end plainly / shall turn in contrary
For the gynnynge / so the fine shall varye
For wit of man / nouther engyne nor might
Though he be never / so expert in fight
Or have in arms / passing excersyse
With all the sleyghtes / of old or new empryse
Or though he be / best brethed to endure
Or what deuyse there be / of his armure
Or what wepen also / that he bring
Harded with stele / trenchaunt or persynge
Yet at the last / when he has all sought
Without me / it veil may right naught.
Wherefore Jason / I have compassion
On your youth / of pure affeccion
That of wylfulnesse / ye shall thus be lorne
That been of blood and line / so high yborne
For certainly / it may none other be
But if that ye / your counsel take of me
For none but I may do you help or ese
Alas Jason / why will ye not appese
Your manly courage / in this caas yblent
And to my counsel / ben obedyent
Than durst I swear / ye should have victory
Ben remembered / and put in memory
Perpetuelly / and thorugh your knyghthod win The flees of gold / the which is yonde within
In the isle / that stands here beside
Of which that Mars / is governor and gyde
Wherefore at ones / in your self assente
To my counsel / fully to consent
At few words / if ye list to speed
And leave your lust / and work after my read.
TO whom Jason / with full humble chere
Answered and said / mine own lady dear
I thank you / in all my best wise
Right as fet forth / as I may suffyse
And as my power / platly may attain
Mine hertes queen / and lady sovereign
Whom ye may / holy I ensure
All the while / that my life may dure
Trust right well / me list not for to feign
To live or dye / at your lust restrain
As him that is / your own true man
You for to obey / in all that ever I can
Without change / or any doubylnesse
While that I live / in very sothfastnesse
That you list / of true affeccion
Upon my life / to have compassion
Of gentyllesse / and that ye list to have
Such cherte / my body for to save
That in good faith / of very due right
I am ybounde / to be your own knight
Unto mine end / and that more specially
That of your grace / so benyngnely
Ye list your self / of any counsel be
That never before / to you in no degree
Ne did seruyse / to your womanhede
And with your words / full of goodlyhede
Your own man / lysteth recomforte
The which in sothe / so as I can report
A thousand fold / be the more plesaunt
That never before / no merit gat him grant
Ne no desert / request nor prayere
But more freely / with heart full entere
List vnrequyred / on my woe to rewe
And vndisserued / be to me so true
That I ensure / upon my faith as fast
In your seruyse / I shall unto my last
Parseuer sothely / that there shall be no slouthe
Nor varyaunce / and thereto here my truth
For finally / withouten wene
At few words I say right as I mean
Me list not feign / flatre nor delude
For my beheste / with death I shall conclude
When that parcas / my lives threde to rende
This all and some / and thus I make an end.
THan quod she / full wisely in your heart
Ye must before / consydre and aduerte
The adventure / that ye take on hand
And prudently / the peril understand
And full warely cast / and have in mind
The mortal harm / at the tail behind
That is well more / then it is credyble
For leave me well / it is an impossyble
To gynne in honor / and also for to fine
For thylke flees / by hye power dyuyne
Preserved is / and eke with Marcys might
That who so enters / therefore to fight
It were full hard / to him to escape
The fyrye flawme / when the bulls gape
That been of brass / trapped all in leven
More for to dread / than lyghtnynge of y^ heaven
Tofore the dynt / of the great thonder
That severed has / many toure asonder
For to Ashes / they must a man consume
Wherefore I read / that ye not presume
The Ram to assail / lest ye your labor lose
Withdraw your foot / yet sithe ye may chese
By good advise / and discreciowne
Your honor sauf / and your hye renown
Where so ye list / of your wylfulnesse
Oonly of folly / and of hastynesse
To this empryse / of heed to proceed
Or where ye list / like as I you read
Save your self / from woe and all myschaunce
Like as ye shall / if to mine ordenaunce
Ye you commytte / and lowely list obey
Without fraud / there is no more to seye.
ANd Jason than / sitting at the board
Of Medea emprentynge / every word
Wax for Ire / almost impatient
And said alas / and is this your intent
Me to counsel / to leave this empryse
Certes it were / to foul a cowardyse
To gynne thing I might not a cheue
For every man / would me repreue
And report to my confusion
That I of pride / and presumpcion
Took on me / when I was at my large
So hye a thing / and so great a charge
That I durst not / for doubt of myschefe
Accomplysshe it / when it came to the prefe
Lever me were / mine own lady dear
For to Iuparte / and to put in were
My self at ones / and at words few
On small pecys / to be all to hew
Than I should cowardely / forsake
Thylke empryse / that I have undertake
As ye well know / and leave it thus alas
Let be your counsel / plainly in this cas
For what so ever / hap or fall of me
Trusts right well / it shall none other be
For if that I / of my cowarde heart
Fro my purpose / should now dyuerte
Without lawde / my life I should led
And shame eternal / should be my mede
Through out the world / noted over all
In every land / spoke of in special
That Jason has / so hyghly undertake
That he for fere / dare none end make
Thinks right well / that it shall not betyde
For life or death / what myscheif I abide
And there upon / my truth I you ensure
That as ferforthe / as my life / may endure
I shall parfourme / that I have begone
And though so be / it may not be won
But that I must / with my death it beye
I will not leave / for lever I have to deye
Than live ashamed / of cowardyse and slouthe
For me seems / it is to high a routhe
A man to appear / or dare show his head
When he has / his honor vyllanede
After time / when his name is slain
For eueryman / should be rather feign
To dye in honor / than live as a wretch
And though this thing / to my death stretche
It is welcome / I shall it well abide
This all and some / what so of me betyde.
THan quod she / sithe it is so
That ye algates / desire to have ado
There is no more / by ought I can espy
But ye had lever / shortly for to dye
Rather than live / and to have a shame
And yet it is an ernest / and no game
With such monstres / unawarely for to dele
Like as in deed / there after ye shall feel
Wherefore / I am meued of pity
And greatly stered / that ye of volunte
Without advise / or discrecion
Counsel / or good delyberacion
List take on you / this meruaylous vyage
For your youth / and also your courage
Governed ben as / in this matere
All after lust / for both two yfere
Inparded ben / if ye your purpose sewe
For unpossyble / is to you to eschew
A sudden death / for nouther fre nor bond
By craft of man / has power to withstonde.
Wherefore I think / of heart and good intent
To cast away yet / or ye be shent
And to your turn / shape a remedy
Such routhe I have / that ye should dye
For my fader / whom I love most
Rather than ye should / thus be lost
I shall offend / and utterly displease
My friends all / so it may do you ease
For I shall find / such amene weye
At the least / that ye shall not deye
For in this caas / I think be your gyde
So that for you / I shall set aside
My birth first / of the stok royal
And over more mine heritage withal
And mine honor / shall be put back
You for to help / that there shall be no lack
Found in me / so ye will be kind
And that ye list / for to have in mind
As I disserne / goodly me to quyte
Considering first / that it is not alyte
To save your life / that stand in Ieopardye
More peryllous^y / than ye can espy
But for all this / I shall it so ordain
Thorugh my craft / oonly at wyxe us twain
That or we part / I hope all shall be well
Upon this point / so that I may feel
Faithfully for joy / woe or smerte
With full accord / of body will and heart
To my desire / that ye condecende
I undertake / to make a good end.
This sothly lady / said Jason tho
I am assented / without words mo
For to fulfill / with every circumstaunce
What that ever / may be to you pleasaunce.
THan quod she / there is no more to said
But first of all / with faith and heart plain
With all your might / and your besy cure
And menynge hole / that ye meassure
That ye hereafter / shall take me to wife
To hold and keep / after all your life
So that your deed accord / with your hest^
This is the fine / and su^me of my request
Except oonly / that ye shall ordeyne
In your repair / to your faders reygne
That faithfully / ye shall me with you led^
And after that / when that ye succeed
After his day / into your heritage
With heart aye one / and with one courage
Ye shall to me / be I like true
And cherysshe me / for change of any new
Like mine estate / without varyaunce
And while ye live / have in remembrance
My kyndenesse / in your great need
For there is none a live / that may speed
Creature / that is here mortal
For to assail / the forces marcy all
Of the dragon / and bulls both in fere
But it so be / of me that he lere
Holy the manner / how he shall him gye
Like as to you / I think specifye
When it happeth / that we mete again
For none but I / may help certain
In this caas / as platly ye shall find
And I not ask / but that ye be kind.
SOthly quod Jason / all this shall be do
As ye deuyse / I will that it be so
And here my faith / there on I you assure
O goodlyest / of any creature
That ever yet / I saw unto my pay
And fairest eke / in sothe it is no nay
And of bounte / ye ben in comparable
For of my death / ye ben so merciable
That while I live / I say you by my faith
Mine heart meneth / as my tunge ^ayth
I will be found / your own true man
For life or death / in all that ever I can
So that of grace / it be to you pleasant
For to parfourme / your hestes and your graunnt
And work fully / to my sauacion
As ye have said / in full conclusion
For trewely ye of all / that bear life
In beauty / have a prerogatyfe
Passing echone / me list not for to gloss
Among flowers / as does the read rose
Which in somer / amyd the leuys soote
After that veer / has made out of the root
The humydyte / kyndly to ascend
The barayne foil / to clothe and amend
And the branches / that winter made bare
With sote blosmes / fresshely to repare
And the meadows / of many sundry hew
Tapited ben / with diverse flowers new
Of sundry motlees / most lusty for to seen
And wholesome bawme / is shad among ye grene
Right as the rose / is fairest of echone
Right so nature / set you alone
When she you made / first at her deuyse
Above all other / for to have a pryse
As ye that been / of bounte spring and well
Thereto in beuute / sothly ye excelle
All that live / for any comparison
Ne may be made / and of discrecion
Ye pass all / as every man may se
And with all this / I find you unto me
The most goodly / that ever yet was borne
Without whom / I were as now but lorne
Of help and socour / fully destitute
Ne were that I / found in you refute
Fro whom al fredo^ / to mewarde does habou^de
In somoche / that I am ever bound
As fer forth / as my live may streche
That for your sake / of death I ne reche
If therwithall / I might you agrene
That to my help / so goodly list to seen
For if that I / of neclygence should
Any thing refuse / that ye would
I might of reason / full well merked be
And noted eke / of wylfull nycetee
So folylye / to void away my grace
It were arage / a man from him to chase
Wylfull fortune / when she is benyngne
Wherefore as now / holy I resygne
Heart body my life / and eke my death
Into your hand / while me lasts brethe
With all the oaths / that I afferme may
For to perseruer / to mine ending day
Your true spouse / as I have said and sworn
And you behested / plainly here toforne
And there upon / every thing obey
That may you please / till time that I deye
This all and some / what should I longer tarry
From this beheste / I shall never varye.
And when she saw / his great stedefastnesse
She was ^upprysed / with so hye gladness
With so great joy / pleynly in her heart
That she was void / of every woe and smerte
For he so lowly / to her lust obeyde
And or she went / thus to him she seyde.
Jason quod she / than I shall ordain
Amene way / that we both twain
May efte again / at leyser mete sone
For to parfourme / all that is to done
In this matere / like to our intent
Where shall be made / a fynall sacrament
Of our desire / that no man shall unbind
Though now thereto / we may no leyser find
Toward eve / it shall not me escape
Trust me right well / a time for to shape
Secretly / that we may mete yfere
For I shall send / a pryue chambrere
To you of mine / which shall you conueye
Unto my chamber / by a pryue weye
A certain hour / without any fable
To our intent / that be most greable
Upon the point / when Phoebus with his light
I westryd is / and eke the derke night
Has with the dymnesse / of his shadows blake
Our emysperye / fully over take
That often gives / by favor of fortune
Unto lovers a leyser / opportune
For to parfourme their / lusts / and achyeue
And right anon / as it draws to eve
I shall for you / to my closet send
Of every thing / for to make an end
Where as we / shall at good leyser speak
Eueryche with other / and our hertes break
And declare the su^me / of all our will
And when we have / spoken all our fylle
By good leyser / I fully you byhete
We shall ordain / when so us lust to mete
To set a time / who ever that say nay
Always by night / when passed is the day
For mighty Jove / as wisely me socoure
As hence forth / I will be holy your
While that I live / waking and a sleep
If it so be / that ye your hestys keep.
TO whom Iosan / lowly began to enclyne
And said as fer / as man may ymagyne
Or any wight / may clearly comprehend
I will to you / to my lives end
As servant / faithfully me quyte
And though that I can not say but lyte
My true heart / will not neuerthelasse
And though I can not peynte nor compass
No gay process / my soueraygne hertes queen
Till I be deed / trewely I shall mean
Have here my troth / while I have life and my^de
As in the end / trewely ye shall find.
And for their speech / and end thus they make
And Medea / shope her for to take
Her leave anon / among all the pres
First of her fader / and than of Hercules
And bode no longer / but forth with anon
Unto her chamber / in haste she is gone
Where up and down / she made many went
None of her meyne / wetynge what she mente
Casting ways / her purpose to a chyeue
And in her wits / began besyly to meue
As she rometh / in her habytacle
On any side / if there were obstacle
Or any lettynge / which would her sore grieve
This was her study / till it drew to eve
Where I her leave / complaining in her woe
With many a thought / walking to and fro.
The myddaye hour / is gone and over slide
Tytan so fast / has in his chare I ride
The days arc / from est to west compassed
His fyry stedes / have almost I passed
Our oryzonte / and draw down full low
His golden wayne / that no man might know
Where as he hid / his fyry bemes bright
In his descence / full fer out of our sight.
And herynes / with her copes myrke
The evening / begone for to dyrke
In the twylyght / when the day began fade
And Esperus / with her stremes glade
That been so fresshe / so lusty and so merye
Began recomforte / all our emysperye.
When Medea / by her self alone
Of high desire / began for to make her moan
That she so long abode / after her knight
Always accountynge / the hours of the night
So full of trouble / and full of thought
Which has full streytly / serched out and sought
A ready way / unto her purpose
All be that she / kept it in full close
Amyd her heart / quappynge as awawe
For dread and fere / till hope began adawe
And bad she should / be right merye and glad
Till dread agaynward / made her sobre and sad
Lest her desire / troubled were or let
And thus she was / at abay ysette
Amyd of hope / and of dread also
That she ne wyste / what was best to do.
For her desire / and hye affeccion
So sobre burnt / in her oppynyon
Of lust she had / to mete with Jason
And there against / dread came in anoon
And made her ferefull / lest she were espied
But all her sorrow / was help and remedyed
Oonly by fortune / and the dyrke night
By which she was made / full glade and light
For recomforted oonly these two
And with good hope / that made her glade also
She began anon / to cast and deuyse
When that the moon / on heaven would a rise
And when that she / with her horns pale
Would shede her light / upon hylle and vale
She began acounte / and cast well the time
And found a quarter / was passed after pryme
And she that was / well knowing in that art
And saw in sothe / that the fourth part
Of the moon / was shadde with new light
And passed was / in her course full right
After the time of coniunccion
Three signs full / by computacion
And complet was / seven days of her age
At which time / she brennynge in her rage
And thorugh darted / with cupides arowe
Began to look / and behold narowe
At every door / and lysten besely
If any wight / that she myghtespy
Of all the court / outher walk or go
Or any man romyn / to or fro
So sore shedradde / going up and down
When she herd / any noise or sown
Or when she hereth / why spring any where
It was venym / sothly in her ere
She wysshed all / had been a bed
This pytouslyfe / the long night she led
Without respyte / though no wight could it know
Till hye mydnyght / that the cokkes crow
At which time / when all was huste and stylle
For to accomplysshe / ye remenaunt of her will
And every where / made was silence
She clepyd anon / unto her presence
An aged vecke / fer in years run
That in such craft / much help konne
Thriftely to bryng^ / a thing about
For they before / can cast every doubt.
Of years passed / old experyence
Has give to them / so passing hye prudence
That they in love / all the sleyghtes know
And she was made / as dog for the bow
To whom Medea / discureth all her thought
From point to point / and forgot right naught
And charged her / in reles of her smerte
And recomforte / of her troubled heart
To haste her anon / upon her way
Unto her chaumbre / Jason to conuaye
And she anon / not rekles in that caas
Is gone for him / a full soft paas
As she that was / of new not to lere
And brought him anon / as ye shall here.
When that the cok / common Astrologere
y^ mydnyght hour / with his voice full clear
Began to sown / and did his besy pain
To beat his breast / with his wings twain
And of the time / a mynute will not pace
To warn them / that were in the place
Of the tides / and season of the night
Medea to awayte / upon her knight
Full ready was / the enter for to keep
As she that list / full little for to sleep
For that ne was / no parcel of her thought
And wha^ Jason was / to her chamber brought
Without espyeng / of any manner wight
Than she anon / conueyeth him full right
Into her closet / in all the haste she may
Full well besene / with great and rich arraye
Where by her side / she made him take his see
And first of all / this ylke lees of three
By her that was / most expert in this caas
Was suddenly / turned to a braas
For the vecke / to stare upon the moon
Is walked out / and has them left alone
And when Medea / the doors had shette
Down by Jason / anon she has her set
But first I find / with all her besy might
About the chamber / that she set up light
Of great torches / and cyerges full ryall
About on pyllers / and on every wall
Which gave alyght / like the son shene
And to a cheste / wrought of crystal clean
First of all / she takes her passage
Out of the which / she took aryche image
Of pure gold / full lusty to behold
That by custom / of the rytes old
To mighty Jove / eterne and creat
I hallowed was / and also consecrat
The which image / devoutly as she ought
With humble heart / to Jason first she brought
And made him lowly / thereon take his oath
Unto his last / outher for lyef orlothe
That he her should take / unto his wife
Fro that day forth / during all his life
With heart unfeigned / and faith inuyolate
And cherysshe her / like to her estate
Fro that time / I find how that she
Had ever floured / in virgynyte
And as mine Auctour / well reherce can
Aye kept her clean / from touch of any man
In thought and deed / and never did amys
For she of heart / so holly given is
Unto Jason / and that for ever mo
And he anon / has put his hand unto
And swore fully / as ye have herd me say
All her requests / without more delay
To keep them / while his life may last
But o alas / how soon he over cast
His hest / his faith / with which he was assured
And had his fraud / with flaterye yeured
So covertly / that her innocence
Her true menynge / and her dylygence
And all that ever / she deuyse can
Deceived was by falshede of this man
And though yt truth / was apparent above
Doubylnesse so slyghly / was in shoue
As though he had / sothly be allied
With true menyng / and so no thing espied
Under fair chere / was faynynge and failas
For what might she / a wrought more i^ this cas
Than for thy sake / ceptre and regalye
And all the lords / eke of her alye
Forsook at ones / and took of them no head
And of pity / and of very goodlyhede
Lost her friends / and her good fame
Oonly Jason / to save the froshame
And yet moreover / forsook her heritage
She that was borne / of so hye parage
And should have be / by succession
Heir by dissent / of that Regyon
But womanly / for she would her quyte
Of all yfere / she set not amyte
But at one hour / all she has forsake
And unto the / she has her holly take
Oonly for trust / thou should have be kind
Richesse and honor / she has I left behind
And ches in exyle / with the for to gone
From all her kynne / this cely maid alone.
Alas I weep / for thine unkindness
What has she not / fro death and fro distress
Preserved the / and yet thou take none head
That should have deyed / ne had she be thy read
Of thy conquest / she was the very cause
That I may not / shortly in a clause
Write her bounte / nor briefly comprehend
Effectuelly parfourmed to the end
At words few / it may not be told
Thorugh whom y^ have / the rich f^ees of gold
Manly conquered / which without doubt
Vnlyaly was / that to a brought about
For when thou were / of help destytute
She was thy comfort / and synguler refute
And with all this / thou may it not deny
All erthely honor / how she began defye
The to conserve / out of heaviness
And her fader / she has o^ his richesse
So emperysshed / that pity is to here
By ensample / of which women might lere
How they should trust / on any man
Alas Medea that so much can
Both of sterres / and of astronomye
Yet saw she not / before her desten ye
Love has her put / so out of gouernayle
That all her craft / ne might her natauayle
She was to slow / by calculacion
To cast before the constellacion
Of her birth / and her woeful fate
For rekleshed / she saw it all to late
But I suppose her conning was fallyble
For doutles me seems / not credyble
That if she had wyste of it toforne
So pytously / she had not be lorne
As ye shall se here after hastily
So as the storye / reherseth by and by
How it befell / of Jason and Medee
But first ye shall the order and manner se
How she wrought / after he was swore
The same night / alas she has forbore
Her maiden head / and y^ was great pity
And yet she mente / not but honest
As I suppose / she went to have be his wife
But touching / that I hold as now no strife
And yet one thing / I dare aferme and feign
That the menynge / of this ylke twain
Ne was not one / but wonder fer atwene
For all that she / trewely began mean
Of honest thinking no outrage
Like a maid / innocent of age
He to accomplysshe / his flesshely false appetyte
And to parfourme / his foul appetyte
Wrought every thing / to her intent contrayre
Alas that she was / so debonayre
For to trust / upon his curtesye
Or to quyte her / of her genterye
So hastily to rewe / upon his sinerte
But women be / of so tender heart
That they will gladly / of routhe and pity
When that a man / is in aduersyte
Save his life / rather than he should deye
And so Medea / shortly for to seye
Casting no peril / after that shall fall
His desires and his lusts all
Holy obeys / with all her full might
And that so long / almost that the night
Has his course / round about gone
At which time / to her spoke Jason
And lowly said / my lady it is time
That we arise / for soon it will be pryme
Ye may se well / the day begins to spring
For we may here / how the birds sing
Prayenge to you / in all my best wise
How I shall work / that ye list deuyse
And ceryously / every thing dispose
I you beseech / o goodly fresshe rose
Mine empryse / to bring to an end
And than at erst / hense will I wind
Save that I think / first with you to trete
In what wise / this country ye shall let
And into Greece / repair again with me
Which is a land / of great felycyte
For trust well / and be no thing dread
Into that reyne / with me I shall you led
After my conquest / if so be that I win
Wherefore I pray you / goodly to begin
How I shall work / in all the haste ye may
For in good faith / anon it will be day.
To whom she spoke / fayeng as ye shall here
Mine own Jason / unto me more dear
Than is myself / as in conclusion
I am assented / with full affeccion
Of my wits / and all my hole heart
You to enfourme / how ye shall asterte
Every danger / of the little isle
If it so be / ye list abide a while.
And up she rose / in all the haste she may
And to a cofre / where her treasour lay
She went anon / and brought him in her hand
A rich image / of silver that she fond
Which sothely was / of meruaylous entayle
Whose power was / and virtue to avail
Effectuelly / to her both intent
Again all magyk / and enchauntement
And to with sytte / the force of Sorcerye
For it was made / by astronomye
In hour chose out / and equat for the nones
By clerks old / for full long agone is
Whylom wha^ they were / flouryng i^ their ages
That they used / to make such images
As did the king / called Tholomee
And so to Jason / commanded has Medee
To bear this image / on him pryuely
As ye have herd / to work effectuelly
In every thing / as she did assygne
And than she took / to him a medecyne
Made in manner / of an oynement
To ennoynte him with / that he be not brent
That was more rich / and precious than bawme
Again the malys / of every fire and flawme
And after that / she took to him anon
A rich ring / where in was set a stone
That virtue had / all venym to destroy
That on no side / it might him not a noye
The which stone / had also this might
That if a man / cowde it bear a right
Within his hand / next the skyn enclosed
The strength of sight / should be deposed
Of them that would / gase or behold
For who so ever / in his hand it hold
By the virtue / that was infallyble
The storye says / he should be in vysyble
The which stone / wise clerks call
Achates / most virtuous of all
And it is found / sothely in Cecyle
Of which stone / whylom wrote virgyle
How that venus / to Eneas it sent
First when that he / into Cartage went.
And after this / she to Jason took
A certain bylle / written like a book
That to his journey / might much avail
And bad him wisely / that he not ne fail
If he cast him / graciously to speed
First of all / the scripture that he read
Or he the Ram / touch in any wise
Him chargynge / eke before this hye empryse
With humble heart / and devotion
That he knelynge / say that oryson
That up and down / was written on the bylle
Prayenge the gods / lowely to fulfylle
His request / and mercy for to have
Of very pity / from myscheif him to save
And after that / for his chief socoure
She took to him / a vyoll with lycoure
And bad him manly / without fere or dread
When he come / unto the bullys read
If he him shape / knyghtly to escape
That as fast / as he sees them gape
Into their goles / that he the lycour cast
Than that him not / but little of them gaste
For their iowes / together it shall glyewe
That on no side / they shall not eschew
To beye his lust / in what him list co^streyne
For doutles / maugre all their pain
He shall them so daunte / and make tame
That where him list / in ernest and in game
He might them make louten and enclyne
And do them bow / both back and chyne
The lycour / shall there chawles so coharte
That a sonder / they shall not depart
For to offend / or noye any wight
And when she had thus / unto her knight
In every thing / gave instruccion
Plain doctrine / and informacion
How he shall escape / the dangers by and by
If he take heed / and work auysely.
And than accorded / they thought it for ye best
For to part / or men out of their rest
A waked were / for it drew to day
As they well saw / by the morrow graye
And lest men had to them suspecion
Of hye prudence / and discrecion
A twene the twelyght / and the rody morrow
They took their leave / with saint John^ ye borowe
With often kissing / as lovers wha^ they twynne
And so he went / and she is left withinne
Being in hope / to mete again some day
And Jason than / as fast as ever he may
Began ordain him / his Journey to acheue
And thought he would / anon go take his leave
And in what wise / within a little while
After the manner of my rude style
My purpose is / sothely and not spare
With your supporte / plainly to declare.
When that the rows / and the rays read
Estwarde to us / full erely gonne sprede
Even at the twelyght / in ye damnynge
When the lark / of custom gynneth sing
For to salve / in her heavenly lay
The lusty goddess / of the morrow graye
I mean Aurora / which before the son
Is wont to enchase / the black skies done
And the derkenesse / of the dymme night
And fresshe Phoebus / with comfort of his light
And the bryghtnesse / of his bemes shene
Had over gylte / the hye hills grene
And flowers eke / again the morrow tide
Upon their stalks / began plain their leaves wide
When that Jason / with all his company
Toward the king / full fast began him hye
Who that he fond / like to his estate
With scepter in hand / full pompous and elate
Hye in the sea / of his regalye
Sitting full kyngly / amyd his chyualrye
And his lords / about enuyron
At which time / this young champyon
Under a vow stondyng / of the Ram
With stern face / tofore the king in came
Besechynge him / of his magnyfycence
The same day / to grant him license
To do his arms / and make no delays
Concludynge plainly / that at all assayes
He will that day / in the field be found
For to achieue / like as he was bound
Of old byheste / and not a point declyne
For life nor death / till he parfourme and fine
Holy the auntres / unto the flees that long
The king requeryng / no longer him prolonge
But goodly grant / the fyn of his empryse
And than the king / in full sobre wise
Considering / the su^me of his demand
To Jason spoke and said / he shall command
That his request / parfourmed were in haste
All be quod he / I am full sore a gaste
Of wylfulnesse / thou should destruyde be
Lest men thy death / arected unto me
And thereupon / would and blame set
Of ryall power / that I not ne let
Thy manly youth / from such Iupartye
Which were in sothe / a great vylanye
And preiudyce / to mine estate and name
That afterward / men put me in blame
Thorugh falls report / and wrong opinion
That I withstode / not thy destruction
Wherefore I read / yet be thou auysed
And my counsel / let not be dispysed
For better it is / with honor in certain
Into thy country / to repair again
Than wylfully / for to take an hand
A mortal thing / that no man may wtstonde
This is my read / and fully mine advise
Take heed thereto / fythe that thou art wise
Lest thou repent / when it is to late
And if so be / that thou wylt algate
Thy purpose hold / and not do as I read
Almighty Mars / I pray the to speed
The for to gyde / what so ever fall
And eke I pray / to the gods all
Saufe and sound / thy body to restore
This all and some / of me thou gettest no more.
And when Jason / had herd the king
Not dismayed / nor stoned in no thing
In knyghtly wise / did him reverence
Thanking hyghly / his royal excellence
That of his grace / and benyngnyte
Upon his death / him list to have pity
Fully concludynge / touching his battle
That nouther read / nor counsel
In no wise / his purpose should withdraw
But like the statute / plainly and the law
Right as fer forth / as fortune will him eure
What so be tide / of his adventure
Setting aside / every feer and dread
Said platly / that he will proceed
For to parfourme / that he has undertake
It were in ydell mo / skylles for to make
Or to allegge / more there again
And Jason than / full openly and plain
Touching y^ surplus / of this dreadful thing
At his departing / said to the king
In audyence / of his lords all
What so ever of me / now be fall
Or who so ever / of malys thereon muse
To all the world / first I you excuse
And to the gods / platly you quyte
Though I deye / ye be nothing to wit
Ne no man shall / arecte it you of skylle
For that I work / is freely at my will
Again the advise / of your hye prudence
And life or death / here in your presence
Holy of heart / and never for to f^ytte
To the gods / and fortune I committee
So as them list / for me to ordain
Again whose will / I shall never plain
Nor them nor you / put in no blame
What so betyde / honor / joy or shame
And of this thing / thus an end I make
And for this time / of you my leave I take
And of all tho / that you about stand
And one by one / he took them by the hand
And in what wise / forth he began him dress
To you anon / I think it to express.
When that Tytan / had with his fervent hete
Draw up ye dew / from the leaves wete
Toward myd morrow / as I can diffyne
Upon the hour / when the clock is nine
Jason full manly / and full like a knight
Armed in steel / of chere full glad and light
Ganoresse him forth / what hap that ever fall
And said a dieu / unto his feres all
He in the boot / and they upon the stronde
And all alone / when he came to land
And in the water / had his vessel lafte
He first of all / remembrynge on the craft
Of Medea / with all the circumstaunces
And how he should / keep his obseruaunces
In every thing / and had it well in mind
And than anon / full manly as I find
He shope him forth / and went a knyghtly pas
Toward the bulls / that forged were of bras
But at the point / when he his Journey began
For him Medea / wexed full pale and wan
So ^ore aghast / that no thing might her glade
A routhe it was to se / what woshe made
For the teres / on her chekes twain
Full pyteously / do distylle and ^ayne
That all fordewed / were her wedes blake
And aye this sorrow / she made for his sake
Like a woman / ferefull and in doubt
While he his arms / full ma^ly brought about
To sobbe and syghe / she can not be in pes
Lest he for haste / were ought rekles
From point to point / to do like as she badde
This was the life / that she for him has ladde
And for to se / how he should him defend
She began anon / by grecys to assende
Of a toure / into an hye pynacle
Where as she might / have none obstacle
Nor lettynge nouther / for to have a sight
Of him that was / her own chosen knight
And ever among / with words out she brake
And stoundemell / thus to her self she spoke.
O thou Iaso^ / my sovereign hertes hele
If thou knew / what woe forth I feel
Sothly I trow / it should the not asterte
For to be true / with all thy hole heart
And god I pray / this Journey at the least
May this time / turn for the best
And keep the saufe / and sound / in every membre
And yefe the might / fully to remember
As I the taught / and in the same form
Every thing fully / to parfourme
Oonly this day / thyn honor to auaunce
Which for to se / were all my hole pleasaunce
For certes Jason / if the fylle ought amysse
Fare well my health / and all my worldly bliss
And fare well than / my myrthe and my solace
And my welfare / my fortune and my grace
And all at ones / my hertely suffysaunce
Lo this for him / was her governance
From the time / that he the land hath^ome
And first of all / when that he was come
Where as the bulls / fell and dispytous
Out cast their fire / and frawme f^ryous
At their mouths / wonder large and huge
Again the which / for his chief refuge
Him to save / that he were not brent
He was enoynted / with an Oyntement
On his body / that kept him from damage
Of thylke fire / that was so full of rage
And the smokes / derke and full horrible
Which to escape / was almost impossyble
For any man / of what estate he be
Without comfort / and counsel of Medee
By whose doctrine / Jason can so work
That he is escaped / from the mystes derke
Of the fire / with the blases blake
That all the eyer / so cludy did make
She had him made / so discret and sage
Oonly by virtue / of thylke image
Which that he / about his neck bare
Whereby he / was so prudent and so ware
That when ye bulls / have most feersly gaped
He has their malys / auysely escaped
For the enfeccion / of their troubled air
He has venquysshed / and was in no disspeyre
For in effect / again the foul fume
That would a man / unto the death consume
The image was / a preseruatyfe
Him to diffende / and to save his life
And more surely / to keep him out of dread
Full often sithe / the writ he did read
For the virtue / of that oryson
Was unto him / full proteccion
That he not fell / in no distress
And after that / for more sykernesse
Him to preserve / in his mortal cas
He took the lycour / that in the vyell was
And therwithall / full like a manly man
All at ones / he took the bulls than
And forgot not / so warely it to cast
That therwithal / their chawes were made fast
And by the virtue / so myghtely englewed
That he there thorugh / has utterly eschewed
The enfeccion / of the sinoky leven
And when the air / began clear and the heaven
And the mystes / were wasted him toforne
With manly heart / he raughte by the horn
The stern bulls / and by vyolence
He drew them forth / in whom was no defense
And yoketh them / so as the manner was
And with the ploughe / he made them go a pas
Now up n^w down / and to eere the land
And at his list so buxom he them fond
That the soil / smothe bare and plain
They made it / ready to bear grain
And on renges / it turned up so down
For the in them / was no rebellyowne
But humble and meke / and ready at his will
All his desires / plainly to fulfylle.
And Jason than / like a Champyon
Began him enhaste / toward the dragon
That was a be great / and monstrous
Foul and horrible / and right venymous
And was enarmed / in scales large and thycke
Of whom the brethe / more peryllous and wycke
Was than the heir / of any pestylence
For his venym / was of such vyolence
That it was full deedly / and mortal
And at his throat / there issued out with all
A flawme of fire as of a fournes mouth
Or like the leuene / that down by the southe
Out of the Gest / is wont in tempest smite
Right so this dragon / sothely for to write
Out at his mouth / had a flawme blased
Whereof Jason / first a little mased
Was in his heart / of that dredefull thing
But when that he / remembered on his ring
All fere and dread / was laid aside and gone
For in that ring / there was set a stone
Full rich and noble / and right virtuous
Of which as techeth great y^sydorus
And in mine Auctor / also as I find
Most comenly / comyth out of Ynde
And must be kept chaste / and wonder clean
And of color surmounteth / every grene
Whose virtue is / all venym to destroy
And to withstand / that it may not anoye
Of dragon serpent / of adder and of snake
And specially / if that it be take
And I holden / in the opposyte
Of any worm / even again the syte
Without abode / in sothe he may not chese
Of his venym / the force he must lose
How strong it be / or vyolent of rage
But to the stone / it does full great damage
For when he has / his virtue do as blyue
On pecys small / it gynneth all to ryue
And in it self / hole it abydes no while
For in the land / that called is Cecyle
There is a worm / that Bufo bears the name
And wha^ men will / of malys make him tame
And his venym / utterly express
They take a quyll / mine auctor bears witness
When they will work or a large can
And in the end / this stone they let than
And line right / again the wromes head
They hold it / till that he be deed
For that is sothly / his virtue of nature
That no venym / may last nor endure
In the presence / of this rich stone
And as I find / this Bufo right anon
Thorugh might thereof / bresteth even a twayn
Oonly by kind / which no man may restrayn
For the goddess / that called is nature
Which next her lord / all thing in cure
Has virtue give / to herhe / gras / and stone
Which no man knows / but her self alone
The causes hyd / be closed in her hand
That wit of man can / not understand
Openly the might / of her workynge
And so Jason / by virtue of this ring
And through his stone / yt might hy^ most auau^ce
Has the dragon / brought unto vttraunce
In whom he fond / no manner resystence
Him to withstand / force nor diffence
Nouther by venym / nor none other strife
Wherefore he has / berafte him of his life
In manly wise / and in the field outrayed
And Jason than / full glad and well apayed
Has with his sword / spent on hy^ many a stroke
And laid on him / as men hew on an oak
His bright skales / were so hard and dur^
That well uneath / he ne might endure
Him to dismembre / and smite of his head
And than anon / in the stead of sede
He began his tethe / out of his head arace
And right forthwith / in the self place
He began them sow / right as men do corn
Upon the land / that ered was aforne
Of which sede / there sprange a wonder grain
Bright armed knight / stondinge on y^ plain
The which anon / with sharp swerdes ground
Eueryche began other / for to hurt and wound
Till each his fellow / has cruelly I slawe
This of their fate / was the fynall law
That none of them / should by victory
The death rejoice / of other by memory
For all yfere / thus they made an end
And after this Jason / began to wend
Unto the Ram / with all his dylygence
In which he fond / no power nor diffence
No manner strife / nor rebellyowne
And myghtely the Ram / he draws down
And set an hand / upon eueryche horn
And slew it first / and than he has it shorn
Out of his flees of gold / so passing rich
That in this world / there was no tresour lyche
And after that / he made no delay
To take his boot / in all the haste he may
And roweth forth / into the the other isle
Where Hercules / all the mean while
Upon the brynke / with many a another mo
A^ode Jason / till he had do
And euerychone / I find that as blyue
Oonly for joy / when he did aryue
They began to thank / to cheyr gods all
So graciously / that it has I fall
And that the flees / he has so knyghtly won
That shone as clear / as the somer son
Which that he brought / with him unto land
His feres all / abiding on the stronde.
ANd when Appollo / of his days arc
Had in ye west / almost run his mark
And fast began downwarde / to declyne
And on the wawes / full watrye began to shine
Yet or he was passed / the Occian
Jason is come / with many a manly man
Of his feres / to the presence of the king
As he that had / acheued every thing
Which that longs / to conquest of the Ram
And Cethes than / as soon as ever he came
To make him chere / outward has hy^ payned
All be in heart / that it was but feigned
For he was sorry / without any dread
Of the expleyte / and the good speed
Of this Jason / that he the flees has won
But like in sothe / as these feyners konne
When that them list / craftly compace
To show outward / a faithful true face
And the venym enclosed hole within
As in menynge / there were no manner syn
Right so the king / with look and forheed clear
Made unto Jason / outward right good chere
And began to him / to speak in words few
Of frendlyhede / and many signs show
As though his conquest / every dele
From point to point / lyked wonder well
And befull glad / that he was so fortuned
Unto the end / that he has contuned
And reioyseth in speech / and countenance
That fortune / list him so to auaunce
And to his paleys / began goodly him conueye
And day by day / full rychely festeye
All be that it was / no thing done of heart
For this no les / he felt full great smerte
That of his treasour / he was despoyled so
And that he has / the rich flees forgo
To his damage / and confucion
And thus there was / a great dyuysion
A twixe his chere / and menynge of his thought
As it fares often / if it be well sought
That many man / in menynge falls and double
Can with the calm / cover so the trouble
Of hye malys / hyd in his desire
And rake falsely / the wicked covert fire
Full hoote brennynge / inward of envy
So well were him / that cowde them out espy
And knew their menynge / falls and fraudelent
Where thorugh alas / full many an Innocent
Deceived is / that wot not what they mean
And namely such / that not but truth wene
And every chere / that men to them make
Of Innocence / for the best take
And in no wise / think not but well
Right so certain / this Jason every dele
Has take in gre / what ye king has wrought
Not aduertynge / ye grutchynge of his thought
For doutles / it sat the king full sore
That he the Ram / has lost for evermore
But when that he / has utterly I said
Though he grutche / that there was no gain
But finally / of necessyte
At that time / it might none outher be
And plainly saw / that he may not chese
But that algate / the flees he must lose
Whether it were / that he were lefe or loathe
He fayneth chere / as he were not wroth
For oonly he / of his gentylnesse
No sign outward / of grutchyng did express
But day by day / of very curtesye
He chereth Jason / and his company
At which time / about enuyrowne
From every party / of his regyowne
The people came / to stare and to gase
Upon the Ram / as it were a mase
They look and wondre / and deem what them list
On whose domes / is but little tryste
They often vary / and turn to and fro
That who that wisely / takes head thereto
The common people / changes as a phane
To day they wexe / and to morrow wane
As does the moon / they be so flaskysable
Who trusts them / shall find the^ full unstable
For some were glad / that Jason has sped well
And some sorry / and like it never adele
And some said / they wonder how he might
Again the dragon / or the bulls fight
Or how that he / again the force of Mart
Out of the I Will / alive might part
Another said / that parauenture
By craft was wrought / this discomfyture
Outher by charm / or some sorcerye
Thus each of them / after their fantasye
Began deem of him / all the long day
But at the last / making no delay
Full glad and light / Medea down descends
From her chamber / and outward pretends
Sadness of chere / as she no thing ne knew
Men could not conceive by her hew
Her secret menynge / for she so womanly
D^mened her / and so prudently
That she avoided / by discrecion
All fantasye / and suspeccion
That no man could / of her workynge deem
No thing but well / for as it did seem
By port and chere / there was no cause why
And so by process / she drew her pryuely
Toward Jason / for she was not to lere
And secretly / badde him in his ere
In alwyse / that he not ne leave
To her chamber / for to come at eve
For matter / they had for to trete
Which he shall know / at leyser when they mete
And so anon when entered was the night
Sool by him self / without torche or light
To Medea / he has the way take
And she abode / slepeles for his sake
Wonder devoutly / desiring as I guess
With him to trete / of some holiness
Touching materes / of contemplacion
For she was smytte with a devotion
Of fresh Venus / to hold a memory
With him alone / in her oratorye
Not openly / as ypocrytes pray
In diverse angles / ioynge on the way
Of the people / for to be commended
But they not so / has the night dispended
For vayneglorye / nor none other laud
But by themself / thynkyng on no fraud
Secretly / this ylke twain alone
Without light / outher of son or moan
The long night / have ladde without rest
For as them thought / it was not for the best
To speak of sleep / till that it was pryme
For they them cast / to lose as tho no time
And thus the night / together they dispende
That I am dull / for to comprehend
The obseruaunces / of such relygyous
Prolix in werkynge / and compendyous
Deem your self / ye get no more of me
For well ye wot / in every faculte
Who has knowing / and experyence
Men will to him / rather give credence
Wherefore I say / ye that be wise and can
Axe not me / which am so rude a man
To deem a thing / and namely when that it
Passes my knowing also / and my wit
For dulled / is mine ymagenatyfe
To deem in practyke / or in speculatyfe
Wherefore I pass / and let it over slide
And forth I think / if ye list abide
Plainly to tell / of Jason and Me^ee
The which accorded / and assented be
That she with him / shall into greece wend
When that he gothe / shortly this the end
Vnwyste her fader / and every other wight
Save he alone / that has his truth plyght
For to be true / both in well and woo*
Unto his last / to her and to no moo.

How Jason took shyppynge with his love Medea / and sailed away with her. Ca.
vij.
ANd when Jason / after his Iournee
Full rychely / like to his degree
Refresshed was / in Colchos of the king
Withal that might / be to his liking
And amoneth passed / was and gone
He with his Greeks / assented into one
Purposed has / shortly if he might
With Medea / to stele away by night
That much treasour / and the rich flees
And full accord / also of Herculees.
But O Medea / thou hastest all to fast
Thou were to slow / wisely for to cast
What should fall / when you thy journey took
For how that he in myscheif the forsook
And how that he / was false and eke unkind
For all his oaths / to the as I find
And how that thou / both at eve and morrow
Thy fatal chance / and thy pytous sorrow
By weptest after / and began thy self to rende
Till death of all / made a woeful end
It were but vain / to make rehersayle
I wot no thing / that it might avail
Nor how Jason / unkind for the nones
Received has / penam talliones
Of the gods / for his disnaturelnesse
For he in myscheif / and in wretchedness
Made eke an end / thorugh the cruel hate
Of fell Mars / loo here the mortal fate
Of these twain / that made their end so
But as I trow / like as write Guydo
For their gynnynge / was not virtuous
An end follows / full contagyous
Alas if they had / take heed aforne
Than had they not / in myscheif be lorne
But who will not / before his myscheif se
May not eschew / to have aduersyte
In the end / platly to deuyne
For even like / right as a medecyne
Avails not / when the syke is deed
For what may help / the stomach or the heed
Letuarye emplaystre / or pocyon
Or any resseyt / or confeccyon
Herb or stone / or that leches know
When that the corpse / is laid in earth low.
Or when a be / is turned to careyne
Mine Auctor says / that it is but vein
For his recure / upon any halowe
To his ere / for to leyne a salowe
For verily / after his fantasye
It helps not / nor does no remedy
For thing parfourmed / in his due date
More virtue has / than when it comes to late
Rightsom case / verily semblable
Of worldly trust / false and full mutable
Who cast no peril / till that it be fall
Instead of sugre / often casts galle
Blended with lust / which that is present
Of the future / slouthe and neclygent
That them ne list / before no myscheif cast
Till in the snare / they be englued fast
For to provide / they be graceles
Full vnprudent / and wylfull recheles
To cast peril / or that it be tide
They sewe their lust / their reason goth aside
As it befelle / whylom of this two
Of Medea / and of Jason also.
But how so ever / of Jason that it be
I ^ynde plainly / the harm alone had she
The great damage / and the fynall smerte
For lack of wisdom / y^ she ne would aduerte
What should fall / when she her journey took
And her fader / folyly forsook
But sithe she wrought / oonly of wylfulnesse
Without counsel / or auysenesse
Me list no more / her harms to bewail
For little or naught / it might now avail
Let her alone / complain her damage
For well I wot / touching her passage
It was not take / in good plyte of the moon
Of hastynesse / she began to soon
Chesynge an hour / that was not fortunat
For she alone / of friends desolat
Colchos forsook / and is to ship gone
And in all haste / be bidding of Jason
Hercules / and all his company
That with him came / out of Thesalye
Without taryeng / at ones at a word
Yentred ben / within ships board
Oonly for cause / that the wind was good
And every thing / at their lust tho stood
And so by assent / they stale away by night
With all the treasoure / that they catch might
And with them ladde / plente of vytayle
And forth anon / they began to sail
By many cost / and many sundry I Will
Toward Greece / and all this mean while
Was Medea glad / and of good chere
She and Jason / sitting both yfere
And Hercules / of very gentylnesse
Her to comfort / did his business
All faynyngly / for the manner sake
As these lovers / full queynte can it make
Till they have had / holy their pleasaunce
Their lust fulfilled / than vttreth varyaunce
As it was preued / by Jason utterly
That has forsake / full unkindly
This Medea / in pain sorrow and woe
Of her Guydo / ne write no words mo
Nor makes of her / none other mencyon
Because I trow / in mine opinion
That her sorrows / end and every dele
Rehearsed be / full openly and well
Methamorphoseos / and write there full plain
Where as Naso / records in certain
Her death not oonly / nor her heaviness
But parcel eke / of the unkindness
Of this Jason / and tells plainly how
Medea / her both sons slow
For they were like / their fader of vysage
And tells eke / that put her most in rage
How falsely he / I can him not excuse
Loved a another / that called was Ceruse
Eke in his pysteles / who so takes head
Her deedly sorrow / he may behold and read
And how that she / her truth a boughte sore
Of Medea / ye get of me no more
In all this book / nor of her adventure
But I will now / do my besy cure
Holy to turn / my style to Jason
And of the werre / he made on Lamedon
Like as in Guydo / is openly descryued
After that he / in Greece was aryued.
FI rste when Jason / and Hercules also
I londed were / with many a another mo
In the land and reygne / of Thesalye
King Pelleus / with all his Cheualrye
Cast him plainly / that he will not fail
To mete his neuewe / at his aryuayle
And when they met / in countenance and ^here
Made it outward / as hole and as entere
As he had had / soueraygne gladness
Of his kynghthode / and his heyprowesse
Of his renown / and his manly head
Of his expleyte / and his good speed
And that fortune / to increase his name
Has caused him / with so noble fame
Out of Colchos / with honor to repair
All be his chere / was utterly contrayre
To his intent / that ever he came again
But for all that / with face hole and plain
He welcomed him / all against heart
Full sore astoned / that he ever asterte
The auentures / of Colchos / peryllous
And is returned / so victoryous
But covertly / his treason for to hyde
All delay / he began to set aside
And to Jason / with chere full benyngne
His heritage first / he began resygne
Septre and crown / and kingdom at the least
For to parfourme / the su^me of his beheste
Like as he was / assured by his bond
And Jason took / all into his hand
And began his uncle / in full low manner
First to thank / with all his heart entere.
And after that / full knyghtly began him pray
Goodly to here / what that he would say
Of a matere / that fret his heart sore
From day to day / encresynge ever more
Besechynge him / to grant him audyence
Tochynge a wrong / and a vyolence
Done unto him / when he no harm ne mente
In Torye land / to Colchos as he went
This is to say / the king of Troy town
Within the bonds / of his regyon
When I and mine / in great aduersyte
With wind and weder / for to drive in the sea
Us to refresshe / to land did aryue
Not in purpose / with him for to strive
But for to rest us / after all our woe
A little while / and forth anon to go
For we in sothe / no manner harm ne thought
But he vnkyngly / of very malys sought
Against us first / occasion
Bidding in haste / to void his regyon
Not withstondynge / that we come in pes
Like as my brother / knows hercules
Unto no might / doing no distress
Wherefore we pray / to your hye noblesse
To our purpose / for to condescende
Of which platly / this the fynall end
That we be set / in full conclusion
Holy to work / to his destruction
Like our auowe / when we thense went
If it so be / ye goodly list assent
And all at ones / strongly and not spare
Maugre his might / to Troy for to fare
So that we may / find in you favor
Us to refresshe / with gold and with creasoure
And oonly eke / of your curtesye
Us strength also / with your cheualrye.
And Pelleus / without more abode
Anon as he this matter / understood
Assented is of heart / and will also
In this vyage / with them for to go
And all the worthy / of that regyowne
Kings / dukes / and lords of renown
Be accorded / there is not one says nay
To go with them / and help what they may
And of this Journey / chyeue solycytour
Was hercules / the worthy conqueror.
And he in haste / his retenewe to make
Toward sparthos / has the way take
Which is an isle / to Greeks pertynent
Fully obeyeng / to their commandment
In which Pollux / and Castor eke also
The worthy kings / the mighty brethren two
Wereas I find / that time governors
And bare their crown / like noble werreours
And brothren were / also to Eleyne
And as poets / lyketh for to feyne
That Iubiter / for all his deyte
Upon Dyane / begat them all three
That in beauty / all other did excelle
And for Eleyne / like as books tell
Conceived was / in Tyndarys the isle
Unto the land / ioynynge / of Cecyle
Therefore of some / I find that she is
After the isle / called Tyndarys
Of their birth / me list no more to endyte
But forth I think / of hercules to write
That has besought / these noble k^ges twain
With mighty hand / to do their besy pain
Oonly to grant / with him for to wend
To Troy ward / shortly this the end
And to assente / they say not ones nay
With all the power / that they catch may
Again what time / that him list assygne
And hercules / with cherefull benyngne
Thanked them / of that they him behyght
And forth he went / in all the haste he might
Towarwe Messene / the strong mighty land
Within which / the noble king he fond
The knyghtly man / the worthy Thelamon
Lord and prince / of that regyon
That in arms was / one the manlyest
That was a live / and egall with the best.
And when he knew / that hercules was come
For ^oye he has / him in arms no^e
And received / in all manner thing
Like as it sat / to a worthy king
And when he wyste / sothely what he mente
Without more / anon he did assente
With him to gone Troyens for to grieve
And hercules / goodly took leave
And him enhasteth / to Thesalye again
To Pelleus / and tells him certain
How he has spedde / besechynge him also
In all the haste / that it may be do
To send letters / and his lords call
And to assemble / his worthy knights all
Thorugh out his land / both nygh and far
Such as he knew / that were expert in werre
And them also / that were of counsel sage
For wit of them / that be run in age
Is more than force / without experyence
But when manhood / is mente with sapyence
Who consydereth / it may double avail
And they that long / have used to travail
Like as it is / plainly to suppose
May help most / our journey to dispose
For unto age / experyence and wit
To youth force / and hardynesse sytte
And when that both / be of one intent
Fully accorded / to work by assent
With a quarrel / grounded upon right
Thorugh help of grace / y^ has treble might
Them that not dread / with spear nor with shield
In knyghtly wise / for to hold a field
For of knyghthode / the fame nor the glory
Nor in arms / conquest nor victory
Be not assured / upon multitude
But on manhood / so grace list conclude.
Therefore let us / for to avenge our wrong
First with right / make our self strong
And our force / manly for to show
Of knights chose / taken out a few
And deuoyde / encombraunce of nombre
And so we shall / our foes best encombre
And of all that / that hercules has said
King Pelleus / was right well apayde
For him thought / his counsel was right good
And hercules without more abode
Is in great haste / with his meyne gone
To aprouynce / that called is Phylon
In which there was / a duke of noble fame
And as I find / Nestor was his name
Full renowned / and strong of chyualrye
And he was eke / full nigh of allye
To hercules / and of the same blood
And when that he / plainly understood
The purpose hole / and cause of his coming
He granted him / without more tariynge
To go himself / with him in this vyage
With all the worthy / of his baronage
And to be ready / again a certain day
And hercules as fast / as ever he may
Repaired is home / to Thesalye
Where gadred was / holy the nauye
Of the lords / full ready apparayled
Well enarmed / and rychely vytayled.
And Pelleus / has taken first the sea
And every lord / like to his degree
I shypped is / and ready for to gone
With hercules / and also with Jason
Their behestes / manly to fulfylle
Toward Troy / the Cite for to spylle
And after that / sothely as I find
They not abide / but upon the wind.
How Jason Hercules / and all the Princes of Greece took their shyppynge / for
to go and destroy the cite of Troy. Ca. viii.
When y^ the sote storms / of Aprylle
Unto the root / full low began distylle
His lusty lycoure / with many wholesome shoure
To reyse the virtue / upon the flower
And Phoebus / was ascendynge in his spear
And on the breast / smote his bemes clear
Of the Ram / full coleryke at all
Halowynge in veer / the equynoxiall
When May kalendes / enter in for sothe
And zephyrus / full ageable and smothe
The tender branches / enspyreth and does spring
And every busshe / is lusty blossomynge
And from the hylle / the water is reuolued
Of snowes white / y^ Phoebus has dissolved
And the bawme / vapoureth up a lofte
Into the air / of the herbs soft
The rotes virtue / with cold of winter hid
Has hole his might / and his forse kydde
Out of the earth / in herb and every tree
Shade in the branches / his humydytee
Areysed oonly / with the sons hete
And with the moisture / of the raynes sweet
When silver wells / shedeth out their stremes
In the ryuers gylte / with the son bemes
And for he had / with new grene again
Her lyner shad / upon every plain
And nyghtyngalys / that all the wooed ronge
Full amorously / welcomed in their song
The lusty season / fresshe and desirous
Namely to hertes / that be amerous
And the sea his calour / and blaundysshynge
From trouble / of wind / or wawy bollynge
And from tempest / is sure to escape
The same season / Greeks forth them shape
Toward Troy / earls* dukes* and kings
Their ships stuffed / with all manner things
That to werre / might them most avail
And right anon / they began to sail
When all was ready / without more abode
Each ship by other / on the water rode
And when the wind / at their lust began blow
A joy it was / to se them go by row
Which made them fast / to have in their way
That in short time / they come ben to Troy
And in the haven / called Symeonte
When Phoebus / fer under their orysonte
I westred was / that men ne might him se
Greeks escaped / all peril of the sea
Cast their ancres / and thought for the best
In their ships / the same night to rest.
ANd in y^ morrow / when y^ lark song
The worthy Greeks / so ma^ly and so strong
Began to land / in all the haste they might
On Troy ground / and their tentys pyght^
Before the town / with great dylygence
For they ne found / no manner resystence
And all this while / they set good awayte
On every side / lest there were deceyte
Till on the hour / that the son bryghte
Had in the morrow / shade his rody light
Amyd the field / upon every tente
At which time / all of one assente
The Greeks were / assembled euerychon^
And by the bidding / of the king anon
Jason first / and with him hercules
With many worthy / being in that pres
Ben to the ten^e / of Pelleus come
And when the lords / both all and some
Were ^ogyder / in that place met
And each of them / in his degree was set
Than Pelleus / when al was whyste and still
Began right thus / to declare his will.
O noble and worthy / of hye estate and low
Whose knyghtly fame / through y^ world yknow
Reported is / as fer as shyneth son
That Greeks yet / never thing begone
That they ne had / victory at the end
For with the lawrer / as fer a men may wend
They crowned ben / of what they took on hand
Such is their hap / both on se and land.
Wherefore ye lords / most worthy of renown
Ye can remember / of king Lameoow^e
And of the wrong / y^ he upon you ^ rought
When harm to him / none of you ne thought
Which must be quyt shortly / this the end
For we be come / to stroye them and to shende
Wherefore anon / in all the haste we may
Let us set on / without more delay
But first I read / that we take heed
To things three / most helping in this need.
First by advise / and good discrecion
For our defense / and sauacion
So prudently / our wards for to make
That none of ours / be at myscheif take
This ylke day / for lack of prouydence.
The second is / to do our dylygence
With all our might / and hole entencion
For to labor / to full destruction
O four foes / for our own glory.
And the third / that we may victory
Rejoice of them / platly at the last
And after this / ye may before well cast
If we of knyghthod / thorugh our hardynesse
May venquysshe them / we shall so hyerychesse
Conquer of them / to our possessiowne
For it is known / how that Troy town
Of all plente / as it shall be found
Of gold and treasour / is passyngly habounde
That our ships / sothly as I wene
For to receive / ne shall not mow sustene
The habundaunce / that is yonder within
If it so be / that we the Cite wyn
As god us grant / if it be his will
And also fast / as the king was still
The noble knight / the strong hercules
In the presence / of that worthy pres
Said his counsel / was hyghly to commend
For wise beginning / is preysed by the end
But to effect / our purpose for to bring
My counsel is / in the morning
Tofore or we / discured ben by day
That we us arm / in all the haste we may
And on this field / that we do our pain
For to deuyde our main / into twain
And of the tone / shall king Thelamowne
Be governor / of his hye renown
And of the other / king Pelleus shall have
The governance / wisely them to save
And I myself / and Jason here my brother
Shall secretly / go with all the other
Under the Cite / or the sonneshynes
And in the busshayle / and the thycke vynes
We shall us hyde / and keep us there full koye
For Lamedon / that is king of Troy
Anon as he may / here and espy
Of the Greeks / with his chyualrye
Out of the cite / will Issue out anon
With you to fight / and venge him of his fone
But when he comes / to our ships ward
Nestor the duke / shall in the first ward
Mete with him / and Castor shall also
When he sees time / knyghtly have ado
To help Nestor / if that it be need
The third ward / Pelleus shall led
And whiles / ye thus him occupye
Jason and I / shall us fast hye
To the Cite / vnwyst of them echone
I doubt not / we shall it win anon
Does by counsel / and it will you avail
And here my truth / ye may not fail
For to conquer / the Cite yonder before
This all and some / ye get of me no more.
And they accord / with al their strength and might
And arm them / in steel y^ shone full bright
Again the son / at morrow when he ryseth
And wrought fully / as hercules deuyseth.
How the Greeks armed them upon the morrow / and fought with the Troyens / and
discomfyte them / and took their cite and distroyed it. Capitulo.ix.
ANd Lamedon / when he herd tell
Of their coming / h^ list no le^ger dwell
But out he went / with many a noble knight
Flourynge in youth / and desirous to fight
And all tho that might / arms bear
Or could sho^e / or durst handell a spear.
And when they were / assembled in the field
Eueryche his arms / depeynt upon his shield
Brouded or beat / upon his coote armure
Than Lamedone / with all his besy cure
Set them inordre / and his wards makes
And in the field / forth his way he takes
Toward the Greeks / as any lyneryght
Fully purposynge / to abide and fight
He was not ware / of them that were behind
He not aduerteth / nor casts in his mind
The great sleyghte / nor the trecherye
That him was shape / he could it not espy
But forth he went / with his wards set
And the Greeks anon / with him has met
With heart bold / astoned not at all
Duke Nestor / first sturdy as a wall
In whose manhod / was never found lack
Full knyghtly than / upon horse back
To heart his men / and his knights eke
Began prese in with many worthy Greek
With Lamedon / sturdely to mete
At which time / they felt it full vnswete.
And in the frountell / full many manly man
With sharp speres / first together ran
And with swerdes sharp / and kene ground
Was thylke day / given many a wound
Where as they met / upon every side
Through plate and mayle / their wou^des bled wide
And basenettes / they ryue to the crown
The noise of strokes / in the air began sown
And of the blood / that was shad of new
The Grene soil / changed has his he we
For it was dyed / plainly into reed
Upon the which / full many man lay deed
And many worthy / lost there his life
And certainly / in this mortal strife
The greeks had discomfyted be echone
Ne had Castor / socoured them anon
They of Troy / so manly have them bore
That many a knight / of greeks was I lore
But when Castor / enters in battle
With his knights / so sore he did assail
The worthy Troyans / y^ with spear and shield
Greeks again / recouerde have the field
That many one lies slain on the grene
Gyrt thorugh the body / with sharp speres kene
That they of Troy / in this mortal stoure
Were drive a back / till there came socoure
To them in haste / of worthy Lamedowne
Which entrede in / like a wood lyowne
And made way / upon every side
And where as he made / his sword to glyd^
There was but death / so manly he him bare
That well uneath / was there none that dare
Abide his stroke / for riding up and down
He made way about / him enuyrowne
In the renges / he has his foen out sought
That day i arms meruailes has he wrought
Than by his manhod / and his worthynesse
He greeks has brought / in such distress
That they his sword / fled as the death
Mercyles / so many of them he sleeth
Of which slaughter / the greeks were confuse
Till Pelleus / came to their rescuse
Irous and wood / as he were fall in rage
He thought he would the great pomp aswage
Of them of Troy / and so he did an one
For he vnhorseth / of them many one
And felly slough / all that stood him aforne
And many harneys / he has that day to torn
And made sheldes / for to ryue a sondre
That to behold / it was a very wondre
Till lamedone / his people saw go back
For Pelleus / brought them so to wrack
Whereof in heart / he felt full great pain
Besechynge them / to repair again
And kythe their might / and like as men endure
And so the field / he made them to recure.
Till duke Nestor / knew that lamedowne
Amyd the field / was king of Troy town
And right anon / without more abode
Against him / a full great pase he rode
And when the king / did him first espy
Of hye dispyte / of rancour and envy
In knyghtly wise / began to turn again
No thing aghast / but of hye disdain
With Irous heart / enbolled all with pride
His hor^ fyersly / began take in the side
Till there ran out / the very read blood
And to Nestor / like as he were wood
He rode anon / and his spear brake
But he full knyghtly / kept his horse bake
And full delyue^ly / him again to quyte
With a spear full sharp / whette to byte
Thorugh sheld and breast / gave him such a wound
That fro his horse / he field h^ down to ground
Of which fall / the king no thing a ferde
But ro^e him up / and drew out his sword
So anger fret him / at his heart rote
That he unhorsed / fight must on foot
Whereof he was / in party full confuse
Till one Cedar / came to his rescuse
That was made knight / the self same year
Young fresshe and lusty / and of noble chere
Sitting that time / on a noble stead
And when that he / began to take heed
And saw the king / on foot at myscheif fight
Began to pryke / in all the haste he might
Toward Nestor / and with a spear hymhytte
From his sadell / that he made him f^ytte
Down to the ground / before king lamedon
But he anon / like a champion
Recured up / and him self diffendeth
And many a stroke / each on other spends
With sharp swerdes / kene for to byte
Eueryche at other / began to foyne and smite
Till lamedone / with a dispytous chere
From his face / rased his viser
And by force / all at ones smet
A rich cercle / from his basenet
Of large perle / going enuyrowne
With creste / and all he fyersly beat a down
That whiles Nestor / thus before him stood
His face was all depeynt / with blood
That certainly / the sothe to conclude
Had not greeks / with great multitude
Rescued him / he had of lamedowne
Beslayne as fast / for he was bore down
Unto the earth / among the horse f^te
But Castor thought / that he ne would let
To be his help / as he byhelde a fere
And Irously / he took a mighty spear
And to Cedar / that I spoke of late
He began to ride / and prycke in great hate
But or he came / and took him douteles
A troyan knight / called Segnerides
Cosyn to Cedar / when he has this seen
On a courser / rode anon between
And with a spear / he smote Castor so
That with the stroke / it brake even a two
To whom Castor / without more areste
Has with a spear / amyddes of the breast
Segnerides / give a mortal wound
That lykly was / never for to sound
Wherefore Cedar / caughte such envy
That he anon of melancolye
And of despyte / boylynge in his heart
Segnerides / when he saw so smerte
Maugre who grutcheth / amyddes of the field
Of very might / from Castor took his shield
And thorugh vyser / of rancour and of rage
He wounded him / amyddes his vysage
And his horse / fro him also he caughte
And to his squire / manfully it raughte
That certainly / he stood in such disioynt
This worthy Castor / that he was in point
To have be taken / of them of Troy tho
For he on foot / with him must have go
Ne had Pollux / with many manly knight
Mo than.vii. hundred / in steel armed bright
The rather come / Castor to rescewe
Which after them / so soregan to sewe
That maugre them / Castor when he fond
Of force / he took him fro out of their hand
And to his horse restored / him again
And after that this / Pollux in certain
Of very anger / and of fervent Ire
Again troyens / with rancour set a fire
That all at ones / he upon them set
And in his mode / by fortune as he met
A troyan knight / called Elyatus
In arms young / fresshe and desirous
Wonder semely / and but tender of age
The kings sone / also of Cartage
And neuewe eke unto Lamedon
When Pollux / has like a fyers lion
Without routhe / pity or mercy
In the renges / slain cruelly
That lamedone / when he began take heed
Of inward dole / felt his heart blede
When he him saw / even upon the death
Full pytously / yield up the brethe
Upon the plain / as he lay him beforne
For which anon / he made sown a horn
At which time / there came in full rich array
Seven. M. knights / in all the haste they may
Upon his death avenged for to be
Which mercyles / of great cruelte
The Greeks have here / and there I grounded
Here lies one deed / there another wounded
So that they might / with them have no take
So mortally / they made them go abake
That all began turn / to their confusion
And finally / that day with lamedon
The tryumphe had / and the field I gone
Save that alas / out of the town anon
Unto the king / there came a messangere
That has him told / with a full pytous chere
How the Greeks / have his Cite take
Than for to se / the woe he did make
It would have made / a pytous heart as blyue
Of very dole / a sondre for to ryue
So sore he began / within him self to morn
He wyste not what party he may torn
But in a weer / he abiding long
Before him saw / the mighty greeks strong
And in the Cite / another host behind
Almost for woe / he went out of his mind
And suddenly bakwarde / as he beheld
Toward the cite / he saw come in the field
First hercules / and with him Jason
That by their sleyghte / won had the town
And in all haste / this cruel hercules
The mighty gyaunt / of force pereles
Like a lion / wood and despytous
Or a Tygre / in rage furyous
Began of new / them of Troy assail
And with his sword / perce plate and mayle
Which of labor / were full mate and feynt
And of long fight / with werynesse atteynt
And he came in lusty / fresshe and grene
That they his force / might not sustene
For as he rode / among them here and yonder
In cruel wise / he severed them a sonder
And put them holy / in this hye myschaunce
Out of reule / and of governance
So that the king / oppressed all with dole
Of his wards / destytute and sole
At myscheif left / and all infortunat
And of comfort / fully disconsolat
This Hercules / with despytous look
With sharp spores / his stead felly took
And cruelly rode / to lamedowne
And to the earth fyersly / bare him down
And upon him / in all the haste he might
Down of his horse / suddenly a light
And myghtely / rent of his Basenette
And with a sword sharp / ground and whette
Smote of his head / there was none other grace
And cast it forth / in the self place
Among the horse / by cruel vyolence
Without pity / or any reverence
And in arage / raughte his horse again
And like alyon / rennynge on the plain
Baredowne and sloughe / what came in his weye
And many troyan / that day made them deye
That like to sheep / were for skatered wide
All destytute / of governor or guide
Ne can no read / shortly to conclude
For the Greeks / with double multitude
Began them enchace / to the death full blyue
That well uneath / there left none a live
The field they have (...) victours
And (...) tryumphe^ like as conquerours
To the Cite / they took their way after
And ^ende down / both spa^ce and rafter
And all the treasour and richesse of the town
They took anon to their possessy own
Who ever grutche / or be lefe or loathe
What they found / plainly with them gothe
In the temples / they did great offense
To the gods / doing no reverence
(...) they spoil / without dread or fere
And unto ship / every thing they bear
(...) ^^yles / on crooked old and lame
(...) ^werdes they made / cruelly to a tame
And children soukynge at their moders breast
They murdre and sle / without more areste
(...) young maidens / weeping in distress
(...) gentle borne / and of great fayrenesse
(...) them they ladde / and may them not excuse
(...) fresshe beauty / falsely to mysuse
They waste and brenne / and consume all
And without / they brake a down the wall
And Exyone / the kings daughter dear
That was to him passyngly entere
By his life / I mean lamedon
Meke and benyngne / of condycion
Hercules has anon her take
That for dread / pyteously began quake
(...) delivered / unto The^am^wne
(...) / first into the town
(...) his gift / received has at gree
Because she was / surmountynge of beautee
And tretyde her / after as he would
Not like as he / a kings daughter should
For sithe he gat her / that day by victory
For his worship / and his own glory
Having regard / to her hye degree
He should rather / of knyghtly honestee
And of knyghthode / have wedded her therefore
With that she was of blood / so gentle bore
Wan of false lust / again all goodlyhede
(...) her beauty / and her womanhede
Dishonestly / and in sinful wise
Of royal blood / not like the hye empryse
Nor the doctrine / of natures right
Nor like nurture / of a gentle knight
Consydred first / her birth and her kynrede
Her grene youth / and her maydenhede
So good so fair / so womanly thereto
A kings daughter / of birth she was also
(...)had been of name
Now (...) thou were to blame
For thorugh^ (...) of thy governance
There kynled was / of full hye vengaunce
So hot a spark / after of envy
That thorugh ye world / the fire began multeply
Which was not light / to quench of his hete
For ha^^^ old / to brenne can not let
With new flawme / who so takes head
If it not smoke / it is the more to dread
As in this storye / hereafter shall be know
and wha^ this town was brent / and brought low
Both toure and wall / with the soil made pleyn
And no thing stood / of all that might be (...)
So utterly the Greeks / them oppress
Making all waste / like a wilderness.
For good and tresour / and richesse (...)
With many jewel / full plesynge of delight
To their ships / out of the town they led
And in short time / homwarde they them speed
With treasour stuffed / and habundaunce of good
And when they saw / that the weder stood
The wind also / at their lust they had
They began to sail / and with them home they ladde
Exyone / and many a maid moo
That out of Troy / into Greece goo
And saylynge forth / within a little space
They be escaped / fro the sea by grace
And unto land / aryued merely
At whose coming / the greeks utterly
So joyful be / of their good speed
And specially in Guydo as I read
Their ships were / with gold and (...) lade

Of their meyne / they thank their gods all
And of the grace / that to them is fall

So much good / and so great su^^ysaunce
That no wyghte / had among them no need
And many day / this blessydfull life they led
From year to year / by reuoluciowne
And for their manhood / and their hye renown
Their honor ran / round the world about
That them to offend / many land has doubt
For their knyghthode / and for they were so wise
And till the storye / list again deuyse
In this manner ferther to proceed
With the favor / of your goodlyhede

THe enuyous order / of fortunat meuy^ge
In worldly thing / false and flykerynge

Of which in sothe / I well afferme dare

For she uneven / peysynge in balaunce
With countrefete / and feigned countenance
With lokynge plain / and chere of flaterye
Unawarely can blere / a man's eye

Wha^ she has him fro hye degree / brought low
Full falsely smyle / and make him the mow
And yet somwhyle / most varyaunt of hew
She unto some / pretends to be true
For she whylom to some / is favorable
And to some / false and deceyuable
She can reyse one / and bring another down
This false lady of transmutaciowne
To some she gives / renown and victory
And does them flower / in honor and in glory
And some she can apayre / with false fame
And gyltles / put a man in blame
To some she is / goodly and benyngne
And of disdain / she can also malygne

And from their sees / she can kings throw

And she can plonge / worthy Emperors
From the hylle / of hye prosperyte

This false goddess / with her eyes blind
Set one before / a another gothe behind
And does one run / and a another halte
And one she can / in richesse hye exalte

Wherefore I read / every man take heed
To gynne a quarrel / where as is no need
For little fire / under ashes reke
So may be kyndled / that it will out break
Into such flawme / men may it not a pease
Who best can suffer / most shall have his ease
Therefore ye kings / and lords euerychone
Make you a myrour / of this lamedone
And be well ware / to do no vyolence
Unto strangers / when they do none offense
When they come / fer into this regyon
Ne suffer them not / by none oppressyon
In your bounds / for to have no wrong
For in your own / though that ye be strong

A another day / perauenture may be fall
That when that ye / full little think on it
Of sudden case / that ye may be quyt
And I thanked / in a another place
Of adventure / if ye hap pace
Therefore when ye may any such espy
Do them good chere / of your curtesye
And prudently / consider in your wit
That to a lord / of gentyllesse it sit
To every stranger / goodly him to have
There is no thing / may more his honor save
Than to refresshe them freely / and disporte
Than may they after / good of him report
By whose contrary / has much woe be wrought
Before this time / if it be well sought
The first Troy / utterly destroyed
And the people / in sorrow and woe a cloyed
Lad into exyle / fer fro their Cite
Living in thraldom / and captyuyte
And Exyone / as ye have herd me tell
Lad into Greece / with Thelamon to dwell
For whom there was / as Guydo can you teache
After take / so great vengaunce and wreche
On either part / that in very truth
For to here / it is to much routhe
As in this book / ye may after read
Ceryously / if ye list take heed
For gladly aye / the reuolusion
Of fatal thing / by disposicion
Is so enuyous / and always meynt with woe
That in this world / where so that we go
We truly may aduerte in our thought
That for the value / of a thing of naught
Mortal causes / and werres first begone
And strife and debate / here under the son

That caused after / great confusion
That noman can / the harms half endyte
For a cause / dear Enough a myte
Each is ready / to destroy other
A man for little / will strive with his brother
Blood is unkind / which greatly is to dread
Alas / why ne will they take better head
For old Troy / and after the new
Thorugh small encheson / who y^ truth knew
Were finally brought / to distruccion
As old books / make mention
And many worthy / and many noble knight
Slain in the field / by dute^^e of that fight
Kings princes / at the sege deed
When Attropos / to break their lives threde
That for to tell / the myscheif and the woe
I want conning / and I feel also
My pen quake / and tremble in my hand
List that my lord / dradde on see and land
Whose worthynes / through ye world does sprede
My making rude / shall behold and read
Which of color / full naked is and bare
That but if he / of his grace spare
For to disdain / and list to have pity
For fere I tremble / that he should it se.
But only mercy / yt does his heart enbrace
Bid me presume / fully in his grace
Seeing in him / most virtuous and good
Mercy anexed / unto royal blood
As to a prince longs / nyghe and far
Aye tofore right / pity to prefer
For thorugh the supporte / of his hye noblesse
Sowpowayled / I will my style dress
To write forth / the storye by and by
Of new Troy / in order ceryously
As mine Auctour / in latin Guydo wryt
Prayeng the reder / where my word myssyt
Causynge the meter / to be halte or lame
For to correct / to save me fro blame
Let him not wait / after curyosyte
Sith that in ryme / English has scarste
I am so dull / certain that I ne can
Follow Guy do that clerk / that coryous man
Which in latin / has by rethoryke
Set so his words / that I can not be like
To sewe his style / in my translacion
Word by word / like the construccion
After the manner / of gramaryens
Nor like the style / of rethorycyens
I took not on me / this storye to translate
For me to further / Clyo came to late
That in such craft / has great experyence
I leave these words / and follow the sentence
And truth of meter / I set also a side
For of that art / I had as tho no guide
Me to reduce / when I went a wrong
I took none head nouther of short nor long
But to the truth / and left euryosyte
Both of making / and of meter be
Not purposynge / to much for to varye
Nor for to be diverse / nor contrary
Unto Guydo / as by discordaunce
But me conform / fully in substance
Oonly in menynge / to conclude all one
All be that I ne can / the way gone
To sewe the flowers / of his eloquence
Nor of peyntynge / I have none excellence
With sundry hewes / noble fresshe and gay
So rich colors / byggen I ne may
I must proceed / with sable and with black
And in ennewynge / where ye find a lack
I axe mercy / or I fro you twynne
And with your favor / I will anon begin
And in all haste / my style forth dyrecte
And where I err / I pray you to correct.
THe same time / when yt Troy town
Destroyed was / and king lamedowne
Was also slain / thorugh the cruelte
Of hercules / under his eyte
He had a sone / the storye tells us
Which was his heyce / y called Pryamus
Wonder manly / discrete and prudente
Which that time / from Troy was absent
When his fader / lost there his life
For he that time / with Ecuba his wife
And with his sons / about a castle lay
And all his knights / to get it if they may
That has on them / myghtely werreyed
For they his fader have falsely disobeyed
And unto him / be rebel wonder long
All be Pryam / with sautes huge and strong
Them had assailed / often and many sithe
His strength on them / like a knight of kythe
To get in arms / worship and honor
And them to daunte / like a conqueror
He cast him fully / or that he depart
For day by day / his life he began Iuparte
At their walls for to preue his might
With many baron / and many worthy knight
For he yet had / his young lusty blood
And was in age / flowrynge in knyghthode
And at assautes / and such manner strife
On with the first / for to auntre his life
To heart his men / him list not be behind
For dread of death / sothly as I find
Before the castle / hye and thycke walled
And by his wife / that Ecuba was called
This Pryam / had full worthy of degree
Five sons / and young daughters three.
Of which the eldest / Ector called was
Which also fer as Phoebus / in compass
A naturell day / goth his cercle about
So fer of him / without any doubt
Reported was / the renown and the name
The worthynesse / and the noble fame
For like as books / of him specefye
He was the root / and stock of chyualrye
And of knyghthod / very soueraygne flower
The sours and well / of worship and honor
And of manhod / I dare it well express
Example and myroure / and of hye prowess
Gynnynge and ground / and with all this yfere
Wonder benygne / and lowely of his chere
Discrete also / prudent and virtuous
Of whom the deeds / and acts meruaylous
Remembered ben / of so long a gone
For he alone / excelled euerychone
In old Auctours read / and ye may find
Of his knyghthod / how yet they make mind
The next brother / called was Paris
To whom nature / gave to herdeuys
Of shap and form / beauty and semelynesse
That to remember / his excellent fayrenesse
In his time / without any dread
He passed all / that I can of read
And he was eke / a full manly knight
But most he used / when he should fight
In his hand / for to bear abowe
For such an archer / no man could know
For to seek / both fer and nere
That of shotynge / might be his pere
As it was found / when he had a do
And Alysaundre / called was also
The third sone / hyghte Dephebus
A worthy knight / and a chyualrous
And had in arms / a full great renown
And was a man of hye discreciowne
And wise of counsel / mine auctor tells thus
The fourth brother / called Helenus
Sad and discrete / and of hye prudence
And was also a man / of great scyente
And reno^med therewith / in special
In all the arts / called lyberall
For he in them / was expert a right
The fyfte sone / was a worthy knight
Fresshe and lusty / and youngest of them all
And as says / Guydo / Troylus men him call
A manly man / found in barayle
And desirous / his fomen to assail
One of the best / in his time found
And called was / Ector the secounde
For his manhood / thorugh out Troy book
Within the werre / full often upon him took
Of his knyghthod / many hye empryse
As the storye hereafter / shall deuyse.
And in his book / like as write virgyle
The poet old / by full soueraynestyle
How that the king Pryam / had also
By Ecuba / other sons two
And by record / of this virgilius
The one was called / Pollyodorus
Whom Pryamus / in his grene youth
When the coming was / of greeks kouthe
To Troy ward / in all haste anon
With gold treasour / and many rich stone
Sent him forth / beside unto a king
Of full great trust / to have him in keeping
Till time he saw / what conclusiowne
There should fall after / of the town
And eke what fine / the werre would take
That upon them / the greeks did make.
But thylke king / for false couetyse
Of his treasour / that ye have herd deuyse
When that he saw / fortunes varyaunce
Towward Pryam / and his unhappy chance
Like a tyrant / and murdrer also
The childs throat / made cut a two
And after that he / full cruelly
Made his men / to burye him pryuely
That no man might / his treson understand
Beside a see deep / under the stronde.
The other sone / also as Irede
In virgyle / was called Ganymede
Whom Iubyter / in a forest hente
Gpon a day / as he on hunting went
And bare him up / above the sterres clear
And made him in heaven / his botelere
Eternally with him / for to wone
Instead of hebes / his own dear sone.
The first daughter / of king Pryamus
Hight Creusa / as says virgilius
In his Eneydos / sothly as it was
And she was wedded / unto Eneas
As says this storye / and eke this ylke Enee
Was wonderful / in his natyuyte
Of whom the fader / I find doutles
Was in his time / called Anchyses
That him begat / on Venus the goddess
For after her / he had such fayrenesse
That never wight / ne could yet I se
A man that was more / passing of beauty
Of whom this storye / touching his workynge
Shall you declare / many wonder thing
For it is he / to whom so great a los
Virgyle gave / in his Eneydos
For he that book / in worship of Enee
Compyled has / like as ye may se
Of his knyghthod / and many strong battle
By him acheued / or he wan Itayle
After full long / that the royal town
Of Troy / was brought to confusiowne
And his conquest / if ye list take heed
In this poet / ye may by order read
And in arms wrought / in all his age
And his coming / also to Cartage
Fro Troyewarde / in a little while
All this ye may / behold in virgyle.
Another daughter / also it is found
King Pryam had / of birth the second
Called cassandra / of full great sadness
And was in manner / a dyuyneresse
And in each art / had experyence
Of things futur / fully prescyence
To tell before / what that shall betyde
Of whom the fame / sprange in costs wide
Which kept hirchaste / in virgynyte
And aye in prayers / and in honest
She ladde her life / and in devotion
After the rytes / and relygyon
Of paganysme / used in tho says
The obseruaunces / keeping of theyrlayes.
The third daughter / hight Pollycene
Youngest of all / and ever a maydeclene
She kept her self / and honest in her law
Unto the time / that Pirrus has her slawe
Of shap of fortune / was never by nature
Wrought nor shap / a fayrer creature
Eke as I find / this noble king also
Had thyrty sons / the book says and no mo
Hardy in arms / and noble found at all
That called were / his sons natural
And they were all / I except none
Worthy knights / and manly men echone
And their names / who so list to know
He shall find them write / upon arowe
After this storye / eueryche after other
Beginning first / at the eldest brother.
And whiles Pryam / at the sege lay
Tofore the castle / to get it if he may
And theraboute / has many way sought
The woeful tidings / be unto him brought
How the greeks / have take Troy town
And slain his fader / worthy Lamedowne
And how the cite / of old foundaciowne
Full pytously / was turned up so down
The worthy lords / and gentle men echone
Taken and slain / and I left not one
Of them a live / thorugh greeks cruelte
After the ruin / alas of their cite
And Exion / his own suster dear
Lad into exyle / with her eyes clear.
Wherefore the king / in heart is stoned so
For very sorrow / he ne wyste what to do
His sudden woe / began him so constrayne
He sobbeth wepeth / that of mortal pain
He thought his heart / would a sonder breast
Of hye distress / for he might have no rest
And into teeres / he began himself dislylle
That for to deye / was finally his will.
And fortune / that can so falsely varye
With drery heart / he began to warye
That she to him / was so deceyuable
So inly cruel / and vnmercyable
So dispytous / and so stern of face
So vengeable / and deuoyde of grace
For of envy / with a rage thought
She has her wreste / of malys on hy^ wrought
And felly showed / what she might do
That in this world / was never wight so woe
As I suppose / of no manner age
To reken / all her harms and damage
For which anon / in all that ever he may
Fast he changes / all his rich array
Tryste and heavy / with deedly face pale
So astoned / with this mortal tale
That his desire was / to have be deed
With countenance enclyned / his head
This life he ladde / and cladde him all in black
And sodaynely / he the sege bracke
And would as tho / no longer there abide
But with his folk / anon he began to ride
That pyteously / began with him to morn
And toward Troy / attones they return.
And when that he / has the cite found
Plain with the soil / and even with the ground
The hye walls / whylom thycke and long
I vere down / that were made so strong
And his toures / and paleys pryncypall
That was in byldynge / so excellent royal
So famous rich / and of great nobylnesse
He fond turned into wilderness
His people slain / his suster ladde away
For very woe / he ne wyste what to say
For the constreynt / of his aduersyte
And for his harms / that will not recured be
For in that time / he was fully sure
Upon no side / there was no recure
Wherefore he can not / but sobbe and weep
And from his breast / with syghes sought full deep
Broken out / with a deed vysage
And thus alas / in this furyous rage
Full pyteously / all his hooste and he
Without respyte / contynewe days three
Till at the last / the derke skies black
Began of their woe / in party for to slack
And the tempest / some delegan withdraw
And of their weeping / bla^dysshe began y^ wawe
And when the floode of woe / is over paste
The ebb of joy / follow must in haste
To sorrow ever / it would their hertes shende
And at a term / every woe must end
For though for friends / men aye weep and wayle
After their death / there may no recure veil
Wherefore the king / after all his care
Has sought a way / the cite to repare
And cast him fully / if it would be
To make reuerture / of necessyte
And manfully / after all his tene
When that the air / began to wexe clean
Of the mystes / of his cloudy sorrow
And that somedele adawe / began the morrow
Of heaviness / after the derke night
Chaced away / with a son bright
Of new joy / for aye the fine of woe
Must be gladness / when that sorrow is go
And so Pryam / after a certain space
When his sorrow / began lyte and lyte pace
And of wisdom / in all his pytous smerte
Began prudently / to pluck up his heart
And of his eyes / the wawes began clear
Anon he wrought / right as ye shall here.
How king Pryamus sone unto king La medone builded Troy new again. Ca. xi.
THe sorrow aswaged / and the syghes old
By long process / like as I you told
This worthy king / called Pryamus
In his heart now / so desirous
Upon the plain / that was so waste and wild
So strong a town / of new for to bylde
At his deuyse / a cite edefye
That shall the assautes / utterly defye
Of all enmyes / and his mortal foone
With rich toures / and walls of hard stoone
And all about / the countres enuyron
He made seek / in every regyon
For such workmen / as were curyous
Of wit inuentyfe / of casting meruaylous
Or such as could craft / of gemetrye
Or were sotyll / in their fantasye
And for eueryche / that was good a deuysous
Mason hewer / or crafty quarreour
For every wryghte / and passing carpenters
That may be found far or nere
For such as could / grave groupe or kerue
Or such as were / able for to serve
With lyme and stone / for to reyse a wall
With bataylynge / and crestes marcyalle
Or such as had / konnynge in their head
Alabastre / outher white or read
Or marbyll graye / for to pullysshe it plain
To make it smothe / of veins and of grain
He sent also / for every ymagour
Both in entayle / and every portreyour
That could draw / or with color peynte
With hewes fresshe / yt the work not feynte
And such as could / with countenance glade
Make an Image / that will never fade
To countrefete / in metal tree or stoon
The sotyll work of pygmaleon
Or of Appollo / the which as books tell
In ymagerye / all other did excelle
For by his crafty workynge curyous
The tomb he made / of king daryous
Which Alysaundre / did on heyght reyse
Oonly for men / should his fame preyse
In his conquest / by perce when he went
And thus Pryam / for every master sent
For each keruere / and passing ioygnyour
To make knottes / with many curyous flower
To set on crestes / within and without
Upon the wall / the Cite round about
Or who that were / excellynge in practyke
Of any art / called mecanyke
Or had a name flowrynge / or famous
Was after sent / to come to pryamus.
For he purposes / this noble worthy king
To make a cite / most royal in byloynge
Broad large and wide / and list it were assailed
For werre / proudely about enbatayled
And first the ground / he made to be sought
Full deep and low / that it fail naught
To make sure / the foundaciowne
In the place / where the old town
Was first ybylded / he the walls set
And he of land / many mile out met
About in compass / for to make it large
As the maystres / that took on them the charge
Devised have / the setting and the syte
For wholesome air / to be more of delight.
And when the soil / defouled with ruin
Of walls old / was made plain as a line
The workmen began / this Cite for to found
Full myghtely / with stones square and round
That in this world / was to it none lyche
Of workemanshyp / nor of byldynge rich
Nor of craft / of curyous masonrye
I can no terms / to speak of gemetrye
Wherefore as now / I must them set aside
For douteles / I radde never Enclyde
That the master / and foundour was
Of all that work / by quare or compass
Or keep their measure / by level or by line
I am to rude / clearly to diffyne
Or to discryue / this work in every part
For lack of terms / longing to that art
But I dare well of truth / afferme here
In all this world / ne was there never his pere
Unto this cite / and write it for a sothe
As in his book / my master Guydo does
And that it might / in prosperyte
In hye honor / and felycyte
From all assaute / perpetuelly contune
It was raised / in worship of Neptune
And named Troy / as it was to forne
Like the first / that was thorugh greeks lorne
The length was shortly / to conclude
Three days iourne / like the latytude
That never I herd / make mention
Of such a another / of foundation
So huge in compase / nor of such largess
Nor to count / so passing of fayrenesse
So edefyed / or iusty to the syghte
And as I read / the walls were on hyghte
Two hundred cubytes / all of marbyll graye
Magecolled without / for lautes and assaye
And it to make / more pleasant of delight
Among the marbyll / was alabastre white
Meynt in the walls / and round y^ town about
To make it show / within and without
So fresshe so rich / and so delectable
That it alone / was in comparable
Of all cytes / that any mortal man
Saw ever yet / sithe the world began
And at the corner / of every wall was set
A crown of gold / with rich stones frette
That shone full bright / again y^ son shene
And every toure / bretexed was so clean
Of chose stone / that were not fer a sondre
That to behold / it was very wondre
Thereto his cite / compassed enuyrowne
Had gates.vi. to enter into the town
The first of all / and strengest eke with all
Largest also / and most pryncypall
Of mighty byldynge / alone pereles
Was by the king called / Dardanydes
And in storye / like as it is found
Tymbria / was named the second
And the third / called helyas
The fourth gate / hyghte also Cetheas
The fyfte Troiana / the syxth Anthonydes
Strong and mighty / both in werre and pes
With square toures / set on every side
At whose corners / of very pomp and pride
The workmen have / with stern fell vysages
Of rich entayle / set up great Images
Wrought out of stone / yt never are like to fail
Full curyously / enarmed for battle
And thorugh the wall / their fomen for to let
At every toure / were great gonnes set
For assautes / and sudden auentures
And on tourettes / were raised up fygures
Of wild beestes / as beres and lions
Of Tygres bores / of serpents and dragons
And hertes eke / with their broad horns
Olyfauntes / and large vnycornes
Bugles bulls / and many great gryf^on
Forged of brass / of coper and laton
That cruelly by signs / of their faces
Upon their foon / made fell menaces
Barbycans / and bull works huge
Before the town / made for hye refuge
If need were / erely and eke late
And portekoles strong / at every gate
That them need not / none assaylynge charge
And the locks thycke / broad and large
Of the gates / all of bright bras
And within the mighty shyttynge was
Of strong Iren bars / square and round
And great bars / pytched in the ground
With huge cheynes / forged for diffence
Which ne would break / for no vyolence
That hard it was / thorugh them for to win
And every house / that was bylded within
Every paleys / and every manstowne
Of marbell were / thorughout all the town
Of crafty byldynge / and workynge most royal
And the hyghte was / of every wall
Sixty cubytes / from the ground accounted
And there was none / yt other has surmounted
In the Cite / but of one heyghte alyche
In very sothe / both of pore and rich
That it was hard / of hye estate or low
House or paleys / a sonder for to know
So egally of tymbre / and of stone
Their houses were / raised euerychone
And if I should rehearse / by and by
The korue knottes / by craste of masonry
The fresshe enbowy^ge / with verges right as lines
And the housynge / full of bakewynes
The rich koynynge / the lusty tablementes
Vynettes rennynge / in casementes
Though the terms / in English would ryme
To reken them all / I have as now no time
Ne no langage / pycked for the nones
The sotyll ioynynge / to tell of the stones
Nor how they put / instead of mortere
In the ioyntoures / coper gylte full clear
To make them join / by level and by line
Among the marbyll / fresshely for to shine
Against the son / when his shene light
Smote on the gold / that was burned bright
To make the work / glystre on every side
And of this town / the streets large and wide
Were by craft / so prudently provided
And by werkmen set so and divided
That wholesome air / amyddes might enspyre
Erely on morrow / to them that it desire
And zephyrus / that is so comfortable
For to norysshe things / vegetable
In time of year / thorughe out every street
With sugared flauour / so lusty and so sweet
Most plesauntly / in the air began smite
The Cytezeynes / oonly to delight
And with his brethe / them to recomforte
When they list walk / themself to disporte.
And through ye town / with crafty purueaunce
By great auyse / and discrete ordenaunce
By compase cast / and squared out by squyers
Of polysshed marble / upon strong pyllers
Devised were / long large and wide
In the frontell / of every streets side
Fresshe alures / with lusty hye pynacles
And moustrynge outward / rich tabernacles
Vouted above / like reclynatoryes
That called were / deambulatoryes
Men to walk togyders / twain and twain
To keep them dry / when it did rain
Or them to save / fro tempest wind or thundre
If that them list / shroude themself there under
And every house covered / was with leede
And many gargoyle / and many hydous heed
With spoutes thorugh / and pypes as they aughte
From the stone work / to the canell taught
Voydynge fylthes / low into the ground
Thorugh grates perced / of iron perced tounde
The streets paued / both in length and bread
In cheker wise / with stones white and read
And every craft / that any manner man
In any land / deuyse or reken can
King Pryamus / of hye discreciowne
Ordained has / to dwell in the town
And in streets severed / here and yonder
Eueryche from other / to be set a sonder
That they might / for more co^modyte
Each by himself / work at lyberte.
Goldsmythes first / and rich Iewelleres
And by themfelfe / crafty browdereres
Weuers also / of woollen and of lyn
Of clothe of gold / damask and satyn
Of velvet sendell / and dowble samyt eke
And eueryche clothe / that men list to seek
Smythes also / that could forge well
Pollaxes swerdes / and speres sharp of stele
Darts daggers / for to mayme and wound
And quarethedes / sharp and square ygrounde
There were also crafty armerers
Bowyers / and fast by fletchers
And such as could / make shaftes plain
And other eke / that did their besy pain
For the werre / to make also trappures
Beat baners / and royal cote armures
And by deuyse / Standards and penounse
And for the field / fresshe and gay getounse
And every craft / that may rekened be
To tell shortly / was in this cite
And thorughe this town / soryche and excellent
In the mids / a large river went
Causynge to them / full great co^modyte
The which on twain / has parted the cite
Ofcours full swyfte / with fresshe stremes clear
And hyghte xamtus / as Guydo does us lere
And as I read / that upon this flode
On each a side / many a mylle stood
Wha^ need was / their grain and corn to grynde
Them to sustain / in storye as I find
This river eke / of fysshe full plenteous
Divided was / by werkmen curyous
So craftily / thorugh casting sovereign
That in his course / the stremes might attain
For to areche / as Guydo does comecte
By Archys strong / his course for to reflecte
Thorugh condyte / pypes large and wide withal
By certain means / artyficiall
That it made / a full purgacion
Of all ordure / and fylthes in the town
Washing the streets / as they stood arowe
And the gutters / in the earth low
That in the cite / was no fylthe seen
For the canell / scoured was so clean
And deuoyded / in so secret wise
That no man might espy / nor deuyse
By what engyne / the sylthes fer nor nere
Were borne away / by course of the ryuere
So covertly every thing was covered
Whereby the town / was utterly assured
From engendrynge / of all corrupcion
From wicked air / and from infexion
That cause often / by their vyolence
Mortalyte / and great pestylence
And by example / of this flode there was
Made cybre at Rome / and wrought by Eneas
The which also / departs Rome a two
Mine Auctour says / I note if it be so
And to enhabyte / this royal chief cite
King Pryam / has about in the country
Made for to search / with all his hole intent
And in prouynces / that were adjacent
In borowes towns / and in small vyllages
Ygadred out / of all manner ages
And of thropes / folks full diverse
And such as were / vacaunt and dyspers
About Troy / in any regiowne
He made has / to enter into town
Great multitude / what of young and old
It to enhabyte / as ye have herd me told
And them that were before / to him foreynes
He has in Troy / made Cyteseynes
Full discretly / like as it is found
And when they began / with people to abound.
King Pryamus / of hye affecciowne
After the building / of this mighty town
Has in his heart / caught a fantasye
His new cite / for to magnefye
And it to put / the more in remembrance
He cast fully to do / some obseruaunce
To mighty Mars / stern and ferse of hew
And specially / with certain plays new
On horse and foot / in many sundry wise
To give his men / in knyghthode excersyse
Eueryche to put / other at assay
In iustes boordes / and also in tournay
To preue their force / when they hap mete
The which plays were founded / first in Crete
And in that land / of hye and low estate
In martys honor / they were dedycate
And in paleste / on wakes on the night
Were other plays / men to assaye their might
Oonly on foot / with many sotyll point
And some of them were / naked and enioynt
To win a pryse / they did their full intent
And there was found / by clerks full prudent
Of the chesse / the play most glorious
Which is so sotyll / and so meruaylous
That it were hard / the matter to discryue
For though / a man studied all his live
He shall aye find / diverse fantasyes
Of wards making / and new Iupartyes
There is there in / so great dyuersyte
And it was first / found in this cite
During the sege / like as says Guydo
But Iacobus / de vitriaco
Is coutrarye / of oppynyon
For like as he / makes mencyon
And affermeth / fully in his advise
How Philometer / a philosopher wise
Unto a king / to stynte his crueltee
Fond first this play / and made it in Caldee
And into Greece / from thens it was sent
Also in Troy / by great auysement
The play was found / first of dyce and tables
And of casting / the chances deceyuables
That have be cause often / of great debate
For if that one / be now found fortunate
To win a while / by favor of his chance
Or he be ware / with sudden varyaunce
Unhappily / he is put a back
And a another / that stood upon the wrack
And of loss / was plonged in distress
They raised have / unto the hye richesse
Gladness of one / is to a another rage
A deuaunt / hasarde and passage
If one have joy / another suffers woe
Like as the bones / run to and fro
An hundred sithe / in a day they varye
Now blandysshynge / and now they be contrary
No man with them / assured is in joy
And first also / I read that in Troy
Were song and red / many fresshe comedyes
And other dytees / that called be tragedyes
And to declare / shortly in sentence
Of both two / the fynall difference.
A Comedye has / in his gynnynge
A pryme face / a manner complaining
And afterward / ends in gladness
And it the deeds / oonly does express
Of such as be / in pouerte plonged low
But Tragedye / who so list to know
It begins / in prosperyte
And ends ever / in aduersyte
And it also does / the conqueste treat
Of rich kings / and of lords great
Of mighty men / and old conqueroures
Which by fraud / of fortunes shoures
Be over cast / and whelmed from their glory
And whylom thus / was hallowed y^ memory
Of tragedyes / as books make mind
When they were red / and song as I find
In the theater / there was a small auter
Amyddes set / that was half Circuler
Which into Est / of custom was direct
Upon the which / a pulpet was erecte
And therein stood / an ancient poet
For to rehearse / by rethorykes sweet
The noble deeds / that were hystoryall
Of kings princes / for a memoryall
And of these old / worthy Emperors
The great empryse eke / of conquerours
And how they gate / in Martes hye honor
The lawrer grene / for fine of their labor
The palm of knighthod / disserued by old date
Or Parchas / made them pass into fate.
And after that / with chere and face pale
With style enclyned / began to turn his tale
And for to sing / after all their loos
Full mortally / the stroke of Antropos
And tell also / for all their worthy head
The sudden brekynge / of their lives threde
How pytously / they made their mortal end
Through false fortune / yt all y^ world will shende
And how the fine / of all their worthynesse
Endede in sorrow / and in hye trystesse
By compassynge / of fraud or false treason
By sudden murdre / or vengeance of poison
Or conspyrynge / of fretynge false envy
How unwarily / that they did dye
And how their renown / and their hye fame
Was of hatrede / suddenly made lame
And how their honor / drough unto declyne
And the myschefe / of their unhappy fine
And how fortune / was to them vnswete
All this was told / and red of the poet
And while that he / in the pulpet stood
With dedely face / all deuoyde of blood
Singing his dytees / with muses all to rent
Amyd the theater / shrouded in a tent
There came out men / gastfull of their cheres
Diffygured / their faces with vyseres
Playeng by signs / in the peoples sight
That the poet song / has on heyght
So that there was / no manner discordaunce
At wene his dytees / and their countenauce.
For like as he / a lofte did express
Words of joy / or of heaviness
Menynge and there / benethe of them playeng
From point to point / was always answeryng
Now triste now glade / now heavy and now light
And face changed / with a sudden sight
So craftily / they could them transfygure
Conformynge them / to the chance plure
Now to sing / and suddenly to weep
So well they could / their obseruaunces keep
And this was done / in Apryll and in May
When blosmes / new / both on busshe and hay
And flowers fresshe / gynne for to spring
And the birds / in the wood sing
With lust supprysed / of the somer son
When these plays / in Troy were begone
And in the theater / hallowed and yholde
And thus the ryte / of tragedyes old
Pryamus / the worthy king began.
Of this matter / no more tell I can.
But I will forth / this storye write
And on my matter / boystously endyte
How Pryamus / was passing dylygent
Right desirous / and in wardly fervent
If he might / among his works all
To bylde a paleys / and a rich halle
Which should be his / chose chief dungyon
His royal see / and sovereign mansyon
And when he began / to his work approach
He made it bylde / hye upon a roche
It for to assure / in his foundation
And called it / the noble Ylion
The sight of which / justly circuler
By compase cast round / as any sper
And who that would / the content of ye ground
Truly acounte / of this place round
In the theater / first he must enter
Taking ye line / yt kerueth thorugh the center
By gemetrye / as longs to that art
And trebled it / with the seuenthe part
He find might / by experyence
The measure hole / of the circumference
What land also / plainly eke with all
Contained was / within the strong wall
The creste of which / where lowest was
Had in heyghte / full six hundred pas
Bylded of marbyll / full royal and full strong
And many other / rich stone among
Whose toures were / raised up so hye
That they raughte / almost to the lkye
The work of which no man might amend
And who that list / by greces up assende
He might se / in his inspeccyon
To the bounds / of many regyon
And prouynces that stood round about
And the walls / within and without
Endlonge with knottes graven clean
Depeynt with asure / gold / cynopre and grene
That verily / when the son shone
Upon the gold / meynt among the stone
They gave a light / withouten any were
As Phoebus does / in his mydday spear
The work of wyndowe / and eke fenestrall
Wrought of beryle / and of clear crystal.
And amyddes / of this Ylyon
So fresshe / so rich / of foundacyon
Which clerks yet / in their books praise
King Pryam / made an halle for to raise
Excellynge all / in beauty and in strength
The latytude according / with the length
And of marbyll / outward was the wall
And the tymbre most / noble in specialle
Was half of cedre / as I rehearse can
And the remenaunt / of the rich Eban
Which most is able / as I dare specefye
With stone to join / by craft of carpentrye
For they of timber / have the soueraynte
And for to tell / of this Eban tree
Like in books / sothely as I find
It comes out / of Ethyope and ynde
Black as is geete / and it will wexe anon
When it is korue / hard as any stone
And evermore last / and endure
And not corrupt / with water nor moisture
And of this halle / further to diffyne
With stones / square / by level and by line
It paued was / with great dilygence
Of masonrye / and passing excellence
And all above / raised was a see
Full curyously / of stones and perre
That called was / as chief and pryncipall
Of the reygne the sete most royal
To fore which was / set by great delight
A board of Eban / and of yuery white
So egally yioyned / and so clean
That in the work there was no ryfte seen
And sessyouns were made / on every side
Oonly the estates / by order to deuyde
Eke in the halle / as it was couenable
On each party / was a dormaunt table
Of yuery eke / and this Eban tree
And even again / this kings royal se
In the party / that was thereto contrayre
I raised was / by many crafty stayre
Hye in the halle / in the other syte
Right as line / in the opposyte
Of pured metal / and of stones clear
In bread and length / a full rich autere
On which there stood / of figure and vysage
Of massy fe gold / a wonderful image
To be honored / in that hye sete
Oonly in honor / of Iubyter the great.
And the statute / for all his huge heyghte
Fyftene cubytes / complet was of heyghte
A crown of gold / hye upon his heed
With heavenly sapphires / and many ruby read
Fret enuyron / with other stones ynde
And among / were meddled as I find
White perles massyfe / large and round
And for most chief / all dirkenesse to confound
Was a Carbuncle / king of stones all
To recomforte / and glade all the halle
And it to enlumyne / in the black night
With the fresshenesse / of his rody light
The value was thereof / inestymable
And the richesse / plainly in comparable
For this image / by dyuysion
Was of shap / and proporcion
From heed to foot / so maysterly entayled
That in apoynt / y^ workman has not failed
It to parfourme / by crafty excellence
Whom Pryamus / with dread and reverence
Honored has / above the gods all
In all myschefe / to him to clepe and call
For in him was / his hole affeccion
His soueraygne trust / and devotion
His hope also / and his affyaunce
His health his joy / and his assurance
And his welfare / and prosperyte
He has committed / to his deyte
Wenynge in heart / wonder sykerly
To be assured / from all myschefe thereby
And diffended / in each aduersyte
And hold his reygne / in hye felycyte
And in honor contynuelly / to shine
While Iubyter / thorugh his power dyuyne
Him and his / has in proteccion
This was his trust / and full opinion
And thus this work / finally achyeued
Whereof Pryam / with joy full releued
That he his cite / and noble ylyon
Has fully brought / unto perfeccyon
Like his intent / when that he began
And thus Pryam this kyge / this worthy man
Full many a day / in this new Troy
With his lyeges / lad his life in joy
Where I him leave / in his royal sete
Soueraygnely reygnynge / in quyete
Procedynge forth / if ye list to here
Unto the effect / anon of my matere
How king Pryamus sent Anthenor i^to Greece for to have his suster Exyone
again. Ca. xij.
O Hateful harm / which most is for to dred
Kyndled solonge / osparke of old hatred
Root of debate / ground of envy and ^re
With new flawme / hertes for to fire
O grain of malys / causer of all offense
O francour rusted / of impacience
Which have of new made / festred sores sinerte
When thou art ones / raked in an heart
Which for disdain / of mercy may not let
A man no while / to live in equity
But deluest up / malys many fold
Debates new / that buried were of old
And falsely quykest / stryues to restore
That enuyous serpent / y^ was slain of yore
Which felly has / this addre enuyous
Out of his rest / awaked Pryamus
And with his venym / so persynge and so ylle
Made him weary / to live in tranquylle
And meued him / of his iniquyte
Upon Greeks / avenged for to be
For where as he / in peace held his reygne
With his lyeges / in joy souereygne
Without anoye / or any perturbaunce
This serpent has / with new remembrance
Without advise / or discrete areste
So hoote a flawme / kyndled in his breast
Of old envy / with fresshe rancour meynte
That lykly is never / to be queynte
For Pryam now in his entenciowne
Cast and compasses / reuoluynge up and down
How strong he was / of richesse and meyne
How noble and mighty / was also his cite
And habundaunt / shortly to conclude
Both of plente / and of multitude
Of men of arms / and of chyualrye
Which stered him / to have fantasye
Alas the while / to his unhappy chance
That to be deed / he take will vengeance
Upon his foon / the fire of hoote envy
So brent him in ward / by malencolye
Stondynge in purpose / yt no man change may
Of his damages / avenged be some day
And of miuryes / yt they on him have wrought
And when that he / had a time sought
To his purpose / most conuenyent
Anon he has / for all his lords sent
And his knights called euerychone
To come in haste / excused was not one
Namely of them / that were of hye degree
And they obeyeng / with all humylyte
His bidding holy / and made no delay
To come echeone / again a certain day
And his sons / were also present
Ector except / that was that time absent
In the strong and mighty regyon
Of Panomye / which in subieccyon
King Pryam held / thorugh his worthynesse
And to amend things / and redress
Ector was gone / into this Panomye
Certain causes / for to Iustefye
As in his reason / he thought for the best
To set them / in quyete and in rest
For he was aye so just / and so prudent
So well aduysed / and so pacyent
And so demened / in his governance
That him was loathe / for to do vengeance
Where as he might / in easy wise treat
For to reform / things small and great
For loathe he was / this noble worthy knight
For any haste / to execute right
Or causeles by rygour / to condemn
And in this while / full worthy and solemn
King Pryamus / of lords great and small
Within Troy / held a court royal
As he that list / for no cost to spare
And ceryously / his menynge to declare
He in his see / his lords enuyron
Began thus to show / his hertes mocyon.
O worthy lords / that be now here present
Faithful and true / of heart and of intent
It is not unknown / to your discrecyon
The great damages / and oppressyon
Which that Greeks / have upon us wrought
Without cause / for a thing of naught
This other day / as who says but late
That as I trow / so new is yet the date
That it was fresshe / remembered / in your mind
Unto your blood / if that ye be kind
For I suppose / no foryetylnesse
May put away the mortal heaviness
Of harms old / which aye renew again
In my memory / I say you in certain
And as I trow / plainly in your thought
That ever is grene / and ne dies naught
How they have slain / our progenytours
That whylom were / so noble werreours
Our Cite burnt / and brought unto ruin
And robbed it / falsely by rauyne
And turned all / into wilderness
And into Greece / carried our richesse
My fader slain / that hyghte lamedon
Without cause / or occasyon
And raught from him / his gold and his tresour
Which me seems / is a foul error
We might of right amends well challenge
And desire us / justly to revenge
Before the gods / of so hye offense
Oonly of reason / and of conscience
And passing all / their mortal cruelte
There is one thing / that most greueth me
That they ungoodly / against gentyllesse
No reward having / to the worthynesse
To the birth / ne the royal blood
Of her that is so fair / and eke so good
I mean my suster / called Exyon
Whom they alas to their confusyon
Difuse / and keep not like her degree
From day to day / in dishoneste
Where thorugh her honor / and her name lorne
Considering / not of what stok she was borne
For they are blind / for to take heed
Or to aduerte / the root of her kynrede
Of surquyde / they be so indu rate
And sithe that she of so hye estate
Ytreted^ is / like as ye may se
I suppose / other that be of low degree
Eouerned be / full dishonestly
For ye may think / and demetruely
How wives maidens / in that company
With other eke / that be of your allye
Ynaunted be / and used at their lust
On the greeks / I have no better trust
For they ne spare / another blood nor age
And thus they live in / turment and seruage
Without touthe mercy / or pity
The which touches you / as well as me
And as me seems / of equity and right
Ye ought echone / with all your full might
Of the wrongs / with which ye be offended
To seek away / it might be amended
And that we work / all by one assent
And proceed / like to our intent
Of their malys / and cursed cruelte
All at ones / avenged for to be
And that we be / in heart will and thought
Of one accord / and ne vary naught
For than our force / is dowbled and pouste
For right and reason / and good equity
Require vengeance / on him y^ does y^ wrong
Though it so be / that it abide long
I trust also / on the gods rightwysenesse
That they shall help / our harms to redress
And favor us / in our innocence
To chastyse them / that wrought this offense.
Also ye know / how that our cite
Is strong and mighty / and of great suerte
With toures hye / and walled for the werre
That also fer / as shyneth son or sterre
There is none like / for to reken all
That may in force / be thereto perygall
Ye know also / as it shall be found
With chyualrye / how that we habounde
Expert in arms / and of old assayed
That for dread / never were dismayed
And we have plente also / of vytayle
Of frendshyp eke / that ne will us not fail
With all their might / to do to us socour
Wherefore I read / without more soiour
To set upon them / sithe we be able
And time is now / me seems couenable
For manhood bid / make no delay
To venge a wrong / hap what that may
For in differynge / is often great damage
To work in time / is double advantage
For to our purpose / lacks never adele
And thorugh our manhod / we be assured well
But list we be / not hold to hasty
Or to rakell / to work wylfully
And werre / also stand in adventure
For aye of mart / doutous is the eure
I read first / to greeks that we send
To wit if they / our harms will amend
Without strife werre / or more debate
Than may we said / that we be fortunate
And if they be / contrary to reason
To condyscende / to this conclusion
To grant our asking / of equity and right
Than have we cause / for to preue our might
But are that we proceed / by rygour
We shall to them / offer all measour
As fer as right / and reason eke requere
And of disdain / if them list not here
Than our quarrel / deuoyde of wylfulnesse
Yrooted is / upon sykernesse
And if that we / of their great offense
Axe amends / first in pacyence
God and fortune / I hope will not assente
In the end / we shall us not repent
And it is better / by peace to have redress
Than gynne a werre / without auysenesse
Therefore / let us our woeful adventure
Pacyently suffer / and endure
And in our port / be but humble and plain
Upon answer / what that they will sayn^
For though so be / in mine entencion
Ymeued am / by just occasion
To proceed of ire / to vengeance
I will all put / out of remembrance
And let slide by / foryetfulnesse
The wrongs do / and void all heaviness
Toward greeks / and axe of them no more
But that they will / Exyona restore
To us again / which is to me most derre
Oonly to stynte / all debate and werre
For the surplus / of our mortal eure
We shall dissymule / and prudently endure
Our harms old / forth in pacyence
If ye accord / unto my sentence
Say here upon / as ye be auysed
For if this sonde / be of them despised
And that them list / to reason not obey
Than we may justly / seek a another weye
To have redress / for now there is no more
Save I purpose / to send Anthenore
Which is a man / discrete and auysee
And specially in matter of treat
For he is both wise / and eloquente
As ye well know / and passyngly prudente
And when the king / had told his tale anon
To his counsel / they consent euerychone
That Anthenor this Journey / undertake
And he in haste / began him ready make
Without abode / and will not deny
To take on him / this embassetrye
Well auysed / in his discrecion
Took or he went / informacion
From point to point / of this great charge
For he him cast / to stand at his large
Without error / as he that could his good
For he the effect / full plainly understood
For every thing / he prynted in his thought
Or that he went / and forgate right naught
For of a word / he cast him not to fail
To ship he gothe / and began to sail
And to short time / he and his company
Aryued be up / into Thesalye
At a cite / called Mynusyus
Where by fortune / was king Pelleus
The same time / and Anthenor anon
Unto the king / the right way is gone
Of whom he was / as Guydo has conceived
At pryme face / benyngnely received
But when he knew / the cause of his coming
He had in haste / without more taryenge
To Authenor / with a fell vysage
Shortly to say / the effect of his message.
THis Troya^ knight / astoned never adel
But full demure / and auysed well
Not to hasty / nor rakell for to said
But abiding / with look and face plain
To Pelleus / with a manly chere
Said in effect / right thus as ye shall here.
The worthy king / called Pryamus
So wise so noble / so manly and famous
And of knyghthod / passing excellent
Has first to you / in goodly wise sent
Out of Torye / his royal chief cite
His full intent / and message here by me
As I shall say to you / in words plain
If it so be / that ye not disdain
Pacyently / to give audyence
Remembrynge / first in your aduertence
Of the harms / not full long ago
And the wrongs / that ye wroughte also
Full cruelly / with other eke of youres
In Troy land / on his progenytoures
What Iniuryes / and destruction
Causeles / without occasion
Ye showed have / of very cruelte
And mercyles / destroyed his cite
Slain his fader / named lamedowne
And his cite brent / and beat down
And nouther left paleys / house nor toure
And ladde away / his richesse and treasoure
And nouther spared / as I rehearse can
In your slaughter / woman child nor man
There might none / from your sword asterte
And yet one thing / that most he has at heart
That his suster / called Exyon
Is hold and kept / of king Thelamon
Dishonestly / again all gentrye
To great dishonor / and great vyllanye
Of her kynred / like as ye may se
Treated nor cherysshed / like to her degree
Wherefore / sithe ye be so wise a knight
Ye ought aduerte / and to have a sight
To such things / of just affection
And consydre / in your discrecyon
Of gentyllesse / and of equity
How such wrongs / might amended be
Wherefore Pryam / of great auysenesse
As he that fully / with all his business
Of heart and will / desires peace and rest
Sends to you / besechynge for the best
That ye will / do your besy dylygence
To make to him / this little recompense
That he may have / restytucyon
Thorugh your knyghtly / medyaryon
Of his suster / without longer space
And the remenaunt he will let pace
Strife and werre / oonly to eschew
For he desires / fully for to sewe
Peace and quyete / of hole affection
And to pursue / measour and reason
And finally / like as ye may se
All occasyon of werre / for to fle
Consider this / that hold be so sage
For this the fine / fully of my message.
When Pelleus / him plainly understood
Of sudden ire / he wexe in heart wode
Of there and look / fell and furyous
And of rancour / right melancolyous
That he ne might / attempre nor appease
The hasty fire / that began his heart sease
For he anon / in full despytous wise
Began Pryamus threten / and despise
And of malys / set his sonde at naught
With all the means / yt Anthenor has sought
And began also / this Troyan knight menace
And bad in haste / he should void his place
Upon peril / that after fall might
And he anon went / out of his sight
And in all haste / he and his meynee
Without abode / taken have the sea
And began to sail / out of Thesalye
And in their way / so fast they them hye
That in short time / they aryued be
Up at Salempne / a mighty strong cite
Where by fortune in this royal town
This Anthenor / fond king Thelamowne
And to his paleys / he has the way nome
And first I find / when that he was come
He was accepted / unto his presence
Benynguely / without all offense
For Exyone was present / in that tide
Of adventure / stondynge by his side
And at reverence / of her woman head
Of Anthenor / he took the better head
All be of custom / that king Thelamon
Had hye despyte / and indignacyon
Of every Troyan / that he could espy
For specially / to them he had envy
Of rancour oonly / thorugh the bitter rag^
Which in his heart / might never aswage
But for all that / he in pacyence
To Anthenor / has given audyence
The which anon / in full sobre wise
His tale began / as I shall deuyse.
Sir quod he / with support of your grace
So ye me grant / opportune space
For to declare / the cause of my coming
I will rehearse / without more taryenge
My matter hole / breefly in sentence
To make it kouthe / to your magnyfycence
Signefyeng / without displeasaunce
That Pryamus / which has the governance
Of Troy town / has unto you sent
Of faithful menynge / and of clean intent
Besechynge first / to your goodlyhede
All other wrongs / forgete and eke deed
That ye oonly / of your hye noblesse
Of equity / and of gentylnesse
Ye will restore / Exyona again
Which that ye hold / to speak in words plain
In very sothe / not like to her estate
Wherefore he prays / to stynte all debate
And every harm / to put out of memory
Of knyghtly honor / for your own glory
To send her home / and make delyueraunce
Goodly of her / without varyaunce
Whom ye have hold / so many long days
Ne taryeth natnor / sets no delays
Ne let in you / be found now no slouthe
For sothfastlye / it is to great a routhe
To record / how ye have her used
It may of truth / not goodly be excused
That we shall let / lightly / over slide
So that ye benyngnely / provide
To send her home / like as I have said
Lo here the charge / that was on me laid
Without more abiding / in certain
What goodly answer / ye will send again.
When Thelamon / herkened had his tale
To hasty ire / he began to wexe pale
The fyry coke / has him made so wode
That from his face / aualed is the blood
Within his heart / began to frete and byte
With look askoye / and turned up the white
Of hye disdain / with face despytous
With pale smiling / and laughter furyous
Began rake out / the feeble mortal fire
Of fretynge hate / that brent in his desire
And shortly made / in conclusyon
To Anthenor / this obieccyon
And said friend what ever that thou be
I wonder greatly / and marvel is to me
What adventure / or sudden new thing
Vnprudently / meueth now thy king
Unto me / to make such a sonde
Thou were a fool / when thou took on hand
Oather unhappy / or infortunat
To me to bring / this embassat
For I with him / have no thing ado
Nor he with me / and look thou say him so
For we ne be / aqueynted / but alyte
Nor I no thing / platly me delight
It short words / if thou list to here
To do for him / nor at his prayere
For I ne have / joy nouther feste
To do right naught / sothly at his request
This wot I well / that but a while a go
I was at Troy / myself and other mo
For to reform a thing / that was amys
Thorugh your offense / shortly thus it is
For certain thing / wrought by lamedowne
And by our manhod / we won there ye town
And slew the king / and all yt with him held
In knyghtly wise / him metynge in the field
And for that I / as eueryche might se
Did enter first / into that Cite
It was to me granted / for memory
In sign oonly / of mine hye victory
Without any contradiccyon
By all the greeks / to have possessyon
Of her that is / to me most entere
Exyona / whom thou claymest here
But be well syker / thine asking is in vain
For trust well syker / and be right well certain
Thou getest her not / at one word if I may
For there shall first / be made full great affray
Or I her leave / during all my live
Who ever grutche / or there against strive
It were not sitting / me to leave her so
For whom I had / whylom so great ado
Or I her gat / with spending of my blood
And who that be wroth / therewith or wode
I will her keep / as it shall be found
For whom I had / so many mortal wound
At Troy town / or that I her wan
And in good faith / as ferforth as I can
She shall not lightly / fro my hands pace
For she alone / stands so in my grace
For her beauty / and her semelyhede
For her bounte / and her goodlyhede
That if I shall / my reason shortly fine
She is in sothe / the most femynyne
That ever I saw / and without dread
Of port and conning / and of womanhede
She has alone / in very existence
The souereynte / and the excellence
That Pryamus for ought / y^ thou can said
While that I live / get her not again
But he her bye / with many dedely wound
With sharp swerdes / and square speres ground
For there shall first / be raised such a strife
That it shall cost / many man's life
Or that she / again restored be
Take this forsothe / thou gettest no more of me
When him list / he may well begin
But I suppose / he shall but little win
None other wise / but as I the told
And wotest what / a great role I the hold
The to put / so far in Iupartye
To execute / this embassetrye
The manly greeks / so boldly to offend
Beware therefore / that he no more the send
Upon thy life / for rancour nor for pride
Now go thy way / for if that thou abide
Any longer / sothly in my sight
Thou wotest ye pryse / of yt I have the hight
Thou scapest not / who that be lefe or loathe
Than Anthenor anon / to ship he gothe
And to sail / him list not to delay
Toward an isle / that called is Achaye
And when that he / taken has the land
At his ryuayle / of adventure he fond
The worthy kings / Pollux and Castor
And right anon / this Troyan Anthenor
Without abode / to the court is fare
Unto them / his message to declare
And togydre / when they were present
Right thus / he said / as in sentement.
The noble king / of Troy the ryte
Has unto you / sent his will by me
Besechynge you / in full low manner
That ye list unto his prayer
Of equity / for to condescende
And goodly help / a certain wrong to mende
Touching his suster / called Exyon
That he may have / restytucyon
Of her again / by your discrete advise
For sithe ye be / so manly and so wise
It lykly is / in his oppynyon

That by your good / medyacyon
Shelyghtly may / again restored be
For to cherysshe peace / and unity
Wherefore he prays / with all his heart entere
In goodly wise / to do your deuere
That hold ben / so knyghtly and so sage
And he will plainly / all the surplusage
Of wrongs old / put in suspense
For he desires / of knyghtly hye prudence
To stynte werre / and to noryll he pes
For he is nouther rakell / nor rekles
But auysed / in his works all
To cast before / what that shall be fall
And things futur / aduertynge from a far
And sees what perell / that there is in werre
Will him conform / unto peace and rest
For he conceyueth / that it is the best
Every man / unity to sewe
And prudently / also to eschew
Of debates / each occacyon
Lo here the fine / of his entencyon
Which I committee / to your Judgment
And Castor than / of ire inpacyent
For hastynesse / ne might not abide
His cruel heart / so swolle was with pride
Brake out anon / with a despytous face
And said friend / I know of no trespace
That greeks did ever / unto thy king
To axe amends / it is a wonder t^ynge
Of us that never / did him no^^ offense
Save that we made / a manner recompense
Of a wrong / wrought by lamedon
The which first / sought occacyon
Against greeks / in ungoodly wise
That caused us / upon him to rise
All at ones / and manly on him set
Of due right / for to quyr^ our debt
Like his decrete / we have him plainly served
And nothy^g wrought / but as he has disserued
To are amends / he gynneth now to late
For we coueyte more / his mortal hate
His utter malys / and his enmyte
Than outher peace / accord or unity
As in effect hereafter he shall feel
If it hap / that he with us dele
The bargeyn shall full dear / ben abought
And we his frendshyp / sothly set at naught
And over more / I speak now to the
It lykly is / as seems unto me
That Pryamus / the loved but alyte
Not the value / I suppose of a myte
When he the sent / upon his message
And thou of folly / dydest great outrage
To take on the / so hye a peryllous thing
Unto greeks / to bring such tydynge
Where thorugh thy life / is put in iupartye
But I counsel / fast that thou the hye
Out of my sight / list that thou repent
And Anthenor / forth to ship went
And with the wind / began to sail anon
Toward an isle / called Pyllyon
And in all haste / when he did aryue
He shope him forth / to the court as blyue
Where duke Nestor / in all manner thing
His household held / royal as a king
And Anthenor full sad / and auysee
Tofore Nestor / sitting on his see
When that he was amytted / for to said
His tale he told / full openly and plain
From point to point / as ye herd before
It were but vain / to rehearse it more
For he always / concluded has in one
Like as ye herd / touching Exyone.
But duke Nestor / With face no thing read
But of hew / as any ashes deed
Fret with color / so inwardly was he
That his blood / from each extremyte
With drawn is down / unto his heart
Which for ire / so sore made him smerte
That he began quake / in every joint and vain
That he his hand uneath / may restrain
For melancolye / a venged for to be
Like a lion / so wood and wroth was he
Fer from himself / he was so alyenat
And inwardly / of rancour passyonat
With look reuersed / and furyous of sight
That tempre himself / uneaths he ne might
He felt of anger / so great aduersyte
And amyddes / all his cruelte
Of sudden haste / at ones he out brake
And even thus / to Anthenor he spoke.
O thou quod he / with all thy words white
As I suppose / that thou wyste full lyte
Unto fore whom / thou haste thy tale told
For I marvel / how thou art so bold
To presume / mine eres to offend
And for Pryam / so proudely to pretend
A manner title / in thy kings name
The worthy greeks / for to put in blame
And unjustly / of foul hardynesse
Requere of them / for to have redress
Of Iniuryes / wrought of ^amedon
Boldly affermynge / of false presumpcion
Upon greeks / wrongs outragyous
Which in myneres / be so odyous
So fretynge eke / so bytynge and sokene
For to list / that I may not sustene
In my herynge / lo hateful is the sown
That ner the honor / of my hyerenowne
Refrayned me / I should in cruel wise
Execute / full hastily Justice
Thorugh the rygour / of my mortal law
With bestes wild / first to do the draw
And thereupon / for thy feigned tale
Dismembre the / all on pieces small
In despyte / of Pryamus the king
To teache other / to bring more tydynge
Presumptuously / or any talys new
To any lord / but the better y^ him knew
This should be / for thy presumpcyon
Thy last mede / and fynall guerdon
Without mercy / like as I have behyght
And in all haste / bego out of my sight
For utterly / it does to great offense
Unto mine eye / to hauethe in presence
For thorugh disdain / it causes mine vnreste
Than Anthenor / thought for the best
It was not holsom / longer to abide
But cast wisely / for rancour or for pride
That it was best / for to bear him fair
And to his ship / he began anon repair
And in all haste / by possybylytee
Without abode / he taken has the sea
And began to sail / and homewarde fast draw
But suddenly boil / began the wawe
The sea to rise / and the clouds blake
For to appear / and the wind a wake
Wonder gastfull / also was the heuene
With dreadful fire / of the bright leuene
The thonder smote / the tempest began to drive
That the maste / began a soder ryue
Now alofre / now in point to drown
The fell weder / began so on them frown
That they awayte not / but upon death
Even at the point / of yeldynge up of the brethe
For they ne saw / none other remedy
And ever among / they began clepe and cry
To their gods / and auowes make
And devoutly / for to undertake
Each of them / like as he was of age
If they escape / to go on pilgrimage
Like the rytes / of their paynem wise
To the gods / to do their sacryfyse
So as they were / of substance and of might
And suddenly / the weder derke as night
With new light / by grace began adawe
The sea wax calm / and smothe began the wawe
So that of hap / among euerychone
For all the tempest / perysshed was not one
But tofore Troy / within a sytell space
They be aryued / euerychone by grace
Escaped safe / from every Ieopardye
Both Anthenor / and all his company
And to the temple / he took the right way
And in his prayer / there full long he lay
With many another / also for his sake
Tha^kyng their gods / yt made them so eskape
Every peril / and tempest of the sea
And after this / unto the king gothe he
That with his lords / about him full royal
In his paleys / and dongyon pryncypall
Sat and abode / full solempnelye
True report / of this embassatrye
And this knight / of all that has him fall
Has told the king / tofore his lords all.
THis Anthenor / has first made mention
Tofore the king / by just relacyon
Of his expleyt / by order by and by
And in what wise / and how vncurteysly
He was received / of king Pelleus
Of the thretes / and words despytous
That he suffered / of king Thelamon
Being as ferse / as a wood lion
And afterward / he began also complain
Of the despyte / of the brethren twain
Of his rebuke / and his great dread
And at Nestor / how he did speed
That with his life / he might uneath skape
All this he told / and began an end make
Of his journey / and eke of his repair
And than Pryam / was fully in despair
Outher by forte / or by adventure
Ever again / his suster to recure
For he conceyueth / in his aduertence
By clear report / of expert euydence
That aye the more / he was to them benygne
The more ungoodly / again him they malygne
And where he most him / shows debonayre
There he fond the^ / agaynward most co^trayre
So frowardly ever / they them quyte
Showing by signs / that they set lyte
By his frenshyp / for ought he could aduerte
Whereof he was pure sorym his heart
That he constrained / right of very need
Compelled was / justly to proceed
To have redress / oonly by rygour
For profre of peace / might have no favor
To be admytted / by title of ryghtwysenesse
Thorugh hye despyte / of hasty wylfulnesse
For every mean of measour / was in vain
Save oonly werre / engendered by disdain
Begone and caused / all of old hatrede
Which began anon / such a bronde to bread
Of new envy / in the kings breast
That Pryamus / without more areste
Is so july with Ire / and rancour fret
And with disdain / so sore ground and whet
That where so be / that he lose or win
Upon greeks / he will a werre begin
And Iuparte manly as a knight
His life his death / because he had right
And cast him first / a nauee for to send
Into greece / his fomen for to fend
And like a knight / his force for to haunte
In knyghtly wise / he cast him for to daunte
The pomp of greeks / and the sturdynesse
And finally their pride / to oppress.
But say Pryam / what infelycyte
What new trouble / what hap what destyne
Or from above / what hateful Influence
Descended is / by unware vyolence
To m^ue the / thou canste not live in pees
What sudden sort / what fortune gracelees
What chance unhappy / without auysenesse
What wylfull lust / what fonned hardynesse
Have put thy soul / out of tranquyllyte
To make the werye / of thy prosperyte
Why have y^ favor / in bitter more than sweet
That canste not live / in peace nor in quyete
Thou art trauayled / with wylfull mocyons
Over maystred / with thy passions
For lack of reason / and of hye prudence
Derked and blind / from all prouydence
And full barayne / to cast before and se
The harms following / of thine aduersyte
Thou were to slow / wisely to consydere
For want of sight / made to the slydere
Thorugh myste of error / falsely to forueye
By pathys wrong / from the right weye
To void reason / of wylfull hastynesse
Where was thy guide / where was thy maistresse
Descrecyon / so prudent and so ladde
A vyselye / that should the have ladde
From the traces / of sensualyte
Though it full selde / in man's power be
By suffraunce / himself to refrain
When sudden Ire / does his heart strain
Thou should before / better a cast thy chance
Wrought by counsel / and not put in balaunce
Thy sykernesse / alas why dydest thou so
And have symuled / some dele of thy woe
And cast thy change / well before the pryme
To have forgoten / wrongs of old time
And thought before / in thyn aduertence
That often falls / in experyence
That whiles men / do most business
Vengeably / their wrongs to redress
With double harm / or that they are ware
They fall again / in a new snare
And damages / that were forgete clean
By false report / of rumoure fresshe and grene
Renewed be / thorugh the swyfte fame
That flees so fer / to hyndre alordes name
Namely when they / to a purpose wend
Oonly of head / and se not the end
For of pride / and of sudden heete
They void themself / out of all quyete
Aduertynge not / to work auyselye
Nor the proverb / that techeth comonlye
He that stand sure / enhaste him not to meue
For if he do / it shall him after grieve
And he that walks surely / on the plain
If he stumble / it is but in vain
But if so be / helyste of his folly
Be neclygent / to put him wylfullye
In adventure / and of himself to reche
To eschew peril / I hold he be a wreche
For sothly Pryam / thou were to rechelees
For to committee / thy quyete and the pees
So dredefully during / by no date
To cruel fortune / or to fykell fate
Whose manner is / of custom commonly
That when a man / trusts most soueraynely
Of this goddess / blind and full unstable
Than she to him / is most deceyuable
Him to abate / from his royal stalle
And suddenly / to make him down to fall
And with a tryp / throw him on the bake
Who that gain stryueth / shall have little take
She is so slyely / with her gynne snare
That she can make a man / fro his welfare
With her pantre / that is with fraud englewed
When he lest weneth / for to be remewed
Therefore no man / have none affyaunce
In fortune / nor in her vary aunce
Ne let no wight / his ease more Iuparte
List thou the play / will afterward depart
To turn his chance / outher to well or woe
For selde in one / she does the game go
As ye may se / by example of Pryamus
That of folly / is so desirous
To work of head / and follow his own will
To trouble alas / the calm of his tranquylle
As in this book / here after shall be found
Him and his Cite / platly to confound
And utterly / to his confusyon
That afterward / by long succession
It shall be red / in storye and in fable
And remembered / with dytees delytable
To do pleasaunce / to them that shall it here
That by example / they may beware and lere
Of hasty lust / or of volunte
To begin a thing / wherein no suerte
Depends aye / as strife werre and debate
For in such play / unawarely comes chek mate
And harm I done / to late is to amend
Whose fine is often / other than they wend
In this storye / as ye shall after se
And let Pryam always your myrour be
Hasty error / by times to correct
For I anon / my poyntell will direct
After the manner / of his traces rude
Of this storye / the remenaunt to conclude.
THis worthy king / ever of one sentence
Aye more and more / fyred with feruence
Has his breuettes / and his letters sent
For his lords / to hold a parlemente
And them commanded / in all the have they may
To come anon / at their assygned day
From every ward / and party of the town
For to assemble / in noble Ilyowne
Chief of his reygne / and when they were echone
With him present / this noble king anon
Tofore them all / as shortly as he can
His will declares / and thus he began.
Syres quod he / because ye be wise
It needs not / long process to deuyse
For to rehearse / of your coming cause
But for to tell / shortly in a clause
What I mean / and make no delay
Ye wot how / I now this other day
Sent into Greece / by counsel of you all
A knight of mine / that Anthenor men call
To have recured / Exyona again
Whose message / was not but in vain
For of greeks / full vncurteysly
He was received / and dispytously
Threte and rebuked / in point to have be deed
Uneath he might / escape with his head
They put on him / such offense and blame
That reboundeth / to our aldershame
And day by day / it must increase more
But we ordain / some remedy therefore
For there as we / all mesour have them offered
They have to us / werre and strife yprof^ed
Of hye despyte / of rancour and of hete
And of malys / cruelly us threte
And where as we / would peace purchase
For wrongs / done they fellyvs manace
And for y^ harms / that they have us wrought
They not purpose / plainly in their thought
Other redress / nor amends make
But utterly with werre / us to awake
Whose joy is fully / increase of our greuaunce
So would god they were / with repentance
Contryte in heart / to stynte all myschefe
That lykly is to fall / and the grefe
On outher part / that it might over slide
But they alas / with rancour and with pride
Ar swolle of new / to threte more and more
But god diffende / half dele of the sore
By infortune / ever should fall
As they purpose / on any of us all
But sithe they have shape / thus for us
We must resyste / their will malycyous
Thorugh might of god / of necessyte
In our diffence / it will none other be
And best I hold / unto our intent
To work and do / all by one assent
So we our purpose / sonest shall acheue
Where is discord / there may no quarrel preue
For on that part / where hertes be not one
Victory may / in no wise gone
Chief of conquest / is peace and unity
Right as discord / is of aduersyte
Ouyde of hertes / makes rewmes sure
Dyuysyon / causes discomfyture
Wherefore I read / of o will and heart
Let us set on / to do the greeks smerte
For sothfastly / if ye list to se
I dare afferme / that we strenger be
Than the Greeks / upon every part
And have of arms / parfytely the art
And be a counted of knyghthod / crop and root
And plente have of men / on horse and foot
Arrayed well / eueryche in his degree
And therewith also / strong is our Cite
For to withstonde / our fomen euerychone
You counsaylynge / to ordain anon
First to assemble / holy your nauye
And stuff them strongly / with our Chyualrye
And into greece / hastily them send
The proud greeks / manly to offend
And of just cause / and by title of right
Oa them werre / with all our full might
Their towns brenne / and their feldes waste
With heart unfeigned / also us enhaste
To quyte them / as they deserved have
For my read / we shall none of them save
But cruelly take / on them vengeance
Ne has no fere / ne let be no greuaunce
Though they before / by fortune were victoures
To ^lee our auncetres / and progenytoures
For he that was of unhap / first put down
Remounteth often / to full hye renown
By the change / and the varyaunce
Of werre and strife / that ever is in balaunce
For he that is / this day assured well
Tomorowe he is / cast down of the whele
The victor often / put in adventure
And vanquysshed / by discomfyture
Of him that he had / before victory
Nor up now down / in arms stand y^ glory
In martes chance / no man him assure
But as it comes / let him take his eure
For gery Mars / by his influence
Can give a man / whylom excellence
To win a pryse / like a conqueroure
And suddenly / as a somer flower
He can his honor / make for to fade
For when that he / his aspectis glade
For a man / lysteth for to wrythe
His renown old / goth away as blythe
After a floode an ebb / follows aye
As men deserve / praise them for a day
For though Phoebus / this day merry shine
Tomorowe he may / his bemes down declyne
Thorugh the thycknesse / of the mystes trouble
Right so of Mars / are the chances double
Now up now down / now low now alofte
As fortune which that changes often
List on her whele / make a man assende
And unawarely / down again descend
Stoundemele his honor / to auaunce
And with asweygh / throw him to myschau^ce
Now with favor / set him up full hye
Est auale him / with twynclynge of an eye
Her play unstable / tourneth as a balle
While one gothe up / a another has a fall
She reyseth one / and does a another loute
For every man / when it comes about
Must take his turn / as her play requereth
Who is expert / and her frauds lereth
Shall with her sugre / find galle meynt
And her honey / aye with bitter spreynt
In peace and werre / in honor and fame
In dignytes / in renown and in shame
At hi^ liking / as her list to grant
Therefore no man / his hap to much auaunte.
For though greeks / whylom were alofte
It may hereafter / them hap full vnsofte
Wherefore echone / show your worthynesse
That so are named / of strength and hardynesse
And to fortune / plainly you comytte
And let no fer / your manly hertes f^ytte
But stand hole / and be in menynge plain
And thereupon / let se what ye will said
And atones / their voyse they began reyse
And his sentence / hyghly for to preyse
And of one heart / manly began express
They will dispende / goods and richesse
And their bodies / put in Iupardye
There was not one / that would it tho deny
And of this grant / he thanketh them echone
And gave them leave / where them list to gone
For he dissolved has / his parliament
And every man / on his way is went
And repaired / to his mansyowne
The king alone / left in Ylyowne
Sole by himself / inwardely musing
How his purpose / he might about bring
For he in soth / on no thing else thought
And thereupon / even thus he wrought.
BYng Pryamus / making thus his moan
As I you told / in a chamber alone
Many ways / casting up and down
For to parfourme / his conclusyowne
And to fulfill / the fine of his intent
He first of all / prudently has sent
For his sons / to come to him in haste
As well for them / that were borne in baste
As the the other / for to assemble yfere
For a purpose / like as ye shall here
To have a counsel / for needful purueaunce
Against greeks / to make ordenaunce
First by themself / alone pryuely
And when they were in order / by and by
Eueryche of them set / in his dew see
Like as they were / of age and of degree
And Ector first / flower of chyualrye
Repaired home / out of panomye
Most acceptable / in every wyghtes grace
Next his fader / taken has his place.
And when Pryam / his leyser did espy
With syghes sore / casting up his eye
To them echone / sitting enuyron
Began to declare / his hertes mocion.
But first or he might / his will expowne
Into teres / he began himself drown
His hertely woe was / so outragyous
That for weeping / and sobbing furyous
Uneath he might / with any word out break
Nor unto them / for distress speak
Nor openly / his inward menynge show
Till at the last / he in words few
Began to abrade / in all his pytous fare
Even thus / his menynge to declare.
My dear sons / so loving and so kind
As I suppose / that ye have in mind
And remember discretly / and aduerte
And emprente full fresshely / in your heart
How the greeks / again all right and law
With cruel sword / murdered have and slawe
Our worthy auncetres / of full hye renown
And destroyed / brent and beat down
The first Troy / with his walls old
And how ungoodly / also that they hold
Mine own suster / called Exyon
To full great shame / and confusyon
And hye reprefe / to your worthynesse
That me seems / of very kyndenesse
And of nature / ye ought be agreued
And inwardly / in heart sore meued
To suffer her / in hyndrynge of her name
So to be treated / for your alder shame
Alas why nyl / ye do your business
This hye despyte / knyghtly to redress
You for to avenge / upon their cruelte
Recure to find / of her iniquyte
Sith that ye be / so mighty and so strong
Certes me seems / ye bide all to long
Fro day to day / that ye so differ
In knyghtly wise / to gynne on them a werre
Your force and might / manly to assaye
I am pure sorye / that ye list delay
You to comfort / unto my desire
That in their hate / brenne as hot as fire
Upon them / like as ye may se
Of fretynge ire / avenged for to be
Like their decrete / to quyte them their mede
And ye alas / take list no head
While your renown / does so fresshely shine
Unto my lust / your hertes to declyne
Considering like / as it is kouthe
How I have / for your grene youth
Yfostred you and brought / you forth echone
Frothylke day / that ye could gone
As tenderly / as I could or might
To which thing / in your inward sight
Ye should aduerte / always new and new
And of nature / on my sores rewe
To remedy / mine aduersyte
Which touches you / also well as me
Sith that ye wot / how sore it does me grieve
Ye should shape / mine harms to releue
And suddenly / as he thus ganmourne
Toward Ector / he began his face turn
And said Ector / my trust and all my joy
Mine heir also / like to reygne in Troy
After my day / and be my successoure
And named art / the very sovereign flower
Of worthynesse / and of manhod well
And all thy brethren / in knyghthod do excelle
And in arms / like a conqueror
Called the stock / of worship and honor
I hertely pray / though thou sytte stylle
Be willing now / my purpose to fulfylle
To execute / that I desire so
For finally / in the and in nomo
Is full my faith / to bring this about
Now take on the / and be no thing in doubt
To be chief prince / and also governor
Of this purpose / and utterly socour
Into thyn hand / this Journey I committee
Holy of heart / so that thou ne flytte
The to confourme / by good aduysement
To parfourme up / the fine of mine intent
For of reason / best to the it sit
Which art so prudent / and so full of wit
Strong and deliver / flouryng eke in youth
Of whom the fame / thorugh y^ world is kouthe
Young of years / old of discreciowne
Eurous to love / passing of renown
Unto whose will / thy brethren shall obey
And sto^de with the / both to live and deye
Now co^descende / to accomphysshe my request
And what thou felest / answer at the least.
And wha^ y^ king / has showed his sentence
Demure of chere / humble of reverence
This worthy Ector example of gentrye
With soft speech / as techeth cuttesye
His answer gave / with sobre countenance
The effect of which / was this in substance.
Mine own lord / and my fader dear
Benyngnely / if ye list to here
After the force / and the great might
And the some / of natures right
Which every thing / by kind does constrayne
In the bonds / of her large chain
It sitting is / as the does enspyre
And according / that every man desire
Of wrongs done / to have amendment
And to her law / right conuenyent
Namely to such / that with nobylte
Kind has endewed / and set in hye degree
For to such / great reprefe is and shame
When any wrong / be do unto their name
For echetrespasse / must considered be
Justly mesured / after the qualyte
Of him that is offended / and also
After the parsone / by whom y^ wrong is do
Be it in werre / in contek or debate
For gretter grefe / is to hye estate
To suffer and harm / of case or adventure
Or any wrong / unjustly to endure
Or Iniuryes / compassed of malys
Is more offense / by discrete advise
To whom that be famous / in manhood
Reno^med and borne / of gentle blood
Than to such one / that hold is but a wretch
Wherefore we must / greatly charge and retche
Oonly of knyghthode / our worship for to eke
Of wrongs done / amends for to seek
Our state considered / and our hye noblesse
And in what plyte / we stoude of worthynesse
When that bestes / of reason rude and blind
Desire the same / by instuyt of kind.
And for my part / trust in certain
Ye have no sone / that would half so feign
Upon greeks / avenged be as I
For here my truth / I say you faithfully
For ire of them / I brenne as does the glede
I thirst their blood / more than other mede
For right as I eldest / am of age
Among your sons / so am I most with rage
I fret within / justly of knyghthode
With my right hand / to shede y^ greeks blood
As they shall find / paraunter or they wene
When time comes / the sothe shall be seen.
But first I read / wisely in your mind
To cast before / and leave not behind
Or ye begin / discretely to aduerte
And prudently / consydre in your heart
All oonly not the gynnynge / but the end
And the mids / what way they will wend
And to what fine fortune / will them led
If ye thus do / amysse ye may not speed
For that counsel / in mine opinion
Is worthy little / by discrecyon
To have a pryse / that cast not by and by
The course of things / by order ceryously
What way they trace / to woe or to delight
For though a gynnynge / have his appetyte
Yet in the end / plainly this no fable
There may thy^g follow / which is not co^me^dable
For what is worth / agynnynge fortunate.
What causes after / strife and great debate
Wherefore in sothe / pryncyples are to dread
But men well know / what fine shall succeed
For a gynnynge with grace / is well fortuned
When end and mids / a like be contuned
But when that it in well / ne may contene
It is well better / betymes to abstene
Than put in doubt / that stands insuerte
For who so does / has aduersyte
But humbly / to your estate royal
Of heart I pray / let not offend at all
That I am bold / to say my mocion
For in good faith / of none entencion
I no thing meue you / to do offense
But oonly this / that your magnyfycence
Proceed not / of head wylfully
Ne that no spyryte / you meue folylye
To begin thing / that after will you shende
For lack / that ye se not to the end
Nor take heed / in your aduertence
To consydre / by good prouydence
How greeks / have in their subieccion
Europe and Aufryk / with many region
Full large and wide / of knyghthod most famous
And of richesse / wonder plenteuous
Right reno^med / also of worthynesse
With your supporte / that I dare well express
Full peryllous / is to displese them or disturb
For if that we / our quyete now parturbe
Which stands in peace / greatly is to dread
For though all Asye / help us in our need
If it be looked / on every part aryght
They be not egall / unto greeks might.
And though also / mine Aunte Exyon
Again all right / be hold of Thelamon
It is not good / for her redemption
To put us all / to destruction
I read not to beye her / half so dear
For many of us / in hap that sytte here
And other mo / might for her sake
Death vnder^onge / and an end make
Which were no wisdom / like as seems me
And it may hap / also how that she
In short time / her fatal course shall fine
When Antropos / the threde a two shall twyne
What had we won than / and she were go
But enmyte / thought sorrow and woe
Slaughter of our men / death and confusion
Wherefore I read / without dissymylacion
Without more / that we our woe endure
And not to put / our self in adventure
This hold I best / and work as the wise
But douteles / for no cowardyse
I say not this / in your hye presence
But forcause / I hold it no prudence
To fortune / full of doubylnesse
Sith we be sure / to put our sykernesse
Thus all and some / the effect of my will
And with that word / Ector held him stylle.
ANd when y^ Ector / by full hye prudence
Concluded has / y^ fine of his sentence
Full demurely / he kept his lyppes close
And therwithall / Paris / up arose
And began his tale / thus before the king
My lord quod he / so it be liking
To your highness / for to take heed
As me seems / we should little dread
In knyghtly wise / for to undertake
Upon Greeks / a werre / for to make
All atones / their pride to confound
Sith that we / passyngly habounde
Of chyua^rye / here within our town
And have plente / and possessiowne
Of each thing / that may to werre avail
Stuff in our self / and royal apparayle
Of all that longs / to assautes marcyall
And with all this / more in specyal
Help and socoure / of many regyon
With vsto work / to their destruccyon
The pomp and pride / manly to abate
And of Greeks / the malys for to mate
For all that they of heart / be so stout
Me seems shortly / that we need not doubt
Nor on no part / for to be dismayde
Wherefore I read / let not be delayde
Our ships / first ready for to make
And I myself / will fully undertake
So it to you be liking / and pleasaunce
Of this empryse / holy the governance
And you assure / and put in certain
Exyona / to recure again
And in what form / that it shall be wrought
I have away found / in my thought
That lykely is here / after to be done
Which unto you / I will declare anon
First I have cast / with strong and mighty hand
For to rauysshe / some lady of that land
Of hye estate / and make no taryenge
And myghtely / into Troy her bring
Maugce her might / for this conclusion
That ye may have / testytucion
By eschaunge of her / that ye desire so
And thereupon / shall not be long a do
I you behete / for all the greeks strong
And for that / I shall not you prolonge
I will you said / excludynge every doubt
How this advise / shall be brought about
First how that I shall / this purpose fine
The gods have thorugh / their power dyuy^e
Showed to me / by reuelacion
For thereupon / I had auysion
But late a gone / as I lay a sleep
Unto which / if ye take keep
Ye may not fail / nor be in no despair
To have recure / of her that is so fair
For whom ye have / now so much care
And the manner hole / I will declare
Of this dreme / to your magnyfycence
If it so be / ye give will credence
To my tale / for I shall not dwell
Ceryously in order / for to tell
The truth plain / and no fable feign
To you that be / my lord most sovereign.
First if that ye / remember in your mind
This other day / when I was last in ynde
By your advise / and commandment
For a matter / which in yourentent
Was specially / had in cherte
As it is known / between you and me
Of which I took / upon me the charge
In the bonds / of that land full large.
The same time / your desire to speed
When that Tytan / with his bemes read
From Gemyny / drove his chare of gold
Toward the crabbe / for to take his hold
Which named is the paleys of dyane
The bente moon / that wex can and wane
When hallowed is / the sons stacyon
Nygh the mids / of the month of Iuyn
At which season / erely on a morrow
When that Phoebus / to void nyghtes sorrow
Does Pirrous / his wayne again up draw
And Aurora / Estwarde does adawe
And with the water / of her teres round
The silver dew / causes to habounde
Upon herbs / and on flowers soote
For kyndely norysshynge / both of crop and root.
Up I rose / out of my bed anon
Full desirous / on hunting for to gone
Prycked in heart / with lusty fresshe pleasaunce
To do to love / some dew obseruaunce
And lucyna / that day to magnefye
Which called is / lady of venerye
And dewely / our rytes to observe
Cythera / and her for to serve
I and my feres / our hertes to releue
Cast us fully / till it drew to eve
In the forest / to play us and disporte
And pleasauntly / us to recomforte
As it longs to love / of lustynesse
For thylke day / to venus the goddess
I sacred was / by full great excellence
With great honor / and dew reverence
Do unto her / both of one and all
And on a friday / this adventure is fall
When we began have us / to the wodes grene
In hope that day / some game for to seen
With great labor / riding to and fro
Till we had / full many bucke and do
By strength slain / as we might them find
The heart I chaced / with hounds and the hynde
Thorugh the downs / and the dales low
Till Phoebus / of his days bow
Amyd the arc / was of meridyen
When his bemes / full hot were and shene
And we most besy / were upon the chaas
That me befell / a wonder diverse caas
For of fortune / it happed suddenly
While I was severed / fro my company
Sole by my self / among the holtes hoar
To find game / desirous evermore
Or I was ware / through thycke and through thyn
A full great heart / I saw before meryn
Down by the land / and the vales grene
That I in sothe / might not sustene
He was so swyfte / for to nygh him nere
Albe that / I prycked my coursere
Nyghe to y^ death / thorugh many sundry shawe
Out of my sight / so fer he began withdraw
For all that ever / that I sewe might
That I anon / lost of him the sight
In a wood / that yda bare the name
And I so faint / began wexe of that game
And mine horse / on which I did ride
Fomynge full white / upon every side
And his flanks / all with blood distayned
In my pursuit / so sore he was constrained
With my spores sharp / and dyed read
After the heart / so prycked I my stead
Now up now down / with a full besy thought
But my labor / auayled me right naught
Till at the last / among the bows glade
Of adventure / I caughte a plesaunt shade
Full smothe and plain / and lusty for to seen
And soft as velvet / was the young grene
Where fro my horse / I did a light as fast
And on a bow / I his reyne cast
So faynte and mate / of werynesse I was
That I me laid down / upon the gras
Upon a brynke / shortly for to tell
Beside aryuer / and a cristalle well
And the water / as Ireherse can
Like quycke silver / in his stremes ran
Of which the gravel / and the bright stone
As any gold / again the son shone.
Where right anon / for very werynesse
A sondayne sleep / began me so oppress
That fro time / that I first was borne
I never was asleped / so toforne
And as I lay / I had a wonder sweuen
For me thought / hye down fro heaven
The wynged god / wonderful of chere
Mercuryous / to me did appear
Of whom I was / somedele first aferde
For he was gyrde / with his crooked sword
And with him brought / also in his hand
His slepy yerde / plyaunt as a wonde
With a serpent / going enuyrowne
And at his feet / also low down
Me seems also / that there stood a cock
Singing his hours / true as any clock
And to the mouth of this / god Mercurye
Were pypes set / that long wonder merye
Of which the sweet / sugared armonye
Made in mine eres such / a melodye
That me seemed tho / in mine advise
I was rauysshed / into paradyse
And thus this god / diverse of lyknesse
More wonderful / than I can express
Showed himself / in his appearance
Like as he is discryued / in fulgence
In the book / of his methologyes
Where be rehearsed / many poesyes
And many lyknesse / like as ye may se
And for to take / the moralyte
His long yerde / right as is a line
Which on no side / wrongly may declyne
Signefyeth / the prudent governance
Of discrete folk / y^ thorugh their purueyaunce
Cast a peril / or that it be fall
And his pypes loud / as any shall
That thorugh musyke / be entuned true
Betokens eke / with many lusty hew
The sugared dytees / by great excellence
Of rethoryke / and of eloquence
Of which this god / is soueraygne and patrowne
And of this cock / the sweet lusty sown
That justly keeps / the hours of the night
Is utterly the advise / of in ward sight
Of such as void / by waker dylygence
Out of their court / slouthe and neclygence
And his sword / which croketh so again
That is not forged / nor ymade in vain
Is to revoke / to the right weye
Such as wrongly / for truth do forueye
And the serpent / which that I of told
Which wryncled is / as ye may behold
Upon the yerde / and about gothe
Signefyeth that falshode / wode and wroth
Lies in awayte / by many sleyghty weye
With his gynnes / truth to werreye
And this god of eloquence / king
Brought with him / eke in his coming
Cythera / whom lovers serve
Juno and Pallas / that called is Mynerue
And this ven us / her lyeges to delight
About her head / had douues white
With look benyngne / and eyes debonayre
Aye flykerynge / with snowy wings fair
For to declare / sothly in sentence
By the douues / very Innocence
Of them in love / that but truth mean
And that their ground / should honest be and clean
Ytokened is / clearly by witness
Without soylynge / of any uncleanness
And the fresshenesse / of the roses read
That in somer / so lusty do sprede
And in winter / of their color fade
Signefyeth / the hertely thoughts glade
Of young folks / that be amerous
Fervent in hope / and inly desirous
When love gynneth / in their hertes flower
Till long process / makes them to loure
With the winter / of unwieldy age
That lust is palled / and dulled with the rage
Of febylnesse / when somer is a gone
As folks know / I trow mo than one
And therefore venus / fleteth in a see
To show the trouble / and aduersytee
That is in love / and in her stormy law
Which is byset / with many sturdy wawe
Now calm now rough / who so takes head
And hope assailed aye / with sudden dread.
And next venus / Pallas I beheld
With her spear / and her cristall shield
And a raynebowe / round about her head
That of color / was grene blewe and read
And before her / as I can descryue
She growing had / a grene fresshe olyue
And thereupon / with his brows foul
In the branches / I saw sytte like a nowle.
And first the shylde / of Pallas the goddess
Signefyed / as I can express
In virtue force / by manly hye diffence
Again vices / to make resystence
And her spear / sharp and kene ground
By just rygour / was forged to confound
Them that be false / and to put a back
And for that mercy / shall meddle with the wrack
The shafte in sothe / shaven was full plain
Lest mercyles / that right ne wrought in vain
And after werre / to make full releas
There was the Olyue / that betokens peace
The owl also / so odyous at all
That songs syngeth / at festes funeral
Declares plainly / fine of every glory
Is oonly death / who has it in memory
And the raynebowe / grene read and perse
Sygnefyeth the chaunges / full diverse
That often falls / in werre and battle
Now to win / and suddenly to fail
Now stable as blewe / chau^gyng now as grene
For Pallas play / is always meynt with tene.
And alder last / as I have in mind
With her nynphes / Juno came behind
Which of custom / as fulgence tells
Abide in floodes / and in deep wells
And this Juno / as poets said
Amayden is / and of fruit barayne
And the Pecok / to this fresshe queen
Ysacred is / with his feathers shene
Splayed abroad / as a large sail
With Argus eyes / emprynted in his tail.
The water rennynge / in river and in flode
Is the labor / that men have for good
The great trouble / and the business
That day and night / they suffer for richesse
That who so ever / in these flodes row
Let him beware / for aye after the flow
Of nature / right as it is dew
Following the moon / there must an ebbesewe
The most dread is / aye upon the fulle
List fortune / the fresshe feathers pulle
Of rich folk / that shine in gold so shene
Sithe she of change / lady is and queen.
And Argus eyes / that are set behind
In nygardes hertes / be often sythes blind
Which not aduerte / of goods to the end
That like an ebb / suddenly will wend
Which they nothing / consydre in their sight
For as the fair lusty / feathers bright
Of a pecok / unawarely fall away
Right so richesse / shortly at a day
Will their master / suddenly forsake
Saying a dew / and their leave take
And as Juno / barayne is of fruit
Right so naked / bare and distytuyte
Are these gredy / hertes covetous
Which to gadre / be so desirous
That in no thing / can have suffysaunce
The fret of dread / them put in such myschau^ce
Ymagenynge / that the world will fail
And in their fere / again the wind they sail
Till all atones / they must go there fro
And thus of good / aye the fine is woe
Namely of them / that so pynche and spare
For this no dread / as clerks can declare
The fruit of good / is to spend large
And who is man full / set but little charge
To part freely / his treasour in comune
When he discretly / sethe time oportune
He has no joy / to put his good in mewe
For in heart / that fredome list to sewe
Of gentylnesse / takes no head thereto
And in this wise / Pallas and Juno
With fresshe venus / be a down descended
Like as I have / shortly comprehended
Under the guyynge / of Mercurius
Which unto me / began his tale thus
Paris quod he / lift up thine eyes and se
Lo these goddesses / here in nombre three
Which fro heaven / with their eyes clear
So dyuersly / unto the appear
Were at a feste / as I the tell shall
With all the gods / above celestyall
That Iubyter held / at his own board
Was none absent / oonly save discord
And for despyte / she was not there present
To be avenged / she set all her intent
And in her wits many ways sought
Till at the last / even thus she wrought
Of Poets / like as it is told
She took an appel / round of pure gold
With greek letters / graven up and down
Which said thus / in conclusy own
Without strife / that it were give anoon
To the fairest of them / euerychone
And of discord / this lady and goddess
As she that is / of debate maystresse
Has this appell / passing of delight
Brought to this feste / of malys and despyte
And cast it down / among them at the board
With deynous chere / speaking not a word
But on her way / fast began her hye
And suddenly / so a preuy great envy
Into the court / this appell has in brought
So great a werre / and such a contek wrought
In the hertes / of these ylke three
That after long / may not staunchedbe
Among themself / so they began disdain
Which in beauty / was most soueraygne
And which of them / has best title of right
For to conquer / this burned appell bright
And first they began thus / for beauty strive
That of rancour / their hertes almost ryue
To wit of right / who should it first possede
^o yet envy / reygneth in womanhede
That one is fayrer / than a not her hold
For each woman / of her kind would
Have on some part / prys above another
In each estate / in sothe it is none other
And each of them / in her own aduys
Has joy / in beauty / for to have a prys
For none so foul / does in a myrour prye
That she is fair / in her own eye
But like a fool / he hymfelfe does quyte
That aumber yelowe / cheseth for the white
A goundy eye / is deceived soon
That any color / cheseth by the moon
For some color / is with fire made fine
And some increased / with spyces and with wine
With oyntementes / and confeccions
And on night / by false illusions
Some appear wonder / fresshe and fair
That look derke by day light / in the air
There is no prefe / but erely by the morrow
Of such as need / no beauty for to borowe
But as nature has / her self disposed
Therefore fasting / or boystes be unclosed
Make thy choice / as bid Ouyde
When every drugge and pot / is set aside
List that thou / be after his sentence
Deceived lightly / by false appearance
For now a days / such craft is full ryue
And in this wise / thus began the strive
Betwyxe / Juno / venus / and Pallas
That be descended / for this sodaynecas
By one assent / touching their beauty
The dome thereof / committed unto the
I speak to the / that called art Paris
And hold art / right prudent and right wys
Be auysed how / thy dome shall fine
For they ne may / to nor fro declyne
But obey / all by one assent
Without strife / to thy judgment
But herke first / or that thou proceed
Of each of them / what shall be thy mede
Consydre a right / and take good head thereto
If thou the appell / grant unto Juno
She shall the give / plente of richesse
Hye renown of fame / eke worthynesse
With haboundaunce / of gold and of tresour
And do the rise / to so hye honor
That thou alone / all other shall excelle
For thy guerdon / like as I the tell.
And if to Pallas / goddess of prudence
The list the fine conclude / of thy sentence
That she may lady / of the appell be
For thy mede / she shall assure the
That of wit / and ofsapyence
Thou shall holy / have the excellence
And of wisdom / and of discrecion
To dyscerne / by clerenesse of reason
Also fer as Phoebus / cast his light
There shall not be a more / prudent knight
Nor in this world / sithe that it began
Of just report / a manlyer man
Nor to thy name / none equypollent
And if to venus / of true and clean intent
The list to grant / in conclusion
Of the Appell / to have possession
The fresshe goddess / that sit so hye above
Shall the ensure / to have unto thy love
The fairest lady / that is or was tofore
Or in this world / ever shall be bore
And in Greece / thou shall her knyghtly win
Now be aduysed / or that thou begin
Justly to deem / and for no thing spare
And I anon / began look up and stare
Greatly astoned / what me was best to do
Till at the last / I spoke Mercurye to
And said certain / that I ne would there
Give no dome / but they naked were
So that I mighty / have fully lyberte
Eueryche of them / a vyselye to se
And consydre / every circumstaunce
Who fairest were / unto my plesaunce
And goodlyest / to speak of womanhede
And after that / to my dome proceed.
And they anon / as ye have herd me seye
To my desire / mekely began obey
In all haste to do / their besy cure
Them to dispoyle / of clothing and vesture
Lyche as the statute / of my dome them bond
In a point they ne would / it not withstonde
That I might have / full inspexion
Of form and shap / and each proporsion
For to discern / as I can remember
A vysely by order / every membre
And than at erst / to Judge after right
But when that I / of each had a sight
I gave to venus / the appell right anon
Because she was / fairest of echone
And most excellynge / sothly of beauty
Most womanly / and goodly on to se
As I deem plainly / in my sight
For the stremes / of her eyes bright
Ilyche glade / and egall even of light
Were to y^ sterre / y^ shows toward night
Which called is / Esperus so shene
Venus her self / the fresshe lusty queen
The which anon / this heavenly Emperesse
After my dome of hertely / hye gladness
That of the appell she holy has the glory
And won it / justly by victory
Reioysed her / more than I can tell
That she her feres / in beauty did excel
And she in haste / of true affeccion
Concluded has fully / for my guerdon
Full demurely / low / and not a lofte
To Mercurye / with sobre words soft
Deuoyde both / of doubylnesse and slouthe
Like her beheste / hold will her truth
And suddenly / without more Iniurye
They disapered / and the god Mercurye
Streyghte to heaven / the right way took
And I anon / out of my sleep a woke.
Whereof my lord / whom I most love and dread
If ye aduerte / and wisely take heed
That this beheste / affermed in certain
Was unto me / assured not in vain
Of goodly venus / like as I have told
Wherefore I read / ye be of heart bold
Me for to send / with strong and mighty hand
Without abode / into Greeks land
After the form / that I have you said
And I hope / ye shall be well apayde
When I have speed / as venus has behyghte
And home return / with my lady bryghte
So shall ye best / me list not speak in vain
Be echaunge / of her your suster wyn again
Whom Thelamon / withholde has of yore
Lo this is all / I can say you no more
Touching the effect / holy of mine advise
And after that / stylle / sat Paris
As he that / fully himself aquyte
But say Pryam / alas where was thy wit
Of neclygence / for take keep
Thy trust to set / on dremes or on sleep
Full thynne / was thy discrecyon
To take a ground / of false illusyon
For to proceed / like the fantasye
Upon a sweuen / meynt with flaterye
Alas reason / was no thing thy guide
For Pallas / was wrongly set aside
Not received / with dew reverence
And Iuuo eke / for all her sapyence
For all her good / and lokynge debonayre
With her treasour / and her hestes fair
Refused was / alas of wylfulnesse
And she that is of love / the goddess
And eke also / of vulcanus the wife
In whose service / is ever werre and strife
Preferred was / the appell to proceed
Again all right / for Paris took none head
Save unto lust / and set a side truth
Where thorugh alas / and yt was full great routhe
The mighty rich / and the noble town
Of Troy / was brought to confusyowne
Oonly for he / knyghthode has forsake
Prudence and gold / and in his choice Ytake
Oonly a woman / and hold him thereto
That after was / root of all their woo
As this storye / ceryously shall tell
But I in dremes / will no longer dwell
But write forth / how that Dephebus
The third sone / of king Pryamus
His tale began / in open audyence
And to the king / shortly in sentence
As he that list / a truth not to spare
Even thus / his conceyte to declare.
My lord quod he / if that every wight
Aduerte should / and cast in his sight
Of future thing / the peril and the doubt
And cerche it / within and without
From point to point / always in his reason
To cast doutes / and turn up so down
Than no wight should / to no purpose wend
In any matere / for to make an end
Other presume / by manhod in his thought
Who cast perils / acheueth little or naught
For if the plowman / always cast aforne
How many graynes / in his field of corn
Shall Be devoured / of fowls rauynous
That he does sow / in feldes plenteuous
Than should he never / in vale nor in plain
For cowardshyp / throw abroad his grain
Let all such dread / now be laid aside
I hold folly / longer to abide
But y^ Paris / my brother make him strong
With his ships / for to venge our wrong
Upon greeks / with all his pain and might
To preue shortly / that he is a knight
For of reason / ye consydre may
How that no man justly / may say nay
But that Paris has / counsayled well
For by my truth / as fer as I can feel
It were error / his purpose to contrary
Wherefore / let him now no longer tarry
But hold his way / with a strong nauye
For to avenge / the great velanye
That greeks have / if ye take heed
Done heretofore to us / and to our kynrede
And for fynall execucyon
Of the recure / touching Exyon
Whom they treat / in dishonest wise
Against all right / and title of iustyse
That to think / it gives my heart a wound
The shame of which / so new does rebounde
Upon all / that be of her allye
Wherefore the best / that I can espy
Is that Paris / take this vyage
With such as be / of fresshe and lusty age
Manly to wend / into Greeks land
And by force / of their mighty hand
Maugre the Greeks / proud and most elate
Rauysshe there / some lady of estate
And than ye may / by knyghthod of my brother
If ye list change / her for that other
This most ready / and short conclusion
That I can se / for restytucion
Of Exyone / if that Paris wend
And of my counsel / shortly thus the end.
And than as fast / full discrete and sage
Helenus the fourth sone / of age
Rose from his sete / with great reverence
Prayeng his fader / grant him audyence
That he may say / in presence of them all
Openly / what that shall be fall
As he that most / of secret things can
And soberly / thus his tale began
With clean intent / and true affeccion
My lord quod he / with supportacion
Of your grace / wherein is most my trust
Let none offense / be unto your lust
Nor you displease / though I say my conceyte
Sith ye know / I mean no deceyte
For never yet / failed no sentence
But that it fill / in experyence
Like as I told / in party and in all
In pryue treat / and in general
Without menynge / of any doubylnesse
That it followed / as I did express
Remember you / and ye shall find it true
And if god will / I shall not now of new
Spare for to say / like as I conceive
Nor to be deed / with fraud you deceive
Declarynge first / of true entencion
As it shall follow / in conclusion.
That if Paris / into Greece wend
Trust me well / it will us all shende
The gods have / by reuelacion
Made unto me / demonstracion
And eke I know it / by astronomye
For never yet / in my prophecye
Ne was I deceived / of that should fall
Nor none that list / me to counsel call
So am I taught / of thing yt shall betyde
Wherefore I pray / for rancour nor for pride
Nor for envy / of none old hatrede
To take vengaunce / that ye not proceed
In your advise / like as ye purpose
I say you plainly / for me list not gloss
Ye shall repent / if ye Paris send
Into Greece / the which god defend
Wit this well for the conclusion
Shall fully turn / to our destruction
And finally / into our ruin
Like as to you / I began before deuyne
For this the fine / that there follow shall
Subuercion / both of town and wall
Of paleys / house / here in our Cite
All goth to naught / ye get no more of me
For me seems / it ought enough suffyse
That I have said / sithe that ye be wise
For if that ye / aduerte to my saw
I doubt not / that ye will withdraw
Your hand be time / or that more damage
Assail you / by constraynte of this rage
For better is / betymes to abstene
From this purpose / which is yet but grene
Than of head hastily assente
To thing for which / we shall echone repent
For plenerly there shall / no thing socoure
That there shall follow / of you and all your
Despytefull death / without excepciowne
Of one and all / abiding in this town
First on your self / plainly to endyte
Shall the vengaunce / of the greeks byte
Thorugh the furye / of their mortal tene
And your wife / cuba the queen
Shall led her life / thorugh greeks cruelte
In sorrow and woe / and in captyuyte
And your lyeges / by the sword shall pace
Of cruel de^h / without any grace
And innocents / mercyles shall blede
In your auyse / if that ye proceed
Of wylfulnesse / a werre for to make
And folylye / for to undertake
For to parturbe / your quyete and your rest
Which shall turn / no thing for the best
But to ruin / of you / and of us all
I can no more ^ but or that myschefe fall
My counsel is / before for to provide
And wylfulnesse / for to set aside
Specially / when death as I you told
Must be the fine / if ye your purpose hold
Lo here is all / without words mo
Into greece / if that Paris go.
And in this wise / when that Helenus
Had plainly said / as Guydo tells us
Tryste and heavy / with a pale face
Again resorteth / to his sitting place
Of whose sentence / astoned euerychone
Sat in silence / stylle as any stone
Powerles their hertes to resume
To speak a word / no man dare presume
Of all the prese / but kept their lyppes close
That at the last / Troylous up arose
Young fresshe and lusty / and courageous also
And aye desirous / for to have a do
In arms manly / as longs to a knight
And when that he of there / full glad and light
Saw his fader / and brethren euerychone
So inly troubled / thus he spoke anon.
O noble and worthy / sitting enuyron
Of hye prudence / and great discrecyon
Manfull also / and of hye courage
What sodayn fere / has brought you i^ this rage
What new trouble / is cropen in your breast
For the sentence / of a cowarde priest
Sith they echone / as ye shall ever find
Desire more verily / of kind
To live in lust / and void away travail
And dedely hate / to here of battle
For they their wit / finally apply
To sewe their lust / and live in glotonye
To fill their stomach / and restore their mawe
To rest and ease / ever for to draw
And to sewe / their inward appetyte
Thus their joy / and thus their delight
In etynge drinking / and in couetyse
Is their study / and fully to deuyse
How they may follow / their lust without more
Of right naught else / set they no store
Alas for shame / why be ye so dismayde
And sytte mate / astoned and afraid
For the words / of this Helenus
Ferefull for dread / as a little mous
That he quaketh / to here speak of fight
And more over / again all skylle and right
In preiudyce / of the gods all
He takes on him / to say what shall befalle
Of thing futur / for to specefye
As he had / a spyryte of prophecye
Granted to him alone / in special
As though he were / in conning perygall
To the gods / having prescience
To show before / thorugh his sapyence
What shall betyde / outher evil or good
Let be let be / for no wight is so wode
That has his wit / to give thereto credence
That any man / by craft or by science
That mortal is / has conning to deuyne
Fortunes course / or fates to termyne
Such causes hyd / conceled in secree
Reserved be / to gods preuytee
Men may dyuyne / but all is but folly
To take heed / for they do but lie
Wherefore I read / as in this matere
Both one and all / and you my lord most dear
To exclude all dread / and all that may disturb
Out of your heart / and let no thing perturbe
Your hye courages / that helenus has told
And if that he / of heart be not bold
As manhood would / to help venge our wrong
Let him go hyde him / in the temple strong
And keep him close / in contemplacion
To wake and pray / by devotion
Without socour / a days and a nyghtes
And suffer such / as be lusty knights
To haunte their youth / and grene lustynesse
Manly in arms / to preue their hardynesse
That they may have / the better acqueyntau^ce
In time coming / for to do vengeance
On their enmyes / and their cruel ^oon
And command / that Paris may forth goon
To execute / the fine / of your intent
Before purposed / in your parliament
Upon greeks / for their offencyon
To parfourme up / the pain of talyon
For wrongs old / of which yet the fame
Rehearsed is / unto our alder shame
Thorugh out the world / ye wot this is no les
And therwithall / Troylus held his pes
And suddenly all / that were present
Began atones / all by one assent
Troylus counsel / greatly for to preyse
And his manhood / to the heaven reyse
His fresshe courage / and his hye prowess
His fervent zele / and his hardynesse
And of one heart / greatly him commend
And right anon / there they made an end
Than Pryamus / when that all was done
Upon the time / of the hour of noone
To mete goth / within Ilyon
All his sons / sitting enuyron
And after mete / he called has Paris
And Dephebus / also that was full wys
And secretly / bad they should go
The same day / with other lords mo
To Panomye / in all the haste they may
To make them ready / again a certain day
With all the array / of worthy chyualrye
That they may get / in their company
Toward greece / to sail hastily
And after that / the king all sodaynely
The next day made / his counsel call
And even thus / he said before them all.
O noble lyeges / being now present
My purpose is / to say you mine intent
Without abode / to here it if ye list
As I suppose / to you is not vnwyste
How the greeks / of pride and tyranny
Of malys old / compassed by envy
In many wise / have again us wrought
Which is so grene / that I foryete naught
For day by day / encreasynge ever mo
By remembrance / renewed is my woe
When I record / and cast up and down
Our greues all / and how that Exyowne
In seruytude / among them does soiourne
Which often a day / causes me to mourn
And my heart almost / asonder ryue
For to consider / and se it by my live
Whose cruelte / we have to dear bought
Natwithstandynge / yt I have means sought
To have be in rest / without any more
When into Greece / I sent Anthenore
Peasybly my suster / to recure
And the surplus / pacyently to endure
But all for naught / they took of it no head
For all that / I offered of goodlyhede
It was not herd / for lack of gentyllesse
Record of which / doubleth my distress.
Wherefore we must / as techeth Suxgerye
With sharp yrons / seek remedy
To cut away / by the root round
The proud flesh / yt grows in the ground
Which will not void / with oyntementes soft
Albe that they / be laid thereto full often
Right so by example / we must by duresse
Get recure / when that with fayrenesse
We may none have / wherefore by your advise
My purpose is / to send forth Paryse
Into greece / some lady there to win
And bring her home / and we shall here within
Keep her strong / maugre who says nay
Till that we se / some agreeable day
That they be feign / like mine oppynyon
To have eschaunge / for her of Exyon
My dear suster / whom I love so
We may not fail / that it shall be do
So the gods / be to us favorable
And this counsel / be also acceptable
To you echone / as it is to me
For when a king / touches a comonte
Of wise men / as it is affermed
Of all the common / it ought be confermed
Thing touching all / should be apreued
Of all echone / or it were acheued
Wherefore I cast / by advise of you echone
Plainly to work / and with that word anon
This noble Pryam / was suddenly in pease
And after that among / all the prease
When all was whyste / in their aller sight
A knight up rose / and Pentheus he hight
That sone was / to Euforbyus
De transformatis / as says Ouydius
Into whom he fayneth / that there was
Whylom the soul / of Pictagoras
Holy transsumed / so as write Ouyde
As touching that / I will no longer bide
But tell forth / of this Pentheus
Before the king / which began his tale thus.
My lyege lord / unto your hye noblesse
Displease it not / nor to your worthynesse
In presence of your / mageste
That I shall say / for to acquyte me
Toward you / of my faith and truth
For soth fastly / in me may be no slouthe
Touching your honor / that without dread
With zele of faith / I brenne as does the glede
Of all harms / to bydde you beware
For doutelesse / afferme well I dare
If ye stand / in your first advise
As ye purpose / to send forth Paryse
I doubt it not / that it shall you rewe
For god well wore / of old and not of new
I had a fader called / Euforbyus
Discrete and wise / and right virtuous
And knowing had before / of every thing
By prescyence / and before wyttynge
To tell plainly / thorugh his phylosophye
So heavenly he saw / with his hertes eye
That there ^e was / no thing so secree
Hyd from his knowing / nor no pryuetee
That he it knew / he was of wit so sage
And at the last / when he was of age
An hundred year / with lokkes gray and hoar
I can remember / how he complained sore
And wept also / of pity tenderly
Fully affermynge / if Paris utterly
Went into greece / to rauysshe him a wife
There should follow / such a mortal strife
Upon us all / that sothly this Cite
Should into ashes / and scyndres turned be
And that there should / nothing us socoure
That greeks sword / shall cruelly devour
Both hye and low / and plainly spare none
Wherefore I pray / among you euerychone
Of that I tell / have no despyte
Your wrong to venge / put in respyte
And rancour old / I read that ye let
And the tranquylle / now of your quyete
Of hastynesse / that ye not submytte
To fortune / that can so falsely flytte
Perturbe not / for none old enmyte
With new sterynge / your felycyte
For if that ye / to this Journey assente
Ye euerychone full sore / shall repent
And if ye will / algates thither send
In Paris stead / let some other wend
List his vyage / be to you no speed
This my counsayse / and this is full my read
Said under supporte / oonly of your grace
And suddenly / they began echone to chase
At Pentheus / and loud again him cry
Repreuynge him / and the prophecye
Of his fader / to their confucion
But o alas / the reuolucion
Of joy or woe / or of felycyte
For thing ordained / needs must be
The order of things / with fate is so englewed
For that shall fall / may not be eschewed
Which caused them / for to assente in one
Indiscreetly / that Paris should gone
Unhappily with hap / they were enuolued
And thus co^cludy^g / their cou^sayl is dissolved
But casuelly / it befell right than
That this advise / unto the eres ran
Of Cassandra / and she with great afray
Of sudden woe / began cry welaway.
Alas quod she alas / what will ye do
What shall Paris / now into greece go
And with that word / she braste out to weep
Full pytously / with inward syghes deep
She began to wayle / and swowne for the pain
And furyously / with noise to complain
With woeful rage / and many pytous sown
She made / a mortal lamentaciowne
For to be deed / she might her not withholde
With here to torn / and with fystes fold
She said alas / more than an hundred sithe
A stormy fortune / why list thou to kythe
Thy cruel force / to our aduersyte
Upon us all / and upon this Cite
Of mortal ire / and gery vyolence
With sword of vengeance / worse tha^ pestylence
O Troy Troy / what is thy gylte alas
What have thou done / what is thy trespass
To be euersed / and turned into naught
With wild fire / thy sin is dear abought
A Pryam king / vncely is thy chance
What have thou gylte / outher do greuaunce
To thy gods / or wyrched thorugh unright
Them to provoke / to show their cruel might
Upon thy blood / alas what have thou do
O mother mine / O Ecuba also
What manner crime / or importable offense
Have thou wrought / to have such recompense
The day to abide / O noble worthy queen
Of thy sons such vengeance for to seen
O woeful death / cruel and horrible
Alas why are ye / no more credyble
To my counsel / such harms to eschew
Your mortal purpose / fully to remewe
That he go not / as it is ordained
For thought of which / I am so constrained
That uneath / I may the woe endure
And to her fader / this woeful creature
Held straight her way / and falls plat to ground
And of her weeping / all in water wound
By her chekes / so the teres rain
And as she might / for constraynt of her pain
Upon him / she began clyppe and cry
Besechynge him / to shape a remedy
With pytous voice / as she y^ knew full well
In this matere / plainly every dele
What shall befaile / and had it full in mind
The sudden harms / that we shall behind
But all her clamor / was not but in vain
For that shall fall / as some clerks said
Ne may not well / of men eschewed be
And eke fortune / by great aduersyte
Of hasty Ire / furyous and wode
And unkind / to the Troyan blood
Causeless / against them agreued
And of rancour / suddenly ameued
With blind awayte / to catch them in atrau^ce
By vyolence / of her unhappy chance
Has with a sweyght turned / her whele unstable
As she that is / enuyous and mutable
To haste troyens / to their confusion
Of wylfulnesse / and vndiscrecion
Against greeks / quarrel for to make
And thereupon / have their counsel take
And acheued / as ye have herd deuyse
Without assent / of the most wise
For if they had / the diffynacion
Of Ector herd / concluded in reason
In this matere / and of helenus
The counsel take / and to Pentheus
Aduerted wisely / and to his sentence
Without faynynge / your full credence
And of Cassandra / that never could lie
Prudently herd / the prophecye
Fro point to point / for to cast aforne
In such myschefe / they had not be lorne
But floured yet / in their felycyte
Without damage / and aduersyte
But fortune will / have her course always
Whose purpose holds / who says ye or nay
For she it was / that made this vyage
With forhede plain / and a false vysage
with sugre out shadde / and venym in the root
Bitter of taste / and in showing soote
wrynkled double / like an horned snayle
Faith in their face / and fraud aye in ye tail
To haste troyans / accord into one
That Paris should / into Greece gone
As ye have herd / there is to more to said
For here upon / they cast them to ordain
How king Pryamus sent Paris into greece with Dephebus / and other men of arms
for to take vengeance on ye greeks / and how they took ye fair Helayne queen
unto Menelaus / and brought her unto Troy. Capitulo. xiij.
THe time approaches / wha^ ye son shene
His golden wayne / whyrled up at wene
The clear sterres / of yades so read
which have their sight / in the crabbes head
And Plyade^ / the seventh sterre bright
Of which six appear to our sight
For the seventh / draws her aside
And covertly / does her bemes hyde
Whylom for she did / a great offense
That unto us / causes her absence
For she dare / not / show her stremes clear
Nor with her susterne / openly appear
Whylom for she / with a god mortal
Did a sin / that was crymynall
Which noysed was / and kou^he thorugh y^ heaven
That she alone / among the susterne seven
Shroudeth to us / shamefastly her chere
And when Titan / in the zoudyak spear
Atwene these sterres / had take his see
Of the bole / in the syxtene degree
Upon the time / of the Ioly grene may
When that Flora / with her hewes gay
Has every plain medowe / hylle and vale
With her flowers quycke / and no thing pale
Over spread and cladde / in lyuere new
And branches blosme / with many lusty hew
And bid us fully / to be glad and light
For by assurau^ce / they have their fruit behyght
Again Autumpne / who that list them shake
When on vynes / rypeth every grape
And thus this season / most lusty of disporte
Embraces / hertes with new recomforte
Oonly of hope / by kind as it is dew
That holsom fruit / shall the blosmes sewe
When time comes / by reuolucion
And thus in May / the lusty fresshe season
When brydes sing / in their armonye
The same time / out of Panomye
Repaired be / Dephebus and Paris
And with them brought / chosen by deuys
Three thousand knights / ready for to gone
With them to greece / and ships many one
Full vytayled / of all that may them need
And of these ships / the nombre as I read
Was two and twenty / like as write Guydo
And after this / without more ado
The king commands / unto Eneas
To Anthenor / and to Polydamas
In all haste / that they them ready make
With Paris / knyghtly for to undertake
As ye have herd / this Journey to acheue
And on the time / when they took their leave
Pryamus with short conclusion
Shows the effect / of his entencion
And specially / that they their deuer done
For to recure / his suster Exyone
As ye have herd / here tofore me tell
What should I more / in this matter dwell
When they were ready / without more soiour
This Paris first / as lord and governor
Of this vyage / made by Pryamus
And his brother / called Dephebus
Their leave took / with weeping tenderly
And after that / to ship manfully
Whithout abode / they began them dress
And in the name / of venus the goddess
And mighty Jove / they took their iournee
They hale up anchor / and by the large see
They began to sail / and have the wind at will
The water calm / blandysshynge and stylle
Without trouble / of any boystous wawe
And to the costs / they began fast draw
Of greeks land / for no thing them let
And of fortune / in their course they met
A grekysshe ship / mine Auctour tells thus
In which there was / the king Menelaus
Toward Pryam / a famous strong Cite
For to vysyte a Duke / of hye degree
That Nestor hyghte / and this Menelaus
Was brother eke / unto the king famous
The wise worthy great / Agamenon
Most of name / and reputacion
Among greeks / for his worthynesse
And Menelay / this storye bears witness
Husbonde was / to the queen Eleyne
That was suster / to the brethren tweyne
Castor and Pollux / which as I you told
Were of their hand / so worthy knight hold
And in that time / like to their degree
In Strynestar / their most chief Cite
They held a household / solemn and ryall
The love of whom / was so special
Of will and heart / according with the deed
Atwyxe them two / of very bretherhede
That none from other / could live alone
With whom was eke / the maid Hermyone
The young daughter / of the queen Eleyne
Of fayrenesse / most inly souereyne
Most passyngly / excellynge in beauty
And thus Troyans / saylynge by the sea
Toward greece / among the wawes wete
Of adventure / happed for to mete
King Menelaus / saylynge by their side
And none of them list / of very pride
For to enquere / what that other was
But pass forth / a full huge pas
For none of them / other could know
And aye the wind / pesybly began blow
The Troyan flete / causynge in a while
For to approach / to the noble isle
That called is / Cithera this day
And in the haven / in all the have they may
They cast anchor / and bond their ships strong
And after that / them list not tarry long
To take the land / full many lusty man
Arrayeng them / as fresshely as they can.
Now in this isle / of passing excellence
There was a temple / of great reverence
That bylded was / of old foundation
And most honored / in that region
Thorughout the land / both fer and near
The feste day / aye from year to year
Like as it fylle / by reuolucion
Repeyrynge thither / of great devotion
In honor / oonly of venus the goddess
Whom the greeks / with all their business
Honored most / of every manner age
With gifts bringing / and with pilgrimage
With great offrynge / and with sacryfyse
As used was / in their paynem wise.
For in this phane / as they knele and wake
With contryte heart / and their prayer make
The statute gave / of every question
Plain answer / and full solucion
With cerymonyes / to venus as they loute
Of every thing / that they had doubt
They had / full declaracion
And thus the greeks / upon Citheron
Halowe this feste / with rich and great array
With rytes dew / as ferforth as they may
In hope fully / the better for to thryue
And of fortune / when he did aryue
Up to the land / by adventure or cas
The same time / this feste hallowed was
Of many a greek / coming to and fro
From every cost that / to the temple go
On pilgrimage / their vows to acquyte
Of the place / the relyques to vysyte.
And when Paris / did this espy
He gadred out / of his company
The worthyest / that he chese may
And to the temple / he took the right way
Full well besene / and in knyghtly wise
And did his honor / and his sacryfyce
Full humbly / to the greeks lyche
With many an ouche / and Jewel rich
With gold and silver / stones and perre
He spends there / like to his degree
And quyt him manly / in his oblacionus
And deuoutely / in his oryso^s
He him demeneth / that joy was to se
Now was Paris / of passing great beauty
Among all / that ever were alive
For there was none / that might with whym strive
Troyan nor greek / to speak of semelyhede
Wonder fresshe / and lusty / as I read
And in his port / full like a gentle knight
Of whose person / for to have a sight
They began to prease / both nyghe and fere
So ryally / he had him in his gere
And coueyte / of hye estate and low
What he was / greatly for to know
And of his men / they ask besely
Fro whense he came / and the cause why
Of his coming / enquerynge one by one
But prudently / they kept them euerychone
That no thing was / openly espyde
In their answer / so they have them gyde
That every thing / kept was secree
Eueryche of them / was so auysee
Albe that some / openly declare
What that he was / and ne list not spare
But told plainly / the cause of his coming
And how Pryam / the strong mighty king
His fader was / most ryall of renown
And how he came also / for Exyowne
Thus each of them / began with other rowne
At pryme face / when he came to town
And thereupon / were ymagynatyfe
Sore musing / and inquysityfe
Each with other / by suspeccion
Demynge thereof / like their oppynyon
And rathest they / that no thing ne knew
As folks done / of things that be new
And whiles they / of this matter treat
In sundry wise / among their words great
The saying of them / began anon atteyne
To the eres / of the queen Eleyne
Nygh beside / in that region
And when she herd / by reuelacion
And by report of them / that came between
This fair Eleyne / this fresshe lusty queen
Anon as she / the sothe / understood
Without taryenge / or any more abode
She hastes her / to this solempnyte
The fresshe folk / of Frygye / for to se
Well more god wot / in her entencion
To se Paris / than for devotion
Under color / of holy pilgrimage
To the temple / she takes her vyage
With a great meyne / and ryall of parayle
Paris to se for she will not fail.
But alas / what lusty new fire
Has her heart, en^lawmed by desire
To go to vigiles / outher to spectacles
None holiness / to here of miracles
Has meued her / that there shall befall
But as the manner / is of women all
To draw thither / platly to conclude
Where as they be sure / that multitude
Gadred is at lyberte to se
Where they find / opportunyte
To their desire / full narowe they awayte
Now covertly / their eyes for to bayte
In place where as / set is their pleasaunce
Now pryuely / to have their dalyaunce
By some sign or casting of an eye
Or tokens showing / in heart what they dry
With touch of hands / stole among the prese
With arm or foot to catch up in their lose
Whom that them list / all be he fre or bond
Of nature / they can him hold an hand
Again whose sleyghte / avails wit nor might
For what them list / be it wrong or right
They ay acheue / who says ye or nay
Again whose lust / defend him no man may.
Thus Guydo / aye of cursed false delight
To speak them harm / has caught an appetite
Thorughout his book / of women to say ill
That to translate / it is again my will
He has aye joy / their honor to transuerse
I am sorry / that I must reherce
The fell words / in his book I found
To all women / I am so much bound
They ^e echone / so goodly and so kind
I dare of them / not say as I find
Of Guydoes write / thorughout Troy book
For when I read / for fere my heart quoke
And verily / my wits began fail
When I thereof / made rehersayle
Like his decrete / but Guydo now be quyt
For ye shall here anon / how that he chyt
The queen Eleyne / for cause that she went
With devout heart / her offrynge to present
To the temple / of venus the goddess
Thus word by word / he says to her express
O mortal harm / that most is for to dread
A fraud I ^aste / by sleyghte of womanhede
Of every woe / gynnynge crop and rote
Against which / help may no bote
When lust has drive / in their heart avail
Aye dedely venyme / seweth at the tail
Which no man / has power to restreyne
Record I take / of the queen Eleyne
That ho^e burnt / alas in her desires
Of new lust / to dele with straungeres
Whom she knew not / ne never saw aforne
Where thorugh alas / full many me^ were lorne
Of cruel death / embraced in the cheyne
Without pity / now say thou queen Eleyne
What ghost or spirit / alas has meued the
Sool fro thy lord / in such royalte
Out of thy house / to go among the prease
Why were thou weary / to live at home in pease
And went out / strangers for to se
Taking no head / unto thyn honest
Thou should have kept / thy closet secretly
And not have passed out / so folyly
In the absence / of thy lord alas
Thou were to wylfull / and rakell in this ^as
To se before / what should after sewe
For all to soon / thou were drawn out of mewe
That could not keep / at home thy bounds
Thou wentest out / as hare among ye hounds
For to be caughte / of very wylfulnesse
And thy desire / coudest not compesse
For though thy lust / list not to refrain
O many woman / has caught in a train
Their going out / such halowes for to seek
It sit them better / them self for to keep
Close in their chamber / and fle occasiowne
For never ship should / in peril drown
Nor scatre on rock / nor be with tempestrent
Nor with carybbes / devoured or I shent
Nor go to wrake / with no weders ylle
If it were kept / in the haven stylle
For who will not / occasions eschew
Nor dread no / peril for to sewe
He must among / of necessyte
Or he be ware / endure aduersyte
And who can not / her foot fro trappes spare
Let her / be ware or she fall in the snare
For harm I done / to late is to complain
For if whylom / the worthy queen Eleyne
Her self had kept / at home in close
Of her there ne had be / so wycke a lose
Reported ye^ grene / fre she and new
Whose chance unhappy / ethe man ought rewe
That cause was / of such destruction
O^ many worthy / and confusion
Of her worthy husbonde / and many other mo
On greeks side / and on Troy also
In this storye / as ye shall after read
And so this queen / as fast as she may speed
To the temple / has the way nome
Full ryally / and when that she was come
Full devoutly / within Citheron
Made unto venus / her oblacion
In presence and sight / of many one
With many jewel / and many rich stone.
And when Paris had / this espied
To the temple / anon he has him hyed
Full thryf tely / in all the haste he might
And when that he had / first a sight
Of the goodly / fair fresshe queen
Cupides darte / that is whet so kene
Or he was ware / has him marked so
That for astoned / he ne wyste what to do
So he meruayleth her great semelynesse
Her womanhede / her port and her fayrenesse
For never before / ne wend he that nature
Could have made / so fair a creature
So aungellyke / she was of her beauty
So femynyne / so goodly on to se
That he dempte / as by lyklynesse
For her beauty / to be some goddess
For his heart / did him aye assure
That she was / no mortal creature
So heavenly fair / and so celestyall
He thought she was / in party and in all
And consydereth / for auysely
Her futures in order / by and by
Ententyfly / within his reason
Every thing / by good inspeccion
Her golden here / like the son stremes
Of fresshe Phoebus / with his bright bemes
The goodlyhede / of her fresshely face
So replenysshed / of beauty and grace
Even ennewed / with quyckenesse of color
Of the rose / and the lylye flour
So egally / that nouther was to wit
Thorugh none excess / of much nor of lyte
Within the cerclynge / of her eyes bright
Was paradys compassed / in her sight
That thorugh abreste / the beauty would perce
And certainly / if I shall reherce
Her shap her form / and futures by and by
As Guydo does / by order ceryously
From head to fo^e / clearly to deuyse
I have none english / that thereto may suffyse
It will not be / our tunge is not like
I want flowers / also of rethoryke
To sewe his flourysshyng / or his gay peynture
For to descryue / so fair a creature
For my colors / be to feeble and faynte
That nouther can ennewe / well nor paynte
Eke I am not acqueynted / with no^use
Of all mine / therefore I me excuse
To you echone / not all of neclygence
But for defaute / oonly of eloquence
And you remytte / to Guydo for to se
How he descryueth / by order her beauty
To take on me / it were presumpciowne
But I will tell / how Paris up and down
Gothe in the temple / and his eye cast
Toward Eleyne / and began prese fast
As he that burnt / hoote in loves fire
That was enflawmed / greatly by desire
And often he changes countenance and chere
And ever he neygheth / to her nere and nere
Ydarted thorugh / with her eyes tweyne
And again ward / the fresshe queen Eleyne
As hoote burnt / in heart pryuely
Albe no man / it outward could espy
For she thought / she had never before
Of all men / that ever yet were bore
Se none so fair / nor like her pleasaunce
On him to look / was her suffysaunce
For in the temple / she took head of right naught
But to compass / and cast in her thought
How she may catch / opportunyte
With him to speak / at good lyberte
This holy was / all her business
For him she felt / so inly great distress
That often she changes / countenance and hew
And venus has / marked them of new
With her brondes / fyred by feruence
And enflawmed / by sudden influence
That egally they were brought in a rage
And save the eye / atwe^e was no message
Each on other so fyxe / has cast their sight
That they conceive / and wyste ^one right
Within themself / what their heart mente
And ne^e to her / ever Paris went
To seek fully and get occasion
That they might by full relacion
Their hertes conceyt / declare secretly
And so vefell that Paris nygheth nigh
To the place / where the queen Eleyne
Stood in her see / and there at wene them tweyne
They broke out / the su^me of all their heart
And gave issue / to their inward smerte
But this was done / list they were espied
When the people was / most occupied
In the temple^ for to stare and gase
Now here now there / as it were on a mase
They kept them close / that no word asterte
There was no man / the treson might aduerte
Of them twain / ne what they would mean
But at the last / Paris and this queen
Concluded have / with short auysement
Fully the fine / of their both intent
And set a purpose / betwyxe them in certain
When they cast / for to mete again
But list men had to them suspeccion
They made an end / without more sermon
And depart / albe that they were loathe
And soberly anon / this Paris gothe
Out of the temple / his heart in every part
Wounded thorugh out / with loves fiery darte
To his ships / he held the right way
And than anon / in all the haste he may
When assembled was / his chyualrye
One and other / of his company
In few words / as shortly as I can
Tofore them all / his tale thus he began.
Sy^res quod he / shortly to express
The cause is kouthe / to yor worthynesse
Why my fader / into Greece us sent
For as ye know / the chief of his intent
Was to recure / his suster Exyon
Out of the hands / of king Thelamon
The which thing / for ought I can espy
Is impossyble / shortly in mine eye
By any way / as fer as I can se
He is so great / and strong in this country
Of his allies / about on every side
And in heart ^ so inly full of pride
To yield her up / he has not but disdain
Thereof to treat / it were not but in vain
Therefore the best / that I can deuyse
Sith our power / may not now suffyse
To werrey him / in this regyowne
We be not egall / of might nor of renown
For lack of men / with him to hold a field
We may not semble / with spear nor with shield
To encountre him / with all his multitude
Wherefore the best / that I can conclude
Is sith fortune / has us hyder brought
And the gods / have eke for us wrought
So graciously / to make us for to land
At venus temple / fast by the stronde
Which haboundeth / with full great richesse
Of greeks offrynge / unto the goddess
By land and see / fro many sundry port
Of men and women / that have here resort
To that place / in worship of venus
So that the wife / of king Menelaus
Is there present / full rich and well beseyne
And if that we / by manhood might atteyne
To rauysshe her / and the temple spoil
And of their treasoure / chesen out and coil
The chief iewelles / and charge our summers
With gold and silver / and take prisoners
And maugre them / to our ships bring
This same night / without taryenge
We may not fail / who ever that say nay
If ye assente / of a rich pray
Wherefore in haste / that ye now ready make
And every man anon / his harnes take
And arm him well / in his best aray^
And they assente / without more delay
And in their ships / they bide till at night
When Phoebus chare / with drawn had his light
Under wawes / and sterres did appear
On the heaven / with their stremes clear
Or the moon / that time did rise
They shope them forth / in full thryfty wise
The manly Troyans / in steel armed bright
To the temple / holding their way right
For they cast no longer / for to tarry
But proudely enter / in the sentuarye
Into the chapel / called Citheron
Without reverence / or devotion
Done to venus / in her oratorye
For it was clean / out of their memory
Honor and dread / and all obseruaunce
For finally / all their attendaunce
As mine Auctor / sothely can diffyne
Was to right naught / but oonly to rauyne
They took all / that came to their hand
Richesse and treasour / that was in the land
Gold and silver / stones and Iewelles
Relyques sacred / the holy eke vessels
Without abode / out of the sacrarye
And all yfere / to their ships carye
It is a wonder / to think on the good
They kylle and s^e / all that them withstode
It was a pity / for to se them blede
And many greeks / they to ship led
That after lived / in captyuyte
Full many year / in Troy the Cite.
And there whiles goth / Paris to Eleyne
And her embraces / in his arms tweyne
Full humbly / and with great reverence
In whom he fond / no manner resystence
It sat her not / she was so womanly
For to Paris / she yolde her utterly
Her heart in hap / was yolde or she came there
Therefore to yield her / she had less fere
She can not strive / nor no woman should
And he anon / as gentyllesse would
Comfort her / as he best can or may
And ladde her with him / without more delay
To his ships / and there full besyly
He set wards / to keep her honestly
While he retourneth / to the temple again
To spoil and rob / and to make all plain
Thorugh the temple / with walls wide
Now stood a castle / fast there beside
Ystuffed well / with grekysshe souldeours
The which awoke / with noise of the pylours
The same night / and began make a shoute
And therwithall / anon they issue out
Armed in steel / the temple to reskewe
And manfully / after them they sewe
And so befylle / when they togydre met
With speres sharp / and swerdes kene whette.
They ran togydre / as Tygres vnmylde
Like wodelyons / or these bores wild
There was no faynynge / found in their fight
Albe the field / departed was aryght
For the Troyans / doubled them in noumbre
That utterly / the greeks they encoumbre
And of myschefe / made them to flee
And pursue / after and cruelly them slay
Without mercy / to the castle gate
There was no rescuse / for they came late
Of this skarmysshe / for the fine was death
Now here now there / they yolde up the breath
So myghtely / Troyans / them assail
That to withstand / it would not avail
For of manhood / they the field have won
And after that / cruelly begone
In all haste / to spoil the castle
And to ship / they brought euerydell
Treasour and gold / and what that they may wyn
And on the morrow / to sail they begin
Stuffed with good / by the grekysshe see
Toward the costs / of Troy the Cytee
The sea was calm / and fully at their will
Both of tempest / and of storms ylle
And clear also / was the bright heaven
That in space almost / of days seven
At the castle called / Tenedowne
They aryue / six mile fro the town
And glad and light / they to land went
And after that / I find Paris sent
His messager straight / unto the king
That him enfourmeth / of his home coming
Of their expleyt / he told him euerydele
And Pryamus / lyketh wonder well
That so manly / they have borne them out
And made puplysshe it / in the town about
This tidings / with great solempnyte
To hye and low / thorugh out the cite
And that for joy / the most and the least
For remembrance / halowe and hold a feste
And thank their gods / in full humble wise
With obseruaunces / and with sacryfyse
On their auters / with great devotion
And all this while / he at Tenedon
Holds soiour / with the queen Eleyne
The which began reufully / complain
Her vnkouthe life / to dwell with strangers
All desolate / among prisoners
Fer sequestered away / from her country
Solytarye / in captyuyte
She wepeth and cries / with a pytous chere
The burbly wawes / of her eyes clear
Like well stremes / by her chekes rain
And for constraynt / of her inward pain
Full often a day / her song was welaway
With sobbing voice / that she so fer away
Departed is / from her Menelaus
For whose absence / in rages furyous
Her life she hates / and curses eke fortune
And in this woe / she ever does contune
Without soiour / always more and more
And for her brethren / Pollux and Castore
And for the love / of her daughter dear
Now pale and grene / she wexyth of her chere
That whylom was / fressher for to seen
Than the lyllye / on his stalk gren^
Alas changed is / her rosen hew
And ever on her / woe increases new
That like no woman / she was to behold
For aye she wept / as she to water would.
Till at the last / in all her heaviness
Paris to her came / of gentyllesse
Her to comfort / and to appese her rage
He besyeth him / her sorrows to aswage
Saying to her / what may all this mean
That ye alas / o goodly fresshe queen
List thus your self / in sorowynge diffygure
I wonder greatly / how ye may endure
So much water / causeles to shede
That with weeping / have dewed so your wede
For like a conduyte / the stremes ran down
Like to a penytaunt / in contryciowne
Ye you dis^aye / alas why do you so
Let be this fare / and let it over go
All your weeping / thought and heaviness
And be no more / my lady in distress
Make an end / now of your greuaunce
For all the ease comfort / and pleasaunce
That men may do / trust well ye shall have
It is but folly / in sorrow thus to rave
Let pass over / all these sharp shoures
And here my truth / ye and all youres
Of what your list / shall have suffysaunce
As ferforth / and more habundaunce
Than ye had among / the greeks there
I you ensure / and be no thing in fere
That I shall hold / all that I have hight
On my truth / as I am true knight
In word and deed / with all my heart entere
And she anon / with a doleful chere
So as she might / for sobbing tho suffyse
Answered again / in full lowly wise.
I wo^e quod she / were me loathe or lose
Sith I am caught / and take of this myschefe
Unto your will / I may not now with seye
I am so bound / that I must obey
Under your danger / that I may not flee
In hold discryued / and captyuytee.
Ye wot also / by nature out of dread
That it ne longs / unto womanhede
In strange soil / to strive or rebelle
And namely there / where as her quarelle
Shall have no favor / nor sustained be
But if you list / now to have pity
On me or mine / of your goodlyhede
Ye may of god / deserve thank and mede
That will reward / justly all tho
That comfort them / that be in care and woe.
Now lady mine / than quod Paris
What that may like / or be at your deuys
All shall be do / trust me right well
For by my truth / as fer as I can feel
In any thing / that may you do pleasaunce
ye shall it have / with all habundaunce
This I ensure / of heste not fallyble
Be not agaste / but fully be credyble
To my words / and hestes euerychone
And therwithall / he ladde her right anon
Into a place / of royal apparayle
To comfort her / if it would avail
And secretly there / between them two
This Paris first / without more a do
Spoke unto her / and said lady dear
I feign not / but speak of heart entere
And that I hope / ye shall in deed find
Wherefore I pray / enprente in your mind
What I say / and in your remembrance
This is to say / sithe ye by purueaunce
Be of the gods / brought as now thereto
And fortune eke / will that it be so
I dare afferme / plainly for the first
That they disposed / have not for your wyrste
But for your good / and so ye must it take
Wherefore I read / to let over shake
All heaviness / and look that ye be
As glad and light / here in this country
As though ye were / in your own land
For faithfully / I do you to understand
ye shall have here / as much habundaunce
On every part / with full suffysaunce
Of all that may / be to you plesaunt
For of o thing / I dare make auaunt
In this country / as it shall be found
Of all plente / we pass and habounde
More rychely / than your greeks yonder
And though ye be / fro them now a sonder
Out of the land / that called is Achaye
ye have no cause / you so to dismaye
Sith at worship / and more reverence
At more honor / and gretter excellence
ye shall be cherysshed / more than ye were before
And where ye plain / that ye have forbore
your own lord / and be as now left sole
For whom ye make / all this woe and dole
ye shall in haste / be set better at ease
For certaynely / so it not displease
Nor offend / unto your womanhede
Instead of him / I purpose out of dread
To wedde you / and be your true man
To love and serve / in all that ever I can
Without feynynge / to my lives end
And be to you / as lowly and as kind
As dilygent / and more laborous
Than Whylom was / your Menelaus
In every thing / your lusts to obey
Have here my truth / till time that I deye.
And though that I / in words be but plain
For the love of god / have no disdain
Of my request / nor grutche not at all
For at the least / of the stock royal
I am descended / and come of as hye blood
As Menelay / and of birth as good
And can in love / to you be more true
Than he was ever / and change for no new.
Wherefore stynte thus / to plain and weep
And let some comfort / in your bosom crepe
Your woe appese / which is not worth an hawe
And some myrthe / let in your heart adawe
This I beseech / and of womanhede
To my words / for to take heed.
Alas quod she / how might this befalle
That have left / my friends one and all
In a strange land / and am here alone
How should I than / but I made moan
I have no cause / god wot for to pleye
Nor my chekes / for to keep dreye
From salt teres / alas it will not be
That can none end / of mine aduersyte
For in good faith / it were against kind
So sodaynely to put / out of mind
Thylke thing / that for joy or smerte
In all this world / sytteth next my heart
For whom alas / so sore I am destrayned
But sithe gods / have as now ordained
No better chance / of hope unto me
I can no more / I must it take at gre
And humbly accept / also their sonde
For I am feeble / their power to withstonde
Wherefore I shall / again my will now strive
Albe for woe / my heart I feel ryue
For to consent / and lowly to admytte
Thylke thing / fro which I may not flytte
Maugre my will / of necessyte
Fully to obey / what ye list do with me
It will not help / though I said nay
And thus she payneth / all that ever she may
Little and little / her sorrow to aswage
What should she aye / live in woe and rage
To lose her self / so tender a creature
An heart of stele / ne might it not endure
But aye of women / the manner and the kind
That they can not / of sorrow make an end
Till they by leyser / have wept their fulle
But at the last / when they gynne dulle
To make sorrow / to hap them as fast
That by grace / they soon it over cast
And lightly catch / comfort for their smerte
They be so tender / yt men may them convert
From woe to joy / and thought from them disseuer
There is no storm / that may last ever
As clerks wise / in books list discern
Thing vyolente / may not be eterne
For after storms / Phoebus bryghter is
And so by comfort / and counsel of Paris
She dawed is / of her old sorrow
For even like / as the glad morrow
Of kind seweth / the derke black night
So by process / her heart wexeth light
And of her weeping / dried is the well
Like as the storye / shall anon us tell.
How Paris was received at Troy / at his home coming / and how he wedded the
fair Eleyne. Capytulo. xiiij.
When the queen / that called is Eleyne
Adawed was / of her drery pain
And the wawes / of her heavy chere
On her chekes / gonne for to clear
Paris in heart / fresshe and amerous
In haste has sent / to king Pryamus
For horse and men / and other apparayle
Clothes of gold / full noble of entayle
Made for Eleyne / and wrought for the nones
With rich perle / and many sundry stones
Again her coming / into Troy town
And after that / Paris fro Tenedowne
Shappeth him / to lead her into Troy
And Pryamus met them / on the weye
Full ryally / as fast as he may hye
With many a lord / in his company
Full many lady / fresshe and well beseyne
And many maid / that ride them again
First estates / and after comuners
Now had Paris / all his prisoners
Set before in order / tweyne and tweyne
And he rode next / with the queen Eleyne
And Dephebus / upon the other side
And his knights / enuyrondyde ride
But next him rode / the worthy Eneas
And the Troyan / called Pollydamas
His meyne suynge / each in his degree
So gentylmanly / that joy it was to se
Eeche from other / keeping a certain space
And forth they rode / but a soft pace
Till that the king / them met suddenly
And received them / solempnely
As he best could / and goodly took the reyne
Into his hand / of the queen Eleyne
And her conveyed forth / to his Cite
Great was the prease / that abode to se
Of sundry folk / that shoued fast and croude
The shyrle trumpettes / were yreysed loud
Up to the sky / goth the blysfull sown
When all this people / enters in the town
And many a another / diverse instrument
That all tofore / in at the gates went
In sundry wise / that made melodye
That to here / the heavenly armonye
By musyke touched / upon string and cord
So even in one / and justly they accord
It would an heart / rauysshe into joy
And when they were / entered into Troy
Amydde his palayse / king Pryamus alyghte
And anon as fast / as ever he might
Into a chamber rich / and well besey
The queen Eleyne / in haste he does convey
Co^maundynge with heart / will and thought
His officers / that her fail naught
Of any thing / that she can bethynke
The spyces parted / anon ye wine they drink
And than the king took leave / till suppyre
And she there whiles / changes her attire.
But of the joy / that was in the town
In every place / where men went up and down
I am to rude / sothely all to write
So much in heart / the Troyans them delight
That safe and sound / returned is Paris
They wend to have be / for joy in paradys
That he so well / sped / in his iourne
And has not one lost / of his meyne
Whereof they be / in heart glad and light
And in all haste / after the next night
As write Guydo / without taryeng long
Erely on the morrow / before the large song
In Pallas temple / as mine Auctor says
Assured was / by oath / and eke by faith
The bond of wedlock / of him and of Eleyne
For ever more to last / atwene them tweyne
The knotte is knyt / of this sacrament
And thus was done / fully by the assent
First of the king / and also by the advise
Of all the Cite / in favor of Paryse
And so the feste / and great solempnyte
Continued was / with much ryalte
Of this wedding / in myrthe and solace
Thorugh the town / by eyghte days space
What should I write / the revel or ye daunces
The fresshe array / or the countenaunces
The scole touches / the lokes amerous
The pryue grutchyng / of them yt were Ialous
The great Iustes / bordes or tornaye
Amydde palestre / with many sundry play
The diverse courses / eke at every feste
The large plente / done unto the least
The strange metes / the manner of seruyse
I have none english all / for to deuyse
I pass over / for I was not there
But when this wedding / came to the ere
Of Cassandra / and first it did espy
A thousand sithe / alas she began to cry
Of pytous woe / with untrussed heeres
And said thus / all be speynte with teeres
O wretched Troy / errynge in this case
Within thy self / to suffer this trespase
For to consent / unto such folly
In susteynynge / of foul auoutrye
That Paris should take / unto wyue
The queen Eleyne / whose husband is a live
O woeful Troy / to cruel is thy fate
For to beware / it is almost to late
The time is come / thou shalt destroyed be
For many fader / shall his sone se
Hole on the morrow / that shall be slain or eve
Amyddes the field / that will him sore grieve
And many wife / sore shall bewepe
To se her husband / with large wounds deep
Gryde thorugh the body / pale cold and grene
Alas how shall ye / the sorrow mow sustene.
A wretched moders / how shall ye endure
To se your childerne / by cruel adventure
Before you slain / without remedy
It will not help / though ye clepe and cry.
A mother mine / Eccuba the queen
How shall thou bide / the sharp stoundes kene
Thy worthy sons / to seafore the slawe
And in the field / be cruelte Idrawe.
A blind people / of death thou take no head
Why ne will thou work / and do after my read
And in this case / more prudent be and wise
To take away Eleyne / fro Paris
As right requereth / without any more
And to her lord / justly her restore.
What trow ye his theft / and cruel deed
Shall pass thus / nay nay without dread
The sword of vengeance / shall full sharp byte
For his offense / and we shall bear the wit
Paleys and house / to se within a throw
And toures hye / laid on the earth low
Alas alas / I say to the Eleyne
Unhappy woman / causer of our pain
Hard and vnsely / and also graceles
Vnwelfull woman / distourbler of our pes
Thou have us brought / in myschefe and in were
Kyndled a bronde / to set us all afere
Alas thou art / the ground and root of all
Of many drery feste / fymerall
That shall behold / among us in this town
And in this wise / Cassandra up and down
About ran / in subarbe / and in street
And cries ever / whom that ever she mete
Full often sithe / alas / and welaway
Till Pryamus / because of her affray
And for the noise / that she did make
Without more / anon he does her take
And bind fast / fetred in prison
Without mercy / or remyssyon
They took no head / to her sad truth
Nor to her words / it was the more routhe
But shet her up / in bonds great and strong
Without pity / where she abydde long
And thus in prison / a while I leave her morn
And to the greeks / I will again return.
THe unhappy time / and in ye same while
That fortune falsely / began to smyle
Upon Troyans / and bad them to be merye
For which hyely / they began their gods herye
Wenynge in joy / to have be assured well
No thing aduertynge / the turnynge of ye whele
Of her that lasts stable / but a throw
Wha^ men most trust her / she can make amowe
Turn her forhede / and her face wrythe
Such joy she has / her doubylnesse to kythe
And to wrappe her clerenesse / under cloud
Against whose might / no man may hy^ shroude
Wha^ she most flatereth / tha^ she is l^st to tryste
For in her joy / the Troyans little wyste
What she mente / to their confusiowne
For while that they / about in all the town
Wend of greeks / have gotten full recure
Of their damages / and ever to have be sure
Thorugh thylke pray / that Paris had won
The wicked fame / and rumoure is Yronne
With swyfte wings / of all yt they have wrought
To Menelay / the tidings were Ybrought
Whiles he abode / with Nestor at Pyra
First of the temple / in Cithera
How it was spoiled / and the robberye
Of gold and treasoure / and the tyranny
Upon his men / by Troyans execute
Both of assaylynge / and of all the suit
That on the greeks / they made cruelly
And how that they / ne spared utterly
Man nor woman / that came in their way
That they ne took / and ladde as for pray
To their ships / also of the fight
Before the Castle / that was on the night.
And alder last / he hereth of his wife
Whom he loved / as much as his life
More tenderly god wot / a thousand fold
For whom astoned at heart / he waxed as cold
As any stone / and pale of his hew
His hertely woe / so inly began renew
That first when he herd / her name sown
Without more / anon he fell in a swowne
For he ne might endure / for to stand
Till duke Nestor / took him by the hand
And him awoke / of his deedly swowgh
Alas quod he / why have I lost and howgh
My lives lust / my hertely suffysaunce
A come now death / and make of my greuaunce
Fully and end / with thy cruel darte
That wounded am / thorugh on every part
My heart also / korue in every pain
For you my wife / for you mine own Eleyne
That be deuorced / from welaway
Farewell my joy / farewell mine old play
Now have strangers / of you possession
Which will to me / be full confusion
Alas I noot / how they you cherysshe or trete
My fair Eleyne / that were to me so mete
Now ye are gone / pensyfenesse me slethe
I may not wait now / but after death
And after this^ amyd in all his woe
This Menelay / shope him for to go
To his reygne / but little there beside
He axeth horse / and said he would ride
Sool to complain / of yt he felt him grieve
But all this while / Nestor will not leave
To go with him / for consolacion
Of frendely right / having compassion
Him to comfort / with all his full might
^edynge with him many a worthy knight
Into the reygne / of this Menelaus
Than first of all^ the storye tells us
How they sent / for Agamenon
And for Castor / to come to him anon
And for Pollux / if it might be
And when that they / were come all three
And saw their brother / i^ such myschef brought
Almost murdered / with his own thought
Without abode / the wise Agamenon
To give him comfort / and consolacion
Did his labor / and dylygence entere
Saying to him / right as ye shall here.
O brother mine / what woe / what heaviness
What deedly sorrow / thus inly may oppress
Your knyghtly heart / or trouble your manhede
More furyously / Iwys than it is need
For though that right / requered utterly
You for to sorrow / and had cause why
Yet me seems / by just prouydence
Ye should slyely / dissymule your offense
Sith each wise man / in his aduersytee
Should feign chere / and keep in secree
The inward woe / that bind him in distress
By manly force / rathest there compesse
The spirit of Ire / and melancolye
Where the people / it soonest might espy
It is a doctrine / of them that be prudent
That when a man / with furye is to rent
To feign chere / till time he se leysere
That he of vengeance / kyndele may the fyere
For sorrow out showed / if I shall not feign
Who so takes head / it does things twain
It causes friends / for to syghe sore
And his enemies / to rejoice more
Thy friend in heart / is sorye of nature
Thine enemy glad / of thy mysaduenture
Wherefore in heart / wha^ woe does most habou^de
Feign gladness / thine enemy to confound
And show in chere / as thou roughtest naught
Of that most is grievous / in thy thought
And where thou have / most matter to complain
Make there good face / and glad in port ye feign
For into teres / though thou all distylle
And rende thy self / as thou would the spylle
It helps not / to a leg thy greuaunce
For nouther honor / nor pursuit of vengeance
With sorrow making / mow be execute
Though it last ay / there comes thereof no fruit
Men lay how he / that can dissymule a wrong
How he is slyghe / and of heart strong
And who can / be pesyble in his smerte
It is a token / he has a manly heart
Not to weep / as women in their rage
Which is contrary / to an hye courage
With word and weeping / for to aue^ge our pain
By no means / to worship to attain
Let us with sword / and not with words fight
Our tunge appese / by ma^hod preue our might
Word is but wind / and water that we weep
And though the tempest / and the floddes deep
Of this two / increase ever moo
They may not do / but augment our woo
And to our soon / thereof when they here
Both of our dole / and our heavy chere
All is to them / but encrase of joy
Wherefore brother / a while do acoye
The cruel tourment / that bind you so sore
For in proverb / it has be said full yore
That the prowess / of a manly knight
Is proved most in myschefe / and his might
To be assured / in aduersyte
Strongly sustene / what woe that it be
Not cowardly / his courage to submytte
In every peril / nor his honor flytte
Thorughe no despair / but hope always well
And have a trust / true as any ste^e
To acheue / aye what he take an hand
For finally / I do you understand
That of himself / who has good fantasye
To set upon / and put in Iupar^ye
What that befalle / or hap / what hap may
Taking what chance / will turn on his play
The fine of such / gladly is victory
They fail selde / of the palm of glory
And time is now / to speak in words few
O brother mine / manhood for to show
To pluck up heart / and you to make strong
And to venge your da^mages / and your wrong
We shall echone help / and lay to hand
Kings / Dukes / and lords of this land
And atones / do our business
I you behyghte / your harms to redress
And in despyte / of who that ever us let
We shall us lodge / and our tents set
Even in the field / before Troy town
And lay before it sege / to their destrucciowne
Albe thereof / I set as now no day
But brother first / in all the haste we may
Let make letters / without more sermon
To all the lords / of this regyon
Of matere / touching your vyllanye
To come togydre / and shape remedy
This is the effect / of all that I can said
And thus relesed / somewhat of his pain
Is Menelaus / thorugh comfort of his brother
For when he fawe / it might be none other
And of his tale / the king made an end
Thorugh out y^ land / he did his letters send
First to her kynne / and his alye
To come to help him / of their curtesye.
And first of all / to Menelaus
Came Achylles / and with him Patroclus
And alder next / strong Dyomede
And many a another / to help in this need
And all echone / in open Parliament
They were accorded / full by one assent
To be governed / as Agamenon
List to ordain / in his discrecion
Of this vyage / they made him governor
And of their ooste / cheffetayne and Emperor
Among them all / there was full unity
Upon Troyans / avenged for to be
And from this purpose / never to remewe
But first I find / Paris for to sewe
The vyage took / the worthy brethren tweyne
Pollux and Castor / to recure Eleyne
Yet nevertheless / as some books tell
That these kings / no longer would dwell
But taste as Paris / was agone
They took a ship / and followed anon
With many worthy / in their company
And ^outeles / but if books ^ye
That or they had / sailed days three
To Troyewarde / in the large see
The tempest rose / and wyndes did awake
The heaven derke / with the clouds blake
That have the day / turned into night
And bright Phoebus / was myrked of his light
The fyry leuene / and stroke of the thonder
Smote in the maste / and shyuerde it asonder
It was so derke / no light might adawe
The sea began swelle / with many sturdy wawe
That rose on hyghte / large as any mount
And fell down / and swapped in the frounte
Even of the ship / and plounged it full low
Now up now down / forcast and over throw
Their ships were / with tempest to and fro
The famy water / grene white and blo
Of fervent boylynge / and as pytche eke black
With storm and wind / yt all goth to wrack
So hydouslye / the blastes at them drive
That every board / began from other ryue
And all is perysshed / there escaped not a man
But all atones / as I rehearse can
Be deed and drowned / with tempest sodaynely
There escaped none / I say certaynely
Except the brether / such as books tell
The toon in heaven / the the other low in hell
Were lords made / to abide eternally
And some feyne / in their poesy
How the gods / have them deyfyed
Like in heaven / and ystellyfyed
After their ships / were ygo to wrake
They were made sterres / in the zoudyake
And to the sign / transfourmed utterly
Which is of clerks / called gemyny
The which sign / and constellacion
Is to Mercurye / house and mansion
And is of kind / femynyne and masculyne
In which the Egle / and also the Dolphyne
Have their arysynge / by reuolucion
The tail also / above of the dragon
Is exaltate / in the third gree
Of Gemmy / which sign has most pouste^
In hand and armes^ of man out of doubt
Like as lucyna / held her course about
And in this wise / were the brether twain
To heaven rapt / as poets feign
After the tempest / ye get no more of me
For in this wise / the greeks in the sea
An end made / and that full ^ewfully
This ernest first / came unhappily
To them echone / as gy^^ynge of their woe
And fynall chance / to the brether i^ woe.
How the Greeks assembled them together for to go to Troy / and distroye it
again for queen Helaynes sake. Capitulo. xv.
But for asmoche / as Dares frigyus
Was in his book / whylom coryous
The form of Troyens / and Greeks to descryue
Like as he saw / this Auctour by his live
The sha^ the form / and complexiowne
Both of the party / of them of Troy town
And of the greeks by good auysement
In time of trewes / among them as he went
Seeing the manner / of their governance
Their port their chere / with every circu^stau^ce
Namely of tho / that were of hye degree
(...) not fogate / one loose nor qualyte
Conditions / and also their stature
^ll to ^escryue / Dares did his cure
(...) grekysshe tunge / beginning at Eleyne
Like as tofore / ye have herd me seyne
(...) her beauty / and her semelynesse
(...) ceryously / Guydo does express
(...) he said / in a little space
A strype there was / end long her face
Which as he write / became her wonder well
Embelysshynge / her beauty euerydele
Like as Dares / makes descripcion
And first he says / how king Agamenon
Was of good shape / and hye of his stature
And mighty in labor / at the best endure
Impatient / to live in quyete
He was to arms / so egall and so mete
Of color white / and good proporcyon
And flematyk / of his complexyon
Discrete and hardy / and wonder virtuous
And of speech / right facundyous
And could him well / in every thing demene
But Menelay / of stature was but mean
Proporcyoned / at wyxte and long
Worthy in arms / deliver and also strong
And of courage / and heart vygorous
Semely also / and aye more desirous
To live in werre / rather than in pes
And ferthermore / to speak of Achilles
He was right fair / and of great semelynesse
With aborne here / crispynge for thyckenesse
With eyes glawke / large ^epe and great
And broad shuldred / with breast full square and mete
To endure in arms / fel^e and courageous
And of his look / wonder amerous
Hye of stature / and large of gifts eke
And more of strength / than any other greek
And to spend / he let little charge
He was of heart / so plenteuous and large
And in the field / passing chyualrous
And for to tell / forth of Tantalus
Or sanguynehewe / having much of reed
Diverse eyed / aye meuynge in his heed
Of huge making / and also of great strength
Well answering / his bread / to his length
Ha^ynge to strive / where he saw no need
^ight true of word / also as I read
And never quarrel / would he take on hand
To sight for / but he might understand
(...) were fully / grounded upon right
And than he would / quyte him like a knight.
Cyleus Ayax / was right corpulent
To be well cladde / he set all his intent
In rich array / he was full curyous
All though he were / of body corsyous
Of arms great / with shulders square and broad
It was of him / almost an horse lode
Hye of stature / and boystous in a pres
And of his speech / rude and recheles
Full many word / in ydell him asterte
And but a cowarde / was he of his heart.
Another / Ayax Thelamonyous
There was also / descrete and virtuous
Wonder fair / and semely to behold
Whose hear was black / and upward ay began fold
In compass wise / round as any spear
(...) of musyke / was there none his pere
Having a voice / full of melodye
Right well entuned / as by armonye
And was ^^^dentyfe / for to counterfete
Instruments / both small and great
In sturdy wise / longing to musyke
And for all this / yet had he great practyke
In arms eke / and was a noble knight
No man more orped / nor hardyer to fight
Nor desirous / for to have victory
Deuoyde of pomp / hatynge all vayneglorye
All ydell laud spent / and blow in vain
Of vlixes / what shall I also said
That was so noble / and worthy in his days
Full of wyles / and sleyghty at assayes
In menynge double / and deceyuable
To forge a lesynge / also wonder able
With face plain / he could make it towghe
Merry worded / and but selde lowghe
In counseylynge / discrete and full prudent
And in his time / the most eloquent
And help to greeks / often in their need
And for to speak / of worthy Dyomede
Fullwell compacte / and grow well in length
Of sturdy port / and famous eke of strength
Large brested / and feers also of syghte
And deceyuable / of what ever he hyghte
Hasty / testyf / to smite reckeles
And medlynge aye / and but selde in pes
To his servants / full inpacyent
And baratous / where that ever he went
For little worth / of disposicyon
And lecherous / of complexyon
And had in love often / sithe his part
Brennynge at heart / of Cupydes darte
And specheles / full often felt sore
What shall I said eke of duke Nestore
Of long stature / and well compact withal
With corbe shuldres / and of myddell small
In hands strong / with arms large and round
In counsaylynge / prudent and wise yfounde
Whose words were / sugared with pleasaunce
Upon his friend / having aye remembrance
For of his truth / he ne could feign
But in anger / he might him not refrain
He was so fret / with melancolye
That no man / might his ire modefye
Albe it last / but a little space
Who could him suffer / anon it would pace
Lightly it came / and lightly went away
And Protheselaus / was fresshe of array
Wonder semely / and of great beauty
I trow a fayrer / no man might se
Of good stature / and deliver and light
No man more swyfte / and to speak of might
Of his making / he was passing strong
Fers of courage / and loathe to take a wrong.
And to tell / of Neptolomous
He was of making / wonder corsyous
Whose here was black / shynynge as does gee^
With eyes round / broad and greet
Large brested / with a rysynge back
And in speech stamerde / when he spacke
But in causes / he could meddle well
And in the law / full deep he did feel
For all his lust / was besette on plees
But for to tell of Pallamydees
King Naulus ^one / withouten any wene
Of face fair / of body long and lene
Of manfull heart / hardy in battle
And desirous / his enemy to assail
Famylyer curteyse / and tretable
In all his deeds and inly worshypable
In gyuynge large / and passing of great same
Of whose bounce / full wide sprange the name
In many land / the storye tells thus
And heart I find / of Polydamus
The worthy greek / was of great thycknesse
Of wom^ ^wolle / enbossed with fatness
That (...) / he might himself sustene
And yet of heart / he was full proud and kene
Right surquedrous / and full of pensyfenesse
And (...) glad so thought did him oppress.
But Machaon / like as write Guydo
Of long and short / was betwyx two
Full proud and ferse / deuoyde of pacyence
And vengeable / who him did offense
And yet he was balde / as a coote
On whose forhede even by the root
The here was fallen / and wasted clean away
And selde or never / he would stepe a day.
And ouermore / to tell of Cryseyde
My pen stombleth / for long or she deyde
My master Chauncer / did his dylygence
To discryue / the great excellence
Of her beauty / and that so maysterlye
To take on me / it were but hye folly
In any wise / to add more thereto
For well I wot / anon as I have do
That I in sothe / no thank deserve may
Because that he / in writing was so gay
And but I write / I must the truth leave
Of Troy book / and my matter breue
And over pass / and not go by and by
As Guydo does in order ceryously
And that I must / do offencion
Thorugh neclygence / or presumpcion
So am I set even / amyddes twain
Great cause have I / and matter to complain
On Antropose / and upon her envy
That brake the threde / and made for to dye
Noble Galfryde / Poet of Brytayne
Among our Euglysshe / yt made first to rain
The golden dew drops / of rethoryke so fine
Our rude langage / oonly to enlumyne
To god I pray / that he his soul have
After whose help of need I must crave
And seek his book / that is left behind
Some goodly word / therein for to find
To set among / the crooked lines rude
Which I do write / as by symylytude
The rubyestant / so royal of renown
Within a ring of coper or latowne
So stant the making / of him douteles
Among our books / of English pereles
They are esye to know / they be so excellent
There is no making / to his equypollent
We do but halte / who so takes head
That meddle of making / without any dread
When we would / his style counterfete
We may alday / our color grynde and beat
Tempre our asour / and vermylyon
But all I hold / but presumpcyon
It follows not / therefore I let be
And first of all / I will excuse me
And proceed / as I have begone
And thorugh his favor / certain if I konne
Of Troy book / for to make an end
And there I left / again I will now wend
Unto Cryseyde / and though to my socour
Of rethoryke / that I have no flour
Nor hewes rich / stones nor perre
For I am bare / of all curyouste
Thorugh crafty speech / to enbroude with her sleue
Yet for all that / now I will not leave
But be as bold / as bayarde is the blind
That cast no peril / what way that he find
Right so will I stomble / forth of head
For uncunning / and take no better head
So as I can / her beauty to discryue
That was in sothe / of all tho a live
One the fairest / this Calchas daughter dear
Thereto of shap / of face and of chere
There might be / no fayrer creature
Ofhye nor low / but mean of stature
Her sonnysshe here / like Phoebus in his spear
Bound in a tresse / bryghter than gold were
Down at her back / low down behind
Which with a threde of gold / she would bind
Full often sithe / of acustomaunce
Thereto she had / so much fuffysaunce
Of kinds work / without any were
And save her brows / joined yfere
No man could / in her alack espyen
And ferthermore / to speak of her eyes
They were so persynge / heavenly and so clear
That an heart / ne might hymsefe stere
Again her shynynge / y^ they ne would wound
Thorugh out a breast / god wot and be younde
Also she was / for all her semelynesse
Full simple and meke / and full of soberness
The best nourysshed eke / that might be
Goodly of speech / fulfilled of pity
Facunoyous / and thereto right tretable
And as says Guydo / in love varyable
Of tender heart / and vnsted fastness
He her accuses / and newfongylnesse.
And after this / Dares does rehearse
Among other / how the king of Perse
Came to greeks / with many worthy knight
To help and further / with all his full might
The which king / was of stature long
And wonder fat / and as he write right strong
Whose berde and here / red as flawme of fire
With eyes stepe / and fervent of desire
To have a do / and stern of chere and look
And often sythes / of sudden ire he quoke
And had wertes / plente in his face
And thus Dares / shortly for to pace
No more of Greeks / writes as I find
But of Troyans / for to make mind
Ceryously / he does his style dress
Them do descryue / as I shall express.
Of the Discripcyon of Pryamus and his sons / and daughters / and how y^
Greeks took land before the Temple of Dyame y^ goddess. Capitulo. xvi.
ANd first he says / how king Pryamus
Was of his chere / benyngne and gracious
Of hye stature / with lymmes sklendre and long
Delytynge much / in musyke and in song
And specially / he was most desirous
To here songs / that were amerous
A semely man / and of great hardynesse
And spoke but low / as books us express
Deuoyde of dread / hatynge flaterye
And all that could / outher gloss or lie
True of his word / and to every wight
He did plainly / equity and right
For no mede / him list not to declyne
And loved erely / on morrow for to dyne
In his time / one of the worthyeste
Of all kings / and he that loved best
Worthy knights / and all that he knew
That manfull were / and of heart true
He could cherysshe no man half so well
With gold and gifts / that they might feel
His great fredome / and larges eke withal
And of his sons / for to reken them all
The first of birth / so as books tell
Was worthy Ector / of knighthod spry^g and well
Flower of manhood / of strength pereles
Sad and discrete / and prudent nevertheless
Crop and root / ground of chyualrye
Of chere demure / and of curtesye
He was example / thereto of soberness
A very myrour / and for his gentylnesse
In his time / the most reno^med
To reken all / and of goodlyhed
The most famous / in peace and werre
Ferthest spoke of / both nygh and far
On each part he was / so virtuous
And to be loved / most gracious
Of brawne and bones / compact by measure
So well brethed / in arms to endure
So well parfourmed / by proporciowne
So qucke so lyfely / and of most renown
So huge made / so well grow on length
So well complet / for to have great strength
That in this world / if I shall not feign
Was never none / that fully might attain
To the prowess / of this worthy knight
To reken his heart / as well as his might
And therwithall / so wise and auysee
The lowlyest eke / of his degree
To rich and pore / and of words few
Unto all / such chere he could show
Of his presence / that glad was every wight
When they at leyser / had of him a sight
He was so benyngne / to them of the town
And to his enemies / like a ferse lyowne
He could him show / when it was to do
And in the field / there might no man so
To reken all / his labor half endure
For the storye / does us plain assure
That he was never / weary in battle
Nor faint in heart / his fomen for to assail
Of all good I find / he was the best
Prowess and virtue / in him were set at rest
So passyngly / that never was nor shall
None bore of mother / to be perygall
To him of manhood / nor of chyualrye
For all he passed / but of books lie
In whom nature / ne was no thing to wit
Save in his tunge / he was let alyte
And as some Auctours / make mention
He was sanguyne / of complexion.
And ferthermore / his brother Dephebus
Like as I find / and also Helenus
Were like Pryam / that sothly of them three
Was hard to espy / any dyuersyte
Of shap or form / or of countenance
Save of age / there was no varyaunce
Their fader old / and they were young and light
And Dephebus / was a worthy knight
And had in arms / fame and excellence
And Helenus / in clergy and science
Was well expert / and took but little head
Of all the werre / knyghthode and manhede.
But Troylus / sothly if I shall descryue
There was of heart / no manlyer a live
Nor more lykly / in arms to endure
Well grown on hyghte / and of good stature
Young fresshe and lusty / hardy as a lyowne
Deliver and strong / as any champyowne
And perygall of manhood / and of deed
He was to any / that I can of read
In derrynge do / this noble worthy wight
For to fulfylle / that longs to a knight
The second Ector / for his worthynesse
He called was / and for his hye prowess
During the werre / he bare him aye so well
Thereto in love / true as any stele
Secre and wise / steadfast of courage
The most goodly / also of vysage
That might be / and benyngne of chere
Without change / and of one heart entere
He was always / faithful just and stable
Perseueraunt / and of will immutable
Upon what thing / he ones set his heart
That doubylnesse / might him not peruerte
In his deeds / he was so hole and plain
But of his foon / the sothe for to said
He was so ferse / they might him not wtstande
When that he held / his blody sword in hand
Unto Greeks / death / and confusion
To them of Troy / shield and proteccion
And his kynghthode / shortly to accounte
There might in ma^hode / no man hy^ surmou^te
Thorugh the world / though men would seek
To reken all / Troyan nouther greek
None so named / of famous hardynesse
As books old / of him bear witness
Except Ector / there ne was such another
And after him / to speak of his brother
I mean Paris / most passing of beauty
That in this world / no man might se
In very sothe / a more semely knight
For as I read / that he by title of right
Of fayrenesse / bare away the flower
With locks yelowe / like gold wyre of color
And in shotynge / move was his delight
Having in hunting / a full great appetyte
And as Dares / lyketh him descryue
The best archer / one thereof a live
And of his hand / was eke a noble knight
A manly man / deliver / and of good might
And in the werre / preued well he was
And as I read / the Troyan Eneas
As mine Auctor / lysteth to endyte
Was well brested / and of body lyte
And bare in Troy / wonder great estate
And in his works / discrete and temperate
And had a fame / of passing eloquence
Wise of counsel / and of great sapyence
Most reno^med / also of lecture
Delytynge much / of books and scripture
And ever glad / both of port and chere
Stern of his look / with persynge eyes clear
And among all / dwelling in the town
To speak of goods / and possessiowne
Of Castelles and toures / great plente
I find sothly / that none in that Cite
Nemyght attain / unto his richesse
And had also / for all his worthynesse
Of gold and mebles / passing great tresor
And his fellow / hight dan^ Anthenor
Was sklendre and long / and of great dalyaunce
And circumspect / in all his governance
Well beloved also / of Pryamus
And of words / wonder copyous
Resownynge aye / into myrthe and play
And he was Iapynge / all the long day
Among his feres / and in company
So dryely / that no man might efpye
So sobre he was / in his countenaune
That every wight / had great pleasaunce
To here him talk / when that he was glad
And albe it / that he of port was sad
Yet all his speech / full of bourdes was
And his sone / called Pollydamas
Was like his fader / of stature and of make
Ythewed well / that there was no lake
In his person / gentle and right true
Wonder strong / and pale also of hew
And to Ire / stered suddenly
Albe in words / he kept him covertly
But all his here / pass would anon
And to tell / of king Meryone
Large brested / and of his making all
The best compacte / and the molle talle
Of shap and form / that men could find
And so well performed / up by kind
That none was like / to him nigh ne feere
His locks yelowe / and crispyng was his here
Stylle of his port / and gentle with to play
And inly strong / maystryes for to assaye
Wonder curteyse / and to no wight dispytous
And wroughte in arms / deeds meruaylous
As in this book / hereafter shall be seen
Now after him / to Eccuba the queen
Like the storye / my style I must enclyne
Whose lymmes / all did more declyne
To shappe of man / than to woman head
As says Guydo / but in work and deed
She was in sothe / the most womanly
The best aduysed / and most prudently
In her deeds / could her self govern
That man's wit / might not discern
To find a better / douteles than she
So true example / of femynyte
She was in sothe / and to every wyghte
Benyngne of prote / and gracyous of syghte
To pore also / pytous and mercyable
And unto nedy / wonder cheritable.
The wife of Ector / her daughter in law
After her lore / much did draw
Andronomecha / the faithful true wife
So good so just / the which in all her life
In honest / did her most delight
Long of her shap / with breasts fair and white
With rody chekes / ennewed by measure
With persynge eyes / of aungelyke figure
Like gold her tresses / and rosen lyppes read
Ylyche fresshe / of color no thing deed
Thereto she was / of chere the goodlyeste
To rich and pore / and spoke always the best
Of every wight / aye helping y^ she might
That no man triste / went out of her sight
And over this / every gentylman
She further would / in all that ever she can
And gladly ever / did her dylygence
To get grace / to them that did offense
This was her usage / and condycion
She was so full / of compassion
That women all / might of her lere
And Cassandra / her own daughter dear
Was of stature / wonder womanly
Of color white / and therewith right semely
Save in her face / in sundry places were
Many wertes / growing here and there
And all her joy / and felycyte
Was to keep / her virgynyte
In freelte / that women have of kind
Thorugh virtue moral / she put out of mind
Of all folly / fleing occasion
And aye in stody / and contemplacion
Of sundry books / she would her occupye
And specially / of Astronomye.
Of prophecye / a spirit had she
And some men say / she was one of the three
Of women / that Cebylebare the name
Of whom y^ renown / floureth and the fame
Unto this day / and is as yet full grene
And for to tell / of young Polycene
And discryue her beat / up and down
It were in sothe / a presumpciowne
To take on me / now so great a thing
To clymbe so hye / and pass my conning
Sithe nature / in forgynge of this maid
Her conning / all utterly assayde
To make her fair / above each creature
And said proudely / se how I nature
When that me list / enbellysshe can my work
Like as Phoebus / among the clouds derke
Is passing clear / so in comparyson
I can my work / and operacion
Right as me list / adourne and make fair
So paynte and florisshe / it shall not appayre
And my colors / so craftily dispose
Of the lylye / and of the fresshe rose
And so ennewe / that they shall not fade
But aye be one / and in this wise I made
My dear daughter / ye know whom I mean
The young fresshe / fair Polycene
A skaunce / that none can this craft but I
Thus in her work / bosted utterly
Nature her self / when she this may wrought
As she that fully / in her heart thought
Above all other / to make her excelle
And of the beauty / to be the very well
And there withal / in shap nor in stature
Ne was no lack / I dare you well assure
And god above / gave her soueraynte
In all thewes / and woldeshe should be
Crop and root / and named of womanhede
With fulsomnesse / of all goodlyhede
So passyngly / that it were ydelnesse
Me to presume / by and by to express
Her beauty all / it were a vain travail
For well I wot / mine english would fail
In such matter / to talk felyngely
Who ever it can / certain it am not I
Therefore I pass / and straight now will I go
To my matter / for Dares of no mo
In all his book / makes menciowne
Of them of greece / nor of Troy town
In special he put / no mo in mind
Than ye have herd / save as ye shall find
In this storye / when it comes thereto
Of their knyghthode / and who that best has do
Lasting the sege / the manner euerydell
And right anon / to sharp my poyntell
I will me dress / this storye to entreat
Of all the werre / to tell you the great.
THe time nygheth / after this as yore
That breme winter / with his frostes hoar
Began to aswage / of his bitter cold
When Apollo passed was the hold
Of the sign / that we call Aquarye
And in the fysshe / fer in Februarye
Yronne was / toward the Aryete
And that season / with his faynte hete
On hills hye / began his bemes smite
Making the snow / with fair flakes white
Into water / kyndely relente
Which from above / to the valey went
That never flodes / of the sudden thowe
The grene mede / began to over flow
And the y^se / began stoundemele destylle
Down fro the hylle / the brokes for to fylle
With fomy stremes / of the wawes small
By broke banks / as they did auale
When lusty vere / with his young grene
I recomforted / by the son shene
Which little and little / his hewes aye amendeth
Up in his spear / as Titan up ascends
When March approaches / and branches ouerall
Began blow out / and equynoccyall
Of veer is hallowed / the season Amerous
When the greeks / proud and courageous
With hole the flower / of the cheualrye
Assembled were / and holy their nauye
In the haven / that was most of fame
And of Athenes / that time bare the name
Ygadred was / by assent echone
Toward Troy / to sail and to gone
So great a nombre / y^ sith the world began
Is not remembered / of no manner man
That together / in one company
Was mecyfere / so passing a nauye
Of manly men / who so list take heed
In this storye / as ye shall after read
And by and by / to make description
Mine Auctor tells / how Agamenon
The worthy king / a hundred ships brought
With worthy knights / stuffed as them ought
And Menelaus / on whom lay most ye charge
Has with him brought / syxty ships large.
Out of his land / that called is Sperten
And from boece / full of manly men
Came fyfty ships / the story tells thus
With Prothenor / and with Archelaus
And from the land / called Sycomenye
Came syxty ships / in the company
Of the Duke / that hight Achalapus
With whom was eke / full fresshe and desirous
Helymux / the Earl / the worthy knight
And fyfty ships / enarmed for to fight
With him brought / the king Epistrophus
Oonly with help / of king Cedyus
And Thelamon / whom Ayax some call
Full renowned / for to reken all
Has fyfty ships / brought to this Iournee
From solemyne / his royal chief Cytee
With Earls / dukes / and many worthy knight
Eueryche of them / in steel armed bright.
And duke Tenter / with Amphiacus

In this viage / came with Thelamowne
And old Nestor / cruel of heart and thought

And eke the king / that hight also Thoas
Brought with them / in their company
An hundred ships / knyghtly forto guye.
And Thelamon / ycalled Cylleus
That was in arms / fell and despytous
With him brought / from his land so far
Six and thyrty ships / for the werre.
Amphymacus / and king Polybete
Thyrty ships / brought to the flete
From Calcedoyne / and Meryon the king
With ydinneus / had in their ledynge
Four score ships / with them out of Crete
And vlixes / with greeks did mete
With fyfty ships / stuffed out of Trace
Toward Troy / proudely for to pace.
Duke Melleus / full of manly men
Brought eke with him / great ships ten.
And moreover / the duke Perhotacus
And the duke named / Prothesylaus
To the haven / that called was Athene
Brought fyfty ships / enarmed bright and shene
From Phylyarcha / the strong mighty Isle
And Methaon / as Guydo does compyle
With his brother / Polydris also
From their country / Trycionyco
Brought two and twenty ships / as I find
And from Phyces / as it is made mind
With Achilles / came fyfty full by nombre
And from rodon / Troyans to encombre
Came twenty ships / with king Thelapolus
And with the duke / that hight Antipus
Out of the land / that Hesyda men call
Of which the folk / be nyghe cherles all

In nombre came ships / eke elleuen
And with them was / of name full famous

And Polybethes / the strong mighty king
Fyfty ships / brought at his coming
Out of Richa / the noble regyowne
And with this king / full worthy of renown

And as I find / the noble Dyomede
Of ships great / I speak of no small barge
Has with him brought / fro Calydonye and Arge
Four score in nombre / sothly this no tale
And Thelemus / and mighty Euryale
Two manly men / and in arms lage

A great prouynce / of which king was he.
Trearyus of Beysa / lord and king
Brought two and twenty / also in his coming
And finally / if I shall not lie
Full many ship / was in this nauye
Mo than Guydo / makes rehersayle
Toward Troy / with greeks for to sail
For as Omer / in his descripcion
Of greeks ships / makes mention
Shortly affermynge / y^ man was never borne
That such a nombre / of ships saw toforne
Counted the ships / that Palamydes
Brought with him / their nombre to encrese
That when these lords / aforesaid euerychone
Kings / dukes / and earls all in one
Assembled were / without any wene
Before the haven / that called is Athene.
THe famous king / great Agamenown
So wise so worthy / and of so hye renown
As he that was / Prince and gouernoure
Of greeks host / anon did his labor
His besy cure / and waker dylygence
By hye advise / and inward prouydence
To deliver / wisely in this need
What were to do / or that he proceed
In this matere / casting up and down
And reuoluynge / of hye discreciowne
That he may so begin / that the end
Conclude well / that wylfulnesse ne shende
Holy their purpose / thorugh no rakelnesse
Ne thorugh none haste / without auysenesse
So that they may / before so wisely se
That finally / in felycyte
They may acco^plisshe / their purpose i^ certain
And so this king / upon a large plain
Out of the Cite / but little fro the stronde
With his lords / will for no thing wonde
To have a counsel / this wise Agamenon
Making anon / a conuocacyon
Of such as were / most great inspecyall
He sitting first / in his see royal
And his lords / eueryche in his see
Like as they were / of hye or low degree
And all Tumulte / stynted and scylence
Was thorugh y^ prees / to give him audyence
Than he anon / in full sobre wise
Began his tale / as I shall deuyse.
SYres quod he / I pray you take heed
That be so noble / and so renowmede
Both of wisdom / and of worthynesse
Of manhood eke / and of hye prowess
That of knyghthode / the report and the fame
Thorugh out y^ world / rebou^deth to yo^ name
For douteles / the flower of Chyualrye
Men may now find / in this company
For whosawe ever / of manly men yfere
Together met / as there be now here
So young so fresshe / so couragyous also
So well besene / for to have a do
Orso lykely / sithe the world began
Without raskayle / so many knyghtly man
Of kings / dukes / and many another lord
As be now here / of will and one accord
And of one heart / assembled in this place
That if fortune / and gods of their grace
Be not behind / our Journey to repreue
We may not fail / our purpose to acheue.
For I deem him / plainly in arage
Or wer^e than wood / that durst this vyage
In any wise perturbe / or presume
To take again us / outher to assume
By might on him / of malys to excyte
Our worthynesse / were it never so lyte
Us to provoke to Ire / or do offense
That we ne should / by mortal recompense
Aquyte his mede / as it lies in our might
That have among us / so many worthy knight
Among which / an hundred and yet mo
I could chese / able for to go
By manly force / and knyghtly suffysaunce
To take on him / for to do vengaunce
Upon Troyans / by himself alone
For which that we / be gadred now echone
That with his men / were suffycyent
To execute the su^me / of his intent
And it accomplysshe / in felycyte
The cause I mean / for which that all we
Assembled be / both hye and low
And with all this / to you is not unknow
How shamefully / Troyans have us grieved
Provoked us / and wylfully ymeued
To rise again them / to have recure of right
Of wrongs done / with all our force and might
Wherefore let us / by one assente and will
Set to have / as it is right and skyll
Redress to find / of that we now complain
And of one heart / do our besy pain
Upon Troyans / a werre for to make
And I suppose / we shall them so awake
That they shall learn / or we thense wend
To remember / to the worlds end
How they hereafter / shall dare take an hand
For to presume / in greece more to land
Or to be bold / while they have life or space
Again Greeks / more to trespace
For whose offense / as who says do but late
Within our heart / with so brennynge hate
The fervent hete / and the gredy Ire
Fro day to day / so sets us a fire
That it renews / the constreynt of our pain
So inwardely / if I shall not feign
We must of reason / of so hye greuaunce
Our self enforce / for to do vengaunce
As right requereth / and our just sorrow
Compels us / both eve and morrow
On Troyans / our harms to bewreke
And for to stop / tunges that so speak
To our reprefe / and to our vylenye
We must attones / shape remedy
That our foon / hensforthe may dread
For to do worse to us / as god forbede
In time coming / if thorugh our pacyence
We lykely suffer / their importable offense
To pass forth / and take of it nohede
Sith never yet of Greeks could I read
That any man / did reprefe to their name
That justly might / rebounde to their shame
Withouten this / that they it quyte again
Thorugh their manhood / so openly and plain
That no man might / of them seyne or this
In any wise / or report amys.
New shall not / dissymule in this case
With chere oppressed / nor with dredefull face
To let slide / or lightly over go
The great offenses / that were so late do
Which would turn / unto us and ours
To great reprefe / and to our successoures
In time coming / and shamefully bespoke
How that greeks / vurste not be wroke
Upon their foon / the which may not be
I you ensure / sithe that all we
Be of one will / to refourme our wrong
And therwithall / so mighty and so strong
That who is he / that could in bread and length
A right rehearse / our power and our strenthe
Or who durst ever / our worthynesse assail
That he ne should / without any fail
Repent in heart / or at the end rewe
Save Troyans / this other day of new
Of wylfulnesse / in a folly rage
Into our land / made a vyage
Unware of us / and with their pray home went
The which they shall / full hastily repent
For their trespass / and great offencyowne
For all the world knows / up and down
But late a gone / how Greeks but a few
Upon Troyans / their power did show
And slew their king / called Lamedowne
Fader to Pryam / now king of that town
And fordyde toures / and Cite
And slew up / all the comynalte
From Greeks sword / whom yt them list spare
That among us / in seruytude and care
Compain their harm / yt may not be recured
Than how may they / stand full assured
Again us all / to hold chaumpartye
That have so worthy / in our company
For it is lykely / a thousand to acheue
That four or five / so lightly might preue
And yet one thing / afferme well I dare
Of our coming / Troyans are well ware
And do their labor / and their dilygence
Against us / to make resystence
With all their might / I know it out of doubt
And gadre friends / in countres all about
To help them and strength them / in theyrnede
Us to withstand / if they might speed.
But finally / one thing I counsel
From this haven / or we ferther sail
That we may be / the more fortunat
Of one assent / to make ambassyat
And prudently / or we further wend
Into Delos / in all haste that we send
Which is an I Will / a little here beside
More discretely / our journey to provide
That we may have / the better hap and grace
Of Appollo / Patron of this place
To have of him / if that we may speed
Fynall answer / in this great need
Of our expleyt / how that it shall fall
If it so be / ye will assent all
To this counsel / the most and eke the least
And they echone / thought for the best
To condescende / to this conclusyon
Without any / contradiccyon
And all attones / without any dread
They praise his counsel / and his wise read
And thereupon / discretely as they ought
As says this story / even thus they wroughte.
How the Greeks sent Achylles / and Pyrro des into the isle of Delos for to
have answer of the god Appollo / how they should speed in their Journey.
Capitulo. xvij.
AFter the time / that Agamenon
Concluded has / fully his reason
As ye have herd / and his sentence fined
The Greeks be of heart / full enclyned
And with one voice / accorded plainly thus
That Achylles / and also Pirrodus
For common profit / sithe they were sage
Shall take on them / the charge of this message
To Appollo / for answer for to gone
And to ship / they them haste anon
And sail forth / by the large see
Toward Deluos / and in prosperytee
They be aryued / and ycome to land
The which isle / as I understand
And as mine Auctor / says without les
Has his sight / among Cyclades
Where men with rocks have so much ado
Amyd the sec / called Helespontico
Of which isle / to make description
I must a while / make disgressyon
Fro my matter / as mine Auctor does
For in this isle / Isydorus in soth
Reherseth plainly / how Latona the queen
Appollo first / and Dyane the shene
I childed has by Iubyter her lord
When he and Juno / were at discord
As write Ouyde / for alytell while
And so befylle / in this little Isle
There was a Temple / whylom dedycate
Unto Appollo / and also consecrate
In his worship / of old foundacyon
That was honored / by great devotion
Because Appollo / with his bemes clear
After the flood / first there did appear
To showed his horns / rather there and soon
And Dyane eke / that called is the moon
Of which showing / this isle bears the name
Into this day / that is of so great fame
Oonly be apperynge / of this ylke twain
For Delos / is in greek / no more to said
Than a showing / or an appearance
And thus began / the great reverence
To Appollo first / and the honor eke
To him Idone / of so many greek
And to his suster / that called is Dyane
The pale moon / that can so wax and wane
And called is / of Paynems a goddess
That whylom was / in wod an hunteresse
And this lady / with the son her brother
Of this isle has lordshyp / and none other
Oonly for they / at their natyuyte
Showed their light / first in that country
The which isle / Greeks also call
Ortygya / in their langage all
Because Curlewes / were there first Iseyne
For Otygyas / is no more to seyne
Than a Curlewe / in Grew I understand
For they were first / engendered in that land.
And Appollo / is called eke Titan
That in his time / so much worship wan
Long before / or he was made a sterre
With Iubyter / when that he held werre
And he also / ycalled is Phoebus
And of some / ynamed Phycius
For of Pheton / he had the victory
When he him stewe / to his increase of glory
The great serpent / here in earth low
With his arowes / and his mighty bow
Of which conqueste / the great god Cupyde
Had envy / and even thorugh the side
He wounded him / deep to the heart
With y^ arowe of gold / yt made him sore smerte
And of Pheton / that Phoebus made fine
Came Phetonysses / that can so deuyne
I mean women / that be deuyneresses
Thorugh deed men / these false sorceresses
As one / whylom raised Samuel
For love of Saul / the bible can you tell
And in his temple / large long and old
There was a stature / all of pured gold
Full great and hye / and of huge weyghte
And therein was / thorugh the deuylles sleyghte
A spirit unclean / by false illusyon
That gave answer / to every questyon
Not the Ydoll / dombe as stock or stone
And thus the people / deceived euerychone
Were by the fend / brought in great error
To do worship / and such false honor
With sacryfyce / and cursed mawmentrye
And in this wise / began Ydolatrye
As in this place / to tell I me cast
And how long / it abode and last
Compendyously / I purpose to descryue
Gynnynge and end / as ye shall here blyue
Without any / Ambygnyte
For at the birth / and natyuyte
Of criste Ihesu / at the Incarnacy own
All the Ydolles / braste and fell a down
And vanysshed / and were brought to naught
When herodes / the blesfull child sought
Thorugh his malys / and cruelte horrible
As holy writ records / and the bible
For which pursuyte / and persecucion
There did apere / by auysion
An holy angel / to Joseph as he sleep
And bad him rise / and also take keep
Unto the child / and also to marye
And go his way / or Herod him aspye
Into Egypt / the great regyon
Like as the Gospel / makes mencyon
And right anon / as he came to that land
There was none Ydoll / yt upright might stand
But to shyuered / unto pieces small
This holy writ / plainly and no tale
And was recorded / friste of Isaye
How that our lord / on an esy skaye
Ascend should / and hold forth his weye
Toward Egypt / and therewith should deye
All mawmetrye / and no longer dwell
But as the Jews / record of Ysmaelle
That he was first / that mawmetrye fond
And made of claye / an Ydoll with his hand
And as Paynems / write and tell us
That alder first / was Promotheus
That found Ydolles / shortly to conclude
For symulacrum / comes of symylitude
That is no thing / plainly but lyknesse
Made after man / his image to express
Unto which / paynems in their gyse
With false honor / and cursed sacryfyse
Begone first this ryte / for dread of man
And some say / how Belus first began
Such false worship / and such mawmettye
In their books / as clerks specefye.
That of assirye / was lord and governor
After whose death / his sone in his honor.
That Nynus hyghte / an image did make
To be worshypped / oonly for his sake
All of brent gold / by false affeccion
And set it up / for consolacion
And for a mind / and a memoryall
Unto the which / with heart will and all
Of ignorance / and of flesshely love
He did honor / as to god above
In his temples / most of excellence
And made his people / to do reverence
And said in heaven / he was deyfyed
That of no man / durst be denied
Till after soon / but a little while
A wicked spyryte / folks to begyle
In this ydoll / entrede to abide
And gave answer / upon every side
To the people / of what them list demand
And they again / what he will command
Obey fully / the folk of all Assyrye
Which unto god / did great iniurye
Making the people / in such error fall
And some Belus / and some Bell him call
And some Balym / and some Belphegore
And fell in error / always more and more
And Beelzebub / he named was also
Which name is made / of words two
Of bell and zebub / that thus signefye
For bell is god / and zebub is a fly
Than Beelzebub / togydre specyfyes
Joined in one / the great god of flies
And of this feigned / false ydolatrye
Began all the world / worship mawmetrye
For some Saturn / god of gods all
Began in their error / falsely for to call
That was whylom / the myghtykyng of Crete
And gave him name / after the planete
That in heaven / has so large a spear
And as Poets / in their fables lere
That he before / thorugh his sapyence
Saw / in his dyuyne prouydence
How a sone / should of him descend
And of Juno / the gods / as he wend
That should hy^ plainly / fro his reign expelle
And suffer him / no longer for to dwell
In his kingdom / when he came to age
Whereof Saturn / fill in such arage
That he will shape / remedy therefore
Bidding his wife / when y^ child were bore
That she to him / should it bring anon
Instead whereof to him she brought a stone
To save her child / she did her business
And this Saturn / thorugh his gredynesse
The stone deuoureth / in his melancolye
And thus Saturn / but if books lie
Had sons three / a daughter and no mo
Iubyter Neptunus / and Pluto
But Iubyter grettest / was of the name
Most renowned / and worthyest of fame
Among Paynems / as it is veryfyed
For they so hye / have him magnefyed
That they him call / god of fire and air
Nert to Saturn / borne for to be heir
And nert to him / in books as I read
Is god of battle / mighty Mars the read
And next Appollo / so clear / so shene and bright
The days eye / and voyder of the night
Cheryssher of fruit / herb / flower and corn
The which god / like as is said toforne
In Delos / is worshypped / and honored
And after venus / that often has socoured
Many lover / the fair lusty queen
And them aledge / of their wounds grene
That first was hurt with her fiery bronde
As she that is goddess / of many land
And all the world / has in her demeyne
Fast enbraced / in her fiery cheyne
I mean the lady that called is venus
And next in order / is Mercurius
That in speech / has most excellence
Of rethoryke / and sugared eloquence
Of musyke / song and Armonye
He has lordshyp / and hole the regalye
Next the Moon / that wexe can and wane
Called Lucyna / and also eke Dyane
That in Delos / has her mancyon
Like as tofore / is maked mencyon
Now full of might / now horned pale is she
Lady of change / and mutabylyte
That selde in one / halte her any time
And so fare they / that be borne in her clyme
That aye delight / in things that be new
Whose heart is cladde / in many sundry hew
So they be diverse / in their affeccyons
And in this wise / in sundry regyons
Of mawmetrye / is in the venym run
Like as clerks / well deuyse konne
For as I find / the Maurycyens
Worship Iulam / and Egipcyens
Honor y^ sis / after their konnynge
Whylom daughter / of ynachus the king
That taught the^ / first their lord to ere and sow
And also letters / for to read and know
And in lecture / to set their business
For which thing / they call her a goddess
And Iubyter / honored is in Crete
Where he whylom / held his sovereign sete
And on them leyde / many diverse charge
With egles beten / in his baner large
And he was lord / of air land and see
His royal kingdom / deuydynge into three
In the highest / himself does contune
And hole in the sea / he gave unto Neptune
And last the earth / to hold his see royal
He gave to Pluto / that god is infernal
And alder last / when he was stellyfyed
This Iubyter / was most magnyfyed
Of them of Crete / about over all
To whom they made / for a memoryall
A large tomb / and a statue a lofte
And him honored / in their rytes often
With encens / and other sacryfyse
And of this matter / ferther to deuyse
The larynes / with besy dylygence
In their rytes / did reverence
To the gods / if it be credyble
y^ called fawny / that be muysyble
And have hered wellynge / in the wodes grene
Albe that men / their figure may not seen.
And of Romans / further to deuyne
They most i^ honor / have their god quyryne
The which whylom / as books tell us
Among them / was called Romulus
That bylte first / the walls of the town
And from an herd / he came to such renown
Thorugh his manhood / and his worthynesse
The spear of whom / as books said express
As he the head / pytched in the ground
It began anon / like as it is found
To florysshe and flower / and budde by miracle
And of nature / had none obstacle
To wexe grene / with fresshe blomes new
And for the manhood / that men in him knew
For his knyghthode / and his great fame
The worthy knights / of Romebare ye name
After him / and were Quyryte called
Hye in heaven / when that he was stalled
Among the gods / and ydeyfyed
And thus Romeyns / have him glorified
As for their god / and with gold and great expenses
And as I read / the Athenyenses
Of hole heart / chosen for to serve
To the goddess / that called is Mynerue
And Pallas eke / with her cristall shield
That with Neptunus / even amyd the field
Held champartye / with women on their side
And he with men / full surquedous in pride
Defends him / for gyuynge of the name
Of Athenes / a Cite most of fame
This is to said / whether he or she
Should of right / name the Cite
Till it befell / as they began strive
Suddenly there sprange / a fair Olyue
For Pallas / part / grene and fair blossomynge
And there again / a well began to spring
For him Pluto / with water large and deep
Of which thing / Appollo took good keep
Which in his dome / was not reckeles
And for the Olyue / tokeneth love and pes
Water trouble / contek werre and stry fe
He gave sentence / anon diffynytyfe
How Pallas / should / that called is Mynerue
The palm plainly / of this strive discerue.
And she anon / gave name to the town
And called it / by hye discrecyowne
Athenes / the which in speeyall
Is to said / a Cite inmortall
For wyldome first there began to flower
And for this skyll / this Cite did honor
Mighty Pallas / goddess of science
And her aye most had / in reverence.
And they of Paue / in all their regyon
Whorshyp most / the queen of Cytheron
I mean venus / full of doubylnesse
Of whom before / somewhat I did express
And in her temple / full solempnely
They set her highest / and most rychely
With gold and asure / her statue they do paynte
And other colors / that may never faynte
And set her up / in the highest see
Of all the temple / that all men may se
And she stant naked / in a wawy see
About her / with goddesses three
That be assigned / with besy attendaunce
To awayte on her / and do her obseruaunce
And flowers fresshe / blewe / read / and white
Be her about / the more for to delight
And on her head / she has a chapelet
Of roses read / full pleasauntly yset
And from the head / down unto her foot
With sundry go^mes / and oyntemeres sore
She is ennoynte / swetter for to smelle
And enuyron / as Poets tell
By dowues white / flyenge / and eke sparowes
And beside Cupyde / with his arowes
Her blind sone / for to hurt and dear
And loses often / and smite / he wot not where
As he must needs / because he is blind
And thus honored / and most had in mind
Among this people / is venus the goddess
And Naxyens / do their business
To serve Bachus / the mighty god of wine
Whose lycour is / most precious and fine
To recomforte hertes / and to glade
And to refresshe / hewes that be fade
In faces pale / and makes wits sharp
Loses tunges / and make them loud to carpe
And causes / them to walk at lyberte
And to discure thing / that was secree
Without advise / or discrecyon
For where / as wine has domynacyon
No secretnesse may / be kept in mewe
And some of them / that Bachus serve and sewe
Among to him / have such devotion
That they some while / are void of all reason
Hasty and wood / and without all dread
And some also / so toty in their head
That they are void / of power and of might
And have no foot / for to stand up right
And yet they be / as Iargaunt as a pie
Pale chered with a glasy eye
Full of reason / till his wind be spent
For man or woman / that is vyolent
Is verily a be / unreasonable
And to my dome / I hold them eke unable
To be accepted / in any company
When that their tunge / wadeth on the lie
That they ne may / bring forth a word
And thus Bachus / the strong mighty lord
For often causes / folks for to err
To debate / and to make werre
Of hastynesse / where as is no need
Wherefore it is / wisdom / that men dread
His sleyghty werkynge / or they fall in y^ snare
And feeble brains / by mesure for to spare
Or they unawarely / arested be and take
And or Bachus / make them for to shake
In a fever / worse than tercyen
If it of custom / be cotydyen
Alterat with Bachus / mighty Ious
And affered / of tournynge of the house
And fordreynt / on the dry land
When he has lost / both foot and hand
And with a straw / plays like an ape
And deuoutely / gynneth for to gape
And ^oddeth often / with his Iowsy head
As he had on / an heavy cappe of led
And who that be of this condycyon
He enter may / the relygyon
Of mighty Bachus / for habylyte
The which lord / has the soueraynte
Both of honey / and of milk thereto
And of bawme / that is so rich also
And lordshyp has / of hye power deuyne
Both of grapes / and of every vine
To give them nourysshynge / by his influence
Of whom the honor / and the reverence
Is raised most / as I understand
Among vynters / in every manner land
Because he is / to them so gracyous
And they of lymme / worship vulcanus
The god of fire / Iubyters smythe
The which forgeth / on his black slythe
The great thonder / hydous and horrible
And the leuenes / that whylom be vysyble
Into the west / out of the oryent
And gasteth us / with his dredefull dent
This smotry smythe / this swarte vulcanus
That whylom in heart / was so Ialous
Toward venus / that was his wedded wife
Whereof there rose / a dedely mortal strife
When he with Mars / began her first espy
Of hye malys / and cruel false envy
Thorugh y^ shyny^ge / of Phoebus bemes bright
Lyenge a bed / with Mars her own knight
For which in heart / he burnt as any glede
Making the sclaundre / all a broad to sprede
And began thereon / falsely for to muse
As god forbede / that any man accuse
For ^o little / any woman ever
Where love is let / hard is to disseuer
For though they do / such thing of gentyllesse
Pass over lightly / and bear none heaviness
Lest that thou be / to women odyous
And yet this smythe / this false vulcanus
All be that he / had them thus espied
Among Paynems / yet was he deyfyed
And for that he / so falsely them a woke
I have him set / last of all my book
Among to goddess / of false mawmetrye
And in this wise / began ydolatrye
As ye have herd / thorugh oppynyons
Of people errynge / in their affeccyons
That all is false / who the truth cerche
For by techynge / of all holy church
The holy doctrine / and tradycyons
We shall despise / such oppyons
Which of the fend / were found not oflate
For when aungelles / in heaven were create
He that of all / had prelacye
Of whom the prophet / called ysaye
Writes right thus / how the cedres grene
Of paradyse were not / so fair to seen
Planys nor fyr / in heyghte sothe to said
To his highness / might not attain
Nor all the trees / so delycyous
Of Paradyse / were natso precious
Nouther in sight / nor in semelynesse
To be egall to him / in fayrenesse
But thorugh his pride / and his surquydrye
When he said / to god that sytte so his
He will be like / and also set his see
Hye in the north / passing his degree
He was cast down / with all his relygyons
From the fair / heavenly mansyons
All sodaynely / into the pytte of hell
Perpetuelly / there for to dwell
Of whom was said / when he fylle so far
How fylle thou so / O thou morrow sterre
From the mids / of the stones bright
That be so persynge / and fiery of their light
That whylom were / for thy great bryghtnesse
Called Lucyfer / of whom criste says express
In his gospel / how he saw fro heuene
Satan descend / like the fiery leuene
The old serpent / that is solowe fall
Whom heebre^ / in their tunge call.
Bemoth / that does in latin plain express
A be rude / full of cursednesse
The vile serpent / he leuyathan
Whom Isydre / well descryue can
Which of kind / is never conuersaunte
In wells trouble / and has most his haunte
Among watres / in the large see
Of whom says Dauyd / like as ye may se
In the Sauter / making mencyon
Of the snake / the monstrous dragon
Full of venym / and of hard grace
Which in the sea / large and great of space
With foul adders / has his mansyon
Unto mankind / to do illusyon
Whom whylom saw / ye holy monk Bra^dan
As he sailed / by the Occyan
Through and de^ecte / in apytte horrible
More foul and hydous / than it is credyble
There to abide / this tortuous serpent
Unto the day / plainly of Judgment
That of malys / enuyed so mankind
Which with his gynnes / and sleyghtes as I find
Came to our faders / first in paradyse
And to deceive / the bet at his deuyse
More covertly / this worm in his passage
Took of a serpent / the lyknesse and image
That is of chere / of look and countenance
Like a maid / and has resemblaunce
Of a woman / as records Bid
In his deceytes / rather for to speed
I mean the oonly / and not else
For behind / so as clerks tells
Like a serpent / of womb / back and tail
He was / when he began him to assail
And toward Eve / when he began to glyde
He first enquereth / as he her roke a lyde
Why god forbade them / eten of the tree
Which if they ete / sothly should be
Like to gods / knowing good and ill
And right forthwith as they began sulfyll
The fendes heste / their eyes were unclosed
And for their gylte / sodaynely deposed
From Paradyse / into wretchydnesse
To live in labor / sorrow and distress
And thus the fend / first when that hetoke
Form of a snake / and a woman's look
And made the tunge / in her head to meue
By false engyne / mankind for to grieve
So as he does in them / that be trauayled
With wicked spirits / vaxed and assailed
To meue he tunges / falsely out to break
Into blasphemye / what thing y^ they speak
The same serpent / he leuyathan
Contunynge aye / falsely as he began
In cursed yools / dombe* v^fe* and blind
Full often speaks / be spirits as I find
Which are but fendes / David write certain
The gods all / whom folks so in vain
Honor with rytes / supersticious
As whylom was / Appollo Delphicus
Like as tofore / ye have herd deuyse
Which as for now / ought Enough suffyse
And as I trow / the very cause why
That mine Auctor / reherseth by and by
Ground and gynnynge / of Idolatrye
This the cause / for ought I can espy
For that he saw / the matter was not know
I lyche well / both to hye and low
Perauenture / you to do plesaunce
He has the ground / put in remembrance
Of false gods / and of mawmetrye
And most for them / that can no poysye,
ANd to y^ storye / resorteth soon again
How achilles / as ye have herd me say
And Pirrodus / have the way ynome
To the temple and thither be ycome
To have answer / of their embassatrye
Of great Appollo / which may not lie
Of the prestes / they have their counsel take
In the temple / to pray and to wake
Till they may find / unto their intent
To have answer / at hour conuenyent
To their purpose / and leyser opportune
And of one heart / so long they contune
In prayenge fasting / and oblacyons
With sacrifyse and sundry orysons
Tofore the god / awaytynge always fast
Till he to them / answered at last
With (...) voice / and said Achilles twye
Home to Greeks / fast that thou the hye
From whom thou were / hyder to me sent
And say them sothely / the su^me of their intent
Shall Be fulfilled / without words mo
And how that they shall / to Troy go
And there abide / many strong battle
But at the last / without any fail
At ten year day / they win shall the town
And bring it plainly / to destrucciowne
Wall and toures / shall fall to ruin
And with all this / their purpose for to fine
King Pryamus / and Ecuba his wife
And their sons / in this mortal strife
Shall there be slain / brother after brother
This is the fine / for it may be none other
For there shall none / escape in the place
But such as Greeks / lyketh unto grace
Of very routhe / and of mercy take
This all and some / and thus an end I make.
OF which answer / Achilles glad and light
Was in his heart / and with all his might
Thanketh Appollo / of this blesfull eure
And sodaynely / of sort or adventure
The self time / befyll a wonder thing
For out of Troy / fro Pryamus the king
Was sent a bishop / for the same cas
To have answer / whose name was Calcas
And he came in sool / without pres
The same hour / while that Achilles
Was there present / a man of great science
I mean Calcas / and had experyence
Specially / of calculacion
Of sort also / and dyuynacion
And learned was / in astronomye
And when that he his time did espy
To have answer / most conuenyent
Of Appollo / like to his intent
As tofore / maked is memory
He entered is in the oratorye
Doing his rytes / and his obseruaunces
Like the custom / with the circumstaunces
And besely began / to knele and pray
And his things / deuoutely for to say
And to the god / cry and call full strong
And for Appollo / would not prolonge
Sodaynely his answer / began attame
And said Calcas / twyes by his name
Be right well ware / thou ne turn again
To Troy town / for that were but in vain
For finally / learn this of me
In short time / it shall destroyed be
This is in sothe / which may not be denied
Wherefore I will / that thou be allied
With the greeks / and with Achilles go
To them anon / my will is it beso
For they shall have / as I have disposed
Victory and honor / that may be disposed
For it is fatal / and ne may not varye
And thou to them / shall be necessary
In counseylynge / and in yeuynge read
And be right helping / to their good speed
And with that word / rose him up Calcas
And to Achilles / he went an easy pas
And when that he came / to his presence
With great honor / and much reverence
He was received / like to his estate
And after soon / they were confederate
Swore togydre / be bond and assurance
To be all one / without varyaunce
And than in haste / they togydre gone
To their ships / and shope them forth anon
With Pirrodus / going by their side
They hale up the anchor / and no longer bide
But sail forth / Calcas and they twain
Toward Greece / them needs not complain
On wind and wawe / till they aryued be
At Athenes / that stood upon the sea
A large Cite / of old foundation
And Achilles / to king Agamenon
Has Calcas brought / and also Pirrodus
And when the greeks / the story tells us
Assembled were / they together went
Tofore the king / and Calcas represent
To all the lords / and no longer dwell
And right anon / Achilles began to tell
Without abode / in Delos how they met
Tofore Appollo / where they answer fette
And how the god / has plainly determined
The greeks purpose / how it shall be fined
Upon Troyans / and bad Calcas also
In no wise / that he to Troy go
But with greeks that he abide stylle
Till they their purpose / finally fulfylle
Of which thing / the greeks glad of chere
Calcas accept / with heart full entere
For one of them / confederat be bond
To be all one / on water and on land
Without change / or any varyaunce
The oath is made / and put in remembrance
And they again / fully him assure
To cherysshe him / while their life may dure
For well or woe / and so they made an end
And after part / and to their lodging wend.
Ty^ll on the morrow / after y^ sterry night
When Aurora / was gladded with ye light
Of Phoebus vemes / the greeks up arise
And to their gods / with many sacryfyse
They do honor / in what they can or may
And devoutly / holding a feste day
After their rytes / meynt with love and dread
In remembrance / of the good speed
And of the answer / yt gods have them sent
So agreeable / unto their intent
By Pirrodus / and by Achilles
And after this / among all the pres
Is Calcas come / tofore Agamenon
All his lords / sitting enuyron
Like their estates / each in his place dew
And humbly / began them to salewe
Upon his knees / with sobre countenance
And prayed them / it be no displesaunce
To stynte a while / and give him audyence
And right anon / as made was silence
Among them all / Calcas began abrayde
And even thus / full soberly he said.
OSyres quod he / and my lords dear
Kings / Princes / and dukes that be here
Sonoble echone / worthy and famous
And eke so manly / and so virtuous
Which in this place / be now here present
Is not the fine / and chief of your intent
And cause also / why that ye echone
Assembled be / to Troy for togone
With this power / and this great strength
Your purpose is / to long draw a length
And differred forth / fro day to day
To your damage / platly this no nay
For to long / ye soiourne in this isle
And trow ye not / that Pryam in this while
Has his espyes / among you pryuelye
I wot it well / I say you faythfullye
To know the fine / of our governance
And he there whiles / may make purueaunce
Him to defend / while ye m ydell rest
Me seems sothly / ye do not for the best
For in abiding / and in such delays
Great harm may fall / certain this no nay is
I preue it thus / for plainly while that ye
To your enmyes / grant lyberte
Them to puruey / they may with mighty hand
Enforce them / your power to withstand
With their friends / and their allyaunce
And at leyser / make their ordinance
It is folly / that ye so differ
Sith ye be ready / for to make a werre
On your enemies / with every circu^staunce
For no thing may / a quarrel so auaunce
As hasty suyte / it will the sharper byte
The Iren hoote / time is for to smite
And not abide / till that it be cold
For nouther than / it plye will nor fold
Go set upon / all of one accord
And to ship / anon within board
Enhaste you / for time is to remewe
With all your might / your quarrel to pursewe
Against them / that have to you trespassed
How many days / be of somer passed
And many months / run and over slide
And Titan often / with his chare has ride
From eest to west / and in the wawes deep
His stremes bathed / while ye have leyne aslepe
And spent your time / in this place thus
While that the wind / called zephyrus
Benyngnely enspyred / has a lofte
The a tempre eyer / the wether fair and soft
The calm see / from wawes stylle and plain
Whiles ye waste / your days here in vain
That when your foon / thereto take heed
They will suppose / that it be for dread
And be more bold / to set of you but lyte
Trust forsothe / for I will me quyte
Trewely to you / like as I am bound
And think how ye / have the gods found
There toward / benyngne and fortunat
Your honor saved / in hye and low estat
And so shall forth / if your ingratytude
Provoke them not / your purpose to delude
Wylfully to slouthe / your fortune
No wonder is / though they not contune
Toward you / for to show their grace
Wherefore I read / hense for to pace
Demynge the greeks / plainly of the sea
For weryed / and faynted / had be
With long saylynge / parbraked and forbroke
Wherefore they cave / on them have be wroke
All sodaynely / and set on the head
And put themself / in adventure and dread
Of rakelnesse / un aduysely
Whereof to them self / unhappily
It befell / when they the greeks met
With speres long / and swerdes sharp whette
Each on other / manhood for to show
But for cause / Troyans were to few
To issue out / they did folylye
The field was / not parted egallye
For the greeks were / innumerable
That them to mete / Troyans were not able
For that time / they might not suffyse
They took on them / to passing hye empryse
And yet they ne would / for no thing the^ wdrawe
Till that they were / wounded and yslawe
And ouerlayne / of greeks utterly
Now here / now there / bore down cruelly
Mercyles / as Guy do dath report
That them behooves / home again resort
Of very need / and necessytee
And all attones / began for to flee
I mean such / as were left a live
To the castle / they has^ed them full blyue
For they ne might / no longer hold field
Against greeks / with spear nor with shield
They were to feeble / shortly to conclude
To abide / so great a multitude
And as they flee / the greeks a great pase
Ne cease not / to sewe on the chase
Full hastily to the castle gate
And enter in / and by cruel fate
They kill and slay / both hye and low
They spare none / ne list no wyghte to know
Of none estate / but felly him oppress
And what they fond / gold and eke richesse
Unto ship they carried anon
And of the castle / they left not a stone
Above another / but turned up so down
Both wall and toure / and the chief donge own
That no thing stood / so they under mine
And when all / was brought unto ruin
Greeks anon / to their ships haste
Of one assent / and purpose as fast
Without abode / of one will and heart
Fro that haven / plainly to dyuerte
And to sail / Toward Tenedowne
A strong castle / which fro Troy town
In distaunce / but six mile stood
Full of Tresoure / of richesse and of good
Replenysshed / of all habundaunce
And when that they / with their ordinance
ysayled have / both safe and sound
And fro the sea / taken have the ground
To their pleasaunce / wonder agreeable
And of sight / a place delytable
Wholesome of air / the soil right fair and grene
And lusty playnes / goodly on to seen
And was also habundaunt / of vytayle
Replenysshed / of all that may avail
To osteynge / and to sowgyoures
For first the land / full of fresshe flowers
Was plenteuous / both of corn and grain
Of wine and fruit / that no thing lay barayne
Of best and fowls / passyngly plente
And fast by / stood also the sea
Full habundaunt of fysshe / as I find
After the season / of every manner kind
And when that they / within the castle were
The grekesse londed / from a fere
Without abode / they arm them and went out
And upon them / make an hydous shoute
Stuffyng the castle / with meyne strong behind
And took their way / in Guydo as I find
Toward their foon / and knyghtly set upon
And right forth / with greeks eke anon
Met with them / upon the other side
Full surquydous / and right full of pride
Clenly armed / in harneys all ofstele
Fresshe arrayed / and besene so well
For the field as thycke / as sworme of been
On each side / men may behold and seen
Spradde all the plain / down unto y^ stronde
Till at the last / they met hand to hand
And assemble / with square speres ground
And hurtle yfere / with many blody wound
There was no good day / nor no saluynge
But strokes fell / that men herd ring
On bassenettes / the strokes round about
So cruelly / that the fire sprange out
Among the tuftes / broad / bright and shene
Of foil of gold / and feathers white and grene
Eke into breasts / perced many shield
And besagues / fleed a broad in the field
And many men / ley that mortal found
Full dedely pale / law by the grunde
With face gruf / and blody stremes wide
And aldermost / upon the greeks side
The slaughter was / and the discomfyture
So myghtely / the Troyans did endure
Till at the last / for they were so sewe
With multitude / the greeks on the^ hew
For mo than forty / were against one
Of very force / abacke they must gone
No thing for lack of manhood / dare I said
But for so many / have them over layne
They may no longer / in the field soiourne
But to their Castle / home again return
In full great haste / such as might escape
Away a live / and some of them for rape
And dread of death / took them to flight
On horse back / to Troy town full right
No wonder was / though they haste fast
For to the gates / the chase of greeks last
So cruelly / after they pursewe
And some of them / that might not remewe
On Troy side / forweryed of fight
The greeks slew / with all their full might
Now here now there / who they might attain
There may no ransom / nor no mercy gain
Of none estate / without excepcyowne
And after that / unto Tenedowne
The greeks went / and it be set about
That Troyan none / might escape out
And when they had / the bulwerkes won
To skale the wall / after they begone
And made a saute / manfully and often
And Troyans / as they stood a lofte
Put them of / that enter they ne might
With cast of stone / and quarrel bright
With bow turkeys / and shote of Arbalasteres
And their gonners / standing at corneres
With him also / and cast of wild fire
Of yrous hate / full hot in their desire
Like manly men / them self / they diffende
And aye the greeks / as they up ascend
Cruelly they put / to the ground
Till they without / an ordinance have found
What with gynnes / devised for the nones
And gonnes great / for to cast stones
Bent to the toures / right as any line
And large sowes / low for to mine
And some of them / upon the wall gone
That were so thycke / made of lyme and stone
And to enter / they many ways seek
Set their bastyles / and their hurdeys eke
Round about / to the hard wall
And skalynge ladders / for saw^es marcyalle
They began up cast / with hokes for to hold
And up ascend / the sturdye greeks bold
Till Troyans / from the crestes cast
The great stones / while they would last
And Callyowne / eke greeks to opresse
And wonder manly / did their business
In their diffence / and made plonge them low
With cast of quarrel / and with shote of bow
Thorugh Olyettes / that of necessyte
They put them of / it may none other be
And broke their necks / and their shuldre boues
As they fell / with the square stones
And lie deed / pyteous pale of hew
But Greeks aye / began the saute renew
With multitude / Troyans to assail
To withstand / that they began to fail
And wexe feeble / for rescuse came there none
And so of force / the greeks be in gone
Thorugh ye walls / when they have the^ broke
And on Troyans / so cruelly be wroke
That finally / they left none a live
But slay and kylle / and after that as blyue
On the walls / their baners they have set
And young and old / it might be no bette
All goth to wrack / upon Troy side
And after that / they ne will no longer bide
But treasoure gold / and what they may find
They cast an hepe / and together bind
And make spoil / of all that was within
And than in haste / the walls they begin
Pynacle and toures / and also the dungeowne
To brenne and hew / and to beat down
And with the soil / they made even and plain
And with great pray / anon they went again
To their ships / glad and light of chere
When the fire / with his flawmes clear
The castle had / consumed and ybrent
And after that / auyse and prudent
The manly man / the worthy Agamenon
Let make anon / a conuocacyon
Of the greeks / and bad they should bring
Gold and treasour / without more tariynge
With all the pray / they wanne at Tenedowne
To his presence / for this conclusyowne
That he may make / distribucyon
Among them / without excepcyon
Like their desert / unto pore and rich
He departs / to every man a lyche
But most to such / as did best disserue
For to himself / him list no thing conserve
For he has lever / their hertes than the good
Of such as had / spente their own blood
So manfully / the castle for to win
For who that can / with largess first begin
Ne fails not / after well to speed
Thorugh help of men / when that has need
For love follows / fredome comenly.
How king Agamenon assembled the Barons of Greece before to keep a counsel /
And how they sent Vlixes and king Dyomede to king Pryamus on message. Ca. xix.
ANd after this / the king let make a cry
That all the kings / and lords of his oste
Dukes / and Earls / come from every cost
The next morrow / tofore him to appear
The night ypassed / Phoebus began to clear
Her emysperye / after the lark song
When y^ the king / among the greeks strong
Upon the plain / in his see royal
And fast by / most chief and pryncypall
Of his lords / were set in their degree
And when the king / saw oportunyte
That was there made scylence / every where
His lyeges standing / enuyron here and there
The king of chere sad / and eke Iocounde
As he that was of speech / full faucounde
Began his tale / with sobre countenance
The effect of which / was this in substance.
Syres quod he / full worthy of degree
Of very right / and necessyte
We be compelled / both hye and low
With all our might / like as ye well know
To redress a thing / that is amys
For thorugh the world / as it reported is
We be of force / of power and of might
Of worthynesse / in every wyghtes sight
Most renowned / and most worshypable
And ydempt and Iuged / for most able
Of all people / and lyklyest to stand
For to parforme / what we take an hand
Who that ever grutcheth / or says nay
Yer me seems / if it be to your pay
Thylke power / most is acceptable
Unto gods / and lengest stondeth stable
That is deuoyde / of surquedry and pride
For it is kouth / upon every side
In each land / both of one and all
How many harms / and greues have befall
Thorugh rancoure / oonly pride and wylfulnesse
So inportable / as I could express
Thorugh pride / there is done offense
The hye gods / make resistance
To all tho / that be surquydous
Which is a vice / so contraryous
That it may / in no place abide
And in good faith / manhood is no pride
For who that has / any acquaintance
Outher by frendshyp / or by alyaunce
With a proud man / to be confederate
With him in heart / of hye or low estate
He needs must / what ever that he be
To many other / of necessyte
Be loathsome / first enmy and contrayre
For no thing may / a man so much appayre
As pride in sothe / in hye or low degree
Wherefore I read / plainly how that we
This foul vice / out of our heart arrace
That our quarrel / may have the more grace
And specially / that our deeds all
Conveyed be / how ever that it fall
By rightwysnesse / more than volunte
For if truth / our sothfaste guide be
Us to direct / by his rightful line
Than our quarrel / shall aye in honor shine
And contune / in full felycyte
And ferthermore / this know all ye
How we are come / for to do vengeance
With our frendshyppe / and out alyaunce
Upon Pryam / for wrongs done of old
By him and his / as I have often told
And here upon / we have his ground ytake
And some of his / maked to a wake
With manfull hand / and his castelles strong
Ibete down / that stand have so long
And take there the rychessees that we found
And slew his men / with many blody wound
And harms mo / done in his country
That I wot well / if their enmyte
Was unto us / great and much before
I dare say now / it is in double more
That if that they / avenged might be
On us echone / anon ye should se
Their great Ire / so cruel and so huge
Be execute / without more refuge
And yet in sothe / I wot they have espied
Our being here / though we be not askyred
Of them as yet / I dare say utterly
They are well ware / that we are fast by
And over more / this wot I well also
Of the harms / that we have them do
The which as yet / be but fresshe and grene
If they were strong / and mighty to sustene
A werre on us / anon they would gynne
And yet the Cite / in which they be inn
Is walled strong / and toured round about
That they wene fully / out of doubt
With the meyne / that they have gadred in
Of their alyes / that we shall not wyn
Of them but small / in werre nor in strife
For he in sothe / has a prerogatyfe
And advantage / that in his country
Him self diffendeth / namely if that he
Be stuffed strong / of friends him beside
And of alyes / where he does abide
Like as the Raven / with his feathers blake
Within his nest / will often time make
Again the Faukon / gentle of nature
Full hard diffence / whiles he may dure
Or that he be vaynquysshed / and outrayed
And yet some while / the Faukon is delayed
Whiles the Raven / beside his nest does flee
Within his court / at his lyberte
As every foul / is froward to areste
For to be daunted / in his own neste.
ANd yet these words / to you I not say
In any wise / to put in a fraye
Your knyghtly heart / so manly and so stable
Nor that to you / it should be doutabse
But the Troyans / that we shall confound
And their Cite / in which they habounde
Plainly destroy / albe that it be strong
And they / and all be them among
Shall finally / consumpt / be with death
Through greeks sword / yield up the brethe.
But the cause / without any dread
Why I say thus / is that ye take heed
For any pride / or presumpcyon
To aduerte / in your discrecyon
So prudently / that reason in this need
For any haste / may our brydell led
And so ordain / or we hense wend
That laud / and praise / after the end
May be reported / as I have devised
For many man / that has not be aduysed
In his pursuyte / for lack of prouydence
To se tofore / in his aduertence
What should fall / to death it has them brought
Such wylfull haste / were good to be thought
Of us before / by examynacyon
And well discussed / by reuolucyon.
Of thinking often / that we not repent
And first remember / how that Pryam sent
To us but late / oonly for Exyon
That yet is hold / of king Thelamon
Which was of us / without aduysement
Indiscreetly denied / by assent
Which has to us / be none advantage
But ground and rote / of full great damage
For if that we / thorugh wise purueaunce
Of her had made / delyueraunce
The harms great / had be eschewed
That after were / of Paris so pursewed
In the temple / of Cythera
That build is / beside Eirrea
The tresoure great / also that he had
And Iewelles / that he with him ladde
Than to Troy / and the great richesse
The slaughter of men / and the heaviness
That yet is made / for the queen Eleyne
Thorughoute Greece / and the great pain
Of Menelay / all had been unwrought
If we had seen / this in our thought
Wisely before / and Exyon restored
Than had not / the harms be so mourned
On us echone / in very soth fastness
Nor spent our labor / so in ydelnesse
Tresoure nor good / wasted so in vain
Nor come so far / for to fetch again
The queen Eleyne / with costs inportable
Withouten harms / now in eschewable.
ANd for all this / yet ne wot we
Whether to joy / or aduersyte
The thing shall turn / that we be about
Sith often sithe / dependent and in doubt
Is fatal thing / vnsyker / and unstable
And fro the gynnynge / often varyable
The end is seen / fortune can transmewe
Her gery course / and therefore to eschew
The harms lykly / possible for to fall
My counsel is / here among you all
Upon travail / travail to eschew
In this matter / are we further sewe
To Pryamus / without any more
To send first again / for to restore
The queen Eleyne / as right and reason is
And other harms / done eke by Paris
After his trespass / and offency on
Justly to make / restytucyon
Than may we all / in worship and honor
Return home / without more labor
If they assente / to do as we requere
And our axynge / if they list not here
But folyly / of their wylfulnesse
Refuse it / than our worthynesse
Is double assured / on asyker ground
By just title / Troyans to confound
With things two / we shall be under pyght
First our power / borne up with our right
Shall for us fight / our quarrel to dareyne
In balaunce to weye / atwixe us weyne
To fine that we / shall be more excused
For they tofore / have wylfully refused
Our just profers / made to them before
And we shall be / thorugh the world therefore
Without spot / of trespass or of blame
Of mysreport / in hyndrynge of our name
Where they of folly shall ynoted be
Of wylfull wodenesse / plainly where that we
Shall stand free / our power for to use
And every man / shall us well excuse
Though that we do / execucyon
By taking vengeance / for their offencyon
Of man and child / of each sect and age
That shall of death / hold the passage
And by the sword / without mercy pace
One and other / there is no better grace.
But yet tofore / I counsel take heed
That ye to them / all mesoure bid
This hold I best / and most sykernesse
And work now / by good auysenesse
Among your self / and no longer tarry
To which counsel / some were contrary
And varyaunt / to his oppynyon
Save they that were / of most discrecyon
Assented be plainly / to this end
And chosen have / to Pryam for to send
Among them / the embassy at to speed
Wise Vlixes / and worthy Dyomede
The which anon / began them ready make
And shope them forth / and their way take
Toward Troy / as any line right
When the son / shone full shene and bright
Holding the course / of his fiery spear
In mydday arc / wonder bright and clear
And gylte each hylle / vale plain and roche
With his bemes / when they did approach
To the walls / and gates of the town
And in they go / without noise or sown
Full well ^esene / and in their port them had
Right manfully / and the way them ladde
To the paleyes / straight as any line
Them needs not / aside to declyne
But into a court / large wide and square
And they full knightly / for no wight would spare
Unto the effect / manly to proceed
To do their charge / without fere or dread
For the enter / was to them not refused
For tho days / paraunter was not used
To have no conduyte / for embassatrye
The custom was / to no man to deny
As I suppose / enter nor passage
If it so were / he come for message
And in this court / builded so ryally
When they come / they meruayled full greatly
The royal sight / of so huge strength
So well complete / both in bread and length
For they not had / in their life to fore
Seen none so fair / and yet they wonder more
Into the Paleyes / as they together gone
That paued was / all of Jasper stone
Of a tree / that amyddes stood
On which to look / they thought it did the^ good
Musing where / it were Artifycyall
Erect or set / by magyk natural
Or by engyne / of werkemen coryous
Thorugh subtle crafts / superiticyous
Or other work / of Nygromancye
Or profounde castyuge / of Phylosophye
By appearance / or illusyon
Outher by craft / of Incantacyon
Up and down / they cast in their mind
Out by reason / if they could find
Rote and ground / of this wonder work
But the truth / was to them so derke
That in their wit / though they long trace
The pryuyte / they can out compace
To conceive / how it was possible
For to the eye / as it was vysyble
In very sothe / without any fable
To man's hand / so it was palpable
Of which the stock / of Guydo as I told
In soth fastness / was of pured gold
Which shone as bright / as the somer son
To enlumyne / things that were done
And the body / as a maste was right
Proporcyoned / most goodly to the sight
Substancyall / and of huge strength
And twelve cubytes / the body was of length
And the croppe / round / and large of bread
And in compass / began so flourysshe and sprede
That all the plain / about enuyrowne
With the bows / was shadowed up and down
The rich branches / and the leaves fair
Twain and twain / joined as a pair
One of gold / a another silver shene
And meynt among / with stones white and grene
Some read / and some sapher hewed
And every day / the blomes were renewed
And the blossoms / with many sundry fuyte
For stones ynde / it bare instead of fruit
As says Guydo / I can no ferther tell
And the Greeks / will no longer dwalle
But hold their way / by many sundry went
To parfourme / the fine of their intent
Till they atteyne / the chamber pryncypall
Where Pryamus / in his see royal
Like his estate / in full kyngly wise
Sat / and about / full prudent and full wise
His lords all / in settes him beside
When the greeks / surquedous of pride
With stern there / and froward countenance
As they that had / little remembrance
Of gentyllesse / nor of curtesye
For as Guydo / does plainly specyfye
Entering in / they taken have their place
In the opposyte / of the kings face
And set them down / without more sermon
Any obeyinge / or salutacyon
Worship honor / or any reverence
Done of the king / for all his excellence
In pretudyce / of all gentyllesse
And than anon / Vlixes began express
Cause of their coming / to king Pryamus
Without abode / saying even thus
Not forberynge / presence of the king.
OEruayle not / nor have no wondering
Though we to y^ / ne do no honor dew
In our coming / the for to salewe
Sith it ne longs in sothe / as thinks me
Where rancour is / and hertely enmyte
Or dedely hate / with salutacyons
Or with feigned / false affeccyons
For to show / where hertes be a fire
For naturally / no man shall desire
Of his enmye / the health nor welfare
And platly now / me list not for to spare
Shortly to show / the fine of our intent
Like as we have / in commandment
In our message / from Agamenowne
The noble king / most worthy of reuowne
Which us has sent / there is no more to seyne
Now unto the / for the queen Eleyne
That was rauysshed / out of greeks land
And brought to Troy / by force of mighty hand
Against right / and by vyolence
Wherefore shortly / without more offense
We justly axe / without more demand
That thou anon / rightfully command
To Menelay / that she be sent again
And with all this / we axe not in vain
That thou make / restytucyon
Of wrongs done / in that regyon
Of pylfres great / slaughter and roberye
By Paris done / of wylfull tyranny
Which is thy sone / and by the sustained
And in his error / wrongefully meynteyned
Wherefore come of / and fully condescende
Without grutchynge / this wrongs to amend
For so thou may / best the gods queme
Like as thou might / in thy reason deem
As right requereth / to work as the wise
For if so be / that thou now despise
To execute / that I have told the here
Trust me right well / a lesson thou shall lere
Which thou and thine / shall after sore rewe
Without feynynge / thou shall find true
That but if thou / a better end make
Cruel vengeance / shall on the be take
And finally / what should I to the feign
The force of death / this quarrel shall darayne
Upon the / and upon all the blood
Raunsomles / other of gold and good
And questyonles / report this of me
That mercyles / this rich strong Cite
Shall down be beat / and ylayde full low
Wall and toures / also overthrow
This all and some / be now well aduysed
That our axynge / of the be not despised
But wisely work / and do as I have said
ANd suddenly / king Pryamus i^ abrayde
Of hasty Ire / he might not abide
Of the greeks / when he saw the pride
The great outrage / and presumpcyon
Without abode / or dely beracyon
To ^lixes / anon he began out break
And unto him / even thus to speak.
I wonder greatly / in mine aduertence
Beunge astoned / how ye in my presence
So ungoodly / dare make this demand
Like as ye had power / to command
And me constrayne / your bidding to obey
And I for fere / durst not with say
No manner thing / that ye axe here
Nor contrary / what that ye require
Whereof sothly / in heart I am ameued
And of your thretes / inwardly agreued
And astoned surely / not alyte
That ye are bold / so me to excyte
And vylaynously / mine honor to provoke
On your words / for to be a work
But for all this / trust me right well!
I will not pass my bounds / never adele
Nor the rather / shrotely at the end
To your axynge / in no thing condescende.
For to consider / the fine of your intent
It were not sitting / nor conuenyent
Akynge to grant / your axynge though y^ he
Stood in myschefe / and captyuyte
Without recure / to vttraunce bought
It were outrage / plainly to be thought
To axe of him / that ye axe of me
And sothely yet / I suppose not that ye
Accomplysshynge may / so much avail
As ye have said / for plately ye shall fail
Of your purpose / I say and god toforne
Mauge your might / though ye had it sworn
For your request / in every wyghtes sight
Wants a ground / both of truth and right
That axe of me / satisfaccyon
And were your self / first occasyon
When ye slew / my fader Lamedowne
And his lyeges / and brent eke his town
And many harms / if they were out sought
On him and his / causeles ye wrought
That it were long / all for to reherce
Which day by day / thorugh my heart perce
My suster / eke called Exyon
Ye ladde away / out of this regyon
The which is not / unto her worthynesse
Ytreted like / nor after gentylnesse.
And for all this / ye would amends have
Wrongly of me / that whylom for to save
All thing in peace / and to stynte werre
To you sent / into Greece far
Oonly to have had / Exyona again
Of which sonde / ye had but disdain
And cruelly / in ungoodly wise
My messager / ye began to despise
That he uneath / might eskape away
Out of greece / ye know it is no nay
Of you he had / so ungoodly chere
And in good faith / me list not now to here
Your request / nor give audyence
To your axynge / for your great offense
For lever I had / shortly for to deye
Than condescende / to ought that ye seye
For I will fully / for conclusyon
That it be known / to Agamenon
That we have lever / this is douteles
Finally his werre / than his pees
Sith ye to me / have done so great trespace
And by my truth / in this self place
Cruelly anon / ye should dye
But for the office / of embassatrye
Against death / is fully your defense
That be so bold / without reverence
In my presence / so to threte or speak
Trust me right / it should an one bewreke
Wherefore in haste / without words mo
My counsel is / that ye be a go
Out of my sight / and void this Cite
For thus it stands / whiles I you se
In my heart / may enter no gladness
The fret of Ire / put me in such distress
That in good faith / I may it not sustene
So In portune / is the rage and tene
That inwardly / byndeth me for the while
ANd Dyomedes / tho began to smyle
And said anon / thus unto the king
If it so be / that thou of our coming
In thine heart / haste so much pain
Us to behold / now that be buttwayne
And art therewith / so inly set a fire
Than shall thou never / be without ire
In all thy life / nor deuoyde of woo
Sithe thou have / so many cruel foo
Of greeks now / entered in thy land
An hundred thousand / almost at thyn hand
Again whose might / thou may y^ not assure
To resyste plainly / nor endure
Consider well / how that they be strong
As thou shall wit / paraunter are aught long
Somanly men / and so well arrayed
Expert in arms / and of old assayed
That no diffence / many again them veil
And wyteeke well / that thou may not fail
By death of sword / of their hand to deye
And all thine / there is no more to seye
Though it so be / proudely that thou speak
And with thy tunge / oonly to be wreke
Afermest more / than thou may acheue
Better it were / such words leave
And to wise counsel / take better head
BUt than in haste / again this Dyomede
Surquydous / and most full of pride
There rose up some / by the kings side
With swerdes draw / and on him have fall
And all to hew / there among them all
Of hasty Ire / brennynge as the glede
Till Pryamus / began to take heed
And rose him up / seeing this disease
And manfully / this rage began appease
Them diffendynge / upon death and life
That none of them / be hardy in this strife
The embassatoures / to harm or to grieve
For though a fool / his folly will not leave
To presume / to speak vnconnyngly
A wise man / must suffer pacyently
And though that he / hap do offense
Thorugh folly speech / for lack of sapyence
To a wise man / ne iongeth sothe to said
To take heed / or to speak again
For as to a fool / it is perteynent
To show his folly / right so conuenyent
Is to the wise / sothly with suffraunce
In all his port / to have tolleraunce
For to foles / longs kyndely
Without advise / to speak folyly
Indiscreetly his menynge / to fulfylle
Where a wise man / shall here and bestylle
Till he se time / and have pacyence
And dissymule / in his aduertence
The rage of foles / that last but a throw
For by his tunge / a fool is often know
And lever I had / I do you well assure
In my person / damage to endure
Than to suffer / any messagere
In my court / of you that be here
To have a wrong / outher great or lyte
The sword of rancour / may not always byte
To do vengeance / for a thing of naught
For often it falls / a wrong is wrought
For little excess / follows great reprefe
And haste is ayemedled / with myschefe
Wherefore I bydde / that ye sytte down
And in no wise / of presumpcyowne
Attempteth not / in no manner wise
By sign or word / more for to despise
The embassatoures / from the greeks sent
But let them freely / declare their intent
And ye there whiles / keep your lyppes close
ANd sodaynely / than Eneas rose
Which next the king / have tha^ his see
So inwardely / with rancour fret was he
That he ne might / himself not refrain
And said sir / so ye not disdain
That I shall say / me seems that it is
Well according / when one has said amys
And reklesly / spoken unadvised
Of his folly / that he be chastysed
That other may / example by him take
To be well ware / such noise and cry to make
And specially / in open audyence
So to offend / your toyall excellence
And sothely yet / I wot well that I might
So me govern / plainly in your sight
Of hastynesse / without aduysement
That I should / by your commandment
The death deserve / for my great offense
And trewely yet / ne were for your presence
Of this twain / that have so yspoke
Without abode / I should anon be wroke
For it were worthy / and right well sitting
When that a fool / in presence of king
Is bold or hardy / of presumpcyon
To take on him / of indiscrecyon
Thing to reherce / concludynge in sentence
Preiudyce / of your magnyfycence
That he were taught / better to govern
His large tunge / to konne bet diserne
When he shall speak / or when be in pese
To suffer him / to run out of lose
As does he this / that spoke has so large
Wherefore in have / I counsel him and charge
Without abode or any word mo
Out of your sight / anon he be a go
For it is best / to do as I him read
TO whom anon / full proudly Dyomede
Not astoned / but a with stern look
To Eneas / that for ire quoke
Answered again / with words but a few
And said sir / thy words does well show
What so thou be / that thou art right wise
Well is that king / that does by thine advise
Or has the nigh / of counsel for to be
For he ne may err / in no degree
That art so rightful / in thy judgment
Of wylfulnesse / without aduysement
To causea lord / his bonds for to pace
So would god / in some other place
That I might / by favor of fortune
Mete with the / at leyser oportune
Like my desire / that can so well endyte
In old fables / thy labor for to quyte
And the to thank / for thy gentle there
Which so knyghtly / thou have us showed here
Trust well thereto / and have thereof no dread
ANd tho Vlixes / of this Dyomede
Began interrupte / his words prudently
And to him / said / full aduysely
That it was best / to stynte and be still
And now we know / fully all the will.
Quod vlires / full manly to the king
We will go hense / without more tariynge
Out of thy sight / to Agamenon
And make to him / plain relacyon
Of thy answer / in order by and by
And to horse / they went suddenly
And in short time / so have them in their way
That they be come / there is no more to say
Where the king satte / in his tentorye
And word by word / as came to memory
They reherce / the substraunce every dele
Whereof the greeks / like no thing well
Conceyuynge full / there was no remedy
As by report / of the embassatrye
Save oonly this / utterly proceed
How they them shall / govern / in this need
Again Troyans / of necessyte
For they well wot / it may none other be
And assented both / in will and bid
To purueye them fast / they them speed
In this storye / as I shall after find
But or that / I make thereof mind
I must / a while / of Eneas endyte
As mine Auctor list / of him to write
The which sothly / as books say he was
This manly Troyan / this famous Eneas
Anchisis sone / of great wortynesse
Whylom get / of Venus the goddess
Conqueroure / of many regyon
When Troy / was brought to destruccyon
He went his way / by the large see
Called Tyrene / and saylynge forth goth he
By many cost / and many narowe passage
Many danger / till into Cartage
He ryued is / and then segan to sail
To the conquest / of the great ytale
And so to Rome / he has the way take
Of whose ofsprynge / as Auctours make
Came Augustus Caesar / the Emperor
That was whylom / so noble a conqueror
That his renown / to this day does shine
And of Enee / the Emperor Iustyne
In his book / called Autentykes
Full plainly wryt / therein the rubrykes
That after Caesar / so as Cesares
Be named yet / right so Eneades
After Enee / the name should bear
Which fro Troy / comen was so fere
Unto ytayle / and of this Eneas
As I have told Caesar / descended was
Down line right / full manly and royal
That first in Rome / by scepter imperyall
Mauge their might / had governance
And of wysoome / set in governance
Common things / touching the Cytee
And to proceed / ferther of Enee
Holy his life / and knyghthode by and by
If that ye list / to read ceryously
Ye may se all / full Autentyke of style
In Eneydos / compyled of virgyle
Albe it so / that this noble clerk
Was grave before / or complete was his work
As books old / make mencyon.
How king Agamenon / sent Achylles and Thelephus into the isle of Messa for
vitaylles / and how they slew the king / and made The lephus king after his
death. Ca. xx.
But now again / to Agamenon
Without more / my style I will return
The which king / will no more soiourne
In this matter / delays for to make
But in all haste / he has his counsel take
Of his lords / being there present
And such as were not / he has after sent
For one and all / Erlys / Dukes / and kings
And said syres / among other things
To our Journey / that be necessary
My counsel is / no longer that we tarry
But first of all / to make ordinance
By one assent / with prudent purueaunce
That alder first / we shape for vytayle
Without which / none host may avail
To parforme / a Journey thryftely
Wherefore I read / here but fast by
If it to you / be liking and plesaunce
Into an isle / full of habundaunce
Called Messa / that we send anon
And at one word / assented euerychone
They chosen have / worthy Achylles
And Geleffus / the sone of Hercules
To execute / this purpose finally
With many worthy / in their company
I chosen out / thorugh the host anon
With Achylles / to Messa for to gone
In which land / rich and plenteuous
Reigned a king / worthy and famous
That Tentran hight / which in tranquyllyte
Without werre / or aduersyte
Had hold his Scepter / and his royal sete
In this isle / so plesaunt and so mete
Albe that some / say that this little isle
To the kingdom / longs of Cecyle
And has his name / given of plente
After Messane / an huge great Cite
Full plenteuous / both on see and land
The which kingdom / as I understand
Is said Messana / of Messes in latyne
Thorugh habundaunce / of fruit corn and wine
At the aryuayle / on the playnes large
Where they are wont / for to stuff and charge
Merchant ships / of strange fer country
That thither sail / by the large see
To fetch vytaylle / aye fro year to year
Fro many cost / of lands fer and nere
Oonly by eschaunge / of other march aundyse
And eke also / as books can deuyse.
And as Guydo / full plainly tells us
That of a king / called Messanus
This country first / of Messa took the name
That in his time / was of great fame
Passing rich / and wonder plenteuous
But of all this / Dares Frygyus
In his book / makes no mencyon
But shortly tells / in concluycon
How Achylles / and Thelephus also
To Messana / be together go
With three thousand / of greeks chosen out
Most manly men / among all their route
The which as fast / as they began to land
And the king / began to understand
Of their coming / he is descended down
With all the worthy / of his regyowne
Ou horse and foot / in steel armed bright
Against Greeks / manfully to fight
Them to deuoyde / plainly if ye can
And sodaynely / thus the skarmysshe began
At wyxe greeks / and their mortal fone
On outher part / that there was many one
Slain and hurt / and to the death ywounded
Ever vnlyckely / thereof / to be sounded.
Hor other treat / was none them atwene
But swerdes sharp / and speres square and kene
Now here now there / that they go to ground
For every man his foo / for to confound
His labor did / and his business
And though grek / through their worthynesse
Had on their foo^ / much land ywonne
yet to resort after they begone
And marvel none / because that their fone
Had always three / in noumbre against one
For the time it may / none other be
Till Achylles / began behold and se
The mortal slaughter / upon greeks side
Tournynge the back / with wou^des large and wide
Of hasty rancour / change began his blood
And for Ire / furyous and wode
When he beheld / his men lose their land
He with y^ sword / which he held in his hand
Made way / killed and bare down
And in the field / like a fyers lyowne
He fared in sothe / when his men were slawe
Making his foon / backwarde to withdraw
And his greeks / so manly recomforte
That maugre them / he made them to resort
And who that ever / in his way stood
Without mercy / he kylleth in his mode
There gayneth not / in his cruelte
For douteles / ne had his manhood be
His passing renown / and his worthynesse
His knyghthode eke / and his hye prowess
The greeks had / that day fynallye
Vaynquysshed be / without remedy
But thorugh his help / they recure all
For Achylles / sturdy as a wall
Began search sheltrouns / and their rangys brake
To fore whose face / his fomen go to wrake
And alderlaste / when he began espy
Tentran the king thorugh his chyualrye
Diffende himself / like a worthy knight
And as a lion / bare him in his fight
Now here now there / greeks so oppress
This Achylles / of cruel hardynesse
Ne would cease / in his putsewynge
Thorugh the ward / till he came to the king
Of manly force / stout and full of pride
Making away / round on every side
Again whose might / no thing might avail
And of Tentran / first the auentayle
He raced has / and rent the mayle a sonder
And all to hew / that it was a wonder
To consydre / that day his cruelte
And after that / all to broke has he
His bassenet / with many cruel wound
Of very might / smyt the king to ground
And in all haste / he maked has no let
Of his head / to rende his bassenette
And mercyles / for to do vengaunce
His harm he began / on heyghte to auaunce
Fully in purpose / that he shall be deed
And raunsomles / began hamyn at his head
With blody sword / and a despytous heart
Casting plainly / he should him not asserte
In his Ire / he was so furyous
But of fortune / it befell right thus
Thelephus / the young lusty knight
Casuelly / thereof had a sight
And of Achylles / the manner full beheld
The stroke anon / he bare up with his shield
And began Achylles / mekely for to preye
To have pity / so to do him deye
Sith he lay wounded / almost to the death
Brought to the point / to yield up the breath
Besechynge him / for his benyngnyte
Of manly routhe / and knyghtly eke pity
Withdraw his hand / and to do him grace
And grant him life / for a little space
Sith every knight / should of gentyllesse
His enmye spare / when he is in distress
To vttraunce brought / and specially when he
Mercy requires / of humble volunte.
To whom Achylles / fervent in his ire
As he that was / of rancoure set a fire
Answerde again / what list the so to preye
For him / that nolde of pride our will obey
Began a werre / where as was no need
Of disdain / and indignacyon
Having a trust / of presumpcyon
In his manhood / which might hy not avail
Against greeks / to hold a battle
As it is preuyd / plainly in the end
All otherwise / shortly than he wend
For in the dyche / justly he is fall
Which he made / of malys for us all.
Where we of will / nor entencyon
Gave unto him / none occasyon
Upon no side / platly fer nor nere
Nor mynystred / to him no matere
Nor to his land / mente no damage
But himself / ground of all this rage
Without offense / done to him of us
And efte again / young Thelephus
Humbly required / of Achylle
Of knyghtly routhe / his axynge to fulfylle
And to have mercy on him / in this cas
For with my fader / this king whylom was
Quod Thelephus / be bond conferate
Which lies now here / all desconsolate
Expectant oonly / with a dedely face
Upon the hour / when his ghost shall pace
Thorugh gyrte alas / with many mortal wound
And for cause / I have in him found
Before this time / full great kyndenesse
For of manhood / and of gentyllesse
In the bounds / of his regyowne
He unto me / thorugh his hye renown
Whylom / as I casuelly began ride
Showed in sothe / upon every side
Full ryall chere / and great humanyte
That I am bound / of very duyte
To remember / and to have in mind
And douteles else / I were unkind
Which after would / my name foul a twyte
And for that / I parcel would him quyte
I you beseech / of respyte of his life
And Achylles / without any strife
Delivered has / the storye tells thus
Tentran freely / unto Thelephus
Whether him list / to save / or to spylle
And when that he had him / at his will
He considered / by his wounds grene
That were so mortal / sothely and so kene
Of very need / that he must dye
There was no gain / nor no remedy
Nor avail / may no medecyne
The hour wha^ Phoebus / westward began declyne
And the battle / brought was to an end
While the greeks to their ships wend
The mean while / Tentran for the pain
Of his wounds / began more and more complain
Without staunche / so pyteously they blede
His officers / fast began them speed
In a lytter / made full royal
Toward his paleys / and dou^ge own pryncypall
To carry him / softely and easily
And at his prayer / full benyngnely
Thelephus / and also Achylles
Conveyed him / among all the prees
Till he was brought / there as them list to be
And they received / like to their degree
Full royally the king / aye languysshynge
As he that drew / toward his ending
And might not longer / draw a length
His woeful life / so weke was he of strength
That his spirit / must algates wend
And he in his haste / made for to send
For Achylles / and for Thelephus
And when they came / he said unto them thus
Syres quod he / full worthy of degree
Health and honor / with long prosperyte
Be unto you / and good adventure
All the while / that your life may dure
And specially of the / O Thelephus
Which haste to me / be so gracyous
Of gentyllesse / in my pains strong
Oonly of grace / my life for to prolonge
But death alas / I may not now eichewe
Nor his sword / on no part remewe
Without recure knytte / in bitter bonds
Upon the brynke fall / of fatys hondes
Of my life / all fully in despeyre
Which of my body / never might have heir
After my day / by succession
To govern / this little regyon
Which lyckely is / to stand desolate
Of governance / and disconsolate
Which that I wan / with full great travail
And to this day / with werre and battle
I have it kept / as ye well know echoue
And defended / from all manner fone
Without loss / years here toforne
But recurlees of yore / I had it lorne
Ne had I had / help and eke socour
Of Hercules / the great conqueror
That whylom was / fader to Thelepus
So strong so mighty / and so chyualrous
By whose manhood / and whose hardynesse
By his knyghthode / and great worthynesse
Which day by day / is new of memory
Of all my foon / I had the victory
He daunted them / and made them so a ferde
Oonly by rygoure / of his sharpeswerde
That finally / thorugh his manly head
He made me / this reygne to possede
Maugre their might / in peace and quyete
With septre and crown / and my royal sete
That none of them / till that he was deed
Hardy was to lift / up the head
Against me / to speak words few
Whereby I may / fully declare and show
By euydence / that this little isle
Is perteynent / and longs to Cecyle
Where Hercules / for a memoryall
S^tte pylers / in his conquest royal
When he had / ride and go to fere
And of Columpna / yet the name bear
After him / called Herculea
Though some say / they hight Herracula
The name chaungynge / by corrupcyon
The which land / was whylom mansyon
To the people / of wild barbarye
The which kingdom / for to magnefye
Frederyke / sothly the secounde
Of gold and good / passyngly habounde
That chosen was / to be Emperor
Of Rome town / and mighty governor
And whylom eke was / king of Cecyle
Which made reyse / in that large isle
A mighty toure / hye and thycke of wall
As says Guydo / for a memoryall
To put his name / long in remembrance
And for the soil / was to his plesaunce
With flowers fresshe / of many sundry hew
In some books / the land was named new
And pealled / as I understand
For his fayrenesse / the lusty new land
But Tentran / aye lymge / in his pain
As he that fast / began the hour attain
Of cruel death / before his lords all
He made in haste / Thelephus to call
To his presence / and with a mortal chere
Said openly / that all might here
My sone quod he / now I shall pace
Out of this world / for gain may no grace
My life to save / thorugh no man's might
But for because / of equity and right
I am compelled / justly in sentence
To declare elerely / my conscience
To fore my death / herynge all this prees
This to sage / thy fader Hercules
The wise worthy / and that knyghtly man
Whylom this land / thorugh his conquest wan
The which oonly / of his goodly head
As he that was / the stock of manly head
Took unto me / by co^myssyon
The governance / of this regyon
Of his free will / with hole the regallye
And nolde himself / the cowne occupye
And sothely yet / his right was not the less
For love of whom / now that I shall pass
Withal the intent / of my last will
To the I grant / as it is right and skylle
As very heyer / justly to succeed
Long in honor / therein thy life to lead
Making there / a prodestacyon
That in full token / of confirmacyon
This is the will / fynall of mine heart
Fro the which / no man may dyuerte
Upon no side / nor utterly declyne
Hor first my will / and dissent of line
Be together / combyne now in one
For which thing / no mortal man may gone
For this desire last / of my langour
That thou plainly / be my Successor
And finally thus / I conclude and deem
That unto the / Septre and dyademe
Delivered be / with every circumstaunce
But all his will / for more assurance
He made write / in his testament
The fine concludynge / of his last intent
And after that / he full pyteously
Thelephus / besought hertely
Of manly routhe / and knyghtly gentyllesse
To do his deuer / and his business
After his death / like his estate royal
To halowe and hold / the feste funeral
Solempnely / and the exequyes do
And sodaynely / without words mo
The king Tentran / yeldeth up the ghost
And went his way / I note to what cost
I can not deem / of such mystyhede
And when Parcas / broken have the thrde
On the rokke / and he was forth his way
Than Thelephus / out of marbyll graye
Curyously a tomb / madekerue
The deed corpse / therein to conserve
Full rychely / and above the grave
An Epythaphe / anon he did grave
In his honor / plainly to express
His knyghthode both / and worthynesse
And how his ghost / and he were deuorced
With letters rich / of gold above enboced
Round about / wonder curyous
On his tomb / that said plainly thus
Here lies Tentran / the king douteles
Whylom slain / of cruel Achylles
That his scepter / and the regalye
Hoolly gave / which no man may deny
To Thelephus / sone of Hercules
Which in his tomb / rests now in pees
When this performed / was in every thing
And Thelephus / was crowned in to king
And hye and low / all by one assent
Had openly / in a Parliament
Made faith to him / and ydone homage
Like their degrees / as they were of age
And with hole heart / in all their best intent
By oath assured / and by sacrament
As true lyeges / received him for king
Than Achylles / without more tariynge
When all was set / in peace and governance
Without grutchynge / or any varyaunce
To their ships / anon he made carye
Every thing / that was necessary
To the greeks / corn / fruit / or vytayle
Flesh or fysshe / or what that might avail
To hosteynge or help them / in their need
Down to the sea / all hedyde led
Fully their vessel / for to stuff and lade
And Thelephus after / this he made
Stylle in the bounds / of his regyon
For to abide / for this conclusyon
That thorugh his help / and his dylygence
Besynes / and discrete prouydence
Again all myschefe / and all scarsyte
When they need / he might their socour be.
AL be that / he like as says Guydo
With Achilles / full feign would have go
But he abode / sothely for the best
By bond assured fully / and beheste
In every thing / greeks to releue
And than in haste / Achilles took his leave
Of Thelephus / and began anon to sail
All his ships / stuffed with vytayle
Toward greeks / as made is mencyowne
And in short time / he at Thenedowne
Aryued is / and taken bathe the ground
With all his knyghted / (...) and round.
And after this / to (...)
Hemade first / full relacyon
Of his expleyt / like as it was fall
In the presence / of his lords all
Sitting enuyron / many worthy knight
And first in Messa / he tells of the fight
When they entered / and of their welcomynge
And ceryously / he told eke of the king
That Tentran hyghte / and plainly also how
Achilles amydde the selde / him slow
And or his death / how he of hole intent
Fully ordained / in his testament
Thelephus also / to be his heir
All this he told / and eke of his re^eyre
Unto the sea / and eke of the vytayle
And Thelephus / how he will not fail
To send them / all that may them please
Of which thing / the greeks in great ease
Were brought of heart / and like wonder well
When Achilles / had told them euerydell
And greatly preysed / his hye prouydence
His manhood both / and his sapyence
In his out being / that he bare him so
And after this / Achilles is go
To his lodging / a little there beside
Where his knights / upon him abide
Myrundones / full glade of his coming
And him received / as longs to a king
Where he abode / and rested him a while
But for Guydo / declyneth here his style
From the greeks / to them of Troy town
I must also / make dygressy own
Of mine Auctor / the steps for to show
Like as it is / conuenyent and dew
To my matere / sith he is my guide
And for a while / greeks set aside
And reherce / how Dares Frygyus
In Troy book / declares unto us
And ceryously / makes mency own
Of the lords / that came to Troy town
To help them manly / in their defense
Against greeks / to make resystence
With ordinance / of many diverse things
There came to them / Earls / Dukes / and Kings
As in Dares / plainly is made mind
Read his book / and there ye may it find
And alder first / I read how that he
Specially speaks / of kings three
Full manly (...) and also of great ^a^e
(...)
(...) writes thus
(...) of them ^ was called Panda^us
And as I read Thabet the secounde
The thu^e Andastrus like as it is found
And as G^ydo ^ list to specysye
(...) knights / in their company
(...) manly men they were euerychon
And from an I^ called colloson
Like as Dares / lyketh to express
There came also / of excellent prowess
(...) of which the first was
(...) / ynamed Caryas
And the second ^ hyghte ymasyus
(...) the thirde^ the.iiij. Amphymacus
And five thousand / worthy knights all
There came with them / manly for to fall
Upon greeks / in helping of the town
And from an yie / of full great renown
Called ly^ye / came the king Glaucon
And ^ith him / brought his sone Spardon
A noble knight / in arms full famous
And was allied / to king Pryamus
And three thousand / if I shall not feign
There came of knights / with these lords twain
And from larys / a rich land also
As I find there / came kings two
And them to quyte / manly as they ought
A thousand knights / they to Troy brought.
And from a kingdom / named lycaowne
Caphemus / a king of great renown
Brought with him / as dares bears witness
A thousand knights / of great worthynesse
And five hundred / Dares tells us
Came with Hupon / and with Epedus
Many knights in plates / of silver bright
And with him eke / a king y^ Remus hight
Brought.iij. thousand to Troy / many mile
From Tabaria / his large mighty isle
And Dukes four / with all their chyualrye
(...) Eries. viij. came in his company
Hauyngem arms / great experyence
And all they bare / without difference
Theyrmen and they / when they were in y^ field
The chief of gold / eueryche in his shield
Whereby the king / and booly his nauye
Among them all / known might be
All be that other / bore eke the same
And fro Trace / king Pylex by his name
Fro thy^ke Trace / that is most excellent
Which in the plage / of the Oryent
Haueth his sight / from which this mighty ky^^ge
A thousand knights / brought at his coming
As mine Auctor / records eke also
An hundred knights / be to Troy go
With Alchamus / a Duke eke full famous
That came with Pylex / Guydo writes thus
Troyans to help / in their great need
And fro Pauonye / sothely as I read
Came Pretemessus / the noble werryour
Lord of that land / king and governor
And duke Stupex / with him eke he had
And of knights / a thousand that he ladde
Toward Troy / from his regyon
And as this storye / makes mencyon
That isle stands / most by wilderness
And by woods / of plenteuous thyckenesse
Grow therein / many full diverse tree
And most is forest / that men may there se
For they there build houses / but a few
And in that land / full dyuersely themshewe
Many lyknesse / queynte and monstrous
Bestes vnkouthe / to syghte meruaylous
Stoundemell / as by appearance
By illusyon / false in existence
Wonder gastefull / plainly for to seen
For diverse goods / of the woods grene
Appear there / called Satyrye
By cornys eke / fawny and incubye
That cause often / men to fall in rage
And of this land / the people is full savage
Hardy knights / furyous and wode
And desirous aye / to shede blood
Greatly expert / specially to shete
With darte and spear / peryllous for to mete
For they cast even / as any line
And from an I Will / that named was Botyne
In great arraye / to Troy the Cite
Like as I find / there came Dukes three
The first of all / called Auphymyus
Saume the secounde / the third Forcyus
And as says Dares / which list natlye
Twelve hundred knights / in their company
And fro Bytunye / as made is remembrance
The rich land / that has such habundau^ce
Of spyces go^mes / fruytes corn and wine
Wholesome rotes / ryndes rich and fine
Wonder vnkouthe / and precious also
Out of which I Will / there came knights two
Full knyghtly men / in arms desirous
King Boetes / and Epysterus
And with them brought / to Troy from so far
A thousand knights / arrayed for the werre
And fro the land / called Paffogonye
Which severed is / from all company
As books say / that be Hystoryall
Under the plage / that is Oryentall
Set so far / as made is rehersayle
That few or none / to that land travail
For there to come / is almost impossyble
For which / that land is called muysyble
Because oonly / of his remocyon
And it is a rich / regyon
Of gold and silver / and also of stones
And habundaunte / of plente for the nones
It is so full of treasoure / and of good
And has his sight / on the rich flode
I named Tygre / not fer from Eufrates
As says mine Auctour / that called is Dares
Fro which land / in steel armed clean
A thousand knights / came with Phylymene
The worthy king / whose sheldes out of orede
Were of querboyl / in Guydo as I read
With gold depaynte / and fret with stones rich
That in this world / I trow was none lyche
Out of the floodes / chosen by deuyse
Which have their course / out of Paradyse
The which king / a Gyaunt of stature
And of making is / passing all measure
Strong and deliver / also as I find
And fro the land / that marches upon ynde
King Porses came / with many knghtly man
And he also / that with his hand him wan
So much honor / the noble Meryon
And his brother / called Sygamon
Which from the land / of their subieccyowne
Of dukes / earls / and knights of renown
Three thousand brought / all in plates shene
With speres round / whet full quare and kene
From Ethyope / came this noble route
And from the kingdom / also out of doubt
That Teremo / of Dares called is
Came the king / full prudent and full wys
The manly man / named Theseus
And eke his sone / that hight Archylogus
A thousand knights / in their company
And Theseus / full nigh was of allye
To Pryamus / by descent of blood
And kings twain / passing rich of good
And renowned of knyghthode / as by fame
All be that Guydo / reherseth not their name
Yet in this storye / he makes mensyon
That from Agresta / the little regyon
A thousand knights / they brought unto troy
Greeks pride / to daunte and acoye
For they were chosen / and pycked for ye nones
And from the land / beyond Amazones
Lyssyny a the king / Epystrophus
So wise so worthy / and inly virtuous
Passing of counsel / and discrecyowne
And with all this / full worthy of renown
He preuyd was / also in special
And in the Artys / called lyberall
He learned was / and expert a right
Natwithstandynge / he was a worthy knight
In werre and peace / manfull and right sage
All be that he was / ron far in age
And as the storye / makes rehersayle
A thousand knights / cladde in plate and mayle
To troy town / I find that he ladde
And with him / Guydo says he had
A wonder Archer / of sight meruaylous
Of form and shap / in manner monstrous
For like mine Auctour / as I reherce can
Fro the navel up ward / he was man
And lower down / like a horse yshaped
And thylke part / that after man was maked
Of skin was black / and rough as any vere
Coueryd with here / fro cold him for to were
Passing foul / and horrible of sight
Whose eyes were / sparkelynge as bright
As a furneys / with his read leuene
Or ye lightening / yt comes down fro heuene
Dredefull of look / and reed as fire of ^here
And as I read / he was a good archere
And with his bow / both at even and morrow
Upon greeks he wrought / much sorrow
And gastyd them / with many hydous look
So stern he was / that many of them quoke
When they him saw / so ougly and horrybly
And more loathsome / than it is credyble
That many one / has wounded to the death
And caused them / to yield up the breath
On greeks side / as ye shall after here
And in this wise / assembled be yfere
Kings dukes / and Earls of renown
From sundry lands / within Troy town
That be gaderyd / and come fro so far
As says Dares / to help them in this werre
That were in nombre / as he makes mind
Two and thurty thousand / as I find
Of worthy knights / and lords of estate
That fythe / the world was fourmed and create
Ne was seen / I trow in one Cite
Togydre assembled / of so hye degree
Nor of knights / so great a multitude
And yet this / Dares sothly to conclude
In his book makes / of them nomynde
That came to Troy / out of smaler ynde
Nouther of them / most famous of renown
That were with Pryam / yborne of troy town
That finally / if it be trewely sought
Sith the hour / that this world was wrought
I dare afferme / under Phoebus spear
So many worthy / were not met yfere
Of manly men / flourynge in lustynesse
So fresshe so young / and as by lyklynesse
In every point of shape / and of arraye
For to do well / for sothely this is no nay
Who list consider / upon outher sy^e
For thorugh the world / where men go or ride
The flower of knyghthode / and of worthynesse
Of chyualrye / and of hye prowess
Assembled was without / and within
Fully assented / a werre to begin.
Wherefore ye lysters / take now good head
That you delight / in this book to read
First for how little / that this werre began
How light y^ cause / for which so many a man
Has lost his life / in myschefe pytuously
And yet no man / can beware thereby
Almost for naught / was this strife begone
And who list look / they have no thing won
But oonly death / alas the hard stounde
So many knight / caught his dethes wound
Without recure / or any remedy
And for a woman / if I shall not lie
Began all this strife / it was the more pity
That so great myschefe / or aduersyte
Of mortal slaughter / ever should tide
Better had be to have set aside
Such quarelles / dear enough a myte
To a let passyd / or the vengeance byte
For wisdom were / to cast before and se
If such sklaundres / might eschewed be
Or the venym / gonne for to ripe
For though y^ men / with horns blow and pype
When the house is fyred / in his hete
Of the sparcle / to late it is to trete
That caused all / wherefore at the gynnynge
The remedy is put / of every thing
As every wight / may deem in his reason
And while that greeks / lay at Tenedon
Them to refresshe / and to rest in pes
The worthy king / called Pallamydes
With thurty ships / out of greeks land
Stuffed with knights / full worthy of their hand
The best choice / of all his regyon
Aryued is up / at Tenedon
Whereof greeks / when they had a sight
Reioysynge them / were right glade and light
Having reward / unto his worthynesse
Where they before / had had heaviness
For his absence / that he was so long
And some of them / grutched at him strong
For he not kept his moustre / at Athene
But for to show / that he was all clean
Of any spotte / in his conscience
Full manfully / in open audyence
Like a knight / hegan himself excuse
Stoppynge all tho / that thereon list to muse
Of his absence / she wynge the cause why
That for sykenesse / and sudden malady
He was constrained / his presence to withdraw
And for they saw / that lykensse has no law
They held excused / fully his absence
And for he was / of most reverence
Among greeks / to no wight the secounde
And was also full wise / and eke habounde
Of gold and good / auyse and prudent
That what so ever / he set on his intent
Knyghtly and wisely / he would aye well acheue
And what he began / he ne would leave
Maugre his foon / in no manner wise
Till that he saw / a fine of his empryse
And for he was / most of oppynyon
Among greeks / and reputacyon
They him be^ought / that he would be
Of their counsel / auysely tose
What were to do / in every manner thing
And he assenteth / unto their axynge
Benygnely / of his gentylnesse
And greeks than / did their business
To proceed / without more delay
Them to enhaste / in all that ever they may
To gynne a sege / and differ it naught
And sundry ways / they serched have and sought
In their wits / how fro Tenedowne
They may remeue / toward troy town
From the haven / where their ships be
And some thought / most co^modyte
For most expleyt / by night pryuely
Toward troy / that stood fast by
Proudely to sail / with their ships all
And some said / great peril might fall
Toward night / for take the sea
Lest with derkenesse / they ennosed be
In their passage / knowing not the way
Whereof great harm / after fall may
And thus diverse / of oppynyon
Procedynge not / to no conclusyon
For in effect / their purpose not ne held
But still lie aye / lodged in the field
Like as they had / entryked be with dread
Till on a day / worthy Dyomede
Of the greeks / seeing the cowardyse
Even thus his counsel / began deuyse
Syres quod he / that be here now present
If that ye list / all by one assent
Goodly consydre / aduertynge prudently
What I shall say / tofore you openly
Which of knyghthode / have so noble a name
Sothly me seems / we ought have great shame
Which hold our self / so mighty and so strong
And in this land / soiourned have so long
Nygh all this year / and durst in no wise
Remeue hense / for very cowardyse
What have we do / not else certaynely
But to our foon / granted folyly
Even at their lust / space and lyberte
To make them strong / and opportunyte
Us to withstand / plainly at the hand
And so they will / ye may well understand
For day by day / to our confusyowne
They sought ways / full wisely up and down
To get them help / in the mean space
And them enforced / about in every place
Their large Cite / with barrerys and with palys
Their wall mascued / and again our skalys
Trusts thereon / made great ordinance
And with all this / of our governance
They have aspyed / seeing that for dread
We have no heart / manly to proceed
In our purpose / to hold with them werre
And aye the more / they se that we defer
The more they will / catch hardynesse
Us to resyste / with all their business
Also I se / and trust it verily
That if we had / before hand manfully
As we began / knyghtly forth continued
Our journey had / better be fortuned
If sodaynely / with strong and mighty hand
They unadvised / we had into their land
Without abode / before this time aryued
Of which a while / we must be depryued
And delayed / where first with victory
To our honor / with the palm of glory
We might sothely / ne had be our slouthe
Our will complysshed / this the playnetrouthe
Where maugre us / or we to land aryue
With strong defense / they will again us strive
And put us of / or we the stronde win
For aye the more / we tarry to begin
The more in sothe / for me list not lie
We put our self / echone in Ieopardye
What should I feign / or fage / fro the truth
For our tariynge / and our cowarde ^louthe
Are lykely after / to turn us to great sorrow
Wherefore erely / by times to morrow
My counsel is / our ankers up to pulle
In this matter / no longer that we dulle
But to enarme / our ships / for the werre
And at the up rise / of the morrow sterre
Let us ordain / with knyghtly apparayle
Out of this haven / with the wind to sail
Of manfull heart / and lusty fresshe courage
Our course holding / and our right passage
Toward Troy / and land oppedlye
What ever fall / for trust sykerlye
Without scarmousshe / we may not aryue
For they fro Troy / descend will as blyue
Like manly men / to mete us in the berde
But for all that / let us not be aferde
But void dread / and manhood set before
That cowardyse / enter at no bore
For taste the manhood / of your heart
And with that word / greeks began aduerte
The manly counsel / of this Dyomede
And in effect / to proceed in deed
Unto the point / and for nothing spare
And in what wise / anon I shall declare.

How the Greeks took land before Troy / and how they were strongely fought
with.Ca. xxi.
THe next morrow / wonderly be time
Or Phoebus up rose / long or it was p^me
When it began / full meryly to dawe
The greeks host / to shypwarde began draw
With manly heart / fully deuoyde of dread
O only thorugh comfort / of this Dyomede
But alder first / anon as they awoke
The lords wisely / their counsel took
And concluded / among them euerychone
Which of their ships / should for mest gone
And on the sea / how they should them guye
So to aryue / that no man them aspye
This was devised / at a certain mark
The night passed / at singing of the lark
Greeks be shypped / without more tariynge
Both hye and low / in the dawning
And first tofore / an hundred ships of toure
Stuffed with many / worthy warryoure
Began proudely sail / as they had in charge
And the baners / broad bright and large
Were I splayed out / upon every side
And they departed / the fomy wawes wide
That to syghte / whelmen up so grene
And next to them / for werre well enarmed clean
Another hundred / followed fast by
Which bare their sails / passyngly proudely
In which there was / full many worthy knight
Armed in mayle / and in plates bright
And after follows / hoolly their nauye
That as I trow / such a company
Of worthy kynghtes / and lords of degree
Was never before / seen upon the sea
And ^olus / was to them fortunate
And eke Neptune / made none debate
with wind nor trouble / among the stern wawes
The atempre weder / full merry to them dawes
That in a tide / as they sailed right
Of Troy town / they caughte anon a sight
Whereof in heart / full glade and light they be
But when Troyans / first their ships se
So proudely sail / a little fro the stronde
And saw how they cast them / for to land
They bode no more / but arm them hastily
In plate and mayle / and Iackes rychely
With Irous heart / and that was done anon
And took their horse / and forth in haste they gone
Out at the gates / and made no tariynge
For they ne abide / prince duke nor king
Nor other lor^e / to guide them or govern
But haste them forth / so many and so yerne
Torough out the field / so great a multitude
Among whom / were no folks rude
But manly men / thryftely be said
So clenly armed / on the large plain.
That when greeks / began them first behold
O^ the nombre / their hertes began to cold
For there was none / so manly them among
So young so fresshe / so hardy nor so strong
Of hye estate / nor of low degree
That he ne was / a stonyed for to se
The hardy troyans / so proudly down desce^de
To let Greeks / that they not assende
That they wyste / and conceive utterly
There was no mean / to aryue by
But oonly death / or manly for to fight
Or cowardely take them / to the flight
For other conduyte / plainly none there was
But sharp sword / and speres in this cas
Till sodaynely / the hardy fyerse king
Prothesylaus / which in his gouernynge
Formest of all / an hundred shyppesladde
Began haste him / for Ire that he had
To a landed first / if it would have be
To have met with them / so great desire had he
But such a wind / began in the sail drive
Of his ships / when hes hope to aryue
That he unawarely / smette upon the loud
On the gettys / and the dry sonde
That his ships / shyuered all a sonder
And some dreynt / to broke here and yonder
And devoured / of the wawy see
That it was routhe / and pity for to se
For but of hard / there might none escape
And whiles some / were belly for to take
The dry land / with fylthe and mudde ylade
Troyans of them / full cruel slaughter made
Maugre their might / greeks so constrained
That with their blood / the wawes were ystayned
So mortally / that sothely to behold
Among the sonde / pale deed and cold
The greeks lie / with wou^des fresshe and grene
And all the air / with shote of arowes kene
I shadowed was / that Phoebus bemes bright
Upon the soil / was derked of his light
And new always / Troyans them assail
That to greeks / plainly this ^yuayle
So mortal was / and so unfortunate
So vnwelfull / and disconsolate
So v^^^sposed / thorugh infelycytee
That I trow never / out of no see
(...) none host / of more hard to land
But for all that / greeks ne would wonde
For life nor death / manly to aryue
And so befelle / of adventure as blyue
Three hundred ships / that next after sewe
Auyfedly / and in time dew
Be entrede in / and haste not to fast
And stryke sail / and their ankers cast
For the werre / strongly enbatayled
In their londynge / lest they were assailed
And wisely first / they set their A^bala^ters
And their gonners / and their best archers
With pauysers / for to go aforne
Knyghtly to land / though troyans had sworn
The contrary / proudely them tolet^e
Yet for all that / fyers^y up they set
The grekysshe shote / made them to withdraw
And many of them / on the land lay slawe
That maugre them / the stronde they recure
And such as might / most manfully endure
Was set before / till they the land have take
And all attones / such assaute they make
Upon troyans / and tho began the fight
When Prothesylaus / ye noble worthy knight
Wonder lyfely / and right passing strong
With the greeks / entrede in among
The hardy troyans / and every where the^ sought
For he of arms / meruayles on them wrought
Thylke day / thorugh his worthynesse
That many troyan / he brought in distress
Where he went / they felt full vnsofte
Thorugh whose manhood / greeks were a lofte
For thy^ke day / ne hand his knight hode be
The greeks had / in great aduersyte
Be venquysshed / by fatal puru^yaunce
And finally / brought unto outtraunce
I put a back / plainly this no lie
But what a^uyleth / all his chyualrye
His worthynesse / or his fyerse courage
What might it help / or do advantage
Sith.vij. thousand greeks / had a do
With an hundred thousa^de / troyans and yet mo
It metuayle was / how they might endure
In any wise / the stronde to recure
Or so few / for to hold a field
But in themself / one thing they beheld
Full prudently / which that gave them heart
That they saw / they might not as^erte
To escape a live / if they would flee
For at their back / was no thing but the sea
And tofore them / an host so great and huge
And other way / was there no refuge
But dye attones / or fight manfully
Wherefore they cast / and shope them full knyghtly
Like rather as ma^ly men / their lives to ieoperte
Than cowardely / from their foon depart
To lose their ground / and drenchen in the sea
And thus as long / as it would be
Greeks defend them / far above their might
All be that / many were killed in this fight
That the stremes / of their read blood
Ran in the sonde / large as any flode
So cruelly / troyans on him set
With spear and sword / full sharp ground and whet
That routhe was / and pity for to think
Till they almoost / drove them to the brynke
Where the greeks / in myschefe and distress
In great anguysshe / and passyngly wer^nesse
Themself defend / maat and full ^ery
Where they should have perysshed utterly
Recurles / in sothe for evermore
Ne had Archelaus / and worthy P^otenor
From their ships / aryued unto land
Of sudden hap / with them for to stand
And yet they had / full great aduersyte
For to aryue / thorugh the cruelte
Of the troyans / but yet the land they win
And greeks than / cruelly begin
Again their foon / to stand a^ defense
With manly force / and great vyolence
And the increases / the blody werre new
That all the ^oyle / depaynt was with the dew
That first was gre^e / turned into read
On each side / so many one lay deed
Upon the ground / of his life depryued
But duke Nestor / is sodaynely aryued
With his knights fell / and full Irous
And of heart / right melancolyous
With his speres / archyers out aside
He entrede in stern / and full of pride
With sword and axe / ground sharp and kene
They ran ^fere / and met upon the grene
And hoked ^rowes / always flewe among
And (...) / to braste and turn wrong
And with they^ ^olys ^teled and well whette
The long day / they have together met
And the slaughter new / always began
(...) every half / of many worthy man
Wtih wounds large / fell and despytous
(...) Prothenor / and king Archelaus
(...) swerdes styffe / among the renges kerue
(...) many many Troyan / made for to sterue
They were that day / so passyngely Irous
And them to avenge / inly desirous
Neuce ceasing / in their pursuynge
And to releue them / Alagus the king
^londed is / and eke king Athalus
Which on Troyans / were full enuyous
(...) of Ire / as the fiery glede
And upon them / of very old hatrede
With their knights / sodaynely be fall
And in their Ire / bytterer than galle
Cruelly / they their foon oppress
And of assent / did their business
Maugre them / bakwarde to resort
Amy^de the field / as I can report
There was no choice / so they were constrained
(...) very force / and of manhood payned
To withdraw / to their confusyowne
But than in haste / down from Troy town
Of worthy knights / fresshely armed new
With deuyses / of many sundry hew
(...) abode / shortly to conclude
There came down / so great a multitude
(...) arms / depaynte upon the shield
(...) in their coming / glytereth all the field
Of their armure / as the son bright
And when that they / were entrede into fight
(...) metynge / felly by envy
They set upon / feet with melancolye
With such a will / of heart and courage
With such furye / in their mortal rage
That unto accord / was none other mean
But slaughter and death / them to go between
Thorugh stroke of axe / of dagger and of spear
That of force / coacte the greeks were
To return bakwarde / to the stronde
To whose rescuse / anon there come to land
The king vlyxes / with his hole nauye
And full knyghtly / with his chyualrye
Toward Troyans / enhasteth him anon
And of one heart / the greeks with him gone
And their courage / holly they resume
And began their foon / felly to consume
Unto the death / their damage to revenge
That no wight may / justly them challenge
Of manhood so well / they have them bor^e
To quyte again / their harms done before
At which time / like a fyersly own
Among Troyans / rengynge up and down
Vltxes went / with his sword in hand
He kylleth sleeth / and knyghtly began to sonde
Thylke day / like a man be found
And here and there / with many mortal wound
Upon Troyans / he wrought all this wrack
Them berynge down / on foot and on horse back
In his Ire / his strokes were so kene
At which time / worthy Phylomene
Lord and king / of Paffogonye
When he beheld / with his company
So many Troyan / of vlixes slawe
Tawardes him anon / he began him draw
On horse back / and with a spear round
Out of his sadell / bare him to the ground
But vlixes rose / up anon right
Taking his horse / like a manly knight
The which anon / as Phylomene has said
Took efte aspere / and rode to him again
So myghtely / and with such vyolence
That finally / there gayneth no diffence
But that he smote him / even thorugh y^ shield
The which flewe / a sondre in the field
And thorughe his plates / without any fail
The spear head ran / and rested in the mayle
That forged was / of stele full shene and bright
Which to perce / the spear head has no might
So trewely made / was the hawberiowne
But with that stroke / vlixes was bore down
Yet efte again / but he up rose anon
Which of his stroke / harm ne felt none
And raughte a spear / sharp whet and ground
And Phylomene / he gave such a wound
With all the might / of his arms twain
Of Irous heart / with so great a pain
That thorugh his shield / both place and mayle
He smote him up / thorugh his auentayle
Into the gorge / that the stock began glyde
That from his horse / he fell down a side
Full perryllously pyght / upon his head
His knights wenynge / sothly he were deed
Which took him up / and laid him on a shield
And bare him home / in haste out of the field
With great danger / or they might him wy^ne
Thorugh the greeks / with their lord to twy^ne
And for Troyans / supposed sykerly
That Phylomene / without remedy
Had be deed / they were astoned all
That if this case / that day ne had fall
Of Physomene / greeks on the stronde
^^dde be outrayed / aryuynge up to land
Thorughe the knyghthode / this is douteles
Of Phylomene / whom that vlixes
V^ho^sed has / with a mortal wound
In knyghtly wise / Troyans to confound
Whereof they were / astoned euerychon
But tho as than / and Agamenon
Of greks ooste / lord and Emperor
Aryued is / unto their socour
With all his knights / and Menelaus
And eke the worthy / Thelamonyous
Called Ayax / is to land come
And they at leyser / have their horse nome
While other greeks / Troyans occupye
Sor^ fighting / and they began fast hye
Toward them / making no delay
All in a frusshe / in all haste they may
They ran Yfere / and their speres bracke
With heart enuyous / upon horse back
There might men / the worthy knights se
On their stedes / each at other flee
With styffe swerdes / shaftes great and round
With hedes square / the points kene ground
There might men se / in their furyous tene
So many knights / deed upon the grene
But most the slaughter / and confusyowne
Fell thylke time / of them of the town
The greeks were / so mighty and so strong
And in the field / this contynueth long
Till Prothesilaus / the strong mighty king
Which all the day / in skarmysshe and fyghtyng
Full like a knight / had occupied be
Again Troyans / in his cruelte
Of manhood oonly / and of worthynesse
Of adventure / in his werynesse
Him to refresshe / and to take air
And to a brethe him / maked his repeyre
To the stronde / where he did aryue
Where as he thought / his heart began toryue
Of cruel ire / and alfo of pity
That he caughte / oonly for to se
His men lie slain / end long the stronde
And some of them / coming up to the land
Dreynt in the sea / among the floodes deep
For which thing / he began anon to weep
Full pyteuosly / all were it not espied
Whose woeful eyes / might not be dried
For the constreynt / which sat sonye his heart
Till at the last / among his pains smerte
So cruel Ire / began his heart enbrace
That sodaynely / with a despytous face
Without abode / thought how that he
Upon their death / would avenged be
Or finally attones / with them deye
And on his stead / he took the right weye
Toward his foon / full Irous in his rage
And line right / he holds his passage
Swyfte as grayhounde / y^ renneth out of lees
And where he saw / that was grettest prees
He preceth thorugh / amyddes of the field
And with the sword / which in his hand he held
That ground was / to kerue and to byte
Full mortally / about him he began smite
That Troyans / might him not asterte
Some he ryueth / even to the heart
And some he wounds / sothely to the death
And some he made / yield up the breath
And he vnhorseth / some cruelly
And whom he met / that day utterly
From his horse / he made him to alyght
For where he rode / they fled out of his sight
And his presence / as the death eschew
But ever in one / he began after sewe
In his chase / like as a wood lion
This play he plays / with them of the town
Till Perseus / of Ethyopye king
From ye Cite / came sodaynely riding
With many a knight / and many lyfely man
At whose coming / of new there began
A fresshe skarmysshe / furyous and wood
That many greek / that day lost his blood
So fell assaute / Troyans on them make
Among them / the Ethyopyes blake
So manly bare them / fighting here and there
That where Troyans / were before in fere
(...) be / and of new assured
y^ thorugh their help / they have y^ field recured
And made them lose / also much again
As they tofore / won on the plain
For they so hole / and so myghtely
Kept them togydre / and so auysely
Governed them / with pauys spear and shield
That greeks were / compelled in the field
Maugre who so grutche / of necessyte
To the sironde / backewarde for to flee
Almost dispayred / mate and comforteles
But in that while / king Pallamydes
To their rescous / come to arryuayle
And lusty fresshe / enters in battle
With his knights / and his hole maynee
Taking their horse / fast by the sea
And full proudely / enbusshed all attones
With spear and sword / ygrou^de for the nones
By conueyinge / of their worthy coming
Have so oppressed / at their in coming
The manly Troyans / that it was a wonder
To se them lie slain / here and yonder
And this contynueth / till among the prees
Of adventure / that Pallamydes
Brennynge aye / in his furyoushete
Amyd the field / happeth for to mete
A worthy knight / called Sygamon
Which brother was / to the king Menon
(...) also / as Guydo does reherce
This manly man / to the king Perce
Which greeks had / that day sore opressed
By his knyghthode / as it is expressed
For he the greeks / to his worthynesse
Had often brought / in full great distress
The same day / to his great encrees
^ut of Fortune / alas Pallamydes
As I you told / has in the field him met
And with aspere square / and sharp whette
When he of knyghthode / was most i^ his pride
He rode at him / and smote him thorugh y^ side
And with that / last dedely fatal wound
From his stead / he bare him to the ground
And on the plain / of his blood all read
(...) ^^amydes / left him pale and deed
Among them / that of Troy were
And forth he rode / and bare down here and there
All that ever / in his way stood
He was on them / so furyous and wode
Maugre Troyans / tofore him on the plain
Made resort / to the wall again
His manly knights / always fast by
On him awaytynge / full ententyfely
Ready to hand / at every great empryse
But tho began / the noise to arise
The woeful clamor / and the pyteous cry
Of them of Troy / the which utterly
Again greeks / might not sustene
The mortal sword / was so sherpe and kene
Of the noble worthy / famous knight
Pallamydes / that with his great might
The long day / has yborne him so
Again his foon / and so knyghtly do
In his person / thorugh his hye renown
That chaced has / almost to the town
Troyans echone / manly made to fle
The noise of whom / is entered in the Cite
The hydous cry / and the mortal shoute
Whereof ameued Ector / yssueth out
Furyously / in all the haste he can
The sone of mars / this knight this ma^ly man
Of all worthy / yet the worthyest
That ever was / and the hardyest
For as Phoebus / with his bemysclere
Among sterres / so did appear
Excellynge all / in steel armed bright
On whom it was / a very heavenly sight
For it was he / that both nigh and far
Of worthynesse was / the lode sterre
The which / when he entered into field
Like as I read / bare that day a shield
The shield of which / was of pure gold
With three lions / in storye as I told
Of whose color / is made no mencyon
But as I find / by description
They were passant / if I report a right
Borne on the breast / of this Troyan knight
That was the ground and rote / of hye prowess
And flower accounted / of all worthynesse
The which so manly / without more abode
Among his knights / to the greeks rode
So like a man / that they in his coming
A stoned were / as he began in thrynge
Among them / which kylleth down and slethe
And whom he met / there was not but death
Before his sword / greeks go to wrake
And their wards / of knyghtly force he brake
And maugre them / severed them a sonder
And bare all down / riding here and yonder
And casuelly / he meteth in his way
Prothesylaus / which all the long day
Had sore fought / against them of Troy
And slew all tho / that come in his way
This hardy knight / this worthy fyers king
Which on Troyans / was ever pursuynge
He to them had / so hertely great envy
The which thing / when Ector began espy
And of his knyghthode / began to take heed
Toward him / he began to reyne his stead
And line right / of hasty Ire he rode
And with his sword / disteyned all with blood
He cloue his head / thorugh his basenet
With such a might / y^ his stroke ne was let
By force of mayle / nor of thycke plate
But finally / by full mortal fate
The sword of Ector / through nerf bone and vain
This worthy king / parted has on twain
For utterly / there gayneth none armure
Again the stroke of Ector / to endure
But that this king / so full of worthynesse
Strong and mighty / and of great hardynesse
Received has / his last fatal wound
And lies now deed / parted on the ground
And Ector forth among / the greeks ride
And who so ever / that his stroke abide
Refute was none / nor diffence but death
And many greek / that day he sleth
For which of them / in his way stood
His sharp sword / he batheth in his blood
That also far / as they might him se
As the death / from his sword they fle
So mortal vengeafice / upon them he wrought
And many greek / at his fellow sought
And began enquere / what he might be
For all their life / they could never se
None so knyghtly / behave him in battle
And plainly dempte / as be supposayle
It was Ector / the noble warryour
Which of knyghthode / may bear away y^ flour
Among all / that ever yet were borne
For there was no greek / yt hy^ may stand aforne
Of all that day / he began them so enchace
To the stronde / even before his face
For they ne durst / his mortal stroke abide
And when he had / upon every side
The greeks chaced / to the wawy see
Wounded and mate / in great aduersytee
Than hy^ to rest / this Troyan knight anon
Like Mars himself / home to Troy is gone
AT whose partynge / greeks e^t presume
Manly again / their hertes to resume
And of new / their foomen to assail
And to Iuparte / if it would avail
Life and death / to set at outraunce
On fortune / if she would auaunce
Their part again / in recure of the field
And them enforce / with might of spear and shield
Anon forthwith / and make no delay
To win again / on Troyans if they may
For.viij. times / sythen they begone
The field they have / that day lost and won
Like as fortune / list to do their cure
Up or down / for to turn her eure
For as her whele / went about round
Right so that day / they wan and lost their ground
But specially / they were most desmayde
When Ector came / which has the^ so outrayde
Through his knyghthod / made their heart / tyue
And to resort / where they did aryue
And thus continued / maugre all their might
While in the field / was this Troyan knight.
Till Phoebus chare / began to westre down
That he repeyred is / into the town
Which had greeks / wrought before full ylle
But now the hardy / cruel fyers Achylle
Aryued is / with his knights all
Myrondones / whom men are wont to call
Which from the sea / taken has the plain
At whose coming / greeks have again
The field recured / and put themself in prees
O only thorugh help / of worthy Achylles
Which is so felly / Troyans fall upon
That he of them / has slain full many oon
For three thousand / in steel armed bright
With him he brought / ready for to fight
Knights echone / full worthy of renown
Which with Achylles / greeks champyowne
Have mercyles / in their cruelte
Slain many troyan / out of the Cite
They were so fervent / in their mortal Ire
So enuyous / of hate to desire
New and new / for to shede theyrblode
For Achylles thought / it did him good
That his sword / troyans blood to shede
And on the soil / to se them lie and blede
Rowteles / in his melancolye
For he to them / has so hot envy
Without their death / that it may not quench
And he his sword / full deep made drenche
The long day / in Troyans blood
And batheth it / as it werein a flode
Which forged was / and I whette so kene
That many river / for hely on the grene
Ran here and there / of hurtes sore
And with his knights / always more and more
Pursued them / before him as they flee
To the walls of Troy / the cytee
Where they made / a full pyteous cry
And in this while / I find in the storye.
The greeks host / hoolly is aryued
Like in Guydo / as it is descryued
Of men of arms / such a multitude
And of knights / shortly to conclude
That from their ships / of new landed be
That troyans / astoned were to se
And abashed / they began wexe all
For sodaynely / they began on them fall
On every half / passyngly great prees
And ever in one / this hardy Achylles
With his sword / made their sides read
For here and there / lay the bodies deed
And wounded some / at enter of the gate
And knyghtly there / with them he began debate
And furyously / this fell cruel knight
The children slew / in their faders sight
That to behold / it was full great pity
And yet the slaughter / gretter had be
Without nombre / of them of the town
Perpetuelly / to their confusyowne
Lykely for ever / to have be overcome
If Troylus / ne had unto rescuse come
Young fresshe and lusty / and inly desirous
With whom come eke / Paris and Dephebus
And many worthy / their party to socoure
So that greeks / tho ne might endure
Against them / to stand at deffence
For all their pride / nor make resystence
Worthy Troylus / so well yt time him quytte
For thus in sothe / what greek that he hytte
Outher he maymeth / or he made deye
Wherefore as death / they fled out of his weye
And Achylles / with his company
For it was night / homewarde began him hye
Toward greeks / with glory and great honor
And they receive him / like a Conqueroure
That which he had / so well Ymet
And they of troy / have their gates shet
And made the^ strong / thorughout al y^ town
And in this time / king Agamenowne
Ycherched has / a place couenable
Which him thought was / most a greable
By lyklyed / and most conuenyent
For every lord / to set his tente
And in a field / of full large space
Most competent / as for lodging place
In dew sight / set for the Cite
Each lord was sygned / where he should be.
And began anon / ordain mansyons
Pytched their tents / and Pauyllyons
And such as might / no Centoryes have
From storm and rain / themself for to save
They devised / other habytacles
Tugurryes / and small Receptacles
To shroude them in / and all the night also
From their ships / they had much a do
Or they might have / their horse to land
And to ordain / where they should stand
And they also / besy were to carye
Other things / that were necessary
And nedefully / unto a sege long
And eke they made / tey their ships strong
For in the port / their ankres cast
And of assent / they besyed them full fast
For to conferme / of one entenciowne
To set a sege / to Troy town
And thereupon / by bound assured fast
For to abide / while their life many last
Finally / without repentance
And prudently / they made their ordinance
As they best could / all the long night
They beat their fyres / which bren wonder light
And at a space / divided fro the fyres
They set up / in manner of bares
And round about / where their lodging was
They paled them / all the field compass
And to acheue / the fine of their purpose
They felly wrought / and kept them self aye close
And the king / that no treason fall
Let make watch / without his tents all
Of them that had / rested them before
And his mynstrellys / he made ouermore
As says Guydo / all the long night
To keep their tides / tofore the fyres bright
Meryly to sown / their Instruments
And them he made / rest in their tents
That had before / weary be of fight
And in the sea / were faynted of their might
And other eke / he made in their armure
Awayte wisely / again all adventure
That no disceyte / were found on no side
And thus this king / knyghtly can provide
In his advise / that nothing him escape
And all the night / I find he did wake.
Till on the morrow / that the rows read
Of Phoebus chare / gonne for to sprede
And thus each king / desposed as it ought
I will proceed to tell how / they wrought
Ceryously without / and within
With your supporte / the third book begin.
Here begins the Third Book / That tells how the Troy ans issued out on
the morrow and fought with the Greeks / and how valyauntly Ector bare himself
that day. Capitulo.xxij.
When Aurora / with her pale light
Under y^ mantel / of y^ myrke night
And the curtyne / of her hewes fade
Yshroudyde was / in ye derke shade
Abashed rody / as I can desire
Oonly of her / that is Femynyne
For ashamed / durst not be seyne
Because she had / so long a bed leyne
With fresshe Phoebus / her own chosen knight
For which she hid her / sothely out of sight
Till his stead / that called is Flegonte
Enhasted him / above our Oryzonte
And Appollo / with his bemys clear
Has recomforted her oppressed chere
This to say / after the dawning
When Tytan was / in Eest rysynge
Of his hete atempre / and right soft
Her Emysperye / for to glade a lofte.
The same hour / the Troyan champyowne
Governor of werres / of the town
Worthy Ector / which in the Cite
Next Pryam had of all / the souereynte
The town to guide / by knyghtly excellence
For his manhood / and his sapyence
Of Troyan knights / lord and eke cheuetayne
Which has commanded / in a large plain
To hye and low / he exceptynge none
Kings / Pryces / and lords euerychone
The same morrow for to mete Yfere
In their arraye / to mustre and apere
Like as they were / of name and of estate
Beside a temple / whylom consecrate
To the goods / that called is Dyane
Most honored in this rich faane
There to array them / in all the haste they can
Like the deuyse / of this knyghtly man
And this plain passing fair to se
Was set amydde / of Troy the Cite
Smothe and right fair / and full of fresshe flowers
Where all the worthy / noble werryoures
Of troy town togydre assembled be
And many other / to behold and se
The famous knights / arm them in y^ place
And some of them / began full streyte lace
Their doublettes made / of lynnen clothe
A certain fold / that about him gothe
And some also dempte most sureste
To (...) them / for battle of ar^ste
And did on first / after their desires
Sabatous greues cussues with voydres
A pair breche / alder first of mayle
And some there were / eke that ne would fail
To have of mayle / a pair bras
And therwithall / as the custom was
A payregussettes / on a pety cote
Garnysshed with gold / up unto the throat
A paunce of plate / which of the self behind
Was shet and close / and thereon as I find
Enuyron was / abordure of small mayle
And some chose / of the new entayle
For to be surmyd / of all their foos
An hole breast plate / with arere doos
Behind shet / or else on the side
And on his arms / rynged not to wide
There were voyders / frettyd in the mayle
With cords round / and of fresshe entayle
Vambras with wings / and rerebras thereto
And thereon set / were besaguys also
Upon the head / a basenet of stele
That within / locked was full well
A crafty sight / wrought in the vyser
And some would have / of plate a bauer
That on the breast / fastened be aforne
The canell piece / more esy to be borne
Gloves of plate / of stele forged bright
And some would / armed be more light
In thykkes Iackes / covered with satyne
and some would have / of mayle wrought full fine
An hawberion / all of late wrought cassade
That with weyghte / he be not over lade
Hymsefe to welde / like a lyfly man
And some will have / of choce geseran
On his doublet / but an hawberion
And some oonly / but a sure gepon
Over his poleyns / rechynge to thekne
And that the ^^euys / eke so long be
That his vambras / may be cured ner
A pryckynge palet / of plate the cower
And some will have / also no vyser
To save his face / but oonly anaser
And some will have / a pair platys light
To welde him well / when that he shall fight
And some will have / a target or a spear
And some a pauys / his body for to were
And some a targe made / strong to last
And some will have / darts / for to cast
Some a pollax / heded of fine stele
And pycked square / for to last well
And some a sword / his enemy for to mete
And some will have / a bow for to shete
Some an arblast / to stand out aside
And some on foot / and some for to tide
Array themsesfe / their foomen for to sail
And many one was / besy for to nail
His felawes harneys / for to make it strong
And to dress / it sytte not wrong
With points / tresshes / and other manner thing
That in such case / longs to armynge
I have no conning / every thing to tell
And unto you / were to long to dwell
Where I fail / ye mot have me excused
For in such craft / I am little used
And ignorance / does my pen let
In their order / my termys for to set
And often changes / such harneys and deuyse
And ye that be therein / expert and wise
Dysdayne not / that I speak in this place
Of their armynge / for all is in your grace
Right at your list / to correct every dell
And when Ector saw / that all was well
And every armed / and arrayed
This worthy knight / no longer has delayed
Aduysely his wards / for to make
And prudently / badde they should take
Their ground in haste / to put all in certain
And stand in order / endelonge the plain
So that no man / were found recheles
And the gate called / Dardanydes
Without abode / Ector made vnshette
And after bad / that men should fette
To his presence / that it were done in haste
Cyncynabor / his brother borne in baste
And unto him / first of euerychon
And to a lord / that named was Glaucon
The kings sone / of Lycye and his heir
With many baner / displayed in the air
To this two / Ector gave the guarde
And governance / of the first ward
In which he has / a thousand knights set
With speres round / and swerdes kene whette
And on their breast / full many rich shield
And they werechosen out / in all the field
Among the best / that endure might
Again greeks / manly for to fight
And unto them / Ector bad anon
In gods name / that they should gone
Out at the gate / sothely as I read
And ie^te they fylle / in myschefe or in need
He assygned / in the self place
With manly chere / to the king of Trace
Wisely on him / to be awaytynge
A thousand knights / to have at his ledynge
In a wenge knyghtly / for to abide
To wait on him / upon every side
And with him / was his sone Archylogus
Of his age / a man right virtuous
To fulfylle / that longs to a knight
For both he had heart / and also might
And next to them / Ector began deuyse
The next ward / to the king of Fryse
That in his time / called zantipus
And unto him / young strong and desirous
He assygned to wait / on his vanere
Three thousand knights / armed bright and clear
With which ward / king Alchomus also
Of Ector / was commanded for to go
And to his bidding / he mekely did obey
And full knyghtly / they have take their weye
Out at the gate / passyngly arrayed
Toward greeks / with baners fresshe displayed
And their penons / vnrolled euerychone
And after Ector assygned / has anon
To the noble / young lusty free
His brother Troylus / so fresshe upon to se
Which in knyghthode / had all suffysaunce
The third ward / to have in governance
With.iii. thousand knights / young of age
Flourynge in force / hardy of courage
Such as he was / of custom wont to lead
To whom Ector / of very bretherhede
Full goodly spoke and said / at his departing
Brother quod he / my heart is so loving
Toward the / of very kyndenesse
That though I have / in party great gladness
Of thy manhood / that so far is kouthe
And the knyghthode / of thy grene youth
Yet douteles / in my fantasye
Full often a day / I stand in Iupardye
Of pensyfehede / and in ward besy dread
When I remember / upon thy manhede
Lest thy courage / be to vyolent
Of thy life / to be neclygent
Thy self to put / to far in adventure
Of surquydrye / so much to assure
In thy force / kynghtly to a sterte
Every peril / in thy manfull heart
Having no reward / in such mortal strife
Of wylfulnesse / nouther to death nor life
Nor aduertence / to thy sauacyowne
But as fortune / turns up and down
Her whele meuable / hye and after low
In Martys Ire / as the wind does blow
Which causes me / full often syghe and think
And to wake / when I should wynke
Reuoluynge / aye thy hasty wylfulnesse
But gentle brother / for any hardynesse
Thus ylke day / upon every side
I pray the so wisely / to provide
For hate or ire / thy foos pursuynge
Not to excede / more than is sitting
But let prudence / the keep in a mean
And wisdom eke / hold again the reyne
Of thy heart / and thy fyers courage
That fyred have / thy grene tender age
Deuoyde of dread / each peril to endure
That our enemies / of thy mysauenture
Reioysenat / mine own brother dear
And mighty mars / I pray of heart entere
Thus every day / on Troyans ground
From their hands / the to keep sound
Like as I would / that he did me
To whom / anon with all humylyte
In manly wise / this young iusty knight
This worthy Troylus / of heart fresshe and light
Answered again / and said with glad chere
Mine own lord / and my brother dear
And god to fore / I fully shall obey
To fulfylle / what you list to seye
Now unto me / of your gentyllesse
And not declyne / thorugh none reklesnesse
In any point / from your commandment
But with hole heart / in all my best intent
I shall take heed / and plainly do none other
Than ye have said / mine own lord and brother
So loathe me were / offend you or grieve
And in this wise / he lowly took his leave
And forth herod / so like a manly knight
That to behold / it was a noble sight
Among his men / he behaueth him so well
Three thousand knights / armed in bright stele
Enuyron rode / with Troylus into field
And that day / he bare in his shield
Passant of gold / iij. lions rychely
The chaumpe of asure / wrought full craftily
And by the gate / he issued out anon
And with him ladde / his knights euerychone
To the greeks / holding the next way
And Ector hastes / all that ever he may
Prudently / his wards to ordain
And to the noble / worthy brethren twain
To king Hupon / and to Ardelaus
He assygned / the storye tells thus
The fouthe ward / to guye and to wysse
And in the land / that called was larysse
The brethren two / had reigned long
And king Hupon / was passyngly strong
And of stature / like a chaumpyowne
And save Ector / in all Troy town
Was none to him / egall as of might
More delyuere / nor a better knight
And on his foon / passing despytous
Which with his brother / called Ardelaus
Four thousand knights / had for to lead
And seven thousand / sothly as I read
And to them like / as writ Guydo
Worthy Ector / assygned has also
One of his brethren / called Brymarchus
A noble knight / in arms right famous
And had in manhood / passing excellence
And of Ector / they taken have license
And rode their way / among all the prces
Thorughe the gate / of Dardanydes.
The fyfte ward / to have at his ledynge
Was by Ector / committed to the king
That of Cesoyne lord / and prince was
And to his brother / called Pollydamas
And Cysones / were of hye stature
And mighty in arms / passyngly endure
Upon whom / full many man beheld
And their king / bare no thing in his shield
But a field of Gowlys / as I find
Of other sign / Guydo makes no mind
And forth he rode / a full stern pas
This noble king / and Pollydamas
When they had / of Ector leave take
Which ever in one / full besy was to make
The sixte ward / with all his dylygence
And to the king / called Pretemense
That was full worthy / both in werre and pees
And to a Duke / that hight Sterepes
Which was also / full worthy of his hand
He took the folk / of Pauonye land
Them to govern / in the field that day
The which people / has in custom aye
Without plate / hawberion or mayle
On swyfte horse / their foomen for to assail
With mighty bows / and arrows sharp ground
Thorugh an harneys / mortally to wound
And with this folk / of Ector eke also
Deyphebus / assygned was to go
In the field / to guide them and to lead
And on their way / they fast began them speed
But or they pass / by Dardanydes
Full discrtely / Ector for them chees
Pauyseres / cladde in mayle and plate
Them co^maundynge / at yssynge of the gate
And with the Archers / into field to gone
And many worthy / well armed euerychone
To awayte on them / that they were not lore
For this folk / that I of spoke tofore
Of Pauonye / had none armure
But prudent Ector / for to make them sure
Out of Agrest / the mighty regyowne
Has chosen out / full worthy of renown
The best knights / of them euerychon
And with two kings / Esdras and Phyon
Assygned them / for to take heed
To the fotemen / when that they have need
The which Phyon / made full rychely
Rode in a chare / all of Yuory
Of which the wheles / wrought full curyous
Were of a tree / Ycalled Ebenus
The which tree / grows far in ynde
Black of hew / and also as I find
When it is korue / this tree will wexe anon
Of his nature / hard as any stone
When it is grave / either round or square
And of pure gold / roued was this chare
Fret with perle / and many rich stonys
That such a another / I trow now there none is
In all this world / it I shall not feign
And it was ladde / of mighty knights twain
Men of arms / within and without
Armed in steel / riding round about
This worthy kings / Esoras and Phyon
And Ector has called / to him anon
One of his brethren / what so that be fall
To be guide / and leder of them all.
The name of whom / was Pyktagoras
And to the great / Troyan Eneas
Of whom tofore / made is mencyon
Ector / by good delyberacyon
The.vij. ward / assygned has to keep
And upon stedys / lusty for to lepe
Of such as were / used much to ride
Full manly knights / to houe by his side
Which with Emphranye / unto Troy town
Come so far / from their regyowne
To fostre them / for Ectors sake
And when they had / of him leave take
They rode full proudely / forth with Eneas
Out at the gate / a wonder knyghtly pas
The broad field / till they have atteyned
And in this while / Ector has ordained
Like mine Auctour / as I can reherce
The eight ward / of the folk of Perce
Worthy knights / manly and right wise
The which were / committed to Paryse
On him that day / to awayte besyly
To whom Ector / full benyngnely
Spoke and said / at his departing
O brother mine / in all manner thing
When thou art passed / by Dardanydes
This day to far / put the not in prees
Among greeks / nor in Iupardye
Lest thy foon / in myschefe the espy
To whom they have / of old and new date
In their hertes full fresshe / and mortal hate
The fire of which / their breast has so enbraced
That it were hard / out to be arraced
Wherefore brother / look that thou be
In all wise / not to far fro me
But keep the nigh / that no mysauentoure
Fall upon the / so that I may socoure
This day to the / mine own brother dear
To whom Paris / with full humble chere
Answered and said / that in every thing
He would obey / unto his bidding
And rode his way / anon with his meyne
Into the field / out of the Cite
And Ector / aye did his business
The nynthe ward / in order for to dress
Which he thought / himself for to lead
In which he put / sothly as I read
Five thousand knights / borne of troy town
The worthyest / and grettest of renown
And passyngly famous / in knyghthode
Borne by descent / of troyans blood.
And of his brethren / he took with him ten
Such as he knew / for most manly men
That were forayne / fro stock of regallye
Out of the line / borne in bastardye
Whom Ector had / in great chyerte
For the knyghthode / he could in themse
And when he had / by knyghtly purueaunce
All his wards set / in governance
Like Mars himself / fast began him speed
Without abode / for to take his stead
Which was in books / called Gallathe
Of all horse / having the soueraygnete
As far as men / ride in any cost
Of whom Dares / makes so great a boste
Of shape of hyghte / and also of fayrenesse
Of strength of look / and of great swyftenesse
So like an horse / performed out and out
And with a wire / men might him turn about
Like as Dares / makes mencyowne
Of whom Ector / rode thorugh troy town
Armed at all / that came him wonder well
From foot to head / full rychely euerydell
That shone as bright / as son on summers day
And to pryam / he held the right way
And when that he / was come to the king
He reherseth / in order every thing
How he has done / and all his ordinance
And lowly said / so it be pleasaunce
To your noble / royal excellence
I have chosen / with besy dylygence
A thousand knights / full of suffysaunce
With five houndred / to have attendaunce
On your person / always where ye be
With all footmen / that be in the Cite
That shall awayte / on you ever in one
Wherefore my lord / as fast as we are gone
Lowly I pray / to your worthynesse
To sewe us / by good aduysenesse
Out at the town / always eke that ye
Togydre keep / your knights and meyne
This I beseech / with all my full might
Within the bounds / where as we shall fight
That ye suffer none / of them pass
But keep ye hole / in the self place
At wyxe us / and this strong Cite
If we have need / that ye may aye se
Us to releue / keeping you aside
And specially there / for to abide
Where most is lyckely / our party to sustene
For ever among / there shall men go between
Of our expleyt / the truth to report
For which part / Mars list the field to sort
Of his power / this ylke day fatalle
For ye shall be / our castle and our wall
And our refuge / to save us from all smerte
And specially / one thing ye aduerte
That no disceyte / fraud nor treasowne
Compassyd be behind / to the town
Of our foon / thorugh our reklesnesse
Whiles that we do / our business
Against them / in the field to fight
In all wise / thereto has a sight
That no thing turn / unto our damage
Though our engyne / but work as the sage
With victory / that we may conclude
So that greeks / with fraud us not delude
By no engyne / of un ware vyolence
Hoping always / that it is none offense
To your hyghnes / that I have here said
And with that word / Pryamus in abrayde
Benyngnely of chere / and countenance
And said Ector / my sothfast suffysaunce
My fynall trust / and supportacion
In thy wise / disposycion
Hoolly I put / as thou list ordain
For next god / if I shall not feign
My faith my hope / and all my sykernesse
And my welfare / in very sothfastnesse
Committed behole / into thy hand
And governance / plainly of my land
As thou ordaynest / it must needs be
And this prayer / I make now for the
To the gods / above celestyall
The to preserve / in party and in all
From each myschefe / and aduersyte
That thou may home / to this Cite
Repair in honor / with laud and victory
So that the praise / renown and memory
Of thy name be put / in remembrance
Perpetuelly / thine honor to auaunce
And fare now well / mine own sone dear
And Ector tho / with full humble chere
His leave took / and forth he rode anon
Among his lords / and knights euerychone
As he that was rote / of all noblesse
Of knyghthod ground / of strength and hardynesse
The very stock / and thereto inuyncyble
For asmoche / as it was possible
That nature might him grant / or kind
Touching manhood / in books as I find
He had in him / soueraygne excellence
And governance / medlyd with prudence
That naught a sterte hy^ / he was so wise and ware
And in his shield / I find that he bare
Upon his breast / this Troyan champyon
The chief of gold / of Gowlys alyon
Depeynt therm / and in his baner beat
The self same / and so amydde the street
He took the way / to Dardanydes
That to behold / huge was the prees
Noise of trumpettes / and of claryons
Baners vnrolled / and long fresshe penons
Of read and white / grene blewe and blake
And in this wise / Ector has I take
The field without / with heart and hole intent
As Mars himself / had be present
And they that he / as Guydo makes mind
Rode with the ward / that lafte was behind
Of his manhood / he would not abide
But smote his stead / sherpely in the side
Of fell courage / he has his horse so payned
The first ward / that he has attained
By vale and hylle / to fore in the frounteres
Not astoned / of the fell cheres
Of the greeks / nor platly not aferde
But like a knight / even before their berde
He began prease in / as their foo mortal
And in this while / upon Troy wall
In sundry place / on the hye toures
As fresshe besene as May / is with his flowers
The ladies be ascended / of the town
So fair so young / stondynge enuyrowne
The queen Eleyne / passing fair to seen
The kings doughtres / and goodly Polycene
And many other / which of womanhede
In heart were / full of besy dread
Inly a gaste / and of fere a frayde
When they beheld / in the field displayde
The broad baners / that some of tenderness
Some of love / and some of kyndenesse
Pale and dredefull / for their lords were
And some their faces / hid eke for fere
That were not bold / to lift up their sight
To behold the armure / clear and bright
So glyterynge / again the son shene
Their hertes tender / might not sustene
And in their dread / thus I ^ette them dwell
ANd of greeks / forth I shall you tell
If so be / ye list / abyoe a while
For now must I / my fordulled style
Again direct / to Agamenon
Well may I make / an exclamacyon
On ignorance / that stands so in my light
Which causes me / with a full clowdy sight
In my making / to speak of the werre
For lack of terms / I must needs err
Connyngely / my wards for set
Cruel Allector / is besy me to let
The nyghtes daughter / blinded by derkenesse
By craft of arms / the truth to express
In order dew / a field to descryue
And Chauncer now / alas is not alive
Me to refourme / or to be my read
For lack of whom / slower is my speed
The noble Rethor / that all did excelle
For in making / he drank of the well
Under Pernaso / that the muses keep
On which hylle / I might never sleep
Uneath slombre / for which alas I plain
But for all this / there is no more to said
Though my wede / be not Polymyte
Colors forth / I will endyte
As it comes / even to my thought
Plainly to write / how y^ kynghath wrought
The manly knight / great Agamenon
Like as the Latin / makes mencyou.
What troweye / that he in his intent
Was found slow / outher neclygent
On greeks half / his wards for to make
Nay nay not so / for him list to wake
That time more / sothly than to sleep
For like a king / that day the field to keep
No neclygence / might his heart fade
For in that day / I find that he made
Six and twenty wards / by and by
So well devised / and so prudently
That no man might / amend his ordinance
And of the first / he gave governance.
To the manfull / noble Patroclus
That with him ladde / mine Auctour tells thus
Myrundones / so mighty and so strong
With all the folk / that to Achylles long
Beside thylke / that were of his meyne
Which that he brought / out of his country
At his coming / to the sege of Troy
And he rode forth / with them on his way
Into the field / and made no delay
Now fill it so / on the same day
That Achylles kept him / in his tente
And for sykenesse / that day out ne went
For his lechesse / made him to abstene
For his wounds / fresshe were and grene
That he caught / on the day tofore
Which for to hele / of their akynge sore
He by counsel / kept himself close
And from his bed / that day not ne rose
In hope oonly / the bettre to endure
When that he was / restored unto cure
But all his men / he took to Patroclus
Which was marmes / passyngely famous
And be descent / come of great kynrede
And was also / of him as I read
Haboundaunt of gold / and of richesse
And far commended / for his gentyllesse
And had a name / of hye discresyon
Now were they aye / of such affection
Of entyer love / truth and faythfulnesse
So great desire / and inward kyndenesse
Besy thenkynge / and so great feruence
So much frenshyp / and thoughtfull aduertence
So huge brennynge / passing amerous
Betwyxe Achylles / and this Patroclus
That their hertes were / locked in a chain
And what so ever / if I shall not feign
The ton has wrought / as brother unto brother
In heart it was / confermed of the the other
For will and goods / both were comune
And to the death / they ever so contune
Without change / their love so abode
And Patroclus / forth anon him tode
Into the field / with Myrundones
And in his tente / abyteth Achylles
The second ward / to king Meryon
Assygned was / by Agamenon.
And to the worthy king / Ydumenee

Was assygned / and to the king Elyde
With many worthy / riding by his side
Of the prouynce / and the famous Isle

And the third / called Daryus

That sothely was / both of berthe and line
So renowned / and of so great increase

And duke Nestor / full famous in knyghthode
The.xij. ward / ladde on Greeks side
Melancolyke / and surquedous of pride.
And king Honux / sone of one Mabente
Into the field / plainly when he went
In order had / of wards the thyrtene
Proudely mustrynge endelonge the grene
Again Troyans / ready for to fight
And eke the king / that Vlyxes hight
Ladde with him / the fourtene as I ^ede
And Humerus the king / eke did led
The fy^^eneth / mine Auctour writes thus
And a Duke / called Curybulus
The syxteneth / ladde / upon that day
In which the kynght / of king Prothesylaye
Assygned were / by great ordinance
To enforce them / for to do vengaunce
Upon the death of their worthy king
By Ector slain / at greeks arryuynge.
And king Roydo / ladde the seuentene
And he that was king / of Occymene.
The.xviij. ward / had at his ledynge
And zantipus / that was of lyde king
Had to keep / committed to his guard

And the.xx. mine Auctour / lerneth us

Like a knight / to guide them and to wysse
And Phylocetes / that was king of larysse
The one and twenty / ladde eke as I read
The two and twenty / had Dyomede
And Heneus / king of Cyparye
That was whylom / so noble and so worthy
The three and twenty / had in gouernayle
And the Troyans / proudely for to assail
The xxiiij. with sword / spear and shield
Bynge Prothaylus / ladde into the field
And Carpenor / of Carpedye king
In werre expert / and right wise in workynge
The five and twenty / rich and well besayne
On greeks side / brought into the plain
The six and twenty / sothely and the last
As he that coudese before / and cast
Every thing / by good inspeccyon
The wise king / the great Agamenon
Had with him / this prudent werryour
As he that was / ordained Emperor
Of greeks host / as wysest of echone
And in this wise / forth the greeks gone
In the field / with pomp full royal
With the ensygnes / and tokens marcyall
Have take their ground / passyngely arrayed
And on their standards / rychely displayed
Broad banerys / and many fresshe penowne
Again the wind / yt made an hydous sown
And right dredefull / plainly for to here
And theremen saw / many crestys clear
And many tufte of gold / and silver shene
Meynt with fetheres / read white and grene
And deuyse / wonder incruaylous
And of folks / that were amerous
The tokens borne / to show openly
How they in love / burnt inwardly
Some hye empryse / that day to fulfylle
And there were herd / the loud noyses shrylle
Far in the field / and the dredefull souns
Both of trumpettes / and of claryouns
That the kalendes / of shedynge out of blood
And with the noise / almost for rage wode
The fomy brydelles / and the mouths blede
And furyous neyhyng / of many bastard stead
Praunsynge of horse / upon either side
With all the ensygnes / that might be of pride
On greeks party / and on troy also
In knyghtly wise / for to have a do
Every ward / standing in his place
The first a sonder / but a little space
Began to a reproach / with all their full intent
And Ector tho / full impatient
Formest of all / on the side of Torye
The Ire of whom / no man might accoye
But like a Lion / in his hungry rage
Issued out / furyous of vysage
Toward greeks / on his mighty stead
That with his spores / made his sides blede
His knyghtly heart / so inly was to torn
Of mortal Ire / and as he rode toforne
Brennynge full hot / in his melancolye
The which thing / when greeks began espy.
Patroclus / without more abode
Of surquedye / before the wards rode
Out all toforne / in both hoostes sight
For to encountre / plainly if he might
With worthy Ector / when he him saw a far
And as right line / as is Dyameterre
Rode unto him / in his hateful tene
And with a spear / sherpe ground and kene
Thorughout his shield / of enuyous rage
He smote Ector / without more damage
Except oonly / that the head of stele
That was before forged / and whet full well
Thorugh plate and mayle / myghtely began glace
But to the skin / for no thing might it trace
Albe it came / of passing vyolence
Yet to Ector / it did none offense
Out of his sadell / ones him to flytte
For though that he / sturdely him hytte
He might not bakwarde / bow his chyne
Nor on no party / make him to enclyne
But fatally / to his confusyon
This mighty man / this troyan champyon
In his Ire / aye brennynge more and more
Upon him / the hate frat so sore
Left his spear / mine Auctor writes thus
And with a sword / rode to Patroclus
Auysed fully / that he shall be deed
And furyously / began aim at his head
And rofe him down / their was no manner let
Into the breast / thorugh his basenet
As says Guydo / with so great a pain
That with his stroke / he parted him it wayne
His mortal sword / whetted was so kene
That Patroclus / might not sustene
Upon his horse / but fill down to ground
As he that caught / his last fatal wound
Being present / his knights euerychone
And delyuerly / upon him anon
Worthy Ector / from his stead a down
Descendyd is / like a wode lyowne
Of hateful Ire / brennynge as the fire
Having in heart / inly great desire
To spoil him / of his armure anon
In which there was / full many rich stone
Both of rubyes / and Sapphires ynde
For that days / plainly as I find
Kings lords / and knights this no nay
To battle went / in their best array
And sothly Ector / when he first began se
The multitude of stones / and pe^re
On Patro^lus / so oryent and sheyne
Upon his arm / he hynge his horse reyne
The mean while / while he of hole intent
To catch his pray / was so dylygent
Of couetyse / in their alder syghtes
Till Meryon / with three thousa^de knights
Armed in steel / round about him all
Is sodaynely / upon Ector fall
The deed corpse / of Patroclus to save
That his purpose / Ector may not have
At lyberte / the rich king to spoil
Which caused him / in anger for to boil
To whom the king / called Meryon
Irous and wode / said among echon
O gredy Lion / O wolf most tauynous
O hateful Tygre / passing enuyous
Of Auaryce / O best in saturable
And of desire / sothly vnstaunchable.
Upon this pray / thou shall y^ not now feed
Go else where / to sewe for thy mede
For trust well / in conclusyon
Fyfty thousand / to thy destruccyon
Of one intent / plainly will not fail
Thine hateful pry^e / attones for to assail
And sodaynely with speres / sharp whette
On every half / they began him besette
Maugre his force / his might and his manhood
Enforcing them to a refte him his stead
That soth fastely / of great vyolence
He constrained / for all his strong defense
As says Guydo to fall upon his kne
But thorugh his might / and magnanymyte
He of manhood / has his horse recured
And maugre greeks / is so much assured
In his strength / and in his great might
That he recured / like a worthy knight
His stead again / amyddes of his foon
And right as syne / he rode to Meryon
Full desirous / on him avenged be
In his furye of hasty cruelte
For thereupon / was set all his delight
That in his mortal / ^lody appety^e
In very sothe / he had him slain anoon
Save y^ the king / which called was Glacon
Came to rescue him / with king Theseus
And his sone that hight Archylogus
As I have told / Meryon to reskewe
And th^e thousand knights / began him sewe
Full al^^^ted attones / in battle
For life or does Ector to assail
In awayte / unware on him to set
But all this while / with whom y^ ever he met
With his sword / he killed and bare down
That finally / there gayneth no raunsowne
For any greek / that durst with him mete
At departing felt full vnswete.
He made a way / about him every where
That they fled him / as the death for fere
For where he rode / he made a patthe full plain
And as I read / to Patroclus again
He is repeyred / to spoil him if he might
Amyd the field / in the greeks sight
As he would his pray not lightly let
Till I dumee the mighty king of Crete
With two thousand / cladde in plate and mayle
Worthy kynghtes / Ector to assail
Whiles that he was / so desirous
As I have told / to spoil Patroclusi
And new again / to his confusyon
Like as I find / came king Meryon
And or Ector might take heed
They of force / refte him his stead
That sothely he / there was none other boot
Compelled was / for to fight on foot
And of knyghode / his heart he resumeth
And with his sword / about him he consumes
All that withstand / both horse and man
And furyously / this troyan knight began
Arms legs shuldres / by the boon
To hew of amydde / his mortal foon
That greeks might / before him not sustene
And as I read / that he slew fyftene
Of them that were / besy him to take
And such a slaughter / he began among the^ make
That they ne durst / abide before his face
And Meryon / in the self place
This mean while / took up Patroclus
With heavy chere / and face full pyruous
And on his ^tede / he laid it him beforne
And to his tente / anon he has it borne
Always greeks / in their cruel mode
About Ector / furyous and wode
Felly a^ode / fighting upon foot
Of which / some felt vnlote
That presumed / upon him to press
But of manhood / they ne would cesse
To besette him / on every side
Having a trust / in their great pride
Finally at myschefe / him to take
For they dempte / he might not escape
Their hands shortly / by none adventure
Nor his stead / by lyklyhede recure
For of force / they cast him to let
And all attones / began on him to set
And specially / among them euerychone
I find in sothe / how that there was one
A grekysshe knight / of right worthy fame
And Caryon / plainly was his name
That him aforced / Ector to oppress
When he was most / in myschefe and distress
Besette with greeks / him enuyrownynge
Till of fortune / on him awaytynge
The long day / in that fell fight
To his rescuse / there came atroyan knight
Mydde of greeks / when he was besette
And took.ij. darts / sharp and kene whette
And furyously / first he shoke the toon
And thorugh the heart / he smote this Caryon
That the darte / into the field began glyde
By plate and mayle / thorughout outher side
That fatally / of that dedely wound
This Caryon / glode anon to ground
Among an hundred / knights of his ferys
Before conspyred / with their fell cherys
To a slain Ector / by some manner way
But eft again / this young knight of troy
Full delyuerly / raughte a another spear
And cast at one / that he saw afere
Auaunce himself / on Ector in the field
And thorugh his platys / plainly and his shield
Line right / that he ne should asterte
Of very might / roof him thorughe the heart
And after that / in all the haste he could
Upon Troyans / he began to cry loud
To enhaste them / knyghtly to socoure
Whorthy Ector / that stood in aduentoure
Among Greeks / having no refute
Sool he himself / of help destytute
At which cry / on greeks all unware
First of all / came worthy Cyncybare
That brother was / to Ector in baste borne
And himself riding / all toforne
And the knights / of which he was guide
Wonder proudely / pryckynge by his side
Sodaynely / both one and all
In a frosshe / be on the greeks fall
That had Ector / round beset about
And thorugh manhood / of this great route
That be enbosshed / on them at the back
Threhondred knights / of which yt I spacke
For astoned / began them to withdraw
But thurty first / cruelly were slawe
And maugre them / Ector of manhede
Amyd the field / taken has his stead
And entered is / in among the prees
And he that day / of knyghthode pereles
While he held / his blody sword in hand
All tho / that again him stand
There was no help / plainly nor no read
But that he brake / and karfe a two the threde
And the knotte / of cruel Antropos
Only for he was / let of his purpose
At good leyser / to spoil Patroclus
Therefore in Ire / wode and Furyous
Full cruelly greeks / quytte their mede
Which from his face / fast began them speed
Whose sharp sword / bathed in their blood
Was dyed read / for it did him good
Upon them / avenged for to be
For that day / a lion played he
Upon greeks / his manhood for to haunte
For he their pride / so mortally began daunte
That they him fled / where that he rode
Making all hot / the streyntes of their blood
Endelonge to run / upon the grene
Till the time / the Duke of great Athene
That called was / whylom Menesteus
With three thousand / knights full famous
Of which he was / both lord and guide
The field has take / upon the left side
For a deceyte / in full secret wise
Where Troylus was / with the folk of Fryse
Which has that day / who so list to seek
By his knyghthode / killed many greek
Like a Tygre / gredy on his pray
Troylus bare him / all the long day
Sleynge of greeks / many worthy knight
And while that he was / besyest in fight.
Again his foon / with king Antipus
And the king / that hight Alchanus
Upon greeks Ylyche / fresshe and new
Making their sides / all of blody hew
By one assent this three / thorugh their ma^hede
And specially / upon his bay stead
Where so ever / that this Troylus rode
Every greek / that his sword abode
Sodaynely / he made for to sterue
Thorugh their plates / so deep he began kerue.
And this continued / till duke Meneste
Of Troylus saw / the great cruelte
And the slaughtre / that he of greeks made
Of hasty Ire / with face pale and fade
Hent a spear / and threw it in the rest
And Troylus smette / even amyd the breast
So sternely / that maugre his renown
To the earth / anon he bare him down
In the mids / of his mortal foon
That cruelly / him besette anoon
And him to treyne / laid out oak and lase
Round about / in manner of compase
With spear and darte / and swerdes forged bright
But he himself / diffendeth like a knight
With great manhood / his honor to auaunce
Albe his life / was hanged in balaunce
Where he stood / and felt full vnswete
In point of death / among the horse fete
With great awayte / of Duke Meneste
How this Troylus / might have take be
Of mortal hate / casting in his thought
At myschefe take / that he escape naught
On every half / he was so besette
With swerdes round / kene ground and whette
Alone alas / mortally bestadde
They seized him / and forth they have him ladde
Till Myseres / a worthy knight of troy
Began to cry / as he stood in the way
Sore abashed / in right furyous wise
O ye noble / worthy men of Fryse
Manly knights / aye preuyd in the field
Most renowned / both with spear and shield
Consider now / unto your hye fame
And aduerte / the glory of your name
How this day / thorugh your neclygence
By the power / and mighty vyolence
Of the greeks / Troylus is ytake
Sool in the field / for ye have him forsake
That shall rebounde / to your alder shame
For ye in sothe / greatly are to blame
If he that is / of worthynesse flower
Be take of greeks / for lack of socoure
That but if ye take / hasty wreche
Shameful report / your honor shall apeche
Perpetuelly / and said thereof amys
In your defaute / that Troylus taken is
Which named be / so worthy and famous
And with that word / the king Alkamous
Of melancolye / felt his heart ryue
And in his Ire / hente a spear blyue
And pryckynge after / enhateth what he might
Till he of them / plainly had a sight
That besy were Troylus / for to ^ede
And he full knyghtly / sitting on his stead
Ran one thorugh / that he fell down deed
And efte again / pale and no thing read
In his rancoure / no longer would let
But a greek / the first that he met
Thorugh the body / smet he with a spear
That men might se / the point a fere
By breast and plate / thorugh the shulder bone
That to the ground / he fell down deed anon
And therwithall / the worthy Fryses all
Came flokmele down / and on greeks fall
So myghtely / that maugre their diffence
They set upon / with so great vyolence
That Troylus / is from all danger fre
And thorugh their knyghtly / magnanymyte
They made him / to recure his stead
And specially helping / in this need
Was zantipus / the strong manly king
Which of disdain / at his in coming
Ou Meneste / began his spear grate
And thorugh his shield / mayle and thycke plate
So sore he smote / that this Meneste
Had be deed / ne had his armor be
Which for Ire / began to tremble and shake
That Troylus was / from his hondes take
And escaped / to be prisoner
Despyte his berde / and maugre his power
Wherefore he began / of hasty hot envy
On his knights / furyously to cry
That were so mighty / renowned and strong
To pain them / for to venge his wrong
Upon Troyans / to mete them in the face
And they in have / began myghtely enbrace
Their sharp speres / ground for to byte
And felly foyne / and togydre smite
For tho began / the great mortal werre
The fire brast out / shene as any sterre
On basenertes / and their plates bright
That thorugh y^ field / flaumeth ye fereful light
To life nor death / they took tho no head
And down the plain / both in length and bread
The wards began / proudely to auale
And with lokes / of envy pale
They aproche / and assemble yfere
In hate brennynge / that no man may stere
And began hurt / with spear sword and darte
And mortally / upon every part
The slaughter began / greatly for to rewe
And Ylyche always / new and new
Ector greeks / thorugh his worthynesse
Where he rode / manly did oppress
And mercylesse / slow them and bare down
Now here now there / without excepcyowne
So furyously / that routhe was to se
And than of new / the duke Meneste
Repaired is / with enuyous heart
From his hondes / that Troylus so a sterte
And for the slaughter / eke of his meynee
That where he rode / he besy was to s^ee
The troyan people / when he might them mete
For to avenge him / for nothing would he let
Till casuelly / among all the prees
A knight he met / that hight Miserees
Which in despyte / of this Meneste
Had at the reskus / of worthy Troylus be
And maugre him / put him from his pray
And so befelle / on the self day
As they mete / again of adventure
That Meneste / by his cote armure
Marked him / by arms that he bare
And sodaynely / or that he was ware
Or that he / might take any head
Furyously / on his stern stead
And with a spear / amyd the renges all
Bare him over / and made him for to fall
Maugre his might / to the earth down
And than I find / how the king Hupowne
Descended is / the storye list not lie
Two thousand knights / in his company
Which on greeks / felly began to set
And in y^ berde / king Prothenor them met
And Archelaus / the noble werryour
Of Boece / lord and governor
With help oonly / of this Prothenor
Like a tygre / or a wood boor
Began troyans / assail to the death
And many one / that day he sleeth
But king Hupon / thorugh his chyualrye
That time / in his melancolye
Full many greek / gave his dethes wound
And thus they began / each other to confound
Such mortal hate / among them there was
Till of Fortune / a knight Pollydamas
On troy side / sone of Anthenor
With his knights / and himself tofor
Is on greeks / of enuyous pride
Myd their wards / fall in a side
And began break them / and knyghtly to disseuer
Again whose sword / they might not persevere
He was on them / so inly furyous
And him to help / came the king Remus
With a wynge / on that other part
Brekynge in / with many spear and darte
Again greeks / with three thousand knights
That to behold / how felly that he fyghtes
It was in sothe / unto them of troy
A very lust / and a heavenly joy
To se now greeks / brake asondre
That the noise / loud as any thondre
In the field / of strokes began arise
And while Remus / as ye have herd deuyse
Upon greeks / was so enuyous
Into the field / came Menelaus
With his worthy knights / of Spartense
Again Remus / to make resystence
And full proudely / making no delay
This worthy Remus / and king Menelaye
On horse back / with sharp speres whette
Myd the field / of envy met
And thorugh / their manly prowess and renown
From horse back / each bare other down
For none the stroke / of other might shone
And in that while / of Anthenor the sone
Pollydamas / lusty fresshe and light
As he that was / in his deliver might
And desirous / to honor to atteyne
Met in the field / the neuewe of Eleyne
The mighty duke / called Mereus
Flourynge in youth / and right virtuous
Fresshe armed new / and lusty of courage
And was in sothe / but twenty year of age
Which of so young / was a noble knight
Right renowned / both of heart and might
But of Fortune / it befell alas
The troyan knight / dau^z Pollydamas
With a spear / thorugh shield mayle and plate
Hytte him so / that by cruel fate
Among greeks / that he fell down deed
Of which thing / when Menelay took head
And saw him lie / slain on the grene
In his heart / remembrynge on the queen
The queen Eleyne / whose neuewe he was
For dole of which / a full deliver pas
To Remus rode / in his cruelte
Also far / as he might him se
And full knyghtly / met him in the berde
And smette at him / with his sharp sword
Upon the head / in his hateful tene
That of his stead / he might not sustene
His wound was / so passyngely mortal
That with the stroke / and the pryllous fall
His knights wend / deed he had be
And hent him up / and began to fle
To troy ward / with him a great paas
But it befell / that Pollydamas
The manner of them / when that he beheld
Made them repair / knyghtly into field
Except that some / as they in bidding had
Worthy Remus / home to troy ladde
Pale and deed / with his wounds wide
And tho came in / on the greeks side.
Celydys / the lusty fresshe king
Of whom Dares / says in his writing
And for a sothe / in his book list tell
How Celydys / all other did excelle
Both in beauty / and in semelyhede
Of shape of port / and of goodlyhede
Surmountynge all / as Dares list descryue
As in fayrenesse / all tho alive
All his lymmes / compact were so clean
And as I read / the young fresshe queen
Of Fumynye / which was of beauty flower
King Celydys / loved Paramoure
That upon him / was holy her pleasaunce
He was so prynted / in her remembrance
For chief resort / sothely of her heart
Was upon him / every hour to aduerte
For finally / he departed naught
Day nor night / nor hour out of her thought
For he was fully / all her own knight
But of Fortune / he lusty fresshe and light
Smote his stead / sharply in the side
Of surquedye / and proudely began to ride
Of mortal hate / a full Furyous paas
Right as line / to Pollydamas
And with a spear / made him for to flytte
From his sadell / in which he did sytte
He marked him / with so great a might
But agaynewarde / this manly troyan knight
Pollydamas / with a despytous face
Or Celydys / departed fro the place
With aswerde / so smet him on the head
From his stead / that he fylle down deed
Which to greeks / was great confusyon
And all this time / fyerser than lion
Ector greeks / knyghtly began enchace
And often made them / for to lose their place
Where ever he rode / of necessyte
Before his sword / he made them for to fle
Such vengeance / he has on them take
That they the field / were feign to forsake
And to pursewe / would he never fine
Till among the people / of Salomyne
Ector met / the worthy king famous
That was their lord / and hight Thesalus
That many Troyan / that day had slawe
And as Ector / toward him began draw
King Tenter / that was of greece also
A manly knight / and prudent both two
Raught a spear / in all the haste he can
And unawarely / unto Ector ran
And thorughe his shield / plate and mayle of stele
The sperehede / forged was so well
So sharp and square / and so kene ground
That he gave Ector / full peryllous wound
But as Ector / reyne began his stead
Proud Tenter / to aquyte his mede
He full wisely / in all the haste he might
Was right far severed / from his sight
Whereof Ector / melancolyous
And of heart / wood and furyous
For the akynge / of his wound grene
In haste to avenge / the constreynte of his ten^
What greek after / shortly that he met
That was so bold / his way to with set
Without mercy / he was his death anon
And as I read / he encountered one
Which of pride / would him dyuerte
Whom with his sword / he rose to the heart
Thorugh his harneys / of melancolye
The which stroke / when greeks began espy
They astoned / of one entencyon
Peryllously / besette him enuyron
And such assaute / began about him make
Thorugh their ma^hode / if they might hy^ take
And of accord / with great multitude
Cruelly / they began him to include
By lyklyhede / in that mortal strife
He might not escape / with the life
On him they were / so fell and enuyous
Till that a king / which hight Theseus
On greeks side / oonly of gentyllesse
Such routhe caughe / upon his distress
To se him stand / so nigh upon the wrake
Thus unto him / of manly pytespake.
O Flour of knyghthode / rote of hardynes
Well of manhood / stok of worthynes
Why list y^ not / to have none aduerte^ce
Thy life to save / of knyghtly prouyde^ce
But wylfully / where most is to dread
Thy life Iupardest / and take list no head
In mortal peril / how thou art besette
Among so many / closed and yshette
Alone alas / deuoyde of all socoure
And to thy self / wylt do no favor
But as Fortune / lyketh to ordain
That every wight / ought to complain
To behold / that so noble a knight
Which thorugh the world / cast so clear a light
In worthynesse / and will him not withdraw
Reklesly / this day to be slawe
So pyteously / thy person for to lose
Withdraw thy hand / yet sith you may chese
Thy hye prowess / compels me to preye
At such myschefe / that thou not ne deye
And when Ector / of him began take heed
He thanked him / of his goodlyhede
And maugre sothly / the power and the might
Of the greeks / like a worthy knight
He scapyd is / myd of all his foon
And went his way / thorugh them euerychon
His blody sword / always in his hand
And in his way / Pollydamas he fond
Full like a man / with all his besy pain
Diffende himself / again the kings twain
Menelay / and Thelamonyus
Which upon him / were full Furyous
And with a spear / this greek this Thelamowne
Pollydamas / smote to the earth down
Compellynge him / there was none other vote
Again them two / for to fight on foot
Assentyd fully / on him to be wroke
And first they have / he wen and to broke
The mighty charnelle / of his basenet
And when his vyser / after was smet
And his face naked / was and bare
They fell on him / in that mortal snare
And took him / the storye can deuyse
And sent him forth / in full cruel wise
Toward greeks / with many worthy knight
But when Ector / thereof had a sight
And sawethe myschefe / of Pollydamas
He cast fully / to socoure in this caas
And prycked after / wooder than lion
And where he rode / about him enuyron
With his sword / he made a large space
Till he came / to the same place
Among greek / furyous and wode
Pollydamas / the self time stood
Socourles / from all remedy
Till that he / on Ector cast his Eye
That greeks made / hastily withdraw
And thurty first of them he has slawe
And severed them / maugre all their pride
Tofore his sword / they durst not abide
Against him / nor make none obstacle
But of knyghthode / by very hye miracle
Pollydamas / in myschefe first awhaped
From greeks hand / freely is escaped
But fresshely tho / the king Epystrophns
Menelay / and Thelamonyus
With all their knights / togydre hole and cloos
Again Troyans / to get them aloos
Be of new entered / in battle
With great strength / and passing apparayle
That myghtely / troyans they compelle
In their way / that they dare not dwell
Natwithstandynge / their great worthynesse
Nor of Ector / the knyghtly hye prowess
That fought so manly / that time as I read
But cowardely / they have slain his stead
That he constrained was / to fight on foot
That many greek / felt full vnsote
For there was none / that about him stood
With his sword / that he ne shadde his blood
Though he so thycke / about was be layne
He voyded them / and made aspace plain
In compass round / behind and eke before
And on his fete / so well he has him bore
That day / that greek was none certain
That harby was / hand on him to layne
He was so strong / and sturdy as a wall
And when his brethren / called natural
Saw him a foot / amyd of all his foon
On a frusshe / they fell in euerychon
And found him / the storye makes mind
Diffende himself / like a Tygre in ynde
And him to help / thorugh their hye renown
They fell first / on king Thelamowne
For he on Ector / was so cruel found
They gave to him / many blody wound
Till one of them / named Dyndaron
Has so far / among the rengys gone
And bore him so / oonly of manhede
That he has won / a passing mighty stead
And brought to Ector / sothly there he stood
Among greeks / all bathed in their blood
The which in haste / full knyghtly he be strode
And among them like / Mars himself he rode
Full many greek / making for to sterue
And with his sword / whetted for to kerue
He daunted has / their enuyous pride
Till Dephebus / entrede in a side
Into the field / with a knyghtly chere
And with him brought / many good Archere
Of Poem / which with their arrows kene
And with feathers of pecok / fresshe and shene
Upon greeks / have the field recured
In they shot / they were so much assured
That thorugh mayle / and thycke plate of stele
They perced have / their harneys euerydele
And Dephebus / full like a manly man
To king Tentran / on horse back tho ran
And furyously / began his sword enbrace
And wounded him / even amyd the face
Thorughe the vyser / in his fell tene
On horse back / he might not sustene
And thus Troyans / on greeks are yronne
That they again / have the field ywonne
They were on them / so yrous and so wode
But Theseus / full knyghtly them withstode
With the knights / that he with him ladde
And as I read / Ectora brother had
The storye says / that hight Quyntylene
young fresshe and lusty / armed bright and shene
Which with the king / called Modernus
Is proudely fall / upon Theseus
And these twain / togydre of assent
Be fall on him / with great aduysement
That finally / to his unhappy chance
with their knyghthode / brought hy^ to outtrau^ce
And cast shortly / that he shall be deed
Of whose purpose / as Ector began take heed
He unto them / of very gentery
With all his might / loud began to cry
Besechynge them / for no thing that he deye
And lowely they / his bidding did obey
And them withdrewe / for to do vengeance
For Ector had / fully remembrance
How Theseus / the same day tofore
Toward him / so goodly had him bore
When he him saw / in myschefe and distress
And knyghtly thought / quyte his gentylnesse
Like as it logeth / to every gentylman
And Theseus / full lowely tho began
To thank Ector / that he was escaped
But king Thoas / tho has fast raped
Into the field / with other knights many
And specially / with them of Calydonye
Came Phyloteas / the mighty king also
Again Troyans / for to have ado
And first Thoas / with a spear ran
Furyously / to Cassybelan
One of the sons / of king Pryamus
And gave him tho / a wound so grievous
Without recure / that he fell down deed
Of which stroke / when Ector began take heed
In his heart / began his death complain
And in all haste / did his besy pain
On his brother / avenge him if he might
And many one / he made to a light
Thorugh his knyghthode / from his horse bake
That sothefastly / all went unto wrake
On greeks side / what came in his way
So worthily / he bare him all that day
Till duke Nestor / is entrede into fight
With five thousand / in steel armed bright
Again Troyans / greeks to socoure
And with him met / of very adventure
The king Esdras / so mighty and so bold
And king Phyon / in his chare of gold
With all the worthy / noble chyualrye
That from Argesta / came with Ieconye
The kings sone / of the same land
Full renowned / and worthy of his hand
And as they semble / and togydre ran
The same time / many worthy man
Has lost his life / upon either side
And of slaughtre / with large wounds wide
All the soil of bodies / that lay deed
Like a river / ran with stremys read
With their cherys / grysely pale and fade
That in the blood / men might go and wade
To the ancle / the slaughtre / was so huge
And king Phyon / socour and refuge
Unto Troyans / so bare him in that strife
That many greek / he made lose his life
The same day / so well his sword was whette
But he unawarely / so sore was besette
With multitude / of greeks round about
That of his life / he plainly stood in doubt
For lykely was / he might not escape
And of greeks / he should anon be take
Ne had he be help / of worthy Ieconye
That to Esdras / loud began to cry
Alas quod he / of routhe and pity
Worthy Phyon / the king shall take be
Among greeks / thorugh your neclygence
But in all haste / ye do your dylygence
For to reskewe / this noble worthy king
And all attones / without more tariynge
Maugre all tho / that made resystence
From greeks sword / by mighty vyolence
They have reskewed / the noble king Phyon
And at his large / with them he is goon
Of his escape / wonder glad and light
And Ector than / with many lusty knight
Returned is / and Dephebus also
Pollydamas / and many another to
Of Troyan knights / that desire new
Greeks to make / sore for to rewe
For of assent / they fully them purpose
In such myschefe / greeks to enclose
That if they might / few should escape
And thereupon / knyghtly they them shape
And them began / fresshely / for to assail
That in the field / greeks began to fail
Of their power / and to lose their land
That finally / thorugh the mighty hand
And the force / of Troianysshe knights
The greeks had / maugre all their myghtes
Be brought that day / to confusyowne
But Menelay / and king Thelamowne
When they them saw / febly and apeyre
They of knyghthode / made them to repeyre
And so like men / they have themself diffendyd
Till Eneas / from Troy is discendyd
With Ewfremus / the Duke / the manly man
And with their knights / of new they began
Efte again / greeks to oppress
And Ector aye / thorugh his worthynesse
Like a lion / with a stern face
Ever in one / so began them to enchace
That compellyd / of necessyte
They were echone / before his sword to fle
And constrained / right of very need
Of which thing / when Ayax began take heed
Had in heart / great compassyon
To se the slaughter / and confusyon
On greeks side / Guydo makes mind
And began to look / at his back behind
And saw where many / ward stood abroad
And many baner / and penowne that abode
Amyd the field hole / and not for broke
That ready were / attones to be wroke
If need were / on them of Troy town
In which wards / without excepcyowne
Was hole the flower / of greeks chyualtye
To whom anon / Ayax began him hye
As he that was / sore in heart agreued
And with his cry / he has them so co^meued
That they in haste / them to come to reskuse
Among whom / was there no refuse
And as fast / as they began assemble
Of noise of horse / the earth began to tremble
Furyously / as they togydre flynge
There might men / the strokys here ring
Of sperys sharp / thorugh the harneys borne
And thorugh sheldes / wrought of stele and horn
Into the breast / sturdy square and broad
And there I find / how that Ayax rode
To Eneas / and he to him also
So great envy / was atwyxe them two
That not but death / might their ire apese
For in heart / nouther might have ese
Till with sperys / sharp / ground and whette
On horse back / they have togydre met
And at Coupynge / so sore they have hytte
That eueryche other / to the earth smytte
That to behold / was a knyghtly sight
And after / they both / on foot fight
By lyklyhede / in their wode rage
Outher to fall / in full great damage
Among the horse / because that they stood
Upon the soil / a lover sparde with blood
But Phyloteas / is to Ayar come
And has him up / among the horse ynome
That knyghtly faught / as made is memory
For sothely else / Troyans with victory
Had had the field / plainly for to said
Till Phyloteas / with his wards twain
Even in the face / manly them withstode
And with a spear / he first to Ector rode
And upon him / the shafte I find he brake
But sothly he / upon his horse bake
Kept him so well / for all that fell stroke
Remeuynge not / but sturdy as an oak
Sat in his sadell / vpryght with his chyne
And with a spear / right as any line
Into body deep / thorugh the shield
Phyloteas / he smote into the field
That of his life / his knights were in doubt
But tho came in / with so great a route
Bynge Humerus / and vlixes eke
And with them / brought many worthy greek
Ten thousand knights / manly men echone
That began Troyans / for to assoyle anon
And cruelly / on every half certain
With multitude / they have them so be layne
That dispayred / and disconsolate
And of long fight / awaped and a mate
Began withdraw / faynted in battle
And eke their horse / sothly began fail
That on their side / all went up so down
But Paris / tho with them of Troy town
Is entrede in / in full manly wise
And first he met / with the king of Fryse
That to Vlixes / was nigh of allye
Whom Paris / smote with so great envy
That he him slew / whereof greeks were
Sore abashed / and after with a spear
Vlixes to de to avenge him / if he might
And first when he / of Paris had a sight
Into the rest / he began his spear throw
That finally / for he bare to low
Faylynge of Paris / sothly as I read
Under him he slew / his mighty stead
That maugre him / he to ground is gone
And he on him / would have fall anon
But Troylus tho / met him in the berde
And furyously / with his sharp sword
He smote Vlixes / thorugh out his vyser
That like a condyte / or a small river
Down by his face / of blood the stremys ran
But vlixes / like a manly man
Of that stroke / astoned not at all
But on his stead / styffe as any wall
With his sword / so myghtely began race
Thorughe the vmbrer / into Troylus face
That he him gave / a large mortal wound
Of which stroke / passyngly iocounde
The greeks were / supposyng in their thought
How Troyans / finally were brought
Unto out trance / and sothely so they had
Save that Ector / with kynghtes which he ladde
And with him eke / Paris and Dephebus
And all his brethren / i knyghthod most famous
Troylus also / for all his last wound
That was always / so noble knight y^ found
All attones / Joined into one
Upon greeks / sodaynely be gone
And worthy Ector / alder first began
Greeks to enchace / that before him ran
Like as bestes / that fled fro the death
And ever in one / with his sword he sleth
Whom he met / or durst his stroke abide
And on his soon / with fresshe wounds wide
The slaughter he made / always to renew
And thylke day / in blody rosen hew
He has their platys / and their harneyse steyned
And though it had / blood fro heaven reyned
The soil redder / might not a ben
And aye ylyche / as a swarm of been
The greeks flockmele / fled out of his way
And Guydo says / that all that ylke day
Actor / had formest on the plain
In the frounter / of the greeks layne
That behind / the knights of his Guard
For lack of him / were all out of ward
Wherefore when he / had sought long
And greeks saw / of new wexe strong
To his knights / he is again repaired
Which in themself / greatly were dispayred
For his absence / but tho when they him se
Full inwardely / recomforted be
And with glad heart / have their lord received
And their gladness / when he has parceyued
Spoke unto them / full affectuously
And prayed them / full benyngnely
To remember / knyghtly in their heart
And consider wisely and / aduerte
First the wrongs / that greeks have them do
Of yore agoo / and ouermore also
If greeks had / that day victory
Farewell for aye / the honor and the glory
Of Troyan blood / in conclusiowne
For finally / we and eke our town
Shall mortally / turn to ruin
And our honor / that was wont to shine
Thorugh out the world / and our worthynesse
Eclypse shall / and turn to derkenesse
But ye this day / like as men you quyte
Wherefore I pray / that no man atwyte
Your hye renown / of any cowardyse
To set upon / in full manly wise
And not to spare / for dread of death I pray
And they echone / full lowely began obaye
To his desire / without longer tale
And entering in / by a certain vale
Upon greeks / this worthy knights all
Following Ector / sodaynely be fall
Full mortally / or that they were ware
And Ector tho / no greek would spare
But every where / to their confusyon
He killed and slew / about him enuyron
And his knights / riding by his side
Made their ^omen / maugre all their pride
To lose their land / and flewe out of their sight
Till that the king / which Toas hight
On greeks side / in ward began him dress
And of new / full knyghtly began oppress
Them of Troy / this king this manly man
That had / before slain Cassybelan
One of the sons / of king Pryamus
But as he rode / of fortune it fell thus
That all the brethren / on a frusshe he met
Which of assent / enuyron him be set
And from his sadell / that many greek beheld
Among the horse / smethym into the field
And of they rent / first his basenet
And cruelly / they had his head of smet
For he unarmed / all at myschefe stood
Save that the Duke / furyous and wode
Of Athenys / riding a great pace
Reskued him / in this mortal case
With is knights / that about him rode
And him to help / without more abode
With aspere / sharp whette and kene
First of all / he fell on Quyntylene
That besy was / Thoas to have slawe
And the brethren / he made also withdraw
When Quyntylene / of his horse was throw
But Paris tho / drew up his mighty bow
And to this duke / let an arowe glyde
And thorugh his plates / hit him in the side
Upon a ryb / that made him sore blede
Of which stroke / he ne took no head
Because oonly / that he so fervent was
Amyd his foon / to help king Thoas
Among the horse / that was bore to ground
In point of death / with many mortal wound
Oonly for he / was naked on the head
But this Duke / fully deuoyde of dread
Of his knyghode / in this pecyllous caas
Amyd his foon / has help king Thoas
And with his life / made him escape free
And Ector aye / of cruel enmytee
Ilyche fresshe / for no thing would leave
Upon greeks / his manhood for to preue
Enforsynge him / to their destruccy wone
And as he rode / among them up and down
King Humerus / has a bow take
And to shote / began him ready make
And hatefully / therein set an arowe
And to Ector / he marked has so narowe
That he smote him / even amyd the face
But or he might / any fertherpase
Ector smet him / with so great a pain
That with his sword / he rose his head at wayne
The death of whom / when the greeks know
Mine Auctor says / they have an horn yblowe
That unwarily / with that dredefull sown
Seven thousa^de knights / came attones down
About Ector / without more abode
But he of force / thorugh them all he rode
Maugre their might / that him tho with set
And slow all tho / that his way let
And stynte not / plainly till he came
To his Fader / the worthy king Pryam
With many worthy / full famous of renown
That with his knights / fast by the town
Lay all the day / with men on horse and foot
As he that was / of knyghode croppe and root
And kept him close / of full hye prudence
Till Ector came / unto his presence
And him besoughte / in this great need
With three thousand / that he would him speed
Upon greeks / in their fell rage
To fall on them / at most advantage.
ANd than i have / this worthy Pryamus
With his knights / fresshe and desirous
Toward greeks / has the way take
And such a mordre / began upon them make
That many greeks / lay deed on the plain
For Pryamus / so sore has them be layne
On every half / thorugh his great might
That they full fast / fled out of his sight
So sore of new / he upon them set
And as I find / they togydre met
Actor and Ayax / of very adventure
And on their stedes / strong and wonder sure
The storye says / in all the haste they konne
Like wood lions / they togydre run
With so great might / y^ were they lefe or loathe
Upon the plain / they were unhorsed both
And in this while / Menelay the king
Sodaynely / as he came riding
He slew of Troy / a worthy Amyrall
And thus the slaughtre / passyngly mortal
Benewed aye / for Celydonas
The neue we slew / of king Thoas
And Madan met / mine Auctor writes thus
A grekysshe king / called Cedyus
Which with his sword / such a stroke him set
That thorughe y^ vmbrer / out his eye he smette
And Sardellus / that was of Troy eke
The same while / slew a worthy greek
A lord of name / and of hye prowess
All though Guydo / his name not express
And than also / came Margaryton
On troy side / again Thelamon
And both two / inly set a fire
Of hye disdain / and of hateful ire
And they met / on horse back yfere
King Thelamon / sothly as I lere
Gave unto him / a woundefull cruel
But tho came in / the troyan Phanuell
And Prothenor / smote down of his stead
And thus the sons / plainly as I read
Of Pryamus / no thing disamayde
The greeks have / on every part outrayed
And so knyghtly / all the day them borne
That many greek / fatally has lorne
His life in sothe / of hate and enmyte
And king Duglas / is fall on Meneste
Of Athenys Duke / and gouernoure
And with aspere / of Ire and old rancoure
He ran at him / and smet him amyd the shield
But for all that / his sadell yet he held.
And for the duke / spear had none
He with a sword / to Duglas rode anon
And thorugh the owmbrer / rofe of nigh his nase
That he astoned / stood as in a mase
When that he saw / the condyte of his blood
So streme out / but for all that he rode
Out aside / fully deuoyde of fere
Unto time / that he staunched were
But Deamor / his own brother dear
When he beheld / his mortal blody chere
Of hye disdain / he rode to Meneste
And him vnhorseth / but up anon sterte he
And or he might / fully up arise
Another brother / in full cruel wise
Is fall on him / so that of them three
Attones were / upon Meneste
Fully in purpose / he shall lose his life
But he so knyghtly / bare him in that strife
Against them / that wonder was to se
And upon him / most cruel of them three
Was one Thoras / eldest of echone
Which him to a slain / was besy ever in one
For all to broke / they have his basenet
But when that Tenter / saw him so beset
A grekysshe king / as made is mencyon
Had in his heart / great compassyon
And thought plainly / of manhood him releue
And if he might / his foomen for to grieve
But all for naught / was his besy pain
For Ector the / e^le on both twain
Upon Tenter / and on Meneste
And had them slain / ne had Ayaxbe
Which unto Ector / fast began him hye
A thousand knights / in his company
To withstand him / and Meneste to save
From his hands / if he might him have
But Paris tho / and the king of Perce
With five thousand / as I can reherce
Of worthy knights / and many troyan mo
Be unto Ector / all attones go
In thryfty wise / riding on a row
For Paris made / a trumpet to be blow
At which there came / knyghtly enbataylled
Many Troyan / full well apparaylled
Which in the field / of Ector were conveyed
For of one heart / they fully have obeyed
Unto the bidding / of this Troyan knight
All fresshe and new / tobegynne a fight
Upon greeks / as ferforth as they can
Of whom was slain many manly man
And aye the slaughter / pyteously renews
That many greek / sore in heart reweth
Their great loss / and destruccyowne
Wrought upon them / by them of troy town
And specially / of Ector as I find
Which on that day / as Dares makes mind
With his hand / a thousand knights slow
That never were / a dawed of their sow
For greek dare none / in his way dwell
For with his sword / he could them so compelle
To lose their ground / of necessyte
And like as sheep / before the wolf to fle
And as I read / amyd of this victory
Ector met / under a Tentorye.
Among greeks / Meryon the king
To whom he spoke / without more taryenge
O thou traytoure / thy hour aprocheth fast
For thou art come / sothely to thy last
Thy fatal day / has his course yronne
For trust well / or westrynge of the son
I cast platly / to quyte the thy mede
And with my sword / in haste thy blood to shede
For thou so bold were / on me to day
To let me / of my rich pray
At the spoylynge / of king Patroclus
That for cause / thou were presumptuous
Me to disturb / thou shall anon be deed
And down he sterte / and smote of first his head
And him to spoil / also began him haste
But Meneste / came on him as fast
When he beheld / trauerse at his back
And with aspere / in which was no lack
Smote him in / with great vyolence
Without sight / or any aduertence
Of worthy Ector / or any taking head
The wound of whom / sore began to blede
But out he went / and made it fast bind
And Meneste / stale away behind
Not in purpose / sothly if he may
To mete Ector / of all that ylke day.
But when that he / was ybounde sore
His womb staunche / that it blede no more
More furyous / than ever he was tofore
Repaired is / with anger all to tore
So aye the ire / on his heart fret
That he bare down / all that ever he met
Sleeth and kylleth / he was so mercyles
All tho / that put themself in prees
Of hardy were / with him for to mete
For in his book / like as write Darete
For very sothe / and in the storye says
If it be so / that men may give faith
And credence / of possybylyte
As in Guydo / clearly ye mayse
After that he / caughte his latter wound
Finally greeks / to confound
So as it is / affermyd in certain
A thousand knights / with his hand were slain
Without them tho / that I spoke of rathe
And new always / he began his sword to bathe
In greeks blood / that sodaynely they be
So ouerlayne / thorugh his cruelte
That greek was none / of hye nor low estate
That he ne was / awhaped and amate
Of his knyghthode / and manly excellence
For there was none / to make resystence
Nor utterly / that durst take on hand
Of all that day / Ector to withstonde.
And as it is made / also mensyon
Thylke day / king Agamenon
As says Guydo / came not into field
For causes great / his presence he with held
On greeks side / that all goth up so down
Ector on them / so plays the lyowne
That to their tents / they fled for socours
And they of troy / proudely as victours
Sewed after / by traces of their blood
And there they wan / treasoure and great good
And spoiled them / in full great distress
Of their armure / and of their richesse
And fell on them / or that they were ware
And home to troy / all that good they bare
For finally / that day with myschaunce
Greeks had be / brought unto out trance
Without recure / in sothe for evermore
On every part / they were be laid so sore
Thorugh the manhood / of Ector and the might
With help / of many other worthy knight
That so felly / again greeks wrought
For to such myschefe / plainly they the^ brought
That ne had be / their own pyteous slouthe
Of pride oonly / and of folly routhe
They had of them / at their volunte
That day for ever / had the soueraygnete
And recured / thorugh their hye renown
Lordshyppe of them / and domynacy own
Which should have last / and be contynuell
Victoryously / and perpetuell
Have endured / save cruel fate
Is ready aye with fortune / to debate
Again things / that gynne in wylfulnesse
To make them fine / aye in wretchedness
Thorughe their enuyous / disposicyon
Of sudden change / and reuolucyon
And unware tournynge / of her false whele
That will not bide / when a thing is well
Alas frele / deuoyde of sykernesse
The cause was / dymmed with derkenesse
That has troyans / thorugh false oppynyon
Yblynded so / in their discrecyon
And specially / for dyrked so the sight
Of worthy Ector / the prudent manly knight
To se before / what should after sewe
By good advise / the myschefe to eschew
That followed them / at the back behind
Alas they were / wylfully made blind
The same day / when they sete soft
By victory / on the hylle a lofte
That they not could / of neclygence se
The after fall / of their Felycyte
So put a back / was their aduertence
For lack of reason / and of hye prudence
For they their hap / have voyded and their grace
That presently / were set before their face.
For in a man / is not commendable
If Fortune / be to him favorable
And blaundysshynge / with a forhede clear
To smyle on him / with a splesaunte chere
Oonly of Famour / for to help him out
When he in myschefe / is beset about
If he refuse / his hap of wylfulnesse
Fortune avoiding / thorugh unkindness
When she mynystreth to him / of her grace
Another time / he shall her not enbrace
When he has need / to her help at all
To socoure him / or he catch a fall
But rather than / for his ingratytude
Frowardly / with mowes him delude
When he best weneth / stand in sykernesse
Fortune is aye / so full of brotylnesse
Remouable / and ready for to flytte
Her welfull hour / that who list not amytte
With her favor / for to be allied
Another time / it shall be denied
When he were leuest / find her sauourable
For in some hour / sothly this nofable
Unto some man / she grants his desires
That will not after / in a thousand years
Parauenture / ones condescende
Unto his will / nor his lust him send
As it has fall / this day unhappily
To worthy Ector / that so wyllfully
Wrought of head / greeks for to spare
Fatally when they / were in the snare
For he of them / like a conqueror
With victory / Tryumphe and honor
Might have brought / through his hye renown
The palm of conquest / into troy town
Which he has that day / refused folylye
For as he rode / this Ector cruellye
Among greeks / slow and bare all down
Ca^uelly / he met Thelamowne
I mean Ayax / nigh of his allye
That of hate / and cruel hot envy
To Ector rode / like as he were wood
Albe to him / he was full nigh of blood
Yet for all that / this young lusty knight
Did his power / and his full might
Without faynynge / to have borne him down
Whose Fader hight / also Thelamowne
That him begat / the storye tells thus
Of Exyon^ suster / to Pryamus
And this Ayax / flourynge in young age
Fresshe and deliver / and of great courage
Set on Ector / of knyghtly hye prowess
And as they met / both in their woodnesse
On their stedes / these manly champyownes
Eueryche on other / like Tygres or lyownes
Began to fall / and proudely to assail
And furyously / severe / plate and mayle
First with speres / long large and round
And afterward / with swerdes kene ground
And fighting thus / long they contune
Till it befylle of case / or of Fortune
Token or sign / or some appearance
Or by nature is / kyndely influence
Which into hertes / does full deep mine
Namely of them / that borne be of one line
Which cause was / paraunter of these twanye
Naturally / their rancoure to restrain
And their ire / for to modefye
Only for they / so nigh were of allye
Vnwyst of outher / and thereof unsure
Till they were taught / oonly of nature
For naturally / blood will aye of kind
Draw unto blood / where he may it find
Which made Ector / kyndely to aduerte
To be meuyd / and steryd in his heart
Both of knyghthode / and of gentyllesse
When he of Ayax / saw the worthynesse
Spoke unto him / full benyngnely
And said Cosyn / I say the trewely
If thou list / greeks here forsake
And come to troy / I dare undertake
To thine allies / and to thy kynrede
Thou shalt be there / without any dread
Full well received / in party and in all
Of them that be / of the blood royal
Sothely descended / and highest of degree
That it of right / shall suffyse unto the
And kyndelye / be to the pleasaunce
For to repair / to thine allyaunce
To gentle heart / sithe no thing is so good
As be confedryd / with his own blood
For I conceive / by the worthynesse
Which nature / does in the impresse
Of troyan blood / that thou art descended
Which of greeks / long has be offended
Wherefore I read / to leave them utterly
And he answered again / full humbly
That sythen he / of berthe was a greek
And was of youth / among them fostryde eke
From the time / of his natyuyte
And taken had / the order and degree
Of knyghthode eke / among them aforne
And over this / bound was and sworn
To be true / to their nacyon
Making of blood / none excepcyon
He swore he would / conserve his beheste
And to Ector / he made this request
That if that he / of manfull gentyllesse
Would of knyghthode / and of worthynesse
Show unto him / so great affeccyowne
To make them / that were of Troy town
Oonly withdraw / greeks to pursewe
And for their tents / make them to remewe
And resort again / unto the town
Of knyghthode routhe / and compassy own
Without assayllynge / or any more affraye
Made on greeks / for that ylke day
Sithe unto them / ought Inoughe suffyse
That of the field / in so knyghtly wise
They were of manhood / fully possessours
And of their foomen / finally victours
Like as tofore / fully is diffyned
To whose request / Ector is enclyned
Alas the while / of hasty wylfulnesse
And made anon / without auysenesse
Mydde the field / a trumpet for to blow
Whereby Troyans / fully might know
That he his will / they should them withdraw
After custom / plainly and the law
And the vsaunce / both nigh and far
Among them / that be expert in werre
When they were most / fervent for to fight
Upon greeks / for to preue their might
And had them chacyd / low to the stronde
That they were weyk / of power to withstonde
For they of Troy / all of one desire
Began set on / with shot of wild fire
To brenne their ships / and of hye myschaunce
Finally to put them / at outtraunce.
And so they had / this the very truth
^e had Ector / had upon them routhe
Making Troyans / repair to the town
Vngracyously / to their confusyowne
As the storye / shall after specyfye
For tho he put / alas in Iupardye
Life and death / which might have be sure
The which again / they never shall recure.
How the Greeks sent to king Pryamus for to have trewes for Eight wekes / And
of their Bataylles after the trewes faylled.Ca. xxiij.
THey have matter / to complain sore
For fro that day / farewell for evermore
Victory and laud / fro them of the town
To them denied / by disposicyowne
Of mortal fate / which was contrary
In this matter / me list no longer tarry
For they of Troy / be entered their Cite
And shet their gates / for more surete
For of that day / like as made is mind
Thus was the end / in Euydo as I find
They wend have done / paraunter for the best
And when the son / was ygo to rest
They took their ease / all that ylke night
Till on the morrow / Tytan clear and bright
Shadde his bemys / on their Emysperye
Making the day / for to show merye
At which time / Troyans anon right
They that were hole / and lusty for to fight
Began arm them / in purpose full that day
Their foon to mete / platly if they may
For that was hole / their will and plain intent
And eke they had / in commandment
Tofore of Ector / ready them to make
Out of their sleep / a morrow when they wake
Of which thing / they were not neclygent
But to Pryam / the greeks have ysent
There messangeres / the same day or pryme
To take trewes / oonly for the time
Of eyghte wekes / the which Pryamus
By assent of Ector / the story tells thus
Has granted them / and by auctoryte
Of the wysest / that were in that Cite
In which time / while they leyser have
The greeks began / for to burye and grave
The bodies / that before were slawe
Like the rytys / in their paynem law
With all their might / and their besy cure
For some brent / and by sepulture
Enclosed were / like their estate in all
And thus they held / the feste funeral
Fro day to day / during aye the pees
In which space / I find how Achylles
Of Patroclus / the death has sore playned
As he that was / with terys all be rayned
So inwardely / he loved him in his heart
That for the anguysshe / and the cruel smerte
He long abode / in lamentacyon
And did make / by great affection
A large toumbe / for a remembrance
Myd the field / as tho was the vsaunce
Among greeks / with great reverence
Like the honor / and the excellence
Of royal buryenge / so this Patroclus
Ygraue was / and Protheselaus
In their toumbes / korue of marbyll graye
And nigh togydre / in a plain they lay
The work about them / rychely ywrought
And to the Earth / they were togydre brought
Solempnely / like the obseruaunces
Of their rytys / with the circumstaunces
Of greeks used / sothely in tho days
Fro point to point / as longs to their lays
Of such as were / of the estate royal
So holden was / the feste funeral
Of these two / while the trewes does last
And they of Troy / besyed them full fast
With all their might / and their besy eure
Their grene hurtes / and wounds for to cure
By advise of them / that were in Surgerye
Full well expert / to shape remedy
Sheyr swolle sores / to soft of their pain
That in the space / of these months twain
They were restored / to health in every thing
In which time / Pryamus the king.
Such sorrow made / for Cassybellan
In his heart / that no wight ne can
Him recomforte / of his heaviness
For day by day / of inward tenderness
Full pyteously / he began to sobbe and weep
And the body / he made for to keep
Above the earth / for a certain space
Till he had / chosen out a place
To his buryeng / and his sepulture
And as Guydo / us fully does assure
In venus Temple / rich as any shryne
He made his workmen / a toumbe for to mine
In marbyll graye / and metal rychely
In which he put / full solempnely
The deed corpse / of this Cassybellan
Being present / full many manly man
In the Phane / of Cytherea
The which thing / when that Cassandra
Within her self / considered and beheld
And saw up offered / his helm / and his shield
His sword also / and unto Mars his stead
Of inward woo / she felt her hette blede
Herynge the noise / and the pyteous cry
The tender weeping / and sorowynge utterly
Of them of Troy / and lamentacy own
Which for their friends / through out al y^ town
They began to make / that were slawe before
With sudden rage / her heart was to tore
So inwardely / she might her not restrain
Furyously / to cry and complain
And said alas / full often and wellawaye
O woeful wretches / that ye be this day
Unhappy eke / and graceles also
Infortunat / and inly woo bego
How ye may suffer / the great harms kene
Which ye are lykely / hereafter to sustene
During the sege / in this town beloke
Seeing your foon / ready to be wroke
About you beset / on every side
To be venged / on your great pride
I wot right well / ye may them not eschew
That they ne shall / unto the death pursewe
You euerychone / besegyd in this place
Without mercy / pity or any grace
Alas alas / why ne will ye besy be
Ye woeful wretches / shet in the cite
With the greeks / for to seek pees
Or the sword of vengeance / mercylees
On hye and low / do execucy own
And or this noble / worthy royal town
Euersyd be / and ybrought to naught
Why list ye not / consydre in your thought
How the Modres / with their childresmale
In streets shall / with face deed and pale
Lie mordred there / thorugh greeks cruelte
And young maidens / in captyuyte
Be weep shall / in myserye and who
Their seruytute / and this town also
So famous rich / alas it is pity
With greeks fire / shall destroyed be
In short time / sothly this no were
^leyne of us / alas is bought to dear
Sith for her sake / we shall euerychone
Pore and rich / I except none
An end make / woeful and pyteous
The ire of them / shall be so furyous
Upon us all / there is none other mean
Save oonly death / us to go between
This was the noise / and the pyteous cry
Of Cassandra / that so dredefully
She began to make / about in every street
Thorugh y^ town / whom ever she might mete
Like as she had / be out of her mind
Till Pryamus / fast made her bind
And shytte up / it as the more routhe
She was not herd / albe she said truth
For neither wisdom / nor discrecyon
Counsel nor wit / prudence nor reason
Truth nor read / without any lie
Nor the spirit / of true prophecye
Avails not / nor all such sapyence
In place where / there is no audyence
For be a man / inly never so wise
In counsaylynge / or in hye deuyse
In werkynge outher / or in eloquence
Each thing to se / in his aduertence
Or it be fall / before in his reason
Amyd the Eye / of his discrecyon
Yet for all this / it is the more dole
Without favor / he holden is but a fool
For vnfauoured / wisdom vayleth naught
Neither truth / how dear that it be bought
Like as Cassandra / for all her wise read
Despised was / and taken of no head
Of them of Troy / to their confusyon
But cruelly / ythrowen inpryson
Where a while / I will leave her dwell
And of Greeks / forth I will you tell.
ANd first of all / how Pallamydes
Began to grutche / against them y^ ches
He being absent / king Agamenon
To have lordshyp / or domynacyon
On them all / namely sith that he
Was not worthy / to such dignyte
For to govern so great / a mighty oost
Thorugh out the world / come from every cost
Of kings / princes / so worthy of renown
For he thereof / had indignacy own.
And said himself / was of more poustee
Among greeks / and gretter of degree
Concludynge / that by no manner weye
To his power / he ne would obey
In peace and werre / as by subieccyon
Sith he ne was / at his eleccyon
Platly affermynge / how there were but three
When he was chose / kings of degree
Where as thurty / were that time absent
For which he swore / it was not his intent
Nor according / with his oppynyon
In any wise / that Agamenon
Of Greeks should / have such governance
Lo what myschefe / lies in varyaunce
Among lords / when they not accord
For to draw / fully by one cord
Envy is cause / of such dyuysyon
And Couetyse / of domynacyon
That eueryche would / surmounte his felawe
This cursed vyse / often has withdraw
Hap and grace / in many regyon
For when discord / and false discencyon
Allied ben / in hertes for to strive
Among lords / that kyndh^^ may not thryue
Till they reformed / be again to pees
Among themself / plainly this no lees
Of which thing / greeks took head
And thought not / ferther to proceed
In the matere / that Pallamydes
Ymeued had / among all the prees
And thorugh their wit / they set all in quyete
And made him / his rancour for to let
And to accord / fully in his heart
But now must / I my style again dyuerte
Unto the werre / and tell the manner
After the trewes / how they met yfere.
Like as the storye / makes mencyon
The worthy king / great Agamenon
When the trewes / were passyd and ygone
In all haste / he began ordain anon
With all might / and waker dylygence
Deuoyde of slouthe / and neclygence
To set his wards / full auysely
And to Achylle / he full prudently
The first ward / co^mytteth for to lead
And the second / unto Dyomede.
The third also / to king Menelay
And the fourth / on the same day
^e had Menestee / the Duke of Athene
At his ledynge / in steel armed clean
And other wards / following by and by
Agamanon the king / full manfully
Ordained has / how they shall proceed
As he that was / in all his work and deed
Full circumspect / both in werre and pees
And worthy Ector / was not reckles
To set his wards / of them of the town
In knyghtly wise / of discrecy own
And to Troylus / so young / so fresshe and light
The first ward / with many lusty knight
He has assigned / and other wards set
So prudently / they might be no bet
And forth in haste / him list no longer bide
With many worthy / riding by his side
Out at the gates / he went of the town
Toward greeks / this Troyan champyowne
And first / when he saw the fyerse Achylle
He ne could / no longer keep him stylle
But sinot his horse / felly in the side
And toward him / cruelly began ride
The which thing / with a despytous eye
When Achylles / sothly began espy
Again Ector / of manfull hardynesse
With heart enuyous / began his stead dress
And in the field / togydre / as they met
With round speres / the points kene whette
At the encountrynge / of knyghtly excellence
Eueryche other / thorugh great vyolence
By very force / bare other unto ground
As full often / it happeth and is found
When strong / does mete with his perygall
There is no more / but eueryche had a fall
But Ector first / of strength most assured
His stead again / has anon recured
And left Achylle / tho of gentyllesse
And in great haste / forth he began him dress
Among greeks / and where so that he rode
He killed and slew / all that him withstode
For with his sword / he made their wou^des wide
And thorugh the breast / and some thorugh the side
He percy^ has / and waged them forever
And brake sheltrou^s / and made them to disseuer
For in his heart / him thought it dydehy^ good
To bathe his sword / in the greeks blood
And this continued / till that Achylles
Caughte his stead / again among the prees
And entrede in / among them of troy
And with his sword / he made large weye
Sleeth and bare down / whom y^ ever he met
For there was none / hardy him to let
Till it befell / in his melancoly
^ctor he met / riding sodaynely
And when they saw / each other come a fere
Without abode / eueryche caught a spear
And ran togydre / there was no more areste
But Ector first / smette him in the breast
That his spear / plainly this no tale
All to shyuered / into pieces small
That Achylles / of necessyte
To ground goth / it would none other be
And unhorsed / at the earth lay
And Ector than / in all the haste he may
Enforced him / for to catch his stead
But many a greek / in this great need
Came to rescues / of this Achylles
And for his love / put themself in prees
Through help of whom / his horse he does atta^e
Enhastynge him / with all his might and pain
To be avenged / of his great miurye
And sodaynely / in his wood furye
With a sword / full sharp ground and whette
He smote Ector / upon the basenet
That from his sadell / he made him to remewe
The which stroke / he might not eschew
But for all that / this noble worthy knight
Of very force / thorugh his great might
Maugre his foon / his sadell has recured
As he that was / in manhood most assured
And sodaynely / in heart / he wexed so wroth
That in arage / to Achylles he gothe
And with his sword / so smet him on the head
Thorugh the basenet / that the blood all read
By his face began / to run down
Like a river / his chekes enuyrowne
But he himself / diffendeth as a knight
And tho of new / began the cruel fight
At wene them two / to se that it was wonder
For every stroke / great as dent of thonder
Range in the air / for none would other spare
And this the sothe / in their fight they fare
Like wood Tygres / or bores in their rage
Or stern bulls / when they be savage
That it sempte / in very sothfastnesse
If these two / so full of worthynesse
Contune long / in fighting and endure
The tone or both / of cruel adventure
Must have be deed / of necessyte
The which thing / had be pity
Because they were / worthy knights both
But while that they / in fyghtyng fell and wroth
Most besy were / the greeks to begin
With their wards / for to enter inn
And they of Troy / the storye makes mind
On their party / left not behind
But in the field / enhaste them euerychone
In knyghtly wise / to mete with their fone
That with the prease / here and also yonder
The knights two / seueryd were a sonder
And tho came in / stern Dyomede
With the knights / which he did led
Full lustely / in the selue place
With whom has met / proudely in the face
Whorthy Troylus / on his horse back
That never had / yet in manhood lack
And as they country / the storye does us lere
Eueryche unhorsed / knyghtly has his fere
But first his horse / recureth Dyomede
And in all haste / began him speed
To assail Troylus / stondynge upon foot
And when he saw / there was none other bote
As knyghtly yet / as ever did man
Against him / diffende him tho began
But Dyomede / hot as any fire
Wonder enuyous / and hateful of desire
With his sword / of rancour for the nones
The rich Cercle / full of ynde stones
That was that time / on Troylus basenet
Full cruelly / has racyd of and smet
But Troylus ne would / for all yt him wtdrawe
For him diffendynge / he has the stead slawe
On which sat / that time Dyomede
That maugre him / he must alyght need
And when they were / on foot both twain
They did their might / and their cruel pain
Eueryche of them / other to assail
With swerdes sharp / so that plate and mayle
They began to severe / and a sonder race
As wood lions / with mortal chere and face
Till the Greeks / strong stout and fell
As mine Auctour / in his book can tell
Have thorugh their might / made Dyomede
Sodaynely / to recure a stead
And Troyan knights / on the the other side
Have Troylus brought / a stead for to ride
And when they were / horsed both two
Without more / again togydre they go
With strong foynes / and yfere ran
Each at other / as felly as they can
Till at the last / cruel Dyomede
Like as ye may / in mine Auctour read
Were it by case / hap / or adventure
In which no man / fully may assure
Or by Fortune / with her false vysage
Had that time / of Troylus a vauntage
For he on him / was fall at myschese
The which thing / to him was no reprefe
Though he him took / among so great aroute
On every half / with greeks set about
Sith doutous ever / is the fine of fight
Now up / now down / now derk and after bright
For no wight may / be aye victoryous
In peace nor werre / nor ylyche Eurous
Let every man / sith hap is set in doubt
Take his turn / as it comes about
Though troylus now / was take of dyomede
Another time / he shall him quyte his mede
For as the storye / tells in this place
This Dyomede / but a little space
Troylus ladde / forth as prysonere
That to reskewes / in steel armed clear
Many Troyan / came pryckynge in this need
That maugre all / the might of Dyomede
They Troylus have / from his hands take
And tho began / the slaughter for his sake
On every half / that wonder is to tell
Of the Troyans / and the Greeks fell
Than into field / is entrede Menelay
Which on Troyans / all that ylke day
Full besy was / avenged for to be
To them he had / so cruel enmyte
And when Paris / saw him in the field
Toward him / the right way he held
And of purpose / they their wards set
Each on other / till they togydre met
And tho the skarmysshe / and the slaughter began
On outher part / of many manly man
And all this while / Ector ne would cease
Among greeks / cruelly to prease
And new and new / of him as I read
A like fresshe / the blood of them to shede
For of his sword / the traces were ysene
That the greeks / might not sustene
To resyste / nor stand before his face
But where he rode / aye they gave him place
Till that aknyght / which Boetes hight
Young of age / when he had a sight
How Ector slew / the Greeks mortally
On every side / having no mercy
He presyd in / to increase his name
Perpetuelly / to purchase him a fame
And furyously / in heart not afferde
He cast him platly / to mete him in the berde
The which thing / when Ector began aduerte
So hye raucour / enbracyd has his heart
That with his sword / of indignacyowne
He rofe him / even to the navel down
Fro the crown / with so great a pain
That in the field / he partyd lay in twain
And Ector tho / assygned has his stead
To a squire / and bad he should it led
To troy town / without more abode
And all this while / furyously he rode
Among Greeks / and ever mercylees
He slew all the / that put them self in prees
And shadde their blood / of heart despytous
The which thing / when king Archylogus
Riding beside / saw and began espy
How Boetes / his cosyn and allye
So cruelly was / of Ector slawe
Toward him / in haste he began him draw
Upon his death / avenged for to be
And tode at him / with great cruelte
Fully in purpose / Ector for to quyte
And sodaynely / as he began at him smite
Ector unawarely / hit him on the head
So myghtely / that he fell down deed
Partyd on two / by cruel adventure
Natwithsta^dyng / his mighty strong armure
Again his stroke / it was of no diffence
For it was given / with such vyolence
That it help him / in no manner thing.
And than anon / Prochenor the king
Of hateful ire / and fool hardynesse
Of surquedye / and of hastynesse
Of melancolye / and indignacyon
Caught in his heart / a presumpcyon
To assail Ector / of inward folly pride
And goth to him / a trauerse on the side
Furyously / with a despytous heart
That his coming / he might not aduerte
Oonly for he came at his back behind
And unawarely / in Guydo as I find
And Ector smote / from his horse to ground
In whom there was / so much manhood found
That he anon / with a knyghtly heart
Without abode / into his sadell sterte
And right fyersly / Prothen or purseweth
That finally his hand / he not escheweth
For with his sword / he marked him so well
Thorugh basenet / by his breast of stele
That into twain / without any fail
He roof him down / into his paunce of mayle
And he fell down / in full pyteous wise
Of which stroke / the greeks sore agryse
And specially / the hardy fyerse Achylle
When he beheld / lyked full ylle
For Phothenor / was his nigh cosyne
And descendyd / of the same line
For death of whom / he has such heaviness
So inward thought / and so great distress
In all this world / he ne wyste what to do
For him he had / so much pain and woe
And for the death / of Archylogus
To be avenge / he was full desirous
And in his heart / many way he cast
And in the wards / began to seek fast
With many greek / on Ector to have fall
Conspyred fully in soth among them all
Of one intent / Ector to assail
But all for naught / it would not avail
He was that day / so cruel in his rage
They might of him / have none advantage
And Troyan knights / by favor of Fortune
Upon Greeks / so myghtely contune
Thorugh conueyinge / of Ector and his might
That they anon / have them put to flight
And to their tents / maugre who that strive
In their pursuyte / for wounded they them drive
That here and there / they lay in aswowe
And many a greek / mercyles they slow
The long day / till it drew to night
And sothly than / for very lack of light
These troyan knights / full worthy of renown
About Ector / repair to the town
And enter in / with honor and with glory
That day of greeks / having the victory
And thus I leave them / in their town within
And forth of Greeks / tell I will begin.

Of Phoebus absence / and the derke night
And twylyght hatte / for it is a mean
Of day and night / departing them between

With bright sterrys / in the evening
AT which time / Agamenon the king
For his lords / sodaynely has sent
To come echone / anon / into his tent
And when they were / assembled all yfere
Tryst and heavy / and with a sorefull chere
They began y^ slaughter / of Ector to complain
Affermyng plainly / they might never attain
Unto victory / while he were a live
Wherefore they began / to conspyre blyue
The death of him / in many sundry weye
Echone concludynge / while he were in Troy
It was not lykely / Greeks for to win
For he alone / of them that were withinne
Was chief diffence / and proteccy own
And soueraynely / vpholder of the town
Their mighty Castle / and their strong wall
And unto greeks / dedely foo mortal
For they ne might / his great force endure
Nor never a right / again their foos be sure
He standing hole / they said in no degree
Nor while he floureth / in Felycyte
Wherefore echone / of one entencyon
They condescende / to this conclusyon
That by some sleyghte / of awayte lymge
When he were most besy / in fighting
Among them / in myschefe or distress
That Achylles / do his business
With all his might / unawarely him to assail
That him to slay / for no thing that he fail
And greeks all / began their prayer make
To Achylles / for to undertake
Of this Empress / finally the suit
Thorugh his manhood / that it be execute
The hasty death / of their mortal foo
And Achylles / without words moo
Their request / assenteth to parfourme
And to their lust / began holy him confourme
For that time / let him beware I read
To be to hasty / this iourne for to speed
Upon Ector / his power for to kythe
List Fortune / a wrong her face wrythe
To look on him / with a froward chere
Him to bring / unto his hands nere
Thorugh sort or hap / of Ector folylye
To put his life / of death in Ieopartye
List unto him / it hap even lyche
To fall hymsefe / in the same dyche
That he for Ector / compassed has and shape
For it is wonder / if that he escape
Sith Ector had / without any dread
As brennynge ire / and as great hatrede
To Achylles / his death for to puruey
If he him found / or in place sey
Conuenyent / for execucyon
I trow there should / him gain no raunson
Nor other mede / his heart to quyete
But only death / when so that they mete
This the end / and fine of this matere

And thus Greeks / made have an end
Of their counsel / and an one they wend

Her childrens death / every somer morrow
This to say / when the dew so soote
Enbawmed has / the flower and eke the root

When the lark / messager of day
Of custom aye / Aurora does salve
With sundry notes / her sorrow to transmue
Or Phoebus rise / to joy and gladness
Thorugh Armonye / to leave her heaviness
Taking her leave / with saint John^ to borowe
The same time / Greeks by the morrow
With lusty heart / erely did arise
And armed them / in all their best wise
For they them cast / that day for to goon
Into the field / to mete with their foon
And Ector has / the same morrow also
I cast him fully / with greeks have ado
And issued is knyghtly / out of troy
In heart he has / so great desire and joy
The same day / with greeks for to fight
And with him ladde / many lusty knight
Of such as were / of the Cite borne
And forth he rode / himself all aforne
And Eneas / with many a worthy
Followed after / wonder fast by
And Paris than / and next him Dephebus
And sithe Troylus / that was couragyous
With all the wards / made of troy town
In wiche as Dares / makes mencyowne
Within his book / there were on troy side
Of fighting men / that went and did ride
An hundred thousand / armed for to go
Into the field / and fyfty thousand mo
Which have them cast / that day or at eve
Of one intent / Greeks for to grieve
And so they met / strongly on outher side
And began assemble / and togydre ride
Full cruelly / and with great hatrede
And with them tho / that Paris did led
He entrede in / full mighty strong Archeres
Of Perce land / and many Arbalasteres
that with their arrows / fyled sharp and round
And with quarelles / square whette and ground
Full many greek / has reuyd of his life
And amyddes / of this mortal strife
Agamenon / into the field is come
Toward whom / Ector has ynome
The right way / and threw him of his stead
Among his knights / that he did led
He spared naught / for all the great prees
And therwithall / anon came Achylles
That in awayte / of Ector had layne
And sodaynely / with all his might and pain
Ector he smote / on the head so sore
That with ye stroke / mine Auctour says no more
His basenet / was bowed and ycrased
Of which stroke / Ector not amassed
On Achylles / should anon yfalle
Ne had Eneas / with his knynghtes all
And worthy troylous / come and go between
The which twain / with their swerdes kene
Began Achylles / felly for to assail
To hew his plates / and to perce his mayle
And tho began / the slaughter / on every side
Of men of foot / and of them that ride
Like a condyte / their wounds began blede
And in this while / cruel Dyomede
Were it by hap / adventure or caas
So as he rode / has met with Eneas
And right anon / as he had him found
He smet at him / and gave him such a wound
That lykely was / he should not recure
But if thereto / be do the better cure
And thereupon / full despyteously
This Dyomede / in his melancoly
Repreuyd has / this troyan knight Enee
And said to him / all heyle for thou art he
That whylom gave / to Pryamus the king
A fell counsel / hasty and bytynge
Me for to a slain / by sudden vyolence
When I was last / at troy in his presence
That trust me well / and have it well in mind
Amyd the field / if I the efte find
Thou shall thy counsel / mortally repent
If that Fortune / here after will assente
To bring the / a right unto my hand
At good leyser / here in thine own land
I am full set / thy labor for to quyte
and here my troth / this sword shall kerue and byte
So kenely / thy troyan blood to shede
That finally / death shall be thy mede
The which I bear / atwene my hands twain
And with that word / he might hy^ not restrain
This Dyomede / but rode all sodaynely
Upon Enee / and so furyously
He smote at him / this hardy cruel knight
With such a pain / and so great a might
That from his horse / he made him for to fall
Maugre the might / of his knights all
The which stroke / he lyked full ylle
And in this while / Ector has Achylle
Assailed so / that thorugh his basenet
He perced has / and with his sword him smet
And so narowe / brought him to the point
Of hye myschefe / and in such disioynt
Constrained him / that of necessyte
He had him take / ne had oonly be
Sudden rescues / of his chyualrous
That called is / the sone of Tydeus
I mean the fell / fyerse Dyomede
Which Achylles / has helped in this need
For he thorugh force / of his arms twain
Smote Ector tho / with so great a pain
That he him gave / a wound full grievous
But he no thing / mine Auctour writes thus
Astoned was / this knight this manly man
But with his swerd / in all the haste he can
Smote Dyomede / so furyous and wroth
That from his horse / to the earth he gothe
For all his pride / and his surquedrye
The which anon / as Troylous did espy
Without abode / down of his stead a light
With Dyomede / a foot for to fight
And each of them / in sothfastnesse than
Aquyte himself / like a manly man
That nouther was / in much nor lyte
In no degree / of manhood for to wit
And while they faught / Ector and Achylles
Togydre met / again among the prees
And ran yfere / fyersly in their rage
As wood lions / when they be ramage
Right so in sothe / they fared in their fyghtyng
And in that time / Menelay the king
Full proudely shope him / troyans for to mete
Vlixes eke / and also Polymete
And after him came / Neptolonyus
Pallamydes / and eke Scelemus
Duke Menestee / Nestor and Thoas
Currynulus / and Phylotheas
And Theseus / as it is made mind
With his knights / proudely came behind
And on the party / of them of the town
Came all the kings / without excepcyowne
That were assembled / into their diffence
Again Greeks / to make resystence
Except the knights / which Ector ladde
And the wards / that he made had
The same day / as says the Latin book
In knyghtly wise / the field when yt he took
And tho began / the fell mortal fight
In which that day / full many worthy knight
In Fatyshondes / finally are fall
And of Fortune / among the wards all
Agamenon / the noble mighty king
All sodaynely / as he came riding
Pantysylaus / in his way met
Against whom / anon his horse he set
And he to him / full knyghtly rode again
And as they met / there is no more to said
On horsbacke / whiles they were wroth
Of vyolence / they were unhorsed both
And Menelay / Paris met of new
The which two / well togydre knew
Full desirous / each other for to dear
But Menelay / caught first a spear
And hytte Paris / with all his inward cure
But for surenesse / of his strong armure
And mighty plates / his wound was but small
Which in effect / grieved not at all
But with that stroke / unto ground he gothe
Of which fall / Paris wexed right wroth
Wonder confuse / and also read for shame
Lest the report / in hyndrynge of his name
Came to the erys / of the Queen Eleyne
How he that day / might not atteyne
With Menely / to hold chaumpartye
Lykely to sown / into his vylonye
The which at heart / grieved him full sore
And Adrastus / the king without more
So as he rode / the king Vlixes fond
and knyghtly both / they fought hand to hand
And as they faughte / down to the earth low
From his horse / Vlixes has him throw
And full proudely / in sign of this victory
He sent his horse / home to his Tentorye
And in that time / among all the prees
Full sodaynely / king Pallamydes
Is fall on Hupon / with his locks hoar
And in his Ire / wounded him so sore
That he fell deed / and grouelyng to ye ground
His mortal sword / was so kene ground
Beside whom / Neptolonyus
Assailed has / king Archylogus
The which himself / manly began diffende
But as they faught / and many strokes spend
In their diffence / it would be none other
Eueryche of them / has unhorsed other
And tho came in / riding on his stead
Pollydamas / and began to take heed
Among the renges / a little him beside
Where as the king / Pallamydes does ride
And cruelly / so like a manly man
He smote his stead / and to him he ran
And maugre his might / and his worthynesse
As the storye plainly / bears witness
Oonly to venge / the death of king Hupowne
From his stead / he proudely bare him down
And in his rancoure / and his cruel hete
Of that despyte / began him to rehete
And tho beside / the king Scelenus
Of dedely hate / and heart full Irous
With king Carras / by adventure has met
And furyously / from his stead smet
And than also / the king Phylymene
Is on the Duke / fall of Athene
That maugre / both his manhod / and his might
He has his horse / berafte him in this fight
And ladde with him / proudely by his side
Where as him list / that it should abide
And Phyloteas / the worthy king also
The selue time / with Remus had ado
And every other / sothly as I read
His felawe has made / to void his stead
And Theseus / the king / yt was so strong
Amyd the field / so as he rode among
In the great prese / has met Curyalus
The worthy king / of knyghthod right famous
And both two / in arms wonder strong
By themself / faught at leyser long
Till each other / with wounds fresshe and grene
Fro horsbak / his felawe threw endlo^g ye grene
And afterward / I find how they two
Upon foot / knyghtly had ado
They were in arms / somly desirous
And of manhood / passyngly famous
And all this while / the sons naturell
Of Pryamus / bare them wonder well
Among greeks / up and down riding
And prudently / togydre abiding
Made a slaughter / of greeks full pytous
Of kings / dukes / and lords right famous
And as I read / how worthy Thelamowne
That time met / with king Sapedowne
And with their speres / squared full sharply
Eueryche has other / wounded mortally
Thorugh shield and plate / and haberion of mayle
That as the storye / makes rehersayle
How their harneys / wexed of blood all read
And how they fylle / almost both deed
At great myschefe / among the horse feet
Of whose bledynge / the soil began wexe weet
Thorugh their harneys / as it can distylle
Whiles king Thoas / and the fyerse Achylle
As they that were / of kynne and allied
Amyd the field / Ector have espied
Where as he faught / beset amyd his foon
And upon him / of one accord they goon
And mortally / if it would avail
On every half / they began him new assail
And of hate / in heart borne of yore
They have beset / this Troyan knight so sore
That they alas / from his head has smet
By vyolence / his rich basenet
And wounded him / felly on the head
But for all that / he ne took no head
This worthy man / flower of Chyualrye
But him diffendynge / tho so myghtely
King Thoas smet him / in the face so
That with a stroke / he rafte his nose a two
And shorted it / by the half dele
To which stroke / the brother naturele
Of manly Ector / fast began them hye
To socoure him / when they first espy
His great myschefe / and at their in coming
They so manly / bare them in fighting
Again greeks / that Thoas they have take
And The^amon / so they made awake
With new assaute / of sharp wounds kene
That he was take / and left upon the grene
And of his men / borne home to his tent
And king Thoas / home to troy is went
Maugre greeks / which help hy^ may no more
For Dephebus / and also Anthenore
Have sent him / forth to Troy the cite
And Menelay / tho began to se
So as he rode / Paris stand a side
And shope him shortly / of hate and cruel pride
If it would fall / on his chance
Sodaynely / to ymen him myschaunce
But he was ware / and kept himself so narowe
That Menelay / he marked with an arowe
The head of which / with venym was enoynt
Intoxycate / at the square point
That the king / of that dredefull wound
All dispayred / of his men was found
Which in great haste / bare him to his tent
And he anon / for Surgyens has sent
Which first the head / took out of his wound
Albe it was / yperced full profounde
Thorugh his harneys / full deep into the bone
But cunnyngely / they did their craft echone
To draw it out / with their Instruments
And subtylly / with certain oyntementes
They serched have / the wound enuyron
To make it clean / from corrupcyon
And prudently / first they took head
That the venym / further not proceed
Round in compass / clensyd it about
And after that / bound it sure without
And defensyues / made on every side
And Menelay / no longer would abide
But bad in haste / bring forth his stead
In purpose full / Paris to quyte his mede
If he him find / the self same day
Him list no longer / put it in delay
What ever fall / of his grene wound
And forth he rode / till he has him found
By adventure / unarmed in the field
Without sword / pollex / spear or shield
Or bow in hand / were it of reklesnesse
Or to refresshe him / after werynesse.
And Menelay / anon a spear has take
And in his ire / ^elly began it shake
Toward Paris / by great auysenesse
And should have slain him / as by lyklynesse
Ne had Eneas / which all this thing beheld
Bore of the stock / with his strong shield
To diffende him / in this adventure
Destytute / and naked / of armure.
Paris that time / in such peril was
Wherefore in haste / has this Eneas
Ordained knights / armed bright in steel
About Paris / for to keep him well
From all myschefe / and confusyowne
Him to convey / unto Troy town
Right in despyte / of king Menelay
Which in awayte / so for Paris lay
Whom Ector / had ytaken sodaynely
And unto Troy / ladde him utterly
Ne had Greeks come / in his diffence
Against him / to make resystence.
Of which Ector / as they came in his weye
Full many Greek / made for to deye
And the remenaunt / put unto the flyghte
That thorugh his ma^hod / y^ day and his might
Troyans made / the greeks for to flee
Unto their tents / of necessytee
And them to sewe / ne would never leave
But slay and kill / till it drew to eve
That Phoebus began / fast for to weste
To draw them home / they thought for ye best
For Tytan was / at his going down
When they began enter / into troy town
Their gates shet / they to their lodging wend
And of this day / thus they made an end
Till on the morrow / that the rows read
Of Phoebus carte / gonne for to sprede
Before his vpryste / in the Oryent
At which time / king Pryamus has sent
For such as were / with him most pryue
And of his counsel / inwardely secre
And specially / he sent for by name
For worthy Ector / that grettest was of fame
For Paris eke / and for Dephebus
And for Troylus / fresshe and desirous
For Anthenor / and Pollydamas
And for the Troyan / called Eneas
For he that day / cast him not to goon
Into the field / to mete with his foon
And when they were / to his Paleys come
These lords have / the right way nome
Unto the king / within his closet
And when the hussher / has the door shet
And eueryche had / like to his degree
His place take / and his dew see
This worthy king / as made is mencyon
Began to declare / his hertes mocyon
And his menynge / before them specifye
And said syres / in whom I most affye
To you is known / how king Thoas is here
In this cite / taken prysonere
And is as yet / belocked in prysowne
Which ever has be / unto Troy town
An enemy great / unto his power
And us offendyd / both far and ner
In many wise / all be we little retche
As far as he / his force / might stretche
And now with Greeks / came to sege our town
As he that will not / our destruccyowne
And thereupon / has do his business
Wherefore of dome / and of rightwysnesse
Both of reason / and of equity
I say plainly / as seems unto me
So that it be / to you acceptable
And that ye think / my counsel commendable
Like as he has / cast our death and shape
I hold rightful / that he not escape
But that of death / he receive his guerdon
For right requereth / and also good reason
that death for death / is skylfull guerdonnynge
Unto my wit / and right well sitting
Say your advise / now plainly in this caas
And first of all / tho spoke Eneas
And said lord / so it be none offense
To your highness / to give me audyence
Thorugh supporte here / of them yt be full wise
I shall reherce plainly / my deuyse
What is to work / as in this matere
Me seems first / my lyege lord so dear
That your noble / royal excellence
Consydre should / with full hye prudence
In every work / and operasyon
To cast before / in conclusyon
To cast before / in conclusyon
The fynall end / that may after sewe
For to a wise man / oonly is not dew
To se the gynnynge / and the end naught
But both attones / peyse in his thought
And weye them / ^o justly in balaunce
That of the fine / follow no repentance
Why I say this / and platly why I mean
Is for that ye / ought for to seen
How king Thoas / is one of the pryncypall
Among Greeks / and of the blood royal
If ye consydre / descended as by line
Wherefore if he / have this foul a fine
To be slain / while he is in prison
It might happen / in conclusyon
That ye and youres / that thereto assente
Here afterward / sore to repent
I preue it thus / that if by adventure
Of Fortune / that no man may assure
Some of your lords / were a another day
Of greeks take / as it hap may
Or of your sons / so worthy of renown
Or of kings / that be in this town
Trust me well / that such gentyllesse
As ye show to them / in their distress
They will you quyte / when in case semblable
Fortune to them / they find favorable
The which no man / co^strayne may nor bind
Wherefore my lord / have this thing in mind
For if Thoas / of short auysement
Shall now be deed / thorugh hasty judgment
Another day / Greeks will us quyte
And for rygour / make their malys byte
On some of youres / who ever that it be
And nouther spare / hye nor low degree
Though he were / paraunter of your blood
The which thing / for all this worlds good
It might fall / that ye ne would se
Wherefore I read / let king Thoas be
Honestely keep / in prysowne
Like his estate / stylle here in this town
List as I said / that another day
Some lord of youres / as it hap may
Casuelly / were take of adventure
By eschaunge of him / ye might best recure
Without strife / your own man again
In this matter / I can no more said
But finally / this my full read
To which counsel / Ector took good head
And for it was / according to reason
He it commends / in his oppynyon
But Pryam ever / of one entencyon
Stood always fyx / to this conclusyon
Plainly affermynge / if Greeks may espy
That we this king / spare of gentrye
They will arrecte / it cowardyse anon
That we dare not / venge us on our foone
For very dread / having no hardynesse
Nor heart nouther / to do rightwysenesse
Yet nevertheless / after your assent
That he shall live / I will in mine intent
To your desire / fully condescende
And of this counsel / so they made an end
Without more / save Eneas is go
And Trylous eke / and Anthenor also
Into an halle / excellynge of beauty
The queen Eleyne / of purpose for to se
With whom was eke / Eccuba the queen
And other ladies / goodly on to seen
And many maid / that young and lusty was
And worthy Troylus / with this Eneas
Did their labor / and their besy pain
For to comfort / the fair queen Eleyne
As she that stood / for the werre in dread
But for all that / of very womanhede
Thylke time / with all her heart entere
As she well could / make them good chere
Having of conning / inly suffysaunce
Both of chere / and of dalyaunce.
And Eccuba being / in this halle
Very example / unto women all
Of bounte having / soueraygne excellencce
In wisdom eke / and in eloquence
Besought them / tho wonder womanly
And counsayled eke / full prudently
For any haste / both nigh and far
Auysely / to keep them in the werre
And not Iuparte / their bodies folylye
But to aduerte / and cast prudently
In diffence / knyghtly of the town
Them to govern / by discrecyowne
She spoke of faith / and could no thing feyne
And than of her / and after of Eleyne
They took leave and no longer dwell
But went their way / and forth I will you tell
How the Greeks / on the same morrow
Among them self / complain and make sorrow
Their harms great / in Murmur and in rage
The loss / the costs / and the great damage
That they have / enduryd folylye
Lasting the werre / and wyste never why
The death the slaughtre / of many worthy man
Sith the time / that the werre began
Hunger and thirst / watch and cold also
Full great vnreste / sorrow thought and woe
And all togydre / for a thing of naught
In sothfastnesse / if the ground be sought
This was the noise / and rumor eke that ran
Thorugh out the host / yt day fro man to man
And most among / the pore souldy ours
Which bare the bronte / ever of such shoures
And the myschefe / of werre comenlye
And though they plain / they have no remedy
Of things which sytte / them full vnsofte
And thus greeks / complained have full often
Of many myschefe / that has on them fall
The which they might / have eschewed all
If they ne had / of folly gonne a werre
Out of Greece / not come half so far
To their myschefe / and confusyon
This was that day / their lamentacyon.
Which to increase / the same next night
So derked was / without sterre light
So cloudy black / and so thycke of air
Dymmyd with skies / foul and no thing fair
So wyndy eke / with tempest all be layne
Almost fordrenchyd / with the smoky rain
And in the field / astoned here and yonder
With sudden stroke / of the dredefull thonder
And with opening / of the hydous leuene
That it sempte / in the hye heuene
The Cataractys / had be undo
For the clouds / and skies both two
Sodaynely wexen / were so blake
Like as the gods / would have taken wrake
And had of new / assentyd be in oon
The land to drenche / of Deucalyon
And all this world / without more refuge
To ouerflowe / with a fresshe deluge
The wind also / so sternely began blow
That their tents / stondynge on a row
For possyd were / and ybete down
And furyously / to their confusyowne
The floodes raughte / the^ fro their sta^dyng place
And bare them forth / a full large space
Whereof in myschefe / and in great distress
In great labor / and hertely heaviness
The greeks bydde / all the same night
What for the tempest / and for lack of light
Till the floode / began again withdraw
The wind to appese / and the day began dawe
And the heaven / began again to clear
Without clouds / fresshely to appear
And Phoebus eke / with a fervent hete
Had on the soil / dried up the wete
And the moisture / enuyrowne on the plain
And greeks had / their tents set again
And were adawed / of their nyghtes sorrow
Thorugh the aperynge / of the galde morrow
They them arrayed / nothing for the pees
And into the field / first went Achylles
As ye shall here / of entencyowne
That day to fight / with them of Troy town.
When dried was / the lusty large plain
with phoebus bemys / as ye have herd me say^e
The troyan knights / full worthy of renown
Descendyd be / and ycome down
And in the field / took their fighting place
But Achylles / to mete them in the face
Tofore went out / like as I you told
With his lords / and his knights bold
And first I find / without more abode
Unto Hupon / furyously he rode
I mean Hupon / that was of his stature
Like a Geaunt / as books us assure
Whom Achylles / with his sharp spear
Thorugh the body / percyd him so fere
That he fylle deed / his wound was so kene
And after this / the king Octamene
As he fyersly / on Ector would have gone
Without abode / Ector him siewe anon
And cruelly / quytte him his fatal mede
And sodaynely / against Dyomede.
As zantipus / the worthy king began draw
Full pyteously / he of him was slawe
And right anon / the king Epyscrophus
And eke the king / that hight Cedyus
Of one assent / proudely in battle
Begone Ector / mortally to assail
And with a spear / first Epyscrophus
Ran at him / with heart despytous
And as Guydo / also does deuyse
Rebukyd him / in ungoodly wise
To him so sore / in heart he was a meued
Whereof Ector / furyously agreued
Has mortally / his wound made so large
That him ne geyneth / plate / shield / nor targe
For he fill deed / among his men echone
To whom Ector / bad he should gone
To the Furyes / deep down in hell
Such words / among them to tell
For here quod he / men take of them no head
And thus when he / was waged for his mede
Anon his brother / called Cedyus
Such sorrow made / for Epyscrophus
So hertely dole / and so woeful chere
That pity was / for to se and here
So inwardly / on his death he thought
And with a thousand knights / yt he brought
To be avenged / by manhood of them all
Despyteously / on Ertor / he is fall
Where he him found / fighting with his foon
That thorugh the force / of them euerychoon
So sore enuyrowne / they have him beset
That from his stead / down they have hy^ smet
Whom Cedyus / aye in his cruel rage
When that he saw / to his advantage
Ector unhorsed / and he on his stead
His sword he left / of inwardely hatrede
Markynge at him / with so great a pain
With all the force / of his arms twain
Fully in purpose / without more delay
To slay Ector / plainly if he may
But or his stroke / descend might down
Ector of hate / and indignacyowne
With his sword / that was full sharp whet
From his shuldre / has his arm of smet
And after that / he reuyd him his life
Than Eneas / amyddes all this strife
Came riding in / wood and furyous
And as he met / the king / Amphymacus
He fell on him / and slew him in his rage
And from greeks / holding their passage
There came down / first Menelaus
And after him / king Thelamonyus
The great Duke / also of Athene
In whom there was / so much manhood seen
Vlixes eke / and cruel Dyomede
And eke also / to help them in their need
There came with them / the king Machaon
And alderlaste / the great Agamenon
With all their wards / and fill in suddenly
Upon Troyans / and they full manfully
Diffende them self / again the Greeks proud
And put them of / full knyghtly as they could
And each on other / sothly as they met
With spear and sword / enuyously they set
So mortal hate / there was them between
And when the son / was in merydyen
In myd day angel / passing hot and shene
The greeks / began felly in their tene
So myghtely / to fall on them of Troy
That they them made / for to give weye
Of very force / and necessyte
And Achylles / so full of cruelte
Among the renges / as he began him draw
The king Phylem / enuyously has slawe
And amyd of greeks / the same time Ector
Maugre them all / slew king Alphenor
And eke the king / called Dorous
On them he was / so cruel and yrous
That thorugh virtue / of his knyghtly hand
Troyans have won / again their land
Upon greeks / and made them for to flee
And thylke hour / from Torye the Cytee
Epyscrophus / full of manlynesse
The field has take / thorugh his worthynesse
And on greeks / proudely for the nones
With his knights / he falls all attones
And severed them / and made them for to twynne
And began the field / fast upon them win
Having that time / in his company
Among other / that he did guye
Acertayne Archer / the which as I find
Was monstrous / and wonderful of kind
For from the myddell / up unto the crown
He was a man / and the remenaunt down
Bare of an horse / lyknesse and figure
And horses here / this monstre in nature
Had on his skyn / growing enuyrowne
Full rough / and thycke / and of his voice ye sown
Was like the neyhynge / of an horse I read
And though his face / both in length and bread
Of shape were mannysshe / yet in suthfastnesse
His color was / semblable in lyknesse
Unto the Fery hoote / breynnynge glede
Whose Eyes eke / flawmynge also read
As the blase / of an oven mouth
And for he was / in syghte so vnkouthe
Where so ever / he was met in the berde
Both man and horse / sore were a ferde
His face was / so hateful and so odyble
And his look / so hydous / and horrible
And aye he had / in custom and vsaunce
As in books / is made remembrance
For to go / unarmed into field
Without sword / spear / axe / or shield
For he no thing / could of that myster
But as I find / he was a good archer
And bare a bow / styffe and wonder strong
And for he was / also of tyller long
His arrows were like / to his tyller
In a busshement / trussed wonder ner
By his side / aye ready to his hand
Where so he were / outher on see or land
And as I find / how that none armure
Again his shot / plainly might endure
And there was horse / stead nor courser
That durst abide / nouther fer nor ner
But fled anon / with all their full might
As fast as they / of him had a sight
To them he was / so passing odyous
So like a devil / and so monstrous
And there was found / none so hardy a knight
On horse back / that had force or might
To hold his horse / when they might him se
But that anon / a back he would fle
And of this Archer / I find written eke
That he that day / slew full many greek
And wounded them / with his arrows kene
Thorugh out ye plates / forged bright and shene
For there was none / before him that abode
But to their Tents / fast away they rode
They might not / his hydous look endure
Till there befell / a wonder aduerture
While they of Troy / by help of this Archer
Sewe on the chase / to their lodging ner
And slew of them / in myschefe and in dread
Beside a Tent / met Dyomede
With this Archer / of necessyte
For it stood so / that he ne might him fle
No manner way / nor a back remewe
For life nor death / he might him not eschew
So many Troyan / was tho at his back
In his flyinge / he had go to wrack.
Wherefore anon / this worthy Dyomede
With cruel heart / fast began him speed
And toward him / proudely for to dress
But this Archer / by great aduysenesse
First with an arrowe / smette Dyomede
Thorugh his harneys / that he made him blede
Of which stroke / he wexed so wood and wroth
That to this monstre / so hydous and so loathe
He went a pase / and him unarmed fond
And with ye sword / that he held in his hand
He gave to him / his last fatal wound
That he fylle deed / grouelynge unto ye ground
The death of whom / greeks reioysynge
and in all haste / their hertes resumynge
Began them self / for to recomforte
And into Field / proudely they resort
By conueyinge / of Polixenare
The worthy Duke / that so well him bare
Upon Troyans / that day in the field
But when Ector / the slaughtre of him beheld
Upon this Duke / anon he began to set
And on their stedes / fyersly as they met
Ector him slew / of full great hatrede
And after that / on Gallathe his stead
So as he rode / forth among the prees
Or he was ware / he met Achylles
And with their speres / long large and round
In purpose fully / each other to confound
They ran yfere / Irous and right wroth
That with ye stroke / they were unhorsed both
But Achylles / with a despytous heart
First as I read / into his sadell sterte
And besy was / with all his inward pain
Gallathe / to take by the reyne
Thereof for ever / Ector to depryue
And bad his men / to lead it home as blyue
So that Ector / there was none other bote
Full like a man / faught stondynge on foot
Among greeks / and his fomen all
And to his knights / loud he began to call
For his stead / that they should sewe
And they in haste / his horse to reskewe
Ben attones / fallen on Achylle
And maugre him / of force again his will
They have from him / berafte it on the plain
And to Ector / restored it again
Which in knyghthode / somoche hy^ self assures
Despyte of them / his sadell he recureth
Which afterward / full dear they aboughte
For like a lion / all that day he wroughte
Among them / riding here and there
And as the death / they fled his sword for fere
Thorugh whose manhood / troyans eft begin
Upon greeks / the field again to win
But it befell / amyd their great fight
That Anthenor / a certain Troyan knight
Among the prese / is so fer in gone
That of Greeks / he was take anon
And to their tents / sent in haste he was
Albe his sone / called Pollydamas
To reskue him / did his dylygence
So manfully / that no neclygence
Was found in him / who so list to seek
And that full dear / a boughte many greek
The same day / thorugh his worthynesse
But for cause / oonly of derkenesse
And for that it / began draw toward night
They made an end / oonly for lack of light
And greeks went / home to their lodging
And eke Troyans / till on the morning
That Phoebus / began his bright bemys show
And Aurora / new began to dew
The Erbys sote / and the grene leuys
Both on hayes / and in fresshe greuys
Silver bright / with round perlys fine
That so clearly / again the son shine
And show them self / so Oryent and shene
On hylle and vale / and on every grene
The rody morrow / till the hot bemys
Of bright Phoebus / with his fyrye stemys
Vapoureth up / their moisture into air
The weder clear / agreeable and fair
And attempre / also of his heete
When the Troyans / cast them for to mete
With their fomen / platly if they may
And out they went / in their best array
With their wards / into field by row
Against whom / greeks were not slow
But shope them forth / Without longer let
Till they togydre / manfully have met
And with their speres / and their swerdes clear
They ran togydre / with a despytous chere
Till shyuered was / a sondre many spear
On sheldes strong / them self for to were
And ryuen was / on pecys many targe
And with hexys / round broad and large
On basenettes / as they smite and shrede
Full many knight / mortally began blede
In sothfastnesse / and as I tell can
The same day / was slain many a man
On outher part / but most of Troy town
Albe Guydo / makes no mencyowne
Of no person / as in special
On nouther side / but in general
Save he concludes / plainly that this fight
Last fro morrow / till that it was night
The which Troyans / have full dear bought
For that day / Fortune help them naught
But turned hole / to their confusyowne
And so they be / repeyred to the town
And to their tents / greeks fast them speed
Till on the morrow / they sent Dyomede
Whith Vlixes / to Troy the cite
For a trewes / oonly for months three
If king Pryam / thereto would assente
And as they two / on this message went
A certain knight / borne of Troy town
That hight Dolon / of great discrecyowne
And also was / right famous of richesse
Of curtely / and of gentyllesse
His deuer did / and his dylygence
Them to conueye / unto the presence
Of Pryamus / in his paleys royal
And in his see / most chief / and pryncypall
Where as he sat / his lords enuyrowne
With many knight / full worthy of renown
They began to him / first to specefye
Hoolly the substance / of their embassatrye
And of the trewes / their intent they told
If it so were / he assente would
And the king / benyngnely them herd
And by auyse / prudently answerde
That thereupon / his honor for to save
At good leyser / he would a counsel have
With his lords / and fully him govern
In this matter / like as they discern
And to conclude / shortly euerychone
Assentyd be / except Ector alone
Unto the trewes / and ne would it not deny
But Ector said / that of trecherye
Oonly of slaughter / and false Treson
Their axynge was / under occason
First to berye Greeks / that were deed
And under color / thereof out of dread
Afterward / them self to vytayle
For he well knew / that their stuf began fail
And enfamyned / lest they should dye
They sought a space / them self to purueye
By outward signs / that he did espy
Wherefore quod he / me lyketh not to lie
By appearance / as I dare presume
Whiles that we / waste and consume
Our stuf within / as it is to dread
They will provide / of what yt they have need
For all that is / to them advantage
Might be to us / hyndrynge and damage
And whiles / they increase and amend
We shall our store / discrease and dispende
Yet nevertheless / how ever that it be
Touching this trewes / as for months three
Sythen ye all / assente and accord
Fro your sentence / I will not discord
In no wise / to be varyaunt
And thus the trewes / confermyd was by grant
On outher side / them thought for the best
Because they should / in quyete and in rest
The mean while / ease them and releue
And they that felt / their wounds sore grieve
Might have leyser / them self to recure
And while the trewes / did thus endure
They fylle in Tretee / and in comunynge
Of Athenor / and Thoas the king
That Anthenor / delivered should be
For king Thoas / to Troy the cite
And so Thoas should / to greeks home again
Oonly by eschaunge / as ye have herd me said
One for a another / as it accorded was
And in this while / ye bishop hight Calchas
Remembered him / upon his daughter dear
Called Cryseyde / with her Eyes clear
Whom in Troy / he had left behind
When he went / as the book makes mind
For whom he felt / passyngly great smerte
So tenderly / she was set at his heart
And enprented / both at eve and morrow
And chief cause / and ground of all his sorrow
Was that she left / behind him in the town
Without comfort / or consolacyowne
As he cast / sothly in his absence
And specially / for his great offense
That he has wrought / against them of troy
And as him thought / he should never have joy
Till he his daughter / recured has again
Wherefore / Calchas / the storye says certain
In his wits / many ways cast
How he might / while the trewes does last
Recure his daughter / by some manner way
And as I find / upon a certain day
In his port / wonder humbly
With weeping eye / went pyteously
In complaining / of terys albe reyned
Whose inward woe / sothly was not feyned
And on his knees / anon he falls down
Tofore / the great king / Agamenowne
Besechynge him / with all humylyte
Of very mercy / and of hye pity
With other kings / sitting in the place
To have routhe / and for to do him grace
And on his woo / to have compassyon
That he may have / restytucyon
Of his daughter / whom he loved so
Prayinge them all / their deuer for to do
That thorugh their prudent / medyacyon
For Anthenor / that was in their prison
With king Thoas / she might eschau^ged be
If that them list / of their benygnyte
To his request / goodly to assente
And they him grant / and forth anon they sent
To king Pryamus / for to have Cryseyde
For Calchas sake / and therewith all they leyde
The charge for her / wonder specially
On them that went / for this Embassatry
To Troy town / and to king Pryamus
To whom Calchas / was so odyus
So hateful eke / thorugh out all the town
That this report / was of him up and down
That he a Traitor / was and also false
Worthy to be / enhonged by the half
For his Treson / and his doubylnesse
And over more / they said eke express
That he disserued has / by right of law
Shamefully / first for to be draw
And afterward / the most horrible death
That he may have / to yield up the breath
Like a Traitor / in as despytous wise
As any heart / can think or deuyse
Eueryche affermynge / as by Judgment
That death was none / fully equypollent
To his deserte / nor to his falsnesse
As young and old / plainly bare witness
Concludynge eke / for his iniquyte
That they would assent / in no degree
Unto no thing / that might his heart please
Nor of Cryseyde / for to do him ease
They cast not / to make delyueraunce
Lever they had / to give him myschaunce
If they him might / have at good large
But finally the effect / of all this charge
Is so ferforth driven / to an end
That Pryamus / has granted she shall wend
With king Thoas / shortly there is no more
Unto her Fader / for dau^z Anthenore
Who ever grutche / the king in Parliament
Has thereupon / given Judgment
So utterly / it may not be repelyd
For with his word / the sentence was asselyd
That she must part / with her eyes glade
And of the sorrow / plainly that she made
At her partynge / hereafter ye shall here
When it again / comes to my matere.
How during a Trewes of three Months Ector walked into the Greeks hooste /
And of ye co^munycacyon of Achylles and him. Ca. xxv.


tHe trewes affermyd / as ye have herd deuyse
On outher side / of them yt were full wise
And full assentyd / of them euerychone
Till three months / come be and gone
Like as I read / on a certain day
When agreeable was / the morrow graye
Blandysshynge / and pleasant of delight
Ector in heart / caught an appetyte
Like as Guydo / lyketh for to write
The same day / Greeks to vysyte
Full well besene / and wonder rychely
With many worthy / in his company
Of such as he / for the nones ches
And to the tent / first of Achylles
I find in sothe / this Troyan knight
Upon his stead / took the way right
Full like a man / as made is mencyon
Now had Achylles / great affection
In his heart / both day and night
Of worthy Ector / for to have a sight
For never his life / by none occasyon
He might of him / have none inspeccyon
Nor him behold / at good lyberte
For unarmed / he might him never se
But wonder knyghtly / as well in port and chere
They had them both / as they met in fere
And right manly / in their countenance
And at the last / they fell in Dalyaunce
But Achylles / first began abreyde
And unto him / even thus he seyde
Ector quod he / full pleasynge is to me
That I at leyser / naked may these
Sith I of the / never might have sight
But when thou were / armed as a knight
And now to me / it shall be full grievous
Which am to the / so inly enuyous
But thou of me / there is no more to said
Be slain anon / with my hands twain
For this in sothe / were hoolly my pleasaunce
By cruel death / to take on the vengeance
For I full often / in werre and eke in fight
Have felt the virtue / and the great might
Of thy force / thorugh many wounds kene
That upon me / be full fresshe and grene
In many place / byshedynge of my blood
Thou wre on me / so furyous and wode
Aye com^assynge / to my destruccyowne
For many^ mayle / of mine haber^owne
Thy shar^e sword / racyd has a sonder
And cruell^ severed / here and yonder
And mortally as / I can signs show
My plates strong / percyd and yhewe
And my ha^eys / forged bright of stele
Might neu^r / assured be so well
In thine Yr^ / when thou list to smite
That thy sw^rde / would kerue and byte
Into my flesh / full deep and full profounde
As shows ye^ / by many mortal wound
On my body large / long and wide
That yet appear / upon every side
And day by day full sore / ache and smerte
For which thing / me seems that my heart
Enbolleth new / now when I these
Of hye despyte / avenged for to be
So am I fret / of enuyous rage
That it may never / in my breast aswage
Till the vengeance / and the fatal suit
Of cruel death / be on the execute
And of one thing / most is my greuaunce
When I have / fully remembrance
And in my mind / consyderyd up and down
How thou made / a dyuysyowne
Of me alas / and of Patroclus
So young so manly / and so virtuous
Whom I loved / as it was skylle and right
Right as my self / with all my full might
With as hole heart / and inly kyndenesse
As an tunge / may tell or express
Now haste thou made / a departysyon
Of us that were / by hole affection
Yknet in one / of hertely allyaunce
Without partynge / or disseueraunce
So entyerly / our faithful hertes twain
Ylaced were / and locked in a chain
Which might not / for none aduersyte
Of life nor death / a sonder twynned be
Till cruelly / thou made us depart
Which through my heart / so i^wardly does darte
That it will never / in soth out of my thought
And trust well / full dear shall be boughte
The death of him / and be no thing in were
Parauenture / or endyd be this year
For upon the / oonly for his sake
Of cruel death / vengeance shall be take
I the ensure / without other bond
If I may live / with mine own hand
I shall of death / do execucyon
Without abode / or long delacyon
For right requires / without any dread
Death for death / for his fynall mede
For I my self / thereon shall be wroke
That thorugh ye world / hereafter shall be spoke
How Achylles / was venged on his foo
For Patroclus / that he loved so
And though that I be / to the enuyous
And of thy death / inly desirous
Ne wit me not / nor put on me no blame
For well I wotte / thou art to me the same
And have my death / many day desired
And thereupon / inwardely conspyred
And thus shortly / as atwene us two
There is but death / without words mo
When Fortune has / the time shape
I hope fully / thou shall not escape
Trust none other / I say the utterly
To whom Ector / not to hastily
Answerde again / with sobre countenance
Auysed well / in all his dalyaunce
As he that was / in nothing rekles
And even thus / he spoke to Achylles
Sir Achylles / without any fail
Thou ought not / in heart to marvel
Though with my power / and my full might
With heart and will / of very dew right
Day by day / I thy death conspyre
And ever in one / compass it and desire
And do my labor / erely and eke late
To pursue it / by full cruel hate
Thou ought not / to wonder in no wise
But fully know / by sentence of the wise
In no manner / who so takes head
Of rightwysnesse / it may not proceed
That outher I / or any other wight
Should him love / that with all his might
My death pursues / and destruccyon
And over this / to more confusyon
Has laid a sege / about this Cite
On my kynred / and also upon me
And thereupon / felly does presume
With mortal hate / of werre to consume
Us euerychone / I wysse I can not find
In my heart / as by law of kind
Such one to love / of right nor equity
Nor have him chere / sothly in no degree
For of werre / may no frendlyhede
Nor of debate / love / a right proceed
For sothly love / most in special
Of faythfulnesse / has his Orygenall
In hertes joined / by conuenyence
Of one accord / whom no difference
Of doubylnesse / may in no degree
Nouther in joy / nor aduersyte
For life nor death / a sondre nor disseuer
For where love is / it contynueth ever.
But of hate / all is the contrary
Of which sothly / from hertes when they varye
Proceeds rancour at eye / as men may se
Debate / envy / strife / and Enmyte
Mortal slaunghtre / both nigh and far
Mother of which / in sothfastnesse is werre
The fyn whereof / long or it be do
Seuereth hertes / and frendeshyp kut a two
And causes love / to be laid full low
But for all this / I will well that thou know
Thy proud words / in heart nor in thought
In very sothe / agaste me right naught
And if I shall / ferther more out break
Without auaunt / the truth for to speak
I say the plainly / hense or two year
If I may live / in this werres here
And my sword of knyghthode / forth acheue
I hope in sothe / so mortally to grene
The greeks all / when I with them mete
That they and thou / shall feel full vnswete
If ye continue / and the werres haunte
I shall your pride / and surquedye adaunte
In such a wise / with my hands two
That or the werre / fully be a do
Full many greek / sore shall it rewe
For well I wot / of old and not of new
That the Greeks / gaderyd here in one
Of surquedye / are found euerychone
Oonly for lack / of discrecyon
To undertake / of presumpcyon
So hye a thing / a sege for to layne
And your self / to over charge in vain
With Empryses / without fable
Be of weight / to you importable
And the peys / of so great heaviness
That finally / will you all oppress
And your pride / auale and enclyne
The berthone eke / enbowe back and chyne
And unawarely / cause you to fall
Or ye have done / I say to one and all
And over more / be full in suerte
Thou Achylles I speak / unto the
That fatal death / first shall the assay^
Tofore thy sword / in any thing auiyle
Against me / for all thy worthynesse
And if so be / that so great hardynese
Courage of will / vygour force or might
Meue thy heart / by manhood as a kiyght
To take on the / as in derrynge do
For to darreyne / here between us two
Thylke quarrel / how so that befalle
For the which / that we strive all
I will assente / plainly to Iupa^te
Till that the death / one of us depart
There is no more / that these lords here
Kings / princes / will accord yfere
That it be do / fully by one assent
And hold stable / of heart and of intent
Which in a field / oonly that we tweyne
As I have said / this quarrel may darreyne
And it fynysshe / by this condycyowne
That if it hap / thorugh thy hye renown
Me to venquysshe / or put at outtraunce
I will you make / fully assurance
That first my lord / Pryamus the king
Shall unto greeks / in all manner thing
With scepter and crown / hoolly him submytte
And in a point / varye nouther flytte
Fully to yield / to your subieccyowne
All his lordshyp / within Troy town
And his lyges / in captyuyte
Shall go their way / out of this cite
And leave it quyte / in your governance
Without strife / or any varyaunce
And thereupon / to make suerte
To deuoyde / all ambygnyte
Tofore the gods / by oath and sacrament
We shall be swore / in full good intent
And over more / our faith also to save
To assure you / in pledge / ye shall have
The mean while / and keep them on your side
At your choice / hostages to abide
From Troy town / of the worthyeste
That ye list chese / and also of the best
So that ye shall / of no thing be in were
Of all that ever / that I say you here
And Achylles / without words mo
If that thou list / accord full thereto
That I have said / thy honor to increase
To make this werre / sodaynely to cease
That lykly is / for to last long
Between Troyans / and the Greeks strong
Thou shall not oonly / with honor and with fame
Thorugh out the world / get the a name
But therewith all / and that is not a lyte
Thorugh thy knyghthod / to many man profit
That fro the death / shall escape a live
And to his country / hole and sound aryue
That lykly are / by cruel adventure
For to be deed / if the werre endure
Come of therefore / and let not be prolongued
But let the day / at wene us two be joined
As I have said / in condycyowne
If in diffence / oonly of this town
I have victory / by fortune on the
I axe not / but anon that ye
Break up sege / and the werre let
And suffer us / to live in quyete
Into Greece / home when ye are gone
To which thing / Achylles anon
Hot in his Ire / and furyous also
Brennynge full hot / for anger and for woe
Assentydis / with a despytous chere
And began anon / to Ector dress him nere
And said he would / deliver him utterly
Fro point to point / his axynge by and by
And there in made / none excepcyon
But of hole heart / and entencyon
His request / accepted euerydell
And as it seemed / lyked it right well
And for his part / he cast a glove down
In sign and token / of confirmacyowne
For life or death / that he will hold his day
Again Ector / hap / what hap may
Unto the which / Ector lyfly sterte
And took it up / with as glad an heart
As ever yet did / man or knight
That quarrel took / with his foo to fight
There can no man / in sothe a right deuyse
How gald he was / of this hye Empryse.
Of which the noise / and the great sown
Ran to the Erys / of Agamenowne
And he anon / came down to their tent
With all the lords / of his Parlyament
Where Achylles and Ector / were yfere
To wit their will / as in this matere
Were they would / assente finally
To put the quarrel / full in Iupardy
Of outher part / atwene these knights tweyne
As ye have herd / it fully to dareyne
And with one voice / greeks it deny
And said they ne would / of such a company
Of kings / dukes / and lords eke also
Both life and death / Iuparte atwene two
Nor to the course / of Fortune them submytte
That can her face / all day change and flytte
And some of Troy / in conclusyowne
Iuparte ne would / their lives nor their town
In the hands / oonly of a knight
To put all / in adventure of fight
Pryam except / which sothly in this caas
Within him self / fully assentyd was
Plainly to a put / and set in Iupardye
Hoolly the honor / of his regallye
Supposing aye / as made is memory
That Ector should / have had the victory
Of this Empryse / if he it took on hand
But for Pryam / might natwithstonde
Again so many / of one entencyon
That were contrary / to his oppynyon
Both of Greeks / and on Troy side
He held his peace / and let it over slide
And so the Greeks / parted be echone
And Ector / is from Achylles gone
Home to Troy / where I him leave a while
Whiles that I / direct shall my style
To tell of Troylus / the lamentable woe
Which that he made / to part his lady fro.
ALas Fortune / Gery and unstable
And ready aye / for to be chaungeable
Wha^ folk most trust / i^ thy stormy face
Like their desire / ye fully to embrace
Than is thy joy / away to turn and wrythe
Upon wretches / thy power for to kythe
Record on Troylus / yt fro the whele so low
By false envy / thou have over throw
Out of the joy / which that he was Inn
From his lady / to make him for to twynne
When he best wend / for to have be suryd
And of the woo / that he has enduryd
I must now / help him to complain
Which as his heart / felt so great pain
So inward woe / and so great distress
More than I have / cunning to express
When he knew / the partynge of Cryseyde
Almost for woo / and for pain / he deyde
And fully wyste / she depart shall
By sentence / and Judgment fynall
Of his fader / given in Parlyament
For which / with woe and tourment all to rent
He was in point / to have fallen in rage
That no man might / a pease nor a swage
The hyd pains / which in his breast began dare
For like a man / in furye / he began fare
And such sorrow / day and night to make
In complaining / oonly for her sake
For when he saw / that she should aweye
He lever had / plainly for to deye
Than to live behind / in her absence
For him thought / without her presence
He was but deed / there is no more to said
And intoterys / he began to rain
With which his eyes / began for to bolie
And in his breast / the syghes up to swolle
And the sobbing / of his sorrows deep
That he ne can / but rore and weep
So sore love / his heart began constrayne
And she ne felt / not a little pain
But wept also / and pyteously began cry
Desiring aye / that she might dye
Rather than part fro him out of Troy
Her own knight / her lust her lives joy
That by her chekes / the terys down distylle
And fro her eyes / the round drops trylle
And all for dewed / have her black wede
And eke untrussed / her here a brodegan sprede
Like to gold wyre / for rent and all to torn
Yplucked of / and not with sherys shorn
And over this / her fresshe rosen hew
Whylom ymeynt / with white lylyes new
With woeful weeping / pyteously disteyned
And like Erbys / in Apryll all be reyned
Or flowers fresshe / with the dewes sweet
Right so her chekes / moist were and wete
With crystal water / up ascendynge hye
Out of her breast / into her heavenly eye
And aye among / her lamentaeyowne
Often sithe / she fill in a swowne down
Dedely pale / for dymmed in her sight
And often said / alas mine own knight
Mine own Troylous / alas why shall we perte
Rather let death / with his spear darte
Thorugh my heart / and the veins kerue
And with his rage / do me for to strive
Rather alas / than fro my knight to twynne
And of this woe / O death that I am inn
Why ne wylt thou come / and help make an end
For how should I out of Troy wend
He abide / and I to greeks goon
There to dwell / among my cruel foon
Alas alas / I woeful creature
How should I there / in the werre endure
I wretched woman / but my self alone
Among the men / of arms euerychone
Thus began she cry / all the long day
This was her complaynte / with full great afray
Her pyteous noise / till it drew to night
That unto her / her own true knight
Full tryste and heavy / came agaynes eve
If he might / her comfort or leave
But he in sothe / has Cryseyde found
All in a swowne / lyinge on the ground
And pyteously / unto her he went
With woeful chere / and her in arms hent
And took her up / and than atwene them two
Began of new / such a dedely woe
That it was routhe / and pity for to seen
For she of chere / pale was and grene
And he of color / like to ashes deed
And fro her face / was gone all the read
And in his chekes / deuoyded was the blood
So woefully / atwene them two it stood
For she ne might / not a word Yspeke
And he was ready / with death to be wreke
Upon him self / his naked sword beside
And she full often / began to ground glyde
Out of his arms / as she fylle a swowne
And he him self / began in terys drown
She was as stylle / and dumb as any stone
He had a mouth / but words had he none
The weary spyryte / flyckered in her breast
And of death / stood under a rest
Without menprys / sothely as of life
And thus there was / as it seemed a strife
Which of them two / should first ypasse
For death portrayed / in heart outher face
With such color / as men go to their grave
And thus in woe / they began togydre rave
Disconsolate / all the long night
That in good faith / if I should a right
The process hole / of their both sorrow
That they made / till the next morrow
Fro point to point / it to specefye
It would me / full long occupye
Of every thing / to make mencyon
And tarry me / in my translacyon
If I should / in her woe proceed
But me seems / that it is no need
Sith my master / Chaucer here before
In this matter / has so well him bore
In his book / of Troylus and Cryseyde
Which he made / long or that he deyde
Rehersynge first / how Troylus was contrayre
For to ascend / up on loves stayre
And how that he / for all his surquedye
After became / one of the company
Of loves folk / for all his old game
When Cupyde / made him full tame
And brought him low / to his subieccyowne
In a temple / as he walked up and down
When he his gynnes / and his hooks leyde
Amyd the Eyes / cerclyd of Cryseyde
Which on that day / he might not asterte
For thorugh his breast / percyd and his heart
He went him home / pale syke / and wan
And in this wise / Troylus first began
To be a servant / my master tells thus
Till he was help / after of Pandarus
Thorugh whose comfort / and medyacyon
As in his book / is made mencyon
With great labor / first he came to grace
And so contynueth / by certain years space
Till fortune began / upon him frown
That she fro him / must go out of town
All sodaynely / and never him after se
Lo here the end / of false Felycyte
Lo here the end / of wordely brotylnesse
Of flesshely lust / lo here the unstableness
Lo here the double / varyacyon
Of worldly bliss / and transmutacyon
This day in myrthe / and in woe to morrow
For aye the fine / alas of joy is sorrow
For now Cryseyde / with the king Thoas
For Anthenor / shall go forth alas
Unto Greeks / and ever with them dwell
The hole storye / Chau^cer can you tell
If that ye list / no man better a live
Nor the process / half so well descryue
For he our english / gylte with his says
Rude and boystous / first by old days
That was full fer / from all parfeccyon
And but of little / reputacyon
Till that he came / and thorugh his poetrye
Began our tunge / first to magnefye
And adourne it / with his eloquence
To whom honor / laud and reverence
Thorugh out this land / given be and song
So that the laurer / of our english tongue
Be to him given / for his excellence
Right as whylom / by full hye sentence
Perpetuelly / for a memoryall
Of Columpna / by the Cardynall
To Petrark Fraunceyse / was given in Ytayle
That the report / never after fail
Nor the honor / dyrked of his name
To be regystred / in the house of fame
Among other / in the highest sete
My master Galfryde / as for chief Poet
That ever was / yet in our langage
The name of whom / shall pallen in none age
But ever ylyche / without eclypsynge shine
And for my part / I will never fine
So as I can / him to magnefye
In my writing / plainly till I dye
And god I pray / his soul bring in joy
And where I left / I will again of troy
The storye tell / and first how that Guydo
Within his book / speaks Troylus to
Rebukynge him / full vncurteysly
That he so set / his heart folyly
Upon Cryseyde / full of doubylnesse
For in his book / as Guydolyste express
That her terys / and her complaining
Her words white / soft and blandysshynge
Were meynt with faynynge / and with flaterye
And outward farsed / with many a false lie
For vnderhyd was / all the varyaunce
Curyd above / with feigned countenance
As women can / falsely terys borowe
In their heart / though there be no sorrow
Like as they would / of very truth deye
They can think on / and a another seye
As a serpent / under flowers fair
His venym hydeth / where he does repair
The sugre before / the galle hid behind
As appropryd is / unto their kind
To be diverse / and double of nature
Rathest deceyuynge / when men most assure
For under color / every thing they work
The fair above / the foul in the derke
They hid so / that no man may espy
And though so be / that with a woeful Eye
They can outward / weep pyteously
The the other eye / can laffe covertly
Whose sorrows all / are tempryd with allies
And their color / ever is meynt with rays
For upon change / and mutabylyte
Stand hole their trust / and their suerte
So that they be / sure in doubylnesse
And always double / in their sykernesse
Semynge one / when they best can varye
Lykest to a cord / when they be contrary
And thus they be / varyaunt in accord
And holest seem / when there is discord
And Guydo says / how there are few or none
That in her heart / apayed is with one
And yet they can / be it to one or twain
To three or four / in their speech feign
Like as they were / to one and to no mo
Hole in their love / for well and eke for woe
That eueryche shall / of him self deem
That he be next / like as it does seem
And thus in hope / stands each of them all
The trewest aye / redyest to fall
Who serves best / next to be apayred
And thus in change / all their love is fayred
Let no man trust / but catch when he may
Farewell to morrow / though it be sure to day
The fair of change / lasts over year
But it is folly / for to bye to dear
Thylke treasoure / which hard is to possede
But flies away / when men thereof mostenede
And if it hap / that no chapman be
As says Guydo / yet all day men may se
It shows out / at large fenestralles
On chaumbres / hye and low down in halles
And in wyndowes / eke in every street
And also eke / men may with them mete
At Pylgrymages / and oblacyownes
At spectacles / in Cytes and in towns
As says Guydo / and all is for to selle
But after him / I can no ferther tell
And eke he says / in his sentement
There is no fraud / fully equypolent
To the fraud / and sleyghty compassynge
Of a woman / nor like in workynge
For who that set / all his faythfulnesse
Wenynge in them / to find stabylnesse
He shall them find / steadfast as the moon
That is in point / for to change soon
If he be young / they cast him in rage
If he be old / he falls in dotage
Wherefore my counsel is / to both two
Cast of the brydell / and lightly let them go.
This techeth Guydo / god wot and not I
That has delight / to speak cursedly
Always of women / thorugh out all his book
As men may se / who so list to look
To them he had / envy in special
That in good faith / I am right wroth with all
That he with them / list so to debate
For Ire of which / the Latin to translate
Inwardely / my heart / I felt blede
Of hye despyte / his clauses for to read
That resowned / in conclusyon
Oonly of malys / to accusacyowne
Of these women / full evil mote he thryue
So generally / their sect / to descryue
Which made not / thorugh in discrecyon
Of good / nor badde / none excepcyon
He was to blame / foul mote he fall
For cause of one / for to hinder all
For I dare well / afferme by the rode
Again one badde / be an hundred good
And though some one / bouble be and new
It hyndreth not / to them that be true
And by example / also though he show
That some one / whylom was a shrewe
They that be good / take shall no head
For it / no hyndrynge / is to womanhede
Though twain or three / can be double and feign
For there again / lothely at Colayne
Of virgyns / inly full of grace
A leven thousand / in that holy place
A man may find / and in our calendar
Full many maid / parfyte and Enter
Which to the death / stable were and true
For some of them / with the rosen hew
Of Marterdome / the bliss of heaven won
And some also / as books tell konne
With the lylye / of virgynyte
And vyolettes / of parfyte chastyte
Ascended be / above the sterrys clear
And the sercle / of the nynthe spear
Wherefore joy is ever / and gladness eterne
Wherefore in sothe / as I can discern
Though some clerks / of shrewes have myssayde
Let no good woman / thereof be myspayde
For lack of one / all are not to blame
And eke of men / may be said the same
For to the true / it is no reprefe
Though it so be / a another be a thief
For what is he / the worse in his degree
Though the the other / be hanged on a tree
Nor unto women / hyndrynge is it none
Among an hundred / though that there be one
Of governance / that be vycyous
For there again / a thousand virtuous
If that ye list / lyghtely ye may find
And though Guydo write / they have of ky^de
To be double / men should it goodly take
And there again / no manner grutchyng make
Nature in werkynge / has full great powere
And it were hard / for any that is here
The course of her / to hold or restreyne
For she will not be gyded / by no reyne
To be coarted / of her dew right
Therefore each man / with all his full might
Should thank god / and take pacyently
For if women / be double naturelly
Why should men / ley on them the blame
For though mine Auctor / hyndre so their name
In his writing / oonly of Cryseyde
And upon her / such a blame leyde
My counsel is / lightly over pass
Where he myssayth / of her in any place
To hyndre women / outher eve or morrow
Take no head / but let them be with sorrow
And skyppe over / where ye list not read
Till ye come / where that Dyomede
For her was sent / into Troy town
Where ceryously / is made mencyowne
First how that she / to him delivered was
For Anthenor / and for the king Thoas
And how Troylus / began her to conueye
With many other / to bring her on the weye
And after this / how that Dyomede
By the way / began her brydell led
Till he her brought / to her faders tent
And how Calchas / in fall good intent
Received her / lodgyd there he lay
And of her speech / during all that day
And all the manner / hole and euerydele
All is rehearsed / ceryously and well
In Troylus book / as ye have herd me said
To write it often / I hold it were but vain
But Guydo says / long or it was night
How Cryseyde / forsook her own knight
And gave her heart / unto Dyomede
Of tenderness / and of womanhede
That Troylus / wexe in her heart as cold
Without fire / as ben these asshys old
I can none other / excusacyon
But oonly / kinds transmutacyon
That is appropryd / unto her nature
Selde or never / stable to endure
By experyence / as men may often lere
But now again / to my matere
I must resort / though that I be far
As I began / to write of the werre.
How when ye trewes was endyd they went to battle again / where as were many
a man slain on both parties / And of ye Discrypcyon of ye Palace of Ylyon /
And also how there dyed so many greeks of the pestylence / that they demanded
trewes for.xxx. days which they obtained. Capitulo. xxvi.
THe time passed / of the trewes Ytake
the next morrow / wha^ tyta^ has forsake
The under party / of our Emysperye
Where all y night / he had be full merye
With Aurora / lyinge by his side
But in his bed / him list no longer bide
But shope him up / and cast his stremes shene
On Troy wall / when Ector armed clean
Into the field / fast began him hye
Fyftene thousand / in his company
Of worthy knights / and of manly men
And as I find / Troylus had ten
Of knights eke / that his baner sewe
And in have / Paris began remewe
Out of the town / with them of Perce long
And each of them / a bow in his hand
And arrows sharp / trussed by their side
And of knights / that about him ride
He had also / three thousand as I find
And Dephebus / next him came behind
With three thousand / knights armed clean
On whose plates / the son shone full shene
And next him came / the Troyan Eneas
And as I read / sothly that there was
The Same day / with them of Troy town
An hundred thousand / knights of renown
Like as records / Dares Frygius
And in his book / Guydo writes thus
And with the Greeks / all tofore that day
With seven thousand / went Menelay
Knights echone / which he did led
And with as many / went Dyomede
And next them / follows the hardy Achylles
With his main / called Myrundynes
And zanptipu^ / the worthy king eke had
Three thousand knights / which that he ladde
Into the field / again them of the town
And alderlaste / came Agamenowne
With such a nombre / of the Greeks fell
That wonder is / for to here tell
And when the wards / in the field abroad
Had their place / without more abode
Agrekysshe king / which yt Phyllys hyghte
Anon as he of Ector / had a syghte
Toward him / sitting on his stead
With his spear / he began him fast speed
But when Ector / his coming said
He hente a spear / and rode to him again
And thorugh his shield / and his plates round
He gave to him / his last fat all wound
Upon whose death / avenged for to be
Full many Greek / began on Ector for to flee
And first of all / the worthy king Famous
That of Greeks / was called zantipus
Of hye disdain / oonly for Phyllys sake
Toward Ector / has his course ytake
And with a spear / ran at him full right
But Ector first / hit him with such a might
Thorugh his harneys / with his speres head
That zantipus / fylle to ground deed
The death of whom / Greek sore plain
And did their might / and their besy pain
On every half / furyous and wode
To avenge them / on Troyans blood
And thorugh he passing / cruel hardynesse
They began Troyans / so to oppress
That many one / that day ne might asterte
Thoruh the breast / yperced and the heart
For to be deed / and slain among the prees
Among which / cruel Achylles
Slew Lychaon / and Eufrobyus
Noble knights / right worthy and famous
That were ycome / out of their country
Again Greeks / to help the Cite
And while troyans / constrained were so narowe
Were it with spear / quarrel / darte / or arowe
Ector was wounded / thorugh out the vyser
Into the face / that like a river
The reed blood / down began to rail
But his harneys / thorugh his auentayle
Whereof astoned / when they had a sight
Full many Troyan / took him to the flight
And to the Cite / fast began them draw
And at the chase / full many one was slawe
Or they might / out of the field remewe
And ever in one / greeks after sewe
Unto the walls / almost of the town
Till that Ector / the troyan champyowne
Of his knight hode / began to take heed
Albe his wound / sore began to blede
Yet of manhood / he began them recomforte
And maugre them / into the field resort
Namely when he / had inspeccyowne
On the walls / and toures of the town
How that Eleyne / and Eccuba the queen
And his suster / fair Polycene
With many other lady / began behold
Him thought anon / his heart began to cold
Of very shame / his knights should fle
And like a Lion / in his cruelte
He made them turn / manly euerychone
And in his way / he met Meryon
Agrekysshe king / that was nigh allye
To Achylles / as books specefye
And with his sword / Ector smote him so
That he him rofe / on pecys two
And when Achylles / saw him deed
Parted a two / even fro the head
He hent a spear / and thought he ne would fail
Tohyt Ector / thorugh shield plate and mayle
And rode to him / full Enuyously
And amyd the shield / he smet him cruelly
But with the stroke / Ector never adell
Remeueth not / he sat so fast and well
But with his sword anon / and taryeth naught
Ran to Achylles / with an enuyous thought
He knyghtly ran / upon his coursere
And on his creste / that shone so bright and clear
With such a might / Ector has him smet
That he percyd / thorughe his basenet
And racede eke / from his auentayle
With that stroke / many piece of mayle
That Achylles / constrained was of need
Maugre his might / to stagre on his stead
To enclyne / and to bow his back
At which time / Ector to him spoke.
And said Achylles / I do well aduerte
The great envy / of thy cruel heart
And specially / that thou haste to me
But yet beware / I counsel the
Thy self to put / so in adventure
For of one thing / I plainly the ensure
As I desire / at my last some day
Here in the field / if I the mete may
Trust me right well / there gayneth no socour
That I shall so / acquyte thy labor
So mortally / I do the understand
With this sword / that I hold in hand
That with thy life / thou shall not escape
So cruelly / the vengeance shall be take
Efte when we met / even upon thy head
Of which thing / when Achylles took head
Aduertynge all / that he herd him said
Right as he would / have answer again
Worthy Troylus / knyghtly entrede inn
And made them / a sondre for to twynne
And thorugh the manhood / of his company
Of worthy knights / that he did guye
And hye prowess / of his own might
He has the greeks / put again to flight
And slain of them / that day out of dread
Six hundred knights / sothely as I read
For loss of which / the Greeks fast fle
To their tents / of necessyte
Till Menelay / did his besy cure
To make them / the field again recure
Thorugh whose manhood / yt day out of doubt
And worthy knights / that were him about
The field of greeks / recured was anon
But tho fro Troy / came king Odemon
And in all haste / possible / that he may
He came enbusshed / upon Menelay
And him vnhorseth / in the self place
And such a wound / gave him in the face
That fro the death / he wend not escape
And doutles anon / he had him take
With help of Troylus / and lad unto ye town
But of Greeks / such a prese came down
To reskewe him / in this great need
That Odemon / no ferther might led
King Menelay / toward the Cite
When Dyomede / came with his meyne
And many worthy / riding him about
And Troylus met / among all the route
All sodaynely / of hap or adventure
And him vnhorseth / as it was his eure
And after that / anon he hent his stead
And bad a squire / that he should it led
Unto Cryseyde / oonly for his sake
Besechynge her / that she would it take
As for a gift / of her own man
Sith he that day / for her love it wan
Amyd the field / thorugh his great might
Of him that was / whylom her own knight
And he in haste / on his way is went
And thereof made / unto her present
Prayinge her / in full humble wise
This little gift / that she not despise
But it receive / for a remembrance
And with all this / that it be pleasaunce
Of very pity / and of womanhede
On her servant / called Dyomede
To remember / that was be come her knight
And she anon / with heart glad and light
Full womanly / bad him repair again
Unto his lord / and plainly to him said
That shene might / of very kyndenesse
Of womanhede / nor of gentyllesse
Refuse him platly / from her grace
That was to her / there in strange place
So kind found / and so comfortable
In every thing / and so seruyable
That it may not / lightly out of mind
To think on him / that was so true and kind.
With which answer / the messager is gone
Unto his lord / and told it him anon
Word by word / like as she has said
And he thereof / was full well apayde
That him thought / plainly in his heart
He was recured / of his pains smerte
And forth he had him / in arms as a knight
But that day / during the strong fight
They of Troy / so manly have them borne
That greeks might / not stand them aforne
For to their tents / they have the^ chased down
That ne had be / king Agamenowne
Greeks had / be driven out of the field
The which thing / anon as he beheld
He came upon / with many worthy man
And tho of new / the slaughtre again began
On every half / upon the large plain
That Greeks / have Troyans so be layne
That efte again / they have the field ywonne
So that Troyans / constrained tho begone
To lose their land / till Pollydamas
Which with his knights / there beside was
Began fall upon / endelonge the grene
Them of Troy / full manly to sustene
And the Greeks / he began so to enchace
When he came in / that they lost their place
And to the stronde / even upon the sea
Through his knyghthod / he made the^ for to fle
Of their life / that they were in dread
The which myschefe / when that Dyomede
Beheld / and saw / how Pollydamas
Mortally / pursued on the chas
On horse back / in the field a fere
With cruel heart / hent anon a spear
And spryngynge out / rode to him full right
And he again / to acquyte him like a knight
As he that list / on no party feyne
Of his stead / held again the reyne
And raughte a spear / and threw it in the rest
And Dyomede / he smote so on the breast
That mortally / like as it is found
He unhorsed him / with a grievous wound
And right anon / with a knyghtly heart
Pollydamas / all attones sterte
Unto the horse / of this Dyomede
And by the reyne / proudely began it led
Unto Troylus / where he on foot stood
All for bathed / in the Greeks blood
On every half / which that he shadde
Among them / so knyghtly he him had
That they ne might / endure nor sustene
His sharp sword / ground was so kene
And delyuerly / maugre all his foon
Into the sadell / up he sterte anoon
Of very force / armed as he was
And unawarely / by adventure or cas
With sharp swerdes / for the nones whette
As Achylles / and he togydre met
Worthy Troylus / of rancour and of pride
Achylles smote / that he fell aside
Down of his horse / low to the ground
And natwtstandynge / his grene mortal wound
He rose again / and fast began him speed
If that he might / to recure his stead
But all for naught / it would not avail
For sodaynely / with a fresshe battle
They of Troy / as made is mencyon
In compass wise / beset him enuyron
Eueryche of them / armed bright and clean
And Ector tho / in his furyous tene
As Dares tells / all the manner how
The same day / a thousand knights slow
Which them withstode / oonly in diffence
For Achylles / to make resystence
That time of death / stondynge in Iupardye
That certaynely / but if books lie
By lyklyhede / he might not escape
In that myschefe / to be deed or take
Ector on him / was so furyous
But as I read / Thelamonyus
Reskued him / in this great need
And caused him / to recure his stead
Natwithstandynge / all the great prees
For the Duke / and lord of Athenes
Was in this case / of heart and hole intent
To help Achylles / wonder dylygent
That with him ladde / many noble knight
But for because / that it drew to night
As the storye / makes rehersayle
They made an end / as of that battle
And they of Troy / entered be the town
And after that / as made is mencyowne
By and by / having delays
Mortally they fought / thurty days
Without / any interrupcyon
On outher part / to great destruccyon
But aldermost / for all their great pride
They lost most / on the Greeks side
Save Pryamus / lost in special
Six of his sons / called natural
For whom he had / full great heaviness
And as the storye / lyketh to express
This mean while / Ector in certain
In his face / wounded was again
And thus they have / in this cruel rage
On every part / received great damage
Till king Pryam / from Troy sent down
For a trewes / unto Agamenowne
For six months / if he assente would
And thereupon / he has a counsel hold
With his lords / what were best to do
And they echone / accorded be thereto
And grant his axynge / in conclusyon
And all this while / within ylyon
During the peace / on outher part assured
Of his wounds / fully to be cured.
Lay worthy Ector / protector of the town
But of this rich / royal chief doungeowne
That Ylyon / in Troy bare the name
Which of byldynge / had such a fame
If that I should / commend it up so down
As Dares does / in his descripcyowne
I want cunning / my termys to aplye
For in his book / as he does specefye
In all this wrolde / was there none so rich
Of hye deuyse / nor of byldynge lyche
The which stood / the more to delight
As he records / on twelve stones white
Of Alabastre / shortly to conclude
And twenty pase / was the latytude
That ground ypaued / thorugh out with crystal
And up on hyghte / parformed every wall
Of all stones / that any man can find
Of Dyamountes / and sapphires ynde
The royal rubye / so oryent and light
That the derkenesse / of the dymme night
Enchaced was / with his bemes shene
And ever among / were emeraudes grene
With stones all / that any manner man
In this world / deuyse or reken can
That were of pryse / value or richesse
There were wrought / of large and great rou^denesse
As says Dares / Yuory pyllers
And thereupon / set at the corners
Of pured gold / all above on hyghte
There were images / wonder huge of weyghte
With many perle / and many rich stone
And every pyller / in the halle had one
Of massyfe gold / borned clear and bright
And wonderful / to any man's sight
For of this work / the meruaylous fasyon
Was more like / by estymacyon
A thing ymade / and founded by fayrye
Than any work / wrought by fantasye
Thorugh wit of man / as by lyklynesse
For in his book / Dares bears witness
That it was like / to reken sight and all
In apparaunce / a thing celestyall
Sith in this book / ye get no more of me
For but in writing / I might never it se
Albe all other / that it did excelle
No more thereof / I think now to tell
But return again / to Pryamus
Which all this while / was inly coryous
With all his might / and his besy cure
To ordain / for the sepulture
Of his sons / that before were deed
And all that time / syke lay Dyomede
With loves darte / wounded to the heart
As he that felt / inwardly smerte
Of woeful syghes / which in his breast abreyde
Full often a day / for love of Cryseyde
For he was shake / with a fever new
That caused him / to be full pale of hew
And to wexe / both megre and lene
For pyteously / he began him to abstene
Fro mete and drink / and from all solace
As it was seen / in his dedely face
And often a day / to her he would plain
Of his dissease / and his mortal pain
Prayinge of grace / that she would se
Upon his woo / for to have pity
And of mercy / for to take heed
Of her servant / oonly of womanhede
Or planely else / there is no more to seye
For her sake / he said he would deye.
But cunnyngly / and in full sleyghty wise
To keep him low / under her seruyse
With delays / she held him forth on hand
And made him / in a weer to stand
Full unsure / between hope and despair
And when that grace / should have had repair
To put him out / of all heaviness
Danger of new / brought him in distress
And with a disdain / to increase his pain
Of double weer / she brought hy^ in a train
As women can hold / a man full narowe
When he is hurt / with Cupydes arowe
To set on him / many fell assayes
Day by day / to put him in delays
To stand unsure / betwyxe hope and dread
Right as Cryseyde / left Dyomede
Of intent to set / him more a fire
As this women / kyndely desire
When they a man / have brought in a trance
Unevenly / to hang him in balaunce
Of hope and dread / to lynke him in a chain
And of the fine / unsure of both twain
To drive him forth / years them to serve
And do no force / where he live or sterue
This is the fine / of loves fyry rage
And for she would / have him inseruage
She locked him / under such a keye
That he wot not / where to live or deye
And in doubt thus / I let him dwell
And forth I will / of the storye tell
And to my matere / eke resort again
And as mine Auctour / records in certain
After the trewes / were wered out and gone
Twelve days / suynge all in one
The greeks faught / with them of the town
To great damage / and confusyowne
Of outher party / and aduersyte
And in this while / a great mortalyte
Both of sword / and of pestylence
Among greeks / by fatal influence
Of noyous hete / and of corrupt air
Engendryd was / that in great dispeyre
Of their life / in the field they leye
For day by day / sodaynely they deye
And their nombre / fast began discrece
And when they saw / that it ne would sece
By their advise / the king Agamenowne
For a trewes / sent to the town
For thurty days / and Pryamus the king
Without more / granted his axynge.
How Andronomecha Ectors wife had a vysyon in her sleep / that and her
housbonde fought on the morrow that he should be slain / the which would not
believe her / nouther Fader nor mother / And how Achylles slew him. Ca. xxvij.
When the moreyne / and the woeful rage
Of Pestylence / began for to aswage
And the trewes / were wered out and goon
The greeks cast / to mete with their foon
Upon a day / in plates armed clean
When Phoebus rose / with his bemys shene
Full plesauntly / and began to shede his light
But as I find / tofore the self night
Andronomecha / the faithful true wife
Of worthy Ector / him loving as her life
By whom he had / get children two
Wonder semely / and inly fair also
And Lamedoute / called was the tone
So young the the other / that it ne might gone
And Astronanta / I read that he hyghte
Fetured well / and passing fair of syghte
And as Guydo / lysteth to endyte
Of his mother / at the pappes white
For very young / that time was soukynge
And with his arm / her brestys embrasynge
And she that night / as made is mencyon
Had in her sleep / a wonder vysyon
I note in sothe what / I may it neuene
Outher a dreme / or verily a sweuene
Or fro above / a reuelacyon
As whylom had / the king Scipyon
Or a showing / outher an Oracle
Or of gods / a warning by miracle
For in sothenesse / slepynge as she lay
Her thought plainly / if the next day.
Ector went / his fomen for to assail
As he was wont / armed in battle
That hene should / escape utterly
In fatys hondes / to fall finally
And over more / Antropos shall fine
For evermore / his lives threde to twyne
And show the force / of her fell might
When the Parodye / of this worthy knight
A proche shall / without words mo
Into the field / plainly if he go
Of which astonyd / straight and short of breath
Where as she lay / abrayde up on the death
And with a syghe / stynte for to sleep
And pyteously / braste out for to weep
For the constraynte / of her hertely sorrow
And specially / on the woeful morrow
When that she saw / this stock of worthynesse
As he was wont / manfully him dress
To arm him / in steel borned bright
This troyan wall / Ector this worthy knight
She can no more / but at his fete fell down
Lowly declarynge / her a vysyowne
With quakynge heart / of very womanhede
Whereof god wot / he took little head
But thereof had / indygnacyon
Platly affermynge / that no discrecyon
Was to trust / in such fantasyes
In dremes showed / gladly meynt with lies
Full of Iapes / and illusyons
Of which plainly / the conclusyons
Benat else / but folks to delude
Albe it so / that these people rude
Therein some while / have affection
To judge and deem / in their oppynyon
Dyuersly / what they may pretend
And often fall / and happen as they wend
And follows like / in conclusyon
For dread of which / the Lamentacyon
Increase began / of Andronomecha
And in her swowne / first she cried A
Saying alas / mine own lord so dear
Your true wife / alas why ne will ye here
Which of so faithful / hoole affection
Desires aye / your sauacyon
And up she rose / dedely of vysage
And like a woman / caught with sudden rage
To king Pryam / and Eccuba / the queen
In haste she went / her self to be mean
And of her wifely heart / true as stele
Ceryously / declared every dele
Her pyteous dreme / which thorugh miracle
To her oonly / by deuyne oracle
I showed was / thorugh gods purueaunce
And told them eke / the fynall ordinance
Of Fortunes false / disposycyon
Fully purueyed / to destruccyon
Of her lord / without more delay
Into the field / if he go that day
Wherefore she prays / with a dedely hew
Unto the king / of meccy for to rewe
Upon her woe / to have compassyon
For to ordain / by discrecyon
Of his lordshyp / and of soueraynte
That her lord / not destroyed be
Of reckeleshede / nor of wylfulnesse
And with that word / of very kyndenesse
In whom was aye / somoche love found
Tofore the queen / in a swowne fell to ground
And said alas / with a full pale chere
Help in this case / mine own mother dear
Of womanhede and routhe / do me grace
That my lord / into the field ne pace
And do your deuer / of moderly pity
Benyngnely / and goodly for to se
To his knyghthode / and his hye prowess
For to restrain / his renowned noblesse
Thylke day / to handle / spear / or shield
Nor that he go / armed into field
And both twain / assent for the best
And condescende / unto her request
Finally according / into one
That when the wards / were ready euerychone
On yssuynge out / and Troylus first of all
And Paris next / on greeks for to fall
And after him / the Troyan Eneas
King Sarpedon / and Pollydamas
King Eroys / and king Epystrophus
And eke the king / ycalled Forcyus
In plate and mayle / eueryche armed clean
And alderlaste / came king Phylymene
With all the kings / and lords of renown
That in diffence / come of the town
With the greeks / knyghtly to debate
And Pryamus / sothly to the gate
Conveyed them / at their out going
And set their wards / this noble worthy king
Full prudently / thoruhe his sapyence
And after gave them / congee and license
Upon Greek / for to prove their might
Against whom / full ready for to fight
Their fomen were / with royal apparayle
Amyd the field / abiding the battle
But Pryamus / in this mean while
Like as Guydo / remembers in his style
For thylke fine / that ye have herd me said
To worthy Ector / repaired is again
Him contermau^dynge / that he ne should gone
Thylke day to fight / again their foon
For which thing / of hye despyte he brent
When that he saw / other lords went
Out at the gate / and he alone abode
For which he wexed / furyous and wode
Hoolly the cause / arettynge to his wife
That was of cherte / so tender of his life
Putting on his / fully the occasyowne
Of his abiding / that day in the town
In preiudyce / of her worthynesse
And disencrease / of his hye prowess
And lift thorugh tunges / to his hye estate
Thorugh false report / it were derogate
He cast anon / of a full knyghtly heart
For life nor death / it should him not asterte
Within the field / that day to be found
Though it so were / with many mortal wound
He should on pecys / he wen be a sondre
Upon the plain / dismembryd here and yondre
So hole in manhood / was his heart set
That he anon / without longer let
Again to arm him / was full dylygent
Again the precept / and commandment
Of his Fader / and rode forth on his weye
For fere of which / as she would deye
His wife of new / cry began and shoute
And with her pappes / also hanging out
Her little child / in her arms twain
Before her lord / began to weep and plain
Besechynge him / of routhe and pity
If he would / unto her sorowese
At the least / for her wifely truth
That he of manhood / have in heart routhe
Upon her child / and on her also
Which that she bare / in her arms two
And not might / him from cryinge keep
When he saw / his woeful mother weep
And knelynge down / unto him she said
In her sobbing / as she might abrayde
Mine own lord / have mercy now on me
And on this little child / which that ye se
So pyteously / before you weep and cry
Have mercy lord on us / or we dye
Have mercy eke / upon this cite
Mine own lord / have mercy or that we
By cruel death / pass shall echone
For lack of help / alas when ye are gone
This was the cry / of Andromecha
With whom was eke / her suster Cassandra
Eccuba / and fair Polycene
And Eleyne / the lusty fresshe queen
Which all attones / fell him beforne
With here vntressyd / and weeping all to torn
And loud began to cry / in the place
Besechynge him / of mercy and of grace
For thylke day / to abide in the town
And in his heart / to have compassyowne
On her complaynte / and her woeful moan
Sith all the trust / of the twone alone
In him abode / and all the resystence
For again death / he was there chief diffence
And in him hoolly / was their affyaunce
Their suerte / and their suffysaunce
In each thing / that them might grieve
And yet all this / ne might his heart meue
For to abide / yet of goodlyhede
They him besought / to their womanhede
He would enclyne / his herded heart of stele
That they might / a little drop feel
Oonly of pity / on their woto rewe
That lykly was / to morn and renew
Finally / to their distruccyowne
For of the Cite / sothly and the town
His unhap / were endelesse ruin
But yet all this / might him not enclyne
That he ne would out / in conclusyon
So indurate / and herted as a lion
He was always / contynuynge in his rage
Whose heart might / a soft nor a swage
Nouther prayer / nor waymentacyon
Him to restrain / from his oppynyon
For every perell / he laid so a side
And on his way / began anon to ride
Where thorugh his wife / none other bote can
But in her rage / to the king she ran
So a mased / in her mortal woe
That she uneath / might speak him to
So diffacyd / and rewefull of her sight
That by her hew / knows her no wight
For lost she had / both might and strength
And plat she fill / to the ground a length
Tofore the king / that routhe was to seen
Besechynge him / of intent full clean
Of his grace / to consydre her woe
For but he help / Ector was a go
And he seeing / her faithful womanhede
At her request / raughte anon his stead
And prycked after / oonly for her sake
In so great haste / that he has over take
Worthy Ector / within the cite
And hent his reyne / with great diffyculte
And maugre him / made him turn again
In such wise / he durst it not with said
Albe that he / was full loathe thereto
So that by force / and prayer also
From his stead / he made him a light
The a rest of whom / eschew he ne might
For he ne would / again his fader strive
Albe that he / felt his heart ryue
Of melancolye / and of hertely Ire
And of disdain / new set a fire
So inwardely / steryd was his blood
That like a Tygre / or a lion wode
That were depryued / newly of her pray
Right so he fared / all that ylke day
Or like a bore / that his tuskes whette
While the Greeks / and they of Troy met
Furyously walking / up and down
And in diffence / sothly of the town.
Troylus first / on his bay stead
Of adventure / met Dyomede
And each at other / surquedous of pride
With sharp speres / began togydre ride
And Guydo says / without any dread
One or both / had anon be deed.
Ne had Menelay / knyghtly go between
And after that / in a furyous tene
He smette his horse / in full k^yghtly wise
And Meryem / the mighty king of Fryse
Menelaus / marked has full well
And with his sword / full sharp ground of stele
Unhorsed him / and threw him on the grene
For he the stroke / might not sustene
This Menelay / was on him so wode
That it was lykly / even there he stood
With the life / he should not escape
For the greeks / full hastily them shape
This Meryem / as ye have herd me said
For to be set / round upon the plain
And to sesse him / by the auentayle
On every part / and cruelly to assail
All destytute / in this dredefull caas
But him to help / came Pollydamas
With his knights / and began to nyghe nere
When he him saw / taken prysonere
And maugre all / upon him set
From their hands / Pollydamas him fette
At whose rescues / there was so great a strife
That many one / therefore lost his life
For greeks rather / than he should escape
From their hands / in that hasty rape
Cast them plainly / that he shall be deed
Fully in purpose / to have had his head
He stood of myschefe / in so great disioynt
But him to help / even upon the point
Came Troylus in / most knyghtly of array
And of his manhood / made such affray
Among them / in rescues of this king
That maugre them / at his in coming
Delivered was / this mighty lord of Fryse
From cruel death / as ye have herd deuyse
But thereupon / came Thelamonyus
Proud in arms / and ever surquedous
With three thousand / full worthy euerychone
And he vnhorseth / Pollydamas anon
Among his knights / and proudly bare hy^ down
But troylus / has thorugh his hye renown
Myd of his foon / get him his horse again
But they of Troy / so sore were be layne
On every half / thorughe the greeks pride
That they might / before them not abide
For new and new / the hardy Achylles
Assailed them / with his Myrundones
That they compelled / of necessyte
In myschefe were / made for to flee
Home to the walls / and gates of the town
To great damage / and confusyowne
Of their party / that a back so gone
The which thing / when Margaryton
Beheld and saw / how the game goth
In his heart / he began to wexe wroth
And passyngly / for to have disdain
And as the storye / records in certain
That he was / both hardy and famous
And sone also / to king Pryamus
A noble knight / and of great worthynesse
And when he saw / the myschefe and distress
Of them of Troy / and how they began to fle
He cast anon / avenged for to be
Upon Achylles / for all his great might
And ran to him / full like a manly knight
On horse back / for the towns sake
And him enforseth / Achylles to take
Amyd the field / among his knights all
But Achylles / alas it should fall
That day him slew / by cruel adventure
Where thorugh Troyans / might not endure
The field to hold / but homewarde began the^ hye
And mortally / to make noise and cry
First for the death / of Margaryton
And for the pursuyte / that king Thelamon
Made on the chase / thorugh his cruelte
Home to the Gates / of Troy the Cite
That slew and killed / always as he rode
Albe that Paris / manly him withstode
With his brethren / that in baste were borne
But for all that / their ground they have lorne
Left and forsake / utterly the field
And home they went / and brought on a shield
The deed corpse / of Margaryron
And after that / their gates shette anon
The which myschefe / as Ector began behold
Of very Ire / his heart began to cold
And said platly / without more delay
He would avenge / his death the same day
And made in haste / his stead to be fet
And up he sterte / and on his basenet
Un wyste the king / or who be lefe or loathe
There was no gain / forth anon he goth
Till he was passyd / the gates of the town
More Furyous / than Tygre or lyowne
At whose coming / thycke as swarm of been
Tofore his sword / Greeks began to fleen
They thought it was / time to withdraw
And first I find / how that he has slawe
Two worthy Dukes / as he with them met
That besy were / his way for to let
The tone ycalled / was Eurypalus
And the the other / hyghte Hascydyus
And so Troyans / the field again have won
And of new / manfully begone
Greeks to sewe / and follow on the tras
And yet at myschefe / dau^z Pollydamas
The same time / was of greeks take
But Ector / has so borne him for his sake
Where as that he / sorest was be layne
And thorugh his knyghthod / reskued hy^ agay^e
And put the greeks / in so great distress
Thorugh his manhood / and his worthynesse
That where so ever / thylke day he rode
His sharp sword / he bathed in their blood
He was so cruel / and so mercyles
But than a knight / called Leothydes
Shope him anon / with Ector for to mete
While he was most / Irous in his hete
And set on him / full presumptuously
But Ector tho / deuoyde / of all mercy
Anon him slew / and threw him in the field
The which thing / when Achylles beheld
The great slaughtre / and the wounds wide
That Ector made / upon every side
He began anon / compass in his heart
And up and down / cast / and aduerte
How the greeks / never may be sure
Again their foon / to fight nor endure
Nor keep a field / with them for to strive
All the while / that Ector were a live
Wherefore he cast / and shope many weye
By what engyne / Ector might deye
At advantage / if he might him find
And thereto eke / Polycenes of ynde
A worthy Duke / was also of assent
Oonly for he / of heart and hole intent
In hope stood / his suster wyue
For love of whom / he felt his heart ryue
And in her grace / better for to stand
He cast fully / for to take on hand
This hye empryse / as I have you told
But while that he / was on him most bold
Ector him slew / there was none other geyne
The which anon / as Achylles has seyne
For Ire he wexed / in his heart as wode
As bore or Tygre / in their cruel mode
Upon Ector / avenged for to be
And furyously / on him he began fle
But Ector caughte / a quarrel sharp ygrou^de
And threw at him / and gave hy^ such a wound
Thorugh out the thyghe / upon outher side
That in the field / he might not abide
But him withdrewe / and anon is went
With his men home / unto his tente
And made anon / a Surgyen to bind
His mortal wound / and after as I find
When he was staunche / and cease for to blede
In all haste / again he took his stead
And lest he were / of that wound deed
Afterward / as it was great dread
He thought first / avenged for to be
Upon Ector / if he might him se
Of hap or sort / if it would fall
For him thought / to his pains all
It were to him / the best remedy
Of his hand / if he might dye
For of his life / he roughte not amyte
Be so that he / Ector might quyte
Death for death / in conclusyon
For that was hoolly / his entencyon
Of his desire / fully suffysaunce
By death unawarely / to give him myschaunce
But all this time / Ector up and down
As he was wont / plays the lyowne
Among greeks / in many sundry place
And with his sword / began them so to enchace
That as the death / where they might him seen
They fled before him / like a swarm of been
For none so hardy / was him to with set
And in this while / a grekysshe king he met
Were it of hap / or of adventure
The which in sothe / on his Cote armure
Enbrouded had / full many rich stone
That gave a light / when the son shone
Full bright and clear / that joy was to seen
For Perlys white / and Emerawdys grene
Full many one / were there in set
And on the cercle / of his basenette
And round enuyrowne / of his auentayle
In velvet fret / all above the mayle
Saffres ynde / and other stones read
Of arraye / when Ector takes head
Toward him / fast began him draw
And first I find / how he has him slawe
And after that / by force of his manhede
He hent him up / before him on his stead
And fast began / with him for to ride
From the wards / a little out a side
At good leyser / plainly if he may
To spoil him / of his rich array
Full glad and light / of his new Empryse
But out alas / on false couetyse
Whose gredy fret / the which is great pity
In hertes may not / lightly staunched be
The Etyk gnaweth / by so great distress
That it defaceth / the hye worthynesse
Full often sithe / of these conqueroures
And of their fame / rent away the flowers
Desire of having / in a gredy thought
To hye noblesse / sothely longs naught
Nor such pylfre / spoylynge nor roborye
Apparteyne not / to wrothy chyualrye
For couetyse / and knyghthode / as I lere
In one chain / may not be knet yfere
For kouthe it is / that often such rauyne
Has cause be / and rote of the ruin
Of many worthy / who so list take heed
Like as ye may / now of Ector read
That sodaynely was brought / to his ending
Oonly for spoylynge / of this rich king
For of desire / to him that he had
On horse back / out when he him ladde
Reklesly / the storye makes mind
He cast his shield / at his back behind
To welde him self / at more lyberte
And for to have / opportunyte
To spoil him / and for no wight spare
So that his breast / disarmed was and bare
Except his plates / there was no diffence
Aagayne the stroke / to make resystence
Alas why was he / tho so rekles
This flower of knyghthode / of ma^hode pereles
When that his foo / all that ylke day
For him alone / in awayte so lay
If in myschefe / of hate and of envy
In the field / he might him ought espy
This Achylles / cruel and venymous
Of hertely hate / most melancolyous
Which couertely / houynge him beside
When that he saw / Ector disarmed ride
He hente a spear / sharp ground and kene
And of Ire / in his hateful tene
All unawarely / or Ector might aduerte
Alas the while / he smote him to the heart
Thorugh out ye breast / that deed he fylle down
Unto the earth / this Troyan champyowne
Thorugh neclygence / oonly of his shield
The death of whom / when Odemon beheld
The worthy king / might him not refrain
But to Achylles / rode with all his pain
And hit him so / amyd of all the prees
Maugre the might / of his Myrundones
That for deed / Guydo says certain
Of that wound / he fill gro felyng on ye plain
But his knights / on a shield a lofte
They laid him / and carried him full soft
Unto his tent / in all the haste they can
And there I leave / this dedely wounded man
Full sore syke / till he may releue
And after that / when it drew to eve
They of Troy / with great reverence
Did their labor / and their dylygence
The deed corpse / to carye into town
Of worthy Ector / when Tytan went down
And to the temple dolefully they wend
And of that day / this was the woeful end
I can no more / but thus the long night
In heaviness / as it is skylle and right
I will them leave / and again return
To my matter / to help them for to mourn.
Of the complaynt that Lydgate makes for the death of the worthy Ector. Cap^.
xxviij.
BUt now alas / how shall I proceed
In the storye / that for woe and dread
Feel my hand / both tremble and quake
O worthy Ector / oonly for thy sake
Of thy death / I am so loathe to write
O who shall now / help me to endyte
Or unto whom / shall I clepe or call
Certys to none / of the Musys all
That by accord / sing ever in oon
Upon Pernaso / beside Elycon
So aungelyke in their Armonye
That tunge is none / that may specefye
The great swetnesse / of their goodly song
For no discord is / found them among
In their musyke / they be entunyd so
It sytte them naught / for to help in woe
Nor with matters / that be with mournyng shent
As Tragedyes / all to tore and rent
In complaining / pyteously in rage
In the Theater / with a deed vysage
To them alas / I clepe dare nor cry
My troubled pen / of grace for to guye
Nouther to Clyo / nor Callyope
But to Allecto / and Thesyphone
And Megera / that ever does complain
As they that live / ever in woe and pain
Eternally / and in tourment dwell
With Cerberus / deep down in hell
Whom I must pray / to be gracyous
To my matter / which is so furyous
For to a wyghte / that is complaining
A drery fere / is right well sitting
And to a matere / meynt with heaviness
Acordeth well / a chere of drerynesse
To be allied / as by unity
Wherefore help now / thou woeful nyobe
Some drery tere / in all thy peteous pain
Into my pen / dolefully to rain
And help also / thou cruelly yxione
And Belydes / that does the boget gone
And with thy stone / help thou zepherus
And in thy river / help eke Tantalus
That for hungre / haste so huge pyne
This woeful playnte / help me for to fine
Me to further / do your business
For now the stock / and root of worthynesse
Of knyghthod ground / of ma^hod shours and well
That tofore all / bare away the bell
Of derrynge do / this flower of hye prowess
And was example / also of gentyllesse
That never could / do amys nor seye
Alas Ector / alas why should thou deye
O cruel Parchas / why took ye no head
So cruelly / to twyne his fatal threde
Ye were to hasty / alas why were ye so
And namely / the threde to break a two
Thou Antropos / thorugh thy great envy
O troy alas / well may thou weep and cry
And make a woeful / lamentacyon
Which haste of new / to thy confusyon
Lost thy diffence / and thy strong wall
Thy beret up / thy suerte royal
By whom thy honor / chefely was begone
Alas alas / for now thy bright son
Eclypsed is / and thou stand desolate
Of all comfort / and disconsolate
Thy light is lost / and thou in derkenesse
I plounged art / for in soth fastness
Of all worthy / thou haste the worthyest
This day yloste / and the knyghtlyest
That is or was / are shall / I the ensure
Be ever borne / while the world may dure
No wonder is / though thou weep sore
And day by day / complain him evermore
That was thy shield / both in joy and woe
Whom thou were wont / for to love so
So tenderly / with all thy hole heart
That it may not / lightly the a sterte
To have him ever / in thy remembrance
Which was in soth / thy full suffysaunce.
For as Guydo / makes mencyon
There was no man / dwelling in the town
That he ne had / of very kyndenesse
For love of him / as he write express
His child more lefe / to a dyed in this caas
Outher his Eyer / so well beloved he was
If the gods fate / or destyne
Disposyd had / that it might have be
Woman also / of every manner age
Be for his death / fall in such a rage
Thorugh the cite / about in every street
That with sobbing / and salt terys wete
And here to rent / for dedely woe
Furyously / run to and fro
So mortal was / their aduersyte
That to behold / alas it was pity
Young maidens / and matrones old
Sobbe and syghe / and their fystes fold
And loud cry / and said finally
Alas / now shall our Faders cruelly
In our sight / be slain day by day
Alas the while / and no man shall say nay
Farewell our help / now Ector is gone
In the surnesse / of us euerychone
Was wont to rest / now is he deed alas
Of whom the body / when it carried was
Into presence / of Pryamus the king
Anon he lost / the office of speaking
And began him self / in salt terys drown
And pyteously therewith / fylle a swowne
Upon the corpse / cold as any stone
Inly desirous / for to deye anon
Without tariynge / on him as he lay
But that he was / by force rent away
His brethren eke / when they took head
Tryste and pale / for sorrow were nigh deed
And have them self / with rage all to torn
That never was / I trow seen aforne
Of brethren yet / such another care
For each of them / with him self began fare
As they would / have dyed on the cors
For of their life / platly / they gave no fors
But at the ground / with many sorrows sore
Like wild bulls / they began cry and rore
That routhe was / their dedely woe to seen
An heart of stele / might it not sustene
What shall I say / of Eccuba the queen
Or his suster / young Polycene
Or Cassandra / the prudent and the wise
Or of his wife / the sorrow to deuyse
Which rent them self / in tourment and in woe
As finally / they would them self for do
By cruel death / so they weep and wayle
That if I should / make rehersayle
To write their sorrows / and their complaynges
Their pyteous sobbing / throws and wepy^ges
The woeful cries / and the pyteous sowns
Their drery playntes / and Lamentacyowns
And all their woo / for to specefye
A large book / it would occupye
If each thing / I should in order tell
I trow it were / to long for to dwell
For any man / and tedyous to here
For many day / after as I lere
The women wept / before the corpse lyinge
Them self defacynge / in their complaining
That wonder was / how they might endure
But that they have / it sothely of nature
And of kind / for to weep and plain
To syghe sore / and into terys rain
Till the tempest / of their woeful rage
May by process / little and little aswage
And thus I leave them / syghe and sorrow make
This cely women / in their clothes blake
Shroude their faces / and wympled more i^ vain
While I turn / to my matter again
To tell plainly / how king Pryamus
In heart was / inly desirous
To cast away / in his entencyon
The corpse to keep / from corrupcyon
Which naturelly / but men take heed
Corrupt must / right of very need
For of kyndely / disposycyon
There may be made / none opposycyon
Above the ground / if the body lie
That of reason / it must putrefye
But if craft / be above nature
Vncorrupt / it might not endure
Wherefore the king / shope him to ordain
To preserve it hole / fro things twain
From odoure / and abhomynacyon
And therewith eke / by crafty operacyon
That it in slyght / be not found horrible
But that it be lyfly / and vysyble
To the eye / as by appearance
Like as it were / quycke in existence
What it cost / the king will spare naught
But made anon / before him to be brought
The craftyest / masters / of the town
Such as had / most discrecyowne
To parfourme / his axynge curyously
And they obey / his bidding faithfully
With all their will / and entyer dylygence
In the Temple / most of reverence
Of all the cowne / whylom dedycate
And of full yore / also consecrate
To Appollo / of old foundacyowne
Beside a gate / standing of the town
Called Tymbr^a / in their Troyan tongue
As in storye / is botheradde and song
And in this phane / that I speak of here
They made first / by the hye autere
By great deuyse / a little oratorye
Perpetuelly / to be in memory
Where was set / a rich receptacle
Made in manner / of a tabernacle
Egall of sight / for a large image
That raised was / on a rich stage
That was borne up / at each of his corners
Of puryd gold / upon four pyllers
And on eueryche / full craftily ydyght
An Angel stood / of gold borned bright
Ceryously the work / to sustene
With crafty Archys / raised wonder clean
Enbowed over / all the work to cure
So meruaylous / was the celature
That all the rofe / and closure enuyrowne
Was of fine gold / platyd up and down
With knottes grave / wonder curyous
Fret full of stones / rich and precious
Of every kind / that man can deuyse
So ryally / and in so thryfty wise
That the derkenesse / of the black night
With the bemys / of their clear light
Enchacyd was / where they did shine
And fro the ground / upright as a line
There were degrees / men by to ascend
Made so well / that no man could amend
The workemanshyp / and they were euerychone
Parformed up / all of cristall stone
Atteynynge up / fro the table bas
Where the standing / and the resting was
Of this rich / crafty tabernacle
Having above / upon each pynacle
A rich rubye / and raised hye on hyghte
Stood an image / huge and large of weyghte
Of massyfe gold / having the likeness
Of worthy Ector / that began his face dress
Toward Greeks / where he did stand
Aye thretynge them / with his sword in hand
And amyddes / all this great richesse
They have yset / by good aduysenesse
The deed corpse / of this worthy knight
To sight of man / standing as up right
By sotyll craft / as he were living
Of face and chere / and of quycke lokynge
And of color / sothly and of hew
Being as fresshe / as any rose new
And like in all / as be supposayle
As he lived / in his apparayle
For on his stead / like as it is told
Through small pypes / wrought and made of gold
That by mesure / were enbowed down
To an enter / made in his crown
By great advise / and subtylyte
To each party / and extremyte
Of his body / lyuealy porrect
Thorugh nerfe and synewe / driven and direct
By secret porys / craftily to extend
Whereby the lycour / might down descend
To keep him hole / fro corrupcyon
Without any / transmutasyon
Of hyde and hew / in any part to turn
And at his head / of gold was an ourne
That was fylde / with bawme natural
That ran thorugh / pypes artyfycyall
Thorugh neck / and head into many place
Penetrable / by veins / of the face
That thorugh virtue / and force of the lycoure
He was conserved / lyfely of color
Fresshe of hew / quycke and no thing pale
So myghtely / the bawme did auale
Comparysownyd / as it were semblable
To a soul / that were vegetable
The which / without sensybylyte
Mynystreth life / in herb / flower / and tree
And semblably / into every vain
Of the corpse / the virtue did attain
By breast and arm / spredynge enuyron
For the moisture / by discencyon
To hand and foot / sothly as I read
Thorugh bone and ioynte / began his virtue shede
And distyllynge / myghtely to flete
And at his fete / full of gommys sweet
A vyoll stood / tempred with bawme ymeynt
That by process / may not wexe feynt
But day by day / increase and amend
Of which the vapoure / upward began ascend
Causynge the Eyer / enuyron be delyse
To resemble / a very paradyse
For the flauour / more wholesome was and soote
Than the odor / of spyce go^me or root
And of pure gold / were four laumpes light
Tofore the corpse / brennynge day and night
With oil in sothe / if it be credyble
That was by craft / made in extynguyble
For it ne might / mine Auctor says certain
Nouther be queynt / with tempest wind nor rain
Nor by process / wasten of no years
Which in the Air / be bright borned wyres
Full craftily / raised were a lofte
Of whose swetnesse / men reioysed often
In their courage / it lyked them so well
And when this work / was complete euerydell
Round enuyrowne / full rich and fresshe to se
They made / a parclose all of Eban tree
That so long / last may and dure
The which tree / oonly of nature
When it is cut / smells wonder sweet
And may not waste / nor brenne with no hete
Though it be laid / among the colys read
Mydde the flawme / of many fyrye glede
It not consumes / though men assaye often
And in water / it houeth eke a lofte
And kyndely / to the ground it goth
Toswymme on heyght / in sothe it is so loath
And like also / as techeth Pluuyus
This tree whylom / was passyngly famous
Of so hye pryse / and reputacyon
That in the large / mighty regyon
And worthy land / of Ethyopye and ynde
Of yore agon / the folks as I find
Had this tree / in so great honor
That they gave trybute / to the Emperor
As is remembered / of Antiquyte
Of gold and yuor / and this rich tree
With these gifts / famous and royal
To quyte their debt / to him in special.
And when Pryam / in full thryfty wise
Parformed has / as ye have herd deuyse
This rich work / noble and excellent
Of hertely love / in all his best intent
Ordained eke / as Guydo can you tell
A certain noumbre / of prestes for to dwell
In the Temple / in their deuocyons
Contynuelly / with devout orysons
For the soul of Ector / for to preye
That the gods / his spyryte list conueye
Eternally / with them to dwell yfere
In joy and bliss / above the sterres clear
To which prestes / y^ king gave mansyons
There to abide / and possessions
The which he has / to them mortysed
Perpetuelly / as ye have herd devised
And whiles they / knele pray and wake
I cast fully / an end for to make
Finally / of my third book
On my rude manner / as I under took
And whiles they of Troy / weep and morn
Unto Greeks / I will again return
And with dulle style / on the storye trace
Oonly borne up / with supporte of your grace.

Hereafter follows the Fourth Book / which speaks how the Greeks made king
Pallamydes chief Captain of their Host / and deposed king Agamenon Capitulo.
xxix.
ECtor thus deed / as ye have herd said
And Achylles / in his Tente ylayde
with his wounds / mortal fresshe and grene
Upon a morenyng / when y^ son shene
Enchased had / away the derke night
Agamenon the wise / worthy knight
In his works / passyngly prudent
Has in all haste / for his lords sent
And when they were / assembled euerychone
Within his Tente / to them he said anon
Syrs quod he / and lords that be here
Kings Princes / and Dukes eke yfere
If ye aduerte / by clear inspeccyon
Ye ought echone / with hye devotion
Hoolly of heart / our gods for to herye
And in wardely / for to be right merye
If ye consydre / and wisely take heed
How that our enemy / Ector is now deed
That whylom was / berer up of Troy
Their full trust / their honor and their joy
Their hole diffence / and proteccyon
And unto us / death and confusyon
Vnlykly ever / us to have had victory
Whiles that he / floured in his glory
Again whose sword / we might not avail
For slew he not / at our aryuayle
If ye remember / on the first day
The noble king / called Protheselay
And after next / if I shall not feign
Patroclus / he parted even on twain
In the field / among us euerychon
Slew he not eke / the worthy king Menon
Archylogus / and also Prothenor
And eke the king / that hight Alphynor
Phyllys also / and Epistrophus
And to his end / he brought zantipus
And Meryon / the mighty strong king
In his way / as he came riding
He slain has / and other kings two
Cedyus / and Drodyus also
Polycenes / and strong Polybete
Letabonia / and the king Phylete
The manly knight / the king Isydyus
And eke the king / that hight humerus
For in his Ire / and his cruel tene
Of worthy kings / he slain has eyghtene
Which hyder came / out of Greeks land
By the power / of his mighty hand
Now laud and honor / to the gods all
Which caused have / that it is be fall
That he is deed / to our increase of joy
And to discrese / of our foon in Troy
As they shall find / in experyence
And laud also / pryse and reverence
Be to Fortune / that us has help well
With the tournynge / of her double whele
To hye comfort / and consolacyowne
Of us echone / sitting enuyrowne
That stoude now / in parfyte sykernesse
Thorugh death of him / y^ did us so oppress
And what may they / now wait on y^ town
But after death / and destruccyowne
And hastily / for to end in woo
Now that their trust / Ector is a goo
Without whom / they may not long endure
Wherefore we may / fully us assure
Our purpose hole / that we shall acheue
And finally / daunte them so and grieve
That unto them / it shall be importable
Of one assent / if we stand stable
For their party / tourneth on the wrake
And their hope is fully / put a bake
And dispeyred / in nonsuerte
For utterly / they and their Cite
Shall more and more / in weer of death depend
And we in soth / shall day by day amend
With help of god / both on see and land
For now victory / is ready to our hand
Void platly / of Ambygnyte
And excluded at Eye / as ye may se
Both of wantrust / and of foreyne dread
But I counsel / or that we proceed
Any ferther / upon our foon to ride
Prudently / a while to abide
And keep us close / for to pass our bounds
Till Achylles / be helyd of his wounds
And than echone / by mighty vyolence
Oppress them / when they have no diffence
As I have said / thorugh help of Achylles
And let us now / send for a pees
For two months / to king Pryamus
If it so be / he list to grant it us
As it is lykely / plainly that he shall
And they there while / with flawme funeral
Consume may / the deed bodies pale
That lie abroad / on every hill and vale
Which by report of them / that have repeyre
Fro day to day / infecte so the Air
Thorugh the field / engendrynge pestylence
Of stynke / there is / so great a vyolence
And we there while / may in ease and rest
Our wounds cure / me seems for the best
And they assente / thereto euerychone
And unto Troy / the messageres are gone
And have the trewes / granted of the king
And be repeyred / without more tariynge
And thereof made / full relacyon
To the Greeks / before Agamenon
And after that / when all was at an end
Home to his tent / every lord does wend
And while the trewes / endures and the pees
Among greeks / king Pallamydes
Complayneth sore / of Agamenon
That he so had / domynacyon
Above them all / having there at envy
And on a day / in his melancolye
Of hye despyte / and indygnacyon
Full inly fret / with yrous passion
He began break out / and his rancour show
By certain signs / though he spoke but few
Till on a day / wise Agamenon
Conceived has / of hye discrecyon
Hoolly this thing / though he ne would spare
Fro point to point / him self to declare
When his lords / togydre were present
Tofore them all / in his own tent
As he that was / this noble worthy king
Full circumspect / in every manner thing
Naught to rakell / nor melancolyous
But by attempraunce / inly virtuous
Well auysed / and wonder prudent
When that he knew / the menyng and the intent
And the conceyte / of this Pallamydes
He not to hasty / nor to rekles
But long abydyng / thorugh prudence and reason
Within the bounds / of discrecyon
Whose tunge was oonly / of Sapyence
So restreyned / that no neclygence
Of hasty speech / sothly for to rape
Might make a word / his lyppes to escape
Unadvised / for no thing him asterte
But it were first / examyned in his heart
For aye his speech / in so thryfty wise
Conveyed was / by doctrine of the wise
Under the Reyne / of wit and hye prudence
And after that / by form of eloquence
Always so said / that reason went aforne
So that no word / was in his tale lorne
And in this wise / showing his sentence
Tofore all / in open audyence
Said even thus / when that all was pees
Unto the king / called Pallamydes.
Sothly quod he / if ye take heed
Me seems plainly / that it were no need
Auysely / if he list aduerte
To muse so / nor grutchynge in your heart
Of all his host / that I have gouenaunce
Wisely considered / every circumstaunce
How I the estate / which no man may deny
Would in no manner / never occupye
By other Title / than fre eleccyon
Not interrupt / by medyacyon
Of brocage / roted upon mede
Aye under meynt / with favor or falshede
Depycte with color / of true entencyon
To supporte such / false ambycyon
Of which thing / here I will me quyte
Tofore you all / that I am not to wit
In any wise / of so hye offense
But stand clear / in my conscience
Without spot / of any such vain glory
Touching the estate / which is transytorye
Yet neuerchelesse / I have do my cure
With all my wit / to help and procure
That every thing / touching the comonte
Persevere might / in prosperyte
Having the eye / of my inward syghte
Unto the estate / of every manner wyghte
That were committed / to my governance
With great labor / and besy attendaunce
Indifferent / unto hye or low
To help and fostre / where I could know
That any stood / in myschefe or in need
Day and night / for to take heed
As I best could / by aduysenesse
Aye dylygent / that not fell in distress
For sothfastely / who so look a right
My days thinking / and my watch a night
And of my heart / the inly aduertence
Without fraud / slouthe or neclygence
Was faithfully / with all my full might
Me to aquyte / to every manner wyghte
Like his estate / without excepcyon
So that no man / justly of reason
Greek nor other / that is now a live
Unto my gylte / may duly ascryue
Any falsehede / engyne or trecherye
Of love or hate / favor or flaterye
In any cause / named in special
But that I have / be a like egall
To one and all / with all my besy pain
That no man has matter / to complain
For his party / of hye nor low estate
And to deuoyde / all rancoure and debate
Among you / I have do my deuer
In general / all thing and partyculer
That hyder toward / no thy^g has myscheued
And god wot well / it should not agreued
To my heart / to a set at any pryse
You to a chose / by your discrete advise
Some other / to this domynacyon
And I to have be / in subieccyon
With ease of heart / and tranquyllyte
Like other lords / here of my degree
And in my will / fully have obeyed
Like one of you / utterly to have deyed
In the quarrel / that we have undertake
If destyne / had it so I shape
I say in sothe / me is full loath to feign
And over more / also where ye plain
That I was chosen / without your assent
Marvel not / sith ye ne were present
Nor long after / if ye remember a right
Toward Troy / your way was not dyght
If ye consydre / is after nere
Or that ye came / passyd full two year
And so long / to abide your coming
It had be to greeks / great hyndrynge
Passing harm / and full great damage
And huge lettynge / unto our vyage
For if we had / without any wene
On your coming / tarried at Athene
It lykely is / ye can not well say nay
To have be there / yet unto this day
And where as ye / thought it be not credyble
Afferme eke / for an impossyble
That Greeks should / in any manner wise
Dare take on them / any great Empryse
In your absence / manly to acheue
It is but wind / no thing for to leave
For so it be / to you none offense
The greeks have / without your presence
Thorugh force / on water and on land
Full many thing / parformed with their hand
And acheued / thorugh their worthynesse
And of one thing / that in me ye guess
This to say / that of my degree
I should in heart / so rejoice me
Of this lordshyp / and this great estate
The more to be / pompos and elate
In there or port / that I it occupye
But me to aquyte / trewely and not lie
And to deuoyde / all suspeccyon
I will make / a resygnacyon
Tofore you all / for to excuse me
Now be auysed / discretly for to se
Whom ye list have / again to morrow pryme
Without setting / of any longer time
Prolongynge forth / or any more delay
And thus they made / an end of that day
And went their way / oonly for that night
Till on the morrow / y^ Tytan shad his light
At which time / a counsel general
The greeks held / but most in special
Of lords / was there congregacyon
As I have told / for the Eleccyon
And when they were / all met yfere
Agamenon / anon as ye shall here
Said even thus / with sad countenance
Lo syres quod he / touching governance
That I have had / and domynacyon
I have hereto / with hole affection
And clean intent / do my business
That every thing / might in wylfulnesse
To your increase / parseuer and contune
Record I take / of god / and Fortune
Which have conserved / and the cause be
You for to flower / in felycyte
That your honor / and your hye noblesse
Stand hole and sound / yet in syketnesse
And while your fame / is most in flourynge
As seems me / it is right well sitting
Mine estate fully / to resygne
Specially / while / Fortune is benygne
For of so many / that be now present
I am alone / in suffycyent
Without help / for to bear the charge
Men with to much / may over lade a barge
And namely in tempest / and in rage
And sith ye be / so discrete and sage
Of my burden / let me be releued
So that no man / therewith be agreued
But let us all / of one entencyon
Without strife / or discencyon
Chose such one / that most be acceptable
To you echone / and most couenable
You to govern / by discrecyon
And they echone / with hole affection
Assentyd be / to speak in general
Here men may se / how it is natural
Men to delight / in things that is new
The trust of people / is faint and untrue
Aye indiscreet / and full of doubleness
And varyable / of their sykernesse
Aye awaytynge / in their oppynyon
After change / and transmutacyon
Selde or never / standing hole in one
To day they love / to morrow it is gone
In whom full selde / is any sykernesse
For oonly now / of newfangelnesse
That has embracyd / their affection
They have instead / of Agamenon
Of new chose / oonly of favor
Pallamydes / to be their governor
And of all Greece / like as they desire
To have the Scepter / of the hole Empire
And to be called / about in every cost
Emperor / of the Greeks hooste
Right as tofore / was Agamenon
And this was fine / and conclusyon
For that day / of their parliament
And after that / every man is went
To his lodging / home the right way
But in his Tent / wounded as he lay
The hardy knight / the hardy Achylles
When that he herd / of Pallamydes
Fro point to point / and of the leccyon
He was displeased / in his oppynyon
And plainly thought / as to his advise
Agamenon / was passyngly more wise
And more discrete / unto governance
Than the the other / as to his plesaunce
And said it was / none eleccyon
But a manner / subrogacyon
Because him self / in the parliament
At the chesynge / was not there present
Arettynge it / passing great offense
That the choice was made / in his absence
Wherewith he was / of heart inly wroth
But where so be / that he be lefe or loathe
There is no more / but in conclusyon
In his strength / stood the eleccyon.
How king Pryamus went unto the battle / for to avenge the death of Ector /
where as he did meruaylous deeds of Arms. Ca. xxx.
THe Trewes passyd / and yweryd out
The wounded eke / recured all about
The next morrow / after Pryamus
In his heart / was inly desirous
With the Greeks / manly for to fight
Ectors death / to avenge if he might
This old Pryam / knyghtly in the field
That when Troyans / in them self beheld
The great will / and the hye courage
Of him that was / so far run in age
They began rejoice / and pluck up their heart
And specially / when they began aduerte
His great manhood / and his worthynesse
His lyflyed / and his hye prowess
And for his sake / every manner man
Began arm him / in all ^he haste they can
With Pryamus / that day to live or deye
And into field / they proudely him conueye
An hundred thousand / and fyfty of the town
Like as Dares / makes mencyowne
And worthy knights / they were euerychone
Without other / that with Pryam gone
And all before / went Dephebus
And Paris next / and than Pryamus
Menon the king / and worthy Eneas
And alderlaste / came Pollydamas
And as I find stern / and full of Pride
Pallamydes came / on the tothersyde
Into the field / with many strong battle
And first / when each other began assail
King Pryamus / knyghtly his wayches
Thorugh the wards / to Pallamydes
And him vnhorseth / through his hye renown
And like a knight / he kylleth and bears down
The proud Greeks / where so the rode
Was none so hardy / that his sword abode
For so narowe / he began them to coharte
That their wards / he made a sonder part
On them he was / so fell and furyous
For he that day / deeds meruaylous
In arms wrought / that wonder was to seen
And a marvel / how he may sustene
Of so great age / in the field to endure
For in credyble / was / I you ensure
To se how he / thorugh his great might
The Greeks put / proudely to the flyghte
And Dephebus / was also not behind
Again his foon / knyghtly as I find
To acquyte him self / and make them to go back
And Sarpedowne / in whom eke is no lack
Yfallen is / on Neptolonyus
The proudest greek / and most surquedous
And most famous / as of strength and might
The which agaynwarde / rode full line right
To Sarped own / with a spear round
And delyuerly smote / him to the ground
But Sarpedowne / full yrous in his heart
Without abode / on his feet vpsterte
And Neptolonye / in his Ire all hot
Through out ye thyghe / with his sword he smote
And than anon / the king of Perce land
That was so worthy / and famous of his hand
Of Sarpedowne / when he took head
Knyghtly to him / restored has his stead
Natwithstandynge / that Menelaus
Was upon him / passing despytous
And with him eke / the Duke of Athenes
Enclosyd have / among the great prees
The king of Perce / alas it should fall
And slew him / as he among them all
Full knyghtly faught / like a champyowne
With multitude enclosyd / enuyrowne
And he him self / but alone alas
All destytute / in this mortal cas
Thorugh whose myschefe / they of troy town
Began to withdraw / till that Sarpedowne
Has helped them / to recure their land
Full many Greek / killing with his hand
And king Pryam / so manly found at all
With his sons / called natural
Which upon him / where so that he rode
The long day / manfully abode
Partynge not plainly / fro his side
And the king / and they togydre ride
Full mortally / the greeks they confound
For Pryamus / with many cruel wound
Has slain of them / many worthy man
On horse back / among them as he ran
For there was none / that day / young nor old
Of Troy town / so hardy nor so bold
Of none estate / that has so well him quyt
Among Greeks / where so that he ryt
Fro point to point / to reken every thing
As has Pryam / the noble worthy king
For he alone / was confusyon
To the Greeks / and destruccyon
Their outter myschefe / and discomfyture
Before whose face / they might not endure
For things two / in his mortal ire
Inwardly / set him a fire
The hertely hate / that he bare of old
Unto Greeks / doubled many fold
With the death / had in remembrance
Of worthy Ector / by countenance
The which platly / thorugh his worthynesse
With his sword / he shope him to redress
For fret of hate / and constreynt of his pain
Were verily / thylke things twain
By which that day / who so look a right
His force was doubled / and his might
Where thorugh / he took cruelly vengeance
That he the Greeks / brought to outtraunce
And through his knyghthod / put the^ to ye flight
But Greeks than / attones did their might
By assent / to assemble into one
And for a sleyghte / a side out they gone
Into a plain / large / and fair to se
Between Pryam / and Troy the cite
To fine oonly / in their entencyowne
Him to debar / the enter of the town
For every way / the greeks have with set
That they of Troy / had tho belet
At their repeyre / the storye tells thus
He had the manhood / be of Pryamus
The which / anon / as any lion strong
With his sword / began ride them among
And severed them / with large wounds wide
And slew all tho / that would his sword abide
Every where / endelonge the plain
And Paris eke / has them so belayne
With mighty shote / of his strong Archerys
And with the pursuyte / of his Arbalasterys
That they ne might / of the shote so kene
The mortal harm / abide nor sustene
But began anon / to fle out of the place
And king pryam / so narowe began them chase
That of need / and necessyte
Thorugh the slaughtre / and the cruelte
Of his sword / sharp whette and ground
There was no greek / in the field yfounde
But fled away / eueryche to his tent
And they of Troy / be to their cite went
Because it drew / fast toward night
For Phoebus had / be reued them his light
And so the honor / of his hye victory
The worship eke / the laud and memory
Perpetuelly / and the palm also
Pryam the king / has won and no mo
For that day / in release of his sorrow
And as I read / on the next morrow
He has ysent / out of Troy town
For atrewes / to Agamenowne
Which granted was / the self day at pryme
Albe thereof / rehersyd be no time
How long it last / in the book express
During the which / they did their business
Hertely labor / and inward dylygence
For to ordain / with great reverence
How that the corpse / of the worthy king
Of Perce land / without more tariynge
With kyngly honor / out of Troy town
Shall carried be / into this regyowne
To be buried / with his predecessors
With outher kings / his progenytours
The which thing / was complete by ye aduys
Of Alysaunder / that called was Paris
And first the corpse / enbawmed rychely
Conveyed was / full solempnely
As write Guydo / with an huge route
Of his knights / riding him about
Tryste and heavy / cladde in black echone
And with the chare / the right way they gone
Toward Perce / ledynge of this king
The deed corpse / toward his buriynge
Which hallowed was / like his estate royal
And in this while / the feste funeral
Was hold also / with great deuocyowne
Of worthy Ector / within Troy town
Like the custom / used in tho days
And the rytes / of their paynem lays
The whichefeste / as made is mencyon
Fro year to year / by reuolucyon
Yhalowed was the space / of fourtenyght
With many flawme / and many hydous light
That brent enuyrowne / in the seyntuarye
And called was / the Anyuersarye
For that it came / about year by year
A certain day / in their Kalendere
In which of custom / for a remembrance
The people should / by contynuaunce
Plain and weep / and also pray and read
For their friends / that before were deed
Full pyteously / with their here to torn
Morning in black / and knelynge aye aforne
The deed corpse / of this worthy knight
Which in his time / passing was of might
And this was done / while the trewes dure
So that Greeks / trustely might assure
When that them list / at good lyberte
Without danger / enter the cite
Day by day / and Troyans might also
Unto Greeks / freely come and go.
AT which time / with full great delight
Has Achylles / caught an apetyte
To enter and se / the manner of the town
Without wisdom / or discrecyowne
For to behold / plainly and to se
Holy the manner / of this solempnyte
And forth he went / on a certain day
Toward Troy / in all the haste he may
Unarmed sothly / as mine Auctour says
Without assurance / or any other faith
Except the trewes / who so be lefe or loath
And first of all / to the temple he goth
Of Appollo / hallowed was the feste
Thorugh out the town / down unto the least
That cleped was / the Anyuersarye
As ye have herd / what should I longer tarry
And many worthy / present was there at
Amyd the temple / of hye and low estat
Lords / and ladies / of affeccyowne
From every part / gaderyd of the town
Now was the corpse / of this worthy knight
As fresshe of color / kept unto the sight
As lyfely eke / and as quycke of hew
To behold / as any rosenewe
Thorugh virtue / oonly of the gommys sweet
And the bawme / that began about flete
To every joint / and each extremyte
And at this feste / and solempnyte
Was Eccuba / and young Polycene
So womanly / and goodly on to seen
With many other / of hye estate and low
Tofore the corpse / sitting on a row
With here vntrussyd / cladde in wedes blake
That ever in one / such a sorrow make
That routh was / and pity for to seen
How they plain / and the death by mean
Of worthy Ector / of knyghthod ground and well
But trow ye / as Guydo list to tell
That Polycene / in all her woeful rage
Ychaunged has / upon her vysage
Her natyfe color / as fresshe to the sight
As is the rose / or the lylyes white
Outher the fresshenesse / of her lyppes read
For all the terys / that she began to shede
On her chekes / as any crystal clear
Her here also / resembling / to gold wyere
Which lay abroad / like unto the sight
Phoebus bemys / in his spear bright
When he to us / does his light auale
And aye she rent / with her fyngers small
Her golden here / on her black wede
Of which thing / Achylles took good head
And began marvel / greatly in his thought
How god or kind / ever might have wrought
In their works / so fair a creature
For him thought / he might not endure
To behold / the bryghtnesse of her face
For he felt / thorugh his heart pace
The persynge stremys / of her eyes two
Cupydes bronde / has him marked so
For love of her / that in his desire
He burnt as hot / as any fire
And after soon / with sudden cold he quoke
And always fyxe / on her he had his look
So that the arrowe / of the god Cupyde
Perced him / even thorugh the side
To the heart / and gave him such a wound
That never was / lykely for to be sownde
And aye in one / his look on her he cast
As he durst / and began to prese fast
Toward her / namely with his eye
That him thought / he must needs deye
But if that he / found in her some grace
There was no geyne / for plainly in y^ place
Of new he was / caughte in loves snare
That of health / and of all welfare
He was dispeyred / in his heart so
That he ne knew / what was best to do
Each other thing / I do you well assure
He set at naught / and took of it no cure
His thought was / hole on her and no mo
The long day / thus went he to and fro
Till Phoebus chare / low began declyne
His golden axtre / that so clear does shine
This to say / the son went down
When Eccuba / queen of Troy town
And her daughter / Polycene also
Out of the Temple / to the paleys go
And aye Achylles / on her had a sight
While he might / till for lack of light
He may no more / have leyser opportune
To look on her / cursed be Fortune
For which in haste / he maked has his went
With his knights / home to his Tent
Where he anon / without more taryinge
To bed goth / full tryste in complaining
Aye in him self / casting up and down
In his mind / and eke in his reasowne
From head to foot / her beauty euerydell
And in his heart / he felt and knew full well
That fynall cause / of his languysshynge
Was Polycene / of beauty most passing
For love of whom / so much pain he felt
That with the hete / he thought his heart melte
Aye on his bed / walowynge to and fro
For the constreynt / of his hid woe
For which almost / him thought yt he deyde
And to him self / even thus heseyde
Allas quod he / how me is woe begone
That of my sorrow / know end none
For I suppose / sith the world began
Ne was there never / a wofuller man
For I that whylom / was of so great might
So renowned / of every manner wight
Thorugh out the world / both of hye and low
For there was none / in sothe that could know
A man in arms / that was more famous
Nor y^holde / more victoryous
Tofore this time / remembered by no style
Unto this day / alas the hard while
Nouther Ector plainly / nor none other
Of Polycene / that was the worthy brother
That power had / when they with me met
For all their might / me to over set
Nor in the field / my force for to daunte
Here pryuely / as I me dare auaunte
But now alas / a maid of tender age
Has sodaynely me brought in such arge
That with the stremys / of her eyes twain
She perced has / and cloven every vain
Of my heart / that I may not a sterte
For to be deed / thorugh constreynt of my smerte
For who shall now / wysshe me or teache
Or who alas / shall now be my leche
Or who shall now / help men or save
There is but death / and after that my grave
For other hope / plainly is there none
Save in her mercy / alas and that is gone
For nouther prayer / tresour nor richesse
Force / nor might / nouther hye prowess
Highness of blood / birth nor kynrede
May avail / nor help / in this need
To meue her / nor my sad truth
Upon my woe / ever to have routhe.
What new furye / or inportune rage
Has brought my heart / into such outrage
Against which / I can not debate
To love her best / that dedely does me hate
And in good faith / who wisely list adueret
Little wonder / though she me hate of heart
Sith I am come hyder / fro so far
On her kynred / for to make werre
In the which / to my confusyowne
Her knyghtly brother / most worthy of renown
Have fatally / with mine hondes slow
Which in this world / had no fellow
Of worthynesse / nor of manlyhede
Alas alas / now may I quake and dread
And of my life / fall in dispeyre
For how should / I be bold to have repeyre
Or dare alas / come in their syghte
I woeful wretch / I unhappy wyghte
Or how shall I be / hardy to appear
In the presence / of her eyes clear
Certys I se / none other mean weye
But finally / that I must deye
So dispeyred / I stand on every side
Of other help / I can me not provide
And right anon / with profounde syghes deep
This Achylles / braste out for to weep
With dedely chere / pale and funeral
And with his face / turned to the wall
That routhe was / and pity for to seen
The hertely furye / of his pains kene
For so oppressyd / he was in his thought
Of life nor death / that he rought naught
And this continued / till it drew to night
That Tytan has / withdraw his clear light
And ever in one / like this woeful man
Ilyche syke of color / pale and wan
Without sleep / so fretynge was his sorrow
Till Lucyfer / on the next morrow
Tofore the son / with his bemys clear
Full lustely began / for to appear
In the oryent / when this Achylles
Impatient / without rest or pees
Quakynge aye / in his fever new
As it was seen / plainly in his hew
Till he abrayde / of anguysshe sodaynely
And called one / that was with him preuy
And of counsel / whom he trusts well
And unto him / he tells euerydell
Fro point to point / with him how it stood
And sent him forth / because he could his good
On his message / straight to Troy town
With full advise / and informacyowne
Of this matter / to Eccuba the queen
Thorughe his wisdom / for to be amene
If he might / by his discrecyon
Find any way / of sauacyon
Unto his lord / that he louyd so
And to the queen / anon he is go
And his matter wisely / began conueye
Tofore or he of grace / would preye
That she enjoys / to give him audyence
For in his tale / there was none offense
He was no fool / nor new for to lere
Wherefore the queen / goodly began him here
Of all that ever / him lyketh for to said
There was no word / ylost nor spoke in vain
For his tale / no man could amend
And craftily / he began to discende
To the substance / and told clearly out
With premysses / full well brought about
That finally / in conclusyon
The chief he said / of his entencyon
Effectuelly / if it would be
Was for to make / peace and unity
Atwene Greeks / and the folk of Troy
To which thing / he knew no better weye
Than of the werre / for their alder ease
By his wit / prudently to appease
The mortal strife / and the bitter rage
By allyaunce / oonly of marriage
If that her list / this wise worthy queen
That her daughter / fair Polycene
May wedded be / unto Achylles
Where thorugh their might be / a fynall pees
If Eccuba / by her discrecyon
Thorugh her wit / and medyacyon
And her prudence / might about bring
That Pryamus / were fully assenting
That Achylles / might his daughter wyue
So that it might / parformed be as blyue
Like as I have / made mencyon
By covenant oonly / and condycyon
That the Greeks / shall their werre let
And suffer him / to live in quyete
If the marriage / of these ylke twain
Parformed be / and knyt up in a chain
And when ye queen / has known his intent
Full soberly / by good auysement
Tofore or that / any word asterte
Full pyteously / she syghed in her heart
And at the last / with a sobre chere
She said thus / to the messagere
My friend quod she / touching thy request
I can no more / make the beheste
But at the least / I will condescende
What lies in me / to bring to an end
Thy lords will / with all my heart entere
But here upon / I must first requere
The kings will / if he will give assent
To the purpose / for which thou art sent
And over more / I must wit also
If that Paris / be willing eke thereto
Of which thing / with every circumstaunce
I will my self / make enqueraunce
Full faithfully / of Pryam and Paris
The mean while / what is their advise
Without more / within days three
At which time / come again to me
From Achylles / if he will the send
And finally / thou shalt know an end
Of this matere / and an answer plain
And home he goth / to Achylles again
With full glad chere / his lord ye more to plese
And for to set / his heart better at ese
Auysely / of hye discrecyon
He has so made / his relacyon
And told his tale / in so thryfty wise
As he that could / his words so deuyse
To bring in hope / into his lords heart
With full relesse / of his pains smerte
Whereby he made / his sorrow to withdraw
And thus while / hope began for to adawe
Amyd his breast / Eccuba the queen
To Pryam spoke / of this Polycene
Touching the sonde / of this Achylles
And of his profre / for to make a pees
She told him all / and forgate no thing
Whereof astoned / Pryamus the king
Spoke not a word / half an hours space
But in him self / began to compace
Full prudently / what it might mean
That Achylles / would have Polycene
Unto his wife / aye wondering more and more
And at the last / syghynge wonder sore
He discloseth / the conceyt of his heart
And said alas / how sore it does me smerte
To remember / that I may have no pees
The great offense / of this Achylles
Toward me / plainly when that he
Slew worthy Ector / thorugh his cruelte
That hoolly was / upon every side
The assurance / governor and guide
Of me and mine / platly for to said
And therwithall / of mine eyes twain
He was alone / the very sothfast light
Shield and protector / thorugh his great might
And his manhood / again the mortal rage
Of Greeks werre / in my crooked age
But now alas / to my confusyowne
He slain is / so worthy of renown
By Achylles / which may not out of mind
That in my heart / I can never find
To be allied / with my mortal foo
Rote and ground / of all my sorrow and woo
It were full hard / my heart to appese
To love him / that causes mine vnese
On every half / where thorugh my cruel foon
The proud Greeks / herted be echon
Against me / now Fortune is contrayre
Turned of new / my quarrel to apayre
That causes Greeks / wode and furyous
On me alas / to be presumptuous
O only for Ector / is me berafte a way
But sythen / I none other choice may
Against heart / though it for anger ryue
In this matter / assaye I shall to strive
Though me be loath / and sytteth me full sore
Yet to eschew / harms that be more
Which lykely be / hereafter for to fall
And for to save / mine other sons all
I will consent / that this Achylles
So that he make / a true fynall pees
Atwene Greeks / and also this Cite
Without more / plainly how that he
Have unto wife / my daughter Polycene
But lest that he / any treson mean
My will is first / how so that it wend
Of his beheste / that he make end
Without fraud / this is mine advise
To which counsel / assenteth eke Paris
And more rather / in conclusyon
For there was made / none excepcyon
In this Trete / of the queen Eleyne
That Menelay / never should atteyne
Her to recure / again unto his wife
For which Paris / without noise or strife
Or grutchynge outher / unto this intent
Within him self / was fully of assent
Thereby hoping / without fere or dread
Perpetuelly / Eleyne to possede
Right at his lust / and no man shall say nay
And after this / upon the third day
Achylles has / to wit of his matere
To Eccuba / sent his Messagere
And she told / him the answer of the king
Ceryously / gynnynge and ending
And how that he / assenteth well thereto
And Paris eke / and she her self also
If it so were / plainly she him told
Touching the peace / that the purpose hold
And first that he / his heste bring about
That they be sure / thereof him need not doubt
That he shall have / his purpose euerydele
If that he work / prudently and well
And hereupon / with informacyowne
This Messager / out of Troy town
Without abode / in all the haste he may
To Achylles / held the right way
And told him hole / the effect of this matere
And he always / fervent and entere
In heart brent / hot as any glede
And saw there was no way / for to speed
But oonly peace / as ye have herd me tell
And aye his breast / with syghes began to swelle
For the love / of this Polycene
And cast always / among his pains kene
To his purpose / away for to find
And whiles he was / besy in his mind
How he should his purpose / bring about
And in him self / cast many doubt
Anon dispeyre / in a rage / up sterte
And cruelly caught / him by the heart
Which has him throw / into such a weer
That him though / it was in his power
His behe^^e / to fulfylle in deed
Except he had / well the less dread
Every thing / to put in certain
Wenynge no greek / would his lust with said
From his desire / to be varyable
And to him self / thus was he favorable
For to parforme / and no thing deny
All that was lusty / to his fantasye
As is the manner / of lovers euerychone
That they suppose / to a cheue anon
What thing it be / that they take on hand
In what disioynt / that the matter stand
All though it be / a very impossyble
In their folly / they be aye / so credyble
And so Achylles / trusts finally
To fulfylle / his hestys utterly
Supposing / aye for his worthynesse
For his mainhode / and his hye prowess
In which he did / him self gloryfye
Some what of pride / and of surquedye
How the greeks / should be dispeyred
Both of their trust / and their might appeyred
Upon Troyans / to win any land
If it so were he withdrewe his hand
To help them / and therwithall also
Home into Greece / that they would go
From the sege / oonly for his sake
And their quarrel / utterly forsake
But it so were / this day fyerse Achylle
With them abode / the Cite for to spylle
For which thing / the lords by assent
Assembled were / to here the intent
Among them all / of this Achylles
By the bidding / of Pallamydes
And when they were / gaderyd all yfere
Tofore them all / like as ye shall here.
THis Achylles / has his tale ygonne
And said syres / that somoche konne
Both of wisdom / and of hye prudence
So renowned eke / of sapyence
Thorugh out / the world / and of discrecyowne
And be so worthy / also of renown
Kings / dukes / of whom the royal name
From eest to west / floureth yet the fame
Both of knyghthode / and of manlyhede
To that I say / I pray you take heed
This to say / if that ye consydre
The plain intent / of our coming hydre
By good auyse / and destruccyon
Had no ground / founded on reason
Nor cause roted / on no title of right
If it so be / that ye lift up your sight
And aduerte clearly / in your mind
Full far a back / wit was set behind
Prudent lokynge / and auysenesse
For first when we / of folly hastynesse
Took upon us / to come fro so far
Again Troyans / for to gynne a werre
And to Iuparte / our lives euerychone
For the love / of one man alone
Ye wot all / I trow / whom I mean
King Menelay / defaurded of his queen
To tell troth / me list not for to feyne
For ye well wot / oonly that Eleyne
Was ground and gynnynge / of all this debate
For whom / so many worthy of estate
Recurlesse / of any remedy
Life and good / have put in Iupardye
Our lands left / and our regyownes
Our Cytes eke / and our rich towns
Which by our absence / stand desolate
Wives and children / eke disconsolate
In woo abide / mourning and distress
Whiles that we / the sothe to express
Fro day to day / beset on every side
Lie in the flede / and our death abide
In sorrow and care / in labor and in woo
And wot all this / ye wit well also
Sithe time / that the werre began
Of our Greeks / how many worthy man
Has lost his life / thorugh dethes fatal wound
That might hitherto / have lived and be sound
At home in Greece / assured well in joy
If they ne had / come unto Troy
That to remember / it is full great pity
And over this / I say also for me
Among Troyans / in their cruel mode
I have lost / so much of my blood
That has full often / made pale of hew
This other day / also grene and new
I had of Ector / such a mortal wound
With a quarrel / sharp whet and ground
Above the theygh / so kene was the head
The same day / before that he was deed
Of very hap / as it was I shape
That fro the death / uneath I might escape
Which yet all fresshe / is upon me seen
Large and wide / and as yet but grene
The smerte of which / sore yet I pleyne
And in good faith / me seems that Eleyne
If ye aduerte / wisely in your thought
With such a pryse / should not be bought
Where thorugh / our life and our good yfere
And our honor / are Yput in were
And dredfully / hang in ballaunce
For if that ye / in your remembrance
Conceive a right / and cast up and down
The sudden change / and reuolucyowne
That fallen has / sithe the werre began
The slaughter and death / of many worthy man
That for her sake / has here lost his life
Yet the worste / of this mortal strife
Does most rebounde / into our damage
To disencrease / and eke disauauntage
And lykely is / to increase more
If ordenaunce / be not made therefore
And remedy shape / on outher side
By fine oonly / that Eleyne abide
With them of Troy / still here in the town
And let us cast / by good inspeccyowne
For our ease / some other mean way
So that the king / called Menelay
These him a wife / in some other land
Like his estate / by suraunce / or by bond
Under wedlock / confermed up of new
That unto him / will be found true
Sithe that we / without gylte or sin
May by law / from Eleyne twynne
For of diverse causes / be ynowe
Thorugh out ye world / of every wight yknowe
Of auoutry / for the foul vice
For to law / is no preiudyce
Though Menelay / justly her forsake
When so him list / and another take
That shall him better / both queme and please
And so to us / it shall be full great ease
When the werre / is brought to an end
Which lykely is / many man to shende
If it so be / that it forth contune
The great labor / is so importune
That we ne shall / no while mow sustene
For this is sothe / without any wene
Troyans yet / be floutynge in their might
And with them have / full many worthy knight
To help them / of hye / and low degree
And therwithall / so strong in their cite
On every part / without and withinne
That we are not / lykely for to win
In our purpose / though we ever abide
Wherefore by wisdom / let us void pride
And wylfulnesse / oonly of prudence
To have the Eye / of our aduertence
To our profit / more than vain glory
And while our honor / shyneth by victory
A wisdom is / to withdraw our hand
Sith we may not / constrayne by no bond
Fortunes whele / for to abide stable
Wherefore I read / or she be mutable
This gery goddess / with her double chere
Let us give up / such thing as lies in were
Whiles that we may / our worship save
For of the werre / the laud yet we have
Consider well / how by your manhede
Our most foo / Ector is now deed
And while that we / in our honor flower
My counsel is / or Fortune loure
As I saydeere / to change her bright face
While that best / we stand in her grace
By one assent / and one oppynyon
Without any / contradiccyon
Of heart and will / both of one and all
Or our honor / on any party palle
Into Greece / that we home return
For if that we / longer here soiourne
On the quarrel / that we have long sewed
Douteles / it may be schewed
Full great damage / this without fail
Or we have done / shall follow at the tail
Wherefore best is / our folly up resygne
And while our hap / is welfull and benygne
Most blandysshynge / and of face fair
The time is best / to make our repair
While that we stand / in party and in all
With our enmyes / in honor perygall
And fer above / plainly if that we
Could have an Eye / to our Felycyte
While that it is / in his ascencyon
But lest some man / will make obieccyon
That we may not / so our honor save
To repair plainly / but we have
Eleyne again / that is cause of all
To which thing / anon answer I shall
If any man / in his fantasye
To dishonor / or to vyllanye
Arrette would / in any manner kind
We to go home / and leave her behind
Shortly to say / I hold / it be no shame
Sithe that we have / one as great of name
As is Eleyne / and of berthe as good
Among us / ycome of kings blood
Suster to Pryam / lord of Troy town
Exyona / whom that Thelamowne
In keeping has / if I shall not feyne
In Troy town / as Paris has Eleyne
And sithe now / it may be none other
Let the tone / be set again the the other
And the surplus / of old enmyte
Bet wixe us / and Troy the cite
My counsel is / for our both ease
By one assent / wisely to apease
This all and some / and that we hens wend
I can no more / my tale is at an end
To whom anon / king Menelaus
For very ire / wode and Furyous
And king Thoas / the Duke eke of Athene
As they that might / no longer him sustene
To suffer him / they were so reckeles
Spoke all attones / unto Achylles
Not oonly they / but thorugh inpacyence
The court perturbyd / without prouydence
With tumulte / gonne to repreue
This Achylles / and proudely them co^meue
Against him / and his oppynyon
And said shortly / in conclusyon
Unto his reed / they ne would never assente
Nor condescende / to no thing that he mente
To be gouernyd / by him in this caas
For which thing / anon Achylles was
So full of Ire / and rancoure in his heart
That sodaynely / from his see he sterte
And went his way / as he were in a rage
Tryste and pale / and a wode vysage
And shortly said / for him list not feign
That he ne would / longer do his pain
To help them / how so that they speed
Again Troynas / for no manner need
And bad anon / this hardy Achilles
To his knights / called Myrundones
That they no more / with spear nor with shield
To help Greeks / enter into field
But keep them close / at home within their tent
Thus in this Y^re / he gave commandment
To all his men / as ye have herd deuyse
Them to withdraw / at every hye empryse
When so ever / they go into battle
And in this while / scarsenesse of vytayle
Fill in the host of flesh / of bread / and win
That many Greek / brought unto his fine
For they ne might / endure for distress
Constreynt of hunger / did them so oppress
Till at the last / king Pallamydes
As he that was / in no thing reckeles
Has thereupon / made purueaunce
Remedy / and ready ordinance
And by assent / and counsel of echon
He has sent / wise Agamenon
The worthy king / to Messa there beside
A ^y^ell I Will / oonly to provide
For the Greeks / if he might speed
Them to releue / in this great need.
And Telephus / king of that land
Of gentyllesse / has put to his hand
As he that was / large / and wonder free
And renowned / of humanyte
To socoure them / co^maundynge anon
His purueours / in all haste to gone
From every party / about enuyron
Thorugh all the lands / of his regyon
And faithfully / to search every coost
To take up vytayle / for the greeks host
And after that / full hastily he made
To stuff their ships / plainly and to lade
With every thing / that was necessary
To the greeks / and by water carye
At request / of Agamenon
Without tariynge / or delacyon
And so the king / with plente of vytayle
Fraute and Y^lade / began anon to sail
Toward the sege / he and his meynee
Aye costynge / by the Grekysshe see
The wind was good / and the king as blyue
With his nauye / at Troy did aryue
In few days / and Greeks anon right
Of his repeyre / were full glad and light
Of his expleyt / and his good speed
That he so well / has borne him in this need.
And after this / Pallamydes anon
As says Guydo / is to his ships gone
For to consydre / and look all about
Where need was / within and without
Any of them / to amend or repare
As he that list / for no cost to spare
In every thing / without neclygence
Touching his charge / to do his dylygence
Till the Trewes / fully were out run
And the werres / new again begone
Which many man / sothly dear aboughte
And ceryously / to write how they wroughte
My purpose is / plainly in sentence
Under supporte / of your pacyence.
DVrynge in one / the dedely cruel hate
That stynte may / nor cesse by no date
Atwyxe Greeks / and them of the town
To great damage / and destruccyowne
On outher part / feeling full vnswete
Till on a day / they cast for to mete
As they were wont / proudely with spear and shield
With their wards / entering into field
Armyd full bright / upon outher side.
And enbatayled / stout and full of pride
Full knyghtly have chose / their ground and take
Their large baners / with the wind yshake
Till they togydre / sodaynely have met
And alderfirste / Dephebus has set
Fresshe and lusty / and of heart yrous
Upon a king / called Creseous
And of envy / the storye tells than
On horse back / as they togydre ran
Dephebus first / with his spear as blyue
Thorughout the breast / even did him ryue
Unto the heart / that he spoke no more
The death of whom / Greeks plain sore
And for his love / such a woo they make
That all astoned / they have the field forsake
And began anon / unto their tents flee
The which in sothe / when they of Troy se
Upon the chase / fast began them speed
Unto time / that worthy Dyomede
And with him eke / the king Pallamydes
Of hye despyte / cruel and mercyles
With twenty thousand / worthy knights all
Upon Troyans / sodaynely are fall
And mortally / made them lose their weye
And to resort / home again to Troy
And eke with greeks / fell and furyous
The same time / came Thelamonyus
That hight Ayax / the strong knyghtly man
And like a Lion / among them as he ran
Upon Troyans / and them over set
Casuelly / in his way he met
Cecylyen / lusty / fresshe and light
And of his time / a wonder manly knight
And sone was / to Pryam as I read
Whom Thelamon / pryckynge on his stead
Slow cruelly / with his sword anon
Rasynge his arm / from the shuldre bone
That heallas / fill deed in the field
The death of whom / when Dephebus beheld
Wodder anon / than Tygre or lion
With a spear / ran to Thelamon
And smette him so / thorugh his plates bright
Of very force / that he made him light
And lose his sadell / be sete among the prees
The which stroke / when Pallamydes
Beheld and saw / and clearly began aduerte
Irous and wood / with a furyous heart
Cast him anon / to avenge Thelamowne
On Dephebus / full worthy of renown
And mortally his guerdon / him to quyte
And with a spear / ground for to byte
Sharp and kene / large round and square
Full cruelly / or that he was ware
Thorugh his harneys / without more areste
Dephebus / he smote so in the breast
That with the stroke / he brake the shafte a two
So that the tronchone / and the head also
Left in his breast / that there was no weye
Finally / but that he must deye
There was none help / nor remedy at all
The wound was / so cruel and mortal
That with the life / he might not abide
And in this while / Paris came beside
Of adventure / while this Dephebus
Was of his wound / so inly anguysshous
And began in haste / for to aproche nere
With face pale / and right an heavy chere
And for his distress / wept pyteously
And his knights / commanded hastily
His wounded brother / out aside fere
In all haste / that they should bear
Out of the wards / fro the great prees
Unto his pain / for to do relees
For to a brethe him / at leyser or to auente
In open air / and they unto him went
Maugre the Greeks / where he wounded was
And bare him out / a full easy pas
Toward the wall / fast by the town
And with great dole / and lamentacyowne
Full softely / on the ground him laid
Till at the last / this dedely man abrayde
With mortal look / and face funeral
And chere pyteous / so that each ball
Began turn up / of his deedly eye
And even thus / to Paris he began seye
O brother mine / whom that I loved so
Have now pity / and rewe upon my woe
Of kyndenesse / and of brotherhede
And to my words / of routhe take now head
Sith we by death / must a sondre twynne
For Antropose / shall no longer spynne
My lives threde / but the knotte break
Wherefore brother / I pray the be wreke
Upon my death / or I hense pace
It that thou list / to do me such a grace
Of kyndenesse / yet or I be deed
Out of my breast / or this sperys head
Be rent away / that thou auengyd be
Upon my foo / as I trust in the
That I may wit / he be deed or I
And that his spirit / it pass finally
And first descend / deep down in hell
Eternally / with Pluto for to dwell
Myd his bounds / that dyrke ben and low
For finally / so that I may know
That he be deed / there is no more to seye
I give no forse / how soon that I deye
To whose request / Paris took good head
And into field / fast began him speed
For thought / and woo / pyteously weeping
While his brother / lay there languysshynge
Not awaytynge / but oonly after death
Upon the point / to yield up the breath
And with his knights / Paris up and down
The wards sought / about enuyrowne
Till at the last / Pallamydes he fond
With Sarpedon / fighting hand of hand
Now was this king / this worthy sarpedowne
Come in diffence / of them of Troy town
Which of his hand / was a noble knight
And while that he / with all his full might.
Most besy was / Pallamydes to press
Like a Lion / whettyd with woodnesse
Pallamydes / in heart not a ferde
Let fly at him / with his sharp sword
So myghtely / that it was a wonder
For his theygh / parted has a sonder
And smote of / by the hard bone
That Sarpedon / fill down deed anon
So that Troyans / when that he was slawe
Were compellyd / of force them to withdraw
Thorugh the pursuyt / of king Pallamydes
Which upon them / was so mercyles
And as cruel / as a wood lion
After the death / of Sarpedon
The which alas / when Paris did espy
He marked him / with a cruel eye
And hente a bow / that passyngly was strong
And with an arowe / to his tyller long
Entoxycat / with venym in the head
That whom he smote / therewith was but deed
And hytte him so / in the auentayle
Thorugh out the stuff / and the thykke mayle
Into the throat / that it began thorugh pace
That he fell deed / in the self place
Pallamydes / this manfull worthy knight
Where thorugh Greeks / took them to the flight
And made a noise / and a woeful cry
The death complaining / wonder pyteouslye
Of their lord / and mighty governor
But late chose / to be Emperor
Their chief socour / and sovereign refu^
But now alas / they stand destytut
Of governance / broke and disarayed
Without guide / right as sheep dismayed
Disconsolat / and comfortles yshent
That each of them / flies unto his Tent
And they of Troy / sued on the chase
On horse back / a wonder huge pace
And mercyles slew / them as they fle
On every side / that routhe was to se
Without pity / or any other grace
For like Lions / they began them enchace
Till they compellyd / of necessyte
Constrained were / thorugh their cruelte
To turn again / and them self diffende
And they of Troy / down anon discende
Of horse back / even upon the plain
And attones / there was none other gain
They began the Greeks / proudely to outtraye
And cruelly / so to disamaye
That finally / there gayneth no diffence
So mortal was / the mighty vyolence
Of Troyans / that Greeks so diffoyle
And alderfirste / at leyser they dispoyle
The greeks tents / of gold and richesse
At which time / Troylus began him dress
And Paris eke / down to their nauye
With thurty thousand / in their company
Killing all tho / plainly that they met
And on their ships / wild fire they set
That to the wall / of Troy the Cite
Men might well / the hydous flawmese
And all had gone / to destruccyon
Ne had Ayax / ycalled Thelamon
Thorugh his manhood / and knyghtly excellence
Come anon / and made resistance
Of the Greeks / with many worthy knight
And tho of new / began the mortal fight
Atwene Troyans / and the Greeks stout
The read blood / rayllynge all about
Upon the plain / so hydously they blede
And here and there / both in length and bread
Deed and maimed / and full pale of sight
Upon the soil / full many noble knight
Atwexe them / so cruel was the hate
For in their fight / togydre they debate
As wild borys / even so they fare
For none of them / list other for to spare
And in the field / worthy Thelamowne
Thorugh his knyghthode / and his hye renown
So manly bare him / greeks to diffende
That no man might / in manhood hy^ amend
Thorugh all ye world / though men had sought
For he that day / in his person has wrought
Marvel in armies / thorugh his great might
That in sothenesse / Greeks anon right
Without him / had finally be shent
And their ships / attones lost and brent
Thorugh the pursuyt / of Paris that day
And worthy troylus / that made such affraye
Among them / thorugh his hye prowess
That fyfty ships / Guydo does express
Were lost and brent / or that Thelamowne
To reskus came / with his knights down
Unto the sea / the remenaunt for to save
But for all that / Troyans that day have
The hyer hand / of this mortal fight
Thorugh the force / and the great might
Of troylus oonly / which has so many slain
Of the greeks / in sothe that they were feign
Them to withdraw / and the field to let
For in abiding / they fond full vnswete
Wherefore they began / for to lose their place
Among which / the kings sone of Trace
That heber hight / wounded to the death
That he might / uneath / draw his breath
With aspere / in his breast styckynge
To Achylles / he came in complaining
Unto his tent / even there he lay
Which in the field / was not all that day
For the sake / oonly of Polycene
The love of whom / was so sharp and kene
Aye at his heart / ylyke grene and new
To whom Heber / with a mortal hew
Complayneth sore / arrettynge cowardyse
And in manhood / a very trewandyse
That he that day / might so for shame
Withdraw him / in hyndrynge of his name
Out of the field / to him full great reprefe
Of the Greeks / seeing the myschefe
That they were in / and confusyon
Upon the brynke / of their destruccyon
Abroad the field / to se them so lie deed
And list not ones / for to take heed
Of his knyghthode / greeks to releue
And while Heber / began him thus repreue
And the spear / which in his body was
All sodaynely / was drawn out alas
With Eye up cast / in rancour and in ire
Full pyteously / Heber did expyre
In the presence / of this Achylles
And therewith came / in a sudden res
Into his tent / a certain knight of his
Of whom Achylles / axeth how it is
Among Greeks / and clearly how it stood
And he answered / full yrous in his mode
Certys quod he / full unhappily
For they of Troy / have so cruelly
Our Greeks all / this day in their fight
Full shamefully / put unto the flight
So many slain / alas and wela way
That uneath / none ne went away
Unhurt / maimed / or withouten wound
So fell on us / Troyans were Yfounde
And of them eke / was such multitude
That I suppose / shortly to conclude
This day there was / to my oppynyowne
Not left a man / within Troy town
That able was / to stand in battle
With spear / or sword / his enmye to assail
I wene in sothe / but they come out
With us to fight / there was so huge a route
That we ne might / of force take on hand
In the field / against them to stand
But now my lord / it draws unto night
That they be faynte / any more to fight
If it were pleasynge / to your worthynesse
To your manhood / and your hye noblesse
To take on you / to your encrase of fame
For evermore / to get you a name
And there with all / for your own glory
Perpetuelly / to be in memory
To rise up / and arm you anon
And sodaynely / upon them to gone
Feeble and weke / to make resystence
Against your manly / famous excellence
There were no more / but we were victours
For ever more / and very conquerours
During the world / to be in remembrance
And they for ever / brought unto outtraunce
In soth fastness / I have of it no dread
But Achylles / took of him no head
Nor to Heber / that lay before him deed
Full cold and struck / of color like to lead
Nor ones list / to give him audyence
Nor unto him / have his aduertence
There may no word / in his heart mine
To that he said / to make him enclyne
For utterly / even like he ferde
As though he / no manner word ne herd
For thorugh his eres / it passyd as a sown
Lo here / the manner and condycyowne
The very custom / and the plain vsaunce
Of these lovers / hanging in a trance.
Honor worship / manhood and prowess
Strength / might / fame and hardynesse
Increase of name / virtue and victory
Knyghthode / noblesse / and in arms glory
All these / can love ley aside
Such is the might / of the god Cupyde
Which hertes hye / with his hoke can sease
So loathe they are / plainly to displease
Outher in chere / or in countenance
In will or deed / or disobeysaunce
To her that is / their souereyne lady dear
For with a look / of her eyes clear
She can full well / daunte all their pride
For Venus soon / so felly can provide
His arowes kene / to perce nerfe and vain
And them enlace / in his fiery chain
That oonly thorugh / his importable charge
They be restrained / for to go at large
Which cause was / this day douteles
That this / noble hardy Achylles
Would not / withouten any wene
Come in the field / for dread of Polycene
List that she were / offended in her heart
If any thing / escaped or asterte
This Achylles / thorugh mysgouernaunce
And whiles he / hynge thus in balaunce
The Greeks faught / with them of the town
Till bright Phoebus / was at going down
That Troyans / of necessyte
For lack of light / enter the Cite
And while that they / homewarde be repreyred
Lay Dephebus / of his life dispeyred
Complaining aye / on his dedely wound
And when Paris / and troylus / have him found
In that myschefe / they began weep and cry
As they would / for very routhe dye
With woeful noise / and with pytous sown
The ^alte terys / began to run down
On their chekes / upon outher side
And whiles they / upon him abide
This wounded man / began draw to his end
Whose spyryte was / ready for to wend
Out of his breast / and his weary ghost
Full hastily / into another cost
With dedely Eyes / tournyd up so down
When that he knew / by relacyowne
That Paris has / Pallamydes yslawe
Anon he bad / that they should out draw
The large tronchone / with the stelen head
And there with all anon / he fill down deed
And with the corpse / they began them fast speed
Toward the town / but for it is no need
The dole to write / and lamenciowne
That made was / for Sarpedowne
Thorugh the Cite / and namely of the king
And of the queen / ever in one weeping
Of his brethren / and his susters dear
It were but vain / to rehearse it here
But Pryam has / with great dylygence
Two towmbes made / of royal excellence
For Dephebus / and king Sarpedowne
With many Y^mage / graven enuyron
And many a knotte / koruen here and yonder
And buried them / but a little a sonder
Like the custom / of their rytes old
And whiles they / the feste halowe and hold
That called is / the feste funeral
The Greeks / have do made in special
A rich toumbe / to the worthy king
Pallamydes / and for his buriynge
Sosempnely / made ordinance
Among them / as it was vsaunce
And with great dole / and pyteous heaviness
They have this king / of great worthynesse
Royally brought / to his sepulture
And for they might / long not endure
Without an head / and a governor
They chosen have / to their Emperor
By one assent / and affection
The worthy king / wise Agamenon
And after they made / no lettynge
They of Troy / the next day suynge
With their wards / into field to goon
Fully purposyd / to fight with their foon
And Greeks manly / in the face them met
But worthy Troylus / so them ouersette
That Greek was none / shortly for to tell
Thylke day / before him might dwell
So cruelly / he began them / for to chase
For where he came / or rode in any place
They fled his sword / of their life in doubt
His young kynghtes / riding him about
Such as he was / vsaunt for to lead
And ever in one / the greeks blood they shede
Which like a streme / disteyned all the plain
And all this while / was so huge a rain
The same day / and so huge a myste
That every man / has his fellow myste
Specially / upon the Greeks side
That for the storm / and their wounds wide
And for the manhood / of this Troyan knight
Worthy Troylus / so fresshe so young and light
They were coact / thorugh his cruelte
Maugre their might / for dread of death to fle
To their Tentys / socoure for to find
Troyans aye / pursuynge behind
Full mortally / with a stern paas
But for the storm / they cease of the caas
And home repeyre / to their Cite strong
Till on the morrow / that the lark song
That Troylus eft / most manly in battle
The Greeks new / cast him for to assail
And Guydo wryt / this young champywne
Thylke day / as he rode up and down
Among his foon / thorugh his hye renown
That therne was king / duke / erlenor barowne
With his sword / where so that he wend
That of their life / he made a mortal end
All the while / that Phoebus gave his light
Till at the last / that it drew to night
That he to Troy / repayreth manfully
And seven days / suynge by and by
This life he ladde / with his knights fell
Upon greeks / as Guydo can you tell
Aye new and new / he began them so confound
His cruel sword / was so kene ground
That they ne might / in his mortal tene
Before his sight / abide nor sustene
Nor the vengeance / that he on them took
For where he rode / the way they forsook
In his trase / the renges / were so read
Of them in sothe / that in the field lay deed
For which slaughter / and confusyowne
The greeks new / sent to the town
For a trewes / to Pryamus the king
And he anon / granted their axynge
For two months / fully by the assent
Of all the lords / of his Parliament
Whereof they made / full relacyon
The Enbassatours / to Agamenon
And to their lodging / after forth they went
But how that he / unto Achylles sent
The mean while / his messagers wise
So as I can / I shall anon deuyse.
AGamenon / as Guydo list endyte
His lords sent / Achylles to vysyte
For certay^e causes / lyk as ye shall here
Which in the storye / be rehearsed here
And with vlixes / and worthy Dyomede
Duke Nestor went / plainly as I read
To fine oonly / by their counsayllynge
Into his heart / that they might bring
And induce him / to have a fantasye
To be willing / thorugh his chyualrye
With them to stand / as he has do toforne
That have so many / of their men ylorne
For lack oonly / of his hye presence
And Achylles / with dygne reverence
Received them / and with right knyghtly chere
And after that / when they were set yfere
Like their degree / anon in audyence
While vlixes / full of eloquence
Began his tale / prudently deuyse
To Achylles / saying in this wise
Sir Achylles / most renowned of glory
Thorugh out the world / to be in memory
And of knyghthode / very shoures and well
Displaese it not / now that I shall tell
To your / noble famous excellence
Nor to your Erys / let be none offense
That I shall say / but of goodlyhede
Pacyently / that ye will take heed
To my words / said of heart and thought
I you ensure / for I feign naught
This to say / if ye remember well
The first cause / and purpose euerydell
Of the greeks / if ye have mencyon
Was fully set / by one entencyon
As well of you / as of us parde
When we come first / to this Cite
Kings / Princes / I except none
Of which in sothe / to reken euerychone
Your self was / to speak in special
One of the first / and most pryncypall
Assentyd full / how Troy the Cite
Thorugh our manhood / destroyed should be
Perpetuelly brought / unto ruin
But now of new / I note what does enclyne
Your worthynesse / sodaynely to varye
And to our purpose / for to be contrary
Consider first / of you that be so sage
The wrongs done / and the great damage
In Greeks land / of them of the town
Conspyrynge aye / to our destruccyowne
If ye aduerte / wisely in your thought
That slain have / and to an end brought
Full many worthy / sithe gone full yore
And of treasoure / that no man may restore
Despoyled us / and brought in great distress
Our goods raughte / our gold and our richesse
Our ships brent / thorugh their cruelte
And to all this / alas / ye list not se
Now that they be / which may not be delayed
Thorugh your manhood / finally outrayed
Sith ye have slay^e / their hope / their suffysau^ce
Actor in whom / was all their affyaunce
Fully their trust / and diffence also
And Dephebus / also is a go
And lykely are / more to be apeyred
Fro day to day / and finally dispeyred
So frowardly / Fortune on them loureth
And now your honor / and your fame floureth
In his worship / and your hye renown
Atteyned has / the exaltacyowne
And highest prycke / of Fortunes whele
It were great wrong / and ye look well
Of wylfulnesse / for to be unkind
To her that ye / so frendely to you find
Or to be froward / while she is benygne
By influence / gracyously to assygne
Her spokys meue / unto your plesaunce
And hap to turn / with plente on your chance
After whose help / you needs not to call
Wherefore alas / why will ye suffer palle
Your noble fame / of very wylfulnesse
While it is highest / in his worthynesse
Your knyghtly / prudence / it should nat^a s^^rte
Of which thing / every gentle heart
Should have routhe / and compassyon
Wherefore we pray / of discrecyon
That ye you shape / this purpose to amend
And that ye would / of heart condiscende
With us to stand / knyghtly in this werre
By your manhood / that is spoke of so far
That your renown / to the worlds end
Reported be / where so / that men wend
Perpetuelly / by fresshenesse of hew
Day be day / to increase new
That the tryumphe / of this hye victory
Be put in storye / and eke in memory
And so enprentyd / that foryetylnesse
No power have / by malys to oppress
Your fame / in knyghthode / dyrke or difface
That shyneth yet / so clear in many place
Without Eclypsynge / sothly this no less
Which to conserne / ye be now reckelesse
Of wylfulnesse / to cloud so the light
Of your renown / yt whylom shone so bright
Your mighty hand / of manhood to with draw
Consider first / how Greeks are yslawe
Tofore your Tent / with mortal wounds wide
Thorugh out the field / upon every side
And have disdain / oonly for lack of routhe
Alas the while / for a little slouthe
To ley to hand / in their myschefe at all
That whylom were / their strong mighty wall
Their chief diffence / and their champyowne
Soueuerayne help / and proteccyowne
For whom ye have / so often shadde your blood
Again their foon / with them when he stood
Full myghtely / their enmyes to assail
Without whom / they little may avail
In very sothe / ne none of us echone
But ye of knyghthode / list with us to gone
Again Troyans / as ye were wont to do
As is our trust / and fynall hope also
That ye shall help / and our socour be
And here upon / we pray you that ye
Say your auyse / and your full will
And than anon / the hardy fyerse Achylle
When vlixes / concludyd had his tale
With a face / for anger deed and pale
Said even thus / all openly and plain
Sir vlixes / if so right as ye said
And have declared / in conclusyon
That our purpose / and entencyon
Was finally / to brenne and destroy
This royal Cite / that is called Troy
I hold in sothe / me lyketh not to lie
That our intent / was grounded on folly
To put us all / thorugh in discrecyon
Of reckeleshede / and hasty mocyon
Of life and death / in such Iupardye
And specially / in all the Chyualrye
Of Greeks land / for so small a thing
So many prince / and many worthy king
That have Iuparted / their body and their good
Yloste their life / and yspent their blood
Which might have be / full well at home i^ pees
And is not now / the king Pallamydes
Yslawe also / as who says but of new
That was so wise / so manly and so true
Of whom the life / was of more pryse alone
Than the cause / for which that we echone
Be gaderyd here / who so look a right
And of Greeks / many a noble knight
That have be slain / both of the worthyest
The world / to seek / and the manlyest
For out of every / land and regyowne
On greeks party / and with them of the town
Of chyualry / and of knyghthod ye sourayne flower
To win in arms / worship and honor
Assembled be / and come fro so far
Of which in sothe / by duresse of this werre
Full many one / in the field is deed
And verily / without any dread
There shall well mo / if the werre last
For every day / the nombre lasseth fast
Of worthy knights / deed without routhe
That I dare say / and conclude of truth
In this rage / furyous and wode
Full lykely is / that all the gentle blood
Thorugh out this world / shall destroyed be
And rural folk / and that were great pity
Shall have lordshyp / and holy governance
And Churles eke / with sorrow and myschaunce
In every land / shall lords be alone
When gentle men / slain be echone
Is not Ector / that was so noble a knight
That was this worlds / very son and light
Of manhood flower / slain pyteously
In this werre / in soth and so might I
Parauenture / which may not attain
To his noblesse / if I shall not feign
For by what way / shall we the death eschew
With all our might / if we it pursewe
Fro day to day / while that we lie here
Therefore shortly / me for to requere
Touching the werre / outher for to pray
Is but in vain / and harken what I say
I not purpose / in this werre or strife
For to Iuparte / any more my life
For lever I have / that pallyd be my name
Than to be slain / and have an ydell fame
For worthynesse / after death yblowe
Is but a wind / and lasts but a throw
For though renown / and pryse be blow wide
Foryetylnesse / leyth it often aside
By length of years / and oblyuyon
Thorugh envy / and false conclusyon
The laud of knyghthode / and of worthynesse
Of wisdom eke / and of gentyllesse
Fredam bounte / virtue and such grace
Foryetylnesse / can derke and difface
And therwithall / malys and envy
Yseryd has / the palm of Chyualrye
By false report / wherefore I say for me
I will of wisdom / such folly let be
And in quyete / forth my life nowelede
And over this / to you three I read
To seek peace / with Troyans if ye may
In hasty wise / without more delay
This my counsel / platly to you all
Or that myschefe / of death upon you fall
It were well done / that ye took head
Both vlixes / and thou Dyomede
And Nestor eke / sythen ye be wise
To work plainly / like as I deuyse
This the su^me and fine / of mine intent
And so reports to him / that has you sent
And they anon / with short conclusyon
Bepeyred be / to Agamenon
With such answer / as ye have herd me said
It needs not / to write it new again
And here upon / king Agamenon
Let make anon / a conuocacyon
Of his lords / and in their presence
Fro point to point / sothly in sentence
He has rehersyd / how that Achylles
Was desirous / for to have a pees
With them of Troy / and platly how that he
For no prayer / will in no degree
Again Troyans / with spear nor with shield
In help of Greeks / be armed in the field
Wherefore the king / as he that was full wise
Here upon / axed their advise
And what them thought / was best for to do
In this matter / sithe it stood so
And first of all / speaks Menelay
With angry chere / and said platly nay
To have a peace / it was not his intent
Ne that he would / thereto be of assent
Sythen the Cytee / in conclusyon
Stood on the prycke / of his destruccyon.
NOw that Ector / and Dephebus were deed
yt whylom were / their trust in every need
And their diffence / but now they are ago
Farewell their trust / and their hope also
Without more / and all their hole pride
They may not now / but after death abide
And trust well / without any les
Though it so be / that this Achylles
Ne help us not / toward our empryse
We thereof not dread / in no manner wise
Without him / for to have victory
By our manhood / and our own glory
I am full sure thereof / and certain
But vlixes / began replye again
Qestor also / of sudden mocyon
Contrayre / was / to his oppynyon
Affermynge plainly / that no wonder was
Though Menelay / sothly in this cas
Unto the peace / would not assente
For openly / they wyste what he mente
For he was ground / and root of all the werre
And cause also / they come were so far
Out of their land / he and the queen Eleyne
And for the sake / oonly of them tweyne
The Greeks all / which no man may deny
Their lives put / in such Iupardye
For him and her / if the ground be sought
For well they wyste / that he rought naught
This Menelay / what woe they endure
So he his wife / might again recure
And where he says / that Ector is deed
He has an heir / to speak of manlyhede
And of knyghthode / as it will be found
And called is / Ector the secounde
Worthy Troylus / which yt is his brother
In all this world / is not such a another
Of worthynesse / for to reken all
For he of Troy / is the mighty wall
And diffence / now Ector is agone
Ye know it well / your self euerychone
If it so be / that ye list take heed
Whose sharp sword / sore does us blede
Every day / in his furyous hete
Amyd the field / when we with him mete
And instead / of worthy Dephebus
Which in his time / was wonderly famous
His brother / Paris / is now found at all
In worthynesse / of knyghthode perygall
So that of them / we have none advantage
Unto this hour / but rather great damage
To reken all / sithe we be gonne
This very sothe / we have but little won
But we are lykely / always more to lose
If we continue / but sithe we may chese
It were wholesome / to live in quyete
To have a peace / and this werre let
By one assent / sithe ye be wise
ANd with ye word / Calchas began to rise
The Troyan traitor / with a pale chere
For very Ire / and said as ye shall here
A worthy Princes / what think ye to done
To change / so like / as does the moon
Your old purpose / and your first intent
Again the will / and commandment
Of the gods / that every thing govern
By purueaunce / who so can discern
Alas alas / why ne will ye at the least
Credence and faith / give to their heste
Which in no wise / may not be fallyble
For in sothe / it were an impossyble
Utterly / but Troy the Cite
Of ordinance / and necessyte
Might be destroyed / hens but alyte
If your slouthe / be it not to wit
So that victory / worship and honor
And fynall palm / eke of this labor
To be reported / on water and on land
Reserved be / hoolly / to your hand
In your purpose / if ye forth contune
And hyndre not / of folly your Fortune
This in sothe / I dare it well conclude
And peryllous is / the gods to yllude
Of neclygence / or slouthe wylfully
Wherefore I read / that now manfully
Of heart and thought / and of full unity
Platly deuoydynge / all ambygnyte
To set upon / and knyghtly to resume
Your force again / fully to consume
Your cruel foon / and let be shet without
Wan hope and dread / dispeyre and every doubt
Casting of parryll / slouthe and cowardyse
And let manhood / utterly despise
All dread of death / that causes hertes feynt
With cowardyse / for to be atteynt
That finally / as gods have be hight
Thorugh prescyence / of their eternal might
To victory / that ye shall attain
Like your desire / there is no more to said
And when Calchas / in conclusyowne
This false traitor / unto Troy town
The Greeks had / thorugh his words fair
Touching the werre / put out of despair
Of heart all one / they cast them to fulfylle
Hoolly his counsel / though so that Achylle
Be froward aye / to help them in their need
They gave no force / nor took of it no head
But euerychone / they them ready make
As ye shall here / the field in haste to take.
THe trewes passed / of ye months wayne
Into ye field / the Greeks them ordain
And they of Troy / again them issue out
And worthy Troylus / with an huge route
The Greeks began / alderfirste assail
And with his sword / he made first to rail
The read blood / thorugh their harneyse bright
That as the death / their fled fro his sight
For he that day / thorugh his cruelte
Cast him fully / avenged for to be
Upon the death / of Ector utterly
And as Dares / reherseth specially
A. M. knights / this Troyan champyowne
That day has slain / riding up and down
As mine Auctour / Guydo list endyte
Save after him / I can no ferther write
In his book / he yeueth him such a name
That by his manhood / and his knyghtly fame
The Greeks all / were put unto flight
All that day / till it drew to night
And on the morrow / in the dawenynge
The greeks have / at Phoebus vprysynge
Yarmed them / with great dylygence
Again Troyans / to stand at diffence
Among whom / that day as I read
So well him bare / worthy Dyomede
That many Troyan / thorugh his cruelte
Has lost his life / till Troylus began to se
This Dyomede / in the field riding
To whom anon / without more lettynge
With his spear / threw into the rest
This Troylus rode / and smote him on ye breast
So myghtely / that of very need
Down of his horse / he smote Dyomede
Albe of wound / he had no damage
And furyously / Troylus in his rage
Ofenuye / began him to abreyde
When he was down / the love of Creseyde
Of his deceyte / and his Trecherye
And greeks than / fast began them hye
Among the horse / in myschefe where he lay
To draw him out / in all the haste they may
And on a shield / brosyd and affrayde
They bare him home / so he was dismayde
Of the stroke / home unto his Tent
And Menelay / the same while has hent
A mighty spear / to avenge Dyomede
And to Troylus / fast began him speed
Fully auysed / to unhorse him anon
But Troylus first / made his stead gone
So swyfte a course / toward Menelay
That he anon / at the Earth lay
So myghtely he hit / him with his spear
That shield nor plate / might him not were
To save him / from a mortal wound
But his kynghtes / anon as they him found
Out of the prese / when they had him rent
They bare him home / to his own tent
The greeks aye / stondynge in distress
Thorugh the knyghthode / and ye hye prowess
Of this troylus / which has them so belayne
On every part / where he rode on the plain
Till unto time / that Agamenowne
Into the field / is a valyd down
With many worthy / about his banere
That shone full shene / again the son clear
And with his knights / him riding enuyrowne
He sore enchased them / of troy town
Wounds and sleeth / and put them to the flight
Him self acquytynge / like a manly knight
But for all that / without more abode
Among Troyans / fyersly as he rode
This worthy king / great Agamenowne
With a spear Troylus / smette him down
Maugre his Greeks / there gayneth no socour
And when they saw / their lord and governor
In such myschefe / at the ground lyende
They hente him up / and made him to ascend
Thorugh their manhood / on his strong stead
And he of wit / began to take heed
And consyderyd / wisely in his thought
In what disioynt / Troylus had the^ brought
And how his Greeks / for all their great pride
Tofore his sword / might not abide
He prudently / of hye discrecyon
This noble knight / king Agamenon
As he that had aye / his aduertence
On governance / thorugh his prouydence
When he saw / his Greeks began fail
And wexe feeble / to stand in battle
For lack of stuff / that should them recomforte
Full prudently / he made them to resort
Eueryche of them / to his own tent
And after that / he has to Pryam sent
For atrewes / to Troy the Cite
For six Months / if it might be
And by his counsel / Pryamus the king
Without abode / granted his axynge
Albe that some / as Guydo list endyte
Were evil apayde / so long to respyte
Their mortal foon / in any manner wise
But yet his grant / as ye have herd deuyse
Stood in his strength / fully as I read
In which time / of very womanhede
Creseyde / list no longer for to tarry
Though her Fader / were thereto contrary
For to vysyte / and to have a sight
Of Dyomede / that was be come her kynght
Which had of troylus / late caught a wound
And in his Tent / when she has him found
Benygnely / upon his beds side
She set her down / in the self tide
And platly cast / in her own thought
Touching Troylus / yt it was for naught
To live in hope / of any more recure
And thought she would / for no thing be unsure
Of purueaunce / nor without store
She gave anon / without any more
Holy her heart / upon Dyomede
Lo what pity is / in womanhede
What mercy eke / and benygne routhe
That newly can / all her old truth
Of nauture / let slyppe aside
Rather than they / should se abide
Any man in myschefe / for their sake
The change is not / so ready for to make
In Lombarde street / of crown nor doket
All poyse is good / be so the prent be set
Their lettre of change / does no man abide
So that the wind / be ready and the tide
Passage is aye / who so list to pace
No man is lost / that list seek grace
Danger is none / but counterfete disdain
The sea is calm / and from rocks plain
For mercyles / never man ne deyde
That sought grace / record of Creseyde
Which finally / has given / all her heart
To Dyomede / in relese of his smerte
And prayed him / to be right glad and light
And calls him / her own man / and her knight
And him behyghte / rather than he deye
In every thing / how she would obey
That were honest / him to do pleasaunce
For lever she had / change and varyaunce
Were found on her / than lack of pity
As syctynge is / to Femynynyte
Of nature / not to be vengeable
For faith nor oath / but rather mercyable
Of man's life / standing in distress
Here of no more / for now I will me dress
To tell forth / in my translacyon
Ceryously / how Agamenon
During the trewes / and the time of pees
Him self went / unto Achylles
Besechynge him / some reward to have
Of his knyghthode / Greeks for to save
And his presence / no more to withdraw
To suffer them / so mortally be slawe
Of their enmyes / pompous and Elate
But Achylles / always indurate
Ilyche new / both in heart and thought
From his purpose / platly changes naught
Fully enclyned / for to have a pees
But for asmoche / as Achylles
Of entyernesse / and affection
So loving was / to Agamenon
He unto him / granted at the least
A great parcel / touching his request
This to say / that this Achylles
Grants to him / his Myrundones
Full knyghtly men / oonly in his absence
With the Greeks / to make resystence
In the field / again them of the town
For which grant / king Agamenowne
And duke Nestor / thanked him of heart
But he always / contynuynge in his smerte
For the love / of fair Polycene
Ne knew no gain / to his wounds grene
But dispeyred / languyssheth ever in one
And when the trewes / passyd were and gone
Upon adaye / the morrow full benygne
Achylles his knights / did assygne
The field to take / with Agamenon
And as the storye / makes mencyon
He gave to them bendes / fresshe of read
That men may know / by their manlyhede
With whom they were / withholde in special
And like a man / deedly and mortal.
In his tent / Achylles abode
Into the field / from him when they rode
Oonly for dole / they should from him twynne
In his absence / a werre to begin
Maugre his will / again them of the town
But forth they went / with Agamenowne
Upon Troyans / stern and full of pride
But with them met / on the other side
The manly knights / of Troyanysshe blood
Which were on them / so furyous and wode
That cruelly / the greeks they oppress
So that a back / for fere they began them dress
They were on them / so inly fell and kene
Till that the Duke / of Athene
Entrede in / the Greeks to diffende
But upon him / unawarely / or he wend
Came mighty troylus / like a wood lyowne
And from his stead / anon he bare him down
And after that / he put him so in prees
Till he met / with Myrundones
And of them slew / that day full many one
And so fet in / Troylus is Ygone
That he greeks / put utterly to flight
Thorugh his knyghthod / till it drew to night
and fro his sword / no raunsou^ might the^ borowe
And Guydo write / that on the next morrow
Full mortal was / the slaughter / on outher side
Amyd the field / as they togydre ride
Of manly knights / that wonder was to seen
And as they faughte / the king Phylymene
With help oonly / of Pollydamas
Taken has / the worthy king Thoas
And began him led / toward Troy town
But Myrundones / on him come down
Wonder proudely / and after began to sewe
And through their might / Thoas they reskewe
And him deliver / for they were so strong
But troylus than / hurtled them among
Furyously / like a champyowne
Now here now there / cast and threw the^ down
Some he slew / and some he made blede
Till cruelly / they slew his mighty stead
Which he sat on / and yet neuertherles
He faught on foot / again Myrundones
That had cast troylus / to have take
But Paris / tho / began them so a wake
With his brethren / that about him rode
That in the place / where as troylus stood
Upon his fete / but him self alone
Of Myrundones / they slew many one
That of knighthod / thorugh their manlyhede
They unto him / brought another stead
Amyd his foon / and made him to ascend
And he full knyghtly / began him self diffende
Be set with greeks / in the self stounde
That never yet / a better knight was found
They felt it well / that were his foon
But than his brother / called Emargaron
So as he faught / putting him self in prees
Was slain alas / among Myrundones
The death of whom / in a cruel ire
Troylus with anger / new set a fire
Plainly purposes / to avenge if he may
And with his sword / began to make way.
And Paris aye / fast by riding
And all his brethren / upon him awaytynge
Which all yfere / were so mercyles
As I find / upon Myrundones
That of force / and necessyte
They were compelled / plainly for to fle
Troylus on them / was so Furyous
So vengeable eke / and so despytous
That he them gave / many mortal wound
And yet in sothe / that day they were found
Noble knights / and quyt them wonder well
For they the craft / knew euerydele
Longing to armies / of them as I read
But for all that / he made their sides blede
Thorughe the mayle / and their plates shene
That they ne might / plainly not sustene
The sword of troylus / them chasyng ouerall
Albe they kept / them close as any wall
Hole togydre / and went not a sonder
But troylus aye / them chaseth here and yonder
And severed them maugre all their might
Till into field / with many worthy knight
Came Menelay / and king Agamenon
Vlixes eke / and cruel Thelamon
And Dyomede / which of his wounds grene
Recuryd was / as says mine Auctor clean
And on Troyans / sodaynely they fall
With their wards / and their knights all
And tho began / the fight to renew
On every half / that with blody hew
The plates bright / were of new steyned
And they of troy / so manly have them peyned
Again their foon / in this mighty strife
That many greek / was berafte his life
And where they were / most mighty in battle
Troylus came in / and began them to assail
On every part / with many blody wound
And by his knyghthode / began them to comfou^de
That aye they fled / so they were aferde
The mortal strokes / of his sharp sword
Their deedly foo / and destruccyon
And this contynueth / till king Thelamon
By his manhood / when that he beheld
The greeks made / recure again the field
And began Troyans / assail wonder sore
And tho began / the slaughter more and more
On each side till / troylus new again
The greeks has / so fyersly ouerlayne
Myrundones / and them euerychone
Before his sword / that he made them gone
To their tents / and the field for sake
And with his hand / that day he has take
An hundred knights / that came in his weye
Thorugh his prowess / and sent them into troy
And ever in one / began so to enchace
Myrundones / that they lost their place
And to Achylles / lyenge in his tent
They repeyre / forwounde / and to rent
Their harneys broke / both plate and mayle
And of nombre / I find that they fail
An hundred knights / slain and deed alas
That after were found / in the Taas
Amyd the field / thorugh gyrt with many wound
Of Troylus sword / Ector the secounde
Whereof Achylles / when he had a sight
So heavy was / all the next night
In his bed / walo wynge to and fro
Deuoyde of sleep / for constreynt of his woe
At his heart / his wound was so kene
What for his men / and fair Polycene
Wyttynge well / if he did his pain
To be venged / he should not attain
In no wise / unto his desire
And thus he brent / in a double fire
Of love and Ire / that made him shyghe sore
But for cause / love was the more
He was aferde / again them of the town
In his person / to do offencyowne
List Pryamus / and Eccubathe queen
Offended were / and namely Polycene
And thus he stood / in a double weer
That his heart / satte him wonder near
With many wonder / diverse fantasye
As have lovers / that be in point to dye
Right even so fares / this woeful man
For very woo / that no read ne can
So entryked / that wend to deye
Of his recure / he knew no better weye
And while he lay / this in this throws white
Like as Guydo / plainly / list endyte
And the storye / makes mencyowne
That days seven / they of troy town
To increase and augment / of their sorrow
With the Greeks / met every morrow
That thorugh the force / of both their might
On outher part / was slain many a knight
And all this while / lay this Achylles
Of Greeks death / ylyke reckeles
For love oonly / and took no manner head
Who so were hole / or mortally does blede
Or who that playneth / with his wounds large
Him thought it was / no parcel of his charge
So much he has / on other thing to think
That often he waketh / when he should wynke
Thoughtfull aye / and Ymagynatyfe
And very weary / of his own life
Till on a day / king Agamenon
Seeing the death / and destruccyon
On Greeks half / without remedy
To Troy sent / by enbassatrye
For a trewes / certain days space
But he might / thereof have no grace
Longer time / platly to endure
Than for leyser / of the Sepulture
Of worthy knights / that were deed aforne
In the field / on outher party lorne
Which in the taas / full besely they sought
And after this / plainly how they wroughte
During the sege / with great vyolence
I shall descryue / with your pacyence.
How Achylles slew the worthy Troylus Ectors brother vnknyghtly / and trayled
him about the field at his horse tail. Ca. xxxi.
THe cruel force / and mortal ire
Of Martys might / always set a fire
With new envy / gonne of old hatrede
Bre^nynge in hertes / hot as any glede
Atwyxe Greeks / and Troy the Cite
Which lykely is not / staunched for to be
Till death consume / with his mortal darte
Full many worthy / upon outher part
To execute / alas / by fynall fate
Each on other / the enuyous deedly hate
Which they ne might / by destyne remewe
Nor for Parchas / at lyberte eschew
For Antropos / will suffer it be none other
That is maystresse / and guyder of therother
Of dethes ship / till all goth unto wrake
And Fortune began / turn her face bake
Of hye disdain / fro Troy the Cite
As in this storye / right soon ye shall se.
For when the trewes / that they had take
Were wered out / they began them ready make
The proud Greeks / and into field they gone
Upon a morrow / when Phoebus bright shone
Armed full shene / eueryche at his deuyse
And Menelay first / met with Paris
That day / in storye as I read
And each of them / smet other of his stead
A^ which time / dau^z Pollydamas
To Vlixes / rode a stern paas
And each at other / of cruel enmyte
With styffe swerdes / began togydre flee
That nouther was / of manhood for to wit
And with aspere / squared for to byte
The mighty Duke / called Meneste
Rode line right / that all might se
To Anthenor / the Troyan full of pride
And from his sadell / cast him down aside
In his furye / and his hateful tene
And tho in all haste / came king Phylemene
Oonly in help / of them of the town
And began assail / king Agamenowne
Thorugh his knyghthode / and his hardynesse
That he him had / brought in great distress
To outter myschefe / and confusyon
Ne had oonly be / that king Thelamon
Full proudely came / him for to reskewe
And after sore / began for to pursewe
With a spear / upon Phylemene
And for his horse / he laid him on the grene
Maugre his force / the storye tells thus
For he to him / was mortally Irous
And after that / young Archylogus
A mortal couts / ran unto Brumus
One of the sons / of Pryamus the king
Young and deliver / and best in his liking
But he him smette / with so great a might
That he fell deed / this fresshe lusty knight
The death of whom / when they of Troy espy
They made a shoute / and pyteously began cry
Of woeful routhe / and his death complain
Till the noise / began utterly attain
To troylus Erys / platly where he rode
And he no longer / after that abode
But to the place / felly began approach
And with his sword / for to set a broche
Without routhe / the greeks hateful blood
And mercyles / all that him withstode
He slew that day / by cruel adventure
That greek was none / y^ which might endure
Tofore his sword / he began them so oppress
For of knyghthode / and of hye prowess
He had them put / utterly to flight
Ne had been / the manhood / and the might
Of Myrundones / which all that day
By one assent / upon Troylus lay
Whereof he was / full melancolyus
And of courage / and manhood most famous
He ne list / no longer for to let
But all attones / upon them he set
And furyously / began among them ride
And some he smote / even thorugh the side
Thorugh the body / and some thorugh y^ heart
And with his sword / thorugh doublet and sherte
Thorugh shield and plate / and thorugh haberion
He percyd has / and like a wood lion
He slew that day / of them many one
That maugre them / they fled euerychone
With the Greeks / eueryche to his tent
And they of Troy / after them be went
Swyftly on horse / till they have them take
And such a murdre / of greeks there they make
That finally / there was no better reskuse
But oonly death / so passyngly confuse
The greeks were / at myschefe desolate
Troylus so narowe / brought the^ to chekmate
That they could / no better remedy
But hydously / for to wayle and cry
To death forwounded / with a grysely chere
That Achylles / when he began first here
The dredefull noise / and the woeful sown
That caused was / by refleccyowne
Of air again / who so could it know
In rochys hard / and kauernys low
Like as it were / one word spoke of two
That men are wont / to called an Ecco
So confuse was / the lamentacyowne
On greeks side / of which the deedly sown
So pyteously / to Achylles is run
Of them that lay / again the hot son
With mortal wounds / yeldynge up the breath
With roumble and swowhe / resownyng into death
Such a noise / greeks made there
And what it meant / Achylles did enquere
And what the cause / was of their clamor
And they told him / for lack of socour
The greeks were each / in his Centorye
Of Troylus slain / so that the victory
Goth finally / with them of Troy town
For evermore / in conclusyowne
So many greek lay / slain in this tent
Gapynge upward / that his blood yspent
Thorugh the constreynt / of his wou^des smerte
And while Achylles / began aduerte
Full sodaynely / there came to him a man
The which his tale / even thus began
Alas quod he / how may ye sustene
To se your men / hereupon the grene
Before your face / slain and lie deed
And list not ones / for to take heed
But stand stylle / pensyfe in your tent
Upon the point / your self to be shent
In hasty hour / if ye here abide
For fyfty thousand / knights here beside
Ready armed / in plates and in mayle
Cast them plainly / attones you to sail
This no doubt / unarmed as ye stand
But ye of knyghthode / manly take on hand
To resyste / in this self place
And like a man / to mete them in the face
For which anon / in a cruel mode
This Achylles / like as he were wode
Armed him / fomynge as a bore
Farewell his love / he set of it no store
Of hasty hete / his ire was so kene
That he forgot / fair Polycene
And her beauty / yt whylom made him smert
And in a rage / up anon he sterte
And took his stead / as any Lion wroth
Again Troyans / and into field he goth
Like a wolf / that is with hunger gnawe
Right so began he / again his foon to draw
And where he rode / without excepcyowne
He wounds / sleeth / kylleth / and bears down
Now here / now there / in a little throw
That they of troy / began his sword to know
Which was infecte / of new with their blood
For there was none / as yet yt him withstode
So mortally he began / about him layne
The deed bodies / enlonge the plain
Till casuelly / Troylus began espy
This Achylles / as he cast an eye
And began his horse / with spores to constrayne
And rode at him / with all his might and pain
But Achylles / of him was ware also
Smette his stead / and made him for to go
Toward Troylus / in the self tide
And with full course / as they togydre ride
Full line right / their speres sharp whette
With such a might / they have togydre met
Of hye disdain / there is no more to said
That to the ground / they fell both twain
But Achylles / caught such a wound
In his body / so deep and profounde
That long he lay / mine Auctor says certain
Or he to health / restored was again.
And troylus eke / thorugh plates mayle and all
As write Guydo / had a wound small
Which unto him / did no greuaunce
And thus that day / by contynuaunce
And days six / suynge by and by
The proud greeks / met cruelly
Amyd the field / them of Troy town
To great damage / and confusyowne
Of outher party / plainly this no nay
For many worthy / was slain day by day
In their rancour / and hertely hoote envy
Albe Guydo / does not specefye
None of their names / plainly in this book
As ye shall find / if ye list to look.
ANd all this while / for this sodeyn thing
Pensyfe and tryste / was Pryamus ye king
That Achylles / turned has so clean
His heart away / fro young Polycene
And for this change / so sudden and so new
Thought his behestes / were not all true
But on deceyte / and doubylnesse
On fraud falsely / and new fangylnesse
On sleyghty treason / an vncouert gyle
Or rage of love / that lasts but a while
Was utterly / found his beheste
For like a wind / that no man may areste
Fares a word / discordaunt fro the deed
Of which a wise man / take shall no head
But let pass / as he were reckeles
For albe it / that this Achylles
Was whylom caught / within loves snare
Him list not now / ones for tospare
Of hye rancour / his lady to offend
It was not like / as they of troy wend
Eccuba / nouther Polycene
Wherefore Pryam / spoke unto the queen
In an anger / and began her to abreyde
That she her trust / so entyerly leyde
On Achylles / that can so falsely mean
Wherefore full tryste / was this Polycene
That was enclyned / with her eyes clear
By the counsel / of her mother dear
To have be weddyd / to Achylles
To fine oonly / there should have be a pees
At wene greeks / and them of troy town
But all was false / in conclusyowne
In the fine / was the truth ysene
For when Achylles / of his wounds grene
Was fully curyd / by a certain day
He began compass / in all that ever he may
And ymagyne / in his enuyous heart
To be vengyd / of his wounds smerte
Upon troylus / that stacke aye in his mind
At advantage / if he might him find
To him he bare / so passyngly hatrede
In his heart / brennynge as the glede
Which day nor night / may in no degree
Fully be queynt / till he auengyd be
The hoote rancour / began so on him gnawe
Auysed platly / that he shall be slawe
Of his hondes / when so that it fall
And on a day / to him he began call
Myrundones / his knights euerychone
Upon a morrow / when the greeks gone
Tofore the town / in steel armed bright
Again troyans / of purpose for to fight
And they were come / proudely into field
In the opposyt / with many rich shield
Newely depeynt / with colors fresshe and fine
Upon which / full bright began to shine
Fiery Tytan / gold tressyd in his spear
At his vpryste / with his bemysclere
When this fell / enuyous Achylles
To his knights / called Myrundones
Upon Troylus / began him to complain
Besechynge them / for to do their pain
Again this Troylus / in the field that day
To catch him / at myschefe / if they may
And besely to do / their dilligence
On him to have / their full aduertence
By one assent / where so that he ride
All other thing / for to set aside
And of naught else / for to take heed
Saufe finally / again him to proceed
If they might / catch him in a trappe
Within them self / troylous for to clappe
To enclose / and set him round about
In all wise / that he go not out
And when he were / beset among them all
Not to slay him / what so ever fall
But thorugh their might / ma^ly him co^serue
Till he him self come / and make him sterue
With his sword / he and none other wight
Loo / here a manhood / for to preyse a right
Vengeance of death / of rancoure and of pride
Compassyd treason / knyghthode laid aside
Worthynesse / by envy slawe
Falshede a lofte / trauthe a back ydrawe
Alas in arms / that he should fall
Of Trecherye / there the bitter galle
Should in this world / many knight befou^de
That be to trauthe / of they order bound
Alas / alas / for now this Achylles
Conspyred has / with his Myrundones
The death of one / the worthyest wight
That ever was / and the best knight
Alas for woe / my heart I feel deed
For his sake / this storye when I read
But when Fortune / has a thing ordained
Though it be ever / wayled and compleyned
There is no gain / nor no remedy
Though men on it / galen aye and cry
I can no more / touching this matere
But write forth / like as ye shall here
How Myrundones / have their lord behyght
With all their power / and their full might
To fulfill / his commandment
And into field / with greeks they be went
But Troylus first / in the opposyte
Of very knyghthode / has so great delight
Without abode / manly them to mete
He was ybrent / with so fervent hete
Of hardynesse / and of hye courage
Of worthynesse / and of vasselage
That him ne list / no longer to abide
But with his folk / in began to ride
Among greeks / this folk of hye renown
And with his sword / he wou^deth and bears down
Sleeth and kylleth / upon every halue
So mortally / that there may no salve
Their sorys sound / for there was but death
Where so he rode / and yeldynge up the breath
So furyously / he began them enchace
And made them lose / in a little space
Their land echone / and before him flee
In troylus sword / there was such crueltee
That maugre them / he the field has won
The same time / when the bright son
Hye in the southe / at mydday mark shoone
Even at the hour / when it drew to noone
When Myrundones / gadred all in one
In compass wise / round about him gone
And furyously / of one entencyowne
They made a cercle / about him enuyrowne
When they saw him / of help desolate
But he of heart / not disconsolate
Upon no side / thorugh his manlyhede
Like a Lion / took of them no head
But thorugh his famous / knyghtly excellence
As a Tygre / stondeth at diffence
And manfully / began them to encoumbre
And began to less / and discrease their noumbre
And some he maymeth / and wounds to y^ death
And some he made / to yield up the brethe
And some he laid / to the earth low
And some he made / for to overthrow
With his sword / of their blood all wete
At great myschefe / under his horse fete
Upon his stead / sturdy as a wall
This worthy knight / this man most marcyall
Plays his pley / among Myrundones
Him self god wot / alone / all helpeles
But tho alas / what might his force avail
When three thousand / knights / him assail
On every part / both in length and bread
And cowardly / first they slew his stead
With their sperys / sharp and quare ground
For which alas / he stante now on the ground
Without reskus / refute or socoure
That was that day / of Chyualrye flower
But welawaye / they have him so beset
That from his head / they smote his basenet
And brake his harneys / as they him assail
And severe of stele / the mighty strong mayle
He was disarmed / both neck and head
Alas the while / and no wight took none head
Of all his knights / longing to the town
And yet always / this Troyan Champyowne
In knyghtly wise / naked as he was
Him self diffendeth / till Achylles alas
Came riding in / Furyous and wode
And when he saw / how troylus stood
Of long fighting / awaped and amate
And from his folk / alone desolate
Sole by him self / at myschefe pyteously
This Achylles / wonder cruelly
Behind unawarely / or that he took head
With his sword / smyteth of his head
And cast it forth / of cruel cursyd heart
And thought platly / it should him not asterte
To show his malys / this wolf vnmercyable
Full vnknyghtly / to be more vengeable
Upon the body / that lay deed and cold
Alas / that ever / it should of knight be told
Write or rehersyd / to do so foul a deed
Or in a book / alas that men shall read
Of any knight / a storye so horrible
Unto the erys / passyngly odyble
For this Achylles / of cruelte alas
The deed corpse / took out of the taas
And vengeably / bond it as I find
At the tail / of his horse behind
And hatefully / that every wight beheld
Drew it him self / endelonge the field
Thorugh the renges / and the wards all
But O alas / that ever it should fall
A knight to be / in heart so cruel
Or of hatrede / so despytous fell
To draw a man / after he were deed
O Thou Omer / for shame be now read
And be astoned / y^ hold thy self so wise
On Achylles / to set such a pryse
In thy books / for his Chyualrye
Above echone / do him magnefye
That was so sleyghty / and so full of fraud
Why gyuest thou him / so hye a pryse and laud
Certys Omer / for all thine excellence
Of Rethoryke / and of Eloquence
Thy lusty songs / and thy dytees smerte
Thy honey mouth / that does with sugre flete
Yet in one thing / thou greatly art to blame
Causeles / to give him such a name
With a title / of Tryumphe and glory
So passyngly / put him in memory
In thy books / to say and write so
Through his knyghthod / he slew Ectorys two
First him that was / like unto none other
And troylus after / yt was his own brother
If thou art meued / of affection
Which that thou haste / to greeks nacyon
To preyse him so / for thou canste endyte
Thou should aye / for any favor write
The truth / plainly / and be indifferent
And say the sothe / clearly of intent
For when he slew / Ector in the field
He was before / disarmed / of his shield
And besy eke / in spoylynge of a king
For if he had / beware of his coming
He had him quyt / thorugh his Chyualrye
His false deseyt / and his Trecherye
That he ne had / so lightly from him gone
Troylus also / was naked and alone
Amyd three thousand / closyd and beshet
When Achylles / has his head of smet
At his back / of full cruel heart
When he nothing / his treason did aduerte
Was that a deed / of a manly knight
To slay a man / forweryed in fight
Faint of travail / all the long day
Among so many / stondynge at a bay
A kings sone / and so hye borne
Naked the head / his armure all to torn
Even at the death / on the self point
At disauauntage / and plainly out of joint
Of his life / standing on the wrake
When Achylles / came falsely at the bake
Assaylynge him / when he was half deed
And like a cowarde / smote of than his head
That was tofore / hurt / and wounded sore
Wherefore Omer / preyse him now no more
Late not his pryse / thy ryall book difface

But in all haste / his renown out arrace
For his name / when I here neuen
Verily / up unto the heaven
As seems me / infecte is the air
The sown thereof / so foul is and vufayre
For if that he had had / his aduertence
Outher the eye / of his prouydence
Unto knyghthode / or to worthynesse
Outher to manhood / or to gentyllesse
Or to the renown / of his own name
Or to the report / of his knyghtly fame
In any wise / to have taken head
He had never done / so foul a deed
So vengeably / for to have ydrawe
A kings sone / after he was slawe
And namely him / that was so good a knight
Which in his time / who so look a right
Passed Achylles / I dare it well express
Both of manhood / and of gentyllesse
But for all that / he is now deed alas
The death of whom / when Pollydamas
And Paris eke / did first espy
They fared in sothe / as they would dye
And specially / with face deed and fade
Paris alas / such sorrow made
For the constreynt / of his dedely woe
When he saw / that troylus was ago
And that he shall / never alive him se
Such sorrow also / the troyan dau^z Enee
For him has made / and many another mo
And all attones / they togydre go
The deed corpse / to recure if they may
But Greeks werre / so fell on them that day
That their labor / was utterly in vain
In any wise / the corpse to get again
Till that Menon / the noble worthy king
Which loved troylus / over all thing
Caughte such routhe / of affection
That he in haste / fearser than a lion
On his death cast / him to be wreke
And first for Ire / thus he began to speak
To Achylles / for his hye treasowne
O thou Traytoure / O thou Scorpyowne
O thou Serpent / full of Trecherye
Which in dishonor / of all Chyualrye
Thorugh false engyne / haste this day yslawe
One of the best / that had no felawe
When he was / in this world a live
Alas alas / who may a right descryue
Thy venym hid / thy malice and untruth
Without pity / or vnknyghtly routhe
To draw a knight / so gentle and so good
A kings sone / of so worthy blood
Thorugh out y^ field / at thy hros tail behind
That ever after / it shall be in mind
This cruel deed / and vngentyllesse
And with yt word / Menon began him dress
Toward Achylles / without more areste
And with a spear / smet him in the breast
Enuyously / of so great hatrede
That he uneath / kept him on his stead
And Menon after / pulled out aswerde
And cast him manly / to mete him in the berde
And rode to him / fully deuoyde of dread
And such a wound / he gave him on the head
That maugre him / in many man's syghte
To the earth / he made him to a light
For all his pride / in a mortal trance
For of that wound / he felt such greuaunce
That at the death / he lay an huge while
In a swowne / the space of half a mile
Till Myrundones / assembled into one
With great labor / hente him up anon
Full deedly pale / so he began to blede
But for all that / they set him on his stead
And at the last / his heart he caught again
And smet his horse / of hate and hye disdain
And toward Menon / fast began him hye
But when that he / his coming began espy
Full like a knight / list not to abide
But hit his horse / sharply in the side
And met Achylles / proudely on the plain
And with their swerdes / they togydre layne
And began to hurtle / on horsbacke yfere
With heart enuyous / and despytous chere
But king Menon / was at advantage
Of Achylles / for all his wode rage
In point to abrought him / to confusyowne
Till the wards / of new come down
On outher part / both here and yonder
Which sodaynely / severed them a sonder
And as the storye / tells plainly than
Began the slaughter / of many manly man
For nouther party / the field ne would leave
Of very pride / till it drew to eve
That Phoebus / began assuage of his hete
And began to bathe / in the wawes wete
His bright bemys / of the Occyan
That fro the field / home goth every man
To their lodging / and after seven days
They faughte yfere / and made no delays
Full mortal / by cruel adventure
While Achylles / besy was to cure
His wounds grene / and his sores sound
And than he has / a new treson found
To be vengyd / upon king Menon
For all his wit / he set thereupon
And so this cruel / enuyous Achylles
I charged has / his Myrundones
Worthy Menon / among them to enbrace
If they him found / in opportune place
With all their might / and their besy thought
From their hondes / that he escape naught
Till he him self / auengyd on him be
And so befell / as they Menon se
The next morrow / like a manly knight
Again the Greeks / armed for to fight
On Troy side / as he was wont to do
Of adventure / that day it fylle so
That Achylles / and this Menon met
And each of them / began on other set
On horse back / of full great envy
And so long in their / melancolye
Mine Auctor wryt / they togydre fight
That each made other / of force to a light
And when Menon / stood upon the ground
Myrundones / went abounte him round
As they were charged / of the fyerse Achylle
When he allas / without gods will
Dysseuered was / from his knights all
And at myschefe / they upon him fall
Destytute alone / and helples
And in such point / slew him Achylles
But in the storye / like as it is found
This Menon / first gave him such a wound
Tofore his death / in all this fell strife
That he dispeyred / was plainly of his life
This Achylles / for all his false treson
Take heed Omer / and deem in thy reason
The false fraud / and the sleyghty gyle
The treson cast before / with many wyle
Of Achylles / and Judge now a right
If ever he slew / any worthy knight
But it were / by prodycyon
Record I take / of the king Menon
So that the tytyle / of his laud alas
Entryked is with fraud / and with fallas
That thou Omer / may with no color
Though thou paynte / with gold and with asoure
In thy writing / his venym not enclose
But as the thorn / hyd under the rose
Whose malys aye / dares by the rote
Though the flower / above fair and sote
That men the fraud / under may not se
Of his treson / ye get no more of me.
BUt I will tell / how greeks do that day
How Meneste / and king Menelay
Dyomede / and Thelamonyus
On Troyans / were passing despytous
For cruelly / with their wards all
In their myschefe / be upon them fall
And made them flee / home unto the town
For whylom / troylus / y^ was their cha^pyowne
Is deed alas / and has them now forsake
Of whom they have / the deed body take
The same day / with great diffyculte
And dolefully / into the Cite
They have it brought / cryeng often alas
And for his death / such a woo there was
That I trow / there is no man a live
Which could a right / halfdele descryue
Their pyteous woe / nor lamentacyowne
Certeyse / not Boys / that had such renown
With drery words / to be weep and cry
In complaining / to Phylosophye
Thorugh his book / accusynge aye Fortune
That selde or naught / can in one contune
She is so full / of transmutacyowne
O: stace of Thebes / make no boste nor sown
Of drerynesse / for to write at all
Nouther of death / nor festes funeral
Of making sorrow / nor aduersyte
Let be thy weeping / o thou Nyobe
Y^e suster also / of Mellenger
That custom have / for to fle so fer
Fro year to year / your brother to complain
And thou that weptest / out thyn Eyes twain
Edippus king / of Thebes the Cite
Thou woeful Myrre / and Calixtone
That so well can / in rage you bemene
And Dydo eke / of Cartage queen
Let be your dole / and contrycyon
And Phyllys eke / for thy Demophon
And Ecto eke / that new do begin
To cry and wayle / and also thou Corynne
That whylom were / in so great affray
For death oonly / of thy Popyngay
As in his book / tells us Duyde
Let all this woo / now be laid aside
And make of it / no comparysowne
Unto the woo / that was in Troy town
For death oonly / of this worthy knight
For love of whom / every manner wight
Hye and low / old and young of age
Are fall of new / into such a rage
That they could / of their woe / none end
Whose salt terys / will their eyes shende
So pyteous was / the lamentacyowne
In every street / thorugh out all the town
Alas who could / all their sorrows tell
I trow certeys / Pluto deep in hell
For all his tourment / and his pains kene
Nouther she / Proserpyna his queen
Nouther the weary / wood Tycyus
Ixyon / nor hungry Tantalus
Ne could not / for all their bitter pain
So furyously weep / and complain
As do troyans / Troylus for thy sake
For who can now / such a sorrow make
Or who can weep / as king Pryamus
Who wepeth now / with face full pyteous
Or makes sorrow / but Eccuba the queen
Who wepeth now / but fair Polycene
Who wepeth now / but Paris and Eleyne
Who can now weep / or unto terys reyne
As do Troyans / with dedely swolle chere
It neded them / no wepers / for to here
They had enough / of their own store
Alas for now / they be for evermore
Of help all sole / of comfort destytute
For who shall now / be to them refute
Now that Ector / and also Dephebus
And troylus eke / that was so virtuous
Be deed alas / who shall their socoure be
Or sustene / the werre of their Cite
There is no more / in conclusyon
But after death / fully destruccyon
Of their toures / and their walls strong
In this matter / what should I plain long
It vayleth not / always so to morn
Wherefore / I will now again return
To my matter / and tell how the king
To greeks has / without more tariynge
For a trewes / and a peace Ysent
A certain time / by great auysement
Which granted was / of Agamenowne
And wha^ they anon were / repeyred to y^ town
How Paris slew Achylles in the Temple of Appollo / and Anthylogus duke
Nestors sone Capitulo. xxxij.
BYnge Pryamus / did his besy cure
For to make / a rich sepulture
For Troylus corpse / full noble and ryall
As says Guydo / of stones and metal
And him enclosed / of great affection
And nigh beside / was the king Menon
Solempnely / buried / and ygraue
And after that day / by day / they have
Like the custom / of Festes funeral
And other Rytis / cerymonyall
For them both / with dew obseruaunce
Seruyse done / by contynuaunce
In their Temple / like as was the guyse
Which were to long / me for to deuyse
And Tedyus / eke for you to dwell
But I purpose / ceryously to tell
How Eccuba / as I can endyte
Her cast fully / Achylles to quyte
His Tyranny / sothely if she may
And unto her / she calls on a day
Alysaunder / in full secret wise
And unto him / as I shall deuyse
With weeping eyes / and full heavy chere
Said even thus / like as ye shall here
Paris quod she / alas saufe gods will
Thou know well / how the fyerse Achylle
My sons has slain / nigh echone
There is none left / but thy self alone
He has me made / alas there is no gain
Full cowardly / of children now barayne
Both of Ector / and Troylus eke thereto
Which were to me / in every trouble and woe
Fully comfort / plesaunce / and solace
Wherefore I cast / plainly to compace
By some engyne / his death to ordain
And like as he / by treason did his pain
Traitorously / with his sword to smite
Right so I think / with treason him to quyte
As sytrynge is / of right and equity
And sithe thou wotest / platly how that he
Has set his heart / and his love clean
Oonly on my daughter / young Polycene
To fine oonly / to have her to wyue
For which I cast / to him send blyue
For to come / and treat of that matere
In the Temple / of Appollo here
In the Temple / most chief of this Cite
Which time / my will is that thou be
Thy self armed / there full pryuelye
With certain knights / in thy company
Armed also / again the same day
That in no wise / he escape not away
From your hands / but that he be deed
As I have said / and therefore take good head
Unto this thing / with all my heart I preye
Fro point to point / bidding to obey
And he assenteth / with all his hole heart
Behotynge her / he should not asterte
And with him took / twenty and no mo
Of manly men / that well durst do
And in the Temple / by full good aduys
They were Yhyd / by bidding of Paris
While Eccuba / covert in her intent
Her messager / to Achylles has sent
As ye have herd / in conclusyowne
To come in haste / unto Troy town
After the effect / was of her message
Oonly to treat / for a marriage
And he in haste / comes at her sonde
As he that could / no thing vnders^onde
Her treason hyd / nor plainly it aduerte
He was so hot / marked in his heart
With ^oues bronde / and his fiery glede
Oflyfe nor death / that he took no head
But set aside / wit and all reason
To cast before / by good discrecyon
What was to do / with lokynge full prudent
But he in sothe / was with love blent
Into Troy / when he should gone
Like as it fares / of lovers euerychone
When they have caught / in heart a fantasye
For no peril / though they should dye
They have no might / nor power to be war
Till they unawarely / be trapped in the snare
Their maladye / is so furyous
And thus Achylles / and Anthylogus
Nestors sone / have the way nome
Toward the town / and be togydre come
Into Temple / as ye have herd me tell
And Paris tho / list no longer dwell
But all unawarely / with his knights all
On Achylles / is at myschefe fall
Eueryche of them / with a sword full bright
And some books say / it was by night
When his death / long before desired
By Eccuba and Paris / was conspyred
But Achylles / in this mortal caas
Among them all / naked as he was
Hent out a sword / in the self steven
And like a knight / he slew of them seven
Of very force / maugre all their might
But when Paris / thereof had a sight
Three darts raughte / that were kene and square
And sodaynely / are that he was ware
Full secretly / hyd under the shade
Markynge at him / and no noise made
Cast at him / even as ever he can
That head and shafte / thorugh his body ran
And therewith all / knights not a few
With sharp swerdes / began upon him hew
And left him not / till he lay at ground
Full pale deed / with many mortal wound
And rightfully / of reason as it sit
Thus was the fraud / and the falshed quyt
Of Achylles / for his hye treason
As death / for death / his skylfully guerdon
And egall mede / without any fable
To them that be / mercyles vengeable
For thylke day / Guydo writes thus
That Achylles / and Anthylogus
Of Paris were / in the Temple yslawe
And afterward / the body was out draw
Of Achylle / fro the holy bounds
And cruelly / thrown / unto hounds
To be devoured / in the broad street
The canell rennynge / with his wawes wete
Without pity / or any manner routhe
Lo here the end / of falshede and untruth
Lo here the fine / of such Trecherye
Of false deceyt / compassyd by envy
Lo here the knotte / and conclusyon
How god quyt aye / slaughtre by treason
Lo here the guerdon / and the fynall mede
Of them / that so delight / in falshede
For every thing / platly for to said
Like as it is / his guerdon does attain
As ye may se / of this Achylles
Which on a night / in the Temple les
His life / for he was aye customable
By fraud and treason / for to be vengeable.
But it befell / at request of Eleyne
That the bodies / of these ylke tweyne
Conserved were / from the hungry rage
Of best and foul / gredy and ramage
And yet they lay / amyddes the Cite
Full openly / that men might them se
To great gladness / of them of the town
Into time / that Agamenowne
To king Pryam / sent his massagerys
To have Lysence / to fette them home on berys
By grant of whom / they have the corsys take
For whom Greeks / such a sorrow make
That pity was / and routhe for to here
And eueryche spoke / thus unto his fere
Farewell our trust / now Achylles is deed
Farewell our hope / and hoolly all our speed
Farewell our joy / and our chief diffence
That had in manhood / so great excellence
Farewell alas / our soueraygne assurance
Farewell in knyghthod / all our suffisaunce
For now alas / unlikely is that we
Shall ever win / or get this Cite
To us alas / so froward is Fortune
But for that they / might not contune
Always in woe / nor in pain endure
They made have / a rich Sepulture
To Achylles / of stones precious
And another / to Anthylogus
What should I now / any longer dwell
Ceryously / the rytes for to tell
Of their buriynge / nor what woe they make
Their weeping all / nor of their clothes blake
Nor how that some / loure in their hode
And how some go / with milk and blood
With doleful heart / and into fire it shete
And how other / cast go^mys sweet
Amyd the great / flaumbe funeral
Nor of the plays / called pallestrall^
Nor the wrastlynge / that was at the wake
It were but vain / me to undertake
To tell all / wherefore I let be
Fully in purpose / like as ye shall se
To resort / in conclusyon
To tell / how the great Agamenon
For his Lords / in all haste has sent
And when they were / assembled in his tent
Full prudently / this king this manly man
With great advise / thus his tale began.
SYres quod he / Fortunes varyaunce
Her chere froward / and double cou^tenau^ce
And sudden Turn / of her false vysage
Your hertes has / put in such arage
For the murdre / to god and man odyble
Of Achylles cruel / and the death horrible
By compassynge / of Eccuba the queen
Now seems me / that it shall be seen
If any manhood / in your hertes be
Or knyghtly force / in aduersyte
For to endure / by virtue of suffraunce
Till of his death / ye take may vengaunce
And manly quyte / this outragyous offense
When time comes / to make recompense
But sith that ye / be manly and prudent
I would first / se the plain intent
In this matter / of you that be so wise
Hereupon / what is your advise
By one assente / and voice in comune
Where that ye will / the werre forth contune
And the sege ygonne / upon this town
Till they be brought / to destruccyowne
Or into Greece / now resort again
For cause oonly / that Achylles is slain
That whylom was / your strong Cha^pyowne
Your diffence / and proteccyowne
But finally / now that he is deed
Hereupon / let se what is your read
Say openly / and no longer tarry
And some anon / gonne for to varye
And to grutche / casting to and fro
Stondynge in doubt / what were best to do
And some said / on the the other side
For life or death / they would an end abide
And some of them / that of wit were rude
For their party / gonne to conclude
That they would home / again return
And other said / that they will soiourne
Still at the sege / hap what hap may
And thus they treat / all the long day
Every man / like his oppynyon
Till at the last / in conclusyon
They be accorded / fully into one
Fro the sege / never for to gone
Unto the time / they have of the town
Thorugh their knyghthode / full possessyon
At their fce will / to spylle and to save
All be Achylles / was buried and ygraue
For the trust / of every worthy knight
Was finally / as gods have behyght
That they in haste / shall the town possede
This was the hope / fully deuoyde of dread
Vndispeyred / in their oppynyon
And than anon / Ayax Thelamon
A worthy knight / and famous of his hand
Among all tho / of the Greeks land
Said even thus / plainly in sentence
Syres quod he / that be here in presence
My counsel is / platly and my read
Now it stands so / that Achylles is deed
For his sone / in all haste to send
Hyder to come / for to se an end
Of the sege / and help us in this need
Which now abyt / with king Lycomede
His bysayel / and named is Pirrus
And some him call / Neptolonyus
Right lusty fresshe / and by lyklynesse
Able to attain / to great worthynesse
As by report / and the fame is kouthe
If he draw him / to arms in his youth
And sothfastly / but if books lie
As I have read / and herd by prophecye
That finally / Troy the Cite
Without him / shall never won be
Thus books say / that be of old memory
And how greeks / shall have no victory
Till he come / this sone of Achylles
Wherefore in haste / and be not reckeles
Send for him / that it be done anon
And they commend / his counsel euerychone
And to his read / fully them assente
And by advise / full prudently they sent
In all haste / on this embassyat
The wise king / full famous of estat
I mean the prudent / noble Menelay
And forth he goth / the self same day
And on his journey / began him fast speed
Till that he came / unto Lycomede
The old king / as ye have herd me tell
Wherefore a time / I will leave him dwell
And to Greeks / in the mean while
So as I can direct again my style.
How Paris and Thelamon Ayax slew each other in the field. Capitulo. xxxiij.

THe time of year / when the shene son
In the Crabbe / had his course yronne
To the highest / of his Ascencyon
Which called is / the somer stacyon
When the virtue / out of every root
Is drawn up / and the bawme soote
Into the crop / and the fresshe flower
Most lusty is / of hew and of color
Till Phoebus chare / in his descencyon
Out of the Crabbe / toward the Lion
Holds his course / in the firmament
I mean when / he is retrogradyent
And dries up / the moisture and the wete
Of herb and flower / with his fervent hete
And all that veer / before him made grene
To white he tourneth / with his bemys shene
Both sede and grain / by decoccyon
For naturelly / by digestyon
That first was raw / in fruytes and in flowers
And watery eke / by plente of humors
He dries up / and rypeth at the fulle
With his feruence / that men may them pulle
Each in his kind / after the season
Fro year to year / by reuolucyon
On their branches / fresshely as they sprede
When that Cheryes / powbly be and read
First in June / that seweth after May
When the hoote / merry summers day
No dwery is / but like a geaunt long
The same time / greeks stout and strong
With rancour brent / of their enuyous hete
Have shapen them / with their foon to mete
And bright armed / into field they go
And they of Troy / out of the town also
And their wards / ordained euerychone
The field have take / to mete with their foon
And began to assemble / upon outher side
But Thelamon / of folly and of pride
The same day / of him as I read
As he that had / of his death no dread
Disarmed was / for battle of arest
Of mayle and plate / bare upon his breast
For of folly / and surquedous outrage
Bare his head / and bare eke his vysage
And bare also / without basenet
And naked eke / of vyser and palet
Herod all day / of no thing aferde
Having no wepen / but a naked sword
For wylfully / he left at home his shield
And his spear / when he took the field
Full like a knight / sitting on his stead
And after him / follows Dyomede
Like Mars him self / about him his meyne
And fast by / came duke Meneste
King vlyxes / and Agamenon
ANd Pryamus / with them of troy town
Took eke the field / with a full heavy chere
For he was both ferefull / and in were
In great dispeyre / and inly full of dread
To issue out / now Ector was deed
Worthy Troylus / and also Dephebus
For in him self / he demyd plainly thus
That he was feblyd / greatly of his might
After their death / with greeks for to fight
But out he goth / hap what hap may
And Paris eke / full knyghtly of array
King Phylymene / and Pollydamas
Worthy Esdre / and with them Eneas
By one assent / there is no more to seye
The same day / knyghtly live or deye
In their diffence / and utterly Iuparte
As gods list / the field to depart
And proudely first / the greeks they began perce
And Paris tho / with them that were of Perce
Fill in aside / with the son shene
And his archerys / with arrows square and kene
The greeks began / a^ondre to disseuere
For in the field / they might not perseuer^
Oonly for shot / of the strong archerys
Of Perce land / and the Arbalasterys
Which made them fle / right of very need
Into time / that proud Dyomede
When he of greeks / saw this sudden flight
Them to releue / like a manly knight
Is come upon / felly in his tene
And first of all / he set on Phylyment
A worthy king / that came on Troy side
The which again / began at him to ride
That Dyomede / has but little won
With swerdes styffe / as they togydre run
That to behold / it was a noble sight
How each of them / quyte him like a knight
As they togydre / ran on horse back
That no man could / in nouther se no lack
But ever in one / Troyans were so fell
Upon greeks / that they ne might dwell
To keep their land / so they made them blede
Maugre the force / of this Dyomede
The slaughter was / so hydous and so strong
That thorugh y^ field / the woeful noise ronge
And mortal cry / of wounded folk that lay
Slain on the soyel / endelonge the way.
Till Meneste / sitting on his stead
The worthy duke / began to take heed
In what myschefe / greeks were beset
And hent anon / a spear sharp whet
Smiting his horse / felly in the side
And thorugh to renges / knyghtly he began ride
And stynt not / so furyous he was
Till that he met / with Pollydamas
A Troyan knight / and a manly man
And unawarely / at him as he ran
He hytte him so / in many man's sight
To the earth / that he made him light
And with a sword / at ground when he lay
He had him slain / the sylfe same day
In his rage / and his cruel tene
Ne had oonly be / that king Phylymene
Had him reskewed / in this adventure
Which so frendely / for him did his cure
Maugre the might / of this Menestee
From his hands / that he went free
All for bathyd / and be spreynt with blood
And all this while / Ayax proudely rode
Of surquedy / and of wylfulnesse
Of folly rage / and foul hardynesse
Nakyd his body / head and euerydele
Amyd his foon / armed bright in steel
And of Troyans / such a slanghter made
That they lay deed / both in son and shade
Thorugh out the field / where this Thelamon
Among them rode / woodder than a lion
That troyan none / might him tho wtstonde
While that he held / his blody sword in hand
That wonder was / nakyd as he rode
Without wound / that he so long abode
And as Guydo / makes rehersayle
And writes eke / for a great marvel
That he vnslayne / might so contune
But when a thing / is shapen of fortune
It might befalle / what ever thing it be
In well or woe / joy or aduersyte
When one shall dye / or when he shall escape
But she alas / can alder first by iape
And bring aman / unawarely to myschaunce
When he best weneth / to have assurance
In this lady / of transmutacyon
Like as it fill / of worthy Thelamon
This same day / which of folly pride
Among his foon / began so fer to ride
Ylyche fresshe / right as he began
And slew of Perce / many a manly man
And of him self / took no manner head
His knyghtly heart / so void was of dread
Till Paris saw / his great hardynesse
And how that he / his knights did oppress
Enchasynge them / so mortally and narowe
Without abode / anon he took an arowe
Entoxycat / sharp and venymous
And in this Ire / fell and despytous
And shot at him / in the self tide
As says Guydo / and smet him thorugh y^ side
That of that hurt / there is no more to ^eye
He felt well / that he must deye
And when he saw / none other remedy
Forth he rode / supprysed with envy
Thorugh out y^ prees / his sword ay i^ his hand
Into time / that he Paris fond
And unto him / with a pale chere
He said thus anon / as ye shall here
Paris quod he / as this mortal wound
Of thine arrowe / sharp and square ygrounde
Has finally / my life put in dispeyre
Never into Greece / for to have repeyre
Right so shall I / by short conclusyowne
Away shape / that into Troy town
With thy life / thou enter shall no more
At my heart / the venym byt so sore
That other gain / is there none but death
But yet tofore / or I yield up the breath
Trust me right well / there may be no socoure
That thou shall first / be my predecessoure
And go before / deep down to hell
There with Pluto / eternally to dwell
So as of right / it is necessary
The time is set / which may not tarry
And my truth / for morgage in depose
That in all haste / I shall make a deuose
Atwyxe the / and the queen Eleyne
And twynne asondre / eke the false theyne
Which lynked was / by color of wedlock
And has so long / be shet under lock
Oonly by fraud / and false engyne also
But now the knotte / shall be broke a two
With my right hand / the truth to darayne
For thorugh the cause / oonly of you twain
In this werre / many worthy knight
His life has lost / and many another wight
On outher side / for your both sake
But of all this / I shall an end make
Of your love / and foul auoutrye
For finally / Paris thou shall dye
Of my hands / as it is thy chance
And with yt word / his sword he began enhau^ce
Above his head / and smote him in the face
That he fill deed / in the self place
For his head / he partyd has on twain
And right forth with / there is no more to said
Ayax alas / of his mortal wound
Fill deed also gruflynge / unto the ground
Full pyteously / and than they of Troy
Have Paris take / up out of the weye
And bore him home / into their cytee
But Dyomede / and duke Menestee
With many greek / riding enuyrowne
Sewed the chase / even to the town
But for cause / Tytan / began to low
Down by the arc / of his days bow
For into west / under the rows read
And Esperus / began his light to shede
This to say / for it drew to night
The greeks be / repeyred anon right
Eueryche of them / to his lodging place
To take their rest / all that nyghtes space
Save as I read / that Agamenowne
The Greeks made / fast by the town
To set their tents / and Papyllyons
Habytacles / and new mansyons
Of very pride / fast by the wall
And they of Troy / dispeyred ouerall
No refute could / greeks for to let
But of assent / fast their gates shette
And all the night / on the walls wake
And over this / such a woe they make
Thorugh the Cite / that Paris was so deed
For finally / now they can no read
But weep and cry / and sorrow ever in one
NOw all y^ sons / of Pryamus were gone
Fortune alas / has them so appeyred
That of their life / they be dispeyred
Of all hope / and of good welfare
Perpetuelly / for to live in care
Unto the death / and that was fast bye
For now there is / no manner remedy
Upon no side / nor refute none at all
But them to keep / close within the wall
That for to se / it was a pyteous thing
And such a woe / makes now the king
For Paris death / that for deedly smerte
Him thought platly / that his sorrowful heart
Recurles / would ryue a tweyne
And into terys / he began still and reyne
As he would / for very sorrow deye
And of the queen / alas what shall I seye
Eccuba / his own mother dear
That cries / wepeth / with a woeful chere
Of Polycene / that was so woe begone
And of his susterne / also euerychone
That have their here / and their clothes torn
As they had / their own death ysworne
For drery woo / and for pyteous pain
But forby all / the fair queen Eleyne
Wayleth / cries / with a deedly there
That her eyes / which whylom were so clear
For dyrked were / with doleful terys smerte
And to the corpse / sodaynely she sterte
And clyppyd it / in her arms twain
And pyteously / enbrace it and restrain
Like as she would / with him dye anon
For still she lay / dombe as any stone
As marbyll cold / her lymes Craumpysshynge
Ready at all / toward her buriynge
Till men by force / from the corpse her hent
And she her here / and his chekes rent
As she were / fallen in a rage
That changed was / alas in her vysage
Her natyfe color / and her rody hew
Whylom as fresshe / as any rose new
Now is she like / unto ashes cold
And with her hands / aye togydre fold
Her self she smote / on her pale face
And ever among / the corpse she did embrace
In her swownes / as she fill to ground
Twenty times / and wept full his wound
With woe she was / so wapyd and amate
Of all comfort / alas disconsolate
In heart being / inly desirous
Thorugh her rage / passing Furyous
To dye attones / with her own knight
For toward death / enclosyd was her sight
As she that list / to live now no more
And I trow / that never man before
No woman saw / fall in such distress
In such disioynt / of deedly heaviness
Nor for no woe / so pyteously yraue
Not Cleopatre / going to her grave
Nor woeful Tesbe / that fro the kaue sterte
When she her self / smote unto the heart.
Nor the faithful / true Orestylle
When that she saw / her lord again her will
Marcus Prolancus / unto ship gone
And for his love / fill down deed anon
Nor the sorrow / of true Iulia
Nor the feruence / of faithful Porcia
Or which the one / fill deed sodaynely
For she saw blood / speynt so cruelly
On her lords / dredefull grauement
And Porcia / so true in her intent
When that her lord / Brutus lost his life
For because / she might have no knyfe
With colys read / slew her self alas
Was not also / in the self caas
Arthemysya / queen of Tarse land
Of Mansalus / the grave when she fond
Her own knight / of whose bones small
Full woefully / and with a chere right pale
She poudre made / and drank it every morrow
But all the woe / and the furyous sorrow
Of these echone / yet may not atteyne
Unto the sorrow / of the queen Eleyne
That finally / will her self for do
For Paris sake / whom she loved so
For after him / she will not live a day
But be a wreke / plainly if she may
Upon her life / rather than disseuere
And thus in woe / aye she does persevere
In her heart / Paris sat so deep
Alas who says / that women can not we
This douteles / they have it of nature
Though it so be / that they no woe endure
Yet can they feyne / and salt terys find
Plente enough / of their own kind
And sorowles morn / and complain
I say not this / for the queen Eleyne
That was with woe / wounded to the heart
That fro the death / she wend not asterte
For dethes darte / her heart made ryue
And yet she rose / again fro death to live
Oonly by grace / for all her fell rage
For every woe / by process must aswage
And over gone / and wasted by miracle
For each venym / made is Tryacle
And every woe / has his remedy
For though Eleyne / feign would dye
Her kind ne would / assent yet thereto
So sodaynely / to slay her self for woe
She was a woman / no man should her wit
Me list no more / of her woe endyte
List unto you / that it were Tedyous
To here all / her pains furyous
Her cruel woe / and lamentacyon
Which would meue / to compassyon
In very sothe / to write euerydele
Any heart / though it were made of stele
For king Pryam / and the queen also
Had such couthe / of her pyteous woe
To se her so / weep and complain
That of her / they felt asmoche pain
As they did / almost for Paris
Hereof no more / for Pryam by deuys
After this rage / and this mortal woe
Amyd the Temple / sacryd to Juno
Ordained has / with full besy cure
For the corpse / a rich Sepulture
And in all haste / therein made it shette
That in sothnesse / if I should let
Totelle all / the rytes and the gyse
That there were made / in their paynym wise
And the costs / of his buriynge
It should be / to long a tariynge
Ceryously / thereon to abide
Wherefore as now / I let ouerslyde
Their paynym rytys / supersticyous.
How Pantasyllya / the Queen of Amazone came for to socoure king Pryamus of
Troy And how Pirrus Achylles sone slew her Capitulo. xxxiiij.
ANd tell I will / how king Pryamus
Commanded has / of myschefe and of need
Thorugh troy town / oonly of very dread
To shytte their gates / strongly as they may
And thereupon / both night and day
To keep watch / for shortly they of Troy
Disconsolate / of all their old joy
Can no refute / but weep and sorrow make
For they ne durst / no more undertake
Again Greeks / into field to gone
Till on a day / king Agamenon
His messager / by good auysement
To Pryamus / into Troy has sent
Requerynge him / of manhood like a knight
To issue out / with Greeks for to fight
As he was wont / with his Chyual^ye
But king Pryam / his axynge began deny
And shortly said / to him that was sent
That he ne would / at his assignemenet
Not ones pass / the gates of the town
But at his own / fre eleccyowne
When ever him list / without compellynge
And yet in sothe / cause of his tariynge
Was for the hardy / queen of Femynye
Toward Torye / fast began her hye
Out of her land / and little regyon
The which as books / make mencyon
After the sight / of the firmament
Is in the plage / of the Oryent
And called is / the reygne of Amazonys
Of which the custom / and the use is
That oonly women / therein shall abide
And they are wont / armed for to ride
And have in arms / great experyence
For their labor / and their dylygence
Is finally / to have excercyse
Fro day to day / in Martes hye seruyse
And over more / their custom and vsaunce
As to this day / is made remembrance
Is that no man / shall them nyghe nere
But if it be / three months in the year.
This to say / in June / Apryll and May
And than the women / have in custom aye
Unto an I Will / a little there beside
Where as the men / by them self abide
Fro year to year / togydre euerychone
Unto the men / out of their land to gone
And there abide / in that regyon
Till time comes / of concepcyon
Without tariynge / any longer while
For than anon / home unto their isle
They repeyre / out of that country
Unto time / that they delivered be
And as fast / as the child is borne
For lack of keeping / that it be not lorne
He fostryd is / till three year be agone
Among the women / and than right anon
To the I Will / beside adjacent
Unto the men / the child in haste is sent
If that it be / of kind masculyne
And if it fall / that it be Femynyne
With the women / abide stylle it shall
Till that it be / in acts mercyall
Full well expert / and that she can eke know
To handle a spear / or to draw a bow
Like the statutes / of that Regyon
The which as books / make mencyon
Is set between / Ewrope and Asya
And of this land / was Pantasyllya
Whylom lady / and gouernesse
Full renowned / of strength and hardynesse
Thorugh out the world / both in length and bread
And yet in sothe / to speak of womanhede
For all her might / she had an huge pryse
For both she was / virtuous and wise
Wonder discrete / and had an honest name
Not withstondynge / the excellence of fame
Of her renown / in arms and in glory
For of conquest / and of hye victory
She was most / surmuntynge out of dread
Of any woman / that I can of read
And sothely yet / books bear witness
Of womanhede / and of gentyllesse
She kept her so / that nothing her asterte
The which loved / with all her hole heart
Worthy Ector / and with all her might
Oonly for he was / so noble a knight
That her joy / and worldly plesaunce
Her hertely ease / and soueraygne suffysaunce
In very sothe / where she wake or wynke
Was ever in one / upon him to think
Of very faith / without any slouthe
And unto him / she was by bond of truth
Confederat / of old affeccyowne
That when she herd / how that Troy town
Besegyd was / of the Greeks fell
This hardy queen / list no longer dwell
But hastes her / as fast as ever she may
Toward Troy / in full good array
With all the wrothy / women of her land
Full well expert / and preuyd of their hand
Well horsyd eke / and armed rychely
And as I find / in her company
A thousand maidens / riding by her side
This worthy queen / that durst well abide
She with her brought / in steel armed bright
For love of Ector / her own true knight
And on her way / fast she began her speed
To help him / if she se need
For in no thing / she could her more delight
Than toward him / faithfully her quyte
For that was all / her lust and hertes joy
But when that she / come was to Troy
And herd tell / by relacyowne
That he was deed / most worthy of renown
To whom she was / so loving and so true
Anon she began / to change chere and hew
And pyteously / for to weep and cry
And fared in sothe / as she would dye
For very woe / and hertely heaviness
And thought she would / through her worthynesse
Avenge his death / platly if she may
On the Greeks / and so upon a day
She prays Pryam / with great affeccyowne
For to open / the gates of the town
And to go out / with Greeks for to fight
That they may know / and be expert a right
Of this women / the great worthynesse
And of this queen / the famous hardynesse
And so the king / hoping for the best
Without abode / granted her request
The next morrow / wha^ Phoebus shone full shene
And all tofore / out goth Phylymene
The noble king / with them of Paffagonye
And after him / other knights many
Followed after / with worthy Eneas
The Troyan eke / dau^z Pollydamas
And than the queen / Pantasyllya
By the gate / called / Dardanyca
Toward Greeks / proudely issued out
With her women / riding her about
The which anon / when greeks did espy
Into the field / began them fast hye.
ANd first of all / worthy Meneste
Pantasyllya / when he did se
With his spores / made his stead gone
And with a spear / rode to her anon.
Of whom the queen / astoned never adele
Kaught a spear / that was squaryd well
Round the shafte / and the head well ground
Which as they coupe / smet hy^ down to ground
And maugre him / reuyd him his stead
But than / in haste / in came Dyomede
And cruelly / to the queen ^an ride
And she as fast / on the the other side
Rode eke to him / in plates bright and shene
And as they met / with their sperys kene
She hytte so / this fell Dyomede
For all his might / and his manlyhede
That she him made / his ^adell for to lose
There is no more / he might tho not chese
And in despyte / of his men echone
She has his shield / him berafte anon
And it delyuereth / proudely as she rode
To a maid / that upon her abode
And like a Tygre / in his gredynesse
Or like in soth / to a Lioness
That dayeshe fared / riding up and down
Among the greeks / till that Thelamowne
Began behold the slaughter / that she made
Of hye despyte / and rancourouer lade
As he that might / for Ire not sustene
Began reyne his horse / to fall upon this queen
But when that she / his coming did espy
She fill on him / in her melancolye
So mortally / maugre his knights all
That to the ground / she made him for to fall
And Greeks put / in so great disray
Where ever she rode / all that ylke day
That they might / before her not sustene
And thorugh the help / of king Phylymene
As mine Auctor / records in his book
Amyd the field / Thelamon she took
And sent him forth / thorugh her hye renown
As prisoner / toward Troy town
Till unto reskus / came cruel Dyomede
And cruelly on them / that began him led
He fill un warely / with an huge route
Of his knights / riding him about
And from their hands / maugre al their might
He him delyuereth / like a manly knight
At which time / this hardy queen anon
With her women / about her euerychone
The greeks has / before her on the plain
As wryt Guydo / so mortally belayne
That she them made / of necessyte
Out of the field / with her sword to fle
That verily / it was incredyble
And to leave / a manner impossyble
To se the women / Greeks so enchace
Which might not abide / before their face
Nor in the field / in any wise stand
For they them drive / to the self stronde
Down to the clyffe / of the salt see
And slew of them / so huge great plente
That finally / they had be destroyed
For ever more / and utterly accloyed.
Ne had Dyomede / stand at diffence
And of knyghthode / made resystence
For he that day / in party and in all
For Greeks stood / as a sturdy wall
And was alone / their help and chief socoure
But for all that / with worship and honor
Pantasyllya / as made is memory
Repeyred is / with conquest and victory
With all her women / into Troy town
Upon the hour / of Phoebus going down
And by the side / of this hardy queen
Armed in steel / rode king Phylymene
Whom Pryam has / with great reverence
Knyghtly received / and did his dylygence
Them to refresshe / with every manner thing
That might be / unto their liking
As their hertes / could best deuyse
And after this / in full goodly wise
He thanked has / the noble hardy queen
Of her goodness / that her list to seen
To help him / in his great need
And offrede her / in Guydo as I read
All that he has / Treasour and richesse
Hoping fully / thorugh her worthynesse
Upon Greeks / avenged for to be
And for to keep him / in his Cite
Maugre greeks / which of them say nay
For as I read / after day by day
She stynte not / proudely them to assail
Again whose sword / they might not avail
So mortally she made / their sides blede
Till Menelay / frokynge Lycomede
Repeyred is / with Neptolonyus
Which in his books / called eke Pirrus
Whylom the sone / of cruel Achylles
Whom for to se / full huge was the prees
Of the Greeks / going enuyron
And for he was / by succession
Borne to be heir / of this Achylles
He was received / of Myrundones
With great honor / and great solempnyte
So glad were they / their young lord to se
To whom / echone / they made affyaunce
And were eke sworn / by bond and assurance
For life or death / to him to be true
As his lyeges / and change for no new
To obey his lust / in all manner thing
And after this / Agamenon the king
Made him knight / and Thelamonyus
With a sword / gyrte anon Pirrus
Saying to him / in the self place
With y^ bawdryke / when he him did embrace
Take heed quod he / mine own cosyn dear
To resemble / in manhood and in chere
In knyghthode eke / and in worthynesse
To thy Fader / which in sothfastnesse
In his time / was so noble a knight
And over more / with all thy full might
To avenge his death / that thou do thy pain
And than of greeks / worthy Dukes twain
Full humbly / began down toknele
And set a spore / upon either hele
As was the manner / of gold bornyd bright
And in this wise / Pirrus was made knight
As ye have herd / in full hye presence
With great honor / and due reverence
Like the custom / of the greeks lays
And the ryghtes / used in tho days
And than anon / has Agamenon
With full glad there / and great affection
Delivered him / fully by sentence
The arms hole / without difference
Which Achylles / by his life bare
His worthy Fader / on his shuldres square
As for next heir / of line by descent
And all the Tresour / also and his Tent
Armure and all / delyueryd were anon
Unto Pirrus / and greeks euerychone
Eight days / suynge by and by
Thorugh out the host / full solempnely
They halowe in honor / of this young knight
Till on a morrow / wha^ Phoebus shone full bright
Which with his light / that shyneth fro so far
Diffaced has / the stremys of the sterre
Lucyfer / the days messagere
When greeks began / in plates bright and clear
Enarmed them / that day for sour or sweet
Fully in purpose / with their foon to mete
And manfully / out of their tents wide
Against Troyans / they began to ride
Ward after ward / proudely into field
And Pirrus bare / that day upon his shield
His Faders arms / like as says Guydo
And of the same / he had upon also
A cote armure / that became him well
And forth he rode / armed bright in steel
And casuelly / formest as he was
He met first / with Pollydamas
A knight of Troy / a full manly man
And furyously / Pirrus to him ran
On horse back / with a mighty sword
And began to hurtle / with him in the berde
So myghtely / that in this hateful strife
Pollydamas / had lost his life
Ne had reskus ben / without more tariynge
Of Phylymene / the noble worthy king
Oonly of knyghthode / and of worthynesse
To whom Pirrus / began him dress
With his sword / and smet him in the syghte
That from his horse / he made him to a light
For he the stroke / might not sustene
And sothfastly / this worthy Phylymene
Of Pirrus / had / ytake be anon
Save his knights / assembled into one
Of Paffagonye / came him to rekewe
But Pirrus aye / so fyersly began pursewe
Upon this king / with Myrundones
Beset in myschefe / among the great prees
That many knight / of this noble king
yslayne was / at his reske wynge
He stood of death / in so streyt a caas
Till of Fortune / came Pollydamas
To his reskus / and did his full might
Him to delyuere / and quyte him like a knight
But in sothenesse / there was such resystence
Of Pirrus knights / stondynge at diffence
That aye in myschefe / stood king Phylymene
Till Pantasyllya / of Femynye the queen
With her women / a great company
Began this thing / of adventure espy
Which were echone / for the more delight
On their armure / that day clade in white
That verily / there was no lylye flower
Nor snow / that flaketh fro Iupyters toure
Of whytnesse / fressher on to seen
Than in field / was this hardy queen
Which first of all / among the greeks chees
Proudely to fall / on Myrundones
Among whom / riding up and down
She them on horseth / thorugh her hyerenowne
And slew them / up on every side
Making their renges / for to seu^r wide
Till Thelamon / in a furyous hete
With a spear / un warely did her mete
And in arage / smote her to the plain
But she anon / full lyfely rose again
And with her sword / so marketh Thelamowne
That from his horse / she made hy^ light dow ne
Plat to the ground / on his hands twain
And than her women / did their besy pain
To make their queen / her stead to recure
And all this while / stood in adventure
Of his life / worthy Phylymene
Pirrus knights / were on him so kene
Maugre his men / that they have him take
It geyneth not / diffence for to make
The greeks have / so strongly him beset
And forth they lad him / it might be no bet
Toward their tents / thorugh out all the field
The which thing / when the queen beheld
With her women / that about her rode
Pursued after / without more abode
That finally / they have so after sewed
Thorugh their force / that he was reskewed
Maugre the manhood / of Myrundones
And Pantasyllya / was so mercyles
Upon Greeks / that of necessyte
Thorugh her force / and her cruelte
Before her sword / they durst not abide
But when Pirrus / saw her great pride
To his knights / loud he began to cry
And said it was / shame and vyllanye
For the women / so to lose their land
And to be slain / so felly of her hand
Wherefore echone / your hertes does resume
And of assent / let us now consume
The ^ryde of them / that none away escape
For but if we / some remedy shape
This ylke day / their force to confound
Shameful report / to us shall rebounde
Perpetuelly / where we sleep or wake
And as Pirrus / began his sword to take
Furyously / and with a knyghtly there
This hardy queen / happed to here
All that Pirrus / to his knights spoke
Hirlyste not ones / for to turn bake
Nor of his thret / for to take heed
For platly she / had of him no dread
But right proudely / began to draw nere
And to him said / anon as ye shall here
O thou Pirre / sone of Achylles
That slew Ector / in knyghthode pereles
Thorugh his treynys / and his trecherye
By malys oonly / and by false envy
Unware when he / no thing did aduerte
The which never / may out of my heart
So grene it stycketh / in my remembrance
Upon his death / for to do vengeance
And it sit well / as seems unto me
That his death / be venged upon the
First of all / and on thy Faders blood
For love of him / so gentle and so good
The death of whom / should all y^ world compain
Not oonly men / do their besy pain
To quyte his death / but women eke also
With all their might / help eke thereto
As right requires / without excepcyon
There on to do / full execucyon
And I now stand / in the same plyte
And for thou haste / us women in despyte
Of our power / shortly in sentence
Thou shall in haste / have experyence
And know our force / sothely euerydele
Right in short time / trust me right well
Here in this field / in shedynge of his blood
Wherefore Pirrus / wexed began as wode
As any Tygre / bore / or wood lion
So frat the color / in his complexyon
And in his Ire / fell and despytous
He took a spear / pale and Furyous
And ran at her / with all his might and pain
And again ward / as she that list not feign
Encountrede him / all deuoyde of fere
But Pirrus / first bracke on her his spear
All be that / he might her not remeue
In her sadell / nor but little grieve
But she again / so sore began him hytte
On his stead / that he may not sytte
But descends / endelonge the plain
And up he rose / with full great disdain
And took a sword / in his hand anon
And made his stead / line right to gone
Upon this queen / of passing wortynesse
And inwardely / of hate of woodnesse
In heart yfret / smet at her many stroke
But ever she sat / still as any oak
And of force / in her ire pale
Efte again / she made him to auale
To the earth / maugre all his pain
And thus the fight / lasts of them twain
A large while / till Myrundones
Have take their lord / by force out of the prees
And made him / his horse recure again
And in his time / on the self plain
With his baner / is descendyd down
The worthy king / great Agamenowne
With kings / dukes / endelonge the grene
With their wards / that wonder was to seen
So prudently / in the field batayled
That have Troyans mortally assailed
But tho in haste / the king Phylymene
As ye have herd reskewed / by the queen
When he has thanked / to her worthynesse
With his knights / in he began him dress
And Pantasyllya / assembled both in one
Upon Greeks / began for to gone
Where men may se / with speres sharp ground
Eueryche other / bear unto the ground
There men may se / proudely without lack
The manly knights / run on horse back
And the women / mortally oppress
The fell Greeks / thorugh their hardynesse
Oonly thorugh force / of the mighty queen
That deed they lay / covering all the grene
Wherewith came in / dau^z Pollydamas
Fro death reskewed / and with him Eneas
King Esdras eke / of troy the Cite
And tho the wards / began togydre fle
On either party / fell and furyous
But most of all / Neptolonyus
That Pirrus hyghte / y^ greeks Champyowne
Irous and wood / on them of troy town
Made his sword / in their flesh to byte
And Pantasyllya / proudely her to quyte
Ne spares not / with mortal wounds wide
Greeks to slay / upon every side
Now here now there / to their confusyon
And Pirrus than / is fall on Glawcon
The half brother / to Pollydamas
For Anthenor / eke his Fader was
And Pirrus / so in a cruel ire
With melancolye / new set a fire
Smot Glawcon so / or that he took head
Among the prees / that he fylle down deed
And Pantasyllya / from her women all
The same tide / is on Pirrus fall
And he of her / when he had a sight
Rode unto her / like a manly knight
And as they hurtle / on horse back yfere
Of adventure / with swerdes styffe and clear
Eueryche made / other to alyghte
And hatefully / on foot so they syghte
Long or outher / might of other win
Till they were made / of force for to twynne
By the wards / that went them atwene
I mean Pirrus / and this hardy queen
And all this time / dau^z Pollydamas
So wood for Ire / in his heart was
Amyd Greeks / for his brothers death
That whom he met / for his love he sleth
Without mercy / in his hateful tene
That he alone / and this worthy queen
Such a slaughter / on the greeks make
That they the field / utterly forsake
And began toflee / to their tents down
Till Dyomede / and Ayax Thelamowne
And Pirrus eke / made turn again
But they in sothe / were so ouerlayne
That they ne might / all that day releue
And thus they faughte / till it drew to eve
To most damage / of the greeks side
Till Phoebus began / his bright chare to hyde
Low in the west / and to shroude his light
Under courteyne / of the black night
That either part / thought for the best
To depart / and draw to their rest
And took their ease / that night as they may
And all the month / suynge day by day
Without / any interrupcyon
They faught yfere / albe no mencyon
Be made thereof / nor write in special
Of no person / but in general
Who that ever / did evil or well
In Troy book / I find never adele
Save the queen / like as wryt Guydo
Of her women / an hundred has forgo
That slain were / thylke month day
The death of whom plainly if she may
Shall well be quyt / if so that Fortune
Be favorable / frendely to contune
That her face / change not contrary
But she that can / every day so varye
Alas the while / and selde in one soiourne
Began fro this queen / her look away to turn
To enhaste / thorugh her vngoodlyhede
Antropose / to break her lives threde
As the storye / plainly shall you lere
Benyngnely / if ye list to here.
THe fatal hour / hard for to remewe
Of cruel death / which noma^ may eschew
Nor in this life / finally escape
Specially / when Parchas have it shape
Approach began / it may none other been
Alas the while / of this hardy queen
Which on a day / furyous and wroth
Into the field / out of Troy goth
And began on greeks / proudely for to set
And alder first / Pirrus with her met
Of mortal hate / and indignacyowne
And she in haste / by the renges down
Rode unto him / swyftly on her stead
Whose sporys sharp / made his sides blede
And as they met / their speres in the rest
They bare so even / markynge at the breast
That their shaftes / sothly this no tale
Began to shyuer / all on pieces small
Without bowynge / outher back or chyne
For neither made / other to enclyne
Save the head / forged hard of stele
Of Pantasyllya / that was ground well
In Pirrus breast / percyd has so deep
That plate in soth / nor mayle might him keep
But the sharpness / of the speres head
Was of his blood / in party read
The which stroke / when greeks began espy
For astoned / loud began to cry
And all attones / for the noise and sown
Upon this queen / in the field came down
In compass wise / going enuyrowne
But thorugh her prowess / and her hye renown
She her diffendeth / that it was marvel
But they alas / so sore her began assail
That all to hew / they have her basenet
Amyd Greeks / so thycke she was beset
That with axes / and swerdes square
Her head in sothe / made was all bare
And her shuldres / were naked eke alas
The mayle hewn of / and the rere bras
And Pirrus than / like as it is found
For anguysshe oonly / of his grene wound
In doubt plainly / where he should escape
Toward this queen / fast began him rape
To be avenged / what so ever fall
Amyd the field / among the greeks all
And when she saw / that he came so fast
Of force oonly / to mete him yet she cast
And with her sword / first began him assail
But of her stroke / it happed her to fail
Among the prees / so narowe she was beset
And Pirrus sword / was so sharp whet
That sodaynely of / her arm he smette
Alas there was / none armoure him to let
But raceth thorugh all / the shuldre bone
So that this queen / fill down deed anon
And of malys / for ^o venge him more
At his heart / the ire / fret so sore
That with a chere / of very anger pale
He has her hewn / all on pecys small
The which was / to foul a cruel deed
But ever in one / Pirrus so began blede
Nyghe to the death / of his mortal wound
For lack of blood / that he fill to ground
In a trance / full long gruflynge he lay
Till knights / in all the haste they may
Have take him up / and laid him on a shield
And dolefully / home out of the field
They have him borne / wounded as he was
And the women / of the queen alas
For very sorrow / and inward deedly woe
When they saw / their lady was ago
For to be deed / they were so desirous
That in all haste / wood and furyous
In a rage / without gouernayle
Greeks they began / of new for to assail
To aue^ge their queen / they were so hertly ky^de
That they slew / sothely as I find
Two thousa^de greeks / on the^ they were so wode
But o alas / in great dis^oynt they stood
Oonly for lack / they have / no governor
For she was gone / that was their chief socour
Which was also / to speak of hardynesse
Of women all / lady and maystresse
As of her hand / that I can of read
OYe Troyans / ye stand in great dread
Amyd the field / all out of governance
The day is come / of your unhappy chance
For now have ye / leder none nor gyde
Farewell your trust / now on every side
And greeks be / upon you so strong
That ye the field / may not keep long
For they cast them / felly you to quyte
This same day / as Dares list endyte
For as he wryt / homewarde as they draw
Ten thousand / troyans / were of greeks yslawe
For all their wards / came attones down
And mortally / without excepcyowne
They kylle and slay / all that them withstode
And most they were / upon the women wode
To be avenged / plainly as I read
On every half / and their blood to shede
Without mercy / or remyssyowne
Chasynge troyans / home into the town
Out of the field / for there was none abode
So pyteously / tho with them it stood
That they ne can / none otherrecur cast
But keep their town / and shytte their gates fast
For all their hope / clean was agone
Any more to fight / with their fone
For now their trust / of knyghthode was away
Their worthy men / slain weylaway
Refute was none / but in their Cite
To keep them close / it may none other be
For them thought / they might it keep long
Their walls were / so mighty and so strong
If they had / plente of vytayle
Though all the world / attones them assay
They may be sure / while they keep them in
For evermore / that no man shall them wyn
Yet nevertheless / erely and eke late
The Greeks made / tofore every gate
Full mighty watch / and awayte full strong
With preuy spies / going in among
That of their foon / none escape away
By none engyne / as ferforth as they may
And in this while / within Troy town
More than I can / make descripcyowne
For the queen / there was so great a sorrow
Of every wight / both at eve and morrow
That she alas / was slain for her mede
Which came so fer / to help them in their need
And aldermoste / for they ne might have
The deed corpse / to burye it and to grave
With reverence / and with honor dew
For which they began / to the greeks sewe
With great prayer / and great business
But all in vain / and in ydelnesse
Was their request / the greeks / were so wroth
And finally / with many sundry oath
Oonly of malys / and of hot envy
The deed corpse / to them they deny
And shortly said / of mortal enmyte
That of hounds / it shall deuouryd be
There was no gain / their rancour to co^pesse
But Pirrus than / of very gentyllesse
Ne would assent / to so foul a deed
But wood and wroth / cruel Dyomede
Said openly / how it was sitting
That she fail / of her buriynge
That slain had / so many worthy man
And thus the strife / among the greeks began
With great rumoure / and altercacyowne
Till at the last / under Troy town
Of her they have / the deed corpse ytake
And cruelly / in a profounde lake
They have her cast / where I let her lie
And unto Troy / again I will me hye
To tell forth / how they live in pyne
O Cruel Mars / that have made for to fine
Thorugh thine ire / all y^ worthy blood
Of Troy alas / why have thou be so wode
Against them / to slay their knights all
Why have thou let / thy bitter venym fall
On them alas / thou sterre unfortunate
With all the world / to make them at debate
O hateful sterre / hot combust and dry
Fiery Irous / ground of all envy
Hasty ever / full of discencyon
And Coleryk / of thy complexyon
In murdre and death / is aye thy delight
In taking vengeance / most thine appetyte
First meuer / of anger and of hate
Rote of Contek / causynge to debate
In strife and murmur / most is thy desire
Feerfull of look / as any wild fire
And gastfulleuer / of thy wode sight
As any leven / so flamynge is thy light
Like in twynklynge / to the spakes read
In great fyres / that abroad so sprede
Consumynge aye / by melancolye
Hertes that be / enbraced with envy
Thy wrath is aye / so fretynge and so kene
And causest men / to be long and lene
Consumpt sklendre / brown and cytrenhewed
Vnmercyable / and right evil thewed
Wonder sleyghty / and Engenyous
Compassynge / and suspecyous
Tryste and solen / and full of heaviness
And assenting / to all cursydnesse
To awaytynge / death and roberye
To murdre also / and to trecherye
Without remors / of any conscience
So venymous / is thine influence
And helper art / unto false Treason
The house of whom / is the Scorpyon
And crowned art / in the Caprycorne
But in the Bole / is thy kyngome lorne
For therein is / thy deieccyon
Thy power lost / and domynacyon
And haste also / in thy subieccyon
Exyle werre / chains and prison
Proscripcyon / and Captyuyte
That for thy malys / on troy the Cite
So would god / I could chyde a right
That haste on them / kydde thy fell might
Of thy rancour / hoolly the outtraunce
First on them / for to do vengaunce
With speres sharp / and swerdes kene whette
And now in prison / to enclose them and shette
So vengeably / that they dare not out
The greeks fell / aye lyinge them about
They be not hold / in manner wise
In thy temple / to do sacryfyse
Neither with Bulls / nor with borys wild
Nor with bestes / that ever be vnmylde
As Tygres / Berys / nor the wode lion
Of which thou art / sovereign and patron
They are not hold / to do the brymstone smoke
On thine Auterys / which art so felly wroke
Of them alas / and now worste of all
Thou haste shad out / chief of all thy galle
Among them self / to bring in treason
Feigned truth / and symulacyon
To make hertes / among them self deuyde
Lo how the serpent / of discordecan glyde
Full slyly in / till he have caughte a place
To void away / both hap and grace
With his venym / of discencyon
When it is sprad / in any regyon
In any Common / borugh / town / or cite
Among men / of hye or low degree
For when hertes / in love be not one
Farewell Fortune / their grace is clean agone
For where discord / holds resydence
It is well worse / than sword of Pestylence
For what is worse / outher fer or nere
Than a foo / that is famylyere
For who may more / harm if him lust
Than any enmye / upon whom men trust
That to descryue / shortly in a clause
The very rote / and the true cause
Of all myschefe / and confucyon
In every land / is discencyon
And more peryllous / if it be pryue
Record I take / on Troy the Cite
That found Fortune / friendly aye at need
Till long bid hate / began a broad to sprede
For prudence sothly / has provided
That a regne / in it self divided
Shall recules / turn wild and waste
And the dwellers / desolate in haste
For Mars that is / of envy lord
Among them self / sown has discord
Again the which / may no socoure be
For worse than werre / sothly seems me
Treason cured / under a feigned pees
And root of all / was old Anchyses
With his sone / called Eneas
Dau^z Anthenor / and Pollydamas
That have contryued / among them utterly
And under veyl / concelyd secretly
If it fall / Greeks Troy to have
First how they may / their own lives save
By some engyne / sleyghtes or treat
And if so were / that it may not be
As they cast / by no manner weye
They would rather / traitors be to Troy
Pryuely / so it were not espied
And covertly / with Greeks ben allied
Than stand hole / with the town of truth
And wylfully / of neclygence and slouthe
Surau^ce and oath / of old made to the town
Refuse plainly / in conclusyowne
And allyaunce / let slake and slide
And their lygaunce / set also aside
In their auyse / they thought for the best
For they them cast / for to live at rest
And meryer eke / for ernest or for game
To save their life / and wandre forth in shame
Than wylfully / dye at myschefe
To traysshe their town / they held it no reprefe
So they might / escape them self a live
Them list no thing / for the town to strive
They sought in sothe / for sour or for sweet
A mean way / to live in quyete
And thereupon / they have their way nome
Unto the king / and when that they were come
To his presence / in full covert wise
Vndercoloure / they began deuyse
To tell their tale / so that finally
Teyr counsel was / that Pryam utterly
In no manner / be not reckeles
To pursewe / to greeks for a pees
If it so be / that he it get may
And yield again / to king Menelay
Without strife / the fresshe queen Eleyne
And over more / that he not disdeyne
The harms done / by Paris gone full yore
In Cytheron / justly to restore.
But o alas / of false Iniquyte
This counsel rose / for under in secret
The venym was / as sugre under galle
For well they wyste / that the greeks all
Ne would accord / in conclusyowne
To have a peace / with them of Troy town
Whiles they were / to such myschefe brought
To treat thereof / in sothe it was for naught
For Pryamus than / and Eccuba the queen
With his sons / and with Polycene
That yet were left / with him in the town
Might have reigned / by long successyowne
If that greeks full / and not repentyd
Unto a peace / holly had assentyd
But that counsel / given was to late
Sythen Greeks / of well elder date
Had proferyd first / at Tenedowne
By the advise / of king Agamenowne
A fynall peace / shortly for to seyne
So he would restore / again Eleyne
With amends / required of reason
Of damages / wrought at Cytheron
His messengers / first when that he sent
To Pryamus / that would not assente
To the request / justly that they brought
For of peace / the means that they sought
Of very pride / were to them denied
By wylfulnesse / alas so were they guyed
For lack oonly of wit / and of prudence
But now they have / with cost and great dispense
With slaughter of men / and many great damage
The sharp shoures / and the cruel rage
Abide fully / of this mortal werre
It is full sure / that they will not differ
The time forth / to treat for a pees
Them list no thing / to be so reckeles
Nor unadvised / what them ought to do
Trow ye they will / so lightly go
Home into greece / without recompense
They would seem / it were a neclygence
Speak not thereof / for it will not be
Tpecyally now / Troy the cite
In myschefe stand / upon his fynall fate
This remedy / shape was to late
For greeks thought / right of very trust
That they of Troy / stood at their lust
Holding them self / verily victours
And of their foon / fully conquerours
Without doubt / or ambygnytee
For the counsel / of this ylke Enee
Of Anthenor / and of this Anchyses
As ye have herd / to treat for a pees
Ne roos in sothe / but of doubleness
Oonly of treason / and of hye falsnesse
As Pryamus / conceyueth / by their chere
Like in this book / as ye shall after here
For on a day / when that Pryamus
With his sone / called Amphymacus
A counsel held / with other of the town
This three have made / a suggestyowne
Unto the king / touching the treat
But he anon / discrete and auyse
Prudently / or he would assente
Began vndergrope / plainly what they mente
Oonly of wit / and discrecyon
Or he it put / in execucyon
Making thereof / a manner of delay
But proudely than / stondynge at a bay
This Anthenor / without reverence
Spoke to the king / in open audyence
And shortly said / with a stern chere
If thou list / our counsel for to here
And do there after / platly thou may chese
And but thou will / where thou win or lose
This is the fine / thou gettest no more of me
Work after them / that of thy counsel be
To whom the king / wonder soberly
Answered again / full benyngnely.
Sire Anthenor / ye ought you not grieve
For mine intent / is not to repreue
Your wise counsel / nor your prudent read
If it conclude / to the common speed
Of my people / and sauacyon
But wit right well / justly of reason
Under sugre / if there be curyd galle
In preiudyce / of my lyeges all
Causynge them / in myschefe for to fine
I will there from / utterly declyne
As right requires / for our alder ease
And me seems / this should not displease
To thy conceyte / nor do the none offense
For every man / is holden of prudence
The worst to leave / and the better take
Wisdom to sewe / and folly to forsake
And remedy / to seek for his sore
And with that word / the Troyan Anthenor
Of sudden Ire / began to change his blood
And abreydynge / on his feet he stood
And full felly / said unto the king
Now sekerly / this is a wonder thing
How your wisdom / and auysenesse
Are blinded so / of very wylfulnesse
That ye may not / on nosyde se
The great myschefe / nor aduersyte
That we are in / upon every side
For we may not / dissymule nor hyde
In what disioynt / plainly that we stand
Be not our foon / also here at hand
And have be set / our wall round about
And we for fere / dare not issue out
Nor be so bold / to undo a gate
With them to fight / that us deedly hate
We be so feeble / and they are so strong
For sothly yet / they have them among
Fyfty kings / worthy of renown
Confederat / to our destruccyowne
And thereupon / platly will abide
Which vowed have / in their great pride
Never part hense / fro the town
Till the walls / be turned up so down
Your worthy sons / also now be deed
That you were wont / to help in your need
Your manly knights / slain euerychone
That us to save / remedy is none
It is in vain / to treaty of diffence
Wherefore I read / of reason and prudence
Or we be slain / and our Cite lose
Of two harms / the leest for to chese
This to say / that in our intent
As sitting is / and expedyent
We treat of p^as / and no longer feyne
And here with all / restore again Eleyne
For love of whom / many worthy man
Has lost his life / sythen the werre began
For now Paris / is vnderstone ygraue
The best read / in sothe that ye may have
To send her home / again to Menelay
And to profre / as ferforth as ye may
To restore within / a little while
The harms done / by Paris in the I Will
Which men are wont / Cythera to call
This is my read / here before you all
And with yt word / up rose Amphymacus
To this counsel / full contraryous
And shortly said / that it shall not be
As Anthenor / has rade in no degree
And ever thus / without more respyte
He spoke to him / of very hye despyte.

THou Anthenor / I have espied well
We may trust in the / never adele
With us to stand / in our great need
For truth and faith / in the be now deed
Falshede has slain / in the stabylnesse
And instead / of thy sykernesse
We find in the / sothly varyaunce
Where is be come / the faith of thy lygeaunce
Thy hestys made / to stand with thy king
Where be thine oaths / so double in menynge
Where is now hyd / thine old assurance
Where is be come / thy feigned false constaunce
Instead of which / Mutabylyte
Has take his place / like as we may se
With new change / thou art so remewable
Upon no ground / thou may not stand stable
Thy troth is gone / of old affeccyowne
That y^ should have / to stand with the town
Of faith with us / for to live or deye
For trust and hope / exyled be aweye
In thy person / shortly for to write
That besy art / the king to excyte
In disencrease / of his estat royal
Unto Greeks / now be so thrall
To seek a peace / as it were for dread
Thou should / rather of thy manlyhede
Have proferyd him / the Cite to diffende
There on thy life / at outtraunce to dispende
Wherefore in sothe / here I the assure
Rather than we / should this endure
Twenty thousand / shall with spear and shield
Upon a day / be slain in the field
Thy word I hold / for no prophecye
For it proceeds / of very trecherye
Of doubylnesse / and of false treason
Vndermynynge / with prodicyon
Though that thou / outward show fair
The venym hyd / thy tale does repair
Like a serpent / styngynge under flowers
There by to feel / of such counsayllours
And in this wise / with words despytous
Full bytyngly / has Amphymacus
All openly / Anthenor repreued
With his counsel / so he was agreued
Seeing the treason / that he would mean
Till Eneas / began to go between
With florysshed speech / full of flaterye
And began his tale / so to modefye
Like as he mente / truth in his intent
But therein was / double entendement
He spoke but one / and yet he mentetwayne
Amphymacus / oonly to refrain
To attempre him / of his melancolye
Oonly till he might / a time espy
Like his purpose / that he may proceed
To execute it / fully up in deed
And when that he / found had a space
Under pretens / of a true face
With his tale / he began to break out
Many Troyan / standing him about
And shortly said / for conclusyowne
Touching diffence / plainly of the town
How that it henge / hoolly in balaunce
For both / hope / trust / and assurance
Of the Cite / taken have their flight
For finally / our manhood and our might
And our knyghthode / togydre be ago
With the Greeks / more to have a do
And with them / stoutely for to fight
The which has lost / many a worthy knight
ANd they be ready / upon us to set
And we dare not / our gates more vnshet
We be alas / supprysed / so with dread
Than seems me / how it were great need
By good advise / for to seek a mean
In this myschefe / how we shall us demene
And for my part / sothfastly I say
I know as now / none so ready way
As prudently / for a peace to trete
But Pryam than / in a sudden hete
Without abode / of chere and face pale
Of rancour began / interrupte his tale
For he attempre / might not his heart
So fretyngly / the treason made him smerte
And for he might / him self not restrain
Thus he said / unto both twain
To Anthenor / and also to Enee
I wonder greatly / that ye hardy be
In your truth / for shame so to varye
And that ye be / so rebel and contrary
To me oonly / of false collusyon
Us to bring / in desperacyon
Me and my lyeges / if I shall not feign
Of false intent / to catch us in a train
Alas how may ye / in your heart find
Again nature / for to be unkind
That whylom were / of my counsel chief
Of every thing / or it was brought to prefe
For ye absent / I could no thing fine
And now alas / ye cast to declyne
Away fro me / barayne left and sooll
That to remember / it is to great adooll
How any wight / alas so change can
For who shall more / trust any man
When ye be found / double / of intent
Can ye not think / how by your assent
By your counsel / and by your auys
Whylom / how I sent forth Paris
Into to Greece / of full yore ago
And Anthenor / thou wotest thy self also
How thou were first / made embassatour
And thereupon / chief counsayllour
Touching the sonde / made for Exyon
But after that / cause and mocyon
Though were in soth / that Paris should go
Into Greece / thou wotest well it is so
For Ine durst / of presumpcyon
Have sent Paris / unto Cytheron
Without advise / and auctoryte
Of Eneas plainly / and of the
Upon Greeks / a werre to have gonne
I trow in sothe / that you neither konne
Excuse him self / and ye be auysed
For every thing / wrought was and devised
And execute / by counsel of you tweyne
For when Paris / went for Eleyne
Ground and root / to speak in special
Were thou Enee / and cause pryncypall
Present also / when every thing was wrought
Out of Greece / when she was hyder brought
For this the sothe / out of that regyowne
She never had / come / to this town
If thou had / be thereto contrayre
Albe thou would / with thy words fair
Thyselfe excuse / here in audyence
As thou knew naught / of that offense
But fully were / vnwyttynge of the deed
And now my sons / euerychone be deed
And ye mese / alone destytute
Your counsel is / as for chief refute
Me to pursewe / to Greeks for a pees
As I were / foryetell reckeles
To remember / the infynyt outrages
The mortal werre / slaughter and damages
The cruelte / and destruccyowne
That they have wrought / hereupon this town
That verily / when I all record
For to be deed / I can not accord
With them to treat / like as ye deuyse
For I espy / in many sundry wise
In your intent / a right peryllous snare
So covertly / under falsehede dare
That it will be / to my confusyon
If ye acheue / your entencyon
Finally / as ye have it shape
For impossyble / it were to escape
Shamefully / at myschefe me to dye
Without recure / of any remedy
For this the fine / I know it out of doubt
Of the treat / that ye be about.
And right anon / the Troyan Eneas
Of Ire and rancoure / so ameued was
Again the king / with a swellynge heart
That sodaynely / out at the door he sterte
After he had / for to be a wroke
Full many word / again the king yspoke
He went his way / and Anthenor also
And Pryamus / of very Ire and woe
Sodaynely / braste out / for to weep
He might him self / not for anguysshe keep
The anger frat / upon him so sore
Within him self / conceyuynge more and more
By euydence / of discrecyon
The covert gyle / and the false treason
That they for him / and for his Cite
Ishapen have / but he auysed be
Dredynge aye / that these ylke twain
By some engyne / or conspyred train
To the Greeks / would him betraye
Wherefore the king / cast and would say
Shape away / their malys to withstonde
So the treason / that they took on hand
Oonly of right / in deed or it were found
Upon them self / might again rebounde
That the full / execucyon
Of their contryued / conspyracyon
Resort again / in full dew wise
Oonly on them / that began it first deuyse
Treason for treason / is conuenyent
For to falsehed / the guerdon pertynent
Is shameful death / and the fynall mede
Wherefore to shape / in this great need
A remedy / this old Pryamus
Calls his sone / Amphymacus
And pyteously / alone / but they twain
In terys drowned / began to him complain
On Anthenor / and on this Eneas
And said sone / take heed in this cas
And think how / I am thy Fader dear
And how there be / now no more yfere
O^ my sons / left with me a live
But thou alone / and therefore as blyue
Touching the treason / conspyred and ysworne
What ever fall / let us be toforne
Oonly of wisdom / away for to make
That we may first / in the trappe them take
And to puruey / for them even lyche
That justly / they may fall in the oyche
Which they have made / and for us ytreyned
And in all have / let so be ordained
That this matter / close be kept in mewe
To fine oonly / that they not eschew
For to be slain / of equity and right
In this place / even toward night
For I purpose / plainly for their sake
Again that hour / a counsel for to make
And under color / make them both call
And thou unawarely / shall upon them fall
With knights sworn / unto the and me
In this matter / for to be secre.
And right anon / this Amphymacus
Assentyd is / unto Pryamus
To accomplysshe / in full secret wise
Fro point to point / as ye have herd deuyse
But sothe is said / of full yore agone
Of old wise / yt counsel is there none
In all this world / so pryuely ycaste
That it will out / platly at the last
For the people / which that is rural
Says yt secrets / which be not known at all
The earth will / as they make mind
Discure them / of his own kind
And of nature / up cast and disclose
The thing that men / are wont in it to close
Let every man / beware as it is good
Or his counsel / go to far abroad
And specially lords / have great need
Of all men / they stand most in dread
So great awayte / is upon them laid
That when it happeth / that a thing be said
Or ones spoke / of a lords mouth
It falls often / that it is full kouthe
And reported / and ysprad full wide
In many cost / by them that stand aside
Or he be ware / by sudden adventure
For some in hap / in whom he does assure
Will first of all / him report amys
Therefore in sothe / best for them is this
For to beware / and keep their tongue
A purpose cast / should not be ronge
Nor spoke abroad / among folks rude
For gladly aye / the worste they conclude
Of every thing / while that it is new
In report varyaunt / and untrue
For after reason / no thing they expowne
But after will / the folk that be of town
Like the purpose / which they desire
For they fare / as a wyspe of fire
When it brenneth / bryghtest in his blase
Sodaynely / it wastes as a mase
On such folk / platly is no tryste
That fire and water / hold in their fyste
Being with both / ylke indifferent
Now hot now cold / like as their intent
Of new changes / so in their courage
After the calm follows / sudden rage
To day they love / and tomorowe hate
To trust a common / lasts by no date
Let not a lord / make them to secree
For now the counsel / is run to Enee
That Pryam wend / had be full close
For the rumor / and the wind arose
By false report / and so far is blow
That Eneas and Anthenor / well know
End and gynnynge / and every manner thing
And hole the counsel of Pryamus the king
And both two / full of one intent
With other eke / that were of their assent
Conspyred be / and togydre sworn
And covertly / cast away aforne
That finally / Troy the Cite
By their engyne / shall destroyed be
And of accord / cast plainly thus
If it hap / that king Pryamus
Send for them / shortly to conclude
They would come / with such multitude
Of armyd men / if they se need
That of him / they should no thing dread
For Eneas / was in that Cite
Of great power / and Auctoryte
Both of blood / and kynred allied
And for his gold / greatly magnefyed
Thorugh the Cite / most in special
That he in might / and power perygall
As says Guydo / was unto the king
And Anthenor / almost in every thing
Was unto him / Egall of powere
And both twain / of one heart entere
Conspyred have / in sothe again the town
Finally / to this conclusyowne
That they of greeks / might have surete
With their treasoure / to go at lyberte
With their allies / borne of Troy town
When all were brought / to destruccyowne
With life and good / ^aufe without more
At which time / for dau^z Anthenor
And Eneas / Pryamus has sent
To accomplysshe / the fine of his intent
And they in haste / with so great a route
Came of knights / stuffyd them about
That thereof was / astoned Pryamus
And made send / for Amphymacus
Co^maundynge him / to change his purpose
For well he wyste / his counsel was not close
And by signs / began well understand
That the matter / which they had on hand
Discured was / to his confusyon
Both the murdre / and conspyracyon
Apparceyuynge / in his in ward sight
The great power / of this Troyan knight
And the favor / of this Eneas
And of the Common / how he fostryd was
The which proudely / in open audyence
Tofore the king / declares his sentence
Fully concludynge / maugre who says nay
How that there was / none other mean way
Refute nor gain / nor other remedy
But oonly peace / who so it deny
Other escapynge / plainly was there none
And thereupon / the Commons euerychone
With one voice / began to gale and cry
And his counsel / greatly magnefye
Albe the king / was thereto contrary
But Eneas / list no longer tarry
Nor differ / the fine of his purpose
But wonder Irous / from his see he rose
And full ungoodly / spoke unto the king
And shortly said / without more tariynge
Where so befalle / thou be lefe or loathe
Or with this purpose / pleased outher wroth
Thou may well trust / it shall none other be
For finally / harken this of me
Maugre thy will / and also all thy might
This same day / yet or it be night
For a peace / with Greeks we shall trete
And when the king / saw the fervent hete
Both of the common / and of Eneas
He began anon / dissymule in this caas
For of prudence / he clearly began to se
For that time / it may none other be
Wherefore sithe he / might it not amend
He wisely began / for to condescende
To the purpose / platly of Enee
And said he would / goodly take at gree
And accept what / them list ordain
And so the king / lernyd to feign
Again the conceyte / platly of his heart
For otherwise / he could not asterte
Coacte of force / and of vyolence
And when he saw / in his aduertence
That he might / dyuerte on no side
From the fraud / that sown was so wide
Without grutchynge / he falsely gave assent
That Anthenor / should forth be sent
By common choice / to treat for the town
Which was tofore / in conclusyowne
With the Greeks / accordyd finally
Touching the effect / of his ambassatrye
Fro point to point / where he would stand
Varyaunt / fro that he took on hand
And for they had / before him full conceived
With better chere / he was of them received
And in this while / that Anthenor was out
For to treat / with the greeks stout
As ye have herd / for a peace fynall
In the town / about on every wall
They of Troy / began ascend blyue
With the branches / of many fresshe olyue
In token of peace / and greeks eke again
Amyd the field / endelonge the plain
Showed them / that all might seen
Eke of Olyue / lusty bows grene.
And to conferme / this fro proynt to point
And that no thing / stood in no disioynt
The worthy king / great Agamenon
Committed has / of hye discrecyon
Fully power / and auctoryte
For the Greeks / plainly unto three
First of all / for a peace to trete
Unto the wise / worthy king of Crete
To vlixes / and to Dyomede
To these mo / them thought it was no need
For what they do / they will hold stably
And finally / not be varyable
From the end / platly that they make
And thereupon / was assurance take
Of either part / by bond of sacrament
And so they be / with Anthenor ywent
Out aside / this worthy lords three
And when they were / at their lyberte
From all tumulte / alone pryuely
This Anthenor / full of treachery
Replete of falshode / and of doubylnesse
Began his purpose / unto them express
Behotynge them / to Trasshe the cite
So they would / make him suerte
That first him self / and with him Eneas
Shall fredam have / in every manner caas
With their allies / and goods euerychone
Where them list / at large for to gone
At their choice / or dwelling in the town
With their richesse / and possessyowne
Without harm / or any more damage
Like as they se / it be to advantage
Of their persons / to void or abide
And they were sworn / on the greeks side
Covenant to hold / in party and in all
As was rehearsed / before in special
And as they were / by their oaths bound
So that there be / no varyaunce found
Of neither party / platly nor no strife
And they behyght / up peril of their life
And when he had / assurance of them three
He charged them / to keep in secre
All that was said / that no thing be di^curyd
Unto time / that they were assuryd
Of the end / grosyd up in deed
For it were good / that they took head
List their purpose / perturbyd were or shent
By coming / without auysement
Of this tongues / that be long and large
Wherefore he began / con^oure them and charge
In all wise / for to be pryue
So that no wyghte / but he and they three
Of none estate / neither hye nor low
Fully the fine / of their intent ne know
And covertly / our purpose for to hyde
Quod Anthen or / upon every side
To void away / all suspeccyowne
This mine advise / that to troy town
The wise king / called Taltybyus
Shall go with me / to king Pryamus
For he is hoar / and yronne in rage
Coy of his port / sleyghty and right sage
And therwithall / sad demure and stylle
Of whom troyans / no thing shall mysylle
But that he come / to treat for a pees
To be assuryd / and write douteles
Where the Troyans / agree will thereto
In every thing / finally to do
As Anthenor / greeks has behyght
Thus shall they be / deuoyded anon right
Thorugh his coming / from all suspeccyon
Till that we have / our conclusyon
As ye have herd / parfourmed euerydele
Of which thing / the greeks like well
And be appointed / upon every thing
What they will do / and how this old king
With Anthenor / shall to Troy go
And after this / he axed eke also
Of Pantasylle / the body for to have
In the Cite / that men might it grave
With dew honor / longing to her estate
To void away / suspeccyon and debate
And Anthenor / for it drew to eve
Of the Greeks / taken has his leave
And with this king / repeyreth into town
Whereof was made / anon relacyon
To king Pryam / without more delay
And he in haste / upon the next day
Made assemble / all his Cytesens
Secretly / deuoydynge all Foreyns
Where Anthenor / in open audyence
Thorugh the halle / when made was silence
His tale began / with sugryd words sweet
Making the bawne / outward for to flete
Of rethoryk / and of eloquence
Of chere nor word / that there was none offense
In showing out / so circumspect he was
That no man could / in no manner caas
By sign outward / nor by countenance
Perceive in him / any varyaunce
So hard it was / his treason to espy
The effect declarynge / of his embassatrye
With clear report / of his answer again
In his meaning / though he were not plain
For underneath / he was with fraud fraught
This sleyghty wolf / till he his pray has caught
For he was close / and covert in his speech
As a serpent / till he may do wreche
Hydynge his venym / under flowers long
And as a be / that styngeth with the tongue
When he has shad / out his honey sote
Sugre in the crop / venym in the rote
Right so in soth / with tongue in Scorpyon
This Anthenor / root of all treason
His tale told / with a face pleyne
Like the son / that shyneth in the reyne
That fair shows / though the weder be
Wonder diverse / and troubly for to se
So this tygre / full of doubylnesse
So covertly / his treason did express
As he not mente / but truth to the town
Fully affermynge / in conclusyowne
How the greeks / mighty were and strong
And lykly eke / to abide long
Day by day / ready them to assail
And also plente / of vytayle
Concludynge aye / there was no remedy
Against them / to hold chaumpartye
Nor with them / any more to strive
For he said / they had yet a live
Their worthy knights / hardy as lions
Their manly men / and their champyons
Which their lives / platly to Iuparte
From the Cite / cast them not depart
Till their purpose / acheued be in all
For finally / nouther toure nor wall
Nor your gates / of yren though ye shette
The Greeks shall / on no side let
But that they will / us win at the last
Wherefore it needs / a mean way to cast
Sythen of might / nor favor of Fortune
We may not long / against them contune
Wherefore quod he / so ye condescende
I can right well / all this thing amend
Remedy / so that ye not varye
To that I say / for to be contrary
This to mean / shortly out of doubt
Embassatoure / when that I was out
With the greeks / last when ye me sent
They said goodly / how they would assent
Unto a peace / by this condycyon
That ye will make / restytucyon
Of the harms / and the vyolences
The wrongs done / and also the offenses
By Paris wrought / in Greece at Cytheron
As it is right / me seems of reason
For their request / is meynt with equity
And we be driven / of necessyte
Unto their lust / justly to enclyne
Maugre our will / the werre for to fine
For all is now / in their eleccyon
We may not make / no rebellyon
Now the matter / is so fer ybrought
To strive again / in soth it helps naught
It may apeyre / but no thing avail
Therefore the best / that I can counsel
As in proverb / has be said of yore
That if a man / be constrained sore
And may not flee / to fall in a train
Let him chese / the less harm of twain
And the gretter / prudently / to eschew
And let our gold / that ye kept in mewe
To save our life / make redempcyon
For better it is / demeth of reason
Spoiled to be / oonly of richesse
Than wylfully / dye in distress
The life is better / than glode or any good
Set all at naught / in saving of your blood
For folly is / a man / for his welfare
Thorugh couetyse / any gold to spare
And now our life / depends in balaunce
Let gold farewell / and go with myschaunce
We may hereafter / by sort of adventure
Gold by grace / and good enough recure
And sythen we / as I have you told
May bye a peace / finally for gold
And with our treasour / stynt eke the werre
It were folly / plainly to differ
With the greeks / utterly to accord
For if so be / I to them record
That ye assent / without any varyaunce
There may of peace / be no perturbaunce
It is so light / now to be recured
For as soon / as they be assured
By just report / of your entencyons
They will do write / oblygacyons
Of couenauntes / that not be by hynde
And that ye shall / in them no fault find
When assurance / from outher part is had
Thereupon / Endentures shall be made
So that of faith / ye may them not repreue
And for that / they fully trust and leave
Without fraud / my relacyon
I will now make / no dylacyon
To signefye / to them in certain
Hoolly the effect / of that ye will said
And the people / loud began to cry
All with one voyse / and to magnefye
All that ever / Anthenor has said
And upon him / they have the charge laid
Of their answer / and intent fynall
And by record / to report all
That no thing / be forgetten in this caas
They have assigned / also Eneas
With him to go / for the same thing
In the presence / of the old king
Taltybyus / which also of intent
With Anthenor / was to Troy sent
The which three / have plainly undertake
As ye have herd / a fynall peace to make
Albe that they / in covert treason mente
And on their way / forth anon they went
With plain power / committed of the town
BUt king Pryam / has ay suspeccyowne
To Anthenor / and also to Enee
How that they / shall destroy his Cytee
And to him self / tryste of hertely woe
He said alas / what is best to do
In this myschefe / that I am in fall
And yet is this / to me worste of all
That I am now / thorugh mine aduersyte
Bound and compelled / of necessyte
Maugre my head / in manner of raunson
For my life / to make redempcyon
Unto my foon / that I have most at heart
I se right well / I may it not asterte
For I must pay / there gayneth no socoure
My good my gold / riches and treasoure
To my most foon / and dare it not deny
And yet I stand / of life in Iupartye
Without refute / hanging in balaunce
Alas constrained / thorugh my woeful chance
To obey their lust / that mortally me hate
Driven thereto / of birth thorugh my fate
So Parchas / have my desteny yshape
By no engyne / I may it not escape.
ANd while pryam / began thus to co^pleyne
To Anthenor / came the queen Eleyne
Besechynge him / in his embassatrye
Of gentyllesse / for to specefye
Thorugh / his prudent medyacyon
To find away / in conseruacyon
Of her estate / finally that she
To Menelay / may reconsyled be
If so fall / that the treat hold
So that her lord / of his grace would
Restore her / unto her degree
Oonly of mercy / and of hye pity
And Anthenor / unto her request
Gave audyence / making a beheste
How he would / with all his heart entere
Be dylygent / to treat of this matere
And therwithall / of him she took her leave
And thus was done / on the same eve
That Anthenor / I pray god give hy^ sorrow
To Greeks went / on the next morrow
Oonly to treat / for apeas fynall
And in this while / the feast Funeral
Was hold in troy / mine Auctor writes thus
Of a lord / that called was Glaucus
A manly knight / tofore in his living
And sone was / of Pryamus the king
And over this / like as says Guydo
That king Pryam / besyed him also
Of Pantasyllya / how the body might
Be conseruyd / fresshely to the sight
And for love / of this worthy queen
Of puryd gold / and of stones shene
He let make / a vessel full ryall
And fylde it full / with bawne natural
To keep the corpse / fro corrupcyowne
Till the werre / of greeks and of the town
Thorugh the treat / were ystynted clean
SO that the king / called Phylymene
This deed queen / might of affection
Carye it home / into her regyon
With the Auncetres / buried for to be
Like the manner / of old antiquyte
And the custom / used in that time
It were in vain / more thereof to ryme
I pass over / unto the Tretee
Atwene greeks / and Troy the Cytee
And for the party / of greeks as I read
First vlixes / and with him Dyomede
Assigned were / and the king of Crete
With Anthenor / and Eneas to mete
And all yfere / shortly in sentence
By conduyt first / and after by license
Of the noble wise / Agamenowne
They entered be / into Troy town
By conueyinge / of this Eneas
Of whose coming / such a Joy there was
Of the comunes / which in things new
Rejoice aye / after though they rewe
Wenynge full well / in their oppynyon
That / by the good medyacyon
Of Vlixes / and the king of Crete
And Dyomede / that came eke to Trete
That these three / should make as fast
A fynall peace / ever for to last
And a full end / of their alder sorrow
And thereupon / Erely the next morrow
Pryam let make / a conuocacyowne
Of all the worthy / within Troy town
And when they were / assembled all in one
The wise Vlixes / rose up anon
And his tale / began in such a wise
So prudently / his words to deuyse
That to harken / every man has joy
And specially / they that were of Troy
That of his inward / menynge fraudelent
Full little wyste / nor of his intent
To their pleasaunce / so he could feign
And first he axeth / of them things twain
The one was this / that of the Cite
He would have gold / an huge quantyte
In recompense / of harms that were do
Another thing / he axed also
Without abode / that Amphymacus
That sone was / to king Pryamus
Perpetuelly / that he exyled be
Never to enter / Troy the cite
For gold prayer / nor for no raunson
And this was done / by suggestyon
Of Anthenor / false and malycious
Oonly / for he was contraryous
That he should / treaty for to a pees
And for that / he was not reckeles
To say a truth / this Amphymacus
Therefore in sothe / this serpent enuyous
Now he has found / a time for to byte
He thought he would / cruelly him quyte
For truth oonly / that was in his intent
Therefore it is / full expedyent
Of prudence / every man to charge
That his tongue / be not over large
Trouthes all / be not for to said
For wisdom is / sometime to feign
And dissymule / in aduersyte
Specially / when men in trouble be
And se their speech / may them not auyle
Better is than / that their tongue fail
Than folyly / to their damage speak
Men must among / kure and over reke
The truth of things / oonly of prudence
And humbly / suffer in pacyence
For false report / of folks enuyous
Who can so do / I hold him virtuous
For better it is / a while to abide
Than say all out / of rancoure and of pride
Silence in sothe / has often in hasty strife
Had of victory / a prserogatyfe
And the palm / of debates won
That well are they / that so suffer konne
And be of speech / not presumptuous
For as I told / this Amphymacus
Not withstanding / that he truth mente
Yet for a word / he into Exyle went.
Albe that god / full justly afterward
Has Anthenor quyte / for his reward
For with the same / he was after hit
For his falsenesse / duly as it sit
This to say / for his iniquyte
He was to exyle / and captyuyte
For iuged after / into proscripcy own
And relegat / out of Troy town
Perpetuelly / by the procuring
Of Eneas / loo / how the right full king
That all may se / in his prouydence
Full justly can make recompense
Of doubylnesse / and symulacyon
And of all such / contryued false treason
For who auengeth / with falsehede on his part
He shall be hit / with the same darte
He scapeth not / for to have a wound
For falsehede aye / will again rebounde
Where it rose first / to his Orygenall
Resort again / right as does a ball
For who for fraud / ever does him cast
Trust right well / it will out at the last
And who supplanteth / shall supplanted be
By good exaumple / as ye shall after se.
OF Anthenor / the storye if ye read
And whiles they / treaty and proceed
Touching the exyle / and proscripcyon
Captyuyte / and relegacyon
That they cast / for Amphymacus
There was herd / a noise meruayllous
A great tumulte / and a wonder sown
Like as it were / a lamentacyowne
Of sundry folk / playnynge in distress
For hertely woe / and in ward heaviness
Out of the treat / even when they gone
This confuse cry / after began anon
Whereof vlixes / and eke Dyomede
Sodaynely / fylle in a dread
Supposing / in their oppyowne
That some rumoure / was fall in the town
Among the people / in the como^te
Of hasty rancour / avenged for to be
For the love / of Amphymacus
That causeles was / exyled thus
Of volunte / again all truth and right
Wherefore they dradde / when it drew to night
To be murdered / of the commons of the town
For the fraud / and conspyracyowne
Falsely compalsyd / of old enmytee
By Anthenor / and by false Enee
And sothly yet / there was no manner man
That could wit / whereof it began
Nor espy / first where it arose
In all the paleys / nor thorugh out the close
They herd it well / but they lay naught
Whereof they were / astoned in their thought
And affrayde / of very sudden dread
Vlixes most / and also Dyomede
List with commons / they had be by set
But Anthenor / without longer let
To make them sure / from all tumulte and cry
The Greeks has / conveyed secretly
And when they were / assured of their place
Vlixes first / with a changed face
Began pynche sore / in the self while
At Anthenor / of treason and of gyle
That with his hestys / so fro day to day
Of very sleyghte / put them in delay
Semynge fully / for ought he could espy
There was deceyt / fraud or trecherye
In the couenauntes / that he has behyght
To whom an one / this false Troyan knight
With sad chere / and sobre countenance
Well auysed / in his dalyaunce
Answerde again / and plainly did express
I wysse quod he / I take unto witness
The hye gods / that every thing may se
Without faynynge / that I have besy be
Fro point to point / your purpose to acheue
So that I you / do not grieve
And finally / that ye list to here
There is one thing / parturbeth this matere
Which that I shall / so it be none offense
Plainly remember / here in your presence
This to say / of old Antyquyte
First at the byldynge / of Troy the Cite
That whylom was / ycalled Yllyon
For cause oonly / at his foundacyon
King Ylyus / sithe go full long
The founder was / of the wall strong
After whom / as made is mencyon
It called was / and named Yllyon
In the which / with great and besy charge
In Pallas name / he made a temple large
That passyngly / was had in reverence
And when this Phane / of most excellence
Performed was / by masonry full well
And save the rofe / complete euerydele
Of mighty stone / the byldynge well assured
But or it was / with led and timber cured
Again tempest / for to be obstacle
There fill a wonder / oonly by miracle
That I dare well / afferme it in certain
Such another / was there never seyne
Who so list se / and consydre all
This marvel was / so celestyall.
FOr there came down / from y^ hye heaven
By Plyades / and the sterres seven
And thorugh the Eyer / holding his passage
Like a fair / and meruaylous image
That in this world / though men had sought
Ne was there none / half so well ywrought
For as it is / trewely to suppose
Pygmalyon / remembered in the rose
In his time / had no cunning
To grave or peynte / so curyous a thing
For it was wrought / with dylygent labor
By hand of Angel / in the heavenly toure
Thorugh gods might / and dyuyne ordyau^ce
And hyder sent / thorugh his puruyaunce
For a relyke oonly / of his grace
And provided / to the same place
There to abide / for a proteccyon
For a diffence / and sauacyon
Perpetuelly / while the world may dure
Again all myschefe / and mysauenture
Every trouble / and trybulacyon
In susteynynge / and releuacyon
And soueraygne help / eke of this Cite
The which / never may destroyed be
By none engyne / that men may purchase
The gods have / granted such a grace
And such virtue / annexed eke thereto
That troy in sothe / may never be fordo
Till this relyke / stole be away
And yet in sothe / there is no man that may
From the place / stere it / nor remewe
But the priest / to whom it is dew
Oonly of office / to touch it with his hand
So myghtely / conserved is the bond
That who attempteth / in conclusyon
It to remewe / of presumpcyon
At the fine / platly he shall fail
For force none / may him not avail
For it in sothe / will not remeued be
Except of him / to whom of duete
It apperteyneth / as ye have herd to forne
And over more / there is no man yet borne
That read can / nor tell in no degree
Verily / where it be stone or tree
Nor how it was devised / nor ywrought
There is no wight / so sotyll in his thought
Ceryously / to tell the manner
For Mynerua / that is so fresshe and clear
The stern goddess / thorugh her great might
That is so dredefull / both of look and sight
Which on her breast / haueth of cristall
Her shield Egys / this goddess inmortall
Ygraunted has / in books as I learn
Thorugh her power / which that is eterne
This holy relyke / for a memoryall
To her temple / of byldynge most royal
It to conserve / from all assaute of bread
And to socoure / in every manner need
Again their foon / unto Troy town
While it is kept / with deuociowne
So that always / by successyowne
From king to king / in the line down
But just tycle / lynealy succeed
There to annexyd / that they take heed
Prudently / avoiding neclygence
It to conserve / with dew reverence
As they are bound / and yholde of right
Than shall no enmye / power have nor might
To do damage / in hyndrynge of the town
And why it is called / Palladyowne
Like as clerks / write of it and said
Is for Pallas / to make her town certain
This relyke sent / fro the heaven down
And to conclude / shortly my reasowne
This the cause / our purpose is so let
Than quod vlixes / sith it may beno bet
Our labor is / in ydell and in vain
Without recure / if it be certain
As thou haste said / this town in no degree
Thorugh this relyke / may not destroyed be
It was folly / the to undertake
Unto Greeks / beheste for to make
Without this / thou had be well sure
Quod Anthenor / yet there is recure
As I have hight / ye shall have the town
All though there be / a dylacyowne
And the manner anon / I shall tell
If it so be / ye list a while dwell
Without noise / outher perturbaunce
The priest / the which the governance
Of this relyke / shall be spoke unto
By good advise / and ytretyd so
That he shall be / full of our assent
For he with gold / and treasour shall be blent
That he accord shall / to our purpose
To bring the relyke / which is kept so close
To what place / that ye list assygne
Be still of port / goodly and benygne
In your works / till I have brought about
Fully this thing / and be nothing in doubt
I dare my self / take it well on hand
And when they had / his menynge understood
They took leave / and went out of the town
But first / to void all suspecyowne
At their going / Anthenor has hight
How that he would / go the same night
To Pryamus / to make ordinance
How the bonds / and the assurance
Of the peace / should ymaked be
And for to know / eke the quantyte
Of the gold / that ye shall receive
Thus shall I best / the purpose apparceyne
Of the king / to know it eueryde^e
And they consent / and like wonder well.
Every thing / that Anthenor has fayde
And so they part / glad and well apayde
And went their way / and made no tariynge
And Anthenor / goth unto the king
Him counsayllynge / he make no delay
To call his lords / again the next day
And his lyeges / to assemble yfere
Finally / to engroce / this matere
As it was sitting / and expedyent
And when the king / in open perlement
Crowned sat / in his regalye
This Anthenor / began to specyfye
In audyence / that men might know
To each estate / both hye and low
The greeks will / if they agree thereto
And what the su^me / was of gold also
Which they axe / if the peace shall stand
Twenty thousand Mark / to have in hand
Of puryd god / which must anon be paid
And of silver / that may not be delayed
They must eke have / the same quantyte
And over this / as they accorded be
Certain mesours / by covenant also
Of whete and flower / their lives for to save
In their repair / by the large see
When they sail / home to their country
And that the collect / made be anon
By good advise / of them euerychone
That all be ready / by acercayne day
There was no man / that durst tho say nay
Nor contrary / that Anthern or has said
Where so they were / well or evil paid
But full assent / in conclusyowne
And in all haste / thorugh out all the town
The Collatours / gadered up the gold
Like the su^me / that I have you told
Of pore and rich / there was spared none
The which time / Anthenor is gone
Unto the priest / that called was Tonaunt
I she might / in any wise him daunt
To make his heart / fully to enclyne
Full craftily / he laid out hoke and line
With lusty ^eyte / of false coueytyse
Excycynge him / in full secret wise
That would / be of his assent
And condescende / unto his intent
To put him / in possessyon
Of the relyke / called Palladyon
Without abode / it may delyueryd be
And gave him gold / an huge quantyte
And him to blende / much more behyght
And this was done / full pryuely by night
Shortly concludynge / if he condescende
That he would / his estate amend
So passyngly / that for ever more
He and his heirs / should have gold and store
Plente enough / that none indygence
Should have power / him to do offense
For unto the / this a vow I make
Quod Anthenor / and platly undertake
Of gold and good / thou shall have suffysaunce
And of treasour / passing habundaunce
That thou shall / in very sykernesse
All thy kyn excelle / in richesse
If thou deliver / like to mine axynge
Palladyon / which is in thy keeping
And I behote / thou may trust me
By bond of it / shall be secree
List it were / hyndrynge to thy name
For if so be / that thou dread shame
To be esclaundred / of so foul a deed
I shape shall / that thou need not dread
Nor be agaste / in no manner wise
For such away / in sothe I shall deuyse
That no man / shall be suspecyous
To thy person / nor engenyous
To deem amysse / how this matter goth
For be well ware / that me were as loath
To be diffamed / of so false a thing
To know thereof / or be assenting
In any manner / that they of the town
Should to me / have suspeccyowne
Lece be / let be / lever I had deye
We shall therefore / cast another weye
Our honor save / so that thou and I
Shall go all quyte / I say the utterly
That neither / shall behold ne parceyuere
Of this theft / but stand hole and clear
What ever fall / without any shame
For vlixes / shall bear all the blame
Of this deed / and this thief also
For men shall say / when that it is ago
By his engyne / and his sleyghty wyle
Thorugh his treynes / and his false gyle
That he has stole / away Palladyowne
From the temple / in lesynge of the twone
That finally / during all his live
Men shall to him / this falsehede ascryue
And all the gylte / aretten his offense
That thou and I / oonly of Innocence
Thorugh out the world / of this iniquyte
Shall Be excusyd / platly and go free
It needs not / tarry in this matere
Come of attones / lo thy gold is here
For thou ne shalt / longer delayed be
And sith thou see / that no diffyculte
Is on no part / pereyll nor reprefe
Shame nor dread / scalundre nor myschefe
Delay not to take / this thing on hand
And first this priest / began him to withstonde
Full myghtely / and said for nothing
Nouther for prayer / nor for manasynge
For gold nor good / ne no manner mede
He ne would assent / to so foul a deed
Thus he answerde / at the pryme face
But often sithe / it happeth men purchase
By gift of good / to speak in words plain
That troth in pouerte / might never attain
For mede more / by falshede may conquer
Than title of right / that men in troth lere
And gifts great / hertes can enclyne
And gold they may / in steel and marbyll mine
This prestes heart / has so deep grave
That Anthenor / shall his purpose have
For to possede / the Palladyon
Thorugh false engyne / and conspyracyon
Of this priest / that called was Tonaunte
Which of falshede / might him best auaunte
That this relyke / fro the temple rent
And to Vlixes / Anthenor it sent
Out of the town / in all the haste he might
By a servant / secretly by night
Whereof Troyans / mortally dismayde
And thorugh treason / finally out trayed
Wrought by this priest / with coueytyse blent
False Anthenor / being of assent.
How the Greeks made an horse of brass wherein was men of Arms / and under
color of peace brought it into Troy / by the which it was utterly dystroyed
for ever. Cap^. xxxv.
O Troy alas / well may you morn and weep
In complaining / wthertely syghes deep
Falsely defraudyd / of Palladyon
And put for ever / out of possessyon
O mighty gods / that the world govern
And every thing / thorugh your might co^serne
Right as it is / of your deyte
And truth / and falshede / may togydrese
In every heart / thorugh your puruyaunce
Why took ye not / on this priest vengaunce
That traytoursly / thorugh his iniquyte
For gold and good / be traysshed the cite
Of troy alas / without more recure
Who shall emforth / and more be sure
Or any place / stand in sykerte
Sith holiness / of so hye degree
May be infect / and corrupt with mede
Every heart / ought quake and dread
To se alas / by false Ypocrysye
Prestes that should / the world exemplefye
With good doctrine / of perfeccyon
To make so soon / a transmutacyon
Of double intent / so daynely to varye
For douteles / if the Seyntuarye
Be pollut found / in conuersacyon
Naked and bare / of devotion
And that the shynynge / of their parfyt light
Yturned be / by dyrkenesse unto night
Unto what place / shall men ferther go
To take example / what them ought to do
Certys the root / and ground of euerydele
Is coueytyse / who so look well
Of which the greyne / is so fer ysowe
That who so list / Auaryce to know
Among prestes / he shall it rathest find
For therwithall / they be made blind
To their estate / that they may not se
For in sothnesse / there is no degree
Gredyer / nor more rauynous
Of worldely good / more coueytous
That prestes be / to catch what they may
For it is gone / sithe many a day
That in their breast / fyxhed was the rote
Of coueytyse / which sit so sote
That no man may / arrace him nor remewe
For at their tail / ever it does them sewe
This false worm / mother and noryce
Of all myschefe / and of every vice
For gold is now / so shynynge and so bright
So persynge eke / and so clear of light
That prestes be / with his stemes blent
For in sothnesse / they be in their intent
Of coueytyse / very receptacle
And to possede / eke the tabernacle
Their heart is aye / so gredy to enbrace
That Auaryce / has his lodging place
Myd of their breast / this vice of vices all
That causes virtue / rather for to fall
Where he abyt / so he can supplaunte
Record I take / of the priest Tonaunte
That for treasour / to Anthenor has sold
The rich relyke / that he had in hold
Palladyon / while they of Troy town
Have gaderyd up / about euyrowne
Of rich and pore / thorugh out the cite
Gold and silver / an huge quantyte
Flower and whete / to pay their raunson
The which su^me / of entencyon
They made keep / wisely and conserve
In the temple / that longs to Mynerue
Purposynge after / of one affeccyowne
The Cytesens / thorugh out all the town
Hoping thereby / for to fare the bet
Upon a day / assygned and yset
To Appollo / in their paynem wise
Solempnely / make a sacryfyse
With slaughter of bestes / with encense and blood
On which day / when the prestes stood
In compass round / about the autere
And began to kyndle / the coals bright and clear
Upon the Autere / plainly as I read
To offer up / the bestes that were deed
In the flawme / and the great leven
To Appollo / stellefyed in heaven
When they to offer / were most laboryous
There befell / two things meruaylous
The first was / that the sacryde fire
Ne would brenne / like to her desire
Nor the flawme / up ascend alofte
Albe that they / assayed full often
More than ten times / and yet it ne would be
For aye it queynt / that they ne might se
Naught but smoky / resolucyons
Horrible and black / like exalacyons
Of new lyme / when that it is meynt
With water cold / and of his hete queynt
That they might / in no manner wise
For lack of fire / do their sacryfyce
For aye they found / a wonderful obstacle
And the next / was a more miracle
On their Auter / when they began to sprede
The entrayles / of bestes / that were deed
To queme Appollo / with flawmes bright and fair
There came anon / down out of the air
A royal Egle / full persynge of his look
And in his claws / the offrynge up he took
And the Entrayles / lyenge enuyrowne
In his descence / making such a sown
That none so hardy / of heart nor manhood
But that he was / astoned there he stood
And supprysed / thorugh nerfe and every vain
Of this marvel / and this case sudden
But the Egle / abiding there no more
Over the town / full hye began to sore
Toward greeks / enhastynge what he might
And on their shypes / sodaynely a light
And the Entrayles / of the bestes all
This Egle let / fro his claws fall
Whereof Troyans / when they took head
Disamayed / with a mortal dread
By signs have / clearly comprehendyd
That their gods / greatly were offendyd
Again the town / when the fire went out
And for they would / be put out of doubt
To be sure / what this marvel mente
To Cassandra / in all haste they went
Fully to have / declaracyon
And thereupon / plain exposycyon
And she told them / platly out of dread
That the quenchynge / of their fyres read
Was unto them / a demonstracyon
Both of ire / and indignacyon
That Appollo / has to Troy bore
For the blood / that was shad before
Of Achylles / in his temple slawe
Vengeably murdered / and ydrawe
Without any manner / reverence
Or honor done / to the excellence
Of Appollo / being there present
That the Phane / and plates adjacent
Were defoulyd / and pollut with the blood
Wherefore she said / shortly it was good
That they went / on prosessyon
With heart contryte / and devotion
To the toumbe / of Achylles at night
Oonly to fette / on their taprys light
Sacryd fire / brennynge at the wake
Fully in purpose / by assent to make
For his murdre / satissfaccyon
The which fire / by none occacyon
Shall not quench / but his flawmes hold
Thorugh none assaute / of stormy wyndes cold
The sacryfyce / upon the Autere
Tofore Appollo / brenne shall so clear
And they of Troy / wrought by her read
But of the Egle / she badde them take heed
That no thing was / but token oftreason
Pronostycke / and declaracyon
Finally how Troy / and Ylyon
Shall turn in haste / to destruccyon
For the flyenge / of this foul royal
Over the town / and the mighty wall
With his feathers / maylyd bright and she
And the Entrayles / in his claws kene
To troy was / a fynall demonstraunce
Sothfaste showing / and sygnefyaunce
That grace and Ewer / and hap of old Fortune
By lyklyhede / might not contune
Nor persevere / in their first light
For all attones / they have take their flight
Palladyon / might them not withholde
That stole was / like as I you told
For no man may / his fatal chance refuse
And Greeks eke / fast began to muse
And inwardly / in theyrwyttes sought
Of the Entrayles / that the Egle brought
And thereupon / began togydre rowne
Till yt Calchas / did every thing expowne
And unto them / full began assure
That the fine / of this adventure
Conclude should / upon their welfare
And bad also / for no cost they spare
To persevere / and be of heart stable
By Fortune / them self to enhable
Them counsayllynge / to do their besy pain
Solempnely / in haste to ordain
A certain offrynge / borne out of the field
To fair Pallas / with her Cristall shield
And to her make / a rich sacryfyse
As the storye / by order shall deuyse.
Bishop Calchas / with his locks hoar
Traitor forsworn / sith go full yore
That falsed has / troth and his aliau^ce
Whom Clerks / have put in remembrance
In their locks / with letters old and new
To exemplefye / no man to be untrue
For though years / pass fast aweye
Rust of sclaundre / lightly will not deye
The fret thereof / is so corrosyfe
That it lasts / full many man's life
And is full hard / to arrace away
Of whose venym / full selde is made allaye
Report thereof / blown is so wide
Perpetuelly / that it will abide
Remembered new / and fresshely had in mind
Record of him / that could away find
Old Calchas / evil mut he sterue
Under color / of offrynge to Mynerue
To make Greeks / enter into town
This sleyghty serpent / Fader and patrowne
And fyndre up / of treason and of gyle
Compassyd has / and I found a wyle
How greeks shall / the Cite win and take
Pretendynge them / sacryfyce to make
Unto Pallas / as I shall express
For this traytoure / meroure of falsenesse
The Greeks bad / for to do their pain
To Mynerua / an offrynge to feign
And in all haste / that they should them speed
And of assent / they did make a stead
Large and wide / of Coper and of bras
By craft of synon / that contryued was
That it might receive / large and well
A thousand knights / armed bright in steel
Thorugh the sleyghte / and the compassynge
The sotyll wit / and meruayllous workynge
Of this wise / and crafty greek Synon
Which thorugh his casting / and discrecyon
Parformed has / this rich stead of bras
As ye have herd / by bidding of Calchas
And by the advise / of Appyus the wise
That help also / the stead to deuyse
To fine oonly / that of deuocyowne
Greeks might / requere of the town
When it were made / to grant them license
It present / in the reverence
Of mighty Pallas / in steel armed bright
Amyd her temple / large and full of light
By the offrynge / to find occasyowne
To have enter / freely into town
By pilgrimage / their vows to fulfylle
In which stead / daren shall full stylle
A thousand knights / as Calchas by deuyse
Ordained has / that was so slye and wise
By craft / of Synon / and of Appyus
This large stead / of making meruayllous
Under pretense / of oblacyon
Was complete full / to his perfeccyon
Of werkemanshype / as I told before
The same year / that Troy was forlore
When the sege / sothly began to fine
And the Cite / was brought to Ruin
Thorugh greeks might / and the wall strong
Were beat down / large thycke and long
The which year / as made is mencyowne
Alytell before / taking of the town
Kings echone / that came fro so far
Alive left / after the mortal werre
When they saw / how Pryam by covenant
Unto Greeks / that utterly made grant
All haste possible / to pay his raunsowne
They took leave / and went out of the town
And first I find / how king Phylymene
With him ladde / the body of the queen
'Pantasyllia / home to her country
Full rychely / there to buried be
And of.ij. thousand knights / yt this king.
Brought unto Troy / first at his coming
No mo than fyfty / home with him he ladde
And of women / that the queen eke had
Of a thousand / the storye says certain
But four hundred home again
And thus / when all were fro Troy gone
The morrow next / Pryamus anon
With his lords / rode out of the town
As was the acorde / for confirmacyowne
Of Peace fynall / upon outher side
And in the field / Greeks him abide
And on relykes / openly yborne
There they were / on outher party sworn
On the form / to you before recordyd
As Anthenor / with greeks was accordyd
And for greeks / first swore Dyomede
They of Troy / taking little head
How the oath was / in condycyon
Curyd above / under false treason
Sithe greeks / tho in their swerynge
Ne bound them self / to no manner thing
To stand to / as in special
But for to hold / and keep in general
The points hole / engrossyd and no more
In thylke treat / that dau^z Anthenore
With greeks held / this traitor fraudulent
In which they were / full double of intent
Meynt with treason / as ye have herd toforne
Which to observe / oonly they were sworn
By fraud of oath / and not by words plain
Their aduer saryes / to take in a Train
Excludynge them / from their meaning far
Peace in the face / but in the heart werre
All openly confermed / with their hand
Inly to treason / by assurance of bond
But though the venym / was closyd with a wall
It was not hyd / fro him that knows all
For certaynely / so as clerks teache
Who that swereth / falsely in his speech
Flourysshynge outward / by a fair color
For to deceive / his true neighbor
He is forsworn / what so ever he be
The treason hyd / though men may not se
How so the word / be away yborne
Who swereth by craft / is by craft forsworn
There may be made / none excusacyon
For god that knows / the entencyon
Demeth the heart / and the word right naught
For he the will / knows and the thought
Of every man / nyghe and eke a fere
Therefore beware / no man him forswere
As Greeks did / Troyans to deceive
That the fraud / could not conceive
Supposing that / Greeks had be
Faithful and true / of their surete
But no thing on / they in heart thought
Which in the end / they full dear abought
When they found / fully the reuerse
And to their speech / the deed so diverse
It were but vain / by and by to write
Their feigned oaths / nor their words white
Nor the cherys / that they could feign
But to conclude / with the queen Eleyne
During the treat / upon the same day
Delyueryd was / to king Menelay
And after that / was paid the raunsowne
Granted tofore / and gaderyd in the town
Gold and silver / where also and flower
And to their ships / with dylygent labor
In full great / haste every thing was brought
Where thorugh the Cite / after came to naught
And greeks than / by symulacyon
Making a color / of devotion
Thorugh holiness / under Ypocrysye
Falsely feigned / by fraud and flatery,
The king have prayed / to have lyberte
Freely to Enter / into the Cite
To make asseth / by oblacyon
For the theft / of Palladyon
And offer up / the rich stead of bras
To the gods / that called is Pallas
What king Pryam / lyketh to assygne
That she to them / be wyllnge and benygne
In their repeyre / saylynge by the sea
Home into Greece / toward their country
When she is quemyd / with his large stead
Of which alas / Pryam took no head
The treason hyd / he could not aduerte
But granted them / with all his hole heart
When that them list / to bring it into town
By false entysynge / and suggestyowne
Of Anthenor / and also of Enee
Having no dread / nor ambygnytee
In his intent / nor suspeccyon
Nouther of fayngynge / nor of false treason
But right frendely / like to his beheste
Condescendeth / unto their request
Their auowes / that they might observe
To offer up / this horse unto Mynerue
And greeks tho / with great dylygence
Full great honor / and huge reverence
Have shapen them / with processyowne
To bring the stead / into Troy town
The men of arms / being aye thein
By whom they call / Troy for to win
In short time / for it stood on the date
And when this horse / brought was to the gate
It was so narowe / that there was no space
For the stead / into town to pace
Albe that they / assayed over all
Whefore Pryam / bet a down the wall
To make it large / right at their deuyse
In which thing alas / he was unwise
For cause che^e / of his confusyowne
Was that this horse / came into the town
But humbly / forth they began proceed
To the temple / with this large stead
And to Pallas / mekely down knelynge
All attones / they made there offrynge
With feigned chere / and false deuocyowne
Whereof in heart / glad was all the town
And special / they that were of Troy
But sothe is said / that aye the fine of joy
Who occupyeth / as men full often se
For unawarely / comes aduersyte
After gladness / and mysauenture
When men best wene / for to ston de sure
In worldly blysshe / is none affyaunce
So diverse is / his unhappy chance
Full of deceyte / ever meynt with trouble
And for to trust / varyaunt and double
And selde in one / abiding any throw
For worldly lust / though it be now blow
With pomp and pride / and with bost and sown
Anon it passes / record of Troy town
That wend well / by this rich stead
To have be sure / and deuoyde of dread
Perpetuelly / as I have told tofore
But when greeks / have this horse ybore
Tofore Pallas / as ye have herd me tell
Them lyketh not / longer for to dwell
In the bounds / of this mighty town
But of purpose / to the Greek Synowne
They have committed / hole the gouernayle
Of this stead / the which will not fail
When he sees best / opportunyte
By his engyne / to traysshe the Cite
And Greeks have / in this while found
A new sleyghte / them fully to confound
This to say / they have made their sonde
To king Pryam / they would go fro land
Unto the sea / toward Tenedowne
And thither sail / for this conclusyowne
For that Eleyne / by good a^ysement
In secret wise / thither shall be sent
For they dradde / if upon the land
She were delivered / shortly to their hand
Greeks would of malys / do their pain
The more party / to slay this Eleyne
For she was ground / and gynnynge of their woe
The very root / and the cause also
Of the slaughter / of many worthy man
Sythen the ryme / the sege first began
Wherefore they said / for to stynte all strife
And to be sure / for to save her life
The best was / to lend her out of sight
Secretly / to Tenedowne by night
Thus they feigned / of full false treason
Pryam to put / from all suspeccyon
Alkaunce they would / after never their live
Resort again / with Troy for to strive
Thus they made / Pryam for to wene
But in the hand / he was deceived clean
Of their deceyte / knowing never / adele
For in his heart / he thought not but well
Granting them / all that might them please
And when they had / at leyser and good ease
Fro Troyesayled / unto Tenedowne
With theyrnauye / the false greek Synowne
In Troy / wakergan to take keep
The hour when men / were in their first sleep
And in all haste / with his sleyghty gynne
Many vyse / and many sotyll pynne
In the stead / he made about gone
The crafty lokes / undoing euerychone
And out he goth / and began anon to call
Within the horse / the worthy knights all
So secretly / no man might espy
And traytoursly / he began him for to hye
Upon the walls / the self same night
And toward greeks / began to show a light
Where as they lay / tofore Tenedowne
Ready armed / to fall upon the town
And when they had / this sudden light espied
On horse back / anon they have them hyed
Toward Troy / armed clean at all
And in they went / by the same wall
Which for the horse / was but late broke
And mortally / for to be a wroke
The knights eke / in the stead of bras
Have with them met / a full stern paas
And began anon / thorugh out the Cite
On every half / for to kylle and slay
With blody sword / upon every side
And made their wounds / broad large and wide
While they alas / no thing aduertynge
At mydnyght hour / a dedde lay slepynge
Full innocent / and thought not but good
All for bathed / in the yrowne blood
Both man and child / without excepcyon
The Greeks sparynge / no condcyon
Of old nor young / woman wife nor maid
That with the cry / Pryamus abrayde
Out of his llepe / and sodaynely a woke
Which lay all night / and no head ne took
Of the daughter / nor murdre in the town
But tho he wyste / that there was treasowne
Falsely compassyd / unto his cytee
By Anthenor / and also by Enee
Of whose malys / he was no more in doubt
For the venym / was now broken out
And now the galle / of conspyracyon
That under sugre / of symulacyon
Has so louge / closyd be and hyd
In deed is now / execute and kyd
And now the fraud / fully of treason
The cast also / of false collusyon
Be taked out / and abroad yblowe
And the Autours / openly yknowe
Now has envy / and contryued hate
Of their Engyne / set abroad the gate
Now has deceyte / and old conspyracye
And feigned oaths / all of one allye
Openly showed / their falsenesse
And disclosed / all their doubylnesse
So far abroad / that now is there no geyne
For now alas / the wild fire is seyne
In toures hye / with the wind yblased
Whereof Pryam / astoned and amassed
All awapyd / sterte out of his bed
And comforteles / to the temple is fled
Of Appollo / to save him if he might
And aye the flawme / of the fyres bright
Brent in the town / and cousumeth all
The rich byldynge / whylom so royal
That the walls / with their rofes huge
Coueryd with led / for a chief refuge
Were now alas / bare and bareyne makyd
The greeks aye / with their swerdes nakyd
Murdre and slay / where so that they go
That twenty thousand / that night and mo
They killed have / long or it was day
And in this slaughter / and this great affray
Spoil and rob / and take what they find
Treasour / and good / and left not behind
By mighty hand / and sturdy vyolence
And the temples / without reverence
They have despoyled / thorugh out all ye town
And gredely rent / and racyd down
Of gold and silver / the ornaments all
Totore the gods / foul mote them fall
King Pryam aye / with a deedly chere
To Appolio / making his prayere
Furyously / this hertely woeful man
As he in soth / that no read ne can.
BUt wait his death / and his fatal Eure
And Cassandra / that holy creature
Of in ward woe / desirous to sterue
Complaining / ran unto Mynerue
Making to her / a lamentacyowne
With other gentle women / of the town
And there alas / as they would dye
Full pyteously / they sobbe weep and cry
And in their dooll / there I let them dwell
For all their sorrows / if I should tell
In this storye / and their woe descryue
My pen should / of very routhe ryue
Rehersynge eke / how in every street
Their clothes black / ready / moist and wete
As they alas / both one and all
On their lords / down aswowne fall
With their blood bedewed / and ysprent
Where men may se / the cristall terys meynt
Of their weeping / in their wounds grene
That lay and blede / again the son shene
With deedly iyen / casting up the white
It were but vain / all here to write
Nor the manner / of their mortal sorrow
But Guydo wryt / that the same morrow
How Anthenor / and with him false Enee
Conueyued have / thorugh out the Cite
The mighty Greeks / unto Ylyon
The royal toure / and rich mansyon
That whylom was / of most excellence
In the which / they found no diffence
Of hye nor low / nor of none estate
For it was left / alone desolate
With all the gold / and richesse of the twone
Shet and enclosed / in the chief dongeowne
But for there was / no man that withstode
They brake the locks / and raught away ye good
And the treasour / that was shet within
Each for his party / that he might wyn
They gave no force / who was lefe or loathe
And Pyrrus after / to the temple goth
Of Appollo / by great cruelte
And fill on Pryam / knelynge on his kne
And with his sword / furyously and wode
Tofore the auter / shadde there his blood
So hye raughte / both in length and bread
That the stremes / of his wounds read
That the statue / of gold borned bright
Of this Appollo / for all his great might
For all his power / and his stern face
Defouled was / and pollut all the place
Oonly by death / of this worthy king
By Pyrrus slain / while he lay knelynge
Of old hatrede / and enuyous pride
While Anthenor / and Enee stood beside
That routhe was / and pity to behold
To sehym lie / on the stones cold
So pyteously / tofore the auter blede
Whereof alas / when Eccuba took head
And her daughter / fair Polycene
With here to rent / as any gold wire shene
Inly supprysed / with sorrow to the heart
When they began / consydre and aduerte
This noble king / with blody stremes read
All for drowned / his eyes dyrke and deed
With Pyrrus swerd / gyrt thorugh outher side
For mortal fere / they durst not abide
But inwardly / thorugh darted with the sight
All in a rage / took them to the flight
And yet in sothe / thorugh out the Cite
They wyste never / whytherwarde to flee
Rescuse was none / nor no remedy
Of kynne nor friend / nor of none allye
With greeks sword / the town was so be set
And in her flight / this woeful queen has met
Eneas / causer of all this wrake
Unto whom / rebukynge thus she spoke
O thou traitor / most malycyous
Thou false serpent / adder enuyous
Crope and root / fynder of falsenesse
Soures and well / of unkindness
How myghtest thou / in thy heart find
Unto thy king / to be so unkind
Gynner and ground / exaumple of treason
And fynall cause / of our destruccyon
How myghtest thou / deuoyde of all pity
Behold alas / thorugh thy cruelte
Of the king / shed so the blood
That ever has been / so gentle and so good
So gracyous lord / specially to the
And over more / thorugh his hye bounte
They honored / and ymagnefyed
All his live / it may not be denied
That lies now deed / in the temple alas
Thou were not oonly / traytoure in this caas
But to his death / conspyrynge and vukynde
Pyrrus conueyinge / where he should hy^ find
Tofore Appollo / mydes of this Cite
Where thou should / of very duete
Rather have been / his proteccyon
His mighty shield / and sauacyon
That haste this cite / and this town ylorne
In which thou were / fostryd and yborne
On the grettest / of reputacyon
Of all the lords / dwelling in this town
In which thou had / whylom most pleasau^ce
But all is now / out of remembrance
Yet in thy heart / if any drope be
Of gentyllesse / mercy or pity
In this deedly rage / full of tene
Rewe on my daughter / young Polycene
From greeks sword / her youth for to save
If thy heart / may any routhe have
Of manly pity / on her maydenhede
Diffende her now / and keep her out of dread
If thou canste / find any weye
In any wise / that she may not deye
That hereafter / when men se and read
The false treason / and the foul deed
That thou haste done / unto troy town
It may in party / be proteccyowne
To thy fame / the venym to allye
Of this treason / when men will assaye
By just report / thy name to accuse
This deed may / the help to excuse
Against tongues / that speak of Enee
Than will they say / thou had yet pity
On Polycene / oonly of gentyllesse
Therewith to sugre / all the bytternesse
Of thy decert / blow forth by fame
By rehersayle / of the foul blame
That shall of the / thorugh the world be borne
With sklaundre infect / when you art all to torn
That thou ne shall / the shame mow sustene
Than shall my daughter / fair Polycene
Be thy diffence / again such famous strife
If it so be / now thou save her life
Of me no forse / though thou make as blyue
The sword of greeks / thorugh my heart ryue
And so by prayer / of this woeful queen
This Eneas / took to him Polycene
Whose traitor heart / for all his cruelte
On her youth / was meued of pity
Oonly of routhe / that in his breast arose
And secretly / put her up in close
List that Greeks / found occasyon
Against him / and Ayax Thelamon
Took to his ward / Andronomecha
Actors wife / and wise Cassandra
Out of the Temple / longing to Mynerue
From Greeks sword / their lives to conserve
And Menelay / took the queen Eleyne
Into his Guard / for whom so great a pain
Bode in his heart / many day toforne
By whom alas / the Cite is now lorne
And greeks aye / were besy in their ire
To slay and kylle / and cruelly to fire
On every side / and to beat down
Paleys and house / and walls of the town
They spare naught / for all goth to the fire
So fervent hate / brent in their desire
Of old envy / avenged for to be
That they ne left / within the Cite
No thing vnbrent / and also Ylyowne
Was in this rage / turned up so down
There made were / none excepcyons
Oonly out take / the possessions
Of Anthenor / evil mote he fate
And Eneas / whom the greeks spare
As they to them / were vounde by their oath
And thus the greeks / furyous and wrouthe
Have all that day / robbed and ybrent
Till that the king / Agamenon has sent
For his lords / to assemble yfere
In Pallas temple / oonly for to here
Their wise advise / upon things twain
First if they would / hold and not feign
Hoolly their hope / without excepcyowne
To them by whom / they won first the town
And over more / he axed them also
Touching the gods / what they would do
With gold treasour / and possessyowne
That they have won / through their hye renown^
And they answered / without more tariynge
They would their faith / keep in every thing
As they were sworn / and hestys hold
And over this / they said how they would
That gold treasour / and good of the Cite
As right requires / and also equity
Be justly partyd / by dyuysyon
To every wight / made distrybucyon
Like his meryt / of hye / and low degree
And that the king / eke of reason se
Each to reward / after his labor
So as it longs / to a conqueroure
That no man have / matter to complain
And so they fylle / in speaking of Eleyne
Eueryche after / his oppynyon
And tofore all other / Ayax Thelamon.
Shortly said / she has deserved death
For whom so many / have yield up the breath
Plainly affermynge / there in Parliament
Of rightwysnesse / and true Judgment
She should not escape / with the life
That gynnynge was / and cause of all their strife
Rote and ground / of all their sorrow and woe
And so said eke / many a another mo
And for the noise / and the great affray
Agamenon / nor king Menelay
Ne durst a word / for her party meue
To save ye queen / list greeks would them grieve
Against them / there was so great rumor
Till Vlixes / chefely / her socour
Thorugh his wit / and his eloquence
His deuer did / and his dylygence
To save her life / and fully to purchase
Of the greeks / for to get her grace
And as Guydo / also does us lere
Agamenon / Greeks began requere
To grant him / for a chief guerdo^
Of Cassandra / to have possessyon
All her life / with him to abide
Eke Eneas / and Anthenor beside
Of Elenus / to the Greeks told
How to the werre / he never assent would
And how that he / prudent and virtuous
In counsayllynge / was contraryous
To all tho / of hye and low estate
In Troy first / that began debate
At wixe greeks / and this mighty town
Eke by his help / and medyacyowne
Achylles / was buried and ygraue
The deed corpse / from hounds for to save
When he was slain / in full cruel wise
By night time / as ye have herd deuyse
For sothly he / and Cassandra both
Of this murdre / in heart were full wroth
And sorry eke / of many another thing
Wrought in the town / without their wyttynge
And for they were / of malys Innocent
The Greeks have / fully by assent
Granted to them / a prerogatyfe
By Parliament / for to have their life
But Elenus / first in teers drowned
Tofore the king / pyteously has swowned
And abraydynge / with a deedly face
In humble wyle / besought him of his grace
Of knyghtly pity / to have his aduertence
To spare his sword / fro blood of Innocence
And of mercy / that he not disdain
To grant life / to the sons twain
Of worthy Ector / his brother most entere
And eke to rewe / on their mother dear
Oonly of grace / that she be not deed
A wydowe left alone / and can no read
And wot not whyther / that she may dyuerte
And so the king / ameued in his heart
Of his words / and his woeful chere
Benygnely / granted his prayere
And gave eke life / and fredam for to go
To the mother / and her children two
And to ladies / and gentle women all
That for mercy / to his grace call
He granted eke / of compassyon
A safe conduyt / and a fre pardon
Where that them list / in the town abide
Or in the country / adjacent beside
He put it hole / in their eleccyowne
And thanking hy^ / they fill on knees down
With many tere / dewed in the face
And so the king / parts fro the place
And after that / greeks right anon
Fully purpose / to ship for to gone
In haste to sail / toward their country
But such a tempest / rose up in the sea
Of wawe and wind / also of clouds blake
All a month / that they dare not take
The water salt / for dread of Neptunus
Of very Ire / and also Golus
Was unto them / in every thing contrary
That on the land / made them long tarry
The sea was aye / so fell and bolyinge
Till that greeks / of Clachas enquerynge
By one assent / what it might be
That ever in one / so diverse was the sea
In his rage / both at eve and morrow
And he answered / god give him evil sorrow
This old shrewe / with all his prophesye
That can so well / when him list to lie
How this tempest / caused was at all
By the gods / and furyes infernal
That never would / appese nor be stylle
Till the murdre / platly / of Achylle
Avenged be / and shedynge of his blood
For which he said / Appollo was eke wode
For his temple / to him consecrate
Was thorugh his death / in Troy vyolate
By blood / again be made satysfaccyon
Wherefore there must / thorugh redempcyon
Of her that was root / in special
Thorugh her beauty / and orygynall
Cause of his death / young Polycene
And gynnynge first / of his mortal tene
Therefore to Appollo / she might up offered be
By sacryfyce / to please his deyte
With death again / to make recompense
Right as by death / first was the offense
This greeks must / utterly fulfill
If they desire / for to have at will
The large see / to sail in quyete
And Pyrus / tho in a Furyous hete
Began enquere / about of every man
For Polycene / but no wight tell can
Of her a word / nor shortly where she was
Saufe some said / how that Eneas
And Anthornor / had hyd her pryuely
Whereof there rose / among them sodaynely
Such a grutchynge / of greeks all about
Of their life / that they were in doubt
So inwardly / this thing they took at grefe
Till Anthenor / god give him evil prefe
That may of treason / as wardeyne bear ye keye
To show out / his malys every weye
So long has sought / till in a chaumbre old
He has her found / and the greeks told
And brought her forth / unto their presence
By cruel force / and hateful vyolence
Without pity / or compassion
And her delyueryd / to Agamenon
And he alas / by hasty Judgment
Without respyte / or auysement
Shortly has dempte / that she shall be deed
That was flourynge / in her maydenhede
And for to do / excepcyon
She was assygned / by Agamenon
Unto Pyrrus / and he of Tyranny
Ladde her forth / and fast began him hye
To the place / where she should deye
Great was the prease / that in the weye
Began Croude and shoue / to behold and seen
This young maid / fair Polycene
That for her beauty / and her semlynesse
Her womanhede / and excellent fayrenesse
Of all yfere / when they took head
They had routhe / that she shall be deed
Without gylte / or any more trespace
Where men may se / upon many face
The salt terys / fast fall down
Of very pity / and compas^yowne
For man nor child / was none so hard of heart
But he felt / for her sake smerte
Her goodly face / when they behold and se
And feign would / if it might have be
Delivered her / of very force anon
From Pyrrus ho^de / but for they wend echone
Without her death / never to have repair
Into Greece / nor the weder fair
As Calchas had / made suggestyon
And brought them all / in oppynyon
And at the last / when this Polycene
Of deed and will / a very maid clean
Was to the grave / of Achylles brought
She kneleth down / and with an humble thought
Cast up her Eye / and began syghe often
And to the gods / humbly and soft
With dreadful heart / and devotion
Made in this wise / her lamentacyon.
OYe almighty / yt in this world govern
And every thing / consydre and discern
By whom this world / so huge large and round
Both eyer and see / heaven and eke the ground
At your deuyse / with a word was wrought
And soth fastly / know every thought
Right as it is / of every manner wight
Without lettynge / so persynge is your sight
That no thing is / concelyd nor ywrye
From the beholdynge / of your eternal eye
And every thing / may attones se
Upon my soul / have mercy and pity
And of your grace / and benygne cure
Upon my woo / and pyteous adventure
Have some routhe / now that I shall deye
My woeful spirit / to lead and conueye
Where as you list / now that I shall pace
For unto you / in this self place
I me confess / with all humylyte
That hethertowarde / I have in chastyte
Lade all my life / and kept my maydenhede
In your seruyse / both in thought and deed
In port in chere / and in countenance
Or for feture / of any dalyaunce
With one mysloke / I never yet abrayde
So that in sothe / I dye shall a maid
As ye well know / of sin all innocent
Though I be now / dempt by Judgment
For to be deed / without gylte at all
Witness on you / that be inmortall
Clean of intent / of that I am accusyd
And yet alas / I may not be excusyd
But that the sword / of vengeance mustebyte
Routheles / which am no thing to wit
But stand clear / and pure of all offense
And discharged / in my conscience
I dare afferme / and fully gylteles
Touching / the murdre of worthy Achylles
Which slew my brother / and after louyd me
And is now cause / of mine aduersyte
And yet in will / deed / word / nor thought
Unto his death / assentaunt was right naught
But thereof / was right sorry in my heart
Albe that / I may not now asterte
For to be deed / oonly for his sake
On me alone / vengeance shall be take
Without mercy / in full cruel wise
With my blood / to make sacryfy^e
To the gods / their wrath for to queme
O people blind / in sothe amys ye deem
Against me / your heart is so cruel
To mercyles / to Yrous and to fell
Without routhe / to mykell Indurate
To slay a maid / alone desolate
Out of your heart / alas pity is gone
Harder in truth / than outher stock or stone
And more cruel / in your oppynyon
Forlacke of pity / than Tygre or Lion
Certes ye be / greatly for to blame
And ought thereof / for to have great shame
To assent / to so foul a deed
To slay a maid / quakynge in her dread
And grant her none / oportunyte
For to be weep / her virgynyte
That of this cruel / and this pyteous wreche
My blood / your gylte / hereafter shall apeche
And accuse also / your great envy
To the gods / that shall iustefye
Every unright / both of hye and low
Full egally / and make to be know
The truth plainly / spare and no degree
But make open / that is now secree
I say not this / nor my self complain
To have reders / of my fatal pain
For death is now / more welcome unto me
Than is my life / and more I take at gree
Sythen my brether / most worthy of renown
Be slain all / and buried in this town
My Fader deed / in his un weldy age
And I alone / left in all this rage
And have abide / pyteously to se
Fynall ruin / now of this Cite
Which at my heart / sytteth now so sore
That lever I have / than to weep more
Dye attones / in reles of my woo
Sithe all my kynne / is passed and agoo
Longer to live / were to me a death
For better is here / to yield up the breath
Than to be lad / out of this Cite
Among strangers / to live in pouerte.
O Death welcome / and longer let
Thy dredefull darte / to fyle and to whette
My tender heart / therewith all to ryue
Again thy might / I shall never strive
Now is time / to kythe thy powere
On me that am / of will and heart entere
A clean maid / so as I began
Without touch / of any manner man
In all my life / to this same day
This little auaunt / make yet I may
In mine end / to the gods all
After whose help / now I clyppe and call
And to their mercy / mekely I commend
My woeful spirit / and pray them that they send
To every maid / better hap and grace
Than I have now / and a longer space
In hertely joy / and honor to contune
Without assaute / of any infortune
To lead their life / in prosperyte
And all maidens / remembers upon me
To take exaumple / how ye shall you keep
And that ye would / a few terys weep
When that ye think / upon Polycene
That was of age / and of years grene
When she was slain / by cruel adventure
And to the gods / for to have in cure
My dreadful ghost / hoolly I betake
Eternally / and thus an end I make
And with yt word / her head she began enclyne
Full humbly / when she should fine
And of her eyes / held the ledes down
And Pyrrus than / wodder than lion
Dismembered has / with his sharp sword
This maid young / dredefull and a ferde
And over more / his cruelte to show
On pieces small / he has her all to hew
Endelonge / his Faders sepulture
Alas how might / his cruel heart endure
Mercyles to do / so foul adede
I am astoned / sothely when I read
After her death / how it did him good
Like a tyrant / to cast abroad her blood
Or a Tygre / that can no routhe have
Round enuyrowne / about his Faders grave
He sprent of hate / and of cruelte
O thou Pyrrus / thou may full well ybe
Achylles sone / by lyneall descent
For like to him / of heart and of intent
Thou were in sothe / deuoyde of all pity
And werse than he / yet in one degree
For of thy Fader / in all his living
Ne radde I never / yet so foul a thing
Though I would / of hatrede him abrayde
For no rancoure / that ever he slew amayde
I find well / that he had his part
Whylom in love / of Cupydes darte
That made him sore / in his live smerte
When that he was / wounded to the heart
With the casting / oonly of an Eye
Wenynge thereby / wystly for to deye
He might not / the sudden stroke escape
And afterward / as his fate has shape
He murdered was / for the love of Polycene
Whom thou haste slain / in thy cruel tene
Furyously / without routhe or shame
For which thing / the foul hateful fame
Thorugh all the world / hereafter shall be sprede
When this storye / rehersyd is and read
Than shall be said / that Pyrrus routheles
Slew in his ire / a maid gyltles
And woryed shall / thy name most odyble
Be for this deed / passyngly horrible
For love oonly / of fair Polycene
The death of whom / when Eccuba the queen
Has seen alas / as she beside stood
For very woe / began to wexe wode
And for sorrow / out of her wit she went
And her clothes / and her here she rent
All in a rage / and wot not what she does
But began anon / with hondes and with toth
In her Furye / crache and eke byte
Stones cast / and with fystes smite
Whom she met / till greeks made her bind
And sent her forth / also as I find
Into an Isle / to Troy partynent
Where she was slain / oonly by Judgment
Of the Greeks / and stoned to the death
And when she had / yield up the breath
This woeful queen / by cruel adventure
The Greeks did make / a Sepulture
Ceryously / of metal and of stone
And took the corpse / and buried it anon
With great honor / and solempnyte
That long after / men there might se
The rich toumbe / costfull and royal
There set and made / for a memoryall
Of Eccuba / whylom of great fame
And after gave / to that place a name
And called it / to be long in mind
Locus in festus / in Guydo as I find
And thus the queen / oonly for sorrow wode
When her daughter / had shadde her blood
Of greeks stone / did her end make
As ye have herd / plainly for the sake
Of Polycene / whylom by Calchas
Unto Appollo / falsely offryde was
By Pyrrus sword / Achylles auengynge
To make the sea / calm and blandysshynge
That the gods / take no vengeance
Upon Greeks / that an evil chance
Come to this false / gods euerychone
And their statues / of stocks and of stone
In which the serpent / and the old snake
Satan him self / began his dwelling make
And fraudently / folks to illude
Full sotyll / can him self include
In images / for to make his hold
That forgyd be / of silver and of gold
That by error / of false illusyon
He has ybrought / to confusyon
Thorugh myscreau^ce / ye worthy kind of man
Sithe time / that alder first began
The false honor / of ydolatrye
And the worship / unto Maumetrye
By sacryfyse / of bestes and of blood
To apese them / when that they are wode
And to queme / both at eve and morrow
I pray to god / give them all sorrow
Where so they be / within or without
I none except / of the false route
Saturn / nor Mars / Pallas / nor Juno
Iubyter / Mercurius / nor Pluto
Nouther Flora / that does the flowers sprede
Nouther Bachus / with grapes white and ^ede
Nor Cupydo / with his Eyes blind
Nouther Daphne / closyd under rynde
Thorugh Tellus might / of the laurer tree
Nor thou Dyane / with thy chastytee
Mighty Venus / nor Cytherea
With thy darts / nor Proserpyna
That lady art / deep down in hell
Nor Belydes / that draws at the well

Nor with thine appyll / thou cruel Tantalus
Nor the Furyes / that be infernal
Nor ye that spynne / the lives threde fatal
Upon the rock / of every manner man
Nor the Muses / that so sing can

That gods be / of wood and wilderness
Nor other gods / nouther more nor less
As Morpheus / that is the god of sleep
I hold him wood / that takes any keep
To do to them / any obseruaunce
He may not fail / for to have myschaunce
At the end / plainly for his mede
For all such feyned falsenesse / out of dread
Rose of the devil / and first by his engyne
And of his sleyghty / Treynes serpentyne
Oonly mankind / when he made loute
To false ydoles / the which out of doubt
Are but deuylles / Dauyd bears witness
In the sautre / where he wryt express
And confermeth / there as he endytes
How the gods / of Paganysme rytes
One and all / he excepteth none
Be made of gold / of silver and of stone
Forged of brass / of metal and of tree
And eyes have / and yet they may not se
And all at fendes / so as Dauyd says
That who in them / haueth any faith
Hope credence / or in them delight
It is no dread / that they will him quyte
With such guerdon / as the soul sleeth
Perpetuelly / so that the fine is death
Of their seruyse / when men hense pace
And in their life unhap / and evil grace
Myschefe and woo / and confusyowne
As men may se / exaumple by this town
That wend well / assured for to have be
And to have stand / in long prospyryte
Again their foon / thorugh help of Appollo
Of Venus eke / and favor of Juno
Thorugh Pallas might / Dyane and Mynerue
Whom they were wont / to honor and serve
With Cerymonyes / and with sacryfyce
As ye tofore / have herd me deuyse
That them have brought / now unto ruin
By cruel death / in a bed them to fine
Here may ye se / how the venym bytes
At the end / of such old rytes
By euydence / of this noble town
What may avail / now Palladyowne
What may now help / their frauded fantasye
Of all their old / false Ydolatrye
Alas alas / they bought it all to sore
Now farewell Troy / farewell for evermore
Farewell alas / to cruel was thy fall
Of the no more / now I write shall
For thy sake / forsothe when I take heed
Of inward woo / my heart I feel blede
And when that I / remember in my thought
By ruin / how thou art brought to naught
That whylom were / so noble and so rich
That in this world / I trow none was lyche
Nor perrygall to speak / of fayrenesse
To speak of knyghthode / or of worthynesse
As clerks say / that thy byldynge knew
That all the world / ought for to rewe
On thy pyteous / waste walls wild
Whylom so royal / when men began to bylde
Thy toures hye / and king Pryamus
The first began / most rich and glorious
And set his see / in noble Ylyon
O who can write / a lamentacyon
Conuenyent / O troy for thy sake
Thy great myschefe / to complain and cry
Certes I trow / not old Ieremye
That so be wept / the captyuyte
Of thylke noble / royal chief Cite
Jerusalem / and his destruccyon
With all the hole / transmygracyon
Of the Jews / nor thou Ezechyell
That were that time / when the myschefe fell
Unto the king / ycalled Sedeclye
In Babylon / and for thy prophesye
With stones were / cruelly yslawe
Nor he that was / departed with a saw
Ye both two / that could so complain
Nor Danyell / that felt so great pain
For the kings / transmutacyon
Into a best / till thorugh the oryson
Of Danyell / he restored was
To mind again / and ete no more gras
Yet verily / though ye all three
With your weeping / had a live be
And present eke / at the destruccyowne
Of this noble / worthy royal town
To have bewailed / the myschefe and the woe
And the slaughter / at the sege do
On outher party / in full cruel wise
All your terys / might not suffyse
To have bewept / their sorrows euerychone
By treason wrought / as well as by their sone
Hereof no more / for it may not avail
But like as he / that gynneth for to sail
Again the wind / when the maste does ryue
Right so it were / but in vain to strive
Again the face / bytterer than galle
By the vengeance / upon Troy fall
Nor to presume / their Furyes sharp whette
Ceryously / in this book to set
So great a thing / I dare not under take
But even here / a pyteous end I make
Of the sege / after my symplesse
And though my style / be blotted with rudeness
As of meter / be rusty and vnfyled
The fourth book / that I have complied
With humble hand / of dread y^ does me quake
Unto your grace / hoolly I betake
Of your mercy / no thing in dispeyre
So as I can / making my repeyre
To the Greeks / and no longer dwell
Their auentures / of the sea to tell
In their resort / home to their country
And how that they / there received be
Oonly of supporte / so ye not despise
The fyfthe Book / shortly shall deuyse.
Here begins the fyfth Book of Troy the which speaks how the Greeks
returned into Greece after the dystruccyon / And how they were perysshed
almost all in the sea / And after they that escaped dyed myscheuously.
Capitulo. xxxvi.
When Eolus / which does ye wy^des rore
Apesed was / that he blewe no more
Which is of stormys / governor and lord
And was also / fully of accord
Which mighty Juno / lady of the air
Tomake the sky / and the weder fair
That cloud none / in heaven did appear
And Neptunus blaundysshynge of chere
Was of assent / the storye says for sothe
To make the sea / fro tempest calm and smothe
Without boyllynge / or trouble of any wawe
The mighty greeks / to shypward began the^ draw
For to repeyre / home to their country
After they had / won the Cite
Put their fomen / fully at the werse
But Fortune / aye froward / and perverse
Has with their merthe / meynt aduersyte
For when they wend / full assuryd be
And have stand / stedefaste in quyete
This vlynde lady / falsely made flete
Into the yrsugre galle / of discordaunce
Among them self / to bring in varyaunce
And their hertes / of rancour and of pride
Contagyously / to seueryne and deuyde
When they sat / highest in their glory
With the palm / of conquest and victory
Fully reioysynge / thorugh their hye renown
The crown of laurer / in possessyowne
And had also / at their lust all won
When bryghtest shone / the lusty fresshe son
From Eest to west / of their worthynesse
A clowdy sky / unawarely with derkenesse
Eclypsed has / a party of their light
And diffacyd the wholesome / bemys bright
Of their welfare / and prosperyte
By the enuyous / false contagyouste
Of the serpent / pompouse and ellat
Among them self / tomake them at debate
Indusynge in / rancoure and discord
For or they enter / within ships board
Again vlixes / worthy Thelamon
In presence / of king Agamenon
Purposed has / plainly his matere
Tofore Greeks / anon as ye shall here.
SYres quod he / so it you not grieve
Me seems justly / of reason I may meue
Touching ye wy^nyng / and gettyng of this town
With gold richesse / and possessyowne
Fully delivered / and taken to our hand
With all the treasoure / found in the land
The which me thinks / in my inward sight
Ne has not ben departed / half a right
Among us / by just dyuysyon
Nor by egall / distrybusyon
Consydred first / by title of equity
Of every wight / the estate and dignyte
Remembered eke / in this sharp shoure
The worthyest / the merit / and labor
And decertys / in this mortal strife
Granting to eueryche / his prerogatyfe
Like Fortune / as he has deseruyd
But this order / has not be obseruyd
Among us / without excepcyon
In delyueraunce / of Palladyon
Which Vlixes / I say without dread
Tofore you all / unjustly does possede
On him usurping / by false oppynyon
By merytorye / retrybucyon
And appearance / his title for to ground
Under pretense / of color falsely found
That he this relyke / rejoice should of right
By sleyghte won / rather than of might
And usurps / by manner of a vaunt
As it were given / to him by grant
Of you echone / for a chief guerdon
But I will make / a replycacyon
That this relyke / is not to him mete
Which he shall not / rejoice in quyete
If that I may / distourbe him or let
For I it cleyme / duly of debt
As for guerdon / to me conuenyent
So that ye list / to be indifferent
Of reason oonly / as it does you seem
Atwene us two / Egally to deem
Justly first / with every circumstaunce
Out outher merit / weyed in ballaunce
First considered / forth fro day to day
All the while / that the sege lay
That ye should / of plente of vytayle
On no side / fro no myschefe fail
And if I shall / without auaunt out break
As of knyghthode / and arms for to speak
In the field / by long contynuaunce
Of manly Force / and perseueraunce
Upon our foon / that were so fell and kene
Day by day / I was armed clean
It needs not / to make mencyon
With my right hand / I slew Phylemon
As ye well know / which had in his keeping
The young sone / of Pryamus the king
Fresshe and lusty / and of great fayrenesse
And with him had / infynyte richesse
Of treasoure / gold / passyngly plente
And euerydele / was brought to you by me
If ye remember / and list take heed
That ye were quyte / of Indigence and need
By occasyon / of that great good
And thorugh my manhood / shad I not y^ blood
Mercyles / in full cruel wise
For your sake / of the king of Fryse
And the treasour / in his cofres sought
And all yfere / to the sege ybrought
And by my knyghthode / sithe go full yore
Have I not eke / augmented and made more
The Greeks land / with possessions
By conquest oonly / of two regyons
Thorugh my prudence / and my labor won
Sythen that ye / the sege first begone
With prouynces / to Troy adjacent
To your increase / I was so dylygent
And with Achylles / the worthy warryoure
Ye be expert / full well of my labor
What we wrought / to your advantage
And sythen ye so prudent / be and sage
Not foryetyll / but fully remembrynge
It needs not / rehearse every thing
And to dispreue / manly as a knight
His title and cleyme / that he has no right
The dome co^myttynge / to your oppynyons
By rehersayle / of his condycyons
He nouther has / manhood nor prowess
Force knyghode / nouther hardynesse
And at a point / for to have reward
In dorynge do / preued a cowarde
Experyence / has showed you in deed
How that he is / when it comes to need
But word and wind / and sleyghty co^passynge
And on falshode / ever imagining
For ever yet / to this day was preuyd
That any thing / was by him acheuyd
Which might be / entytled to his laud
But the end / medlyd were with fraud
For under color / he can cure all
Pretend fair / like a painted wall
Diverse hewed / that nouther hye nor low
There may no man / his plain meny^ge know
And with such sleyghte / co^passyd by treason
Out of Troy / he gat Palladyon
Which is great shame / and sclaundre to us all
For of our conquest / it is thus befalle
More of treason / we have the cite won
Than of knyghthode / as men report konne
And crop and rote / if I rehearse shall
Vlixes there / is ground and cause of all
And gynnynge first / of this unhappy fame
That reboundeth / to our alder shame
And sith the truth / is platly known and wyste
My tale is endyde / deem as ye list.
VLixes than / in his aduertence
Conceived has / the great inpacyence
Of Thelamon / and the great envy
The fervent rancoure / and melancolye.
Forbear him first / by full great advise
As he that was / full prudent and right wise
And thought he would / make thereof no iape
By no word for haste / that should escape
Nouther by none / unbridled countenance
Outward conceived / in his regardaunce
And abraydynge / with a stable face
Syres quod he / so I may have grace
Under supporte / of your hye presence
That my tale / may have audyence
I nouther am / in doubt nor in dread
Of equity / that I shall possede
Palladyon / during my lives day
Maugre the might / of who that say nay
For if ye list / of reason for to se
At the sege laid / first to this cite
I have my self / in double wise a quyt
As well by knyghthode / sothly as by wit
And thorugh my counsel / and my besy cure
Be often cause / of their discomfyture
Aye dylygent / to your advantage
Worught and compassyd / unto their damage
That to this day / in sothe ne had I be
They had floured / in their felycyte
In their force / contuned and welfare
And if that I / the truth shall not spare
If it be dempt / and lokyd of reason
I was most cause / of their confusyon
Who so ever / against it replye
How often went I / on embassatrye
With importable costs / and dispense
The treat aye / concludynge in sentence
To the forthrynge / of your entencyowne
And disencrease / and hyndrynge of the town
And when I saw / other mean none
In mine advise / and wits euerychone
By our force / the cite for to win
While they had / y^ relyke them within
Thereupon / so sotelly ywrought
That unto you / Palladyon ybrought.
Which Thelamon / that of malys stryueth
Of old hatrede / unto my gylt ascryueth
Hoolly this thing / y^ I have for you worught
But ye that be / so prudent in your thought
Aduerteth wisely / and an end makes
And in your hand / this quarrel fully takes
Palladyon justly / to provide
And all favor / let be laid a side
Sith all this thing / ye platly understand
And let us both / to your demynge stand
By one assent / how so the matter wend
Lo here is all / my tale is at an end
Than Thelamon / in Ire full fervent
Of hate / made inpacyent
And of envy / inwardly ameued
Vlixes has / dispyteously repreued
Oonly of malys / and of hye disdain
And Vlixes / rebukynge him again
Full bytterly / without abode anon
And so they twain / made full mortal fone
In the presence / of Agamenon
But furyously / Ayax Thelamon
Of melancolye / pale and nothing read
Thratte Vlixes / that he shall be deed
Of his hondes / he should it not eschew
And greeks tho / all rancour to remewe
This quarrel / put in arbytracyon
Of Menelay / and Agamenon
That caused after / a full mortal strife
For by sentence / anon diffynytyfe
They put Vlixes / in possessyon
Perpetuelly / of Palladyon
With him confermynge / to abide stable
And cause why / they were favorable
To Vlixes / like as Guydo / wryt
Was / for that he so goodly has him quyt
Unto Eleyne / at getting of the town
Being in cause / of her ^auacyon
Dispeyred / and of her life in dread
Greeks willing / to have had her deed
But thorugh his prudent / medyacyon
Maugre the might / of this Thelamon
He has the queen / fro the death preserved
Albe that she had / it well deserved
As Greeks said / in their oppynyon
And thus defrauded / of Palladyon
As ye have herd / was this worthy knight
For all his manhood / and his great might
Where thorugh there began / in his heart bread
Passing envy / and full great hatrede
And thought he would / avenged be some day
Upon Vlixes / and on Menelay
And eke also / upon Agamenon
And out he brake / like a wood lion
With his knights / about him y^ were strong
And said plainly / of this great wrong
For to be deed / he would avenged be
And specially / on this ylke three
And therwithall / Furyous and wroth
Tournynge his back / out anon he goth
In heart fret / with full mortal tene
With many greek / his quarrel to sustene
That in heart sore / began disdain
Again Vlixes / and the the other twain
But they full ware / what so ever fall
Their knights / made about them for to call
And with great stuff / where they wake or sleep
To awayte on them / and manly for to keep
With full good watch / enuyron all the close
But full erely / or the son arose
This worthy Ayax / in his bed vpryght
Ymurdred was / the self same night
And all be bledde / in the morrow found
Onpeces hew / with many mortal wound
That for this thing / cruel and horrible
To god and man / loathsome and odyble
Full many greek / that woeful morrow weep
To se a knight / so murdered in his sleep
That the cry / and the noise ran
Thorugh out the host / an one fro man to man
And for constreynt / of this foul deed
Eueryche of them / felt his heart blede
Full desirous / to make an ordinance
On this murdre / for to do vengeance
Having thereof / great suspecyon
To Menelay / and Agamenon.
But to Vlixes / most in special
By common voice / to him arrettynge all
The foul fame / he might not asterte
But Pyrrus most / took this thing at heart
Making a vow / Furyous and wode
To be venged / plainly on the blood
Of Thelamon / upon vlixes head
Him manasynge / that he shall be deed
So sore on him / fretynge was the sorrow
But vlixes / erely on a morrow
For dread of Pyrrus / taken has the sea
And with his sheppes / fast began to flee
But or he went / platly as I read
Palladyon / he took to Dyemede
Having in heart / a full great remors
And Pyrrus than / taken has the cors
Of Thelamon / for love in special
And did make / a flawme funeral
Large and great / of colys hoot and read
And amyddes / the fervent fiery glede
Full many a Greek / stondynge to behold
He let it brenne / into ashes cold
And in the storye / after as is told
Herlosed them / in an vrne of gold
Full reverently / and after has it shette
And thereupon / he has the prynt ysette
Of his arms / curyously ygraue
From all myschefe / the ashes for to save
And sent them home / by great affection
To be conserved / in the regyon
Where he was king / while he was alive
And every thing / was performed blyue
After the rytes / in tho days used
And ever in one / Pyrrus has ymused
Upon this murdre / traytoursly ywrought
And cast it should / be full dear abought
The pyteous death / of this Thelamon
Having aye heart / to Agamenon
And had eke suspect / old Menelay
That in a wait / each for other lay
Making them self / with their knights strong
To try out / who has right or wrong
For Pyrrus ne would / let it lightly gone
And thus they were / made mortal fone
This ylke three / platly to the death
Thorugh false envy / which their hertes sleeth
And while they were / among the^ self untrue
Strife upon strife / began every day renew
And debates / for to multeplye
Till Anthenor / began this thing espy
And by his wisdom / to stynte all disdain
Them reconcyled / unto peace again
And caused them / to accord in all
And after made / a feste full royal
Besechynge them / full lowely all three
To grant him / thereat for to be
Of gentyllesse / that Greeks might echone
Outward conceive / that they were alone
And to this feste / he manly made call
As wryt Guydo / the worthy greeks all
Of hye ne low / was none excepcyon
But if I should / make description
How the lords / and estates sete
Of sundry courses / and the gifts great
That Anthenor / gave on every side
It were to long / to you for to abide
There was of plente / so great suffysaunce
And I find / they fill in dalyaunce
Syttyng at met / to speak of Enee
Brought in of hate / and of enmyte
And of disdain / shortly in sentence
They put on him / many great offense
And specially / in their hasty tene
Whylom how / he concyled Polycene
And by his sleyghte / made her be withdraw
Which was in cause / Achylles was slawe
Shortly concludynge / by one oppynyon
His fynall exyle / out of Troy town
Not withstanding / the grant and lyberte
Given to him / to abide in the Cite
Also long / as him list deuyse
But greeks have / annullyd his Fraunchyse
Fro the lowest / up unto the meste
That were present / at this hye feste
But douteles / I can not well espy
By whom was brought / this conspyracye
In Troy book / I find can no more
Save that him self / wit it Anthenore
Ilyche false / both in one degree
As ye have herd / betraysshynge the Cite
Like as they had / spronge out of one root
And wha^ he knew / there was none other boot
This Eneas / his dome to modefye
He prayed them / of their courtesye
At the leest / to grant him grace
Four months / that he might have space
To make his stuff / and his apparayle
And himself / to puruey of vytayle
Eke to grant him / that they would assent
Thylke ships / that with Paris went
To Cytheron / unto that temple old
That were in nombre / two and twenty told
And with full grant / of his petycyowne
He is returned / home to Troy town
Tryste and heavy / to se and behold
The waste Cite / with his walls old
And for sorrow / felt his heart blede
Within himself / when he takes head
And remembered / in his aduertence
The false treason / and the great offense
By him compassyd / to the town aforne
And how that he / so sodaynely has lorne
The grace of greeks / and stood disconsolate
That whylom was / of so great estate
Now in his heart / fully dispayred
That he unawarely / was so evil apayred
Unto Greeks / behind at his back
Being unguilty / and without lack
And by whom / he could not well deem
Save by signs / as it did seem
That Anthenor was / most for to wit
And cast plainly / that he would him quyte
And thorugh the town / he made send blyue
For thylke few / that were left a live
Coming anon / at his commandment
And when they were / euerychone present.
SYres quod he / ye se how that fortune
Toward me / gynneth discontune
Aye unstable / with her eyes blind
As ye expert / in your self now find
Whylom froward / now turned into werse
That of clerks / called is adverse
When her list / her cruelte to show
Now it stands so / ye be here but a few
And I must part / and ye stylle abide
But it so be / that ye will provide
Stondynge alone / deuoyde of all socoure
Among your self / to make a gouernoure
I can not se / but ye shall be acloyed
On every part / and finally destroyed
As sely sheep / that ne can no read
All disparpled / which am with dread
Wherefore best is / in this dreadful thing
By one assent / to chese you a king
And most able / the estate to occupye
From all assaute / manly you to guye
Is Anthenor / of knyghthode and renown
If it accord / with your oppynyowne
Wherefore in haste / unto this intent
Without abode / let him for be sent
And at his coming / plainly into town
Upon his head / let be set a crown
Granting to him / scepter and regalye
By his wisdom / that he may you guye
From all assaute / of any parturbaunce
By his knyghthode / and prudent governance
And they assent / making no delay
There was never one / that lyketh to say nay
But were right glad / in all manner thing
As ye have herd / for to make him king.
But they full little / sothly in their sonde
Of Eneas / the menynge understand
For he ne mente / but treason and falsehede
How at his entering / that he shall be deed
Full traytoursly / in awayte liynge
To slay him falsely / at his in coming
But Anthenor / of all this no thing ware
Dysarmed came / and no wepen bare
And Eneas / with an huge route
With swerdes draw / set him round about
Till they of Troy / both young and old
Ran atwene / and manly him with hold
And on their knees / fill mekely down
Besechynge him / to have compassyowne
Of worthynesse / and also of manhede
Like as a knight / for to take heed
How they were left / but of people bare
Besechynge him / his dreadful sword to spare
And his rancoure / and his ire leave
Lest the slaughtre / would them all grieve
And on the common / they besought him rewe
Quod Eneas / is he not untrue
Is not he double traytoure / and eke false
Worthy to be / enhanged by the halse
Of all desceyte / and of fraud well
Among no common / worthy for to dwell
Has he not be / chief occasyon
Of your undoing / and destruccyon
And of new this serpent / which there gothe
Vndisserued / make the Greeks wroth
Again me / by false coll^^yowne
And mine Exyle / conspyred fro the town
Which may not be / repellyd nor withdraw
But with my sword / first he shall be slawe
That his falshede / may finally be daunted
Right as he has / me traytoursly supplaunted
The greeks menynge / fer out of this isle
By his engyne / me plainly to exyle
Where as I cast / if it might have be
Both in joy / and in aduersyte
To have had my part / what so had fall
During my life / here among you all
But he through whom / all is wrong and kourbed
Of my desire / has the fine perturbed
Which in my heart / abides always grene
Was he not cause / eke that Polycene
Yslawe was / at Achylles grave
And for all this / yet ye would him save
But utterly / there shall no mean gain
Who so ever / there against plain
That he / whose heart / al treason has compyled
Perpetuelly / shall now be exyled
Out of this town / there shall it no man let
And by assent / they his time set
Which he should / for no raunson pace
This was the fine / he get none other grace
Thus both false / as brother like to brother
Eueryche of them / has exyled other
Traitors both / to Troy the Cytee
This Anthenor / and with him eke Enee
But Anthenor / began him ready make
And in all haste / has the sea ytake
With many Troyan / in great apparayle
The wind was good / and he began to sail
By many cost / and many sundry yles
It needs not / rehearse all the miles
Nor the perrelles / plainly which that he
At great myschefe / escaped in the sea
I have no joy / thereupon to dwell
His auentures / by and by to tell
But shortly he / in a little while
Aryued up / at a noble Isle
That whylom was / Gorbodya Ycalled
Where he bylt a Cite / strongly walled
As wryt Guydo / large wide and long
Upon a roche / which passyngly was strong
Which had enuyron / as mine Auctour tells
Woddes / ryuers / and many lusty wells
And had plente / of all manner thing
And Tethydes / called was the king
That held in peace / his scepter and his crown
On whom Fortune / list not for to frown
But favorable / fully to his will
Conseruynge him / in peace and in tranquylle
Without trouble / many a day before
To whom acceptyd was / this Anthenore
And right welcome / as the storye says
And unto him / confederate by faith
Fully assured / be came his lege man
When Tethydes / in all that ever he can
This worthy king / did magnefye
And fro Troy / great nombre of his allye
There came in soth / to vysyte him and se
And to enhabyte / his mighty strong Cite
Full curyously bylte / of lyme and stone
In that days / called Menelone
To which he did / great richesse a croche
Beside the sea / set upon a roche
And besy was / with plente to astore
Of this traytoure / what should I write more
With his name / my pen is so a cloyed
By whose falshede / troy was destroyed
As in the storye / ye have red and seyne
But must I plainly / resort again
And to rehearse / do my besy cure
How Cassandra / told every adventure
That to Greeks / after should fall
And how that she / told among them all
As she that was prudent / and virtuous
That traytoursly / within his own house
Agamen on / should murdered be
That fatal end / for no thing might he fle
Let him beware / and prudently provide
For in his life / he shall not long abide
Again his fate / was none other read
Eke Guydo wryt / wha^ Thelamon was deed
By false murdre / as ye have herd toforne
Two sons he had / ofsondry wives borne
That were committed / to be in keeping
With worthy Tentre / a full manly king
That nourysshed / them ye storye says for sothe
Till they after / were worthy knights both
The tone of them / called Anthenycus
And the the other hight / Antissacus
Of shape full semely / and wonder fair of face
And shortly here / Guydo / does forth pace
And list of them / no longer process make
But brings in / how Menelay has take
His leave of Greeks / with Agamenon
Eueryche to sail / to his regyon
With many a greek / in their company
And though greeks / first began them deny
At the last / with Instaunce and pain
They had leave / to sail both twain
And to the sea / they fast began them hye
Myd of Autumpne / which is cold and dry
Melancolyke / of complexyon
When Phoebus / is passyd the Lion
The heavenly be / the beast most royal
And half Yronne / the sign virgynall
Which after somer / is naked and bareyne
When Ceres has / full ryped every grain
The time of year / strange and full diverse
And sundry flowers / red white and pers
The which in May / so lusty were and glade
Upon their stalk / began droupe and fade
And enclyne / their fresshe lusty cheres
At going out / of the Canyculeres
When wicked humors / inwardly habounde
With sudden Fever / folks to confound
To make them / in an Axes shake
And of custom / wyndes gynne wake
Both bough and leef / causynge for to fall
On the time / when folk do Bachus call
Fro storm and rain / their grapes to conserve
That hydous tempest / make them not to sterue
Nor no duresse / of fretynge of no froste
Where thorugh full often / much fruit is lost
With moisture / that comes fro the skies even
And also eke with thondrynge / and with leven
Which unawarely / with such weders kene
Boyllynge up / with many wawes grene
Rorynge and rough / and froward to manasse
And passyngly peryllous / by to pass
Albe / that it be blandysshynge a while
The dredful calm / though it be smoth and smyle
There is no trust / that it will long abide
Record on greeks / that such a lusty tide
The sea have take / and began to sail
With their stuff / and their apparayle
Home into Greece / full many lusty man
With all the gold / and treasour / y^ they wan
At the sege / and infynyt richesse
And days three / deuoyde of all distress
The sea obeyed / fully to their will
Deuoyde of trouble / and of wedres ill
For they full lusty / within ships board
The four wyndes / being of accord
Them to conueye / to every manner cost
But gladly ever / when men trust most
Unto Fortune / to stand in her grace
Shesodaynely / change can her face
Smyle before / and mow at the bake
For she unawarely / turned all to wrake
This chaunteresse / and this stormye queen
FOr when Greeks / effectuously best wene
In their passage / fully assured be
Upon the sea / that called was Egee
This false gods / them anon forsook
And Boreas / the fell wind awooke
And with his hydous / dreadful noise and sown
He turned / all their quyete up so down
And made the wawes / grysely to arise
And as the storye / shortly does deuyse
The bright day / was turned into night
The heaven derke / except the dreadful light
Of the leven / which made them sore a gaste
And the thondre / that severed sail and maste
Their tops smette / into pieces small
And into water / made them low auale
And fire of lyghtnynge / sodaynely therewith
That Wolcanus / forgeth on his styth
Has board fro board / with the flawme rent
And two and twenty / of their ships brent
Without escape / platly or refuge
Thorughe the rage / of this fell deluge
For all to wrake / this woeful Navy goth
Whylom with greeks / Mynerua was so wroth
For they did her / no reverence
And specially / for the great offense
That spytefully / Cylleus Ayax wrought
Which in his tempest / he full dear abought
For when his ships / were almost ydrowned
This goddess / has so on him frowned
And of vengeance / so felly him awaked
That he was feign / for to swymme naked
As says mine Auctour / at myschefe to ye land
And there he was / found on the sonde
Almost at death / without remedy
To him Mynerua / has so great envy
For he so woodly / to her temple went
And Cassandra / tofore her Auter hente
By cruel force / and hateful vyolence
Lo what perell / is to do offense
Of hye despyte / to any holy place
I doubt not / he shall fail grace
Who so ever / uses it in deed
At the last / god will quyte his mede
And reward him / like as he disserueth
And for such thing / many greek now streueth
Because oonly / of such occasyon
To exemplefye / for no presumpcyon
Folyly to atame / as I have told
For again god / who so be to bold
Shall repent sooner / than he weneth
And many man / that no harmene meneth
Suffers vengeance / for trespass of one
The first Auctour / goth not quyte alone
But many other / his offense abayth
For ceryously / Guydo / wryt and says
Suynge in order / the woeful adventure
That every greek / homewarde did endure
Of hye and low / sparynge none estate
How some welfull / and some unfortunate
Both of their woo / and of their welfare
Right as it fill / the storye shall declare.
IN greece whylom / was a worthy king
Manly and rich / and prudent oflyuynge
And had in sothe / like as wryt Guydo
In his time / worthy sons two
Pallamydes / was the eldest brother
And Oetes / called was the the other
Both twain / of one mother borne
And as the storye / reherseth has toforne
Pallamydes / was a noble knight
Full famous / eke of power and of might
And fer spoke of / in many sundry coost
And had also / of all the Greeks host
For his wisdom / whylom gouernayle
But he alas / was slain in battle
Thorugh unhap / of Martys cruel tene
When the son shone / most bright and shene
Of his knyghthode / and his worthynesse
Like as tofore / the storye bears witness
And of his death / does plainly specefye
But now of malys / hatrede and envy
Of such as have / tunges unfortunate
To make oonly / king Naulus at debate
With the Greeks / contryued have of new
An hye treason / false and full untrue
The which in soth / was never do nor wrought
Nor in effect / ymagyned nor thought
But a false thing / yfeyned of malice
That this king / so manly and so wise
And so prudent / this Pallamydes
Should of envy / god wot causeles
At the sege of Troy / the Cite
Upon a night / falsely murdered be
So that this slaughter / and this loathsome deed
^y vlixes / and by Dyomede
Were fully wrought / as ye have herd deuyse
Which every heart / ought to agryse
This false also that this tale have feigned
To king Naulus / have traytoursly co^playned
Albe / in deed / it was never mente
That Greeks were / also of assente
To this murdre / and conspyracyon
Both Menelay / and Agamenon
Albe in sothe / that euery^ele was false
That hanged be they / hye by the half
That can tales / so forge and contryue
To make friends / causeles to strive
For they thorugh fraud / of false collusyon
King Naulus / put in suspecyon
That greeks had / conspyred douteles
Upon the murdre / of Pallamydes
Making their ground / which they did feign
That fro Troy / were sent lettres twain
To Pallamydes / inmedyatly dyrect
Which concluded / treason in effect
How that he was / for all his hye estat
Falsely allied / and confederat
To them of Troy / for a su^me of gold
All this they have / feigned and ytolde
And how he had / out of the Cite
Of good received / huge quantyte
To fine oonly / Greeks / to betraye
And to prolonge them / platly and delay
At the sege / in getting of the town
By his engyne / and medyacyowne
And to conferme / all this in sentence
To make Naulus / give full credence
They said plainly / in conclusyowne
The lettres which / y^ were sent fro the town
Yfounde were / enclosed in a shield
Upon a knight / yslayne in the field
Comprehendynge / hole / the trecherye
The treason full / and confederacye
Atwene the town / and Pallamydes
Verily / though he were gylteles
And to give / more open euydence
To make a prefe / of this great offense
They said vlixes / affermynge in certain
Accorded was / with a chaumberlayne
That was in office / with Pallamydes
Wonder secret / and no thing reckeles
For to assente / to this conspyracye
Wrongly compassyd / of brennynge hot envy
Behotynge him / guerdon and great mede
Like his deuyse / to execute in deed
To take a treasour / and a su^me of good
Full secretly / and knyt it in a hode
And hyd it / when voyded was the prees
Under the bed / of Pallamydes
And more to put / Greeks in suerte
The treasoure was / the same of quantyte
That it ne might / after be denied
Like as the lettres / had specyfyed.
And when all this / found was and know
Thorugh out the host / noysed and yblowe
Both of the lettres / and the gold also
Fro point to point / according both two
Which y^ this king / assenting to treasowne
Received had / out of Troy town
To be assented / as ye have herd me tell
The greeks tho / no longer would dwell
But shope them forth / all of one intent
And in all haste / came unto the tent
Of this king / full innocent and clean
That little knew / what they would mean
But upon him / full knyghtly as he stood
In their Ire / furyously / and wode
To be venged / loud began to cry
There may no man / their malice modefye
They were on him / so mercyles at all
And as I find / most in special
King Menelay / and Agamenon
Oonly meued / of indignacyon
Would have proceeded / unto Judgment
Of hasty rancoure / without auysement
On this treason / avenged for to a be
Not withstanding / all his hye degree
But in sothenesse / when this worthy king
Conceived has / this malice in werkynge
First astoned / in his inward sight
All sodaynely / stert up like a knight
This wise worthy / this Pallamydes
Hardy as Lion / amyd all the prees
No thing agaste / him knyghtly began express
And plainly said / he would not refuse
To acquyte him self / of this horrible caas
Not exceptynge / that he so worthy was
Of birth and blood / and of hye kynrede
All this deuoydynge / of knyghthode and ma^hede
As he that gave / of life nor death no fors
Tofore them all / to Iuparde his cors
Within a field / where them list ordeyne
Like as a knight / this quarrel to dareyne
With whom that list / or durst it undertake
Excepcyon / him lyked none to make
Of hye nor low / who that were so bold
To preue the reason / that I have you told
Besechynge them / to make no delay
Nor prolonge him / but the same day
Manly requerynge / it may be do in haste
But they y^ had / falsely this thing compaste
Of his answer / stoned were echone
In all the host / that there was not one
That hardy was / if I shall not feyne
In chaump close / this quarrel to dareyne
Nouther Vlixes / nouther Dyomede
Chief workers / of this foul deed
But Vlixes / as he was customable
In every thing / to be deceyuable
Double in his work / and full aye of disceyte
Like a serpent / that lies in awayte
Which under flowers / can so glyde and trace
Right so vlixes / with a feigned face
When y^ he saw / the knyghtly hye prowess
The manly chere / and the hardynesse
And hye renown / of this Pallamydes
Anon of falshede / put him self in prees
And like a friend / that mente not but well
Brotell as glass / pretendynge outward stele
With one the first / began him to excuse
Them counsayllynge / no longer for to muse
On this matere / for their alder ease
And by craft / began them so appease
Touching the rumoure / of this hye treason
That he has / voyded all suspecyon
Out of their hertes / concludynge in tertayne
This accusynge / made was in vain
And conspyred / oonly of hatrede
Albe him self was root / of all this deed.
But when he saw / he might not acheue
As ye have herd / this worthy king to grieve
Some spot of treason / on him for to lay
Hehath anon found / another way
By the assent / fully of Dyomede
Under pretense / plainly of frendelyhede
Coming to him / again a certain night
Vndersuraunce / as he was true knight
Counsel to keep / outher for sote or sour
Enformynge him / of a great treasoure
Of gold and good / and infynyte riches
To him discured / under secretenes
The which sothly / no man did know
Hyd and enclosyd / in a well low
Within a field / a little there be side
The which him list / fro him not to hyde
But of trust / unto him discure
So he would / do his besy cure
The same night / with him for to go
Unto the well / they three and no mo
To fette away / that great su^me of good
And he in sothe / that no thing understood
What they mente / assentyd was anon
And so they three / be togydre gone
Unto the well / like as I have told
And for that he / most manly was and bold
Pallamydes / like as they him tell
Descended is low / into the well
Supposing to have / a treasour found
But they alas / him falsely to confound
Have murdered him / with stones great and huge
He in the botome / having no refuge
And wha^ they had / acomplysshed their intent
They be repeyred / eueryche to his Tent.
THis tale / the storye tells us
That feyned was / to ye king Naulus
Touching the death / of Pallamydes
Them to desclaundre / that were gylteles
For vlixes / and with Dyomede
Were innocent / platly as I read
And greeks all / bothenygh and far
For he was slain / knyghtly in the werre
During the sege / of Paris with an arowe
But who is false / feign can full narowe
To find a tale / that never yet was thought
And of the treason / that should have be wrought
Touching the lettres / sent out of the town
There was no such / conspyracyowne
By greeks wrought / but a fable vnsoth
Falsely feyned / to make Naulus wroth
With Vlixes / and Dyomede also
Agamenon / and other greeks mo
To let them / homewarde in their way
And hyndre also / there is no more to say
As they repeyre / to their regyons
And Naulus than / by this occasyons
And Oetes his sone / a manly man
Accorded be / in what they may or can
By one assent / to avenge mercyles
The cruel murdre / of Pallamydes
And to ordain / at their home passage
To work fully / into their damage
For Greeks must / of necessyte
Homewarde sail / foreby his country
Wherefore this king / shapen has a wyle
On hyl^es hye / by a little isle
In winter season / every manner night
To make fyres / and to set up light
To cause them / on the sea to err
For as Greeks / saw the fire a far
Unware of harm / cast them for to land
As they that could / no perell understand
But shope them / with all their full might
For to aryue / fast by the light
Wherewith.ij. hundred / of their ships brake
Among rocks / and fully go to wrake
That there was drowned / many worthy man
And thus the vengaunce / alderfirste began
That king Naulus / has on greeks take
Of deedly hate / for his sons sake
To great myschefe / and confusyon
Of Greeks nauye / but Agamenon
With great perell / is the death escaped
That had almost / among them be beiaped
For earls / dukes / and worthy kings crowned
Thorugh this train / in the sea were drowned
But Menelay / and also Dyomede
Escaped / this myschefe / as I read
And when they were / from all danger gone
This Oetes / wood foryre an one
In his heart / shope another wyle
And thought / he would Agamenon begyle
Compassynge / a full mortal strife
Let send a lettre / anon to the wife
Of this mighty / great Agamenon
In which / there was / included false treason
For even like / if I shall not lie
Thus in effect / they did specyfye.
First how her lord / Agamenon the king
Had at the sege / wrought a wonder thing
In preiudyce / and sclaundre of her name
Albe in her was / no manner blame
Like as he wrote / platly nor trespace
His knyghtly honor / of folly to difface
This to say / Guydo tells thus
He loved a daughter / of king Pryamus
And for beauty / had her to wife take
And her in heart / finally forsake
This worthy queen / whylom of great fame
And Clemestra / sothly was her name
Wonder semely / and right fair with all
And by descent / borne of the stock royal
Her celly nge eke / for all her excellence
Albe / that she never did offense
Yet her lord / of new fangylnesse
Took a another / the lettres did express
Fully in purpose / anon at his repair
Though Clemestra / were both good and fair
All sodaynely / her to exyle
Out of his land / many thousand mile
Warning her / that she be prudent
This was the substance / as in sentement
That Oetes / wrote / unto this queen
Albe the king / was innocent and clean
And was to her / in all his fore living
Loving and true / in all manner thing
And her to please / passing ententyfe
In word and deed / during all his life
As fer as ought / of reason be desired
But the lettres / that falsely was conspyred
They have her put / parcas of Innocence
For to give / to hasty credence
Thanking first Oetes / for his truth
That so goodly / him list to have routhe
Upon her wrong / of hye compassyon
And yet the storye / makes mencyon
Here afterward / as I shall descryue
That she was / the falsest one alive
Unto her lord / and in his long absence
And in all haste / she made strong d^ffence
Again this thing / and began her to purueye
By such fraud / that she not ne deye
But of her work / in sothe she was to wit
The which alas / I must anon endyte
As the storye / platly does me lere
Which doleful is / and mortal for to here.
OVnsure trust / of all worldly glory
with sudden change / put out of memory
O joy unstable / of vain ambycyon
With unware turn / reuersed up so down
O ydell fame / blow up to the sky
Over whelmyd / with twynclynge of an eye
O pomp / o boste / of tryumphe and victory
Like a shadow / waste and transytorye
O Fortune false / and unassured
That to no man / was never fully lured
To hye nor low / of no manner estate
With bond of faith / to be conferate
Again whose might / no man may hy^diffende
But at his turn / that he shall discende
When he sit highest / on thine unstable whele
Thy brotyll favor / forged not of stele
Meynt and allayed / with mutabylyte
For welfulnesse / and false felycyte
With sudden sweygh / froward you can auale
Now fresshe of chere / now for anger pale
Of hye disdain / thou sparest no degree
For Princes Dukes / highest in their see
Mighty kings / and worthy Emperors
That rychest reygne / in their royal flowers
With Scepter and crown / you can pull down
I take witness / of Agamenowne
That was so noble / and mighty in his live
As sundry Auctours / his hye renown descryue
But sothfastly / for all his excellence
He might not make / no diffence
With all the kings / that his baner sewe
Conspyred murdre / to void and eschew
Rescuse was none / that he could make
For which alas / my pen I feel quake
That does mine ynke / blotte on my book
O mighty god / y^ with thine inward look
See every thing / through thy eternal might
Why wylt thou not / of equity and right
Punysshe and chastyse / so horrible a thing
And specially / the murdre of a king
Alas the pain / of Ixyon in hell
Or of Manes / that with Satan dwell
Were not egall / nor equypolent
To venge murdre / nor suffycyent
For it excedeth / in comparyson
All felonye / falshede / and treason
Wherefore o lord / that see and know all
Thorugh thy power / that is eternal
Suffer no such / to live upon ye ground
Worse than Tygre / or Cerberus the hounde
That chayned lies / bound at hell gate
Which of malice / plainly though he hate
He berketh first / or he do offense
But murdre gladly / is wrought in silence
Or men aduerte / or take any keep
Alas a Prince / to sle him in his sleep
On his pyllowe / when he slepeth soft
That cries wreche / to hye god a lofte
And axeth vengaunce / to take as fast
Though it abide / it will out at the last
Alas a king / spoken of so far
That was so worthy / outward in the werre
His cruel fate / passing odyous
Disposed has / in his own house
His mortal end / to be execute
Against which / there was no refute
For right as he / his ship to land set
The queen Clemestra / on ye stronde hy^ met
With humble chere / and look full benygne
And showed out / full many faithful sign
Of wifely truth / in her countenauce
Albe in heart / there was varyaunce
Not parceyued / plainly in her face
Whom the king goodly did enbrace
As he in soth / that but truth mente
And to his paleyse / the hye way he went
Not aduertynge / the treason that was shape
The which alas / he might not escape
Of the falshede / he could no thing feel
But I ne may / no longer it concele
Again her lord / how Clemestra wrought
For on her bond / of wedlock she ne thought
The true look / sothly of spousayle
Again her malice / little might avail
Unto her lord / her truth to conserve
Newfangelnesse / caused to streue
Her old faith / and her assurance
Her love abode / on a fykyll chance
Long absence / had her heart appalled
She loved one / that was Egistus called
Which before all / in her grace stood
That nouther was / of birth nor of blood
Little or naught / of reputacyowne
Nor renowned / of manhood nor renown
Nor of knyghthode / nor of hye prowess
But for his labor / and his business
And good awayte / upon her by night
Therefore he was best / furthrede in her sight
Such dread had she / for to live alone
Sorowles / so well / she could groan
I can not say / what life that they ladde
Except that she by him / a daughter had
And Exyona / Guydo says she hight
And unto him / Clemestra behyght
Assuring him / upon pain of her head
He should reygne / when her lord were deed
And to enhaste / this conclusyon
Her worthy lord / king Agamenon
The next night / was murdered and yssayne
By false Egistus / and the queen full feign
No longer bode / the storye can you lere
But in all haste / they wedded were yfere
And by her false / and sleyghty compassynge
Of Messene / she made him crowned king
And put him full / in possessyon
Alas / that sin has domynacyon
To furthre wrong / and abate right
For in this world / falshede has more might
Full often sithe / than has rightwysenesse
And in the estate / set of worthynesse
Loo how the sin / of auoutrye
Brought in murdre / by conspyracye
Sin upon sin / lynked both twain
And enbraced / in the fendes chain
Perpetuelly / in hell to endure
Alas who shall / himself full assure
Fro cruel murdre / his body to withdraw
When that kings / in their bed are slawe
Which brings in / Alyenacyon
By extort title / false succession
There may color / of pretense seem
But full straytely / god shall after deem
And justly venge / with dew recompense
Intrusyon / brought in by vyolence
And felly quyte / such horrible things
And sudden slaughter / and specially of kings
Greatly to dread / in every regyon
And as I find / that Agamenon
By Clemestra / the false double queen
Had a sone / passing fair to seen
Right gracyous / in every man's sight
And Horestes / the book says that he hight
Wonder semely / and but young of age
And for great fere / of this mortal rage
List he were slain / as it was to dread
To anulle his title / that he not succeed
Him to preserve / that he were not shent
King taltybus / with power has him sent
Full secretly / out of that country
Unto a king / called Ydume
That held his scepter / and his royal sete
Full myghtely / in the land of Crete
And Carkasys / named was the queen
That had a daughter / called eke Clymene
Borne to be heir / of that regyon
And as it is made / eke mencyon
This Horestes / to reken all thing
Was with the queen / and also with the king
Cherysshed as well / the storye can you lere
As Clymen a / their own daughter dear
And was eke kept / and had in cherte
Fro point to point / like to his degree
With attendaunce / conuenyent and dew
To his estate / that ever upon him sewe
Of such as were / most expert and sage
To govern him / till he came to age
To rejoice / if god gave him might
His heritage / to which he had right
By clear descent / if happy were his chance
Thus leave I him / under governance
The young lone / of Agamenon
For I must make / a dygressyon.
Fro this matter / and tell of Dyomede
The auentures / in Guydo as I read
His woeful fate / and his pains smerte
The which alas / he might not asterte
As is remembered / plainly in writing
That Oeres / sone of the rich king
Called Naulus / as ye have herd toforne
Such heaviness / in his heart has borne
Unto Greeks / repeyrynge home fro Troy
That his lust / and his inward joy
Was them to hyndre / both hye and low
And cause why / to you is not unknow
To them he was / so passing enuyous
In will and thought / ylyke desirous
If he might / sothly this no les
The death to venge / of Pallamydes
Like as tofore / the stroye can deuyse
To you that be / so prudent and so wise
And how Oetes / now of malice wrought
And traytoursly / new menes sought
If he might / by any manner weye
Dyomedes / unawarely to destroy
Of all this thing / I cast not to fail
Ceryously / to make rehersayle.
IN Greece was a kingdom / wide and large
Conyumpt in one / Calydonye and Arge
Full habundaunt / of richesse and of rent
Of which the king / called was Pollente
A worthy man / and of noble fame
And had a sone / Assandrus was his name
And a daughter / passing fair of sight
And sothly Egra / I find that she hight
And for her Fader / like as wryt Guydo
Had nomo / but these children two
For them he has / of wisdom so provided
This mighty reygne / for to be divided
Atwene them two / after his dissees
Each with his part / for to live in pees
To exclude them / fro indigence or need
And she was wife / unto Dyomede
Albe tofore / the storye of him said
That he whylom / loved well Crysayde
I can not say / where it was doubleness
But well wot I / Guydo bears witness
And in his book / sothely says none other
And how Assandrus / his own wives brother
Full lusty fresshe / and full of manlyhede
To Troy went / with this Dyomede
But in the sea / fordyuen up so down
They ryued up / in the regyon
Called Boece / all disconsolate
With tempest drive / weary and full mate
Them to refresshe / and for none other thing
In which land / Thelephus was king
Of whose ryuayle / when he herd said
In his heart / he had hye disdain
That they were bold / to do so great offense
To enter his ground / having no license
And yet in sothe / they did no damage
To hye nor low / of no manner age
Nortoke not / that might disauayle
Unto that land / but it were vytayle
For which they paid / justly at the fine
For flesh and fysshe / and for bread and wine
Yet for all that / of indignacyowne
King Thelephus / is descended down
With great array / to harm them if he might
And so they began / to bycker and to fight
And Assandrus / full of hye prowess
Like a Lion / his fomen began oppress
And wonder knyghtly / ye feld upon them wan
And slew that day / many worthy man
Of hye courage / and of manly pride
And when the king / which that stood aside
Saw his men / slain on every part
Of hye disdain / hent anon a darte
And cast at him / alas the mortal fate
And percyd has / through mayles and through plate
Of Assandrus / that he fell down deed
The soil about / of his blood all read
His deedly wound / so began to blede
And wood as Tygre / tho came Dyomede
And him to avenge / bare him like a knight
Sleeth and kylleth / and put them unto flight
And after that / such sorrow began to make
Of knyghtly routhe / for his brothres sake
That he ne wyste / what was best to do
But as I find / myd of all his woe
From best and foul / the deed corpse to save
Like his estate / he let make a grave
And buried him / after rytes old
But Oetes / to his suster told
That he was slain / by fraud of Dyomede
To fine / that he might full possede
The reygne of Arge / hole without strife
With the purpartye / annexed to his wife
For by his death / he might season take
And told her eke / that she was forsake
This fair Egra / for all her womenhede
Of her lord / called Dyomede
All this he told / in hell be he chayned
And ouermore / he forged has and feigned
How of envy / Assandrus lost his life
And how her lord / has take a another wife
That was to her / dishonor and shame
And passyngly / great sclaundre to her name
In preiudyce / ydone of her estate
All this he told / to make them at debate
Like as he wrote / in conclusyon
To Clemestra / of Agamenon
Which her heart / made sore grieve
For he put her / fully in believe
Of all the treason / ye have herd me told
That for ire / she pale wexe and cold
Unkindness / so her heart sleeth
And heaviness / of her brothre^ death
For never yet / Guydo does assure
No woman / loved better a creature
Than she loved him / in no manner age
For first at naught / she set her heritage
In comparyson / of her brothres life
Loo how Oetes / made a new strife
As ye have herd / in the storye read
That gylteles / worthy Dyomede
When he has long / at the sege layne
And to his kingdom / would have come again
By mighty hand / of this worthy queen
And her lyeges / that assentyd been
He was exyled / out of that regyon
There may be made / no medyacyon
Thus in him self / mate and dispeyred
Disconsolate / he is again repeyred
To Salerne / a land of great richesse
Where that Tenter / thorugh his worthynesse
With crown and scepter / had reigned long
With his lyeges / and his knights strong
And brother was / to Apax Thelamon
Murdered tofore / as made is mencyon
And Dyomede / pore and destytute
May in Salerne / find no refute
For when Tenter / first began him espy
He sewed him / by full great envy
Having to him / aye suspecyon
Touching the death of king Thelamon
But Dyomede / on a certain night
Full secretly / has taken him to flight
And fro Salerne / fast began him hye
In hope to find / better remedy
Help or socoure / in some other place
If Fortune would / grant him grace
For of himself / ashamed and confuse
As man forsake / abject and refuse
Right so fared he / wandrynge to and fro
As he that ne wist / what was best to do.
But I find / the Troyan Eneas
That all this while / still at Troy was
Oonly of routhe / and compassyowne
To supporte them / that were left of the town
Being always / of their life in doubt
Of their fomen / round beset about
As they that lived / for lack of an head
Contynuelly / in myschefe and dread
Knowing no refute / nor comfort in this caas
Till by counsel / of this Eneas
To supporte them / in this great need
They sent in haste / for this Dyomede
Knowing full well / his desolacyon
How he was proscrip / fro his regyon
Besechynge him / of manhood and of routhe
Him to enhaste / without any slouthe
With all the stuff / that he get can
And souldeours also / manly every man
Without abode / and to Troy them led
To socoure them / in this great need
And Dyomede came / and tarried naught
At their request / as he was besought
To releue them / in this sharp shoure
And with him brought / many souldeoure
And Eneas / on the way him met
In frendely wise / and into town him fette
And to him made / passyngly great chere
And there they began / to comune yfere
Their auentures / both of land and see
Entermedlyd / with great aduersyte
That no man may / deuoyde nor eschew
But take his part / as it to him is dew
As sort or hap / does his brydell led
And in this storye / shortly to proceed
Cely Troyans / that almost were shent
With their fomen / of Yles adjacent
That them besette / about enuyrowne
But thorugh the manhood / and the hye renown
Of Dyomede / and his souldeours
And other knights / noble werry ours
They were reskued / and helped utterly
And four days / they fought by and by
In knyghtly wise / deffendynge the Cyree
And thorugh prowess / also of Enee
They slew and took / all that them withstode
And in diffence / of Troyanysshe blood
Such as they fond / to the Cite false
They henge them up / hye by the halse
And punysshed them / for their great wrong
And Dyomede / thus began wexe strong
By long process / as made is mencyowne
Chief protectoure / now of Troy town
That enmye none / by a large space
Durst abide / but he had grace
To this lygaunce / so he made them loute
And thus his name / sprede began about
That of his fame / the great oppynyon
Dylated is / unto the regyon
By swyfte report / to Calydonye and Arg^
Which the queen / greatly began to charge
And astoned / when she takes head
His power began / and his might to dread
List he would / her land upon her win
And of knyghthode / a werre new begin
And secretly / began muse on this thing
That her lord / and her mighty king
Late exyled / and yput to flight
Has grace found / in Fortunes sight
And is remounted / to so hye estate
Whereof she was / in her self chekmate
And ways cast / as she that was prudent
By hole advise / of her Parliament
Without grutchynge / or rebellyon
Him to revoke / to his regyon
And thereupon / to him lowly sent
And with lettres / the messager forth went
The cause annullyng / by which he was exyled
And how he was / fully reconcyled
By hole assente / of his lyeges all
And full lowly / euerychone they call
For their offense / and of their trespace
Without rygoure / for to do them grace
And he anon / like a manly knight
More of mercy / sothly than of right
When he has / their sonde well conceived
And their menynge / fully apparceyued
To stynte all strife / thought for the best
In goodly wise / to grauute their request
And to his reygne / within a certain day
He is repeyred / in full rich array
Of whose coming / full glad his lyeges been
And reconcyled / both he and the queen
And all rancoure / of any old offense
Oonly of wisdom / they put in suspense
And of one heart / a blysfull life they led
In Troy book / no more of him I read
But let him live / in felycytee
Again resorting / to tell of Enee
After how he has / his time spent
Which is fro Troy / with many Troyan went
His ships stuffed / he and his meynee
Be sailed forth / by many strange see
Many danger / and many strayte passage
Tofore or he / aryued in Cartage
Ledynge with him / his fader Anchyses
And by the way / I find that he les
His wife Crewsa / by fatal adventure
But all the woo / that he did endure
Who so list / ceryously to seen
And how that he / falsehede the queen
I mean Dido / of womanhede flower
That gave to him / her richesse and treasoure
Iewellys and gold / and all y^ might him please
And every thing / that might do him ease
But for all that / how he was unkind
Read Eneydos / and there ye shall it find
And how that he / falsely stale away
By night time / while she a bed lay
And of his conqueste / also in Itaylle
Where he had / many strong bataylle
His auentures / and his works all
And of the fine / that is to him fall
Ye may all se / by full sovereign style
Fro point to point / compyled in virgyle
Write and made / sythen go full yore
For Troy book / speaks of him no more
But proceeds / as I shall endyte
How Horestes / cast him for to quyte
His fadres death / plainly / and not spare
If ye list here / as Guydo shall declare.
IT is requered / of equity and right
Of that judge / that is most of might
And Egally / holds his balaunce
On death conspyred / for to do vengaunce
The voyse of blood / does so aye contune
To cry wreche / with clamor importune
On them in sothe / that it iniustly shede
For murdre wrought / will have his egal mede
And his guerdon / as he has disseruyd
They may not flee / the judgment reseruyd
Of him that sytte / highest in his Trone
And all beholds / by him self alone
Full rightfully / the noble mighty king
For though he suffer / he foryet no thing
But all consydereth / in his inspeccyon
And for the murdre / of Agamenon
The mighty lord / yt is most sovereign good
Made his Mynystre / of the same blood
Young Horestes / full of hye prowess
To execute his dome / of right wysnesse
And gave to him grace / power and might
And he anon / took the order of a knight
Of you men's / like as it is told
When he was / four and twenty winter old
Fresshe and lusty / and wonderly prudent
And in wardely / desirous of intent
If Fortune would / him not withsayne
His heritage / to recure again
Which Egistus / falsely him denies
And the crown / in justly occupyeth
By false title / of her that was his wife
But horestes / will Iuparde his life
And adventure / while him lasts breath
First to be venged / on his fadres death
Upon them tho / that the treason wrought
And alderfirste / full lowely he besought
King y^dumee / of his goodlyhede
To forther him / in this great need
And the king / benygnely anon
Assigned has / with him for to gone
A thousand knights / manly and right strong
To redress / the great horrible wrong
Of Egistus / wroughte by vyolence
And by his wisdom / and his dylygence
This Horestes / began him so purueye
Within a while / there is no more to seye
That he him gat / the store will not lie
Another thousand / to his company
Of worthy knights / all of one accord
To go with him / as with their sovereign lord
In every thing / his bidding to obey
As ye have herd / Egistus to werreye
And thus Horestes / in full rich array
Began hoostey / and made no delay
And his lodging / alderfirste began chese
In a Cytee / that called was Troyese
Received there / with great reuernece
Of the king / that named was Forence
A manly knight / as books specefye
And bare in heart / passing great envy
To Egistus / by double occasyon
First for the death / of Agamenon
And eke for he / had a daughter dear
That was to him / in wardly entere
Both good and fair / and but young of age
That whylom / was given in marriage
To Egistus / but he of doubylnesse
Of false treason / and new fangylnesse
The kings daughter / has utterly forsake
And in all haste / did a lybell make
And forge a wryt / of repulsyon
Albe he had / no true occasyon
This Egistus / that he her forsook
Save that he falsely / to wyue took
The queen Clemestra / again all right and law
When by assent / they murdered have and slawe
A gamenon / as it tofore is told
That whylom was / so mighty and so bold
And for the hateful / false conspyracye
As well of murdre / as auoutrye
To venge both / by dew recompense
The worthy knight / y^ mighty king Forence
Offrede Horestes / for to make him strong
And go with him / to help venge his wrong
And with him ladde / armed bright in steel
Four hundred knights / horsed wonder well
Taking the field / with a manly chere
And so Horestes / and the king yfere
Be ryden forth / with many manly man
But Horestes / or he this werre began
When bright Phoebus / in the bole shone
To the temple / is full lowely gone
And to the gods / in his best wise
With humble heart / did sacryfyse
Fully in hope / the better for to fare
Where he was bode / for life nor death to spare
Without mercy / or remyssyon
The death to venge / of Agamenon
On Clemestra / that was most to wit
And that he make / first his sword to byte
On his mother / with his hondes twain
And over more / to do his besy pain
Without pity / and no mercy show
On small pieces / till she be to hew
And dismembered / a sonder joint fro joint
And eke that he / foryet not a point
Justly to punysshe / by rygoure and by right
Egistus eke / the false untrue knight
And that he be not / slow nor neclygent
To execute / the commandment
Of the gods / list what after fall
And than Horestes / with his knights all
And Forensis / the mighty king also
Of one heart / be to the sege go
Of the Cite / that called was Methene
Within which / was the false queen
Clemestra / god give her hard grace
And when Horestes / seged has the place
With his knights / set it round about
False Existus / was Yryden out
To gadre men / and to be a wreke
And fall upon / and the sege break.
If he might / on any manner side
And with great stuff / thus he began to ride
Taking up men / from every coost
Till he him made / a full mighty host
But horeste / which at the sege lay
His governance / espyeth day by day
And sent out men / as he that was full sage
To stop ways / and let his passage
And made knights / a full huge route
To pursue him / every cost about
And of the sege / man fully begone
By assaute / he has the town y won
And entrede in / on a night full late
And set wards / strong at every gate
And in a doungeon / most strong and pryncypall
That was of byldynge / mighty and royal
This horestes first / his mother fond
The queen Clemestra / lady of that land
Which for dread / sore began to quake
But mercyles / anon he made her take
And put in chains / till the next morrow
And Egistus / god give him evil sorrow
With all the stuff / that he might accroche
Toward the town / fast began approach
In purpose full / horestes / for to grieve
And them within / sodaynely releue
But all in sothe / might not avail
For or that he / the Cite might abayle
Horestes knights / unawarely have him met
And all attones / proudely on him set
First slew his men / and put them to the flight
And taken him / maugre all his might
And with chains / like as they him find
Mercyles / full fast they him bind
And shet him up / fetryd in prysowne
And all false / found in the town
That were assentyd / wynynge or helping
To the murdre / of the worthy king
Great werkers / and conspyratours
Again their lord / rysynge as traitors
An were take / and bound by rygoure
The same night / and shet up in a toure
Till on the morrow / like as the lot be draw
Eueryche of them / under fonge his law
Like his decerte / excepcyon was none
And when the night / passed was and gone
And Phoebus / role esswarde in his spear
And on the tours / shone full bright and clear
When Clemestra / rote of all falsehede
Was brought forth / quakynge in her dread
Before Horestes / to Judgment yfet
He with a sword / sharp and kene whet
Like as the gods / charged him toforne
On pieces small / he has her all to shorn
And made her bear / out of the towns bounds
To be vouryd / of bestes and of hounds
Pity was none / in his breast reseruyd
But quyt her fully / as she has disseruyd
Fro point to point / and forgot right naught
And tha^ chayned / egistus was forth brought
And justly dempt / by rygour of the law
On an herdell / naked to be draw
Thorugh the town / that all might se
And after / hye hanged on a tree
For to rot and dry / again the son
Loo how murdre / has his guerdon won
Loo how falsehede / his master can awake
And all the traitors / in the town ytake
Were on galowes / enhonged euerychone
Till they were seueryd / a sonder bone fro bone
Hye on an hylle / again the sterres shene
Thus was the town / fro treason purgyd clean
And with truth / augmentyd and ymoryd
And to his reygne / Horestes full restoryd
As the storye sewynge / shall expowne
And of the day / when he took his crown.
ANd when y^ myste / and every cloudy sky
Of false treason / and conspyracye
Were tried out / upon every side
That falsehede had / no place to abide
The storye says / in order rehersynge
The same time / Menelay the king
Out of see / full of wawes were
Fro Troyewarde / aryued was in Crete
Freely escapyd / many dread and pain
With his queen / the goodly fresshe Eleyne
And for cause / she was so famous fair
Great was the prees / and meruayllous repair
Fro every part / her beauty to behold
For whom Troy / with walls not full old
Destroyed was / the noble royal town
And many man / full worthy of renown
Has lost his life / there may no man say nay
All for Eleyne / wife to Menelay
When thing is done / it may be none other
But wha^ this king / knew fully of his brother
A gamenon / murdre and euerydele
He was full tryste / and lyked no thing well
But inwardly / felt full great smerte
And his neuewe / he had also at heart
I mean Horestes / that so mercyles
Like a tyrant / that were graceles
His Modre slew / and had no pity
Of morrall y^re / in his cruelte
And fully cast / that he would blyue
Of scepter and crown / platly him depryue
Full affermynge / for this hateful caas
By all law / that he unworthy was
His faders reygne / as heir to possede
Justly consydred / his horrible deed
And all attones / Furyous and wroth
Without abode / unto ship he gothe
Melancolyke / in his great tene
Out of Crete / saylnge to Athene
And took the land / out of ships board
Where duke Nestor / was governor and lord
Which them receives / like a gentle knight
With all his power / dylygence and might
But Menelaye / of rancoure / and great hete
Began with the duke / secretly to trete
To find a mean / in his inward sight
For to depryue / Horestes of his right
And thereupon / to have a judgment
At Athenes / was hold a Parliament
Of all the lords / of that regyon
To give thereon / a diffynycyon
In which was showed / openly enough
How Horestes / his own modre sloughe
And the manner / of his great offense
Him self tho / being in presence
And when this thing / he fully did espy
For his party / he began again replye
As he that felt / him freely at his large
For him allegynge / how he had in charge
Of the gods / shortly to declare
His mortal sword / that he not ne spare
Upon Clemestra / root of false treason
That slew her lord / king Agamenon
And the murdre / thorugh her malys wrought
Wherefore Horestes / humbly besought
The lords all / with a manly heart
Of equity / consydre and aduerte
For no malice / rancoure nor for rage
Him to depryue / of his heritage
Sith he was sone / of Agamenon
Borne to be heir / of that regyon
As ye have herd / that called was Methene
Albe his mother / Clemestra the queen
Compassyd had / his destruccyon
But Duke Nestor / ymeuyd of reason
In susteynynge / of horestes right
Rose up anon / like a manly knight
Offrynge him self / proudely for his sake
This hye quarrel / for to undertake
With his body / to the death darreyne
With whom that list / his title to withseyne
But there was none / in all that company
That durst a word / again him replye
So hoole he stood / in his oppynyon
And by his knyghtly / medyacyon
He bare him so / feynynge in no thing
That Horestes / was ycrowned king
Of Meneste / all being of assent
And when dissolved / was the Parliament
This Horestes / of his lyeges true
Received was / with a crown new
And by treat / of lords many one
King Menelay / and he / were made atone
And began their Ire / and their rancourelete
And y^dumee / the worthy king of Crete
So prudently / governs this matere
That hermyone / the young daughter dear
Of Menelay / and the queen Eleyne
So young so fresshe / of beauty souereyne
Yweddyd was / without more tariynge
To Horestes / the new lusty king
And because / of this allyaunce
Deuoyded was / all rancour and distaunce
Atwene the kings / Menelay the old
And horestes / of whom right now I told
Thus leave I them / as it was the best
Each in his reygne / live in peace and rest
For all strife / was ceasyd in this caas
But Erygona / that the daughter was
Of Egistus / as ye have herd me tell
For sorrow and dread / list no longer dwell
But took a rope / and list no thing to spare
And therwithall / began her self to gnare
The storye says / hye upon a tree
This was her fine / ye get no more of me
But I will forth / ceryously entreat
Of the storye / to tell you the great.
OVlixes by order / in my writing
Thine auentures / come on the ring
Full wonderful / both on land and see
Entermedlyd / with great aduersytee
For Guydo first / descryuynge thy repair
Says how thou found / weder foul and fair
Now agreeable / now the thonder sown
Now stylle and smothe / now with clwdes frown
And says also / that thou dyddest ordain
To thy passage / mighty ships twain
Apparaylled / all for marchaundyse
That thou myghtest / in most secret wise
Every myschefe / of the sea escape
But for all that / thou had a fell iape
For as this Auctour / thy resort does write
He says Vlixes / for all his words white
Yrobbed was / of richesse and of good
Contraryous wind / so again him stood
That he was drive / to his confusyon
Into the mighty / strong regyon
Where Thelamon / reigned by his live
And there he was / hent and take blyue
By mighty hand / sesyd by the breast
And mercyles / put under arest
For they him had / suspect in workynge
Touching the murdre / of the same king
But he so wroughte / by his sleyghty wyle
And his tale / set in such a style
That them all / he plainly has be iaped
And fro their hand / freely is escaped
Except that he / for all his queynt fare
Of his treasour / was ymade full bare
And for his passage / was to him vnkouthe
He fill again / into the wolfes mouth
For verily / as it is specyfyed
King Naulus men / have him eft espied
Take and bound / and chayned mercyles
For the murdre / of king Pallamydes
But the storye reherseth / in certain
By his prudence / he escaped is again
For he was both / expert wise and old
All though the manner / be not fully told
Of his escape / thorugh his besy pain
Out of danger / of these kings twain
Till through Fortune / he came fro myschefe fre
To the presence / of king ydume
In simple array / and torn apparayle
Whereof the king / greatly began marvel
Tose his pouert / in so low manner
But for all that / he made him good chere
Though that time / he were unfortunate
He him receives / like to his estate
And when they were / both twain alone
In complaining / Vlixes made his moan
Unto the king / as he that was full sage
Ceryously / the sort of his passage
With face sad / and a sobre chere
Fro point to point / anon as ye shall here
My lord quod he / shortly to express
Of trust I have / in your gentyllesse
I shall to you / mine auentures all
Rehearse here / right as it is fall.
First when that I / Troy land forsook
And the water / with my ships took
I was anon / with wind pesyble blow
To an y^le / which was to me unknow
Called Mirma / of great hab^^daunce
And all thing / that was to my plesaunce
That may for silver / or for gold be bought
I ready found / and wanted right naught
And there abode / full long while in joy
With the treasoure / that I gat at Troy
My ships stuffed / my men hole and sound
And for co^modyte / of that ylke gounde
We lyked so / the country enuyron
That for disporte / and recreacyon
Our tariynge there / we thought not full long
For no man did / unto us no wrong
Till on a day / that the eyer was still
The wind also / fully at our will
We sailed forth / in quyete and in pees
Unto a port / called Claustafages
Wherewith my meyne / long and many day
I found all thing / according to my pay
The weder lusly / agreeable and fair
But who may trust / outher in wind or air
For upon faith / of the smothe sky
Again to ship / fast I began me hye
Tarried naught / but took anon the sea
Smothe and calm / endurynge days three
That in the weder / found was no lack
But sodaynely / the heaven tourneth black
The hydous tempest / and the wawes grene
Out of hope / have me dispeyred clean
Troubled my spirit / and made me so pensyfe
Without refute / to escape with the life
Tossyd and driven / by many sundry isle
Till at the last / cast up at Cecyle
Recurynge land / with great annoye and pain
Where that time reigned / kings twain
And as I can / remebre douteles
The tone of them / called Sorygenes
Which unto me / full contraryous was
And the the other / named Coclopas
Brethren of birth / and in conclusyon
Ylyke cruel / of condycyon
For though my sort / had shape for the nones
Both twain / fylle on me attones
Oppressynge / in full great distress
Spoiled my ships / of treasour and richesse
And for pity / lyked not to spare
Till I was left / destytute and bare
Of all my good alas / my mortal chance
And most of all / was to me greuaunce
When of my gold / they may no more restrain
They sent down / their mighty sons twain
Alypham / that was full large and long
And Polypheme / the mighty gyau^t strong
Which on my men / to avenge the^ were so feign
That they of them / have an hundred slain
Disarayed / to stand at diffence
And of malice / with sudden vyolence
They took me / for myschefe almost lorne
And Alphenor / mine own brother sworn
And hatefully / as they have us found
In chains cast / and in stocks bound
And after that / ylocked in prison
And for to make / platly mencyon
This mighty man / this great Polypheme
A suster had / shortly for to deem
One of the fairest / that ever yet was borne
She might in beauty / so besette aforne
Nature her gave / such a prerogatyfe
A clean maid / sothly and no wife
Flourynge both / in fayrenesse and bounte
Whom Alphenor / when he did se
Albe he was / fetred in prison
For love he lost / wit and eke reason
And wexe all mad / so narowe she did hy^ bind
Save upon her / always was his mind
And closed aye / was his peryllous wound
And six months / thus we lay bound
Both he and I / to say the platte truth
Till Polypheme / had upon us ^outhe
And thorugh his grace / and medyacyon
He quyt us fre / out of that prison
And showed us / of mercy and pity
After our sorrow / great humanyte
But Alphenor / ylyke of one intent
Was with the bronde / of Cupyde brent
And felt his part / with many mortal fyt
Till he so wrought / with his sotyll wit
That on a night / who was leef or loath
He stale this maid / and his way he goth
Thorugh help of men / with him at that time
But on the morrow / at the hour of pryme
Polyphemus / began us for to sewe
Whose mighty hand / we might not eschew
And such assaute / on us they began make
That of force / they have the maid take
From Alphenor / mauge all his rage
And Polypheme / unto my damage
With his knights / so sore upon me lay
That I might / uneath escape away
To save my self / compassyd enuyron
To death pursued / of that champyon
But when I saw / there was no other gain
To fle the death / shortly for to said
While this geaunt / most freesly on me set
With my sword / out his eye I smette
And unto ship / with my company
I fled in haste / that no man might espy
Where I be came / nor Alphenor my fere
And when the wawes / began for to clear
And gracyous wind / began to us a wake
That country / we have anon forsake
It was not wholesome / for us to abide
But of this man / like as wryt Ouyde
Polyphemus / the Geaunt out of dread
Had an eye / amyd of his forhede
Which vlixes / smote out at a stroke
And like the brows / of a braunched oak
Was all his here / and his long berde
On whom to look / children were aferde
And when that he / had lost his sight
Among the hills / he ronneth day and night
In a rage to find / him some refuge
Cast rocks / and great stones huge
On every part / enuyron the country
On Vlixes / avenged for to be
Thus says Ouyde / in conclusyon
In his book / of transformacyon
Methamorphoseos / there ye may it se
When so ever / that your leyser be
Ce^yously / the storye for to read
And in writing / forth I will proceed
How vlixes / with face deed and pale
To ydumee / told forth his tale
Re^ersynge thus / supprysed and awaked
Fro Polypheme / when we were escaped
Thorugh our unhappy / and infelycyte
Into an isle / mids of the sea
We were drive / when it began to night
And Elodiu^ / that little kingdom hight
Where that Circes / the great enchaunteresse
Thylke time / was Lady and goddess
Th^^ could her craft / so wonderly perform
All sodaynely / a man for to transform
To have the likeness / and lose his reason
Of horse / of bear / Tygre or lion
Wolf / or fox / or what her list deuyse
Her dredefull craft / was shapen in such wise
So mighty were / her strange pocyons
Her letuaryes / and confeccyons
And she also / so fair upon to se
That fro her power / no man might fle
For by the work / of this sorceresse
I was so founcyd / upon her fayrenesse
That finally / thus with me it stood
That all a year / I with her abode
And plainly had / power none nor might
For to depart / nouther day nor night
So lusty was / the life that I ladde
In which time / by me a child she had
Right inly fair / and goodly to the sight
And Thelagonyus / in sothenesse he hight
Which afterward / I well rehearse can
By process / wexe a manly man
And by my sotyle secret / prouydence
Of her craft / I had experyence
That maugre / her enchauntementes old
I stale away / she might me not hold
And finally / my fate to conclude
With my conning / her craft I began delude
That with my men / I escaped fro her hand
And went at large fre / out of her land
But all this thing / me little did avail
For on my way / as I began to sail
For all my sleyghte / in a little while
Yblowe was up / into an isle
Where Calypha / suster to Circes
Was crowned queen / and held her scepter in pees
Whose crafts were / so mighty and so strong
Maugre my will / she held me there full long
But she in sothe / to speak of womanhede
Of bounte fredome / and of goodlyhede
Surely had / so sovereign excellence
That mine abode / to me was none offense
But who so ever / there at cry or clappe
At the last / I escaped / fro her trappe
And came to an Isle / right as any line
Which specially / thorugh hye power dyuyne
Ordained is / of yore by miracle
As it were / a spiritual oracle
A man to have / in a temple there
Sudden answer / of what him list enquere
Of questyons / and demaundes all
And of souls / what shall eke befalle
When men are deed / and graven vnderstone
And I began axe / in the temple anon
Mine auentures / that should after sewe
And where a man / might his fate eschew
And of all this / like to mine intent
I had answer / full conuenyent
Save what befalls / when a soul is gone
Diffynycyon / unto me was none
Such thing to assoyle / accords not to right
It is reseruyd / unto gods might
And excedeth reason / and wit of man
And fro thense / forth to sail I began
Driven with wind / and no part socoured
Where I was like / to have be devoured
Of Karybdes / with his profounde well
Where Syrenes / Meremaydenes dwell
That fro the breast / with scales silver shene
Be of their shape / fysshes fresshe and clean
And over more / kind does compass
Them to appear / Femynyne of face
Like virgyns / that were of nature
Without spot / vndefouled pure
And of custom / in wawes as they flete
The song of them / is to heavenly sweet
So Aungelyke / and full of Armonye
That verily / the sugared melodye
Rauysshe would / any man a live
Of inly joy / almost his heart ryue
Make a man / of sudden hye plesaunce
Foryet him self / and lose his remembrance
Deuoyde him clean / from his own thought
Till unawarely / he be to myschefe brought
And with their song / or he take keep
He shall be brought / in a mortal sleep
And they anon / it may not be withdraw
Will drenche his ship / low under the wawe
Thus the swetnesse / of their heavenly sown
Brings a man / to con fusyowne
Who so ever / by their bounds pass
But with the life / I escaped by grace
For mine eres / with wax and gummes clear
Were stopped so / that I ne might here
Touch nor werble / of their instrumentis
Whereby the reason / of a man blinded is
And finally / thorugh my sotylte
I and my men / be escaped fre
Saylynge forth / all mate of werynesse
Till we came up / with full great distress
At Phenyce / and took anon the land
Cast anchor / and our ships bond
But sothly there / it fill us full vnfayre
For the people / cruel and contrayre
Oonly of malice / fill on me anon
And slew my men / almost euerychone
Tresoure and good / little that I had
Was me berafte / and all with them they ladde
And few of them / that were left a live
They took them / and put in prison blyue
Thus has Fortune / lad me an her dance
With little joy / and plente of myschaunce
Of whose danger / lernyd and expert
I am fall in mychefe / and pouerte
And with great dole / and sorrow full my breest
On see and land / by Southe and not by Eest
I am come / unto your presence
And have declared / plainly in sentence
Mine auentures / to your worthynesse
Of trust oonly / and of faythfulnesse
That I have to you / in special
And now I have / rehersyd and told all
To your highness / and my best wise
Without more / to me it does suffyse
And though in heart / he was constrained sore
Thylke time / Vlixes / spoke no more
But held his peace / full heavy in lokynge
And Ydumeus / like a gentle king
Comforted him / all that ever he might
And besy was / his heart for to light
And him besought / his heaviness let
And as long / as him list in Crete
With him abide / he made him suerte
He should fare / also well as he
And not want / of what may do him ease
And when his sorrow / some what began apease
That his cage / drew unto an end
Leave he took / and said he would wend
Out of tha^ land / home to his country
But first the king / of fredome and bounte
Gave unto him / great richesse and array
And what so ever / was to his pay
Gold treasour / and many other things
And at partynge / of these two kings
There were / ships / when him list to sail
Ready stuffyd / with meyne and vytayle
And thus vlixes / began him ready make
And when he has / his leave fully take
He hasted him / and took anon the sea
And began sail / toward his country
But first he went / to king Alphenon
Which passyngly / had affection
To se vlixes / at his home coming
And desirous / over all thing
To have of him / newely aqueyntaunce
For unto him / was inly great plesaunce
To here him talk / for his eloquence
For his wisdom / and his hye prudence
And there he was / after all his smerte
Received plainly / with as glad an heart
As ever yet / was any manner man
Sythen time / that the world began.
And to increase / of his Felycytee
There herd he first / of Penolopee
His true wife / without spot of blame
Of whom yet grene / is the noble fame
Which from her lord / for all his long absence
In thought nor deed / never did offense
But sothly was / both in chere and deed
Thorugh out Greece / exaumple of womanhede
And yet was she / as books list express
Thorugh out the world / Myrour of fayrenesse
And among Greeks / borne of highest blood
Called of Auctours / both fair and good
And yet say books / of her doutlees
Was never none / that had so great prees
But she her kept / chaungynge for no new
Unto her lord / ever ylyke true
Of heart aye one / not parted into twain
That she is called / queen and sovereign
Of wifely truth / in this books old
And often I find / her heart would cold
She turn pale / fro her lord so far
In her closet / to here of the werre
Of dread she had / and fro fere eke quake
Of fantasyes / for her lords sake
For his absence / both eve and morrow
Was death unto her / and importable sorrow
And aye in sothe / for joy or any game
When it fill / she herd Ectors name
In any place anon / she fylle a swowne
And began her self / in teres drown
Of womanhede / so she was a ferde
To here the slaughter / of his mortal sword
List her lord / of knyghtly surquedye
Had of Fortune / fall in ieopardye
Of hap or sort / to a met y^ worthy knight
That selde or never / she felt her heart light
And many dreme / a nyghtes did her gaste
All the while / that the sege last
And every play / was venym in her sight
When that she was / from her own knight
For in this world / joy had she none
Of hye nor low / plainly but of one
For whose sake / all myrthe she refuses
And who so be / that in his heart museth
Of any woman / any thing but good
Of melancolye / meuyd in his blood
Let him aduerte / of wisdom and ysee
And remember / on Penolopee
For his decert / list that he be blamyd
And o Guydo / thou should be ashamyd
To say of wives / any thing but well
For in good faith / as far as I can feel
Though one or two / do among offense
She that is good / thorugh her prouydence
Is thereof / no thing for to wit
And though Guydo / in his book endyte
The varyaunce / of Eleyne / or Creseyde
Or Medea / that for sorrow deyde
Let the again / of right and equytee
The wifely truth / of Penolopee
The maydenhode / of young Polycene
And the goodness / of Eccuba the queen
Of Cassandra eke / the stedefastnesse
And with all this / take the kyndenesse
Of Pantasylle / without varyaunce
And put all this / togydre in balaunce
And ye shall find / if ye list accounte
Maugre who grutcheth / troth shall surmou^te
I dare afferme / and bear away the pryse
There will no man / replye that is wise
He were to feeble / in his oppynyon
And while vlixes / was with Alphenon
It was to him / made relacyon
Of an hateful / conspiracyon
That certain lords / enuyron his country
Bauysshe wold^ / his queen Penolopee
Maugre all tho / that were there again
Albe that she was / ever ylyke plain
In her truth / steadfast as a wall
Yet they have cast / platly that she shall
Be take of Force / it may not be eschewed
But if so be / in haste she be reskewed
For they them cast / the time not aiourne
For day and night / with her they soiourne
Inly in heart / for love disamayde
But of wisdom / she has them so delayde
That there was none / so manly nor so sage
That could of her / get advantage
So auyse she was / in her werkynge
And when vlixes / conceyueth all this thing
And fully knew / by open euydence
And had also / in special credence
Sent unto him / fro Penolopee
The matter hole / declarynge in secretee
His own sone / Thelamonyus
He wexe in heart / wood and Furyous
And would make / no dylacyon
But in all haste / besoughte Alphenon
The mighty king / of his hye bounte
To releue him / in his aduersyte
And that he would / thorugh his mighty hand
Of gentyllesse / conueye him to his land
He grants him / and say not ones nay
And both two / in full great array
Took the sea / when the wind was good
Well fortuned / for no thing them withstode
They be aryued / and had no lettynge
Where vlixes / as ye have herd was king
And secretly in a night / they were conveyed
To them that have / his lygaunce disobeyed
And mercyles / or they might awake
In their beds / they have them all take
Making no prolongynge / till the morrow
But in all have / for no wight durst the^ borowe
Smette of their hedes / by Jugement fynall
And set them upon / the castle wall
Eueryche by other / endelonge the row
Upon the toure / when the kocke began crow
And thus all night / they kept them self close
Till that Phoebus / meryly arose
In the Oryent / when the lark song
And tho these kings / with their meyne strong
Fresshely besene / enter the Cytee
Who was tho glad / but Penolopee
Who made joy / but this goodly queen
Full desirous / her own lord to seen
But if I should / all in order set
The great myrthe / they made when they met
Make rehersayle / of complayntes old
And how they began / their hertes to unfold
Each to other / and list no thing concele
And the gladness / that they inly feel
If I should / put all in memory
The reioysynge / and the hertely glory
That his lyeges / made at his coming
The costs eke / they had at his metynge
The gifts great / and presents rich
In all this world / It cow none ylyche
It were to long tariynge / for my book
And how that he / new assurance took
Of his lords / and lyeges all
And how that they / to his grace fall
The chere he made / eke to Alphenowne
Of gentyllesse / thorugh his hye renown
And how the daughter / inly debonayre
Of Alphenon / Nausica the fair
By vlixes / medyacyon
Yweddyd was / unto Thelamon
Borne by descent / there may no man say nay
To rejoice his crown / after his day
And thus came in / by his purueaunce
Of two reygnes / the mighty allyaunce
And how all this / brought was to the knotte
Men would deem / plainly me to sotte
To presume / of oppynyon
For to delate / a description
Sythen Guydo / touching but the chief
In this matter of style / was but brefe
Shortly rehersynge / how king Alphenon
Repeyred is / home to his regyon
And vlixes / in his chief Cytee
Abode stylle / with Penolopee
Where I him leave / in joy and in solace
Till Antropos / lyketh to purchase
For to Fychche / finally the date
The threde to untwine / of his lives fate.
How the translatoure writes the stock of Pyrrus by lyncall dyscent / and how
his Fader hight Pelleus / and his graunmoder called Thetydes. Capitulo xxxvij.
NOw must I full besy be a while
To direct / the tracys of my style
In descryuynge / shortly of intent
The stock of py^^us / by lyneal disce^t
Mine Auctour follow / and be compendyous
Whose old Fader / hight Pelleus
His graunmoder / called Therydes
Of which two / came worthy Achylles
That at Troy / by treason lost his life
And Dardanyca / called was his wife
Pyrrus mother / and daughter as I read
Unto the king / called Lychomede
Having a Fader that Acastus hight
Which in sothnesse / all that ever he might
Bare heavy heart / to king Pelleus
To Achylles / and also to Pyrrus
To all the kyn / plainly on that side
And of malice / rancoure and of pride
And of envy in an hateful rage
When Pelleus / salie was in age
He berafte him / both scepter and crown
And from his see / low a light him down
And into exyle / avail way no strife
He made him go / with Thetydes his wife
Of hye disdeyne / gain may no grace
And in his heart / began day and night compace
The death of Pyrrus / keep him if he can
And thereupon / malycyously began
To shape away / by awayte lyinge
Him for to sle / at his home coming
But this Pyrrus / from his treynes free
Many danger / escaped of the sea
Many wawe / and many tempest wode
With great loss / both of men and good
At Malasus / alder first began land
A strong Cite / a little fro the stronde
Where that he was / refresshed wonder well
And there he knew / ground and euerydele
First of Thexyle / like as men him told
Of Therydes / and Pelleus the old
And how Atastus / bare to him hatrede
Unto the death / whereof he began dread
And thought he would / as he y^ was right wise
By some engyne / eschew his malyse
And thereupon / do his besy pain
Nowhadde Atastus / other sons twain
Menalyppus / and Polystenes
And adoughter / ycalled Thetydes
And all this while / woeful Pelleus
In a Castle old / and ruynous
With Thetydes / full of sorrow and care
For dread of death / day and night began dare
Disespeyred / in his unwieldy age
Recure to find / of this mortal rage
Except that he had / an hope of yore
That Pyrrus / should help him and restore
At his repeyre / when so that it fall
After whose coming / often he began call
The time curse / that he so long abode
But when Pyrrus / all this understood
At Malasus / by relacyowne
Full fast he began / haste out of the town
Took the sea / and fast began him hye
Toward the land / called Thesalye
Ofentent / to make ordinance
On Atastus / for to do vengaunce
But alderfirste / this Pyrrus full prudent
Espyes twain / he tofore has sent
To Thesalye / forth togydre gone
And Crylyppus / called was the tone
And Adastrus / named was his fere
They were expert / them needs not to lere
In whose expleyte / to more advantage
This Pyrrus has / direct his massage
Of Thesalye / to a Cyteseyne
Called Assandrus / a manner chaumberleyne
With Pelleus / and whylom full secree
While he was / flourynge in Felycytee
And when Pyrrus / in conclusyon
Knew all the sothe / by relacyon
On see / nor land / him ne list to tarry
Albe that he / found the wind contrary
But he ^^caped / many dredefull stoundes
Of Thesalye / aprocheth to the bounds
For Eolus / that his lust obeyed
And of Fortune / won^erly con^eyed
He driven was / as it were by grace
To aryue / in the same place
Where Pelleus / in a doleful cave
For dread of death / lay him self to save
Sool save his wife / withouten any ferys
All enclosyd / with husshes and with brerys
And Pyrrus / there went up first to sonde
Sool by him self / walking on the stronde
Pensyfe and tryste / and his way took
Where Pelleus / in the cave quoke
Having with him / tho none other guide
Save his sword / hanging by his side
And un warely / with a dredefull heart
Pelleus / out of the cave sterte
Disamayde / of his life in doubt
When he beheld a knight / there walk about
And astoned / abode / and stood full stylle
Imagining / that he saw Achylle
By this Pyrrus / stondynge in the place
By all the signs / showed in his face
For nature / without varyaunce
Made them so like / of chere and countenance
Of form / of shape / and lymmes euerychone
That difference / in effect was none
And Pelleus / without longer space
Began anon Pyrrus / to enbrace
And abrayde out / of his deedly thought
And for joy / set all his sorrow at naught
And began to him / by and by declare
Both his exyle / and his evil fare
His pyteous life / his pouerte and myschaunce
And Fortunes / false varyaunce
And of Atastus / the fervent hoote envy
The cruelte / and the Tyranny
Ceryously / he told Pyrrus all
And he full sobre / stood stylle as a wall
With face pale / and in heart wroth
Specheles / to ship again he gothe
And there he was / informed douteles
That Menalyppus / and Polystenes
And Atastus / togydre / all three
With huge array / and a great meyne
The same day / full surquedous of pride
Hunte in a Forest / little there beside
And when Pyrrus / thereof took good head
Without abode / change began his wede
Full porely rent / and disarayed
Like a man / that were for thought dismayed
Gyrte with his sword / made no delay
But to the forest / took the right way
Sool by him self / without company
So secretly / that no man might espy
And as he drowghe / many diverse bounds
He herd horns / vncouplynge of hounds
And like a man / that list make his moan
Fro sight of folk / he drew him aye alone
And casuelly / disseueryd fro the prees
First he met / with Polystenes
Menalyppus / riding by his side
And both two / on Pyrrus began abide
And boystously / of him to enquere
Fro when se he came / and also what he were
So febly cladde / and of so pore estate
Walking there / as he were desolate
And lowly he / of chere and countenance
Still and humble / in his dalyaunce
Answerde again / and said how that he
Fordyuen was / with myschefe of the sea
And affermed pale / and no thing read
His fellowship / drowned was and deed
Five hundred / the wawes were so rage
Of old and young / and of medell age
And he escaped / the tempest was so ryfe
As he them told / uneath with the life
And over more / he told them platly eke
Touching his birth / that he was a greek
And went there / destytur of joy
Late come / fro the sege of Troy
And besought them / toward his living
To help him / with some refresshynge
As him that had / catell lost and good
Like as they saw / naked how he stood
Prayinge also in hope / it should avail
Him to releue / with clothing or vytayle
To his refute / somewhat to provide
And they had him / that he should abide
For they will wit / plainly what he can
And that while / beside them there ran
A full great heart / down by the river
And Menalyppus / prycked his courser
As it sempte / it was to him dew
Thorugh thynne / and thycke only to pursewe
He spares not / but always after rode
And his brother / with Pyrrus stylle abode
Polystenes / and took of it no head
But in all haste / alyght fro his stead
On the grene / to rest him there beside
As he that was / weary for to ride
Without meyne / being him self sool
Lys^ynge of Pyrrus / the complaynte and y^ dool
But sodaynely / or he might aduerte
Cruel Pyrrus / ran him to the heart
And left him deed / lyinge on the plain
When Menalyppus / repeyred was again
Seeing his brother / baskyn in his blood
And Pyrrus efte / furyous and wode
With a face / of color pale and wan
To Menalyppus / in his ire ran
And slew him eke / or that he took head
And thus they lay / on the ground and blede
The brethren two / with Pyrrus swerd yslawe
And he anon / aside began him draw
Metynge aknyght / were it of sort or caas
As says the storye / called Cynaras
Of whom Pyrrus / began in haste enquere
Whose man he was / or what he did there
And he answerde / and made no tariynge
He was servant / with the mighty king
Called Atastus / lord of that country
And Pyrrus tho / of dedely enmyte
With cruel sword / all fresshe and read of blood
Ran him thorugh out / as any Lion wode
And after that / the forest he forsook
And in all haste / the right way he took
To ship again / pale and black of hew
And began anon / to array him new
All in purpyll / which as clerks tells
Is for kings / and for no wight else
And than Pyrrus / fresshe and well deseyne
To the forest / repeyred is again
Where sodaynely / of hap in his walking
In short while / he met with the king
Old Atastus / that asked of Pyrrus
What man art thou / that by thy self thus
Walkyst thus here / all day to and fro
Certes quod Pyrrus / full of sorrow and woe
Inly supprysed / of hertely complaining
One of the sons / of Pryamus the king
I was whylom / now put out of memory
When that Troy / flouryd in his glory
Now refutles / into myschefe brought
I walk sool / full of care and thought
For in exyle / out of Troy town
With cruel Pyrrus / to live in prysowne
Bound unto him / though me be full loathe
My hand assured / with many full great oath
To obey his lust / in captyuyte
Loo: here is all / thus it stands with me
Atastus tho / of entencyon
After many / other questyon
Enqueryd of him / in his dalyaunce
If he knew / ought of Pyrrus governance
Or if that he / could ought understand
Where he him kept / sithe he came to land
Ywysse quod he / if ye list him have
He keeps him close / in yonder cave
Among bruskayle / with a shrouded face
Making a sign / to the same place
And all was done / for an ydell mase
For while the king / thyderwarde began gase
Hasty Pyrrus / began his sword out draw
In purpose fully / Atastus to have slawe
But wonderly / the storye can you lere
Queen Thetydes / did anon appear
All be rayned / with teres on her face
And began the sword / of Pyrrus to enbrace
Prayinge him / his deedly hand restrain
Have you not slain / my young brethren twain
And now alas / my Fader hoar and gray
Mercyles / fro me wylt take away
Put up the sword / and no blood ne shede
And have pity / upon thy kynrede
And aduerte clearly / to the fine
How thou art come / of the same line
And hateful is / who look a right
Unkind blood / in every man's sight
And Pyrrus tho / as any Tygre wroth
Began afferme / with many full great oath
That who so grutche / or against plain
He shall him sle / with his hondes twain
For has not he / by false extorsyon
Put Pelleus / out of his regyon
Which is your lord / and ye his true wife
That finally / he shall lose his life
And here anon / of mine hands deye
In this matere / there is no more to seye
But Pelleus / darynge in the cave
Of grace oonly / list his life to save
All other help / platly is for naught
And Pelleus / was anon forth brought
Crooked and old / unwieldy eke to se
And tofore Pyrrus / fill down on his kn^
Besechynge him / with apyteous face
At his request / take him to grace
And that he would / in his manly heart
Goodly consydre / the deedly woe and smerte
Of Atastus / and the mortal pain
That he had / for his sons twain
Which lay deed / tofore him on the grene
Slain with your sword / y^ is so sharp and kene
Which he ne may / recure in no wise
The sorrow of which / ought enough suffyse
Though ye on him / do no more vengaunce
All this peysyd / justly in balaunce
Sith he is hoolly / submyttyd to your might
Take now him / to mercy anon right
And let your sword / his age not consume
This my request / as I dare presume.
ANd than Pyrrus / shortly for to said
Wha^ he had / put up his sword agayue
Seeing mercy / might most avail
Without words / or any rehersayle
First of all / tofore them euerychone
The kings made / accord into one
By his wisdom / concludynge up in deed
That each of them / should his right possede
In Thesalye / partyd into twain
That neither had / matter to complain
Eueryche to reygne / in his dew see
And while they were / togydre all three
Out of presence / of any other man
Atastus first / thus his tale began
Syres quod he / to you is not unknow
How thorugh age / now I am brought low
And thorugh natures / kyndely mocyon
Am wexed feeble / of wit and reason
Being unwieldy / of my lymmes all
So many years / are upon me fall
And can uneath / any thing discern
To feeble in sothe / a kingdom to govern
Of life nor death / taking now no head
Sith my sons / slain be and deed
And sool left / now without heir
Of worldly lust / fully in dispeyre
The time passyd / of my felycyte
Fortunes turn / with mutabylyte
Has taught me / plainly I dare it well express
In worldly joy / is no sykernesse
Nor very trust / no while to abide
But I will now / for my self provide
And in all haste / by prudent purueaunce
Me discharge / of all governance
Again my sort / me list not malygne
But scepter / and crown freely I resygne
Of Thesalye / lorshyp and eke land
Of my fre will / hole into thy hand
There shall no man / reclayme nor say nay
Interupte / nor make no delay
Touching this thing / by no collusyon
For I the put / in possessyon
And hereupon / of all that ever he said
Making full faith / his hand in his he laid
Queen Thetydes / sitting there present
And Pelleus / of the same intent
Unto Pyrrus / for his purpartye
Resygned eke / his right of Thesalye
Fully affermynge / that of yore ago
His full desire / and his joy also
Was ever in one / his neuewe to succeed
As rightful heir / his kingdom to possede
And utterly / without repentance
All that longs / unto my lygeaunce
Scepter and sword / crown and dyademe
So as a king / life and death to deem
Into thy hand / without longer date
This same hour / holy to translate
And when the knot / of this conuencyon
Was fully brought / to conclusyon
Performed up / hole the unity
For evermore / atwene these kings three.
Atastus knights / disseueryd enuyrowne
Out of the forest / be descendyd down
And by bidding / platly of their lord
They were echone / sworn to this accord
And attones / this lusty company
To Thesalye / fast began them hye
And Pyrrus / folk lyinge on the sea
Be sailed forth / straight to the Cytee
And Atastus / does set a Parliament
Where openly / he gave commandment
That all his lyeges / of hye or low estate
Without strife / or any more debate
Specially / of gentle blood yborne
The same day / to Pyrrus to be sworn
Like their degrees / in the royal halle
To persevere / his true lyeges all
During their life / for ernest or for game
And Pelleus / commands has the same
For his party / without any fraud
And thus with joy / and solemn laud
Pyrrus was / of every manner age
Gladly / accepted / to his heritage
And on a day / fortunat and good
With glad aspectis / when the heaven stood
Well according / to such manner thing
Worthy Pyrrus / was ycrowned king
Of Thesalye / the rich regyon
It were but vain / to make mencyon
Of their revel / nor their great array
Nor of the feste / made the same day
Eke in the storye / I find it not in sothe
I will pass over / as mine Auctour does
Save in his book / it is specefyed
That the kingdom / was fer magnefyed
Of Thesalye / by great might
Of this Pyrrus / whylom so good a knght
Where I se him / in his royal see
Tournynge again / to king ydumee
Which in this while / was grave under stone
And after him / his sone Meryone
The storye says / was crowned king of Crete
But a while / reygnynge in equity
He deyed also / it would be none other
And than in haste / Leorica his Brother
As rightful heir / by succession
Was crowned king / of that regyon
In which time / Atastus out of dread
By the assent / of Pyrrus as I read
Full besy was / to make in special
A rich toumbe / passyngly royal
Where buried were / with full huge prees
Menalyppus / and Polystenes
Both two / in the forest slawe
Thorugh Pyrrus sword / by full cruel law
Of them / can I / none other process make
But even there / fully my tale I take
Of them both / and also eke yfere
Of Atastus / their own fader dear
Of whom sothly / for all his locks hoar
In Troy book / read I can no more
But now must I / again to Pyrrus wend
To write of him / the sorry woeful end
Which when he sat / highest in his see
Made full blind / with vain prosperyte
Gouernynge / the land of Thesalye
He falsely fill / on a fantasye
To set his love / on Hermyon the queen
Horestes wife / reygnynge in Methene
For whom he brent / hot as any fire
And in fulfyllynge / of his foul desire
His purpose hole / thus he brought about
Her rauysshynge / while her lord was out
Ladde her home / and held her as his wife
Semynge to him / it was a blysfull life
And full relese / of his pains smerte
Of which / Horestes bare full heavy heart
And cast him plainly / auengyd for to be
When he may / have opportunyte
For that time / though he had wrong
He was to feeble / and Pyrrus was to strong
Which held also / in storye it is told
Andronomecha / with him in household
Ectors wife / by whom whylom she had
Alytell child / which with her she ladde
The sege complete / and destruccyowne
When she was brought / out of Troy town
Lamedouta / I find was his name
Encreasynge after / to full worthy fame
And by Pyrrus / she had a sone also
Called Achylleydos / so as wryt Guydo
And these women / for all their great estate
Atwene them self / among were at debate
And Hermyone / in her ire all hot
In complaining / to her Fader wrote
That her fere / for all her hye degree
Andronomecha / was cherisshed better tha^ she
Of king Pyrrus / besechynge Menelay
To enhaste him / in all that ever he may
Come him self anon / that it were do
To sle this woman / and her child also
And he abode not / but fast began him hye
In an hete / toward Thesalye
To be venged / with his sword of stele
Upon her / that trespasseth never adele
But maugre him / in all his cruelte
She was reskewed / amyd of the Cite
It is a thing / which has not be herd
To a woman / a king to draw his sword
I will no more / in this matter dwell
In manner shamed / it to write or tell
But this was done / while Pyrrus of courage
To Delos was gone / on pilgrimage
Having with him / but a little route
To Appollo / to knele and to loute
For the soul / to pray of Achylle
And his vows / also to fulfylle
And thank him / with humble affection
Of god exployte / he had at Troy town
And for wreche / also that was take
At the Cite / for his Faders sake
But all this thing / here yspecefyed
King Horestes / warely has espied
And to Delos / began haste him full right
Ledynge with him / many lusty knight
And unawarely / he with Pyrrus met
And vengeably / upon him he set
That finally / in that strange land
Horestes slew him / with his own hand
I find in sothe / he made no defense
So sudden was / the mortal vyolence
Of his enmye / he could not asterte
For or that he might / his sword aduerte
He was on him / enuyron all deset
Thylke time / it might be no bet
For there was / nouther socoure nor declyne
Thus was Pyrrus / brought unto his fine
Late crowned / king of Thesalye
Loo: here / the guerdon / of anoutrye
Lo: how the mede / and reward is full ryfe
To mysse use / another man's wife
It is no dread / follow shall vengaunce
Sudden death / or unware myschaunce
Which every man / greatly ought charge
And in Delos / in a temple large
King Pyrrus / was locked under stone
And Horestes / forth his way is gone
And by force / gat his wife again
There was no wight / durst him tho wtsayne
And to Methene / proudely is repeyred
And Thesalye / pyteously dispeyred
Destytute / as they that can no read
When they wyste / their worthy king was deed
And heir was none / by succession
To govern / that noble regyon
Save Achylleydos / that but iytell aforne
In Pyrrus absence / was in Greece borne
Fully of age / not a quarter clean
The youth of whom / sothly was to grene
Who list consydre / and to render of might
Full many day / to rejoice his right
And to govern / with Scepter in his hand
The large bounds / of so great a land
And yet this child / lykely and right feyre
In very soth / was borne to be heir
After Pyrrus / this the truth plain
There was no man / that list it withsayne
But I find / when he came to age
He resygned / hole his heritage
To his brother / freely and his right
Lamedoute / a wonder manly knight
That was descended / of troy anysshe blood
Down fro the stock of him that was so good
Flower of knyghthode / diffence of Frigya
That him begat / on Andromecha
Ordained now / who so gru^che or frown
Of Thesalye / for to bear the crown
And when he was / made lord of that land
And all was freely / resygned to his hand
He has commanded / no man dare replye
Thorugh the kyngome / of all Thesalye
That all that were / in captyuyte
Or prisoners / of Troy the Cite
For love or hate / excepcyon was none
That all should / at their large gone
By full assent / of Achylleydos
And such as were eke / in prison cloos
Without raunson / shall belyuered be
And rejoice / the full lyberte
By custom used / both in borugh and town
Of the lyeges / of great regyon
And thus the folk / y^ came thralle fro Troy
Restored be / sodaynely to joy
By Lamedoute / and ymade free
And he eke reygneth / in his royal see
Full myghtely / as I have made mind
In Troy book / no more of him I find
Nor of Pyrrus / nor of his kynrede
Fro hensforth / I can no process read
But incydentes / that bear no substance
Which were but vain / to put in remembrance
Except mine Auctor / I note to what intent
Here impeth in me / a little incydent
Ywrought and done of full yore agon
Touching the death / of king Menon
Which by envy / of cruel Achylles
Was slain / in sothe among myrundones
O only for he / proudely began pursewe
Upon Achylles / Troylus to reskewe
Whom king Pryam / made buried be
Beside Troylus / in Troy the Cite
In a temple / ybylte / of marbyll old
And to what fine / this tale is told
In this Chapitle / I shall rehearse anon
THe noble queen / of this king Menon
After the time / long and many day
That she was deed / and graven under clay
At the toumbe / heavenly began appear
All beset / with bright sterres clear
Whose symylytude / for to reken all
Was like a thing / that were immortal
That no man might / utterly sustene
To behold / of look / she was so shene
Down descendynge / fro the fyrmament
Full many man / being there present
Clade in a mantell / full celestyall
And of her port / passyngly royal
With swetnesse / fresshe as any rose
Made in all haste / the toumbe to unclose
Of her lord / and takes out the bones
And in a cheste / made of gold and stones
She couched them / as fast as ever she may
Disapered / and went anon her way
And tofore that / nor after in certain
In that place / she was never said
Some affermynge / as by lyklynesse
She was outher / angel or goodesse
The soul or fate / of the same king
I can not deem / in such heavenly thing
Nor therm hold / none oppynyon
For it transcendeth / shortly my reason
And me list not / in such matter diffyne
But resort / right as any line
To vlixes / and a while dwell
Of his end / the surplus for to tell
And how that he / might not escape
The parodye / that was for him shape
For parchas have / his last term set
And Antropose / mesured out and met
His lives threde / on the rock sponne
Diffende thy self / Vlixes if thou konne
Show thy manhood / and be not aferde
And be welfare / of thy sons sword.
For I shall now / like as I am wont
Sha^pe my pen / both rude and blonte
To descryue / the fine of thy soioure
Upon the bounds / set of my labor
For almost weary / feynt / and weyke enough
Be the vestes / and oxes of my plough
The long day / again the hylle to wend
But almost / now at the lands end
Of Troy book / fychche I will a stake
Save I must spend / a few lines blake
The last chapitre / shortly to translate
Of all this work / and Ympen in the date
Of that day / death set on him arest
Full execute / by him he loved best.
Low on my knees / now I must loute
To this god / y^ makes men to route
And causes folk / to have glad sweuenes
Both at morrow / and on lusty Euenes
When Mortheus / with slepy wonde
Which that he holds / always in his hand
Has marked them / again the derke night
To make men / both merry and light
And some while / for to have gladness
And sodaynely / to fall in heaviness
Like as to them / he gives euydence
By sundry signs / in his appearance
Unto that lord / now must I mekely preye
At this time / my style to conueye
Of vlixes / the dreme to descryue
The last of all / he had by his live
Declarynge him / by tokens full notable
And by signs / very demonstrable
As he slepte / again the pale moon
His fatal day / that should follow soon
For it fy^l thus / as he a bed lay
After my onyght / tofore the morrow gray
Him thought he saw / appear a creature
To his sight / celestyall of Figure
None erthly thing / but verily dyuyne
Of port and chere / wonder Femynyne
And as him sempte / in his fantasye
Like a thing / sent out of Fayrye
For the beauty / of her goodly face
Recomforted / plainly all the place
Most surmountynge / and most sovereign
And the clerenesse / of her eyes twain
All sodaynely / or men might aduerte
Perce would / even to the heart
Diffence none / might be devised
And Vlixes / with her look supprysed
Began her behold / always more and more
And in his sleep / for to syghe sore
Persynge aye / with full besy pain
Her to enbrace / in his arms twain
But aye the more / that he began pursewe
She agaynewarde / began him to eschew
And aye the more / he presed her to se
Aye the more / from him she began to flee
So contrayre / to him was Fortune
And when she saw / he was importune
She axed him / shortly what he would
And he to her / the platte truth told
Certys quod he / my lives Emperesse
Where that ye be / woman or goddess
I can not deem / nor judge half a right
I am so derked / and blinded in my sight
But I dare well afferme / in this place
My life my death / stand hoolly in your grace
More of mercy requerynge / than of right
To rewe on me / which am your own knight
And of pity / and of compassyon
Goodly to se / to my sauacyon
For my desire / but I may fulfylle
This same night / to have of you my will
To my recure / I can no remedy
For lack of rouche / but I must dye
Now have I all / atwyxe hope and dread
My self declared / to your womanhede
And after that / she kept her close a while
And full sadly / began on him to smyle
And as it is / put in remembrance
Said unto him / with sobre countenance
Sothly quod she / thine affection
Would fully / turn to confusyon
Of us both / it is so peryllous
So inly mortal / and contagyous
That utterly / there gain may no read
But one of us / must an one be deed
This is the fine / of the hateful chance
That should follow / after our plesaunce
And as vlixes / began to nyghe nere
Beholdynge aye / on her heavenly chere
Where as she stood / vpryght on the ground
He saw her hold / a spear long and round
The head thereof / all of borned stele
Forged new / and ground wonder well
And thereupon / in his a vysyowne
He saw a baner / blasynge up and down
The field thereof / all of color ynde
Full of fysshes / beten as I find
And in some books / like as it is told
In the mids / a large crown of gold
And or that she / turn began her face
Lykely anon / to part out of the place
She spoke to him / and said in words plain
This full token / of partynge of us twain
For evermore / nouther for sour nor sweet
After this day / never again to mete
And disaperynge / anon her leave she took
And after that / he sodaynely a woke
And began to muse / in his fantalye
What thing this dreme / might sygnefye
But where it mente / outher evil or good
The secretnesse / he not understood
For it surmounted / sothly his reason
Therefore he sent / thorugh his regyon
For such as were / sotell exposytours
Of fate or sort / or crafty dyuynours
For all the clerks / soget to his crown
To assemble in one / his sweuen to expowne
And when they knew / by informacyon
The manner hole / of his a vysyon
They concluded / according into one
The time approaches / and shall come anon
That one / that is next / of his kynrede
With a spear / should make him blede
Let se / where he / his fate can remewe
Sith it is hard / destynero eschew
As say tho folk / in their oppynyon
That work and trust / on constellacyon.
And vlixes / musing on this tale
Changes color / and began wexe pale
Wonder dredefull / and full of fantasyes
Began in him self / seek remedies
To void away / thing that will not be
He stareth broad / but he may not se
His in ward look / was with a cloud shent
But wenynge he / for to be prudent
Made call / his sone Thelamon
And to be take / and shet up in prison
He supposing / fully in his wit
For all myschefe / thereby to go quyte
He not aduerteth / nor ne took none head
To the sharpness / of the speres head
Nor to the fysshes / in the baner beete
Nor of the sea / where they swymme and flete
Nor of the queen / that called is Circes
That signs brought / of werre and not of pees
Nor of the crown / token of dignytee
Of one / that shall hold his royal see
Myd the wawes / both fell and wode
Among the fysshes / in the large flode
And he shall make / the dyuysyon
Tofore remembered / in the auysyon
Again his will / of very ignorance
And execute the fatal puruyaunce
Up of the dreme / with his spear of stele
Which vlixes / consydreth never adele
Nor to no wight / has suspecyon
But to his sone / called Thelamon
That is closed / and shet up in a toure
And vlixes / with cost and great labor
Fro day to day / does his business
For him self / to make a forteresse
Bylte on a rock / of lyme and square stones
Deep dyched about / for the nones
That no man may / enter on no side
Where he casts / all his life to abide
(...) certain men / chosen in special
Night and day / to watch upon the wall
That no wight should / have none entree
But it so fall / that he be secree
Known of old / and to counsel sworn
NOw as the storye / rehearsed has to forne
The old fool / this dotarde vlixes
A sone had / begoten on Cyrces
Fresshe and lusty / young and coragyous
And he was called / Thelagonyus
Borne in the sea among the floddes rage
That was also / for to reken his age
five and twenty year / or there about
But of his Fader / he was aye in doubt
What man he was / or who it might be
Being thereof / in no seurte
Till on a day / he desirous to know
In his Mother / fill on knees low
Besechynge her / goodly and not spare
Of his Fader / the truth to declare
What he was or where he should dwell
He besought that she would tell
But sothly she / long and many days
Of prudence put him in delays
Till that she saw / she might have no rest
So importune / he was in his request
And wha^ she knew / there was none other bote
Fro point to point / she told crop and rote
Of vlixes and where that he was king
And he anon / made no lettynge
But took leave / it may none other be
And said plainly / he would his Fader se
Whereof the queen / began in heart cold
But when she said / she might hy^ not wtholde
She him besought / with chere debonayre
That he would soon / again repair
And forth he sayleth / onwarde on his way
Without abode the self same day
By many port / and many fer country
Till he was brought / there he would be
To Achaya / a land of great renown
And he began search / thorugh the regyon
After the place / and paleys pryncypall
Where as the king / held his see royal
And he so long / in the country rode
Till he was taught / where the king abode
There vlixes / was shytte up in mewe
To which place / in haste he began pursewe
A great party / releuyd of his sorrow
And on a monday / erely by the morrow
Unto the bridge / the right way he took
And found a porter / deynous of his look
And lowely first / he began him to pray
That he would / goodly him conueye
Into the court / and make no tariynge
For a message / he had to the king
But proudely / he denied him the gate
And shortly said / that he came to late
To enter there / in any manner wise
And ungoodly / began him to despise
Froward of speech / and malycyous
But in all haste / Thelagonyus
As he that was / in heart not aferde
The proud porter / hente by the berde
And with his fyste / rofe his chawe bone
That he fill deed / Muet as a stone
And other eke / that him tho withstode
He made proudely / lepe into ye flode
And when mo came / to make resystence
He hente a sword / by manly vyolence
And furyously / in his Irous tene
The storye says / he slew of them fyftene
Him self almost / wounded to the death
And began for weary / sothly fail breath
And vlixes / what for noise and sown
To the bridge / is descendyd down
Finding his men / at enter of the gate
Deed and slain / by full mortal hate
And he full Irous / hente anon a darte
Of adventure / stondynge tho a part
And cruelly cast / at Thelagon
But the stroke / as in conclucyon
Damageth not / for it glode aside
And he for haste / no longer would abide.
Hent up the darte / without more a rest
And smote the king / low under the breast
Thorugh the rybbes / shortly for to seye
Of the wound / that he must deye
Having tho / none oppynyon
That he was king / nor suspecyon
Nor that he had / his own Fader slawe
Which fast began / to his end draw
His wound was / so deedly and so kene
That he might / him self not sustene
But pale and wan / to the ground began glyde
His men about / upon every side
That besy were / to help him and releue
But his sore / began so ache and grieve
That he well felt / that he must be deed
But abraydynge / as he lift up his head
Having as yet / mind and good reason
Remember began / of his auysyon
And how it was / told him out of dread
That one / that was next of his kynrede
Descendyd down / from his own line
His sweuene shall / parfourme to the fine
Accomplysshe it / with a darte of stele
And for he could / not conceive well
What that he was / nor who it should be
He badde anon / unto his meyne
Without harm / or any vyolence
Fette anon / unto his presence
The young man / which at the gate stood
That has that day / shad so much blood
And when he was / before vlixes brought
Of him he has enqueryd / out and sought
First of his kyn / and next of his country
Certes quod he / I was borne in the sea
Among fysshes / myd the wawes grene
And said also / his Mother was a queen
Called Circes / of whom the name is kouthe
Both Est and west / and right fer by southe
And told also / his Fader was a king
That him begat / at his home coming
Fro Troy town / toward his country
And as my Mother / Cyrces / told me
Secretly / that he vlixes hyghte
Of whom desirous / for to have a syghte
I entered am / this mighty regyon
And have pursewed / unto this dongeon
Oonly in hope / my Fader to have seyne
But I se well / my labor is in vein
And sithe in sothe / lost is my travail
And that it may / in no side avail
It were folly longer / here to dwell
Lo: here is all / that I can you tell
Of my kynred / axe me no more
With that vlixes / began to syghe sore
For lack of blood / as he that was full pale
And said anon / when he herd his tale
Now wot I well / my woeful destyne
Fulfilled is / it may none other be
Now wot I well / that it is to late
To grutche or strive / again my pyteous fate
For my sone / as clerks whylom told
Has made an end / of my days old
Thereon expectant / with pains full grievous
And with that word / Thelagonyus
When he wyste / again natures law
That he alas / had his Fader slawe
Which in that land / long bare his crown
Without abode / he fylle anon a swowne
His clothes rent / his yelowe here to torn
Alas quod he / that ever was I borne
For cursed is / my woeful destyne
And my Fortune / which I may not fle
Cursed my sort / cursed mine adventure
And I refuse / of every creature
Forwaryed eke / my disposycyon
And cursed is / my constellacyon
Cursed also / and infortunat
The hour / in which / my Fader me begat
So would god / without longer read
To aquyte him / anon that I were deed
To lay my life / for his death to borowe
And when the king / saw his great sorrow
And wyste he was his sone / of Cyrces borne
By many signs / rehearsed here toforne
He unto him / anon forgave his death
As he might / for lack and want of breath
So importable / was his passion
And his sone / called Thelagon
Which has in prison / so many day be shet
To his presence / in all haste was fet
Which when he saw / his fader in such point
Upon his death / stondynge in disioynt
And knew also / and the troth has found
By whom he had / his last deedly wound
A sword he hente / and mortally Irous
And would have run / on Thelagonyus
Of hye despyte / avenged for to be
But vlixes / of Faderly pity
Made his men / hold him and restrain
And amyd / of all his grievous pain
By his prudence / and that was done anon
He made his sons / for to be all one
And gave in charge / unto Thelamon
Of enteernesse / and affection
And of hole heart / feigned never adele
All his life / to love his brother well
To part with him / treasour gold and good
As to the next / borne of all his blood
And tho in sothe / was no longer tarried
That vlixes / royally was carried
Of Achaya / to the chief Cite
And after that / lived days three
Without more / and tho gave up the ghost
I can not say plainly to what cost
After this life / that his soul is gone
But in atoumbe / of metal and of stone
The body was / closed and yshet
And after that / made was no let
That Thelamon / with great solempnytee
Y^crowned was / in his Fadres see
Sword and scepter / delyueryd to his hand
Of Achaya / a full worthy land
Right habundaunt / of treasour and of good
And Thelagon / with him there abode
A year complet / well cherysshed in his sight
And of his brother / took the order of knight
And for him list / no longer there abide
The king for him / wisely began provide
That he with gold / great treasour and plente
Repeyred is home / to his country
And his mother / of age wexe sad
Of his repeyre / passyngly was glad
As she that saw / by her Sorcerye
He scapyd was / many Iupardye
Many pereyll / and many great distress^
And after that / she fylle into sykenesse
And her debt / yield unto nature
Which escape / may no creature
In all this would / that is here living
After whose death / her sone was made king
Of Anlydos / the meruayllous country
As I have told / enclosed with a see
Among rocks / where many ships drown
And syxty year / there he bare his crown
This manly man / Thelagonyus
And his brother / Thelamonyus
Reigned also / in his regyon
Seventy winter / as made is mencyon
And after that / they made a royal end
And both two / to Iubyter they wend
To reygne there / among the sterres bright
But now the lantern / and the clear light
Is wasted out / of Frygyus Darete
Whylom of Troy / writer and Poyete
Guide have I none / ferther for to pass
For even here / in this self place
He fychched has / the bounds of his style
At the sege / he present all the while
And aye in one / with them did abide
Dytes the Greek / on the the other side
And both two / as in their writing
Ne vary not / but in a little thing
Touching / matere as in special
That is notable / or hystoryall
I do no force / of incydentis small
Of which in sothe / it is but little tale
Save this Dytes / makes mencyowne
Of the nombre slain / at the town
Lasting the sege / affermynge out of dread
Eight hundred thousa^de / and syx were there deed
On Greeks side / up right in the field
And as Dares / also there beheld
On Troy party / in the werre kene
Six hundred thousand / seventy and syxtene
Were slain there / in Guydo ye may se
With them that came / to help the Cite
Fro many cost / and many regyowne
In diffence / and reskus of the town
And full ten year / so as I can cast
And six months / the mighty sege last
Or it was get / Dares write him self
And over more / complet days twelve
Or Greeks had / full possessyon
By false engyne / of the Greek Synon
Like as tofore / rehersyd was but late
I have no more / of latin to translate
After Dytes / Dares / nor Guydo
And me to add / any more thereto
Than mine Auctours / specefye and seyn^
The occupacyon / sothly were in vein
Like a manner / of presumpcyon
And time complet / of this translacyon
By just reckoning / and a countis clear
Was a thousand / and four hundred year
And twenty nere / I know it out of dread
After that criste / received our manhede
Of her that was / Emperesse and queen
Of heaven and hell / and a maid clean
The eyghte year / by computacyon
Suynge after / the Coronacyon
Of him that is most / gracyous in werkynge
Herry the fyfthe / the noble worthy king
And protectoure / of Brutys Albyowne
And called is / thorugh his hyerenowne
Thorugh his prowess / and his Chyualrye
Also fer / as passes cloud or sky
Of Normadye / the mighty conqueror
For thorugh his knyghthod / and dilygent labor
Maugre all tho / that list him to withseyne
He has conqueryd / his heritage again
And by his mighty / prudent governance
Recuryd eke / true title of France
That who so list / look and unfold
The pee de Grew / of Chronicles old
And sercheth books / ywryt long aforne
He shall find / that he is justly borne
To reygne in France / by lyneall descent
And onwarde now / he is made regent
Of thylke land / during his Faders life
Of his goodness / to void werre and strife
He to rejoice / without more delay
Scepter and crown / after the kings day
As it is clearly / in conclusyon
Enrolled up / in the conuencyon:
And than I hope / the time Fortunat
Of the old world / called Aureat
Resort shall / by influence of grace
That cruel Mars / shall no more manace
With his looks / furyous and wode
By false Aspectes / for to shede blood
Atwene the folks / of these Realms twain
Which every wight / ought to complain
But as I trust / in mine oppynyon
This worthy king / of wisdom and reason
And of knyghthode / shall so do his pain
To make one / that long has be twain
I mean thus / that England and France
May be all one / without varyaunce
Out of hertes / old rancour to enchace
By influence / of his mighty grace
That called is / of clerks douteles
The soueraygne / lord and the prince of pees
And I hope / his grace shall now reygne
To set rest / atwene these Realms twain
For in his power / sothly stondeth all
And allyaunce / of the blood royal
That is knet up / by bond of marriage
Of werre shall void / away the rage
To make peace / with bright bemes shine
And one that is called / Katheryne
And named is / right good and fair also
Shall Be mean / atwyxe both two
Of grace emprynted / in her womanhede
That to complain / we shall have no need
And I hope / her gracyous aryuaylle
Into this land / shall so much auaylle
That joy honor / and prosperyte
Without trouble / of all aduersyte
Repeyre shall / and all hertely plesaunce
Plente welfare / and fulsome habundaunce
Peace and quyete / both nyghe and far
Without strife / debate or any werre
Myschefe pouert / need or indigence
With full cessynge / of death and pestylence
Sothly all this / I hope ye shall seen
Come into land / with this noble queen
That we shall say / of heart and feyne naught
Blessed be she / that all this has us brought
And he y^ has / thorugh might of his werky^g
Of his knyghthode / concludyd all this thing
And such meruayles / i^ arms done and wrought
And his purpose / fully about brought
Of hye wisdom / set in his inward sight
Reioysynge all / that longs to his right
And highest sit / of worthynesse in glory
With the Scepter / of conquest and victory
I pray god / oonly for his best
When he has all / set in peace and rest
And is full put / in clear possessyon
Of all that longs / to his subieccyon
To send him home / with as great honor
As ever yet had / any conqueror
Long after / in joy and in quyete
For to reygne / in his royal sete
Thus shall I aye / there is no more to say
Day and night / for his expleyt I pray
Of faithful heart / and of hole intent
That whylom / gave me in commandment
Not yore ago / in his faders time
The sege of Troy / on my manner to ryme
Most for his sake / to speak in special
All though that I / be boystous and rural
He gave me charge / this storye to translate
Rude of conning / called John^ Lydgate
^onke of Burye / by professyon
Using / an habyte / of perfeccyon
Albe my life / accord not thereto
I feyne not / I wot well it is so
It needs not / witness for to call
Record I take / of my brethren all
That will not fail / at so great a need
And all that shall / this noble storye read
I beseech of supporte / and of grace
Where I offend / in any manner place
Or where so ever / that they find error
Of gentyllesse / to show his favor
Benyngnely / for to do their pain
To correct / rather / than disdain
For well wot I / much thing is wrong
Falsely metryd / both of short and long
And if they should / have of all disdain
It is no dread / my labor were in vain
Let ignorance / and rudeness me excuse
For if that ye / platly all refuse
For certain Fautes / which ye shall find
I doubt not / my thank is set behind
For in metrynge / though / there be ignorance
Yet in the storye / ye find may plesaunce
Touching substance / of y^ mine Auctour wryt
And though so be / that any word mysse sit
Amend it / with chere debonayre
For an Error / to hyndre and appayre
That is not said / of purpose nor malice
It is no worship / to him that is wise
And no wight gladly / so soon demeth a lack
Specially / behind at the back
As he in soth / that can no skylle at all
He gothe full hole / that never had fall
And I not find / of new nor of old
For to deem / there is none so bold
As he that is yblent / with uncunning
For blind bayarde / cast pereyll of no thing
Till he stumble / mids of the lake
And none so ready / for to undertake
Than he in sothe / nor bolder to say werse
That can no skylle / on prose nor on verse
Of all such / that can not be stylle
Little forse / where they say good or ylle
For unto them / my book is not dyrect
But to such / as have in effect
On simple folk / full compassyon
That goodly can / by correccyon
Amend a thing / that hyndre never adele
Of custom aye / ready to say well.
FOr he that was ground / of well saying
In all his life / hyndred no making
My master Chaucer / y^ found full many spot
Him list not pynche / nor grutche at every blot
Nor meue him self / to parturbe his rest
I have herd told / but said always the best
Suffrynge goodly / of his gentyllesse
Full many thing / embraced with rudeness
And if I shall / shortly him descryue
Was never / none / to this day alive
To reken all / both young and old
That worthy was / his ynkehorne for to hold
And in this land / if there any be
In borugh or town / vyllage or Cite
That conning has / his tracys for to sewe
Where he go broad / or be shet in mewe
To him / I make a dyreccyon
Of this book / to have inspeccyon
Besechynge them / with their prudent look
To race and scrape / thorugh out all my bok^
Void and add / where them seems need
And though so be / that they not ne read
In all this book / no rethorykes new
y^et I hope / they shall find true
The storye plain / clefly in substance
And who so list / to se varyaunce
Of worldly thing / wrought by days old
In this book / he may full well behold
Change of Fortune / in her course mutable
Selde or not / faithful outher stable
Lords / Princes / sfrom her royalte
Sodaynely brought / in aduersyte
And kings eke / plounged in pouerte
And for dread / darynge in deserte
Unware slaunghtre / compassed of enuy^
Murdre execute / by conspyracye
Awayt leyinge / falshede and treason
And of kingdom / sudden euersyon
Bauysshynge of women / for delight
Rote of the werre / and mortal despyte
False mayntenaunce / of auoutrye
Many worthy / causynge for to dye
Sin aye concludynge / who so takes head
Vengaunce unware / for his fynall mede.
VO declare / that in all worldly lust
Who look a right / is but little trust
As in this book / exaumple ye shall find
If that ye list / enprente it in your mind
How all passes / and halt there no soiour
Wasting away / as does a somer flower
Rich and pore / of every manner age
For our life here / is but a pilgrimage
Meynt with labor / and with much woo
That if men would / take heed thereto
And tofore / prudently aduerte
Little joy / they should have in their heart
To set their trust / in any worldly thing
For there is nouther Prince / lord / nor king
By example of Troy / like as ye may se
That in this life / may have full seurte
Therefore to him / that starfe upon the rode
Suffrynge death / for our aller good
Lift up your hertes / and think on him among
For be ye never / so mighty / nor so strong
Without him / all may not avail
For he can give / victory in battle
And hold a field / shortly to conclude
With a few / again great multitude
And by grace / he makes princes strong
And worthy kings / for to reygne long
And Tyrants / sodaynely oppress
Thorwe the^ down / for all their great richesse
And in his hand / power he reserueth
Each to aquyte / like as he disserueth
To whom I pray / with devotion
With all mine heart / and hole affection
That he list grant / long contynaunce
Prosperyte / and good perseueraunce
Health welfare / victory / and honor
Unto that noble / mighty conqueroure
Herry the fyfther / tofore yspecefyed
So that his name / may be magnefyed
Herein this life / up to the sterrys clear
And afterward / above the nynthe spear
When he is deed / for to have a place
This pray I god / for to send him grace
At whose bidding / as I told late
First I began / the sege to translate
And now I have / hoolly in his honor
Executed the fine / of my labor
Unto all that / shall this storye se
With humble heart / and all humylyte
This little book / lowely I betake
It to supporte / and thus an end I make.
Laus deo.
Of the most noble excellent Prince king Henry the fyfthe.
Most worthy / Prince of knyghthode soures and well
Whose hye renown / thorugh the world does shine
And all other / in manhood do excelle
Egall of meryt / to the worthys nine
And borne also / by descent of line
As rightful heir / by title to attain
To bear y^ crown / of worthy Realm twain
And also fer / as Phoebus in his spear
From Eest to west / shedyth his bemys bright
And Lucyna / with ashrouded chere
Gothe compass round / with her pale light
Thou art yrekened / for the best knight
To be registered / worthy as of name
In the highest place / of the house of fame
To hold a palm / of knyghthod in thy hand
For worthynesse / and for hye victory
As thou that art drade / on see and land
And evermore / with laud honor and glory
For just conquest / to be put in memory
With a crown / made of laurer grene
Upon thy heed / tofore that famous queen
Whylom ordained / oonly for conquerours
Stable of heart / with long perseueraunce
And gave not up / till they were victours
Empryses take / for no sudden chance
Whose name / ay floureth with new remembrance
And fades not / of years yore agone
Among which / thou may be set for one
For thorugh the world / in many regyon
Reported is / with fame that flies wide
That naturelly / thy condycyon
On thing begone / is knyghtly to abide
And for the time / manly set aside
Rest and ease / what cost thereon be spente
Till thou have cheued / the fine of thyn entente
Most circumspect / and passing auysee
All thy works / conveyed with prudence
Sad and demure / like to Iosuee
Again whose sword / is no resystence
And have also / heavenly influence
With Salamon / wisely to discern
Oonly by grace / thy people to govern
Mercy eke meynt / with thy magnyfycence
On all oppressed / for to have pity
And of rebels / by manly vyolence
Abate canste / the great cruelte
And so with Dauyd / thou haste kyngly pyt^
And hye prowess / with Sesar Iulyus
In his time / most victoryous
And manly hold / in thy hondes two
Who can behold / by clear inspeccyon
The sword of knyghthode / thy Scepture also
The tone to bring / to subieccyon
Hertes made proud / by false rebellyon
And with the Scepter / to rewle at the best
Thy true people / that can live in rest
Now thou y^ haste / manhood / virtue and grace
Attemperaunce / fredome and bounte
Lowly I pray / with dredefull face
Disdain not / benyngely to se
Upon this book / rudely made by me
To fine oonly / to agrene thine highness
And rewe of mercy / upon my symplesse
And in thy noble / kyngly aduertence
Consydre and se / my soueraygne lord most dear
Of thine inuat / famous sapyence
That criste Ihesu / received with good chere
The twey Munytys / you of heart entere
By the wydowe / which of will and of thought
Gave all her good / and kept her self right naught
By which ensaumple / so that it not offend
Thorugh mine uncunning / to thy hye noblesse
Let good will / my little gift amend
And of thy mercy / and renowned goodness
Have no disdain / of my bareyne rudeness
And in making / though I have no muse
Let true menynge / the surplus all excuse
More than good heart / has no manner wight
To present / nouther to god nor man
And for my part / to the as it is right
That give I hole / as ferforth as I can
Aye to persevere / fro time that I began
With will and thought / for thine estate to pray
Which to conserve / thus finally I say
First of all / almighty god to queme
With all that may / be to his plesaunce
And to thy crown / and thy dyademe
Grace and good Eure / with long contynuaunce
Of thy lyeges / faithful obeyssaunce
And each virtue / that man may specefye
I pray god / grant unto thy regalye.

But humbly / with draw and go a back
Requerynge them / all y^ is amysse to amend.
