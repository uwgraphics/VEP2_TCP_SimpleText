The Deploratioun of the Cruel murder of James Earl of Murray, vmquhile Regent
of Scotland, togidder with ane admonitioun to the Hammiltounis committaris
thairof, and to all their Fortifearis, mantenaris, or assistance, with ane
Exhortatioun to the Lordis and Nobility, keiparis and defendaris of our Kingis
Grace Majesty.
QUhile as with flesche, and blude we go about,
The wondrous warkis of God for to discriue,
Dans quhil we pleis, we sal not find yame out
Bot sall Judge God, aganis all ressoun strive.
Quhen as be tholis, proud Delours to deprive
The lyuis from sic, as halely was his,
Be Cruel murder, them reuthles for to riue
The flesche of man can never considder this.
Bot quha that wald the matter understand,
He man luke lawer, and enter in the Spreit,
And than he sall persaif, the cause fra hand,
That God wirkis na thing, bot as a Judge discreit.
Quhen as the pepill with sinnis ar repleit
Without remors, as they ar, at their houris
Than to that end, his plaiges be may compleit,
He takis from them their godly Gouernouris.
And this he vsis money sindrie sortis,
Sum time be seiknes, in to their beddis to be,
Sum slane be tratouris, bot not for their consortis,
Bot to that end, they should distroyit be.
And rutit forth clean out of memory,
He tholis sic wickit, proud Conspiratouris,
To execute their lurking traytorie,
And bring to deith their godly Gouernouris.
We se also the wickit of the world, 1. To. 3.

Still beir the godly at deidly Indignatioun,
Sum time be tratouris, ar Innocentis ouerharld,
And thocht true men, haif heir bot tribulatioun.
We should not haif sic thingis in admiratioun,
As gif it were, ane new thing chansit to man,
For sa it was, euin from the first Creatioun,
And still hes been, sen that this world began.
This mortal seid, this haitrent and Inuie,
Did first begin, as Gods awin buke dois tell,
As in the Genesis we may plainly spy, Genesis 4.

Betuix two brether, Cain and Abell.
Cain aganis his brother did Rebel,
And susseit not, to sched his saikles blude
And for this cause, I pray ow mark it well,
His warkis war evil, and faithful Abells good.
And of their two, this haill world did descend,
Quhilk never can, amangis them selfis aggrie,
Bot both their ofspringis may be cleirly kend,
Cursed Cains Clan, be their Impiety.
And Abells seid for richt and equity,
And thus all murtherars at discendit down
Of Cursed Cain, and his posterity,
As is the Tyrane, and Tratour Hammiltoun.
For luke how Justice was the verray cause,
To cursed Cain, his brother for to kill,
Sa is it it, but dout, the only clause,
That moves the wickit, unto their Raging still.
They gloir na thing, bot ever in to Ill,
And makis tha^^ ever, but mercy to malign,
And quhen they may, their wickit wayis fulfill,
They will not thole, ane godly man to Rigne.
The Probatioun heirof.
TO preis this part, I plainly mycht propone,
Exemplis seir, may Notabill and true,
Bot for them all, I will bot use heir one,
Of our deir Master, and Savior Christ Iesew.
In quhome na spot of sin, it never grew,
it nocht theles, the bischoppis mycht not bide him,
Quhill on a Croce, on lenth and breid him drew,
And hangit up for spyte, two theuis beside him.
For to make mentionn of the Marterdome
Of Gods Prophets, it were sum thing to lang,
And for to reckin the reuthles rage of Rome,
Quhair sindrie godly, they dulefullie down dang.
It were prolixt, thairfoir I let their gang,
And to my purpois but process mair proceid,
How wickit men delyris ay in to wrag,
And may not suffer to haif ane godly heid.
Sen sa it was, that Christ both God and man,
With his Apostillis, and Propheits gat na rest,
Bot ever hatit be Cain, and his clan,
As Gods true word dois make it manifest.
We should not grude, howbeit we be oppressed,
As was our Master, and brethrene us beforne,
Bot be assurit it will cum for the best,
And better to them that they had never been borne.
I mean not heir, that they should pas vnpunissit,
For their trespass, nor never sit thing thocht,
For than should Justice and Law be clean diminissit
Gif they war spairit, this wickit wark hes wrocht.
That our good gyde to bailfull beir hes brocht,
Let us assemble thairfoir with curage stout,
And lat they tratouris, out throw this land be socht,
And never leif them till they be rutit out.
Ane admonitioun to all the Hammiltou^is and their assistaris, counsallaris,
and pertakeris of this may vile and abhominabill Murder.
O Teinfull tratouris, quhy did e him deuoir?
May schamefullie, that puneist every vice,
Quha was the chief mantenar of Gods gloir,
In to this Realm, and lufit all Justice.
our bailfull blude can never pay the price
Of his deir deith, wrocht be our wickitnes.
Wa worth ow Uillanis, that slew that Prince may wise,
For na cause ellis, bot for his rythteousnes.
For sen e first in to this Realm began,
e were ay callit for our tyranny
Strypis of the Schyre, the may unworthy clan
That ever was bred, or seen in this country.
As schawis weill be our Genalogie,
For thift and murder, reif and oppressiounis,
With Guldis and Rukis, blasnit equally
Is the auld arms of the Hammiltounis.
And quha wald seik, ane man but conscience.
Ane Renegat for to deny his Creid,
To tak ane pure man under his credence
Syne cut his throt, and tongue out of his heid.
To put ane hundredth for to beg their breid,
And bring Just men unto confusioun
To do ane horrible, and ane unworthy deid,
Seik never farther than ane Hammiltoun.
Ane midding tuilour, but manheid at assay.
Ane vaileand tyrane, ane febill Campioun,
Ane wife with Child, that manfully can slay,
Ane noysum nychtbour, proud in oppressioun.
Ane teinfull tratour of rycht Successioun,
To Crucify Christ, that compts not a feg,
I say to ow for schort conclusioun,
Come never ane good bird of the Deuillis eg.
How horribly e spuileit under nycht
In his awin house, may schamefull for till heir,
Ane Nobill Lord, James of Torphicen knycht,
He can declair, gif any man list speir.
e left him not ane Male nor Deneir,
Syne under trust, neir schot him, and his wife,
And Tymothie was in ane felloun seir,
Bot praisit be God, they chaipit with their life.
Our Kingis Grandschir, at Lythquo field e slew,
Baneist his gudschir, from his kind heritage,
His Fatheris murder also e cleirly knew,
Mischantly hangit, ane wickit vassalage.
Their ar our warkis, euin from our first karnage,
God wait gif e be Iasps to hald in stoir,
Or bony byrdis to keip in to ane Cage,
Christ keip our King out of our handis heirfoir.
e flew our Rege^t, because his warks were good,
Quha was the Lamp of lycht in to this land,
As houngrie tykis, e thristit for his blude,
That sauit ow, quhen e were in his hand. Nu. 35.

Quhen e culd not resist his forcie wand, Gal. 5.

Ane suithfast sentence, heirfoir I sall ow tell Ioa. 3.

Pronouncit be God, I lat ow understand, Genesis 9.

All murtherars they sall Inherit hell. Apo. 22.

Ane admonitioun to the assistaris, counsallaris, by lyaris, and Reioysaris in
this may detestabill murder.
NOcht only they, bot all that sic assistis,
Or fortefeis, or any wayis mantenis,
Incurris his Curie, now luke Gods buke quha listis
For it is not man's Judgment sa that deims,
And quha that this soir sentence small esteims,
The time sall cum, that he sall weip and murne,
Quhen hiddeous hell with grievous glowa^d gleims,
Both body and saul for ever mair sall burn.
Moirouer all they of that Genalogie,
And of that Surname, we make them Intimatioun,
They salbe repute of this foul crime gyltie
Quha nocht compeiris to make Purgatioun.
Farther all they, geuis consultatioun,
Or them assistis in to this fylthie fact
And not compeiris to our Conuentioun,
They salbe haldin pertakeris of this act.
Be war heirfoir, and be effrayit of this,
Lat sic tryit tratouris defend their awin cursed cause,
Tyne not our landis, and als the heuinis blis,
Bot be obeysant to God, and man's Lawis,
And be not flatterit with their vain wordis and sawis
For they can not of this foul fact be clengit,
Thocht man wald wink, it God yat all thing knawis
He will not leif this vile wark vnreuengit.
The exhortatioun to the Lordis and Nobility persewaris of this cruel
Murder, and defendaris of our King.
GOd sayis my Lords, he will be aduersair, Psalm. 5.

To bludy boucheris, that stand of him na feir,
My Lords, their wordis should curage ow far mair
Nor the haill help of man both far and neir.
Fall to heirfoir with blyith and mirrie cheir,
We are anew, thairfoir heis up our hartis,
And fordwarts march* sa sall we se and heir
Quhat luckand lubers will tak their Lymmers parts
They fylde the feilds befoir, quhe^ first yai fauchs
Quhair tha for ane, were aye in number three,
We trowit from thence, they should haif sittin saucht,
And should haif tyrit of all their tyranny.
Bot now allace, the contrare we may se,
Our vain piety, hes maid us this false train,
Gods Curse thairfoir lycht on them all for me,
That ever hes piety or reuth on them again.
Gif e do nocht Revenge this fylthie fact
e will be schamit, e may weill understand.
And will be namit, ane falls and febill pack
That ever rang in any Realm or land.
With curage heirfoir, now be the baner stand,
And wyn for ever honor and Renoun,
Do e not this, e ar ane bailfull band
And seruis nocht else, bot Goddis malesoun.
For Gods Curse, his vengance and malediction.
Sall never from ow, nor fra our seid depart,
e sall sustene may sorrowful afflictioun,
That ever tholde men, in any land or airt.
Sic hauie harm sall happin to our heart
Gif this foul murder with silence be over past,
Their same tratouris sall make our selfis to smart
And salbe our distructioun at the last.
And gif sa hapnis, e may rycht weill considder
This plaigue may Justly, of Gods hands e craif,
Far better it is thairfoir to rise togidder
For to revenge the Murder with the laif.
Nor Gods soir wraith abone our heidis to haif,
For the ouerseing of sic a fythie crime
For Gods plaigues approchis I persaif,
Gif e prolong schort quhyle and drift over time.
Fall to them fraklie, to fecht they haif na faces,
Persew them peirtly, and e sall se them fle,
Rune is their glass, and gone now is their graces,
In to respect of this foul tratorie.
And quha supportis them, or dois fortify,
I hope to God that is the heid of hallous,
To se them hyntit in handis haistelie,
Syne hangit hie, but grace upon the Gallous.
The makaris Exhortatoun to all men in General.
AMend our lives, and call on God for grace,
Pray for our King, with hearty Exhortatioun,
Repent our sinnis, quhill we haif time and space
Detest all vice, and foul adhominatioun.
Than God sall gif us confort and consolatioun,
Pray for the Nobill Queen of Ingland
Quha in our neid still sendis us supportatioun,
Her grace lang space, may in good weilfair stand.
So be it.
Imprentit at Edinburgh be Robert Lekpreuik. Anno Do. 1570.
