WHich 70 pound 8. shillings 6. pence, together with 30. pound added thereunto
by an unknown person, for the furtherance of the said free School, was paid
unto the Right honorable Henry Earl of Southhampton, for the honorable
Company of Virginia, at their great and general Quarter Court, held the 21. of
Nouem. 1621. And the said Court, for the better maintenance of the said
School, Schoolmaster, and Usher intended there to be placed, granted 1000.
acres of land to the said free School, to be at Charles City, as the most
commodious place for health, security, profit, and conueniency: And appointed
that with the said 100. pound 8. shillings 6. pence, there should be sent over
presently an Usher, for the instructing of the children there, in the
principles of Religion, ciuility of life, and humane learning: as also that
five persons (besides an ouerseer of them) should be forthwith sent in the
condition of Apprentices, to manure and cultiuate some part of the said land,
for the use and benefit of the said Usher, till God stirred up the hearts of
others to be further helpefull to the said School.

Likewise the said honorable Virginia Court thought fit in honor of the said
East India Benefactors, the said free School should be built, and the said
1000. acres set out in Charles City, to be called The East India School: And
that the East India Companies servants, should have precedence before any
other, to prefer their children thither, to be brought up in the rudiments of
learning.

They thought fit also, that this (as a Collegiat or free School) should have
dependence on Henrico College in Virginia, which should be made capable to
receive Scholars from the School, into such Schollerships and Fellowships as
the said College shall be endowed withal, for the advancement of Scholars,
as they shall rise by degrees and desert in learning.

There was since by a person refusing to be named, sent into the great and
general Quarter Court held for Virginia, the 30. of January 1^21. 25. pound
tovvard the furtherance of this godly work: So that now there is in all 125.
pound 8. shillings 6. pence.

They that be wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they
that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the Stars for ever and ever,
Dan. 12. 3. For public actions of virtue, besides that they are presently
comfortable to the doers, are also exemplary to others; and as they are more
beneficial to others, so are they crowned in us: our principal care should
be, that while our souls live in glory in heaven, our good actions may live
upon earth, and that they may be put into the bank and multiply, while our
bodies lie in the grave and putrify.

Whosoever shall receive such a little child in my name, receives me, Mat. 18.
