(...) (...)d^r, etc.
A man of honest parentage,
traind up to husbandry,
But weary of that honest life,
to London he did hye:
Where to his dismal woeful Fate,
He chose a Queen for his copesmate.
O murder, etc.
One Canbery Besse in Turnball-street,
on him did cast an eye,
And prayed him to give her some drink,
as he was passing by:
O too too soon he gave consent,
And for the same does now repent.
O murder, etc.
For by alluring tempting bates,
she sotted so his mind,
That unto any villainy,
fierce Sherwood was inclind,
His coin all spent he must have more,
For to content his filthy (Whore)
O murder, etc.
Much mischief then by them was done
in and about the City,
But still they escape unpunished,
(not known) more was the pity,
To deadly sins they then did fall,
Not only rob but murder all,
O murder, lust and murder,
is the foul sink of sin.
The first was Master William Lo,
a Gentleman of note,
And cruel Sherwood laid him low
with an inhumane stroke:
Nor birth nor blood they did regaid,
Yet death for blood is their reward.
O murder, etc.
One Master Holt of Winsor tower,
a Norwich Factor he,
Walking abroad to take the air,
felt next their buchery,
For Sherwood with a fatal blow,
This goodman killed, his queen will so,
O murder, etc.
His cloak, hat, ruff, from him they ook
eleven groats also,
And were about his clothes to stripe,
his shirt, shoes, hose thereto,
But being scard, away they fly,
he has confessed this villainy.
O murder, etc.
A vile loose life they still run on,
regarding not their end,
Their hearts still bent to cruelty,
not minding to amend:
They cannot sae Satan the devil,
That drags them unto all this evil,
O murder, lust and murder,
is the foul sink of sin.
The second part To the same tune.


FOr being flusht with humane blood,
they thirsted still for more,
The more from God O man thou runst
the greater is thy score:
Like ravening wolves they pry and watch,
How they the innocent may catch.
O murder, lust and murder,
is the foul sink of sin.
The last that fell into their hands,
was Master Claxton he,
A Gentleman of good descent,
and well beloved truly,
Who walked unarmed by break of day,
In holborne fields they did him slay.
O murder, etc.
A scarlet coat from him they took,
new suit from top to toe,
His boots, hat, shirt they took from him
much money eke also,
And left him in the fields so wide
So fled away and not discride.
O murder, etc,
But mark the goodness of the Lord,
on the succaeding day,
That Sherwood with his trull did think
beyond sea take their way,
In Hounsdich were together taken,
Selling the coat in the same lane.
O murder, etc.
With the new suit upon his back,
and all things else befide,
The queen the hat of Master Holt,
which they had murdered,
So unto Newgate were they sent,
Confessed all this, and do repent.
O murder, etc.
Wishing all men when as they walk
to have a special care,
And not to go unarmed, or late,
but sword or truncheon wear,
Had they done so Sherwood does say,
He had not ventred them to slay.
O murder. etc.
Within thrae quarters of a year,
these murders they have done,
And maimed and spoiled many a one,
by their confession:
Such deadly blows he did them give,
It Was strange that after they should live
O murder, etc.
For these bad facts he now does dye,
just judgment for his maede,
All such ill livers grant they may,
no worse nor better spaed,
So shall England from crying sin,
Be ever fraed, Gods mercy win.
For murder lust and murder,
is the foul sink of sin.
