An Admonition given by one of the D. of Sauoyes Counsel, to his Highness:
tending to dissuade him from enterprising against France.
MY Lord, Since I am borne your subject, and that nature and reason do bind me
to serve and obey you: also that next unto the service of God, I am to frame
and direct whatsoever my actions and thoughts to the preservation of your
estate, the greatness and prosperity thereof, and the peace and benefit of
all that are likewise borne under your obedience: I can not in this late entry
into the war which your highness do begin, but bring for my part such
service and ability as I may, as well to avoid idleness whilst other are
busied, as to show some proof of my fidelity, and to bear witness of those
benefits and commodities which all your subjects, as also my self, have
hitherto received and made trial of under your government. Some one will
bring in his weapons and valiancie: some other will contribute his coin and
commodities: some other his art and industry: and all generally, whatsoever
may advance and set forward your enterprise. But I, contrary to the rest, do
come with a most humble admonition, containing the most apparent reasons which
on a sudden I could imagine, to withstand and contrary them, so far as in
me lies, and peradventure as a new Cassandra, in few words to set before
you, the importance and weight of that matter wherein you now ship your
self: as being steadfastly persuaded, that by diswading you, I shall do more
then all your captains and army, whether for your highness particularly,
either for the benefit and quiet of your poor subjects, who stand amazed at
the motion, mistrust the continuance, but especially do doubt and fear some
great mishappe and calamity in the end: and indeed I might well think my
self perjured and a traitor to that service which I owe to your highness, in
case I should not also contribute, and purposing to do well, I should not, at
the least, stay the mischief and annoiance, to my power. Your highness,
whether of your own motion to extend your limittes, and by the right of good
situation and commodity to appropriate unto your self sundry countries,
holds and towns, so to purchase reputation, and after the example of your
predecessors to atchieue notable and immortal memory: either else by the
persuasion and inducement of others, have seized and gotten possession of
Rauell, Carmagnolle, and generally the whole Marquisate of Saluces: also of
Brianson and some other fortresses in Daulphine: and now with the like full
wind, do thither lead a great and mighty army, in hope to multiply your
conquests and annexe this province of Daulphine (which for the greatness and
importance thereof have long since been dedicated to the eldest son of the
house of France) to your territories of Piedmont and Sauoy. You find all
things requisite for the intertainment of this army, as you would wish: the
hearts of your soldiers and men of war well disposed: your treasury and
storehouses well furnished: France so divided, turmoiled and fleshed in and
against it self, that in your own judgment, you have no cause to fear, and,
which is more, sundry of the greatest and most mighty with weapon in hand do
call and favor you: assurance also of all help and succor from the Catholic
majesty and our holy father, whose authority, power, weapons and means, are
terrible to the whole world: with great appearance and conjectures you foresee
a dissipation and partition of the state and crown of France, and that every
man will carry away his morsel: and you presuppose that you have as good
right as the rest, as being son and husband to Princesses of the blood of
France and house of Valois: finally moved and led by a holy and religious
intent, you purpose to prevent the ruin and subversion of the holy, Catholic
and Apostolic Religion in this province, which is half banished and cannot
long subsist without speedy remedy. Thus do you find your purpose to be
both honest and easy: The success hitherto does also put you in great hope
of as happy an end: and that at the least by the law of shipwreck and
waste, so much as may lie nearest your coast must belong to you. These indeed
are great and mighty motions, sufficient to encourage the most fearful, to
stir up the least ambicious and to move even the slowest and most duetifull:
sith such facility is found to concur with honor and commodity: as also
it is the cause of worldly matters and the natural order of generation that
springs of corruption: and in such cases especially the taking hold of fit
occasion is it that woorketh the fairest and most permanent effects. Yea, I
will grant that the Gangrene having seized upon the midst of this great
body (as it has) the members and outward parts may well be cut off for
the preservation of the rest: But yet, if your Highness will consider and
weigh such reasons, difficulties, and empeachments as are therein, I am assured
you shall find them to be of far greater importance then all that have yet
been propounded.

First, it is but too certain that all changes from a long peace into a sudden
and great war are most dangerous, the rather because the peaceable person is
less trained to war* less accustomed to suffer and bear, and less fit to
endure any tedious enterprise: and this if it be true in states that are in
strength and power equal, which through a certain mutual fear do maintain
and uphold themselves, much rather then among unequal Lordshippes, of whom
the lesser most look to keep and maintain themselves, rather then to
enterprise against or assail the greater. This is the very law of nature
imprinted even in all creatures, among whom the small do yield to the great,
and are to account it a favor and courtesy that they be not bruised and even
swalowed up. Now therefore what proportion is there between your highness
power and the power of France: which is twenty or thirty times greater then
all that you possess: peopled and abounding accordingly: trained and exercised
in wars these thirty years continually? Have not we (without seeking any
further) an example, even of late, of the loss of all the lands that you
possess, as well on this side, as beyond the Alps: also of the extremity
whereto your late father of happy memory was for a long time brought, only
in having too mighty an enemy of the Frenchman? Do not the sound of the
wars of Piemont, which the passage of the power and troops through this
country still ring in our ears? Is there any thing more easy or commodious
for the French man, then to bound and limit the confines of his realm even
with the Alps: and as it were by the way to tame end subdue us? If therefore
the example of your parents ruin and overthrow should restrain you, much more
the quiet enjoying of his estate after he has recovered it, wherein himself
inuiolably remained, ought to instruct and divert you from so rash an
enterprise. He had purchased (and that justly) the fame to be one of the wisest
and most stayed princes of Europe, but especially for that among so many his
neighbors troubles and wars, he had abstained from war and kept his
countries in peace: and yet had great experience in warlike affairs: wanted no
intelligences, or partakers in France, and saw it in as great divisions and
flame of wars, as now it is in: and as for wealth he has left you so much
as may suffice to furnish the entertainment of a very great army: as wisely
foreseeing the incertaine end of wars, which for the most part are sweet at
the beginning, but difficult in the prosecution, and most bitter and hurtful
in the end. Yea, and the same advice and counsel did he give the French king
now reigning, when at his return out of Polelande he passed through his
Country: and for want of following it, his affairs have had so badde
success. This is and ought to be unto you a pattern and rule of conduct for
your estate, which by this means he has assured and left unto you,
flourishing and full of all wealth and commodity: his instructions and
domestical precepts, proceeding of so great and tried a judgment, ought with
you to prevail above all other either gracious or flattering counsels. Yea,
he never attempted any thing against the Switzers, who in power are nothing
equal with France, but contrariwise, choose rather to leave and abandon unto
them part of the lands that they had usurped upon him, then to attempt the
events of war against that so warlike a nation. Have not our selves, and that
of late years, seen what happened to the king and kingdom of Portugal,
which had so long flourished in a happy peace, and even in a moment is
perished and extinct through rash enterprising to assail a mightier then him
self upon a vain show and hope, which nevertheless seemed to be very well
grounded, yea even upon piety and religion.

All histories are ^ull of like examples, neither need I any further to delate
the reasons: for in the end, if the lesser will war upon the greater, he must
do it only by practices and drifts, by corruption and rewards, and by a
politic discretion which the wisest did always practice: that is, still to
nourish the wars and divisions, if there be any: and still to feed the fire,
not to quench it, that they may have neither leisure nor power to think upon
any other then them selves and for them selves. The Catholic Majesty has
above all things very well observed and practiced this remedy, yea and that
so happily, that France, which heretofore upon less occasion and pretense
would have invaded and set foot in his lands, has now refused them when they
were offered: as finding it self brought to that pass, that it was time to
employ all endeavors to quench the fire of civil wars which were kindled
every where. True it is that England, which is as mighty in respect of
Spain, as you in respect of France, has in part returned it to him, and for
these twenty years and more, have very cunningly entertained and nourished
the wars in the low countries, and thereby has warranted it self from a
threatened invasion and ruin. What else then do you in departing from these
domestical and fresh examples, other then the contrary? You weak, do
assail one strong: you in peace and assured in your State, do hazard it to the
peril of an uncertain war: you that hold your estate of France, stand
greatly bound unto her, and of late of mere courtesy have received Sauiglian
and Pignerothes, through so great an offense as is the assailing and seizing
upon her towns and territories, do incur so notable a blemish of
ingratitude, which can not be cloaked under whatsoever pretense: If injuries
and offenses be aggrauated and accounted of according to the unworthiness of
the offender, together with the quality and quantity of the offense. If wrong
done to an afflicted person, be accounted greater then that which is done to
one in prosperity: If the misdemeanors of parents toward parents, of friends
toward friends, of servants toward their masters, of children toward their
parents, and of subjects toward their Lords, have evermore been accounted
execrable, and they punished as paricides. With what reason or color may your
enterprise be manteined, since you can not allege any necessity, or offense
before given? But contrariewise that you leauy war against him that had
gotten all your country, and has given it you again: that has bound you by
oath, and has kept it with you: whose vassal through some of your Lordships
you are, and unto whom, as unto the mightiest, without comparison, you owe all
duty and fear. There is (said a certain ancient) no war just, but that
which is necessary: but you seek this of a iolitie, and that not without some
spot of impiety and ingratitude, whether against God, who is the God of
hosts, since against your own conscience and religion, you assault a most
Catholic king: whether against your honor and commodity: either else against
the peace and calamity of your poor subjects, who can not expect any other
then the miserable ruin and loss of all their goods: for (to be brief) do
you think, that a king of France will put up such an injury, at a Duke of
Sauoyes hand? Either if he would, that so many princes of his blood, so many
great Lords and officers of his crown: so many brave and courageous Captains:
so warlike nobility: so many towns and so much people, in whose hearts and
affections the Flower de Luce has taken root so many worlds ago, will brook
such an invasion, and will not speedely be revenged, and with a miserable
spoil, force and confine you into your Piedmont, and so we in these parts
remain a pray to the conquerors? What profit shall you then reap of all your
conquests, except according to the proverb, in fishing for some small fish, to
lose a golden hook of far greater value. What may you else have done but
quenched that fire which you should have kindled, united those whom you should
have set at debate, strengthened the members of a most mighty body, in the
weakening whereof it had been your profit to have employed all your industry:
In sum, ceased their wars and divisions, the continuation whereof is your
good and preservation. It is too common a proverb, yet to some purpose: That
dogs do often fight together, yet so soon as they spy the woolfe, they
leave their brawles, and together run against the common enemy: so likewise
brethren and kinsmen otherwise at strife and divided, upon the touching of the
honor of their family and house, laying aside all rancor and enimitie, or at
the least, deferring it, do defend them selves, in and against all: and
natural affection surmounteth that which is but accidental: the general
interest reclaimeth and forces them to forget the particular. Against you, the
consideration of your smalnesse, and the greatness of the injury, being done
in so woeful a time, which always will be imputed to a brag, insolency, and
rashness, will the more provoke all France, and breed in them a speedy union
and league: and the wisest will be very glad of such an occasion to end their
divisions and partialities, as, surely there is no better way or certainer
remedy against civil wars, then to set upon the enemies subjects. We read
that the Romans being on a time at jar, the enemy came into the town and
took the Capitol, but they suddenly agreed to drive him away: The like did
they against the Veients, and the princes and people of Thuscane, who during
their civil wars had assailed them, and in lieu of getting any thing from
them, remained vanquished and brought into subjection. The like did the Spanish
nations when they so far revolted against the Emperor Charles the fifth, as
to force the D. of Calaber to take the crown: for being in arms one against
another, king Frances the first sent an army and recovered the realm of
Navarre and Fontarabie: but the Spanish troubles being suddenly appeased, with
one common consent thy fell upon the French, and drive them out of all the land
that they had conquered, and never after thought upon their factions and
reuolts: and we see ordinarily that in towns and communalties the enuies,
enmities and ielousies of particular persons are trod under foot so soon as
the enemy does appear, and all, even they which before would have slain
each other, do with one mind run to defend the breach.

Let us not then deceive our selves in too much flattering and rejoicing in our
forces and commodities, neither let us persuade our selves that the Frenchmens
divisions are so rooted and graven in them, that they cannot be soon taken
away and appeased. The long continuance of their mischiefs, the extremities of
the peoples miseries, the experience of that which is past, the small effect of
their civil wars these 25, or 30. years, and especially these last troubles,
longer and more pernicious the^ the rest, which do as it were undermine the
very foundations of this Monarchy and estate, together with the object of an
enemy, will provoke them to unity and agreement. It is well known that in
the estates now assembled, most of the provinces do require peace, that there
be a great number of Catholic Lords that do bewail the miseries of the
estate, and with great impaciencie do bear these ambitious commotions and
proud innouations.

Would you think that men do judge it to be the Catholic Majesty, under
whose aduow, and with whose help you enterprise this war, and that without
such assurance you would not meddle. The Spaniard then, the hereditarie enemy
of France, is he that assaileth it: he it is that seeks to swallow up the
whole world under his Empire, and to become the sole and only Monarch thereof:
he it is whose mortal hatred is naturally graven in every true French heart,
whose dominion is accounted cruel and intolerable, against whom the
inhabitants of the low countries are revolted, choosing rather to venture upon
so many extremities, then again to fall under his dominion: and now to this
Spanish Cornet shall not the French ears be open, their hairs stand upright,
their hands be armed, neither the hearts of so many princes, Lords, gentlemen,
and others, both warlike and courageous, be puffed up with a desire of revenge,
and the just defense of their fellow citizens? or will they incur so great a
blemish of infamy and cowardlinesse, as to suffer themselves to be wronged
and provoked by so weak and impatient an enemy as you? To be brief and
without dissimulation, would the Catholic Majesty forsake and abandon the
recovery of his countries to the end to denou^ce a new war unto France? He
who with all his power and strength has not been able in twenty years to
reduce two small provinces, Holland and Zealand into his obedience, and of late
has incurred so great and notable a loss of noble Spanish Lords, captains,
and vessels, yea even of his reputation in that great overthrow and dissipation
of his navy, in the preparation whereof he had employed all his power for the
conquest of England, will now enterprise against France which has so often
withstood him, and whose armies to his loss he has so often felt and tried?
Again, who is ignorant of the great practices and intelligences of the king of
Portugal, whose estate has forciblie and by violence been detained by the
Spaniard, who has far more interest in the preservation of his conquests,
and greater cause to prevent the loss and reuolts thereof, then to dream else
where? This consideration therefore must not amaze them, but they may be
assured that he will still employ his forces and means upon his first
purposes, which are more necessary and honorable for him, besides that, it is
well known that ordinarily he is crazed, and as it were in a manner at his
end: which if it should happen, his estates could not eschew great
dissension, sedition and reuoltes, the sparks whereof do already appear in
Spain and else where, and then will it peradventure be too late for you to
repent your over rash counsels.

But admit you were assured of his succor and help, yet do you not both see
and hear the clashing of your neighbors the Switzers arms, who fear nothing
so much as your prosperity, and alone are sufficient to withstand you: who
already begin to stir: who do inuit and counsel the French to whom
they are bound and confederate, to withstand your purposes, and to force you to
restore and yield up that which you have usurped: you have of late years
provoked them, and yet through their discretion and usual forbearance, they
have been desirous by treaties and capitulations to bring you to peace, and to
withdraw your forces, rather then to enter into a dangerous war: they know
your means and pretenses, also that to this day they detain the Bailiwikes
from you: and that your prosperity or power is their ruin and hinderance: and
therefore you may be sure, that for their honor and reputation, whereof they
are wonderful jealous, together with their duty to France, they will
withstand your purposes, and being well united together, will part among the^
this miserable country, wherein your self have no want of such subjects, both
great and small, as bearing you but holow hearts, would gladly shake of the yoke
of your obedience, so to obtain liberty, and to free themselves from such
taxes and impositions you as have laid upon them. True it is that the Switzers
are at jar among them selves, also that you may have many partakers, but the
protestant Cantons are still the strongest, and will speedely lend all aid and
succors to the Huguenotes of Daulphine their neighbors, with whom they have
of long time had ordinary familiarity.

In the mean time, we shall see whether the tongues and pens of the wiser
sort at Geneua, whose interest herein is greatest, will be quiet: yea and in
France, where there is abundance of brave and good wits, whether they will not
both in words and writing stir up every true French heart against you and
your ingratitudes, which they will exagerate, so that if heretofore thousands
of Lords and gentlemen took upon them the cross for the conquering of such
far countries from the Sarazens, will they now suffer you to invade their
own realm? Either will not this house of Bourbon, which after the kings
discease that now reigns, is called to the crown: which also evermore have
brought forth such warlike and valiant princes, take heart and advice how to
maintain and preserve that which justly is their due? To be brief, shall this
noble blood of France be as it were blemished and tainted with such
cowardlinesse and want of courage, as to suffer that Province of France which
has the particular prerogative and privilege still to be dedicated to the
eldest son of the crown and nearest heir thereof, be lost and usurped by a
stranger? will they not in such a case be touched with jealousy, and
particularly with just sorrow, which may provoke and move them to preserve
their own, since at this day the crown returns to them: I speak generally,
leaving all questions of law, and election of persons, and cleave only to the
Salicque fondamentall law, inuiolably observed by the French, who above all
nations have evermore been highly commended and renowned for their most
faithful obedience and love to their kings and the princes of their blood.

Together with the Switzers, the State of Venice, and the Duke of Mantua, who
above all other do fear the mightiness of the Spaniard and you, and are most
desirous of the reestablishment and preservation of the State of France, will
not fail to admonish the French king of the consequence and importance of your
enterprises, and, if need be, to contribute and enter confederacy for the
hindering and breaking of them off.

Thus of all your pretenses and apparent inductions there remains no more but
your intelligences and partakers, which you may have in France, together with
the Catholic Apostolic, and Romish Religion, to the upholding whereof, you
take all faithful Princes and Christians to be called and bound: How then? Who
is more inclined, more bent, or more earnestly given thereto, then the French
king now reigning, who under the reign of his brother Charles, employed all
his youth therein, and has tried all ways and forces, secretly and openly,
and all clemency, for the rooting out of the contrary religion, and even now
for the same end holds his estates? who also is so desirous to compass it,
that he has forgotten all particular friendship and hatred, and is purposed
and resolved upon no other thing, to the end afterward most happily to end his
days. This notwithstanding, he is still king, he is endued with great gifts
of the mind, and zealous of his honor: and as all other men, he is capable
of just sorrow when he is provoked and offended: will he then suffer his
memory to be taxed in all posterity and spotted with such ignominy, as to
suffer the Duke of Sauoy to bereave him of the Marquisate of Saluces, and
therein to ravish and take from him all tokens, relics and monuments of the
kings his predecessors conquests in the realm of Naples and province of
Italy? To seize upon Carmagnolles the Arsenoll of France? Now even during his
life to take an oath of fidelity of his subjects, and to cause himself to be
acknowledged as Lord, dispatching all things in his own name? And afterward
by force of arms to enter his Realm, and to put garrison into his towns.

In those extremities which undoubtedly do oppress him, he will hasten
against him that dismembreth, his estate, and as already he has sundry times
experimented, he will grant peace to his subjects, rather then in his days see
his garments rent in sunder. So in the time of king Charles, in the year 1562.
the troubles ceased almost as soon as the English set foot in France, and had
gotten New haven: and his subjects agreed together to fall upon the common
enemy. True it is, that his princes, nobility, towns and communalties are
now at greater division, and more fleshed each against other then they were
then: that now there is more in their power and possession which help you, and
together with you do purpose the sharing of this realm. That these Lords your
partakers are as it were masters of the state, and have the strength and
Metropolitan town of the realm in their hands: That it is impossible to
reunite the hearts that are thus alienated, and to regenerate and reduce into
the hearts of the princes of the blood and mighty Catholic Lords, princes,
gentlemen and subjects of the contrary part, which are many, a confidence and
love of their king, and therefore the fire which still shall, be kindled in the
heart of the realm, will greatly let them from being able to succor the
outward bounds. But what? The king, who by force and at the inducement of his
Lords, once made an edict of reunion with them, whereby they be bound to
abandon all leagues and associations either within or without the realm, being
(as he is) duly advertised of your intelligences with them, of the portion
that they grant you of Province and D'aulphine, so as you also bind your self
to expel those of the contrary religion, and afterward to help them with
your power and means, to make them likewise masters of their parts and
portions. The king, I say, who besides infinite others has received two
injuries and displeasures: this, the most shamefullest that ever Prince
received: namely, to be expelled out of his seat, the Parliament and
principal town of his realm, and afterward to be so far iniuried as to be
driven to thrust from about him his most ancient and most faithful servant
and officers of the Crown, to the end him self to be served and possessed
by them, not that he chose but that were prescribed and presented unto him:
shall he not both justly and honestly go from any oath or word that he
may have promised unto them without breach of faith and promise? Shall not the
Princes of the blood, the officers of the Crown, the Parliaments, Nobility
and Towns, the most whereof do see and know the evident inconveniences and
domages of the continuation of the wars, admonish him to stay no longer in
this so strange bondage, but to rid and free himself from this tyranny of
these masters of the Palace: to whose passions and ambitions he is utterly
subject. To be brief, shall not the States, which represent the soundest part
of the Realm, and are assembled together to prevent the calamities and ruins
which threaten it, seeing so great a mischief to happen during their
assembly, conclude upon a mutual confederacy against the authors thereof
and all foreign enemies? Either shall not the king together with them call to
mind their original advancement, and progression, together with the bonds
wherein they are bound to France, which in the mean time they now rent in
sunder and dismember? These children be they not worse then their fathers, who
with the like tyrannous ambition possessed and brideled king Frances the
second, and under his name and authority, did enterprise to put to death the
chief princes of the blood of France, and fathers to the princes now living,
albeit neither acknowledged, neither maintained in their degrees and dignities
unto them due? Be not these they who through their sleights, have always
mainteyned the wars of France, and had intelligence with the king of Spain,
the sworn enemy of France, and of late received his coin, sought to deliver
Marseilles and diverse places into his hands: solicited the Prince of Parma with
his Spanish power to enter into France, and to make war upon their king,
that has so raised and exalted them, that now they go about to abase
himself, whom they have forced contrary to all law both of God and man, and
contrary to all order in France, to name a successor: at this day do
forciblie detain diverse great Towns and Castles, yea even the principal
City of the Realm, and use all those reasons whereof your discovery shall
furnish a very large camp? Shall not the king and princes awake out of their
slumber and sleep, to the end to see and judge what is prepared for them? I
can not deny but there be paricides in Realms and Empires: also that the
woeful and heavy destiny do seem to thrust and hale France to her end:
Nevertheless, were they no more but the king of Nauarres faction that
withstoode you in Daulphine or else where, I say and aduowe that they are more
then enowe to thrust you back into Piedmont, and to make you return with
shame and loss. These thirty years well near have the French kings employed
all their power and strength, which were without comparison greater then at
this day, and better united, against them: yet see we them still shoot up
again and increase more then ever, namely since the last commotions in France,
they have taken more towns, woonne more battles, fortified more holds, and
more strengthened their party then before: you are therefore to consider
particularly against which part of them you bend your self: viz. to those
that are strong in towns, and multitude of warlike gentry, if there be any
throughout the world, yea, and furnished with captains of more experience:
that is, those that took Montlimart, Ambrune, Die, Cap, and sundry other:
that defeated the army of the Lord of Vins, and another at Montlimar, that
inhabit a country by nature strong, of access difficult, for ambushes and
stratagemes, wherein they are most excellent, very convenient: and that at need
shall be succored by their neighbors of Languedoc. Repose not therefore so
much trust in the promises and power of your partakers, who with a good will,
will help themselves with your means, men, and money, to establish their power
and authority, whose behauiours do already make them odious and misliked of
the most part of France, which sigheth and groneth under the calamities that
are sprung out of their ambition. The king now reigning is no elder then they,
whose speedy end we are neither to fear, neither to hope for: if it should
happen also, that all good French Catholics should fear to fall into the
obedience of a prince of contrary religion, yet the continuance of the
calamities and mischiefs that undermine them: the long proof and tedious
experience of the inabilitie of force and violence to force the minds to
believe other then they would: the examples of the Germains and Switzers, which
notwithstanding the plurality of religions do live peaceably enough: and the
assurance that they have of the clemency and mildness of the king of Navarre,
who is he that chale^geth to be presumptiue heir and eldest of the crown,
will still draw them to acknowledge him, and to yield unto him the duties of
faithful and obedient subjects, rather then to stoop to the dominion of these
new and foreign princes. They know the king of Navarre to be gentle and
merciful, naturally not to be ambitious or a tyrant: they are not ignorant how
often he has desired and requested to be instructed by a free counsel: that
he is a prince of his faith and word, and that by force and constraint he was
driven and compelled to take weapon, which he now has in hand, whose equity
has appeared in the happy success that God has given him against the armies
of the Duke of Maine, the Marshall of Biron, and the Duke of Ioieuse, who
thought to have devoured and swallowed him up, yet has he still had the
victory. If then with these virtues and perfections far different from the
cruelties and tragical passions of his enemies, he get the crown, what are
you to hope or fear of so warlike a Prince? So sore bent against the Catholic
Majesty, which detaineth his kingdom, and so well beloved among your
neighbors the Switzers? Consider therefore earnestly that the shortest follies
are the best: that then your partakers shall be but small warrant unto you,
since they no whit subsist of their own forces, but of other men's only, and
that with so extreme violence as it cannot continue: for in the end what
foundation have they of their power, other then of a broken reed: of the
mutable minds of inconstant people, which forsake him whom before they favored
so soon as they see his good hap abandon him, yea, and that do not only
forsake him, but for the most part drive away, punish, or most shamefully
murder him. Such there have bin both in Athens and Rome, and being this day
exalted to the heavens, have been to morrow banished and cast down headlong. And
alredie it is very likely that the Parisians will shortly shake off that yoke
which a while they thought so sweet, because they see themselves deprived of
the presence of their king, which bred their great commodity and profit, upon
the ceasing whereof will also cease their amity and good will that they bare
to the procurers of the ceassing of their profit and traficke. The same people
(and justly) do fear the indignation of their king whom they have offended,
and who is justly wroth against them: as also they may judge that he
dissembleth his wrath for a season, and that for this present he is content
with this punishment, viz. That he will not come at Paris. Even this only
reason already breeds a repentance in the Parisians hearts, and a hatred of
the authors, who have offended and provoked against themselves a number of the
principal, the richest, and the best alied inhabitants. How will it be when
the king shall so manifestly reveal his hatred, that he shall take from them
part of the extent of their Parliament (as is already forecast) of the chamber
of accounts of aides and other jurisdictions which are the cause that Paris is
maintained in such resort and greatness? How will it be when openly he shall
bend himself against them, and take from them (as he may) so many priueledges
which by the kings his predecessors have been granted them, and by himself
confirmed? How will it be, when they shall peradventure see themselves brought
into like estate, as at this day are Gaunt, Lisbourne, Diieon, and many other
towns heretofore most flourishing? Shall they not then remember that it is
because of their rebellions? Shall they not call to mind that the authors of
the miseries of France, are also the authors of the miseries of Paris, and of
all the country round about which is utterly undone, ruinated and wasted
already? Already they taste and know that the civil wars have debarred
them of half their traficke, haunt and concourse of people, and most of them
do curse the authors. Other towns by them detained, which also do prove the
like miseries, yea, and far greater, which are subdued by Citadels and great
garrisons, will after the example of Paris, seek after alteration of
governors and their former liberty.

If at this day the king show them any favor, yet is it a question whether it
be but in appearance, or in truth, considering what offenses and injuries they
have wrought him* so that, albeit for a while he dissemble, yet he will find a
time when to punish them, even so soon as he shall see time and opportunity:
and then shall you be destitute of all such support as you hoped of, for the
defense of your wrongful enterprise: But admit they obtain that favor in
deed and without dissimulation, yet can you be assured that it will continue?
Men are in all things variable, and especially in amities, and among men, the
greatest are so when they perceive that his greatness whom they favor may be
hurtful and prejudicial to their own estate: for there is nothing so subject
to jealousy as dominion: For that do men forsake all divinity and humanity:
and government can brook no companion.

Again, the manifest division among them ought to stay, yea utterly to break
off your enterprise, since it is but over likely that their particular quarrels
will sufficiently debar them from helping of others: further that within
these three years they have used and laid all their endeavors, and have
sought, yet could not attain to invade the Duke of Bouillons sovereign
territories, whereof they be at this day in extreme anguish. Their behavior
do sufficiently show it. Hardly could they find one general to undertake
the conduct of their army into Poytou: They are extremely indebted, urged and
tormented by their creditors: They owe more then they are worth, and that is
the cause that they hazard, not their own, but France: They have procured the
king of Navarre to be moved to accord, which if they could obtain, they would
think themselves reasonably safe: and when their enterprises shall be (as it
is very likely) brought to naught, themselves shall withal fall even
groueling to the ground. Here you see the pillars and bulwarks of your
enterprise. Contrariwise, the king of Navarre is grounded upon a match made
long since of great patrimoniall goods: of the law of France, which calls
him before all others to the crown, and especially of an incredible love of
his subjects, and all other his followers, which is the fairest and mightiest
fortress that princes may have, and which makes their memory most famous and
happy with the posterity: He is, I say, like unto a second Traian even among
the Catholics, beloved, no less for his goodness and clemency, then for his
valiancie.

Thus in my opinion I have sufficiently answered concerning the pretense of
Religion which they might make you take hold of, which also bears more
semblance then truth, how much wiselier have your late father and your self
dealt in forbearing forciblie, and by constraint to reclaim your poor
inhabitants of the valley of Angrongne and other their neighbors, who
nevertheless are but one handful of people in respect of these of Daulphine
whom you do assail. Content your self therefore with the same estate wherein
hitherto your self, and before you your late father found ease. For under what
color would you at this day, in a foreign land, fight against a Religion
which these thirty years have been tolerated in your own Countries. Rather
be you a beholder of the storm that beats and tormenteth the sea of France:
expect the issue of that tragedy: either, if you be so desirous to purchase
reputation, convert your means and forces toward your father in law the king
of Spain, for the recovery of the low Countries: and, resembling the
physician, which coming to the end of the sickness, is usually the
happiest, and carries away the credit of the cure, since the Duke of Alua, the
great commander, and the prince of Parma could not yet atchieue the victory,
get you the honor of finishing it: so doing you shall travail in a better
title, and your weapons shall be more honorably and better employed, besides
that you shall not incur the vice and reputation of ingratitude to your
benefactors: you shall warrant your poor subjects from the affliction and
oppression that wars do usually bring. And if zeal of Religion does lead
and so mightily move you, you may there fight against contrary Religions
which have been long there, and are in diverse points different from yours.
There shall you find the English, against whom the Catholic Majesty is at
open war, who durst favor and undertake the protection of the Hollanders and
Zealanders, who first offering themselves to the French king (who was more
religious and careful in keeping his league and peace with Spain) were
refused. For my part I will pray unto the Creator for the prosperity and
increase of your highness, as

Your most humble and most obedient subject and servant.
