TO THE MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY OF HENRIETTA MARIA, Queen of Great Britain.
THE ancient and modern custom which all Authors have, and do yet hold, in
dedicating their works to the hand of eminency and greatness, is grounded
eitheir upon desire to see them powerfully protected, or by them to proclaim
some testimony of devoted affection, or to appear grateful for benefits
received, if I shall call to this support of my thrice humble dedication to
your Highness, the aforesaid motives either several or joined together, I
doubt not but their weight will beg pardon for my presumption, and incline
your Grace to its favor, since whether I make my address in the humble
supplication of the first, or in a revering sense of the second: or lastly, in
the general obligation of the third respect. I profess no more then what the
least and meanest in the rank of subjects is owing to the source of Majesty,
whose influence quickens, gives motion and being to all civil industries,
sending their lives to equal center.

In point of subject, since nothing from mine own conceptions was fit to
adventure upon so high a theater. I assign my part to the only choice and
conveyance of an Author, with language intelligible to the English shore, who
in the variety and multitude of his writings, both Theological, moral, and
historical, has as with a Cristall stream watered a continent of the
greatest extent in Europe: and although in himself like good wine he needs
no bush to recommend him to the readers gust, yet in this presentment to your
gracious Majesty. I will serve him in by the hand of a curious taster. Rare
Ca^ssin, who in a noble translation of the Holy Court, toward the end of the
second part, has these words, as well of proper gratitude to his person, as of
a full Elogie of the graces and beauties of his mind.

I may well say (says he) that I were stupid and ungrateful, if I shonld not
confess to have been much excited to prosecute this labor by the honorable
invitations which my Lord Bishop of Belley has used toward me in his works, I
cannot set too high a price upon his recommendation in such a subject, for he
is verily one of the most able and flourishing wits that ever handled pen: to
see the number of his Books, one might say, he began to write, so soon as to
live, and to consider their worth, it is a wonder how so many graces and
beauties which others attain not but with much labor, increased in him, as in
a soil natural for eloquence.

This Character flowing from so learned a pen, may of it self be a fair
invitation to your Highness, to peruse the work which I have here drawn up to
a translation: it is an extract of several Histories culled out of two
Treatises entitled Singular Events, and Moral Relations, an argument not
improper for a virtuous mind, whether profit or pleasure be aimed at, for
Histories are the storehouses, where virtues are faithfully conserved to
posterities veneration, and vices detestation: it is an armory where armor of
proof for all degrees is fitted to the hand; it is a glass wherein to behold,
adorn, and fashion out the life to what is worthy imitation, and to have in
hortour and avoydance what is deformed in the beginning, or foul in the end:
in fine, they are the only monuments of truth, which they purely deliver, no
way flattering or concealing any thing

Give leave then, most gracious Princess, where I began, there to determine my
thrice humble Dedication, with homage and binding oblation of these first
fruits of my small industry to your all-atracting goodness, which let it
deigne to assume unto favorable acceptance, herein imitating the precious
amber, that commands the ascent of small, and worthless substances, not for
their merits sake, but for the honor of its force, and virtue to attract. Thus
my presumption I hope, may be excused, your Highness all commanding virtue
being graciously inclined

To the humblest and lowest of all your Majesty's most devoted servants, S. Du
VER^ER.

The Authors Epistle to the READER.
THe enterprise which I have taken in hand, is to wrestle, or rather to
encounter with thosefrivolous books, which may all be comprised under the name
of Romants, which would require the hands which fables attribute unto Briarius,
or the strength which Poets give unto Hercules: the hands of that Giant to
handle so many pens, and the vigor of that Heroes to undergo so painful a
labor: but what cannot a courage do, animated by a zeal of pleasuring his
neighbor, and provoked by desire to advance the light of virtue, and to lessen
vice. O why has not my pen the virtue to cure the wounds that these wicked
books cause in this world! or at least, why cannot it devour those monsters,
which the writers of those aforesaid works, mere inchanters of minds cause
to appear in the forms of books? or like as an Eagles feather devours all
other feathers, so might my pen devour all those other pens. When shall the
light of virtue, and verity dissipate the shadows of vice and vanity? will the
false Dagons never fall before the Arc of serious, true, and beneficial
entertainments of the mind? at least if these my labors could cure those who
are miserably infected with often viewing these Pamphlets: If the loss of so
much time may be called employment, I should not think my labor spent in
vain, nor my pen unprofitable. But when I see this mischievous tree, which I
strive to cut down, casting forth so many branches, as I lop off, and doing
like the Vine, which never sprouts so well, as when it is cut, it makes me
fear a labor like unto that of Danaides, or of Sisyphus. Who would not wish
for as many hands as Briarius, for to oppose so many styles, which are used in
that so vain, and so wanton a kind of writing? And who would not wish for the
arm of Hercules, to overcome this Hydra, whereof I can no sooner strike off
one head, but up springs another? You would think the fable of Cadmus a truth
in this subject; and that of the ancient Serpents teeth, there grows up armed
men to fight in defense of lies: that if Hercules (according to the proverb)
could do nothing against two, what may we think to do against these legions?

Now to overthrow so many fabulous Books, I undertake not my combat directly,
as if I were confuting heresies, for it is not needful that I should trouble
my self to prove the obscurity of darkness, nor to show the falsehood of these
Romants, Adventures, Chivalries, and other such trash, which confess
themselves fabulous in their Prefaces, and whose reading full of fantastical
conceits of faynings, of impossibilities, of absurdities, of enchantments, of
extravagancies, and such like trumpery, sufficiently shows their
impertinency, which were (as the Apostle says) to combat against the air, and
to tun without end, or at the most to imitate that idle Emperor, who made
war only against flies By what manner do I then labor to overcome my
adversaries? it is by diversion, setting relations true and beneficial, in the
place of those that are profane, fabulous, and not only unprofitable, but for
the most part pernicious, to the end that those whose great leisure causes to
seek wherewith to employ their time, may find wherewithal to entertain
their desires.

Even as truth is constant, so falsehood is wavering and differing, and is
capable of more different forms, then the materia prima, or the Proteus of
Poets, which is the cause that these Authors, who love vanity, and follow after
lies, set forth their works in as many fashions, as they please. This variety
being no small attractive unto those that passionately affect such kind of
reading: and it is no small advantage, that fantastical relations have over
those that are true, for those are made at pleasure, like leaden rules, or
images of wax wherewith you may do what you will, filling them with monstrous
incounters, surmounting both probability and imagination, things which delight
and wonderfully suspend the mind: in brief, they stuff them with so many
baits, that the licourishnesse of the sauce makes them loose the taste of the
meat, which of it self is without savor or relish, and most commonly
hurtful: whereas narrations of things, which have truly happened, are tied to
more subjection, for although a man may order them handsomely, and slip in some
convenient dressings, nevertheless conscience obliges to keep faithfully to
the ground and body of the History: and yet in the particularities which are
added, either for connection, or imbellishment of the recital: the Author is
strictly tied to the bounds of probability, out of which he may not swerve a
nails beadth, without discrediting the whole work. For although fables,
parables, and poetical fictions, do sometimes hide in them good precepts, and
many serious examples, yet the instructions loose much of their credit when
they are mixed amongst vain inventions: and when they do not lean to the
solid foundation of truth, even as the Manna of Calabria loses much of its
virtue, when it is gathered of flowers which grow in places that are too moist.

Now amongst the multitude of these writings, which like unto Reeds, have
nothing but a pleasing verdure, and a fair show of stately words, hollow and
empty without any solid substance, there are one kind, which may be called an
Ants nest, a seed-plot or nursery of these wanton inventions, and that is it
which bears the titles of tales and novels: amongst Italians, those of Boccace
for the purity of language, are much esteemed, but they are ^o full of
impurities, impieties, fopperies, and absurdities, that I have sometimes
wondered, how such a wit, capable of so many good things, has wasted time in
tales (setting aside their filthiness) more befitting an old wife that would
bring a child to sleep, then a person professing learning: they do also make
account of those of Baudell, which I have never seen, they esteem them because
of the style, but as I have heard by those that have read them, they contain
such beastliness and abominations, that they have not only been suppressed by
authority of the Magistrate, as pernicious to good manners, but also by public
detestation: true it is that there was amongst the rest, some sad events which
had been gathered and translated into our tongue by Bell Forest, whereof he
has framed his tragical histories, yet some of them would deserve correction,
being full of flesh and blood. They have also those of Giraldy, of Sausonin, of
Straparolle, full of so much licentiousness and dishonesty, that it is pity
to see these Books in the hands of youth, who suck this Heraclian honey
(sweet but venomous) through the sight, and which by its reading, teaches such
corruptions and filthiness, as but by the practice of most dissolute persons
would never be taught them.

Moreover, in all these stories (for the most part) invented at will, there is
such manifest fopperies, and such great want of judgment in the Authors, and
of likelihood in the narrations, that it is a strange thing, that reasonable
spirits can be paid with such counterfeit and uncurrant coin. Truly, we are
not men, but by reason, and when this light of our soul is out of its
Eclipticke line, and strayed from its way, we fall into bottomless pits of
absurdities: but what shall we do to cure those that delight in their follies?

Amongst the Spaniards, above all writers of Romants, and great tellers of
tales, novelties, and stories, those of Ceroantes are much esteemed: and truly
having red them, I have found his wit to be very great in those small things. A
man of the world, a great gyber and scoffer, and who handsomely, and to the
uttermost, sets out his wares. Deigo Agrada has followed these, adding unto
his the surname of moral, because of the morals which he draws at the end of
those occurrences, which he recites. This man in my mind is more judicious,
and less insolent, although he takes license to fly out sometimes a little.
Among our French, a fine wit, in truth, and who has a fine style, has
recreated himself in writing French tales or novelties, which far surpass
the Italian, and are no whit behind the Spanish: he is moderate in his
imaginations, and modest in his words, he has not deigned to set his name to
this work, wherein he seems but to have only tried his pen, which he
destinateth to some higher and more serious labor. Another has given us a
taste of historical diversities, but this book is so little, that it is but a
show, which breeds a wish for an ampler piece. Unto this may be annexed the
tragical Histories of Bell Forest, and those made by Rosset, bearing the same
title.

These are the writings of that sort, which have fallen under my view, not that
I have taken patience to read them distinctly, but I have run over some
pieces of them, only as to feel their pulse, and inform my self of their
language and Country. But for to say in general what mine opinion is of these
and all such like confused heaps of frivolous relations, I cannot better
compare them then to dainty garden knots and borders which have Serpents hidden
under their flowers, or unto fine fields: pleasing unto the eye, but full of
Hemlocke and Aconitum, or unto Sallets, wherein are poisonous herbs, or unto
those fine Goldsmiths works, wherein are inserted base metals, and
counterfeit stones, or unto those liquorish Spanish dishes of meat, called pot
porride, delicious in taste, but prejudicial to health; or unto the horse of
Troy, out of which came armed soldiers, by whom that beautiful City was
turned into ashes. I say not this so much to disgrace my adversaries, as to
give testimony to truth.

Now (my dear Reader) it is this kind of books which I strive to supplant by
these singular Events, which I hear offer unto thy view, thou shall not see
therein those paintings of Eloquence, nor those industrious ornaments wherewith
those Antagonists adorn their ridiculous tales, to make them glyde the
sweether into the minds of them that spend time abouttheir Chymera's. But thou
shall here find natural beauties without art; I mean, examples which borrow
all their grace and worth from the force of truth which upholds them, and whose
testimonies are seen in the times, places, and persons.

All these Events, which I call singular, as well for being rare and notable,
as for having no connection the one with the other, each one making its body,
has as it were undertaken, either to cry down a vice, or to extol a virtue.
The eng ^ayme at, as being (as it is also the end of all good history) to
withdraw from evil, and to excite unto good, to breed a holy horror of bad
actions, and a just desire of actions that are good, ever (as occasion serves)
adding a few words, short, but pressing, like to so many spurs, which prick
forward to well doing, and so many Bits which hold back from the doing of
evil, sometimes showing the recompnce of goodness, and sometimes the
punishment of vice, to the end that love and fear may support the good, and
retain the bad in their endeavors. This is the mark at which this work
wholly levels, whose intention at least canblamed.

As for the manner I am to advertise thee, that I study as much as I can for
brevity, and thereupon abridge it of all the trimmings with which I extend my
other Histories, where giving my mind scope, as in a full sea, I hoyse up
sails, and run at large, as the course of my pen carries me: here I cut my
Vine, and nip of its buds, yea I clip my wings to keep me from soaring: I keep
close to the matter, and give little liberty unto my thoughts, to spread into
digressions, if they be not necessary, and as it were bred in the subject, by
reason whereof I have weaned my self from the sweet milk of poesy, and have
abstained from putting any verses in these Events. I have also taken away the
other graces, as Apostrophes, dialogismes, complaints, speeches, conferences,
letters, orations; in brief, all that might enlarge or embellish, so that in
comparison of our other relations, these are but abridgements of histories, and
as it were Skeletons, nothing remaining but the bones of each Event, stripped of
the ornaments which might have set forth their bodies in a far fairer hew. In
the art of painting, little pieces have their graces, as well as great
pictures, which have all their dimensions: so have abridgements in their
kinds, as well as larger and ampler discourses: and as stronger blows are
given by a short weapon, then by a long; a wound with a Dagger being no less
dangerous, then that with a sword: even so it happens that the mind draws more
profit from an example restrained within the bounds of its subject, then from
another whose superfluous relations may either distract the attention, or leave
it languishing: many times small streams are more delectable then great rivers,
and the least springs more pleasing then torrents, and meats cut in small bits,
are swallowed with most ease. There be minds which foil in reading a history
of great length, humane patience being not of any great extent: but when Events
are set down in such a manner, as the end is not far from the beginning,
this is it which incourageth the reader, and both gives him a desire of seeing
further, and also eases him in reading, besides variety is always more
delectable, and gives better content, then uniformity, and pleasure is a bait
to a reader, which those that write, should in no wise contemn.

This book of Events is a Garland made of many flowers, a honey composed of
many herbs, whose juyces are different, a treacle made of diverse ingredients,
and wherein the Serpent of vice is seasoned with so many antidotes, that in
liew of hurting, it will do good. It is a work of inlaying, where each piece
making its body, has a several color and virtue, and all together make a
prospective, which will not be unpleasant, except it be unto those muddy
unsettled spirits, who can like nothing of another doing, being burdensome
unto themselves, and troublesome unto all the world.

If I did write these Histories rather to please men, then to benefit my
neighbor, it may be I should be feign to fear their censures, and seek to
conjure or appease their bad humors. But should I entertain such a thought,
as to purchase reputation in this world, then would I set my self in another
posture, and would give unto my pen a subject more flashing, and ranging, but
being too weak to soar into high matters, I am content that it shall keep so
low, even to touch the ground: and that bringing more profit to my neighbor,
it should yield little or no fame unto the Author.

Examples of good and evil have a like virtue, (provided) they meet with a
disposition according in the souls of them that see them. For many read books
for curiosity, others for variety, or to pass time, and for want of other
employment, another with envy, few with sincerity, few with a desire to profit,
and to put in practice the good instructions they find therein; from whence
proceeds the ill usage of so many Authors, with so much ingratitude and
cruelty; that who so sets forth a Book, exposes himself unto the mercy of
mockers and detracters: drones which do but hu^me about flowers, without
gathering any honey from them; and as Spiders, who make venom of all that they
read.

But let them say on, some good souls (nevertheless) whose dispositions are
inclined to virtue, will be glad to find profitable admonitions set do^ne, and
sweetly mingled with varieties of pleasures fitting their humor. And therefore
I have strov^ by the help of my pen to publish examples worthy to be noted, to
the end that we may grow wise by the good or evil hap of others. This is the
mark aimed at by all these Events, which I have gathered in the great field of
the world. It is your part, dear Reader, to extract honey out of the hardest
stone, oil out of the flint, studying a reformation of manners in this school
of humane actions; Remembering always that the secret (and if I may so say) the
great work of prudence and justice, is to avoid evil, and to embrace good.

THE GENEROUS POVERTY.
The First Event.
NOthing elevateth the mind so much as riches, whose ordinary effect is to
puff them up with pride, that possess them, which makes the Psalmist King to
blame those that put their trust in their own power, and boast in the
multitude of their treasures; And on the contrary, nothing so much abuses or
dejecteth a spirit, as poverty.

This has given ground for the Emblem, which represents a man cast down to
the earth by the weight of necessity, in despite of the wings of generosity,
which endeavor all they may to ra^^e him up again; For as there is a river in
Elide, which passes through the sea, and gives the waters no touch of it is
bitterness; so there are some souls so well framed, that in despite of the
meannesse of birth or breeding, yet they carry both generous, and lofty
spirits; it is like to a fire hid in mud, even as that fire which was found at
Jerusalem in the bottom of a well, at the return from the captivity of
Babylon, we shall see it verified in this Event which I learned of a German
Gentleman being at Padua.

In Breslau a chief City of Slesia, a Province of Germany, near neighboring
to Bohemia, there lived two Citizens of mean quality, who loved each other
entirely; Teudas the one was a Tradesman, and Venon, who was the other used a
kind of traffic in mercery. This Venon being gone into Vienna in Austria to
buy some commodities, stayed three months in his voyage: and at his return
found himself welcomed with two disasters, whereof he quickly grew extreme
sensible; to wit of the loss of his wife, whom he dearly loved, and by whom he
had some children: the other was the misfortune of his friend, who was cast
into prison, and past the hope of ever getting out, yet was it not for any
disorder in him, but rather it was his goodness which had brought him into
this deplorable estate; for that he having been bound in a great sum of
money for one of his friends, whom misfortune had made unable to satisfy, he
was condemned to the payment of it himself: whereupon all that he was worth
(which consisted chiefly in household stuff) he sold, and for the remainder his
body was attached, and clapped up in the Goal as aforesaid.

In this place, which may very well be called the center of misery, and the
tomb of the living; Venon came to visit Teudas, who grievously complaining of
Fortune, accused her of injustiee, in that she reduced him into that so
miserable estate for well doing: but he grieved not so much for the loss of
his liberty, and goods, or for his own misfortune, but for that he had lost
the means to marry an only daughter he had, whose age made her marriageable,
fearing necessity should bring her into some vain, and l^wd course of life.

Venon stood not to comfort him with many words, but coming to promises, which
he soon confirmed by effects, he told him, that his misery was a mark of his
virtue, against whom Fortune has a sworn and professed enmity, but he ought
to animate himself against this Fort, and to imitate wrastlers, who stretch
themselves up on their feet, so much the stronglier and more courageously, by
how much their adversary (with whom they are to encounter) is tall, and lusty:
and as for the good which he had done, whereby this evil had happened to him, he
must never the more, repent it, because whatsoever he sowed in tears, he
should reap in joy, provided that he could but possess his soul with
patience; for seeing friendship had cast h^^ into prison, now friendship should
fetch him forth, for he had means sufficient to red^eme him out of this his
misery, and relieve him in this extreme necessity, and that having hands he
might ^^^our for his living, as before he did, as for his (...) whatsoever he
had should be as common to hi^, as it was to himself, the law of perfect
friendship requiring it should be so, and that he would have him feel his good
fortune, as sensibly, as he felt his bad: the union, and connection of friends,
being no less then the union, and connection of the limbs in a man's body,
which administer to each other, as occasion serves. At least (says he) I shall
receive this contentment from the evil which has happened unto you, that
thereby I have the means offered to show you a testimony of my sincere
affection, in this your necessity, and that I am truly your friend. All that I
have is yours, make use thereof according to your several occasions: if you
thereby attain to a better fortune, I am sure you will acknowledge it: but as
for me I will have no other reward for my service, but only the continuation
of our love; and as for your daughter let not that trouble you, seeing that I
have lost my wife, I am contented to take her for my second, if you will, but
if her mind be settled else where, or that you have a desire to match her
otherwise, I have wherewithal to give her a good portion.

What unexpected consolation was this to the heart of Teudas, to hear these
speeches from his friend whose words he knew to be as true, as they were free,
he had been very unwise, if he had refused his proffered assistance in so
pressing an accident, he would have used some complements, but the greatness
of the benefit going beyond his thought, words, and thanks, vanished in his
mouth.

No says Venon (who judged of the interior thoughts by the exterior
alteration of his face) we need not give thanks for making use of that which is
our own; if I am yours, much more are all my goods yours. And either you had
no need of them, or else it was your own fault that you disposed not of them
at your pleasure heretofore.

Without any longer discourse, he goes presently home to his house, takes all
the money, that he had gotten by his wares, and delivers his friend, by paying
the sum, for which he was detained.

What say you of this generosity in a man of mean rank, who had scarce means
enough to free himself from necessity, if he should add thereto much industry
and pains.

Well, not long after he married Ermige the daughter of Teudas, who although
far from his age, yet considering the good he had done unto her Father, she
took him not only for her husband, but also for a second Father, and esteemed
her self very happy that she might serve as a recompense to him, who had so
liberally drawn her Father out of prison, she served him with all reverence,
and entire affection, that Venon thought himself much bound to him, whom he
had obliged. Who finds a virtuous woman (says the wise man) finds a price
inestimable, the heart of her husband relyes only upon her, and she waits on
him diligently, and faithfully: you cannot imagine with what ^ffection this
young woman loved this old man, and how passionately this old man affected this
his young wife.

Of so amorous an union of these two hearts, and bodies, issued Rosana, as a
creature destined to love honorably, and generously, she was but two months
old when her Grandfather Teudas overcome with sorrow, and grief for the loss
of his goods, left this life to enjoy a better.

Her Father Venon (who had much weakened his estate in drawing his dear friend
out of prison) daily felt necessity approaching, but God who guardeth the just,
and sees no good deed pass unrewarded, provides for him beyond all hope or
expectation, for those that seek him can never want any thing, Venons greatest
grief was much like that which Teudas felt in prison, because that seeing
himself old he feared, that he should not leave his wife wherewithal honestly
to maintain her self, and to bring up, and match this daughter.

Comfort thy self O Venon with good Tobias, and be assured that although
poverty overtake thee, yet thou shall have means sufficient, provided that
thou fear God, hope with Job that all shall be restored to thee again double.

Scarce had Rosana been a year at her Mothers breast, but she was plucked from
thence by an appearance of good fortune.

There are two powerful houses in Slesia, whose owners are reckoned in the
rank of Princes. The Duke of Lignits and the Duke of Swednes. The wife of one
of these great men of which my Author could not assure me, being ready to cry
out, a nurse was sought out for her to give suck to the child, which she
expected. Ermige was chosen for one of the best, that could be found in all
Breslaw: this came in good time to keep this poor family from necessity,
which daily (as I have showed before) increased.

The Duchess was delivered of a son, whom we will name Sapor, he was
delivered up to Ermige to nurse, and Rosana was put to another. And now Ermige
and her husband are made part of the Dukes household* and are wholly employed in
bringing up the young Prince Sapor; when time came that Rosana was weaned, and
of some stature, she was put to rock the Prince, and find him sport, as the
manner of children is* Thus grows Rosana gently, like a Vine by ^'s E^me tree.

When the Prince came to age and understanding, he love^ Rojana as his foster
sister, with the ordinary fondness of children toward them that make much of
them, and find them sport to pass away the time, and Rosana serves, and waits
upon him, as her Lord and Master.

Sapor was not above three or four years old when Venon paid nature the
tribute, which all humane creatures owe, leaving both his wife, and daughter to
the Duchess, who looked for no other fortune, then what proceeded from her
bounty. The little Prince affected his nurse, and foster sister in such a
manner, that although he was now weaned, yet they both tended him, and waited
on him.

But here we must observe, that as fire elevates the matters, whereinto it
takes although they are of themselves heavy, so likewise love raises the
hearts wherein it takes an impression, and stirs them up to motives, and
actions far surmounting, both the age, and condition of the parties. This I
say in respect of the love, and affection which Rosana bore to Sapor, of whom,
even in her infancy, she was so taken, that this flame increasing with her
years, arrived at last to perfection.

None will deny but that it is an error condemnable to say that parents beget
the souls as well as the bodies, knowing that their beginning comes
immediately from God, but since the disposition of temperature, and of the
organs through which the spirit exercises it is functions, has great effect in
regard of the firm union of the soul, and the body. It is no great wonder if
that Rosana being sprung from parents, whose inclinations were wholly to
friendship, that her blood and heart should be addicted to this passion,
otherwise might she have been rather thought a monster in nature, if she
should not have partaked of the qualities of those that begat her, let us
neither spare the rehearsing, nor let pass the praise due unto her faithful
affection, since that both honesty, and generosity have been the wings
wherewith it has mounted thus high. Things that are ashamed of sight most
commonly seek darkness, wherein to shroud themselves, but those that are
virtuous, walk in the light of the day; why should we blush for being in love?
there is nothing so much commendable as that which is guided by purity. The law
of Christians is wholly grounded upon love; we are not ashamed to show our love
to a picture, to a horse, or a hound: we think nothing to good for them: why
then should we be ashamed to cherish a reasonable creature? a person well
descended, well bred, who respects naught save honor, and virtue, which are
the most amiablest qualities. For beauty is but the weak wind thereof, and a
thing which ought to be taken but as the badge of goodness, even as the
blossoms on a tree are only praised for the fruits, which shall come of them.
Verily the Elements which give us our being, and life are not more necessary
then mutual love, and friendship. But whither does this thought carry me
against the promise I have made, not to let my pen fly out too far, nor
insist too long upon any particular? but the reason is, that I have in hand a
virtue so heroical, that the singularity thereof has drawn from me those few
words in it is commendation.

Rosana (as you have heard) loved Sapor in her infancy, with such an
extraordinary fervor, that as soon as she lost the sight of him, she did
nothing but weep and complain, for this Prince was the Adamant of her heart,
and she was the Marigold, whereof he was the Sun, never was there seen in so
tender years so strong a passion, all the world wondered at it; and the Duke
and Duchess took therein an incomparable pleasure: they often passed time in
vexing this little creature, by threatening to put her away from the Prince, to
which she would reply in such a manner as could not be expected from so small
an age, or so little strength, and like an Amazon sought to fight with all
those, who sought to take her joy from her.

Alas, we see many love dogs more for their trustiness then for any
handsomnesse in them, only because they are loving to them, and if beaten away,
yet they will come, and creep at their feet; love is not repa^ed, nor
satisfied but with love. It was a thing impossible but that Sapor should love
this little creature, who so much affected him, for to love is the powerfullest
charm whereby to make our selves beloved of others, he could not be without
her, and if at any time she chanced to be away, there was nothing could make
him merry.

Love equals lovers, these were equal, whether it were that love abased him
so low as her condition, or elevated her unto his quality, love breeds a
resemblance, because it is property is to transform the lover into the thing
beloved, This effect appeared in Rosana who framed her self unto all the
humors of the Prince, that she seemed rather to be wha^ she was not, she
imitated him in all, and forsaking him no more then her shadow, she did the
same things she saw him do.

The Duchess (seeing this humor) caused her (only for recreation) to be
clothed like a little page, a habit which pleased her so well that she never
put it of but with tears.

In their first infancy, which unites the tongue, they without ceremony called
brother and sister, and every one wondered at the courage, and boldness of this
little girl, when she grew bigger, she called the Prince her Master, and he
called her his Page.

All the exercises which the Master learned the Page did learn, and which is
the more to be admired, she learned them with such a grace, that she seemed
afterward for a mirror or example to her little Master, As Physic is given
to the nurse that so through the milk the child may be cured, so was it with
Sapor, for when they were to give him any lesson, either of dancing, study, or
any thing else, they first taught it to his Page, she learned the faster to
please him, and he took the greater care that he might not be outstript by a
girl, an emulation of virtue without envy. You would not choose but think
that nature by a pure instinct taught these children the most grave Philosophy
that Plato has discoursed, of the effects of honest love.

They being now grown up from the innocence of their first age, they entered
into the limits of civility, and the ceremonies of the world; and they began to
attain to the knowledge of themselves, what shame soever they sought to breed
in Rosanna, who now was grown pretty tall, to draw her from the Princes
conversation, she would never give ear thereunto, for her conversation being
unsp^tted she feared no reproach, she was so much affected to bodily exercises
as dancing, leaping, vaulting, riding, fencing, shooting with bow, and piece,
running, playing at tennis, at pell mell, and hunting, that they had mavelous
much ado to draw her from it, and not wholly, for it was impossible, the
Prince incessantly calling for her, not only, when he was at any exercise, but
at all other times when she was absent.

At last, her age permitting her no longer without decency, or modesty so
freely to frequent with Sapor, The Duchess placed her among the other
Gentlewomen, and unto some small exercises, whereunto she applied her self,
but not without much contradiction, except it were in such works, which might
yield some service, or pleasure to the Prince, for unto those she settled her
self with so much diligence, that it sufficiently witnessed the ardour of her
affection.

It happened sometimes that the other Gentlewomen would blam her for this her
extreme affection, which she showed toward the Prince, seeing the difference
of their estates, and the modesty which she owed to her sex, but thereunto she
answered, that she loved him, as a sister ought to love a brother, and with the
same reverence, that a slave bears to his Lord.

The Prince on his part bore with no less impatience the privation of his
Pages conversation, and it was his greatest contentment, when he could slip in
amongst the Gentlewomen, thereby to entertain her at will, who possessed his
thoughts.

Lewd desires being entered into his spirits with knowledge, changed his love
intosensuality, which could not be just, being that marriage was not his aim,
notwithstanding, as he long since knew the honesty of this creature, who for a
kingdom would not have blemished her integrity; he dissembled a long time his
pretention, but being not able any longer to bear the impetuosity of his
appetites, he would on a time have passed unto some unseemely, and unbefitting
action, which this generous Amazon would by no means endure, but told him,
that she would desire their loves might continue as virtuous, as ever they had
been, for (said she) if you spoil the foundation, the edifice cannot but fall
to ruin, if virtue be wanting, then farewell friendship, These words coming
from the mouth of a servant, as from a Princess; bridled for a time the
furious appetite of Sapor so much majesty has virtue in it self.

But not long after temptations gave him new alarums, so that being unable any
longer to oppose their violence, he resolved to speak, rather then perish in
silence.

Unto his lewd suite, so little expected by this wise maid he received answer
as follows. Remember O Prince that poor as I am, and destitute of fortunes
favors, I am rich in honesty. I love Sapor as my life, but as I love mine
honor more then my life, so I love it also more than Sapor. If you truly love
me, as you have given me many precious testimonies thereof, then love me
honorably, otherwise I freely renounce your friendship, and all the
advantages, that I may hope for from you thereby, I say not this to the intent
to breed more love in you, nor to draw you to desire me for your wife; such a
vain presumption never yet flattered my spirit: I know the baseness of my
descent, and that so great an elevation would soon cast me into a most
horrible precipice. I love you without interest, without pretense, and without
any other desire, then to see you great, and glorious in the world, and in the
arms of a Princess, worthy to be the spouse of so great a Prince, And both
you, and she will I wait upon with all the humility, and affection of a
faithful slave, who will seek no other reward, but the only glory of serving
you, and of loving you next after God, and mine honor, above all that is in
the world: and if fortune so frown that you dye in deeds of arms, I will
perish at your feet, that on my tomb may be mixed the Lillies of my chastity,
with the palms of my valor, and mirtles of my incomparable love to my so
deerly esteemed Master, whom I conjure to banish from his spirit all bad, and
unjust intentions, and to be ^^ther the protector, then the destroyer of the
modesty, and purity of a creature, who (saving that) is entirely his. For help
herein consider that I am your sister, if not by birth, yet by fostering, love
me then, and preserve me as a brother, and I will honor you as my Lord, my
Prince, and the only light of mine eyes.

Whosoever has seen a strong North wind sweeping away in short time all the
clouds which obscured the face of heaven, has seen the effects that these
generous words uttered forth with such a grace, and sincere feeling, wrought in
Sapor.

If it happen sometimes that a multitude having begun a mutiny, excite a
furious sedition, that fire, and sword march in the field, and Cities, that
stones fly, and rage makes a weapon of any thing that comes next. And in the
midst of all this hurliburly, a grave man of authority presents himself unto
this so many headed beast for to appease it is violence, and bring it gently
back unto it is duty, you shall on a sudden, see what effect this will work in
their ears, and what attention they will yield unto his words, wherewith he
can so well win their hearts, that weapons fall from their hands, fury,
vengeance disperse themselves, and in place of so furious a tempest succeeds a
joyful calm, In the soul of Sapor was risen a tumult of passions revolting
against reason, and this torrent bore him away into a precipice of dishonesty,
but being become wise, by the generous remonstrance of the Amazon, peace
returned to his soul; with a glorions resolution to vanquish himself, wherein
certainly he deserved more praise then if he had overcome a whole Army. For
this is the highest degree, whereunto virtue can raise a courage, seeing that
many overcome others, who else would never have subdued themselves.

After that time the Prince purifying his affections, and for ever banifhing
unclean intentions from his thoughts, never after importuned Rosana with any
thing, which might in any ways offend her chastity. And so far was he from
being cured of this ardent fever by despite, or contempt, that contrariwise
his love founded on the estimation of this virgins invincible virtue, did much
increase, if what was arrived at it is extremity could receive an increase, true
love only aims at the good of the object beloved, even as Rosana delighted
only in the honor and glory of her Prince, and to see him daily increase in
virtue, and reputation, which are the true earthly riches, that cannot perish,
so Sap^^ had nothing that he so much desired, as to raise her whom he truly
loved, as if she had been his natural sister, the flame of his love having
then no more but a moderate heat, without blackness or smoke.

The Duke his Father being dead, and he the eldest, and next lineall successor
in that house, being entered into the honors, and the rank whereunto his birth
had called him, amongst many Gentlemen his followers, he had an inclination to
favor Numerian a younger brother well descended, and of a good house, a
younger brother, which is as much to say, as one seeking his fortune in his
courage.

Friendship is not idle where it settles, it presently falls to work; that it
may make it self more known by effects, then by words. Sapor desirous to
advance this young Gentleman thought he could not more befriend him, then in
giving him for his wife, her whom he affected as his sister: And her whom he
could well have wished for himself, if the glory of his birth had not obliged
him, by reason of state; to seek a match conformable to his quality.

Numerian held for a great favor the motion, which the new Duke made him of
this marriage; considering with himself that it was the only means to
establish his fortune in this great house. The Prince himself also moved it to
Rosana, who answered him with her accustomed generosity, as follows: Master
(said she) will it not be a treason, to give this body to a man who shall not
possess the heart, being so filled with the honest love it bears you; that
there is no place void for any other subject: permit me (my dear Prince) to
die a virgin, and with the glory of a vestall, who has not let her fire go
out; The permission which I have had to love you, I hold for so great an
honor; and the happineffe of your reciprocal friendship, is so precious in my
memory, that I should think my self a bastard Eagle, that having fastened mine
eyes on so great a light, should now remove them on some lesser star; permit
me to be an Heliotropean (the herb Turnesole) and that I may close up the
leaves of my affections to all other lights, but only to that which gives me
day. It is not that I pretend any other thing in my love, but the contentment I
find in honoring you; and you know that I have often protested that the
happiness to wait upon you, sufficiently pays the reward of all my services.
For all the recompense which I look for from you, is to be, and so to dye,
yours; Neither do I disdain Numerian being a brave, and virtuous Gentleman;
and of whose merit, although I had no other proofs save your estimation, it
would be sufficient, to make me respect him. For your judgment is my law, and
your will my rule. No, unto what degree soever your goodness shall raise me,
yet I shall never forget the meandness of my condition. But I am of that
opinion, that I should love that fair image, which love for you has graven in
my heart, if I should lodge another therein, which has made me desire to live,
and dye as I am.

Sister (said the Prince ravished in admiration at the courage of this female)
if I thought the marriage which I propound unto you, should never so little
diminish the affection you bear me, I would never consent thereunto, nothing
being so precious to me, as to see my self beloved, and so fervently by a
subject so amiable, but because the love that you shall bear to him as your
husband, shall not be contrary to that which you bear to me, as being your
brother, I did verily believe that this marriage would bring neither to me, to
him, or to you any manner of prejudice. Love is like honor, which varies it
self according to the qualities of the persons, or like unto the Pourcontrell,
or Peake fish, who becomes of the same color the things are, whereon it
fastens, so that a man may love diverse persons with all his heart, according to
diverse respects, a father, as a father, a mother, as a mother, a husband, as a
husband, and a brother, as a brother: This flame of love extends it self like
unto the flame of a torch, which lights many others without wasting it self;
and it is thus that I intend to give you unto Numerian, you know I love him,
but with a far inferior affection to that I bare you, my desire is to advance
him, and likewise you, so that when you are joined together I shall have a
double cause to do you good, and to gratify you in what I may.

By these reasons which were as plausible, as true, Rosana (who saw but through
the eyes of Sapor) suffered her self to be drawn to this match, whereof none
was more joyful then Numerian, in so much that it is hard to express the
contentment he took, being as it were, in ecstasy, or transportation of his
spirit.

The first time, that the Prince made them talk together, Rosana with that
manly, and generous gesture, which was both usual, and natural in her, spoke
to this Gentleman as follows, Sir here is your Master, and mine, who has a
desire to join us together in the laws of Hymen: But before I embrace his
proffer, and before I will be made subject to your power, I must propound two
conditions, without the which I cannot, nor will not be persuaded to take you
for my husband, my body shall be thine, and so entirely thine, that never any
but thy self shall have part therein. I shall come a Virgin to thy bed, and if
it be so that I must loose the flower of that integrity, which I did intend to
preserve all my life time, yet it shall perish at least with honor in lawful
wedlock; first then thou shall not need to watch over my fidelity, because I
shall be more jealous thereof, then thou can, and if I should chance to
offend therein (although I rather wish all the thunders of heaven to fall on my
head, yea the earth to open and swallow me up) my hand should prevent thine in
the revenge of so great a wrong, and if death permits me to survive thee, be
sure, that even to thine ashes I will keep a body pure, and a troth inviolable.
I will love thee as my husband with all my heart, but for to prevent
jealousies, know thou this, that I will love Sapor as my Prince, and dear
Master, but imagine not him to have any part thereby in any thing which shall
appertain to thee, nor to be arrival or sh^rer in thy bed, he has no such
thought, and if he had, he should find his expectation frustrate; and if thou
do (...), that this friendship, which is so pure, honest, just, ^^^ lawful,
should be contrary to the loyalty, I owe to thee, and that it may be a means
to d^vide my heart, Then even at this present I renounce thy love, and
alliance, for I am resolved to carry to my grave this first, and glorious
flame, wherewith my heart has been fed, and my spirit pleased, even from my
cradle hitherto, and if you think these things agreeable with the duties, I
shall owe to thee, here I am ready to obey him, whose desires are laws to me.
The other condition is, that thou take me not as a house Dove, to employ my
self in spinning, sowing, and keeping the chimney corner, thou know that I
have been bred in another manner, and according to that, I desire that thou
permit me to exercise my self in arms, and hunting, and such like
recreations, and if thy courage do call thee at any time forth to war,
either of thy own accord, or with our Master, that thou then make me partaker
of thy labors, and thy hazards, and also of thy laurells, and palms. On these
conditions I am ready to obey, and to follow thee in life or death.

Numerian no less ravished at the spirit, and courage of this maid, then with
her beauty, which indeed though mean, yet embellished with extraordinary
graces, agreed unto all she desired, joying much in having met with a mate,
with whom he might reap as many laurells, as myrtles.

The young Duke honored this marriage with such pomp, and magnificence, that
he could not have expended more liberally at the marriage of his own sister,
he gave also large gifts to the married couple, which were but in earnest, for
greater things, that he intended to effect for their advancement.

Numerian remained still with the Prince, and in greater authority in the
house, and Rosana with the Duchess Dowager, who was very glad of this marriage,
which freed her from the fears she had, that her son passionately affecting
this maid should have a desire to marry her.

Not long after Sapor wedded a young Princess of Bohemia, and at this wedding,
did Rosana (among the joys she had to see her Prince so highly matched) make
her grace and ability appear, in the Maskes, Tournaments, and other things,
which Knights did, to honor this feast, she bore away many prizes, which won
her great praise, yea without envy of her competitors, who admired the good
carriage, and dexterity of this Amazon: But the richest Jewel that she then
won was the heart of the young Princess, who took such an affection unto
her, that she seemed to dispute the pre-eminence thereof with her husband, thus
does virtue purchase estimation wheresoever it comes, and in this manner does
it draw hearts unto it.

She with Numerian had such credit, and authority in the Princes house, that
all passed through their hands, and nothing was well thought on but what came
from them.

Thus they passed some years, rich in wealth, and children, when the wars of
Hungary, a kingdom neighboring unto Slesia, came to disturb this calm. The
Prince Sapor being called by the Emperor, had great command in the Army,
whereunto he went, with a train befitting his greatness; Numerian, who was
always at his side, intended not to forsake him in this voyage, whereunto his
own courage was a sufficient solicitor, beside the loyalty, and love he bore
to his Master.

He intended to leave his wife to wait upon the young Duchess, but she
unwilling replied unto him as follows. Numerian (said she) thou do ill,
remember our contract of marriage, thou wrongest our love in desiring alone to
run the hazard of war, heaven having made me thy partner, and I shall
continue so as well in things that tend to profit, and also in those that tend
to the hazard of your person, neither is it thy part to hinder me from entering
into the least part of the honor thou art going to purchase, I can despise
life, and defy death, chiefly if I see my noble Master, and thy self
witnesses of my valor, and fidelity.

Never had I (said Numerian) the least distrust either of thy faith, or thy
courage, neither is it that which makes me desire thee to abide with the
Princess, but only to be a comfort, and an associate in the absence of the
Prince, besides the events of war are uncertain: and I wish that thou may
survive me to bring up our children, and to preserve my memory.

No, no, replied Rosana, I am d^stinated to some other matter, then to govern
a family, others shall have that charge; the love I bear to my Master, and to
thee, permits me not to forsake you, if you die, I will die also; if you live,
I will live, whether you go I will follow, separation cannot have place in our
union.

Be it than as thou will (said Numerian) I will not envy the glory, which thou
may purchase, it shall be common to us both, let us go, and hazard our lives
in the service of our benefactor.

She than puts on man's apparel, and following her Master, and husband they
arrive at the Army.

Every day Sapor gave wonderful proofs of his valor, and Numerian, with the
fair she warrior never lost siight of him. For to have acknowledged their
victories with Crowns, a Forest of Laurel, would scarce have sufficed.

Upon a day a toy took them to give the enemy an assault in one of his
quarters, but the sentinel having given the watch word, they found themselves
encompassed in such sort, as the Prince was in great danger, either of loosing
of his life in the place, or of being taken by the Turks. Then did love whose
fire works no less effects, then the fire of thunder, cause Rosana to take
such pains as cannot be expressed, now thought she, or never, is it time to make
proofs, and show of my true affection unto him whom I love more then my self,
with which thought she immediately cast her self, where the danger was most
eminent, even like a furious Tigres, who runs her self amongst the weapons
of the hunters, by seeking to free her young ones, she lays at the first she
meets, and overturnes him, strikes another, makes a third run away, and gives
no stroke, but it lights home, and is sorely felt, she plays her part so
well, that opening the thickest of the prease she makes way for the Prince to
escape.

Numerian seeing this, stooped down his head, and runs himself into the
midst of them, and labors to do some good office for that dear half of
himself, who had done so much for Sapor, and as one more careful of hers then
of his own life, he conjured her affectionately to retire, under the safeguard
which he yielded thereto by his resistance.

What said she (in a kind of anger) would you counsel me to forsake the
honor, wherein I am, to purchase shame by flight, if you will oblige me, then
I pray retire your self, I have yet both an arm, and a heart strong enough to
uphold your retreat, it were pity that you should cast your self away, being
able enough to pleasure our Master in an occasion of more importance, only
remember our love, and tell him, that I die his slave.

I refuse thy warrant said Numerian, for I will rather dye, then see thee
perish, I conjure thee by the obedience thou owe me, that thou get thee from
hence, age, and reason, yea and sex will, that I precede thee, go serve my
Master and cherish my memory, as thou have promised.

Whilst they thus contested, Sapor was in safety, and these two lovers found
themselves inwrapped by a multitude, who furiously summoned them to lay down
their arms, whereunto these great courages replied boldly, that they were
never accustomed to make such dishonorable compositions, we will, said they,
die with our weapons in our hands, to which words they joined blows, turning,
and laying about them on all sides, that they made the very stoutest give
back, but as they were about to make a glorious retreat, and had almost given
way to their own soldiers, even then a multitude overcomming them again,
Numerian was thrown to the ground, and run through in diverse places, having but
so much time as to say farewell my dearest Rosana, thy courage has undone us.

These words moved with pity the very hearts of those barbarous people, who
invited the valiant she warrior to yield, desiring her to be willing to live,
and to comply with the desire they had to save her, but this admonition was in
vain, for this generous loving woman answering only with her sword, so
kindled the wrath of those she hit, that one of the wounded desirous to revenge
his hurt, thrust his sword quite through her body, and sent her soul to
accompany Numerians.

The skirmish ended she was found among the dead, with her husband, and after
they knew that she was a woman, they that had felt her strokes, did more
admire her valor.

Now the sorrow, and grief of Sapor cannot be expressed, which he took in this
loss, he sent for the two bodies, that he might yield to their ashes (which he
watered with his tears) some testimony of his friendship, he caused them to be
carried to Slesia, where he spared no cost to make their funerals and caused a
most stately tomb to be erected over them, for preserving their memory unto
posterity as long as marbles can last.

In this Event all men may plainly see, that virtues strive to enter in rank
into the Elegy of this generous Amazon, purity, magnanimity, constancy,
valor, courtesy, resolution, courage, but above all that makes it most
illustrious who can but admire to see love, and honor, with honesty to be so
straightly conjoined in her spirits.

O soul truly heroical, and who might have deserved a more eminent birth,
and higher fortune, but what need had she of birth, or fortune? showing us in
her generous poverty, that virtue is not tied in the degree or blood of
persons, and that it raises those that possess it even above all humane
condition.

THE PRVDENT MOTHER.
The Second Event.
WHen Widows are left with children grown to man's estate, they commonly are
much troubled in governing them, for they are like horses, as we may say,
having slipped the collar, soon forgetting the respect, which they owe unto those
that have begotten them and they think themselves too wise to be ruled by a
woman's counsel, yea they scorn to submit themselves to a sex which seems to
be borne for to live in subjection, Fathers as being stronger keep the
authority over them better, but what they restrain in them by power, and
fear, mothers should do by prudence, and love, following his maxim of the
mother which I shall represent unto you in this Chapter, who turned back her
son from a foolish design, preserved the honor, and quiet of her house, and
was after all, most dutifully thanked of her child, who confessed to have had
from her both his being and raising.

She was of that part of Gaul which is commonly held to be the country,
wherein wisdom does inhabit, where the North wind does subtilize the air,
and causes it to pass through the spirits of the inhabitants, who thereby
become, wonderful crafty, circumspect, and discreet in their affairs, you may
suppose that I speak of Neustria, but I know not whether it were in the
higher, or the lower, that this happened which I am about to relate,
notwithstanding there are some that conjecture it to have been in the lower
patt, and in a City joining to the sea coast, as it will appear in the sequel
of this Event.

A widow Lady, whom we will call by the name of Fronesse because of her
prudence, kept her house in a Castle, whereof her husband, now deceased, was
Lord, who left her diverse children, whose breeding, and bringing up was all her
care.

It is well known that in Normandy the eldest son carries away all the
means and estate, the youngest he leaves to inherit misery, so that this
mother being not able to bestow on them any thing, save breeding, to the end,
that they might advance themselves in the world, by the virtues, and good parts
which she intended to confer upon them, she spared no cost to procure them
the learning of exercises, fitting for them. The eldest, to whom we will give
the name of Thierry, finding himself to have a good estate, took little care
in any thing, but only in hunting, and in visiting his neighbors, which are
the employments of Gentry, and Nobility in that country; and in this manner of
idleness, it is no wonder but the fire which lies commonly in young blood,
should kindle in the veins. Objects (says the old maxim) do moove the
powers, and he having no other but such as were base, and inferior, a m^^ne
subject, and inferior inthralled him: A husband man, who was tennant to one of
his Farms, had a daughter whose beauty was above a country beauty, and whose
wit, and person had not any thing clownish, nor unbefitting, but her apparel.

Nature who breeds pearls so clear, and smooth in shells so rugged, and who
creates the precious Diamonds, and Rubies, in the craggiest rocks, takes
delight sometimes to show that she is no less industrious in the country, then
in cities, and that there she can produce a field full of flowers, which
oftentimes may contend for beauty, and sent with those that are carefully
nursed up in walled Gardens, and in the best ordered grounds, and to say the
truth, I find that guile is so rooted in Cities, that honesty, and beauty are
there for the most part artificial, and sophisticated, whereas in the
simplicity of the Country, there is as little art in manners, as painting on
faces, and in conclusion, beauty is there for the most part more chaste, and
chastity more fair.

This young Gentleman feeling himself inflamed with the love of this Driade
whose name was Enemond, imagined that she being not only his subject, but as
were his domestical, he should easily tame her, and bring her to the fist, as
a bird of lure, but he flattered himself with that he only desired, for he
found himself far wide from his account, meeting in this chaste creature
such an untractable humor, which serves for a rampire unto honesty, that he at
first thought this haggardlinesse to proceed from the rudeness of her
breeding, and that being not accustomed unto the honors, and blandishments he
used toward her, she was therewith affrighted, but who so considers that she
is a Norman, who with the very milk has sucked in craft, and circumspection,
shall soon know that she rather fained her self affrighted, only of purpose
to avoid the importunities of this complementer, in vain did he look, wink,
court, sing, prattle, make such postures, and gestures, as youth is wont to use
to express their passion, because she had neither, eyes, tongue, gesture,
countenance, nor signs to correspond with so many fooleries, but closed her
ears against the tunes of this inchanter, seeing him come she would turn
another way, or draw near unto her mother, or employ her self about some
huswifery, in brief she avoided the approach of this Gallant with such studied
flights, and shifts, that all the subtilties, which he invented to entrap her,
were as so many vented mines, without any effect. In fine seeing that she could
no longer avoid the importunities of this droane who was continually buzzing
about her ears, as a wise, and well advised maid, she acquainted her mother
therewith, to the end that she might make it known unto Fronesse the mother of
this Gentleman. This Lady (extremely exact in what concerned her honor, and
one who was ever watchful to preserve the good name of those, that served her)
had no sooner known the passion of her son, but she gave him such sharp,
but discreet instructions, that had he been capable of reason, it would have
made him become wise, what did not she say? to admonish him of his folly, with
what did she not threaten him? if he abstained not from so base a design, but
this passion had cast such a veil over his eyes, and so shut up his ears,
that he little regarded the profitable admonitions of Fronesse.

He persists obstinately in persuite of Emenond, and the more to entice her, he
promises her marriage, but she although a Country wench yet preferred her
honesty before all the wealth in the world, she was also held fast by another
tie, being long before engaged in her affection unto a youth of her own
quality, whom she loved as deerly, as she did her life: so on the one side the
loyalty she had vowed to keep to him, that loved her for a good end, and one
the other fide fear of being deceived, or forced by Thiery made her marveilous
circumspect, and wary, she well knew the great difference of these two parties,
and as she saw likelihood to hope for the one, so she thought it but a folly to
desire the other; for what show soever this young Gallant made, or what oaths
soever he did swear, she knew his intent was but only to get his will of her,
and then to leave her, but the Bird was craftier then the crafty fowler, and
what nets, or snares soever he set, either by his sighs, his Crocodile tears,
his presents, or his promises, he could never get footing, in the good opinion
of this discreet maid, who endeavored with more cunning to defend her self,
then he did to assail her.

In mean time the vehemence of his passion did grow so unmeasurably, that it
brought him to the gates of fury, and despair, if at the first he jested, when
he spoke of marrying this country wench, at last seeing there was no other way
to attain to the top of his desires, he requires in good earnest to have her
in marriage. The more Fronesse laughs at this his proposition, the more he
grows obstinate, and having gotten the knowledge that Final was beloved of
this maid, he swears that he will rid the world of him, and in effect this
poor country fellow avoided as much as possible he could the presence of this
madman.

The parents of Enemond by the command of Fronesse locked up their daughter,
insomuch that she was not seen by the rays of the Sun, Thierry seeing
himself hindered by so many obstacles, enters into such a frenzy, that he
seems like a man without either sense, or reason, his blood being moved by
sorrow, and anger, a strong Fever seized on him, and that so surely, that the
Doctors judged him a dead man, still he cries out of Enemo^d, so deep was the
thought of her rooted in his ^^agination.

The prudent mother sustained all this while an incomparable sorrow for the
loss of this child, who being her eldest she counted him for the pillar of her
family, she knew very well the ground of his disease, and fearing least
contradiction should make him worse, she intends to deal with him, as with
those melancholy Hypochondriachs, unto whose fantasies, how extravagant soever
they be, they must never be opposed, so that by degrees sweetning the
bitterness of his spirit, and promising him satisfaction, and that if he could
recover Enemond, he should have her for his wife, by these two li^^ments the
extremity of his fury was tempered, and somewhat assuaged, and his fever
became more moderate, so that this her fair speech worked the same operation
in him, as music does unto those in Calabria that are stung by the venomous
Spider Tarantula, he began shortly to amend and show signs of his recovery,
but very often would he urge his mother to reiterate her promise that he should
have Enemond; when he began to grow dull, for the greater furtherance of his
health, they caused this maid to come to him, which had almost cast him into a
relapse, for hearing her speak, as she was by them instructed, he was on a
sudden so overjoyed, that he redoubled his Fever, which was far more
dangerous then at the first; at last Fronesse thinking with her self, that
when he recovered his health he would constrain her to keep these promises,
(which were made but as lures to bring him forwards) devised a stratageme which
took happy effect. Now began Thierry to walk about his chamber, and to ask
for Enemond.

To whom answer was made that she with the grief that she took for his
sickness was her self fallen into so violent a Fever, that she was thought
to be in great danger; this soon assaulted the heart of Thierry, who would not
so soon have appeased himself, but that he imagined this news to be fained,
he has a great desire to go visit this sick maid, and continually
entreates that he may be led to her, but Fronesse ordered the business in
another manner; and to cut up the root of all these fooleries in her son,
she presently caused Final to be married to Enemond, and gave three hundred
French Crowns in portion to this maid, upon condition that she, and her
husband should go into Picardy, and there live for a year or two. Now said
she we must make Thierry believe that Enemond is dead, and because that he
will scarce believe his own eyes for the verity thereof, we will give her a
sleepy potion, that shall so soundly benume her senses, for three or four
hours, that she shall seem as dead indeed, then shall he see her in this
state, yea we will cause her obsequies to be prepared, and a fantasme, or
species to be put into the grave, so that generally she shall be said to be
dead, Final, Enemond, and her parents all agreed unto Fronesse her will,
Enemond counterfeits her self sick and takes the sleepy potion, the news of
her death is spread about the town, and brought to Thierry, he sees her in this
case, and believes she is dead, a burial is fained, whilst she and her
husband are going in a voluntary exile to the furthest part of Picardy, Thierry
abandons himself, and spends his time only in sorrow, and tears, tearming
himself the unfortunatest of all lovers, sometimes he seeks to end his days
by hunger, another time by poison, again by some steeled weapon, whereupon
some grave religious men are brought to him, who prevailed over his passion so
far by their good exhortations, that they quite rooted up these unnatural,
and desperate resolutions of his mind.

The prudent mother (who now knows the amorous inclination of her son, and
that if his love remain without an object (such a melancholy may seize on him
that he may thereby fall into a consumption) seeks on all sides for a match
fitting for him; Wives are as easy to be found for rich elder brothers, as
difficult to be found for poor younger brothers, but Thierry must be cured by
a remedy proportionable to his disease, beauty has wounded him, beauty must
therefore be the antidote, that must cure him, Fronesse not much respecting
wealth, makes choice of a very fair, and virtuous Gentlewoman named Gaudence,
who was the wonder of all eyes, that beheld her, she delays no time, but
presently communicates her mind, and desire to the maids parents, they
considering how advantageous, and profitable this alliance might in time grow
to be, held themselves much honored in granting her request, but said Fronesse
you must add your helping hand, for we must deal in this matter, as with a
sick mind, therefore I hold it not convenient to speak to him of suppressing
his old flames by new affections, as yet, for you know, that the want of
appetite, or relish in sick persons, causes them to dislike the best meats:
we must be industrious, and so work the matter, that he may be snared of his
own accord, without perceiving any thing at all of the business. There was no
more comparison to be made between this Gaudence, and and the other country
maid with whom he was so far taken, then between the day, and the night, but
as those, that have been a long time in darkness, must of necessity have
sometime to use themselves to light, and to know its worth; so it is needful
for this poor man almost out of his senses to return to reason by little, and
little, and to acknowledge by degrees, the difference between a fair noble,
and well bred Gentlewoman; and a rude country wench: be pleased therefore (said
she) speaking to the mother of Gaudence, to visit me as as a neighbor, and to
give you the more cause to come the oftener, we will fain some business, which
you desire to be decided between us, and bringing your daughter with you, I am
sure her presence will do more of it self, then I should be able to do by all
my authority, or instructions.

This discreet plot was approved on by the parents, and succeeded so happily,
that without enlarging my self any further on the particularity of this new
love, I will say in a few words, that Thierry became so amorously taken with
the beauty of Gaudence, that hardly any memory of his first doting affection
remained in him: crafty Fronesse seeing him tied in affection to this fair
face, and engaged by desires to this object, took no small delight in seeing
her bird so entangled, and the more to augment these desires, she proposed
difficulties, by reason of the unequality of the match, and seemed backward in
giving consent to that, which she desired no less then Thierry.

Not long after this match was consummated with such content to this Gentleman,
that his joy cannot be expressed but by the words of such, who have been in the
like manner ravished, and transported as he was: about two or three years
after, his mother seeing him still more and more possessed with the love of his
spouse, and jesting with him at the passion he was in for Enemonde, she
discovers the whole stratageme whereof she had made use, by that means to draw
him from the match, whose inequality would have been an everlasting reproach
unto his posterity; now this was the time wherein Thierry acknowledged the good
his mother had done for him, and presently yielded her infinite thanks.

Final, and Enemond were recalled from their exile, and the honor, and peace
of this family was attributed to the wise government of this prudent mother.

THE DISCREET CHILDREN.
The Third Event.
THE former Event has showed you in a prudent mother the care that parents
have of their children, and in this Event you shall see the reverence, and
obedience due unto parents, by the story, which I shall relate unto you, which
will show you the great wisdom, and discretion of children that endeavor to
hide, and bear with the infirmities of her, who had brought them into the
world.

On that great and famous River of Rhine, which heretofore served as a bound
unto our Gaul, there are diverse Earls, which in the language of that Country
are called Rhinegraves. It is well known that of all nations there is none
that so jealously preserve their Nobility, as the German, nor more fear to
undermatch themselves, so that an Earl will never give his daughter to a
Baron, nor a Marquess will not marry with the daughter of an Earl, and in
this manner are families carefully preserved in their state, and dignity, thus
much I say because the knowledge thereof serves for a ground to our story.

An Earls daughter whom we will call Crisolite having also married an Earl of
the Rhine or a Rhingrave, had by him many children, whereof four, to wit, two
sons, and two daughters were living when as he dyed, and left her a widow at
the age of forty years, and by reason that she had been married very young,
her children were then of good years, so that the eldest was in the two or
three and twentieth year of his age; This Lady for a time managed their
estate, with all the diligence, and care of a mother, who truly, and entirely
loves those, that are blood of her blood, and flesh of her flesh; In the cold
time of her widdowhood there kindled in her such ardours, as could not honestly
be quenched but in a second marriage.

This good Dutch woman, who went plainly to work in this her intent, casts her
eyes diverse ways to find out a match equal to her birth, for Noble men of
that quality are far more scarce there then in France, and Italy; and besides
among those, that she could either have wished, or intended to have had, there
was none found that was willing to match with a widow of her age, and charged
with children, so that all hope being taken from her that way, her looks which
did but seek to find a Rock worthy her shipwreck went no great voyage ere
they found it; a young Gentleman one of her subjects, who was ordinarily among
the followers of her children, was the mark whereat she aimed: This fair
image slipping through her eyes into her heart, ingraved it self so deeply
there* that it was wholly past her power to raze it out: truly there lie hid
great incommodities in greatness, amongst many this is one, to be always in
view, and yet to have no liberty to act what we would, and this is it that kills
Crisolite, who agitated by her new flames, can neither quench them, nor
manifest them, d^ring neither by word, nor by sign, to evaporate the least
sparkle thereof, with what contradictions, is she tormented, on the one side
representing unto her self the perfections of her new beloved, which her
imagination augmented after the manner of those that love; on the other side
the glory, and quality of her birth, which she blemished in so much abasing her
affections toward a subject, so far disproportioned.

The German Nation free as the French, is not capable of long concealment:
after Crisolite had in vain employed her whole endeavors to drive from her
mind this delectable Idae^, which so willingly persecuted her, she resolved to
discover her flame (whose pretentions were just being they aimed at marriage)
unto whose conficient person, she therefore first reveals it to one of her
Gentlewomen, one of a stayed age, and whose fidelity she had tried before in
weighty matters, but this woman well knowing the custom of the country, did so
mislike that her Mistress should so unequally bestow her self, that in stead of
moderating the passion of this gentle Lady by mild words, she more augmented
it by her contradictions, so far rejecting what Crisolite had said unto her,
that she would scarce have patience to hear her.

The Countess repulsed on this side, gave her woman charge to keep all
secret, and promised her (though far from her intent) to think no more of
Fleuriall (so will we call this Gentleman) but she soon addressed her self to
one of her domesticalls, from whom she hoped to have fewer replies, and more
service, wherein she was no whit deceived, for great persons find too many
favorers, and furtherers of their passions, how unjust, and unreasonable
soever they be: this man's name was Leuffroy, unto whom his Lady having
committed her secret in trust, he promised to execute faithfully all that she
should command him: nothing else I desire, said she, of thee, but that thou
faithfully make known unto Fleuriall his good fortune, in the greatness, and
purity of my affections.

Leuffroy failed not so to do, and having made this Gentleman understand the
passions that the Countess suffered for him, which tended only to marriage,
Fleuriall stood more amazed at this discourse then if he had been stricken
with a thunderclap: he was not so simple but that he knew to what height of
wealth, and greatness this love called him; but he considered withal, that
the highest aicents, make the deepest precipes, and that the sorest falls
follow extraordinary raisings, he supposed, that if he should correspond with
Crisolites desires, he should arrive unto such wealth, as he durst never have
so much as hoped for, on the other side he feared the wrath of her children,
who coming to know this practice, would terare him in a thousand pieces, as he
very well knew the humor of fortune, who deceitful as she is, deals with men
as the Eagle with the Tortois raising them very high, for to shatter them in
pieces, by casting them down, and that rubbing the glass on the top with honey
she makes the drinker taste the Wormwood in the bottom, he would not trust
too much therein, nor be taken like a silly bird, by the glistering of this
fair glass, fear overcame his ambition at first, and made him slight
Leuffroyes recital, giving no other answer, but that speaking without letters
of credence, he could not persuade himself otherwise but that he intended
thereby to mock his good meaning.

If that be all replied Leuffroy, I shall soon certefie you that I speak not
of mine own accord, but well authorized by her who gave me this charge, not
long after he brought him letters from the Countess, whose hand he knew very
well, which caused him not to doubt of Leuffroyes commission; notwithstanding
whether it were, that he continued in his fears, or that he meant to cast oil
on the fire of this Ladies inflamed heart, he said unto the Messenger, that he
feared a surprisall, and that this hand being easy to be counterfeited, it was
perhaps a lure to call, and a snare to entrap, and undo him.

Leuffroy was at the point of being angry at this mistrust, which seemed to
tax him with treachery, but considering with himself the just cause, that
Fleuriall had to suspect, and besides that his Ladies intent was not to vex
him, he moderated his choler, and turning it into a merriment, he said verily
fair sir you marvellously fear your skin, and you seem very nice in an
occasion, for which a thousand knights would hazard the loss of a thousand
lives a piece; it is, said Fleuriall, neither my life, nor my skin that I
seek to put in safety, being ready to expose both the one, and the other unto
all manner of pains, and death for the service of so noble a Lady, but I fear
that her honor, which is dearer to me then all that concerns my self, should
become interessed, or wronged, and then if her children should never so little
perceive this business, what corner of the earth were able to shelter me from
their wrath, or what power could make me escape the cruelty of their vengeance.

Discreet Leuffroy having by this discourse understood the motions of this
Gentleman's soul, who was held back from seconding the intentions of the
Countess, only by fear of her children. made it all known unto her,
whereupon Crisolite resolved not to waste her self away in that manner, by
concealment of her affection from her children, being to her as unprofitable,
as it was troublesome, but before them to declare her passions and intentions.

Having then on a morning caused them all four to come into her chamber, two
wit, the two sons, Maximillian, and Septimus, and the two daughters, Anicete,
and Catherine: She said thus unto them, my good children, for the cares I have
had in your bringing up, and for the endeavors of a good mother, which I have
ever yielded unto you, I believe none of you but will confess how tenderly,
and heartily I have loved you, during the time that heaven permitted me to live
with your now deceased father. I have behaved my self toward him with all the
submission, modesty, and fidelity, which a wife owes unto her husband, but in
fine cruel death has taken him from me, and parted us, and he has left me in
an age not yet so great, that it should freeze the blood in my veins, nor
interdict me to think of a second marriage; I have done all that I can to put
this idle fantasy out of my head, but my nature is so repugnant unto this holy
virtue of continency, which heaven does not grant to every one, that I believe
I ought rather to marry then to burn; and that is the thing I am determined to
do: but because I am not of a common condition, matches conformable to my
birth and quality, are not easily found; therefore I have cast mine eyes, and
fixed my heart on a Gentleman, with whom I hope to have more contentment then
if he were of greater degree; and whose alliance will be less prejudicial
unto you, then if I took another of higher birth: I know the laws of the
Nobility of this Country very well, but I know also, that the laws of nature
are more ancient, and those of love more strong, you know what great revenewes
I have brought to this house, which if it were transsported into the hands of
another husband, your inheritance would be much diminished, I have found a way
with which I shall rest well contented, our honor shall be sheltered, and your
means shall not be lessened, nor impoverished: I will secretly marry this
Gentleman, whom I shall name unto you, he shall dwell in my house as a
domestical servant, none shall know that I have mismatcht my self; and if any
children shall issue from him, and me, they shall be brought up secretly, and
they may be provided for with indifferent means. In this manner without any
prejudice to you, I shall be satisfied. I speak freely, and roundly to you, as
to my children, from whom I hope for as much love, respect, and consent, as the
goodness of your nature does promise me: another, it may be, more haughty and
more imperious would have done whatsoever her passion had dictated unto her,
without your counsel, and it may be also that another having less fear of
God, and less respect to honor, would have remedied her incontinency by
means, as dishonorable, as unlawful: but I had rather dye a thousand deaths,
then to set such a spot on my blood, and posterity, knowing this that a woman
without honesty, of what quality soever she be, is but as it were a laistall;
finally I do entreat you not to speak any thing to dissuade me from this my
resolution, being I have declared unto you, that it is absolutely necessary for
my contentment, only judge whether the way by me proposed be not reasonable,
and fitting, as well to set my conscience at rest, and my honor at shelter, as
to preserve the means which I brought into your Fathers house.

If these four children were not amazed at this proposition, is not a question
to be asked, but at last seeing they must make use not of consultation, but of
resolution, in a business determine, they make a virtue of that necessity,
which is not subject to any laws, and embracing obedience, and discretion,
inclined themselves to the will of their mother, whom they saw to be as
careful of their good, as of her own contentment; whereupon the eldest
speaking for all the rest, answered her with all dutiful respect, and modesty:
that although their common desires could (it may be) more wish to see her in a
glorious widdowhood, then in a disadvantagious marriage, nevertheless, they
were so many ways obliged to her, both for their lives, and for the means
which they held of her, and also for the great pains she had taken in their
education, that they had rather renounce themselves, and their own judgments
then to contradict her, in any one point: that she was their Mother, their
Lady, and their Mistress, that she might dispose of their bodies, their lives,
their means, and their wills according to her good pleasure, it belonging not
unto them to resi^^ any of her intentions, and that the only glory of obeying
her, as their mother was the fairest lot in their heritage, and seeing that
they had hitherto been ruled, and governed by her without any contradiction,
in what concerned themselves, they could not with reason disapprove what she
should do for her self, that they would honor, and respect him, that she
should choose for her husband, after what manner soever she would command, and
that she might be only pleased to appoint, and she should find in them a
perfect obedience.

Chrisolite saw that these were not so much words of complement, as of sincere
verity, weeping with joy, and tenderness, and blessing the wit, and discretion
of her children, thanked them with great signs of acknowledgement, and having
discovered unto them her affection to Fleuriall, and that it was he that she
intended to have, not long after she made him the Steward of her house, and
having privately married him, none being present but only her children,
Leuffroy, and some of her Gentlewomen; this young Gentleman in stead of being
puffed up with pride by his match, behaved himself with so much humility, and
moderation, as well toward the Countess, as toward her children, that both
the one, and the other strove who should love him most.

There were two daughters borne in this second marriage, who were brought up
secretly; the first whereof, and eldest was named Margarite, the other named
Lucide, who some few years after the death of Chrisolite was honorably
married, she inherited the wealth, wherewith the Countess and her former
children honored the fidelity of Fleuriall, who even after the death of
Chrisolite remained with Maximilian the Rhinegrave governing all his house.

Thus was the mother contented, the children counted discreet, and all things
passed quietly without rumor, and to say the truth for to hinder a widow from
marriage who is resolved to marry, is as much as to oppose banks unto a great
torrent of waters, besides it is not the part of dutiful children to control
the will of their parents; yea I dare say although it were somewhat
unreasonable. These children did deserve much praise, who by their submission,
and consent avoided the tumult, and broils, which opposition, and resistance
breeds, and by their secrecy and silence, preserved the honor of continency,
and by their prudence and discretion retained the great means, which came to
them by their mother: but truly the moderation of Fleuriall deserves a
particular praise, having been able to contain within the bounds of respects,
notwithstanding this elevation, it being a thing ordinary enough to spirits
less judicious, for to pass from use to abuse, and from riches to insolence,
which has caused the proverb, that honors change manners, a proverb crossed
by the temperance of this Gentleman.

THE CVRRIED PERSONS.
The Fourth Event.
WHen a sinner is arrived to that degree of impudency, as without shame to
commit his iniquity in the face of heaven, and earth, and to that height of
insolence, as to despise the justice of God and men, then does the wrath of God
kindle as a fire, as a devouring fire, which brings a total consummation, for
patience too much provoked becomes fury; and although God be patient, long
suffering, very merciful, and endures the malice of perverse persons, yet
when the measure is full, then does he cast his vengeance abundantly upon the
proud, and presumptuous: there are some kind of natures so bad, that not
content to do all the evil, and wickedness they can devise think themselves
not fully satisfied, if they make not known unto others the pleasure, which
they take in acting their sin, yea they glory in their malice, if I have done
evil (says the impudent in the Scripture) what punishment has happened to me
for it. There are others, who being reprehended, and admonished, threaten to do
worse, and who like unto resty horses made more wayward by the spur, the more
their scandals, and reproaches are borne with, the worse, and more malicious
they become: it is for those that the milstones of Gods wrath grind late, but
when they come, they grind very small, and the grievousnesse of the torment is
augmented by the foreshewing of the punishment, in the example which I here
propose unto you, behold all these verities, as in a mirror.

In a city of our part of France the name whereof I will not now declare,
although I know it very well, A gentleman of the new impression, whom we will
call Opile, had made him notable, by geting some small victories in the wars,
with a company of Carabines which he commanbed, and with which he did 1000.
robberies, and outrages in the country. This man during the time of peace
seeing his sword hang by the wall, and the most part of his company cashiered,
betook himself to spend foolishly what he had so uniustly gotten together,
and this was in frequenting gaming houses, and lewd places, where he wallowed
himself in all manner of naughtiness: At last being fallen in love with a
Merchants wife, whom we will disguise under the name of Anaclete, he never
ceased, until by his importunities and devises he had brought this miserable
woman to condescend unto his will, and not content thus to defile his
neighbors bed by infamous adultery, as if one part of his licentiousness had
consisted, in the show of it, he boasted thereof in a most abominable, and
impudent manner, and in liew of hiding his filthiness, he labored by all
manner of ways to manifest it. Imagining that he should be counted for a brave
fellow, thus under a husbands nose to seduce his wife, and defile his bed.

The good Merchant more attentive in the care of his affairs then the
demeanure of his disloyal wife, either did not see, or at least would not
seem to see these disorders. As among virtues, continency bears the name of
honorable, so amongst vices licentiousness bears the title of dishonorable
and infamous, nothing in the world more diminishing the reputation. The small
sensibility that Anaclete showed in such an assent, exposed him not only unto
the laughter of his neighbors, but moreover unto the detraction of his ill
willers, who accused him of connivency, as if he had been confederate with his
wives lewdness.

This calumny being come to his ear, stung him so to the quick, that he
resolved to take away this infamy from his house, and to wash the stain thereof
in blood, but remembering himself, and considering that the honor of a wise
man depends not on the frailty of a sex so subject to infirmity, and besides
fearing the ruin of his fortune by murdering him, that had dishonored him,
he kept back his anger, and settled his mind to sufferance, and concealment,
but the bravadoes of the Captain, and the audaciousnesse of his wife grown
insolent by his timidity, the hooting of his neighbors, and the reproaches of
his kindred were unto his heart such pressing stings, that drawing strength out
of his weakness, and courage out of his natural pusillanimity, he protested
to avenge himself solemnly, if his wife abstained not from her evil courses,
and returned to her former duty, and respect which she owed to him, not daring
any more to meddle with the Captain, whose very name stopped his mouth, being
reported to be extreme hasty, and cruel, he instructed his wife with the best
admonitions he could frame, but seeing her in liew of profiting thereby, to
mock him for his pains, he was constrained to change accent, and taking a
harsher tone to come unto threats, whereat this female creature being netled
began to reply with bawling, and injurious terms, threatening that she would
have him cripled if he were so bold as once to strike her: Anaclete moved with
choler lifts up his hand, and makes so fair an impression therewith on her
cheek that the mark of his fingers remained there a good while printed by
reason of the blood which thereby mounted up to her face, adding moreover with
a solemn protestation soundly to curry both her, and her minion if ever he
found them talking together.

Eudoxe (let us call this woman) full of despite by such an affront resolved
with her self, to take deep vengeance thereof, neither wanted she means so to
do, having the sword of Opile at her command, but because this Captain
intended not to marry her, she desired not that he should go so far, as to
kill her husband, but only that by threats, and some blows he should keep him
in awe, having then made her complants unto him, and told him how Anaclete had
said, that if he found them together he would currie them both, Opile who was
not wont to be used in such a manner, promised to teach her husband to speak
in another fashion, and so severely to revenge the blow which she had received,
that she should have cause to be satisfied therewith.

Meeting on a time with this poor man he began to vent, and utter his
bravadoes against him, and to swear that if he continued in his fantastical
humors, he would hack, and hew him in so many pieces that the skilfullest
anatomatist should hardly set him together again. Anaclete answered him
coldly, that if he were of his profession, and had bin bred up in arms, he
would answer him in the same terms, but that the condition of a soldier,
and that of a merchant are not used to join together, the ell and the sword
being weapons far different, that the law of marriage gave him full authority
over his wife, whom he had forbidden to come in his company, to the end that
the evil reports might be wiped away which were spread abroad, to the
disadvantage of her honor; and that he believed, that there passed no
dishonest act in their conversation, but that an honest woman ought to be
exempt, both from the crime, and the suspicion, and that if his wife abusing
him with her tongue, he had made use of his hand to hold her peace, it was not
for Opile to think himself offended therewith, ^xcept he would show to have
some share in her, who no way, that he knew to be lawful, appertained to him.

From this answer, that might have satisfied any man that knew reason, Opile
took occasion to increase his choler, and passion, which made him like a tun
filled with new wine the which fowls it self with its own foame, because
that the rashness of the discourse made him utter many words, not only
outrageous against the person of Anaclete, but which plainly discovered, that
he sought to have more part in her, whose cause he defended, then either law,
or honesty could permit, which so hardly oppressed good Anaclete, that he was
constrained to reply, that if ever he saw him approach his wife, he would do
his endeavor to resist force by force, and to drive disgrace from his house.

Whereunto angry Opile replied like a soldier, if I were said he asleep in
thine own bed, thou would not dare to awake me, yet thou have said that
thou would currie both thy wife, and her minion (speaking of me) if thou
did find us together; but be thou sure that I will speak to her when it
shall please me in despite of thy threats, and foretidings, and since thou
have spoken of currying me, as if I were a horse, assure thy self that it
shall not be before I have well rubbed thee to my mind; and thereupon he lifts
up a great staff, wherewith he would have accompanied his words, but the legs
of Anaclet^ by a quick flight, saved him at that time from a basting.

The proud soldier boasted of this discomsiture, as if he had won the field,
but he sung the triumph before the victory, he continues his filthy action with
this wicked woman, more openly, and impudently then ever, but it will not be
without punishment. Lead is long ere it be hot, but then it melts on a sudden;
the Diamond is difficult to be broken, but when it does break, it goes all to
powder; so is it with slow, heavy, and timorous humors, they must have time to
increase their choler, and when it is at the height they are as red hot iron,
which long retains it is heat, Anaclete wronged beyond all measure, resolved to
end his dishonor, or his life, he makes his complaint to his kindred, and
friends, who all taking part in his misfortune, and hating the insolence of
Opile, promised to assist him in this revenge, being just, and authorized by
the laws.

Accompanied then with three or four good fellows, resolved to surprise the
adulterers, and to punish them as they deserved, it was an easy matter to find
them together: some few days before Anaclete intended to put in practice his
design, he fained a certain kind of reconcilement with his disloyal wife, he
makes extraordinary much of her, as if his former affections had renewed, but
they were Apes ^uggings, which smother with their imbracings, this woman grown
expert in deceits returns him the like, he faines a voyage whereunto he said
that his commerce obliged him, for to make provision of some certain wares at
a Fair, his wife counterfeits a sadness at his departure, where unto she
added a few Crocadiles tears; hardly was he gone, but Opile came to possess
his place, and that in a manner so openly that all the neighborhood was
scandalized thereat, two days after Anaclete returns, who accompanied by
four or five of his trusty friends all armed, as was fitting enters with false
keys even unto his own chamber, wherein they were no sooner entered, but the
adulterers, whom they found in bed together awakened, Opiles sword was seized
on, as also his poyniard, and pistol, he sees himself naked, and unable to
defend himself, among five or six men well armed, and every one his pistol
in hand ready charged, and cockt presenting them to his head, now stands our
braggard well amazed, and of a Lion that he had been, is now become as gentle
as a Sheep, and dares not bleate, they sease on him, and he is forthwith bound
hand and foot, and in this manner laid on the bed again, the woman on a sudden
awaking sees this spectacle, and presently her conscience expects nothing but
death, for her punishment, she cries, she weeps, she craves mercy for her
self, and Opile, in brief she plays the woman, a creature insolent in
prosperity, and faint hearted in misfortune. Opile asks Anaclete forgiveness
with the fairest protestations in the world, but Anaclete is wounded in his
honor, a wound that is not healed with words, and seeing his enemy now in his
power, caused one of his arms to be untyed, and putting a wispe of straw into
his hand, such as they use to rub horses withal; Opile (said he) thou have
threatened to rub me before I should curry thee, I will have thee to be as
good as thy word, therefore take this wispe, and rub me at thy pleasure.

Opile refusing so to do, Anaclete and those that accompanied him setting
poyniards and pistolls to his throat forced him to take the wispe, and pass it
over the back of Anaclete, which he did very gently, then they asked him if he
were contented therewith, and if he had rubd him well to his mind, you have
constrained me to it. (said he) And I will also constrain thee (replied
Anaclete) to let me curry thee at my will for it is now my turn.

Then they fastened this poor naked body to the four posts of the bed, as one
extended upon the wheel, and Anaclete taking an iron curry comb, which he had
caused to be made with long teeth, began to curry this gallant, so furiously,
that he flaid him alive, tearing away his nose, eyes, and all that made him a
man, in brief leaving no parcel of his skin untoucht, he stretches his good
wife on the same rack, and curryed her in the same manner, casting their
miserable bodies on the floor, which had neither face, nor skin, and left
them there panting, and wallowing in their blood, this exploit of cruel
vengeance thus acted, he retired himself into a place of safety.

Day being come the Magistrates enter the house where they behold this horrible
spectacle. These unfortunate creatures lived a while after to confess their
faults, and ask God forgiveness for them. Opile dyed before night, the woman
lived until the next day, both in torments, which can hardly be imagined. The
laws forgave Anaclete this murder, but because of the cruelty of the action,
he was constrained wholly to forsake the City, and to change his dwelling, ever
since it has remained, as a proverb in that place when they see any one
courting another man's wife, they bid him take heed of the curry-combe.

Certainly they are quite void of humanity, who detest not the cruelty of this
revenge, more worthy to be abhorred then imitated, and besides those laws,
which permits husbands to kill the adulterers when they surprise them, are
contrary unto the laws divine; nevertheless they were stoned to death in the
ancient law, providing that it were done in the way of public justice, and by
the ordinary course.

But who does not see in this history the just judgment of God on the
insolence of this soldier, and this dishonest woman. The punishment of a fault
seems the greater, yea redoubled, when as it is either shameful, or
ridiculous. And amongst delinquents whom justice sends to execution, there are
many that grieve more to suffer by the hands of the hangman, and to serve for a
spectacle to the people, then for the loss of their life. If those, who defile
themselves by adultery, had such curriers before their eyes, they would not
neigh (for to speak with the Scripture) as Stalions after their neighbors
wives.

THE WAKING Man's dream.
The Fifth Event.
THE Greek proverb says, that a man is but the dream of a shadow, or the
shadow of a dream; is there then any thing more vain then a shadow? which is
nothing in it self, being but a privation of light framed by the opposition of
a thick body unto a luminous: is there any thing more frivolous then a dream?
which has no subsistence but in the hollownesse of a sleeping brain, and
which to speak properly is nothing but a mere gathering together of
Chimericall Images: and this is it which makes an ancient say, that we are but
dust and shadow; our life is compared unto those, who sleeping dream that they
eat, and waking find themselves empty, and hungry? and who is he that does not
find this experimented in himself; as often as he revolves in his memory the
time which is past: who can in these passages of this world distinguish the
things which have been done, from those that have been dreamed? vanities,
delights, riches, pleasures, and all are past, and gone, are they not dreams?
what has our pride, and pomp availed us? say those poor miserable souls
shut up in the infernal prisons, where is our bravery become, and the glorious
show of our magnificence? all these things are passed like a flying shadow, or
as a post who hastens to his journeyes end. This is it which caused the ancient
Comicke Poet to say that the world was nothing but an universal Comedy,
because all the passages thereof serves but to make the wisest laugh, and
according to the opinion of Democritus all that is acted on this great Theater
of the whole world when it is ended differs in nothing from what has bin acted
on a Players stage; the mirror which I will here set before your eyes will so
lively express all these verities, and so truly show the vanities of the
greatness; and opulencies of the earth. That although in these Events I gather
not either examples not far distant from our times, or that have been
published by any other writer, yet I believe that the serious pleasantness of
this one will supply it is want of novelty, and that it is repetition will
neither be unfruitful nor unpleasing.

In the time that Phillip Duke of Burgundy (who by the gentleness, and
curteousnesse of his carriage purchaste the name of good) guided the reins of
the country of Flanders. This Prince who was of an humor pleasing, and full of
judicious goodness, rather then silly simplicity used pastimes, which for
their singularity are commonly called the pleasures of Princes: after this
manner he no less showed the quaintnsse of his wit, then his prudence.

Being in Bruxelles with all his Court, and having at his table discoursed
amply enough of the vanities, and greatness of this world, he let each one say
his pleasure on this subject, whereon was alleged grave sentences, and rare
examples; walking toward the evening in the Town, his head full of diverse
thoughts, he found a Tradesman lying in a corner sleeping very soundly, the
fumes of Bacchus having surcharged his brain. I describe this man's
drunkenness in as good manner as I can to the credit of the party. This vice
is so common in both the superior and inferior Germany, that diverse making
glory, and vaunting of their dexterity in this art, increase their praise
thereby, and hold it for a brave act. The good Duke to give his followers an
example of the vanity of all the magnificence with which he was environed,
devised a means far less dangerous, then that which Dionysius, the Tyrant
used toward Democles, and which in pleasantness bears a marve^lous utility.
He caused his men to carry away this sleeper, with whom as with a block they
might do what they would, without awaking him, he caused them to carry him
into one of the sumptuosest parts of his Palace, into a chamber most
state-like furnished, and makes them lay him in a rich bed. They presently
strip him of his bad clothes, and put him on a very fine, and clean shirt, in
stead of his own, which was foul and filthy, they let him sleep in that place
at his ease, and whilst he settles his drink, the Duke prepares the
pleasantest pastime that can be imagined.

In the morning this drunkard being awake, draws the curtains of this brave
rich bed, sees himself in a chamber adorned like a Paradise, he considers the
rich furnitvre with an amazement such as you may imagine, he believes not his
eyes but lays his fingers on them, and feeling them open, yet persuades
himself they are shut by sleep, and that all that he sees is but a pure dream.

As Soon as he was known to be awake, in comes the officers of the Dukes
house, who were instructed by the Duke what they should do, there were pages
bravely apparelled Gentlemen of the chamber, Gentleman waiters, and the High
Chamberlain, who all in fair order, and without laughing bring clothing for
this new guest, they honor him with the same great reverences, as if he were
a Sovereign Prince, they serve him bare-headed, and ask him what suite he
will please to wear that day.

This fellow affrighted at the first, believing these things to be enchantment,
or dreams, reclaimed by these submissions, took heart, and grew bold, and
setting a good face on the matter, chused amongst all the apparel that they
presented unto him, that which he liked best, and which he thought to be
fittest for him, he is accommodated like a King, and served with such
ceremonies, as he had never seen before, and yet beheld them without saying
any thing, and with an assured countenance. This done, the greatest Nobleman in
the Dukes Court enters the chamber with the same reverenee, and honor to him,
as if he had been their Sovereign Prince; ( Phillip with Princely delight
beholds this play from a private place) diverse of purpose petitioning him for
pardons, which he grants with such a countenance, and gravity, as if he had
had a Crown on his head all his life time.

Being risen late, and dinner time approaching, they asked him if he were
pleased to have the tables covered, he likes that very well; the table is
furnished, where he is set alone, and under a rich Canopie he eats with the
same ceremony, which was observed at the Dukes meals, he made good cheer, and
chawed with all his teeth, but only drank with more moderation, then he could
have wished, but the Majesty which he represented made him refrain.

All taken away, he was entertained with new, and pleasant things, they led him
to walk about the great Chambers, Galleries, and Gardens of the Palace (for
all this merriment was played within the gates they being shut only for
recreation to the Duke, and the principal of his Court) they showed him all
the richest, and most pleasantest things therein, and talked to him thereof, as
if they had all been his, which he heard with an attention, and contentment
beyond measure, not saying one word of his base condition, or declaring that
they took him for another: They made him pass the afternoon in all kind of
sports, music, dancing, and a Comedy spent some part of the time. They talked
to him of some State matters, whereunto he answered according to his skill, and
like a right Twelfetide King.

Super time approaching they ask this new created Prince, if he would please
to have the Lords, and Ladies of his Court to sup, and feast with him, whereat
he seemed something unwilling, as if he would not abase his dignity unto such
familiarity; nevertheless counterfeiting humanity, and affability, he made
signs, that he condiscended thereunto: he then toward night was led with
sound of Trumpets and Hoboyes into a fair hall, where long Tables were set,
which were presently covered with diverse sorts of dainty meats, the Torches
shined there in every corner, and made a day in the midst of a night: the
Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen were set in fine order, and the Prince at the upper
end in a higher seat: the service was magnificent; the music of voices and
instruments fed the ear whilst mouths found their food in the dishes, never
was the imaginary Duke at such a feast; carousses begin after the manner of the
Country; the Prince is assaulted on all sides, as the Owl is assaulted by all
the Birds, when he begins to soar: not to seem uncivil he would do the
like to his good, and faithful subjects; they serve him with very strong wine,
good Hipocras which he swallowed down in great draughts, and frequently
redoubled, so that charged with so many extraordinaryes, he yielded to deaths
cousin german sleep, which closed his eyes, stopped his ears, and made him loose
the use of reason, and all his other senses.

Then the right Duke, who had put himself among the throng of his Officers, to
have the pleasure of this mummery, commanded that this sleeping man should be
stripped out of his brave clothes, and clothed again in his old rags, and so
sleeping carried, and laid in the same place, where he was taken up the night
before, this was presently done, and there did he snort all the night long, not
taking any hurt either by the hardness of the stones, or the night air, so
well was his stomach filled with good preservatives.

Being awakened in the morning by some passenger, or it may be by some, that
the good Duke Philip had thereto appointed: ha, said he, my friends, what have
you done? you have robbed me of a Kingdom, and have taken me out of the
sweetest, and happiest dream, that ever man could have fallen into, then very
well remembering all the particulars of what had passed the day before, he
related unto them from point to point, all that had happened unto him, still
thinking it assuredly to be a dream, being returned home to his house, he
entertaines his wife, neighbors, and friends with this his dream, as he
thought, the truth whereof being at last published by the mouths of those
Courtiers, who had been present at this pleasant recreation, the good man
could not believe it, thinking that for sport they had framed this history,
upon his dream: but when Duke Phillip who would have the full contentment of
this pleasant trick, had showed him the bed, wherein he lay, the clothes,
which he had worn; the persons, who had served him; the Hall, wherein he had
eaten; the Gardens, and Galleries, wherein he had walked; hardly could he be
induced to believe what he saw, imagining that all this was mere enchantment,
and illusion.

The Duke used some liberality toward him for to help him in the poverty of
his family, and taking an occasion thereon to make an Oration unto his
Courtiers concerning the vanity of this worlds honors, he told them, that
all, that ambitious persons seek with so much industry, is but smoke, and a
mere dream, and that they are stricken with that pleasant folly of the
Athenian who imagined all the riches, that arrived by shipping in the haven of
Athens to be his, and that all the Merchants were but his Factors: his friends
getting him cured by a skillful Physician of the debility of his brain, in liew
of giving them thanks for this good office, he reviled them, saying that
whereas he was rich in conceit, they had by this cure made him poor, and
miserable in effect.

Harpaste a fool that Seneca^s wife kept, and whose pleasant imagination this
grave Philosopher does largely relate, being grown blind could not persuade
her self that she was so, but continually complained, that the house wherein
she dwelt was dark, that they would not open the windows, and that they
hindered her from setting light, to make her believe she could see nothing,
hereupon this great Stoic makes this fine consideration, that every vicious
man is like unto this fool, who although he be blind in his passion, yet
thinks not himself to be so, casting all his defect on false surmises, whereby
he seeks not only to have his sin worthy of excuse, and pardon, but even of
praise, the same say the covetous, ambitious, and voluptuous persons in defense
of their imperfections, but in fine (as the Psalmist says) all that must pass
away, and the images thereof come to nothing, as the dream of him that awaketh
from sleep.

If a bucket of water be as truly water, as all the sea, the difference only
remaining in the quantity, not in the quality, why shall we not say, that our
poor Brabander was a Sovereign Prince, for the space of four and ^^^enty
hours; being that he received all the honors, and commodities th^reof, how
many Kings, and (...) have not lasted longer, but have dyed (...) ^very day of
their Elections or Coronations? A^ for those other pompes, which have lasted
longer, what are they else, but longer dreams? This vanity of worldly things
is a great sting to a well composed soul to help it forward toward the
heavenly kin^dome.

THE OLD MAN passionate in Love.
The Sixth Event.
IT is a thing seldom seen for old men to go to war, much less to become
amorous. Mars, and Venus (two deityes spoken of by the Poets) are
irreconcileably angry with old men, because they are dismissed, as it were,
from their service, I grant there are many courageous old men, but when
strength fails, whereto serves courage? As there are white Swannes which draw
the Chariot of the Goddess of Cyprus, so there are likewise old men, who enter
into passions scarce pardonable in those that are young: but if in deeds of
arms these men commit many faults; what follies do they not commit, when this
abortive called love makes them grow childish again; how many dangerous
fooleries this frenzy was cause of in the person of an old man, you may behold
in the sequel of this History.

In a City of one part of France, one of these which are seated on the river of
Rosne (I will not otherwise specify it) a man of threescore (whose years ere
then might have read him a good, and authentical lesson of coldness, and
temperance) tenderly, and quietly brought up his children, which he had had by
his wife deceased some years past, they were two sons reasonable big, and two
daughters more then marriageable, his family, and household affairs went
forward in good manner, when this little hobgoblin to whom Poets attribute a
bow, quiver, wings, and torches, came, and cast into his bones an artificial
fire which laid hold on his Ice, and showed that there may be some few sparks
of fire among the ashes, and the flame is never so quick, as in drie-wood;
there were not far from him certain children, that were orphants, but children
(at least the males) able enough to govern their estate, they were two young
brothers whom necessity kept united together, because if they should part their
stock, either of them could scarce live on his part, they had one sister of
reasonable age, and sufficient to perform their huswifery* they lived thus in
good fashion, partly by their industry* partly by their means. That we may
speak more clearly, and to avoid confusion we will name the old man Sostene,
the two brothers T^bere, and Willerme, and their sister Eufronie. This maid
having been well instructed by her deceased mother in all manner of needle
works, was become very expert therein, and taught them unto other maids and
children with great dexterity; Sostene having daughters, who desired to perfect
themselves in these occupations so beseeming their sex, very often called
Eufrony unto them, who taught them most part of her skill, with a great deal
of grace, and sincerity: she was fair, but never the less virtuous, and this
virtue was accompanied with such a quickness of wit, that her conversation was
well thought on by every one. The good old man Sostene never thought of the
treason wrought against him, by that little aforesaid spirit, who lay in
ambuscado in the eyes of Eufronie.

During the long winters nights, she spent the best part of the evening with
the three daughters of Sostene, which, with two sons he had by his former
wife, the good old man sitting in the chimney corner in his furred gown, took
great pleasure in hearing the tales that these wenches told, whilst they were
at their work, and the songs which they sung, and other such pleasantness,
yet all within the limits of honesty, and virtue, but in all these things, as
well, as in the works Eufronie excelled, and was as Diana amongst her nimphs.
By degrees (for fire requires time to melt ice, and then to make the water
boil which comes of it) the actions, the countenance, the speeches of Eufronie
delighted him, the features likewise of her face, her smiles, her looks, and
her other graces imprinted themselves on his heart, so that he desired she
might always accompany his daughters, and he amongst them* a fair, not
golden, but silver locked Apollo amidst the Muses, he became very impatient
within himself when Eufronie came not: and when the care of her house or the
service of her brothers retained her from thence, he was so sad, and so froward
that nothing could content him; to imagine the cause of this his humor was a
hard matter, for it might better have been attributed to his age, then any
passion.

In fine (not to insist too long on this old man's dotage) after some few days,
himself having handled his wound, and found the shaft entered so deep into his
heart, that he could not possibly get it out, he resolves with him self to
seek the remedy in the subject of his smart, and attempt this Danaes Tower by
Jupiters golden shower: had his thought aimed at marriage, although Hymen were
out of season for him, yet had there been cause wherewith to justify his
design, and perhaps so many disorders might not have happened thereby, but God
Almighty by his just judgment permitted him to fall into the snares, which he
prepared to entrap the honesty of Eufronie. To tell you in what manner he
declared to her the torment he suffered for her sake, and the repugnancies he
endured in revealing unto her his shameful pretentions, are things which I
know not, and if I did know them, yet I should be loath to foul my paper with
such filthy proceedings. But at length Eufronie perceiving this old fire brand
meant to consume her chastity, rather then to consummate a lawful marriage,
she carried the matter very wisely, and warily, advertising her brothers of the
passion that this old man had discovered unto her, entreating them to invent
some special pretense thereby to keep her any more from going to that house,
where her presence did but only cast oil into a fire which could not be
quenched but with her absence.

Tibere, and Willerme took another way all that their sister had said, and
subtle, and crafty as they were thought this a good occasion well to advance
their sister, and their own affairs. They therefore first commended her for
imparting unto them what had passed, and withal told her that they were not
willing, that she should absent her self thereby to quench this fire, but
rather to augment it by her presence, and change it into a lawful desire of
marriage, a thing as they showed her might easily be done, if she could guide
this her design with discretion.

She who totally relied on her brothers, whom she knew wished nothing so much
as her good, and besides (a natural thing) being desirous of her own
advancement, and giving credence unto their persuasions, behaved her self so
discreetly toward Sostene, that she reduced his flame to such a period, as it
could not long endure without possessing her: nothing causes so much love as
honesty, whereby she wholly conquered him, letting him know, that she made more
account of her honor, then of all the large proffers, that he made her, yea or
of all the wealth in the world, and that the only means to win her was to
marry her, where unto she was content (notwithstanding the great disparity of
their ages) if her brothers would like thereof.

The old man, in whom love on the one side, and shame on the other, wrought an
unspeakable trouble, desired all, yet feared all, he desired to marry her, that
he might possess her more at ease, but he feared the speeches of the world,
and more the discontent of his children, and trouble of his family: yet of two
evils he endeavors to choose the least, and that it is better to marry then
consume in that manner, his pleasures seem dearer, and stick closer to him,
then the speech of people, but then coming again to himself, and considering,
how this would be the next way to cast him into his grave, an^ to make a
ridiculous upshot of his life, he recalled himself; poor reed, poor beaten bark
tossed by contrary winds, he seeks many remedies in these extremities, but
finds none, he at last believes, that a clandestine, a secret marriage may
satisfy his appetite, and yet preserve his credit, he proposed it unto
Eufrony, and she unto her brothers, who caring not which way this Boar might
run into their toils, counseled her to take of the old man a promise of
marriage. Sostene gave it her presently, thinking this writing would suffice to
get him possession of this maid, but she, who would not permit him to have
access unto her but through the Church gate, declared freely that she would
never be his but by marriage.

Then did he in the house of Eufrony in the presence of her brothers, and some
others of their kindred take her for his wife, and received the nuptial
blessing, which put him in possession of that he had so much desired, to his no
small joy, but when this was done he found it impossible to conceal his fire
that now had rather augmented by enjoying her, then been quenched, he must
have Eufrony always in his house, and cannot endure to be one minute from
her, but at length he behaved himself so with her, that the dullest in all
the house might perceive therein so extraordinary a passion in the old man,
that it must needs be, that she is either his wife, or worse. Eufrony upon this
grew something jealous of her honor, so that she could not brook these bad
censures, and therefore urged her husband incessantly to declare their
marriage, and as a woman she sometimes cast out words whereby Sostenes children
might perceive that either she was their mother in law already, or at least
intended to be, which put a f^ea into their ears. Eufrony takes upon her such
authority in the house of Sosten^, and is there so frequently, that this old
man having no more shift to veil what he had hitherto endeavored to conceal,
declared unto his children that she was his wife, and that he intended they
should honor her as their mother in law.

This made them as melancholy, and discontent, as the brothers of Eufrony were
glad in seeing their counsel take so good, and happy effect, whereby they were
become brothers in law in the house of Sostene, from whence they drew great
helps in their necessities, which the more augmented the envy, and jealousy
of his children, and bred in them a desperate rage. Taddee, and Androgeo sons
of Sostene, being of opinion that these persons took, as it were, the very
bread out of their mouths, and that their sister was likely to swallow up a
great part of their inheritance, consulted which way they might seek to be
revenged. In the end they saw plainly how Eufrony in her dealings (which they
counted for no other but a mere cheat) had followed the counsel of her
brothers, who had so subtly advised her in the weaving her web, wherein the
old man had been caught, whereupon presently enters their minds thoughts of
vengeance, and as they thought themselves to be over-reacht by subtilty, so
they resolved to murder treacherously, both the two brothers, and also the
Stepmother; an enterprise both execrable, and dishonorable.

Hereupon having associated themselves with some of their acquaintance, as bad
minded, as themselves, they furiously assaulted the two brethren unawares, as
they were returning from Sostenes house to their own, which (as you have
heard) was not far from thence. The two brothers little amazed at this storm
stood close together, and getting to a wall stood in their defense crying out
help, and murder, this noise stirred all the neighborhood, who found them
hurt in diverse places, and defending themselves courageously, for what they
received they repayed the assaylants manfully, for two were hurt, and Taddee
wounded mortally.

The assaylants seeing much people come to help, fearing to be surprised in so
manifest an assault, and riot, betook themselves to flight, excepting Taddee,
who lay on the ground, and one more hurt in the thigh, who could not escape,
hardly was this miserable Taddee brought to his fathers house, but that having
confessed his fault, and asked pardon of God, and of his father, he dyed within
two hours after; Tibere, and Willerme, are discharged by Taddees confession,
and held for innocent, being that only in their own defense, and without any
other design they had committed this murder.

Androgeo absented himself for a time, but by change of air he changed not
his evil manners, nor the malice he conceived against the two brothers of his
Stepmother, but on the contrary being doubly animated by the death of his
brother, and thinking it a dishonor, if he revenged it not, he resolved to
dispatch them, to take them both together he had at his own cost experienced
how dangerous it was, therefore he determined with his accomplices to take them
asunder, and rid them one after the other.

Returning back secretly into the City, and having diverse times watched his
adversaries, he at length met with Willerme going alone in the street,
thinking on nothing less then on the misfortune which happened unto him, for
he lost his life, having not so much time as to lay hand on his sword, it was
by a pistol shot, wherewith Androgeo hit him in the head, and dashed his
brains about the pavement, an infamous act* unworthy not only of a Christian
bu^ of any man that has never so little honor before his eyes; upon this he
betakes himself to flight, thereby to save himself; for had he fallen thereby
to save himself; for had he fallen into the hands of justice, nothing could
have prevailed toward the saving of his life, pardons being never granted for
such deeds, notwithstanding it was presently known, that he was the man that
had done this filthy action, whereof Sostene was no less sorrowful than his
new wife for the loss of her brother.

The other brother which was Tibere swears by all the Stars that Heaven
contains, he will be righted either by way of justice or by force, the blood
of his brother calling on him daily to seek revenge: but time the Physician of
all the wounds of the mind moderated a little his fury, so that he slackned
the pursuit of justice.

Sostene deprived of his eldest son by death, and his other son by exile,
sees now, though too late, that his indiscreete passion, and unseasonable love
were the grounds of all these mischiefs, yet will he not cast the helve after
the hatchet, nor let that spark of his race go out which only remained in
Androgeo, and to conjure this tempest he makes use of his wifes wit, who
moderated the boiling anger of her brother, and in fine, for his better
satisfaction Sostene gave him his eldest daughter in marriage, with such a
competent portion that Tibere had no reason to think ill of any thing that had
past, all matters where hereupon accommodated, and mercy taking the place of
justice, Androgeo by an abolishment of his former malice reenters into his
estate.

But what agreement soever was made, it was never possible to reunite the
divided hearts of these two brothers in law, nether the alliance by their two
sisters, nor the thought of the misery past, nether the entreaties of friends,
nor the tears of the poor old man, could ever recall the fury of Androgeo, he
looks awry, sowrely, and doggedly at Willerme, who seeing this could not but
do as much, for being no less haughty minded than he, by the like despisalls
he mocked his arrogance, from these lightnings of looks proceeded thunders of
threats, and from the thunder of words, tempests ofdeeds.

For behold in midday, meeting in open street, they quarrel, draw, and
Willerme receiving a hurt in the shoulder, repaid Androgeo with two others, the
second whereof laid him dead on the ground, although this was done by
encounter, in combat^, and in heat of blood, yet Willerme got away, choosing
rather to justify himself a far off, then near. Imagine now the poor old
man's sorrows, when he beheld his last son lie wallowing in blood, and dead
before his eyes, and moreover killed by him that was his brother in law, and son
in law.

Let us leave his tears, and despaires, as a disease contagious, because
perhaps his grief may pass into those, who have the reading of these lines
more for recreation, then to procure pensivenes, he now sees himself without
heirs male, and his inheritance like to pass into the hands of strangers, yea
even of those who are imbrued in the blood of his children! O what a heart
breaking was this; too late did the scales fall from his eyes, whereby he saw,
and felt that his foolish love had been the spring, and original of all these
deplorable Events, at length being cast down with languor, and overwhelmed in
sorrow, and discontent, a sickness seized on him, which in few days laid him
in his grave, whereunto this grief accompanied him, to see all his house
turned topsie turvie (as we may say) his estate disordered, his second wife
taking what she could get, his two younger daughters unprovided, his sons
killd, and his eldest daughter married unto a fugitive.

O old men learn hereby to overcome, and moderate your doting passions, and
endeavor to become so prudent, and wary, as to avoid any occasion which may
induce such fooleries, both dishonouring you, shortning your life, and hastening
your body into the grave, trust not too much unto the Snow of your head, the
Ice of your blood, nor the coldness of your stomach. The flesh is a
domestical enemy, which cease not to molest us until death. The flesh is
that enemy who lies in ambush for the heel (that is to say) to the
extremities of our life, so long as one breath is in our lips, so long there is
a spark of that fire still in our bones* moreover it is a very ridiculous
thing, and no ways pardonable to see an old man foolishly passionate, and who
thinks of a marriage bed, when he had more need think on his grave.

THE GOOD FORTUNE. OF HONESTY.
The Seventh Event.
THE Romans in times past built two Temples, the one they consecrated to
Honor, the other to Virtue. These were so joined, and contrived together, that
none could enter the former, but they must go through the latter, this served
as an Emblem to show that there can be no progress to honor but by virtue.
And that glory is a perfume fit to smoke no where but before the Altar of
virtue, and indeed do but mark what clear luster, and bright sparkling you
see in a Diamond, or what light comes from a great fire, the same is honor in
virtuous actions, which are of themselves so resplendent, that they produce
rays of esteem, and praise, to reflect on those, out of whom they issue. The
Psalmist goes further, and will not only have glory to accompany the just man,
but also riches to enter into his house, and to remain there, from age, to age
in his posterity; so that if the ancients had had any knowledge of this
doctrine, they would surely have added a third Temple unto the two former, which
they would have dedicated unto good hap, or good fortune, which should have
been entered through that of honor, for there is no doubt to be made but that
felicity does necessarily, as a shadow, follow the solid body of virtue, and
honesty; since that to be virtuous, and honorable is the highest point of
felicity, whereunto an honest man can aspire: and although virtue be unto it
self a more then sufficient recompense, he being unworthy thereof that seeks
rewards for it, any where but in it self, for the greatest price of virtuous
actions is to have done them; yet so it is that accessarily, sooner, or later,
either in this world, or in the next, the acknowledgement thereof cannot fail,
for Gods goodness, and justice is such, that he will render every man
according to his works. It is true that ordinarily fortune seems an enemy to
virtue, prodigally bestowing her favors not only upon the unworthy, but most
commonly upon vicious persons, so that recompense flying from desert, it seems
that by virtues contrary one may arrive soonest to prosperity. But let us
consult with the said Scriptures, and we shall find that these felicities of
the wicked pass soon away, as the wind and smoke, or as the leaf of a tree.
And that he, who was yesterday exalted as high as the Cedars of Lebanon, to day
is no more then, yea not so much as a low shrub of the field, not the least
image of his greatness appears to them that seek after him, whereas the
virtuous man is happy even in the greatest mishap, his virtues growing more,
and more perfect in adversity, and in fine drawing profit out of his harms,
and l^ss^s, he constraines fortune to do him homage, and to become tributary
unto his merit. And to say the truth amongst the humane Events, which I
carefully observe, I always have a special attention, and a particular regard
unto those, wherein I see virtue triumphant over fortune. Neither are there any
pictures, which more delight me, nor about which I more willingly apply my
pensill in the delineation then those which represent fortune at the feet of
virtue. It is most certain and assured by holy writ, as I have before showed
you, that either in this life or in the next no virtuous action shall pass
unrewarded, since an account is kept thereof, even to a glass of cold water,
like as vicious acts shall be punished, even to idle words. And whereas here I
set the good fortune of honor, or honesty which will appear in this history
which I am preparing for your view, wherein I study to accommodate my self to
the clear seeing eyes of the vulgar, who esteem felicity, as pieces of Gold,
which weighes most (that is to say) when they are most material, and sensible,
not making any account of the spiritual so much the more worthy estimation, as
the soul is more worthy then the body, and the body then the clothing: and
moreover, to say the truth, it is in this our age a singular thing, and worthy
admiration to see virtue accompanied with good fortune, yea a remarkable
rariety, and as it were a kind of monster; I have extended my self more then I
intended, but the merit of the subject has driven me thereunto, and I will
confirm it in this History, which I shall make so much the shorter, that I may
not pass the limits of brevity, in which I study to contain my self in all
these my Events.

The vanity of Spaniards is so great, that all their grandes think themselves
Princes, by reason whereof they call their lands and Lordships their states, as
if they were Sovereigns, from thence grows the proverb among them, that
grandes in Spain are little Kings in in their demaines, and indeed diverse of
them have some reason three fore being descended from those royal houses of
Arragon, of Valence, of Leon, of Navarre, as much, as what we call Provinces in
France, are kingdoms in Spain, whereunto may be added their Dukes and others
to whom they attribute great titles who have some image of Sovereignty in their
jurisdictions, because in criminal causes, there is no appeal from the
judgment of their Courts, and as for civil matters they may judge without
appeal, also to a certain period limited them. This I speak thereby to show the
absolute power they have over their subjects, with which they bear great
authority amongst those people that are under their jurisdictions; and this
power will serve as a ground, and foundation unto what I shall represent.

In Arragon one of those whom they call titled (I am not certain whether he
were of the number of the grandes, or no) lived in his Marquisate with the
aforesaid power, and authority, no less feared by his vassalls for his humor
both Arragonian and arrogant, then beloved for his magnificence and liberality;
which pierced the eyes of the people and made him commendable. And because his
daily care was, that the poor should be assisted, and helped with his means,
which was exceeding much, whether it were to the end to maintain his credit,
and reputation, or through charity, which I had rather believe, it cannot be
expressed in what good esteem he lived. He had been married, but his wife
dyed in childbed having lived with him but three, or four years, and had left
him but one son for a pledge of their love: living in this his widdowhood as
a man that aspired to other nuptials, and who would not spend the rest of his
days in melancholy, no wonder if he were assaulted by those soft temptations:
whilst he expected fortune to offer him a second match, like unto that which
death had taken from him, and conformable to his estate and birth. In this ease
and idleness of life gorged with wealth, he was hit (as the Elephant of
Antiochus) in that part of him which was weakest.

Those that call incontinency the sin of great persons, do ground themselves
upon the proverb which says, sine Cerere and Baecho friget Venus, Ceres, and
Bacchus are harbingers to the goddess Venus. Amidst the honors and pleasures
wherein he lived, it had bin a wonder if voluptuousness should not have
presented it self unto him, and filled his mind with illusions, and his soul
with sundry desires. Seeking then a subject to appease his concupiscence he
casts his eye on a maid, that was one of his subjects, she was poor in worldly
wealth, but so rich in honesty, and honor, that her chastity triumphed over
bad fortune, and left her good hap even unto her posterity: her poverty made
the Marquess imagine the conquest to be easy, according to the words of that
ancient, who says, that some courages are driven unto dishonorable acts
through necessity, who otherwise would never stoop thereunto; yet he found in
this creature an exception unto that maxim of Alexander the greats Father, who
boasted to make a Mule laden with gold, enter into any Fortress whatsoever.
Ctesiphon (so will we call this Lord) wanted not some to second him in his bad
design, great persons find but too many furtherers of their pleasures, and
unruly passions, but all his Engineers lost their labor, with all their
subtilties, and skill, and shamefully returning acknowledged all their
stratagems to be vain, against a Fortress so impregnable.

These difficulties were so far from sl^ckning or abating the ardor of
Ctesiphon, that contrariwise it animated it the more, imagining that nothing
was impossible unto him in those places, where he had authority, and that all
was lawful that pleased his humor. Heraclee wis^, and virtuous, shutting her
ears unto their infamous Ambassadors, her eyes unto the letters which
Ctesiphon writ her, and her hands unto those great presents wherewith he
thought to dazzle her, did what in like occasions honest maids ought to do, she
advertised her mother thereof, who glorying in her poverty, highly commended
her daugher for practicing so well the instructions of virtue, which she had
given her, further encouraging her rather to dye with honor on her brow, then
to live with infamy; no doubt but she had made some stir in this business,
had not the authority, and power of the Marquess stopped her mouth, who was Lord
of the place where she dwelt, but when Ctesiphons wicked sollicitors saw their
labor lost with Heraclee, they then addressed themselves to the mother, who
poor woman, what did she say unto them? or rather what did she not say unto
them?

Yet would they not be repulsed, imagining that this old woman intended to
raise the price of her ware, so that how loud soever she spak moved with anger,
they spoke yet louder, promising her mountains of gold; they told her that it
would be the way richly to match her daughter, for whose portion, in the name
of Ctesiphon they promised, and proffered four thousand French Crowns, but
full ill did they know the heart of Anastacie, who for all the Indian fleet
would not have committed so base a sale.

Seeing their battery could not prevail against these two Fortresses, they
turn it to another side; and addressed themselves unto a kinswoman of
Anastaces, whom they found more tractable to their will, they blinded her with
the powder of gold, which they blew into her eyes, and plotted with her a
notorious piece of villainy.

Mean time Ctesiphon not able to hide his fire, took walks, night and day
about the place where the prey was which he desired, seeking to feed his eyes
with the sight of this fair image, which swimmed in his fantasy, the City
soon talked of this business, and every one spoke thereof according to their
opinions, some excused his youth, others accused his want of judgment, and
those that had daughters marriageable, cried out on him for tyranny; mothers
hid their daughters, as hens, do their chickens, who gather them under their
wings, when they see the Kite, yet so it is that Ctesiphon, lost many a stay to
small purpose, exposing his reputation to the pillage of every man's tongue; on
the contrary Heraclee was commended beyond all measure, when it was known,
that she, and her mother opposed themselves so generously against the filthy
lust of the Marquess, who (being not able to purchase what he labored for,
but by deceit) had recourse unto the foresaid treacherous kinswoman, to whose
house Heraclee did sometimes go, to work with the daughters of her, who so
basely endeavored to betray her, this wicked woman promised Ctesiphon to put
him where he should be alone with this maid, leaving the rest unto himself to
treat. As she promised, so she p^rformed, for on a day as Heraclee was at her
work with her sellowes, this filthy woman having called them away one after
the other, in comes the Marquess with the countenance of a lover, who feels
himself near his conquest, at this sight Heraclee became colder then marble,
and all her blood being retired to her heart, Roses left their places unto
Lillies, and her face became pale, and wanne, like as it were dead. The
Marquess begins to flatter her, and as he that would as well enjoy the will of
the heart, as the pleasures of the body, knowing how distasteful those
enjoyings are, which be forced, and how execrable are ravishings, protests unto
her that he is not come to force, constrain, or use any violence toward her,
but only to speak his mind freely, and make her understand what she should not
hear by those whom he had sent unto her, nor read in the letters he had
written her, and being a crafty Courtler he so sugared his speeches, and
displayed all the Rhetoric which his passion suggested unto him, for to
persuade Heraclee, that what he sought of her would turn to her advancement,
and no way to the prejudice of her honor, I need not fill this paper with his
deceitful discourses.

Heraclee, who well saw that the devil spoke by the mouth of this man, and
that it was not fit she should delay him with fair words, holding a pair of
sheeres hidden in her hand, said unto him with an assured voice, which
testified her courage. my Lord, I do not believe that a man of your birth, and
quality would commit an act so base as to ravish a poor maid, but if passion
should blind you so far, I know the way to prevent this violence by my death,
and for as much as I am sure it is some features that you have observed in my
face, which leads you to desire my ruin, I am willing before you to sacrifice
them to mine honor, and to the health of my soul.

And at the same instant, as she was speaking these words, she thrust the
points of her sheeres into two or three places of her face, which she would
have quite disfigured, if Ctesiphon laying quick hold of her arm, had not
stayed the stroke presently the blood that came forth with the horridness of
the wounds maid her so hideous, that the Marquess, who needed no other
Antidote for his love, cried out, help, help, this generous maid thinking he
called his men to aid him for to ravish her, had already laid hold ou a knife
which hung at her side, and was even striking it into her heart, if she had
not seen her kinswoman, and her daughters enter the room, who found her in the
aforesaid pitiful case as you have heard.

The Marquess to get out of the confusion, and to avoid the tumult (after he
had left one of his men to take order for the curing of this maid) retired to
his Castle with the rest of his followers, the wounds were found to be such,
that the Surgeons promised so to heal them, as the marks should scarce
appear, but God knows what cause of talk this heroycall act gave unto all the
country far and near.

Ctesiphon for to justify himself of the reports, that went, how he would
have ravished Heraclee, caused a declaration to be published, wherein confessing
his passion he showed himself to be free from that design of violence, and
whether it were to amend his fault or to repair the breach which calumny had
made in his reputation, or whether touched with a defire to acknowledge so
great a virtue, he sent unto Heraclee the double of that portion which he had
before caused to be proffered unto her, when he labored to win her to his
will, but here behold another great act of this maids virtuous mind, she
refused this money, for fear lest it should be thought to be the shameful
price of her integrity. At length the Marquess caused her to be married unto
one of his officers, who received this portion from the hand of his Lord, and
also a maid who with a little blemish, but a glorious blemish of her former
beauty, brought him virtues far more worthy estimation.

This is yet but the first Trophe of Heraclees victory over fortune, there is
another far beyond this, which you shall see in the sequel of this history.
Not long after the Marquess entered again into wedlock, marrying a Catalonian
Gentlewomen of a great, and illustrious house, she being come into the house of
Ctesiphon, could not long be ignorant of the history of chaste Heraclee, whose
husband, as officer to the Marquess, was commonly with his Lord, his wife also
was often there to do her duty to her Lady, this face whose honorable marks
made themselves as remarkable as her beauty which made her commendable, became
suspected by the Marchioness, who seeing her self not so well advantaged by
nature, as this fair subject, feared lest the former flames of Ctesiphon
should rekindle at the presence of this object; i^ fine (not to extend my self
in this relation) she became jealous, and gave such evident signs thereof,
that it was perceived by the Marquess, who knowing himself clear from any
such thought, was willing to augment these thoughts in his wifes head, taking a
delight to see her in this pleasant humor, and would always seem more merry,
and jocond near Heraclee then he was wont, by this his behavior, increasing
the suspicions of Anastacy (so was the Marchioness called) he brought upon her
such a melancholy, that he had much ado to dissuade her from the thought of
what he was not; she proceeded so far, one day, that she endeavored to drive
Heraclee out of her Castle, and to forbid her the entrance thereof, with bitter
threats, and injurious words, as far wide from truth, as she was full of
passion. Heraclee suffered all this with an incredible patience, and modesty,
knowing that in remitting vengance to the power, and will of Almighty God, he
would at lenght, repay it, in more exemplary manner then she her self was
able; during this her disgrace she made her husband the father of diverse fine
children, amongst the rest of one daughter unto whom heaven had rendered with
interest the beauty which Heraclee had sacrificed to the preservation of her
chastity. The Marchioness had children also, but she could never bring up any
of them save one daughter.

At last her suspicions dispersed themselves, and she knew that she had done
Heraclee wrong, in conceiving so many bad thoughts of honesty, and in sign of
the pacifying of her wrath, she took unto her the eldest daughter of Heraclee,
which was but a child, for to keep company with her in those sports, and
plays, which are ordinary amongst children. This little child, whose name was
Patacule, had so many springing graces appearing in her face, that she promised
ere long to be a Paragon of beauty, whereunto if you add her fine wit, and
wonderful modesty, you shall find her full perfection; I have already showed
you that Ctesiphon had a son of his first marriage, named Sabinian who was
but three or four years elder then Patacule, being then brought up together,
this young Marquisin addicted himself so extremely by delight unto the
humors of Patacule, that he loved her by sympathy, ere he knew what love was;
wonderfully was the love of these two children talked of, for Patacule had no
less inclination to him, then he to her, and Ctesiphon calling to mind his
former passions took an extreme delight to consider the reciprocal motions
of these two innocent minds.

Their love increased with there age, until such time as malice opening their
eyes, they became more reserved in their entertainments, at last knowledge
being grown in them, they must be severed, according to the rigorous laws of
the Country. Sabinian was by his Father sent unto the Court, as well to learn
Court fashions, as also to make himself known, and Patacule remained in the
service of the Marchioness. He was bred up as Page unto Philip the second
whose death is so uncertainly spoken of, and in short time he purchased many
friends, and great credit there, and among other great favors he obtained a
Cross of Calatrane, which afterward got him a command of much revenue: He came
often to Arragon to see his father, who loving him as his only son, and
heir, rejoiced infinitely to see him grow so well in virtue, and reputation.

The first impression in the heart is a great matter: so many fair faces, so
many licentious companies, which are at Madrid could not blot out of his
imagination the Idea of his Patacule, he still persevered in good will to her,
but this was guided with so much discretion, and dissimulation, that the father
could not observe therein, any more then a common, and well-beseeming courtesy.

Going, and coming thus from his fathers house to the Court, and being at
Madrid he received the unwelcome news of his fathers extreme sickness,
whereupon he presently takes post, but he could not get home soon enough to
see him alive, he was not then above two or three and twenty years old when he
lost his father, after which he passed some years in his house, being their
retained by the care of his domestical affairs, in the managing whereof he
showed himself as frugall a husband, as his father had been a great spender,
yet not prodigal, every one wished him a wife fitting his estate, and quality,
for his perfect establishment: but the love of Patacule had rooted it self so
de^pe in his heart, and his soul was so filled with this object, that there
was no place void for any other, he loved her, sought her in marriage, and
what resistance soever both she, and her mother Heraclee made unto this match,
seeing the extreme unequality thereof, what oppositions soever his kindred
showed, what counsel soever his friends gave him, to divert him from it, how
terribly soever the Marchioness his mother in law stormed, being not able to
yield that she who had bin her servant, should be her fellow, and that she, who
had served her daughter should be wife unto her son in law, and heir of all,
yet never would he give over this his intent, but more, and more, regarding the
virtues of Patacule then riches, and nobility, he married her, and set her at
his side.

The Dowager Anastacy being not able to endure this, intended to retire her
self into Catalognia to her friends there, which Sabinian was willing unto,
except she would rather make choice of some other of the lands, which
appertained unto him, and thither retire her self, and live on her dowry, this
proffer she accepted, and taking her daughter, whom she meant to bring up with
her, away she went. Then Saebinian took the husband of Heraclee into his
house, who from his fathers officer was become his father in law, and put in
his custody all his affairs, he gave also unto Heraclee his mother in law, the
guide, and conduct of all his house reserving no other care unto himself but
to pass his time in hunting, and other pleasures with his fair, and virtuous
wife. Thus did Heraclee see her go forth of the Castle, that had formerly
driven her forth thereat, and she entered the place of government, and managing
of all the young Marquesses estate. He advanced his father in law, and all the
children of Heraclee. Patacule brought him five children, which were the
survivers of his name, and possessors of his estate: O how fair and
illustrious is the race of chaste and honorable persons, the memory whereof
shall last for ever.

Thus you may see how great a good it is, to be enrolled under the Standard, or
Ensign of virtue, for on that side the victory cannot be doubted of. Behold
unto what height of good fortune she has elevated the honesty and constancy of
Heraclee, and then cry out with the Psalmist, O Lord thou will not deprive them
of any good, that walk before thee in innocence, and righteousness, but on
the contrary thou will heap blessings on them abundantly. O God of virtues
how happy is that soul that places all it is hope, and confidence in thee
alone.

THE GENEROUS FRIEND.
The Eight Event.
IF that a man spend all that he have, that is to say all the goods that
fortune has lent him, in expressing his love to his friend, he will esteem it
as nothing, providing that his friendship be true, but when he comes so far
as to expose himself to an assured death for a friend, this is the highest
point whereunto friendship can reach, well do we see daily the rage of Duells,
which diminishes the fairest, and noblest blood of France, where friends
expose their lives to the hazard of combat in maintaining the quarrels of
those they love, the hope also to remain victorious, and have a share in the
honor of arms, makes them the bolder in these enterprises; but in cold blood
to present himself to an undoubted death for a friend, is a thing so rarely
seen, that antiquity furnishes us with no example thereof, but that of
Pillades, and Orestes, and Poets tell with admiration Castor his sharing of
immortality with his brother Pollux. And yet one of our French Historians in
his description of Polonia relates the memorable example of a generous
friendship which preserved the life of both the friends, who eagerly contended
to die each for other. The singularity of this Event has made me place it
here, with few ornaments, or addition of fine words, the splendour of the action
setting it self out sufficiently with it is own beauty.

Octavian, and Leobell, two young Gentlemen of Lithuania, in their tendrest
youth had such an inclination each to other, that by these beginnings it was
judged, that if their friendship increased with their age it would attain unto
such a degree of perfection, which would dim the luster of those* that
ancient historians do highly commend unto us. Their parents were good friends,
and neighbors, dwelling in the same City of Vilne the principal of Lithuania,
but their friendship was common and vulgar in comparison of that of their
children whereof they rejoiced, leaving them at their own liberty to improve
it by their familiar conversation; this ordinary frequentation bred in their
minds such a mutual correspondency that their wills seemed to be one, and that
both h^d but one soul parted into two bodies, they had not any the least
thought from each other, and no sooner had the one any design just, and
reasonable, but the other would profer him his assistance therein, and if he
thought it not lawful he labored to turn him from it, which the other would
not refuse to do, as well for the love of virtue, (which was the cement, or
gluten of their friendship) as for fear of grieving his friend who thus
brought him back unto what was honest, and convenient.

They learned together in the Academy, all the excercises befitting their
birth, and condition, wherein by a praise worthy emulation they surpassed all
their fellows, the passions which most agitate youth are quarrels, and love,
in both these storms they vpheld each other with so inviolable fidelity, that
the interest of the one was the others, without suffering the least sprig of
jealousy to cast it is thorny roots of suspicion into their hearts. At length
it happened that Octavian set his affection on a subject so full of honor, that
it could not be attained unto but by the Rites of holy church, I mean that he
could not without impudency intend any thing thereto but by way of marriage.

Love is naturally blind, and although it be first taken by the eyes yet are
they hood-winkt unto many circumstances which would hinder it is birth, and
growth, if they were iudiciously foreseen; it was the fair face of Pauline
one of the compleatest Gentlewomen of the City, which stole away his heart,
besides her beauty she was a match very considerable for estate, so that this
his determination was not with out difficulty to be followed, and that which
made it yet less accessible, was that Gelase son to one of the principal
citizens of Vilne, was a suitor to this maid, and had obtained the good will,
both of his, and her parents, to proceed in his suite, so that he was in a good
forwardnes on both those sides, though not on Paulines, who by a natural
Antipathy had a secret aversion from his humor which she could not by any
means endure, he was proud, and haughty, arrogant both in gesture, and words,
and in liew of winning love by submission, he made himself odious to Pauline,
by his vanities, and bravadoes, and to say thus much by the way, it must be
granted that vanity is a thing so odious, that as Amber will draw unto it any
manner of strawes except of the herb Basil, so the heart of a humane creature
can apply it self to love all sorts of people how miserable soever, except
they be vain, and proud, contrariwise humility, mildness, and modesty, are
such charming qualities that there is no soul so churlish but will in the end
be won by them, and this was the way, by which Octavian insinuated himself
into the affection of Pauline, besides the other gifts of nature, which made
him commendable, a Merchant distasted in selling by his first chapman, is half
agreed with the second: the pain Pauline suffered to endure the approach and
conversation of Gelase made her to be presently taken with the Gentleness, and
submission of Octavian, who with so much grace, wrought himself into her good
will, that the offer of his service was no sooner presented, but received. And
although he had no permission from her parents to become a suitor unto her,
never thinking on this leave, which is so necessary to make a love lawful,
which tends to marriage, she applied her self to love him with so much
affection, that being not able to dissemble her fire, her actions burst out
into flame, and made it known unto proud Gelase, who jealous of his own
shadow, was so wroth to see he had a rival, that he conceived no other
thought, but to rid him by any means whatsoever, yet ere he thundered by deeds
he flasht out lightning by threats.

But although Octavian was not so rich, nor of so ancient nobility, yet was he
a Gentleman, and had a heart so well seated, that his humor could not suffer
bravadoes. Gelase having said unto him scoffingly, that he took it ill he
should encroach upon his bargain in the suite to Pauline, and that if he
abstained not from it, he should find himself to be but a bad Merchant,
Octavian answered, that he never knew but marriage affections were free, but
that whenever he should purchase this maid that way, he then should strive
to put her out of his mind, but till then he was not resolved to forbear,
being his courage was as great as his love, these words seconded by sundry
replies, would have urged them to have fallen presently to deeds, if their
friends that were present had not endeavored to hinder this contention.

Gelase told Octavian that he would make him pay interest for his temeriry,
whereunto the other answered, that since he barked so much, he would bite but
little, and that he would always make himself half the fear, if he durst
set upon him like an honest man, without treachery.

Mean time Gelase who possessed the parents of Pauline as much as Octavian the
heart of the maid, caused them, that had all power over her, to forbid her the
company of Octavian, unto whom they interdicted the entry into their house,
endeavoring therein to please Gelase, whose alliance they wished by reason of
his means, and of his noble parentage.

This so incensed the maids mind against him, that as she shunned his
encounter, and avoided all occasions of his approach, so she sought carefully,
and subtly all manner of means to speak to Octavian, or at least to write
unto him, who by secret practices advanced himself as far into the affection
of Pauline, as he^ drove out his competitor, who being not able any longer to
bear the rigorous contempts of this maid, and being desperately jealous of
Octavian, whom he knew possessed that part in her affection, that he sued for,
with so much desire, he resolved to put all in a venture, and set an end to
this business by the death of Octavian, whereupon he causes him to be watched
night and day, and at length he learnes that his usual walk was by night up
and down before the house of Pauline after the manner of passionate men, then
Gelase like to a jealous person that seeks nothing more eagerly, then that
which they are least willing to find, went in the evening, and hid himself
near that house with a friend of his, whom we will name Megatime, and one of
his men a lusty tall fellow, and one, whose courage, and fidelity he much
trusted, long had they not lien in their ambuscado, Octavian but coms
accompanied with his friend Leobell to walk his accustomed round (it being the
property of those that are possessed with any passion to walk circularly) and
at certain signs, which he made, Pauline appeared at a window, with whom he
entered into those discourses, which are ordinary between lovers; whilst
Leobell being a little wide from them, gave them time, and liberty to talk.

What furies of jealousy did then invade the mind of impatient Gelase? then
was the time that the appetite of vengeance seized him, and that he intended
to cut this rival in pieces, who to his disadvantage was thus favored: he
commands his man to go set upon Leobell, and to hold him tacke, whilst
Megatmie, and he would chastise the insolence of Octavian, at this command they
all three start out of their hole at once, and parting run with their swords
drawn to assail their adversaries, Leobell in two or three strokes gives the
Servingman two wounds, whereof one laid him on the ground, as if he had been
dead, from thence he runs to help his friend, that calls him, Octavian had
set his back to a wall, and by the help of a shop warded, and put by the
blows, and thrusts, which his enemies made at him. Leobell came furiously, and
the first he met at his swords point was Gelase, whom surprising behind, as he
was eagerly thrusting at Octavian, he ran his sword into his back, up to the
hilt, and with this only thrust he drove the soul out of his body, and laid
him on the ground. Then Octavian entering upon Megatime gave him a slight wound
in the arm, and had likewise been his death, had he not sought his safety by
flight, which he could not look for from the hands of the other by defense.
Leobell was without any hurt, but so was not Octavian who had two wounds in the
body, whereof the one was such, that had he not been speedily dressed, he had
been in danger to have lost his life, by reason of the abundance of blood,
which flowed from them.

The people run forth of their houses at the noise of this combat, and find
Gelase stark dead on the stones, and his man some few steps from thence
yielding up the ghost. Leobell holding up his friend whose heart fainted by the
loss of so much blood, and prayed the lookers on to help to carry him to a
Surgeon, where he swounded in such manner, that he was for a while thought
to be dead, yet by force of remedies they brought him to himself again, and
after the first dressing they laid him in bed.

Mean time, while all this passed, Megatime advertised Gelases parents of this
sad news, and of the untimely death of their son, and relating the matter best
to his own advantage told them that they both had bin assaulted in a
treacherous manner by Leobell and Octavian, this first tale takes such
impression that it is believed for an Oracle, whereupon recourse is had to
justice, who ordaines that Octavian, and Leobell shall be cast into prison, on
this decree Octavia^ is seized, and sick, and weak, as he was, drawn into the
goal.

Leobell gets away in hope to prove his own innocence and his friends, by
showing that they had done nothing but in their own defense, and that the
fortune of arms had fallen on them who had unjustly assaulted himself, and
his friend by treason, and advantage, but the case went quite otherwise then he
expected, because that Gelase had parents, and kindred so powerful, and
authorized in in the City of Vilne, that in few days Octavians arraignement
was at hand, and upon the only deposition of Megatime, who was, both a party,
and witness (for as much as Gelases man died presently after his master) this
poor gentleman was condemned to loose his head.

Whereupon execution day being come he was brought upon the scaffold, and
although he protested publicly not to be the author of this murder, having
contrariwise bin miserably assaulted by Megatime, and Gelase, yet the
executioner was preparing to cut of his head, when as behold here comes Leobell
thrusting through the throng, and with an admirable courage crying out to the
executioner to let loose the innocent, and to turn his sword on him, who was
not only guilty, but true author of the murder of Gelase, and his man, then
with a clear, and distinct voice, and a countenance which out braved death, he
declared unto the Magistrate, who was there present to see the execution, how
all had passed, in the same manner as we have related, concluding, that if a
man shall dye for defending his own life, he was there ready to yield his head
unto the stroke upon condition that his friend might be set at liberty.

All the company was struck with admiration to se this generous act, and the
people beginning to grow to a mutiny cried out pardon, pardon, resolving to
kill all rather then suffer this execution to pass on any further. This tumult
became so great, that nether Octauian who would feign have spoke, nor the
magistrate could be heard, only the justice commanded that all should be ended,
and that Leobell yiedling himself prisoner, the case should be heard again,
and judged according to equity, they had much ado to lead the two friends
into prison, because the people being in an uproar would have broken their
bands, and by maine force have delivered them.

The Palatine of Vilne (for Lithuania is ruled by Palatinats or governements as
Polonia is) having heard of this incomparable generosity of Leobell, went
himself in person to the prison for to visit the two friends, who both
contested before him, each to dye for his fellow, he heard the history of the
two lovers Octavian, and Pauline, the threats, and act of Gelase to hinder his
affection, Megatime was examined face to face, and confronted, who by the death
of the man, and the master was constrained by the force of truth to acknowledge
the ambuscado, that they were three aganst two, and that Leobell alone did kill
Gelase, and his man.

Whereupon Leobell taking occasion to speak, pleaded the cause of his own
death, declaring to the Palatine, that he only ought to loose his head, since
he only had killd, if for killing in his own deffence, and to save his friend
from violence were a a cause deserving punishment: nay rather glory, and
recompense, (said the Palatine) and thereupon presently took them both out of
prison, and gave them pardon according to the power of Palatines, who are as it
were Petty Sovereigns in their Palatinates, as well in Lithuania, as in
Polonia. Megatime like a base, and treacherous man was put in their place, and
had on a skaffold been a spectacle unto the people, if his parents, and
friends by their credit, and entreaties had not gotten his punishment by death
to be changed into a banishment only for some years.

The Palatine not content only to have saved the lives of these two friends,
would yet that Octavian should be satisfied in his love, causing him to be
married unto Pauline, and further he procured a wife for Leobell, a Gentlewoman
who was near allied unto himself, entreating these two friends to receive him
as a third in their incomparable friendship, which being come to the ears of
the King, in favor of the Palatine they had brave employments, and were both
honorably advanced according to their condition.

A rare example of freeness, of friendship, and of generosity, which made
Leobell so freely expose his life, unto the death, yea unto a shameful death
to save his friend, but his renown arose out of the infamy, whereunto he was
hastening, and his name adorned with honor, his life being saved by the same
gate, through which he was running to death, hereupon we may conclude that it
is good to follow virtue, seeing whosoever embraces her, she ever honors with
Crowns of glory.

EVIL COUNCIL PVNISHED.
The Ninth Event.
BAd counsel (says the ancient proverb) is often times pernitions to him, that
gives it, yea sometimes worse, then to him, that takes it. And to say the
truth, if effects are the children of their causes, as the tree draws it is
blossoms, leaves, and fruits from it is root, the malignity of an action ought
to be attributed to the counsel that bred it: and it is commonly seen that
there is more malice in those, who counsel to do naughtiness, then in those
that put it in execution. So the Scripture seems more to blame the malice of
Achitophell, then the levity of Absalon, because the one failed deliberately,
the other rashly. O how happy is the man (sath the Psalmist) who has not
followed the counesls of the wicked, because the counsel of such shall perish,
and shall cause the ruin of the authors thereof, and of those, that shall
follow it; all these verityes will appear in this Event, which I am preparing
to recite, where you shall see that the wickedness of a malefactor remaining
unpunished, the chastisement thereof lighted on the head of him which had
counseled it.

It is no new thing to say that the counsels of women (especially of those that
are bad) are dangerous. In the first creation of the world the first of all men
failed by the counsel of his wife, and we who are his children daily pay the
interest of this bad counsel, by the which we may say that sin first came
into the world. He that is truly wise will neither trust his secrets with this
sex so curious, and so tatling, nor believe it is counsel. If Palinure had
kept this maxim he had not fallen into the dangers, wherein we shall see him,
and from which he owes his deliverance to his good fortune, or to the pity
that was taken on the inconsideracies of his youth, rather then of his
innocence.

In a City of Sicilia which is not named in the Italian relation, a
Gentlewoman, whom we will call Demetry was in her tender years given in
marriage to an old man, whose jealousy, weakness, and craftiness, deprived
her of all manner of pleasure in wedlock, wherein she accounted the days as
years of captivity.

After much sufferance death cut this band otherwise indissoluble, and drawing
her from this yoke, set her (being yet young) in the liberty of widowhood. The
difference of these two states appeared unto her, as extreme, as the day
seems bright unto him that has a long time been closed up in a dark dungeon,
but what she held to be the greatest happiness of her life (to wit her freedom,
and liberty) proved the heaping up of her disgrace, and misery, because
inebriating her self with her own conceit, she betook her self so greedily
to liberty that she changed it is use into abuse, and of an honorable prisoner,
became an infamous libertine, not content to show by her habit, and actions
exterior, that she was a widow, who wanted a match, she against the custom of
the country, kept as it were open gates for those, that under pretense of being
suitors, passed their time at her house, in gaming, dancing, music, and such
like pleasant delights which serve as employments for idle youth. At the
beginning (for none become wicked on a sudden) her design was to breed love in
many, to the end she might purchase one for her husband, that might be
according to her own heart: besides her beauty which was rare, she had a great
dowry, as well of her paternall inheritance, as of what her husband had left
her, and these two things caused her to be desired of a great number, this
multitude of lovers was her ruin, for inopem ipsam copia fecit, she proved
poor by this abundance, she in this multitude knew not which to choose, and
whether it were, that she feared to be deceived in her choice, or whether
diverse pleased her eye I know not, but this she resolved to live merrily, and
not marry at all, but to remain Mistress of her self in the freedom of her
widowhood: if the love of incontinency had suggested his design unto her, she
had then deserved praise, but that was the least in her thought, desirous
contrariwise to make use of this precious gift of liberty, to serve the
unrulinesse of her appetite, she betook her self unto a life so manifestly
dishonest, that in few days she became the fable of the world, and the subject
of public detraction, nevertheless for to preserve still some vain shadow
of reputation unto her self, she ever kept some of her suitors in hope of
marrying her, and toward those she behaved her self as sharply, and coyly,
as she was facile, tractable, and pleasing toward them that she pleased her
self withal, so that the possessors laughing at the simplicity of the
pretenders admired the tricks, and charms of this Circe, who made that
inaccessible to some, which she gave in prey, and pillage to others. This
wanton unchaste woman was the common rock for the youth of the City to make
shipwreck at, her house was a school of lasciviousness, an Academy of
licentiousness, and a right temple of Cyprus where the sacrifices were only
dishonesties.

These foolish loves are seldom seen to be without jealousy, for as
rottenness takes sooner in apples, which are bruised, then in those that be
sound, and whole, so jealousy, which is nothing but a corruption of judgment,
takes far more easily in giddy, and unjust passions, then in lawful
affections; and this was the cause that among^^ these young men, who had no
pretentions, but of flesh, and blood, sundry quarrels arose; these ordinary
quarrels seconded by execrable slaughters, made Demetrie, so infamous that she
was accounted as a stone of scandal which ought to be cast forth of the City,
because being in it, it rather served to ruin then edify, if some just order
had been taken against these unjust disorders in time, that which we are about
to re^^te had never happened, but as it is the part of wise persons to foresee
the evils to come, so the impudent, whose eyes are only in their heads see but
these, which are at hand.

Amongst those that hunted after this glorious, but devouring Panther, one was
a Lord of note, whose quality, and means, as well as his person, pierced her
eyes, and although she led a very licentious, and shameful life, yet believing
every one to be as blind as her self, she imagined that her bad demeanors were
not perceived, which made her so presumptuous as to think she should be
sought unto for marriage, as much as though she were very honest, and chaste
indeed, knowing then that Fusbert was now fallen into her nets, and that
nothing augments love so much as modest behavior, be it fained, or true, she
employed all her art, and skill to breed an opinion in him that she was a woman
far more honest then she was counted to be; wherein she found such good
success, that whatsoever the friends of Fusbert told him concerning the life
of this Lais, he took all those verities to be but spoken in malice, and to be
mere calumnies, and believing that she was as froward, and peevish to others,
as she was harsh, and untractable to him, he belyed the common report as if it
had been a slander. The folly of his passion led him into such furies, that he
could no longer live if he found not means to satisfy his desire, and
Demetry granting to him no access but by way of marriage, he resolved to leap
that style, and take her to his wife. This was a match so great and so rich,
that the eyes of Demetry were dazeled therewith, and it made her forget that
liberty which was the Element of her pleasures, and seeing him so besotted on
her, she was of opinion that being his wife, she should have such power over
him, and so rule him that she would cast a mist before his eyes, and so
continue in her fooleries.

Ambition then led her to give ear to this marriage, as it was foolish love
that led Fusbert thereunto, but the worst was that this pigeon being not of
full age, could not contract it without the consent of his mother, who was yet
living, and his guardian during his nonage: now should he speak to her of
this, it were but labor lost, but more likely to overthrow all the business,
you shall then here what this crafty woman devised, who yielded her self to
others on a far easier composition. After that she had a long time consulted
this matter with her suitor, she made this agreement, for to content her self
only with a promise of marriage upon condition to perform the solemnities
thereof, as soon as he should come to the age sufficient, whereof he yet
wanted two or three years, during the which she intended to keep this bird in
cage, and to live still according to her former liberties.

Fusbert, who to arrive at the haven he so much desired, could have signed his
own death, would needs write this promise with his own blood, so much did
passion transport him, now after he had signed this assurance, he thought he
had enough, and as much as he desired, and that the consummation preceded this
imaginary marriage; yet no sooner was he caught in this trap, but the scales
fell from his eyes, after he had eaten of the forbidden fruit* the troop of
wooers are not yet discarded, Demetries gates are still open unto companies,
she is no whit the more retired, she welcomes the one, receives the other, and
entertaines them with as much liberty, as before, which pleases not our jealous
Sicilian, if he reprove her for it, she presently accuses him of jealousy,
then she protests of her honesty, and innocence, and can so well deal with
him, that he is constrained to crave pardon for his suspicions, and to cry her
mercy, for the wrong which she her self does to him.

Whilst she continues in this manner of licentious living after she had (as he
thought) purchased Fusbert for her husband, she caught into her nets, a new prey
with whose good p^rts she was extremely taken, and this was a young Gentleman,
who was a younger brother, and had little else but his sword, indeed for
beauty, and v^lour he was inferior to few, bearing the heart of Mars with the
face of Adonis, hardly had he attained two the age of two and twenty years,
but that he had both by sea, and land manifested his valor, so that he gave
hopes of proving a very complete knight. This Circe having by her charms made
him her captive, was not her self nevertheless exempt from slavery, because
she became as it were, an Idolater of his perfections, insomuch that being as
desirous of him. as he could be of her, she needed not much entreating to yield
unto his will. These unlucky women have this property to breed more passion in
men after they have possessed them, then whilst they woe them, by reason of
the cunning allurements wherewith they season familiarity. Richard (so will we
call this young Gallant) became so inamoured on this Thais, that as she could
not live without him, no more could he live without her, blindness a quality
inseparable in love drove them unto a commerce so evident, that it was
perceived even by the dullest sighted, much more by Fusbert whose jealousy
made him now see the very atoms, the smallest things, who before let slip much
greater; presently rage, and vengeance enter his spirit, sometimes he was
minded to kill this rival, and this wicked woman, then recalling that, he
determined to forsake this wicked creature, and to break his word with her who
falsified her faith with him.

Having by the ordinary motions of jealousy spied out all their actions, and
found that his suspicions were undoubted truths, he resolved to break the
bonds, in which he was obliged to this disloyal person, and endeavoring by
all means possible to learn particularly what reputation she had, he found
in all companies, that she was counted for a very lascivious woman, whereupon
he intended to turn bankerupt in the promise he had made her, and to leave her
infamous as she was far more worthy of his anger, and revenge then of his
love.

Having remained some few days from seeing her, during which time he
endeavored to cure those wounds by absence, which his heart had received by
the presence of this deceitful beauty. Demetrie who would feign hold him still
in leash, mistrusting his inconstancy writ letters to recall him, but he
returned her answers so full of reproaches, and spitfull terms, accompanied
with protestations so contrary unto the promise he had formerly made her, that
she presently thought that this horse had slipped his brdle, and would escape
away.

After she long time to no purpose employed her whole art, and skill, to
reconquer his mind, which contrariwise became more froward by her submission,
and grew sharper by her entreaties, she fell to threats of constraint,
protesting to sue him on his promise, thereby to make him acknowledg^ it, and
to perform the contents thereof: This put Fusbert into such a rage, that not
content to scoff at her menaces, and at the writing which she had, he compiled
a legend of her life so full of the most filthy, and shameful things
accompanied with such beastly, and dishonest truths. That Demetrie animated by
a furious despair, vowed to revenge her self thereof or to dye in the
attempt, but finding her self over weak to perform so notable a deed, and
being not able to recall this fugitive, and so to work him some mischief, she
bethought her self, that she could not better bring her bloody design to
pass, then by Richard her new favorite, who being desperately entangled in
her love would hazard his life in all dangers whatsoever to content her.

The shameful reproaches that Fusbert cast forth in all companies, of this
wicked woman, were spread so far that every one spoke thereof, and besides he
nominated Richard more then any other, who being descended of noble blood, and
being of a brave courageous mind was not able to endure these invectives, which
so merely touched his honor, together with the reputation of that woman, to
whom he was so much devoted, and therefore might the more easier be induced to
take the revenge thereof, whereunto Demetry employing her charming tears, he
vowed by her eyes which he called his light (and which were indeed his souls
deadly torches) that he would not sleep until such time, as he had presented
her with the heart, and tongue of Fusbert. And in fine after he had often
watched him accompanied with some bravadoes as the manner of Italy is, he took
him at such an advantage, that Fusbert being pierced through in diverse places
remained dead in the place.

The kindred of this murdered man, being the greatest and most eminent of the
city, caused such a search to be made after Richard, that not long after he was
found, and taken by the Magistrate who cast him into prison, and in these
obscure dungeons did his eyes open, whereby he came to know his fault, whereof
he could hope for no pardon, in that he had such powerful adversaries,
assuring himself therefore of death, he declared the truth of all, he
confessed, and acknowledged, that the only counsel, and persuasions of Demetry
had urged him unto an act so detestable, whereof he repented himself from the
very bottom of his heart.

Hereupon Demetry is attached and put in hold, where she denied nothing of what
Richard had said, but confirmed it, believing verily that she had reason to
avenge her self on him, whom she had found a traitor perfidious, and a
violater of her chastity; this her malice being known, all the Judges were of
opinion that she deserved death: only the youth of Richard suborned by this
accursed woman, bred compassion in them, whereunto adding the glory of his
birth, and moreover the merit of his valor, there were none but lamented his
misfortune, seeing that by the rigor of justice he was condemned to dye in the
prime of his years: but his parents, and kindred, who feared that this
execution would be an everlasting reproach unto their generation, and not
knowing by what means to avoyde it, they with money corrupted a turne-key of
the prison, who gave him the means of escaping away: within few days sentence
was given against the evil counselor, who was condemned to loose her head on
a scaffold, which was done accordingly, and Richard should also have borne her
company if he had not been gone.

After this, means were made to appease the friends of Fusbert: and Richards
valor, which made it self famous of in Flanders, added unto the consideration
of his kindred, obtained a pardon and abolition of his fault, and license to
return into his country, where he verified, what is commonly reported, that
punishments light not always on the guilty, but sometimes on the unfortunate;
and if we shall reflect on that, which led him into the mishap of this murder,
there is no doubt to be made, but Demetry was more criminal then he, since he
but lent his arm to the execution of that vengeance, which she had inspired
him withal.

Youth may here learn to avoyde evil counsels, as rocks stained with
thousands of shipwracks, and to withdraw themselves from the unfortunate
acquaintance, and familiarity of these shameless women, who not contented to
fill those with scandal, who are spectators of their disordered lives, led
those that follow them unto brutish, and inhumane actions, not only of the
flesh, but also of blood, whereof antiquity furnishes us with a thousand
examples, amongst which the judicious reader may see if this that I have now
related may not be placed.

THE LONG Vengeance.
The Tenth Event.
AS the least follyes are the most commendable, so is the least continuance of
anger. Those revenges which are executed in the heat of choler, when the
blood is boiling, although not excuseable (forasmuch as we ought neither to
excuse a vice, nor flatter a passion, which should be subdued by reason) yet
are they less to be blamed then those, which are taken in cold blood, and
whose continuance shows a black, and diabolical malice; the French are
subject to violent passions, whose suddenesse, and fury proves very dangerous:
but those people that live beyond the mountains, are possessed with hereditary
hatred, and as if vengeance were one of the sweetest things belonging to life,
they lengthen and continue it, as much as they can, when they have once gotten
their adversaries in their power, making them endure many torments, whose
prolongation is worse then a thousand deaths, which made that cruel Emperor
Domitian say, that he would cause those, whom he tormented, to feel
themselves dye, and being petitioned by one of them, that he might be quickly
dispatched by death; since when (answered he) is this man entered into favor
again with me. Although death be the last of all worldly pains, yet some
deaths are far worse, then others, and which by their lingering length
multiplye deaths: and therein does consist the tyranny of those vengeances
which preserve life, but only to lengthen pain.

Ceraste a Gentleman of Millaine continued a suite for many years with Trophime
a Lord of great note, and also bearing the title of Earl, because the said
Ceraste would not acknowledge to owe him fealty: at length by the decree of the
Senate of Millaine, he was acquitted from this homage, and his land declared
free, it was but little, and lying within the County and Earldom of Trophime,
whose great courage could not there suffer a fellow, wherefore what he could
not obtain by law (which was to make Ceraste his vassal he thought fit by
violence to take revenge thereof. Now this Ceraste was grown something ancient
and either by the intemperancy of his youth, or by issuing from a gowty
generation (for this disease is said to be hereditary) he was so afflicted with
the gowt, that he could hardly go, besides he was so indebted, that if the
gowt decayed his body, creditors did no less to his purse, whether it were
that ill husba^dry had caused it, or else along continued quarrel which he had
had with a neighboring Gentleman whose name was Procore, so it is that he felt
himself extremely diminished in his estate, but he was delivered out of all
these miseries by an extraordinary means as you shall here in the sequel:

Upon a day being mounted on a little mule, as he was taking the air about his
grounds, Trophime who watched for him, as a vulture for his prey, came well
accompained, and suddenly surprised him. Ceraste who thought no other, but
that his throat should presently be cut, for to move Trophime to compassion,
cried him mercy and begged for life. Thou shall have life (answered Trophime)
because thou do beg it, but thou shall not have death when thou would,
this being said he caused him to be led unto his house, and cast into a dark
prison where he made him endure pains less sufferable then death. Cerastes
mule was found grasing in the field, but as for tidings of him none could be
heard, his wife, and two children, caused all the enquiry, and search to be
made that possibly they could, but never were able to discover what was become
of him, upon the quarrel that he had had with Procore, many conjectured that
he had killd him.

On these weak surmises the Justice seases on Procore and a lusty fellow who
ordinarily waighted on him armed with sword, and dagger, for want of witnesses
they are both put upon the wrack, where the vehemence of torments made them
confess, what they never did, accusing themselves to have murdered Ceraste,
whereupon Precore was beheaded, and his man hanged; not long after this
Trophime caused miserable Ceraste to be led by night unto a strong castle,
which he had on the banks of the lake Mayor, and thereto be locked up in the
bottom of a tower, where he saw no other light, but through a little hole, at
the top, and was fed by the house keeper with nothing save bread, and water,
the ground being his bed, and the roof for his couerled: in these obscurityes
and miseryes he often desires them to put him to death, but he that took
delight in his pain would not grant him this cruel favor: he remanied there
until the death of Trophime which was about thirteen or fourteen years
after his taking, who left this hatred, and vengeance for an inheritance unto
his son Castalio, who succeeding his father in cruelty prolonged the
imprisonment, and bad usage of Ceraste.

During this time Cerastes wife dyed, and his two sons having divided the
estate, made away the best part thereof to pay his dets, thinking themselves
to have lost their Father also: when behold the power of heaven whose eyes are
ever waking on miserable creatures, and who suffers not the rod of the wicked
to continue on the heads of innocent persons, by an unexpected means opened a
way unto the liberty of Ceraste.

Castalio being in mind to repair some ruins about the castle wherein Ceraste
was rather buried alive then imprisoned, it happened that the Masons working
thereat dug so deep about the foundations of the tower, that they made a
little trench therein, through the which they perceived this miserable man, who
at the first affrighted them, but at last he moved so much pity in them, that
having heard the History of his disaster, they made him a passage for to escape
away: this happened after nineteen years imprisonment.

Presently he repaires to his own house, meager, pale, and in the worst case
that can be imagined, where no body at the first knew him, at last he was
known by his children, unto whom he related the time, aad manner of his
taking, and his long continuance in that miserable prison, whereupon a great
suite is framed against Castalio, who for such a barbarism begun by his
father, and continued by him, was condemned to pay all the debts of Ceraste,
who by this means re-entred into all the lands, which his sons had sold, and
became master of that Castle wherein he had so long been a captive, and where
by the benefit of hunger, and A good remedy against the gowt.
misery he became cured of the pains of the gowte.

He lived some few years after his deliverance, free from creditors, and
without Physicians: An admirable spectacle whereby to behold the omnipotency of
the divine providence which does not only help in calamity, but also draws
profit out of tribulation. An Italian Bishop in his pleasant, and curious
discourses, whereunto he has added the title of Caniculary days relates this
Event, which he assures to be true as having learned it from the own mouth of
Ceraste, who was then delivered from his so long imprisonment, and from debts
no less troublesome then the gowt was painful.

THE VNLVCKY WORD.
The Eleventh Event.
LIfe, and death, are in the power of the tongue, the mouth which tells a lie
kills the soul, much more when it blaspemeth or speaks rash words, out of
a desperate hastiness, from which the Prophet prayed God that he would
preserve him. This makes St. James compare the tongue unto fire, whose least
spark being scattered by carelessness causes great burning and consuming, he
calls it likewise an universal iniquity, as being a thing that defiles the
whole body and soul, like a tun full of must or new unrefined wine, which
fowls it self with it is own foame; he adds moreover that it is harder to be
tamed then the fiercest beasts, yea worse then Serpents, Tigers, or Lions, an
unquiet evil full of deadly poison, and the place from whence proceed
cursings, and blessings; indeed as there is nothing so light, and slippery, so
there is no faculty in us whereunto we ought to take more heed, seeing the
greatest part of sins come from thence: for very often does it happen, that
men utter so many, and inconsiderate speeches, that they are taken at their
word, and they remain punished for the same, before they can have so much
time, as to crave repentance therefore. The history I am about to relate will
show you, that the predictions of the wicked do often turn to their own ruin.

In a City of Swisse which the relation names not, a Surgeon as expert in
healing of bodies, as he was ignorant in curing his own soul of the wounds of
vice, although he had a fair and very honest wife, not content to quench his
concupiscence with her alone, had still some giddy passion or other in his
soul, which stole away his heart from her, who only had the lawful right to
possess both it, and his body, he led a most dissolute and deboist life, which
abandoned his health bringing it unto shameful maladies, and his reputation
for a prey unto tongues, his wife perceiving his evil courses, labored at
first, by all the gentlest, and most convenient means she could devise, to
withdraw him from those bottomless pits wherein he was sinking, both soul,
body, and estate, yet his untractable mind amended not by all these remedies,
but on the contrary, as sweet things (according to the Aphorism) be most
easily converted into choler, and as oil feeds the fire which is quenched by
other liquors, so her sweet admonitions made him more chollerick, and the
gentler he was handled, the worse did he sting. Patience leaving this woman,
whose head was troubled with a just jealousy, she fell to reproaches, and
threats, which more vexed her froward husband, who replied with sharp words
seconded with such heavy blows, that the poor woman was half brained
thereby. This harsh usage made her complain to her parents, who made their
moan unto the Magistrate, he finding himself obliged to redress this
disorder, caused the Surgeon to be cited before him, and ratled him with so
good a lesson, and withal caused him to pay such a fine, that he amended him,
if not in effect, yet at least in show, and commanded him on pain of
imprisonment to leave of his accustomed haunting of such suspicious houses,
where if ever he were known, to go again, he would cause him to be
punished as an adulterer.

Here now becomes the sinner humbled, and he who rejoiced in his evil, and
gloryed in his fault, endeavored to hide his dissoluteness, to avoyde
scandal, murmur, and the punishment wherewith the Judge threatened him; yet
could he not long abstain, for since the wicked has cast down his eyes from
beholding heaven, and is fallen to the very bottom of the Abyssus, he
despises all humane advertisements, having played bankrout with his salvation,
but now he finds other tricks, he makes his journeyes by night, and by stealth.
And to his jealous wife, who had over him as many eyes as Argus, he finds out
thousands of lies. And like another Mercury pipes her asleep, with a flattering
tongue, and counterfeit kindnesses; nevertheless she still mistrusts him,
knowing that as the Ethiopian cannot leave his blackness, nor a Leopard the
spots of his skin, howsoever they are washed, so it is likewise hard for him
that has taken a habit of evil to leave of his vicious customs.

Hereupon she sets diverse spies, but the malicious man multiplies his deceits,
and finds more inventions to cast himself away, then his good careful wife
has to save him, yea he so jndustriously does hide his naughtines, that
although he minded nothing else, yet his neighbors think him to be reformed,
and if his wife complain, they mock her suspicions, and accuse her of
causl^sse jealousy.

At length having gathered together his affections and rather having settled his
infections on a lost creature whose only frequentation had been sufficient to
defame those that resorted unto her, being one, that made an infamous traffic
of her self, he made his heart, and his body one with this woman. This
stinking fire could not be kept so secret, but that it showed it self by it is
smoke, and blacknes, his wife had already gotten some small knowledge of this
matter, and already did the neighbors about the place, where he haunted begin
to perceive it, and what veiles soever he invented to cover himself withal
were merely as spiders webs which discovered him in covering him.

One of his most probable excuses was to frame some journeyes out of town,
whereupon getting upon a Mule which he kept he would ride forth of the City,
and come late in the night unto the adulteress whom he frequented, this craft
being discovered, by continuance, his wife reproved him for it, and threatened
to certify the Judge that he still continued his lewd courses, to the end that
fear of punishment might cause him to refrain, but he being altogether
obstinate in his vice, and as it were fallen into a reprobate sense, jested at
her admonitions, and with blasphemous oaths, and horrible imprecations
labored to cover his fault, as if adultery (says that ancient Lawyer) could
be purged by oath: but heaven does not always laugh at the perjuries of those,
that are blinded with the foolish passion which they call love, but when the
measure of a sinners iniquities is come to it is full heap, the arm of the
most high turns down on his shoulders, and makes him feel the weight
thereof, by punishments no less strange then terrible.

This man being arrived at the full period of his abominations, and his fault
drawing along with it it is inseparable shadow punishment, got on evening upon
his Mule, saying, as he had often before done, that he was riding forth of
town about a very important cure, his wife who misdoubted the stratageme,
asked him where it was that he was going, thy jealously (said he) that puts a
thousand hammering suspicions into thy head, makes thee imagine that I am now
going to some lewd place; but think whatsoever thou will, I will be my own
master, and free as I list, neither will I give any body account of mine
actions.

His wife knew by these speeches that he was going to the place whereunto his
unjust concupiscence drew him, for even as ulcerated bodies will not endure to
be touched to the quick, so likewise will guilty minds be netled, and moved
unto anger being reprehended for their faults: well she proceeds in her
exclamations, railes, and threatens him, he who had hardened himself in malice,
disputing with this furious woman, rendered her word for word, threat forthreat,
and at last said unto her, if thy curiosity must needs be satisfied: know then,
that in despite of thee, and of thy railing I am going to a bawdy house.

With these words he leapes upon his Mule, and spurring him hard to get from
the bawling woman, who began to raise a rumor about her gate by the complaints
which she made unto her neighbors. This Mule being something untoward feeling
himself extraordinarily pressed by the spur, began to kick, fling, and leap,
with such violence that he cast his master from his back, whose foot hanging
in one of his stirrups, and the Mule setting himself to run with all his force
dragged this adulterer in such a manner on the stones, that his head shattered
into many pieces, and his brains lay in the streets, this humorous beast
stayed not till she came before the door of that infamous house, whereunto he
had so unluckily said he was going, and where his accustomed haunt was, there
did the Mule stay with his unfortunate master who stark dead, and much broken
remained there a long on the ground. Thus through divine permission by the
death of this miserable man was discovered the commerce, which when he was
living, he had kept so secret, and thus was preached on the house tops what he
had committed in a close chamber, so was verified what the holy Scripture
teaches us, that all creatures which breath on the face of the earth fight for
Gods justice against those senseless persons, that violate his law, and stray
from his ways.

Presently this was bruited all over that part, where this horrid spectacle
was, and so far were any from bewayling this disaster, that contrariwise
every one adored and praised the Almighties justice in his chasticement,
according to that of the Prophet, that he will make abundant retribution unto
the proud, and that good people rejoicing to see his vengeance, shall wash
their hands in the blood of the sinner.

THE JUSTIFICATION by Crime.
The Twelfeth Event.
POliticians hold that sometimes a particular Justice takes best effect, where
a public Justice ought to have bin executed: and that the rigor, and
severity of the Law, which many are made to feel, brings pain to some, fear
to many, and keeps all persons in their due obedience, and allegiance. There
are ulcers which are incurable, if the extreme remedies of fire and steel be
not applied thereunto; and there are also crimes which cannot be expiated but
by extraordinary chastisements, yet oftentimes cunning must be used, where
force cannot avail, and the Foxes skin supply the shortness of the Lions.
It is true that according to the Maxim of the Casuists, Evil must not be done
that good may follow thereof, yet it may so happen that justice authoriseth
some particular actions, which cannot be justifiable but by the good they bring
to the weal public. All this will verify it self by the following History,
where you shall perceive a man to be ^eclared innocent, and his crimes
pardonable, by an increasing of one fault on the head of another.

When as Pope Sixtus the fifth sat in the chair of Rome, Italy was found so
full of thieves, and robbers, which there they call Bandits, that commerce was
much hindered thereby, because none might travel safely, nor scarce be in the
country without danger, for those villains assembling in troops, kept the
high ways, robbing the passengers, and without mercy killing those that made
any resistance. This torrent of villainies did so overflow, that nothing could
oppose it is fury, the Provostes nor archers durst not resist them, and already
were they grown to such a head, as they sought not to hide themselves in
woods, mountains, nor caves, but held Villages, Castles, and Hamlets, this
danger almost menacing Cities, no remedy could be found to be applied unto this
extreme evil, and all human wisdom was too weak to find out means for the
extirpation of this accursed crew. The Princes who saw the dissolution of their
States to approach very near, if some speedy remedy were not found, began to
consult together for the taking of these people; at length they resolved to put
arms into the Commons hands, and give them free liberty to fall upon those
monsters, who like vipers gnawed the bowels of their country, but this popular
violence having made them more furious by despair, seeing themselves pursued
with extremity like wild beasts, they set fire on all places where they came,
and made such havocke and such slaughters as cannot be read in history without
horror.

Hereupon a grave and wise politician gave this counsel, which at first was
thought something strange, but experience showed it to be profitable: and this
was to set a price upon the heads of these cut-throates, and to promise
impunity and general pardon to those, that should bring them either alive or
dead before the Princes: this put such a division, and mistrust among those
rascals, that they were in continual suspicion each of other, which brake
that intelligence, wherein consisted their greatest strength: And as God in
times past for to destroy the Madianites made use only of their own hands, for
these villains daily killed one another, some to get their repeal from
banishment, others to have the reward proposed unto those that should bring the
head of a Bandite: now amongst the most resolutest, and boldest tricks, which
are related thereof here is one execrable indeed in it is execution, yet with a
remarkable stratagem, wherein the hand of God is seen to accompany the wicked.
There were three of these thieves, which held always together, and made their
enterprises, and preyes common amongst themselves, they roved up and down
about the Appenine mountains where they committed wonderful villainies; a
merchant falling amongst them was robbed in whose male they found about a
thousand crowns, now one of these three not corresponding in courage unto the
other, was nevertheless as eager after the booty, as any of the rest, who
exposed themselves unto all dangers, which bred in them such an indignation
against him, that they resolved to be ridd of him, this they kept secret until
this notable robery of this merchant, in parting whereof this coward (who had
served but as a sentinel whilst the others did the deed) became very
obstinate to have his third part, one of the others said privately to him, that
had assisted him, what shall we do with this base fellow? he shunnes blows,
and will not hazard himself, yet requires as much as we who hazard our lives,
the best way will be to rid our hands of him, and to part the spoil betwixt
us, besides thou have an extreme desire to return into thy country thou may
carry his head, and so procure thy pardon, and moreover a hundred crowns which
thou may send me for aiding thee in this execution: there be some souls so
corrupt, and so abandoned unto all vice, that show them a vice, and they will
fly thereunto like fire to sulphur: this proposition pleased the second theife
well, because he saw therein two notable advantages, they then agree betwixt
themselves to murder the third and to execute this wicked design in going
along, the second promised to begin, and the first promised to make an end of
him, in case that he killed him not with the first blow, as they rid thus along
upon good horses, and contesting in the sharing of this Merchants money, he
that had promised to begin shooting of his pistol hit the coward in the head,
and made his brains fly about, he that had given this counsel shooting of
his in pretense of dispatching him, discharged of purpose in the head of this
murderer, and struck him stark dead on the ground: in this manner he remained
sole master of the booty, and besides possessor of his two fellows heads,
whereof he gave the one to a Bandite of his acquaintance, which got him his
pardon, reserving to himself the hundred crowns, promised over and above for
the said head, the other head he carried himself, for which he had together
with another hundred crowns a general pardon for all his crimes. And thus was
he, as it were, made innocent by heaping many horrible faults one upon another.
Who does not see, in this example, an evident testimony of the weakness of
humane justice, constrained to use such strange means to destroy the race of
the wicked? but the justice of God goes in another manner, because that all is
in his hand, and there is no place where the guilty can seek shelter from his
wrath. For not long after as this bloody author of so many murders proud of his
impunity walked, not at all repenting, but boasting of his wickedness, and
making a glory of his confusion, the Merchant who knew him again grieving for
his loss, seconded by some friend, set upon him so fiercely, that after he
had received some wounds, he was forced to seek his safety by flight, and by
the just judgment of God, by his flight he met with his death, for having
gotten into a house whereinto he was followed close by his adversaries,
thinking to leap down from a gallery, and thereby escape, he shattered
himself in pieces, dying in rages, torments, and despaires most dreadful, so
he that had escaped the judgments of men fell into the hands of God, before
whom crimes do not justify.

FINIS.
CERTAIN MORAL RELATIONS SELECTED out of the two Books written thereof in
French, BY The right Reverend Father John Peter Camous Bishop of BELLEY, Anno
Domini 1628.

Faithfully Translated into English.

LONDON, Printed by Thomas Harper for William Brooks, and are to be sold at his
shop in Holborn in Turnstile Lane. 1639.

The Author to the Reader.
Dear Reader, take these moral relations as a continuance of my singular
Events, it is the same style, the same manner of writing, and to the same
intent and purpose, nothing differs but the Title, and the matters different in
show, not in effect, my chief intention being by all these examples, which I
gather here, and there in the things that pass in the world, to correct
vicious manners, and encourage to virtuous courses. If I fall short of this my
purpose, my weakness must be excused and my good will not blamed.

The Translator to the Reader.
TO the end that I might avoyde reiterations, out of all the Authors large
Preface unto this Book of morrall relations, which would only have been
tedious, not pleasant to the Reader, I have only given you a little taste of
the latter part, the reason chiefly is, that because I join these singular
Events, and Morrall relations, in one volume, you have an Epistle at the
beginning which at large informs you of his intents, reasons, and motives,
which I think man suffice; my intents, and wishes shall ever equal, and
accompany the Authors, in these his worthy, and my poor labors,

Farewell.

THE HONORABLE INFIDELITY.
The First Relation.
AT one side of that ancient City of the Gauls, where the old Druides
dedicated a Temple unto her, who being a Virgin, brought forth a Child, a
Country lies bearing the name of Perch, this Province as shady, as the
Beausse her neighbor is uncovered, shows how great the advantage is which
nature gives unto those Countries where wood grows in abundance, since it
serves for a remedy against the scorching heates of Summer, by the
pleasantness of it is shade, and against the sharp coldness of Winter in
feeding fire, which is one half of life during that rigorous season: amidst
the groves which serve as a necessary ornament unto the Region whereof I
speak, there stands a Castle bearing such rank as few are before it, but
diverse hehind it in magnificence. This Castle gives name unto a Family
sufficiently known, and the which we will veil under that of Fleuranval; the
Lord of this place was one who governed his Family with no less prudence then
authority, which made him to be dreaded not only in his own Lands, but also in
the neighboring places, for if either of these two qualities separated be
sufficient to imprint respect, and fear in those that consider them in any
person, what may they do being both conjoined together in one? Every one
seeks to keep in favor with the wiseman, and soon grows distasteful of the
prudent, because that he cannot be surprised; and if it be so that the
subtilitie of his wit pass unto craft, he is able both to surprise and harm;
and as for the valiant, it is his property to strike terror even into the
minds of the most-esteemed, since that if they will not yield to reason, he
makes them stoop thereunto by force. The Lord of Fleuranval had made himself
famous both in the one and the other of these, and knew how to make himself be
feared by those, who would not love his austere virtues.

But if the bodies of children do never so perfectly resemble those that begot
them, but that there may be found some notable differences, there are muchmore
diversities in the minds which draw not their original from earthly Fathers;
This was it that made Zotique, eldest son to this Lord, so far from the
humor of his father, the good man extremly hating deboysenesse, and principaly
that kind wherein are used deceit and cheating. Zotique was extremely given
to gaming, which exercise much displeased his Father, not only because he
knew that a wise man never submits his means to hazard, but also that he was
assured gaming to be the widest gate for a Family to pass to it is ruin; and
he that is infected with this disease, much resembling that of wirters, to wit;
the itch of the fingers ends, shall find in the end, though having won, yet
he has lost much, since the loss of time is such, that it can never be
recovered: It is true that Zotique excused himself, saying; that being as he
was, his Father yet living, he could loose but little, and might win much:
but he might have been answered with the words of an ancient Philosopher, who
reprehending a youth for gaming, and he saying, that his play was but for a
small matter, replied; My Son, Custom is not a thing of small consequence.
Zotique had yet another excuse far more unreasonable then the former, and which
ministered occasion to think ill of his dealing, for he complained of his
Fathers severity (so did he disguise the name of avarice) which he thought
would be too outrageous, and said, he allowed him not means sufficient; yet
wanted he nothing that was needful, but would have reached unto superfluity,
which was a thing that the Lord of Fleuranval intended not, knowing that to
fill a bottomless pit, and to satisfy the disordinate desires of unruly
youth is all one.

Zotique then made traficke of his play, and gained more thereby then if he had
had much money in bank, but by what art, that must be imagined; for if
Usurers use so maine crafty devises to veil their unjust practices, you may
believe that Cheaters, fear nothing more then to be called by their names,
nor are there any injurious speeches that they will take so much exceptions at,
nor any thing so terrible as to be surprised in their sleights. Zotique was
reported to use this infamous trade; infamous indeed in all persons, but
chiefly in a Gentleman; who together with honor, ought to have loyalty and
sincerity in high esteem: but how many be there in great Cities, who under
the name of Academicks, live only by these manual sophistications, losing the
body of true honor, whilst they follow the shadow of false; for, to
maintain themselves honorable, say they, they pull pigeons in gaming houses,
will not I affirm for certain, that Zotique practiced this odious commerce,
for who can Judge of these deeds of darkness so closely concealed? but I may
say with the common voice, that he had the name so to do, and it was this
ignominious reputation, that grieved his father, and made him use sharp and
threatening reproves, but to as much purpose, as the washing of a Blackmoore,
to seek for to root out of him that habit, which by little and little was
converted into nature; and besides, wherein he found profit, a mor^ell so
dainty, and so delicate a bait, that all fish will bite a^ it; and a rock
which few persons seek to avoid*

As the Father manteyned his house with luster by Just and right ways of good
husbandry, so the son by crooked paths appeared Gallant, in attendants, in
apparel, in feasts, in horses and in all, with such magnificence and great
splendour, that either he must sink himself into debts, or by bad yet subtle
ways, ruin those with whom he played. Now, the first of these appearing not,
to wit; that he ran into debt, the second was believed to the great decay of
his birthes glory, and the prejudice of his reputation: Idleness as all men
know, is the nurserie of all vices; play is the occupation of idle persons, and
as the spring from whence are drawn diverse bad channells: money is the nerves
and sinews of wickedness as well as of war; now as Venus is cold without Ceres
and Bacchus, so without the help of Pluto, who is the God of that metal,
which the avarice of mortals has plucked out of the Earths bowels, riot
cannot last; but what vein of gold would not be drained dry by prodigality,
since it is a bottomless gulf: truly unto those that be very fortunate in
play, gameing serves as a spring, to uphold their great expenses. But where are
these children of good fortune, who feel not sometimes her turnings and
crossings and by experience in playing, find not that cards and dice are more
uncertain, then Arms? I believe truly, and my belief is not without ground,
that the most fortunate gamesters do in the end loose all, if a wise retreat
prevent not their ruin. As for Coggers and Cheaters, if they hold out a little
longer in this exercise, it is because they dexterously hide their tricks, but
being once, though not found out, yet but only suspected, they are avoided as
Serpents hidden under flowers, and people shun their company as persons
infected with some contagious disease, like unto an excellent Master of
defense, with whom no man will fight, not so much for the esteem of his
valor, as for fear of his dexterity.

If play led Zotique into diverse disorders, think you that love the child of
play, of past-time and of the purse, had no access in his mind? Truly this
passion, unto which is attributed bored hands, made no small havoc, in his
mind; and if he cheated men with Cards and Dice to draw from them gold and
silver, think you that with these metals which pierce the strongest Towers,
and by which thousands of places are not impregnable, he could not cunningly
cheat, or overcome the modesty of the most resolute? How many Dana's did he
surprise with this shower? how many stains did this unluckie rain make in the
honor of diverse inconsiderate Women? But in fine, this metal is not a
Loade-stone unto all hearts; there are some so noble, that what others highly
esteem, they courageously despise. Those former who adore these metals, show
themselves to have earthly and muddy minds, and very weak eyes to be dasled by
their glittering; but it is these other brave spirits that never buckle to any
dishonorable thing, what necessity soever press them, and whom ambition or
desire of gain never turn from the old path of virtue; you shall see this
verity lively painted out, with diverse colors in the sequ^l^ of this Relation.

True it is, that Zotique burning only with a light sensual fire which soon
quenched after enjoying, had like a furious wild Boar made a prodigious spoil
in the vine of many women's honesty, whereof some he had inveagled with promises
and fair speeches, but most of them by gifts, whose effects are much more
pressing and powerful then words, dvers had laid hold of his baits, and
yielded to his allurements, his conversation having in it strong charms to
move affection, principally in the Country, where Women are not so crafty as
in Cities, and therefore more subject to be deceived and surprised, for as
poverty raigns there more imperiously, so is the gate easier to be opened unto
corruption, chiefly when gold darts it is rays into these Country souls;
besides, Nobity and Gentrey in the Country do often pass from authority to
violence, not content to be Lords, if they stretch not, as it were, from
Royalty to tyranny. I allege all this upon the subject which I am going to
treat of, to wit; the intemperance of Zotique; he was informed that in a
Village near neighboring unto his Fathers Castle, there was a Maid, who
under a Country habit made show of a wonderful beauty, all those that had
seen her reported of her, but with admiration, which made blind desires breed
in this Gentleman's mind, whereof the passage seemed too full of sulphur so
susc^ptible it was of this secret fire. he who sailed on the Sea of
sensuality, seeking but fair Rocks whereon to make notable Shipwracks, failed
not to transport his eyes fraught with curiosity on this rare object, which in
a moment fills him with a thousand flames, and that which flattereth his design
is the facility of conquering her, who was reputed to be no less chaste then
fair; but he was of opinion, that if he could not charm her mind by fained
words, yet the powder of gold would make her sensible of his torment, and bring
her to his will.

He settles himself then on this pursuit, tending to no other end, but to
content his bruitest appetite at the cost and charge of the honor of this Maid,
whom for her invincible and glorious chastity we will name Castule. But as all
the deceipts wherewith evil spirits entertain Sorcerers, do vanish away at
the appearing of the day, so before this Star of beauty and honesty all
Zotiques illusions were as Candles in the presence of the Sun: She shut her
ears like an Aspe to the voice of this Inchanter, it was not so much through
dullness of wit, as through subtle prudence that she avoided this Man's
encounter as much as in her lay, knowing that the talk of the wicked does
breed gnawing Ulcers in the souls of those that give ear unto them:
Notwithstanding, Zotique whose fire was increased through difficulties, judged
by the small means he found to speak unto her, that it was not through want
of wit, nor Country stupidity, that she answered not his discourses, for by
her short replies, she showed her dexterity and wisdom, which surpassed the
ordinary, both of her age and condition: In fine, having used the words,
gestures, and other artificial tricks of a seducer, to as little purpose as
if he had cast his discourses into the wind, he would then employ the great
engine for battery, gold and presents, but he met with a courage resembling the
sea, who vomiteth up unto her borders all the wealth that shipwracks have left
floating on her waves.

If he be esteemed happy in holy scripture, who has preserved himself clean
from all spots, who has not run after gold, nor settled his hopes on
treasures: what glory shall we give unto this maid, who in an estate rather
abject than mean, and in the frailty of a weak sex, could trample under foot
that gold wherewith the greatest monarchs make their Crowns. Truly she is a
strong woman, whose price ought to be sought for unto the farthest and
extremest parts of the earth, if there be any price worthy of a chaste soul,
which the Wiseman sets above all esteem. Zotique no less stung by the
virtues, than by the beauty of this Castule, after he had felt the rages that
evil love is wont to breed in the souls which it possesses, in fine changed
this impure flame into one more holy, but not less vehement: the dishonest
illusions that had troubled his imagination, separated themselves from his
mind, and seeing that he could have no access unto the possession of
Castule, but by way of matrimony, he resolved to prefer virtue before
nobility and riches, seeing that Nobility is but a ray or beam, or rather a
reward of virtue, and riches are her Servants. Whilst he hatches his designs
in his heart, he covers them as close as possible he could, knowing that once
vented they would find invincible obstacles; he declares them notwithstanding
to his dear adversary, in whose credence he found so little place, that
although he spoke very sincerely, and from the very bottom of his soul, yet
he could never persuade her that which he desired she should hold for an
oracle: he had beaten her ears with false oaths and vain protestations,
wherewith he used to guild over his former deceits, he had tempted her courage
by promises, by offers, by presents, in brief, he had so many ways testified
his intent and desire of her undoing, that when he began a lawful and
honorable suit, his discourses were taken for traps, and his oaths for
snares, or to be as the little pipe wherewith foulers call or entice silly
birds to their destruction. This is it which deceivers and liers gain, to cast
all persons into mistrust of their faith, and not to be believed when they
speak truth.

Now is Zotiqu^ in a perplexity, which may better be imagined than described,
and little wanted he of despair, seeing all passages shut, both lawful and
unlawful, to arive unto the end of his pretensions. Having thus lost all
credence with froward Castule, she shunned him no less when he spoke freely,
honestly, and with good intent, than when he cogg'd, flattered, lied, and
intended ill. He then resolved to speak unto her by the mouth of another,
unto whom she might give some manner of credit: he found none fitter in his
conceit, than a servant of his named Anastasius, and son of a farmer, who was
tenant unto his father: the wit, the courage, and the fidelity of this young man
were so well known unto him by experience, that he could have no reason to
doubt thereof. To him he uttered his mind, and set out his passion unto such a
point of extremity, as it seemed the possession of Castule was to be the
beginning of his life, or the privation of her to be the end thereof; conjuring
him, that if he loved the preservation of that life, he should assist him in
that enterprise. He further declares freely the intent he once had to undo
her; the art, promises, and presents which to that end he had employed, and how
all had done as arrows shot against a rock, turned back their points, and
that since he has had modester and juster thoughts, to desire to marry her,
but that his savage mind had started back from this proposition, which
notwithstanding might be so advantageous unto her, that therefore he had need
of his help to persuade this maid not to ruin her own good fortune, but to
receive more graciously the occasion which with a smiling countenance presents
it self unto her. Hitherto Zotique was heard with patience; but as it is a
hard matter to keep constantly in one sort of language, when there is
dissimulation in the mind, which makes liers often cut themselves in their
speeches; at last blackness and smoke appeared in the fire, which this Lover
had said to be so clear, when as he sought to induce Anastasius to help him
in his unjust pretense, assuring hi^ that if he could not conquer Castule that
way, he would then betake himself to that of marriage; Anastasius amassed at
this vari^tion, protested that his life and all that little means he had, was
at his service, but for his honor he would share it with no man. And who
attempts unto your honor, says Zotique? What Sir, replied Anastasius, are you
blinded even unto this point, as not to see what kind of practice you desire I
should employ my self in? the respect I owe unto your quality retains me
from speaking otherwise, and stifles the words in my mouth: if I had thought
you would have conceived so bad an opinion of my fidelity, you should never
have been my Master.

Then dissembling Zotique, who could alter and change himself like the
Pourcountrell or Prekefish, as if he had awakened from a sound sleep, said, My
dear Anastasius, pardon my passion, thou know that this tyrant over reason
leaves not a man's judgment free; it is true that I have loved Castule
otherwise than honesty would permit, but I have since purified my desires, my
flame is now irreprehensible, since it is fuel is the pretense of a lawful
marriage, and herein do I pray thee to assist me; it is an emploiment so
glorious, that the greatest lords do hold it an honor to bear the message
thereof, seeing it is honorable in all those that contract it, and those that
treat it. Sir, said Anastasius, I esteem nothing base but what is unjust and
shameful; there is nothing so abject but I will embrace to do you service, I
will follow you on foot, I will dress your horses, I will dress your meat, I
will til your land, my birth is not such, but that I may hold it an honor to
be borne your subject, but acts contrary to honesty will I never do, and
should it cost me my life, for I had rather die with honor on my brow, than to
live with ignominy: but seeing you do me the favor as to discover your
thoughts truly unto me, I am not so void of sense as not to distinguish
between the actions that proceed from passion, and those that proceed from
reason; and as the former deserve compassion, being diseases of the mind, the
later shall be followed by my obedience; and if you will permit me to represent
unto you that which is conformable to reason, I believe I shall do nothing
contrary to your service. Trust me Sir, I will say nothing against the virtue
of the beauty, nor against the beauty of the virtue of this wise maid, for that
were the way wilfully to offend truth, and wrong your judgment, which would not
have made choice of that mistress to settle your affection upon, if you had
not found qualities fitting. I will not speak of the condition of her birth, her
want of means, and the inequality betwixt you, for although all this be, yet
love has hoodwinkt you so as you perceive it not; and beside, it is the
property of this passion, to unite equals, and to equal the unequal: if you
were free and independent of any but your self, it were easy for you to pass
over all these considerations, and to that as fittest that were most pleasing,
but if you think on this, that you depend on another, and that you are in the
subjection of your father, whose will ought to be to you an inviolable law, and
that his consent will never accommodate it self to your desire in this match,
I am sure you will cast water on your fire, and that the boiling heat of your
love will be, if not quite cooled, yet at least something slackt: Then think
thereon, good Sir, if there remain any spark of light in your understanding,
and by an inconsiderate ardour, which passion will presently quench, do not
overrhrow your fortunes, which depend on a better match, and on the advantages
which you may hope for from the goodness of your father. Moreover, you may
judge with what success both for you and me, I may deal in an obscure
negotiation, I will not say unlawful, for that would I not do for any thing,
but I mean that will be hidden from your parents, and that cannot appear
without putting you into disgrace with them, or loss of life, you know the
severe humor of my Lord Fleuranval, that whether this matter come to
perfection or no, if he know that I have meddled therein in the manner that you
desire, and not acquainted him therewith, nothing will stay him from cutting me
in pieces, since that power and authority make a thunderbolt which reduces
into ashes all that it touches: but for my part the matter is not great, being
that an escape away may shelter me from this tempest, and that I may by a
voluntary exile buy a service which may be acceptable unto you, your interest
touches me more than my own; if you pass forward secretly into this
marriage, your father has power enough to force you to a divorce, then will an
honorable maid be undone and defamed by my procurement: if you accomplish it
openly, and against his will, he will surely dis-inherit you. You know his
austere humor, which will become inflexible, being backed by humane law, that
permits parents in this sort to punish their disobedient children, then are you
one of the poorest and unfortunatest gentlemen of this Province, whereas
remaining dutiful you may be one of the richest: My friend, said Zotique, I am
not resolved to contend with thee in this, I have the Sun flat in my face,
defending as thou do the cause of reason, whose force I cannot resist: thou
resemblest those who from battlements of a wall need do no more but let stones
fall on them that are below, all the advantage is on thy side, I have none on
mine but passion, whose weakness is apparent: use me therefore like a sick
man, and not like one that is in health, bear with my infirmity and condemn
me not till thou art as well stung to the quick as I am; this is all that I
can reply to thy allegations, if I had a quarrel thou might be my second,
without searching so exactly whether right were on my side or no, for so it is
that one friend should help another, and not spend time in reasons, which
under outward appearances do witness a hidden refusal and decay of friendship:
let me see then if thou will help me in the state wherein I am, without
standing upon so many circumstances, which kill me in stead of convincing me,
and raise up my spirits, rather than abate them. Master, replied Anastasius,
Cooks are bound to dress their meats according to the taste of those whom
they serve, provided that it be not wholly depraved; for to present them dishes
of meats corrupted and spoiled, that were not to serve with fidelity, but to
undo, under show of obsequiousness. Nevertheless they must sometime refrain
from presenting unto licorish palates meats hurtful unto health, in hope that
their strength and appetite will reduce all to good nutriment: it shall be to
please you, rather than to serve, that I will go about this employment,
whereunto your absolute comm and does thrust me; and I entreat you that your
repentance, which I foresee, may not cause my disgrace with you, since
following therein your will, and not my own, I shall not so much be author as
partner of your misery. This is all that I can desire of thee, my dear
Anastasius, said Zotique, go then, put the irons into the fire of thy
persuasions, and make me no replies, but remember that as thou servest me in
this, I will at my death procure unto thee that which shall be for thy
advancement. Anastasius who knew with whom he had to do, went forward with
this commerce with so much prudence and discretion, that he purchased all the
credence that he could desire in the mind of Castule, as there was more
likeness in their states and conditions, so this maid, who though chaste, was
neither insensible froward, nor disdainful, avoided not his approach with so
much art as she did that of Zotique, for the shepherdess who gathering a
garland in a field, meets with a serpent lying among the flowers, starteth
not back with more fear and sadness, than she did when this gentleman under
his flowred words hid the aspe of his bad designs: yet she began to take
another opinion upon the faith of An^stasius, who spoke with so much ingenuity
of the honorable passions of his master, that flattered by his natural
inclination (which each one has to advance their fortune as high as they can)
her looks were no more so harsh toward Zotique, already mildness had
tempered her countenance and courage, when Zotique seeing a calm appear after
the tempest past, did as Mariners (return to their old insolent customs)
after the storm which had drawn from their mouths so many prayers and vows,
and so hard a thing it is to loose or hide an evil nature that he returned to
his vomit, I mean to his bad pretenses wherein he imitated the Lizard or Newt
which raceth out with her tail, the marks which with her hands she printed in
the sand: as long as honesty, respect, and Justice were in his words,
Anastasius served him with as much loyalty as he could expect of a faithful
servant, and Castule heard him with an ear as chaste as his discourses were
honorable, but when the stink of the smoke had discovered his bad fire, he
had no greater adversary then Anastasius, nor nothing more contrary then
Castule, for this young man quite turning his style when his Master had strayed
from the right way of virtue, began to cry out against his inconstancy in the
ears of this Maid, and to give her counsel as a Man no less jealous of her
chastity, then he had formerly shown himself desirous of her honorable
advancement.

Castule who had still kept the Bridle in her own hands as a wise maid ought
to do and who by a prudent mistrust had still held as suspicious the
protestations of Zotique seeing that Anastasius changed his note said unto him.
I believe Anastasius that you have no part in the treachery of Zotique, since
you detest it so openly, with directions to give vent unto his mind, which
tended to the overthrow of ny Reputation. And truly as my obligation unto you
is great, for foreseeing to procure my good so long as you thought he desired
me for his lawful Wife, so that which I owe you for giving me notice of his
intended surprises can be no less, being he who preserves honor, does more
than he that preserves life; this favor shall never die in my memory where I
will carefully feed the remembrance of your Virtue which does abhor all that
tend to a dishonest end: Anastasius no less admiring the good with then the
fair face of this beautiful creature, besides the eye of respect wherewith he
had ever beheld her, when he treated with her of the just affections of Zotique
he opened that of love, but of a love entirely pure, and borne twins with a
holy jealousy of the protection of her integrity.

Anastasius not content then to have discovered unto her the treacherous
designs of Zotique, who would have seduced her under the promise of Marriage,
or by a secret one which he would have disavowed or denied, with the same
impudency as he excused himself in play whenever he was surprised in his
tricks, discovered likewise unto her the new inclinations of his own soul,
which were kept back by the pretenions of Zotique all the while he thought them
to be Just: In the same sort as the presence of a Dyamond does suspend the
effect of the Lodestone upon Iron. Whether it be that Marriages are written in
heaven before they be made on earth, or that a natural sympathy met in these
two souls they found themselves united before they perceived the bonds of
their union, for Castule without respecting scornefully the offers of good will
which Anastasius made her with so much ingenuity, acknowledged them with a
mutual corespondency, much more esteeming the affection of a virtuous poor
man, then of a vicious Gentleman, wherein she showed no less her worthy
courage, by despising riches in vice, then by esteeming Virtue in poverty, even
then did they knit betwixt them a perfect knot of affection; And Anastasius
being assured of the reciprocal love that Castule bore him, became not more
insolent by this good encounter, but made it serve him as a spur to become
more complete, that he might preserve by merit, that which good hap had
purchased him. And as she promised to love him honorably and solely, so he
swore unto her afidelity and protestation inviolable, protesting as he would
never envy her a better fortune, if it presented it self unto her beauty, so
he would employ as freely his blood and life, to keep her from the violence,
and deceit of those, that by bad ways would attempt unto her honor.

As their pain increased daily by their Communication so the impure fire of
Zotique increasing unmeasurably became insufferable, he enters into a desperate
rage, and doubting that he was betrayed by Anastasius, this suspiton alters his
countenance toward him, the faithful servant se^i^g that his Master looked on
him with an eye, far diff^rent from the former look, took occasion one day to
say unto him as follows. Sir they deserve not to be well counseled, who
would have those that give them good counsel, to warrant them the events
thereof, for loyalty and prudence are those that frame good friends, but the
success depends on Fortune, who to authorize her self at the costs of virtue
which she hates, delights in overturning that which she undertakes: if you
see not your designs succeed according to your desires, it is not the defect
of my diligence, nor of my loyalty; you have seen that when you spoke
honorably, you were heard favorably, why do you find it strange, to be
rejected since you have changed your style and your humor? as long as your
thoughts were chaste, I have served you with integrity, and you have tasted
some fruit of my industry in the favorable entertainment received from
Castule: but when she sees that you turn into your old track, if she shun you,
and show you no good countenance, if she repulse you, what does she therein but
as a discreet maid (who has her honor in estimation) ought to do? and truly
as I have counseled her to hear you, when I believed you beheld her with the
eye of a husband, and you treated with her in honorable terms, if I were now
of her counsel I would persuade her to abhor your proceedings which tend to
her ruin; but she is prudent enough and jealous enough of her renoune to let
you have noe hold on her as long as you deal with her at fire and sword; I
mean as with a creature whom you would undo, I do not believe that of so bad
a seed you can reap better then repulses: what said Zotique, in a chafe, I
see then it is by your advice, that she arms her eyes with disdain, and her
courage with rigor.

Sir replied Anastasius, it not my advice which leads her to that, but the
force of virtue which is well-ankored in her soul, and as she is far wiser
then I, so I believe she will use you more rigorously then if I counseled her,
she avoyds your company for fear you should alter the purity of her mind, by
some impressions contrary to honesty, and that your frequentation, although
exempt from evil should wither her reputation; and this you call rigor, and
disdain, because you are pleased to name her actions according to the conceit
of your passion, and not according to the Motions which produce them in her: it
is a natural thing to fly from evil, and shun those that seek to deprive
us of goods, honor, or life, that if this flight be guilty, the guilt is in
nature, which printed these inclinations in all minds; as for me I promised to
be faithful, so long as you should have honor before your eyes, but if you
play banckrupt with it, the infidelity will be honorable that shall cross you
in your designs, I will be loyal unto my Master, but where there is wrong
done to honor, there must be no more talk of service, although Zotique had no
just cause to be offended with so bold a remonstrance, nevertheless* he did
like those barbarous people, who shot Arrows against the Sun, when the rays
thereof being too hot scorch their backs, he entered highly into choler against
Anastasius, outragiously abusing him with injurious words, and threats, (and as
he was surly and apt to strike) little wanted of blows, among other things in
this fit he told him, he was very presumptuous to use such discourse to his
Master; not remembering that he is truly a slave who lets himself be
mastered by his passions, and he rightly free who has reason for his
Mistress; he added further that he took him to serve him, but not as a
Schole-master, and that he was willing to have him speak unto him as a
servant, but not as a Corrector: O poor young man whose soul is full of
wounds, and yet flies the hand that dresses them, and hates the salves of his
cure, even so do many Masters take upon them, not considering that Servants
are humble friends, who may very well put those they serve in mind of their
duty, otherwise Kings should never receive instructions from their subjects,
nor great persons be so admonished by the lesser, at least servants may be put
in the (rank of neighbors. Truly of all sorts of Maladies those are most
deplorable which fly their remedies, and scoff at the Physicians directions,
for what can a man do unto those that think themselves in health, and will not
be healed? Is it not true that of all Fools he is most fool, that thinks
himself wise? such a one may Zotique be said to be, since that being carried
away by the folly of his passion, he yet thinks he has reason to reprehend
him, that seeks to acquit him of his frenzy; altoough it were only choler that
blind and inconsiderate motion, which spoke through the mouth of Zotique, yet
to end this insolent sally suffered with incredible patience by Anastasius he
must be put away, in reward of his service and for speaking the truth, with
no less sincerity then modesty. Truly they are unworthy ever to meet with
good servants, which so ill acknowledge their fidelity, advancing none but such
as serve or flatter them in their vices, like unto those Figge-trees that grow
in the top of a dangerous steep cliffe whose fruit is eaten by filthy birds,
but never by reasonable creatures.

Anastasius was very glad to be rid of serving a bad matter, but when he went
to take his leave of Zotiques Father for to retire himself home unto his own,
the Lord of Fleuranval who had put him to his son and knew his deserts,
retained him to wait on himself in his Chamber: this Father had already smelt
something of his sons passion for Castule, which much troubled his brain,
intending not that by any means his blood should be mixed with the blood of a
Country Wench such as Castule was esteemed to be, and therefore was he very
glad to retain Anastasius to penetrate further into the matter by his
instructions, but he behaved himself reservedly and with so much Prudence,
that no whit exasperating the Father aginst the son, he satisfied the
curiosity of the one without prejudice to the other: mean time he continues
his honest intelligence with Castule, and advertising her of the enterprises of
his Masters son he gave her means to avoid them? Zotique whose fire was
come to the last degree of it is violence, strives by extreme means to attain
unto his pretentions, he who daily cheated in gaming, made no great conscience
prodigally to spend oaths, thereby to gain entrance for his persuasions into
the credence of Castule, but she had so much precaution against these
allurements that her heart was inpregnable to these attempts, fear and
distrust served as a fortress and buckler against Zotiques letters, which were
as many promises of marriages to dazzle her by this fair hope, she opposed
thereunto the antidotes which were suggested into her by the council of
Anastasius; In fine, the excess of Zotiques love grew to that pass, that it
made him bear himself openly a servant unto Castule, and he said plainly,
that he would either have her for his wife, or never marry. Here now is the
father more troubled than ever, and resolved to hinder the match by all manner
of ways: what natural severitie soever be in a father, it is always
indulgent for his child, he has ever a secret advocate in the heart of his
father, who pleads there his cause, and obtains him sentence of absolution.
Although all the fault be in Zotique, whose passion raises reason from his
bounds, and cannot be excused but by the excess of his love; nevertheless his
father casts it all I know not how upon Castule, who indeed is the cause, but
innocently, in the same manner as the Rock is cause of the ships splitting, but
the tempest or small skill of the Pilot are causes of the wrack. We always
excuse the faults of those that appertain unto us, and whatsoever they do we
believe it with reason, or that they have bin surprised.

If the Lord of Fleuranval had taken time to see Castule, or to talk with her,
I assure my self he might have seen even innocence in her face, and through
the modesty of her words, her prudence would have shined; but seeing her only
by the eyes of others, and not knowing her but by false reports, he takes her
for a tatling subtle huswife, who makes a trophy of his sons affection, and
by her allurements and charms keeps him in his dotage. And although
Anastasius assure the contrary, yet his mind pre-occupated by a good forecast,
since it is not the part of a wise man to say I had not thought, he deals with
the Magistrates, and draws them to forbid Castule to pretend any thing in the
marriage of Zotique, nor to suffer his suit unto her. No sooner comes this
sentence to the knowledge of this maid, but she protests to wish for nothing of
Zotique, but to be delivered from his importunate pursuits, entreaing that this
act of justice may be signified unto him, to the end he might refrain his
insolent ^^llicitings. For the reverence due to the Magistrate, she renounceth,
viva voce, and by writing, all claim or pretense to this marriage, whereof
through humility she declares her self unworthy. Although that if virtue were
esteemed according to its worth, she deserved a better match. Zotique has
likewise his share in this sentence, whereat he scoffs, according to the
ordinary custom of youth and nobility; chiefly of great ones, who laugh at the
formalities of justice, knowing that laws are but spider-webs, which stay but
the smallest flies, and are rent by the big ones. Contrariwise, as there is
nothing that stingeth the mind like contradiction, nor that provokes desire
so much as forbidding, this sentence was as oil on the fire, and glorying in
his shame, I mean his rebellion to the magistrate, and disobedience to his
father, he leaves no means unattempted, to attain to the end of his
pretensions, and still talks of marriage, as being a fair and lawful gate to
pass through unto his design.

The father seeing this madness possess the soul of his son, casts the
cause thereof on the charms of Castule, publishing that she has enchanted
him; and indeed if he had taken beauty and virtue for enchantments, he had had
the more reason to think so, seeing there is nothing which so much charmeth
souls: but he takes it in an ill way, and says that she deals in magic, so
little does he know the sincerity and simplicity of this maid. Mean time, as
there is no wound so slight but serves for exercise unto surgeons, so there is
no pretext so weak, but may yield great employment to magistrates and
officers. The Lord Fleurenvall by right of neighborhood was very familiarly
acquainted with the Lord of the place where Castule made her abode, he makes
him become susceptible of his opinion, and partaker in his cause: Castule is
taken, and without being heard, or any other manner of proceeding, is cast into
prison. Thus must innocence groan under setters, whilst the guilty go free
through the world: since the providence of heaven does so ordain it, we ought
to adore his government, and not murmr there^^. But here is a slippery step,
If one consider that Zotique commits faults, and Castule bears the punishment
thereof, the wife is shut up, and the mad is left in the liberty of his
desires, the sentence pardons ravens, and lays hold on doves, how then may it
be said that innocence is a wall of brass, and a strong buckler against all
the malices of this world, since you see the poor afflicted, whilst the
wicked holds up his head gloriously. But iron is never cleaner than when it
comes out of the furnace, nor brighter than when it has been under the sharp
teeth of the file, the sun never shines clearer, than when it comes from under
a cloud, the coal that has been covered with ashes is thereby hotter and
quicker: Although innocence be shaded in the obscurity of prisons, yet
nevertheless she comes out in triumph, radiating with glory. All the fault of
Castule was in the false opinion of the Lord of Fleurenval: notwithstanding her
imprisonment is diversely censured by the judgments of the world, every one
has liberty to speak his mind thereof, but it touched Zotique and Anastasius
to the quick, yet very differently, and truly the difference must be drawn
out of the variety or rather contrariety of their affection, and the more
that of Anastasius was sincere and honest, the more smarting ought to be his
pain; nevertheless he represses it in his heart, and veiles it with a modest
silence, which makes it the sharper, in the same manner as fire redoubles its
heat, being restrained within a furnace. Whereas Zotique thunders flashes,
threatens, makes a great stir, but in fine he imitates the sea, which after
much storm and tempest leaves but a little froth in its borders. Anastasius
makes less noise, but more fruit, for privately visiting the judge who had
caused her to be apprehended, he remon strates unto him the injustice of his
proceedings, having begun ^ cause, by the execution only to follow the passion
of an erroneous opinion, rather than equity, he casts fears into his
conscience, which made him repent himself of his decree, and seek ^eanes to
blot out his fault, without dis-obliging those that had made him commit it.

It is good reason to dissuade those that fear the face of great men, and that
are subject to be touched with favor, not to take upon them any office of
judicature, lest they should commit scandalous and unjust actions through
weakness, rather than malice. Who has ever seen a weak vessel tossed at
one time on the sea by two contrary storms, looking still to be overwhelmed
and swallowed up under the waves, he has seen this judge betwixt the commands
of his lord and the Lord Fleuranval, and the threats of Zotique, the least
whereof are to cut him in pieces, and to make his hounds and hawks eat him. As
it is easier to commit an injustice, than to maintain it, so it is easier to
commit a fault in the administration of justice, than to amend it; and prisons
are like ships, not so easy to get out of, as to enter into. It is not without
reason, that the sacred Scripture threatens the mighty to be mightily
tormented, because that here on earth they have committed great tyrannies: in
the countries far from the Princes sovereign justice, thousands of violences
pass, which would be rigorously punished, if they came unto the knowledge of
the dreadful tribunals, little ones sob under the oppression of the great, and
although overwhelmed with wrongs, they dare not so much as complain in their
sufferings; but the Eternal says he will rise up because of the misery of
the poor, ^and the groans of the oppressed. Whilst Anastasius covertly
sollicites the delivery of Castule, and that the judge who had so highly
decreed her imprisonment, finds no witness in the information, which accuse
her so much as of the shadow of this black diabolical crime of magic,
whereof she is accused by the author of her imprisonment, he says openly he
will set her at liberty, and in effect preferring the discharge of his
conscience, before the favor of his Lord, he signs her enlargement: but the
bird is taken, and the keys of the cage being in the hands of the master of
the manor, she is retained by force. Whereunto Zotique is resolved to oppose
his strength, since it is permitted by all laws, to repulse one violence by
another. Whilst he prepares himself to this project, Anastasius, whose eye
was every where, watches so narrowly, that he discovers an evil plot by a
stinking match; Zotique under the cloak of justice will commit an execrable
act, he resolves to draw this maid out of prison, with the assistance of the
Provost marshal, and works so well with some of his archers, that they promise
to put her into his power, as soon as they had gotten her out. You may
imagine, if in that heat which consumed him, he would not have gathered by
fair means or foul, that which he so impatiently desired.

Anastasius seeing that this stroke tended to the ruin of her whom he held so
dear, and being not able to oppose it by force, sought by prudence to put it
back, he goes straight to the Provost Marshall, who had no part in this
pernicious project, and having prayed him to contribute his power to the
deliverance of this innocent prisoner, he further conjures him not to take her
out of one misery and leave her in a greater, and desires him to be as much
protector of her honesty, as of her innocence: which the Provost promised him
on his honor, and effected it as an officer should do that acquits himself
worthy of his charge. Nevertheless it was not without difficulty, because that
the Lord who retained Castule in the prison of his castle, would not suffer the
visit of a Provost therein: yet on the other side he feared to become guilty by
so manifest a rebellion against justice, to avoid the one and the other, he
resolved to deliver her up willingly at the gate of his house, but it was there
where the Provost had something to do, for to combat the disloyalty of his
own followers, who had promised to deliver this prey into the hands of
Zotique, from whom they had received gifts: but the protector of innocence and
purity sent his help in tribulation, because that the number of the Catchpoles
which were free from this combination, were found to be greater than those that
were corrupted, they could not perform their wicked promise.

The Provost put this maid safe into the hands of her father, who was a
husbandman: but the poor man fearing the plots and violence of Zotique, had by
the counsel of Anastasius entreated a great Lady therabouts to take his
daughter into her protection. This was the sacred sanctuary where this Virgin
sheltred her self, experiencing the truth of this, that he who hopes in the
help of our Lord shall find an assured protection, and a city of refuge, he
will deliver him from the hunters snares, and will hide him under the shadow of
his wings; his truth shall cover him as a buckler, and plagues shall not approach
his dwelling.

Now does Zotiques fury turn into madness, because that having no more
access unto Castule, nor hope to see her, much less to get her into his
power, he knows not what remedies to apply unto his smarting burns: We must
confess, that when passion begins to lose hope, it causes strong convulsions
in the mind; This man forgets the respect he ought to bear unto that
honorable Lady in whose house Castule had sheltred her self, and threatens to
put her house and all to fire and sword, if he be not permitted to see and
converse with this maid. The Lady complains to the Lord of Fleurenval, of his
sons insolency. The father, whose severity was sufficiently known, promises
her to take such order with him, as she should have cause to be contented, and
to rest free from fear. He arrests Zotique and imprisons him in one of the
chambers of his Castle: It was there where this fond young man had time to
digest his liquor, as the saying is, and to take upon him other exercises than
of play, women, and feasts; he found his father to be rough, a gamester that
his cheating tricks auailed nothing against him; in lieu of his conversation
amongst companies to champe on the bridle in a solitary place, and in lieu of
good cheer he has but the water of tears, and the bread of sorrow: what
repentance soever he showed, the fathe rrelinquisht nothing of his austerity,
prudently judging that he sung this song only to get out of the cage, and that
he wouId soon change his note, if he could recover the liberty of the air.
During this imprisonment, which lasted three or four months, there happened unto
Castule a fortune, by so much the more admirable, as it was wholly unhoped for.

There died in Touraine a certain gentlewoman whom we will call Martiniane:
she was something an ancient maid, and in full possession of all her estate,
she made her will, and thereby declared, how in her fathers life time she had
contracted a secret or clandestine marriage with a young man of Britany, who
though a younger brother and poor, yet a very complete gentleman; how by him
she had Castule, whom by a very trusty person she had caused to be conveyed out
of the country, and brought up by a husbandman of Perch; how that her said
husband died in Britany: she says also, how that since the death of her father
shame had retained her from declaring this truth: and withal, rehearses all
the circumstances necessary for the finding out and knowing this daughter, and
declares her her heir; and in default of her leaves all to an hospital. She
made executor of this her will a certain Clergyman of her own kindred, a man
of good life and great authority, who took a journey expressly into Perch, that
there with his own, and not with others eyes he might seek out this maid, by
the signs and tokens given him he came into the house of this good
husbandman, who had thitherto been taken for the father of Castule, he
acknowledged that at such a time such a manner of man had delivered unto him a
little girl of such an age, clothed in such a manner, and such marks: and
further showed bracelets of gold, with certain ciphers or characters on them,
and said how he had received a good sum of money for the bringing of her up,
with promise of a greater if he did preserve her carefully. All this was found
conformable to that which Martiniane had said on her death bed, and had also
declared in her will. From thence he went unto the castle where then Castule
made her residence, and found on her face so many features of resemblance unto
those of the deceased gentle woman, that he doubted no more of that truth
which struck into his eyes, he receives her then as his pupil, and having
largely rewarded the husbandman who had kept her so long, he prepares to lead
her into Tourain, there to take possession of the fair inheritance that was
befallen, which was held to amount unto the worth of 20000 French crowns. This
wonder being divulged, and come to the knowledge of Zotique and of his father,
it made even then the filme to fall from their eyes, and the one wish to have
Castule for his daughter in law, and the other to desire her for his wife.

But whether it were that this new fortune had puffed up the courage of this
generous maid, or whether it were that she had a just indignation against the
father, who had caused her to be imprisoned as a sorceresse, and against the
son who had solicited her with so much insolency, and attempted so often and
so impudently against her honor, she would never give ear to this match.
Then did Zotique reconcile himself to Anastasius, conjuring him to use his
best means, and employ his credit toward Castule to get her to like of his
suit. And truly this faithful servant failed no whit in his duty, being as
desirous of Castules advancement, as of Zotiques good, he labored to persuade
her to give ear thereunto, alleging the ancient nobility and great estate of
the house of Fleurenval, and besides all that, the extreme affection of
Zotique toward her, whereof, said he, she should expect no less than all
manner of good usage: but he was so far from furthering any thing therein, that
Castule had nothing so frequent in her mouth, as the detestation of cheating,
and other defects which defamed the reputatiof Zotique. And as Anastasius found
not that as he sought, he unawares met with that which was not in his thought
to seek. For wealth was so far from altering the heart of Castule, or from
making her forget the promise which she had made, to love him inviolably, that
contrariwise her color rising, and likewise her voice, even to a tone which
witnessed the true thought of her soul, she said unto him, How now
Anastasius, what find you in me unworthy or unpleasing since fortune smiles
on me, has wealth changed my face or my manners? do you take the words of a
maid for the wagging of a leaf? and will you who have so often blamed the false
oaths of Zotique, make me guilty of the like sin? are those which I have
made unto you of an inviolable love vanished out of your memory? why pitiless
of your self do you forget your own cause, to embrace that of a traitor, who
has caused me a 1000. harms? what have I done so displeasing to your eyes,
that Ishuld now be nothing unto you? truly as far as I see, unconstancy is a
blame not unworthily laid upon the humor of men, since it is their nature so
to be. And will you Anastasius, whose faith I esteemed as a rock, be in the
number of the rest? as for my part, I am still the same for you as I was, the
change of my state has not changed my will, I have so deeply engraven in my
soul the remembrance of so many notable obligations whereof I stand indebted
to you, that I behold you, not merely as a man, but as a tutelary Angel since
you have been both my liberator and guardian of my integrity, preserving me
from the Ambushes and violencies of barbarous Zotique.

She would have proceeded further when Anastasius kneeling down and taking her
by the hand, which he watered with tears, and said with a trembling voice,
interrupted by fears and sobs, from whencesoever this discourse proceeds it is
able to kill me suddenly with grief or joy, with the one if it be fained, with
the other if it be true; if it be the first the trial is very violent, if
the second, I confess as weak brains cannot bear much wine, so my heart is
not strong enough to bear so great felicity, the change of your fortune had
made loose my hope of attaining unto your affection, but had not taken from me
the inviolable desire of your good, therefore seeing some equality betwixt you
and Zotique, I wished you Mistress of that house, to spend my days in the
rank of your domestical servants: no further did the bounds of my ambition
reach, but since you raise it up even unto your self, by a bounty beyond
example, I were unworthy to be lighted by the brightness of your eyes, if the
mists of my births obscurity, cleared not under so favorable aspects, and
though I were but a weak vapor if I raised not my self up as high, as it
pleases the rays of your favors to elevate me.

But is it possible that so much constancy should be found in you, and that in
so great a change of estate you have not affected a change, and that wealth
has not altered the integrity of your affections? O soul far above ordinary,
you show unto the world how all that which is called greatness, is far below
your thoughts, he had followed that point longer if excess of joy had not made
him loose breath, and from thence borne him into a swoone, and indeed as great
sorrows are mute, so likewise are excessive joys, only mean ones permit the
use of senses, or speech because they may be felt and expressed, whereas others
do astonish the mind, and dull or benum the feeling, when Castule it may be
by bathing his face in the water of her tears, had fetched him from his
trance, she confirmed unto him that which she had said before, and made him
new protestations of love: but of a love tending to Marriage: if Anastasius had
not been very prudent doubtless letting himself go on the wings of the
wind, his heart had soared up into some vanity which would have wrought
destruction, as well as that of Icarus, but he imitated wise Pilots who strik
half their Sails, when the wind is to strong for fear lest the Ship should
overturne, this love must by all means be kept close from the care of the new
Guardian, till such time as Castule had been in Touraine and taken possession
of what was befaine her by the will of her Mother, which done, and she
stablished therein, she promised to send for Anastasius to give him the
possession of her estate and person a reward of her fidelity, and honesty, and
it was so done; noe sooner did the new star appear on the Horizon of Touraine,
but her rays struck into the eyes of diverse Astrologers, I mean of diverse
Suitors, who would gladly have had her for the ascendant of their fortunes
nativity, but the horoscop destinated her for Anastasius, to whom under hand
she conveyed means to fit himself of all things like a Gentleman, and so to
become a suitor as the rest, and having wrought the mind of her guardian to this
point, that of all those that sought her good will, he would leave her at
liberty to take her own choice, since nothing ought to be more free from
compulsion than marriage, she gave her voice to Anastasius, who thus saw
himself preferred before many Tourengeaux who beheld not without envy the good
fortune of this stranger.

When the Guardian understood how infinitely his Pupil was obliged unto
Anastasius, in lieu of growing angry at the unequality of the party, he
praised the prudence and Justice of this maid, who though she could not more
worthily reward him, that had preserved heramidst so many hazards then in
giving herself to him: now with what ear Zotique heard the tidings of this
marriage I leave unto the consideration of him, who will represent unto
himself, the rage of his love converted into that of wr^th. Notwithstanding
time the Sovereign Physician of the souls diseases, will moderate all his
pains, and his Father having married him else where he lost in this new match
the reme^berance of his old flames; mean time Anastasius who of a fathfull
servant was become a Master, might rightly term himself a good Artist, who
had wrought his own good fortune, and that only by the means of virtue,
whereof he was become so constant a partaker, and to say truth it is good to
hold with virtue, for although her way be enclosed with thorns, yet it ends
in Roses, and early or late, Fortune is constrained to stoop her ensign before
her, and acknowledge her self vanquished, the Sun may be obscured by clouds,
but never extinguished, disasters may cross or rather give an exercise to
virtue, but never stifle it, it resembles the Vine which profits by it is
cutting, and the more it is beaten the less it is hurt, in my opinion the
principal thing remarkable in this History, is the honorable Infidelity of
Anastasius, who was really and truly for Zotique, as long as his pretenses were
honest, but revolted as soon as he perceived that malice had overturned the
heart of this Gentleman, and that his projects were unlawful; for if they be
blame worthy, who are faithful in evil enterprises, and make themselves
guilty of another fault, this Infidelity or disloyalty must needs be
honorable, which plays Bankrupt to evil designs.

THE FRVSTRATED INTENTIONS.
The Second Relation.
IT shall here suffice me to name the Province of Champagne, and to say that
in one of his chiefest Cities, there was a widow Lady, who having four
Children, two Sons, and two daughters, labored to bring the^ ^p in the fear
of God and good manners, and although she was left young enough with a Husband,
even at such an age as would have permitted her to m^rry, yet she would
persevere in her widowhood, and remain ^^uly a Widow, that is to say, flying
^^light and occasions of being wooed or sought ^^ter for marriage: but as it is
the common desire of (...) to advance their Families, and tor^ise their
Children unto honor, she having not power to do any thing for hers, but
preserve that whith they had, and by sparing make them feel the fruits of her
Wardship, be-thought herself by a human prudence frequent enough in families,
to destinate two of them to the Church, thereby to make the other two, richer
and greater, and more advanc^d in the world; but even as the end which is last
^^ in the execution, is first in the intention, so the intention which is first
in the thought is last in the effect, and between thinking and doing is a
great distance, the divine disposings agree not always with human purposes,
forasmuch as the East is not farther distant from the West, then the ways of
God are from the ways of men, this good woman Priscilla was led herein by the
advice of her kindred, and chiefly by a man of justice, and authority, who was
substituted to the Guardianship of her children, such are the disignes of a
subject, whose balances have a weight, but weight and balances deceiptfull
and without equality, because they make the elevation and riches of the one, by
the abasement and poverty of the other; the means of these younger children
was remarkable, for each one of their parts amounted to twenty thousand French
crowns, besides the right of the eldest (I speak as knowing the perticulars
thereof) well then the youngest brother, is d^stinated to be a Ward, a Knight
of Malta, and they stay but only until he be of age, to give him either the
Co^vle or the Cross, the younger D^ughter is pu^ into a Monastery, there to be
brought up among other little girls, with intent to make her a Nun, hoping
that she will not contradict the will of her Parents therein, as for the eldest
Daughter a great portion is promised with her, whereby she soon becomes the
object of desire unto many Suitors, as there is no beauty so great whereunto
painting may not add something to prove it; so ho^ noble, fair, and virtuous
a M^id be, yet the rich Dowry does ever augment the desire of possessing her;
among diverse Matches proffered for this eldest, one was very advantageous, and
forasmuch as the two youngest, destinated to the monestary were yet far from
the age not only of profession but of vesture, the friends durst not give in
marriage with this more then twenty thousand French Crowns which was her
assured part, and her Suitor took her with that upon the infallible hope they
gave him that he should get another like son, from the succession of those
two creatures which were to be sacrificed for the greatness of the two eldest:
they must put the younger brother into a Monastery but his humor ^uteth not
thereunto, the Cowle is too troublesome, he had rather have a sword, the Cross
of Malta does not so much dislike him but he knows not well yet what to
choose; whilst he takes time to think and deliberate thereon his Parents must
take patience. Let us now come to the youngest daughter who is the principal
subject of this relation; she makes not so much resistance but what judgment
has a Girl of some ten or eleven years of age; she is put into a Monastery
where a great Lady of Picardie is Abbess there she is brought up with intent
to make her a Nun, tenn thousand franks are promised with her part at her
vesture, the rest at her profession, this Abbess was often visited by one of
her Brothers a comely young Gentleman, but yet a younger Brother which is as
much to say as ready to catch, and who had nothing but only valor; indeed we
must grant the case of younger Brothers of quality to be deplorable, in that
they have as much courage as the eldest, as being borne of the same blood and
brought up with the same care and greatness, but the foundations fail them, and
they have not wherewithal to uphold that generosity, which is natural unto
them; therefore we commonly see, that to attain unto riches there are noe
manner of hazards whereunto they precipitate not themselves, nor any manner of
means which they attempt not for gain; this young Gentleman cast his eye upon
this Girl which was put into this Monastery, who although she were lowly
enough yet twenty thousand French crowns portion, raised as well the features
of her face as his courage, he projects on this match and acquaints his sister
therewith. She approves thereof and becomes his confederate therein, he sees
this young Gentlewoman when he will by his sisters permission: In fine, the
Brother and sister spend two or three years time on hammering of this young
Maid to work it into their fashion, and frame it unto their will, but all this
while whether through natural Antipathy or for fear of offending her parents,
this Girl whom we will call by the name Marcionille, could never firmly setle
her affections on Salve Brother to the Abbess, she knows that she is
destinated unto the Cloister, and so hard a matter it is to take from a vessel
the taste of the first liquor that was put into it, that she could not blot out
of her mind the first impressions that were put therein, yet she sees her
self betwixt the anvill and the hammer: all the letters that her mother writes
her, are so many exhortations to dispose her self to receive the veil. Mean
time the Abbess reads her a lesson of the felicity of marriage, and pleasures
of the world, representing to her the contentment she shall have with her
brother, a proper complete gentleman, who would honor and love her infinitely:
alas what could this young mind have done, tossed betwixt such different
blasts?

This Abbess made her write letters conformable unto her will, whereby she gave
her mother Priscilla to understand, that she felt her self no way inclining to
a Cloisteral life, and that she would not take upon her a yoke which she
thought her self not able to bear with honor and perseverance: That a
particular vocation was requisite thereunto, which she felt not in her self,
and that she had rather not vow, than afterward not to keep promise. These
letters, which the Abbess had dictated, she accompanied with letters of her
own, counselling Priscilla to take her daughter into the world again, because
she was no way fit for any Order whatsoever, but it were better for her to
enter into the state of marriage. That the life could not be embraced by all
persons, and none must be constrained thereunto against their will; and many
other fine reasons, as fair in show as in effect far from truth. Mean while
the time of taking the Novices Veil approaches, Priscilla requires her
daughters final resolution; the Abbess answers for her, or if she answers for
herself, it is by the organ or direction of the Abbess.

In fine one day Marcionille far from affection to Salve, pressed by her first
desire, and imagining with her self, that if she remained in that monastery,
the Abbess whose intentions she frustrated would never use her well; on the
other side foreseeing, that if she returned into her mothers house she should
there be ill handled, resolved to write at large to Priscilla, and to discover
unto her filially as unto her good mother, the true feeling of her soul, and
all the turnings and windings of her mind, entreating that if she loved her
rest, she would be pleased to put her to be in some other monastery, disavowing
all the letters which the Abbess had made her write, for to attain unto the
end which she had plotted, which was to make her marry Salve. By this letter
Priscilla discovered that there was contradiction in the city, and knew clearly
the art that had been used to win the mind of her daughter, and to lead her
into a design far wide from her intention; she conferres thereof with Isidorus
her subrogated Guardian, who advisedly as a man of affairs made a countermine
against that of the Abbess and Salve, to reduce their projects into smoke;
but in the end both his counsel and Priscilla's, and also the intentions of
the Abbess and Salve shall be turned topside-turvy. Priscilla goes to fetch
her daughter out of the monastery: Isidore advised her to say that she would
lead her home to her own house, to settle her in the world by some good
match. But as women cannot keep a secret, much less forbear speaking what is
forbidden them to say, she could not conceal that they had stifled in her
daughter the desire of a single life, but that she could make it revive again,
by putting her into another monastery. Hereupon from word to word the Abbess
and she began to enter into contestation, and at last Priscilla revealed all
the mystery of Salve, and cast it in the teeth of the Abbes, adding thereunto
sharp and stinging words, where with my pen will not black this paper. There
is now all the cabal discovered, and poor Marcionille in the greatest
confusion that can be imagined, seeing her self as it were the butte or mark
of the contradiction both of her mothers and the Abbesses tongues; this glowing
iron of choler is beaten on her back, her grief may better be imagined than
described.

Salve being without, and hearing of this jangling, was in extreme agonies,
seeing his plot discovered, that he despaired of ever being able to upholdit:
he bethinks himself, that if the maid once get out of his sisters hands, he
shall no more approach her nor conquer her mind, much less get the good will
of her friends, who would look on him rather as a seducer than a lover, and
for his part he had nothing but his sword, and Priscilla nor Isidore are not
persons that will give the one her daughter, the other his pupil, to a younger
brother, whose part amounts unto nothing but hope, he finds means to speak
with his sister, and persuades her to retain Marcionille by fair means or by
force. The Abbess believed his counsel, and how loud soever Priscilla gaped,
yet she was feign for that time to go back without her daughter. Presently
she complained to the justice, and presents her petition, showing the violence
which is done her. The Abbess answers, That contrariwise she seeks but to
hinder violence, that the will of this gentlewoman be not forced, who has no
will to be a Nun, but only to please her mother, or for fear of being ill
used by her: That if she will be so, she is ready to receive her according to
the agreement made thereof; in brief, not to make here the draught of a
lawsuit, in lieu of tracing an history, this maid caunot be gotten out of this
convent but by the authority of justice, who gave order that she should be put
neither into the hands of her mother, nor into any other house, but sequestered
in the house of Isidore, who was both her kinsman, and subrogated guardian, to
the end that with all liberty and freedom she might there declare what manner
of life she would choose to lead. Being there bred with much tenderness and
suavity among the children of Isidore, there often resorted a young man, son of
a great friend of Isidore, who in regard of his father and his own proper
merit, was there very welcome: by I know not what encounter of humors, which
Philosophers call sympathy, there was wrought such a correspondence between
him and Marcionille, that in short time their love was grown to such a point,
as nothing could be added to its perfection, but only consummation of the
marriage.

As they went on simply in their proceedings, this affection was soon
perceived by Priscilla, who labored to divert Marcionille from it: but it had
taken such root in her mind, that all former thoughts of a Cloister were quite
banished from thence. Isidore advertised hereof, and glad to oblige his friend
by this match, persuades Priscilla that it is both against nature and reason,
thus to press some Children to cast themselves into monasteries, thereby to
enrich the rest, that she should do far better to hearken unto this marriage,
than violently to force the will of her daughter. This mother yielded
thereunto, and in few days, notwithstanding the violent passions, subtle
devises, and oppositions of Salve, Marcionille came into the possession of
Eugenian, in whose arms she now leads a happy and contented life. Her former
desires of being veiled, were rather weak motions, than absolute wills,
inclinations which the persuasions of others and the weakness of her age had
bred, rather than designs framed by a mature and settled judgment. Thus the
Abbess saw her self frustrated of a good bit, Salve of a better, the first
project of her mother wholly annihilated, which was to make this child a Nun;
the first counsel of Isidore was changed, and he who first gave it to veil
her, gave it likewise to marry her. Eugenian grew so pleasing to the eldest
brother of Marcionille, that he became better contented to have him for his
brother in law, than to enjoy the inheritance of his sister. The younger
brother seeing his sister out of the Cloister, would not himself enter
therein, neither would he take upon him the Order of Ma^ta; saying, My elder
brother has enough to himself withal, I need not strip my self to give him
my apparel. There was none but only he that had married the eldest sister, who
grieved and murmured a little at this: but he may learn henceforward, not to
depend upon another dish when he desires to dine; so here are many intentions
frustrated, there is none but Marcionille whose feet are now out of the snares
which were set for her.

THE HAPPY STAY.
The Third Relation.
BAsse or Low-Brittaine, is a corner of the earth which gets far into the
Ocean, and makes almost an Island, the Inhabitants whereof speak a particular
language, so strange or if I durst say it, so barbarous, that it is understood
but only by those, who are borne there, it having nothing common with that
which is spoken in France, the manners follow the language, and are there so
rude and savage, that if the low Britains travel not forth of their own
native soil, they resemble a people of another world, a Gentleman of that
Country named Rogat, whom Fortune had favored with a good estate, loath to
see his Son spend his youth in his own Chimney corner, sent him to be
polished at Paris the spring of all virtue, and Mother of all gentleness; for
this little world is not only the center of the State, where all the lives of
the whole circumference do meet, but moreover the language is there most
pure, the Court is there in its luster, and there are the Acadamies where young
Nobility is taught, and trained up in exercises befitting their state, and
quality, they are no whit behind these of Italy, if they surpass them not,
Maximian being sent thither, with a pretty wit and well shaped body, soon
stripped of his old skin, and put on a French aspect, with gesture so pleasing,
that one could never have imagined him to be borne under so harsh a climat as
that of low or Basse Armorica.

Whilst he grows complete in those exercises which fit and prepare young
Gentlemen to the trade of Mars, Venus who accords well with the God of war
would needs possess a part of his mind; but it was not that adulterous Venus
surprised by Vulcan and made a fable among the Gods, it was a Venus wholly
honest and chaste breathing naught but honor, and tending to noe other end but
Hymen; the eyes of Hermile were the lights which guided him safely into the
port out of that tempestuous sea of love wherein so many perish; his
consideration was no less stayed by her virtue, then his senses charmed by her
beauty, her birth and faculties were but mean, she was daughter to a Merchant
whose greatest riches was his honesty, nevertheless he contented himself in
his low estate without raising his ambition higher then his traffic, he
affected nothing so much as the fear of God and a good reputation in the
world, he taught nothing else unto his children, but to take heed of offending,
assuring them that they should never want so long as they were firm in this
Maxim; this verity, and this blessing of God upon the head of the Just, shall
appear in this following discourse: The beginning whereof is the love which
Maximian bears to Hermile; it is said that the differences of apparitions
between good Angels and bad, are known by this, that the good give a terror
in appeering and leave a comfort or consolation in the vanishing, the bad do
the contrary, and transforming themselves from darkness into light, have a
sweet arivall, but their end is bitter as wormwood; the good propose nothing
but what is virtuous, and tending to salvation, the bad do but invite to
unlawful passions which darw unto eternal ruin; there is the distinction
betwixt the Hiblean and the Heraclian honey, that the first is good and wholesome
being gathered upon Thyme a bitter herb, it is a little unpleasing in taste,
but good for the stomach, whereas the second being gathered upon the sweet but
venomous herb aconitum, has increase of sweetness which is mortal, for it
provokes swimmings in the head, and strange convulsions, and in fine death if
it be not speedily vomited up; even so it is with good and evil love, the
first free and plain, but the pure has I know not what in it rough and
simple, but it troubles not the soul nor overturnes not the Oeconomie of its
health, which consists in the right use of reason and of all its faculties,
whereas bad love is sugered full of quaint wantonesses, fair smooth speeches
sweet but dangerous mortal unto reputation, pernicious unto salvation, and
quite contrary to reason, which she puts out of order, to establish in its
place the tyranny of an unruly passion.

Now as it is the end which gives the beginning unto a thing, the means being
justified by the intention, I generally call that bad and unjust love, which
has not marriage for its end, and which by wanton wooings, letters, presents,
and other such arts, tends unto the entire ruin of honesty. I call that love
good which is lawful and honorable, and has the eyes of a Dove, yea of a
Dove washed in the milk of purity, whose teeth are of Ivory, the symbol of its
integrity, whose lips are bound with a red riband in sign of pudicity and
modesty of speech, whose cheeks are like the opening of a pomegranat, it
witness of modest shame, whose feet are seated upon bases of gold for a
foundation of cleanness; In brief, whose thoughts, words, countenance,
actions and intentions, are all pure, upright, and sincere, all clean and
honest. It there were ever any of this sort, we may be sure that the love of
Maximian to Hermile had all these qualities. At the beginning of their
frequentation the father of Hermile was troubled in mind, and Hermile her self
had a good share in that trouble, because that considering the extreme
disproportion which was between the qu^l^ty of the one and the other of the
parties, they could not imagine in what manner heaven could tie them together.
But nothing is impossible to him that has made heaven and earth, and has set
such a tie amongst the elements, whose qualities are not only different, but
contrary each to other, depending them on divine providence, who has wrought
greater miracles. After a thousand protestations of purity, of intention and
honest pretention. Hermile was permitted by her father to hearken unto
Maximian, and not to reject after a froward manner the vows of his love and
service. Under the aspect of this star of fatherly permission she imbarqued
herself in this affection with so much staydnesse, and discretion, that she
proved the Proverb a liar, which says that Wisdom and Love never go
together. The eyes of her mother were always spectators of her carriage,
although her ears could not always understand the words wherewith Maximian
entertained her: which although full of modesty, might have lost their point, if
they had had less liberty: in conclusion, their love went on so far, that
nothing wanted but marriage to put it in its apogeon: but forasmuch as the
public laws forbid children to contract it without the consent of their
parents, the consent of Rogat was absolutely necessary, that of Hermiles father
being sure enough. Maximian, in whom love and desire bred great unquietnes and
impatience, writ unto his father, that being engaged in an affection which he
could not cast off but with his life, he humbly entreated him to give thereto
his consent and blessing, whereby he might make him the happiest gentleman in
all Britain. Rogat, who went not so fast on in a matter which cannot be too
much thought upon, having inquired of the qualities and condition of the maid,
I mean of those which the world chiefly regards in marriages, to wit blood,
which is the riches of birth, and wealth, which is the blood of life, and
having learned how extreme the inequality was between his son and this
party, like a prudent man as he was, he would not wholly cut off his sons
hopes thereof, for fear of raising his spirits to drive him unto some great
extreamitie: but he imitated Physicians, who turn back a rheum which by
their remedies they cannot wholly dry up, he cunningly takes time to think
upon it, and in that time seems desirous to see his son, to confer with
him viva v^ce on this matter. Lovers easily believe what they desire; for what
do they not hope that love? This deceitful language seemed unto Maximian to
be a kind of consent, and he concludes with himself so dexterously to
husband the mind of Rogat, that he will work him to condescend unto his
desires. The father sends him word, that for his own part he is now in an age
which dispenses him from great voyages, but that Paris is not too far a
journey from Britain for a young Academicke. Love of the Country, desire to
see it, and paternall invitation, sets on the back of Maximian such wings as
are attributed to the god of Love: he promises an inviolable loyalty to
Hermile, in presence of her father and mother, and takes leave of her, but
only to go and take leave of Rogat, to be wholly hers. He depends thereon as
on a thing already done, yet reckoning without his host he may reckon twice.
Hermile accompanies his departure with sighs and tears, sweet and chaste
witnesses of her affection, exhorting him to constancy, and to take heed that
wind and absence bear not away his faith and promise. It (...) to tell you the
vows and protestations which this Britton made of an immutable stability; yet
so it is as effects have shown, that he spoke even from the bottom of his
heart, and that his speeches were oracles. Being then arived in Britain he
found not in the mind of his father that condescendence which he imagined:
Contrariwise he met with reproves which he expected not, and whereunto his
soul was not prepared; he resembled them in war, who thinking to retire among
those of their own party, see themselves engaged in the hands of their
adversaries; in vain did he allege the beauties and virtues of Hermile. Rogat
sees them not so far off, and besides he thought there were beauties and
virtues in Britain, as well as in France. Moreover, that which he desired in a
match were beauties of silver and virtues of gold, which Hermile wanted. Then
did Maximian judge that his mind would never yield, and that those gentle
letters which he had written were but only lures to call him back into his
country, from the object of his passion, and cause him by absence to forget
her, and indeed this was the intent of Rogat. Contrariwise Maximian renewes the
vows of loyalty in his soul, and also in writing: for not content to write
letters unto Hermile by every ordinary messenger, he over and above sent her a
promise or contract of marriage, thereby to tie himself unto her with such
bonds as he should not be able to break, without losing the quality of a man
of faith and of his word. The father keeps him at home, and labors by all
means to divert him from his love: but as the son cannot win the Father,
much less can the Father alter the will of the Son, the one remains
steadfast in the negative; the other destinated in the affirmative. Rogat
judges that he shall not be able to draw out this nail but with another, and
that the way to root this affection out of the heart of Maximian is to marry
him, matches are not wanting in his neighborhood; Daughters are plants which
grow but in too great a number, but although they have greater portions, yet
have they not in Maximians opinion such graces, neither in body nor soul as
Hermile, Hermile alone has first possessed his affections, and Hermile only and
lastly shall possess them even unto the grave: the wind puts out small fires,
but great ones augment thereby, absence and contradiction extinguish common
slight flames, but strong and excellent ones take vigor by time and opposition.
Maximian refused all the matches, which were offered him, being resolved never
to marry, or to have her whom he desired.

Some Physicians say, that there is a certain disease called Exotique,
otherwise Melancholy of love, which ought to be dealt withal after the manner
of the Hyppocondriacks by condescending in some sort unto the fantasies of
these craized brains, Rogat made use of this industry to heal the sick mind
of Maximian he found out a young man that could artificially counterfeit all
manner of hand writing, then caused he a report to be spread, that he was upon
marrying his son Maximian, that all was agreed upon, that the wedding day
approached, and made this report fly unto Hermile; and her Father by a suborned
passion, and such subtle means with so much likelihood, that it passed in
their credence for a truth; then wholly to accomplish this deceit he made the
fore said young man dexterously to counterfeit the hand of Maximian, and in his
name write letters to the Father and daughter, whereby he excused the breach of
his word, and promise upon the constraint used by his Father, who forced him to
a match against his will, and inclination; and after many protestations
complaints, and exclamations against this violence, witnessing much sorrow for
the breach of this band of love, so often knit by oaths: He leaves Hermile at
liberty to take her fortune, protesting that being he could not by any means
have her for his wife, he would eternally love her as his sister; these letters
fell so patly into the hands of Hermile and her Father, whose minds were
preocupated with the news of Maximians marriage, that they made no more doubt
of this change, which they attributed to the difficulties and oppositions, and
with all too inconstancy so natural in men. The Suitors which Hermile had
refused, for to keep her word with Maximian, hearing of this rupture renewed
their suits amongst the rest an ancient Captain, who had been caught by the
eyes with the face of Hermile, showed himself most earnest and above all made
her the most advantageous proffers, this wise maid who saw but through the eyes
of her Father let him choose for her, and guide the Articles of this Marriage
at his pleasure, being resolved to yoke her desires, and never to have any
particular inclination seeing she had lost the hope of possesing Maximian; in
few days all was agreed upon and concluded and ready to pass on a public
betrothing, when as Hermile received by the post of Britain a letter from
Maximian, the style whereof was so far wide from the precedent, that she
could not imagine how the self same caracter could be capable of so different
imaginations; true love never goes without suspicion no more then without
fear, the last letter wholly conformable to so many former, continues his
affection with a constancy which abhors nothing more then change, the date
is latter then of the other, therefore there must needs lie hereunder some
falsity and deceit, which time father of truth may draw forth of Democritus
well.

The betrothing is deferred until they hear again from Maximian but under
other pretenses, and how earnestly soever Captain Severin pressed the Master, he
was still put off with delays; both Father and Daughter writ at large to
Maximian, and dispatch away a man expressly, who lets him see his counterfeit
letter, he cries out on the falsity, and without any more words, reporting
that he intended to ride a hunting, steals from his Fathers house, and making
no other answer to his letters, takes post to Paris, where as soon as he
ariveth without any other counsel, but what he takes of his anger, he
challenges Severin, who meets him at the place appointed, Hermile having
notice thereof without any regard either to her sex or condition repaires
thither to part them, where a flash of her beauty so much honored by these two
great courages, hinders them from passing further on; so much they feared her
indignation more then death, whose affrightfull grimme face scared them not.

They return home, each of them leading her under an arm, you would have
taken her for a Venus taming Lions, and fastening them to the Chariot of her
triumph, being come to her Fathers house, there matters were scand, Rogats
shuffling laid open, and his deceit discovered, and declared, the Captain
acknowledges that without open injustice he cannot pretend any thing in Hermile
thus tied to Maximian, and Maximian to her by so many promises and vows; mean
while Rogat missing his Son, doubts not but that this Iron is fled to its
Loadstone, he would feign recall him, but he is not a bird of Lure; he leaves
him without means, but the young man places himself with the Governer of
Britain, a Prince who can be no other then a Caesar, since he is born of the
blood of Great Henry, this Prince entertaines him and allows him means, so is
he now at Court, and near the object that gives life to his affections, he
remained there some years, expecting either the death or consent of his
Father: Mean while age grew on Hermile, but her virtues which decayed not by
years, made her still more acceptable unto Maximian, at last Rogat fell sick,
and Maximian made have unto him to yield him the devoires of a Son.

The father feeling his end approach, conjured his son as much as he could,
to cast off this affection, and to take a match more fitting and advantageous.
But Maximian who made more account of his word than of all the wealth of the
world, would never renounce his love. Rogat in despite thereof made his will,
and instituted the younger son his heir, in case that Maximian should ever
happen to marry Hermile. Hereupon he dies, and Maximian as eldest takes
possession of the inheritance: the younger brother makes protestations
conformable to the will, which being examined by the judges was declared void
or nullified in that respect, as made in the hatred of a marriage, the soul
whereof was freedom, seeing that Rogat thereby would extend his paternall power
unto a time wherein he should no more be. Then Maximian being master both of
his means and person, went to the Court with a brave train, where at the age
of three and thirty years he married Hermile, who was two and twenty. All the
world extolled his constancy and loyalty, and he was held for a rare pattern
of love and faithfulness. To tell you with how many joys these crosses were
recompensed, and what felicities followed this long attendance, would require
the lifting up of Hymen's veil, which were not seemly: those unto whom these
thoughts are not forbidden, may stay thereon; whilst I shall observe that
Hermile has lost nothing by her staying, since that from a mean condition
she sees her self raised to the degree of a Lady, beloved and cherished by a
husband who adores her, and in a wealth far above her hopes: but in truth there
are not Maximians to be found by dozens, few young men keep their first flames
so constantly. Yet on the other side the conservation thereof may be
attributed to the honesty of Hermile, who like a Vestall could so carefully
keep the fire of true love by purity, that it is no wonder if the success
thereof has bin happy, Fortune being at last forced to fall down at the feet
of Virtue, whose partakers are ever crowned with honor and glory.

THE FOOLISH BOAST.
The fourth Relation.
OF all vanities, Boasting is the idlest, and discovers most the weakness of
mind and debility of brain; it is so ridiculous among judicious persons, that
as soon as a man brags, he is taken to be impertinent: but above all, when he
deckes himself with borrowedfeathers, and things which he has done, and in
fine, of all brags the foolishest is, that which sets upon the reputation of a
weak sex, who have no other weapon but tears to oppose the detraction of evil
tongues. I am sorry that Berard a Noble man of our Nation, has fallen into
this baseness of spirit (I had almost said unmanlinesse) which at last caused
the loss both of his reputation, and life together: he was naturally fair,
and so curious in husbanding by Art what beauty nature had given him, that he
equalled therein the care and curiosity of women, he consumed so much time in
the mornings in tr^cking and trimming his head, ordering his hair, setting his
ruff, and clothes, that ere he were quite polisht, the day was half past: I
hold it superfluous to say that this new Paris half man was given to court
women, since these abovesaid employments show plain enough; wooing belongs
unto Paris. It is thy right trade, said that ancient Poet, speaking of the
fair son of Priam, that unlucky and fatal torch or destruction of his
fathers City and Kingdom: our Berard had so great an inclination to this
passion, that he seemed to be a Marygold, whose sun was beauty; for
wheresoever he met with any ray thereof, he burned after such a manner, that
what Poets fabulously write of Clitie, was in him a true History: this so
general an inclination, made him unconstant, and in this case he could not
keep from change, one might as soon have fixed quicksilver, as stayed his vows
long upon one object; his heart was like a looking-glass, which presently
receives the image of what is represented before it, and as soon looses it.

The first that for a time stayed his pretensions, was Stratonice, a
Gentlewoman much esteemed for her beauty, in one of the principal Cities of
the ancient Kingdom of Arles, where all happened that I shall speak of in
this Relation, she was the common desire of many wooers, but because her means
was not correspondent unto her beauty and comely grace which amounted unto a
high point, some could have wished her for a Mistress, who would have shunned
her for a wi^e, for few will buy a frail pleasure with a long and troublesome
necessity: Berard raising his head as far above his rivals, as does the Moon
in her plenitude above the smallest stars, which the obscurity of night
causes to glimmer in the sky, was likewise looked on with a more particular
attention* the care which Stratonice had to conquer him, as well to establish
her fortunes by marrying him, as for any inclination she had to his person, put
so much vanity into the head of our spruce younker, as he imagined that not
only Stratonice, but all other Maids looked on him with an eye of desire: after
he had prattled away some time with Stratonice, and taken pleasure in
scattering and dispersing of his competitors, although in all the time of his
access unto her, she never permitted him but only common and well-beseeming
favors, which honesty forbids not: this vain man raising his head into the
sky, imagined greater ones should be permitted him, he called rigor and
disdain what the holy law of Chastity did forbid him to sue for, which law this
wise Gentlewoman alleged and used, as a buckler against his pursuits: upon
these contestations, he takes snuff, and as his wild affection held but on a
small thread, he broke it off easily, and growing cold, left wooing there; yet
thus far is there nothing much blameable: for people should know before they
love, and therefore are honest conversations permitted, but to break with
violence, or rather to tear and rent what moderation counsels to unsow, is
a thing which cannot be excused without approving of injustice; this man not
content to rep^y with contempt the courteous entertainment which he had
received of this honest Gentlewoman, betakes himself to scoffing and
detraction, knowing that the honor of a Maid is tender as a flower, as soon
withered as touched, it resembles a looking-glass which dimmes even with ones
breath: the detractors tongue is a sharp two-edged sword, the venom of the
Aspe is under his lips, and the world has this evil quality to take the
grossest detractions for undoubted truths, and true praises are taken for
flatteries.

Our unconstant man glorying in the evil which he had not done, boasted of
certain private favors which the wisdom of Stratonice, never had so much as
a thought to permit him, and although the wisest persons made but a
mocking-stocke of his vanity, yet the weakest spirits remain doubtful of the
honesty of the Gentlewoman: O fair flowers of reputation are you thus exposed
unto the hurtful hail of evil tongues? although that this for a while
dispersed those that had an inclination of love to Stratonice; yet time father
of truth, consumed those mists, and brought back unto light the face of her
innocence, and she was served as aforetime, for as tempests purify the sea,
so did these storms justify her reputation. Berard whose natural inclination
was to love, sailed not long ere he found a new rock, whereon he made shipwreck
of his liberty: it was at the feet of Ginnesinde that he yielded himself, and
although his fickle and detracting humor made women doubtful of him, yet his
quality and means bore such a luster, that they hid these defects unto those,
who hoped to make a fortune by him, and besides it was thought that he might be
cured of these imperfections, and that if he could once be fastened with the
indissoluble bond of marriage, he would be constrained by the law of Hymen, to
be constant, and likewise to be m^re reserved in speeches, for fear least
others might speak ill of his wife, as he has spoken ill of others: and
indeed it must be granted that Hymen is a sovereign remedy to stay a fickle
man, and to stop his mouth, it is time for him then to be wise or never: on
this persuasion, and by the like permission of Parents, Gunnesinde no less
virtuous then fair, received the proffers of his service, and gained such
great advantages on his spirit, that it seemed this chain could never be
undone, but who can hold the wind in his hand, or stay a mind wherein
lightness is not so much accident as substance? Gunnesinde had neither more
merit, nor more charms than Stratonice, and therefore no wonder if she had
less power to retain this man under her laws; pride like unto smoke is
always mounting, the more this man sees himself made of, the better opinion
he takes of himself, and this presumption leading him forth of the bounds of
duty, bore him unto such insolences, as a well-bred Maid could not suffer
without anger and indignation; presently he enters into a chafe, and as the
prick of bloodletting cures the heat of a Fever, so the heat of this man's
love was alayed by the sting of despite; and whereas contrariety sharpeneth
the desire in others, this man's was extinct by opposition; proud imperious
spirit, who would have all stoop to him, and under the name of servant, would
take the authority, not only of a husband, but of a Master and a tyrant.
Gunnesinde whose noble blood was accompanied with a great spirit, seeing her
self affected among diverse other by one Servulle a young Gentleman, whose
humors pleased her well, and who honored her with submissions, approaching
even unto idolatry, could not suffer the haughty humor of Berard who would
reign alone and absolutely, as if he should give a law unto her from whom he
ought to receive it, often did he complain unto her of the jealousy which
Servulles presence bred in his head, and would have her not only to shun
him, but to drive him from her, by a kind of affront, whereunto Gunnesinde
would never condescend, unwilling so unworthily to reward the manifold
respects, and honorable services which she received of this young man. Berard
unable to bear this jealousy, and seeking but only some fair pretext to
pass from the love of Gunnesinde, unto that of Macrine, whom he had already
chosen for the object of his humor, made use of this occasion to break the
bands, and forsake Gunnesinde; from a tongue like to his, accustomed to
sharpness and gaul, nothing could be expected but scoffs or murmurings,
true it is, they were but as arrows shot against a rock, for Gunnesinde by a
severe manner of proceeding, had established such a foundation unto her
reputation, that all Berards brags were as so many spittings vomited up against
heaven, which to his shame, fell back upon his own face, notwithstanding
Servulle, who had a far more sensible feeling of these words darted against
her who^ so fervently he loved, then she her self had retorted back in so
many places such biting replies unto Berard, that had he had but as much care
of his credit, as of his hair he* would have sought to redress it with an
iron.

Servulle seeing he had to do with a man who either understood him not, or
seemed not to understand him, was on the point many times to give him the lie
to his teeth, or to challenge him, but he was kept back by Gunnesinde, who
strictly forbad him, wisely knowing that calumnies despised, vanish away,
whereas vexing at them, seems to acknowledge them* now is our Berard in the
third quarter of the wayne of his liberty, which if he easily lose, he gets
again with as much facility, Macrine grown wise at the others cost, often
twits him with his former fickleness, thereby to keep him from stumbling at
the same stone, and the more she wills him to return back to his former suits,
the stronger he fastens his affection on her. This Maid was under the power of
a brother, who watched her like a Dragon, and would willingly have seen her
settled on Berard, because in effect the match was very advantageous, but to
have her exposed to the tatling of tongues, was a thing he feared like death:
this brothers name was Accurse, a man very valiant of his hands, but hot
brained, he had had many quarrels, and had issued out of them advantagiously;
his sword was to be feared; Berard before this had been a Paris before
Achilles, it may be heaven reserved him to prevent the brags and detractions of
Berard, who at first stood in more awe of the sisters eye, then of the brothers
hands, but in the end the chance will turn, and the sword of Accurse shall be
more hurtful to him, then the looks of Macryne. To take away the blackness of
a Moore, and the spots of a Leopards skin, are two things noted for impossible,
to take from an evil tongue and unconstant man his evil custom, is in my
opinion the like: it seemed unto Berard, that having to deal with a Maid who
was not under the subjection of a father nor mother, he should have more
freedom and power: but he found his insolency abated as well by the honesty of
Macrine, who was not of an humor fit to endure fooleries, as by the severity
of Accurse, who loved honor more than life: to speak of marriage to an
unconstant man, is as much as to threaten a vagabond with imprisonment: Accurse
one day said roundly and dryly to Berard, that if he intended to marry his
sister, he should make haste and end it, if not, he might go elsewhere to
divert his fantasy. These raw words were of a hard digestion to so weak a
mind as Berards, that made him presently change countenance, for there is
nothing so stings a proud heart, as a repulse; the roughness of the brother,
made the conversation of the sister less sweet unto him.

Macrine, who made the will of her brother to be a law unto her self, being
commanded by Accurse to let this man know that she would not be made the fable
of the world, nor become the subject of detraction, she prayed him if he loved
her, it might be with the honor and respect due unto one of her birth,
otherwise that he should seek elsewhere subjects whereon to exercise his
vanities and tyrannies. Here is now our beauteous Medor stung to the quick,
and begins to whet his tongue like a Serpent, to transpierce therewith the
reputation of this honest Gentlewoman, but he shall fall into the pit that he
is going to dig, and shall be caught in the snare which he sets: all that he
had formerly said of Stratonice and Gunnesinde, were but flowers in comparison
of the thorns wherewith he means to prick and tear the reputation of
Macrine, he boasts of things that never were, and which ruin entirely the
honor of this Maid: a poor and foolish revenge for a man, yet what else can
be expected from an effeminate man. Accurse lets not these discourses fall to
the ground, but resolves to punish him memorably for them, and to strike diverse
strokes with one stone; he talks with the suitors of Stratonice and Gunnesinde,
Servulle and Eufrace, and having disposed them to revenge with him the outrages
they had received by the detraction of Berard toward the persons of their
Mistresses, they plot together to send him a challenge, and to invite him to
take two seconds, that all those three might be seen at one and the self same
time with their swords in hand, for one and the self same quarrel: Accurse
made the challenge, whereunto Berard would feign have answered otherwise then
with the sword (for commonly those dogs that bark most, bite not best) but
seeing himself defamed if he accepted not this proffer, he resolves thereunto,
and drawing strength from his weakness, showed more courage at his end then
was expected from him: he chose for seconds two stout fellows, or at least
such as were reported so to be, but it fares with Lovers as with Gamesters,
whom chance (some time) more then play, makes to win. Being all six met,
Servulle in three bouts laid his man on the ground, then came to help Eufrace
to disa^me his, there remained none but Berard, who was very ill led by
Accurse, and seeing three men upon his hands, what could he do being so ill
handled by one alone? for he had already received two or three hurts, and bid
him yield up his weapons, and retract his slanders of the three honest
Gentlewomen; this he might have done without prejudice to his honor, since he
had done all that a man can do for his defense, but whether he held himself
for dead by the wounds which he had already received, he would never yield up
his sword, much less retract his words, but falling desperately on Accurse, he
gave him a great thrust in the arm, and was ready to have stabbed him, when as
the other two struck him in diverse places, and made him let go his hold, they
forced his weapon out of his hands, and might have killed him if they would,
yet they had rather have him retract, then end, but his obstinacy was such,
that he would never ask of them his life, nor revoke any of his words; they
thus left him in that place, spewing out his soul with his blood. In this
story you may behold the just punishment of detraction.

THE TREACHEROVS BROTHER IN LAW.
The fifth Relation.
WHereunto do thou not bear the heart of men, thou accursed thirst of gold,
cries out one of the Ancients? O metal, worse then iron, thou breedest war
in all places, by reason of thee there is no safety in the world; the son in
law undertakes against the father in law, and the brothers are at division. I
will show you in this relation of the treacherous brother in law, that there
are men whose alliance or friendship is like unto that of the Ivy, which
fastens upon a wall, but to eat and ruin it. A Gentleman of Aquitai^e, whom
for his cruelty we call Tygris, having a company of men in one of the old
Regiments which France always maintains, be it peaceor wa^re, and being in
garrison in one of the Cities of the Lyonnise Gaul, betook himself unto the
employment of idle persons, which is wooing. This younger brother a child of
fortune, had no other revenue but his place whereunto he had attained as well
by the favor of his friends, as by his valor: this was a hazardous estate,
and weakly established, for besides the hazard of arms which makes those that
follow the trade thereof to be reckoned among accidental things. He had no
certain place of abiding, living after the manner of the old Nomades,
sometimes here, sometimes there, and to be every where, was no where; he cast
his eye on a Gentlewoman, who with one only brother lived yet under the
government of her mother, a very virtuous Lady, who lived in a Country house
she had near neighboring unto the town where this Captain lay in a
Garrison, he used such means that he introduced himself into this Castle, and
by means of hunting, wherein he was exceeding perfect, grew to such inward
familiarity with Nilamon, brother unto fair Crispine, that this young
Gentleman could not be without him: they daily made new matches, wherein Tigris
was still so fortunate, and taught so many secrets of this fervent exercise
unto Nilamon, that he made he made him one of the expertest Huntsmen of all the
Country. Crispine also by little and little, grows to affect the sport both of
Hawks and Hounds, and learnes so well to shoot with a Piece, that those who
beheld her, admired to see so much dexterity in her sex: these beginnings were
happy unto the designs of Tigris, who by this bait perfectly gained these two
hearts, but it is nothing if he conquer not the mind of old Eutrope their
mother, unto whom these two children are dearer than her eyes. Nilamon, who on
the one side desired nothing more than to see his sister well married, and on
the other side is so taken with the conversation of Tygris, that he desired
nothing more than to have him for his brother in law, he is a comely proper
gentleman, can use his sword well, has a good charge, is well known in Court,
and well willed by great Ones, a man of courage and fortune, though as a
younger brother he have no land, yet it may be that marriage bringing him to
good husbandry, he may gather wherwithall to purchase in the province where he
shall take a wife.

These are the reasons which invite Nilamon to this match for Crispine, whose
will is none other but the will of her friends, yet if her inclinations were
weighed they would go down on Tygris side, because he was a master in the
wood, Diana's exercises, whereunto she is affected: the mother only dislikes
this match, or it may be seems to withstand it, to have occasion thereby to be
entreated, holding therein the nature of women, who will have their authority
and power to be courted, when their beauty and age puts their persons out of
season to be wooed. But Tygris over and above his ordinary submissions, set so
strong an engine on work that in the end he got the place which he had so
long besieged; it was by the mediation of his master De Camp, a Nobleman of
note, and the Kings Lieutenant in a neighboring province. Under this great
man's word the Net was cast, the Fish taken, and Crispine came into the
possession of Tygris by the gate of marriage, in lieu of portion money he took
a piece of Nilamons inheritance, so that he is now become both his neighbor
and brother in law, but even as the sick of the dropsy augment their thirst
in drinking, he not content with his part, cast his eye, but an eye of conquest
and rapine on the rest of the estate of Nilamon, who had brave land, and very
lordly; and because he could not get them by any lawful means, began to
think on unlawful ones: the children which made him a father, and which
Crispine brought him almost every year, put into his head the evil design
which he conceives in pain, nourishes in deceit, and brings forth in
iniquity. Unhappy man, who knows not that bloody and deceitful men are
threatened with short life and eternal ruin, and that their seed shall perish.?

He is in E^tropes castle as in his own house, his children are there brought
up, his wife there kept, he there as a son in law, or second son, in fine,
he is what he will, and yet not at ease, if he be not all and have all: but
those that think iniquity shall be confounded, he knows, that seeking to make
away Nilamon by poison, or by sword openly, were the way to lose himself, and
to trouble his own feast. As the just man walks by straight ways, the unjust
walks by those that are crooked: So is the Son unto that subtle Serpent who
was a cruel murderer from the beginning of the world; and every one sees how
that Animal still goes byasing, and advances forward but by cranklings and
windings in and out. Tygris treads these paths, seeking means indirectly to
make away Nilamon, he knows that a neighbor thereby, a gentleman of no less
quality than his brother in law, goes a wooing, and he counsels Nilamon to
incroach upon his bargain, that is, to be a suitor to the same party, a thing
that cannot be suffered by a lover, or a man that has never so little courage.
It was but only to expose his brother in law to the hazard of a duel, to gain
his inheritance if he were sl^ine, or the confiscation, if by killing he were
constrained to fly. It happened as he had projected, Maxim challenges Nilamon,
taking it ill that he should come to interrupt him in his suit. But the
fortune of arms was favorable to Nilamon, and Maxim was slain in the field.
Nilamon is forced to fly to Italy, into a voluntary exile: for to avoid the
rigor of Edicts lately renewed against Duels.

The friends of dead Maxim^ prosecuted the matter so hard, that they obtain a
decree of death against Nilamon, and cause him to be executed in effigy, [that
is, if an offender whose fault deserves hanging escape, yet is he by the
custom of France adjudged to the gallows, and his picture hanged thereon, a
sign that whenever he is taken, he shall be trussed up in person] Tygris
according to his desire obtaines the confiscation of his brother in laws
estate: but in fine time having mollified minds, and slackned much of the
rigor of the edict, Nilamon makes such means that he obtaines his pardon: but
to re-enter into his estate, he was feign to let go another good piece thereof
to Tygris: who seeing that this artificial plot succeeded some what to his
mind, meditates on another, and how to set a snare for Nilamon, who thinking by
a good match to repair the breach those broyls had made in his affairs, intends
to be a suitor, where Tygris seeming to assist him uses means that he hinders
the concluding thereof. He represents the affairs of Nilamon to be in far
worse case than they are; To be brief, he uses the matter so, that all
Nilamons endeavors to marry, are as so many mines without effect, for Tygris
feared no stroke so much as this, knowing full well that all the children which
Nilamon should have by a lawful marriage, would be so many heirs to frustrate
his pretentions.

During this troublesome business of Maxims death and Nilamons long absence,
he had made some debts* and amongst his most pressing and importunate
Creditors, he that tormented him most was one Appolinaire a gentleman of that
province, whose purse by report was better than his sword, and could use
counters better than weapons. This man sets a seizure on Nilamons lands, to be
paid often what was due unto him. This put Nilamon into an extreme passion of
anger; the Nobility and Gentry of the country are so accustomed to right
themselves by the sword, that they cannot suffer the formalities of the pen.
Nilamon presently challenges Appolinaire, Tygris blows to kindle this fire,
it is all he seeks, to see his brother in law at hazard to lose his life.
Appollinaire being challenged, answers that he will be paid before he fight,
and that it is the part of a Ninney to hazard the loss of his life and money
both at one time, and that he will not convert a suit or cause civil into a
criminal, nor repair with his blood the pleasure he has done to Nilamon in
lending him money in his necessity, that is an ungrateful acknowledgement of a
courtesy, to send a challenge in lieu of a payment. Nilamon in a greater fume
than he was before, vows to kill him wheresoever he finds him. Tygris by his
persuasions increases this will in him, and promises faithfully to guard and
assist him in this enterprise. Mean time he underhand advertises Appollinaire
to go always well accompanied, and in fine desiring but the death of his
brother in law, he plots with Appollinaire as it is thought to lead him to the
slaughter. They go a hunting, and as Nilamon and Tygris were together, they
were told, that Appolinaire was passing a pretty way off them thence: he had
eight or ten horsemen with him. Nilamon, in whom anger boiled, goes like a mad
man to set upon him, having none with him but Tygris and one servant who
accompanied him on hunting. Tygris swears and assures that they three are able
to hacke these rascals in pieces. Nilamon falls on, thinking to be seconded,
but Tygris playing at false company saved the mold of his doublet, and left his
brother engaged in a fray, which being rashly entered, he was in a moment so
pierced through with bullets and swords, that he died presently. Now is Tygris
at the end of his pretensions, who by the right of his wife enters into the
full possession of Nilamons inheritance, the good woman Eutrope being dead
before this accident happened. But God* who never leaves a wickedness
unpunished, and who rewards in their season the secret of hearts and things
hidden in dark esse brought to light, and to the confusion of Tygris all that
he had plotted against Nilamon: for this man being now grown insolent by
reason the sails of his desires were swelled with the wind of good fortune,
began to use his wife ill, not considering that all the wealth wherein he
gloried proceeded from her, and that although he were now a Lord, but for her
he should be but a simple Captain. And as arrogance is never without impudence,
he had been so unwise as to declare unto his wife the stratagems whereof he
had made use to cause Nilamon to perish in the snares he had set for him. This
woman provoked by the il usage of her husband, could not hold her tongue, but
one day being overcome with grief, she upbraided him with all his treacheries,
laying them evidently open. And as a mischance never goes alone, it happened
that one of those who had assisted Appolinaire in the murder of Nilamon, being
taken for another crime, before his execution confessed likewise this, which
he did declare to have been done by a plot between Tygris and Appolinaire.
The words of Crispine and of this man joined to the conscience of Tygris, which
was to him as a thousand witnesses, cast such a terror into his soul, that
like another Caine he went his way wandering through the world, imagining that
the blood of his brother in law cried still to heaven for vengeance against
him. His place was given to another, and he thus voluntarily banishing himself
from the sweet air of France, and the conversation of his wife and children,
fled into Germany, where at wars he dyed, in an encounter, this was the
miserable success of his wretched designs; and how God would not permit him
to enjoy that wealth, which to purchase had made him violate the laws both
divine, and humane, and profane, the most Sacred bonds that are in nature; he
that by just labors, and lawful industries, gathers up any thing shall see
his goods prosper like a tree planted near the current of waters, which brings
forth fruit in its season, but it shall not be so with him, that wrongfully
heaps up riches; for he shall be set like dust in the face of the wind, and all
that he has gathered shall be scattered and consumed, this proverb proving
ever true, that ill gotten goods go away in the same manner.

THE FORTVNATE Misfortune.
The Sixth Relation.
MArcel, a gentleman of Touraine coming from Saumur was returning to his
house, not far distant from the River of Indre, it was in the long days of
Summer, when the greatest heates make the shades to be more affected, his man
who carried his male, and his two footmen being more thirsty then their Master,
were stayed at a Tave^^e to drink, and refresh themselves, mean while Marcel
went on dreaming, and arived alone at the River side, and as he staid there for
his men to pass over with him, there came a young man reasonable well clothed,
with a comely face, who proffers to take the bridle off his horse; this fair
presence stroke into his eyes, and taking pity on his youths fortune who had
as good a countenane as ever he beheld, questioned with him what he was? the
young man with a voice able to inchaunt the Rocks; said, Sir I am an Orphant
having neither Father nor Mother, and of the Country of Boulonnis, forsaken by
all there, am going to Chasteleraud to find out an Uncle of mine, Brother to
my Mother, and see if he will take pity on me, or find me out some place,
where by serving I my get my living; youth said Marcel it is easy to be
seen, that you have not been brought up to serve, at least wise in painful
offices, it is true said he if it had pleased God to have spared me my Father,
who was an honest Merchant, I should not be reduced to this misery, but
Merchants are not known till they die, his shop was fair and his credit
great, but as soon as he died all failed, and his debts were found to be
far greater then all that he had, so that being destitute of any means, I
must make a virtue of necessity, and seek to eat my bread by the sweat of my
brow, Marcels heart was mollified at this youths disaster, and resolved to
retain him in his service, imagining that he had on his forehead a certain
ray of freeness and fidelity, weary with staying for his men, he goes into the
boat with this youth who named himself Geronce, he had a little Satchell on
his back, long Flaxen hair waving on his shoulders, a Suite reasonable good,
but a ravishing grace, he held the Horse raines after such a manner as it was
easy to be seen, his only courage upheld his weakness, Marcels Castle was
from thence some two little leagues, wherein Geronce found himself but a bad
footman, yet on the way he entertained his new Master with such good
discourses, that the time seemed not long.

Being arrived home, and saluting his wife, he said unto her, Madam, I bring
you a new guest, whose good countenance serves for letters of credence. I have
destinated him to wait on our son, (this was a child of some nine or ten
years of age) I believe he will keep him neat and clean, and if this little
boy take after him, he shall neither want comeliness nor good behavior: this
Lady looking on Geronce, found him to be perfectly acceptable, and praised her
husbands judgment for applying him so worthily as to wait on their son:
Sulpice (for that was the childs name) was in a short time so taken with the
conversation of Geronce, and Geronce be took himself with so much care and
diligence to tend and serve him, that father, Mother, and Son were equally
satisfied therewith: all the Bees run to the honeycomb; Geronce was one, and
both Master, Mistress, and Servants, strove who should love him most; there
was nothing so modest, so gentle, nor so beautiful as this young man's
qualities, which charm the savagest spirits.

But alas, beauty that acceptable gift of heaven, is a dangerous thing, this
pleasing illusion of the sense, this snare of the soul, this short tyranny
extends his power even over the heart of Fursee, for so will we call the wife
of Marcel. Good God, with what convulsions was it tormented, this poor thing
tossed between love and honor, at one and the self same time, the one of them
striking it with cold fear, and the other with burning desire: do you not
pity the violence of this fever? what endeavors did she not use for the
combat, the safety of this illusion? but they were vain, for she had rooted
this poison so deep into her heart, that she was forced to yield: how unequal
is the wra^^ling between reason and passion in a weak spirit, and what
steadfastness soever is imagined to be in the weaker sex, it is but of glass,
and breaks at the first stroke. I will not stand to describe by particulars
the confusions, the troubles, the shames, and the contradictions of this
troubled mind, nor to represent by what means she made Geronce know, that
which she had so often tried to stifle by silence; the brevity which I
prescribed to my self in these relations, permits me not to extend my self
unto these particularities, I will only say that which I cannot omit, without
blotting out the principal features of this picture; to wit, that having need
of a confident person to guide this business unto the end she desired, she
made choice of one of her maids named Leobard, and having with such
shamefacednesse as cannot well be represented, made known to her with what
disease she was infected, and how she was forced to seek remedy from the
Serpent that had bit her; she happened so unluckily, that even as the Bird who
makes the Lyme which fowlers use afterward to catch him withal: for this
Maid was struck with the same dart; then may you imagine, if to trust her
rival with her secret, were not in a manner as to thrust a knife into her own
bosom. Leobarde to weave her treason with more facility, promises all manner
of assistance unto Fursee, although her thought were quite contrary to what her
mouth uttered, and thinking to have found out a means so to oblige Geronce,
that he should no longer continue the disdain wherewith he had hitherto
repayed her love, she declared unto him the passion and affection of Fursee
toward him. Geronce who had diverse times shown unto Leobarde, that those
discourses were horrid unto him, rejected this also. Leobarde seeing then that
she could not obtain credence in his mind, counseled her Mistress to speak
her self if she would be understood, this froward youth having no ears for
her persuasions; what grief felt Fursee to see that she had in vain declared
her self unto this Maid, whose answer was a sad presage of the small hopes she
might have to bend Geronce to her desire; what new pains took she to pull this
thorn out of her soul; but at the first sight of this fair object, all these
endeavors vanish into smoke, and new fires took possession of her heart: It
is not without reason, that those who write of the cure of maladies of the
mind, say that not to avoid the occasions, is to be still in the disease; for
so he that is not in the City, is in the suburbs; and to present a person that
loves with the object that sets him on fire, is as to approach the fl^me unto a
smoking Torch; this youth was one of Fursees domesticals; alas, how could she
have healed up a wound that opened again, as often times as she opened her
eyes: there is nothing so much inflames the hurts of the body, as to apply
honey thereunto, nor those that any affectionate passion makes in the heart, as
honeyed words O you Lovers, fly both the sight and speech of your beloved, if
you will recover your former health! ah Fursees what do you, the ranckling of
your wounds will increase by the remedies which you apply: she talks to
Geronce, and with troubles and stuttering like unto those of a guilty person
before a Judge, she labors to make him susceptible of her torment. Leobard had
brought them together, and to give her Mistress scope, retired her self into
another chamber, which almost amazed fair Geronce, to see himself alone
without any witness, by a woman which uttered unto him such language as he
could not hear without extreme perplexity, the different changes of his
color sufficiently witnessed by his face, the alterations of his mind, his
eyes bending to the ground, his silence and his immovable countenance gave
unto Fursee an answer which was not favorable. Her presents were spread, her
promises large, her entreaties unseemely, her sighs vehement, her tears in
abundance, but these winds, and these waters, were as storms against a rock;
Geronce appeared insensible, like the statue Pigmalion fell in love withal;
the heat of love pierced by a bloody contempt, commonly turns into a furious
wrath. Fursee was upon the point of this change, when Geronce to conjure his
tempest, and cut out the root of this disease at its first breeding, resolves
to unmaske the counterfeit, and cause pity of himself, in her who craved it
of him. Madame, said he, unbuttoning his doublet, behold these Breasts, and
ask no answer, except you will see me dye at your feet with shame: men are not
better known by the Beard, then women by their Breasts: this sight left no
manner of doubt in the soul of Fursee, but that Geronce was a woman, and as it
is said that thunder falling upon a Serpent, in lieu of taking away life, does
but take away his venom, so this sudden clap rooting out of this woman's heart
all the poison of her bad desires, took not away her love to Geronce, but left
it there with pity, and this pity bred a desire to know the fortune of this
man Maid, that she might seek to yield her some assistance in her disaster,
and with this intent said; seeing heaven has made me fortunate by this
knowledge, and changed the rock whereon I would have made shipwreck into a
Haven of safety for mine honor, I do promise you for your freeness toward
me, to conceal your sex as long as you please; and if you desire any help,
you may as freely discover the cause of your being in this state, assuring you
that you shall find in me all the assistance which you can expect from a woman
desirous of the preservation both of your honor and your person.

Madame, replied Geronce, mischiefs are so contagious, that the very recital
of them does ever breed some alteration, even in the calmest spirits: Let me
therefore groan under the burden of my misfortunes, and suffer not your
felicity to be troubled by the hearing of them, rest contented to take pity on
a poor Maid, who puts her honor and her life into your protection: this
evasion did but whet in Fursee that curiosity so natural in women, and gave
her occasion to reply thus, as Physicians heal no diseases, but those they
know, so likewise cannot I assist you in your misfortunes, if you discover not
unto me the cause thereof, to the end that knowing who you are, and in what
manner you came to be in this disguise, I may behave my self toward you, as I
ought, and fince there is a remedy for all things but death, strive to
re-establish your self in the degree from whence it seems fortune has made
you fall, for you have a ray of Nobility on your brow sh^nes through the clouds
of your present condition, and makes it appear even to the weakest
understanding, that you have not been bred after a common manner: Madame
replied Geronce, my woes are past recovery, since they proceed from a death,
and therefore being my miseries ought to be put among incurable maladies, let
me entreat you to cast away that needless care which you take to cure me, and
let me pass away under your protection my small remainder of life, as well I
feel that sorrow and grie^e for my fault do undermine it by degrees, and will
not let me long survive him, without whom the fairest days are to me as
darkest, and like a lingering death, in saying this, Geronce let fall from his
eyes, tears resembling those drops of rain which the ardent heat of the Sun
does squeeze out in the fairest days of summer; but so far was Fursees
curious desire from being quenched, that this water resembled that which Smiths
put on their cinders, whereby the fire is increased, and not put out, therefore
extraordinarily pressing Geronce to disclose unto her his adventures, he was
constrained to content her, but not without extreme striving, and having dried
up his eyes, and obtained a truce from his sighs, began in this manner. I am of
Austrasi^, daughter to a Gentleman, one of those who are called of the ancient
knighthood, his name is Gaudence, he has diverse children, and I am the second
of his daughters, and the cause of this dishonor and trouble of his house;
Baptism named me Saturnine, which was the name of my mother, who died when I
was but six years of age: it must be granted that daughters lose all when
they lose their mothers; in such tender years they are ships without
North-starre, Rudder, or anc^or, and what diligence soever widowed fathers use
to find out good governants, they never find a^^ whose eyes be so vigilant
over their daughters as their mothers, and besides, their power is so weak that
the contempt of their commands is the gate of liberty, through which at last
maids go astray. My sisters and I shook off the yoke of ours, to follow the
desires of our own hearts, and walk after our own giddy humors: Love
assailed us and took us, yet there was none but I surprised, after the manner
that you shall understand.

My eldest sister loved a young gentleman whom she wedded not, but to obey the
will of our father she wedded an old gentleman whom she never affected: she
made me such strange complaints of being tied to a man whom she loved not, that
it seemed she endured the torment which that tyrant inflicted, who fastened dead
bodies to the living, till they died in this cruel languishing manner. I
mistake, for she described unto me her torment to be equal unto that which is
suffered in hell. And indeed such may one call a marriage wherein the parties
do neither agree in the wills of the heart, nor the delights of the body, this
misery which I considered in her, made me resolve to avoid the like, how dear
soever it cost me. But alas, to shun one gulf I cast my self into another,
and I may say, if my sisters marriage were a hell, the ^uries carried the
torches at mine, and conducted me to a dis^ster worse than hell.

Volusian a young Gentleman, but a younger brother of our neighborhood, had my
first, and shall have my last affection: we lived some years in so perfect a
correspondency, that if my father would have matched us together, the Elysian
fields could never have equalled our felicity. But that unlucky temporal
respect that cutthroat of so many pure affections, was the hangman unto ours.
For because this young man was not rich enough, my father would never yield his
consent unto our union: but I fearing a lot like unto my sisters, would needs
spin my destinies with my own hands, and so have I fashioned the cord which
has dragged me to the misfortune wherein I am. Volusian ever behaved himself
toward me with an incomparable modesty, so that it was not so much by his
solicitation, as by my own proper inclination, that we made reciprocal
promises of marriage, accompanied with so many solemn oaths, and such
horrible execrations against the party that should violate the same, that if I
had had but the least thought of breaking, I should not have believed heaven
sufficiently furnished with thunders to strike me according to desert. We must
confess that oaths, writings, promises, frequentation, liberty, and
facility, are strange baits to lead blinded youth to its ruin, to lay coals
to the fire with a will not to have them kindle, is to desire impossibility,
the body being but the accessarie of the heart, and in marriage the sensible
union being but a sollower of the will, you may im^gine if I easily yielded
unto the desires of him who possessed all mine, and if I could think my self to
be lost by casting my self into my beloveds arms. We then consummated our
Clandestine marriage, and resolved whenever I should find my self laden
with the fruits of Lucina, to take flight with my husband, rather than to
undergo the thunder of Gaudences anger. This happened not, but a more terrible
tempest overtooke us, which brought me to the wrack wherein you see me. Minard
a Gentleman of Austria, who had been in marriage but three years, and was not
above thirty five years of age, found I know not what in my face that liked
him. He was a match so advantageous, that to see me, to desire me, to ask me of
Gaudence, and obtain me, were all such sudden blows, that I had neither time
to foresee them, nor to shield my self from them. My father without consulting
my will, told me he had given me to Minard, and that I must dispose my self to
receive him for my husband within few days. If a thunderbolt had fallen at my
heels I should not have been more astonished: I made no answer to my father,
for what could I have said that would have pleased him, and oppose cold excuses
to his resolutions, had been as to make bullets of snow against the Sun
beams, I resolved suddenly to make effects speak, and that was all that I
could in so pressing a necessity. Gaudence took my silence for a consent.

Next day my amorous Widower came to see me, and after the complements of a
first interview, he would have offered me his service, under the allowance
(said he) of my father. My father (said I) has not willed me to receive your
service, but your commands obliging me to behold you as a Master, this
proceeding is to be admired, thus to give away free persons without their own
consent. I am borne his daughter, and not his slave: howsoever, I declare unto
you that I belong to a greater master, having made a vow to him that has made
heaven and earth, never to be any bodies but his. If it had pleased you to have
seen me before you had spoken to my father, I had saved you the labor of
asking a thing which you cannot lawfully get, nor possess without sacrilege.
Never was any man more amazed than Minard, when by this free declaration he
saw his hopes undermined to the very foundation. He feared God, and therefore I
could not oppose any thing of more force to stay his desires. For answer I had
none other, but that he was sorry to have been troublesome to my designs, yet
he believed a dispensation might remedy all this, if I would give ear
thereunto. I told him that a dispensation presupposed some reasonable cause,
and that I saw no necessity to revoke a vow which I had made without necessity.
He sees my father and communicates my answer unto him: who instantly falls into
anger, and from thence into injurious words and threats. He had once gotten
knowledge of my affection to Volusian, and had interdicted me the commerce
thereof, and now presently believes that in despite of that I had made this
vow, and (such is the tyranny of paternall authority) he imagined that I
could not vow without his consent: he falls to consultation with a Civilian,
who gave him to understand, that nothing was more easy then to get a
dispensation of his vow, he who was no les desirous to have Minard for his
son in law, then Minard to have me for his wife, takes this counsel and
dispatches presently to Rome, for this dispensasion which being come, and all
the preparations made for our public betroathing, and the articles signed
between Minard and my Father, what should I have done? declare my Clandestine
marriage consume^ed with Volusian, no, I had not brass enough in my face to
undergo so much shame, beside I should have exposed my husbands life to
manifest danger; the counsel which we took was to retire disguised from
Austria into some part of France, he had formerly borne Arms under a Prince
of the house of Austria, who was Governor of Bittaine and dyed in Huugaria,
drowned with many victories, gotten on the Turk, he had made some
acquaintance in that Province and though we might live there at shelter, and in
case of pursuit that from thence we might sail into Ireland or Scotland, and
hide our selves from the fury of Gaudence in those extreamities of Europe, he
clothed me in man's apparel as you see, and in this manner we leave Austria,
and p^ssing through Champagne and Burgundy. Enter in Burbonnois to get unto the
River of Loire there to imbarke our selves for to land in Britain.

But Fortune my capital enemy to end on me the last stroke of his vengeance,
permitted that as we crossed a Forest we were set upon by four Thieves, who
had given Volusian two wounds before he could set himself in defense, as soon
as he had drawn his sword he ran him through, who had first stroke him, the
others to revenge the death of their fellow made an end of him presently,
affrighted as I was and dazzled with the glittering of so many swords, I fled
into the thick of the wood, where I remained till midnight with dolours of
fears, which cannot be expressed at last under the Moons pale light I began
to seek what I feared to meet with; alas, I found Volusian naked (for these
thieves had taken away his very Shirt, and pierced through in so many places,
that it is to be thought their rage had extended to give him many thrusts after
his death) at his feet lay also their fellow stretched along naked, whose face
they had mangled that he might not be known; I was so overcome with sorrow
that had it not been for a secret fear of eternal damnation which seized my
soul, I had a thousand times stroke a knife into my heart, I past the rest of
the night in griefs, which cannot be imagined, and in troubles unconceiveable;
for me to return to my friends after so gross a fault, was a thing whereunto I
could not resolve nor on which side to turn, in an unknown Country I knew
not; at last I resolved to give my self over unto divine providence, and to
te^d toward those in Britany whereof my husband had so much told me; and after
I had wet him with tears I fled from this in famous wood for fear of being
apprehended as guilty and so to be discovered; having passed the River of
Loire, I happened I know not how to be at the river of ^udre, when my Master
arrived there to pass, I helped him down from his horse, and afterward to get
up again when we were on the other side he asked me when? I was I made him
believe what I would to cover my true disgrace, under a feigned history, he had
taken me to serve your son, a place proportinable to my strength, and wherein
I intended to expect with patience how God would dispose of me, but you would
needs through pity take some part in my pain; I Madam all the pity I
humbly entreat you to take thereof, is to keep close that secret which you
have commanded me to discover unto you, and to have care of preserving that
small remainder of honor in this miserable creature whom excessive, but
lawful love of a husband has borne into the extreamities, whereunto you see
her reduced; Geronce ended in this manner, the recital of her Fortune falling
down on her knees before Fursee, who in compassion mingled her tears with the
tears of this disconsolate woman, and kissing and embracing her, promised
never to forsake her, and to have the same care of her, as if she were her own
daughter after that time: Reason took place in the affection of Fursee; from
whence it had bin drawn by passion, her actions were better ordered, her flame
sweeter, and more moderate, it was not so with Leobardes which augmented daily
by the shunings, refusals, and contempts of Geronce, which this foolish Wench
attributed unto the pride which she thought he took in the enjoying of his
Mistress, and although that Fursee without discovering the secret of Geronce
assured her that her love was converted into friendship, and Geronce was the
most chaste and most virtuous youth in the world, this Maid heated by another
fire, imagined that Fursee held this discourse, but to cover her game whilst
she possessed her Adonis, and to say true Leobardes suspicions were not without
some show or likelihood of ground; for Fursee now beholding Geronce but as a
woman used so much freedom with him, made him come into her chamber, at such
suspicious hours that the least credulous, would have been tempted to take it
ill; and this was that put Leobard into a desperate jealousy, which peevish
humor, made her do a base and treacherous act that caused a tragical event,
and a misfortune which gave birth unto a prosperity; and thus it was: After she
saw that all her sollicitings of fair Geronce were lost labors, imagining
that the refusals were disdaines, and stung with anger at these imaginary
contempts, she resolved being she could not content her love, to satisfy her
revenge, and undo her rival Mistress together with him that would not
corespond unto her affections; it was by a morrall advertisment given unto her
Master, of the bad dealings of Fursee and Geronce, whereof she showed such
apparent colors that Marcel nothing doubted, but that he was dishonored by
his wife.

Immediately then how to reveng it at full he makes show of lying forth and by
the help of Leobarde hides himself in a closet near the chamber of ^ursee,
this woman who took great delight in conversing with Geronce, and in making
him him relate perticularities of his house and Country, of his love, and
fortune, failed not to make him come at night for to put him into his discourse
and to fall a sleep thereon, but whilst she is in bed and Geronce sitting at
her beds head talking to her, Marcel is preparing fire and sword to reveng the
injury, which he belieues to be but too apparent, he starts forth of his
ambuscado and comes with his pistol in hand crying with full mouth, ha
accurfed woman now is the time that thou shall wash my spoted honor in thy
blood, and that thou and thy adulterer shall both of you pay interest for the
wrongs you have done me, and without hearing any answer, shoots off his
Pistol thinking to pash out Fursees brains, but she turning her head a
little, the shot went into the feathers without any other effect, but only
that it burned the cheek of this poor Lady, who in this trouble, misdoubted
the cause of her husbands wrath, had no more leisure but to cry out, O Sir
Geronce is a woman whereat Marcel whose sword was already drawn to end
therewith what the fire had spared, as if a flash of lightning had dasled his
eyes stood in suspense at these words when Geronce more dead then alive cast
her self at his feet, and with the discovering of her breasts assured him that
Fursees words were but too true; and presently to clear his understanding, of
so many confusions wherewith his soul was troubled, Geronce though trembling
related unto him the whole history, as you have heard of her miffortune, and
pitiful adventure which drew tears from the eyes of Marcel, and made him
infinitely repent what he had done; mean time remedies were applied to the
burn on Fursees face, which besides the pain threatened her with a great
deformity, but whether it were the inflammation that redoubled, or through the
extreme terror which she had felt in hearing a Pistol thunder in her ear,
and see her self nere loosing her life, she fell into a strong fever, which in
three days laid her in the grave, Marcel lamented much for her, both because
he truly loved her, and for that he saw himself to be the cause of her death,
he had almost discharged the burden of his wrath on Leobarde and sacrificed
her, to the Manes of her Mistress, but when he knew that she her self had
been first deceived and that the conjectures of the evil had been so strong,
he was contented only to drive her away from his house.

Mean time Geronce having changed her habit and being become Saturnine,
appeared so fair in the eyes of Marcel, that love being entered into his soul
by the two gates of beauty and pity, he resolved to marry her as being a
Gentlewoman of a good descent, and the widow of a Gentleman. Saturnine seeing
her fortune to be desperate, if she with open arms received not this
occasion laid hold on her foretop, and consented to Marcels will by a solemn
marriage, and since Gaudence Father to Saturnine being dead: Marcel had that
part of the inheritance that fell to her thereby, which amounted to as good a
portion as he could have had with a wife, chosen out of his own Country;
thus in the secular or civil life, the harm of the one is the profit of the
other, as in the natural the corruption of one body is the ingendering of
another; so the misfortune of inconsiderate Saturnine was by divine providence
changed into a good fortune, and that moment of time intended for her death,
was to her a beginning of a happier life; it may be that the patience which she
showed in that extreme adversity of the loss of Volusian, and her wise
carriage and behavior in the government of Marcels son, brought her to this
felicity, not without great wonder to little Sulpice, who saw his tutor in a
short time changed his mother in law.

THE IMPVDENT ATTEMPT.
The seventh Relation.
NOt pride only, but also temerity ever mounts, there be men who cannot play
foolish prancks, but they must extend them to the uttermost point of
impertinency, impudence elevating them so much the higher, by how much the
lower she means to cast them down; doing by them as the Eagle by the
Tortoise, which she carries up into the air, but only to let her fall on the
point of some rock to break her in pieces, and then devour her: Speusippe a
Gentleman of the Province of Aquitaine, will show us here the image of an
impudent traitor, whose attempt unworthy of a man of honor, was punished by
heavens permission, when he had thought to take his prey in his hand, and to
triumph insolently in the honor of another. This man in the wars had entered
in friendship with another Gentleman of the same Province, named Liberat; and
this friendship was grown so great, that they called brothers, and the one had
nothing but what was the others. Peace being returned to France by the
victorious hand of great Henry, sent every man back under his own fig tree,
and under his own Vine, and changed swords into Sythes, and head-pieces into
hives: these two friends with drew themselves to their houses, which were not
so far asunder, but that they saw each other often enough, living with a
freedom and familiarity wholly fraternall; Liberat took a desire to marry, and
wedded a fair and virtuous Gentlewoman, whom we will call by the name of Mela,
for the honeyed sweetness of her disposition, her conversation being wholly
without bitternsse: it was a Dove without gall, but a chaste Dove having no eyes
but for her mate: Speusippe failed not to express at this wedding how much it
joyed him to see his brother of alliance so well matched, he called Mela
sister, and this young Lady who saw but through the eyes of her husband,
knowing how much he esteemed Speusippe, could do no less then hold him in
estimation, as the best friend Liberat had in the world, she called him
likewise brother, and cherished him in the same manner, as if she had indeed
been his sister.

It is to be believed that the first months of this marriage passed with much
innocence on Speusippes part, and that he thought only to honor Mela, as his
sister of alliance, but traiterous love who blinds all, and surpriseth even
the most wary, and is so good an Archer, that he hits none but hearts, setting
himself in ambuscado in Melas eyes, hit the heart of Speusippe with a mortal
str^ke. Now though all that Liberat had were in his power, excepting his wife,
yet he desired what was prohibited, and despised what was permitted: this
stinking flame burned not long ere he made the blackness and smoke thereof
appear to Mela, who being as full of mildness, as discretion, labored to
quench it by the most prudent and most reasonable remedies she could devise,
unwitting that prudence and reason cure not a folly which is not capable
thereof; this mildness was oil in Speusippes fire, his hopes which would have
been extinct by a rougher usage, were inflamed by the swavity of this humor,
so natural in fair Mela, he passed unto importunity and insolences,
whereupon Mela showed him the wrong he did unto his friend, so impudently to
undertake against the honor of his wife, he replied that the advantages of
love were so far above friendship, that albeit he cherished Liberat as a
brother, yet she had beauties which constrained him to be perfidious, for to
satisfy his passion; behold how this blinded man would be victorious by what
he confessed himself vanquished, and make his triumph of his perfidiousnesse:
Mela being her self reduced unto great extremities by the pressing fooleries
of this impudent man, threatened him to tell her husband thereof. Madame, said
he, you may work means to make me dye, but not to leave loving you: your
husband may take life from me, but not love, and yet will I give him half the
fear too, if he set upon me like a man: it lies in you to avoid this
mischief by yielding unto reason; (so did this brutish man call his foul
desire) at length Mela who fearing to bring a bloody quarrel on her husbands
hands, having tried by her patience, by her mildness, by her persuasions, by
her entreaties, and by all manner of honest means to put this incurable spirit
into his right senses again, constrained by the persecutions of this furious
creature, whose rage passed into actions so insolent, that they were
insufferable to an honest woman, disclosed unto Liberat, Speusippes impudent
attempt against the reverence of his marriage, and the honor of his bed,
although Liberat had cause to seek by arms the revenge of so great a wrong,
yet giving unto his eminent friendship, and the violence of love, a pardon
which could not have been wrested from his anger, he was contented only to
forbid Speusippe the entrance of his house, till absence had put water on his
fire, and time had made him wiser, although this presumptuous man bore this
forbidding without much impatience, as if he had been banished for ever from
his Country: nevertheless he dissembled his discontent, resolving to attain
unto the end of his enterpriseat what peril soever; his flame must needs have
been great, being it lasted without having the sight of its object to feed it;
passing away his sad days in obscurities and incomparable disquiets. After he
had tried in vain all manner of means to approach Mela, he be thought
himself of an industry wherein the Foxes skin should precede the Lions,
roaming night and day about Liberats house, he learned that this Gentleman was
on a point to take a journey from home for some days: he took occasion on
this absence to play his stratagem, which was this, he caused his beard to be
cut after another fashion than he used to wear it, and having blackt himself
with a certain compound, he had quite changed the countenance and complexion
of his face. Then disguised like one of those that carry bone lace in boxes
about the Country to sell, he came to Liberats house: Mela having occasion to
buy of this ware, caused him to come in. He unfolds his laces of diverse sorts
and at cheap rates, which invites this Lady to buy a good quantity. Speusippe
seeing himself in the chamber, steps to the door, locks it, and discovering
himself, begins again to press her according to his former importunities, to
take pity on his languishing torment. Mela seeing her self surprised, sought
by her accustomed sweet persuasions to appease his mind: but this Tiger growing
more fierce by this harmony, and intending to hazard all, draws out a poignard,
which he sets to her throat, threatening to kill her if she yielded not. Mela
affrighted cries out. This cry was heard by a maid that was in a Wardrobe
near: she comes to the noise, and sees her mistress calling for help, and
defending her self courageously against this impudent man, the maid runs
against the chamber door, gets it open, and set all the house in an uprore: the
servants flock thither, incompasse Speusippe on all sides, and hinder him from
ravishing Mela. He lays hold on the collar of one, and in a desperate rage
stabs him through diverse times with the poignard he had in his hand, and so
kills him. Mean time Mela got away, leaving Speusippe bestirring himself
among these servants, like a wild Boar among a kennell of hounds, he hurt
more of them, and was hurt himself, and in the end taken and put into a
chamber which served him for a prison until the return of Liberat: who to do
good unto this perfidious man, in stead either of punishing him according to
his deserts, or causing him to be punished by justice, he got him healed of
some slight wounds which he had received, and lest the Magistrates should lay
hold on him for the murder of the man, and the attempted rape, he gave him
means to escape, only admonishing him to be more stayed thenceforward, and
pardoned him his folly, which he attributed to the rage of an excessive love.
Wherein this good man resembled the Goat in the fable, who suckled the young
Wolf, which being grown great did afterward devour her.

This furious and impudent attempt so friendly forgiven, could not yet mollify
the wickedness of his heart: but seeing all passages shut, and no way left him
to approach Mela, who shuns him as the sheep does the wolf, he sends a
challenge to Liberat, whereby he lets him understand, that his extreme love
making him more worthy than he to possess fair Mela. He calls him to combat,
to see unto whom the fortune of arms will give the conquest. Ah Fool, who
knew not that by the Law a woman cannot marry the murderer of her husband, but
she must make her self accessory and guilty of his death. Liberat pressed as
well by this foolish and false rule of honor, which passes for a maxim among
the Nobility and Gentry of France, as by the desire of punishing at once so
many wrongs which he had received by this insolent man, goes to the place
assigned, where after he had upbraided Speusippe with his perfidiousnesse,
they began a terrible combat: for if Speusippe, set on by love and despair, two
enraged passions, bestirres himself with might and maine, as a man that will
overcome or die; Liberat pressed by the representment of so many indignities,
which he had received from this impudent creature, was no less eager to make
him feel the point of his sword. Already they had hurt each other in diverse
places, and their blood served to animate them more on; when fortune, which is
not always on the right side, permitted Liberats sword to break in the middle
against the hilt of Speusiippes dagger. Speusippe then seeing the life of
Liberat at his mercy, began to tell him that he must yield him his wife, or
else he would presently kill him. Thou may take away my life, replied
Liberat, but never mine honor, I will die with that on my brow, and thou shall
live with the greatest infamy wherewith a gentleman can be covered. You dispute
the case too long, said Speusippe, I must by the loss of thy life break the
knot which is betwixt thee and Mela, the only obstacle to my desires, that I
may possess her alone. Saying so he presses Liberat, who did but ward, and at
last seeing himself out of combat, he seeks his safety in his legs, and
betakes himself to flight. Speusippe followed him, and as he went to thrust
his sword into his back, it happened that Liberat fell, and Speusippe stumbled
over him, and hit his nose so hard against the ground, that he lay quite stund
with the fall. Liberat losing neither time nor judgment, gets upon him, stabs
his poignard three or four times in his belly, and made him yield up that
unlucky soul, which after so many perfidious impudencies and desperate furies
went into its place. Such was the execrable end of this frantic man's attempts,
an end which makes us see a just judgment of God upon his head, worthy indeed
of a more cruel and of a more ignominious punishment. For what shameful
execution did not he deserve, who with such an enraged presumption violated the
laws of friendship, of honor, of pudicity, and of piety, and did so many
actions contrary to reason and equity? for my part, I expose him to the view of
the world, as a man worthy of public hatred, and whose memory ought to be
detested by all those that profess an honorable friendship.

THE VNLVCKY FAINING: OR, Counterfeiting.
The Eight Relation.
WE must never feign, because fainings ever end with complaynings, and although
that sometimes one faines in sport and merriment, these laughters as are
commonly followed by tears, and dissimulations, is accompanied with true
chastisement. Not long since in a City of Celticke-gaule a Gentleman, named
Basian, having undergon all the harshest things that love causes any to suffer
in a lawful wooing, at last obtained in marriage, a Maid whom we will call
Ephese the beginning of this aliance was so happy, that nothing could equalize
the felicity of these two conjoined persons, for Basian resembling those that
find honey far more sweeter, after the taste of wormwood, likewise after so
many difficulties of getting, what he so greatly desired, he enjoyed it with a
contentment surpassing expression, but even as diverse reject those meats being
in health, which they extremely desired being sick; so the facility of
conjugall society slackned, at last the ardent passion which Basian had felt
from Ephese before he possessed her; it is true, that Ephese was partly the
cause of this disgrace, by taking into her service a Gentlewoman whose name
shall be Leonille, and whose admirable beauty could not be considered without an
interior alarm, this object appeared before the eyes of Basian when the
fervency of his first affections were entering into the wane. Ephese thought
she held him fast by her former charms and believed she had conquered his
heart that nothing could be able to alter his affection toward her, and upon
this she heeded not how in taking this Gentlewoman into her house, she
received therein the horse of Troy which should be the ruin and destruction
thereof, and indeed this young beauty of Leonille accompanied with graces and
behaviors able to breed many illusions, presently struck the senses of
Basian, and turned his heart from the right way to lead it after adulterous
imaginations, he so long desembled his passion, and hid it from his wife with
so much circumspection, that she perceived it not until remedies were out of
season, add moreover that Leonille charmed by Basians presents and by the
hopes of his fair promises lent him so favorable an ear, that he hoped in
short time, to win this fort which began to come to a Parley, the bargain is
half made with a second Merchant when the first is distastful unto one, it was
impossible for Basian to hide his fire so well, but that some sparks thereof
appeared, and what means may be used to hide what is, from the sharp sight of
a jealous woman, who often sees what is not; when this Lady using the authority
of of a Mistress would have put away from her house this arrogant Agar, grown
haughty by the favor of her Mistress she then knew by Basians resisting it,
that there was betwixt them some secret intelligence which could not but be
prejudicial unto her, with what eye did she since behold this rival servant
I leave it to your consideration; Basians two eyes were not enough to behold
this rising sun whose bright shining dazeled him so, that he had no looks
left for Ephese, but such as were languishing, and weak, contrariwise this
woman through jealousy became capritious and clamorous, and brawling, and
filling her house with unquietness put Basian into so bad an humor that he
began to storm about her, and to use her very harshly, alas one sprig of
wormwood is enough to alter the sweetness of a great quantity of honey, and
one cobweb enough to in tangle the whole* Economy of a Hive, the house wherein
jealousy takes footing goes quite backward, and very unfortunate is that
family, where this plague breeds, it is a worm which gnawes the fairest
fruits, it is a wind which raises nothing but tempest, and those tempests
lead unto assured wrackes, indeed Basian did ill to give Ephese so much cause,
but Ephese was not well advised in thinking to drive unlawful love from the
heart of her husband by her harshnesse, and reproachful speeches; if one nail
drives out another, she should have labored to make her self more lovely, to
be the better beloved; but despite suggested unto her a malicious invention
revealed by flesh and blood, and which had the evil success that you shall
understand; she had taken the Son of a poor Gentleman to serve her in her
Chamber, to wait on her abroad, and to carry her Cushion to Church and such
like, and had clothed him in Pages apparel, this child could not be above ten
or eleven years of age, and was very beautiful, she affected him for his
pretienesse, he Sung well and and she took care to make him learn many
honest exercises; she was of opinion, that by cherising and making much of this
Boy, before her husbands face, she might recall him to her again by the hammer
of jealousy, or at least give him a part of that torment, which she left by
reason of Leonille; she then behaved her self in such a manner, and did such
immoderate actions with this innocent, whose age and strength was not capable
of any evil, that it was ill taken of Basian, who dissembled not unto her his
dislike thereof, and she who thought then to have attained the end of her
intentions, redoubled her blandishments with so much unseemelinesse, that no
patience was able any longer to suffer them; But when Basian perceived that
she did play these pranks more to spite him, then for any evil she committed
with this Child, he resolved to punish her by a Faining or Counterfeiting
likewise, and to scare her so, that she should loose the custom of seeing
these things which passed not without some kind of scandal.

He buys one of these Poyniards which Players use to commit fained murders in
their tragedies, and to deceive the eyes of the beholders, the blade hides it
self in the handle, when the point leanes against the stomach, so that the
spectators think that it enters into the body, he put a little bladder of
blood at the end of the haft, and one night as his wife began more
licenciously then ever to hug, kiss, and make much of her Adonis, he comes to
her with his Dagger in his hand, as if he had been transported with anger,
strikes this page three or four blows therewith, and made the blood of the
bladder spurt on his wifes sace, then throwing by the child, comes to her and
gives her so many stabs on the breast and on the head that this pore woman
believing herself to be run through on all sides (though she were not at
all) conceaved such fear that without any manner of wound or hurt she fell
stark dead at his feet: presently the report fled all over the City that
Basian had stabd his wife having taken her in adultery with her fair Page; if
Basian were amazed to see his faining bring so unfortunate a conclusion, you
may judge; the Magistrates came to enquire of the fact; and he declares the
truth according as I have related it, he shows the poignard and the blood
which he had put to it, Ephese is visited, and found without any manner of
wound and so is the child likewise who being not capable of so much fear, had
no harm at all, notwithstanding the first impression that ran about the
world of this murder was so strong that it was impossible to blot it out;
every one held Ephese for an infamous adulteress, neither considering the age
of the child incapable of comitting it, nor receving the truth as Basian
declared it, diverse being of opinion that it was so said for to save the honor
of the children and kindred; the world being full of malignity ever takes
actions in the worst part, and if it gives a bad interpretation to the best,
what will it give to those that have in them some show of evil; mean time the
matter stayed not there; for although the Magistrates grounding their
judgments upon very probable conjectures left Basian without punishment, the
Physicians attributing the cause of Epheses death to the force of imagination
which had given her the stroke of it, whereof they alleged diverse examples,
Euloge brother unto this Lady a Gentleman of great courage and who through
some secret hatred had formerly opposed this marriage when Basian was a Suitor,
being not able to suffer that his dead sister should be defamed by detracting
tongues, nor that Basians Faining should remain without a true chastisment he
challenges him.

And not withstanding that Basian made show unto him of much sorrow and
affliction for the death of Ephese and that he published her to have been an
honest woman worthy of honor and praise yet nothing would satisfy Euloge but
Basians blood which he drew out of his body together with his soul, cooling in
this manner the immoderate heat of his affection to Leonille whom it was
thought he should marry; it may be these adulterate affections drew on him the
hand of God by Euloges sword; which verifies this that the unjust deceiptfull
man shallbe overtaken by an unluckie end.

THE DOUBLE FRATRICIDE.
The ninth Relation.
IT is not thirty years since one of the most famous Cities of France was the
stage whereon the tragical accident which I am going to relate was acted. If
the love of wealth could arm blood against blood, as we have seen in the
relation of the treacherous Brother in law, that if sensuality breeds here a
reciprocal fratricide; the scandal whereof I will hide under borrowed names,
without losing the utility of the example.

Widows who in the use of marriage have learned ways to allure men, do
doubtless cast forth more dangerous attractions than does the simplicity of
maids. These neat mourning weeds wherewith they curiously adorn themselves,
are nothing behind the finest ornaments wherewith those do deck themselves that
either have or desire to have husbands. Contrariwise even as the Sun coming
from under a cloud casts forth its rays the more ardent, and as the coals are
quicker and brighter that come from under the ashes, so likewise those looks
or rather darts that are cast from under the Cypres or veiles wherewith Widows
cover themselves, with more desire to see and be seen, than to hide
themselves, do make in men's hearts impressions that are not slight. I advance
all this in regard of Permene a young Widow, who having bin but three years
under the yoke of marriage, and having not yet attained but unto the twentieth
of her age, bred more desire of her new conquest in those who considered her
beauty under so many black attyres, than pity of her widowhood, and to say
truth, her sparkling eyes, her ruddy cheeks, her studdied countenance, her
pleasing speeches, and her ordinary conversing among companies, sufficiently
witnessed that she was not of those right widows separated from men both in
body and heart, but that her frequentation was not so much a diverting from
so^row, as a desire to find a rock whereon in the bands of Hymen to make a
second wrack of her liberty. It is true, that as soon as she was a widow,
going into a monastery, to receive some consolation from a kinsman she had
therein, she received there as it were a kind of prediction that she should
no more be married: A thing which she scoffed at in her heart, when she had
resolved the quite contrary, as she testified since by her demeanours.

This Widow being the North star of many, who in respect of her embarked
themselves on the tempestuous sea of love, yet was by none adored with so much
submission, nor more loved than by Prelidian, who was a gentleman of thirty
years of age, having neither father nor mother, and being in full possession
of his estate, had both matched his sister according to her quality, and
discharged the part of Babilas his younger brother, who was in the six and
twentieth year of his age, and according to his boiling courage, was gone to
seek occasions to make himself known in the Armies of Flanders, the Theater
of war for the space of these threescore years. Whilst Babilas is in the
rough exercises of Mars, Prelidian is amongst the tents, or rather amongst the
attends of Love: For this little Archer has his Soldiers, his Champions, and
his Armies, as well as the brother of furious Bellona. And truly Prelidian had
no small battles to fight, to purchase the first rank amongst those that
sought the conquest of the fair Widow, because that each one of these suitors
putting themselves to expenses, strove which should appear bravest, and which
should yield her most dutiful and acceptable service. This woman was well
resolved to marry again, but not so soon: she would a little taste of
liberty first, and be sometime her own woman, before she would put herself
again under the power of any other.

In her first marriage she had followed the will of (...) Parents, rather then
her own choice. In this second which she meditates, she will fully use her own
free will, and follow the motions of her own mind, and her own election; true
it is that the multitude overcomes her, and the plenty of matches puts her to
the same trouble, as would a scarcity, she can belong but to one, and it is
this one that she is troubled to find out in the plurality; mean while she
feeds her vanity with the delight she takes to see her self courted, adored,
and so well served and attended. She does with her suitors as with Counters,
for she makes their value to be according as she respects, or advances them in
her honest favors, and often times the most advanced were the least beloved:
she had of all sorts of them, some high in Nobility, others elevated in honors
and greatness, others eminent in riches, others whose comely grace, beauty,
dexterity, and valor, supplied the want of wealth and birth; and according to
the sundry motions of her mind, she was sometimes borne toward the one,
sometimes toward the other: and as it is said the Sea changes color according
to the winds that sway on its surface: so according to the regard Parmene had
to wealth, to honors, or to pleasure; she took sundry counsels, but counsels
so insolent, that what she would have in the morning, disliked her in the
evening, her head having no fewer quarters then the Planet that governes the
night: with what knots could this Protegus be held? women's minds do commonly
tend to extremes: they will have men extremely noble, or extreme rich, or
extreme pleasing and complete, and all these extremes are seldom found
together; for all things are not given to all persons; nevertheless Prelidian
insinuates himself into Parmenes favor by a mediocrity representing unto her
how great births call on great expenses, and that from thence proceeds the
ruin of many houses, and a shameful nec^ssity in age, which has most need of
assistance, that great riches without honor, satisfies not generons hearts,
and that beauty without means and birth, is a flower which suddenly sadeth as
a Rose, and leaves nothing behind it but thorns of repentance. Prelidian
afterward reducing all these to a mediocrity to his own advantage, showed her
how he had nobility, sufficient to honor the birth of a Gentleman, that he had
means sufficient honestly to maintain the luster of his nobility, and for the
rest both of his qualities and person, Parmenes eyes were to be Judges thereof.
In fine, so well pleaded he his cause before the tribunal of this imperious
Mistress, that he deserved not only to be heard, but also to take a place in
her favor, not as one of the least, whilst he feeds himself with these fair
hopes (which is the perfume of Lovers) and believes that perseverance and
loyalty will crown his pretensions with a happy end. His younger brother
Babilas returns from war laden with laurels, and with a ^eputation quite
other then his brothers. All his friends highly applauded him at his return,
and as if be had triumphed, there were none but gave great praises unto his
valor; and besides, his soldiers countenance which he had brought from among
the Armies, bad I know not what in it that was stately, together with his
flourishing age, advantaged by a beauty that was not common; as soon as he
heard where his brother was a suitor, he failed not to se^ Parmene, whom he
entertained with Prelidians merits, promising her a perfect felicity if she
confented unto this match. This widow, whose changing humor was disposed to
novelty, met with so many charms in the comely grace and converfation of
Babilas, who among other qualities babled well, that presently all the thoughts
she had had for Prelidian, and for many others of her suitors vanished from her
mind as shadows vanish with the Sun: she had nothing in her head but
Babilas, his only Idea swims in her brain, and fills her imagination: she
thinks no more on honors, nor on riches, the only countenance os this younger
brother bears away her heart; she labors to get this Bird into her net, and
to make him susceptible of the same flame for her, as she suffers for him, but
he resembles the shadow which flies from those that follow it: whether he
understood not, or whether he seemed not to understand the dumb language of
Parmenes eyes and countenance, which spoke very advantageousty for him; he
would never answer thereunto, wherefore this woman was forced to express her
self more plainly, which she did one day when Babilas pressed her to give an
end unto his brothers suit; that shall be, said she, when you give a beginning
unto yours: how a beginning unto mine, Madame, replied Babilas, who has
already told you news of my invisible Mistress? in troth I am so in love with
liberty, that I never yet had any mind to marry: I cannot tell said Parmene,
if your Mistress be invisible, but I know a very visible Gentlewoman, who is
very much your servant: in fine, not to spend time about relating the
particulars of these discourses, she made him understand that she loved him,
and that she would prefer him not only before his brother, but before all
the rest of her suitors, if he would marry her: whether it were that Babilas
had not then any inclination to marriage, or whether he held it an enormeous
disloyalty to incroach upon his brothers bargain, he turned these discourses
into merriment, saying unto Parmene, it was to make a trial of his constancy,
that she had put forth this proposition: but at last this woman having assured
him by oaths, and by all the persuasions which can purchase belief, that she
spoke but truth: Babilas entreated her to excuse him, and to believe that if it
were not in regard of his brother, whose interest therein was but too visible,
he would esteem her affection for a great honor and happiness, seeing she
offered him together with the possession of an eminent beauty, a fortune more
worthy an elder brother than a younger. Parmene represents unto him how the care
of his own preferment should be dearer to him, then his brothers, and how
therein he expressed his fraternall affection by a blameworthy excess, and that
for her part seeing it was so, she would content them both by receiving neither
the one nor the other; not the elder because she would not have him, nor the
younger, because he rejected her in that manner.

Madam, replied Babilas, Justice requires that the first entered into service,
should be the first rewarded: all the world would blame me if I should play so
treacherous a part by my brother, as to incroach upon his design: there is no
treachery in that said Parmene, being you have no intent to supplant him: if
there be any fault, I shall draw it all on me, since it is I that make choice
of you, being free to choose whom I please, and if it were so, I should prefer
my suitors by the order of their coming, your brother should take place among
the last, for many were before him; but I see you would color your coldness
with a false veise, and color your contempt with a kind of Justice; if it be
a contempt, that which draws me from your service (replied Babilas) I desire
that heaven may never forgive me that offense: I have eyes to see your beauty,
and to see it and to love it would be but one and the same thing, were it not
the obstacle which I have proposed unto you. I have judgment enough to know
your wealth, and the merits of your person, but to drive my brother into
despair, is a thing which I cannot do without horror; use means that he may
give over his suit, and I am yours. These last words cast forth of Babilas
mouth without well weighing, caused much mischief, for Parmene to purchase him,
betook her self to use Prelidian so cruelly and disdainefully, that if his love
had not been stronger then all these outrageous abuses, he would have cured
himself by a just despite, but as winds increase flames, his increased by
this rough usage, and the more she strove to drive him from her, the more he
labored to approach and to please her; in the end, the cruelty of this woman
wearied the patience of Prelidian, who loosing all hope of conquering, he
resolvcs to turn Capuchin, and he kept the design so secret, that even his
brother had not so much as a mistrust thereof, so that they sooner knew of his
vesture, then of any intent he had to enter into that order.

Parmene hearing of the resolution of Prelidian, believes her self to be
arrived unto the end of her pretensions for Babilas, and the first time she
saw him said to him, Well, do you now remember your promise? What promise Madam?
(says he) To be mine (replies Parmene) as soon as your brother should give
over his suit. Madam (says Babilas) he is indeed entered into the Capuchins,
yet is he not there after such a manner but that he may come forth again,
being as yet but in the beginning of his Noviceship. His inheritance looks
not on me, until such time as a solemn profession has made him renounce all
that he possesses on earth; til then I can say nothing, for if I should be a
suitor to you before that time, would it not give him occasion to conjecture
that I have been the cause of all your ill using of him, and consequently of
the despair which has driven him to this flight? whereof would ensue a reason
to deprive me of the inheritance which now I may expect, if he sees my
fidelity. Parmene seeing him drive time out to such a length, accused him of
little affection toward her, and thinks him to be engaged in the love and
pursuit of some other: Nevertheless she keepcs her hold with the impatience of
a woman, more accustomed to be entreated than to entreat, and to command than
to request. Mean time Babilas continues his visits at her house, and although
she believes it to be but in the way of complement, yet so it is, that
insensibly he ingages himself to love this Lady, whose passion he sees to be
so great for him, and building his fortunes on his brothers spoils and on his
great match, he already swimmes, in hope of being one day well at ease. Mean
while he makes war with the eye, and not discovering his game he has too
much prudence for a Lover: he will have the one, and not lose the other, but
his fate will give him neither the one nor the other of his pretensions.
Whilst he goes slowly on, Parmene is so disquieted in mind that she cannot be
at any rest, the more she presses him to resolve, the more he deferres his
resolution. At last (said she) Let me hear some favorable answer: I can make
no other, said Babilas, than that which I have already made, I cannot speak
before my brother be professed. But shall I have no other assurance, replied
Parmene? I sell not the skin of a Hare that is running, said he. Whereat
mistrustfull Parmene imagined that without doubt he was engaged elsewhere,
seeing there was no means to heat his ice, and that after the profession of
Prelidian, it would be an easy matter for him to forge some other excuse, and
so she should remain mocked and frustrate of both. Whereupon despite seizing
on her heart, to see her self despised, she cast off her affection from
Babilas, when as the young Gentleman found himself far engaged in love, and
was resolved to declare unto her, that he could have no affection for any other
but she. Not without reason did that ancient Philosopher say, Concord and
Discord to be the beginning of the universal world, being we see it is all
composed of interchanges, when the one goes another comes, he that is borne
thrusts another into the grave, the birth of one affection is the overthrow of
another: The world is of a round form, whose end joins to its beginning, when
as Babilas resolves to be a suitor to Parmene, making account that shame would
be as strong to retain his brother in the Capuchins, as despair had been
powerful to drive him thither, and behaving himself already as a master in
Prelidians inherit^nce; Parmene being sorry to have paid with disdain the
fruitful and violent love of the elder, and to have so much esteemed the
ingratitude of the younger, begins to change battery to what she had
desired, and to desire what she had fled from. It is an easy matter to pluck
up a tree that is new set, and to beat down a wall that is new made. A little
Letter overthrew all the intents of Prelidian, and this spark aided by the
wind of temptation, made him repent the enterprise that he had begun: in lieu
of stopping his ears against this fair inchantresse, this Siren that would
call him back, to cast him away by a lamentable wrack, the Idea of this
beloved face gave him so many alarums in his Cel, that his resolution yielded
unto the flattering violence of its assaults; and notwithstanding all the
remonstrances or admonitions made unto him by the Master of the Novices, he
resolved to return.

Now is Prelidian out of the Monastery, and Babilas frustrate of his double
expectation, of the inheritance whereon he had fastened his affection, and of
the beauty which had wounded his heart: as for the land he must yield it up
because the law is stronger than he; and although he be very sorry in his
heart for his brothers return, yet nevertheless he colors his face with a
feigned joy, and congratulates his coming back, a dissimulation common enough
in this age: but as for his love, which had already taken root in his heart,
that was a thing that he could not so easily cast off as his coat, but
contrariwise sticks firmer to it, by reason of the double interest of pleasure
and profit. Foreseeing himself weaned from the succession of his brother, he
makes account by the possession of Parmene to recompense that loss, and
thinks that the establishment of his fortune depends thereon: he now betakes
himself to visit this woman carefully, and blames himself toward her, with
extraordinary respects and submissions. Parmene imagins all this to be as at
the beginning of their frequentation, and that he courts her for his brother:
but falling into this discourse she hears him sing another note, and sees that
he speaks for himself. This much perplexes the spirit of Parmene, and indeed
it was able to perplexe a stronger than hers, for recalling to her mind the
sweet thoughts she had formerly framed on the fine qualities of Babilas, she
presently falls into a relapse of her first fever, and the heat of love
driving out the coldness of despite of the loyalty of Prelidian, seemed to
her but a fantasme. How mutable a thing is a woman? even so variable, that they
may be said to build on quicke-sands, who lay the foundation of their hopes on
the faith of this sex. Now were her eyes in few days changed toward
Prelidian, they are but disdainful and ominous Comets for this elder brother,
but for Babilas they are lucky and favorable planets. Yet if she had sought
out some pretext to excuse her sicklenesse, and color her change, or if she
had discreetly dissembled her design that Prelidian might not so suddenly have
felt the effects thereof, it may be that this stroke foreseen might have
given him leisure to prepare himself for to suffer it; but to see himself
suddenly fallen from those gracious favors wherein he gloried, and at the same
instant to behold his brother so cherished, so much made off, and in possession
of that which he thinks to be due only unto his imcomparable fidelity, is a
thing he can neither digest nor comprehend.

Parmene so arms her self against him with disdaines that she will neither
hear him nor see him, and contrariwise she cannot live but in the conversation
of Babilas, whom she openly calls her servant, and makes of him her Idol,
which breaks Prelidians heart, a strong jealousy takes possession of his
brain, and presently draws thither furies, wraths, rages, and vengeances, so
that neither blood, nor the long respect which Babilas had born him, nor any
other consideration able to satisfy his mind, from whence reason was banished;
the rage of passion turmoiles his judgment, he walks by no other light but
the furies Torches, who like unlucky night-going fires lead him to
precipitations, yet did nature play its last part violently obtaining a truce
in his spirit, to accoast his brother in a temperate manner, but as soon as he
was entered into discourse with him, the trouble of his soul arising, made him
vomit out a thousand outrageous speeches against the perfidie, treason and
treachery of Babilas who had so supplanted him in the affection of Parmene,
this cloud of words burst out into a thunder of threats, that if he did not
abstain from seeing her, reason requiring that he should yield him place, and
forbidding him to incroach upon his Suite; Babilas like a winning gamster,
whose mind is ever more stayed than the others, who loses both money and
wit, answers him in a temperate manner, that even before he cast himself
among the Capuchins, he had as much access in the favor of Parmene as he
could have wished for to thrust himself into his place, but that his respect
to him had held him back.

That the first affection in Parmene had caused the disdain which had driven
him into a Cloister, that even when he was yet under the Monastique habit, he
had refused this good fortune, only in consideration of him, which refusal
hadbeen the cause of his repeal, that if this be disloyalty he knows not what
loyalty is, that if since his return whether it were that he illhusbanded the
mind of Parmene, or whether this woman changed it, he found himself to be more
in her favor then before, he wonders to see him attribute unto perfidie the
love which this Lady shows unto him, as if it were in his power to dispose of
this woman's Will according to his mind, that he takes a wrong course in seeking
to force love from this widow, whose inclinations are free, and whose election
cannot be forced, that if she will not have him, he looses his time in
seeking to get her, and that i^ this case he was doubly to blame to interdict
him the Suite, first because that he too much expresses his envy, in forbidding
him to purchase a good, which himself cannot have, secondly undertaking to
command him as if he were his Father or his Master, being that majority
putting him in possession of his right made him free from all subjection, and
set him at liberty to take his good fortune wheresoever he could find it, that
he is very willing to respect him as his elder, but he will not suffer his
eldership to transform it self in to a tyrany which is insupportable, that
for his part he should be very glad Parmene would turn her affections and
should no way envy his brother this good match, if it befell him, and therefore
ought he reciprocally not to envy him this good fortune, if she made choice of
his person, and would have him for her husband; certainly if there had remained
any spark of reason in the mind of Prelidian he had lent a more favorable
ear unto the speech of Babilas, but when once a soul is possessed with fury and
jealousy noething is capable to satisfy it but vengeance; resist a bacchant
when she is in her frantic fit (says that ancient poet) and you will make
her but more enraged and furious, oppose banks unto a great torrent of waters
and you will make it to swell and be more terrible, so this answer in lieu of
appeasing the boiling wrath of Prelidian made him believe that he was
supplanted by treachery, and that his brother by a secret mine had blown up
all his hopes, he once more commands him to retire from Parmene, and to go to
Mars, or otherwise if he find him near her, he threatens to make him feel
what an elder brother can do to a disobedient younger. These terms could not
the Souldier-like humor of Babilas endure, he cannot frame himself to believe
that the right of eldership extends it self unto sovereignty, and he who like
that King of Athens, thought none greater then himself so long as he had a
sword by his side, answered his brother with such haughty words, that he gave
him to understand he was no whit afraid of his threats, and that whenever
it should come to deeds, he would make him partaker of half the fear.

Hereupon they part and Babilas forsaking his brothers house, where he was wont
to make his a bode, went and lodged at afriends house in the City: his love
linkt to the advancement of his fortune, makes him follow on, and keep his
course to wards the fortunate Islands of Parmenes favor, he continues his
visits, with daily frequentatio^, which wonderfully increased their flames and
ventred so far as to promise each other Marriage, and that naught but death
should separate them, so Babilas is prefered before all his competitors, and
Prilidian quite cast off, hereupon he wonderfully stomachs this repulse, so
that he can no longer hold, but the impostume must burst, he had also bin
less sensible of this affront had it been done by any but his brother, in
fine, he was so rejected by Parmene, that she had forbade him entrance into
her house, yet ceased not he to walk up and down before it, feeding his eyes
with the sight of the walls, wherein this disdainful woman was enclosed, and
by this means he sees Babilas go in and out at all hours, with such
reverences and congees, as by words cannot be expressed.

Babilas looks down from the top of fortunes wheel, and smiles to see
Prelidian stand Sentinel, and watch, whilst he is in Corpse de guard: their
looks which pass from each other, were very stern, as lightenings presaging
some great thunderclap: these were indeed too true presages and forerunners of
a thing so horrible, that I cannot write it without trembling. On a night as
Babilas was coming triumphant from the conversation of Parmene, with all the
verbal assurances that he could wish to have of this woman's says (whose
fickleness being staid, had no more vows but only for him) he was met by
Prelidian, (who like an angry Lion watehed at Parmenes gate) and inflamed with
despite and jealousy, presently draws his sword, and comes to run it
through Babilas, who immediately draws to defend himself, and although he
cried out unto him, brother, what do ye? and that the other replied, I will
take away the life of a traitor that seeks to rob me, whether it were that
Prelidian was blinded with his own passion, or with the shadow of the night, I
know not, but he ran his sword quite through the body of Babilas, and that with
such force, that he ran his own belly upon the sword of Babilas, and so fell
down stark dead, Babilas likewise fell on the ground in a swoone, with his
brothers sword remaining in his body. At the noise of this encounter, people
came running forth, and find this horrible spectacle of the two brothers
swimming in their own blood, the one quite dead, the other having but a small
remainder of life: afterward the sword being drawn out of Babilas his body, he
lived until the next morning, but so seeble, and languishing, that he could no
further come to himself again. A tragical event caused by the fury of blind
love, which is nothing else but jealousy. It is not mine intent to relate the
sundry judgments which passed on this subject; every one construing this
action according to their own minds, and laying the fault on which fide they
pleased. Now Parmene sees her self a widow of her second marriage ere she had
scarce contracted it, and every one casting the blame of this double fratricide
on her inconstancy, whereupon she conceived so much horror thereof in her
mind, that she remained as one dismayed and distracted.

THE DOUBLE RAPE.
The tenth Relation.
NOw let a double rape follow a double fratricide, wherein we shall discover
diverse chances as delectable and remarkable as can be wished. And out of this
mixture of humane actions, by distilling them through the Limbecke of
understanding, we shall extract this healthful water of wisdom, whereof they
do drink, who make profit of all occurrences. In one of the Provinces of Gaul,
which borders upon the inferior Germany, Metell, a poor Gentleman, but one of
the valiantest of his age, borne on the wings of his courage, rather then
upheld by the wealth of his fortune, raised his affections unto Aldegond,
daughter to a Lord of note in the same Province: unto this house he had
success because of his valor, and was there held in the same good opinion
which he had purchased unto himself over all the Country: besides, he had aided
Philapian, father of Aldegonde, both in public war, and in private
quarrels, where he ever made it appear, that his courageous mind was worthy
of a far better fortune. Well, he insinuated himself into the favor of this
Gentle woman, by such ways as do commonly breed good will; humility in his
carriage, modesty in his actions, respect in his speeches, sighs, fannes of
his flame testified his ardour, and his tears the torments which he felt
betwixt the violent motions of his desires, and the smalnesse of his means. O
what pain endure they, whose poverty sur mounteth their magnanimity?
nevertheless his heart being so well seated, as to dare aspire unto a match
whereto he could not attain by all likelihood of humane capacity, but fortune
was so favorable to him, that Aldegonde rather casting her eyes on a man
wanting riches, then on riches wanting a man, settled them on Metell, a person
so complete, that it seemed all valiantness to be gathered together only in
his heart, and all the graces on his face, besides, he had so fine a wit, and
so charming a conversation, principally among women, that he seemed to be born
but only to shake the constancy of the most stayed. He whose thoughts were
only upon the means to become pleasing to Aldegonde, fonnd them so well, that
there was no place in the heart of this Maid, but was filled with the Idea of
his perfections, in this mutual correspondency, they fed themselves with
desires, and their words passed even unto promises, but when they began to
reflect upon the invincible obstacles of the contradiction of Philapian, and
others of the kindred who would never consent unto this match: they endured
unspeakeable sorrows which cannot be conceived but by those who are in the
like anguish: those hurts are most sensible, that happen unto the tendrest
parts of the body, and those wounds, that is to say, those pains that be in
the tenderest faculties of the soul, which are the affections, are not they
the sharpest? whilst these lovers seed on sorrow and tears, (an oil which
maintains their fire) and the more they endure, the more are they constrained
to hide their torment. Imagine what havocke this close kept secret flame made
in their breasts, being it is most certain that silent sorrow, even as an
enclosed ardour, does continually augment and increase. If Philapian had but
never so little perceived that Metell had been so foole-hardy, as to have
raised his thoughts toward his daughter, or if he had had the least suspicion
that Aldegond had bowed down her mind so low as this Gentleman: doubtless
he would soon have made an end of the business: a banishment for ever must
have deprived Metell of a sight dearer to him then the day, and for which alone
he preserved his affections, and yet to dye through a hidden languishment,
without hope of remedy, was a thing whereunto these young spirits could hardly
frame themselves, for who can hide quick coals in his bosom, and not be
forced to discover them, but as they are in this state like a ship at sea
wanting wi^de, and so becalmed, that it cannot go either backward or forward,
they find no better remedy then pa^ience, and by a sweet and gentle
conversation, they moderate the violence of their wishes, but the world is a
Sea which remains not long quiet, and here comes a boisterous blast that will
trouble that little calm which they have. Epolon an old Lord os the same
Province, whose warlike humor could not long be at roast, had been to seek the
theater of Mars amongst the rebels of the Belgicke Provinces, and weary of this
exercise, some what ill befitting his age, which then required naught save good
cheer, and tranquillity, he came back unto his own house, where he was in
great ease and magnificence, by reason of his large possessions. This man had
been some few years a widdower, and had children which might seem to oblige
him not to enter any more into marriage, but single life agreed not with his
inclination, which was no less amorous then martial, whereof here is a
sufficient testimony. Some little time before his voyage into Holland, he was
ensnared by the beauty of Barsim^e a young widow, who flattered by the
ambitious desire of being a great Lady, had given ear unto this old man's suit,
which began three months after the death of her husband, even when she was
yet in her great mourning. Epolon pressed by the heat of his affection, like
dry straw, which is as soon consumed as kindled, desired to have this marriage
forth with solemnized, but Barsimee retained by a certain shamefastness, and
by the consideration of public decency, would by no means yield to marry
before the year of her mourning was expired; but the old man could not suffer
so long delay, and Barsimee was also unwilling to loose so good a fortune, at
length her foolish imagination dictated unto her a means to accord these
contrarieties, which was to permit unto Epolon what he desired upon a promise
which he made unto her to marry her as soon as the year of mourning was
consumed. Truly in this occasion she showed but little discretion, in not
foreseeing that this restless heat of the old man would presently be quenched
by enjoying, and that being powerful as he was, It would be very difficult for
her to constrain him to hold his bargain, the souldierly humor being
commonly brutish and capricious. The good man's appe^ite was soon satisfied,
and his warlike fantasy returning, he went into Holland, as well to content
his mind in war, as to rid himself of this widow, whose facility and
ambition caused her since to be despised and mocked: a fair looking-glass for
foolish i^considerate women, who venture their honor (which should be dearer
to them then their life, since life without honor is a living death) upon the
vain promise or oath of a lover. Well, Epolon returns from his military
affairs, but no more remembering Barsimee then the sins of his youth, and no
sooner saw he Aldegond in a company wherein he also was, but he felt himself
taken with her beauty, and so stung to the quick, that his life seemed to
depend in that object, but he was not alone wounded by that dart, for Tharsis a
Gentleman of that neighborhood, favored by a wealthy fortune, advantageous
enough to aspire unto the conquest of Aldegond, had wholly set his affections
on this M^id: he was also an intimate friend of Victor, brother to this
Gentlewoman, who passionately desired to have him for his brother in law, and
had wrought the matter, that he had caused Philapian to like thereof, but as
the greater light dimmes the lesser, so as soon as Epolon appeared in the
lists, whose quality and wealth far surpassed those of Tharsis: and the
golden rule by which all things are measured, made Philapian prefer him before
young Tharsis, whereupon the ^^^^^ment is soon made between Epolon and the
(...) of Aldegond, because this amorous old man yeel^ed to all conditions
whatsoever he propounded. Philapian hereupon speaks to his daughter of this
business, who assures him that Tharsis and Epolon are alike indifferent to
her, and when her father would have excused the age of Epolon, thereby to make
her swallow the bitterness os this pill, by guilding it over with the
consideration of so great wealth. Sir, said Aldegond, the youth of Tharsis does
not tempt me, nor the age of Epolon distaste me, I will let you treat according
to your pleasure, with either of them both which you shall best like. The
father taking this for a perfect obedience in his daughter, praised her much
for showing her self so tractable, but he found afterward how this sex can
so well feign, that what is in their lips, is commonly very far from their
heart. Now Tharsis seeing himself cast off by Philapian, went presently unto
his dear friend Victor, who being vexed that his father should break his word,
and that an old man charged with children, should enjoy his sister, yielded
unto the desire of Tharsis, which was to steal her away, making no question
but he should be able to make his peace when the action was done, and could not
be irrevocated, being it was grounded on a commission given him by Philapian,
to be a suitor to Aldegond, but whilst they prepare themselves for this design,
let ut look back to another Mine that is in digging. The widow Barsimee having
intelligence of the marriage that was intended to be between her perfideous
Epolon, and fair Aldegond, went on a day to this Gentlewoman, and having first
obtained liberty of telling her some matters of consequence in private, she
freely declared unto her under the protestations of secrecy, all that had
passed betwixt Epolon and her self, upon the promise of marriage which she
likewise showed her. Aldegond (who desired nothing so much as to meet with some
lawful occasion whereby to break off the propositions of marriage, as well of
Epolon, as of Tharsis, by reason of her dear Metell, to whom she intended to
prove constant) counseled Barsimee to make an opposition by virtue of Epolons
promise: but this widow who feared the formalities of justice, and the credit
of Epolon, could not resolve with her self to do that, but she requested
Aldegond to assist her in the execution of a deceit both good and laudable, for
it should tend to justice, and end in marriage. It is reported said she, that
Epolon desires to marry you privately by night, without any show or
preparation. I do therefore entreat you to put me in your place, and let me
go to Church in stead of you, and there in presence of all the assistants, I
will show him his promise, and oblige him to marry me. This was in the winter
season, when the nights are at the longest; and the Church wherein this marriage
should be celebrated, was reasonable far from Philapians Castle. Aldegond
consents very willingly to Barsimee, whom she promises to receive into her
closet some days before the time, and hereupon she frames an other design,
which she puts in execution with her dear Metel. Mean while Victor and Tharsis
(whose brains were not idle) make an enterprise no less courageous, and that
was to steal Aldegond on the way, as she should be led from the Castle to the
Church: which thing they hoped with ease to accomplish, assisted by the
darkness of the night, and assuring themselves to dispose all things to their
own advantage.

This night (so much desired by Epolon) being come, Aldegond entreats Epolon
and her father to go before and stay for her at the Church, whilst she would
make her self ready and presently take Coach after them with her mother.
Hereupon she goes into her closet, and having dressed Barsimee in her
clothes, this Widow masked and covered with a great scarf because of the
night air, went onwards to the Church with Philapians wife, who took her to
be her daughter. Mean while Aldegond losing no time, gets up on horses which
Metel had caused to be in readiness at the garden gate, and thus rid away with
her beloved, who soon set her on the territories of Flanders, at the same
instant, and which is to be admired at, without having any intelligence.
Tharsis was in ambuscado in the way between the castle and the Church, who
comes presently with his men and incompasses the Coach, and takes Barsimee,
thinking it had been Aldegond. Mean time Victor playing the good son and the
loving brother, was at the Church with Epolon and Philapian, whom he held in
discourse, and seemed to be amazed, when his mother entered in crying like a mad
woman, that her daughter was carried away from her by force. What should they
do? or whether should they go in the dark? At last they returned back to
the Castle, and there spent away the rest of the night in meditating on all
these confusions.

Day being come, whilst Epolon and Philapian like mad men know not what order
to give to this disorder, nor which way to turn them in the finding out of
their lost child, let us a little see the amazement of Tharsis; who being
arrived some three long leagues from the place where he committed this rape,
and entered into a Castle belonging to one of his friends, which he had chosen
as fittest for his retreat, found Barsimee in his hands in stead of Aldegond.

This woman no less affrighted than he, and being not able to imagine from
whence this blast of whirle-winde should come, which had borne her away from
the Port whereunto she tended, in fine having gathered her spirits together,
and understood a part of the stratagem by Tharsis, she freely discovered unto
him her design, and in what manner she happened into his power; and without
disclosing any thing of the private matters that had past betwixt Epolon and
her self, she showed him the promise of marriage which he had made her, and
the which she intended to have shown in the face of the Church, if she had
arrived there as her purpose was. Tharsis accounted himself fortunate in his
misfortune, having at least wise met with so just a cause to hinder the
marriage of Epolon and Aldegond: and enquiring where Philapians daughter was,
Barsimee answered, When she had dressed me in her apparel she locked her self
up in her Closet, where I believe she attends the issue of my action. Tharsis
knowing that the right remedy for the sting of a Scorpion, is presently to
crush him in pieces upon the wound he has made, resolves to return instantly
with Barsimee to Epolon; so he puts her in a Coach, and having promised her all
the assistance that a Knight owes unto an afflicted Lady, they arrive at
Philapians Castle, which they find full of trouble and discontent. Barsimee
having Aldegonds clothes on, and her face maskt, was presently taken for the
daughter of the house; but as soon as she came into the presence of
Philapian, and Epolon taking off her mask, her face made her known not to be
Aldegond; the amazement was so general, that all present, believed themselves
to be in an enchanted Castle, and that what they saw was only illusions. Then
Barsimee, grown bold by the extremity whereunto she saw her self reduced,
holding Epolons promise of marriage in her hand, related from point to point
the stratagem which she had devised with Aldegond, yet shame retained her from
declaring what Epolon had enjoyed. Tharsis on his side to justify his action,
excused himself by the excessive love he bare to Aldegond, and on the
permission which was given him to be a suitor unto her before Epolon ever saw
her. Further protesting that he brought back Barsimee as entire as he had
taken her away, and that he held her to be a very honest and worthy
gentlewoman. At these words Epolon began to laugh, and intending to mock both
him and poor Barsimee, said, It was a thing hard to be believed, that he
should have so fair a gentlewoman in his power al night, without giving her
some proofs of his valor, and that for his part were she his wife, he would
not deliver her into the keeping of such a gentleman as Tharsis was without
very strong security.

Tharsis (who swore seriously and truly) grew angry at the old man's flouts, and
redoubling his protestations, yet more solemnly than at the first, that
Barsimee had been no otherwise used by him, than with all manner of honesty and
respect, and that she was too wise to suffer her self to be surprised. The
conquest of her (replied the scoffer Epolon) were more difficult for young men
than for old, and she had been less favorable to you than to me, who have
not found her so untractable. These words highly offended Tharsis, who finding
himself obliged to defend the honor of this lady, gave him this reply, Sir
you spit upon your own face, and this Lady being your own true wife,
according to the promise which you have made her thereof; you dishonor your
self in touching her credit. She is not my wife, said Epolon, neither is her
honor mine, yet if she had been wise, it may be I might have kept my promise,
but I will have none of your leavings; if you like her take her, I grutch you
not my part. These outrageous speeches constrained Tharsis to reply in this
manner; She is neitherthy leavings nor mine, but deserves a better then thou
art, and if thou were wise thou would keep thy word; never any honest man
broke it, nor never any man of honor wronged a gentlewoman so cruelly. The
protection which I owe her as a Knight, and the just pretention I have to
Aldegond, makes me wish to see thee and I together with our swords in hand,
that I might wash the honor off the one in thy blood, and make thee with the
loss of thy life lose the hope of the other, and it shall be when and where
thou will that we shall meet. Furious Epolon could not hear out the end of
this discourse, without laying hand on his weapon. Tharsis failed not to reply
in the same accent, and before Philapian and Victor could separate them,
Tharsis had run the old man into the body: presently they were parted but it
was too late, for Epolon had received a wound which left him but one days
life. Victor being an intimate friend to Tharsis, helped him away; who knowing
he could never get his pardon, fled into Germany, where he died in the
Emperors Army.

Epolon lived until the next day, Heaven having lent him so much time as to
call him to account, and to make satisfaction for the wrong he had don.
Barsimee, to repair her honor he gave her his land in sign of marriage, but
such a marriage whereof death soon unloosed the bond.

The same day it was assuredly known that Aldegond rather followed Metel, than
that he had stolen her; and that if it were a Rape, it was done by her
consent. Philapian overcome with so many disorders, whether of grief or of an
apoplexy (which as was thought seized on him) dyed suddenly. Not long after
Metel having married Aldegond in Germany, brought all to a good pass again,
and wrought his peace with the mother, who tenderly loved her daughter, and
dissuaded her son Victor from attempting to right these affronts by the force
of Arms.

Here the folly of Barsimee and the disloyalty of Epolon, serve to elevate or
to make the loyalty and constancy of Metel and Aldegond show the fairer. In
brief, the variety of accidents which happened in this rape, do show unto a
good judgment the sundry lusters of good and evil, even as the neck of a
Dove being exposed before the beams of the Sun, does show in its feathers
sundry transparences.

THE JUST RECOMPENSE.
The eleventh Relation.
ALthough the Maxim of this wicked world be contrary, yet such is the belief
and opinion of the wisest men, that it is the nature and property of a base
abject courage, not to be able to suffer a wrong without some evident revenge.
The same wise men also teach us, that the greatest courages are the most prone
unto acknowledgement; and that it is as difficult for them to endure a good
turn without requital, as for a base mind to put up a wrong without
revenging it to the uttermost. Which made the Tuscane Poet say, That love does
never dispense with not loving the person that loves. From thence comes the
common saying, love that thou may be beloved, but with a stronger tone: when
a man has given all his goods, and all his substance for love, he still
thinks he has not done so much as he ought so precious a thing is love, you
shall see the effects of this verity in the relation, that I am about to
describe.

In Ascoly a city of Poville a Province of the Kingdom of Naples, an honest
Merchants son, whom we will call Metran, fell in love with a Citizens
daughter named Valeria, who bore away the palm of beauty from all the Maids of
that city, now as there was much equality in wealth between the parents of
both parties, so there happened yet to be a greater concordance of humors and
dispositions, so that the match seemed to be framed in Heaven, even from their
births, but as many accidents happen betwixt the cup and the lip, so these two
lovers were like unto those ships which lying at Ankor in the road, and
staying but only for the tide to bring them into the desired haven, see
themselves unawares by a wind from the land driven far into the sea, and in
short space at a great distance each from other. The Father of Valeria was much
obliged to an Earl that dwelt in the City, whom we will conceal under the
name of Armentaire, this Citizen was under the particular Protection of this
Nobleman, who on diverse occasions had showed him much assistance, which was the
cause that amongst those that the Father of Valeria invited at the betroathing
of his Daughter, he entreated the Earl as his good Lord and Patron to be
there, whereunto Armentaire condescended as willing to honor this Citizen whom
he entirely loved, the assembly was come together with much pomp and
magnificence, and there Metran promised unto Valeria, and Valeria unto Metrau
to take each other in the face of the Church, on the day that it should be
agreed upon betwixt their parents: now wanted nothing but only to proceed upon
the solemnities and consummation of this Marriage, the term of few days was
prescribed to prepare and end it, the content of these parties had exceeded,
had not the adjourning of the day (wherein they should have been united) put
water into their wine, and moderated their joy by ensuing troubles, for here
comes an unexpected tempest to cross their quiet navigation, whether it were
that Valeria had added unto her natural beauty the art of ornaments, which made
her exceed all the company, or whether the Earls eyes were more open that day
then they were formerly, so it fell out that the flash of this fair face
dazzled him so that he lost both judgment and knowledge of himself, he was
very ancient, and beside extremely troubled with the Gout, whether it were
that he had it as inheritance, or that it proceeded from his former
intemperancies, all this ought to have dispensed him from inrouling himself
under the Standards of Cupid, where the old and gouty are scarce welcome, old
fools are reckoned amongst things unfit for use* of which Armentaire shows
himself to be one by the foolish part he plays. After he had made a weak
resistance unto the assault, made by this innocent beauty, he yields, resolving
to cure himself of this importunate desire by Marriage, hereupon he goes
forthwith to Bonit the Father of this fair conqueresse, and weeping like a
chlid represents his grief unto him, in such a manner that this good Citizen
his ancient friend took pity thereof, and counted it a great honor and grace
that he should request to have his daughter in marriage, but my Lord (said he)
you know she is betrothed to another, and this promise cannot be broke but by
the consent of both parties. I shall (replied the Earl) deal so bountifully
with Metran that in obliging me he shallbe the better all the days of his
life, and I will so well provide for your daughter that both she and you, yea
and all yours shall be glad thereof. This news was carried by Bonit to Metran
who poor young man received it as the sentence of his death, and indeed to
rende so strong a love from his heart was no less then to tear his soul from
his body, he cannot answer but with tears like to the Stag when he stands at
a bay, ( Bonit pressing him to an answer) he fell presently in a swoune
showing thereby that he could not grant so hard a request but by death, here
pity gave new assaults to the soul of his Father, and truly he had been
very barbarous if he had not been touched with compassion seeing his daughter
so extremly beloved of him whom he had chosen to be his son in law, then goes
he to his daughter to try her mind, who had no other answer but sighs and sobs;
at last amongst many interruptions he learned that her will was in the hands
of Metran, and that having given herself unto him she could noe more dispose
of herself, her Father having left her she opened the ^^^dgat^ of her tears,
tore her hair, and had almost spoiled that fair complexion which nature had
set on her face; so much did she hate that beauty which seemed pleasing to any
other then Metran^ eyes* then Bonit returns to this young man who having with
incredible convulsions of mind digested the bitter thought of the ruin of his
love which he saw to be evident* took at last a courageous resolution, and
such an one as taken contrary to the true intent may seem blameworthy, but
understood aright shall appear excellent. Philosophers distinguish between
loves and say that that which is perfect has no other end but the good of the
person beloved, and that which is imperfect tends to thee utility of the person
that loves. Metran would show the perfection of his love to his dear Valeria,
and seeing the Marriage so evidently advantageous for her, freely took the bit
out of his own mouth to put it into Armentaires, this was the sum of the
answer he made to Bonit, who tenderly embraced him and mixing their tears
together he promised ever to account him as much the raiser of his house as
the Earl, being that herein Armentaire sought nothing but his own content,
and on the contrary, Metran deprived himself of his, only in consideration of
Valerias good* this news was presently carried by Bonit to his daughter who
incredulous desires to here it from her beloveds own mouth, whereupon Metran
being come into the presence of Valeria could hardly endure her looks which
seemed to up^raid^ him with disloyalty so to forsake her and to give ^^^ over
unto another; and before they could speak, both of them fainting, fell to the
ground, palenesse seizing on their faces, their lips were forsaken by their
natural color, and they were thought to be yielding up their lives, but at
length being a little recovered and come to themselves, Metran made it well and
sufficiently appear unto Valeria, that she deceived her self in accounting
that for baseness of heart and disloyalty, which was the greatest act of
magnanimity that his heart could show, to renounce its own proper interests
and pleasure in favor of the thing beloved.

Valeria could not at first conceive this subtilty, her soul being united unto
the soul of Metran, that she believed death it self could not divide them:
what, (said she) has caused thee so easily to forsake me, and so willingly to
give me unto another? Ah Metran, Metran, call you that loving, and perfectly
loving? as for my part, I should not only have preferred you before an Earl,
but before a King also, for I esteem not men for their wealth, and their
greatness, but for their own proper merits. Dear Valeria (replied Metran) the
affection I bear you, being as strong at death, works now in me the same
effect, since it seperates me from you: my vehement desire of your greatness,
makes me deprive my self of the greatest contentment that I could have
wished, and without which my life hence forward shall be but a death: live then
great, honored, happy, rich, most dear Valeria, and by marrying with
Armentaire, become the glory of your kindred, whilst I go miserable, poor,
unhappy, and forlorn Metran spinning out the remainder of my sad days amongst
the lovers of solitude: much ado they had to pluck these lovers from each
others presence: a heart as hard as Adamant, could not but have relented at so
hard a separation.

The words of betrothing being rendered back, the very next morrow, Valeria is
promised to Armentaire, who in few days makes her a Countess, and withal
becomes so idolatrous of her, that both his eyes were not enough for him to
view her withal; mean while Metran, who could rather have dyed, then endured
to see his Mistress in the arms of another, went his way wandering through
Italy for the space of some few years, often changing place, but never heart
nor affection. Armentarie had but one son, and he was married, but had no
child, and that was partly the cause why the Earl did marry again to get
issue, but age and the gowt opposed themselves to his desire.

Moreover, it was generally reported that he was so charmed by the love of a
Courtezan, that he disdained his lawful wife: but as the kind of bad women
resemble the materia prima, which is never satisfied with forms, what expense
soever Hilaire was at for to stay the covetousness of this creature, she still
flew out, and daily bred new distractions in his brain, so that on a time being
thoroughly vexed at her, he used her like a woman of her trade, and marked her
face with the slash of a sharp Rasor, which they there call Coustillade. This
lewd creature seeing her self deprived of that little beauty which made her to
be esteemed, grew so desperate, that she caused Halaire to be murdered by
another of her lovers, with whom she embarked, and got into the Venetian
Territories, a receptacle for such sort of wares. This his sons death
unmeasurably afflicted the Earl, seeing himself deprived of heirs, and out of
all hope of having any children; yet the love he bare to his young wife, was a
charm to all his griefs. But indeed this praise must only be attributed to
the virtuous discretion and carriage of Valeria, that she could so well frame
herself to his humors, and so win his heart, that he had been insensible if
he had not acknowledged her respects: the gowt by little and little wasting
the Earls natural vigor, brought him to the threshold of his ^om be, and
what could he then do better in the acknowledgement of the service received
from his prudent mate, then to make her his heir? (as he did by his solemn
will and testament) and after that he went the way of all flesh, which is the
way to the grave: so long as he lived, Valeria strove all that she might
against the Ideas of her first love which she had borne to Metran: but when
death had broken her bands, and set her at liberty to make her own choice,
even then resumed she her first flames, and resolved to show Metran an example
of her constancy and loyalty: hereupon she sends to the father of this young
man, and prays him to acquaint his son with the death of the Earl, and to
cause him to return home again, with assurance, that she would communicate
something unto him that should give him content.

Metran was then at Genues, laboring to divert his melancholy amongst so many
stately Palaces and delights wherewith this beautiful coast of Liguria does so
abound; but neither the sweetness of this air where Spring lasts all the
year, nor so much wealth and magnificence, wherein this opulent City triumphs,
were not charms strong enough to sweeten his sorrow, he continually catries
the shaft about him that hurtes him, but this news of the Earls death was a
forcible dittany to drive this arrow out of the wound, and he began to hope
well of his fortune, this obstacle being taken away, forthwith he returns to
Ascoli, where he was so courteously welcomed by Valeria, that he well
perceived honors had not changed manners in this woman, and that her love had
been true, seeing it was so constant, she then tells Metran, that because he
so generously yielded her to another, whereby she became a rich Countess, she
would therefore render him the like, by a mutual and reciprocal friendship
which was to make him partaker of her fortune, hereupon she promises to marry
him, after the year of mourning should be expired because she would not
infringe the laws and customs of civil decency; at the end of which term,
she performed her promise, and as Metron by going away had made Valeria a
Countess, so she by recalling him had made him an Earl, preferring him by a
just recompense before so many suitors, who proffered to augment her riches and
honors.

THE VVEAKE CONIECTVRE.
The Twelfth Relation.
FOolish is the Gamster that on aweake Card, venters all he is worth, and more
foolish he who on a weak conjecture, blindly hazardeth his life, as we shall
see in this Relation, but what if love be strong as death, jealousy is a rage
as horrid as hell, and incessantly and without hope torments those that are in
its flames, so jealousy drives into fury and despair those whom it over
takes with violence at foot of those high mountains which take their names
from the fair Pyrenea and which serve as abarricado to France against the
arrogance of Spaniards, a-Gentleman one whom we will conceal under the name of
Fabian, had a daughter that was one of the fairest of the country, she was the
cause of envy in many of her sex, and of desire in many Suitors, and also of a
jealousy which will give occasion unto the murders, wherewith this tragical
relation shall be bloudied: of all those that loved her and sought to have her,
Iule, Audifax, and Adiute, were stricken most to the quick, at least wise if
by the effects we will penetrate unto the force of the cause, Iules fortune was
inferior unto Eleusipes, but yet was the best beloved, Adiute was a party
equal and suitable unto her, but Audifax as much exceeded these two in birth
and means, as a cipres tree exceeds little bushes in height; Fabian who
according to the common desire of parents has nothing so much in heart as to
see his daughter richly and honorably provided for, wishes nothing more then
to see her great by matching with Audifax; the very humor of that Nation being
near enough neighboring to the Spaniard participats in the vanity which
reigns universally beyond the Pyreneans, it had been good, and had not raised
so many troubles, if these three competitors hoping to come all at one time,
this Father had made choice of the greatest to bestow his daughter on: but the
diversity of times making diversity of pretenders, each of them had his
particular reasons, not to yield his suit unto any, Iule the first in date had
so possessed the affections of Eleusipe that there was no place left therein to
receive neither the merits of Adiute, nor yet the greatness of Audifax, and this
love was not grown without the approbation of parrents, for Fabian had been
willing that Iule should be suitor to his daughter, and his wife was so content
therewith that she favored him above all others, which was no small prop unto
Iule's cause: Adiute came since to woo, borne thereunto by his own proper
merit, and besides by a great man who had great power over Fabian.

Audifax, the first in greatness and the last in i am, came with such
asplendour, as Fabians eyes ^were so dazeled thereby, that he forgot all the
permissions which he had given, and all the promises which he had made unto
others. These breaches of word were bad examples in a gentleman, and from
thence came the original of all debates: for Audifax of a lofty and jealous
humor, being not able to suffer that the others should approach her whom he
wooed, caused Fabian to dismiss them. But he not able to get his daughter to
do the like, by reason of the affection she bore to Iule, forged some cold
excuses, wherewith as with false coin he sought to pay these two gentlemen.

The love they bore to the daughter, and the quality of the father of their
common mistress, which they respected in Fabian, stayed them from quarrelling
with him, and each retired without any stir, intending not to give over their
design, but to thwar^ the desires of Audifax as much as possible they could.

Iule, as we have already said, had taken such possession of Fabricies good
liking, that she gave him permission and also opportunity sometimes to see her
daughter, whose inclination she knew to ^end wholly toward this gentleman.
Add thereunto that the arrogancy of Audifax displeased her extremely, for
already under the name of servant, he usurped the authority of a master, and
took a command in the house of Fabian as if he had been in his own. Besides,
he was so jealous of Eleusipe, that he glossed on all her words, on her looks,
on her countenance, and on the smallest of her actions, a torture unsufferable
unto this young gentlewoman, who complained thereof unto her mother, and the
mother took pity of her. It was in the depth of Winter, and in that season
which covers all the mountains with snow, and which invites the Nobility of
the Country to take up their abode in cities. Fabian with his wife and
daughter went to pass their Shrovety de in a city near the principality of
Bearn, the three lovers were the heliotrophes or turne-soles whose sun was
Eleusipe. Audifax only accompanied her openly thither, but the other two
arrived in the town by several ways. The time invited to feasts, to good
cheer, to conversations, to dancing, maskings and mummings, every day some
assembly was made, where Eleusipe with her brightness dimmed the luster of
those beauties which were in the City. Iule and Adiute left no occasion of
seeing her, which much vexed Audifax, but he could not remedy it, because they
saw her not in Fabians house, but in such placesas where he could not forbid
them to come. Some affairs forced Adiute to an absence for some few days:
during which time Iule invented a mask in favor of Eleusipe, and caused her to
be invited to a friends house of his, where being masked he might entertain
her at will. Among those whom he entreated to be maskers with him, was one
Fluriel young man, who danced exceeding well, and had formerly been page to
Adiute; the Masque goes on, it is not for me to relate the invention, it
suffices for my history to say that it was don with the admiration of all the
spectators, although they were ignorant both who was the principal author, and
for whom it was made: so secret had Iule been in his enterprise. Audifax was
there present, being come in that company where he knew Eleusipe was to be. In
masks the liberty of Masquers is very great by reason of their disguise, they
may as long as they please entertain with discourse those whom they choose out,
and it were a gross incivility to interrupt them in their conversation, they
being not bound so much as to answer any one that speaks to them, except they
please, that so they may not be known by their speech. The masque being
ended, Iule made use of the privilege, and having taken Eleusipe aside, talked
with her in secret so long, till jealous Audifax was offended thereat. He had
still kept both his eyes upon the actions of this Masquer, who was talking to
Eleusipe with the countenance of a passionate man; which put Audifax into a
fume, and for to break off their discourse he bethinkes himself to pray
Eleusipe to dance: she excuses herself, in that she cannot without the
Masquers permission, who seemed to be unwilling. This provoked Audifax, and was
the cause that thrusting the Masquer, and calling him importunate man, would
have taken Eleusipe from him, the masquer counterfeiting his speech* said that
he made use of the maskes laws without any importunity, but that he for his
part did violate them with as much indiscretion as incivility.

Audifax stung with these words, and more yet by his jealousy, presently laid
hand on his sword; but Iule was not without defense, for he made a Pistol ring
in his ear, which had shot him through the head, had he not stopped it. The
other Masquers bestirred themselves likewise, so that there was an horrible
confusion. Iule was in the house of his friend, who helped him at need: Audifax
was slightly hurt, but evil fortune would, that as the Masquers were retyring,
poor Fleurid got a thrust with a sword in the back, whereby he fell dead on
the stairs. Being unmaskt and known, Audifax made no doubt but that this
mask had been made by Adiute, in consideration of Eleusipe: The reason of this
conjecture was, that Fluriel had been his Page, and that commonly he had made
use of him when he would make any masque. The absence of Adiute since some
days showed the contrary, but the jealousy of Audifax made him believe that
it was but feigned, and that it was so given out, the better to cover the
mumming. Thereupon Audifax resolved to challenge Adiute, who being returned to
town, saw himself saluted by a letter of defiance, which marked him out the
hour and the place where he should come with a second to make satisfaction for
the affront which Audifax pretended to have received from him. Adiute, who
would willingly have paid dear for a good cause of quarrel against Audifax,
receives this challenge with a free courage, asking no better than to decide
by combat which of them should have Eleusipe. Further, being netled by the
death of his Page, he resolves to fight both for his Love and for his revenge,
two strong spurs to animate a spirit. He goes into the field with a second,
where before they went to it he protests by great oaths unto Audifax, that he
had not made the masque, but that he was two days journey from thence when it
was made: that he knew not what satisfaction Audifax would draw from a wrong
that was not done by him: that he had courage enough to accoast Eleusipe openly
without hiding himself under a masque. This (replied Audifax) is the language
of a coward, who to avoid strokes frames frivolous excuses: we are not come
hither to stand and do nothing, I am but too certain that it was thee who
did make the Masque, and entertain my mistres, notwithstanding that thou were
forbidden so to do: the death of thy page has been the beginning, and thine
shall be the end of my revenge, trifle not out time thus, we must fight.

The wrong thou even now did me (replied Adiute) in giving me the name of
coward, which belongs not unto me, would make me lose a thousand lives rather
than want the washing of its spot in thy blood: the blood of my page killed
treacherously asks this vengeance, the love of my mistres commands me to
punish thy temerity, and my own honor obliges me to make thee lie. This said,
they went to it, and it appeared in three bouts, that the great^st talkers are
not the greatest fencers, because that Adiute extraordinarily provoked, pressed
Audifax so lively and strongly, that he never made thrust but hit, so that
without having the least hurt himself, he laid him on the ground at the third,
making his soul pass out at a large wound, and presently goes to help his
second, who had reduced his man to bad terms. They made him yield up his
weapons, and so left him in the field, from whence being brought back he died
the next day; Adiutes Second having but a flight wound in the arm.

Audifax was of so great parentage, that after this it behooved Adiute to take
flight toward the Pyrenean mountains, and to seek shelter in the territories
of Spain, from the justice of France, although he went unto this duel being
challenged, and had been provoked against reason, and unmeasurably wronged in
the field, and that his act was rather a defense of his honor and his life,
than an assault: yet the power of Audifax parents, made him feel the rigor of
the edicts, which often times falls rather on the least fortunate, than on the
most culpable: he was be headed in efsigie, his goods were confiscate, and he
was constrained to change his native country for a strange land.

Thus is Iule rid of both his Rivals, and might have said as the Raven in the
Fable, who seeing the wolf and the dog fight, on which side soever the victory
falls, the profit shall be mine: he had a new permission to be a suitor to
Eleusipe, whom he had much a do to comfort on the loss of Audifax and
Adjute, and being favored by the mother of this gentlewoman, who without
intermission pressed Fabian to conclude this marriage: it was in fine resolved,
and ended, to the contents of the parties. Iule gathering the harvest of what
the others had sown in their blood. Thus rowles the event of humane things,
and thus the harm of some is the profit of others, mean time we will
principally observe in this relation, the folly and blindness of Audifax, who
on a weak conjecture, on a thought ill cleared, put his life to the hazard of
a duel, his extravagancy not to admit the just satisfaction, which the true
excuse of Adiute presented him, his rashness and his arrogance having bin the
two wings of wax, which melting, hastened him unto the grave: certainly this
Oracle cannot lie, which says, who loves danger, shall perish therein.

THE VANQVISHED Man's Trophy.
The thirteenth Relation.
LEt us continue this matter of Duels, whose extravagancy is so great, both in
form and in cause, that I cannot better compare it, then to the Labyrinth of
Crete, and to its Mynotaure: it is a Labyrinth where men's spirits twirle about
and stray into acts so unreasonable, that they end in folly; it is a minotaure,
for there are none but men beasts who uphold this bruitishnesse: for to do
their selves justice, to make themselves Judges in their own cause, is a
maxim which strikes at all the rules of equity, and yet is it the fundamental
faith of all Duels, therefore how just soever the cause appear, it may be
called unjust justice, and we shall in this relation see this unjust justice
chastised by a just injustice, it being so permitted to punish the pride of an
insolent man, and make the vanquished bear away for a Trophey, the cause of
the combat, and the fruit of the victory, you may well think it is not many
parts of France are so unfortunately fertile in these single combats, that we
will go to seek this history; Champagne was the theater thereof, by the
occasion which I am going to relate.

An old Knight named Project, who had in his time made fair proofs of his
valor, but having followed a side which was not so much for his credit as it
might have been, his services were but ill acknowledged, he then withdrew
himself into his own house, where all he could do, was to make the Serpents
head join to the tail, I mean, make the first day of the year touch the
last without borrowing, then could he not hoord up much, neither could he
forgo any part of his land without much inconveniency, a weak body being very
sensible of the least shocke. His sons went to wars, thereby to augment
their fortunes, and the fortunes of three daughters which he had; two of them
were put into Monasteries, the eldest and the youngest, the middlemost called
Callinice, which was likeliest to be put off, remained in the world to expect
when her beauty, rather then her fathers money would purchase her a husband:
she was perfectly fair, and besides, so virtuous and modest, that if deserving
were having a good match, she had been the best provided; but how beautiful
soever a Maid be, some would have her for a Mistress, that would fear to take
her for his wife, if she brings not wherewithal to make the pot boil. She had
many complementors and admirers, few suitors; thus passed she her time in long
attendance, supported by small hope; I say passed her time, beeause already the
age of twenty and two years, put her in the number of tall, if not of ancient
Maids, although she were in the prime of a beauty, mature, and complete, which
appeared with a great brightness; this iustre hit into the eyes of Thyrse, a
Gentleman of forty, or it may be more years of age, who had done well in the
Armies where he had been a Commander, and had had good issue in many good
occasions: he was of these discreet men, who fear the yoke of marriage, and
whose reflecting spirits find fault in all things. Atlast, the graceful
carriage of Callinice surprised his prudence, he was touched with the virtue of
her beauty, and with the beauty of her virtue, the age, stature, discretion,
conversation, and all, liked him in this Maid; and if he be to make shipwreck
of his liberty, it must be at this fair rock. He was accommodated with a
sufficient forrune, without expecting much from a wise, and this goes well for
Callinice, who has so little, that this little is as nothing, at least wise
our wary Thyrse shall not sell away his power or mastery, being he shall not
have a great portion, nor can his wife cast much in his teeth, seeing she
brings him not much wealth. Upon this resolution he imbarks himself in this
suit, where he was received with open arms. Dry ground does not so much desire
rain or dew, as Project wished to see his daughter provided for; but to see so
advantageous a match for her as Thyrse, that is it which transports him with
joy, because it surpassed his desire and his hope, and besides, he believes
this son in law may help him in his need; all these interests joined
together, with the age of his daughter, and his own which pressed him, cause the
conclusion to be soon made, and the agreements soon past: before our prudent
lover embarked himself, he had taken leisure to know the humor of the mind,
and had found it so to his liking, that he knew not which he loved most in
her, either the mind or the body, and indeed Callinice, who between the
wisdom and the virtue of Thyrse saw her fortune evident in this match, so
discreetly managed her behavior, that she charmed him quite, but it was by
the good and right charms of me^kenesse and honesty: never was the like
correspondency, and Thyrse had reason to believe that he had met with a match,
whereof he might hope for a marriage without thorns: but here comes some that
will prick him to the blood, and will show him that in this world, Roses are
not gathered without hurt: the agreements being made up, there chanced to come
into that Country, a young Gentleman of a good house, but a younger brother, whom
we will call Vincent, he newly returned from Holland, with his head so full of
wind, that in regard he had been in some sieges and encounters, he thought he
had part in all the victories of Grave Maurice; he told many fair tales, he
had bin in all places, and by his own talk he was able to lead an Army, and
he had fought so many duels, he ha^ killed, he had given life; and thus did he
giddy every ones head with his bravadoes, like unto those students, who
returning from the Universities, spit out at their mouth, the superfluities of
their memory; and to show they have studied much, it appears they have no
judgment, and that their learning is rather heaped up, or gathered together
confusedly, then well ordered.

Yet true it is, that this young Gentleman had courage, but his valor was as
yet like unto a green and tart fruit, which time might both have ripened and
seasoned: he was a good horse man, and very good at fencing. As soon as he
came, he begun to roll up and down from house to house, and to visit the
neighborhood as the manner is among Gentlemen in the Country: he came to
Proiects house without any other design, then to salute this old Knight, and
to render him the devoirs which youth owes to the ancient, he was there
welcomed; and as young folk delight not much to be among old, because they are
too serious and too grave for them: Vincent past on presently to the young
Gentlewoman, where he meets with this beauty of Callinice, which gave him a
check, and soon mute-strucken with this luster, as with a thunderclap, he
remained quite astonished, and he whose tongue before giddied all companies,
became now mute as a fish: all the faculties of his soul being as it were
gathered together in his eyes, the more amply to contemplate so many wonders,
being now in the number of the vanquished, he cease to sing his own
victories: in brief, being young and full of ardor, he in an instant becomes a
passionate lover, having not the judgment nor the discretion to moderate the
flame, and to hide his design, he made it known to Callinice, who so far
rejected him, that he was thereat wholly amazed, and in truth, this Gentlewoman
had bin very ill advised, if being not only promised, but also engaged in
affection to Thyrse, she had never so little ^ent ear to the new complements
of this giddy bra^^^, but he loses not courage for this repulse, but
continues his pursuit, at last, learnes that Thyrses woing having preceded his,
had preocupated the mind of Callinice, and that she could not have inclination
to him, as long as Thyrse was on foot. Judge a little on the violent humor of
this youth, who would have all yield to him, faith to be broken, Thyrse to
leave him the place, and all to make way for his desires, who like a furious
torrent, cannot suffer banks, yet let us see if he have wherewithal to
counter-ballance the means of Thyrse: no such matter, for a younger brother,
and poor withal, are too inseparable qualities. He has nothing but his
sword and his hope, which is Alexanders part, and herewith he would pass for
a brave fellow; and because he makes himself skillful, and understanding, he
would have every one think he has much merit, Project had been ill advised
if he had given his daughter to this Gallant for to put two poverties together,
had not that been a marriage to have begotten necessity, therefore they make
him understand that he looses his labor, that the place is taken, and that he
is come too late, and that he shall do well to retire. He that believes that
Maids are to be disputed for like the towns of Holland at the sword point,
turns this unjust color against Thyrse, begins to talk ill of him, taxes
his coldness with unablenesse, his moderation with pusillanimity, his prudence
with cowardice, and because he had some gray hayres on his head, he calls him
old man, a name hard to be borne by one that aspireth to marriage.

Notwithstanding that all these insolences come to the ears of wise Thyrse,
he dissembles them with prudence, and receives these nips as coming from the
hand of a child, holding himself no whit hurt thereby; and casting all the
fault thereof on the weakness of age, and force of love, he sends this
tendrell to school again; in fine, this furious youth seeing them prepare for
publieke betroathing, and that the marriage was going on, resolves to venture
his rest, and without any other cause then for the possession of Callinice, he
challenges Thyrse to decyde by the loss of his life, or of his rivals, unto
whom the fair Maid should remain, he sends him a letter of defiance, so
outrageous, that even snow would have been heat thereby: Thyrse goes unto the
place assigned to chasti^e the insolency of this novice, and make him feel the
strokes of a Master, but outrageous fortune, enemy to virtue, is not commonly
on the best side. This young Gallant was so nimble, and could so well handle his
weapons, that he hits Thyrse where he list, and uses him like a
Quintaine-bagge, flowting him as he lards him, sometimes in the arms,
sometimes in the thighs, at last, weary with paying him in jest, he begins to
fall on in earnest, and with such fierce assaults, that Thyrse having two
thrusts in the body, fell on the ground, weakened by the loss of his blood,
and was feign to yield up his arms, and beg life of this yonker: who for an
addition of victory, made him swear to seek no more after Callinice, and
yield up all his pretentions to him. Thyrse having a poniard held at his
throat, was forced also to pass through this extremity. Hereupon proud
Vincent retires, bearing away the blood, the arms, and the faith of his
rival; could he have desired a more ample victory? Thyrse being carried home,
a Surgeon dressed his wounds, which were not found ^o be mortal, but the
grief and shame to have been subdued by a child, to have begged life, to have
yielded up his arms, to have renounced the possession of his fair Mistress,
did so torture him, that if he had not dreaded eternal torments, he had like
another Cato, torn his wounds, and received death by his own hands; how many
times did he wish that he had suffered himself to be killed in the field,
rather then so shamefully to owe his life unto his adversary? whose insolent
triumph representing it self before his eyes, he resolved to fly to the
furthest part of the world, rather then to endure the sight of it; and in
effect, as soon as he could get out of his bed, having gotten up a good sum
of money, he stole away from the Castle, whereunto he had caused himself to
be carried, and in the obscurity of the night, he took the first way that he
met with: it was not likely that any should know where he was gone, for he
knew not himself whether he was going: at last, being come to knowledge of
himself, he went into Germany, and from thence through Bavaria, he came and
descended into the state of the Venetians, and being at Venice, he embarked
himself in the first ship that set up sail for Constantinople: let us leave
him sailing in full sea, to come and see what Vincent is doing; he wheels about
like a Peacocke, but he shall soon be forced to close up his tail, and hide
his beautiful feathers.

Thyrse appearing no more, and Vincent boasting that he had vanquished him in a
duel, that he had had his blood and his arms, that he had made him beg life,
and renounce his pretentions of Callinice, in stead of applauding this boaster,
it was presently thought that he had murdered him treacherously, and that
having cast his body into some secret place, his vanity thus triumphed on his
reputation. The conjecture is strong, he had Thyrsis weapons which he showed,
and his own stained in his blood, as he said, if he be not dead, where is he
then? that he should be gone to hide himself for shame, there is small
likelihood of that: for the law of duels is such, that arms being hazardous
and uncertain, the honor of the vanquished is washed in his own blood,
whether he dye or dye not. Vincent who believes that praises are perfumes,
which should be burnt but only upon the altar of his merit, goes all about
holding up his head as conqueror of Thyrse. Mean time the brothers and sisters
of this absent man, think him to be dead, and divide among them his
inheritance, whereof they would have thought themselves unworthy, if by way of
justice they should not seek to avenge his blood. Vincent who knew that he had
not killed Thyrse, hides not himself, but shows himself in companies, yea
and he appears even before Callinice, who respects him and abhorres him as the
murderer of her lover, at last in a fair morning he saw himself seized upon
in his bed by the Provost, who was set on by the heirs of Thyrsis.

Now is he in prison, where he yet continues his bravadoes and boastings: his
parents labor to get him forth, but he gets not so easily out of the hands of
justice, the formalities go on, he answers the Judges with assurance that
he has fought with Thyrse, and gotten from him what advantages he desired, he
shows his weapons, denies to have killed him, but that he made him beg life,
and renounce his right to Callinice, the cause of their combat: he acknowledges
to have wounded him in diverse places, and knows not whether he be dead of
those hurts or no. Thyrse is so far off that he is not like to appear, the
suit goes on and is brought to a hearing, the Judges declare Vincent criminal,
for that he had challenged, fought, hurt, and probably killed Thyrse, and they
condemned him as having violated the Edicts, to lose his head. This sentence
pronounced in the morning, was executed ere night, and our triumphant Yonker
saw himself led in a cart, accompanied by the hangman unto the place of
execution, where his head full of wine made as many rebounds as a Baboon; there
was the triumph of his vanity and of his folly.

Thyrse stayed two years in his voyage of Levant, and in the end time having
moderated his displeasures, and beginning to wax weary of his abode among
Infidels, he resolved to return back into Christendom, he arrived in
Sicilia, and thence he came to Rome, from whence he made known unto his
brother and sisters* that he was not yet dead, entreating them to have a care
of his means, and to send him a certain sum of money. This news was
reported to Project and Callinice, who thereby resuscitated their hopes. Thyrse
soon received what he had sent for, together with relation what had past in the
punishment of Vincent: he also had Letters from Callinice, which made him know
the constancy and fidelity of this maid, and wherein she recalled him from his
long exile, and conjured himto come and end their marriage. Thyrse being
returned to his better senses, and judging that he had done in his combat as
much as a valiant man could have done, flattered a new by the Idea of
Callinices beauty, and by that so natural love of the country, which cannot
die but with us, took his way again toward France by Lorette, and from
thence by Bologne, Millaine, Swisse, and Lorraine: he came into Campaign, where
he was received by his friends, as a man risen from death. Short time after he
married Callinice with unspeakable contentments. So the Vanquished bore away
the cause of the combat for a trophy, and shame and death remained for the
conqueror.

THE IDEA.
The fourteenth Relation.
ALL the Idea's which pass through our minds are not always so frivolous as
some think. I will believe that the imagination, which is a very light faculty
of the soul, and as it were the ship of a thousand Chimera's, does forge a
quantity of vain and shallow ones, and which have subsistence but only in the
vast, or rather in the void room of extravagancie: as blind men shooting may
hit the mark without seeing it, even so dreams which are but species and
images altered by the shadows of the night, often serve us as presages.

I here propose unto you an Idea, which you will find very strange, and which
some will attribute unto some consultation of a Soothsayer, or to some
invention. But it happened unto so honest a man of my acquaintance, and I will
say more, mine allye, that on his word I fear not to set it down as a certain
truth; for I know he is a person who hates falsitie as death, and whose piety
and purity are capable of greater revelations. Salviat (let us call him so)
being left an Orphan very young, remained until his full majority under the
power of his tutors: being come unto the time which by the law put him into
government of his own means, he took it in hand, and for to be assisted
therein by the fidelity of a person interessed, he took into his house one of
his sisters a maid of government and judgment, the confidence he had in his
wisdom as much as in her blood, was the cause he concealed none of his
affairs from her, and that he left her the free mannaging of all that belonged
unto him: a desire took him to see Italy, in an age ripe enough to make profit
there of the good qualities of Italians, and to keep himself from the
contagions of the bad ones, as he was in the Court of Rome esteemed to be a
very wise and discreet man. He had left his sister in one of the principal
Cities of France, in the house that had been their fathers, and in the
mannaging of all his revenues. Moreover, he had had by inheritance exceeding
fair household stuff, and especially plate* which amounted unto a great sum.
In great cities the great robberies are committed, as in great rivers the
greatest fishes are taken, some prying fellows having espied that there was
store of fair goods and plate in the house, which was inhabited only by maids
and some little lacqui^s, believed that if they could enter by night they might
get a great booty: hereof they failed not, and having before under color of
showing some mercery wares to sell, spied out and marked the ways and places
of the house, they got in by night, and besmooted their faces that they might
not be known, and seized on this gentlewoman and her dismayed maids, which
were easy to be terrified: they locked them up in a chamber, threatening to cut
their throats if they cried never so little; mean while they open all, choose
out the fairest and best, make up their packes, and go their way at pleasure.
The next day these maids which were thus locked up, durst not yet cry, thinking
still to have the knife at their throat: at last being far on in the day,
hearing no manner of noise in the house, they call out for help, they are
delivered, and it was found that the best things were stolen and carried away.
Never could they discover either wind, smoke, tracke or mark of this robbery.
Oderife, let us thus call this gentlewoman, she writ there of unto her
brother, who the same night that it was done (which they verified by the date
of a letter) had dreamt it in his sleep, and which is admirable, the very
features of the faces, and manner of the thieves apparel were perfectly
presented unto him, and remained so engraven in his imagination, that during so
long time as passed between the deed and the tidings he had thereof by letters,
they could not be blotted out. He writ at length unto his sister* that she
should make enquiry thereabouts, if there were not such manner of men, clothed
in such manner and fashion: the search was made, the thieves were grown so
bold believing to have so well covered their mumming, that they have not
removed from their ordinary dwelling, presently they are taken upon so weak a
conjecture, but before they saw the prison gate, they confessed more then was
required of them, they related the whole circumstance of their theft, whereof
they had wasted a very small matter, notwithstanding their restitution they
were executed. We will observe in this Idea an evident mark of divine justice
upon the wicked, whose chastisement it can further by admirable means, by
reason whereof God watches over those that do evil, for to blot their memory
out of the earth: had I not been well certified by the self same person unto
whom this kind of revelation didhappen, I would not have give^ it place
amongst these relations, but the certainety, which I have thereof has made me
set it down as an event worthy of consideration.

THE UNCONSTANT ambitious Woman.
The Fifteenth Relation.
THose who sail one the sea of this world, which the wind of ambition commonly
make woeful shipwreck, if Arduine passionately loving, over extremely beloved
of Leopert, had been contented with the mediocrity of her fortune, wherein she
enjoyed a repose and a felicity, which are not found in the most eminent
estates, we should not now have cause for this tragical relation, wherein her
example will show us how those that will soar up into the air of fame by
evil means, often find themselves precipitated into a bottomless pit of
shame, Westphalia saw the the birth of this Maid, and even in her tender years
she showed forth rays of beauty, which made many judge this Sunne-rise would
produce a noone-tide of perfection, wherewith Leopert a Gentleman of the same
country was the first touched, and having not sown his affection in
ungrateful ground, they bred reciprocal love in Arduine, as he aspired but
unto her so she respired but to him, and this wooing was carried with so much
judgment on both sides, that although the parents found some difficulties in
this match, yet were they overcome by the constancy of these lovers, the
agreements then were made, and in short time they were betrothed staying for to
accomplish this marriage, but only till such time as the preparations, which
were to be sumptuous should be made, but as betwixt the road and the port
ships sometimes run great hazard, so this match so long pursued so ardently
desired, so constantly expected, had like to have bin thwarted by a tempestuous
blast, Adelard a Lord of great quality and whose luster dimmed all the merits,
which Leopert could have found in himself was so fiercely overtaken by the
graces of Arduine, that he resolved to have her for his wife, and to attempt
all means possible for to break off the promise betwixt Arduine and Leopert,
yea and for to make his mind plain he addresses himself to the parents
knowing that on the maids side preoccupated by affection, thee place was
impregnable and out of butterie, these who had but unwillingly consented to the
alliance of Leopert having in their eyes the bright sun of Adelards
greatness were easily persuaded to uphold his design and to seek means to
hinder Leopert from marrying Arduine, but they found not therein so much
facility as they expected for Leopert besides the love wherewith he was
inflamed, had so great a courage that he would never yeald to Adelard how
great soever he were above him, and Arduine in this occasion showed that
amaides constancy is not always a leaf which turns with the least wind,
for as her betrothed became inflexible to break his word, so she would never
break hers, so that notwithstanding all the persuasions of parents and all
Adelards laboring the marriage was consummated withal the solemnties
necessary thereunto:

These contrarities did but redouble the coutentment of the two lovers who saw
themselves by these indissoluble bonds arrived at the top of their desires, but
it fell out with Arduine as with those blades of steel which break not with
the greatest blows, and yet snapp in pieces sometimes, when they are bended, as
if they were of glass, those marriages which have a great order of love for
foundation, are not always them that last longest in vigor; they must in this
wise bargain, beled by more judici^ll reasons that will have it to succeed
well, Adelard was greatly discontented to see himself frustrate of his
pretentions, and if Leopert only had been an obstacle in his way, he had
sought way by violence to have been rid of him, but seeing that the mind of
Arduine was so far from him, that made him less desirous to make away his
rival, imagining that it would rather purchase him the hatred then the love of
Arduine not knowing how wholly to extinguish the flame which he had conceaved
for this Gentlewoman, he continues to testify unto her that his affection was
not dead and to seek indirectly that which he could not pretend by lawful
ways. Arduine satisfied it may be with the pleasures which she promised unto
herself in the possession of Leopert, began to turn her eyes toward the
mountains of ambition, without considering that high places are subject to
tempests and accompanied with downfals in short time this thought which was but
a fly, became an elephant and representing unto her self how she had refused
to be great by matching with Adelard, sorrow and repentance seized her and
presently made her think on means to recover what she had lost. I might
(said she in her heart) have had the same delights which I have with Leopert I
had been adored by Adelard, who loves me with an extreme affection, and
besides I have gone beyond many of my fellows, which I behold now above me;
how unadvised was I, not to prefer such great wealth and such eminent state
before simple delights which pass away so lightly? truly there is nothing
like unto being in honor and eminency.

Charmed by these illusions she begins to witness by evident signs unto Adelard
that if he suffered for her she endured not less for him, she lends an ear
unto his complements and makes him affected answers, she inflames him by
attractiue looks and favorable entertainements, in brief, she attributes to
her side all that Adelard could have wished for to undo her* unto this new
affection for Adelard succeeded a cooling of good will for Leopert, a humane
heart is too little to lodge two vehement passions at one time, Adelard helped
much thereunto, for judging that he could never make himself Master of her
will, if he brought her not to despise her husband, he neglected not to put
this contempt into her soul, and moreover to breed therein a hatred, and such
a hatred as arrived unto this last point, to desire his death, ungrateful woman
whofor so much love as this man had showed her, recompenses him with such an
aversion; she notwithstanding managed the passages of Adelard in such manner
that without giving him any advantage on her pudicitie she retained him in the
desire of marrying her, giving him no hope of enjoying her but through that
gate, some would counsel Adelard in the crime of poisoning Leopert, which this
fury (for what other name can I give to this cruel woman) did with so much
cuning that the ground covered her fault before the justice of men could
discover her treachery. Leopert being dead (some months after) for she stayed
not the revolution of the year of mourning, she married Adelard, and by this
means mounted up to the top of that greatness which she had so much desired,
but if the delights which she had tasted with Leopert, had seemed light unto
her, these honors seemed unto her but as smoke, and she learned by experience
the truth of this sacred sentence, that all that is here beneath is but vanity
and affliction of spirit: some time after Adelard considering that he slept by
a serpent who might one day as cuningly give him his death as she had done to
Leopert began to enter into distrust of this woman, and not to hold himself in
assurance near her.

Arduine finding some coldness in the love of Adelard, labors by diverse
blandishments and wanton tricks to rekindle his fire, and to melt his Ice, but
this increases the suspicion of Adelard, who knows that dangerous Women cover
their treacheries with their embraces by little and little, this suspicion
changed into belief, this belief into indignation, this indignation burst out
into reproaches and threats, in fine, they were constrained to come unto a
separation of bodies, Adelard being not able to live in quiet near this
creature, of whom he stood in fear as of a fury, he sends her into one of
his houses in the country, where Arduine seeing her self in a profound
solitude, had no other company but her griefs which made her detest the
blindness of ambition that had borne her to make away so good a husband as was
Leopert, for to marry with this second, who contemnes her, among so many and
sundry sorts of thoughts wherewith her spirit was tossed, she gave way to this
one which has lost many imprudent Women, and that was to breed jealousy in
Adelard, for to recall him to her again, among the gentlemen of that
neighborhood, she chose out one capable to make a hammering in Adelards
brain, she invites him to see her often which Melin holds for a great favor,
and not knowing the design of this traiteresse, this poor bird following the
call of her pratlings, runs into the net of a violent love, attracted by the
bait of hope, he believes that this Lady ill used by her husband; seeks in him
revenge, which he desires, but Arduine who wol^make use of him but as of a
lure to bring back Adelard to her fist, held his beak to water, and obliging
him but with common and apparent favors, fed him with smoke, and vain
expectation, mean time she was so far from hiding her kind usage of him,
that it being done only to appear, she made a show far worse then the deed,
resembling those that having Lions, Elephants, and other strange beasts to be
seen, hang out pictures far more extravagant then the beasts themselves, to
allure in those that behold them, Adelard having notice of what passed betwixt
Melin and his wife, presently believed that she was false to him, and that
she that could commit a murder would make no conscience of adultery, he
sought many times to catch both together, this true amorist and this
counterfeiting Woman, but the evil being not arrived unto the effect, he was
not likely to find out the occasion thereof, mean time he feared that this
perfidious Woman should by some subtle poison send him to keep company with
Leopert, for to enjoy her new Medor at will, having then in his opinion,
gathered witnesses sufficient to convince her of adultery, he puts her in suit
to have her condemned, he causes Melin to be seized on, who is put into one
prison, and Arduine into another, not to lay abroad the proceedings of a suite,
I will only say that it was easy for Arduine and Melin to clear themselves of
a crime, which they had not committed, but the divine justice which leaves
nothing unpunished permitted the tongue of Arduine to be converted into a
sword, which cut her own throat, for making her plaints in the prison, against
the malice and ingratitude of Adelard, she happened to say that he had
persuaded her to poison her first husband, and that for to bury that
wickedness in oblivion, he wished to see her dead, such like words fall not to
the ground in prisons, there are Echoes which say them over again, and which
bring them to the ears of the Judges, whereof God makes use for to execute his
vengeance against those that have provoked his wrath, she is examined hereupon,
and varies in first her answer, being pressed further she acknowledges it in
her second; in fine, truth manifested it self through her mouth against her
will there being a witness that Adelard had persuaded her, he easily purged
himself thereof, casting all the crime on Arduine alone, an moreover that the
greatness of Adelard gave him so much credit both at Court, and before the
Magistrates, that it was easy for him to over turn all the misery on the head
of his accusatrix, which made her loose her life by sentence, not as an
adulteress. For Melin was cleared, but as the murderesse of her first husband,
leaving a memorable example unto posterity, that punishment as a shadow
follows in all places the body of this crime, and that early or late he cannot
fail of chastisement, who has committed such an offense, behold whereunto
ambition elevated this Woman, and see the precipice wherein she cast herself,
a lesson for ambitious persons not to mount up unto honors by crimes, if they
will not descend by shame.

THE AMAZON.
The sixteenth Relation.
IT was in the time of Alexander Farnese Prince of Parma, that the Marquess de
Varambon Knight of the golden Fleece, one of the greatest Noblemen of the
County of Burgoigne, and who for his courage and experience, had at that time
fair employments in the armies, received commandment to besiege Bliemberg, a
very strong little town, and near Rhinberg. This brave Captain made his
approches, and without making here a long description of this siege, which I
leave unto these that have at large written the history of the troubles of the
Low Countries, it suffices me to say, that well assaulted and well defended,
the place was battered, the breach being reasonable, a general assault was
given so furiously, that the assailants repulsed diverse times, at last launched
themselves with so much violence through the blows the bodies of the dead and
of the hurt, that they forced down the defendants and entered into the town,
which taken in this sort, suffered all the insolences and outrages which
victors were wont to practice upon the vanquished, who have bin subdued with
their weapons in hand. Let us add moreover, that the place had so obstinatly
held out, that those within would never hearken unto any composition, but
resolved to dye rather than to yield unto the Spaniard, it suffices to say
that it was entirely sacked, and that they pardoned neither age nor sex, nor
honor, nor riches, all was desolate, when the Marquess made himself absolute
master thereof, and that order was given to bury the dead, for fear that the
infection should corrupt the air, and overthrow health, two soldiers were
found on the breach so straightly embraced, that even in this state which has
no more strength it was hard to part them. The vanquishers ardent after prey
and booty, for to have the spoils of these two who were reasonably well
clothed, stripped them quite naked: one of them as white as snow, and of a
wonderful beauty, was found to be a woman. Presently amazement ran through
all the troops, and curiosity labored to know the success of this memorable
adventure: it came unto the ears of the Marquis, and as a man that made much
account of valor and of love, hearing talk of the death of this armed Venus,
who had been found fastened with her Mars. He passionately desired to know who
were these two lovers, for to honor the memory of their courage and of their
fidelity. A soldier who had made proofs of an incomparable generosity, and
who being wounded in diverse places, had yielded himself under the faith of a
Burguignon Captain, who in favor of his virtue took care to have him dressed,
said that he was alone in the City, and it may be in the Country, that could
satisfy the curiosity of the Marquisse, and of so many others who had an
extreme desire to know the truth of this amorous and warlike history.

This hurt prisoner being not able to stir, the Surgeons having but an ill
opinion of his wounds, the Marquisse went to see him, accompanied by diverse
Captains, for to learn from his mouth the particulars of this event. The
sick man resuming an extraordinary vigor, made the discourse thereof in this
manner in his natural tongue, which was high Dutch, and which the Marquess
and most of those that were about him, understood very well: My Lord (said he)
I render thanks unto heaven, that has given me but so much life as I wish
for, to yield in so honorable a company the glorious testimony which I owe to
my love, and to my friendship, which done, think it not strange if I die, for
the causes that made me live being no more, it were a cruelty, and not
humanity, for to dress my wounds, and the way to prolong my death, rather to
preserve my life, I can no more live without friendship, than enjoy the light
of days without eyes, and without sun* even from my birth, I have had an
inclination to love, but an inclination so strong, that I remember not to have
ever lived without some particular affections, but I had never any stronger
than for these two lovers, my friend, and my mistress, which have been found
dead and embraced on the breach: O happy couple! why must the order of wary
have separated our affections, and make me fight in another place? how freely
for to save you from death, would I have suffered my self to have been hewed
in a thousand pieces! or at leastwise I had been your companion inseparable in
death, as I have been in life, but you have out-stript me of a small time:
Stay for me dear souls, and I shall soon be at you. Alas the desire to see
you, rather than to preserve my life, made me yield my arms unto this young
man, in whom my courage has bred pity, but being you are no more in the
number of the living, I will be blotted out from thence, and remain there no
longer time than needs must, for to consigne unto men's remembrance the memory
of our friendship. He made this fine speech with so many sighs, sobbes, and
tears, and with so great a voice, that falling suddenly into faintness, they
thought he was expiring his last. This was attributed unto the pains of the
wounds of his body, but it may be those of his heart were rather the cause
thereof. Yet so it is, that the Marquisse for fear this disturbance should kill
him, retired into another chamber, resolving to put off this matter until he
might be stronger, but when he was come to himself again, and that he saw no
more this fair troop which had appeared about his bed, he entered into such
sorrows and plaints, for that he could not dis-burthen his mind, as moved so
much compassion, that the Marquess being pierced therewith, came back to see
him: who after he had with opportunity craved favor to be heard, proceeded in a
more stayed manner, and with a grave and hardy countenance said thus; My name is
Aleran, my birth noble, my country is the Lantgraviat of Hessen, the place that
saw my entrance into the world is Melsignam near unto Cassel, the seat of my
Prince being in his Court. I bound my self in so straight a friendship with
Incmar a gentleman Native of Rottenburgh who had been bred up as page unto the
Lantgrave, that we were commonly called the Inseparable: those impatiences
which lovers feel when they are from their mistress, we felt when we lost
sight one of another: being together days were unto us hours, and hours were
months when we were asunder, a moment was unto us an age, even in sleeping,
sleep which is a benumming of the powers, was unto us tedious if we were
severed, by reason whereof we commonly made but one bed, we had but one purse
and one table, one and the same house, the same servants, the same Livories,
the same retinue, and when any of our servants were asked unto whom they did
belong, they answered, Unto the two friends, if those that are but one may be
called two: We went sometimes to Rotemberg, sometimes to Melsingnam, to see
our common parents, he was at our house as at his own, and I at his as at
mine, in brief, we lived in an incomparable union.

It happened once as we were at Melsingnam, that my friend saw in a company a
fair maid named Yoland, whose graces so won his heart, that he did nothing
but think on her, and talked to me thereof out of the abundance of his
thoughts. Presently I judged him to be stung with her love, and he
acknowledged so much unto me at my first asking, for he concealed nothing from
me. Truly, said I to him, I am very glad that your affections have addressed
themselves in a place where I may yield you assistance; for besides that it is
in my native Country, I am something allied unto this gentlewoman, and although
it be a far off, yet this affinity gives me a more particular access unto
her, and by me you may with more facility, and more commodiously introduce
your self into her company, and from this frequentation pass into her favor:
you have so much merit, that to see you, know you, and love you go together.
Then Incmar with tears in his eyes (but they were tears of joy) said, Dear
friend, thou think that every one considers me as thou do, and that thy
passion communicates its contagion unto others; I have not so much presumption
as to think to breed affection in this virtuous mind, but it shall suffice
me that she suffer me to honor her, and that the torments that I endure for
her being acceptable, may be a testimony of the sacrifice which I make unto
her of my heart.

Thou art already replied I: in those terms of Idolatry which grow in the
mouths of lovers, and which (as I think) proceed but from the top of the
lips, otherwise these complements would offend heaven and would be so many
blasphemies: for they speak but of altars, of sacrifices, of adorations, of
flames, of victimes, of godesses, of temples, of vows, of praises, of
perfumes, and other such idle things wherewith they entertain their craized
imaginations, thus replied Incmar, do those that are in health laugh at the
actions of them that be sick of hot diseases, in stead of having compassion on
them: but if thou have any compassion on mine, for every lover is wounded, I
pray thee to lend me thy help, and to believe that the greatest proofs that
thou can give me of thy incomparable friendship, shall be thy assistance in
this occasion, my love being to me no less precious nor considerable then my
life: then did I promise to yield him all sorts of good offices, and because I
feared that the issue of this design would not succeed according to his
desires, after that I have labored in vain to diswade him this enterprise
wherein I believed he should unprofitably loose his time, seeing that the
obstacles which I represented unto him augmented his ardor, and that the
difficulties animated him the more unto the pursuit, I swore unto him to pass
over all considerations for his contentment; being nothing was so dear unto
me in the world as to please him. I then found means diverse times to make my
fair kinswoman be seen by my friend who having declared unto her his
affection and discovered that this maid had an inclination to acknowledge it,
entered into great hops the element of lovers, to see his pretentions arrive
unto the port which he desired.

I was every day at Yolandes ears relating unto her the commendable qualities
of Inemar, and my own affection making me eloquent, it was easy for me to
persuade her what I my self believed, for it is requisite that the Orator be
moved, who will move others: to inspire love, one must have a feeling of its
sweet flame, this young bird by little and little suffered her self to be
brought on by my pipe, and to be taken by the inevitable baits of Incmars
conversations: now was he wholly in Yolands favor, but yet although the heart
were won for to arrive unto the possession of this fair body one of the
ornaments of nature, these were obstacles which appeared invincible, but what
is there difficult what is there? impossible unto those that will, and that
love? Graciana step Mother unto Yoland had married Raoul Father to this Maid,
on condition that a son that she had by her first husband should marry this
gentlewoman; when as age had made her capable of marriage, Raoul without any
consideration but of gold, whose dust dasleth the eyes of the clearest sighted,
obliged himself unto this promise, not regarding that so to force the will is
rather the part of a tyrant than of a Father, and then what obedience could
have obliged, fair Yoland to give herself unto a monster, and to love him,
who had all the causes which can give horror, he had a back higher then his
head, capable to ease Atlas of his burden as well as Hercules, if he had been
tall enough and strong enough, but he was so little as one would almost have
thought that since the day of his birth, he had not grown in any part but his
hair, besides that he was so swollen and so round, that one might have taken
him for a great hand worm, or a middle sizd Bowl, his complexion a little
whiter then an Ethiopians, approached unto the color of a sick Spaniard, his
lips big, his cheeks flat, his eyes sunk in, and a nose, enemy unto all other
noses, to avoid it, one should have had a buckler or rather a rampire of
perfumes, for though it had no smelling, it was to be smelt, his stature such
as I have described it, upheld by two legs, so small that the ears of corn
which totter in the field, with the least breath of wind, have firmer
foundations: those were the columns of this Hercules which forbid me to pass
on further in his description: with all these remedies of love, what could he
breed in the spirit of Yoland but hatred, I believe that this aversion helped
not a little to lodge Incmar in her affection, because that coming to compare
so many deformities, with so many graces wherewith my friend was rightly
stored, she found him as worthy of her love as the other to be deprived of it,
whilst these things pass in this manner, and that lovely Incmar possesses the
affections of Yoland, in the same sort as she possessed his: Hugolin that is
the name of the beautiful fellow, which I have painted you out, adding unto
all these deformities that of jealousy, perceived this correspondency, and
well judging that this new love made a shadow on his persuasions, he advertised
Raoul thereof, who to keep his word, and to see his daughter richly mat^ht unto
this only, but singularly ill favored son, promised him to discard this
brave Courtier, he meant Incmar, that thus put crickets into his head, and in
effect he forbad his daughter to see him any more, but seeing this forbidding
was to no purpose, because that Yoland replied that she could not hinder this
gentleman from coming into those companies where she chanced to be.

Raoul talked to Incmar himself and advised him to frame no design on Yoland,
because she was promised unto Hugolin, and that this ware was no more for sale
which was already agreed for, and retained. This discourse very much angered
Incmar who had vomited up his gall against Hugolin, and had spoken more
harshlie to Raoul if the love of the daughter had not kept him back, in respect
to him whom he intended should be his Father in law, and it had been the way
wholly to ruinate his project if he had vexed this man who was naturally
subject to choler and apt to strike, he therefore stroke sail as gently as he
could yet without obliging himself neither to see nor love Yoland, not to
deprive said he his eyes and his heart of the fairest object and the loveliest
in the world, but because he came to know that continuing to see her according
as it fell out it caused her to be ill used by her Father and stormed at by her
step Mother, which was a domestical fastened unto her collar, stirred up
thereunto by jealous Hugolin, who already took upon him the power of a husband
over her that was but promised unto him, he abstained from seeing her by going
to Cassell, where the pleasing objects that the court could furnish his eyes
with all seemed unto him but as the small stars which night lays out in the
sky in absence of the light which makes the day mean while, I kept his p^ace
at Melsingnam near Yoland, who knowing the straight freindship that tied us,
discovered the feelings of her spirits as sincerely to me as she would have
done to Incmar himself, I informed him day by day of the invariable fidelity
of this maid, in whom since absence nor contradictions changed not affection,
but as it is hard to be long in the sun without being tanned, and in a
perfumers shop without drawing from thence good odors it happened unexpected
that the conversation of my kinswoman, but kinswoman in such a degree as I
might have married her without offending the laws, framed I know not what
inclination in my soul which became love, ere I perceived it, I felt not my
self, and her attractions and charms struck so deep into my heart, that I
was a long time in balance, tottering betwixt love and friendship, not knowing
unto which party to yield, at last after strange combats, friendship had the
victory, honor bearing it away over sense, and reason over passion, the
perfect friendship which I had long before contracted with Incmar represented
unto me that if I fastened on Yoland I should commit the most notorious
treachery that can be imagined, and that I should beheld for aright Chelme
which was the cause that making an effort within my self I cast of these
flatering thoughts, wherewith the beauty of Yoland tickled my imagination for
to be fathfull to my friend, contenting my self to love her as a sister whom I
wished to see wife to him that I loved as a brother, and verily I may well put
among the proffes of the greatness of my freindship to Incmar this victory
over my self, and this continual war which I made against my self being
near Yoland, unto whom I did speak of my friend with the same presentment
which I had for my self.

Yet did jealous Hugolin penetrate into our proceedings and as none were
ignorant, that Incmar and I were but one, he had reason to believe that I spoke
for my friend, and that under the veil of kindred I entertained my kinswoman
with another alliance then his. Now does he make unto Raoul the same complaints
of me as of Incmar, the stepmother beholdes me with cross looks when I am
near her daughter in law, and if Hugoline had had as much courage as Jealousy
he might have done me an ill turn: what endeavors soever he used, he could
never cause Yoland to be prohibited seeing me, nor make Raoul forbid me to see
my kinswoman. Blood has I know not what which ties persons with a strain so
strong that it is hard to break it, true it is that Raoul in a more moderate
manner then his humor did bear one time represented to me the marriage
determined to be betwixt his daughter and Hugolin entreating me not to speak
to her of Incmar for fear least the merits of this knight one of the
gallantest of the court should make her see cleerer then need was into Hugolins
imperfections which were but too apparent and that therein I should do him a
pleasure and the duty of a good kinsman, the duty of a good kinsman (replied I)
is to bring back his kinsman unto reason, when he straies from it, now it
seems to me signeur Raoul that you go from it a little, in going about to
make a marriage and destroying the foundations thereof, which consists in the
union of two wills, and if you constrain the will of your daughter this
constraint being diametrally opposed unto fredom, you make the marriage
vicious: knowing then that she has great aversions from this little misshapen
creature (not to say any thing more cruel against Hugolin the^ what our eyes
teach us) I cannot the^ without breach of the duty of a good kinsman fail to
advertise you thereof, that as a good Father you may seek to make your
daughter less rich and more contented.

I know said he how far paternall power does extend, and my daughter is not
ignorant of what obedience she owes me, it does not belong to Maids to meddle
in the choice of their husbands, they ought therein to rely on their parents,
and to have no other will, then the will of those that command them, and for
that matter it is resolved on, my word is past, the state of mine affairs and
good of my house requires it, whether she will or not it must be so, and she
must not put any other affection into her head, but of Hugolin, whose mother I
should never have had, if I had not promised her to make this other marriage of
my daughter with her son: seeing that this man was so settled in this his
resolution, and that it would be but labor lost to seek to remove it out of
his mind. I left him with good words and complements which satisfied him, mean
time the beauty of Yoland daily purchased her beholders, admirers, and new
servants which gave many alarums unto Hugolin, who seeing himself surpassed by
all, in all manner of things excepting riches, feared infinitely to see before
his marriage, so many enemies on his hands as rivals, and after his marriage
more friends then he would have: at last to make himself of a doubtful
possessor an absolute Master, and intending to take such order with Yoland
that he should breed him no more suspicions he resolved to consummate his
marriage, although he had not attained unto the twentieth year of his age,
and that his stature being less then little, and his person weak, made him
seem like a child, Raoul who desired no better then to continue the mannaging
of his estate by his alliance, easily consented thereunto: the fatal day is
appointed for this wedding, I informed Incmar thereof, who presently came
posting to meet Siguen to put by the blow with his best endeavors, he sees
Yoland secretly, and in my presence they renew their vows of fidelity, I for
my part promised all my assistance to their desires, and vowed to sacrifice my
self in the service of their common flames, in the mean time Incmar left no
means unattempted to turn away the storm which menaced the hopes of his love
with shipwracks, he demands Yoland in marriage of her Father, but he is flatly
denied, then he pickes a quarrel with Hugolin, but this little dwarf would
not fight with this man, who by him appeared a Giant. Incmar seeing he would
not come to it, threatens to beat him into powder: whereupon his refuge is to
justice for shelter from this tempest, and Raoul who was much esteemed by the
Lantgrave, goes to Cassel, to complain of the violence of Incmar, who thus
came to trouble the marriage of his daughter. Hereupon the Prince calls Incmar,
and after a harsh reprehension full of sharp words, he forbad him to pass on
any further in seeking to get Yoland, yea he ordained that she should marry
Hugolin, according to the promise which Raoul had made thereof when he wedded
Gracian. This decree from a Sovereigns mouth was without appeal, there was
Incmar out of Court, and out of plea, and moreover menaced with the indignation
of the Prince his sovereign Lord and master, if he troubled the match.

It availed not, though he represented unto him the violence of his love, the
maids affection to him, and the horror she had of Hugolin, whom he describes
to be like a monster, fitter to be smothered betwixt two beds, as a reproach of
nature, than to lie in the arms of Yoland: These were words cast into the
wind, and which in lieu of nullifying, the Prince put him into such a chafe,
that he commanded him to be put in prison, for to teach him to speak more
discreetly; but in fine, some of Incmars friends which were present obtained
his pardon of the Lantgrave, who consented to his enlargement, upon condition
that he should be wiser. Incmar assured the Prince, that he would rather
voluntarily banish himself from his presence and country, than to commit any
thing therein that might be displeasing to him: but he humbly entreated his
Highness to dispense him from swearing that he should no more love Yoland,
because he could not so easily cast off this affection as his doublet,
referring unto the benefit of time the blotting of this Idea out of his memory.

The Prince contented himself herewith, attributing all these discourses which
he called extravagant, unto fooleries, which excess of love puts into those
heads which are possessed therewith. Raoul returns to Melsingnam, for to end
with speed the marriage of his daughter with Hugolin. Behold now whereunto
despair carries the souls possessed with its turbulent passions! there was no
more than three days to the day appointed for the unluckie wedding. Yoland was
resolved to die, rather than pronounce this sad I, which should have tied her
to a monster with an indissolveable knot; and Incmar resolved to lose his life,
rather than to leave his Andromede in these bonds: thereupon it was easy to
persuade Yoland unto a flight, being it was the only gate to get forth of a
misfortune: so enforcing themselves without me, nothing could be done. Judge
now the force of my friendship, it hoodwinked my eyes from all considerations,
for to serve my friend against the honor of my own blood, I in an instant
renounced my country, all my means, the favor of my prince, and all hopes of
Fortune, for to follow the blind desire of these lovers, both which I loved
with incredible passions. It was I that in the obscurity of the night, which
favored our enterprise, drew Yoland forth of her fathers house through a
window, and having cloath^d her in one of my suits, led her to Incmar, who
stayed for us in the fields. With good horses we rid till day with a good speed,
and did so well, that we got out of the Lantgraves territories ere any justice
could lay hold on us; and because we knew that the hands of Princes are long,
finding no safety in high Germany, where our Prince is of that account, as
every one knows, we came down disguised into this inferior Germany, where we
remained not long, ere that little was consumed which the sudden haste of our
departure had permitted us to bring from our country. We could not hope for
succor from thence, being we durst not let any there have tidings from us,
for fear the Lantgraves wrath should yet come and persecute us by his Agent,
in these united Provinces, necessity constrained us then to inrolle our selves
under the States Colors. Behold now unto what degree of courage Love does
elevate a soul which is inflamed with it! Yoland who had taken man's apparel
to follow her Lover, found her self so well in that habit, and took such
delight in all the exercises of arms, that she became an Amazon; she learned
in short time to shoot with a piece, to fence, to ride a horse, in brief, she
had a dexterity in all this far above my reports, and there were none but
took her to be the compleatest gentleman that was in the troops: she makes
her self Incmars comerade, and under the name of Roland a brave ancient
Palidin, and near approaching unto that of Yoland, she made her self famous
in many encounters. Incmar and I were as we had always been, inseparable,
Roland being joined unto us, it was an invincible Geri^n, who meddled with one
of us, had us all three on his hands. To tell you that Incmar married Yoland in
my presence I think it not needful, being that you may imagine it, and that
gave them a privilege which is neither honest nor permitted, but unto those
that are bound with this band. When I saw them in the possession of their
desires, it was then that I did discover unto them those which I had had, and
with how much labor and pain I had overcome their violence, in consideration
of the friendship I bore to Incmar: They admired this victory which I had
gotten over my self, and Incmar swore he loved me the better for it (if any
thing could be added to what was infinite) since I had suffocated my love in
favor of his friendship; and Yoland judging the force of her charms which had
touched my spirit, beheld me as one of her slaves, and protested to me, that
saving her honor, after the love due to Incmar, she loved no man better tha^ my
self; I swore unto her the love of a brother, and she swore to me the love of
a sister, and out of nobleness of humor both she and Incmar gave me leave to
call her my mistress, and she called me her servant, and there was all the
favors that ever I had of her, besides that of sometimes kissing her no less
valiant than fair hand.

She had a beauty of face annexed unto such a majesty, that if the one inflamed
me with love, the other freezed me with fear, and I may say, that the
friendship of my friend, and the love of this chaste mistress, reigned in my
heart with such an equal counterpoise, that to die I would not have done any
thing to the prejudice of either. And that was it that did sweep away from my
spirit all the unjust thoughts that since might have there increased, in
revolting it self against reason. To tell you something of what passed in our
Country after our flight, we heard by some secret friends unto our parents,
that the prince unmeasurably incensed against us, ordained that the law should
proceed as against ravishers, we were condemned to lose our heads, but it was
in effigy, our goods were confiscate, in brief, we were there used with all
rigor, so that having no hope on that side, we settled it all on our own
valor, and committed our fortune to the hazard of arms. Incmar and I had done
therein upon occasions all that soldiers can do which venture all; and brave
Roland has in all places shown, that love which gave her courage, ^aised her
strength beyond the vigor not only of her sex, but of men. After many
encounters we shut our selves up in Bliemberg, resolving to show in this siege
the proofs of a courageous valor in extreme events, where there has happened
what you have seen; military command having separated me from them, they have
been killed on the breach; and as it may be thought, Incmar being first dead,
Yoland being not willing to survive him, has been killed on his body, and
expiring embracing him. As for me I would have died in the forefront of the
combat, if the brave but too pitiful Captain, who would not suffer me to be
made an end of, had not caused me to be brought where I am, the loss of my
blood having laid me among the dead. Now that I have satisfied both your
curiosity and my desire, I will no longer live bereaved of the light of mine
eyes, those twinne stars, my Friend and my Mistress. Aleran thus ended his
discourse, and had like the same time to have ended his life, so extremely did
grief oppress his heart, but the Marquess pitying his great courage, gave
order unto his doctor and his Chyrurgeon to labor in this cure with all the
industry which their science could dict^te unto them, yet was art and cure
overcome, for whether through the extremity of his sorrow, or of his wounds,
poor Aleran died within two days after, and was by command of the Marquess
interred with honor by Incmar and his wife, under a Tomb bearing this
inscription, the three Lovers inseparable in life and death. Many remarkable
morrals may be drawn from this history; first, how ill Fathers do in
destinating their daughters unto young men which they abhor, next whereunto
despair carries amorous and unhappy souls, then, whereupon love raises the
courage of the weakest sex, its fire being no less admirable in its effects
then that of thunder. In Aleran is seen the image of a faithful friend, and
of a lover imparalelled who makes known the victory of friendship over love:
this tragical end discovers an admirable valor, and the generositie of the
Marquess honoring of the memory of these whom he had vanquished, serves for a
ground which graceth or sets out the gloss of all the other colors of this
picture.

THE HAPPY Almes-deed.
The Seventeenth Relation.
STudying the law in the University of Orleans, I learned of a Tourengean
scholar this following history, which he had from the mouth of the self same
person unto whom this event had happened. A young man of Poictou called Cyran
the son of a Merchant was by his Father sent to Tours, about some
negotiation, which concerned his commerce, this young man by nature pitiful,
and from his youth prone to give Alms without distinction of persons, it is
true that the honor of the King of glory, which is advanced by good works
ought to be tried by judgment, for discretion is the golden rule of human
actions, and it is not enough to do good, but it must be done fitly, Alms
being one of the most illustrious acts which can be done by those unto whom
God has given means, it must be done also with a judicious distribution.
Otherwise it were rather a dissipation the^ a distribution, and unto such might
and do many give alms, who do as it were put a sword into a mad man's hand, and
give him means to commit excess: it is true that virtues are in a middle,
equally distant from vicious extreamities, and as to give blindly is rather a
profuse wasting, then a liberality, so to take heed unto so many circumstances
when one gives an Alms is rather niggardlines then judgment, we must not
search so narrowly into the quality of those persons unto whom we bestow our
charity, so we must not wholly shut our eyes thereon, and among these
uncertainties, we must raise up the intention and not look what the right
hand does give, nor unto whom we give, but unto God alone, for whom we give,
and who has said whatsoever you shall do unto the least of the poor, I will
keep a just account thereof, even unto a glass of cold water. There be hearts
so hard and so close fisted, that they find some fault with most part of the
poor miserable persons which ask Alms of them, this one is strong and able
to get his living, that other is a shifting fellow, the other is not so old,
the other is vicious, the other is a rascal, all in their opinion are unworthy
of an Alms, and it is only to save their purses that mettle, whereof they make
their Idol without purchasing the blame of avarice, there are others whole
hands are bored, and more for honor then through pity, or more for pity then
with judgment give indifferently unto all comers, without considering that it
is the way to maintain the idleness of many beggars who have more needs of a
spiritual alms, by a good reprehension, then of a temporal, which they abuse
in dissolute courses and strange deboisnes, but who can have this spirit of so
just decerning, since there is nothing in he world so deceitful as
appearances? as for example, about the streets in Cities, and up and down the
Countries there goes so many vagabonds, who under the name of poor soldiers
returning from wars into their own Country, ask something to carry them
home, and sometimes they are thieves who in begging seek but occasion to commit
theft, murders, and rogueries, those people have God in their mouths, and the
devil in their hearts, and yet out of the midst of this kind of bandiliers
may sometimes issue a good thief who may deserve an alms as you shall hear.

Cyran going through the streets in the City of Tours, which appears a flower
in the midst of the garden of France, met with a poor soldier, who being but
in bad array, had notwithstanding a good aspect, and begged an alms of him
with such a grace that he felt himself moved to give, but extraordinarily
moved, he put his hand into his pocket, and thinking to draw out a Sol, which
is little more then an English penny, and gave it him with a good will, and with
words of honor and consolation, wished him a happy return into his own
Country, and a better trade then war, where most commonly is nothing to be
gotten but blows and lice, the soldier in a modest and civil manner answered
him, Sir God make me able to do you some good service, and confirm me in the
desire I have so to do, you bestow a liberality on me in my pressing
necessity, which shall never die in my memory; you do little less then if you
gave me life, after these words of complement they parted, and a while after
Cyran having ended his affairs at Tours took leave of his friend, and
returned toward his own Country, as he was crossing a Wood there steps
forth of a Coppice three thieves, whereof one lays hold on the bridle of his
Horse, and the other holding his sword at his throat commands him to alight and
follow them into the thicket of the Forest, when they were far enough in,
they search him and take from him all the money that he had, which was about a
hundred French crowns with his cloak and best things, after this they begin
to deliberate whether they should kill him or no? let us kill him said one, I
know by his tongue that he is of this Country, and may discover us or cause us
to be pursued, you say right said another, if such had killd him whom they
robbed, they should not now hang on gibbets making mouths at passengers, the
third which was he unto whom Cyran some days before had given the alms of
sixpence in Tours, said fellows what good will his life do us, his blood will
cry vengeance against us louder then his voice, thou playest the preacher said
one of the other two, those that use our trade shut their eyes unto such
considerations which are good only for old wives and children. The dead bite
not nor speak not, the voice of blood has no sound, he will be quite rot^en
before he be found in this place.

My friends, replied the good thief, I beg his life of you, and will rather
give you my part of what has bin taken from him: he is a gallant man, pray let
us not kill him, I will teach you a good way both to save his life, and to
provide for our safety: Let us bind him to some tree and leave him to the
protection of God, lest we should be spotted with his blood.

This counsel was followed, Cyran was bound to a tree with the bridle of his
horse and his garters, and the thieves took his horse and his things and left
him there. The good thief as he was binding of him said in his ear, Friend
take courage, this night will I come and unbinde thee, I have not forgotten thy
alms deed. Cyran remained in this case all the rest of the day, hoping still
in the mercy of God, and in the promise of the good Thief. But toward night
he entered into terrors of death, when as it began to be dark, and he heard
the Wolves howling in the Forest, whereof he saw two pass close by him, and
were a good while looking on his countenance. For besides the cruelty of this
beast, he is likewise so extreme crafty and distrustful, that even when a
train is laid for him, yet is he hard to be taken, and is afraid of all
things: he shunnes snares, he looks, he hearkens, he considers, he watches.
Already they began to approach nearer, for to smell him, and that they might
set on him in a troup and eat him up, they called their fellows together by
howling, wherewithal the forest did ring, and the echoes multiplying their
voices, made Cyrans ears believe that there was a legion of Wolves coming to
devour him. Surely if the good thieves help had stayed a little longer, it is
likely that it had come too late, and out of season, and had found poor Cyran
torn to pieces by Wolves. But God who helps in tribulation, and whose
assistance comes in fit time, made him arrive at the very instant, which was
needful to deliver Cyran not only from the fear of death, but from the death
of fear, for terror had almost borne away his soul. I leave to your
consideration, with what words he thanked the good thief, who had twice in one
day saved his life, first in drawing him forth out of the jaws of Lions, which
were the other two thieves, and then of Wolves, which are Thieves that live but
by rapine; he proffered the Soldier to use him as his brother, and to give him
such part of his means as he should therewith be content, if he would go
with him, and leave this wicked course of life, which could not lead him but
to a shameful end. To give over this theeving life, said the soldier, that is
a thing that I am resolved to do, having long since conceived such a horror
thereof, that it seems to me a hell. My intent is to be a religious man, to
repent for so many evils which I have done in this unlucky trade: it is true
that I did never kill, but I have been present at many murders; I began to
rob, pressed by necessity, but I have continued by a certain malignant
delight that therein is to be taken, seeing it serves to maintain wickedness,
finding not safety enough in France, where I should ever think justice to be
at my heels, I do entreat you to pray to God for me, that he may continue in
me his good inspiration, and may give me grace to put this good design in
execution; there is the part which I have had of the hundred crowns that were
taken from you, I restore it you with a good will, and in so saying he would
have put a hundred Franks into his hands. Yet Cyran would never take them back
again, but gave them him in alms to help him in his pilgrimage, offering to
give him yet more, if he would go with him to the next City. The penitent
soldier (for I should make a conscience to call him thief after such a
change) thanked him, and having mutually embraced each other, and mixed their
tears together, Cyran took his journey one way, and the soldier the other;
whom he never saw since, but the other two he did, for about some three
months after being discovered by the Cloak and horse of Cyran, and accused of
some other thefts, they fell into the hands of the Provost Marshal, who did
them good and speedy justice, and so they were fastened unto an unlucky tree
called a gybbet, from whence they came down by hangham.

The good fortune of Almesdeeds shines in this relation with such splendor,
that although there were were no other motive to use liberality toward
miserable persons, this were argument sufficient to draw it forth of the hands
even of Avarice it self.
