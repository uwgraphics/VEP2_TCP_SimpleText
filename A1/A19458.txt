We are here to consider that no man is without sin: If we say we have no
sin, we deceive out 1 Ioh. 1. 8. Esaias 9. 17. Pro. 20. 9. Esaias. 41 29. 1 John

selves, and there is no truth in us.

Christ did not seek his absolute obedience to the whole Law, nor his total
immunity or freeness from all sin; for it is impossible for a man to be 1 Timothy 4. 10 Acts 5. 31. Matthew. 1. 21.
clean without sin in this life. And therefore our Savior in bidding this
man sin no more: Non exegit ab omni peccato vt sit immunis: Requires not
that he should be free from 1 Ioh. 1. 8.
all sin: Sed comparatione vitae prioris; but in comparison of his former
life: For our Savior 1 Timothy 4. 10 Mat. 1. 2. Acts 5. 31. Exodus 22. 31. 1 Pet 1.
15. 2 Pet. 3. 11. John. 5. 14. Eccl. 21. 1
Christ knew, that he was not only impius and improbus, void of all holiness
and honesty for a time; but that he was insignis nebulo, a notorious, gross
and grievous sinner. Therefore in bidding him sin no more: Is, that as he
has formerly obeyed sin, now he must withstand Iam. 4. 7.
it, and walk no more so inordinately in Eccl. 21. 1. 1 King 2. 4. 1 Kin. 3.

perdition: For Ex sani^ate animae fit sanitas corporis: The souls soundness
is the bodies safety; and if his soul had not sinned, (no doubt) his body had
not smarted; but had been always preserved for the joys of Heaven; Esaias 66.
1^ Mat. 3 12. Nahum. 1. 2* Acts 5. 31. Mat. 1. 21. 1 Timothy 4. 10.
Wherefore we may gather, that the only cause of our Saviors conference with
this man in the temple, was to show him, that the first and efficient cause of
his sickness, was nothing but his sin. Leu. 26. 16. 18. 1 Samuel 24. 10. 2 Chro

And therefore he admonishes him to sin no more, lest a worse thing come
unto him.

Christ would have him to sin no more, Job. 5 14. Eccl. 21. 1.
neither in Cogitatione, proposito, action, nec obduratione; Neither in
thought, purpose, performance, nor countenance. He would not have him to Wisd.

Pet. 4. 5.
sin in thought, lest it should cause him to stumble; nor in purpose, lest it
make him fall; nor in performance, lest it cause him to lie prostrate: neither
in continuance, lest it make him become obdurate, and past all sense and
feeling of sin. But above all things Ioh. 5 14. Eccl. 21. 1.
to abhor sin.

Sin no more.
Our Savior 1 Timothy 4. Acts 5 31. M^t^h 1. ^1.
Christ would have this man sin no more, which forewarning was a sign that
he loved him, and was loath Exo. 20 6. John 10. 20. Gal^ 2. 20. 1 Ioh 49.
Ephesians. 1. Ierem. 2. Rom 5
to lose him: But this love was not of him to Christ, but of Christ to 1 Ioh 4.
10. Ier. 31 3.
him; whereby we may note, that Christ leueth not only proximum, his nearest,
nor amicum, his dearest; for cum inimici essemus, when we were his enemies,
foes, and adversaries, ^. ^h. 2.
he so loved us that he dyed for us. To 5 6. 7. John ^. 16. Romans 4. 25. Heb. 9.
15. 28. 1 Pet. 3. 18. 1 John 4. 9. Ier. 31. 3.


If you say, this man was Christ's friend, because he cured him: I may answer,
he cured him indeed, Amicum nondum amantem, his friend, not yet loving him: Sed
amicum vt jam amatum, but as his friend now beloved 1 Ioh. 4. 10. Ier. 31. 3.
Romans 9. 5.
of him. Wherefore it may truly be said that he was, Non amicus quasi amans,
not his friend as Ioh. 15 18. Acts 20. 30. 1 John 4. 10.
loving; Sed amicus vt amans, but his friend as beloved.

But yet let us mark; Although God love man never so 1 Samuel 13. 14 2 Samuel 11.
4. 2 Samuel 24. 15
dearly, yet if he continue in his sin, he will severely punish Nahu. 1. 2.
3. Mar. 9 44. Esa. 6^. 15, 16. 24.
him: It is wonderful and fearful to remember, how God has dealt with those
that have been nearest and dearest unto him, and of 2 Samuel 13. 14. 2. Sam. 21.
8. Matthew. 25. 30. ^1. 46. Dan. 7. 11. Mat. 3 12. Mar. 5. 20. Luke 19 1^. Heb.

him best beloved. How for sin only, and that but once committed (as it is
thought) he has changed his countenance toward them, turned over another
leaf, and has most severely punished them.

The Angels whom he seated in heaven, and adorned with singular graces and
perfections above all other creatures: for one only sin of pride against the
Majesty of their Maker, were hurled into hell, and are holden with chains of
darkness for euer-lasting damnation. Jude 6. 2 Per. 2. 4. Reu. 20. 10.


After this, God made him a new friend of flesh and blood; he created Adam, and
placed him in Paradise Gene. 2. 15. Psalm 8. 6. Heb. 2. 8.
whom he loved exceedingly, and lived friendly and familiarly withal; he made
him Vicegerent and sole supreme Sovereign over the whole world: And as the
Psalmist speaks put all things in subjection under his feet; yet for all
this, when once he brake his commandment and Genesis 3. 6. Genesis 4. 24. Genesis 4.
10.
did eat the forbidden fruit, all friendship was broken betwixt them, and God
mightily offended, insomuch, that he banished him out of Paradise, and
condemned him and all his posterity (had he not repented) to eternal misery,
and everlasting damnation.

How severely this sentence is executed, may easily appear by this, that many
millions of people, yea all the sons of Adam are adjudged to hell fire Romans
5. 1^.
for ever, save only those whom Christ Jesus has ransomed with his precious
blood, and bitter passion on the ^. (...). 26. John 6. 35. John 3. 16. ^ Cor.

cross.

Lastly, because I will not trouble you with a cloud of witnesses to this
purpose, which fills the book, and are too long to repeat: King David, a
chosen vessel, and a faithful servant of God (as the Texttermeth him) a man
after Gods own 1 Samuel 13. 14.
heart; yet for his adultery, 2 Samuel 11. 4.
and numbering the people, God unsheathed the sword of his vengeance, and made
it drunken with the blood of seventy thousand for 2 Samuel 24. 15.
his sake.

Hereupon let us consider with our selves, search the John 3. 19. Romans 15. 4.
Nehe. 8 7. Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. Acts 17 12. Ps. 19. 2. 4. 9. Pro. 30. 5. Psalm.
112. 1, 2. Deu. 11. 21, 22. Iosuah 1. Psalm. 19. 7, 8, 9, 10.
Scriptures; and let each of us descend into his own soul and conscience, and
see whether there be any reason or cause in the world why God should spare us,
or change the course of his justice toward us, when he has dealt thus
severely with great personages, and holy Prophets for some few sins, and
those only of infirmity. And let us resolus with our selves, that unless we
repent us of our sins, God will mete the like measure unto us, and our reward
and punishment shall be the same, which has be fallen unto Nahu. 1. 1, 2, 3.
Reu. 17. 18. 1 Samuel 3. 12, 13. Hose 4 1.
others. Here we may learn what it is, that is the cause of Gods anger, and
haleth down a punishment upon men: the Text sets it down in a gross sum,
and in Ioh. 8. 14. Matthew. 9. 2. Matthew 8. 16 Deuteronomy. 26. 16. 18. Number. 12. 10, 11.

be wise Luke 12.* 19.

themselves from God, and run headlong to hell, and eternal Esaias 59. 2. Ier.

prepared ready for their Reu. 12. 4.
prey. Thus sin being not forsaken, causes a worse thing to come unto all them
whom it rules and Romans 6. 12.

ceciderunt in culpam; which now unwillingly are punished in hell Es. 30. 33.

their sin, without Luke 13. 3. Nahu. 1 ^.
repentance.

Hear, oh therefore, hear all you that walk after the lusts of your own
hearts, and depart from Bethel Genesis 28. 19*

rock, and your hearts more hard than the Adamant; that you cannot relent with
any tender affection unto your God, for all your foul Exodus 17. 6. Number 20. 8.
offenses, which you have daily and hourly committed against him.

Oh! if you did feel the smart of sin but prick in your wounded conscience,
it were John 20. 1. Ezech. 12. 3.
forcible enough to draw streams of tears out of the dryest eye that ever was
in the head of man; and to excite a multitude of sorrowful groans out of the
hardest heart that ever God made: Yea, it would make you (like David) to pray 2 Samuel 24. 17. 20.
and cry unto God again and Psalm. 51. 2. 11, 12.

favor, that you may get some comfortable persuasion of Gods love in Christ,
for the pardon of your sins. Until you do so, you shall never have peace nor
quietness of conscience, nor any sound comfort of Gods holy 2 Cor. 13. 5. 1
Cor. ^. 16. 1 Cor. 12. 3. Gal. 5. 12.
Spirit in you.

Therefore, with speed learn here of our Savior to sin no more Ioh. 5. 14.
Psalm 41. 4. Eccle. 21. 1.
, for it is far better for us, that Anima carnem ad Coelum vehat, quam vt
animam caro ad infernum trahat: The soul should carry the body to Heaven, then
the body should pull down the soul to hell, Es. 30. 39.
by the heavy weight and burden of sin.

For sin is of such an intolerable weight, that it pressed Christ himself,
as a cartis pressed that is full Amos ^. 13.
of sheaues: and it makes the earth to reele to and fro like a drunken man.
Wherefore, let us fly from sin as from a serpent, says the son of Esaias 24.
20. Eccl. 12. 15.
Syrach, and learn here of our Savior Act 5. 21.
to sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto us.

Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.
THe effect of sin is punishment, Deuteronomy. 32. 42, 43. Mat. 23. 33.
Raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo, Pumishment limping
after with his lame foot, has seldom forsaken the sinner going before him.
Thus sin goes before, Gene. 13. 6.
and punishment follows after. Genesis 13. 19 ^4.
They are inseparable companions, like water and moisture, fire and heat, the
Sun and his light: yea, cause and effect, mother and daughter, which sin, no
man can pardon but God, Mat. 1. 31. Hosea 13. 4. John 1. 15.
and take this for a general rule whatsoever thou be, that Peccatum puniendum
est, aut a te, aut a Deo: si punitur a te, Augustine.
tunc punitur sine te: si vero a te non Luke 24. 47. Esaias 45. 15.
punitur, tecum punietur. Sin must needs be punished, either of God, or of
thy self: If by thy self, then it is Psalm. 4. 8. Dan. 9. ^.
punished without the: If of God, then thou and thy sin must be punished
together, m 1 Pet. 4. 13
for God punishes either sin, or Luk 13. 3. Esaias 59 1. ^
the sinner, in one, or in both, and that without respect of persons, except
they repent, Ioh. 5. 14. Eccl. 21. 1. ^
and sin no more; p whenever, wheresoever, and in whomsoever he finds it.
Quia abyss^s abystum inuocat, one deep calls another: So, the greatness of
the sin Luke 15. 2^
causes the seuerenesse of the Matthew. 22 13.
punishment. Thus you may see that sin, Non solum ponit nos contrarios Deo, sed
facit nos nobis ipsis graves, does not only set us at varience with God, Esaias
1. ^^. Pro. 1. 28. Exodus 32. 10.
but it makes us grievous unto our selves.

Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.
IT is said in the holy Scripture, in diverse and sundry places, that Odio s

too: He hates all those that work iniquity; both the wicked man, and al his
wickedness, are in hatred with him; Yea, the whole life of sinners, as much as
their very thoughts, Mat. 12. 37. Wisd. 1. 9. 1 Cor. 5. 10. Romans 10. 12. Eccl.

on the other side, to execute e 1 Pet. 5. 8. John 5. 14. Esa. 30. 33.
the vengeance of this worse thing that shall come unto them, (which is) Gods
eternal wrath and damnation; their conscience gnawing within them: without them
al damned souls that continued in their sins, bewailing; and beneath them,
Gehenna, that infernal pit of hell open, and the cruel furnace ready to devour
them: without, and on every side of them, all the world burning on fire. O then
what shall they do? to go backward is impossible, and to appear,
intolerable: Oh, therefore, let us not defer our time, but learn of our
Savior Acts 5. 31. Mat. 1. 21. ^ Tim. 4. 10.
to sin no Ioh. 5. 14. Wisd. 2^. 1. Eze. 18. 21. Ie^e. 4. 1.
more, lest a worse thing do come unto us.

Lastly, it was the continuing in sin, that caused the reiection of Came Genesis
40. 11
, the drowning of the whole World Genesis 7. 10.
, the burning of Sodom Genesis 19. 14
, the consuinption of Herod Acts 22. 23.
, the fall of Ananias, Acts 5 5.
and the damnation of the rich glutton Luke 16. 25. Esaias 30. 33. John 5. 14.
, with many thousands more which now lie damned in hell: and can none of all
these fore-warnings serve us to sin no more, that this worse thing do not
come unto us?

If they cannot, yet at the last, either let the miraculous deliverance of
Jonah from Jonah 2. 16.
drowning, Ichosaphat from the 2 Ch^o. 20. 24.
Amorites, Joseph in Genesis 41. 14.
prison, Daniel in the Lions den Dan. 6. 22.
, Sufanna from her wrongful judgment ^ Sam. 6. 2.
, Peter from sinking in the sea Mat. 14. 31
, the three Israelites from the fiery furnace Dan. 3. 26.
, or the most bitter death which our Savior Jesus Christ suffered on the
cross for our sins ^ Cor. 5. 15.
, be a motive to cause us to sin no more, which in so doing, he has both
couenanted and granted Ier. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10. Mal. 3. 7.
, that this worse thing shall never come unto us.

If you would fly the effect, shun the cause: If you would avoid the
punishment, then abandon your sin; and learn of our Savior to sin no more,
lest that a worse thing do come unto you. And as you were clothed before (like
the criple) with the garment of Eccl. 5. 1. Ezec. 7. 19.
Vanity: you must now put on the Robes of Christ's Rouel. 19. 8.
humility; and wash not your selves in Sylo, nor in Jordan; but in the Ma. 23.
12. James 4. 10.
poole Bethesda, of spiritual Syon; Lest a worse thing come unto you.

To conclude, seeing God, is the infinite good Psa. 1. 18. 29 Ier. 33. 11.
that is offended: Sin the infinite evil that is committed W^sd. 14. ^ Prou.
15. 9. Esaias 1. 18.
, and this worse thing that should come unto us, the infinite punishment of
hell prepared for all those that continue in their sins without c repentance:
Let us therefore learn our Saviors Caveat, to forsake our Io. 15. 14. Psalm.
41. 4.
sins, that this worse thing may not come, for our sins are in the falling; but
the grace of God is in the rising: Sin, the cursed work of the Devil: but
mercy, pardon, and forgiveness, the blessed work of 1 Pet. v. 3. Jude 2 ^.
Iere. 9. 24.

yea before they call I will answer, (says the Lord) and while they speak, I
Es. 65. 24.
will hear.

Wherefore, let us not plead unto God, Non est factum, in denying our sins,
which he warns us to Sin no more; but let us like good Soldiers, put on
the whole Armor Ephesians. 6. 11.
of God, and violently resist the Devil, in the power of Jesus Christ, and he
will fly from Iam. 4. 9.
us: So often as we resist him, so often we overcome, we make the Angles Luke
15. 7.
glad; and glorify God which exhorts us to fight, And helps us in the time of
Heb. 14. 16.
need: He beholds our striving, he helps us up, when we faint, and crowns us
with glory and honor, when we 1 Timothy 6. 17.
overcome.

The greater our temptations are, the more noble must be our James 4. 9
resistance; and the more godly our life and conuersations are, the greater
shall be our crown and 2 Timothy 4. 8 Esaias 4^. 3.
glory.

We must also most entirely desire Almighty God, who is the Author of Ier. 31.
18. Leuit. 5. 21.
repentance, to give us his grace to Ecc. 21. 1. Psalm. 41. 4.
repent, that we may record a decree in our hearts, to keep all our sins
with everlasting exile of Banishment 1 Pe. 5. 18.
, and never admit any of them again in our Coasts. And let our hearts be
pricked on with the feeling of Gods Psalm. 1. 2.
mercies, encouraged by his gracious promises of accepting our poor endeavors
to do him 1 Cor. 15. 58.
service; yea ravished with the expectation of such a Col. 2. 13. Esaias. 53. 5.
reward, as is assured unto all those which learn this lesson of our Savior,
To sin no John 5 14.
more.

And withal, let us be ashamed Romans 6. 21.
of our long continuing in sin, that we could repent no sooner, and condemn
the carelessenes of our hearts, for doing our best works so imperfect.

And most entirely crave pardon, grace, and mercy, from the Father of mercies;
and carefully searth our hearts, 1 Gor. 12. 28.
find out our sins, that we may learn here of our Savior, To sin no John
5. 14.
more; but each day renew our repentance.

And then we shall be assured, that tha outward offering of grace, will be
ever accompanied with the inward working of the Spirit. And Gods holy Spirit
will be our conductor, his Word our director, while our faith Ephesians. 6. 16.
holds the anchor; And grace steer Ephesians. 1. 7. Titus 3. 7.

and our own godly lives and conuersations in learning here of our Savior to
sin no more, will witness the same unto us, which the Father of mercies,
even for his Son Jesus Christ his sake, for ever grant us. And as we have
begun to live here in thy fear, proceed and continued in thy favor, grow
daily in thy grace: even so we beseech thee Oh Lord, to let us live within thee
thy Glory. Amen.

Even so sweet Jesus say AMEN.
Sin no more.
Christ's mercy is to such as do repent,
But not to sinners that remain in sin;
Who were a sinner, if he have intent,
To change his life, he may his mercies win;
For in this world he has his mercy plast,
Whilst it endures, so will it ever last.
If sinners conscience tremble for to think,
Of their accounts upon their dreadful day;
If that their terrors make their hearts to shrink,
Then let their mind drive sinful thought away.
And dare not do their wicked actions here,
In which they durst not, at that day appear.
Gods justice does, as ever heretofore,
Call on that sinners may receive their due;
But Christ's endeavor, now as evermore,
For man's repentance, and salvation sue.
At Jesus suit, God ever grants grace,
And for repentance gives sinners space.
FINIS.
