Cum Priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.

Lucae Marenzio Musicae artis peritissimo Tho. Watsonus.
HEi, quoties morimur nimia dulcedine rapti,
Pulsat Apollineam dum tua Musa chelyn?
O, igitur dulcis plectrum depone Marenzi,
Ne sit laesa tuis plurima vita sonis.
Attamen o dulcis plectro modulare Marenzi:
Si morimur, vitam dant tua plectra nouam.
O liceat nobis, vita sub morte reperta,
Saepe tuo cantu viuere, saepe mori.
Mill neces patior, vitas totidemque resumo,
Dum tua multiplici gutture musa placet:
Somnio septeno gyrantes murmr sphaeras:
Somnio cantantis Numina blanda sali:
Somnio Threiceum Cytharoedam saxa mouentem:
Somnio mulcentem carmine monstra Deum:
Somnio Musarum concentus protinus omnes:
Omnia Marenzi, dum canis, vnus habes.
Clarissimo, and honoratissimo Heroi, Domino Roberto Deurox, Comiti Essexiae,
Georgiani Ordinis Equiti aurato, multisque alijs nominibus illustrissimo S. P.
INclyte Mauortis, Musarum dulcis alumne,
Accipe iuncta Italis Anglica verba notis:
Atque Marenzaeos cantus, quos approbet auris
Attica, quos Charites, quosque DIANA velit.
Sirudius quid inest, id nostri culpa laboris:
Et melior primo forte secundus erit.
Attamen Hesperiae Philomelae subdere voces
Non est exigui debile Martis opus.
Tu dignare, precor, sincerae munera mentis,
Sieve sonent placido murmr, sieve graui.
Candida and atra suo percurrit lumine Phoebus:
Candida and atra volens accipe, Phoebus eris.
Phoebus eris, nisite sacrato culmine Mauors
Auferat, armipotens vt fera bella geras.
Ecquis enim vestrae nescit conamina Musae,
Metraque ad Aoniam saepe canenda lyram?
Sed mitto quoscunque tuae virtutis honores:
Mayor es eulogijs, carminibusque meis.
Aurea concedat foelicis tempora vitae
Jupiter, and coeptis nolit abessetuis.
Honoris tui studiosissimus Thomas Watsonus.
