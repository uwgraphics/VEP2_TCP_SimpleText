To the christen Reader.
Paul (good Christen reader the first to Timothe the second chapter /
speaking of our great graundmother Eve / who after that she was deceived and
subdued unto the transgressyon / brought forth death upon all her posterite)
declares / that to heal so great a wound / and to appear beautifully in the
eyes of the mighty Lord whose dear son Jesus Christ said. 2. Timo. 2.
John. 27.
Father those that thou have given unto me I will that where I am they be also
with me / that they may see my glory. After the first rudiment of a Chrstian
(the which is faith) iij waytyng virgins / ought to be attendaunt ande
serviceable unto him / that in this vale of misery inte^deth to lead a
parfect life / Love holiness and discretion. Under the which discretion (as it
may be gathered by the properte of the Greek term i^ that place) are
comprised chastity / temperaunce / modeste and dece^t shame fastnes / because
all these virtues are always coherent ande Joined to gether. sophroline
And holiness / like as she requires to fly from all vice / so does she
require the exercise of all virtuous works and doings that proceed
effectually from faith / through love. That the name of him may be sanctified
who said unto his father. I have declared unto the^ / thy name. And will
declare it / that the love wherewith thou have loved me / may be in them and I
in them. Joan. 15.
Wherefore that by love / the duty of all men from the lowest to the highest
may be known from the one to the other / read over this little book / that
(walkinge in the dangerous patthes of this exile) thou may know how to be
trained unto the mansyon place / prepared unto the rightuous that never shall
have end.

How the spiritual Prelates ought to use the^ selves toward the Comune
People.


Behold / I send you forth as sheep among wolves. Math. 10. b


Go ye your way ande teach all nations and baptyse them in the name of the
father / and of the son / and of the holighoost. Math. 27. c
And teach them to keep all things / what soever I have commanded you.

John. 15. b. Col. 1. a.
Yea have not chosen me / but I have chosen you / and ordained you / that ye go
/ and bring forth fruit.

John 25. c. Act. 1 ^. and 2. ^.
And ye shall bear me witness / not only at Jerusalem / but also through out
the land of Jury / and Samaria / and to the vttermust coasts of the earth.

Joan. 20. c.
Receive the holyghoost. Whose sins soever ye remit / they are remitted unto
them ande whose sins soever ye retain / they are retained.

also in heaven / and what soever ye lowse upon earth / shall be lowsed also in
heaven.

Act. 20. d.
Take heed unto your selves / and to all the flock / among the which the
holyghoost has set you to be Bysshoppes / to feed the congregation of God /
which he has purchased with his own blood.

Ephesians. 4. a.
Jesus christ which came down from heaven / ande is gone up again above all
heavens to fulfill all / has set some to be Apostles / some to be Prophets /
some to 1. Cor. 12. c.
be Evangelists / some to be shepheardes and teachers / whereby the saints
might be coupled together / through come^ service to the edefying of the body
of Christ. A Bisshoppe must be blameless. 1. Tim. 3. a. Leuit. 21. b. Ezec.
44. d. Tet. 3. b.
The husband of one wife sober / discrete / manerlie / harberous / apt to
teach / not given to much wine / no fyghter / not given to fylthy lucre / but
gentle abhorring strife / abhorring conuetuousnes / and one that rules his
own house honestly / having obedient children with all honesty. For if he
can not rule his own house / how shall he care for the congregation of God?

The servant of the lord ought not to strive / but to be gentle unto every
man / apt to teach / one that can forbear the evil / one that can with
mekenes inform them that resyst / if God at any time will give them
repentance for to know the truth / and to turn again from the snare of the
deuell / which are holden in prison of him / at his will. 2. Tim. 2. c. Gal. 6.
a


Preach the word / be fervent be yt in 2. Tim. 4. a
season or out of season / Improve / rebuke / exhort with all long
sufferynge and doctrine. For the time will come / when they shall not suffere
wholesome doctrine / but after their own lusts shall they (whose ears ytche)
get the^ an heap of teachers / and shall turn their ears from the truth /
and shall be given unto fables. But watch thou in all things / suffer aduersytie

The Elders which are among you I exhort / which am also an Elder / ande a
witness of the affliction in Christ / ande partaker of the glory that shall be
opened. Feed Christ's flock which is among you / ande take the ouersyght of
them / not as though ye were compelled thereto / but willingly / not for the
desire of fylthy sucre / but of a good mind / not as though ye were lords
over the parysshens / but that ye Tit. 2. a.
be an ensample to the flock.

Who soever will be great among you / let him be your minister / and who soever
will be chief let hi be your servant. Mat. 20. a.
Even like as the son of man came / not to be served but to do service / and
to give his life to a redemption for many. Mat. 10. a.


Go and preach the Gospel / saying. The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal
the sick / cleanse the lepers raise the dead / cast out the deuelles. Frelie
ye have received / freely give again.

Who is now a faithful servant / whom his Lord has made ruler over his
household / that he may give them meat in due season? Mat. 24. a. Mat. 25. b.
Blessed is that servant / whom his lord (wha^ he comes) shall find so
doing / verelye I say unto you / he shall sect him over all his goods. Apoc.
16. c.
But and if the evil servant shall say in his heart Tush it will be long or
my lord come / and begin to smite his fellows / yea / and to eat and drink
with the dronke^ / the same servants lord shall come in a day / when he
looks not for him / and in an hour that he is not ware of / and shall heawe
him in pieces / and give him his reward with ypocrites / where shall be waiting

heart / In all causes that come unto you from your brethren (which dwell in

between statutes and ordenaunces ye shall inform the^ that they sin not
against the lord / and so the wrath to come upon you and your brethren.

Luke 10.

2. Tim. 5. c.
The Elders that rule well / are worthy of double honor / most specially they
which labor in the word and in teachinge. Deuteronomy. 25. a. 2. Cor. 9. b. Mat. 10.
a.
For the scripture says. Thou shall not mosell the mouth of the ox that
treads out the corn. And the labourer is worthy of his reward.

1. These. 5. b Gal. 5. a. 2. Tim. 5. b
We beseke you brethren / that ye know them which labor among you / and
have the ouersyght of you in the lord / ande give you exhortacion / that ye
have them the more in love / for their words sake / and be at peace with them.

Hebr. 13. a.
Remember them which have the ouersyght of you / which have declared unto you
the word of God. The end of whose conversation / see that ye look upon / and
follow their faith. Obey them / and submit your selves unto the^ / for they
watch for your souls / even as they that must give accountes therefore.

Who goes a warrefare at any time / upon his own wages? 2. Cor. 9.
Who planteth a vinyarde / and eats not of the fruit thereof? Who fedeth a
flock / and eats not of the milk of the flock? Romans 15. d. Gal. ^. a.
If we have sowe^ unto you spiritual things / is it a great thing if we reap
your bodelie things? But if other be partakers of this power on you / wherefore
are not we rather? Know ye not that they which labor in the temple / have
their living of the temple? And they that wait at the altar / enioie the
altar? Even thus also has the lord ordained / that they which preach the
Gospel / should live of the Gospel. Mat. 10. a.


Ezechias commanded the people that dwelt at Jerusalem / that they should give
porcions of their goods unto the priests / that they might the more
stedfastlye endure in the law of the lord. 2. P^^. 3^. ^.

Judges and Rulers ought to live with their subjects.


Hear (Oye Kings) and understand. Sapi. vj. ^
O learn ye that be Judges of the ends of the earth / give care / ye that
rule the multitudes / and delight in much people. Romans xiij. ^
For the power is given you of the lord / and the strength from the highest /
which shall try your works / ande search out your Imaginacions / how that
ye / being officers of his kingdom / have not executed true judgment / have
not kept the law of ryghtuousnes / nor walked after the will of God.

A King shall not have many horses / neither shall he have many wives /
neither shall he gather him silver ande Gold to much. Deuteronomy. xvij.
He shall not lift up his heart above his brethren / and shall not turn a
side from the commandments of God / neither to the right hand nor to the
lift hand.

Mercy and faithfulness preserve the King / ande with louinge kindenes his
seat is holden up. Pro. xx. ^


The seat of the king that faithfullye judges the poor / shall continue
sure for evermore. Pro. xxix. ^


Like as a roaringe lion and an hungry bear / even so is an ungodly prince
over the poor people. Where the prince is without understanding / there is
great oppressyon and wrong. But if he be soche one as hates couuetuousnes /
he shall long reign.

M^c^e. 2. a. Deuteronomy. 17. d. Ierem. 5. a. Psalm. 132. a.
Hear o ye heads of the house of Jacob / and ye leaders of the house of
Israel. Should not ye know what were laufull and right? But ye hate the good

Be wise now therefore (O ye Kings) be warned ye that are judges of the earth.

son least the lord be angry / and so ye perish from the right way.

Sapie^t 1. a 3. Reg. 3. a.
O set your affection upon wisdom / ye that be Judges of the earth.

Make no labor to be made a Judge / except it so were that thou could
mightelie put down wickedness. Eccle. v^^. a Job. ix. a ^^d c Luke xix b


Take heed ye Judges what ye do / for ye execute not the judgment of man /
but of the lord. ij. Par. xix.
And he is with you in judgment. Therefore let the fear of the lord be with
you / and beware / and do it for with the lord our God there is no
unrighteous nor respect of parsones / nor accepting of gifts.

In judgment be merciful unto the fatherles as a father / ande be in stead
of an husband unto their mother. Eccle. iiij. b


With true Judgment the King sets up the land / but if he be a man that
takes gifts / he turns it vpsid down. Pro. xxix. a


Be no accepter of parsones / neither be desirous of gifts for they make wise
me^ blind / ande change the words of the rightuous. Deuteronomy. xvij.


He that has respect of pariones in judgment does not well / and why? Pro.
xxviij.
He will do wrong / yea even for a piece of bread.

A wise judge will order his people with discretion / and where a man of
understanding bears rule / there goes it well. As the judge of the people is
him self / even so are his officers / and look what manner of man the ruler of
the city is / soche are they that dwell therein. Pro. xxix. b


Pro. xvij. d Apoc. xxiij a
The ungodly takes gifts out of the bosom to wraste the ways of judgment.

Exodus xxiij.
Thou shall not wrast the right of thy poor in his cause. Keep thy far from
false matters. Susan. viij Deuteronomy. xvij.
The innocent and rightuous shalt thou not slay. Thou shall take no gifts /
for gifts blind even them that are sharp of sight / ande wrast the
ryghtuous causes. Eecl. xx. d

Cursed is he that wrasteth the right of the widdowe. Woe unto them that are
co^ning men to suppe out wine and expert to set up dronkennes. These give
sentence with the ungodly for rewards / but co^dempne the just cause of the
rightuous.

Ezay. x. a Luke xij. f Mat. xxiiij.
Woe be unto you (o ye Judges) that make unrighteous laws / ande deuyse things
which be to hard for to keep / where through the poor are oppressed on every
side / and the innocents of my people / are therewith robbed of judgment /
that widows may be your pray / and that ye may rob the fatherles. Esa.

praise of them that do well. Tito. iij. a


Romans xiij. a
Let every soul submit him self to the auctorite of the higher powers. For
there is no power but of God. Sap vi. a i. Petr. a. b
The powers that be / are ordained of God / so that who soever resysteth the
power / resysteth the ord^naunce of God. And they that resyste shall receive to
them selves dampnation. For rulers are not to be feared for good works but
for evil.

Romans xiij.
And the ruler bears not the swearde for naught. For he is the minister of God
a taker of vengeance / to punish him that does evil / Wherefore ye must needs
obey / not only for punishment but also because of conscience. For this cause
must ye give tribute also. For they are Gods mynisters / which maintain the
same defense. Romans xiij. b Mat. ^vij. ^
Give to every man therefore his duty / tribute / to whom trybute belongs /
custom to whom custom is due / fear / to whom fear belongs / honor /
to whom honor pertains.

Give unto the Emperor / that which is the Emperors. Mat xxij. c Mat. ^vij. d

And give unto God / that which is Gods.

not with him / least thou weep with him also / and least thy teeth be set on
edge at the last.

If thy daughter be wanton / keep her strayghtlye / least she cause thine

without blame. Ephe. v. c Gal. 2. c Tet. 3. a. i. Petr. iij. c
So ought me^ also to love their wives / eue^ as their own bodies. He that

Therefore as the congregatyon is in subjection of Christ / likewise let the
wives be in subjection to their husbands in all things.

Ye women / be subject unto your husbands / that even they which believe not
the word / may without the word be won by your conuersatyon / when they
behold your conversation in fear. i. Petr. iij. a 1. Cor. xj. a Ephesians. v. c

Whose apparel / shall not be outward with broyded hear / and hanginge on of
gold / or in putting on of gorgious array / but let the inward man of the
heart be incorrupt with a meke ande a quiet spyrite which before GOD is much
set by. For after this manner in the old time / did the holy women which
trusted in God / tyer them selves / and were obedient unto their husbands /
even as Sara obeyed Abraham and called him Lord. Gene. xviij.


Let the women array them selves in comely 1. Tim. 2.

gold / or pearls or costly array / but with soche as it becomes women that
profess godliness through good works.

1. Cor. xiiij. ephesians. v. c
Let the woman learn in scilence with all subjection. Suffer not a woman to
teach nor to have authority over the man / but for to be in scilence. For
Adam was first formed / ande then Eve / Adam also was nor deceived / but the
woman was deceived / ande has brought in the transgression. Henes. iij. c
Notwithstanding through bearing of children she shall be saved / if she continue
in faith / and in love / and in the sanctifying with discretion.

Let your wives keep scilence in the congregation / for it shall not be
permitted unto them to speak / but to be under obedience / as the law says.
But if they will learn any thing / let them axe their husbands at home. For
it becomes not women to speak in the congregation.

A man shall be lord and ruler in his house / and the woman shall be subject to her
husband.

i. Cor. vij.
To avoid whoredom / let every man have his own wife / and let every woman

If a damsel make a vow unto the lord / while she is in her fathers house /

A wyddowe must be without blame. But if there be any that provides not for his

But the yo^ger wyddowes refuse. For when they have begone to wax wantonne

If riches increase / set not your heart upon them. Psalm. lxj. b


Eccl. xiiij. a
It becomes not a covetous man and a nigarde / to be rich / ande what should
a niggarde do with gold? he that with all his carefulnes heapeth to gether
vnrightuously / gathers for other folks / and an other man shall make good
chere with his goods. He that is wicked unto him self how should he be good
unto other men? How can seche one have any pleasure of his goods? There is
nothing worse / the^ when one disfauoureth him self and this is a reward of
his wickedness. If he do any good / he does it not knowing thereof / and against

A nigard has a wicked eye / he turns a way his face / and despises his

eccl. xiiij. b eccle. iiii a Tobi. iiii. b Luke 16. b

good to thy self of that thou have / ande give the lord his due offeri^ges. Do

thine hand / and give unto the poor.

A rich man ought to submit him self / and not to rejoice in his goods. Job.

Charge them which are rich in this world / that they be not proud / nor

Your riches are corrupt / your garments are moath eaten. Your gold and your

Moreover when men men are drinkinge / they forget all friendship / all brotherly
faythfulnes and love. But as soon as they are dro^ken / they draw out the
swearde / and will fight. And when they are laid down from the wine / ande so
risen up again / they can not tell what they did.

Wine is a voluptuous thing / ande dronckennes causes sedicion / who so
deliteth therein / shall never be wise. Prou. xx. a Ephe. b. b


Be not thou a wine bebber / for wine has destroyed many a man. Prou. 21. a
Ephesians. v. b


O how well content is a wise man with a little wine? The fire proves the
hard iron / even so does wine prove the hearts of the proud / when they be
dronken.

eccle. xxxjd Prou. xxxj. 1. Timo. 5.
Wine soberly dronken / quickens the life of man. If thou drinkest it
measurably / thou shall be temperate. Wine was made from the beginni^g to make
me^ glad (and not for dronkennes) Wine measurably dronken / is a rejoicing for
the soul and body.

But if it be dronken with exces / it makes bitterness and sorrow unto the
mind. Dronkennes fylleth the mind of the foolish / with shame ande ruin /
dimynissheth the strength / and makes wou^des.

Ephe. v ^
Be not droncken / for therein is excess.

Exhortation unto all sinners generally.
Ezech. xviij Deuteronomy. xiiij. 4. Reg. 14.
The same soul that sineth / shall die. The child shall not bear the fathers
offense / nether shall the father bear the childs offense. But the
righteousness of the rightuous shall be upon hi^ self / and the wickedness of the
wicked shall be upon hi^ self also. ii. Para. 25. Iere iii. 18. a
But if the ungodly will turn away from all his sins that he has done /
and keep all my commandments / and do the thing that is aequall and right /
doutles he shall live ande not dye. And I will think no more upon all his
sins that he did before. ezech. 18. a
For I have no pleasure in the death of a sinner (says the lord God) but
rather that he convert and live.

A general exhortation unto all men.
Thou shall reprehend thy brother when he synneth / least his offense come over
all. Leuit. 19. c


Be ye all of one mind / one suffer with an other / love as brethren / be
pitiful / be courteous. i Petr. iij. b


Recompense not euel for evil / neither rebuke for rebuke / but contrary wise /
bless / and know that ye are called thereto / even that ye should be heirs of
the blessinge. For who so lists to live / and would feign see good days /
let him refrain his so^g from evil / and his lips that they speak no gile.
Genes. xii Math. xv.
Let him eschew evil / ande do good. Let him seek peace and ensue it. For the
eyes of the lord / are over the rightuous / and his ears are open unto their
prayers. But the face of the lord beholds them that do evil.

Finis.
A right goodly rule how all faithful christians shall occupy and exercise
them selves in their daily prayers.

Luke. xxij. Math. vj. Christ teaches us in his Gospel saying.
Pray that ye fall not into temptation.

How a man shall behave him self in the morning when he ryseth.
When thou risest in the morninge / look that thou with all humblenes of mind
/ knele down / ande lifting up thy heart / thy hands ande thine eyes into
heaven / unto God the father almighty / pray on this manner.



The prayer for the morning.
O Almyghtie and most gentle God we thank the for the sweet sleep and
comfortable rest / that thou have given us this night. And for as much as
thou have commanded by thy holy word / that no man should be idle / but all
ways occupied i^ virtuous exercises / every man according to his calling. We
most humbly beseech the / that thine eyes may attend upon us / daily defend
us / in sorrow succor us / cherish comfort ande gouuerne all our councels /
studies and labors. In soche wise that we may so spe^de this day / according
to thy most blessed will / without hurtinge of our neighbor / that we may
diligently and warelye eschew and avoid all things that should displease the
/ set thy always before our eyes / live in thy fear / and ever work that
that may be found acceptable before thy divine Majesty / unto the praise of
thy most holy name / through Jesus Christ our lord. So be it.

An other prayer for the Morning.
Seeing that thou (O heavenly father) act that one ande alone almighty God /
which art in every place / beholdest the councels / devises and works / yea /
the very thoughts of all men / and geuest to every one according to their
deeds. We beseech the that (for as much as thou haste most graciouslye
preserved us this night) we may not spend this day after our own mind and
pleasure (which is always evil and wicked) but earnestly look upon / and
dyligentlye follow thy fatherly will / thine everlasting counsel / thy
healthful word and thy pleasure which is always good / parfect and holy /
and fulfill the same with good heart / that thy divine name may always be
sa^tified / both now and ever of us miserable sinners through thy derely
beloved son Jesus christ our lord and Savior So be it.

Afther that thou have prayed on this manner (sei^g that we be all sinners) it
shall be expedient (if thou have convenient leisure thereunto) to confess thy
self on this manner unto God the father.

The confession of our sins unto God the father.
O Almighty God and heavenly father / maker of heaven and earth / I confess
my self unto the / even from the very heart / that I am a miserable / wretched
and abominable sinner.

Ande have wickedlie transgressed all thy holy commandments / and the divine
precepts of thy Godly will. The sins (alas which I have committed in my
flesh against the) are so great and so excedingly increased / that they are no
less innumerable then the sands of the sea. And they thrust me down even as
an intolerable burden. In these wicked sins (oh lord God) have I hitherto
walked according to the will of the prince of the world / whiles I did that that
was pleasant to the flesh ande evil lusts / thorough vain thoughts / the
blindness of my heart / the outward pretense of Godlynes and fained faith. This
came to pass (Ah wretch that I am) because that I did never aernestly strive
against the suggestio^s of Satan / nor the concupiscences or desires of the
world / nor yet the lusts of my flesh. But fylthilie obeyed them a thousand
times more / than the admonicions of thy holy spirit. O lord my God. It came
to pass also / that I did set naught by thy Godly counsel / despised thy
holy name / and feared thy vengeance and heavy displeasure nothing at all.
But what soever I have in this behalf offended thy most Godly majesty / it
sore repe^teth me / and the fault greueth me eue^ unto the very heart. And if
it were not (o most merciful father) that thou had laid up mercy in the
bowelles / blood and wounds of Jesus Christ thy son ande our lord / for so
many as unfeignedly repent and truly believe be their sins never so great and
many / I should see none other way / but throw my self down headlong
(through desperation) into the bottomless pit of hell. But for as much as thou
haste set thy well-beloved son Jesus Christ / to be our mediator and mercy
stock. And haste promised grace / mercy and forgiveness of sins to as many as
ask it in his name / through faith in his blood. Therefore in this time of
grace and mercy / I miserable sinner come now unto the / ande desire the my
lord God that thou will grant me / through that our lord Jesus Christ / a
right ande true faith. And for his sake / forgive me all my sins / and make
me to walk daily more and more in a new heart / and in the fruits of the holy
ghoost / that I may utterly despise all the ungodly lusts of this world /
and that I may be found continent / pure of living temperate / good rightuous
/ honest / diligent in all goodness / meke / merciful / modest / humble and
ready to forgive soche as offend me / even from the very heart. And so live all
the days of my live according to thy dyuine will and true fear.

That I may die to the world / to all sin and to my self. And with a good
confydence and merry heart / look for the coming of the lord / and my savior
Jesus Christ. To whom with the and the holy ghoost / be all honor ande
glory for ever and ever. So be it.

Thou may (if thou will) after thy confession / say the lords prayer
called the Pater noster. And so (commending thy self unto God) fall to some
honest and virtuous exercise / according unto thy calling. But what so ever
thou do / do it with pureness of heart / and with synglenes of eye. Yea so do
it / as though God were present / and looked upon the / as undoubtedly he does.

The prayer to be said when thou go to bed.


O God the almighty lord / by whose order ande will the night ande darkness do
now approach / wherein we shall give our selves to quiet and sleep. We most
instauntly desire the / that thou graciously receive us into thy tuicion ande
kepinge / that the prince of darkness do not hurt us with his terrous and
fears. And although we must sleep / because of our feebleness / yet let our
heart and mind wacche unto the. Go thou before us / and show us the way as a
pillar of fire / that we may follow the so well in rest / as in busynes ande
occupations of this life. And grant that we be not found in thy sight /
children of night and darkness / but of day and light / through Jesus Christ
our lord. So be it.

An other Prayer.
This our mortal body / which through sin daily decays and diminissheth
/ must at the last altogether perish and become earth / whereof it is come and
made and then shall our vanity / which we through our own ignorance / have
made unto our selves / take an end. But most merciful creator and maker of
all things / vouchsafe so to break / divide and dyssolue me / thy poor
creature who am gathered / knyt and made of the / and grant that I may
always have in mind / thy dissolution / and of whom I am knit together /
having an eye to what place I must go to thinte^t that I / not being prepared /
be no brought without nuptial or brydall garment / before thy judgment seat.
For like as when the day is ones past / we give our selves to rest / eue^ so
must we / this life being ended / rest in the death. Nothing is more like unto
life / then the day / ande nothing more like unto death / then the night. And
nothing so like the grave or sepulcher as the couche bed or bedsteade. Thus /
good keeper and defe^der from all evil / grant us / now lying in impotencie
and feebleness / of our selves / that / through the / we may be preserved this
night from all the assaults of the deuell of hell.

AMEN.
When thou go to thy labor or work.
Prayer.


O Most kind and gentle heavenly father / thou know / and have also taught
us / how great the weakness of man is / so that man (without thy Godly help)
can do nothing. Thus vouchsafe to se^de us thy holy spirit / that he may
strengthen / stir ande move our understanding and reason / in all things
that we this day outwardely shall go about and take in hand / or of that we
inwardly shall think or have in mind / to the intent that it may all be done
to thy glory / and to the proffyt of our neighbor. So be it.

When a man is bound toward any Journey.
Prayer.
This our life / most merciful lord / is nothing else but a pilgrimage and
through fare / for we have here no abiding or dwelling place. We are come from
the / and we must return again unto the. But amongst or between all the
trappes / assaults / pittes and snares which the deuell has laid out and
spread abroad / for us / blinded in sin / vouchsafe thou / o lord Jesus Christ
/ to lead us with thy righthande / for thou art a true / trusty / and sure
friend. Open our eyes / to thinte^t that we miss not the way which thou thy
self art but lead us / through and by thy self unto the father / to the
intent that al we may be made one with the and him / even like as thou art one
with him.

O most merciful lord / like as thou do send thy holy Anngels to be
defenders of as many as serve ande please the with a simple / innocent ande
pure heart / by the which / they be led / like young children are led of
them which are elder and stronger than they. And like as thou did vouchsafe
to send thine A^ngell. Raphaell / to be a guide unto the son of that
reverent man Toby / vouchesafe even so / o lord / to send us the same A^ngell
/ although we are not so worthy / as the same Toby was / that he may encourage
and lead us through that way / which is not pleasant unto us / but unto the.
So be it --

When a man comes home or at his iourneys end.
Thanksgiving and prayer.
I Thank the / o heavenly father / for thy great grace and mercy / which thou
haste showed unto me / in going forth and in returning or coming again
through thy holy blessyng / which thou geuest unto all them that keep thy holy
word and do thereafter. Grant us / o gracious God / here / where we have no
abiding or dwelling place / a pure and quiet conscience / through thy son
Jesus christ who is our only rest. So be it.

For Kings Princes and Rulers.
Prayer.
O Lord of lords Jesus Christ / thou art an exempel and glass or myrrour of
them which gouuerne and bear rule of Realms / countries and cities / whom
they ought to follow / for thou art the best and the wysest / and therefore
can thou not err / nor do any other thing but well. Vouchsafe with the light
of thy clerenes and with the fire of thy love / to kindle the hearts of al soch
/ as thou / through thy Godly providence / have instituted and ordained to be
rulers over the people / to the intent that they through the as through or by a
foregoing light / may see / and perceive what is best to be done / and fulfill
the same / and that they / taking thy always for a sure mark of their eye /
do not that thing which only seems good in their sight / but that which
may be to thy honor / to our proffyt ande to their health and salvation / to
the intent also / that they may justly and duelye minister and execute their
office / given unto them of the / so that we with them and they with us may
lead a peaceable / virtuous ande quiet life. So be it.

For all teachers and Preachers of the most holy word of God.
Prayer.
O merciful priest / chief Bisshoppe ande true good heard Jesus Christ
vouchsafe / through thy holy spirit / to strengthen all preachers and
teachers which thou have called ande sent to be laborers in thy holy harvest /
for to break and distribute the bread of thy holy word to the intent that they
may boldly and earnestly set their souls in the defense of thy holy word /
and for their sheep / against all the threatni^gs and false entreprises of the
raueni^g wolves and false prophets / which go about to seduce and bring us
out of the right way / for their bellies sake / through their false doctrine.

To the intent that they may so teach and declare us thy holy laws and
Gospel / that we may be taught and edified / and that also thy Godly honor
may daily more ande more be magnifyed thereby. Amen.

For all them which lie in the extreme panges of death / or otherwise.
O Pytyfull Physician ande healer both of soul and body / Christ Jesus.
Vouchsafe to cast thine eyes upon thy poor synnefull creature. N. who lies
here captive and bound with sickness / turning his weakness to thy glory and
to his health. And vouchsafe / good lord / to send him pacient sufferaunce /
that he may steadfastly continue to the end / and that he may with a true
ande parfet faith / fight manfully against all temptations of the deuell when
he may no longer continue. So be it.

For all women bound with the Lords bands.
Prayer.
GOd ^^^harted Lord Jesus christ Like as thou did comfort and deliver thy
dysciples and all elect and chosen holy men and women in all their need /
martyrdom and pains which they suffered of the tyrau^tes wrongfully / and
did also cure ande heal them of their wounds / pains and smarte /
through hope of the crown of everlasting life. Even so vouchsafe (thou which
art a helper of all them that call on the in all trouble and need) to deliver
this pore weak vessel / which is here bound with a fruit after thine own
symilitude and lykenes (notwithstanding that she has deserved in transgressyng
of thy holy commandment / to bring forth her children in pain and woo) that
she may be made a glad and joyful mother / through the new creature with good
speed / that the child may have name and Christendom / and that the mother
may be purifyed to thy honor and to her health. So be it.

Prayer.
O Good father and geuer of all goodness / God almighty / we (poor sely worms
of the earth) labor and take pains / dig and delue / til and plowe / plant
and sow / and can do no more.

But thou only may ande wylt give the increase in due time. Therefore most
best / yea / only good father and God / vouchesafe (through thy deuyne
providence) to preserve ande keep all the fruits of the earth / and suffer the
same to grow and increase to a parfect grouth / although we are not worthy of
it but for thy names sake / to the intent we may use them to our necessyte and
sustinaunce / with thankesgeuing / and always to thy glory. So be it.

A general confession.
Romans iii. Gene. vi. and.iii. v.
O Lord God almighty / father of mercy and God of all co^force / we thy pore
creatures resort unto the knoledging and confessyng our selves before thy
glorious majesty / that we all are grievous sinners ande can of our selves do
nothing but sin. For all our ymaginacions / intents and thoughts are
inclined and desposed unto evil from our youth up. O see. xiii. ii. Cor. ii.
Philii. ii. Gene. iii. Ephesians ij. Ps. l. lxij. John xv. E^a. lxiii^ Iere. xiij.
Our dampnacio^ comes of our selves / we of our selves are not able to
think a good thought. It is thou only that do work in us both the will and
the deed. We are but earth and naturally the children of wrath. We of our
selves are but vain / yea / lighter then vanity it self / We ca^ do nothing
without the. There is not one of us whole / we are all unclean / and al our
righteousness is but as a fylthy cloth. We have no more power to do good of our
self / the^ a black Mor^a^ or man of Inde has power to change his skin / or
the Leopard her spots. Now acordi^g to this evil and corrupt in^^ination of
our nature so have we lived I thought / word / and deed. Deny. ix
We have sinned / we have offended / we have gon^ back from thy law / and
have not harkened unto thy word.

we have no^ loved the (O lord our god) with all our heart with all our soul
/ with all our strength and with all our power. We have been fore
tra^sgressours of thy co^maundeme^ts. We have nor put our whole trust and
confydence only in the. We have in our troubles and need / not sought for help
only in the. We have not called only upon thy name / but with false
confidence / with vain supersticion / and unlawful oaths have we blasphemed
thy name. We have praid and made intercessyo^ unto stocks and stones / and
made thy creatures our advocates ande mediators contrary to thy word. We have
reposed our trust and affiance in our own deeds and in such works as have
been devised by men's fantasyes besides thy scripture.

We have wandered on vain pylgr^mages / offering up money / candels ande
tapers to images and relikes with such like supersticion. We have been
slothful in our busynes. We have not been fervent and diligent in doing of our
duty. Specially on such days as be appointed for the preaching of thy word /
we have not plied our selves wholly to learn it / nor occupied our time in
prayer and geui^g thanks unto the.

And as touchi^g the love that we ought to have unto al me^ and women for thy
sake we have not bee^ earnest in at al times. We have not loved our neighbors
as our selves / we have not done / as we would be done unto / we have been
vnge^tle / impatient / discourteous froward / a^gry and displeased. We have
reioysed in our neighbors hurt and been sorry of his welfare. We have dene
led with false doctrine and errors from the way of thy truth / We have
sinned with our fathers / we have done amiss / we have dealt wykedly. Psalm.
xvj.
Therefore our most dear father which art in heaven / for as much as we have
blasphemed the / and not sought always the glory of thy name / grant now that
from henseforth thy name may be sanctified ande hallowed in us / Grant now
that thy kingdom may come / and that in stead of sin and error / thou one-
