The ship of fools.
Gaudeamus oe^s^



Here after follows the prologue of the translatour of this present book
intytled the great ship of fools of this world.
Knowing that Melius est habundare quam deficere. It is better to have
haboundaunce of diverse things than to have necessyte. Wherefore I have put
myself to translate this present book called the great ship of fools out
of Frensshe in to English / because that this book has been first made in
Allemayne language / and out of Allemayne it was translated into latin by
master Jaques Locher / and out of latin in to rethoryke Frensshe. I have
considered that the one delyteth them in latin / ye other in Frensshe / some in
ryme / and the other in prose / for the which cause I have done this / more
over considering this that Therence Therentius.
says. Tot capita tot sensus / also many heedes / also many opynyons. And than
considering ye saying of Uyrgyle Uirgilius.
Trahit sua queque voluntas. Every body will do after their voluntees / and
will accomplysshe them / but as Uyrgyle says more over. Nescia men's hoi^m.
The voluntees of men is unknown. Wherefore they yt will have latin take it / ye
frensshe ryme or prose / or alleman or English. Who will have ye moral sens
take it / who that will have the lytterall sens take it. And who will have all
take all as says Esope. To the honor of ye Esopas.
right hye and right sacred trynyte / fader / sone / and holy ghost in one
essence / and of the right glorious mother of god / and of all the saints of
paradyse I have begone to make this translacyon for to exhort ye poor humaynes
/ the which by imbelycytes / and pusyllanimytes / have ensued ye fools of
this present world / and their works And to the end that they may eschew
al mondanytes and folyes / I pray them that they have regard unto this
present book / and that they comprehend the substance / to ye end that they
may wisely govern them self in the time to come / and that thorugh their
labor they may be of the nombre of ye saved. For when a man debateth / the
shame that it be not vaynquysshed multe plyeth his force. And the good
conscience also multeply eth virtues in man. Considering also that the prose
is more famylyer unto every man than ye ryme. I Henry Uirgilius.
Watson indygne and simple of understanding / have reduced this present book
in to our maternall tongue of English out of Frensh / at the request of my
worship full master wynkyn de word / thrughe the entysement and exhortacyon
of ye excellent pryncesse Margarete / countess of Rychemonde and Derby / and
grandame unto our most naturell sovereign lord king Henry ye. viii. whom
Ihesu preserve from all encombraunce. If that I have added any thing in any
place I have not done it by arrogaunce / but for to apply unto the scripture.
/ and because that it came unto purpose. I have not wylled to change the name
of the book ye which has been called by the first composer the ship of
fools. He has fygured a ship full of fools fletynge upon a see / By the
ship we may understand the folyes and er roures that the mondaynes are in /
by the se this present world / the fools being in the ship / is the
sinners / for we are in this world as pilgrims fletynge from one country to
another / and after our operacyons we shall be remunered at the port of
salute. Sith that it is so / we must search in this book the which may well
be ^^lled the doctrynall of fools / for there may be fou^den good and
helthfull doctrynes contained as well in the holy pagyne / as in the works of
ye saints and prophets / of laws and of the decretes of holy faders the
which have rowed so well in this world that they are aryued at a good port
that is in the glory eternal / to the which will conduyte us the fader / the
sone / and the holy ghost. amen. You lectours humbly I require you for to
pardon me if that I have erred in any thing / for ye tenderness of my years
has so affusked me that I have not applied me unto the lettres as Jought to
have done / the language is not autentyke / to the end that euerybody may
understand some thing / for folks un lyttered demands not things obscure.

Prolude of this present book.
Now is the world full of science and documentes made by our au^cyent faders /
in such wise that the holy scripture is in gretter vygoure than ever it was /
for in her is all right. First we have the holy bible of ye au^cyent faders. In
ye which appears euydently their feats and lives / we may take good
ensamples for to sustain and nourysshe our poor souls. For he that loves
not virtues is reputed vile. More over we have ye books of phylosophye wherein
is contained all goodness it is they wherein all the wise men did learn / she is
excellent and of great pryse. And who that delyteth in her may have right
great prouffyte. But this notwithstondynge I marvel me of every mortal man /
because yt they think not upon their salute / and think sooner to assemble a
great sort of sins / and how that god consumes us not / seeing yt we
offend hy^ so much. Good doctrine is chaced out of the world every day /
and in folly and imbelycyte man passes his days / he flees and leueth good
doctrine. Palas was wont to keep the ren Pal^s.
ges in this world / but by our great and enorme sins we may not suffer it.
She is in heaven where as she serves the saints of whom she is love. None or
right few have her prudence / science / or doctrine / we have not the ouerture
of probyte / faith / conscience / love / and pity is not in us / but echone
dysprayseth his god / where fore he yt takes virtues / cheseth a good place.
Noneste things and good condycyons we dysprayse. The holy saints documentes
and admonestinges we despise with the celestyall doctrynes so dulcet and amerous
unto the good and dyscrete men of this world. More over we fall in infynyte
errors that in the world is the worste and are releued in a myscheuous empire
/ by our sins are infynyte / and none of us has a steadfast degree. By
playnes / ways / paths / tauernes / markettes / streets / mountains / hills
/ field s / and fynably by all quarters is excercysed glotonye which is so vile
/ in taking inutyle ways / and not the way of salute. We follow capons /
tauernes / etynge and drinking insacyably / we replenysshe our bodies
immeasurably with lecherye and delycates / sobrenes is not found in us / every
body is trobled with this vice. Our hertes is affusked so that it demands
nothing but vanytees / our souls we fulfill with fylthes and lecheryes in like
wise / and of othervyces mo than a hundred. By the means whereof there is great
haboundaunce of fools thorugh the world / in such wise that in diverse
regyons and countrees their folyes redoundeth / so much that all virtues and
pure things contamyne and dysprayse by their folly Some we neth to be right
wise and dyscrete / ye which knows neither right civil nor canon / and by
this moyen they are always fools. Such folks ought not to be byleued that
are so over wenynge and unknowing / for oftentimes they are taken for good and
is al replete with vaynglorye / of good wit they are void and yet they repute
themself prudent and wise. Now then the good and loyal shall have their
deserte and hyre. And fools peruers shall be unwritten. Wherefore I will give
every body good loos after my possybylyte and the deserte of echone. By my
fyccyons I shall dress upon ye se ships and barges / and shall furnysshe
them with cords and top castelles verges and sayl^s / ores and botes / in
great multitude. And shall take them in diverse countrees where as all the
humaynes shall reygne good and evil / blind / seek / and hole / and with my
propre hands shall order them without cessynge also long as (...). It is also
well necessary for me / for there is ^o (...) les innumerable that do infynyte
euylles / whom I (...) not write all in this present book. These fools
re(...) unto our ships much impetuously / in such wy^e yt they hurt their
fete and legs for ha^^ to come until our ship. When I think on their
molestacyons / and their mestimable folyes with their great euylles / there is
mo of them than a great company of honey bees ^^eynge in the feldes upon the
odyfferent flowers. And bryefli there is so many folysshe erroures a broad that
our ship is almoost all replete with them. Of these fools some is prentyses
and will have the gouernynge after their wylles / many ye shall se dyscerne /
and each saying I will govern all / both maste / sayll / Some will be byneth
in y^ ship / the which has but little delight when he has seen the peril
so dangerous / but there is few that has this fere / and yet they have
passed thrughe out my ship. The last of these rennynge fools will be above
the other / and will draw up the sayll on lofte / to the end that it may
enter more in to the sea. If that you will know what is this ship / know
that each of us has a ship / but yet there is one the which is comune / and
all fools / that has diverse hunes and tops / and goche in to diverse
countrees / the which is replete with many sorts of fools. O you reygnynge
that have fair faces / myrre you here and red? this present book / for there
is not an humayne but that he may se his form in this book. If that you
entende totally unto my doctry nes / be you well sure that you may acquyre the
glory eternel / and eschew the pardurable pains of hell / for you shall
have fruit of virtues and benedyccyon of god. folly shall not go and fetch
you / and our ship ye wol de not seek / but ye may acquyre the glory
pardurable / you shall go the way that all the christian men watch / and shall
acquyre virtues and holiness / putting all evil vy ces out of you. Consider
humayne folks and mortal men the feats and the desires mondaynes / and ye
shall know that the most strongest / the most wysest / and the most
valyauntest go rennynge more swyfter than the hynde / and their trace is not
known. Alas our lives passes right sone. He that is poor and has nothing
is holden for a fool / that parauenture is without sy^ne / Alas he is more
wyser than they yt have much goods / and be in the subgeccyon of the devil.
And he is holden for right wise that has haboundaunce of goods / and he is
so replete with sin that it is a thing inestymable / ye so much that through
his offense he is casten in to the fire of hell / wise is he not but a parfyte
fool. The poor that is reputed for a fool at his aste end looks to be
partycypar of the goods of dame palas. They yt love virtues without doing
outrage to any body / god shall love them without any fault / so that he bear
not a folysshe mytre / and if he were of science vnpuruayed / So that he be
replete with virtue / he shall be more wyser than a great clerk. I find
assembles of fools by great hepes and routes of diverse nacyons and manners for
the one is vnbraynles that will bear baners. The other is of fyers thoughts
the which does not enploye them but alonely to assemble rychesses. And
bryefly for to know which is the fools I shall name them here unto you.
Nobles / clerks / priests / monks / apostates burgeyses / merchants /
rich / poor / and of all crafts / is our ship almoost full. There is
neither rustyke / old / young / berdles / strong / feeble / great / nor little
have they never so much science. if they be fools they have no respyte but
that they come hastily in to our ship / Not alonely the men / but also the
women / ladies / gentylwomen / burgeyses / old and young / dronkerdes / and
sobre / pudykes / chaste / wedowes / and married women be in our ships with
the men / for in diverse things me ueth diverse folks / and pryncypally in
voluptuous love / in such wise that they leave all good operacyons for to live
in carnal felycyte and lubryke life. Mondayne fools myrre you well in my
glass / and you shall se your fautes and sins. And shall know euydently how
folly does govern you. Know that our entencion preten death to none other
thing save that we may make satysfaccyon unto god / to the end that we be
full of virtues for to leave our ship and mast / and our importable dyscorde /
leave sin / and go out of the mire / for it is yt which puts the soul to
death / do it sone and I shall be of your accord. If that some fools mock us
because of our little wrytynges / and that there is comprehended diverse fools
in it / they have small vnderstondynges / for the sens lytterall is not the
substance of the matter. Such folks is like them that think for to ete the
almondes kyrnelles without brekynge of the stones / for who that will find
savor therein must break it / also who will find prouffyte in this book /
ought to rest him on the moral sens that is covered with folly. My book
satyryke I give unto you for example. Lords if it please you for to read it /
and if it seem you yt it is mordaunt excuse me as the auncyentes are excused /
the which have made diverse fair doctrynes mordauntes. The poets have also
compyled diverse noble books correckynge the vices of the humaynes. All this
considered I will follow them / notwithstondynge yt I am not worthy. But yet in
manner of pass time I will speak here of fools men and women / and assygne
them guaryson of virtues / science / and doctrine / for to make them
condyscende unto goodness. For I had never other will but for to detraye young
bachelors out of sins and vices / and to conduyte them unto the port of
reason and virtue / Pardon me you orators if any thing be evil couched and
you lectours that occupyeth the time in this lecture if you find any fault /
please it you to excuse the capacyte of me / and the yongthe that I am yet in /
consydery^ge that there is none so well shodde but that they may slide sometime.

Argument in the ship of Fools of this World.
FOr the felycyte and salute of all the humayne gendre is compyled and dyrecte
the ship of fools of this transytory world / in the which ascends all
they that vageth from ye way of truth / and from the plain exhortacyon of
ye intellectyue understanding in transmutable and obscure thoughts of ye
frail body. Wherefore this present book may be called satyr / notwithstondynge
that the first auctoure did delight him in the new intytulacyon of this
present book / for right so as by the poesyes and fyccyons / the ancient
poets did correct ye vices and fragylytees of mortal men. Semblably this
present pagyne specifyeth before their sight the estate and condycyon of men /
to the end that as a myrroure they behold the meurs and rectytude of life.
Nevertheless think not ye lectours that I have word by word dyrecte and
reduced this present book out of Frensshe in to our maternall tongue of
English / for I have only (as resyteth Flaccus) taken entyerely the
substance of the scripture / in esperaunce that mine audace presumptuous should
be pardonned of the lectoures / having aspecte unto ye capacyte of my tender
years / and the imbylycyte of my little understanding / in leuynge the
egressyons poetyques and fabulous obscurtees / in achyeuynge the work in
facyle sentence and famylyer style / in supplyenge all the reders to have me for
excused if that I have failed in any thing.

Here after ensues the first chapter.
Of books inutyle. ca. primo.
The first fool of the ship I am certain
That with my hands dress the sails all
For to have books I do all my besy pain
Which I love not to read in special
Nor them to se also in general
Wherefore it is a proverb all about
Such thinks to know yt stands in doubt


Young folks that entende for to know diverse things approach you unto this
doctrine and it reuolue in your minds organykes / to the end that ye may
comprehend and understand the substance of it / and that ye be not of the
nombre of ye fools that vageth in this tempesteous flode of the world. And
you also the which have passed the flourynge aege of your youth / to ye end
that and ye be of the nombre of the fools moundaynes that ye may learn
somewhat for to detraye you out of the ship stultyfere. Wherefore understand
what the first fool says being in the great ship of fools. I am the
first in the ship vagaunte with the other fools. I turn and hyse the
cords of the ship saylynge far forth in the sea. I am founded full evil in
wit and in reason. I am a great fool for to affye me in a great multitude of
books. I desire always and appetyteth new inuencyons compyled mystycally / and
new books / in the which I can not comprehend the substance / nor
understand nothing. But I do my besy cure for to keep them honestly from
poudre and dust. I make my lectrons and my deskes clean right often. My mansyon
is all replenysshed with books / I solace me right of ten for to se them open
without any thing compylynge out of them. Ptolomeus was a rich Ptolomeus.
philadelphus. cuius memini. Josephus. si. xii.
man the which constytued and commanded that they should search him thorough
every regyon of the world the most excellentest books that might be founden
/ And when they had brought them all / he kept them for a great treasoure.
And that notwithstanding he ensued not ye ensygnementes nor ye doctrine of the
dyuyne sapyence / how be it that he could dyspose nothing of the life without
it / what books someuer he had / nor compose any thing to the relefe of his
body at that time. I have read in diverse books / in the which I have studied
but a little while / but oftentimes I have passed the time in beholdynge the
dyuersytees of the couerynges of my books. It should be great folly to me to
apply by excessyue study mine understanding unto so many diverse things /
where through I might lose my sensual intellygence / for he that procures for
to know ouermoche / and occupyeth himself by excessyue study / is in danger
for to be extraught from himself also euerychone is dyspensed / be he a clerk
or understood he nothing yet he bears the name of a lord. I may as well
commytte one in my place the which thinks for to learn science for him and
for me. And if that I find myself in any place in the company of wise men to
the end that I speak no latin / I shall condyscende unto all their
preposycyons for fere that I should not be reproched of that that I have so
euylly learned. O Proverb. v.
doctors the which bears the name and can nothing of science / for to
eschew great dyshonoure come ne(...) in the company of learned men / our
ancient faders here before did not learn their resplendysshynge science in
the multitude of books / but of an ardaunt desire and of a good courage. They
had not their spyrytes so unsteadfast as ye clerks have at this present time /
it were more propyce for such folks for to bear asses eeres / than for to
bear the names of doctors and can nothing of cunning.

Of good counsayll. ca. secundo.
The counsayll the which does not well conserne
His own estate and great affynyte
And from others hurt does not his dyscerne
Is well worthy to have aduersyte Proverb. v

And to be deiecte from prosperyte
For he brings the hog unto the pyt
And afterward reuerseth him in it


HEre after ensues of them that will have enter in to the senate / or in the
court of some great lord or prince / to the end that they may have honor
and reverence of the people in their country / and to be exalted before the
other / and it is they the which ben ye leest Ecclesia. ii.
expert in scyences / as in law / and decrete / and good counsel by such
folks is obscurely couerde and hyd in vain words / and walks by tenebrous
centres. At rome auncyently were good cou^sayllers / wise / prudent / and
lettered / the which canonykely and imperyally punysshed the malefactors /
and things yllycyte and vycyously done And the things that were good and
honest they mayntened in multyplyenge from day to day ye tranquylyte and
welfare of ye things publyke. But at ^ene^^.
this present time in many places be some cou^sellers and governors of courts
/ as well seculers as ecclesyastykes that can not eschew some evil passage /
nor dyscerbe the lytyges and debates / nor unbind the knotte yt is bounden. If
that a presydent require him for to give lib. ii. ff. de origi. (...).
him some good counsayll upon some defuse matter / he is so full of pride and
grauyte that he will not declare unto him no new thing / also it should be
against reason for to make pure and clean water issue out of a vessel the
which is maculate and fulsome. He flees from the other / and seems that he
will not say never a word unto their preposycyons / but he will not in no
manner of wise gaynsaye them for fere lest they should dysprayse him because of
his vnreasonnable responce and uncunning / and in this manner of wise is the
counsel corrumped / lo how such folk do Justyce the which depends upon
them. Alas senate and court royal / what forfayture / what evil nature /
what grievous euylles is sueth from the that ought to be mother and nouryssher of
Justyce. Know thou not how that thy propre cou^sayllers assemble them
together when there is any verdyte or sentence to be given / and if that there
be twain of one semblable oppynyon / the other will not empesshe the sentence
be it egall or not and so lettteth it pass / and by this report unjust the
court shall execute false Judgment. Alas it is not enough for to here the

they not then redotynge fools that assemble so much richesse / and

Every body ought for to govern them after the auncyentes and good customs /
but that which was of old antyquyte vycyous / crymynell / and dyshonest / is
at this present time taken for honest by new vsages / new customs have all the bruyte at this time among diverse folks. I can not well conspyre in my
heart the which is the most fool of them twain that use the old or ye new
customs / or he the which wereth great sleues with Math. xviii.
great bordures / or they the which bears large sleues / Save that me
thinks it is all one thing / and that ye one is as folysshe as the other.
For he thinks that has the bordured sleues that he is as honestly clothed /
as he the which has the large sleues. Among the auncy ente faders it was a
great loouynge and praysynge for to have long berdes / that custom should be
right folysshe and strange unto us at this present time. Socrates ii. regum. x.
the which was a great phylosophre began first for to bear a berde / and
after him all the other phylosophres took that custom. After that the good
philosophers were departed out of this world / fragylyte and luxury did
sprede all about the world / in such wise that almoost it floryssheth among
all sins. All ye virtues wherewith the hye elements ben decored and aourned /
ben all vices and sins in a casualte through the world. All the humaynes
will counterfeit that which our lord has create / and by their presumpcyon
thinks to do better than god. O what error / what abomynable sin. Some
bears great berdes for fere that they seem not more ancient. They array their
bodies Sicambri. Ethiopes.

Ample bonettes with low necks / and guarded like as it were for dyspyte / and

the fair sword or hanger by their side. O crystendome crystendome / if thou

Of ancient fools. ca. v.
Alas for all that ever I enclyne
To my sepulture both by hour and day
yet can I not leave the folysshe ruin
That I have continued in always
And of old fools ever has kept the lay
Wherefore of old fools I may be the chief
For all that is vice has been to me lefe


AWaken your spyrytes ancient folks / the which have been fools all your
life / and harken how that this old fool makes his co^playnte. The great
folly right vycyous and replenysshed with bytternes that has ever remained in
me sith mine enfancye / may not suffer that I leave mine ancient custom and
first life. I am a child / and yet ye may se that I can not go. I have a. C.

fader / of the which he is gretely reioysed / and would be right angrye to

Of the documente of children. ca. vi.
He that forgyueth the crimes right vycyous
Of his children withouten correctynge
And them enduceth not in virtues glorious
Is well worthy to have great tormentynge
And the anguysshe by long contynuynge
For why he seeks all the ways he can
To live in sorrow as a folysshe man.


Young children the which desires to live well and ryghtwysly / rest you and
harken to my doctrynes / and you also faders that have children in your
puyssaunce. The fader shall be always miserable / and gretely affusked that
has not some aspecte unto his children. and that does not pain and
solycytude for to reduce them unto virtuous operacions / ferynge the death that
comes upon them for their works unreasonable and mortal. He is also a fool
detestable and manifest that sees his children do evil and cares not
therefore. Alas it is not well considered of you for to suffer youth voluptuous
to run every where withouten conductour. or gouernoure. For when a flock of
sheep ben without a pastor / they leave their hye way in errynge and strayenge
by the feldes and playnes / in such wise that oftentimes the wulfe comes and
deuoureth them. And in like wise is it of young children that resorteth unto
vycyous places who so does comprehend it well. O folysshe fader more
unreasonable than a dombe be / for when one accuses his children of some
trespace / he excuses them: saying that it is youth / and that they have no
reason / and that they know not whether they do well or evil. O poor fools
they do well / their youth can not excuse them. Know thou not thou blind
fader that sapyence grows in tender meurs / and dysposeth ye lycoure and
doctrine of holy life. Know thou not that sapyence adresseth sooner unto
young folks / than unto old / for they retain it better in their under

Take ensample also of a young tree / for one may bow it in each manner of
wise / but when the tree is great and strong one may not bow it without
brekynge. Wherefore faders endoctryne your children in their florysshynge youth
/ for ve retably sweet correccyon and dyscyplyne / enduceth yon ge chyldre unto

for pure sorrow slew herself before all her friends. It happened afterward
that both his fader and he were chased out of rome vylaynously / and because
of this there was never king of Rome sith. Is it not written also of Catellyna
that was so diverse / so cruel and so per ^ers / and how that after him his
neuewes became more cruel in vyllaynous deeds and homycyde than their uncle
had been before them / and all was thrughe his vycyous example. If a fader has been evil / the child shall be more vycyous / for most comynly the chy^^e
ensues the fader. Wherefore I say that it were better for a chyl de to ensue
the good and prudent men / than for to follow a great company of fools replete
with all vices. Find we not also how king Peleus resplendysshynge in Peleus.

this world gave his sone Alexaunder unto Arystotle / prince of phylosophres

dyscrete fader / o what a good master / o how gracyous a dyscyple / this
present time is not so / for it is now holden and reputed shame / the
folysshe faders sets no store to set their children to the ^^ole for to
learn science that is the flower of all worldly things but complayneth their

them prouf fyte and pleasure / and to desire to keep ye said acquayntaunce.
Alas at this present time such honest alyaunce and love is no more among men.
All is corrumped / for there is no more love in greece as has been. Take
ensample humayne creatures of Patroclus that was slain by Hector because that
he had praised the guysarmes of Achylles / which would have Justed against the
Troyens. But Achylles came adoubed with all his arms in to ye batayl for to
avenge his good friend Patroclus / and he did so much that he found Hector
taking a prisoner / and when he espied him he couched his spear and ran him
in at the foundemente as he was taking up his prisoner and slew him. And
after he bound hy^ ^ilades. Horrestes.
unto his horse tail by derysyon / and trayled him before the castle of ylyon
in ye sight of his fader. Then he kept Her narrat theodosius vt refert
bocatius de genealo. deoru^. libro. xii. capi pitu. xx.
his body at the sepulcre of Patroclus by the space of twelve days and more /
and in this manner he revenged the death of his friend Patroclus. Consider more
over the hystorye of Horrestes that was king Agamenons sone / how after that
Egistus by the exhortacyon and sterynge of his mother Clitemestra had slain
his fader. By Electra his sister he was delivered out of Astrophylle Hanc
hystori am pomt valerius. li. iiii. capt. vi.
for to save him from death / for they would have slain him. Horrestes
knowing that ye thing went so / he thought that he would be avenged upon his
mother Clytemestra and upon the thief Egisteus. And so when he had avenged the
death of his fader Agamenon he became all frantyke and mad so yt it was great
pity / For always him thought that he save his mother in fla^bynge fire and
enuyronned with hedeous serpents / ye which would have slain him. When
Pylades that was his perfyte friend saw him in such inconuenyence / he
promised him faithfully that he would never habandonne him unto the time that
he were guarysshed So long they went by their Journeys that they arrived in
the isle of Colchos / and there found the temple of ye goddess Dyane / when
their prayers were done and fynysshed / Horrestes received guaryson of his
maladye / and never after that he saw no more that ye which he had seen
before / and that was by his loyal fellow that accomplysshed his auowe so
truly. We read also of Amon and of the good Pythyas that were so go Demades.

de fellows and friends / for Denis the cruel tyraunte would have put one of
them to death / wherefore his fellow would not accord thereto / for the one was
content to suffer death for the other. In semblable wise we have example of
Scypyon right excellent domynatour of sodomy and Lybye that loved Lelyus so
fervently that ye memory redoundeth yet unto this day. Behold we also the
great love that Theseus had unto Pyrrothus / ouidius and lactantius narra^t vt
refert boca. de. ge. deo. li. ix. c. xxxiiii. Prouer^.10. xiii. and. xxix.
that for to rauysshe Proserpyne goddess of hell / transported him in to the
cauerne / and when Cerberus the porter of hell saw Pyrrothus / anon he slew
him. Theseus was taken prisoner by Pluto god of hell / the which made him be
bounden in a spelunke. Hercules aduertysed of the truth descended in to hell
/ and vaynquysshed all / and bound Cerberus with three chains / and after
unbound Theseus and led him away maugre all the enhabytauntes therein. By
this we may understand the amyte of Theseus / and the pity of Hercules that
did socoure him. Such friends be no more in course / the time of love is
passed / for every body entendeth to his synguler prouffyte / there is no more
faith nor law in this world / to the moyen of this I conclude that our
volente and courage is worse than a spear trauersynge some body / for we have
neither felycyte nor love / but sooner crudelyte reygneth among us / for the
which cause it is no meruayll though aduersyte do mine upon us that be void
of benygnyte.

GOod christen men I supply you with all my heart that ye retain this that
shall be reherced unto you here after following / for veretably it is right
prouffytable unto us. They that by wanhope will not give credence unto the
ancient scryptures be fools / seeing that they dysprayse the parables and
words of the prophets the i. ad thymo. iiii.
which proceeded from the dyuynyte. They desire more sooner to read plays /

that has had ever god in reverence and honored the heuens. They flee the holy
scryptures / and the force of the faith / by ye which ye synful soul might be
preserved Such folks Ecclesia. ii. Marci. xvi. Johannis. iii
has none envy to live honestly like creatures / but like as unreasonable
beestes / thinking that there is no god / and that there is none habytacyon so
noble and excellent as this miserable world / and fereth nothing Psalm. xiii.
the meruayllous deeds of our lord Ihesu christ / all the pain is lost yt is
done for to teache them how they should govern them / for they will do nothing
at all / save to despise it. When any body tells them of the goodness of heaven
/ of the precious treasours / of the blessed aungelles / of the archaungelles /
of the cherubynes / of the potestates / of the thrones / of the ordres / and of
the holy syeges aourned and replenysshed with holy saints / as well men as

reherseth to them the ways unto hell / the cursed treasours right stynkyng
replete with playntes / and with infynyte euylles / envy ronned with floodes
all enuenymed / certainly it is pain lost / for their hard hertes obstynate

travail his body and heart for to read upon Psalmus. xci.

for they will not believe nor keep the scryptures of the faith / nor the
commandments of the law. The pore fools be not aferde for to go in to the
infernal pyt of hell / there to endure pains intolerable / hard cries /
and torments inhumayne. O poor fool thou sees well enough if thou be not a
sleep before thy fete the mouynge / the gylted doctrynes of our faith / the
laws of old antyquyte / and the tryumphes of our lord. Thynkest thou that
thyn ygnoraunce shall excuse thyn erroures / (no) but shall cause the for to be

By cause that I know that there is many diverse fools in this world errynge
from the way of veryte I have great will for to reduce them unto the hye way /
to ye end that they adnychyll their insacyate erroures right dangerous. The
ygnoraunt vnpuruayed of wit and reason / that never thinks on the things

thought not that such a fortune should have befallen me. And when the Seneca.
fortune is passed they study how they might eschew it / to ye end yt they

the time future Eccle. xxxiii.

a man of great counsayll. But when he was at rest and tranquylyte / his
prudence left him. for if he had read the chartre that was presented before

interyt / for after that he must needs deye. if Nychanor had well edefyed and
founded Nichanor. i. macha. vii.

judgment was right fyerse and cruel / for his heed was smyten of / and his
false tongue drawn out of his heed and given unto the birds for to ete. And
after that they smote of the hand ye which had menaced the house of god. He
would under the vmbre of amyte have slain Judas by treason. whereto god would
provide a remedy / for he and all his retynewe was slain there and destroyed
utterly. The which is an euydente example to us for to have aspecte and
remembrance of the end / and of that the which might happen afterward. He
the which has much seen in ye time paste / and has provided for the time
to come / takes the dysposycyons of the creator right Joyously in every
place. And for the good remembrance and memory that he has had of the time
future / he is dygne / and worthy for to have great laud and praysynge / for
we se from day to day many folks that endure great Pro^erbio. ii. (...) xiii.

Of vain and transytory love. ca. xiii.
The fools that been bound with this cord
I draw in to mine excellent toures
Because that they to me accord
In serving me well at all hours
As true lovers and paramoures
For whom that I smite fervently

chapter / and ye shall have intellygence in what estate ye be in. Uenus that
is ye conductour of cupydo holds all lovers in her bonds. He is a fool that
dystempereth himself / and puts him in the way of lamentacyons / of
dystresse / of myse ryes / and of dolours / and submytteth them in ye service
of this lady. O how many excellent cytees has venus destroyed and brought to
naught by her concupyscence. She has caused and empesshed many folk from
their prosperyte and welfare. We read of full many au^cyent men and women that
has been wounded by her of the darte of her sweet sone Cupydo. By her ben
happened many euylles. The Troyens has been poor and dolorous by her
exhortacyon / and their noble cite that was so strongly fortefyed with walls
and dytches dystroyed and burnt. The septre of king Pryam that was so
tryumphaunt was casten down / and all for the luxury of the fair Paris yt
rauysshed Helayne. O hard morsure that for pleasure mondayne suffered such
ruin and destruccyon. Was it not great pity that so noble a cite was
destroyed for such a cause. Also after that Marcus Anthonyus had vaynquysshed
the Persyens and that Marcus anthonius.
he had borne away the price / as he returned he was ra uysshed in the love of
Cleopatra / that promised him ye Cleopatra.
empire of Rome / the which made his men for to arm them / and made prepayre
two hundred ships garnysshed with arowes and darts for to conquer the
empire of Rome. But Cezar made for to enquere of the folys she purpose of this
lover. And dyscomfyted him and all his men / wherthrugh he vndyde himself in
the cite of Alexandre because yt they would not take him to mercy. And within a
little while after Cleopatra in gretelamentacyons and sorrows made herself to
be transported unto the cite of Alexandre beside her lover marcus Anthonyus by
two serpents yt she put to her pappes / and there shed her blood
excessyuely without ye conforte of any body / and deyed beside her lover. If
the se two lovers had maynteyned and continued in chasty te they had not
deyed so myserably. He that applies his time in love has no reason / he is
without law / and all evil redoundeth unto him. The puyssaunce of Uenus
Ouidius.
is such that who that serves her in love is ever oppressed with dolour^ and
bitter rage. He is not holden Prouer. v.
for a prudent man that will not eschew the darte yt he should be persecuted
with. He shows himself never constaunt that supporteth with all his mind
Uenus / and her sone Cupido. And who that is smyten by her can not dyssymyle
never so much but that it ^s known in their vysage. When Theseus was in
hell Phedra was Theseus. Phedre. ypolitus.
rauysshed in the love of ypolytus / the which would not love such a lady.
Wherefore she was right angrye / and accusedhym to her husband / saying yt
ypolytus would have taken her by force. Fynably this ypolytus was quartred and
drawn at four horses tails. And after yt he was deed she confessed that they
had put him wrong fully to death. And then for very poor sorrow and
dysconforte she strangled herself pyteously. We read also of Pasyphyle that by
ardaunt concupyscence had a do Pasipha. Dedalus. minotaurus. Nero.

cowes skin / and put Pasyphyle therm / and then made her to go about ye
court / and the bulle chaufed him so that he engendered on Pasyphy le a monstre
that was half a man and half a bulle named Mynotaure. Neron also the cruel
man opened his moders belly: and did with his good noble mother by his cruelte
right vyllayne his sensual will / because that he would se the place of his
nayssaunce and birth. Also Messalyna for her pleasaunce and concupyscence
carnal went Messalina. et lassata viris nunquam satiata remansit.
every night to the bordell secretly / and with whom someuer she had ado
with she was never content nor pleased. And when the morning came / and that
ye day began to spring / she departed with such an ardaunte hete that it is
great horroure for to here it recounted. For Uenus by the report of the poets
held her in her bonds / because that she had served love all the days of her
life / the which was to her great shame and dishonor. Wherefore let these
examples remain evermore in your hertes. And follow no more the scole of the
god of love / for who that ensues it / lives ever in sorrow and dystresse /
for it is destruccyon of all good virtues and operacyons / as well to the man
as to the woman. O folysshe lovers that been all plonged in the profoundenes of
this vile and abhomynable sin without having aspecte unto the salvation of
thy poor soul. For also long as the goddess Uenus holds the in her hands
of love / you live as an unreasonable be / in taking all thy solace for to
think on thy lady in love. Thou for getest god and all his commandments /
in serving her as thy god. O what an unreasonable fool is he that puts a^
his Joye and delight in a vile carcas that is so corrupt with all vices. I add

were in oughe for to destroy a man / it were better never to begin a thing

which cytees by their great sins perysshed pyteouslye / as Nylycolas did /

well that the folk of Nylycola were blessed of our lord Wherefore he that
boroweth of every body and can not pay it again is a fool resembling unto a
wulfe that deuoureth all at ones. And he hates nothing so much as to find
a thing that pleases him / when he is going out of the field. Also the
dettour would never yt the term of payenge came / for the borowynge makes a
man poor. God suffers us to be in this world / not to commytte vile sins /
but to the end that we do merytoryous deeds / for when the time shall come
that we shall have no space to do good deeds / he shall punysshe us like as the
credytour does the dettour when he faylleth at his term.

Of petycyons and vows inutyle. xxvi.
Who that on hands and fete does pray
By false dyssymulacyon
Cryenge on god both night and day
That he would grant to them pardon
And give them clean remyssyon
They be fools that with cryenge
Thinks to obtain any thing
Among you foles that makes vows and prayers to god of heaven / understand
this chapter the which correcketh and instrueth you to live well. Before that
ye make prayers prepayre your souls (for the just) god will excuse / and the
sinner shall not be herd in no wise. And therefore to the end that ye reteyne
some thing I shall rehearse unto you the vows reproved. He that Eccle. xxiii.
Prouer. xx. Eccle. vii. Luce. xx. i fi. Joh. ix.
requires god without reason for a thing that is not good / and promyseth
him that and he grant it that he shall do a pilgrimage / or give of his
goods to the poor people. It happens that his request is not just nor
agreeable to god / wherthrughe comes to him some evil fortune / as it did to
Mydas king of Frygye as the poets recounteth / because that he required of
the Midas rex phrygum. Ouidius. metha. xi. Persius. i. sa.
gods to give him great haboundaunce of fine gold the which they vttred to
him facyly / wherefore it behooved him to fast / for all that he touched was
converted in to fine gold. And because that he made his request. Prouer. xxii.
there grew on his heed two ass eres. There is diverse that desires and
prays for none other thing to god Sapien. viii.
but for to have their houses full of richesse. Alas open your conscyences and
lift up your hertes that be so oppressed / and have remembrance that in old
antyquyte the richesse was occasyon of many euylles. What has Lycinus.
Crassus. Croesus. Juuenalis. Adhebre. g. Prouer. xxii.
auayled the great rychesses and possessions to Lycynus. The rentes of Crassus.
The treasour of Cresus and Sardanapalus. They fynysshed their days in great
dystresse. He the which floryssheth in youth desires for to live long in
his force and pleasure. How well yt by glotony and excess he shorteth his life
/ without consydery^ge that in old aege there is many that endures great
pain and anguysshe / dolours / and inestymable calamytes in their bodies /
heedes / arms and legs / and all was of to much etynge and drinking in
their youth And yet they were renowned in their flourynge aege dyscrete and
full of sapyence. As it appears of Nestor / Peleus. Nesior. Laertes. horatius
i art Sapie^tie. v. Eccle. xi.
and of Lacertes / and Peleus / the which lived longer than necessyte required
/ for they had many accydentes and outrages in their aege. Because that it
happens oftentimes that old and auncyente men become chyldysshe again / and
fynyssheth their days myserably / Some there be that desires to have fair
wives / the which when they have been conuersaunte with them a while and seen
all the guyse / they repent them all the days of their life ensuyng after. To
this says ye phylosophre / if thou have a wife keep her / and if thou have
none take none / for diverse euylles have fallen thereby.: / Some desires
puyssaunce mondayne ye which is cause of their great ruin. The other desires
corporal beauty Juuenalis.
/ that causes their souls for to descend in to the deep pytte of hell. O
fools that forgeth new vows by your insacyate volente full of maladyccions.
Demand of god health of thy body / salute for thy soul / and good faith /
good renown / and to habounde in virtues / to the end that ye may se face to
face him that deyed on the cross for all the humayne lygnage.

reasons / saying that they be not subgecte to right and reason / for their
flesh is frail. They go from street to street seeking the night and will
learn nothing / nor follow the techynges of wise and prudent men. They
resemble not to the dyscrete men / nor to them yt be their masters / the
which for to learn science did watch diverse times and took great pain and
solycytude. And yet there be diverse foles that will learn four or five
scyences without having perfyte intellygence of their grammar that is the
foundacyon of all scyences. They go rennynge unto logyke and makes a great
sort of arguments / and of crooked sophyms / and have ever in their mouth
sorts or plato / how well that by logyke and subtle arguments an obscure
thing may well be claryfyed. Nevertheless there be some that fyxeth their
study thereon without any other ensygnement. They resemble unto crekynge
frogs by their murmuracyons / for they tarry not on fair auctorytees / and
the mean while youth passes away / in taking his natural course without
any tastynge of delectable science / and so they remain always replete with
vices. Folysshe legistes / and decretistes yt studyeth in codice / and in

To give judgment on another. c. xxix.
Some thinks that they be right Just
And iugeth others men's vyse
Saying that to hell go they must
And never come in paradyse
He is a fool at each deuyse
To Juge another man's mysdede
And will not of his own take heed


Give audyence unto my words folysshe fools that iugeth the other for to win laud and praysynge. Juge not but if that ye will be iuged / ye se well a
strawein your broders eye / but ye se not a block in your own eye / O how
such folks be replete with folly / and their her tes full of vices and
anguysshous torments. Nevertheless Ezethie^ vndecimo. mathei. vl. Luce. vi:

they have esperaunce for to live always in their unhappy vices / and takes
course in them like the ebbynge flode. This same fool thinks that he is
good and virtuous / and never doubts to have hurt / and by his vain
esperau^ce fereth not to deye / and dysprayseth virtues in loving himself. He
iniuryeth every bo die in dysprysy^ge of their vices / but he is twyes so ill
and will never se nor here of his own vices / if he be tached with sin he
will blame another. He trusts to live ever in pease in his vile and
abhomynable sin. And if he se the death of his neighbor / yet he thinks
never to deye / but ever prospere in welfare. And if by adventure he se his
next neighbor deye / he shall say that it was long of himself / and that
he went to much in the wind / and in to the feldes where as he took to great
pain / and that he was never sound and hole / and also that he was full of
melancoly. Or else he will say that it is no dommage / for he was to great a
begyler / and Eccle. xi ecclesiastici. trices^mo octauo.
a deceyuoure / wherefore god would take him / and for ye euylles that he had
committed was in great danger to lose his soul / for this fool says that
the deed body had never merit in this world. And he on which he has all
this envy and on whom he says so much evil is out of the pains of this
world / and parauenture is saved in paradyse. And this fool puts himself
in the nombre of perfyte men / and parauenture he is replete with vile and
abhomynable sins. Alas pore Sapie^tie. iii.
fools judge no more so the death of other folks. Have ye no fere of death nor
of his mortal darte / and that lathesys come not and break the string of life
/ the which Eccle. i.
ye abide every day / not knowing the hour nor time / wherein rests all
your hole affyaunce / that sometime renneth as fast as the wind. The man yt is
just Ecclesia. vii. Seneca. Apoca. xviii. iii. q. vli. iudicet.
doubts always to be in sin / but Ihesus the true secretarye knows his
mind entyerly. Wherefore he yt would Juge another if that he be not of perfyte
life he should never besy himself there about / for one might suppose that he
did it by envy.

Of them that charge them with benefyces. ca. xxx.

Benefyces by great plenty
And takes in them no delight

ge them / and may not nor will not deserve them. And they have so much / and
so many sackes full that ye ass can not bear all / wherefore the charge must be
done else where if they will not slay the ass. One benefyce yt is reasonable
for to live upon can not suffyse at this present time. But for to have pecunes
that we love hertely / we be constrained to have many benefyces / and to
assemble money by great hepes. Such folks be never sacyate / and hurts
their souls / and all affusked they fall in to the tenebrous pyt infernal.
For they be so peysauntly charged that they can not tell the nombre / and they
be night and day in thought how they might have mo / in coueytynge always to
have more and more / for were they also old as ever was matheusale yet they
would not cease gaderynge nor never be sacyate. They ^ere the sack in their
hand and demands ever for c. a^^ricie. de preben. xlvii. di. sicut.
to take / as folk that be famysshed and full of couetyse. more vile than the
ass that bears them which ought not to be blamed / but ye master alonely
that charge / and ladeth him so much / and that so rudely constrayneth him
to bear them / if that Idurste say it ye ought ^o be cursed of god / for ye be
not constrained to bear so (...)uy charges. And through your great couetyse
ye ho^oure not god in no wise / and yet ye live by him with ^ut using of his
ryghtes. ^e be bounden for to give to ^he poor people that live here in this
world in great ^ystresse and myserye / and diverse times they can not ^ell
where to find their dinner nor their souper / and to (...) ye divine service as
ye should / and to spend your silver in fair vsages. But not in hawks /
hounds / horses / and gowns like seculers / ye do your will without consyde
racyon of that which is to come / and that might happen. O poor fools
insacyable consider your desires / and xvi. q. i. c. vl. 23. q. vlii. conueniet.
unhappy wylles / if ye knew the great dolours that ye shall suffer for these
desires / ye would never sustain so peysaunt and heavy deeds / how well that ye
may hold the^ here byneth in this world / but ye put ye soul in dau^ ger /
that peryssheth almoost for feblenesse for the great burden that the body
bears. My lords ye archebysshop pes / bysshoppes / abbottes / and pryoures /
what avails you for to confydere the benefyces and offices to men yt be not
propyce thereto / as to a sort of young folks that can no more science than
beestes / it is more charge unto them than unto the ass that is so sore
charged. They know not what is honor / and ye shall give accomptes / for
there is neither ye nor nay / but and they be vycyous ye be perteyners thereof.
Give your benefyces un to ryotours that or their rentes come in it is eten /
and spended. And when they have no more tolyue on / they commyt symonye /
making conuencyons / paccyons / permutacyons / under fyccyon by manner of
chaungyng moyennynge some pryse / gyuynge their benefyces in this manner / and
they say that it is well done without any myshappe. All this will say
bryefly that it is for to uphold their estates / plays / and for to maynteyne
their harlottes with / and they do many other euylles without comparyson. All
evil faith regneth in them / sith that symonye governs ones their brydels /
they be almost given to ye deuylles / for they can not repent them they be so
accustomed in it. Alas in old antyquyte the holy actuum. viii. i. q. i. petrus.

and the most virtuous man yt might be founden were he never so poor was

time it is not so / for he that is most ygnoraunt shall have it / and give to
every body a piece. Ye and that worse is they will be mytred without eleccyon /
and have ye pastoral staff. O poor symonyacle if that thou had a place
that were bygge enough and that would receive all thy fellows that be in this
world thou should have an innumerable nombre. And in thus doing in this
wretched world they be worthy and deserves to have the prebendes vile and
abhomy nable of Pluto god of the infernal palus / for such folks ben
commysed for to serve him / and for their good and true service / he shall
exalte them unto inestymable pain in the profounde pytte of hell / there to
remain with him perpetually.

Of them that desire for to amend the^ from day to day. ca. xxxi.
Who does ensue the ravens song
Saying I shall amend to morrow
And contynueth in it long
Is like to fall in to much sorrow
But if our lord will be his borowe
For and he ever that song sing
It shall him straight unto hell bring


WYthouten any longer delay / or cryenge cras cras / harken to my lesson
obstynate fools / the Eccle. v. p^s. xciui. Ad hebre. iii. Luce. xii.
which be hardened in malice / tarry no longer from converting you to god /
and defer it no more from day to day / for his Ire shall fall upon the
soday^ ly and send the in to the fire of hell / thou make good chere to
day / and parauenture thou shalt deye to morrow. The creator gives grace
unto him / and pardo neth his sins that is delybered for to amend his life
and make clean his conscience. Nevertheless he is so Eccle. v.
obstynate / and has his heart so hardened that he may not issue out of his
error / but yt time so short comes unto him so euylly that with great pain
can he live in stely / for he has lived all the days of his life in felycyte
/ and now to do the contrary / it is very dyffycyle to do it afternature. Be
it good or evil custom takes no new gyses. Every body says to morrow I
shall amen deem / and deo no more evil. But evil perseueraunce ensues them
by this raven that says cras / cras / I shall do better. Alas right so is it of
the fool that thinks to live as he did before. The death is at the door at
every hour / the life is short when it pleases god / for thou can not tell
poor sinner if that thou have space till to morrow for to convert the.
Convert the to day and puer. xxvii. Ouidius. Esaye. lvi. Jacobi. iiii.
purge thy sins without abiding till to morrow.: / To day we commyste so
many sins and vices / and we be their servants and can not esche we them.
and the virtues that we should honor / we dyspryse by our folly / and by the
vices that we be replete with, And if a great sin come before our eyes / and
after we think on our confession sometime / but we defer repentance and
syngeth as the raven does. And thus we lose our time / and or that we be
converted death comes and takes us / what dyspleasure / for go we must in to
the gulfre of hell / there to endure pain perpetually with all the deuylles
of hell. When one knows that he (...) hurt he would that he had done
otherwise / but at that hour he may not. O poor fool the which has dorie
no deeds Ecclesi^. x. Mathei. vi. Luce. xii. Esaye. xxii. i. corinth. xv.
meritorious / and that sees thy course renew more s^yfter than the wind /
wherefore do thou not some good operacyons in this world. if that death have
taken the and destroyed the (it is well done) / for thou would not be debonayre
in this world / nor serve god the creator. And thou the which lives yet in
this world / have not thy will so vile and so vycyous as thou haste had in
time paste / but repent the and require parton of our lord Ihesu christ /
for he is so mercyful that he will grant ^t the / if that thou require him
with a contryte heart / and tarry not till to morrow / sith that thou may do
it to day. And in so doing thou may purchase the realm of paradyse. But
and thou sing as the raven does saying cras cras. Know for certaynte that
the death prouerbio. iii
is sudden / and that thou shalt not have space for to amend the / Wherefore
thou must goo unto the infecte habytacle with all the deuylles of hell.

Of this fool sore I me meruayll
That casts water in the well

yet sometime the gardes will be all out / Who shall keep her than from doing a
mysse (thou) nay) for then truly prouerbio. xii.
she shall habandone herself / it comes of nature / and therefore thou art
worse then mad / that thinks to keep her from mysdoynge. But a wife that
will be good needs no guard. Danes was a maiden / the which Danae.
her fader did shytte up in a strong toure where no man might come to her.
Jupiter certefyed of this made it to rain / and transmued himself in to a
drop of fine gold / and as this fair maiden Danes sat at a wyndowe / this
drop of gold fell in her lap / and then incontinent Jupiter made himself
in the form of an humayne creature. And by this Jupiter the Ouidius. iiii.
methamor.
vyrgyn Danes was deflored in the toure of brass Penelopes Penelope. Homerus
in odi(...)ea. Ouidius in epist. hie.
Ulyxes wife had never copulacyon of man save with her husband / but when her
husband was in battle / she committed auoutrye in such wise that all the
country spoke of it. An evil wife has naught ado to depart from her house /
lest that she go not in to the quycke mire / but and she be commanded a
thing she will do clean the contrary. Certainly it is a vylaynous reproach
unto a woman when she will not obey unto her husband. O wives and maidens
look that ye live honestly and keep chastyte / to the end that ye win and
purchase good fame and good renown. Flee from Ecc^ia. xxvi. Seneca i^ declara.
the company of vycyous men and women / and from old baudes that ought to be
burnt in a fire / the which be so full of decepcyons for to begyle good wives
/ and good maidens. Flee the occasyons of evil report and ye shall have ever
good loos and good renown. The excellent queen Helayne had never be rauysshed
had ^elena. Ouidius. epist. hiere.
she not given credence unto the words of Paris / for she gave lightly
credence unto the deceyuable words of Paris / she had been better to have
stopped her eres than to have byelued such words. Wherefore women never abuse
you with the vain words of men / but do as the serpente does when the
enchauntour would take him / for he lays one of his eres to the earth / and
with the end of his tail he stops the other / to the end yt he here not the
enchau^tementes and charms of the enchauntoure / and on this wise he scapeth
and is not taken. Look that ye have regard unto this example wives and maidens
that desires to live well / and ye shall win you good renown.

For the man holds not his faith / nor ye woman keeps not this law / how
well that they be bound rogyder with the dyuyne bond. This notwithstanding
the great myserye of aduoutrye follows them. And that is a thing to
abhomyuable that with the wife of another they do their pleasure without

which is necessary / to the end Eccle. xxxi. Boethius de con. philo.
that thou have not a stronger sickness afterward / for the sparcle that

diverse little streams that falls in to it / so it is of sykenesse when it
begins for to regne by little streams / and for to eschew great torment
show your wound and sykenesse unto the physycyen / to the end ye ye may be
the sooner heled / for all superfluytes ben taken away by sone putting remedy
thereto. And when ye come unto the physycyen / make relacyon unto him of your
infyrmyte / how sore and anguysshous so ever it be / to the end that he may
hele thy wound / and thy great sykenes / for it should be impossible for him
for to hele the without knowy^ge of thyn infyrmyte / ye which might be the cause
of thyn own death. In like wise if that you go unto a priest for to be
confessed / and declare unto hy^ many great and abhomynable sins that thou
have committed here in this world / and tell him not all that ever thou
offended god in sith thyn infancye or chyldhode / as far as thou have
remembrance of / else thine absolucyon is of none effect / and yet thou
put thy loule in great leoperdye and danger. Also it is great shame for to
send after an expert physycyen / and then to have no volente for to do after
his counsayll and commau^ dementes / nor believe his dyscrete saynges / that

charmed finger / the which by adventure engenders evil health if that thou
give credence thereto / it is not sign that thou would be guarysshed of thy
maladye / for thou put thy life in great danger for to give credence unto
such old wytches / wherefore if ye will be heled of your infyrmytes believe
none but the expert physycyen / for if ye do otherwise ye shall be in danger
to lose both body and soul.

Of the dyspraysynge of the Joye eternal. ca. xlii.
O god how our minds is mouable
Dyshonest false and not loyal
For to dysprayse god permanable
With all the court celestyall
And set at naught his syege royal
For he is a fool nothing wise
The Joys of heaven for to dyspryse

earth / I thought for to have written no more / but a Eccle. xiiii. p^s. xli.

great turbe of fools presented them before mine eyes / and when I had
beholden them I wrote as much of them as I knew / for I could take no rest
they presed me so much for to write some what of them. These fools be replete
with all vices / but their words be full of prudence. Alas how is our nature so
frail for to desire more the worldly things / than Eccle. ii. i. iohelis. ii.
the Joys eternal. Alas if I regne a space of time / my body desires to live
ever in worldly pleasure / unto my last end / when that I must needs depart
hens / and have not observed and kept the holy commandments of our lord
Ihesu christ / nor his law that is so true I have passed my time in great
delytes and Joye with them yt was with me / without thinking that I put my
poor soul in the way to go unto the goulfre infernal Luce. vi.
in to ye flode of Acheron. O poor fools I can not have intellygence how ye
desire the mondayne Joye so much / ye walk in the way sweet and delectable /
but ye shall be trapped and taken in strong glue aspre and bitter / and he the
which shall take you is the devil of hell. Now tell me fool what
prouffyteth so much richesse / Tallius (...) senectute. Jaha^. xviii.

Even so have we our hertes which draws to mondanytees and to vices foul
and dyshonest / but god will mow the body and the soul all suddenly at such
an hour as shall like him best / for our death is right sudden. Alas now is
lost our days / our delytes and mondanytees. And the world departs from us
/ and after we shall taste bitter things. All things that has rygoure in

knows the thought of man punyssheth us / or leueth us in the world vile and
replete with sin / or sends us sudden and cruel death / against the
which none erthely creature can resyste. And thou the which will live in
delytes in offendynge god thy creatoure thou do not well Alas thou art
gretely blinded and affusked. And for all that thou have aege in this world /
yet thou know not the great immondycyte and myserye that thou art in / and
that thou leuest the Joye of heaven for to remain in the stynkynge palus vile

my folly / to the end that I may get science / and purge my conscience. He
thinks and ymagyneth if that he shall leave his gown and his folysshe hode /
but that notwithstanding he holds it always. He weneth to have made a
synguler prayer to god / the which sees him / and all that he asks is not
vttred unto him. Ever this fool prays. And his heart Mathei. xx. Marci. x.
can not tell what he demands of god. After he lets himself fall in to
the well of his own voluntary will. And then he cries murdre I drown myself
/ and that they should socoure him hastily. And when he is at the botome of the
water he prays saints and sayntesses that they would give him socoure and
have mind on him / saying. I require you send me a cord for to draw me out

say if that he might escape out of that danger / by his great folly deyeth
there for lack of socoure / and dampneth both his body and his soul.
Empedocle of evil renown suffered death by his folly / of the which thing he
had great wrong. Then if this fool cast himself in to the fire with a pyteous
cry for to kylle himself / he does a right great folly. But after that the
most danger is if that he be not casten in to the pyt of hell. He the which
casts himself in to the mountain of aethnas the which is all on a
flambynge fire / parauenture by dyscomforte / in all he has lost his wit.
He knows well that he is blind by inconstaunce / because that he has done
many merytoryous deeds / and will assaye our lord Ihesu christ. He has his
heart full of rygour for to have will to tempte the creator / for ye scripture
tells us that we should not tempte him the poor fool brenneth himself thus
/ and his sou^e gothe in to hell There is diverse fools the which follows
this baner praynge god night and day / and never did merytoryous deed / for
they did ever dysprayse him / and yet they demand of god that they might
have paradyse, prouet. xxviii. Eccle. iii. ^t. xxv.
and great rychesses / good years and plenteuous / both of whete / wine / and
other fruytes / honor in this world / and that fortune may be favorable to

atter that manner of form to desire gods folks go not to paradyse / for so

ye shall find good earth yt bears odyfferous fruit / and flower of good
doctrine. The fool that breketh his body by incessyfe labor in tyllynge of
his earth I can not put in oblyuyon. And all the other fools deyeth by their
great labor and pain in this life terryen / for they be euylly condycyoned /
and in vices take great pain. And this pain and labor renders death to them
for their guerdon. And thus god sees that the mortal men will not know him /
neither his holy and blessed saints / be they confessors or martyrs / vyrgyns
/ wives or wydowes / nor will not be of his perfyte and true servants / nor
of his well-beloved friends / but ever prospers in their voluptuous volentees /
and will not observe and keep his commandments / wherefore he sends them
maladyes / and sudden death / or mortalyte. Now well yt god almighty will and
ordeyneth that if man will not be statued / (...) he watch to live well after
the true rule of labor in all ceasons. It follows not for all that in this
world that they pass the time without doing any good deeds for all their
labourynge. For if they draw the charettes by Sapien. xix.

COme and wasshe your eyes in the water of this chapter folysshe fools

but yet ye young man is more folyssher the which weddeth an old wife for to
have her gold and silver. I say that he is a great fool that takes an old
wife for her goods / and is much to blame. They the which do so procures
all trybulacyons. For with her he shall neither have Joye / recreacyon
Juuenalis. Sapien. xiii. prouer. xix.
nor rest. He nouryssheth stryfes / and great debates / thought / pain /
anguysshe / and melancoly. And if he would accomplysshe the works of marriage /
he may not / for she is to debylyte / cold / vnpropyce / vnnaturel and
vndyscurrent for the coldness yt is in her. The husband of this old wife has
none esperaunce to have lygnage by her / for he never loved her. The man is a
very fool to make his demoraunce upon such an old wife. When he thinks
sometime upon such things / he leseth his natural wit / in cursynge himself
more than a thousand times / with the gold and the silver and ye cursed
hasarde of fortune. And when he sees his poor prouer. v. i^i. prouer. ix.
life in such dystresse / his heart is all oppressed with melancoly and
doloure. But when the unhappy man sees that it is force and that he is
constrained to have pacyence / he puts his cure to draw to him the money
of the old wyddred woman in making to her glad there. And when he has the
money / and the bag with nobles / god knows what chere he makes without
thinking on them that gadered it. And when the man has spended all / he is
more vnhappyer than he was before. if that the fool be unhappy / it is well
right / for he has wedded auaryce mother of all euylles. if he had taken a
wife that had been fair and young after his co^pleccyon / he had not fallen
in to so great an inconuenyence. It is written in ye ancient books that he
which prouer. ix.
weddeth a wife by auaryce / and not for to have lygnage / has no cure of the
honest of matrymonye / and thinks full euylly on his conscience. The union
of marriage is decayed / for under the color of good and loyal marriage is
wedded auaryce / as we se every day by experyence thorugh the world. If one
will have a Juuenalis. prouer. xvii. Eccle. x. Juuenalis. prouer. xx.
wife / and that he make her to be demanded in marriage / they will inquire of
his richesse and conuynge. And on the other side he will demand great
richesse with her for to nourysshe her with. For and her fader / and her mother
and friends have no great rychesses / he will not of her. But and she be rich
/ he demands none other thing. It is written that one were better have his
house in deserte / where as n^o mencyon should be of him / than to abide with
such wives. for they be replete with all cursydnes. And the poor fool
breketh his heart / he leseth his soul / and corrumpeth his body. He sells
his prouerbi. xxv. Eccle. xxv. Eccle. xii.
yongthe unto the old wife that weddeth her for auaryce / and has but noise
and dyscencyon in using his life thus in sin. Consider you fools what
seruytude ye put your self in when ye wedde such wives. I pray you be chaste
if that ye will live without unhappy. My friends ye which be not in that band.
put you not therein / and ye shall be well happy. Notwithstanding I defend you
not to mary / but exhort you to take a wife that ye may have progenye by / and
solace bodily and goostly and thereby to win the Joys of paradyse.

The man sh^^de not inquire of such things / for it apperteyneth not to him
for to know such things. But unto god alonely is remytted the knowledge. By
this occasyon I will write here of diverse ydyot foles / that thinks

amyable / nevertheless oftentimes they change taking shrewednes / and false

of ye women / for of their cursednes I can not hold my peace. I have loved /
and shall love also long as I live the honor of women that is virtuous / but
I shall speak against the shrewed women / in all my wrytynges. Cornelia the

noblesse and sapyence / if she be dyscrete / it is more treasour of her than
of all the richesse of the world. She does not corrumpte herself lyghtely
with vices and sins. If this woman be angrye against her husband she will
wreke it on herself. We read of the king As Eccle. xxvi.

When Hester was aduertysed Hester.

and besought him to grant her a petycyon. And he granted it her. Then she
prayed hy^ that he would revoke his sentence / ye which thing he did. And by
this mean she preserved the people from cruel death. Naball was much rich
and vassal unto king Dauyd. The which king Dauyd sent him word that he
should send unto him some of his goods And he refused it. Wherefore king

dysprayse him / and blame him / in imagining wrath against him / she will
brewe a dangerous drink for to make him be put in a dark prison / saying
that he has iniuryed ye kings person by evil report / or yt he has

O Marcia it was great pity that thou was flayne as a calfe you was abused with
the harp of Orpheus the which put them to that folly / wherthorughe thou lost
thy skin / and thy lute. By the example of him diverse fools be so obstynate
thinking themself right wise and prudente / and will usurp the other. They
se not the other in^^ryed with their obstynacyes and mockeryes / the which they
apperceyue well / nevertheless they be fools / for they thyn ke that it is
play. And if they se them purpense many frauds / and detraccyons of them /
and flateryes / they will believe that it is true. If that ye will know such
folks they have a sign of folly in their hedes. If thou haste ben rich / and
that thou haste yet thy coffres full of rychesses (doubt the not) for thou
shall have kynnes men / friends / and fellows enough. And when thy richesse is
gone / thou shalt never have friend nor kynne for the poor man has no
friends. Spend not thy goods at plays / nor at none other dysportes / be not
you modygalytees / for then will good men flee from you when thou haste
dyspended thy goods / in the which was all thy trust / richesse shall leave

other folks and has none aspecte unto their own vices ye which be so vile
and so abhomynable. They would not that other men should say half the
reproaches that they say unto them. They would be mad were it in play or
otherwise. I pray the yt thou speak not at adventure / for when the word is
departed out of the mouth / they be subjects unto the for said words / and

It behooves in every case to consider and chose a good mean / leuynge

assemble no goods. Take ensample of the solycitudes as says the wise / the
which thinks on his nourysshynge / and after think on his little children /
to the end that in the time to come they have no need. When thou art in somer
gadre thy fruytes and thy goods for to live in winter by / to the end that

thought evil ly on the time paste / and has put all in oblyuyon / and has
had their hertes so hardened in mondayne pleasures / that they sleep all the
somer in the son without gaderynge any good. And so they put their lives in
extremyte by their slothfulness / and seeks no goods. If such folk have
none other goods nor lands / they have their hertes in great thought / in
great myserye and pouerte. Or if that they have spended all by evil thinking
on their necessytees / as fools do oftentimes. And after must sell his lands
or other goods for to live by / and in the end becomes miserable. Also he
the which makes no prouysyon for goods in somer / shall have great
necessyte in winter by extreme pouerte and myserye. Wherefore I pray the take
ensample at the pysmyres yt gadereth in somer for to live in winter with. The
honey bees does so in like wise. And by this means they perysshe not for

Alas thou put the body of our savior the which is so pure and clean in to

without rest / they be replete with vycyousnes / and mondayne pleasures. They
leave etynge / drynkinge and slepynge / for they play night and day without
any rest And when they lose / they swear they stare / they blaspheme god and
all his say^tes / as if god had sollycitude of these pestyferous players. Is it
not a vile and a dyshonest thing to se the man and the wife play together at
dyce and cards / where as is rehearsed full many vycyous words / in swerynge
by all ye precious members of our lord. There is neither noble / clerk /
burgeyses / young nor old / p(...)stes / nor monks but they will play / ye
in open places and streets. They ben unclothed of prudence de iudi. c. ii. li.

and wisdom. They will not play for a little / but for to destroy the one
the other. I will not say but that a little play to men of a sort / the
which is but by manner of recreacyon / is not well done. Otherwise it is evil
done. I shall tell you the cause why after that the which I find written in
holy scripture / and in the right canon / as ye ought to understand it / for
there comes of it a thousand euylles / it adnychylleth ye knowledge / it
dymynyssheth ye substance / it destroys al fruit as well comen as vncomen /
and destroys as well ye man as the woman of soul and body. The play of dyce
is no worse of itself than the play of sabot. There is no dyfference save
only for the evil that ensues. The first point of the dyce is made in
despyte of god. The no. in. c. cleri. de vi. and ho. cl. host in su^. de ex.

that mine ass came and tormented me so / for I was sore aferde lest that he
would have done me a worse torn. It suffysed me / so that I had some little
place in the ship / where as mine ass might not come to me / and tormente me
no more. If I had endured it / slouthe would have put my members in a pyteous
estate. I am not alone / ye know well the other. It is they ye which will not
believe ye good cou^sayl of the wise men / and will not accept them / nor ensue
but loves better to live in myschefe. It is they that by Ire speak many
Irefull words withouten reason / as men out of their wit. It is they that by
great envy have their hertes ever wounded / and without cause ymagyneth noyses

They forge unhappiness within them / and shows themself the sorowfullest of

I have ordained for your doctrine. Our ship bears diverse pecunyous folks
as well young as old / to whom al vain pleasure is agreeable / in desiring
richesse / more than virtues and honor Every body flees pouerte / and will not
know it. Three things makes ye stomach full of iniquyte / that is to know /
gold / sacryfyce / and famyne / and greueth the man much to bear / and virtue
is inutyle to them. Pouerte fedeth not the house / but with all good reason /
if it be suffered swetely. He shall have honor / title of wisdom and great
virtues that honors the just men. some has been in this world rich and
puyssau^t / that be now in great pains and torments / because they
dyspraysed pouerte / and that they governed them ill as sy^geth the scripture.
The rich men have worldly pleasure / and alyau^ce with diverse folks. They be
never hated of none / but the poor man is hated of every body / and good or
evil he shall never have better. He the which seeks great rychesses / and
desires to do none other good / he sets naught by honor nor virtues /
our faith nor law is not agreeable unto him. He is a fool / for he
dysprayseth the commandments of god / he swereth by his name in vain / and
commytteth so many euylles yt it is great meruayll to here them recounted. All
his heart is dry of virtues / because that it is full of vices and sins. He
gives his money by vsurye to some poor man that he holds subgecte under

reigned in peace and union with the people. Virtues and honor was with
pouerte. All great princes and lords was replete with virtues and pouerte.
They domyned in every proving. As Curtius and his fellows that held the
Samnytes / ausonye and diverse other cytees / because that they were enclyned to
serve pouerte. They maynteyned the things publyke / and mounted up in honor
and excellence. Pouerte was cause / she was of heaven / and of the world the

publycolle thou berest honor / and is dygne of great laud / because that
thou may^teyned pouerte. O fabrycyus you art worthy to be praised / for thou
dyspraysed all the great gifts of Pyrrus. Pouerte gave the honor. I pray ye
folysshe rich man consider that pouerte has done many excellent works. As
to crown kings. To dyscerne Justyce and estat^s of realms / she has loved
doctrynes. Greece resple^dyssheth in pouerte / and all science is extracte

Socrates were great phylosophres / and excellent poets / notwithstondynge
they were poor. and desired no richesse. Richesse gave never no goods / but
has destroyed many realms. By pride is known how Rome is decayed / many men
it peryssheth. Cartage came unto ruin. It engenders all euylles. There is
nothing more excellenter / nor more sweter than pouerte. ^resus. de quo

that ledeth the soul unto hell. Tell me what auaylled the richesse unto king

Wherefore you cursed fools that dyspryseth pouerte / know yt ye shall be
banysshed and expulsed from the realm of paradyse.

They did well. But in the end they would do evil. Then for to come unto my

that thou say / I have lived well all my life / I have done always good / thyn
understanding does contrary. Thou contempneth good works. Thou do not

and makes the most vyllaynous stynke that can be thought or ymagyned / of the
which I am sore abashed that the Justyce sets not hands on them / for ye
money that they take and demand is against god and reason / and if they be

done to suffer such things / for it were enough to enfecte a hole country

of Sennacheryb that was slain of his children / for his realm / and yet none
of them reigned / for they were all banysshed out of it. Thobye taught ever his
sone in good condycyons. solomon being in his syege ryall / did great honor

destroys all good condycyons / virtues and scyences / and engenders things

persons and pryncypally in women. For all the gendre femynyne is replete with

And consider that Lucyfer the which was the fairest angel of Job. xli.

is he yt may suffer this fool / that has his mind light as wind / the
which desires ye death of another for his goods. He is a fool so to desire
his friends death but god gives the^ no power thereto / nor excepteth not their
prayers. For oftentimes we se the contrary / that they dye before their
friends. Alas is it not great furoure to the / to desire any man's death for
temporal goods. For death follows the foot for foot / and be thou never so
great at ye last you shalt be deceived. It is seen often that the sone deyeth
before his fader. It is than great fo ly to trust in the death of another man.
King Pryam for all his aege / saw all his children deye before him. Wherefore
he deyed almoost as he went. In like wise when Absolon saw the scepter of his
fader king Dauyd he desired it gretely. But all suddenly death smote him with
his darte / and he would not have thought but that he should have lived after
his fader. The deeds of death be not all ye sureste / for they be to obscure
and derke. Living folks be not so folysshe to put your trust in things
caducke and transytorye / but trust ever to live with the saints of heaven /
in Joye perdurable / and not in the things mondaynes.

abstain me from putting these folks alone / and have given them a ship for

of lords / and princes. This turbe desires frauds and ymagynacyons / for
they will flater all aboutes. And by such means the lords holds them for

extorcyoners / is the first and most ne rest the king in court / or of a

prince / of a duke / of an earl / or of a baron. They recyte many words of

/ they will conspyre frauds against them / and will report many false tales
to put them out of grace. And to the contrary they will say that a fool is
replete with wisdom / and sapyence. They say diverse words full of vanytees
of them that their masters hates. The other because they would be called good
servants gadereth the feders / and other fylthes of their masters gowns /
to the end that their service please them ye better / They would ever begyle
their masters / and under the vmbre of goodness / they commit diverse frauds
and decepcyons. And to cover their falsenes they speak amyably unto some / and
fyersly unto the other / as who say they do it for their masters prouffyte.
Such folks by flaterynge is made rich / and exalted above the other / They
be acquaynted with diverse folks thorugh their dyssymulacyons / and false

with the other they do clean the contrary. And thus by these false flaterers

the crime ensues the sin / and his pryncypall actour / by the means of the

the which followed our ship in to the hye see. These folks ben the great
regentes of the world / how well that they be indygne for to be set in so
high places / telling things not to be said. It is great folly for to harken
unto such tales / and to have the eres ever open / for the wise man has them
close / and opens them not often / for ought that is said to him For he
flees from detractours / and reportours / that is replete with false langages

sore. And after ye hurt would defend hy^ as he that has a sore fo^e / and

tongue noyeth every body / putting his friends in dyscorde / and makes
oftentimes their friend their foo. This vyse stereth the honor of men / and
gnaweth them unto the bone / and bre^neth the heart / and engenders a
thousand dolours. This vice makes judgment to be made / and makes the
innocente culpable / and oftentimes suffers bitter death. And he that is
replete with virtues / and is accused without knowing any accyon / how may ye
cause be determined egally. A man by this untrue vice accused Mardoche^ / he
had a poor reward / for he was hanged. Who that should do so at this time
should do true Justyce. Know that hell holds you for theyrs / for so god
has dampened you. The christian men that by leueth lightly / and herkeneth the

fereth pain nor favor. But keeps steadfast fotynge against every body /

holiness / and that ensued virtues / and fled vices. And for his holiness and
good life god humylyed him unto him / in praynge him to bapty sehym. He feigned
him not for to correcke Herod Antypas / because that he held the wife of
Herodiades / the which was the brother of Herod Antypas. Correcke then their
vices and sins with sweet words. And if they receive not correccyon / yet
shall you receive merit one way or other for ye repreuynge of sin / and for
correckynge. And so thy good deed shall not be lost / for worldly things hyde
not truth / for who that lets to say truth for gifts / dampneth his
soul truly.* When the doctors ben bysshoppes / or have benefyces. ye shall
not here them preche nor cry no more / for truth in them is hid / and may
not take ye pain no more. And on the other side they dare not say nothing /
lest they should lose their benefyces.

Of the dyspraysynge of his vnfortune* ca. C. iiii.
He is a fool that fortune does se
Come on him which is transmutable
And may resyst it in each degree
With sapyence incomparable
Following things prouffytable
And will not by no manner of way
Till death him take without delay
IMpeteous fools vnfortuned / the which sets naught by mysfortunes / come
and read this chapter and ye shall se what mysfortune is / every body
thinking on his affairs / and that with faith they be garnysshed to know ye
descendynge thereof / and the unstableness We se that the worldly things is not
sure / for they the which thinks to be happy here / fall incontynente, for
the fortunes ben sudden. There is no hand be it never so strong that may go
against it / there is nothing in the world but that it takes end / by ye
which I have thought in my mind of them that have no stablenes to whom
fortune is agreeable / and how well that she comes not to the socoure of their
ruin. They are always applyaunt unto her / for all that she is vnnaturell to do
good / and more pressed and ready to do evil. This fool fyndeth himself in his
house all on a fire / and his goods consumed. O thou man if thou have an
vnfortune Hiere. li. Ezech. xxvi. ff. como. l. si vt prouer. vii.
for all thy heed is well combed / and that there bread lyce or vermyne / the
prudentes say a common proverb. If there come ill / it is never alone / and by
our fault increases more. We se every day that fortune increases us / Her
deed is so grievous yt it is not worthy to be recyted / Notwithstondynge think
we not on the transmutacy ons that is contempled of many things that comes to
us. It happens oftentimes as one thinks / to the end that the man be not
without this. He does well that keeps himself from evil when he knows
how Eccle. lxiii. prouer. xxiii. Luce. vii^. Eccle si. iii. Esaye. xxiii. Job.
iiii. sapien. xiiii.
he should keep him / and does it. For to have ones foot surely / one must
look where he sets it / for oftentimes Fortune hydeth her under the foot of
the man / for even so as the man will go upon the se / she waxes and swel leth
/ wherefore he is a fool that enters in to the ship that may not sustain
the wawes / nor alytell wind / the which oftentimes peryssheth thrughe
haboundau^ce of tempeste and orage. And thus the fool receives great do^mage
diverse times thrughe his folyshnes because that he can not govern it. But the
wise man keeps him from the dangers aforesaid / in eschewynge the orages of
the se that may happen / wherefore every body that thinks to go upon the se
ought to have a sure and a strong ship / to the end that it may resyste
against the wawes and tempests. Wherefore sinners consider the vnfortunes of
this world / and amend your lives / to the end that ye be of the well
fortuned in the realm of paradyse.

Of the detraccyon of goods. ca. C. v.
The wise man that lives here well
Without fraud or detraccyon
And afterward hangs a bell
At his cattes neck by correccyon
He is a fool without dyscrecyon
So at the last for to condyscende
Unto folly and so make an end
Among you fools that adnychylleth the go des by your vndyscrecyons / come
and read in this chapter and ye shall find things prouffytable for your
souls / for the dyscrete wise / and prudente men that have had volente for to
do well / delyted them there in with all their puyssaunce / because that there
is so great a congregacyon of fools regystred in our book / the which we
have put in the great ship with four tops. We have barges rowing upon
the se of diverse nacyons / we will not write their detraccyons and renownes. We
speak of malefactors peruers and full of iniquyte to the end that they should

takes no taste in our good scryptures / wherefore you lectours I beseech you to
take the good documentes and leave the evil.

Of the immoderate turpitude of the table. capitulo. C. vi.
Now at this time we be moved
To paynt the great enormities
Of dronkerdes the which is approved
In our book offragylytees
Touching their foul commodytees

with enormities / and dyssolate at the table / insacyable in etynge and without

brethe may hold / in drinking wine and ale together. They set themself at ye
table without saying any graces / or washing their hands / save in their
soppes / and or the morsel is down they drink without remyssyon / and
swaloweth the morselles all hole for have / their trenchours is laden like
mountioyes / and their cups full of wine and ale / when they have dyned they
rise from ye table without gyuynge any thanks unto god for his goods. They be
so vile and abhomynable at the table that I have great horror for to recounte
it. For they drink till their eye^ watre / their tethe is rotten for the

/ and then they drink so excessyfly that it ouercometh their stomachs. And
drink unto their god Bacchus the one unto the other / by cups and pottes
full / enforcing themself over their natural my ghte. And thus they spyllby
excess both the body and ye soul. After that they have well dronken / they
fight like beggars / falling in the fylthe and mire like swyne / And
afterward they are syke / and have their members contamyned / the synewes
retrayed / and leseth their wits and vnderstondynges / in slepynge like
beres. O pore fools be ye not ashamed to do such enormities in a place where
as ye shall never win honor. At the table you ought to be honest / but ye be
so vyllaynous that many lerneth evil condycyons of you. It appertains not to

shame / for be it burgeyse merchant or other they put themself ever before
the platter / they drink in etynge of their potage: they consume all. And with
their vyllaynous hands they will touch the mete before the other. They will
blow their noses and without any mesure will ete their mete / and will drink
without making clean of their mouths / and then they sing with dysplayed
throtes / in making many vile sacrefyces to the god Bacchus. Then they break
pottes / glasses / platters / dysshes / and saucers / in hurly^ge them upon the
earth as men enraged and out of their natural wits / and then at drinking
time they ete that the which the servants should ete. O Sardana palus thou
have diverse companyons in the world / for we will not put all these glotons in
our work that have no form for to live honestly. How well that ye one is of
Greece / the other latyns or hebrews / each has his manner to live. The one is
fat the other is lene / after ye manner of their countrees. Some be simple /
the other gracyous and honest. Some is virtuous and wise / the other is
dronkertes and glotons. Then after that they have eten and dronken so much
that their belyes aketh they demand ye realm of paradyse. They have their
thought to superfluous to think for to go to paradyse in that manner. Alas
Ihesus thou haste made us for to drink wine and ete mete in this world. But
also thou have commanded us yt we be no glotons / and that we take our repast
moderately. Alas our bodies fumeth of haboundaunce of metes. We have trust
that by strong drinking our lives shall be prolonged / and in like wise that
the wine will make us have good blood / and also that our souls is vpholden by
the blood / for all that god says it not / but has ordained mesure / time
and hour to ete and drink / for who that is excessyfe he consumes body and
soul / and abredgeth his life. All virtues were sometime in nobleness / and in
the courts of princes. But now at this present time they be more astonyed
than gese. They are all corrumped with dronke^nes / pompes and estates full of
flateryes / they have lost the name of the ancient men / and are renowned
indiscreet men. The works of the ancient men appety teth by the holy laws
that they have written and diverse other books. And now they know nothing no
more than wild beestes / and science is governed by the pore and virtuous men
eleuate in honor / and be oftentimes preferred before the nobleness.

Of the true descrypcyon of prudent men ca. C. viii.
The wise man the which is prudent
Does much good where so ever he go
Gyuynge examples excellent
Unto them the which are in woe
Techynge them in all virtues so
That they may not in to sin fall
If that they hertly on god call


COme and here good doctrine foles yt knows not what prudence is / and ye

of Uyrgyle and of Socrates have been so autentyques that it is said that in the
universal world can none be found se^blables in science / where fore me
thinks that they were dygne for to have y^ degree for their sovereign loving.
If socrates were not so greece as Uyrgyll says in his verses. Dyuyne science
and wisdom hanged in him virtue and bounte made him refulgent. The Juge that
cares not for the chydynges Ecclesia. ^i. Sapien. ^i.

noysom to equity. He is ever in ye right way / he will not sleep on the day

time / for they vary from the great lady science. If a young courage have
sapyence by trauayll / he shall abide without having any goods. But begylers
full of frauds and malyces they will say that they have the just title of
noblenes and if they knew nothing. Alas aristides the just / and the noble

not have now the preemynence that they had in the time that dame sapyence
reigned / because of these fools that can nothing the which mocketh the wise

great auau^ tages how well that they are indygne. To whom great robberyes and
frauds is adressed. They usurp the places the which are ordained for the
wise and dyscrete men the which have better deserved it. If that Almay ne the
vyctoryous had given rewards unto every body / his renown had not ben so
much dymynysshed / and there should not have been so many fools in our ship
/ but some will not apply the holy science / nor keep the holy commandments
of god / but were folysshe vestures full of myseryes as we have written and put
in figure. The fool that will live wisely also long as he reygneth in this
world / live after the writing of Uyrgyle Know that he shall have in short
time for his good deeds rest in heaven perdurably. For to keep thy body and thy
soul / amend the to the end that thou may taste of this herb that is called

Concertacyon of virtue with voluptuosyte. ca. C. x.

Behold behold my friends all
For I am virtue that is surmysed
With voluptuosyte venyall

Read we not how Alchydes saw in dremynge two ways the which were right
dyfycyle. For all that he beheld the estates vtyle. and evil by gracyous
understanding. And then he took the better way / the most just way / and
the most surest way that he might. And for to come consequently unto my
matter that I purpose for to treat of. Uoluptuosyte as a woman full of all
worldly desires / solace Joye and all pleasures / and her aunte is of foul

it should never have end. O woman for fere that thou lose not thy soul / fle

Rome in the time that it florysshed it was honored above all them in the

when they are perfyte of true eleccyon / the holy ghost is with him / the

meddle with the eleccyon of prelates. One can not now have a benefyce without
pledynge / and thus the benefyces is occupied by force. Symonye does it not
reygne / The benefyces be they not sold. I believe yes / the which is a great
plage. In the time passed the vylagyens were wont but for to pay unto ye
emperor. xxvi pens for their heedes / but now they are so sore pylled that
it is pity for to here their clamoure. Axtaxerxers imposed first the trybutes
/ the assyryens paid them first / and then the perses / the Macedonyens /
and then ceasar constreyned the romans to pay it. There is not now neither
frenshmen nor ytalyens calabryens / nor the men of the pope but that they be
constrained for to pay that trybute and yet wors than trybute. you suffer yet
that your men of arms ete up the poor folks of ye vyllages / when you be in
any town it is horror to here the lives of your men / they be so much
abandoned to do evil / and are supported by you in all their vices / they be
habandoned vno lecherye / whether they be may dens or wives they dystroye all /
and then who has done it / my lord / or an archer of the guard / and so they
escape without punysshynge by your supportacion. They fight and kill and do
innumerable euylles / and because they be not punysshed they be wors and wors /
and their lord has none honor. Think you not upon y^ king Dauyd that for
the loving that he loved Bersabee David Bersabe Urias
wife unto Urye / was called a blodye man / and his people was punysshed for
his sin. you care not you be so replete with pride and mondanytees. you be
armed with great pompes and habytes large and superfluous / ^^u have not great
pain for to win that the which you dyspende / alas you think not. The
right by you is nothing sustained. When you make Justes and torneymentes to

the which gives ye stroke ought for to do penance. We find well in the
right civil yt one may prove his strength / otherwise not / and in such
manner he is not bounden to the law aquylye. They do the contrary which is a
wound made in right. Alas Emperors / kings / dukes / earls and barons
vulnere him no more / suffer not that right be usurped within your realms and
countrees / if that you will that your domynacyons prospere in goodness and
tranquylyte,: /

O right christian king of England I beseech the also humbly as I may that thou
suffer not within thy noble realm that right be usurped by thy subgectes and
officers. Thou art the most noble king and the most myghtyest that is upon
the earth / for thou art the relucent sterre of all the terryens / endewed
with all virtues the odeferous flower descended from paradyse most marcyall in
battle / amyable as a lady / fair as absolon wise as Solomon / dyscrete as
Agamenon / and all good meurs remains in the / wherefore yllustred king
excercyse egall judgment / and in so doing ye shall be exalted in the
sempyternall court / with the rose first stock of your generacyon. The good
king Henry loved no blasshemynge but punysshed the swerers but who that can
now most blassheme god / is most made of in court. you give evil example
unto them that comes after you / and the things of evil examples ought to
be eschewed / but you uphold them / you make diverse fair statutes / but they
endure but a while. Show thyselfe valiant in virtues / love the prouffyte and
vtylyte of the thing publyke. Think upon the au^cyent Romans the which
loved better for to deye poor / than the welthe publyke should have been
enpayred. After that is some comen yt loves better to enryche themself than
ye good publyke / whereby they are comen unto great ruin The consules and
senators of this present time have not the fame that ye ancient romans
were wont to have / for they love better their own prouffyte than the common
prouffyte / and corrumpe the right for to do pleasure unto their friends. The
cause is because they are not replete with virtues / for they are rauysshynge
wulues / without supporting or defending of the right / thou ought for to
know what right is / to the end that when they demand the some country

doing ye shall acquyre great merit of the Juge eternal the which Jugeth
every thing / and after their deserte remunereth them in the sempyternall
mansyon. Wherefore look that ye put men the which are virtuous and Just for to

right wysmen is domynatours there is egall judgment also well to the poor and
nedy as unto the rich / but at this present time it is great pity for to here
the exclamacyon of the poor people / for they can not have no right without
gyuynge of large money / and thus auaryce has banysshed right out of this
country Put no rauysshynge wulues to give judgment / nor no merchants / the
which have no desire but for to win in lettynge the welthe publyke fall in to
ruin. Juges read you never of the Jugement of Alpius the which was amerous of
a maiden that was brought unto him for to be out of seruytude / but her fader
Uyrginyus willing for to save her from dishonor / tupracyon slew her before
the Romans and bare the heed unto that Alpius. Nor in like wise of the
daughter of Lauyon that was slain. Myrre you herm and of the Jugement that
Pylate made on Ihesu christ. It is written that the love of maidens subuerteth
the Juges that do not true Justyce. Juge justly the sone of man. Such Juges
is hated of every body. A good Juge ought to enquere the (...). de aduo. l.

by you as knights is the ly^ and the patrimony defended. your office is
necessary and louable. Wherefore leave all decepcyons and false lagacyons and
maynteyne the right. Put sergeauntes of good lives in offices for to keep the
people the better / with out putting in a great sort of rascalles and
rybaudes that pylleth the poor people / and renneth night and day to ye

/ if there happen debate in any place / and that their hands be greced / they
will let the malefactors go / if they have co^myssyon to take any body / they
shall drink with him / and in payenge the scotte will let him go. But who that
put good men in office should cause diverse deceytes to be undone in citees and

they are expulsed. O de vi. and ho. c^. 33. q. vi. c. clerici and. c. qicu^que

Of them that do all things contrary. (ca. C. xvii.
He the which does the contrary

And that ever from them vary

Who lives here well of heaven is sure

in the profoundyte of our ship / now will I speak of them that do all things
contrary / and have their thoughts dysordynate / the which thing is cause of
the dystruccyon of all things. We se diverse trauersynge this se without ores /
or sail / they be without law and without order / the which in passing have
recountred some of the perils of mareswyne that is for to know / seylla
syrtes / and carybdim / in the which perils they have put them / and have been swalowed and suffered inestymable torments in these. I find these folks
fools sith their neyssaunce. Diverse have perysshed in this manner the which
have transgressed the law and the way that god has determined to things.
All things yt is in heaven / in earth and in the sea lives in keeping their
order / and keeps them strongely in vygoure / the which if they fail and
cease in their order / incontinent their virtue shall pass and fall unto naught

^e doctrine by other / you do all things contrary / and knows well enough
that you do evil / fere you not ye punycyon of god. Know you not how Lucyfer
and his fellows fell in to the abysmes of hell / because they kept none order
/ and would do the contrary. Adam in like wise because there was none order in
his case / and that he did contrary to gods commandment / fell in to
pyteous ruin. Cayn also because that he kept none order in his deeds / and
that he knew well that he did evil to s^e his brother Abel made a pyteous
end. if the eleme^tes held them not fixed in their order they should perysshe
al suddenly. Alas then ought we well to dread when that the things that have
no reason be in danger of punycyon. All things have order / certain time
and space to bear / to live / and to deye. The virtue of this ord^e is / keep
certain law and commandments ordained The little ought to observe and
obey to the greter / but at this time the contrary is done. Almoost all
things is done contrary. Wherefore but if that we keep better order we are like
to be punysshed eternally.
