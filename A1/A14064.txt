To the right honorable and my special good Lord and Master, the Lord Paget of
Beudesert. Chap. 1.
MI Lord your father loved me,
and you my lord, have proved me,
And both your loves have moved me,
to wright as here is done:
Since God has hence your father,
such flowers as I gather,
I dedicate now rather,
to you my Lord his son,
Your father was my founder,
till death became his wounder,
no subject ever sounder,
whom prince auauncement gave:
As God did here defend him,
and honor here did send him.
so will I here commend him,
as long as life I have.
His neighbors then did bliss him,
his servants now do miss him,
the poor would gladly kiss him,
alive again to be:
But God has wraught his pleasure,
and blessed him out of measure,
with heaven and earthly treasure,
so good a god is he.
His counsel had I used,
and Ceres art refused,
I need not thus have mused,
nor droope as now I do:
But I must play the farmer,
and yet no whit the warmer,
allthough I had his armer,
and other comfort to.
Aesops fable
The fox does make me mind him,
whose glory so did blind him,
till tail cut of behind him,
no fare could him content:
even so, must I be proving,
such glory I had in louinge,
of things to plough behouinge,
that makes me now repent.
Loytrers I kept so meany,
both philip hob and cheany,
that that way nothing geany,
was thought to make me thrive:
Salust.
Like Iugurth Prince of Numid,
my gold away consumid,
with losses so perfum'id,
was never none alive.
Great fines, so nere did pare me,
great rent, so much did skare me,
great charge, so long did dare me,
that made me at length cry creak:
Much more of all such fleeses,
as often I lost by pieces,
among such wiely geeses,
I list no longer speak.
Though country health long stayed me,
yet lease expiering fraied me,
and (ictus sapit) prayed me,
to seek more steady stay:
New lessons than I noted,
and some of old I coted,
least some should think I doted,
by bringing naught away.
Though Pallas has denied me,
her learned pen to guide me,
for that she daily spide me,
with country how I stood:
yet Ceres, so did bold me,
with her good lessons told me, Ceres the Goddess of husbandry.

that rudenes cannot hold me,
from doing country good.
By practice and ill speeding,
thease lessons had their breeding,
and not by hear say or reeding,
as some abroad have blown,
who, will not thus believe me,
so much the more they greiue me,
because they grutch to geiue me,
that is of right mine own.
At first for want of teaching,
at first for trifles breaching,
at first for over reaching,
and lack of taking hid:
was cause, that toil so tossed me,
that practice so much cost me,
that rashness so much lost me,
or hindered as it did.
Yet will I not despair,
through Gods good gift so fair,
through friendship, gold and prayer,
in Country again to dwell:
Where rent so shall not pain me,
but pain shall help to gain me,
and gain shall help maintain me,
new lessons mo to tell.
For City seems a wringer,
the penny for to finger,
from such as there do linger,
or for their pleasure lie:
Though country be more painful,
and not so greedy gainefull,
yet is it not so vainefull,
in following fancies eye.
I have no labor wanted,
to prune this tree I planted,
whose fruit to none is scanted,
in house nor yet in fyeld:
Which fruit to say (who haste of)
though nere so much they taste of,
yet can they make no waste of,
such fruit this tree does yield.
This tree or book thus framed,
with title already named,
I trust goes forth vnblamed,
in your good Lordships name:
As my good Lord I take you,
and never will forsake you,
so now I crave to make you,
defender of the same.
Your most humble servant Thomas Tusser.

The authors epistle to the late Lord william Paget, wherein be does discourse
of his own bringing up, and of the goodness of the said Lord his Master unto
him, and the occasion of this his book, thus set forth of his own long
practice. Chap. 2.
T Time tryth the trothe, in every thing
H How ever man, does blase his mind,
O Of works, which best way profit bring,
M Men rash to judge, seem of ten blind.
A As therefore trothe, in time shall crave:
S So let this book, just favor have.
T Take you my Lord, and Master than,
V Unless mischance mischansith me:
S Such homly gift, of me your man,
S Since more in court I may not be.
A And let your praise, won heretofore:
R Remain abroad, for ever more.
M My seruinge you, thus understand,
A And God his help and yours with all:
D Did cause good luck to take mine hand,
E Erectinge one, most like to fall.
M My serving you, I know it was,
E Enforced this to come to pass.
Since being once, at Cambridge taught,
Of court ten years I made assaye:
No music then, was left vnsaught,
Such care I had, to serve that way.
when joy began slake, then made I change,
Expulsed mirth, for music strange.
My music since, has been the plough,
Entangled with some care among,
The gain not great, the pain enough,
Has made me sing, another song.
which song, if well I may a vow,
I crave, it judged be by you.
Your servant Thomas Tusser.

To the Reader Chap. 3.
I Have been prayde
to show mine aid,
in taking pain
not for the gain,
but for good will
to show such skill
as show I could:
That husbandrye
with huswiferye,
as cock and hen
to country men,
all straungenes gone
might join in one
As lovers should.
I trust both this,
performed is,
and how that here,
it shall appear,
with judgment right
to thy delight
is brought to pass:
That such as wiue
and feign would thrive,
be plainly taught
how good from naught,
may trym be tried
and lively spyed
as in a glass.
What should I win by wrighting in,
my losses past
that ran as fast,
as running stream
from reame to reame,
that flows so swift:
For that I could
not get for goulde,
to teach me how
as this does you,
through daily gain,
the way so plain,
to come by thrift.
What is a grote
or twain to note,
once in the life
for man or wife,
to save a pound
in house or ground
each other week:
What more for health,
what more for wealth,
what needs less
run Jack, help Besse,
to stay a mys
not having this
far of to seek.
I do not crave
more thanks to have,
then given to me
al ready be,
but this is all
to such as shall
peruse this book:
That for my sake
They gently take
what ere they find
against their mind,
when he or she
shall minded be
therein to look.
And grant me now
thou reader thowe,
of terms to use
such choice to choose,
as may delight
the country wight
and knowledge bring:
For such do praise
the country phrayse,
the counttey acts
the country factes,
the country toys
before the joys
of any thing.
Nor look thowe here
that every shere,
of every verse
I thus rehearse,
may profit take,
or vantage make
by lessons such:
For here, we see
things several be,
and there, no dyke
but champion like,
and sandye soil
and clayey toil
do differ much.
This being waide
be not afraid,
to buy to prove
to read with love,
to follow some
and so to come
by practice true:
My pain is past
thowe warning have,
thexperience mine
the vantage thine,
may give the choice
to cry or rejoice,
and thus adieu.
Finis.

The Preface. Chap. 4.
WHat lokest thou herein to have,
Fine verses thy fansy to please?
Of many my betters that crave,
Look nothing but rudenes in these.
What other thing look thou then?
Grave sentences many to find?
Such poets have twenty and ten
Yea thousands contenting the mind.
what look ye (I pray you show what?)
Terms painted with rethorick fine?
Good husbandry seeks not that,
Nor is it any meaning of mine.
what look thou (speak at the last)
Good lessons for thee and thy wife?
Then keep them in memory fast,
To help as a comfort to life.
What look ye for more in my book?
Points needeful and meet to be known?
Then daily be suer to look,
To save to be suer thine own.
The commodities of Husbandry. chap. 5.
Let house have to fill her,
Let land have to till her.
No dwellers, what profits houses to stand,
what goodness, unoccupied brings the land.
No labor no bread,
No host we be dead.
No husbandry used, how soon shall we sterue,
housekeping neglected, what comfort to serve.
Ill father no gift,
No knowledge no thrift.
The father an unthrift, what hope to the son,
the ruler unskillful, how quickly undone.
The praise of Husbandry. Chap 6.
As true as thy faith,
this Riddle thus says.
I Seem but a drudge, yet I pass any king,
to such as can use me, great wealth I do bring.
Since Adam first lived, I never did die,
when Noe was a shipman, there also was I.
The earth is my storehouse, the sea my fyshponde,
what good is in either, by me it is fond,
What has any life, but I help to preserve,
what wight without me, but is ready to sterue.
In woodland, in Champion, City or town,
if long I be absent, what falls not down.
If long I be present, what goodness can want,
though things at my coming, were never so sca^t.
So many as love me, and use me aright,
with treasure and pleasure, I ritchly acquit.
Great kings I do succor, else wrong would it go,
the king of all kings, has appointed it so.
The description of husbandry. Chap. 7.
Of husband, does husbandry challenge that name
of husbandry, husband does likewise the same.
where huswife and huswifery, joins with thease:
there wealth in abundance, is gotten with ease.
The name of a husband, what is it to say,
of wife and the household, the band and the stay.
Some husbandly thriueth, that never had wife,
yet skarce a good husband, in goodness of life.
The husband is he, that to labor does fall,
the labor of him, I do husbandry call.
If thrift by that labor, be any way caught:
then is it good husbandry, else is it naught.
So household and housholdry, I do define,
for folk and the goods, that in house be of thine.
House keeping to them, as a refuge is set:
which like as it is, such report it does get.
Be house or the furniture, never so rude,
of husband and husbandry, (thus I conclude)
with huswife and huswifery, if it be good,
must pleasure together, as cosins in blood.

and teach thee shall,
to come by thrift,
to shifte with all.
Good Husbandly lessons worthy to be followed of such as will thrive. Chap. 9.
GOd sends and gives, both mouth and the meat,
and feeds us all, with his benefits great.
Serve willingly god, that so richly does geeue,
show leave to thy neighbor, and lay for to leeue.
2
True wedlock is best, for avoiding of sin,
the bed undefiled, much honor does win.
Though love be in choosing, far better then gold,
let love come with somewhat, the better to hold.
3
Where cooples agree not, is ranker and strife,
where such be together, is seldom good life.
where coopples in wedlock, do lovely agree:
there foyson remains if wisdom there be.
4
Who looks to marry, must lay to keep house,
for love may not always, be playing with douse.
If children increase, and no stay of thine own,
what afterward follows, is soon to be known.
5
Once charged with children, or likely to be,
geeue over to sudgerne, that think to thee.
Least grutching of hostis, and craving of nurse:
be costly and noisome, to thee and thy purse.
6
Good husbands that loves, good houses to keep
are oftentimes careful, when others do sleep. Thee for thrive.

To spend as they may, or to stop at the furste,
for running in danger, or fear of the wurste.
7
Go coumpt with thy coefers, when harvest is in,
which way for thy profit, to save or to win.
of tone of them both, if a sauer we smell:
house keeping is godly, where ever we dwell.
8
Son, think not thy money, purse botto^ to burn
but keep it for profit, to serve thine own turn.
a fool and his money, be soon at debate:
which after with sorrow, repents him to late.
9
Good bargain a doing, make privy but few,
in selling, refrain not abroad it to show.
in making make haste, and a way to thy pouche:
in selling no haste, if ye dare it auouche.
10
Good landlorde who fyndeth, is blessed of god,
a cumbersome landlord, is husband man's rod.
he noyeth, destroys and al to this drift,
to strip his poor tenant, of ferme and of thrift.
11
4 beggars
Once placed for profit, look never for ease
except ye beware of, such mychers as thease.
vnthriftnes, slouthfulnes, careless and rash,
that thrusts thee hedlong, to run in the lashe.
12
Thriftes officers.
Make money thy drudg, for to follow thy wark
make wisdom controller, good order thy clarke.
provision Cater, and skill to be cook:
make steward of all, pen and ink and thy book.
13
Make hunger thy sauce, as a medcen for health,
make thyrst to be buttler, as physic for wealth.
make eye to be vssher, good usage to have:
make bolt to be porter, to keep out a knave.
14
Make husbandry bailey, abroad to provide,
make huswifery daily, at home for to guide
make coefer fast locked, thy treasure to keep:
make house to be suer, the safer to sleep.
15
Make bandog thy scoutwach, to bark at a thief
make currage for life, to be captain chief.
make trapdore thy bulwark, make bell to begin:
make gunstone and arow, show who is within.
16
The credit of master, to brothel his man,
and also of mistress, to minnekin nan,
be causers of opening, a number of gappes:
that lets in mischief, and many mishapps.
17
Good husband he trudgeth, to bring in ye gains
good huswife she drudgeth refusing no pains,
though husband at home be to coumpt ye wot what
yet huswife within, is as needful as that.
18
What helps in store, to have neauer so much,
half lost by ill usage, ill huswiues and such.
so, twenty lode bushes, cut down at a clapp:
such heed may be taken, shall stop but a gapp.
19
A reachelesse servant, a mistress that skowles,
a ravening mastife, and hogs that eat fowls,
a gyddy brain master, and stroy all his knave:
brings rueling to ruwen, and thrift to her grave.
20
With some upon Sundaies, their tables do reke
and half the week after, their dinners to seek.
not often exceading, but always enough:
is husbandly fare, and the guise of the plough.
21
Each day to be feasted, what husbandry wurse,
each day for to feast, is as ill for the purse,
yet measurely feasting, with neighbors among:
shall make the beloved, and leiue the more long.
22
Things husba^dly ha^dsome, let workma^ co^triue
but build not for glory, that think to thrive.
who fondly in doing, consumes his stock:
in thend for his folly, does get but but a mock.
23
Spend none but your own, how soever ye spend
for bribing and shifting, have seldom good end.
Tithe duly and truly, with hearty good will:
that god and his blessing, may dwell with thee still.
24
Be suertie seldom, (but never for much)
for fear of purse penyles, hanging by such.
Or skarborow warning, as ill I believe,
when (Sir I arest ye) gets hold of thy sleue.
25
Use (legem pone) to pay at thy day,
but use not Oremus, for often delay.
Yet (Presta quesumus) out of a grate:
of all other collets, the lender does hate.
26
Who living but lends, and be lent to they must,
else buying and selling, might lie in the dust.
But shameless and crafty, that desperate are:
make many full honest, the worser to fare.
27
At sometime to borow, accoumpt it no shame,
if justly thou kepest, thy touch for the same.
who quick be to borrow, and slow be to pay:
their credit is naught, go they never so gay.
28
who breaks his credit, or cracketh it twice,
trust such with a suertie, if ye be wise.
Or if he be angry, for asking thy due:
once even, to him afterward, lend not a new.
29
Accoumpt it well sold, that is justly well paid,
and coumpt it well bought, that is never denayde.
But yet here is tone, here is to there does best:
for buyer and seller, for quiet and rest.
30
Leave princes affairs, vntalked upon,
and tend to such doings, as stands thee on.
In substance, although ye have never so much,
delight not in parasites, harlots and such.
31
As Intrest or vsery, plaieth the dreuel,
so, hilb ack and filbelly, byeteth as evil.
Put dyesing among them, and docking the dell,
and all thy life long, of a beggar go smell.
32
Once weekly remember, thy charges to cast,
once monthly se how, thy expenses may last.
If quarter declares, too much to be spent,
for fear of ill year, take advise of thy rent.
33
who orderly enters, his paiments in book,
may orderly find them, again if he look.
And he that entendeth, but once for to pay:
sbal find this in doing, the quietest way.
34
In dealing uprightly, this council I teach,
first reckon, then write, or to purse ye do reach.
then pay and dispatch him, as soon as ye can,
for lingering is hindrance to many a man.
35
Have waights I advise thee, for silver and gold
for some be in knavery, now adays bold.
and for to be suer, good money to pay:
receive that is current, as nere as ye may.
36
Delight not for pleasure, two houses to keep,
least charge without measure, upon thee do creep,
and Iankin and Ienykin, cosen thee so:
to make thee repent it, or year about go.
37
The stone that is rolling, can gather no moss,
who often remoueth, is sure of loss.
the rich it compels, to pay for his pride,
the poor, it undoes on every side.
38
The eye of the master, enritcheth the hutch,
the eye of the mistress, avails as much.
which eye, if it gouerns with reason and skill:
has servant and service, at pleasure and will.
39
Who seeks reuengement, of every wrong,
in quiet nor safety, continues long.
so he that of wilfulnes, tries the law:
shall strive for a coxcombe, and thrive as a dawe.
40
To hu^ters and hawkers, take heed what ye say
mild answer with courtesy, drives them away.
so, where a man's better, will open a gapp:
resist not with rudenes, for fear of mishapp.
41
A man in this world, for a churl that is known
shall hardly in quiet, keep that is his own.
where lowly and such as of courtesy smelles:
finds favor and friendship, where ever he dwells.
42
Keep truly thy Saboth, the better to speed,
keep servant fro gadding, but when it is need.
keep fyshday and fastingday, as they do fall:
what custom thou keep, let others keep all.
43
Pay wekely thy workma^, his household to feed,
pay quarterly servants, to buy as they need.
give garment to such, as deserve and no mo:
least thou and thy wife, without garment do go.
44
Beware raskabilia, slothful to work,
proloyners and filchers, that loves to lurk.
away wiih such lubbers, so loath to take pain:
that roules in expenses, but never no gain.
45
Good wife, and good children, are worthy to eat,
good servant, good laborer, earneth their meat.
good friend and good neighbor, that fellowly gest:
with heartily welcome, should have of the best.
46
The greatest preferment, that child we ca^ give
is learning and nurture, to train him to live.
which who so it wants, though left as a squire:
consumes to nothing, as block in the fire.
47
These lessons approved, if wisely ye note,
may save and auantage ye, many a grote.
which if ye can follow, occasion found,
then every lesson may save thee a pound.
An habitation enforced advisedly to be followed better late then never: made
upon these words, sit down Robin and rest thee. Cap. 10.
MY Friend if cause does wrest thee,
(ere folly has much oppressed thee)
Far from acquaintance kest thee,
where country may digest thee.
Let wood and water request thee,
In good corn soil to nest thee,
where pasture and meade may breast thee,
And helthsom air inuest thee.
Though envy shall detest thee,
Let that no whit molest thee,
thank God that so has blessed thee,
And sit down Robin and rest thee.

Let karren and barren, be shifted away,
For best is the best, what so ever ye pay.
5

25
When harvest is ended, take shipping or ride,
lyng, saltfish and herring, for lent to provide.
To buy at the first, as it comes to rode,
shall pay for thy charges thou spendest abroad.
29
Choose skilfully saltfish, not burnt at the stone,
buy such as is good, or else let it alone.
Get home that is bought, and go stack it up dry,
with pease straw between it, the safer to lie.
27
Er ever ye journey, cause servant with speed,
to compass thy barley land, where it is need.
One acre well compassed, passes some thre^:
thy barn shall at harvest, declare it to thee.
28
This lesson is learned, by ryeding about,
the prieses of vitell, the year thorough out.
Both what to be selling, and what to refrain,
and what to be buying, to bring in again.
29
Though buying and selling, does wunderful well,
to such as have skyll, how to buy and to sell.
yet chopping and changing I cannot commend,
with knave and his marrow, for fear of ill end.
30
The rich in his bargening, needs not be tought,
of buyer and seller, full far is he sought.
Yet herein consists, a part of our text:
who buyeth at first hand, at second and next.
31
At first hand he buyeth, that pays al down,
at second, that has not so much in the town.
at third hand he buyeth, that buyeth of trust:
at his hand who buyeth, shall pay for his lust.
32
As often as ye bargain, for better or wurse,
to buy it the cheaper, have thinks in thy purse.
Touch kept is commended, yet credit to keep,
is pay and dispatch him, er ever ye sleep.
33
Be mindful abroad of a Mighelmas spring
For there on dependith, a husbandly thing,
Though some have a pleasure, with hawk upon hand
Good husbands get treasure, to purchase their la^d.
34
Thy market dispatched, (...) home again round
Least gaping for penye, (...) fest a pound,
Provide for thy wife, or else look to be shent
Good m^^ch kow for winter, another for lent.
35
In traueling homeward, (...) good crones,
And fat up the bodies, of those selybones,
Leave milking and dry up, old mulle thy kowe,
The crooked and aged, to fattinge put now.
36
Some plowith, some burns, ye wheat stubble low
Some after their barelye, la^e wheat for to sow,
which ever thou mindest, now time it is best,
Or spare it for cattle, and so let it rest.
37
Some uses ye first year, a fallow to make,
The next to sow bareley, the better to take,
Next that to sow pease, and the next to sow wheat,
Then fallowe again, or to pasture for neat.
38
Two cropps and a fallow, enrichith the plough,
Though tone be of pease, it is land good enough,
One crop and a fallow, some soil will abide,
where if ye say surder, lay profet a side.
39
In Essex and Suffolk, such land I do know,
where excellent rye is, as any can grow,
In five year yet there of, a crop and away,
If more ye do take, ye were better to play.
40
Still crop upon crop, many fermers do take
And reap little profet, for gredines sake,
Though wheat upon barely, a cropper is fownde,
No cropper is pease, but a confort to grownde.
41
Er winter preuentith, while weather is good
For guttinge of pasture, get home with thy wood
And carry out grauel, to fill up a hole.
Both timber and furzen, the turfe and the cole.
42
House, charkole and sedge, chip and turf of the la^d,
Pile, tallwood and billet, stack all that has band
Block rotes, pole and bough, set upright to the thetch
The nerer, more handsome, in winter to fetch.
43
In stacking of bauen, and pieling of loggs
Make under thy bauen, a houell for hoggs,
And warmely enclose it, all saving the mouth
And that to stand open, and full to the south.
44
Get home with thy brakes, er an so^mer be gone
For teddered cattle, to sit there upon,
To coouer thy houell, to brew and to bake
To lie in the botom, where mow ye do make.
45
Thresh sede and to fanning, September does cry
get plough to the feeld, and be sowing of rye
Go harrowe the redgis, er ever ye strike,
This point of good husba^drie, Suffolk does like
46
Sow winter corn timely, to follow his lust,
sow wheat as ye may, and the rye in the dust.
Be careful of seed, or else such as ye sow,
be suer at harvest, to reap or to mow.
47
Though beans be in sowing, but skatered in,
yet wheat, rye and peason, I love not to thyu.
Sow barley and dredge, with a plentiful hand:
least wede stead of seed, ouergroweth thy land.
48
Seed husba^dly sown, water sorrow thy ground
that rain when it comes, may run away round.
Then stir about Nicholl, with arow and bow,
a penny for killing, of every Crow.
49
At Bartilmewtide, or at Sturberedge fair,
buy that as is needful, thy house to repair.
Then sell to thy profit, both butter and cheese,
who buyeth it sooner, the more he shall leese.
50
Hops gathering.
If Hops do look brownish, then are ye to slow
if longer ye suffer, those hops for to grow.
Now, sooner ye gather, more profit is found,
if weather be fair, and deaw of a ground.
51
Not break of but cut of, from hop the hop string,
leave growing a little, again for to spring.
whose hill about pared, and therewith new clad,
shall nurrish more setts, against March to be had.
52
Hop hillock discharged, of every let,
se then without breaking, each pole ye out get.
which being vntangled, above in the tops:
go carry to such, as are plucking of hops.
53
Take sout which or hayer (that couers the kell)
set like to a manger, and fastoued well.
with pole upon crotchis, as high as thy breast:
for saving and riddance, is husbandry best.
54
Hops had, the hop poles, yt are likely prezerue,
from rotting and breaking, again for to serve.
And plant ye with alders, or willows some plot,
where yearly as needs, mo poles may be got.
55
Some skilfully dries, their hops on a kell, Hops drying.

and some on a soller, often turning them well.
Kell dryde will abide, foul weather or fair,
where drying and lying, in loft do despair.
56
Some close them up dry, in a hogshed or fatt, Keeping of Hops.

yet canuas or sowtage, is better then that.
By drying and lying, they quickly be spilt,
thus much have I showed, do now as thou will.
57
Saint Mihel does bid thee, amend ye marsh wall
the breck and the crab hole, the foreland and all.
one noble in season, bestowed thereon.
may save thee a hundred, er winter be gone.
58
Now geld with the gelder, the ram and the bull,
sew ponds, amend da^mes, and sell webster thy wull.
Out fruit, go and gather, but not in the deaw,
with crab and the wall nutt, for fear of a shraew.
59
The Moon in ye wane, gather fruit for to last,
but winter fruit gather, when Mighel is past.
Though michers that love not, to buy nor to crave
make some gather sooner, else few for to have.
90
Fruit gathred to timely, will taste of the wood
will shrink and be bitter, and seldom prove good.
So fruit that is shaked, or beat of a tree:
with brusing in falling, soon fawty will be.
61
Now burn up the Bees, yt ye mind for to drive
at mydsomer drive them, and save them alive.
Place hyue in good air, set southly and warm:
and take in due season, were, honey and swarm.
62
Set hyue on a plank (not to low by the ground,
where herb with the flowers, may compass it round,
And boordes to defend it, from north and north east:
from showers and rubbish, from vermin and beast.
63
At Mighelmas safely, go stye up thy bore,
Least straying abroad, ye do se him no more.
The sooner, the better, for Hallontyde nigh:
and better he brawneth, if hard he do lie.
64
Shift stye (for ill air) as best ye do think,
and twice a day give him, fresh vytell and drynk.
and diligent Cysle, my dayry good wench:
make clenly his cabben, for measling and stench.
65
Now pluck up the hemp, and go beat out the sede
and afterward water it, as ye see need.
But not in the river, where cattle should drink,
for poisoning them, and the people with stink.
66
Hemp huswifely used, lokes cherely and bright,
and sells it self, by the color so whight.
Some uses to water it, some do it not,
be skillful in doing, for fear it does rot.
67
Wife into thy garden, and set me a plot,
with strawbery roots, of the best to be got.
Such growing abroad, among thorns in ye wood
well chosen and pyeked, prove excellent good.
68
The Barbery, respis and goosebery too,
look now to be planted, as other things do.
The goosebery, Respis and Roses al three:
with strawberies under them, trimly agree.
69
To gather some mast, it shall stand thee upon,
with servant and children, er mast be all gone,
Some left among bushes, shall pleasure thy swine:
for fear of a mischief, keep akornes fro kyne.
70
For rooting of pasture, ring hog ye had need,
which being well ringled, the better do seed.
Though young with their elders, will lightly keep best
yet spare not to ringle, both great and the rest.
71
Yoke never thy swine, while ye shacktime does last,
for diverse misfortunes, that happen to fast.
Or if ye do fancy, whole ear of the hog:
give eye to ill neighbor, and ear to his dog.
71
Keep hog I advise thee, from meadow and corn,
for out aloude crying, that ere he was borne.
Such lawles so haunting, both often and long:
if dog set him chanting, he does thee no wrong.
73
where love among neighbors, do bear any stroke
whiles shacktime endures, men use not to yoke.
yet surely ringling, is needful and good:
till frost do enuite them, to brakes in the wood.
74
Keep safely and warelie, thine uttermost fence,
with lope gap and break hedge, do seldom dispense.
Such runabout proulers, by night and by day:
se punished justly, for prouling away.
75
At noone if it blows, at night if it shine,
out trudgeth hew make shift, with hook and with line.
whiles Gillet his blouse, is a milking thy kow:
sir Hew is a rigging, thy gate or the plow.
76
Such walk with a black, or a red little cur,
that open will quickly, if any thing stur.
then skwattith the master, or trudgeth away:
and after dog runs, as fast as he may.
78
Some prouleth for fuel, and some away rig,
fat goose and the capon, duck, hen and the pig.
Some prouleth for akornes, to fat up their swine:
for corn and for apples, and all that is thine.
79
Now saw out thy timber, for boorde and for pale
to have it unshaken, and ready to sale.
Bestow it and stick it, and lay it aright,
to find it in March, for workmen in plight.
80
Save slab of thy timber, for stable and stye,
for horse and for hog, the more clenly to lie.
Save saw dust, and brick dust, and ashes so fine:
for alley to walk in, with neighbor of thine.
Octobers abstract. Chap. 13.
October good blast,
To blow the hog mast.
Forgotten month past,
do now at the last.
1
Lay dry up and round,
for barley thy ground.
2
To late does kill,
to soon is as ill.
3
Maids little and great,
pych cleene seed wheat.
Good ground does crave,
choice feed to have,
Flayles lustely thwack,
least ploughseede lack.
4
Plie sowing a pace,
in every place.
5
Soil perfectly know.
er eddish ye sow.
Seed first go fetch,
for eddish or etch.
Whight wheat if ye please
now sow upon pease.
Sow first the best,
and then the rest.
Keep Crows good son,
s^e furrowing done.
6
Sow Akornes to prove,
that timber do love.
7
Sow haestings now,
if ground it allow.
8
Learn soon to get,
a good quick set,
9
For fear of the wurst,
make fatt away furst.
10
Fat that no more,
ye keep for store.
11
Hyde karen in grave,
less noyance to have.
12
Hog measeled kill,
for slemming that will.
Sys have an eye,
to Bore in the stye.
13
Keep sloe upon bow,
for slir of thy kow.
14
With pease bolt and brake,
some brew and bake,
Frynd ringle thy hog,
for fear of a dog.
Rye straw up stack,
least thetcher lack.
Wheat straw dry save,
for cattle to have.
Wheat chafe lay up dry,
in safety to lie
Make hansome a bin,
for chafe to lie in.
Seed thresht thou shall,
thresh barley for malt.
Cut bushes to hedge,
fence meadow and redge.
Stamp crabs that may,
for rotting away.
Make vergis and perye,
sow kyrnell and berye.
Now gather up fruit,
of every suite.
Marsh wall too slight,
strength now or god night
Where soil is of sand,
quick set out of hand.
To plots not full,
add bremble and hull.
For set no bar,
while month has an R.
Like note thou shall,
for making of malt.
Brew now, to last,
till winter be past.
Octobers husbandry. Chap. 14.
NOw lay up thy barley land, dry as ye can,
when ever ye so we it, so look for it than.
Get always aforehand, be never behind:
least winter preventing, do alter thy mind.
2
Who lays up fallow, to soon or to wet,
with noyances many, does barley beset.
For weed and the water, so soeketh and sucks:
that goodness from either, it utterly plucks.
3
Green rye in September, when timely thou have,
October for wheat sowing, calls as fast.
If weather will suffer, this council I geeue:
leave sowing of wheat, before Hallomas eve.
4
Where wheat upon edish, ye mind to bestow,
let that be the first, of the wheat ye do sow.
He seems to heart it, and comfort to bring:
that geeueth it comfort, of Mihelmas spring.
5
whight wheat upon pease etch, is willi^g to grow
though best upon fallow, as many do know.
But where, how or when, ye entend to begin:
let ever the finest, be first sown in.
6
Sow Akornes ye owners, that timber do leave
sow haw and rye with them, the better to prove.
If cattle or Conney, may enter to crop:
young oak is in danger, for loesing his top.
7
who peskods delights, to have with the furst,
if now he do sow them, I think it not wurst.
the greener thy peason, and warmer the room,
More lustye the layer, more plenty they come.
8
Go plow up or delue up, advised with skill
the breadth of a redg, and in length as ye will,
where spedye quick set, for a fence ye will draw
to sow in the sede, of the bremble and hawe.
9
Through plenty of akornes, the porkling to fat,
not taken in season, may perish by that,
if rattling and swelling, get once to the throat,
thou loesist thy porkling, a crown to a grote.

Such thressher at night,

Some corn away lag,

Some steal for a jest,

AT hallontide, slawter time enterith in
and then does the husband man's, feastinge begin.
from thence unto shroftyde, kill now and tha^ some:
their, off all for howsold, the better will come.
2
Thy dredg and thy bareley, go thresh out to malt,
let malster be cunning, else lose it thou shall.
then crease of a seame, is a busshel for store,
bad else is the bareley, or huswyfe much more.
3
Some uses to winnew, some uses to fan,
some uses to cast it, so clean as they can.
for sede go and cast it, for malting not for
but get out the cockle, and then let it go.
4
Thresh bareley as yet, but as need shall require,
fresh thresshed for stooner, thy cattle desire.
and therefore that thresshing, forbear as ye may:
till candlemas cominge, for sparinge of hay.
5
Save chaff of the barely, of wheat and of rye
from feathers and foistenes, where it does lie.
which mixed with corn, being sifted of dust,
go geiue to thy cattle, when serve them ye must.
6
(For Easter, at Martilmas, hang up a beife
for stal fed and pease fed, play pickpurse the theife.
with that and the like, er an grass beife come in,
thy, olk shall look cherely, when others look thin.
7
Set garlik and beans, at S. Edmond the king,
the moon in the wane, thereon hangs a thing.
Thencrease of a pottle, well proved of some:
shall pleasure thy household, er peskod time come.
8
When rain is a let, to thy doings abroad,
set thresshers to thresshing, and lay on good lode.
Thresh clean, ye must bid them, though lesser they yarue
and loking to thrive, have an eye to thy barn.
9
Take heed to thy man, in his fury and heat,
with ploughstaffe and whipstock, for manning thy neat.
To thressher for hurting, of kow with his flayle:
or making thy hen, to play tapple up tail.
10
Some pilfering thressher, will walk with a staff,
will carry home corn, as it is in the chafe.
And some in his bottle of leather so great:
will carye home daily, both barley and wheat.
11
If houseroome will serve thee, lay stouer up dry
and every sort, by itself for to lie.
Or stack it for litter, if room be to poor:
and thatch out the residue, noying thy door.
12
Cause wekely thy thressher, to make up his flower
though sloughful and puferer, thereat do lower.
Take tubb for a season, take sack for a shift:
yet garne for grayue, is the better for thri^t.
13
All manner of straw, that is scattred in yard,
good husbandly husbands, have daily regard.
In pyt full of water, the same to bestow,
where lying to rot, thereof profit may grow.
14
Now plough up thy hedlo^d, or delue it with spade,
where otherwise profit, but little is made.
And cast it up high, upon hillocks to stand,
that winter may rot it, to compass thy land.
15
If Garden require it, now trench it ye may,
one trench not a yard, from another go lay.
which being well filled, with muck by and by:
go cover with mould, for a season to ly.
16
Foul priuies are now, to be cleansed and fyed,
let night be appointed, such baggage to hide.
which buryd in gardein, in trenches a low:
shall make very many things, better to grow.
17
The chi^ney al sooty, would now be made cleene
for fear of mischances, to oftentimes seen.
Old chimney and sootye, if fire once take,
by burning and breaking, some mischief may make.
18
when plowing is ended, and pasture not great,
then stable thy horses, and tend them with meat.
Let season be dry, when ye take them to house:
for danger of nitts, or for fear of a louse.
19
Lay compass up handsomely, round on a hill,
to walk in thy yard, at thy pleasure and will.
more compass it makes, and handsome the plot,
if horsekeper daily, forgets it not.

But charged man

December, Husbandry. Chap. 18.
1
When frost will not suffer, to dyke and to hedge
then get the a heat, with thy beetle and wedge
^nce hallomas come, and a fire in hall,
such slyuers do well, for to lie by thy wall.
2
Get grinstone and whetstone, to sharpen thy tool,
or else go and loyter, or let like a fool.
A whelebarow also, be suer to have:
at hand of thy servant, thy compass to save.
3
Geeue cattle their fodder, in plot dry and warm,
and count them for myring, or other like harm.
young coltes with thy wennels, to gether go serve:
least lurched by others, they happen to sterue.
4
The rack is commendid, for saving of dong,
so set as the old, cannot mischief the young.
In tempest (the wind) being northely or east
warm harth under hedge, is a sucker to beast.
5
The housing of cattle, while winter does hold,
is good for all such, as are feeble and old.
It saves much compass, and many a sleep:
and trymlie refreshes, the walk of thy sheep.
9
For charges so little, much quiet is won,
if strongly and handsomely, all thing be done.
but use to vntackle them, once in a day:
to rub and to lick them, to drink and to play.
7
Get trusty to tend them, not lubberly squire,
that all the day long, has his nose at the fire.
Nor trust unto children, poor cattle to feed:
but such as be able, to help at a need.
8
serve rye straw out first, the^ wheat straw and pease
then otestraw and barley, then hay if ye please.
But serve them with hay, while ye straw stouer last
then love they no straw, they had rather to fast.
9
Yokes forkes and such other, let bailey spy out,
and gather the same, as he walks about.
and after at leisure, let this be his hier,
to beath them and trim them, at home by the fire.
10
As well at ye full of the moon, as the change,
sea rages in winter, be suddenly strange.
then look to thy marshes, if dout be to fray:
for fear of (ne forte) have cattle away.
11
Both saltfish and lingfish (if any ye have,)
through shifting and drying, from rotting go save.
Least winter with moistnes, do make it relent:
and put it in hazard, er ere it be spent.
12
Broom faggot is best, to haberden on,
lay boorde upon ladder, if fagots be gone.
For breking (in turning) have very good eye,
and blame not the wind, so the weather be dry.
13
Good fruit and good plenty, does well in thy loft
then make thee an orchard, and cherish it often.
For plant or for stock, lay before hand to cast:
but set or remove it, er Christmas be past.
14
Set one for another, full forty foot wide,
to stand as he stood, is a part of his pride.
more fair, more worthy, of cost to remove,
more steady ye set it, more likely to prove.
15
To teach and vnteache, is unmeet in a skoole,
to do and undo, is the part of a fool.
then orchard or hopyard, so trimmed with cost,
shoold not through folly, be spoiled and lost.
16
Er Christmas be passed, let horse be let blood,
for many a purpos, it does them much good
the day of saint Stephan, old fathers did use
if that do mislike the some other day choose.
17
Look well to thy horses, in stable thou must,
that hay be not foislie, nor chafe full of dust,
nor stone in their prouender, fether nor clotts:
nor fed with grene peason, for breedinge of botts.
18
Some horskeper, lasshith out prouender so,
some gillian spendall, so often does go.
for hogs meat and hens meat, for that and for this:
that corn is consumed, er chapman has his.
19
If frost do continewe, take this for a law,
the strawberies look, to be couerd with straw.
laid ouerly trim, upon crotchis and bows
and after vncouerd, as weather alowes.
20
The gilleflower also, the skilful do know,
do look to be couerd, in frost and in snow:
the knot and the border, and rosemarye gaye,
do crave the like suckour, for dyeing away.
Go look to thy bees, if the hiue be to light
seith water and honey, with rosemarye dight,
which set in a dish, full of stir^^ in the hyue*
from famen and danger, ye save them alive.

A description of time and they are* Chap. 20.

For time is it self, but a time for a time*

Spring. Summer.
In spring time we rear, we do sow and we plant,

In harvest, we carry in corn and the fruit:

all quickly forgot, as a Play on a stage.
Time past is forgotten, ere men be aware,
time present is thought on, with wonderful care.
Time coming is feared, and therefore we save:
yet often ere it come, we be gone to the grave.
A description of life and riches. Chap. 21.
Who living, but daily discern it he may,
how life as a shadow, does vanish away.
And nothing to count on, so suer and just:
as suer of death, and to turn into dust.
The lands and the riches, that here we possess,
be none of our own, if a God we profess.
But lent be of him, as his talent of Gold,
which being demanded, who can it withholde.
God makes no writing, that justly does say,
how long we shall have it, a year or a day.
But leave it we must (howsoever we leeue:)
when Atrop shall pluck us from hence by the sleeue.
To death we must stoop, be we high, be we low,
but how, and how sodeinly, few be that know.
what carry we then, but a sheet to the grave:
to cover this carkas, of all that we have.
A description of house keeping. Chap. 22.
What then of this tale^t, while here we remain
but study to yield it, to God with a gain.
And that shall we do, if we do it not hyd:
but use and bestow it, as Christ does us bid.
What good to get riches, by breaking of sleep,
but (having the same) a good house for to keep.
Not only to bring, a good fame to thy door:
but also the prayer, to win of the poor.
Of al other doings, house keeping is chief,
for daily it helps, the poor with releife.
The neighbor, the stranger, and all that have need,
which causes thy doings, the better to speed.
Though hearken to this, we should ever among,
yet chiefly at Christmas, of all the year long.
Good cause of that use, may appear by the name,
though nigerly nigards, do kick at the same.
A description of Christmas. Chap. 23.
Of Christ comes Christmas, the name with ye feast,
a time full of joy, to the greatest and least.
At Christmas was Christ (our savior) borne
the world thorough sin, al together forlorn.
At Christmas the day, does begin to take length,
of Christ our faith, do begin to take strength.
As Christmas is only, a figure or trope:
so only in Christ, is the strength of our hope.
At Christmas we banquet, the rich with the poor,
who* then (but the miser) but opeith his door.
At Christmas of Christ, many Carols we sing:
and give many gifts, in the joy of that king.
At Christmas in Christ, we rejoice and be glad,
as only of whom, our comfort is had.
At Christmas we joy, altogether with mirth:
for his sake that ioyed us al, with his birth.
A description of apt time to spend. chap. 24.
LEt such (so fantastical) liking not this,
nor any thing honest, that ancient is.
Give place to the time, that so meet we do see:
appointed of God, as it seems to be.
At Christmas, good husbands have corn on ye ground
in barn and in sell^^ worth many a pound.
Things plenty in house, (beside Cattle and sheep)
al sent them (no doubt en) good houses to keep.
At Christmas, she hardness of winter does rage,
a grieper of al things, and specially age.
Then lightly poor people, the young with the old,
be sorest oppressed, with honger and cold.
At Christmas, by labor is little to get,
that wanting the pooreish in danger are set.
what season then better, of all the whole year:
thy nedy poor neighbor, to comfort and chere.
Against fantastical scruplenesse. chap. 25.
At this thing and ye thing, some make a great matter,
some help not, but hinder ye poor with their clatter.
Take custom from feasting, what comes the^ last
where one has a dinner, a hundred shall fast.
To dog in the maunger, some licken I could
that hay will eat none, nor let other that would.
some scarce in a year, give a diner or two,
nor well can abide, any other to do.
Play thou the good fellow, seek none to misdeme
hate ner that be honest, though merry they seem.
For often time seen, no more very a knave,
than he that does counterfeit, most to be grave.
Christmas husbandly fare. chap. 26.
GOod husband and huswyfe, now chiefly be glad,
things ha^dsom to have, as they ought to be had
They both do provide, against Christmas do come
to welcome their neighbor, good chere to have some
Good bread and good drink, a good fire in the hall,
brawne pudding and souse and good mustarde withal.
Biefe, mutton, and porke, shred pyes of the best,
pig, veale, goose and capon, and Turkey well dressed:
Chese, apples and nuttes, iollie Caroles to here,
as then, in the country, is counted good chere.
What cost to good husband, is any of this?
good household provision, only it is.
Of other the like, I do leave out a meny,
that costeth the husbandman, never a penny.
A Christmas Karrol of the birth of Christ, upon the tune of King Solomon.
Chap. 27.
WAs not Christ ower Savior,
sent unto us, from God above,
not for ower good behavior:
but only of his mercy and love.
if this be true, as true it is,
truly in deed:
Great thanks to God to yield for this,
then had we need.
2
This did our God for a very trothe,
to train to him, the soul of man,
and justly to perform his oath:
to Sara and to Abraham than,
that through his sede, all nations should
blessed be:
As in due time, performed he would,
al flesh should see.
3
which wondrously is brought to pass,
and in our sight al ready done,
By sending, as his promis was
(to comfort us) his only son,
eue^ Christ (I mean) that virgins child
in bethelem borne.
that lamb of God, that prophet mild,
with crowned thorn.
4
Such was his love to save us all,
from danger of the curse of God,
that we stood in by Adams fall,
and by our own deserved rod
that through his blood and holy name,
to such as beleues,
And fly from sin, and abors the same,
free mercy he geues.
5
For thease glad news, this feast does bring
to God, the Son and holy Ghost,
let man give thanks rejoice and singe.
from world to world, from cost to cost,
for all other gifts so many ways,
that God does send.
Let us in Christ, give God the praise,
while life shall end.
T. Tusser.
At Christmas be merye, and thankful withal,
and feast thy poor neighbors, ye great with ye small.
yea all the year long* to the poor let us give:
Gods blessing to follow us, whiles we do leave.

Ianuaries Husbandry. Chap. 29.
When Christmas is endid, bid feasting adue,
go play the good husband, thy stock to renew.
be mindeful of rearinge, in hope of a gain:
daine profit shall give the, reward for thy pain.
2
Who, both by his calfe, and his la^b will be known
may well kill a neat, and a sheep of his own.
and he that will rear up, a pig in his house:
has cheaper his bakon, and sweter his sowse.
3
who eatith his veale, pig and lamb being froth,
shall twyse in a weke, go to bed without broth.
unskillful, that pas not, but sell away sell:
shall neauer have plenty, where ever they dwell.
4
Be gredye in spending, and careless to save,
and shortly be nedy, and ready to crave.
be wilful to kill, and unskillful to store,
and neauer look long, to keep house any more.
5
Lay dyrt upon heaps, fayer yard to be seen,
if frost will abide it, to filde with it cleene.
in winter a fallowe, some love to bestow,
where pease for the pot, they entend for to sow.
6
In making or mending, as nedith thy ditch,
get set to quick set it, learn cunningly whitch.
in hedging (where claye is) get stake as ye know
of popeler and willowe, for fuel to grow.
7
Leau^ (...) Cunney, let do go to buck,
and ve^^^^^e thy burrow, for fear of ill luck.
Feed Dove (no more killi^g) old dove house repair
save dove doung, for ^hep^ard, when house ye make fair.
8
Dig garden, stroy mallow, now may ye arease,
and set (as a deintie) thy rantifall ^ease.
Go cut and set roses, thuse aptly the plot:
the roots of the youngest, are best to be got.
9
In tune go and bargain, least worse^ do fall,
for fuel, for making, for carriage and all.
to buy at the stub, is the best for the buyer:
more timely provision, cheaper the fire.
10
Some burns a lode, at a time in his hall,
some never leave burning, till burnt they have all.
Some making of hauock, without any wit:
make many poor souls, without fire to sit.
11
If frost do continue, this lesson does well,
for comfort of cattle, the fuel to fell
From every tree, the supersluous bows:
now prune for thy neat, thereupon to go brows.
12
In pruning and trumming, all manner of trees,
reserve to each cattle, their properly fees.
If snow do continue, sheep hardly that fare:
crave mistle and Iuye, for them for to spare.
13
Now lop for thy fuel, old pollenger grown
that hinders the corn, or the grass to be mowen.
In lopping and felling, save edder and (...)
thine hedgis as nedith, to mend or to make.
14
In loppinge old Jocha^, for fear of mishap,
one bough stay vnloyned, to cherish the sap.
the second year after, then boldly ye may:
For dripping (...) fellows, that bough cut away.
15
Lop poppler and salow, elm, maple and prye,
Well saved from cattle, till summer to lie.
so far as in lopping, there tops ye do flinge:
so far without plantinge, young copye will spring.
16
If hopyard or orchard, ye mind for to have,
for hoppoles and crotchis, in lopping go save.
which husbandly spared, may serve at a push:
and stop, by so having, two gapps with a bush.
17
From Christmas till May, be well entered in,
some cattle wex fainte, and look poorly and thin,
and chiefly, when prime grass at first does apere:
then moest is the danger, of all the whole year.
18
Take vergis and heat it, (a pint for a kow)
bay salt full a hand, to rub tongue ye wot how.
That do^ne, with the salt, let her drink of the rest:
this many tunes rayseth, the feeble up best.
19
Poor bullock with browsing, and naughtely fed,
skarse feedith, her teeth be so lose in her head.
then slyse ye the tail, where ye feel it so soft:
with soote and with garelyck, bound to it a loft.
20
By bre^^bles and bushes, in pasture to full,
poor sheep be in danger, and loses their wull.
Now therefore thine eawe, upon la^ming so near:
desires in pasture, that all may be clear.
21
Leave grubbing or pulli^g, of bushes (my son)
till timely thy fenses, require to be done.
then take of the best, for to furnish thy turn,
and home with the rest, for the fire to burn.
22
In every green, if the fence be not thine,
now stub up the bushes, the grass to be fine.
Least neighbor do daily, so hack them beliue:
that neither thy bushes, nor pasture can thrive.
23
In ridding of pasture, with turues so bye,
fill every hole up, as close as a dye.
The labor is little, the profit is gaye:
what ever, the loytering laborers say.
24
The sticks and the stones, go and gather up cleene,
for hurting of sieth, or for harming of green.
For fear of Hew prouler, get home with the rest,
when frost is at hardist, then carrige is best.
25
yo^g brom or good pasture, thy ewes do require
warm barth and in safety, their lambs do desire.
look often well to them, for foxes and dogs:
for pitts and for brembles, for ve^^in and hogs.
26
More deintie yt la^b, the more worth to be sold,
the sooner the better, for eawe that is old.
But if ye do mind, to have milk of the dame:
till May do not sea^er, the lamb fro the same.
27
Eaws yearly by twining, rich masters do make
the lamb of such twynners, for breeders go take.
For twinlings be twiggers, increase for to bring:
though some for their twigging, peccante^ may sing
28
Calves likely, yt come between Christmas and le^t,
take huswife to rere, or else after repent.
Of such as do fall, between change and the prime:
no rering, but sell, or go kill them in time.
29
House calfe, and go sockle it twice in a day,
and after a while, set it water and hay.
Stake ragged to rub on, no such as will bend:
then weane it well tended, at fifty days end.
30
The senior weaned, his younger shall teach,
both how to drink water, and hay for to reach.
More stroeken and made of when ought it do aile
more gentle ye make it, for yoke or the paile.
31
Geld bull calfe, and ramlamb, as soon as they fall,
for therein is lightly, no danger at all.
Some spares the ton, for to pleasure the eye:
to have him show greater, when butcher shall buy.
32
Soowes ready to farrow, this time of ye year,
are for to be made of, and counted full dear.
For now is the loss of a fare of the soow:
more great the^ the loss, of two calves of thy koow
33
Of on^ sow together, rere few above five,
and those of the fairest, and likest to thrive.
Vngelt of the best, keep a coople for store:
one bore pig and sow pyg, that sucketh before.
34
Who has a desire, to have store very large,
at whysontide, let him geeue huswife a charge.
To rere of a sow at once, only but three:
and one of them also, a boar let it be.
35
Geld under the damme, wtin sortnight at least,
and save both thy money. and life of the beast.
Geld later with gelders, as many one do:
and look of a dozen, to geld away two.
36
Thy coltes for the saddle, geld young to be light,
for cart do not so, if thou iudgest aright.
Nor geld not, but when they be lusty and fat:
for there is a point, to be learned in that.
37
Geld fillies (but titts) er an ix. days of age,
they die else of gelding, or gelders do rage.
young fillies so likely, of bulk and of bone:
keep such to be breeders, let gelding alone.
38
For gayning a trifle, sell never thy store,
what joy to acquaintance, what pleasureth more.
the larger of body, the better for breed:
more forward of growing, the better they speed.
39
Good milchkow well fed, that is faier and sound,
is yearly for profit, as good as a pound.
and yet by the year, have I proved er now:
as good to the purse, is a sow as a kow.
40
Keep one and keep both, with as little a cost,
then all shall be saved, and nothing be lost.
Both having to gether, what profit is caught:
good huswiues (I warrant ye) need not be taught.
41
Thy garden plot lately, well trenched and muckt:
would now be twyfalowd, ye mallows out plucked
well cleansed and purged, of root and of stone:
that faut therein afterward, found may be none.
42
Remember thy hop yard, if season be dry,
now dig it and weed it, and so let it lie.
More fenny the layer, the better his lust:
most apt to bear hops, when it crumbles like dust.
43
To arbor begun, and quick setted about,
no poeling nor waddling, till set be far out.
For Rotten and aged, may stand for a sheaw:
but hold to their tackling, they cannot but feaw.
44
In Ianiuere, husband that poucheth ye grotes
will break up his lay, or be sowing of otes.
Otes sown in Ianiuere, lay by thy wheat:
in May, by thy hay, for thy cattle to eat.
45
Let servant be ready, with mattock in hand,
to stubb out the bushes, that noyeth the land.
And cumbersome roots, so annoying the plough
turn upward their arses, with sorrow enough.
Who breaks up timely, his fallow or lay,
sets forward his husbandry, many away.
this tilth in a tilture, well forward does bring:
not only thy tillage, but all other thing.
47
Some breaking up lay, sows otes to begin,
to suck out the moisture, so sower therein.
yet otes with her sucking, a peeler is found:
and ill to the master, and worse to some ground.
48
Land arable dreuen, or worn to the proof,
and craves some rest, for thy profits behoof.
with otes ye may sow it, the sooner to grass:
and so to good profit, to bring it to pass.

Feed highly thy swan,

Nest high I advise,

8
Land medowe spare,

9
Poor cattle crave,

Go strike at the noewles,

Such hillocks in vain,
lay leueled plain.
Trench meadow and redge,

To plots not full,
ad bremble and hull.
Poor Cunney so bagged
is soon over lagged.
Plash borow set clapper,

Good flight who loves,

Bid hawking adewe,
cast hawke into mewe.
Keep sheep out of briers,
keep beast out of miers.
Keep lambs from fox,
else sheapard go box.
Good neighbor mine,
now yoke thy swine.
Now every day,
set hops ye may.
Now set for the pot,
best herbs to be got.
For slowers go set,
all sorts ye can get.
As winter does prove,
so may ye remove.
For all the year,
now all thing rere,
Watch ponds go look,
to weeles and hook.
Knaves never repent,
to steal in lent.
All fish they get,
that comes to net.
Februaries Husbandry. Chap. 31.
NOw timely for lent stuff, thy money disburse,
the longer ye tarry, for profit the wurse.
if one penye vantage, be there in to save:
of costeman or Flemming, be sure it to have.
Go plow in the stubble, take timely this season,
be soweing of fitchis, of beans and of peason.
Now, sooner ye sow them, the sooner they coom:
and better for how sold, they fill up a room.
3
Go harrow the peason, ye buried so deep,
least clod do compel them, for ever to sleep,
or thystles so meaney (that cumbersom wede.)
where clay has the mastrie, come up in their stead
4
Styck plenty of boows, among runcifall pease,
to climber there on, and to branch at their ease.
so doing more tender, and greater they wex,
if peacocke and turkey, leave iobbing their becks.
5
Now sow and go harow (where redge ye did draw)
the sede of the bremble, with kurnel and hawe.
which covered ouerlye, soon to shut out:
go se it be diched, and fensed about.
6
Where banks be amended, and newly up cast,
sow mustard seed, after a shower be past.
where plots full a netles, be noysom to eye:
sow thereupon hempseede, and nettles will dye.
7
The vines and the osiers, cut and go set,
if grape be unpleasant, a better go get.
Feed swan, and go make her up, strongly a nest:
for fear of a floode, good and high is the best.
8
Land meadow, that yearly is spared for hay,
now fence it and spare it, and dong it ye may.
get mouleketcher, conningly mowle for to kill:
and harow and cast abroad, every hill.
9
Friend, always let this, be a part of thy care,
for shift of good pasture, lay pasture to spare.
so have ye good feeding, in bushets and leaze:
and quickly safe finedinge, of cattle at ease.
10
where cattle may run about, roeuing at will,
from pasture to pasture, pore bellye to fill.
there pasture and cattle, both hungry and bare:
for want of good husbandrye, worser do fare.

Sharp knife to cut,

Sow even the land,

Sow over and under,
in clay is no wonder.
13
Straight follow ye plough,
and harrow enough.
With sling or bow,
go skare away crow.
14
Roll after a deawe,

More handsome to make it,

15
Learn here ye may,

16
Make ready a plot,

17
Best searching minds,

For summer sow now,

21
To set or sow,
learn time to know.
22

vnyoked hog.
Wish doves good luck,
hen, goose, and duck.
To spare a right,
spare March his flight.
Save chickins poor buttocks,
from pie, crow and puttocks.
Some love now best,

Marches Husbandry. Chap. 33.
VVhight peason both good, for the pot and the purse
by sowing to timely, prove often the wurse.
because they be tender, and hates the cold:
prove March er ye sow them, for being to bold.
2
Spare medowe at Gregory, marshes at Pask,
for fear of dry summer, no longer time ask.
Then hedge them and ditch them, bestow thero^ pe^ce,
for meadow and pasture, crave ever good fence.
3
Of Mastiues and mungrils, that many we see,
a number of thouzands, to many there be.
watch therefore in lent, to thy sheep go and look:
for dogs will have vitels, by hook or by croke.
The manner of setting of hops.
4
In March at the furdest, dry season or wet,
hop roots so well choesen, let skillful go set.
The goeler and younger, the better I love:
well gutted and pared, the better they prove.
5
Some lays the^ croswise, along in the ground,
as high as thy knee, they do cover up round.
Some prick up a stick, in the midds of the same:
that little round hillock, the better to frame.
Some makes a hollownes, half a foot deep,
with four sets in it, set slant wise a steep.
one foot from another, in order to lie:
and thereon a hillock, as round as a pie.
7
Five foot from another, each hillock would stand,
as straight, as a leaueled line with the hand.
Let every hillock, be four foot wide:
the better to come to, on every side.
8
By willowes yt grows, thy hop yard with out,
and also by hedges, thy meadows about.
Good hop has a pleasure, to clime and to spread:
if son may have passage, to comfort her head.
9
Get crow made of Iron, deep hole for to make,
Hopfooles.
with cross overthwart it, as sharp as a stake.
A hone and a parer, like sole of a boot:
to pare away grass, and to raise up the root.
10
In March is good graffing, yt skilful do know,
so long as the wind, in the east do not blow.
From moon being changed, till past be the prime:
for graffing and cropping, is very good time.
11
Things graffed or planted, the greatest and least,
defend against tempest, the bird and the beast.
Defended shall prosper, the the other is lost:
the thing with the labor, the time and the cost.
12
Sow bareley in March, and in April and May,
the later in sand, and the sooner in claye.
What worser for barley, then wetnes and cold:
what better with skilful, then time to be bold.
13
Let barley be harrowed, finely as dust,
and workmanly trench it, and fence it ye must.
This season well plied, set sowinge an end,
and praise and pray God, a good haruist to send.
14
Some roewlith their barley, straight after a rain
when first it aperith, to leauel it plain,
the bareley so used, the better does grow:
and hamsome ye make it, at haruist to mow,
15
Otes, bareley and pease, harow after ye sow,
for rye harow first, as already ye know.
leave wheat little clod, or to coouer the head:
that after a frost, it may out and go spread.
16
In March, May and April, from morning to night
in soweing and setting, good huswiues delight.
to have in a garden, or other like plot:
to trim up their house, and to furnish their pot.
17
The nature of flowers, dame physic does sheaw
she teachith them, all to be known to a feawe.
to set or to sow, or else fowne, to remove:
how that should be practiced, learn if ye love.
18
Land falling or lyeng, full South or south west,
for profit by tillage, is lightly the best.
so garden, and orchard, and hopyard I find:
that want the like benefit, grow out a kind.
19
If filled to bearne corn, a good tillage does crave
what think ye of garden, what garden would have.
in filde without cost, be assured of weeds:

At spring (for ye summer) sow garden ye shall,
at harvest (for winter,) or sow not at all.

21
Time fayer, to sow or to gather be bold,
but set or remove, when the weather is cold,
cut al thing or gather, the moon in the wane:
but sow in increasing, or give it his bane.

New set do ask watring, with pot or with dish
new sown do not so, if ye do as I wish.

Good peason, and leekes, to make porredge in lent

Aprills Husbandry. chap. 35.
GEt in to thy hopyard, with plenty of poeles,

2
Sell bark to the Tanner, er timber ye fell,

In breaking, save crooked, ^or mill and for ships:
and ever in heawing, save carpenters chipps.
3
First see it well fensed, or heawers begin,
then se it well staddled, without and within.
thus being preserved, and husbandly done:
shall sooner raise profit, to thee or thy son.
4
Leave growing for staddles, the likeist and best,
though seller and buyer, dispatcheth the rest.
In bushet, in hedgerowe, in grove and in wood:
this lesson observed, is needful and good.
5
Save elm, ash and crabtre, for cart and for plough,
save step for a style, of the crotch of the bough.
Save hazell for forkes, save sallow for rake:
save huluer and thorn, there of flayle for to make.
6
Make riddance of carryge, er year go about,
for spoiling of plant, that is newely come out.
To carter (with oxen) this message I bring:
leave oxen abroad, for annoying the spring.
7
From April beginning, til Andrew be past,
so long with good huswife, her dayry does last.
Good beast and good pasture, good husbands provide
ye resdue, good huswiues, know best how to guide
8
Ill huswife unskillful, to make her own cheese,
through trusting of others, have this for her ^eese.
Her milk pan and cream pot, so slabberd and soft:
that butter is wanting, and cheese is half lost.
9
Where some of a kow, do raise yearly a pound,
with such sely huswiues, no deny is found.
Then dayry maid (Cisle) her faut being known:
away apace trudgeth, with more then her own.
10
Then neighbor for gods sake, if any you see,
good servant for dayry house, wayne her to me.
Such master such man, and such mistress such maid:
such husband and huswife, such house is arayde.
A lesson for dayrie maid Cysley of ten Toppins gests.
As wife that will,
good husband please,
must shonne with skill
such gests as thease:
So Cysse that serves
must mark this note,
what fault deserves
a brushed rote.
Gehezy Lots huswife, and Argusses eyes,
Tom Pyeper, poor Cobbler and Lazarus thyes.
Rough Esaw and Mawdlin, with gentles that skrall,
with Bishop that turns, and burns up all.
Thease toppingly gests, be in number but ten,
as welcome in dayry, as bears among men.
which being descryed, take heed of you shall,
for danger of after claps, after that fall.
Whight and dry.
Gehezy, his sickness was whightish and dry,
such cheeses good Cisley, ye floted to nie.
To salt.
Leave Lot with her pillar, (good Cisley) alone,
much saltnes in whitemeat, is ill for the stone.
3
Full of eyes
If cheeses in dayrie, have Argusses eyes,
tell Cisley the fault, in her huswiferie lies.
4
Houen
Tom Pyeper, has houen and puffed up cheeks,
if cheese be so houen, make Cis to seek creekes.
5
Tough
Poor Cobbler he toggeth his leatherly trash,
if cheese abide togging, at Cisley a crash.
6
full of spots
If Lazer so loathsome, in cheese he espied,
let bays amend Cisley, or set her aside.
7
full of hears
Rough Esaw was hearie, from top to the foot,
if cheese so appears, call Cisley a slut.
8
full of whay
As Mawdelin wept, so would Cisley be dressed,
for whay in her cheeses, not half enough pressed.
9
If gentills be skrauling, call magget the pie,
full of ge^tils
if cheeses have gentills, at Cis by and by.
10
Burnt to the pan
Bless Cisley (good mistress) yt bishop does banne
for burning the milk of her cheese to the pan.
Amend so often beaten,
for doing amiss,
I will no more threaten:
I promis thee Cysse.
Tus dayrie maid Cisley, rehearsed ye see.
what fautes with il huswife, in dairie house be.
Of market abhorred, to household a grief:
to master and mistres, as ill as a thief.

11
For corn here reed,

12
Who weding slackith,

13
Sow buck or branck,

14
Sow hemp and flax,

15
Teach hop to clime,

16
Through fowls and wedes,

Superfluous hop.

Mayes Husbandry. Chap. 37.
AT Phillip and Jacob, away with the lambs,
that think to have, any milk of their da^mes.
At Lammas leave (...), for fea^e of a thing:
least (requiem eternam) in winter they sing.
2
To milk and to ^olde them, is much to require,
except ye have pasture, to fill their desire.
yet many by making (such heed they do take)
not hurting their bodies, much profit to make.
3
Five Eawes to a kow, make a proof by a shore,
shall double thy dairie, else trust me no more.
yet may a good huswife, that knows the skill:
have mixed or unmixed, at her pleasure and will.
4
If sheep or thy lamb, fall a wrigling with tail,
go by and by search it, whiles help may prevail.
That barberlye handled, I dare thee assure:
cast dust in his arse, thou have finished thy cure.
5
Where houses be reeded (as houses have need)
now pare of the moss, and go beat in the reed.
The iuster ye drive it, the smoother and plain:
more handsome ye make it, to shut of the rain.
6
From May till October, leave cropping for why
in woodsere, what ever thou croppist will die.
where Iuye embraseth, the tree very sore:
kill Iuye, or tree else, will addle no more.
7
Keep thresshing for thressher, til May be come in
to have to be suer, fresh chaff in the binne.
and somewhat to skamble, for hog and for hen:
and work when it rayneth, for loytering men.
8
Be suer of hay, and of prouender some,
for laboring cattle, till pasture be come.
And if ye do mind, to have nothing to stern:
have one thing or other, for all thing to serve.
9
Ground compassed well, and a following year,
(if wheat or thy barley, to rank does appear)
Now eat it with sheep, or else mow it ye may:
for ledging and so, to the birds for a pray.
10
In May get a wede hoke, a crotch and a glove.
and wede out such wedes, as the corn do not love
For weding of winter corn, now it is best:
but June is the better for weding the rest.
11
Ill weeds.
the May wede does burn, and ye thistle does freate
the fytches pull downward, both rye and the wheat.
The brake and the cockle, be noisome to much:
yet like unto boddie, no weed there is such.
12
Slack never thy wedi^g for derth nor for cheap
the corn shall reward it, er ever ye reap.
and specially where ye do trust to for seed:
let that be well weeded, the ve^^^er to speed.
13
In May is good soweing, thy buck or thy bra^k
that black is as peper, and smells so rank.
It is to thy land, as a comfort or muck:
and al thing it makes, as fat as a bu^k.
14
Good flax and good he^p, for to have of her own,
in May, a good huswife will see it be sown.
And afterward trim it, to serve at a need:
the ^ymble to spinne, and the karse for her seed.
15
Get in to thy hop yard, for now it is time,
to teach Roben hop, on his pole how to clyme.
To follow the Sun, as his property is:
and weed him and trim him, if ought go amiss.
16
Grass, thistle and mustard seed, hemblock and bur,
tine, mallows and nettles, that keep such a stur,
with pecock and turkye, that nibbles of top:
are very ill neighbors, to seely poor hop.
17
From wheat go and rake out, the titters or tine,
if ear be not forth, it will rise again fine.
use now in thy rye, little raking or none:
break tine from his root, and so let it alone.
18
Ba^ks newly quicksettid, some weding do crave,
the kindlyer nurrishment, there by to have.
then after a shower, to weding a snatch:
more easelye wede, with the root to dispatch.
19
The Fen and the quamere, so marrish be kind,
and are to be drayned, now win to thy mind.
which yearly vndrayned, and suffered uncut:
annoyeth the meddowes, that there on do but.
20
Take heed to thy bees, yt are ready to swarm
the loss there of now, is a ^r^unes worth of harm
let skillful be ready, and diligence seen:
least being to careless, thou loesist thy been.
21
In May at ye furdist, twy fallow thy land,
much ^^owt may else after, cause plough for to stand
this tilth being done, ye have passed the wurst:
then after who plowith, plow thou with the furst.
22
Twye fallow once endid, get tumbrell and man,
and compass that fallowe, as soon as ye can.
Let skillfull bestow it, where need is upon:
more profit the sooner, to follow there on.
23
Hyde hedlonds with muck, if ye will to the knees,
so dripped and shadowd, with busshes and trees.
bare plotts full of galls, if ye plow overthwart,
and compass it then, is a husbandly part.
24
Let children be hyered, to lay to their bones,
from fallow as nedith, to gather up stones.
what wisdom, for profit aduisith unto:
that husband and huswife, must willingly do.
25
to grass with thy calves, in some meadow plot nere
where neither their moothers, may see the^ nor here
where water is plentye, and barth to set warm:
and look well unto them, for taking of harm.
26
Pinch never thy wennels, of water or meat,
if ever ye hope, for to see them good neat.
in summer tune daily, in winter in frost:
if cattle lack drink, they be utterly lost.
27
for coveting much, over lay not thy ground,
and then shall thy cattle, be lusty and sound.
but pinch them of pasture, while summer does last,
and lift at their tails, er an winter be past.
28
Get home with thy fuel, made ready to fet,
the sooner, the easier, caridg to get.
or otherwise linger, the carridge there on:
till (where as ye left it) a quarter be gone.
29
His fyering in summer, let citezen buy,
least buynge in winter, make purse for to cry.
For carman and collier, harps on a stringe.
in winter they cast, to be with the to bring.
30
From May till mid August, an hour or two,
let patch sleep a snatch, how someuer ye do.
though sleaping one hour, refreshith his song:
yet trust not hob growthed, for sleaping to long.
31
The knowledge of stilling, is one preaty feate,
the waters be wholesome, the chargis not great.
what timely thou gettist, while summer does last:
think winter will help the, to spend it as fast.
32
Fine hazel desyrith, it may be her lot,
to grow as the geliflower, trim in a pot.
that ladies and gentles, for whom she does serve:
may help her as nedith, pure life to prezerue.

Of hops more read,

Iunes husbandry. Chap. 39,
Wash sheep (for the better) where water does ru^
and let him go clenly, and dry in the sun.
then share him and spare not, at two days an end:
the sooner the better, his corpse will amend.
2
Reward not thy sheep (when ye take of his cote)
with twitchis and patchis, as broad as a grote.
let no such ungentleness, happen to thine:
least fly with her gentiles, do make it to pine.
3
Let lambs go vnclipped, till June be half worn,
the better their fleeses, will grow to be shorn.
the Pie will discharge thee, for pulling the rest:
the lighter the sheep is, then seedeth it best.
4
If meadow be forward, be moweing of some,
but mow as the makers, may well over come.
take heed to the weather, the wind and the sky:
if danger approaches, then cock apace cry.
5
Plough early till ten a clock, then to shy hay,
in plowing and carting, so profit ye may.
by little and little, was doing ye win:
that plough shall not hinder, when harvest to^es in.
6
Provide of thine own, to have all thing at hand,
least work and the workman, unoccupied stand.
Love seldom to borow, that think to save:
for he that once lends, twice looks to have.
7
To borow to day, and to morrow to mysse,
to lender and borrower, noyance it is.
then have of thine own, with out lending vnspilt:
or borowe with sorrow, as long as thou will.
8
Let Cart be well searched, without and within,
well clowted and greased, er hay^ ^ime begin.
Thy hay being carrid, though carter had sworn:
carts bottom well boerded, is saving of corn.
9
Good husbands yt lay, to save, althing upright,
for tumbrells and cart, have a shed ready dight.
where under the hog, may in winter lie warm,
to stand so enclosed, as wind do no harm.
10
So likewise a houell, will serve for a room,
to stack on thy peason, when harvest shall coom.
and serve thee in winter, more over then that:
to shut up the porklings, thou mindest to fat.
11
What husbandly husbands, except they be fools
but ha^dsom have store house, for trinkets and tools.
And all in good order, fast locked to lie:
what ever is needful, to find by and by.
12
Thy houses and barnes, would be looked upon,
and all thing amended, er harvest come on.
Things thus set in order, in quiet and rest:
shall further thy harvest, and pleasure thee best.
13
The bushes and thorn, with the shrubbs that do noy
in woodsere or summer, cut down to destroy.
But whereas decay, to the tree ye will none:
for danger in woodsere, let hacking alone.
14
At midsommer, down with the brimbles and brakes
and after, abroad with thy forkes and thy rakes.
set mowers a moweing, where meadow is grown
the longer (now standing) the wurse to be mowen.
15
Now down with ye grass, upon hedlo^ds about,
that grows in shadow, so rank and so stout.
But grass upon hedlond, of barley and pease:
when harvest is ended, go mow if ye please.
16
Such muddy deep dieches, and pitts in ye field,
that all a dry summer, no water will yield.
By fieing and casting, that mudde upon heaps:
commodities many, the husband man reapes.
A lesson where and when to plant good hopyarde.
17
whom fansy persuades, among other cropps,
to have for his spending, sufficient of hops.
must willingly follow, of choises to choose:
such lessons approved, as skilful do use.
18
Ground, gravely, sandy, and mixed with clay*
is naughty for hops, any manner of way.
Or if it be mingled, with rubbish and stone:
for drienes and barrennes, let it alone.
19
Choose soil for the hop, of the rottenest moulde,
well dounged and wrought, as a garden plot should
not far fro the water (but not overflowed)
this lesson well noeted, is meet to be known.
20
The Su^ne in the South, or else southly and west,
is joy to the hop, as a welcomed gest.
But wind in the north, or else northely and east:
to hop is as ill, as a fraye in a feast.
21
Meet plot for a hopyard, once found as is told
make thereof account, as of Jewel of gold.
Now dig it, and leave it the Sun for to burn:
and afterward fence it, to serve for that turn.
22
The hop for his profit, I thus do exalt,
it strengthens drink, and it favors malt.
And being well brewed, long kept it will last:
and drawing abide, if ye draw not to fast.

if houel ye lack.
And cover it straight,
from doves that weight.
20
Let gleaners gleane,
the poor I mean.
Which ever ye sow,
that first eat low.
The other forbear,
for rowen to spare.
21
Come home lord singing,
come cart, corn bringing.
Be merry in hall,
Let be^des wag all.
22
Once had thy desire,
pay workman his hire.
Let none be begilde,
man, woman nor child.

Thank God so ye shall,
and adue for all.
August husbandry. Chap. 43.
Thry fallow once endid, go stryke by and by,
both wheat land, and bareley, and so let it ly:
and as ye have leysor, go compass the same:
when up ye do lay it, more fertful to frame.
2
Get down with thy brakes, er an showers do com
that cattle the better, may pasture have some.
In June and in August, as well does appear:
is best to mow brakes, of al times in the year.
3
Pare saffron, between the two S. Mary days,
or set or go shift it, that know the ways.
What year shall I do it, (more profit to yield?)
the fowerth in garden, the third in the field,
4
In having but forty foot, cunningly dight,
take saffron enough, for a lord and a knight.
All winter time after, as practice does teach:
what plot have ye better, for linen to bleache.
5
Corn harvest
Make suer of reapers, get harvest in hand,
the corn that is ripe, do but shed as it stand.
Be thankful to God, for his benefits sent:
and willing to save it, with earnest intent.
6
To let out thy harvest, by great or by day,
let this by experience, lead thee away.
By great will deceive thee, with lingering it out:
by day will dispatch, and put all out of dout.
7
Grant harvest lord more, by a penny or two,
to call on his fellows, the better to do.
Give glooues to thy reapers, a larges to cry:
and daily to loyterers, have a good eye.
8
Good harvest points.
Reap well, scatter not, gather clean yt is shorn
bind fast, shock apace, have an eye to thy corn.
Lode safe carry home, follow time being fair:
gone just, in the barn it is out of despair.
9
Corn tythed (Sir parson) together go get,
and cause it on stocks, to be by and by set.
Not leaving it skattering, abroad on the ground:
nor long in the field, but away with it round.
10
To cart gap and barn, set a guide to look we will,
and hoy out (sir carter) the hog fro the wheel.
Least gredy of feeding, in following cart:
it noyeth or perishes, spite of thy heart.
11
The moweing of barley, if barley do stand,
is cheapest and best, for to ryd out a hand. Mowing of bareley.

Some mow it and rake it, and sets it on cocks:
some mow it and binds it, and sets it on shocks,
12
Of barley the longest, and grenest ye find,
leave standing by dalops, till time ye do bind.
Then early in morning (while deawe is thereon)
to making of bands, till the deaw be all gone.
14
One spreads those bands, so in order to lie,
as barley (in swathes,) may fill it thereby.
which gathered up, with the rake and the hand:
the follower after him, binds in band.
14
Where barley is raked, (if dealing be true)
the tenth of such raeking, to person is due.
where scattring of barley, is seen to be much:
there custom nor conscience, tyething should grutch.
15
Corn being had down, any way ye allow,
should wither as needs, for burning in mow.
such skill aperteinith, to harvest man's art:
and taken in time, is a hus bandly part.
16
No turning of peason, till carrige ye make,
nor turn in no more, then ye mind for to take.
least beaton with showers, so turned to dry:
by turning and tossing, they shed as they lie.
17
If weather be fayer, and tyedy thy grain,
make spedely carrige, for fear of a rain.
for tempest and showers, deceiuith a meny:
and lingering lubbers, lose meany a penny.
18
In goeuing at harvest, learn skilfully how,
each grain for to lay, by it self on amow:
sede bareley the purist, goue out of the way:
all other nigh hand, goue as just as ye may.
19
Stack pease upon houel, abroad in the yard,
to cover it quickly, let owner regard.
least dove and the cadow, there finedinge a smack:
with stormy ill weather, do perish thy stack.
20
Corn carryd, let such as be poor go and gleane,
and after thy cattle, to mowthit up clean.
then spare it or rowen, till Mihel be past:
to lenghthen thy dayrie, no better thou have.
21
In harvest time, harvest folk, servants and all,
should make all to gyther, good there in thy hall,
and fill out the blackboll, of bleith to their song:
and let them be merye, all harvest time long.
22
Once ended thy harvest, let none be begylde,
please such as did help thee, man, woman and child.
Thus doing, with all way, such help as they can:
thou, winnest the praise, of the laboring man.
23
Now look up to Godward, let tongue never cease
in thanking of him, for his mighty increase.
Accept my good will, for a proof go and try:
the better thou thriuest, the gladder am I.
A brief conclusion where you may see,
each word in the verse to begin with a T.
Cap. 44.
THe thriftie, that teaches the thriuing to thrive.
Teach timely to trauerse, the th^g that thou triue. Triue for contriue.

Transferring thy toyling, to timelines tought,
This teaches thee te^prance, to te^per thy thought.
Take trusty (to trust to) that think to thee, Thee for thrive.

That trustelie thriftines, trowleth to the.
Then temper thy travel, to tarry the tide,
This teaches the thriftines, twenty times tryde.
Take thankful thy talent, thank thanfully those,
That thriftely teaches, thy time to transpose.
Troth, twice to thee teached, teach twenty times ten
This trade thou that take, take thrift to the then.

The Ape, the Lion, the Fox, the Ass:
Thus setts forth man, as in a glass.
Ape, Like Apes we be toyinge, till twenty and one.
Lion, Then hasty as Lions, till xl be gone.
Fox, then wilye as Foxis, til xl. and three:
Ass, then after, for Asses accoumpted we be.
Who plays with his better, this lesson must know,
what humblenes, fox to the lion does owe.
for ape with his toyenge, and rudenes of ass:
brings (out of good hour) displeasure to pass.

A Comparison between Champion and Several. Chap. 48.
THe country enclosed I praise,
the the other delyteth not me,
For nothing the wealth it does raise
to such as inferior be.
Because of them both I do know:
I mind thereof somewhat to show.
2
There, swineheard that keeps the hog
there, neatheard with curre and his horn,
There, shepeheard with whistle and dog
be fence, to the meadowe and corn.
There, horse being tayed on a balke,
is ready with thief for to walk.
3
where al thing in common does rest,
corn field with the pasture and meade:
Though common ye do for the best,
yet what does it stand ye in stead.
There commune as communers do,
as good else to cobble a shoo.
4
What layer much better then there?
or cheaper (thereon to do well)
What drudgery more any where,
less good thereof, where can ye tell?
what gotten by Summer is seen:
that winter, there eats up cleene.
5
Example by Leycester shire,
what soil can be better then that,
For any thing heart can desire.
and yet does it want ye see what,
Mast, covert, close pasture, and wood.
and other things needful as good.
6
All thease does enclosure bring,
experience teaches no less,
I speak not to boast of the thing.
but only a trothe to confess.
Example (if doubt ye do make)
by Suffolk and Essex go take.
7
More plenty of Mutton and biefe,
corn, butter and cheese of the best,
More wealth any where (to be brief)
more people, more handsome and pressed.
where find ye? (go search any coest,
than there, where enclosure is moest.
8
More work, for the laboring man,
as well in the town as the field.
Or thereof (devise if ye can)
more profit, what countries do yield?
More seldom, where se ye the poor,
go begging from door unto door.
9
In Norfolk, behold the despair,
of tillage, to much to be borne,
By droeuers from faier to fair:
and others destroying the corn.
By custom and covetous pates,
by gapps and by opeing of gates.
10
what speak I of commoners bye,
with drawing all after a line,
So noying the corn, as it lie,
with cattle, with sheep and with swine.
when all is bestowed the cost,
look half of the same to be lost.
11
The flocks, of the lords of the soil,
do yearly the winter corn wrong,
The same in a manner they spoil.
with feeding so low and so long.
And therefore, that champion field:
does seldom good winter corn yield.
12
More profit is quieter found,
(where pastures in several be)
Of one silly acre of ground,
Then Champion makes of three.
Again what a joy is it known,
when men may be bold of their own.
13
The tone, is commended for grain,
yet bread made of beans they do eat:
The the other, for one loaf have twain,
of mastlin, of rye, or of wheat.
The Champion lives full bare,
when woodland full merry does fare.
14
Tone, gives his corn in a darth,
to horse, sheep and hog ery day,
The the other, give cattle warm barth,
and feed them with straw and with hay.
Corn spent of the tone, so in vain,
the the other, does sell to his gain.
15
Tone, barefoore and ragged does go,
and ready in winter to sterue,
when the other, ye see do not so,
but has that is needful to serve.
Tone, pain in a cottage cottage does take,
when the other, trim boowers do make.
16
Tone, lays for turffe and for sedge,
and has it with wonderful suite,
when the other, in every hedge,
has plenty of fuel and fruit.
Evils twenty times worser then thease,
enclosure full quickly would ease.
17
In woodland the poor men yt have,
scarce fully two acres of land,
14
More merrily live, and do save.
than the other, with twenty in hand,
yet pay they as much for the two,
as the other for twenty must do.
15
The laborer coming from thence,
in woodland to work any where,
(I warant you) goes not hence,
to work any more again there.
If this same be true (as it is)
why gather they nothing of this?
26
The poor, at enclosing do grutch,
because of abuses that fall,
Least some man should have but to much,
and some again nothing at all.
If order might there in be found,
what were to the several ground.
Thus endid husbandry, here folowith huswifrie.
Man, minedid for to thryue,
must wisely lay to wiue,
what had may thereby fall:
here argued find ye shall.
The dialog between two batchelers, of wiuing and thriuing by Affirmation and
Objection.
Affirmation. Friend, where we met this other day,
We heard one make his moan and say,
Good Lord, how might I thrive:
We heard an other answer him,
Then make the handsome trick and trym:
and lay in time to wiue.

Objection. And what of that, say you to me,
Do you your self think that to be?
The belt way for to thryue:
If troth were truly hulted out,
As touching thrift, I stand in doubt,
If men were best to wiue.

Affirmation. There is no doubt, for prove I can,
I have but seldom seen that man,
which could the way to thryuet
Until it was his happy lot,
To stay him self in some good plot:
and wisely then to wiue.

Objection. And I am of an other mind,
For by no reason can I find,
How that way I should thrive:
For where as now I spend a penny,
I should not then be quit with menny,
In bondage for to wiue.

Affirmation. Not so, for now where thou do spend
Of this and that, to no good end,
which hinders thee to thrive:
Such vain expe^sis thou should save,
and daily then lay more to have,
as others do that wiue.

Objection. why then do folk, this proverb putt,
the black ox near troade on thy foot,
If that way were to thrive:
Here out a man may soon pike forth,
Feawe feels what, a pomp is worth
Till such time as they wi^e.

Affirmation. It may so chance as thou doste say,
This lesson therefore beat a way,
If thereby thou wilt thrive
Look ere thou leap, see ere thou go,
It may be for thy profit so,
For the to lay to wiue.

Objection. It is to much we daily here,
To wiue and thrive both in a year.
As touching now to thrive:
I know not here in what to spy,
But that there does small profit lie,
to fancy for to wiue.

Affirmation. In deed the first year often is such
That fondly sum bestows much,
A let to them to thrive:
Yet other more, may soon be fownde*
which gets many a fair pownde*
The same day that they wiue.

Objection. I grant, some gets more that day
Than they can easily bear a way:
Now needs the^ must they thrive:
what gains such think you by that*
A littel burdein you wot what,
through fondnes for to wiue.

Affirmation. Thou seem blind, us more have been
It is not beauty brings in,
The thing to make the thrive:
In womankind, see that ye do
Require of her, no gift but two,
when ere ye mind to wiue.

Objection. But two say you? I pray you than,
Sheaw those as briefly as you can,
If that may help^ ^o thrive:
I ween we must (...) anon,
Of those same ^waine, to want the ton,
When ere we chance to wiue.

Affirmation, Honesty and Huswiferie
An honest huswi^e, trust to me,
be those same ^wayne I say to thee,
That help so much to thrive:
As honesty (...) passes (...),
so huswiferie (...),
do pleasure such as (...).

Objection. The honesty for both I grant,
Is one good point a wife should haunt.
To make her husband thrive:
But now falsie would I have you show,
How should a man good huswife know
If once he hap to wiue.

Affirmacion. A huswife good betime (...),
And order things in comely wise.
Her mind is set to thrive:
Upon her distaffe, she will spin,
And with her needle she will win,
If such ye hap to wiue.

Objection. It is not idle going about,
nor all day pricking on a clout
Can make a man to thrive:
If else there be none other winning,
but that the wife gets, by her spinning.
Small thrift it is to wiue.

Affirmacion. Some more then this, yet do they shall,
Although thy stock be very small.
yet will she help thee thrive:
Lay you to save as well as she,
and then you shall enriched be.
when such you hap to wiue.

Objection. If she were mine, I tell thee trothe,
To much to troubleher I were loathe,
For greedines to thrive:
Least some should talk, as is the speech
ye good wives husband wears no breech,
If such I hap to wiue.

Affirmation. What hurts it thee, what some do say,
If honestly she take the way
To help thee for to thrive:
For honesty will make her pressed,
To do the thing that shall be best.
If such ye hap to wiue.

Objection. Why did Diogenes say than,
To one that asked of him time when,
were best to wiue to thrive:
Not yet (quod he) if thou be young,
If thou wex old, then hold thy tongue,
It is to late to wiue.

Affirmation. Belike he knew some shreawishe wife,
which with her husband, made such strife,
That hindered him to thrive:
who then may blame him for that clause,
though the^ he spoke, as some had cause.
as touching for to wiue.

Objection. Why then I see, to take a shreawe,
(as seldom other there be feawe),
Is not the way to thrive:
So hard a thing I spy it is,
The good to choose the shreawe to miss,
that fears me to wiue.

Affirmation. She may in some thing, seem a shreaw,
Yet such a huswife as but feawe,
To help thee for to thrive:
This proverb, look in mind ye keep.
As good a shreawe is, as a sheep,
for you to take to wiue.

Objection. Now be she lamb or be she eawe,
Give me the sheep, take thou the shreaw
Se which of us shall thrive:
If she be shreawishe think for trothe,
For all her thrift, I would be loathe,
to match with such to wiue.

Affirmation, Tusshe, farewell then I leave you of,
Such fools as you, that love to scof,
Shall seldom wiue to thrive:
Contrary her as you do me,
And then ye shall I warrant ye,
Repent ye, if ye wiue.

Objection. Frinde, let us both give justly place,
To wedded man to judge this case,
which best way is to thrive:
For both our talk, as seems plain,
Is but as happens in our brain,
To will or not to wiue.

VVedded man's judgment,
upon the former argument.

AS Cock, that wants his mate, Moderator.

goes rouing all about,
with croewing early and late:
to find his lover out:
And as poor seely hen
Long wantinge Cock to guide,
soon droopes, and shortly then
begins to peake a side:
even so it is with man and wife,
(where government is sownde)
the want of thou, the tothers life
does shortly soon confownde.
IN jest and in earnest, here argued ye find,
that husband with huswife, in wedlock must dwell,
and thereto the judgment of weddid man's mind
that husbandry otherwise speedith not well.
so, somewhat more now, I entend for to tell,
of huswifrie like as of husbandry told:
how huswysly huswife, helps bring in the gold.
FINIS.
The points of huswifrie, united to the comfort of husbandry, newely
corrected and amplified with diverse good lessons for householders to recreat the
reader, as by the table at the end here of more plainly may apere.

To the right honorable and my especial good Lady and Mistress the Lady Paget.
THough danger he mickle
and favor so fickle:
yet duty does tickle,
my fancy to wright:
concerning how pretty,
how fine and how nettie
good huswife should yettie
from morening to night.
2
Not mynedid by wrighting,
to kindle a spighting,
but sheaw by endighting,
as afterward told:
how husbandrye easith
so huswifrie pleasith,
and many purse greasith
with silver and gold.
3
For husbandrye weepith
where huswifrie sleepith,
and hardly he creepith
up ladder to thrift:
that wantith to bold him
thriftes ladder to hold him
before it be told him,
be falls with out shifte.
4
Least meany should fear me,
and others forsweareme,
of troth I do bear me
upright as ye se:
full mine did to love all,
and not to reprove all,
but only to move all,
good huswifes to be.
5
For if I should mind some,
or deskant behind some,
and missing to find some,
displease so I might:
or if I should blend them,
and so to offend them,
what stir I should send them
I stand in a dout.
6
Though harmles I make it,
and some do well take it,
if others forsake it
what pleasure were that:
naught else but to pain me.
and nothing to gain me,
but make them disdain me,
I wot ner for what.
7
Least some make a trial,
as clock by the dyall,
some stand to denial,
some murmr and grudge:
give judgment I pray you,
for justly so may you
so fancy so say you,
I make you my judge.
8
In time, ye shall try me,
by troth, ye shall spy me,
so find, so set by me,
according to skill:
how eauer tree growith
the fruit, the tree showith,

9
though fortune does measure,
and I do lack treasure,
yet if I may pleasure

then will me to mend it,
or mend er ye send it,
or any where lend it,

The preface of the book of Huswifrie.
TAke weapon away, of what force is a man?
take huswife from husband, and what is he than?
2
As lovers desires to gether to dwell,
so husbandry loves, good huswifrie well.
3
Though husbandry seems, to bring in ye gains
yet huswiferie labors, seem equal in pains.
4
Some respit to husbands, the weather may send
but huswiues affairs, has never none end.
As true as thy faith, Thus huswifrie says.
I Serve for a day, for a week for a year,
for life time, for ever, while man dwells here. The praise of huswifry

For richer, for porer, from North to the South.
for honest, for hardhed, or dainty of mouth.
For wed, and unwedded, in sickness and health,
for all that well lives, in good common wealth.
For City, for country, for Court and for cart,
to quiet the head, and to comfort the heart.
A description of huswife and Huswiferye.
OF huswife, does huswiferie challenge ye name,
of Huswiferie, huswife does likewise the same.
where husband and Husbandry, joins with thease,
there welthines gotten, is holden with ease.
The name of a Huswife, what is it to say?
the wife of the house, to the husband a stay.
If huswife does that, as belongs to her:
if husband be wittye, there needs no stir.
The Huswife is she, that to labor does fall,
the labor of her, I do huswiferie call.
If thrift by that labor, be saved or got:
then is it good huswiferie, else is it not.
The woman, the name of a Huswife does win,
by keeping her house, and of doings therein.
And she that with husband, will quietly dwell:
must think on this lesson, and follow it well.
FINIS.
Enstructions to Huswiferie.
Serve God is the furst,
True love is not wurst.
A Daily good lesson, of huswife in deed,
is God to remember, the better to speed.
2
Another good lesson, of huswiferie thought,
is huswife with husband, to lieue as she ought.
Wife comely no grief,
Man out, huswife chief.
3
Though tricksy to see to, be gallant to wiue,
yet comely and wise, is the huswife to thrive.
4
When husband is absent, let huswife be chief,
and look to their labor, that eats her biefe.
Both out, not allow,
Keep house, huswife thou.
5
Where husband and huswife, be both out of place,
there servants do loyter, and reason their case.
6
The huswife so named (of keeping the house)
must tend on her profit, as cat on the mouse.
Seek home for rest,
For home is best.
7
As huswiues keep home, and be stirrers about,
so speedeth their winnings, the year thorough out.
8
though home be but homly, yet huswif is taught
that home has no fellow, to such as have aught.
Use all with skill,
ask what ye will.
9
Good usage with knowledge, and quiet with all,
Makes huswife to shine, as the sun on the wall.
10
what husband refuses, all comely to have,
that has a good huswife, al willing to save.
Be ready at need,
all thine to feed.
11
The case of god huswiues, thus daily does stand,
what ever shall chance, to be ready at hand.
12
This care has a huswife all day in her head,
that all thing in season be huswifely fed.
By practice go muse,
how howshold to use.
13
Dame practice is she, that to huswife must tell,
which way for to govern, her family well.
14
Use laborers gently, keep this as a law,
make child to be civil, keep servant in awe.
who careless do leiue,
occasion do geiue.
15
Have every where, a respect to thy ways,
that none of thy life, any siaunder may raise.
16
what many do know, though a time it be hid,
at length will abroad, when a mischief shall bid.
No neighbor reprove,
do so, to have love.
17
the love of thy neighbor, shall stand thee instead,
the poorer, the gladder, to help at a need.
18
Use fre^dly thy neighbor, else trust him in this
as he has thy friendship, so trust unto his.
Strike nothing unknown.
take hid to thine own.
19
Revenge not thy wrath, upon any man's beast,
least thine be like malice, be bid to like feast.
20
what husband provides, with money his drudge,
yt huswife must look to, which way it does trudge.
A Digression.
NOw out of the matter, this lesson I add,
concerning cock croweing, what profet is had
experience teathith, as true as a clock:
how winter nights passith, by marking the cock.
Cock croweith at midnight, times feaw above six,
with pause to his neighbor, to answer betwix,
at three a clock thicker, and then as ye know:
like all in to mattens, nere day they do crow.
At midnight, at three, and an hour ere day,
they utter their language, as well as they may.
which who so regardith, what counsel they give.
will better love croweing, as long as they leave.
For being frayde,
take hid good maid:
Mark crowing of cock
for fear of your dock,
At midnight.
The first cock croweith,
How, dame it is midnight what rumbling is that
The next cock showeith.
Take hide to false harlots, and more ye wot what.
If noise ye do hear.
look all thing be clear.
Least drabbs do noy the.
and thieves destroy the.
At iii. a clok
The first cock croweith,
Maids three a clock, kned, lay your bucks, or go brewe,
The next cock showith.
And cobble and botch, ye that cannot buy new.
Both maiden and man,
Mend now what ye can.
Leave gibber gabber,
mend slibber slabber.
At ye break of day.
The first cock croweith,
Past five a clock, holla: maid sleeping beware,
The next cock showeith,
Least quickly your mystris, uncover your bare.
Maid up I beseech you,
Least mystris do breche you.
To work and away,
As fast as ye may.
Now listen good huswiues, what huswifrie here,
set out for a day, as it should for a year.

Good huswiues take pain, and do count it good luck
to make there own breast, their own child to give suk
Though wrauling and rocking, be noisome so nere,
yet lost by ill nursing, is worser to here.
But one thing I warn the, let huswife be nurse,
least husband does find the, to frank with his purse.
What hilbacke and fill belly, makes away,
that help to make good, or else look for a fray.
Give child that is fitly, give baby the big,
give hardness to youth, and give roperipe a twig.
we find it not spoken, so often for naught,
that children were better, unborn than untaught
Some cockneis with coekig, are made very fools,
fit neither for prentice, for plough nor for schools.
Teach child to ask blessing, serve God and to church,

For men a perfect warning,
what child shall come by learning.
AL you that feign would learn, ye perfect way,
to have your child, in musik some thing seen
ask Nature first, what thereto she does say.
ere further suit, ye make to such a Queen.
For doubtless (Grossum caput) is not he,
of whom the learned Muses, seen will be.
Once tried that nature, trim has done her part,
and Lady Music, far in love withal:
Be wise who first, does teach thy child that art,
least homely breaker, mar fine ambling Ball.
Not rod in madbraines hand, is that can help,
but gentle skill, does make the proper whelpe.
where choice is hard, count good for well a fine,
skill mixed with will, is he that teaches best,
Let this suffice* for teaching child of thine:
choose quickly well, for all the lingering rest.
Mistaught at first, how seldom proves well?
trim taught (O God) how shortly does excel?
Although as ships, must tarry wind and tide,
and perfect hours, abide their stinted time,
So likewise, though of learning (daily tried)
space must be had, ere will may there to clime:
Yet easy steps, and perfect way to trust,
does cause good speed, confess of force we must.
Thus in the child, though wit enough we find,
and teacher good, near han^, or other where:
And time as apt, as may be thought with mind,
nor cause, in such thing, much to doubt or fear:
Yet coeking Ma^ms, and shifting Dads from schools,
make pregnant wits, to prove unlearned fools.
Ere learning come, to have first art thou taught,
apt learning child, apt time that thing to frame,
Apt cunning man to teach, else all is naught,
apt parents glad, to bring to pass the same.
On such apt ground, the Musks love to build,
this lesson learn: adewe else learned child.
A Sonet to the Lady Paget.
SOme pleasures take,
and can not give,
but only make,
poor thanks their shift:
Some meaning well,
in det do leave,
and cannot tell,
How else to shift.
Some knock and feign,
would open the door,
to learn the vain,
good turn to praise:
Some show good face,
and be but poor,
yet have a grace,
good fame to raise.
Some owe and give,
yet still in det,
and so must leiue,
for ought I know:
Some wish to pay,
and cannot get,
but night and day,
still more must owe.
Even so must I, for pleasures past
still wish you good, while life does last

Such wayter is fauty, that stands so bye,
unmindful of service, forgetting his eye.
If master to such, give a bone for to gnawe:
he does but his office, to teach such a dawe.

Such ravening puttocks, for vitels so trim:

The Auctors belief.
God the father.
THis is my steadfast Creed, my faith and all my trust,
That in the heavens, there is a God, most mighty, mild and just.
A God above all Gods, a king above all kings,
The lord of lords, chief governor, of heaven and earthly things.
2
Maker of heaven
That power has of life, of death, of heaven and hell,
That all thing made (as pleases him) so wonderful to tell.
That made the hanging Skies, so decked with diverse lights,
of darkness made the cherefull days, and all our restfull nights.

The earth.
That clad this earth with herb, with trees of sundry fruits,

That joined brooks to Dales, to hills fresh water springs,
with Ryuers sweet, along the Meades, to profit many things.
That made the hoary Frostes, the flaky Snowes so trim,
the honey Deaws, the blustering winds, to serve as pleases him.

The Seas.

That skillful man, with sailing ship, might travel to and froe.
And stored so the same, for man's unthankful sake,
that every nation under heaven, might thereby profit take.

That gave to man a soul, with reason how to lieue,
That does to him, and althing else, his blessing daily geeue.

That sends threatening plagues, to keep our lieues in awe,
His benefits if we forget, or do contempne his law.

And is the God of Abraham, Isacke and Israel.
That does displeasure take, when we his laws offend,
And yet amyds his heavy wrath, his mercy does extend.

11
This, is that virgins child, that same most holy Priest, Christ our Messiah

This, that Messiah was, of whom the Prophet spoke,
that should tread down ye Serpents head, and our attoneme^t make.

To living wight more evil, what could such wretches do?

This, was the Pascall lamb, whose love for us so stood, Christ's death.

his soul I mean, his slayned corpse, in Tomb remainyng still.
16
His resurrection. His Ascension
From death to life again, the third day this did rise,
and seen on earth to his elect, times often in sundry wise.
And after into heaven, ascend he did in sight,

Where for us wretches all, his father he does pray,

Then shall that voice be heard, come come ye good to me,
hence hence to hell you workers evil, where pain shall ever be.
This is that loving Christ, which I my Savior call,

19
God the Holy ghost
In God the holy Ghost, I firmly do believe,
which from the father and the Son proceeding, life does give.
Which by the Prophets spoke, which does all comfort send,
which I do trust, shall be my guide, when this my life shall end.
20
The Catholic church
A holy catholic Church on earth I grant there is,
and those which frame their lives by that, shall never speed amiss.
The head whereof is Christ, his word the chiefest post:
preserver of this Temple great, is God the holy Ghost.
21
The communion of Saints
I do not doubt there is, a multitude of Saints,
more good is don, resembling the^, then showing the^ our plaints.
Their faith and works in Christ, that glory them did give:
which glory we shall likewise have, if likewise we do lieue.
22
forgeuenes of sins
At God of heaven there is, forgiveness of our sins,
through Christ's death, through faith in it, and through none other ginnes.
If we repentant here, his mercy daily crave:
through steadfast hope and faith in Christ, forgeuenes we shall have
23
I hope and trust upon, the rising of the flesh,
this corpse of mine (that furst must dye) shall rise again afreshe. Man's
resurrection

The body and soul even then, in one shall joined be:
as Christ did rise, from death to life, eue^ so through Christ shall we

As Christ is glorified, and never more shall dye,
as Christ ascended is to heaven, through Christ even so shall I. Life
everlasting.

As Christ I count my head, and I a member of his,
so God I trust, for Christ's sake, shall settle me in bliss,
THus here we learn of God, that there be persons three,
the Father, Son, the holy Ghost, one God in trinity.
In substance all like one, one God, one lord, one might,
whose persons yet we do divide, and so we may by right.
As God the father is, the maker of us all,
so God the Son redemer is, to whom for help we call,
And God the holy Ghost, the soul of man does win,
by moving her to wail for grace, ashamed of her sin.
This is that God of Gods, whom every soul should love,
who^ al men's hearts, should quake for fear, his wrath on them to move
That this same mighty God, above al other chief:
shall save my soul, from doleful Hell, is all my whole belief.
Of the omnipotentie of God, and debilitie of man.
O God thou glorious God, what God is like to the.
what life, what strength, is like to thine, as al ye world may see*
Thy heavens, thine earth, thy Seas, and al thy works therein,
do show (to who^ thou would to know) what you have ever ben:
2
But all the thoughts of man, are bent to wretched evil,
man does commit Idolatry, bewitched of the Devil.
What evil is left undone, where man may have his will:
man ever was an hipocrite, and ever will be still.
3
What daily watch is made, the soul of man to slay,
What these 4. principal deuels do signify.
by Lucifer, by Belsabub, Mammon, and Asmode.
In devilish pride, in wratch, in coveting too much,
in fleshly lust the time is spent, the life of man is such.
4
The joy that here he has, is as a spark of fire,
his acts be like, the smoldring smoke, him self but dirt and mier:
His strength even as a Reed, his age much like the flower,
his breath or life is but a puff, uncertain every hour.
5
But for the holy Ghost, and for his gifts of grace,
the death of Christ, thy mercy great, man were in woeful case.
O grant us therefore lord, to amend that is amiss,
and when from hence, we do depart, to rest with thee in bliss.
Eleemosina prodest homini in vita, in morte and post mortem.
FOr only love to God, more Christian like to leave,
Of alms deeds.
and for a zeal, to help the poor, thine allmes daily give.
Let gift no glory look, nor evil possess thy mind:
and for a trothe, thease profets three, through alms shall you find.
1
First, here the holy Ghost, shall daily through his grace,
Provoke thee to repentant life, Gods mercy to embrace.
2
Of goods and friends (by death) when thou thy leave must take
thine alms deeds, shall clasp thy soul, and neauer it for sake.
3
When God shall (after death) call soon for thine account,
Thine alms then, (through faith in Christ) shall al thing else surmount
But yet for any deed, put thou no trust therein,
But put thy trust in God (through Christ) to pardon thee thy sin.
For else as cacklyng Hen, with noise bewrayes her nest,
Even so go thou and blase thy deeds, and lose thou all the rest.
Malus homo.
Of naughty man I read, two sundry things are meant,
The tone is man, the the other naught, which ought him to repent
The man we ought to love, because of much therein,
the evil in him, we ought to hate, because it is a sin.
So does thy daily sins, thy heavenly lord offend:
but when thou do, repent the same, his wrath is at an end.
Of two sorts of men, tone good, and the other bad.
Since first the world began, there was and shall be still,
Of human kind; two sundry sorts, the one good, and the other ill.
which till the Judgment day, shall here to gether dwell,
But then the good shall up to heaven, the bad shall down to hell
Diabolo cum resistitur, est vt formica, Cu^ vero eius suggestio recipitur,
fortis est vt Leo
When Satan we resist, a Pysmer shall he be,
But when we seem, to give him place, a Lion then is he.
The description of an envious and naughty neighbor.
AN envious neighbor is easy to find,
His combersome tetches, are seldom behind.
His hatred procures, from naughty to wurse
His friendship, like Judas, that carrid ye purse
His head as a storehouse, with quarrels full fraught.
His brain, is unquiet, till all come to naught.
His memory preignant, old evils to recyte,
His mind ever fyred, each euel to requyte.
His mouth full of venym, his lypps out of frame.
His tongue a false witness, his friend to defame.
His eyes be promoters, some trespass to spy,
His ears be as spyalls, a larum to cry.
His hands be as tyrants, reuengyng each thing,
His feet at thine elbow, as Serpent to sting.
His breast full of rancor, like Coprus to freat,
His heart, like a Lion, his neighbor to eat.
His gate like a sheepebyter, flearing aside,
His look like a coxcomb, up puffed with pride.
His face made of brass, like a vice in a game,
His iesture like Dauus, whom Terence does name
His brag as Thersytes, with elbowes abroad,
His cheeks in his fury, shall swell like a Tode.
His culler like ashes, his cap in his eyes,
His noese in the air, his snout in the skies.
His promis to trust to, as slipper as Ise.
His credyt much like, to the chance of the dyce.
His knowledge or skill, is in praeting so much,
His company shonned, and so be all such.
His friendship is counterfeit, seldom to trust,
His doings unlucky, and ever unjust.
His fetch is to flatter, to get what he can,
His purpose once gotten, a pynne for the than.
Fortuna non est semper amica,
Superbiam igitur semper deuita.

Though Fortune smiles, and fawnes upon thy side
Thy self ertoll for that, no whitt the more,
Though fortune frowns, and wresteth al thing wide:
Let fansy stay, keep courage still in store.
For chance may change, as chance has done before.
Thus shall thou hold, more safe thine honor got,
Or lose the less, though Fortune will or not.
Thy friend at this, shall daily pleasure have,
when warely thus, thou bear thy self upright,
Thy foes at this, shall gladly friendship crave.
When hope so small is left, to wreck their spite,
For lowely life withstandeth envy quight.
As floetyng Ship, by bearing sail allow:
Withsta^deth storms, when boistrous winds do blow.
Thine usage thus, in time shall win the gole,
though doubtful haps, dame Fortune se^ds between
And thou shall see, thine enmyes blow the cole:
To ease thine heart, much more the^ thou do ween,
Yea though a change, most strangely should be seen.
Yet friend at need, shall secret friendship make,
When foe in deed, shall want, his part to take.
Of thauthors departing from court to the Country.
Muse not my freende, to find me bore
Contented with, this poor estate,
And seem to do, with willing chere,
That courtier does, so deadly hate:
For fortunes look,
Has changed hew,
And I my book,
must learn a new.
2
And yet of force, to learn a new
Would much abash, the dulled brain,
I crave to judge, if this be true,
the truant child, that knowth the pain,
But where a spite,
Of force must be,
What is that wight,
may disagree.
No, no, god wot, to disagree,
Is ventring all to make or mar,
If fortune frown, we daily see,
It is not best, to strive to far.
For lordly bent,
Must learn to spare,
And be content
With country fare.
4
From dainty court, to country fare.
To daintly fed, is diet strange,
From cities joy, so country care,
to skilles folk, is homely change.
Where need yet can,
none other skill,
sometime poor man
must break his will.
5
If courtly change, so breaks will,
that country life, must serve the turn,
what profit then, in striving still,
against the prick to seem to spurn.
If court with cart,
must be content:
what ease to heart,
though mind repent.
6
What gain I, though I do repent.
my crotches al, are broke and gone,
My woonted friends, are careless bent,
they fear no chance, I chance upon.
As need does make
old age to trot,
So must I take,
in worth my lot.
7
Now, if I take in worth my lot,
that fatal chance does force me to,
If ye be friends, embraid me not,
but use a friend, as friends should do.
Behold the horse
must trudge for pelse:
And yet of force
content it self.
The Auctours life.
Now gentle freende, if thou be keende,
Disdain thou not, although the lot,
will now with me, no better be,
Then does apers:
Nor let it grieve, that thus I leiue,
But rather guess, for quietness,
As others do, so do I to,
Content me here.
2
By leave and love, of God above,
I mind to sheawe, in versis feawe,
How through ye breers, my yeuthful years,
have run their race:
And further say, why thus I stay,
and mind to leiue, as be in heiue,
Full bent to spend, my life to anend,
in this same place.
3
Borne at Ryuenhall in Essex
If came to pas, that borne I was,
Of linnage good, of gentle blood,
In Essex layer, in village fayer,
that Riuenhall hight:
Which village lide, by bancktre side,
There spend did I, mine infancy,
There then my name, in honest same,
remainde in sight.
4
I, yet but young, no speech of tongue,
Nor tears withal, that often fall,
Fro mothers eyes, when child out cries,
to part her fro:
Could pyttie make, good father take,
Set to song school.
But out I must, to song be thrust,
Say what I would, do what I could,
his mind was so.
5
O paineful time, for every crime, Queristers Mysery.

What toesed ears, like bayted bears,
What bobbed lips, what Ierks, what nipps,
what hellish toys:
What roebes how bare, what college fare,
What bread how stale, what peany ale,
Then Wallingford, how wart thou aborde, Wallingford college

of seely boys.
6
Then for my voice, I must (no choice)
Away of force, like poesting horse,
For sundry men, had plagards then, Singyng men's commissions.

The better breast, the lesser rest,
To serve the Queere, now there now here,
For time so spent, I may repent.

7
But mark the chance, my self to vance,
By freendships lot, to Powels I got,
So fownde I grace, a certain space,
still to remain:
With Redford there, the like no where, Ihon Redford an excellent musition.

For cunning such, and virtue much,
By whom some part, of Music art,
so did I gain.
8
From Powels I went, to Aeton sent,
To learn straight ways, the Latin phrayes,
Where fyfty three, strippes given to me,
at once I had:
For fawt but small, or none at all,
yt came to pas, thus beat I was,
Se Wdall se, the mercy of the, Nicholas Vdal schole master at Eton.

9
Trinitye hall in Ca^bridge.
To London hence, to Camebridge thence,
With thanks to thee, o Trinitee,
That to thy hall, so passing all
I got at last:
There joy I felt, there trim I dwelt,
There heaven from hell, I shifted well,
With learned men, a number then,
The time I past.
10
Long sycknes had, then was I glad,
To leave my book, to prove and look,
In Court what gain, by taking pain,
Might well be found:
Lord Paget good to his servants.
Lord Paget than, that Noeble man,
Whose soul I trust, is with the just,
That same was he, enrycked me,
With many a pound.
11
While this betyed, good parents dyed,
One after one, till both were gone,
Whose petygree, who list may see,
The Hope we have of the dead
The Harrolds book:
Whose souls in bliss, be long er this,
For hope we must, as God is just,
So here that crave, shall mercy have,
That mercy look.
12
The bytes of ye Court.
By Court I spyed, and ten years tried,
That cards and dyce, with Venus vice,
And peuish pride, from virtue wide,
With some so wraught:
That Tyburne play, made them away,
Or beggars state, as evil to hate,
By such like evils, I saw such dreuils,
To come to naught.
13
Yet is it not, to be forgot,
In Court that some, to worship come, The Court commendid

And some in time, to honor clime,
And speed full well:
Some have such gift, that trym they shift,
Some profit make, by pains they take,
In peril much, though often are such,
In Court that dwell.
14
when Court began frown, The nobility at variance.
and strife in town
And lords and knights, saw heavy sights,
Then took I wife, and led my life,
In Suffolk soil:
There was I feign, my self to train,
To learn to long, the fermours song,
For hope of pelf, like wordly else,
To moyle and toil.
15
As in this book, who list to look,
Of husbandrye, and huswiferye,
There may he find, more of my mind,
Concerning this:
To carpe and care, and ever bare,
with loss and pain, to little gain,
All this to have, to cram sir knave,
What life it is.
16
when wife cold not, through sycknes got,
more toil abide, so nigh Sea side,
Then thought I best, from toil to rest,
And Ipswich try:
A Town of price, like paradyse,
For quiet then, and honest men,
There was I glad, much friendship had,
A time to lie.
17
There left good wife, this present life,
And there left I, house charges lie,
For glad was he, might send for me,
Good luck so stood:
In Suffolk there, were every where,
Even of the best, besides the rest,
That never did, their friendship hyd,
To do me good.
18
Suffolk co^mendid
O Suffolk thou, content the now,
That had the praise, in those same days,
For Squyers and knights, that well delyghts.
Good house to keep:
For Norfolk wyles, so full of guyles,
Have caught my toe, by wyuing so.
That out to thee, I see for me,
No way to creep.
19
Mistres Amy Moon.
For lo, through guile, what happs ye while,
Through Venus toys, in hope of joys,
I chanced soon, to find a moon,
of cherefull hew:
Which well a fine, me thought did shine,
Did never change (a thing most strange)
yet kept in sight, her course aright,
And compass true.
20
The charges folowi^g a yo^g wife.
Behold of truth, with wife in youth,
For joy at large, what daily charge,
Through childrens happ, what opened gapp,
To more begone:
The child at nurse, to robb the purse,
The same to wedd, to trouble head,
For pleasure rare, such endless care,
Has husband won.

Then did I dwell, In Dyrram sell, West Dyrram Abbey.

A place for wood, that trymly stood,
With flesh and sishe, as heart would wish,
But when I spyed:
That lord with lord, could not acorde,
But now pound be, and now pound we,
Then left I all, because such brall,
I list not bide.
22
O Soothwell what, meanst thou by that. sir Richard Soothwell a good houskeper.

Thou worthy wight, thou famous Knight,
So me to crave, and to thy grave,
Go by and by:
O death thou for, why dydst thou so,
Ungently treat, that Jewel great,
Which dept his door, to rich and poor,
So bounteously.
23
There thus bestad, when leave I had,
By death of him, to sink or swim,
And Ravens I saw, together draw,
In such a sort:
Then ways I sought, by wisdom tought,
To bear low sail, least stock should quayle,
Till ship might find, with prosperous wind
Some safer porre.
24
At length by velve, to shore I drew, Norwich Cyty.

Discharging straight, both ship and freight,
At Norwich fine, for me and mine,
A City trym:
Where strangers well, may seem to dwell,
That pytch and pay, or keep their day,
But who that want, shall find it scant,
So good for him.
25
Master Salibury deane of Norwich
But Saliberye how, were kept my bow,
If praise from the, were kept by me,
Thou gentle deane, my only mean,
there then to leiue:
Though churles such sum, to crave can come
And pray once got, regard the not,
yet leiue or dye, so will not I,
example geiue.
26
When learned men, could there nor then,
Devise to aswage, the stoeny rage,
Nor yet the fury of my dissurie,
that long I had:
From Norwich air, in great dispayer,
Away to fly, or else to dye,
To seek more health, to seek more weith,
Then was I glad.
27
Fayersted personage in Essex.
From thence so sent, away I went,
With sickness worn, as one forlorn,
To house my bed, at Faiersted,
Where whiles I dwelt:
The tyething life, the tyething strife,
Through tyething ill, of Jack and Gyll,
The daily pays, the myery ways,
To long I felt.
25
When charges grew, still new and new,
And that I spied, if person died,
(All hope in vain) to hope for gain,
I might go dance:
Once ^yo my hand, of personage land,
Thence by and by, away went I,
To London straight, to hope and weight,
For better chance.
29
Well London well, that bearst the bell, London co^mendid

Of praise about, England through out,
And do in deed, to such as need,
Much kindness sheaw:
Who that with thee, can hardly agree,
Nor can well praise, thy friendly ways,
Shall friendship find, to please his mind,
In places sheaw.
30
As for such mates, as learning hates,
Or he or they, as go so gey,
That needs he must, take all of trust,
For him and his:
Though such for woe, by Lothberye go,
For being spide, about Cheapeside,
Least Mercers books, for money looks,
Small matter it is.
33
Thus friends by me, perceive may ye, A lesson for younger brothers

That Gentry stands, not all by lands,
Nor all so fest, or plenty left,
By parents gift:
But now and then, of gentle men,
The younger son, is dreuen to run,
And glad to seek, from creek to creek,
To come by thrift.
32
And more by this, to conster is,
In world is set, enough to get,
But where and when, that scarsly can,
The wisest toll:
By learning some, to riches come,
By shypp and plough, some get enough,
And some so wiue, that trim they thrive,
And speed full well.
33
Hardness in youth not ye worst.
To this before, add one thing more,
Youth hardness tought, wc knowledge wrought
Most apt do prove, to shift and shoue,
Among the best:
Coeking of youth not ye best.
Where coeking Dads, make sawey lads,
In youth so rage, to beg in age,
Or else to fetch, a Tyburne stretch,
Among the rest.
34
Not pride in youth, but wealth i^ age nedeful
Not rampishe toys, of gyrle or boy,
Nor garment trym, of her or him,
In childehode spent, to fond intent,
Good end does frame:
If mark we shall, the sum of all,
The end it is, that noted is,
Which if it hide, with virtue tried,
deserves fame.
35
Man does labor and god does bless
When all is done, learn this my son,
Not friend nor skyll, nor wit at will,
Nor ship nor clod, but only God,
Does all in all,
Man takes pain, God gives gain,
Man does his best, God does the rest,
Man well entends, God foyzen sends,
Else want he shall.
36
Some seek for wealth, I seek my health,
Some seek to please, I seek mine ease,
Some seek to save, I seek to have,
To live upright:
More then to ride, with pomp or pride,
Or for to set, in others det,
Such is my skill, and shall be still,
For any wight.
37
To fond wear I, here thus to lie,
unless that wealth, might further health.
and profet some, should thereby come,
to help withal:
This causes me, well pleased be,
such drift to make, such life to take,
on for singe mind, remorse to find,
as need, need shall.
38
Friend (al thing wayed, that here is said,
and being got, that pays the shot)
me think of right, have leave I might,
death drawinge nere:
To seek some ways, my god to prays,
and mercy crave, in time to have,
and for the rest, what he thinks best,
to suffer here.
