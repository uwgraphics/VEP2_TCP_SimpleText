A Doleful Ditty, or sorrowful Sonet of the Lord Darly, sometime King of Scots.
Neuew to the Noble and worthy King, King Henry the eight,
and is to be song to the tune of black and yellowe.
MY hand and pen proceed to write,
A woeful tale to tell:
My pen it cannot half indite,
Alas how it befell.
Woe worth the man that Treason first
This thing did take in hand,
Of all men's mouths they may be cursed,
Throughout this English land.
woe vvorth woe vvorth woe vvorth the^ all
vvo vvorth to them I say:
woe vvorth woe vvorth woe vvorth the^ all
vvo worth to them alvvay.
As it befell to Lord Darly,
Whose friends they may all rue,
That ever he on Scotland ground,
Or any place thereof kn^w.
The Queen of Scots a letter sent,
With it a heart and Ring,
Desiring him to come to her,
And she would make him king.
Woe vvorth. etc.
He thought it was a Courteous deed,
So noble a Queen as she,
Would marry him, and make him king,
Whereto he did agree.
When first in Scotland that he went,
He was discreet and sage:
And when in hand he took to rule,
But twenty years of age.
Woe worth. etc.
The guard of Sco^lande he did lead,
With all his noble train*
And ruled Scotland virtuously,
While life he did sustain.
But listen now and give good ^are,
To hear what chance befell.
For as the proverb old does go
Gold may be bought to well.
Woe vvorth. etc.
So did this noble Lord Darly,
When England he forsook:
When that in Scotland first he went,
The rule thereof he took.
There dwelt a stranger in the court,
Sinior David calde by name,
He was the first that went about,
This Treason vile to frame.
Woe vvorth. etc.
And chamberlayn he was to y^ Queen,
Who preferde him wondrous well,
As all the Lords in Court behealde,
Which causde their hearts to swell,
Against this David grudged the king,
A quarrel was picked for the nonce,
Within the chamber there was drawn,
Twelve Daggers all at once.
Woe vvorth. etc.
Some of the Lords took the kings part
And some took his certain,
Two Daggers he had at his heart,
And so David was slain.
And when the Queen hard of this news
she sore began to weep,
And made a vow and oath certain,
That she did mean to keep.
Woe vvorth. etc.
That in a tweluemonth and a day,
She would not pleased be:
Because that David so was slain,
With such great cruelty.
The twelve month and a day expyrde,
A meeting there should be,
By all the Lords it was agreede,
with great solemnity.
Woe worth. etc
At Rocksborow Castle there,
this king and Queen should meet,
And be made friends as erst they were
Some Lords the same did seek.
Three wights conspired the kings death
Whose names are all well known.
For which alas the people in
The country made great moan.
Woe vvorth. etc.
The wightes which this treason began,
for to destroy the king,
They took with them Gunpowder then,
the chamber they w^nt in.
And to them close they shut the door,
For fear of being spide,
They strawed the powder round about,
Full thick on every side.
Woe vvorth. etc.
And thereon strewed rushes green,
to hide the powder withal,
Because they would not have it seen,
Nor nothing smelt at all.
The banquet then prepared is,
They suppe and drink the wine,
The king (alas) knew not of this,
The which was wrought that time.
Woe vvorth. etc.
And after supper they did talk,
to pass away the time,
And every man his fancy spoke,
As best did please his mind,
Some men with Siniour David heald,
The king then in a rage:
Up to his chamber went straight way,
none with him but a page.
Woe worth.
And when he came the Chamber in,
the Page began to tell:
You are betrayde O noble king,
for powder I do smell.
O flee from hence haste you away,
and I on you will weight,
The king that hearing presently,
Leapt out the window straight.
Woe vvorth. etc.
One of them stood under the window
and took him in his arm,
Saying who art thou, O man fear not,
For thou shall have no harm,
I am an English man quoth he,
Of Scotland I am king,
King Henry once mine Uncle was,
Which was of England King,
Woe worth. etc.
I know thee well quoth one of them,
For that thou shall fare the worse,
That ever thou sluest the Chamberlayn,
that day thou sure shall curse,
For look what friendship thou did show
the Chamberlayne unto:
The like also to thee I am,
Now minded for to do. Woe vvorth. etc
Two of them took ye king straight way
And bound him foot and hand,
On a pearetree in the orcharde,
this noble king they hangde,
And when the Queen hard of this news.
She sore weapt for the king,
Peace Madame quoth the Lord Iamie,
you do but fayn this thing, vvo worth.
For why quoth she though he were young,
none was more meet then he,
To have worn the crown for his lineage
He came of high degree.
But now I wish my chamberlayne,
Had hanged in his room:
So that the king alive had been,
For to have worn the Crown.
vvo vvorth. etc.
Thus has this noble king alas,
His life lost as you hear:
Therefore I say and will do still,
He did buy Gold to dear.
God grant good Lord with heart I pray
Our noble Queen to guide,
And grant that never traitors false,
about her highness bide.
vvo worth vvo worth woe vvorth the^ al
vvo vvorth to them I say:
vvo worth vvo worth vvo worth the^ all
vvo vvorth to the^ always. Finis. H. C.
