OF the Kingdom of SCOTLAND, April 16. unto the Parliament of ENGLAND.

A REMONSTRANCE CONCERNING THE PRESENT TROUBLES FROM THE MEETING OF THE ESTAEES
OF the Kingdom of SCOTLAND, April 16. unto the Parliament of ENGLAND.
WHEN we look unto the Records of the ages past, to find out the greatest
blessings that God has bestowed on this I WILL, wherein we live, we cannot but
acknowledge, that next to the Christian Faith, the Union of the two Kingdoms
under one Head, does by many degrees exceed all other that fall in the
reckoning. Many practices and policies were set afoot by our Princes of old, to
hasten this work: but all in vain did the plots of men strive to cross or
prevent the council of God, who had reserved for us and our fathers that
singular happiness, to see that Union begun neither by a breach of faith, nor by
blood, but as the gift of God, to fall in our hands by the ordinary gate which
the Princes right sets open unto all, and the general and common interest of
both Nations did heartily receive and embrace. With what success this Union
has begun and continued to this day, the peace and plenty we have enjoyed all
this time, can witness in part, whiles all the rest of Europe almost, round
about us, has been a Field of blood and desolation. What apprehension the
enemies of our Religion had at our peaceable conjunction, and with what eye of
jealousy the neighbor States did look upon us, and envy our happiness, the
History of these times can bear record: but for the present, in regard of what
has passed these many years bygone, and what we presently feel and fear, we
may truly confess to our own guilt and great dishonor, that neither Scotland
nor England unto this day has righty understood or made use of this ra^^
blessing of heaven, for increasing their respect abroad, or securing t^eir own
safety at home; neither have the reformed Churches found tha^ comfort and
relief which they did expect from us in the day of t^eir distress, but on the
contrary we have been made, even against ou^ wills, a br^k^n reed, a rock of
offense, and a shipwreck unto all that have fought unto us for shelter from the
storm, and to our selves the one Nation against the other, a rod of correction
and jealousy, in the hands of a few wicked and ungodly men, men of sep^ration,
who divide the King from his people, and the people ^^om their King; and who
raise up brethren ag^in^t brethren^ that they in the end might prey and make
havoc of all. Amongst many that have been authors of these evils under which
the two Kingdoms have for a long time groaned, and belike must either now or
never be disburthened, none deserve so justly to be challenged in the first
place as some amongst you who call themselves Churchmen, but have left their
station to become ignorant and unhappy Statesmen, who have made the Church and
the Tenets thereof, an instrument of bondage to the Subject, of liberty to
themselves, and of unjust usurpation to the Prince, whom we had reason to fear
long ago by your example, and whom we find named as the chief instrument and
object of your just fears of the change of Religion and government of Estate
in the Ringdome of England, in that grave and solemn Remonstrance that was made
not many years ago, by the house of Commons to the Kings Majesty, if that had
stopped them any way, your pulpits and pamphlets can bear witness for them
and the rest of their crew since that time, yea how constant they are to the^e
wretched ends, their attempts upon us, and that deep plot of ob^ruding the
seeds of all Popish superstition and tyranny, upon our Kirk, in the Books of
Common Prayer, and Canons, will be a strong evidence for them how much they
have deserved of Rome, to make that Kirk which had departed farthest from her
to be first in the return, and exemplar unto others and how much more they may
yet deserve of them, and all the enemies of those tw^ Kingdoms, if they ^ffer
for a sacrifice in a blo^die War, the Rel^g^on and Liberties of both the
Nations, to appease the fury o^ there pres^n^ disapp^intment, and prevent the
shame of their de^e^ved ^all.

Certai^ly the posterity will hardly believe as we who have ^ee^ it cannot but
wonder) how it has come to pass, that the Subjects of Scotland (whose Union
with Engl^^d this day is known to be of g^ea^^r fo^ce, ^or her assurance at
home, and streng^h abroad, then all the alliances, pra^tises, policies,
conques^s your P^inces have made from the begi^ni^g) should have so long
pe^itioned their native Prince r^sidi^g amongst you to do them J^stice wher^f
he is debtor to his people, and to hear their just complaints against the
us^rpa^ion of a ^ew men, who were undermining the p^o^ess^^ ^^ligion and
government of the State, and to suffer them to live according to their Laws,
and yet could never be hea^d nor answered in the poin^ of their just desires,
far less will they guess what has been the ground of that merit and trust
of one domineering Pr^lat in the affection of the Prince, that it should be
more forcible to dissuade, then all the supplications and int^rc^ssions of so
ancient and faithful a N^tion, who among all the Kingdoms of Europ^ have
longest continued and main^ai^ed in one Line the honor of the Royal Crown,
together with ^he preservation of their own Liberties, should have power to
move. Truly for our selves when we call to mind what courage and constancy God
has given unto ^s since the beginning of these troubles, ^o stand for the
maintenance of our Religion and Liberties, that we have not suffered our selves
to be drawn headlong unto the servit^de of soul^s and bodies, from which there
had been no hope of Liberty for us or our po^^erity, and which in regard of ou^
conjunction with you under one King, had been a violent prejudice, and of
dangerous conse^uence for your Liberties when they come to be questioned in
their own time and place, and on the other part when we remember what strange
and violent ways were taken by our adversaries to keep from the Englis^ Nation
the knowledge of our affairs, and what unjust and false aspersions were laid
upon all our ac^ions and intenti^ns^ to provoke you to be actors of that
re^^nge that was determined against us by the insolent advice of such^ who now
govern his Majesty's Councels, and ^ettle their own ill acquired g^eatnes by
the oppression of his obedient Subjects in their Religion and liberties in both
Kingdoms, we cannot but bl^sse God who armed u^ with an invinsible pa^ience
and resolution to es^hew for our part^ (...) the uttermost of our power any
National breach: For ye may remember when contrary to our expectation his
Majesty by all the evil council of those men, did march toward us with an
Army, we neglected all courses which might advance our humane safety, rather
then start from any jot of our obedience, or give any seeming distaste to our
dear Brethren of England, and rather adventured the ruin of our own Country,
then endangered theirs: Yea further, when we did with horror and amazement
hear those unexampled Proclamations given out against a whole Nation, who were
never tainted with the least thought of disobedience to their Prince his just
commands, according to the rule of their Laws, Notwithstanding of this great
prov^cation, there was nothing to be heard amongst us but vows for his
Majesty's prosperity, and hearty desires from all to spend their blood for the
increase of his estate, and service of his Crown, and who abhorred then to be
reduced to that extremity, as to arm themselves for their own defense and
preservation. It will scarcely be believed by Strangers, by what means two
Nations so near together, and so straightly tied in all the bonds of goodwill and
mutual respect, where there was so little cause of espousing these quarrels,
wherein none of the Nations were concerned or wronged by the other in their own
proper rights, should be brought to such a posture, and near so dangerous a
rupture, that would not been easily (to say no more) p^eced up again in our
days, but it was the work of God, and it should be wonderful in our eyes,
who in the carriage of all this great business, has made every stop and ^et^
casten in by the adversary, a step of advancement, to the furthering of his
Cause, as is well known and acknowledged by all whom God has honored to be
the least instruments in this work, who also made this a singular mean to
testify our loyalty, and the sincerity of our hearts, where we presented our
humble and just desires unto his Majesty, and for the honor of the cause which
we maintain, and the tender regard to the credit of our own Prince (although
then armed against his own people) and for the brotherly respect unto the
Nobility, and others of our neighbor Nation, in^ending nothing, we believe,
but to follow the King, although really sa^isfying the ambi^ion and blood
thirs^ing reve^ge of a miserable Prelat. We labored in the treaty to give all
satisfaction on our part that could be required of most loyal Subjects, and
sensible of our Kings honor ^ourenemies being judges) even to our own apparent
disadvantage, for we delivered all places into his Majesty's hands, which were
desired, in testimony of our obedience, and although they might have been in
our hands, pledges of assurance for performance of these Articles that were
agreed to be granted in the following Assembly and Parliament; and now contrary
to our expectation are turned for Engines of terror, and Fetters of slavery to
frustrate us from obtaining the benefit of that capitulation. Notwithstanding
of all breach of promise we cannot but profess according to our tender respect
to our Prince, wherein we are inwardly g^ieved for the dishonor that is done
to his Majesty by the bad instruments that are about him, that neither we were
then ever-reached, nor do we yet repent upon our part for that great trust and
confidence we reposed upon his Majesty, for we did then remember that we were
dealing with our Prince, with whom as we should not strive for appurtenaces,
when the maine was granted, so we might rest assured, that if he could not be
brought in his own mind to judge aright how far he had been misled against us
his own people, who had given such an ample testimony of our trust, and of the
interest we should have in his favor above all other, but still continue to
pursue any advantages to our prejudices: we did not otherwise think but when
ever he had a mind to break, he could never want ill grounded pretense, to
allege against us; and it was fittest for us rather to hazard the
disadvantage, and commit the success to God what ever prejudice we should
suffer; for if the word of a King which should be the Oracle of truth to his
people, and the faith of promises and contracts under hand and seal, which is
the groundwork of trust in all humane society, and is sacred and inviolable
amongst Infidels and Turks, may not justly challenge for us the performance of
the Articles of the Treaty upon his Majesty's part, then may we truly think
that nothing we could have framed or desired then, would have been for our
safety of any avail unto us, as nothing had done us good or succeeded according
to our mind in all these things we have condescended unto (whereunto we were
not oblidged by any duty or respect whatsoever, otherwise then that we might
not be defrauded of the full and real performance of the Articles of
agreement) but on the contrary it does evidently appear by all that has past,
that there has been no desire nor meaning of peace in the hearts and minds of
our adversaries unto this day; for all the business of the capitulation has
been taken by them as a cloak to cover their more cunning and crafty designs,
hoping thereby to weaken us in time by their wicked policy, whom they could
not then overcome by open force: making us a ^how to dissolve all Forces on
either side that they might lay the Foundation of a more dureable war, by
setting strong Garrisons on the Border, receiving ^he strong holds of the
Kingdom to be kept after that condition they were in before these troubles
began, and presently preparing them for nests of violence to the chief parts of
the Kingdom: Calling forth by his Majesty's letters a great number of our
chief men under weak pretenses of business (when all the matters of the treaty
had been ended with a few of that number) unto Barwick, and when some of them
came, keeping matters in the clouds until the rest were come, and sending them
back again like stales to bring in their fellows, and when this did not hold,
laying then plots deep and a far off to entrap some of our principal men, as
God has wonderfully discovered since, and will more and more to the confusion
of these who have been authors and abetters to such base assasinats. And which
has been the masterpiece of their ^ubtill device: suffering the Assembly to
go on and determine all matters of the Kirk that had been in question. The
Commissioner in the Kings name consenting to all the Acts that passed,
promising also to ratify them all in the Parliament that was presently to
follow, plotting hereby that what they gave with the one hand, they would take
away with the other, for this seeming of settling matters in the Assembly, and
withholding the civil sanction of the Parliament for their being and existance
in the Commonwealth, as it would make them really of no effect, so it did gain
a color and pretext to that design they did most intend: that the next
rupture, to which they were preparing, should not be for matters of Religion
which were all settled in the Assembly, as they did allege, but for other
civil differences in the Commonwealth, and truly in all appearance the
matters of the Kirk were settled in that Assembly, with the consent of the
Commissioner, but that wise men began to doubt of the sincerity of the work,
when they found him by his after declarations and explanations digging ^^
posterne to escape and make way, for his after den^all of what had been
concluded. And in these terms the Parliament did begin, and has continued not
to settle the affairs of the Kirk as was promised, and was certainly expected
by us: but to bring in a precedent of servitude (which neither we no^ our
Fathers were acquainted with) and so it has been broken off and adjourned, by
his Majesty's own authority, without consent of the ^states, which is di^^ctly
against the ^aws and prac^is^s of this Kingdom, and contrary to the Articles
of agr^ement: And although our predecessors took another course, yet we came
only with supplications and prayers, and to show our invincible obedience unto
his Majesty, sent up our Commissio^ers to London, who were rejected, and never
seen nor heard, and yet hoping with this unexampled patience to overcome the
malice of our adversaries, we send up again our Commissioners with prop^sitions
that were so just, as that they contained nothing but what was before granted
unto us, under his Majesty's hand and seal, nor could receive any denial from
a picus and just Prince, as being all comprehended in this. And which had been
the sum and subject of all our supplications, protestations, informations,
declarations, from the beginning, namely, that the Fundamental Laws of the
Kingdom, which had been violated, and the Religion which was manifestly
infringed, might in a free Assembly and Parliament be again confirmed, and the
unworthy authors legally questioned, and which had been more expressly set down
in the Articles of pacification, that as there according to the tenor of the
Articles of agreement, all matters civil were to be judged by Parliaments, and
all Ecclesiastical matters by the assemblies of the Kirk: And that as the
Assembly promised by his Majesty had been granted and had concluded the
differences of the Kirk, so his Majesty would not delay or deny the conclusion
of the Parliament, for ratifying the acts of this Assembly, and settling other
differences of the Commonwealth, a^ was fully agreed in that Treaty at the
Kings Camp, yet these propositions and desires being so necessary and vital
unto this Kingdom could find no access unto the ears of the gracious King,
by reason of the powerful diversion of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
Deputy of Ireland, who (strengthened with the high and mighty Faction of
Papists near his Majesty) only side in all matters of^ spiritual and
temporal affairs, and makes the necessity of their service to his Majesty
appear in being the only fit instruments (under the pretext of vindicating his
Majesty's honor) to oppress both the just liberties of his free Subjects, and
the true reformed Religion in all his Kingdoms. In which devilish design, we
have great cause to say they are far advanced, if the granting of a free
Assembly and Parliament to us at this time, which has been the ground of all
our just desires from the beginning, and the conclusion of the Treati^ this
last year, as the only mean to cure all the evils of Kirk and State, and
settle the peace and welfare of both Kingdoms, Prove in the end, as it
appears this day, like the Council of Trent to the Christian Kirk, which was
appointed for reforming, the abuse thereof, yet through the ambition and
covetousness of Kirk-men and the miserable jealousies of the Princes of the
time, who minded more their private end and interest then the cause of Christ
and his Kirk, was found in effect the active engine and instrument to establish
and settle the tyranny of the Pope and his Clergy: wherefore the greater and
more lively are our apprehensions of danger at this time, that all these
c^ooked and cross plots, interchecking one another, in denying a Parliament to
us, where it was promised upon the honor of a King, and for the safety of two
such Nations, in granting it unto you, where it was not expected, for the
reasons that all wise men cannot but remember, and in forcing one upon Ireland,
where none is desired: Giving out Commissions to destroy us before we can
apprehend any other or new guiltiness, but that we have been constant suitors
for the conclusion of the Parliament, and the fulfilling of the Articles of the
treaty, raising our Parliament contrary to the Laws, and the express Articles
of the agreement; enforcing Garrisons upon us, that they might force us to a
necessary denial of such unreasonable demands, and to a necessity to provide
for our selves: that all these, we know, are done and devised to pick a
quarrel, and to be the ground of a false and wyre drawn Remonstrance against
us, and now by the particular instigation of these men we named before, a
mighty army is preparing, and an utter ruin threatened to our Religion and
Country. Lest in regard of these premises, our silence in so necessary a time
should argue a neglect of our duty to God and our King, the safety and honor
of our Conntrey, the peace and ^elfare of both the Nations, what so nearly
trenches to the prejudice and hazard of all these, cannot be longer forborne;
Therefore we profess before the Christian world, and to our dear brethren of
England, especially the representative Body of the Kingdom, now happily
conveyned in both the Houses of Parliament, whom it most concerns, that we
cannot otherwise judge and esteem, but that all these Councels that have been
given of late by these intemperat Counselors, who direct the course of all
affairs, do not only proceed from such persons as to serve their own ends
under color of advancing his Majesty's Prerogative, do weaken Royal power,
and bring the Kingdoms unto confusion, but that they truly are first hammered
in Spain and in the Conclave, and put into the hand of their cunning Artisans
among you, who have ever been a viperous brood, which with tooth and nail,
have assayed to rent the bowels of their own mother, yea who never sooner
learned to obey the Roman Church as their mother, but as soon they acknowledged
the Catholic King for their Father, and their own King for an usurper, if they
think him to be an Heretick^ So that we are persuaded that neither the
invincible Armado of the eighty eight, nor the Gunpowder plot, nor any other
Royal Navy from thence, like unto that which came the other year upon your
coast, (the which ye had the more reason to suspect that it came so unlooked
for and at so unseasonable a time) needs to be attempted any more for the ruin
of this I Will, but only that they be careful (as we doubt not they are) that
the fire of this civil war which has been so long smoking may be once
kindled, and that they be ready underhand to add fuel to the flame, wherein
they will not be wanting, especially where every thing is so near that can
furnish matter, and all is far off that can help to extinguish the same, when
it is once begun, yea, which is worse for us all, when it is apparent, that it
cannot be settled without great hazard even of them that may seem to overcome in
the end: And although that we may justly suspect that this calling of you
together at this time by their suggestion, who have raised this fire of civil
discord in this famous Isle without your consent or advice, be rather to
persuade you to bring oil then water to quench the flame, so that in the heat
of these broils you may be induced to contribute to the overthrow of your best
friends, while they avenge themselves of their enemies: Notwithstanding of
this, we hope that it will not be displeasant unto all good men in these
honorable Assemblies of both houses, that we with great joy of heart and
freedom of spirit profess and declare, as we do this day, that all our
obligations and mutual assurances of love and brothterly kindness are so
nearly twisted and joined together with you in all duties toward God and Man,
Prince and People, that we cannot but have the same friends and foes, either in
the defense of our common safety against foreign foes, or in the maintenance
of our several rights against inward and homebred underminers who are more
dangerous, except we would depart from the only firm rule of our own safety
and preservation. And therefore since in regard of the situation of this whole
Isle, and the Union under one Head, we are all, as it were, one house, if it
fall we shall be all buried in the ruins, we are all imbarqued in one ship, if
it perish or split upon the rocks of division, hardly can we escape: Suffer us
to re^oyce with you in the midst of this storm, for this first sunshine of
comfort and good hope that we see you who are the true Pilots, brought to the
helm: And give us leave to conjure you for the interest we have in the common
adventure of these rich goods, our peace, our liberties, our Religion, which
are all in one hold, that ye abandon not the ship of the Commonwealth in this
tempest, although it did belong to you to have been called when the season was
more calm, and yet let it be the true ground of your comfor^ and
encouragement, that when the sky was clear, you have forewarned our great
Master, of the clouds that were gathering, and although the winds were
invisible then to most, yet to many of your house of Commons, and others also
of all ranks: they that did blow then to gather these clouds together, were
well known, and from what coast they came, and many humble desires and earnest
suites have been made by you to his gracious Majesty, that he would not abandon
his own and the Kingdoms safety, unto the pleasure of men in a voyage full of
dangerous and fearful straits, in the conduct of which, they had nothing but
their own ambition and private gain, for compass and said. And who have thrust
both Prince and people out of the safe harbor of the quiet calm unto this
present storm, wherein they are to make profit of both our shipwreck, if in
this strait it were not allowed to the meanest passenger to give warning of the
imminent danger, we notwithstanding of our place and interest in your welfare
might hold our peace: but since we have been in the first watch, and have
endured the first and greatest torment of this storm, while you have been at
rest; for your assurance that we cannot abandon you, or leave you alone one
your turn, when you are so near to give trial of your courage and skill, you
may perceive by what has passed, that no Assembly nor Parliament, no rotten
Cable, and slipping Anchor of Articles and agreement, whereunto we had fastened
our hopes, can be any road and harbor of safety unto us, so long as both our
enemies sit at the Helm and govern all courses that are to be followed amongst
you. Therefore before we come to advise what are in our judgment the most
^itting means ^or removing of the evils of us both, give us leave to touch in
passing what we apprehend have been the concurrent causes to bring you by
degrees from that height of ^appin^sse, wherein sometime ye were glorious in the
sight of Europe, to this gulf of misery and abasement wherein ye have fallen,
and drawn us by example and imita^i^n, that in this sad repres^n^ment, as in a
dark shade, the glorious light of your appearing day may be more comfortable
and refreshing unto us both, which is the hearty with and assured hope of your
dear Brethren in Scotland, because of the sensible feeling of that great mercy
of God upon themselves, who have been farther in the transgression, and at a
lower ebb in mind and spirit then ye can well imagine before their troubles
began; therefore, because our evils are not of yesterday, and could not have
overflowd the face of this Isle on a sudden, let us search up unto the well
head and period of time, where and when they b^gan first to spring and arise,
when we left to fear others by reason of our Union then began we to have need
to look for evil from our selves: the sub^ile enemies of this Isle knowing
that what was not to be attempted by open force, was to be u^dertaken and
pursued by cunning and secret practices, took the advantage of the humors of
men, following commonly the nature and the conditions of the times, did make
the surfets and ease of peace more dangerous to the life of the Estate, then
the straits and hazards of war had been before, disposing the Subjects to
ease and slavery, an inuring the Prince to follow their appetite and the rules
of uncontrouled power: then began the public ways of honor and rep^tation
to be un^requented: then the use of Parliaments which is the stay and strength
of your Kingdom to be suspected, and so these eyes and ears of the Prince and
People, the great Council of the Land did make way piece and piece to the dark
passages of the corner of a Cabinet, where flattery, malice, envy and
partiality amongst few hands, disguises with ^alse appearances without
control all that comes in their handling, and makes the people miserable, and
the Prince infortunat, since they have gotten ^ooting, Parli^ments have been
called not to ease the grievances of the Subject, but to supply the necessities
of the Prince, and so whereas they should have helped to cur^, they have
increased the diseases of the ESTATE: and because there can be no evil humor
in the Body that can master your skill, if you please to apply fitting
remedies, and what have been formerly in practice, therefore you are made to
disagree amongst your selves about the method of the cure, and when you begin
to incline to an agreement your consultations are broken off, and so by these
means the Common wealth languisheth without hope of relief, the Princes
mistakes and the Peoples grief and burdens do equally increase, and every
breach of a Parliament begets a new grievance and malady to the people, so
much the more dangerous and d^adly, that the Authors of these abuses) when you
use not your courage and constancy to maintain that power and place which your
Predecessors have put in your hands, and whereof the posterity will call you to
account, as a right of entaile and their proper inheritance which cannot be
weakened in your hands without your eternal infamy, and their endless loss)
begin to despise you, and take courage to undermine and blow up the foundation
of your once well settled E^tate: bringing you in contempt with the people, for
the guard of whose liberties you have so long continued, and in hatred with the
Prince, for whose honor and safety it has always been, that none about him
should be more powerful, nor the Laws, and nearer him in place and affection,
then you whose Counsels could not be corrupted by ends: these are they who
bringing you once to mind your own things, and to be careless of the Public,
have teached the Princes, that all the rights and liberties of the Subject, and
the maintenance of them, are doales of grace, and gifts of mere favor
proc^eding from the Prince and not the true birth right of the Subject^ which
they may truly challenge) which are to be continued or changed as there Princes
shall think fit: who have teached Princes to use that maxim in a free Kingdom
to wrong ends: Parliaments are in their power to begin, continue, and break
them off, as they find the fruit of them good or bad, so are they to have their
being, or not to be at all, thus they have done what is in them to make the
Royal authority, which should be like a Sun beam shining for the comfort and
light of others, turn to a Comet and blazing star, a matter of wonder and
admiration for the time, and a prognostic of worse things to follow. Truly the
prerogative of the Prince, which has been kept in veneration, and as a
secret untouched amongst the wisest Princes and the best times; which is that
which the Laws have given him above all private men, for the common safety of
us all, and cannot be used to another end, but for our good, had not suffered
so much in it self, and lost of its proper luster, by the often and common
handling thereof, to the mani^e^^ prejudice of the Subjects right, and the real
weakening of the true Royal power, had it not fallen in some of your Clergies
hand, who to the stain of the Kirk and the bane of the Commonwealth, have
subjected all men, and all Laws, to the appetite of the Prince, of whom they
have the absolute rule, that so under that goodly visour of his Royal power,
they may accomplish at last that great design of the change of the Religion
and government of the Estate which they have so long a^med at: whereof they
cannot fail in this happy conjuncture, where all things promises them good
success. A Prince enraged against his own native people, by their procurement,
who will not be persuaded that they are good Subjests to him, because they are
avowed enemies to them, who have been the destroyers of their Religion, and the
t^oubles of the peace of the Kirk, to whom it is necessary that he forget that
he is their natural Prince, while he remembers that he is advanced to be the
Monarch of the whole I Will, and with whom of necessity he is obliged to continue
in this quarrel, that under the pretext of their rebellion, he may have leisure
to arm, and make the one Kingdom a scourge to the other, while in the end
they both become sl^ves, which if they refuse, he cannot eschew of force to
bring in strang^rs, and use such other power as God has put in his hands by
the doctrine of these good divines, to the establishing of the boundless
government whereat they aim, so by the joint help of the Papist, who are a
strong Faction amongst you of late, and of others, whom they call good
Subjects, and are the greatest number, who while they are going on in any
course to help themselves, cannot think they are accomptable to God or Man for
any wrong they are doing to others, these also concuring who are of great
number and of no small force in any state, who are content to wear fetters
themselves, so they may be of gold, and they have the making of them, or help
thereunto for others, all these meeting together, they cannot miss to effectuat
their designs, and these are they who look at this time to undo us, and hope
assuredly to work you to their ends. And for this effect, as it appears, are
ye called together after so many breaches and breaking up of Parliaments in
England, whereby his Majesty had been deprived of the faithful councels and
free aides of his people heretofore, and the pressures and grievances of the
Subjects daily more and more increased without hope of relief, that all men
(who looked upon the train of affairs, and marked wha^ undue courses had been
taken of late, that there should be no need of their meeting, and how the
number and height of offenders is increased, for whose safety it is not that
Parliaments come in place and request again) may justly marvel to see this
day, and in all likelihood conjecture that either this Parliament will prove
the happiest that ever was in this Isle for the good and peace of the
Kingdoms, or else (which God forbid) will become the fatal engine and
axletree in our enemies hand, for the overthrow of Kirk and State, turning our
doubts unto despaires, and our fears into a certainty of confu^ion. Wherefore
the more need have all good men who love the truth of Religion, the honnour of
the King, the safety of the Kingdoms in so necessary and perilous a time to
be instant with God by Fasting and Prayer^ that as the beginning of your
meeting together is the subject of all men's fears and hopes, good or bad, ^o
the close may be in fruit and memory^ the joy of the present age, and the
blessing of posterity, whereof there is no small ground of hope at this time;
For if that spirit of wisdom, courage, and true zeal for the good of
Religion, and safety of King and Kingdoms do but begin as in former time to
appear in your Councels, who knows what recompense God is preparing for your
often disappointments in that kind: the which we are moved ^he rather to
believe and expect, that the powerful h^nd of God has forcibly led them who
have been the authors of your evils, and actours in the mischief intended
against us; against their will to call for your assistance to oppress us: and
su^ely we think that what Art can invent, and malice can do, will not be
wanting (even amongst some of your number) to move the rest to consider aright
of all the advantages of the time, and reconceal the differences that are
amongst themselves and labor to seek the ease of your own burdens when you
may have them at an easy rate with small expense and pains, to increase ours,
and many specious pretenses will be offe^ed, to hide the bad intentions of a
few, and the ill consequences of their private designs against the public
quiet of the Kingdoms, but certainly a thick cloud of prejudices and
misrepresenta^ions of all our businesses most assuredly be casten before your
e^es, and great must that darkness be, before so wise, so advised a
judicatorie of all the choice wits in that Kingdom condescend to that
resolution which in effect carries with it, in furthering the overthrow of our
Religion and Liberties, and in the burial thereof to begin and dig a Tomb for
your own to follow, and to make the end of this Parliament a mean that there
should never be need of any hereafter. But we expect (Right Honorable) better
things of you, and such as belong properly to the happiness of this time, for
the glory of God in the advancement of his truth, for the honor of the King in
punishing of the wicked, for the welfare of the Kingdoms, that in our Union
they may be crushed, who in our division have builded their hopes, and made
this war with your Brethren, the Trojan horse to bring in all these
calamities, which a Civil war will undoubted^y enforce upon this I Will, and we
are certainly persuaded that the singular wisdom and justice of your
Honou^able Court, which can have no other end in all their Counsel, but the
service of his Majesty, and the safety of his Kingdoms (which cannot be
separated in any consideration whatsoever) will judge otherwise of the state of
our affairs, and afford us better measure then we have found as yet at the
hands of these men, who as they have been the Authors of our evil, and of that
corruption that was creeping in, in Kirk and State, so have both you and we
suffered much more by them, and have greater reason to complain of the
inconvenience and mischie^ of the remedy that they have applied since, then of
the disease it self: In vain do they think to cover their wicked designs
with the bare pretext of their zeal and affection to his Majesty's greatness
and dignity, seeing it tends to the ruin and destruction of his faithful
Subjects, whose riches is his treasure, whose quiet is his glory, whose hearts
and affections are his strong garrisons that cannot be overcome, and whose
pr^sperity is the happiness of his Crown, and miserable and wretched are the
effects of that power, which produces nothing but weakness to the Prince, and
calamity to his Subjects, and in vain do we expect that God will bless in our
age what he has cursed in all ages before. Let us look unto the Records of
former ages, and we shall ever find, that there is not any thing that does so
much move the wrath of God, as to see his worship and Churches profaned, and to
fall into the hands of these who have sold themselves to the world, and are
devouted to the Temporal service of the Prince: where ever it has been
practiced, it is a certain demonstration of the alteration and change of an
Estate, and of their miseries and disgrace who abuse it licentiously, their
affairs always declining even unto their end. We need not put you in mind of
the stu^^es and hot contests of your best Princes, and of greatest spiri^^ with
your Archbishops at home, to keep down that Papac^^ they claymed to themselves
amongst you, and to suffer them to be Kings beside them, which could not be
granted but at their discretion: they that looked to the dangers of this time,
and who they are that be the Authors of this mischief intended, may easily
perceive, that if all the Subjects of the two Kingdoms could be moved to
undergo that burden the Bishop of Canterbury and his followers would put upon
us, and could be peswaded in Conscience, that we were bound to obey these
spiritual Fathers in all their commands, we should soon see they would allege
some other ground for their aspiring greatness, then the zeal of his
Majesty's service and honor, and the Princes that are to follow would find,
that all their pains was for themselves, and to establish their own tyranny
over Prince and People. Or, are there any so ignorant and wilfully blind to
think, that all that spite and malice they carry to the Covenant of Scotland^
is, because that it has weakened the Kings power, and made his Majesty appear
so in the sight of his enemies? If this were true, then would the Pope and the
King of Spain give many millions that the like were in England and Ireland:
they need not dissemble, we know where it pricks them, they see the hand of God
in it against their unjust usurpation and worldly pomp, and they fear, that as
they have found it a wall of brass to the Subjects of Scotland against the
fury of their malice, when they could have no protection, neither in their
Laws, nor in their Prince, in whose saving favor they may claim special
interest, so it may prove by example dangerous to them elsewhere, and at once
put an end to all these plots and designs they have to overthrow the reformed
Religion: And this is the cause they charge it and us with many crimes, to
plant the hatred of us and that cause in the hearts of others, which is already
engraven in theirs, but we are assured the equity, justice, and wisdom of
your Court will be far from thinking this a sufficient ground of quarrel
betwixt the two Nations, because we demand to enjoy the benefit of our Laws,
and the exercise of our Religion, if this be a cause that any of your Nation
should come to assail us, or any part of the power of that Kingdom should be
employed to that use, you would not have taken it in ill part or think we have
done you wrong, if the like course had been taken by us when there were any
contests and dispute betwixt his Majesty and you in your Parliaments for the
rights of the Subject: But as we have always wished you good success unto
your Pa^liaments, so can we not think that the pains we have taken to maintain
our own rights, can be grievances unto you, or of evil example to weaken your
estate, or move you to destroy us. Princes when they are misled by evil
counsel, may easily begin war at their pleasure, but since the Subjects
blood must determine the controversy, it were necessary that they who have so
great a part of the hazard, should also know their quarrel. And since civil
war and homebred division^ as inward diseases are more hard to cure then
these that are without, we are tied in all respects to seek to prevent them
before thy come. And whereas by all that has passed, we may perceive that these
who are chief actors in these troubles, ^eek by all means to have us engaged,
the more should our care be to preserve our selves by their disappointment, and
by a seasonable remedy, provide for the safety of our selves and posterity. The
readiest mean for the present that can come in our consideration in this, that
as when the treaty of the Union was intended, but did not take effect, the two
Parliaments did sit, and did appoint their Commissioners to treat thereanent
(with express reservation of their own Laws and Liberties) and to report
their proceedings back again to them that sent them, so now when the two
Nations are ready to be plunged in a bloody war, to the overthrow of the
Liberties of both. Our souls desires, that his Majesty would be pleased to
appoint the like or any other mean whereby the Parliaments may sit freely, and
without fear of force, and by their Commissioners appoint time and place,
where by their scanning the equity or inquity of our demands may be fully
weighed, that we may no longer suffer by false and artificial relations, but
they be noturly known as they are, and their fraud and hypocrisy discovered
(if there be any) for we shun no trial which is not inconsistent with a free
and independent Kingdom, and which the Kingdom of England would choose in the
like case of the quarreling of their Laws and liberties, the King being
resident amongst us: for which end if his Majesty's forces may be discharged,
and his further Levies suspended, we will most gladly disband, and leave off
any that we are preparing for our own necessary and just defense, which
otherwise we cannot do without our own apparent ruin, neither can the
Parliament sit with any security in either Kingdom, if they see a Sword drawn
ove^ their heads, and this we know the Parliament of England in their wisdom
will think very reasonable, and the least that can be granted, and will join
with us in this pe^ition for their own clearing before God and the world, that
they have not taken in hand to subdue us by arms, before they have convinced
us and made known to all true Christians and honest men, for what cause, and
upon how great reason.

If this be denied us, as what may we not expect in this kind, but that the
conduct of this affai^e will be answerable to the first undertaking: And as
this plot has been set on foot for the benefit of strangers, so it will be
continued to the weakening of both the Kingdoms the overthrow of our Religion,
and civil liberties, to the uttermost of their power. So we (that the close of
this discourse may bring in a short view all that has been touched before)
cannot but begin with this, that it is j^st with God to make us feel the sad
e^fects of civil discord, who have not ma^e the right use of our long enjoyed
peace, and that we suffer in the danger and hazard of the cure, who have so
long by our tollerance and permission strengthened that ill humor, which is now
ready to master the life both of Kirk and State. You are called together who
are the great Physicians of that State, it is not unfitting for the present
occasion to put you in mind of an old t^le that belongs unto your Art:
Philotimus a Physician in Greece, made this answer to one who offered his
finger to dress, by whose face, look and breath, he knew he had an Impostume
in his Lungs, my friend (says he) it is not fit time t^ busy your self about
your nails: The time was not long since when the grea^est question was,
whether the Bill of Tunnage and Poundage, or the Bill of the Subjects right
should be first moved in your House; the times are far changed, the case much
altered, before you judge of any matters now, or condemn others^ you cannot but
look whether your selves be free, and what right you have: For if the
maintenance of our Religion, and the Liberties of the Kingdom, be a ground of
a quarrel betwixt too Nations that are so nearly joined, and if it be judged
so in that Honorable Court, we cannot see how you can condemn us and acquit
your selves; For it was your glory to be the faithful guardians of the
Subjects right, it cannot but blemish your reputation to be sound now the
overthrowers of your Brethrens liber^ies. If all this motion of a war with
Scotland were truly perceived to be a conception of Spain or Rome, we do not
doubt but for your own interest you would be careful to stra^gle this monster
in the very first birth; but if you take it for a ready mean to ^ase your own
distressed estate, and that by wronging us you can better your condition. And
although we know the cond^ct of your Councels had ever more honorable and
honest grounds, yet let us take it as it may be propounded to you: can the
benefit that is offered to you countervail your loss: We need not bring it
nearer, the example is but of yeste^dy, and cannot be out of your sight. All
the Provinces and Prince of France, envyed the good estate of the Protestants,
the priviledge^ of their Chambers, and the ben^fit of the Edicts they enjoyed,
every one did outrunne another to contribute to their ^uine, and to endeer
themselves by so doing, to these that had the managing of all these affairs;
with what success, they know this day, and all that looks upon them, sees
what defense they have left themselves against the regiments of the guards. We
writ not this as doubting your wisdom and circumspection in a business of
this nature, that so near concerns your selves, but since the malice of our
adversaries has prevailed so far upon our gracious King, that he forgets the
affliction of his people, whiles he gives way unto their endless malice, who
seeks by all means to cut asunder that knot of our obedience, whereby we are
tied in Conscience of our duty to his Majesty, to the observance of the Laws:
and which is the sure Foundation of his Majesty's greatness, and the Union of
the Kingdoms, and which has holden fast-against all the violence of time in
so many ages past, and against the force of all adversaries whatsoever to the
Royal Crown, the which the more we labor to preserve, and fence, the more
they seek to undo, and to put in the place thereof a chain of violence and
force.

We beseech you therefore, right honorable and dear Brethren, now conv^ened in
both houses of Parliament, that according to your place and s^ation, you will
hear from our selves the true representation of our pressing grievances, and
because a link of that chain cannot but approach you also, if it take hold on
us: we entreat you to divert in time our gracious King from running headlong
unto these violent courses, which cannot but produce in the end lamentable
effects both for Prince and People. And since we have just cause of fear, that
what has been begun without your consent, will also be followed contrary to
your advise, although we think nothing more properly does belong unto to the
justice of that high Court then ^o provide, that they who have been drawers of
his Majesty t^ this action, so dangerous for himself, and so desperate for the
Kingdoms should not pass away unquestioned and unpunished. And nothing could
be further from our expectation then that the Council of England should
conclude a war against us, upon the relation of one man ^brought upon the
stage of purpose to act that malicious part) without your consent^ whereby it is
apparent, that these our adversaries have come to that height of insolency, to
let all the Subjects see that they have taken to themselves a liberty to throw
down the Laws of the Kingdom, and laid a necessity upon us his Majesty's own
people, as it were to choose their leisure and attend until they have power,
and come and work our overthrow by Sea and Land, and that without a warning
going before: So now we understand that a restraint is put upon our
Commissio^ers; Some of them being put in the hands of Sheriffs, some of
Justices of peace at London, Contrary to our expectation, for who expecting
this would either have send or gone in that Commission: Contrary to the Law of
Nations, for we are two dive^se Nations and Kingdoms, and they were sent from
a Parliament promised and called by his Majesty, and warranted by his Majesty,
to repair to his presence, and to show the reasons of our demands. Contrary to
the very foundation of our present Treaty, for a Committee was appointed
legally by the authority of the Parliament, and neces^arily, for keeping
correspondence with our Commissioners, and to receive from them his Majesty's
answers (that we wonder any man should be so absurd as to suggest to his
Majesty, that it is an unlaw^ull or presumptuous Committee, or that they have
taken upon them the government of the Town of Edinburgh) And that for a long
time past, no word or writ comes from them, and we are put out of hope to
hear from them hereafter^ That we can neither know whether there was any want
in their propositions and reasons, or whether there was any thing to be
supplied by us for a ^ull satisfaction, and contrary to the deservings of our
Commissioners: for nothing is pretended to have escaped them which might have
deserved this captivity: And as for the present condition of safety of the
Earl of Southesk, and Sir Jews Stewart at Edinburgh, it can be no true ground
there of, his Majesty being fully informed by their own Letters, how that
harmless accident of their surprizall came on a sudden by the unexpected
folly and rashness of the Governor of the Castle, threatening presently upon
their dispatch, to discharge all his Ordinance against the Town: And to ring
(as he was pleased to speak) an uncouth peale of bells in their ears, and (we
may truly add) by their own precipitation, and too great haste to speed
themselves to the Ports for escaping the common danger: The multitude not
without their own grounds, conceived that the arresting of them might be a
defense to themselves, or at least a delay of the Governors fury. But no
sooner were they arrested by the People, but they were rescued by order from
the Magistrate, and courteously used by such of the Nobility and Gentry as
were in the Town. Since that time no violence has been done against them, but
they have of their own accord, and for their own safety stayed in the Town,
with such liberty as they think meet to use to repair to the Streets, Kirk,
Gardens, or whither they will. And in what equity can a particular tumult of
some ^ew Commons in one City, reflex upon the persons of the Commissioners sent
from the whole Parliament o^ the whole Nation.

But at the writing hereof we are advertised, that the matter draws a greater
deep, and that the Lord Lowdoun is committed to the Tower, not upon the shallow
pretext of safety to any arrested here, but upon his own guiltines, his hand
and subscription being found at a Letter directed to the French King from
certain Earls and Lords of Scotland, for imploring his assistance to their
courses: This by our adversaries and such as had decreed our destruction
before, is already exaggerat and raised to a mountain, not only to fall upon
the Lord Lowdoun and others whose hands are found in it, but that all former
friends and all indifferent persons may stumble at our Cause, as hereby
evidenced to be nothing less forsooth then Religion: But the Honorable Houses
of Parliament, who are acquainted with the designs and malice of our enemies,
and to whom our innocence in times past cannot altogether be unknown, are more
grave and wise then upon the hearing or seeing of such a Letter, to precipitate
in judgment against us and our Nation before we be heard. For their
satisfaction, and for vindicating our-selves, we are constrained against our
hearts in this our Remonstrance, to remember and represent the words of that
unexempled Proclamation given at York April 25. 1639. otherwise never to have
been resented, but buried in silence, and in studied senselesnes, and which we
do not attribute to the Majesty of our King, but to the base cruelty of our
barbarous enemies. The words are thus:

We are forced to have r^course to a more ^harp and quick way to cure their
obstinancy and rebellion by the sword of justice: And therefore in that case we
do proclaim all such as shall reject this our free and grat^ous pardon, and
does not return before the said eight days, to that civil and dutiful
obedience to be from thenceforth open Rebels and Traitors to us, our Crown and
dignity, and declare all their lands and possessions, goods and geir to be
forfeited to us, and our Crown, and that we shall dispose of their lands,
possessions, goods and geir to our well deserving Subjects, Noblemen, Gentlemen,
and others who shall adhere to us, and obey our just commands. And to this
purpose we discharge all vassals and tennants to any rebels, from making
paym^nt to them of any of their rents, duties, or casualties, and require them
to keep the same in their hands, the one ha^f^ whereof shall be kept for our
use, the other half for themselves: promising also to the tennants of the said
rebels, who shall leave their Misters, and assist us to the maintenance of our
authority, good terms of years in the estates they poss^sse, with the
dimunition of the third at least, if not more, of the duties they pay, as we
shall find them to deserve by their good service and ready obedience to us: And
to the vass^ls of such superiors as are rebels, that they shall become our
immediate tennants and vassals, and hold their lands and poss^ssi^ns of us, and
that for payment of the third part less duty then is contained in their
present Charters, and they pr^sently pay to their superior, providing they
adhere to us, and assist not their disloyal superiors, but leave them, and
concur with us for maintenance of our authority And if the superior be
loyal, and the vassals and tennants refuse this our Grace, and to adhere to
us^ or to concur with the said superior in our ser^ice, we declare it shall
be leasume for the said superior to expel the said vassals and tennants thus
rebellious, forth of their lands and possessions. And what shall access to us
by the forfeiture of their lands and possesssions, we freely d^sp^ne and
totally resign it to the loyal superior, promising to concur and assist
him for effectuating hereof. And further we discharge all debtors who are
addebted sums of money to any of the said rebels, to make payment to them of
the sums of money addebted to them, or any part thereof: assuring our good
Subjects, that they shall have retribution out of the same moneys as we shall
find them to deserve: and so forth as follows.

Although before this time we had heard from our Contrymen abroad, that
other States, Princes and Nations did wonder much that their ears being filled
with Informations against us, nothing had come from us to make known unto them
ou^ cause, or our case and condition: yet s^ill hoping and patiently waiting
for a gra^i^us answer to our many humbl^ supplications, we did abstain. But
our hopes being extingished by that unexpected Declaration, as we took our
Swords in our hands at home for our just d^f^nce, so we were thinking to send
some Informations and Petitions abroad, especially to the Frenc^ King, wherein,
we tr^st, no word has escaped us, that can either procure the indignation of
our own King, or will be found contrary to the duty and loyalty of good
Subjects. And that no less could have been said by any Nation, in so great
extremity: yet this was but an imperfect motion, which died in the bud amongst
our selves, and never did rise to that ripeness to be seen of others. When we
were so sore threatened, and when execu^ion was coming upon us by a terrible
army, it must be laid to our charge as a fault inexpiable^ and our
Commis^ioners punished for it, that we dared so much as to intend to cry to
others to interceed for us, when our own supplications could not be heard:
Poor souls^ we must be beat^n, and neither resist, nor complain^: It is
therefore our earnest desire that every eye that sees that innocent Letter, may
with the same view look upon the Proclamation given out at that ^ime, and
compare them together: And withal, we desire to be informed what we shall do
in the like exigence now when Armies are coming against us, if it be not
lawful for us both to cry to God and to men to help us, and to interceed with
our King for us. That Letter was written before his Majesty's coming to the
Camp, and was not concealed by our Nobleme^, but made known to some of prime
quality there: If there had been a purpose in ^he hearts of our enemies, that
the Articles of pacification should have been observed, this Letter^ although
it had been sent and all other quarrels of this kind, had been by a law of
oblivion forbidden to appear. It could not have been a ground of calling the
subcribers to quarrel them after the pacification, but the wicked Sycophant
and delatour would have been found in the transgression, and made the
sacrifice. And that there be no more doubt in the mind of any good man, we
have here, upon our faith and honor, set down the very words of our
instructions ^ub^cribed at that time^ and yet ex^ant^ which were not given, but
were to be given to the Carrier^ and unto the which the Le^ter i^self does
refer:

To represent the ^uncient^ and strait league betwixt the two King^^mes of
France, and Sco^land, often renewed, and (...) invi^l^^l^ kept, for many
hundredth of years, whereby both Nations, have frequently upon the distress of
the one found the benefit of that mutual amity, by ready succor and
assistance of the other, which has ^ver been crowned with success, and
acknowledged by interchange of National kindness as the Chronicles of both
Kingdoms, and diverse public act^ extant in the Records do testify.

To show that our intentions are no ways against Monarchiall government, but
that we are most loyally disposed toward our sacred Sovereign, whose person
and authority we will maintain with our lives and fortunes: But that all our
desires reaches no further then the preservation of our Religion, and Liberty
of Church and Kingdom, established by the Laws and Constitu^ions thereof.

That the calumnies vented against us by our enemies for their own ends make no
impression, because they are most manifest untruths, maliciously forged to
stir the envy and coffeehouse of neighbor Princes, Estates and Nations
against us^ whera^ our whole thought^, words, actions and proceedings are most
legal and loyal, as the bearer can particularly instruct and make clear at
length.

That seeing we have many times supplicat his Majesty, and have not prevailed,
therefore to entreat the King of France, to interceede and meditate with our
Sovereign, to lay down his Armies, intended and raised against us, and to
suffer this his ancient and native Kingdom to enjoy her Religion, and
Liberties, in peace and freedom under his Majesty's authority, albeit we be
not diffident of Gods assistance whenever we shall be necessitate to our own
defense, which is approven both by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations.

Our enemies, who catch all pretexts against us, may have enough here wherewith
to please themselves. But when tha^ grave and great Council shall consider
that the Letter was never sent, and nothing from France or at home shall ever
be found that can prove the sending of it abroad, that it was intended upon the
hearing of so harsh a Proclamation, and before the pacification, wherein it
ought to have been buried, and that it was accompanied with such Instructions,
as no^e but malice it self can censure: for no threats from England, non
preparations in view, can cast us upon resolutions of intertaining foreign
confoederations, in such sort as may set up a partition wall betwixt the two
Kingdoms; Therefore we trust they shall find no more ground of pleasing our
enemies, and of grieving us in this, then in our other proceedings, which we
earnestly desire to be unpartially examined by them.

Now against this high and extreme insolency of our adversaries, which
swells every day to a greater bigness and exulceration, and is to break out
imperiously at their pleasure. Although in obedience to the Law of God and
nature, we be thinking upon our preparations for safety and defense, and ^or
obtaining our often presented humble and just desires, yet nothing but extreme
necessity which has no Law, shall enforce us to go beyond the bounds of
petition and d^f^nce, and when that extreamities shall come (which God in his
mercy to both Kingdoms prevent) we trust our carriage shall refute the
s^anders and reproaches of our enemies: that we are not seeking our selves and
our own ends: but with the assistance o^ all in England, who tender their own
happiness and ours, to petiti^n his Majesty the more powerfully, for receiving
right information, and for submitting both all differences, and all those
wicked Counselors, who have shaken ^he foundations of the Kirk, State, and the
Kings Throne, unto the judgment and censure of a free Par^iament, by which we
hope the Gospel of Christ shall be enlarged, both the Kingdoms freed from
danger, and our dread Sovereign made more great and glorious, then any of his
Predecessors, which, as it is the end, so it is the un^eigned Prayers o^ us all.

FINIS.
