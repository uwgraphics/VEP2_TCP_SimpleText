O My lord Jesus Christ true God and man, my Creator and Redeemer, thou being
whom thou art, and for that I love thee above all things, it grieueth me from
the bottom of my heart, that I have offended thy divine Majesty: Lo here I
firmly purpose never to sin any more: and to fly all occasions of offe^ding
thee: and to confess my sins, and fulfill the penna^ce, which shall be enjoined
me for the same. And for love of thee, I do freely pardon all my enemies: and
do offer my life, my words, and works in satisfaction for my sins. Wherefore
I most humbly beseech thee, trusting ^n thy infinite goodness and mercy, that by
the merits of thy precious blood and Passion, thou would pardon me, and give
me grace to amend my life, and to persevere therein until death. Amen.

The Hymn.
BEFORE the lightsome day expire
Creator of al, we the^ require,
That of thy wonte^ clemency,
Thou keep us in thy custody.
Let dreams from us pass far away,
And nightly fantasies decay;
Our ghostly foe likewise restrain,
Least that our bodies foul remain.
Heavenly Father to this accord,
Through Jesus Christ ^ur only Lord;
Who does for all e^ernity,
Reign with the ho^y Ghost and thee. Amen.
Save us, O Lord, waking, and keep us sleeping: that we may wake in Christ, and
rest in peace.

Keep us, O Lord, as the apple of the eye: and protect us under the shadow of
thy wings.

Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this Night without sin.

Have mercy upon us O Lord, have mercy upon us. Let thy mercy, O Lord, come
upon us, even as we have trusted in thee.

O Lord hear my prayer: and let my cry come unto thee.

The Prayer.
VISIT we beseech thee, O Lord, this habitation, and repel far from it all
snares of the enemy: let thy holy Angels dwell therein, who may keep us in
peace: and thy blessing be upon us for ever. Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Ame^.

O Angel of God, who art my keeper, enlighte^, guard, rule, and govern me
this night, committed unto thee, by the supernall piety. Amen.

The blessing.
Almighty, and our merciful Lord, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy

THese hours, o B. Joseph in good part

FINIS.
A PREPARATORY PRAYER Before Sacramental Confession.
O Maker of heaven and earth, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who have made me
of nothing unto thy Image and similitude, and have redeemed me with thy own
precious blood, whom I a sinner am not worthy to name, nor call upon, nor yet
to think of, in heart. I meekly beseech thee, and humbly pray thee, that thou
would respect with clemency me thy wicked servant. And have mercy upon me,
who tookest pity upon the woman of Canaan, and Mary Magdalen: who spard'st the
Publican, and the Thief ha^ging upon the Cross.

To thee I confess, O most loving Father, my sins, which, O Lord, if I would
I cannot hide from thee. Spare me, o christ whom I have lately much offended in
thinking, speaking, and doing, and by all the ways in which I frail worm and
a sinner might offend through my fault, through my fault, thorogh my most
grievous fault. Therefore, O Lord, I beseech thy Clemency, who came down
from heaven for my salvation, who liftedst up David from the fall of sin,
spare me o Lord, spare me o Christ who sparedst Peter denying thee. Thou art my
Creator, and my Redeemer, my Lord, and my Savior, my King, and my God. Thou
art my hope, and my trust, my stay, and my help, my consolation, and my
fortitude; my defense, and my deliverance; my life, my salvation, and my
resurrection; my light, and my desire; my aid, and my patronage. I beseech and
pray thee help me, and I shall be safe: govern me, and defend me; comfort, and
consolate me; confirm and glad me; enlighten me, and visit me. Raise me being
dead, because I am thy creature and work. O Lord, despise me not, for that I
am thy servant and vassal: and although evil, although unworthy and a sinner,
yet such as I am, whether good or evil, always I am thine. Unto whom shall I
fly, except I go to thee? If thou cast me off, who will receive me? If thou
despise me, who will behold me? Re-acknowledge me therefore though unworthy
returning unto thee. For if I am vile, and unclean, thou can cleanse me: if
I be blind, thou can enlighten me: if I be feeble, thou can heal me^ if I
be dead and burryed, thou can revive me, because thy Mercy is greater then my
iniquity: greater is thy piety, then my impiety: more thou can pardon, then I
commit: and more thou can forgive, then I a sinner offend. Therefore o Lord
despise me not, nor yet regard the multitude of my iniquities, but according to
the multitude of thy co^miserations have mercy on me, a most grievous sinner.
Say to my soul, I am thy salvation; who said^st: I will not the death of a
sinner, but rather that he be converted and live: turn me, O Lord unto thee,
and do not extend thine anger against me. I beseech thee* o most clement
Father, for thy mercy, I bow down and earnestly pray thee, that thou direct me
unto a good end, and unto true penance, pure confession, and worthy
satisfaction, for all my sins. Amen.

Another Prayer before Sacramental Confession.
Receive my confession O most benign, and most clement Lord (...) Christ, the
only hope of the salvation of my soul, and give unto me (I beseech thee)
contrition of heart, and tears to mine eyes, that I may bewail day and night
all my negligences with humility and purity of heart. Let my prayer o Lord,
approach near in thy sight. If thou shall be angry against me, what helper may
I seek? who will have mercy upon mine iniquityes? Remember me, O Lord, who
did call the woman of Canaan, and the Publican to repentance, and did
receive Peter weeping. O Lord my God, accept my prayers: O good Jesus, Savior of
the world, who gave thy self to the death of the cross, that thou might
save sinners, regard me a wretched sinner, calling upon thy Name, and regard
not so my wickedness that thou forget thy goodness. And if I have committed
ought, whereby thou may condemn me, yet thou have not lost that whereby thou
art wont to save. Spare me therefore, o Lord who art my Savior, and take mercy
on my sinful soul. Loose the band thereof, and heal the wounds, O Lord
Jesus. I desire thee, I seek thee, I will thee: show me thy face, and I shall
be safe. Send forth therefore, o most loving Lord (through the merits of the
most pure and immaculate ever Virgin Mary thy Mother, and thy Saints) thy
light, and thy truth into my soul, which may show unto me truly all my
defects, which it behooves me to confess; and which may help and teach me to
express the^ fully, and with contrite heart. Who live and raignest God, world
without end. Amen.

A BRIEF METHOD OF CONFESSION,
For those that frequent the same often.
HE that is accustomed to confess often, must be very careful of four
things. 1. Of the due exame^ of his Conscience. 2. Of compunction and sorrow
for his sins. 3. Of the confession it self, that it brief and humble, and
sincere. 4. Of full purpose and true endeavor to amend.

This done let him come humbly to his Ghostly Father, and kneeling down at his
feet, say: Benedicite. Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti etc in Latin or English, as he
best can until the words, Mea culpa etc. Then say.

First I accuse my self, that I come to this Sacrament of Penance not so well
prepared as I ought to do: for which I ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not had such sorrow, and repentance for my sins
past as I ought: for which I ask God hattily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not used such diligence in the daily examining
of my conscience, and amendment of my life, as I ought to have done: for which
I ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have greatly offended Almighty God, in that I have
not given him due thanks for all his benefits that I have received continually
at his hands, for which I ask him heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not loved and served him with such fear, and
reverence, and humility of mind in all things, as I ought to have done: for
which I ask him heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not made my prayers unto him, with that
alacrity and fervor of spirit as I ought, but have been very often, and
voluntarily distracted, slouthful, and could in my prayers, devotions, and all
other pious works, and exercises: for which I ask him also heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, for that I have been proud and vain glorious in my inward
thoughts and cogitations: for which I ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, for that I have been very negligent in putting away evil
thoughts of sundry sorts, and have not endeavored to keep my mind occupied in
lawful and Godly exercises, nor thought so humbly of my self, as I should
have done: for which I ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not kept my senses in such narrownes and
custody, as I ought to have done, especially my eyes, and my ears: for which I
ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, for that I have not spoken of other men, and their
affairs, with that care, charity, and affection, as I should have done, but
rather have discovered their defects: for which I ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not behaved my self so modestly in my actions,
and conuersations as I should have done, but have spent many hours idly in
desports, laughing, and idle discourses, without profit to my self or others:
for which I ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that in my works I have not purely sought Gods honor and
glory, but rather some worldly respect, or selfe-content ^herein: for which I
ask God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have not frequented the holy Sacraments of
Confession, and Communion with that due preparation and reverence, as I ought
to have done: nor heard Mass, or other spiritual Exhortations with that
attentio^, and devotion, as was fit for such divine mysteryes: for which I ask
God heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that I have been angry, melancholy, froward, stubborn,
and very troublesome to others often times without cause: for which I ask God
heartily pardon.

I accuse my self, that in my talk and other discourses, I have not been so
careful to keep my tongue from uttering of some untruths, nor from swearing by
Faith and Troth without necessity: for which I ask God heartily pardon.

For these, and all my other sins and transgressions, wherinsoeuer, and
howsoever else, I have offended my Lord God: and also for those that at this
present I have forgotten, and through my negligence cannot call to remembrance,
I ask him heartily pardon and forgiveness, and of you my Ghostly Father,
pe^nance, and absolution. Ideo precor Beatam Mariam etc. Or, Therefore I
beseech the blessed etc.

If besides this ordinary method of Confession, thou shall feel thy conscience
troubled or burdened with these, or any other sin, mortal or venial, thou
must express them distinctly and orderly, withal their due circumstances, to
the end thy Ghostly Father may truly judge of them, (...) ^posing condign
penance, may absolve thee, according to the rites of the holy Catholic Church.

A short prayer to be said presently after absolutio.
LET, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee, this my Confession be grateful and
acceptable unto thy divine Majesty, by the merits of (...) bitter death, and
passion and by the (...) of thy Blessed Mother, and all the Saints. And that
whatsoever, now, or at other times has been wanting in me, either to the
sufficiency of Contritio^, or to the purity and integrity of my Confession, let
thy piety, and mercy, O Lord, supply the same; and according thereunto,
vouchsafe to absolve me more fully and perfectly in heaven. To whom be all
honor and glory world without end. Amen. Sweet Jesus, Amen.

A PRAYER BEFORE Receiving the B. Sacrament.
O Most benign Lord Jesus Christ, I a sinner presuming nothing on mine own
merits* but trusting on thy mercy and goodness do fear, and tremble to have
access to the table of thy most sweet banquet* For I have a heart, and body
spotted with many crimes: a mind and tongue not warily guarded.

Therefore o benign deity, o dreadful majesty, I a wretch holde^ in the^e
straites, have recourie unto thee the fountain of mercy, I haste^ to thee to
be healed, I fly under thy protection: and he whom I cannot endure, a Judge, I
hope to have a Savior. To thee, O Lord I show my wounds: to thee I discover my
shame. I know my sins to be many, and great, for which I fear. I trust in thy
mercyes, which are without number: look down upon me with the eyes of thy
mercy, o lord Jesus christ eternal King, God and man, crucified for man. Hear
me graciously hoping in thee: have mercy upon me full of wretchedness and sin:
thou that wilt never restrain the fountain of thy piety to flow. All hail
healthful sacrifice, offered upon the tree of the Cross for me, and all
mankind. All hail, O noble and pretions blood gushing out of the wou^des of
my Lord Jesus Christ crucified, and washing away the sins of the whole world.
Remember, O Lord thy Creature, whom thou have redeemed with thy blood: it
repents me, that I have sinned, I desire to amend that which I have done.
Take away then from me, O most clement Father, al mine iniquities, and
offenses, that purified in mind and body, I may deserve worthily to taste the
holy of holyes: and grant that this holy tasting of thy body and blood, which
I unworthy, desire to receive, may be a remission of my sins, a perfect
purgation of my crimes, a driving away of filthy cogitations, and a
re-engendring of good thoughts, and also wholesome efficacy of works pleasing
to thee, and withal a most firm protection of soul and body aagainst the
deceiptes of my enemies. Amen.

Another prayer before receiving the B. Sacrament.
ALmighty and eternal God, behold I come to the Sacrament of thy only begotten
Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. I repair as one being sick unto the Phisitia^ of
life, as one unclean unto the fountain of mercy, as one blind to the light
of perpetual brightness, as one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and
earth. I besiech thee therefore by the abou^dance of thy infinite bounty, that
thou would vouchsafe to cure my infirmitity, to wash my filth, to enlighten
my blindness, to enrich my poverty, to cloth my nakedness: that I may receive
thee, the bread of Angels, King of Kings, Lord of lords, with so great
reverence and humility, with so great contrition and devotion, with so great
purity and faith, with such purpose and intent, as is expedient for the health
of my soul: grant me I beseech thee, not only to receive the Sacrament of our
Lords body, and blood, but also the thing and virtue thereof. O God most meek,
grant me so to take the body of thy only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
which he took of the Virgin Marie; that I may deserve to be incorporated to
his mystical body, and accounted among the members thereof. O most loving
Father, grant me for ever with open face to behold thy beloned Son, whom now
covered in this wayfare, I desire to receive. Who together with thee, and the
Holy Ghost etc.

A Prayer after receiving the B. Sacrament.
I Give thee thanks, O holy Lord, Father almighty, eternal God, who have
vouchsafed to replenish me a sinner thy unworthy servant, through no merits of
mine, but by the only vouchsafing of thy mercy, with the precious body and
blood of thy son our Lord Jesus Christ; and I beseech thee, that this holy
receiving, may not be to me as a guilt unto punishment, but as a wholesome
intercession unto pardon. Let it be to me an armor of faith, and a shield of
good will: let it be a cleansing of al my vices, a driuer out of concupiscence
and lust, an increase of Charity, patience, humility, and obedience: a firm
defense against the wiles of all enemies, as well visible as invisible, a perfect
quieting of my motions as well carnal as spiritual, a firm cleaving unto
thee, one and true God: and a happy consumation of my end: and I beseech thee
that thou will vouchsafe to bring me a sinner, unto that unspeakable feast:
where thou with thy Son and the holy Ghost, art a true ^ight to thy Saints, a
complete fulness, an everlasting gladness, an absolute joy, and a perfect
felicity. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Another prayer after receiving the B. Sacrament.
PIerce through, o sweet Lord Jesus the marrow, and bowels of my soul, with
the most sweet, and wholesome wound of thy love, with thy true, clear, most
ardent and holy Charity, that my soul may languish and melt, even by the only
love and desire of thee; let it covet thee, and even languish after thee at thy
gates; let it desire to be dissolved, and to be with thee. Grant that my soul
may hunger after thee, the bread of Angels, the food of holy souls, our daily
and supersubstantial bread, having all sweetness, and savor, and all
delightfulnes in it self: let my heart always hunger and eat thee, on who^
the Angels desire to look; and let the bowels of ^^y soul be replenished
with the sweetness of thy tast^* let it always thirst after thee, the fou^tain
of life, the fou^tain of wisdom and knowledge, the fountain of eternal light,
the river of pleasure, the plentifulnes of the house of God: let it always
earnestly covet thee, seek thee, and find thee* let it tend to thee, come unto
thee, think upon thee, speak of thee, and work all things unto the praise and
glory o^ thy name, with humility, and discretion, with love and delight, with
facility and affectionwith perseverance unto the end: and thou alone be always
my hope, my whole confidence, my riches, my delight, my pleasures, my gladness,
my rest and tranquillity, my peace, my security, my odor, my sweetness, my meat,
my food, my refuge, my help, my wisdom, my portion my profession, my
treasure, in the which my mind and heart, is always fixed, firm, and
immoueably rooted. Amen.

Another Prayer after receiving the B. Sacrament.
O Lord Jesus Christ, I humbly bessech thy unspeakable mercy, that this
Sacrament of thy b^by and blood, which I (unworthy) have received, may be to me
a purging of offenses, a fortitude against frailtyes, a fortress against the
perils of the world, an obtaining of pardon, an establishment of grace, a
medicine of life, a memory of thy passion, a nourishment against weakness, and
a rest of my pilgrimage. Let it guide me going, reduce me wandering, receive me
returning again, uphold me stumbling, lift me up falling, and perseuering
bring me into glory. O highest God, let the most blessed presence of thy body
and blood so alter the taste of my heart, that besides thee at any time it feel
no sweetness, it love no fairenes, it seek no unlawful love, it desire no
consolation, it admit no delectation or pleasure, it care for no honor, it
fear no cruelty. Who live and raignest, with God the Father, in the unity of
the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

BRIEF MEDITATIONS FOR THE SEVEN days of the Week, In imitation of seven
virtues of our Blessed Savior.
By the R. Father Luke Pinelli, of the Society of JESUS.
SUNDAY.
Of Christ's Humility.
1. COnsider the humility, which the Son of God manifested in his Incarnation,
in which for thee he annihilated himself, taking upon him the form of a
servant, the Lord of Majesty became thy servant, to do thee service, he came
down heaven, where the Angels were attendant upon him, and for an ample
testimony of his humble service to thee, he pleased to be borne in a stable.

2. Consider, how this Lord of heaven, a while after humbled himself much more
in his Nativity, when first he subjected his most tender and delicate body to
circumcision, and declared himself as a sinner, and standing in need of a
remedy (for Circumcision was a sign of sin, and a remedy against it) and he
vouchsafed to number himself among sinners, all the world beholding it: and how
more vile, and abject could he make himself, then to take upon him the form
of a servant, and to be borne in a stable?

3. Consider the great affection of humility, that our Savior exercised in
Jordan, when he pleased to be baptized by S. John Baptist, where contemning his
own reputation, he stood amiddest base persons, and sinners, and was baptized
by his Precursour as one of the multitude, and more contemptible sort.

4. Consider, how in his last supper, girding himself with a lynnen cloth, and
falling down upon his knees before every one of his Apostls, he washed their
feet. At the strangenes of which fact, they were so astonished and confounded,
as that S. Peter meruailing at it more then the rest, that the Son of God
abased himself so far, would not, that he should wash his feet.

5. Consider the humility, that the King of Glory declared in his death, when
he disdayned not to be crucified out of Jerusalem, in the midst between two
thieves, in the feast of the Pasche, whither the people were come from all
parts in great number, by reason of the feast; where he made a representation
of the shamefullnes of his most ignominious death to the view of the whole
world, when as at another time he made a manifestation of some little part of
his glory to three of his discipls alone in the desert; neither yet, while he
lived, would speak any word at al touching this matter.

This Meditation being ended, you that turn the eyes of your mind upon your
self, and you shall stir up these (...) most profitable and practical
documents.
1. SInce that the K. of heaven, and my Lord has humbled himself so many
ways, is it meet that I the servant, and a most vile worm of the earth,
should extold my self?

2. Neither ought I to make outwardly any more reckoning of my self, then I am
in very deed.

3. Neither is it meet, that for the conseruing and entertaining of a vain
reputation of my name and credit, I should abandon, or give over the care of my
soul.

4. I must not in any sort withdraw my self from the exercise of those
things, which I have given over.

5. I ought not also to conceal and keep hidden those things, that may serve
for my mortification, or to propose to the view of all men those things, that
are wont to turn to my honor.

MONDAY.
Of the Obedience of Christ.
1. COnsider, what the Apostle says of Christ: He was made obedient even unto
death yea to obey the precepts of the law, whereunto he was not bound at all;
and he refused no aduersityes, torments, and ignominyes, such as he suffered in
his circumcision, and in his whole sacred passion.

2. Consider, how he being the only Son of God, and the wisdom of the
Eternal Father, was most obedient to his Mother, and to S. Joseph his reputed
Father. And though he were for infinite causes more holy, and more wise then
they, yet he never resisted against that they commanded, nor murmured against
them, nor censured them, but with greatest humility and promptitude executed,
and did whatsoever they commanded him.

3. Consider the great affection, wherewith our Savior te^dred the virtue of
Obedience, for which from the very beginning he protested to all, that he came
into the world not to do his own will, but the will of his Father. And
therefore in another place he called Obedience his meat, and thereby he
signified, that it was greatly pleasing unto him.

4. Consider, how he loved obedience, whiles he not only considered not the
person of him who commanded, nor also the difficulty of the thing commanded,
but was further obedient to his enemies, who tormented him in his Passion, and
treated him most ignominiously, when they crowned him with thorns. For being
willed to strip himself of his garments, he delayed not to do it: willed to
sit down, he obeyed: when the crown of thorns was put upon his head, he
contradicted not, and he took the Reed in his hand, that was given him for a
Scepter.

5. Consider, how the Lord of the Universe obeyed without any reply, or further
appeal; in so much as he used not the very least word, and accepted of the
most unjust sentence of death, unjustly pronounced against him by his perverse
Judges: and being willed by the Ministers, and officers to carry his own
Cross, he gladly did it, and took it upon his bruized and torn shoulders,
and with it upon his neck, as another obedient Isaac, he went up to mount
Caluary, there to be sacrificed for our sins.

The documents, that may be gathered of this Meditation, be, that we omit
nothing defective against obedience.
1 SInce the Son of God, without any obligation at all, obeyed with so great
promptitude, what shall be my punishment, if I shall not be obedient unto him,
to whom I am bound?

2. How grievous shall my sin be, if I shall peradventure murmr or rise
against the commandmentes of them, who have power over me?

3. What excuse can I pretend, if for the doing of mine own will, I neglect
the will and pleasure of my Lord God?

4. How great a shame and confusion will it be to me, if, that I may not endure
any adversity, I shall contemn to obey?

5. Who shall exempt me from confusion, and fault, if I shall jar and contend
with him, who is my Superior, and if, which is worse, I shall censure that
unjust which is commanded me?

TVESDAY.
Of Christ his Patience.
1. COnsider, how Christ our lord, from the very instant, that he came into the
world, began to exercise patience. For when there was not any found in all
Bethleem, that would receive his Mother into their house, he was forced to make
choice of a poor Cot for the place of his nativity, where the Manger served
for his bed, and cradle to lie in. Consider what manner of intertainment he
had, when his Mother was but a young Virgin, a poor stranger, and wearyed by
the payns of her long journey, in the midest of winter, in a poor stable, in
the night time and from home and out of her country.

2. Consider, how he was no sooner borne, the^ that he was persecuted, when he
was forced to fly into Egypt because Herod sought his life, and to make him
away Consider, how many miseryes and aduersityes, the poor little child
suffered in so long and paynfull a journey, and in Aepypt, a strange and
barbarous country, where he lived in a most poor manner for some years by the
labors and pains of S. Joseph, and his poor Mother.

3. Consider the patience, that the Jews put him unto, when they often called
him a seducer of the people, seditious, a Magitian, and raiser up of Devils, an
enemy of God, blasphemer, a preuaricatour, and transgressour of the Law, and
gave out that he was a drinker of wine: sometimes in a fury they rose against
him, and had a desire one time to stone him, another time to thrust him down
headlong from the top of an hill: but our meek Jesus is not recorded either to
have revenged himself of so great iniuryes, or to have been incensed at al
against the ungrateful people, but to have studied to do them good every way.

4. Consider, how patient he was in all his dolourous passion. When he was laid
hand on in the garden, and carried away, as a thief bound fast; was in the
sight of Annas censured for arrogant, and received that unworthy buffet at the
hands of a most vile bound-slaue: Caiphas held him for a blasphemer, and Herod
for a fool; and being treated for such an one, he endured all without any
perturbation of mind, and with exceeding patience. Consider the singular acts
of patience, which our Savior exercised in the house of Pilate, where he was
bound fast to a pillar, scourged as some notorious malefactor, scorned and
mocked in putting on the crown of thorns upon his head, grievously payned
therewith, his divine face not only buffeted, but also defiled with most
loathsome spittle; and when he had much a do to stand, they forced him to carry
his own cross, whereon he was nailed, and did hang till death. All this and
much more our Lord suffered with so great patience, as he complained not at al.

Of this Meditation you shall conceive a confusion and shame, for that you have
suffered so little, or nothing at all for our Lord, who has suffered so much,
and so great matters for us.
1. Thou who seeest, how much thy Savior has endured for thee, say now, who
do complain so much, what thou have suffered for him?

2. Thou have not yet from the first instant of thy nativity begun to suffer.

3. Thou have not yet been persecuted unto death, nor against all equity and
conscience.

4. Thou have not been scourged, nor crowned with thorns, nor nailed to a
cross, nor so much as shed one drop of blood for thy Creator.

5. What manner of patience is thine, when for every little adversity, or word,
thou art troubled, or fillest the air with complaints?

WEDNESDAY.
Of Christ his Meeknes
1. COnsider, how the Scripture said of Christ to the Country of Jury: Lo thy
King comes unto thee, meek. For where the worlds desert was, that our lord
should have come down from heaven, armed with the sword of Justice, to take
vengeance on the iniquityes of it, he descended all benign, and gentle, that
he might redress it, and give a remedy unto it by meeknes, and not chasten it
with the severity, and rigor of his divine justice.

2. Consider, how Christ was most meek toward his disciples, and gently bare
with their defects, when they contented about the primacy among themselves:
when they were angry with Mary Magdalen, at her annoynting his head with
precious ointment: when they forsook him, in the garden, when-he was betrayed
into the Jews hands. For in these and the like defects Christ, out of his
Gentleness, chose rather meekly and benignly to blame them the in a more severe
manner, to check them by shar^ reprehension.

3. Consider the meeknes, that he used toward the Scribes and Pharisees his
enemies, who calu^niated his works, and iniustly persecuted him, affirming
that he drove out unclean spirits in the power of Beelzebub: when he pardoned
him, his sins, who was troubled with the palsy, and that he blasphemed: and
that he had a devil, when he reprehended them. For our Lord by answering with
mildnes to these and other their like calumniatio^s, confounded their ill
meaning, boldness, and overmuch presumption.

4. Consider further, how our Lord discovered his meeknes in the presence of
the Devil. For he permitted himself to be tempted of him, and though he best
knew the perverse will of the bad and malignant spirit, and might at the first
have confounded him, put him to silence, and driven him away; yet he chose
rather to overcome him with mild answers, and in that manner to control the
extreme boldness of the infernal friend.

5. Consider the wonderful signs of meekenes, that Christ used toward Judas,
who betrayed him. For though he knew that he had sold him for money, yet he
lovingly admitted him to his table, washed his feet, and when the hour was
come, that he delivered him into the hands of his enemies, he friendly
embraced him, permitted him to give him a kiss, and by calling him friend, in
a mild manner wished him to remember himself, and did put him in mind of the
sin, that he then committed. Finally like a meek lamb he suffered himself to
be bound, and to be lead whithersoeuer his Adversaries thought best.

The fruit of this meditation shall be to understand the defect and want of
meeknes, that lies hid in thee, and to take pains for the gayning of it.
1. HOw far thou come short of thy meek master Jesus, who art not able to
bear with the very least defect in thy Neighbors?

2. How little thy meekenes is, who art angry at every least word, and
threatnest therefore.

3. What would thou now do, if calumnyes were raised against thee, or that
thou were justly persecuted.

4. What would thou do, if thou were sold, and betrayed of him, who had
received singular benefits at thy hands, as Christ our lord was sold and
betrayed of his disciple Judas, upon whom he had co^ferred so great benefits?

THVRSDAY.
Of Christ's contempt of the world.
1. COnsider, how our Savior contemned all those things, that men of the world
desire and seek after. For first he contemned the riches of this world, and
lead so poor a life, as he would not have possession of any earthly thing at
all, but living of alms, was contented with those things, that were necessary
for his state of poverty, and for clothing.

2. Consider, how he despised al pleasures and carnal delectations. For the
Jews, who had treated him ignominiously many ways, never durst infame him
touching Chastity, which he so plainly demonstrated in his very face, as it
induced and moved every one, who beheld him, to chastity, and purity of life.

3. Consider, how he not only contemned the honors and dignityes of this
world, but also, at what time the Jews would once have made him King, he
accepted it not, but went away from them, as from his enemies, declyning all
other titles and dignityes whatsoever. And therefore he prescribed unto his
Apostles, that the greater of them should be the others servant: and thereof he
had given the^ an instance before, and had given answer to Zebedeus his
sons, who made petition unto him for an earthly dignity, that they knew not
what they asked.

4. Consider, how he contemned the pleasurs and contentments, which worldly men
so greedily seek after; and thereupon some called him a Carpenter, because he
assisted S. Joseph in his Carpenters trade: and arriving to 30. years of age,
he withdrew himself into the desert, where he punished his most innocent flesh
with very soar penance; and all the remnant of his life after, ever travailed
in procuring the souls health of his neighbors.

5. Consider, how cheerfully he embraced the things, which this blind world
conceaueth so great an horror of, and flies from; that is, he made no
reckoning of iniuryes, reproaches, disgraces, tribulations: contempt, and to be
reputed a fool; he never sought to be revenged, as the world does: and when as
by the very least sign he might have punished his enemies, he would not do
it, but with a great and generous mind forgave all them who had offended him.

^y this meditation you shall learn to know your inward affections, for the
governing and moderating thereof, as is most fitting.
1. HEnce you may learn, whether you follow the standard of the World, or of
christ. For if you in heart desire more, then is necessary, or be carried away
with carnal pleasures, with an affection to be honored and esteemed of men,
and with the vanities of this life; a sign it is, that in affection you follow
the world though you make out-wardly never so great^shew to the contrary.

2. But if your care be to please your Savior, and to be like him, and
willingly embrace tribu^ations, and love to be mocked and contemned; ^t is a
sign, that you are a good soldier, and the true disciple of Christ.

FRIDAY.
Of Christ's Charity toward his Neighbors.
1. COnsider, how the Son of God, whereas he was in Heaven adored of the
Angels, neither stood in neeed of any thing, but was most happy and blessed in
himself, pleased to undergo the person of a needy man, exposed to a thousand
aduersityes and dangers, tha^ he might in this calamitous banishment be ou^
master and conductour whereunto not his own profit, and vtility, bu^ his
sincere and earnest love toward us moved him.

2. Consider, how our Savior thought it not enough to have take on him man's
nature for us, but also, when he saw that it was not within the compass of our
weak abilityes to satisfy the divine justice for our faults and
transgressions, he laid all upon his own shoulders, and abundantly satisfied
for all mankind And though his satisfaction was superabunda^t, where one drop
of blood had been more then enough, yet he shed all.

3. Consider how, though he foresaw there would be many who would not acknowledge
this so great a benefit, and would show themselves unworthy of so great
charity, he did not for all that cease to love us, nor loved us the less,
neither rejected he the ungrateful from being capable of his benefits, but as
the inexhaust Goodness, as he was indeed, most munificently, and most liberally
bestowed himself upon al.

4. Consider the pains travails, and troubles, which Christ endured for
helping his Neighbors, and you shall give a guess at the greatness of his
Charity For he trauayled from one castle to another on foot, and from one
Synagogue to another, showing unto all the way of salvation: he neither feared,
nor regarded any aduersityes at all, so he might preach the kingdom of heaven
to the multitude. And therefore among other things, though he were wearied of
his journey, and it were very late he yet cheerfully refused meat, whereof he
stood in much need, that he might convert the Samaritan woman.

5. Consider the great love, which our Savior showed toward us, when in the
end he loved us so as he left himself unto us in the most holy Sacrament of
the Altar. Neither did he leave us any lesser testimony of his love in his
sacred passion, who to set us free from the bondage of the Devil, and the
miseryes of sin, endured the most cruel torments that ever were: and while he
hanged upon the cross, prayed to his heavenly father for his Crucifiers, and
excused them in these words: Father forgive them, for they know not what they
do.

Here turn your eyes upon your self, and by comparing your self with
Christ, you shall stir up your soul to the love of your neighbor, which is
the fruit of this Meditation.
1. WILL you know how great your Charity toward your neighbors is? Examine
it with that, which you do for them, and you shall find it to be as great as be
the trauails, payns, and incommodityes, that you take and suffer in helping
them.

2. If thou do good neither to the soul, nor body of thy neighbors, neither
have will to withdraw the very least thing from thy self for their profit: and
if what thou do, thou do it therefore because it turns to thine own
vtility, what manner of Charity is that of thine?

3. He that has true charity, wishes spiritual good to his neighbor, as to
himself, prays to God for him, assisteth him in his necessityes as he is
able, and willingly forgiueth him, wherein he has offended him.

SATVRDAY.
Of Christ's diligence in spiritual matters.
1. COnsider, how diligent our Savior was in observation of the law, no
otherwise the^ if he had been bound. For the eight day he was circumcised, and
the 40. day he was presented in the Temple; at every time of the year, as it
was appointed, he went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom to worship
God there: and he ever respected S. Joseph, and his Mother, as the law
commanded.

2. Consider how, when he was to preach penance to others, he would first of al
experience it in himself. For after his Baptism, he retired into the desert,
where he gave himself most diligently, with fasting, and punishing of his own
body, to contemplation, and to other spiritual exercises.

3. Consider how after his return from out of the desert he begun to preach,
and with an amiable diligence endeavored to show the way of salvation to all.
To the infirm he gave doudle health both of body, and of spirit; he reproved
vice, he exhorted to virtue: he went up and down from place to place, that he
might help many. To be short that he might do good, he spared no pains at al.

4. Consider, how his will also was, that his disciples should be diligent in
doing of good works. For he often sent the^ forth to the adjoining castles to
preach, to cast forth Devils, to cure the sick and diseased, and therefore he
often exhorted them to great Charity, for he best of all knew, that such
diligence was the mother, and beginning of all spiritual works.

5. Consider, how diligent, and serious he was in prayer; and when as by day,
by reason of his overmuch business, wherewith he was detayned in preaching, and
in the conversion of his neighbors, he could not pray, he attended to prayer by
night, and as S. Luke says, he spent the night in the prayer of God. And this
is also manifest, for that, before he began his passion, in great humility and
earnestnes he addressed his prayer thrice unto his heavenly Father; and in the
expiration of his life he pleased to end it, and to dye in praying; namely,
while he did hang upon the Cross, he prayed first for his persecutours, and in
saying: Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit, he gave up his Ghost.

The fruit, that is to be gathered of this Meditation.
1. IF the Son of God were so diligent, not for any profit that were to
redound to himself, why should not thou be confounded, who art so negligent
in matters of spirit, that were prescribed for the good of thy soul.

2. What will it help thee, if thou be circumspect in temporal and transitory
things, and shall be negligent in prayer, mortification, penance, and other
spiritual functions?

3. Thou art also deceived, if thou be diligent in thy particular devotions,
and slothful, and drowsy in the observation of the commandments of God, and
of the Church.

4. If thou desire to attain to a diligence in spiritual matters, endeavor to
love them, for that the more thou shall be affected unto them, the more
diligent will thou be inprocuring the^.

ANNOTATIONS.
FOR the due performing of the former Meditations it is to be understood, that
the Virtues of our Savior may be meditated upon, three manner of ways.

1. First, that we may understand their nature and perfection, as the
Philosophers use to contemplate the heavens for the understanding of their
nature.

2. Secondly, for the praising, and magnifying of him, who had so excellent
virtues. And this second manner is both more noble, and more grateful to God;
for that it has a more excellent, and a more perfect end, that is, the
praising of Gods Godnes.

3. Thirdly, for imitation, and purchasing of the^: and this is the best manner
of all, and more excellent then the other two, and more pleasing to God. For
besides that, that it comprehends the excellency of the two other, it has
withal a most noble end, which makes a man like unto the son of God. And
that is, the greatest perfection of all, that a reasonable creature has, or
can have in this life.

Moreover in this manner be exercised the three powers of the soul. The Memory
lays before the eyes Christ's life, as the acts of vertue^, which he
exercised, whiles he lived. The Understanding discourses about the virtues,
and the qualityes of then^. And the Will to the same virtues applies Affection
which helps to the attayning of those virtues, for in that in which a thing
is loved, in that it is sought for to be attained.

The vtilityes of his last manner be diverse.

1. The first purges the soul from vices. For while the virtues are planted,
the vices are destroyed in it.

2. The second restores it to the former beauty, and seemlynes, and directs
it: for that by the virtues the passions are brought back again to their
natural order, that they do no more, then what they are swayed unto by reason.

3. The third illuminateth: for that the soul informed, and furnished with
virtues, and not troubled with passions, both sees, discerns, and judges
the better.

4. The fourth makes it grateful to the Creator, and to all other creatures,
since there is nothing, that makes a man so amiable, as does virtue, which
draws the very enemies to love and admire it.

5. The fifth enricheth it with merits, for that all the virtuous acts of him,
who is in grace, be meritorious.

And the way of reaping some fruit in these Meditations, is this, that a man
put on an effectual, and earnest desire of attayning the said virtues, for
from this desire proceeds the exercise thereof, which is the principal, and
only way to purchase them. Wherefore upon Sunday he, who meditateth of the
humility of Christ, must exercise many acts of Humility. Upon Monday, he must
exercise acts of Obedience, and so of the rest. It is not ever necessary to
meditate upon all the five points of the Meditation, but it is enough to insist
upon one, or two, and oftentimes in the day to exercise the virtue, that be
has meditated upon, and to crave grace of God to go forwards therein, every
day more and more.

The Entertayning of good thoughts.
EVery day, morning, and evening, for the space of one Aue Maria, or two, in a
most serious and affectuous manner, think upon that which is set down for
every particular day following: and renew the same good Thought every hour;
which may easily be done at all times, and upon every occasion, either sitting,
walking, working, lying etc. And all people though never so rude, may be made
capable thereof, to wit, children, laborers, servants; yea, and that amidst
their imployme^ts and occupations, be they never so great, or serious.

SUNDAY.
O Repose! O glory everlasting! What is it to enjoy thee! And what to be
without thee!

TWESDAY.
Ah poor soul! thou must come to judgment all alone! Thy works, thy words,
yea thy thoughts, shall be seen of the Saints, of the Angels, of God: and all
shall there be laid open! Oh have therefore a special care of thy own good.

WEDNESDAY.
To burn in hell fire! For all eternity! And that with Devils! O torment,
greater then all torments!

THVRSDAY.
He that loses his soul, loses all! He that offends God, loses his
soul! O sin, what a loss do thou bring unto us! I detest thee, from the
bottom of my heart, most detestable sin.

FRIDAY.
O sweet Jesus! To thee I consecrate my life, my desires, my soul. For me wast
thou nailed on the Cross. For thee will I give my self and dedicate my self
wholly unto thee.

SATVRDAY.
O blessed Virgin Mary! How entirely did thou love thy son Jesus! O cause me
to love him, and to serve him: and that nothing in this world may ever separate
me from his holy Grace.

The beginning of the Gospel, according to S. John.
Glory be to thee, O Lord.
IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the
Word. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him: and
without him was made nothing, which was made. In him was life, and the life was
the light of men: and the light shines in darkness, and darkness did not
comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man
came for testimony, to give testimony of the light, that all might believe
through him. He was not the light, but to give testimony of the light. It was
true light which lightneth every man that comes into this world. He was in
the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not. He came
into his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, he
gave them power to be made the Sons of God, to those that believe in his
Name: who not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
but of God are borne. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us (and we saw
the glory of him, glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father) full of
grace and verity.

Thanks be to God.
