Observance of the Acrostich Psalms.

PSALM 1. Beatus Vir.
Blessed is the man, whose walks are clear
from wicked counsels air;
To sinners way who stands not near,
nor sits in scorners chair.
2
But on the Law of God does ground
the life of his delight;
And in those holy Precepts bound
his practice day and night.
3
And like the planted tree, that lives
the rills of water near,
His fruit as duly forth he gives
in season of the year.
His leaf, shall neither times decays,
nor tempests blast suppress;
So whatsoever he essaies,
shall sort to good success.
4
Not so, not so, the wicked race,
they, like the chafe shall thrive,
Which from the earths offended face
the winds before them drive.
5
Therefore shall not the wicked stock
in judgment stand upright;
Nor with the just the sinful flock
their guilty heads unite.
6
For how the Just their journie lay,
the Lord their Leader knows:
But wicked doers, with their way,
destruction overthrowes.
PSALM. 2. Quare fremuerunt?
WHy do the Heathen-pow'rs,
and people entertain;
The Heathens, such tumultuous rage,
the people, plots so vain?
2
Kings of the earth conspire,
and Princes counsel take
Against the Lord, against his Christ,
a powerful head to make.
3
In sunder let us break
their servile bands (say they)
Their yoke from off our necks discharge,
and cast their cords away.
4
But He, in Heaven above
that sits, and sees their pride,
Shall laugh their vanities to scorn,
the Lord shall them deride.
5
To them then shall he speak,
in his resistlesse ire;
And their affrighted souls shall feel
his fury burn like fire.
6
Yet, mine Anointed King
upon mine holy Hill,
Upon Mount Zion have I set.
I shall declare the will,
7
Of which Decree the Lord
has given the charge to me:
And said, Thou art my Son, this day
have I begotten Thee.
8
Ask, I to thee will give
the Heathens world of ground
For thine inheritance, possess
as far as earth has bound.
9
Thou with an iron rod
shall stripe their stubborn hides;
Or, like a Potters brittle shards,
in pieces dash their sides.
10
Now then, O Kings, be wise,
and ye that judge the Land,
Be well instructed what ye judge,
judge what ye understand.
11
Serve ye the Lord in fear,
in fear and joy betwixt;
A joyful fear, a trembling joy,
delight and duty mixed.
12
Embrace and kiss the Son,
lest through your cold delay,
His wroth contemning your contempt,
ye perish in the way.
If but a little while
his angered patience burn;
For safety they that hope in Him,
have all a happy turn.
PSALM. 3. Domine, quid. Psalmus David. cum fugeret a facie Absalom, filii sui.
HOw many my distressers, Lord,
what mighty enemies:
Against one harmless head of mine
how many heads arise?
2
A multitude say of my soul,
so helpless left alone,
Himself he cannot help, in God
for him there health is none. Selah
3
But thou my shield about me, Lord,
do for my glory stand;
The sole up-lifter of my head
is thy Almighty hand.
4
Up to the Lord I strained my voice,
and cried, that he might hear;
And he out of his holy Mount
to my complaint gave ear. Selah
5
I laid me down and slept; from sleep
refresht I rose again:
My sleep was sound, my guard was safe,
the Lord did me sustain.
6
Beleaguered with ten thousand strong
in arms, about me laid;
And malice equal to their might,
I would not be afraid.
7
Rise up, Lord, save me, O my God,
for thy revengefull stroke
Of all my wicked foes the jaws
and ranck'rous teeth has broke.
8
Salvation is of thee, O Lord,
from thee the blessing flows,
Which on thy chosen peoples heads
thy bounteous hand bestows. Selah
PSALM. 4. Cum invocarem. Ad Praestantem in Neghinoth: Psalmus David.
TO thee, O God, my righteousness,
let my complaint repair:
Thou have enlarged me from distress,
in mercy hear my prayer.
2
My glory (sons of man) to shame
how long will ye apply?
Your love shall vanity inflame,
your labor seek a lie. Selah
3
But know, that of his gracious Saint
the Lord makes wondrous choice;
And when to him I make my plaint,
the Lord will hear my voice.
4
Be angry: but from sin refrain,
Soul, with a silent zeal: Selah
5
Thy self upon thy bed arraigne,
and to thy self reveal.
6
The sacrifices ye present,
let Justice sacrifice;
And let your hope be confident,
that on the Lord relies.
7
Of good (say many) is there none
will show us any sight?
On us, Lord (all our good in one)
lift up thy faces light.
8
Pure joy into this heart of mine
so shall thou give me, more
Than theirs, that of their corn and wine
in harvest heap up store.
9
My head then down will I both lay,
and sleep in peaces cell:
For thou alone, O Lord, my stay,
in safety make me dwell.
PSALM. 5. Verba mea. Ad Praestantem, super Nehiloth. Psalmus David.
UNto my words, O Lord, give ear,
weigh well my wordlesse thought:
2
O let my cry, where thou may hear,
my King, my God, be brought.
3
Thou, Lord, shall (early) hear my voice,
to thee my prayer shall fly:
And of the rising morn make choice
to Heaven to raise mine eye.
4
For thou art God, in wickedness
that take no delight:
The evil shall have no access,
nor sojourne in thy sight.
5
Vainglorious Fools before thine eyes
take sooting never shall:
Thou hate of iniquities
the painful workers all.
6
The lying tongue shall thou defeat
with utter overthrow:
The man of bloud^, and pale deceit,
the Lord abhorres to know.
7
But in thy mercies much regard,
thy house will I draw near;
And to thy holy Temple-ward,
do worship in thy fear.
8
Lord, lead me in thy justice right:
and, lest I step astray,
Because of my maligners, straight
before me make thy way.
9
For in h^s mouth, no truth sincere,
their inwards, deeps of woe:
Their throat, an open sepulcher;
tongues smoothly taught to go.
10
Judge them, O God, and let their fall,
their guilty counsels tell:
Rout them with their transgressions all,
against thee that rebel.
11
So shall they (aye) that trust in thee,
shout all with joyful voice;
And thy Names-lovers, they that be,
for covering them, rejoice*
12
For thou, O Lord, thy blessing down
upon the Just shall yield;
And with thy gracious favor crown
his head, as with a shield.
PSALM. 6. Domine, ne in furore. Ad Praestantem, in Neghinoth, super Octavam.
Psalmus David.
MY faults, let no reproof of thine,
Lord, in thy wrath repeat;
Nor chastise any crime of mine
in thy displeasures heat.
2
Have mercy, Lord; for I am weak,
Lord, heal me: else in vain
My bone^, with horror shook, shall speak
the language of my pain.
3
My soul is also troubled sore;
and though my pangs be strong,
My soule-sicke sorrow pains me more,
but Thou, O Lord, how long!
4
Return, O Lord, and at thy cost
my souls deliverance clear:
O save my life, that am but lost,
but for thy mercy mere.
5
For none in death remembrance have
upon thy Name to dwell:
And who so thankful in the grave,
as of thy praise to tell?
6
The languor that my groans have bred,
my melting spirits out-weares:
To swim all night I make my bed,
and drown my couch in tears.
7
Mine eye gnawne out with anguish dies,
my beauty to behold,
(Because of all mine enemies)
grown wanne, and waxen old.
8
From me, ye wicked doers all,
with all your deeds forbear:
The Lord has heard my voices call,
my tears have touched his ear.
9
The Lord has heard how I complained,
and with my prayer is pleased;
My suit the Lord has entertained,
my painful sufferings eased.
10
Shame and confusion out of hand
on all my haters light:
And on their backs entrench the brand
of their reproachful flight.
PSALM. 7. Domine Them. Shiggajon David, qui cecinit Domino, super verba Chus,
filii Iemini.
MY confidence do I repose
O Lord my God in thee:
From all my persecuting foes
save and deliver me.
2
Lest like a Lion he devour,
and (no Redeemer near
To rescue me that has the power)
my soul in pieces tear.
3
O Lord my God, if I have done
this crime that they object;
Or wickedness if any one
my guilty palms infect.
4
If evil I to him have paid,
that was with me at peace:
(Yea, him that causlesse me betrayed
I freely did release:)
5
Let then my foe pursue, and take
my soul to sat his lust;
Tread down my life on earth; and make
my glory dwell in dust. Selah
6
Rise up Lord in thy wrath, up rise,
for my distressors rage;
Command thy judgment to surprise,
or their proud heat assuage.
7
So shall the peoples many a one
in flocks about thee fly:
For their sakes to thy powerful Throne
return thy self on hie.
8
The Lord shall judge the peoples right,
judge Lord of my desert,
How just my hands are in thy sight,
and how sincere my heart.
9
Of wicked men the malice bound,
the just established keep:
For thou of hearts and reins do sound
(just God) the deepest deep.
10
My shield on God their Savior,
that are in heart upright:
Just Judge is God; Gods angry power
threats every day to light.
11
For him that turns not; to repent
whom no remorse will bring,
His sword he whets, his bow stands bent,
his arrows on the string.
12
And them for him he has prepared,
(dire instruments of death:)
Among the persecutors shared,
to stop their fiery breath.
13
Behold his womb with mischief swells,
with sorrow breeds he sin:
Now brought to bed, of nothing else
but of a lie, lies-in.
14
He dug a pit with painful care,
to delve it deep withal:
Where (others earning to ensnare)
himself into did fall.
15
His mischief on his head shall light,
that mischief first did frame:
On his own pate shall spend his spite,
the forge from whence it came.
16
Confess unto the Lord will I,
so just in all his ways;
And of the Lord, that is Most-Hie,
the Name my song shall praise.
PSALM. 8. Domine, Dominus. Ad Praestantem, super Gittith, Psalmus David.
O Lord, our Lord, the earth about
how glorious is thy Name;
Which have thy Majesty given out
above the Heavens high frame?
2
Strength from the mouth of babes to go,
from sucklings tender age,
Thou foundedst, to confound the foe,
and still the avengers rage.
3
As often as on thy Heavens I look,
work of thy fingers rote;
The Moon, the Stars, (Heavens Musick-book)
by thee in Volumes wrote;
4
What is frail man, O say I now,
remembered thus by thee?
Or what is Adams son, that thou
his Visitor should be?
5
A little have thou rank't beneath
the Angels Crest his Crown:
His head empal'd within a wreathe
of glory and renown.
6
A Sovereign have thou set him, meet
thy handy-workes to sway;
And all things underneath his feet
made useful to obey.
7
Sheep, Oxen, all the Beasts that field
or desert-soile contain:
Foul, Fish, that air or salt-sea yield,
whose paths are in the Maine.
8
O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
throughout this earthly frame!
How boundless is the beams extent
of thy resplendent Name!
PSALM. 9. Confit^bor tibi. ^d Praestantem, super Muth-Labben. Psalm. David.
TO render thanks to thee, O Lord,
my heart is wholly bent;
Of all thy marvells to record,
my tongue the instrument.
2
I will be glad, I will rejoice
in thee with melody:
And to thy Name sing Numbers choice,
O thou that art Most-Hie.
3
When backward fled, mine enemies
were hard pursued in chase;
They stumbled, never more to rise,
but perish from thy face.
4
For thou my judgments doom have done,
or else my right had failed:
Thou satest Judge upon the Throne,
where Justice has prevailed.
5
The Heathen routs have thou reproved,
the wicked one destroi'd;
From men among, their name removed,
for evermore maid void.
6
My foe, see desolations done,
the Cities razed to ground:
With them is their memorial gone,
and in their dust lies drowned.
7
But Sovereign on his Throne declared
the Lord shall ever sit;
Which for himself he has prepared,
and made for judgment fit.
8
And he with justice will proceed
to judge the world so wide;
And of his peoples every deed
with righteous doom decide.
9
The Lord to him that is oppressed
will be a refuge high:
A refuge high, the poor distressed
when times of trouble try.
10
And they that know thy Name, alone
their trust on thee will ground:
For thou art, Lord, forsaking none
of them that seek thee, found.
11
Sing to the Lord on Sion Mount,
whose pleasure is to dwell:
With praise his deeds of high account
among the peoples tell.
12
For when the Quest of his Assise
for bloods inquiry makes:
^nmindfull he the meek that cries
forgets not, nor forsakes.
13
My sufferings, Lord, in mercy see,
through mine oppressors hates;
^f death, O thou the only He,
that lifts me from the gates.
14
That all thy praises I may spread
in Sions daughters ports;
and in thy saving health be glad,
in all my songs reports.
15
The Heath'n are sunk down in the pit,
which they themselves prepared:
^^t secret net which they did fit,
their foot has fast ensnared.
16
His judgment done, the Lord is known
to execute aright:
Caught in the handy-workes his own,
mark well the wicked wight. Higgajon. Sell.
17
The wicked shall return to Hell,
where their abode is set:
^re Heath'ns, and Heav'ns-contemners dwell,
and all that God forget.
18
For always shall not be forgot
the grievance of the poor;
Of needy souls the hopes shall not
be lost for evermore.
19
Rise, Lord, let none of mortal race
prevail against thy hand;
But let the Heath'ns before thy face,
to hear their judgment stand.
20
Dismaying-feare upon them throw,
that Lord, confounded then,
The haughty-hearted Heath'ns may know,
they be but wretched men. Sela^.
PSALM. 10. Ut quid Domine.
WHy standst thou, Lord, so far aside,
when dangers draw so near?
Thy helpful face why do thou hide,
when troublous times appear?
2
The wicked in his heat of pride
pursues the heart-lesse poor:
In those selfe-toiles let them be ti'd,
by them contrived before.
3
The wicked boasts his souls desires
beyond his wished success:
The covetous, what he admires,
blasphemes the Lord to bless.
4
On God (so proud the wicked is)
he takes no care to call:
Nor God in any plot of his
has any place at all.
5
His travel all times well succeeds,
thy Judgments, where he goes,
Above his sight he never heeds,
but puffes at all his foes.
6
For in his hearts consent, he said,
'Mov'd shall I never be.
^n me shall evil none be laid,
my fall no age shall see.
7
His mouth is full with curses armed,
deceit and guile among:
^niquitie and mischief swarmed,
hive underneath his tongue.
8
In villages to stands he gets,
there close in ambush lies:
The innocent and poor besets,
and murders when he spies.
9
In secret, he from sight of men
lies waiting, near the way;
and Lion-like lurkes in his den,
to snatch the poor for prey.
10
The poor into his net he draws,
till he has caught him thrall;
^toops low, into his powerful paws
that poor by flocks may fall.
11
In heart he says (tongue durst not say)
"All this has God forgot;
Or heedlesse hides his face away
for ever, sees it not.
12
Arise, Lord God, lift up thy hand
for them, that help implore,
Without thy strength too weak to stand,
be mindful of the poor.
13
Why has the wicked heart a tongue,
though words for fear retire;
^o speak in spiteful thoughts? "This wrong
thou God wilt not enquire.
14
Thou see, for wrong and wickedness,
thine eye and hand perceive:
^^dresse, the poor and fatherless
to thee their helper leave.
15
Of wicked and malicious men
br^ake thou the harmfull arm:
Seek out his wickedness, and then
find neither arm nor harm.
16
The Lord is King and Governor,
for ever and beyond:
The Heath'n opposers of his power
are perished from the land.
17
The meek-afflicted souls desire
thou Lord art pleased to hear;
Their heart confirmed do thou inspire,
attentive make thine ear.
18
To judge the pupil and the poor,
that sorry man may find
His daunting threats to be no more
but earth, and empty wind.
PSALM. 11. In Domino. Ad Praestantem, Davidis.
MY trust does on the Lord rely,
how say ye to my soul,
Soul, to thy mountains safety fly,
as swift as feathred foul?
2
For lo, the wicked bend their bow,
on string their arrow fit,
A shoot in darkness to bestow,
the upright heart to hit.
3
When wicked plots are over-past,
that steadfast ground have none:
When their foundations down are cast,
the just, what has he done?
4
The Lord from holy place above,
the Lord from Heaven his Throne,
His eyes will view, his eyelids prove
how Adams sons have gone.
5
The just and wicked ones estate
the Lord will prove and try:
6
But self hate souls his soul does hate,
that love malignitie.
7
Upon the wicked will he shower
snares, fire, and brimstone down:
And breath of burning tempest power,
their cup this lot shall crown.
8
For just the Lord, and just designs
are lovely in his sight;
His face discerns, and right defines
of men and means upright.
PSALM. 12. Salvum me fac. Ad Praestantem, super Octavam. Psalmus David.
SAve, Lord, for godly men are gone,
and goodness none that mind:
Of Adams son a faithful one
example rare to find.
2
With faign'd discourse, and fawning style,
each one his neighbor holds:
But of his flattering lips, the guile
in heart and heart he molds.
3
All flattering lips, of fraud the train
the Lord cut off betimes;
And tongue that strikes no lower strain,
but lofty language chimes.
4
Our tongue (say they) shall sure prevail,
these lips of ours must walk;
Our lips their Masters must not fail:
what Lord shall tax our talk?
5
Now for the needy souls reprize,
and poor man's groaning cares,
Up will I, says the Lord, arise,
and save him from these snares.
6
Thy words, O Lord, are words as pure
as silver seven times tried
In Test of ashes, by the cure
of fire repuirifi'd.
7
Thou shall, O Lord, preserve the flock
of thy selected sheep;
And ever from this wicked stock
the soul that serves thee keep.
8
The wicked compass every coast,
their quarter keeps no bounds:
While Adams (...) are valew'd most,
where vileness most abounds.
PSALM. 13. Usque quo Domine? Ad Praestantem. Psalmus David.
HOw long, Lord, will thou me forget?
for ever shall it be?
How long, no eye upon me set,
but hide thy face from me?
2
How long shall I in soul advise,
and daily vex my heart?
How long, my foes above me rise,
against me that take part?
3
Behold, O Lord my God, and hear
from clouds of darkness deep:
With thy pure light mine eyesight clear,
lest in the death I sleep.
4
Against me, lest to have prevailed,
my foe give out the voice:
For when my feeble foot has failed,
my troublers will rejoice.
5
My trust yet on thy mercy stays,
thy saving health shall be
My joy of heart, my song shall praise
thy bounty, Lord, to me.
PSALM. 14. Dixit Insipiens. Ad Praestantem, Davidis.
THere is no God, the fools heart says
in his ungodly mood.
2
Corrupt and odious are their ways:
none, no not one does good.
3
The Lord looked down from heaven, to see
what Adams sons desired:
Of understanding, who was he,
that after God inquired.
4
Together all departed are,
all loathsome-sented grow'n*
Of doing good that has the care,
or conscience none, not one.
5
Are wicked workers all misled?
so ignorant are all?
That eat my people up like bread,
on God they never call.
6
There did their fear confess distrust,
whose guilt they could not hide;
^he generation of the Just
has God to be their guide.
7
The counsels of the poor, to blame
your blame-full counsels rend:
and (shameless) of his hopes, speak shame,
that on the Lord depend.
8
Salvation who to Israel
shall out of Sion give,
When they that now in bondage dwell,
no longer captives live.
When home-return'd the Lord shall bring
the people of his choice,
O then for joy shall Jacob sing,
and Israel rejoice.
Isti tres versus non sunt in textu Hebraeo, Graeco, Chaldaeo, vel in Carmine
Apollinarii. In Bibl^^ emendatis relicti sunt, ob antiquetatis venerationem:
sed absque arithmetica notae, qua ut proprii distinctique hajus Psalmi versus
habeantur.

A Paulo recitantur hoc ordine.
THeir throat an open sepulcher,
the forge of fraud their tongue:
Their lips more deadly poison bear,
than where the Aspe has stung.
2
Their mouth of cursing is a spring,
of bitterness a flood:
Their feet as foul of prey on wing
are swift in shedding blood*
3
Their ways are for vexation made,
and to destruction load:
The way of peace is not their trade,
nor know they how to tread.
Which knowing not, needs must they fall,
where endless horror lies,
Of God that have no sense at all,
no fear before their eyes.
PSALM. 15. Domine, quis? Psalmus Davidis.
WHo, Lord, shall sojourne in thy Tent?
Inhabit who thy holy Hill?
Who perfect walks, is working still
2
The works of Justice to fulfill;
In heart means truth; truth speaks as meant.
3
Whose tongue to slander cannot frame,
Does to his friend no evil thing,
Nor gives nor takes reproaches sting,
From mischiefs venomed mouth to fling,
Against his neighbors honest name.
4
Whose eye (all kind respect forgot)
Holds in contempt a person vile;
But ranks them high in honors file,
To fear the Lord, that set their while:
Swears to his hurt, and changes not.
5
Gives not to biting Usurie,
For sordid gain, his silver lent,
Sells not for bribe the innocent;
To do these things whose mind stands bent,
Shall stand unmoved eternally.
PSALM. 16. Conserva me. Michtam Davidis.
ON thee my safeties hope is staid
O God, preserve thou me:
2
Thou Lord, my Lord (my soul has said)
My good is not to thee.
3
Upon the Saints on earth that dwell,
souls gracious in thy sight:
Souls, that in serving God excel,
set is my sole delight.
4
Their sorrows shall be multiplied,
that after off-gods run;
That other god have deifi'd,
and left thy dues undone.
Of blood the offerings they propine,
I will not once partake,
Nor of their names these lips of mine
shall ever mention make.
5
The Lord is of mine heritage
the portion, of my cup
The overflowing beverage;
my lot thou hold up.
6
Within a fair and pleasant land,
the lines for me are laid:
A goodly heritage in hand,
I hold to me convai'd.
7
Thanks to the Lord will I return
for his advertisement,
Whose fire within my reins does burn,
with mighty chastisement.
8
The Lord before me always set
my object un-reprov'd;
On my right hand so him I get,
I shall not be removed.
9
My heart therefore thus heartned, sung
for joy within my breast:
Glad was the glory of my tongue,
"My flesh in hope shall rest.
10
Nor will thou leave my soul in hell,
nor give thy Holy One,
Where death, and shades of darkness dwell,
to see corruption.
11
The path of life thou make me know,
full joys before thy face:
From whence perpetual pleasures flow,
thy right hand is the place.
PSALM. 17. Ex^udi, Domine. Oration Davidis.
Hear justice, Lord, exactly heed
what my loud cries entreat;
Attend my prayer, that does proceed
from lips without deceit.
2
My judgment from before thy face
let come in open sight:
Let thy pure eyes discern my case,
and give the Rights their right.
3
My heart by night thy search did sound,
yet nothing did thou find
That with my mouth I did propound,
to sin against my mind.
4
By works, that earthly man concern,
I find what course they run:
By thy lips word, the paths I learn
of breakers-through to shun.
5
Beat thou my ways, and make them plain,
my feeble steps fore-guide;
My feet within thy paths contain,
my footing shall not slide.
6
On thee I call, thou God wilt hear,
and answer me again:
^o my request incline thine ear,
attend how I complain.
7
Thy wondrous mercies set apart,
from thy insulting foes,
Savior of them, whose hope thou art,
that thy right hand oppose.
8
O keep me as those crystal globes,
the eyes black darling keep,
And spread thy wings wide covering robes,
where shadowed I may sleep.
9
My head from wicked faces hide,
the heads of my decay,
That compass me on every side,
to make my soul their prey.
10
Enclosed in their own sat, they smoke
with surfeits doubtful sweat;
And with their mouth have proudly spoke
their haughty hearts conceit.
11
To snare our footsteps, in our walks
they now beset us round,
With eyes (as treason closely stalks)
to undermine our ground.
12
His likeness is a Lion bold,
that greedy is to tear;
So keeps the Lions whelp his hold,
that lurkes in secret where.
13
Rise, Lord, prevent his sharp fore-sights,
to stop my foe begin;
And with thy sword, wherewith he fights,
my souls deliverance win.
14
From men, the scourge Lord of thy hand,
from mortall-worldlings will;
Upon this life, whose portions stand,
whose gorge thy treasures fill!
Sons have they store; and of their store,
when death shall them bereave:
Then (all too much) what they have more,
they to their children leave.
15
Now of thy face a view to take,
shall Justice be my guide:
In me when shall thine Image wake,
I shall be satisfied.
PSALM. 18. Diligam te, Domine. Ad Praestantem. Servi Domini Davidis, qui
loquutus est Domino verba Cantici huju^, in die quo eripuit cum Dominus de vola
omnium inimicorum suorum, and de manu Saul: Et di^i^,
O Lord, whose strength in me does move,
and all my strength beget,
The strong impression of my love
on thee is wholly set.
2
The Lord my rock, whereon to build,
my fort, my Savior:
My God, my hopes strong hold, my shield,
horn of my health, my tower.
3
Upon the praised Lord I called,
to him for help I prayed;
Me from my foes he dis-enthrall'd,
and gave me saving aid.
4
Of death the sorrows succourlesse
were round about me laid;
Of over-bearing wickedness
the floods made me afraid.
5
The cords of Hell about me bent,
on every side took hold;
The snares of death did me prevent,
that I could not unfold.
6
Oppressed, the Lord my God I pressed,
he from his Palace hears;
Before him came my loud request,
and entered at his ears.
7
Then shook the trembling earth for fear,
the hills foundations moved:
And at his presence troubled were,
because his wroth reproved.
8
A storm of smoke before him came,
which from his nostrils fumed;
And fire out of his mouth did flame,
that where it came, consumed.
9
He bowed the Heavens, and made his Throne
with earth his footstool meet:
Beneath the dreadful light that shone,
lay darkness at his feet.
10
A Cherub-chariot did him bear,
whose plumes he made his sail;
The winds his winged-coursers were,
and darkness was his veil.
11
Dark his pavillion, dark the sky,
dark waters, duskie clouds,
Compose an aerie canopie,
wherein himself he shrowds.
12
The brightness of his presence took
the melting clouds in chase;
With hail and coals hot-burning struck,
they fled before his face.
13
The Lord from Heaven in thunder spoke;
his voice that is most-Hie,
With storms of hail made earth to smoke,
and coals of fire to fly.
14
His sheafs of arrows forth he sent,
which at the scatt'red, flew:
Of lightning-shot his vollies spent,
down his resisters threw.
15
The channels of the Maine appear,
the worlds foundations vast,
At thy rebuke discovered were,
Lord, at thy nostrils blast.
16
He sent his hand from Heaven above,
to bay the waves that flew;
He took me, and from out the drove
of many waters drew.
17
He freed me from my strongest foe,
to whom my strength was small:
And from my mighty haters, more
than I could match withal.
18
When I with woe was over-gone,
they me fore-laid that day;
But me, then helper having none,
the Lord my staff did stay.
19
Where I was bound he brought me forth
enlarged, and set me free:
For (of mine own) none other worth,
but his delight in me.
20
According as my justice stands,
the Lord did me reward;
And to the pureness of my hands,
my recompense he shared.
21
Because what ways the Lord did go,
therein my feet have trod;
And have not, as the wicked do,
departed from my God.
22
For all his Judgments in my sight,
my guides before me lay;
And from me his Decrees upright,
I did not turn away.
23
So thus with him was I sincere,
and held integrity;
Restrained my self with hand severe,
from mine iniquity.
24
Just therefore, as my Justice stands,
the Lord to me supplies:
Rewards the pureness of my hands
in his pure-sighted eyes.
25
Thou to the merciful wilt show
how merciful thou art:
Thy strong perfections make him know
that is of perfect hear.
26
So with the pure to be as pure,
thy self thou will reveal;
And with the froward wilt be sure
as frowardly to deal.
27
Thus will thou save from overthrow
poor peoples misery;
And strike the eyes of pride as low,
as they have looked too hie.
28
My candle thou shall surely light;
this darksome night of mine,
The Lord my God shall make as bright
as lightsome day to shine.
29
By thee have I dismayed an host,
and broken through them all;
And by my God, where danger most
might skare me, scaled the wall.
30
The way of God is perfect ground,
the Word of JAH is tried;
To all a shield of safety found,
whose hopes on him reside.
31
For who is God, the Lord except!
Who is a Rock of Might!
Say (ye that have to Idols crept)
and give our God his right.
32
The God that girdeth me with strength,
is he that is my stay;
And he through all my journles length,
that perfect gives my way.
33
He makes my feet as swift as Hinds,
to follow, or to fly:
He makes me stand, as ^it he finds,
upon my places hie.
34
My hands to war he does frequent,
and weapons learnes to feel:
These arms of mine to bend, and bent,
to break a bow of steel.
35
On me the shield of saving health
thou have vouchsafed to ^eat:
Thy right hand has upheld my wealth,
thy meekness made me great.
36
Beneath my feet thou did enlarge
my paths on every side:
And of my footsteps took'st such charge,
my ankles should not slide.
37
Mine enemies have I pursued,
and overtooke in flight,
And not returned, till I subdued,
and ruined them outright.
38
With wounds I stunned them in such wise,
that now to stand unmeet:
Nor ever able more to rise,
they fell beneath my feet.
39
For thou with strength have girt my ^^de,
in battle to oppose,
And under foot to tread their pride,
against me that uprose.
40
Thou, of my foes to me have brought
the necks, that under yoke
I might cut off, and bring to naught
my haters at a stroke.
41
In their distress for help they cried,
but none there was to save:
Even to the Lord, but none replied,
and he no answer gave.
42
Small as the dust before the wind
them did I peace-meale beat;
And them like outcast rubbish grind,
that strewes the myrie street.
43
From people with contentions fed
thou have delivered me;
And of the Heath'ns have made me head,
by strangers served to be.
44
To me, at hearing of the ear,
obedient shall they sit:
And to my power, dissembling fear,
the foreign shall submit.
45
The strangers sons shall shrink away,
their falsers hearts shall fail;
And in their holds afraid to stay,
their closets make their Jaile.
46
Let live the Lord, my Rock be blessed,
He that my head did raise,
The God in whom my health does rest,
exalted be with praise.
47
My praise of God the Powerful sings,
avenger of my wrongs;
That under my subjection brings
the headless peoples throngs.
48
He from my foes in safety led,
and left me free to stand;
Above my Rivals raised my head,
rid from the Tyrants hand.
49
To thee therefore will I give thanks,
O Lord, and praises frame,
Among the Heathens thickest ranks,
to sing unto thy name.
50
His Kings salvations great, he makes
for ever to succeed;
On his Anointed mercy takes,
on David and his seed.
PSALM. 19. Coeli enarrant. Victori, Psalmus David.
THe glory of the God of Heaven,
the Heavens of God declare:
The Firmament firm proof has given,
his handy-worke they are.
2
Day unto day delivers speech
in times alternate lines;
And night to night does knowledge teach,
whose light in darkness shines.
3
No speech, no language like their own,
to make their meaning found:
Their voicelesse voice all ears have known,
all heard their soundlesse sound.
4
Through all the earth their line is run,
their words the world about:
A Tabernacle for the Sun
in them has he set out.
5
Which, like a Bride groom, brightly clad,
leaves his retiring place;
And Giant-like, with gesture glad,
sets forth to run his race.
6
His beams from Heavens, each Sign and Side
their oblique round repeat;
And none there is himself can hide
from his life-breathing heat.
7
Much more the Law1 of JAH2 is pure3,
the soul4 re-purifies5
Of JAH6 the Testimony7 sure8,
and makes the simple9 wise10.
8
The Statutes1 of the Lord2 upright3,
the heart4 with joy5 suffice:
The Lords6 Commandment7 pure8, gives light9
to soule-dark-sighted eyes10.
9
The reverend fear1 of JAH2 from stain3
stands chaste4, and clean for ever5:
Of JAH6 the Judgments7 truth8 contain,
just9 are they altogether10.
10
To be desired more than gold,
than much fine gold they are:
No honey-drops the comb can hold,
for sweetness may compare.
11
Moreoever, is thy servant taught
by their admonishing,
Observing them, but as they ought,
how much reward they bring.
12
His errors who so wisely heeds,
to understand them all?
O cleanse me from my close misdeeds,
my secret faults let fall.
13
And let thy servants pride-swolne sins
get no predominance:
Thus innocence perfection wins,
made clean from much offense.
14
What I by word of mouth record,
or meditate in mind:
My Rock and my Redeemer, Lord,
with thee let favor find.
PSALM. 20. Exaudiat te Dominus. Ad Praestantem, Psalmus Davidis.
THe day that troubles thee assail,
the Lord to thee reply:
The Name of Jacobs God prevail,
to set thee up on hie.
2
Help from the Sanctuary send,
thy strong up-holder stand:
And out of Sion thee defend
from thy distressors hand.
3
Remember all thine offerings past,
thy sacrifices burn:
His fire upon thy fatlings cast,
and them to ashes turn. Selah.
4
He give to thee thy hearts desire,
accomplished at thy will:
Thy counsel with his Spirit inspire,
thy purpose all fulfill.
5
In thy salvation will we shout,
triumphant Banner spread;
And of our God the Name set out,
"Thy suits the Lord bestead.
6
Now will the Lord himself, I know,
for his Anointed stand:
Hear from his holy Heavens, let flow
health from his strong right hand.
7
Some men their trust in Chariots frame,
on Horses some, to set:
But of the Lord our God the Name
we never shall forget.
8
They fallen are, with the earth laid even,
we raised, stand upright all:
Save, Lord, and hear us King of Heaven,
what day on thee we call.
PSALM. 21. Domine, in virtute. Ad Praestantem. Psalmus Davidis.
LOrd, of thy strength with cheerful voice,
the King shall gladly tell;
And in thy saving health rejoice,
with joy that shall excel.
2
The fullness of his hearts desire,
to him thou have supplied;
And what his lips could but require,
thy love has not denied. Selah.
3
With blessings do thou him prevent,
thy goodness to unfold:
And to empale his head, have sent
a Crown of purest gold.
4
He ask't thee life's, and thou did give
above, before his vow;
Beyond the length of days, to live
for ever, did allow.
5
In thy salvations sure supply
great is his glory grown:
High Honor, Sovereign Majesty,
have thou upon him throw'n.
6
Of blessings ever-flowing streams
to him thou did impart;
And with thy countenances beams
rejoice his royal heart.
7
For to the Lord the King is nighest,
by settled trust approved;
And through the mercy of the Highest,
he shall not be removed.
8
For all thy foes, soever where,
thy hand shall search about;
And them that hate against thee bear,
thy right hand shall find out.
9
Make like a fiery oven their power,
what time thy face shall fume:
Them shall the Lord in wrath devour,
the fire shall them consume.
10
The fruit of their untimely breed,
from earth thou shall destroy,
That with the sons of men, their seed
no memory enjoy.
11
For mischief they against thee meant,
with purpose to prevail;
And evil was their sly intent,
but they shall not but fail.
12
For thou shall set them as a Butt,
and back with shame them send;
And on thy string thine arrows put,
against their faces bend.
13
Lord, in thy strength thy self up-raise,
whose strength is all thine own;
So shall our songs extol thy praise,
and make thy power be known.
PSALM. 22. Deus meus. Victori, super Cervam Aurorae. Psalm. David.
MY God, my God, my strength alone,
"Why do thou me forsake;
And from my health so far art gone,
from these loud moanes I make?
2
My God, by day to thee I call,
by day thou answerest not*
By night no ceasing, silence all
my groanings have forgot.
2
But thou continu'st Holy still,
thy Holiness does dwell,
Where praises on thy holy Hill
are sung by Israel*
4
On thee their hopes our Fathers cast,
and thou have made them good:
In thee they trusted, and thou have
their safe-deliverer stood.
5
To thee they cried, and at their cry
by thee delivered were:
In thee they trusted steadfastly,
and no reproach did bear.
6
But I, a wretched worm, forlorn,
a name from men exempt:
Of earthly men becom'n the scorn,
the peoples base contempt.
7
All they that see me thus bestead,
in mock'rie on me play:
Shoot out the lip, and shake the head,
and in derision say,
8
"He to the Lord did recommend
his trust, to be redeemed:
Let him to him deliverance send,
whom his delight esteemed.
9
Forth from the womb thou did me draw,
where cloistred I did rest;
Thou to my hopes becam'st a law
upon my mothers breast.
10
I was commended to thy hands,
cut from the navils hold:
Thou art my God, since me in bands
my mothers womb did sold.
11
O go not therefore far from hence,
for troubles near me press:
And none there is in my defense
to stand for my redress.
12
Whole herds of bullockes, hoof and head,
are round about me set:
Strong Bulls in Bashan, highly fed,
to compass me are met.
13
Their throats tooth-weapon'd, two-leav'd doors,
upon me strain their jaws:
Right so the Lion ramps and roares,
on prey to seize his paws.
14
Like waters am I shed and sunk,
my bones disparted all:
My heart amidst my bowels shrunk,
like molten wax does fall.
15
Dried like a pot-sheard is my strength,
my tongue and jaws fast glew'd:
And thou have brought me down at length,
where dust and death conclude.
16
A wicked crew of dogs composed,
did round about me meet:
And Lion-like they me enclosed,
"They p^ere't my hands and feet.
17
My bones I tell how many are,
sharp looks at me they shot.
18
My garments they among them share,
and for my coat cast lot.
19
But do not thou far off at need
thy self, O Lord, absent:
To help me from their hands, with speed
them, O my strength, prevent.
20
My soul, whom deadly foes withstand,
let not the sword devour:
Redeem my dearling from the hand,
whereof the Dog has power.
21
O from the Lions mouth, now, then,
my humbled head set free:
From horns of Unicornes, as when
thou heardst and answeredst me.
22
So then my brethren all among
thy Name will I declare;
Amidst the congregations throng,
to sing, thy praise prepare.
23
O praise him, ye that fear the Lord,
ye seed of Jacob tell
His glory ^all his fear record,
ye seed of Israel.
24
For he has not despised, nor loathed
the needy unsuppli'd:
Nor with a veil his visage clothed,
but heard him when he cried.
25
The great Assemblies solemn day,
my praise shall sing of thee:
My vows to him that I will pay,
shall they that fear him see.
26
The meek shall eat, and be sufficed,
praise they to him shall give
That seek the Lord; thus exercised,
your heart shall ever live.
27
All coasts on earth their hearts call home,
and to the Lord restore;
and all the Nations kindreds come
his presence to adore.
28
For in the Lord, the sovereign power
of Royalty remains:
and he the Lord and Governor
among the Nations reigns.
29
The fat on earth shall eat and bend,
before the food of grace:
and all that down to dust descend,
shall bow before his face.
The Potentate, the poor that eat,
shall life by eating have;
With him, whose souls unquickned heat
is yielding to the grave.
30
A seed of theirs there shall succeed,
his service to embrace:
Which to the Lord shall be decreed,
and reckoned for a race.
31
When they shall come, his righteousness
then shall their tongues declare,
To people after-borne express,
that these his doings are.
PSALM. 23. Dominus regit. Psalmus D^vidis.
MY Shepherd is the Lord, whose care
provides me fold and food:
Whose goodness plenteous, and to spare,
supplies my want of good.
2
In pastures green he makes me lie,
and softly lodge my side:
He leads me forth, where pleasantly
the streams of stillnesse glide.
3
He does return my soul again,
and for his own Names sake,
Conducts me through the beaten plain,
that Justice treads to make.
4
Walked I the shady Vale of death,
none evil would I fear:
Thy rod, thy staff, relieve my breath,
for thou art with me there.
5
My table spread do thou appoint
in presence of my foes:
My head with oil thou do anoint,
my chalice over-flowes.
6
With goodness sure shall mercy give
an eye to all my ways;
And in the Lords house shall I live,
beyond the length of days.
PSALM. 24. Domini est terra. Psalmus Davidis.
THe earth, with all those mines unfound,
within her womb that swell,
Is all the Lords! the Worlds great round,
and they that therein dwell.
2
He founded it upon the seas,
and shor'd them under ground:
Established fast the solid Leas,
the liquid floods to bound.
3
The Hill of JAH who shall ascend,
so high to set his feet?
Who in his holy place attend,
for such a service meet?
4
He that clean palms, pure heart has borne,
his soul to vanity
^th not up-lifted, has not sworn
an oath deceitfully.
5
He from the Lord on him bestowed
a blessing shall receive;
and justice shall the mighty God
of his salvation give.
6
Of them that seek him, this the race,
this Jacobs Israel:
^f them that strive to seek thy face,
this Jacobs Peniel. Selah.
7
Lift up your heads, ye doors be raised,
eternal gates gives way,
That enter, highly to be praised,
the King of Glory may.
8
Who is the King of Glory? this,
whose praises spread so far?
The strong and mighty Lord it is,
the mighty Lord of war.
9
Lift up your heads, ye doors be raised,
eternal gates give way,
That enter, highly to be praised,
the King of Glory may.
10
Who is the King of Glory? this,
of whom our praises sing?
The Mighty Lord of hosts it is,
of GLORY he is King. Selah.
PSALM. 25. Ad te, Domin^. Davidis Acrostichon.
(...)
AS, Lord, to thee I lift my soul,
(...) 2
Because I trust in thee,
My God: Let not confusion foul,
nor foes insult on me.
(...) 3
Give not their hopes, that thee attend,
to take a shameful stain:
Let shame confound them that offend,
and have no cause to faigne.
(...) 4
Direct me, Lord, thy ways to know,
thy paths to me make plain:
Within thy bounds my steps bestow,
and teach me to contain.
(...) 5
How in thy truth to tread impart,
and make me learn the way:
For of my health the God thou art,
(...) whom I attend all day.
(...) 6
Zeal of thy kind compassions mind,
remember, Lord, that care:
Thy tender mercies ma^e me find,
for they for ever are.
(...) 7
Hold, on my youthful faults forepast,
remember not to take;
Of mercy mind how much thou have,
Lord, for thy goodness sake.
(...) 8
The Lord is good and righteous eyed,
transgressors to instruct:
The sinners therefore will he guide,
and in their way conduct.
(...) In judgment just to tread upright,
the humble he will stay:
And where they wander, wanting light,
will learn the meek his way.
(...) 10
Continual are the Lords paths cast
in Truths and Mercies mold;
To such as keep his Covenant fast,
his Testimonies hold.
(...) 11
Lord, to thy Names great power herein,
let me my pardon owe:
And on the greatness of my sin
thy greater mercy show.
(...) 12
Make known the man with mind entire,
that fears the Lord: the way
That he shall choose he will inspire,
and learn him how to lay.
(...) 13
Now (goodness gotten to his hand)
his soul in good shall dwell:
His seed inherit shall the land,
that to his fathers fell.
(...) 14
Secret that from the Lord descends,
do they that fear him find:
To such his Covenant he commends,
and makes them know his mind.
(...) 15
On Jah-the-Lord mine eyes are set
continually to look:
To bring my feet out of the net,
whose hand has undertook.
(...) 16
Prevent me, and with gracious look
thy face on me reflect:
Whom solitary, poor, forsook,
(discomforts all) deject.
(...) 17
The sorrows of my heart enlarged,
my less'ned heart oppress:
O set me from these toiles discharged,
and free me from distress.
(...) 18
Remorse on mine afflictions cast,
regard how much I grieve:
Make even for all my faults fore-past,
and all my sins forgive.
(...) 19
Regard my foes insatiate,
what multitudes they lead,
That bear a heart-infected hate
against my harmless head.
(...) 20
Sustain my helpless soul alive,
and safe deliver me;
But let not shame my fall contrive,
because I trust in thee.
(...) 21
True perfectness and right let dwell
with me, that wait on thee:
(...) 22
Preserve, O God, thine Israel
from all his troubles free.
PSALM. 26. Iudica me, Domine. Davidis.
JUdge me, O Lord, I walk the way
that perfectness does guide:
My trust upon the Lord I lay,
and therefore shall not slide.
2
Examine, Lord, what I have been,
sound what I ever did:
Search out my reins, what there unclean;
my heart, what there lies hid.
3
Thy mercy is before mine eyes,
thy truth my walks repeat:
4
I sit not down with men of lies,
nor enter with deceit.
5
The evil doers I eschew,
their Synagogue I hate:
Nor have I with the wicked crew
in their Assembly sat.
6
My hands, Lord, washed in innocence,
thine Altar compast round:
7
With thankful voice will I commence,
thy wonders all to sound.
8
The habitation of thy House
have I, O Lord, loved well:
The place where thou art glorious,
the house where I would dwell.
9
O gather not my soul, to rest
where sinners souls abide:
And on my life lay no inquest,
where men of bloods are tried.
10
Whose hands accomplish wicked drifts,
which mischiefs head contrives;
And their right hand is full of gifts,
whose bargain Brib'rie drives.
11
Of this perfection I have got,
however thou esteem;
Yet my perfection urge I not,
in mercy me redeem.
12
My foot upon so firm a ground
stands steadfast and upright;
That I, O Lord, thy praise will sound
in great Assemblies sight.
PSALM. 27. Dominus, illuminario. Davidis.
THe Lord my Savior is my light,
of whom am I afraid?
The Lord is of my life the might,
by whom to be dismayed?
2
When wicked men with malice armed,
my foes in fury fell,
To eat my flesh, against me swarmed,
they stumbled, and they fell.
3
Encamp't against me, not an host
should make my heart afraid;
Should warlike troops fill every coast,
in this my trust is stayed.
4
For one suit to the Lord I sue,
his house for life to hold:
Those beauties of the Lord to view*
his Palace to behold.
5
For his Pavillion will he spread,
in troublous time to hide;
And on a rock advance my head,
in secret by his side.
6
Above my foes now round about,
my head shall be up-rais'd:
And JAH, with joy his tents throughout,
in hosts and hymns be praised.
7
Unto my voice, O Lord, give ear,
upon thee when I call:
And my request in mercy hear,
but answer me withal.
8
When, "Seek my face thou said to me,
with ecchoing touch of grace,
My heart advertised, answered thee,
"Lord, I will seek thy face.
9
Thy face from me then do not hide,
thy seeker to defeat;
Nor from thy servant turn aside,
in thy displeasures heat.
My succor (not to be forgot)
thou have been heretofore:
God of my health, now leave me not,
forsake me now no more.
10
Should me my fathers wiser care,
my mothers love forsake:
Though she that bare me, me forbear,
the Lord would me up take.
11
Teach me, O Lord, thy way to tread,
where thy safe conduct lies;
And in the path of Rightnesse lead,
from my observers eyes.
12
Give me not to my foes desire,
for falsehoods evidence;
With him against me does conspire,
that breath's out violence.
13
As I believed, so faith to me
did firm assurance give,
The goodness of the Lord to see,
within their land that live.
14
Attend the Lord with courage bold,
be strong, and stay the end:
Confirm thy heart to hold thy hold,
upon the Lord attend.
PSALM. 28. Ad te Domine. Davidis.
ON thee, O Lord my Rock, I call,
deafe-ceasing cease to be;
Lest down the pit, like them that fall,
thy silence silence me.
2
The voice of my petitions hear,
when for thy grace I cry:
When to thy holy Adyte near,
I lift my hands on hie.
3
Draw me not with the wicked sort,
that work with sinful art,
That to their neighbors peace report,
but malice press in heart.
4
Pay them what they to pass have brought,
the evil they devised:
And by the works their hands have wrought,
be their reward assiz'd.
5
Because what deeds the Lord has done,
his hand they will not heed:
Down shall he break them every one,
and build up no such breed.
6
Blessed be the Lord, to whom I strained
the voice of mine un-rest:
Whose gracious ear has entertained,
and heard my whole request.
7
The Lord my strength is, and my shield,
my hearts, my hopes success:
Joy to my heart, whose help does yield,
him shall my song confess.
8
The Lord with strength does still support
the flock that he enfolds;
And of salvations is the Fort,
that his Anointed holds.
9
O save the people of thy flock,
bless thine inheritance;
Feed them, and on thy favors rock
for ever them advance.
PSALM. 29. Afferte Domino. Psalmus Davidis.
GIve to the Lord, ye men of Might,
ye sons of Mighty race,
Give glory to the Lord, his right;
all strength to his give place.
2
Give to the Lord his Names renown
before his holy Seat:
Your selves unto the Lord bow down,
his beauteous honor greet.
3
The voice that forth on waters breaks,
it is the Lord that-bounds:
The glorious God in thunder speaks,
the Lord on seas re-sounds.
4
The Lord sends forth a mighty noise,
when power his power withstands:
The Lord gives out a sovereign voice,
when Majesty commands.
5
When lofty Cedars broken lie,
his voice the Lord extends:
Of Lebanon the Cedars high
the Lord in sunder rends.
6
He makes them like a Heifer trip,
proud of his velvet horns;
So Lebanon, so Shirion skip,
so skip young Unicornes.
7
The Lords voice shoots out flames of fire,
JAH'S voice the Desert shakes:
8
To tremble, if the Lord transpire,
the Desert Cadesh makes.
9
JAH'S voice makes Hinds bring forth their young,
the Forrest-brood makes bare:
And in his Temple every tongue
his glory can declare.
10
The Lord sat Sovereign, at the flood
the Lord for ever reigns;
For sinners judgment, for the good
his Mercy-seat ordaines.
11
Strength to his people, their strong Rock,
the Mighty Lord will give:
The blessing he will give his flock,
shall be in peace to live.
PSALM. 30. Exaltabo te, Domine. Psalmus Cantici: Dedicationis domus David.
I Will extol thee, Lord Most-Hie,
so high-extoll'd by thee:
That have not left an enemy
to triumph over me.
2
Thee, Lord my God, my cry besought,
thou heald'st me instantly:
3
My soul from Hell thou Lord have brought,
revived me from-to-die.
4
O ye his Saints, the praises sing,
that to the Lord belong:
Before his holy presence bring
a thanks-remembring song.
5
For but the twinkling of an eye
his angers moment lasts:
But life on frail mortality
his gracious favor casts.
An evening weeping may out-weare,
and tears with midnight mourn:
But mirth at morning will appear,
and joy with light return.
6
In my prosperity I said,
moved shall I never be.
7
My mountain, Lord, so strongly laid,
thy favor raised to me.
Thy face from me yet did thou hide,
and I was troubled soon:
8
Then Lord to thee for grace I cried,
to thee, Lord, made my moan.
9
What profit in my blood can be,
when I descend the pit?
Shall dust to tender thanks to thee,
or tell thy truth be fit?
10
Hear, Lord, of thee what I request,
and mercy on me take:
O do not me that am distressed,
my helper, Lord, forsake.
11
To joyful dancing have thou turned
my sorrows doleful sound:
My sackcloth loosed, wherein I mourned,
with gladness girt me round.
12
That so may my uncessant tongue,
(my glory) tune thy praise:
Thanks, Lord, to thee my God be sung,
to endless length of days.
PSALM. 31. In te Domine speravi. Ad Praestantem. Psalmus David.
MY confidence on thee I ground,
shamed let me never be:
As Justice does in thee abound,
O Lord, deliver me.
2
Bow down thine ear, I may be heard,
with speed on me reflect:
My rock of strength, my house of guard,
in safety me protect.
3
For thou my rock and fortress tried,
whatever path I tread,
Wilt for thy Name sake be my guide,
and all my footing lead.
4
To bring me forth out of the net,
for me in secret laid,
Thy force against their falsehood set;
thy strength is all my aid.
5
From death and deaths eternal bands,
by thee redeemed, my spirit,
Do I again into thy hands,
Lord God of truth, commit.
6
I hate them that observers are
of lying vanities:
My confidences settled care
upon the Lord relies.
7
I will with glad and joyful spleen
thy mercies praise express:
For my affliction have thou seen,
and known my souls distress.
8
Nor have thou shut me in the hand
of my malignant foe;
But for my feet made place to stand,
and room at large to go.
9
On me since yet distress is drawn,
let Lord thy mercy shine:
Mine eye, my soul, my belly gnaw'n,
with ind^gnation pine.
10
My life with woe is worn to naught,
my years in sighing spent:
My strength, my sins have over-wrought,
my bones are gnaw'n and rent.
11
Reproach of all my foes I bear,
my neighbors vehemently,
And my familiars, struck with fear,
my sight that meet me fly.
12
My self a dead man out of mind,
and in men's hearts forgot,
As vile and use-lesse held I find,
as is a broken pot.
13
For I have heard the multitude
with slanders me dismay;
Against me counsel, and conclude
to take my soul away.
14
But, Lord, thou art my God, I said
my trust relies on thee:
15
My times that in thy hand are laid,
from hostile hand set free.
16
And on thy light-lesse servant make
thy faces light to shine:
O save me for thy mercy sake,
from this distress of mine.
17
Lord, let not shame have share in me,
for on thee do I call:
Confounded let the wicked be,
to Hell, strook-silent fall.
18
Of lying lips the lavish foords
let forth no further break,
Which hard disdainful spiteful words
against the Just man speak.
19
How plentiful thy bounties be,
which thou have laid in store,
For them that fear and trust in thee,
the sons of men before!
20
Them in thy faces secret hide,
from proud insulters wrongs;
In thy Pavillion laid aside
secure from strife of tongues.
21
Blessed be the Lord, that wondrously
his mercy has dispenc't;
And me in safety set to lie
within a City fenc't.
22
Amazed, I said, before thine eyes,
cut off, and cast away;
The voice yet heardst thou of my cries,
when I to thee did pray.
23
O love the Lord, all ye his Saints,
for faithful doers ways
The Lord preserves from all attaints,
the haughty home repaies.
24
Be strong, endure, and do your parts,
the Lord will in the end
Establish your encouraged hearts,
whose hopes on him depend.
PSALM. 32. Beati quorum. Davidis Maschil.
Blessed is he, whose transgression
has free forgiveness gained:
And he, whose sin that he has done,
a covering has obtained.
2
Blessed is the man, unto whose charge
the Lord imputes no sin;
Whose spirit no hollow holds so large,
to lodge deceit therein.
3
When now my tongue all speech forborne,
in painful silence lay:
Through my loud roaring daily worn,
my bones with age decay.
4
For day and night with weight so great,
thine hand upon me lies,
That like the drought in summers heat,
my kindly moisture dries. Selah.
5
I did acknowledge unto thee
the sin that I had done:
Of mine iniquity in me
I have concealed none.
6
My sin, I said, I will repeat,
and to the Lord confess:
And of my crime thy mercy great,
forgave the wickedness. Selah.
7
Now therefore every Saint shall pray,
while time to find is found:
Sure, reach him none there is that may,
when many waters sound.
8
From troubles heat my head to shade,
thou art a secret place:
With songs for my deliverance made,
thou shall about me trace. Selah.
9
I will instruct, and teach thee so,
thou shall not walk awry:
And in the way that thou shall go,
give counsel with mine eye.
10
O do not ye like Horse, like Mule,
no understanding bear;
Whose mouth must bit and bridle rule,
to thee for coming near.
11
Much sorrow swells on every side,
to plague the wicked race:
But in the Lord whose hopes abide,
him mercy shall embrace.
12
Joy in the Lord, ye Just rejoice,
shout out your glad delight,
As well in gesture, as in voice,
all ye of heart upright.
PSALM. 33. Exultate Iusti.
YE Just, be joyful in the Lord;
becomes the righteous praise:
2
Harp, Violl, Voice, and Decachord,
to praise the Lord up raise.
3
A new set-song to him endite,
loud notes to musickes height:
4
For of the Lord the Word is right,
and all his work in faith.
5
His love on Justice he bestows,
desire with Judgment dwells:
Of mercy from the Lord that flows
the earth with fullness swells.
6
The Heavens by word the Lord did frame,
and as his mouth did breathe,
His spirit made all the host of them
above Sun, and beneath.
7
The sea he bounds within the shore,
on heaps the waters keeps:
As into treasuries of store
he gives up the deeps.
8
To fear the Lord, all Regions call,
on earth, through every land:
And in the world the dwellers all,
in awe of him to stand*
9
For as he spoke, the word once past,
the work forthwith was done:
As he commanded, it stood fast,
his word and deed were one.
10
That Heathen counsel is destroi'd,
the peoples plots cast out;
And all their purposes made void,
the Lord can bring about.
11
The counsel by the Lord decreed
shall stand for ever sure:
The thoughts that from his heart proceed,
to age and age endure.
12
O blessed Nation, whom the Lord
to be their God does bless:
Blessed people, whom his own accord
has chosen to possess.
13
The Lord, all Adams sons to see,
in Heaven his station plants:
14
All from his Mansion vieweth he,
the earths Inhabitants.
15
Their heart he fashioned all alone,
the cloisters of their thought;
Considers all what they have done,
the works that they have wrought.
16
Say, he command a copious Host,
no King so saves his right:
No Mighty man, whose might is most,
delivered is by might.
17
A rest unsafe to save a man
a Horse falls out to be;
Nor he by strength, strive all he can,
can set his Rider free.
18
Behold, the Lord his heedfull eye
on them that fear him bends:
Upon his mercies safe supply,
whose settled hope attends.
19
When earth exacts her due of earth,
to free their soul from death;
To keep alive in time of death,
when famine faints for breath.
20
Our soul her hopes assured hold
upon the Lord does build:
Of whose defense we may be bold,
he is our help and shield.
21
Our heart in him shall gladness pure,
and perfect joy conceive;
That in his holy Name secure
our hopes assurance leave.
22
Thy mercies gifts, O Lord, down send,
on us so free to fall;
As we to thee our trust commend,
to measure them withal.
PSALM. 34. Benedicam Domino. Davidis, cum mutavit sensum suum ante Abimelech,
and relegavit eum, and abiit. Acroflichon.
(...)
ALl times to bless the Lord, will I
occasions all prevent;
And make my mouth continually
his praises instrument.
(...) 2
Be thou, O Lord, my souls sole choice,
my glories sovereign head:
The meek shall hear it and rejoice,
by my example led.
(...) 3
Greatly extol the Lord with me.
such praise together frame,
As with his greatness may agree,
to magnify his Name.
(...) 4
Desirous that the Lord should hear,
I sought him, and he heard,
And sent me out of all my fear
deliverance un-deferr'd.
(...) 5
Him to behold, to him they flowed,
his light did them inflame:
(...) Upon their faces fell no cloud,
no blush, the brand of shame.
(...) 6
Zealous, this poor man cried and craved
so loud, for some redress,
That soon the Lord him heard and saved,
from all his deep distress.
(...) 7
Hovering about them, in pitched field*
JAH'S Angel spreads his wings:
To them that fear him, for a shield
to them releasement brings.
(...) 8
Taste but how good the Lord, and see
what blessings down he sends:
O blessed, blessed man is he,
whose trust on him attends!
(...) In fear, ye Saints, that serve the Lord,
to serve him set your mind:
All plenty does his fear afford,
no want his fearers find.
(...) 10
Courageous Lions hunger-pin'd,
how poorly seek they food!
But they that seek the Lord shall find
no want, shall want no good.
(...) 11
Learn, sons, come listen unto me,
my doctrine with you bear:
Your faithful teacher will I be,
how ye the Lord shall fear.
(...) 12
Man, who art thou, that would live long,
and see good days the while?
(...) No evill-teller, keep thy tongue,
thy lips from speaking guile.
(...) 13
Shun evils out-side-falsers face,
the in-side-foule eschew:
Occasion to do good embrace,
seek peace, her steps pursue.
(...) 14
His ears as to the Just to heed,
so bends the Lord his eyes:
His eyes observers of their need,
his ears to hear their cries.
(...) 15
Put against them that evil do,
firm sets the Lord his face,
That out may their memorial go,
cut off from earth their race.
(...) 16
True sorrows guests, the poor they cry,
the Lord their crying hears:
His aid to them does he apply,
and all their troubles cleeres.
(...) 17
Care-broken hearts to them that have,
the Lord is ever near;
And he the contrite spirit will save,
his care with comfort cheer.
(...) 18
Redundant evils many fall,
and on the Just increase:
Yet soon delivered from them all,
the Lord will him release.
(...) 19
Summed up, he safeguards every bone,
their number and their state,
That broken of them goes not one
to deaths returnlesse gate.
(...) 20
The passage home shall mischief thrust,
the wicked man to slay:
Just hand on them that hate the Just,
a guilty death shall lay.
(...) 21
His servants soul the Lord redeemes,
so dear to him esteemed*
And none, whose trust of him esteems,
as guilty shall be deemed.
PSALM. 35. Iudica, Domine. Davidis.
MY right, O Lord, against them plead,
that plead against my right:
My powers to fight against them lead,
whose powers against me fight.
2
Upon thy dart-despising shield
and buckler lay thy hand:
In my defense to fight the field,
and up to help me stand.
3
Charge lance and sword, and stop the way
where any me pursu'th:
Soul, I am thy salvation, say,
say to my soul for truth.
4
Confusion let them never lack,
that seek my souls surprise:
Their branded faces shame send back,
my evil that devise.
5
Driven as the chafe before the wind,
let breath their burden bear:
The Angel of the Lord behind,
them scattering here and there.
6
Let dark and slippery be their way,
and let (that they may fall)
The Angel of the Lord dismay,
and persecute them all.
7
For closely they their net have rigged,
corruptly to entoile;
And causlesly a pit have dug,
to make my soul their spoil.
8
Let desolation unawares,
and headlong him forestall;
And caught in his own secret snares,
selfe-mischiefe make him fall.
9
And let my soul her solace sing,
that in the Lord I find:
What joy does his salvation bring,
what music to my mind?
10
Which were my tongue enforced to stay,
and silent-strooke in me:
My bones would all break forth, and say,
Lord, who is like to thee,
That bringst deliverance to the poor,
from hand for him too strong:
The poore-afflicted from the door,
where rapine dwells and wrong?
11
False-witnesse did against me rise,
avouching terms untrue;
And they to charge me did devise,
with what I never knew.
12
My good with evil they repaid,
and for my recompense,
My barren soul by them fore-laid,
berest of all defense.
13
But as for me, when sick they were,
in sackcloth weed I mourned:
My humbled soul did food forbear,
my bosom'd-praier returned.
14
I walked, as if I had been one
had lost a friend or brother;
I bowed down sadly, as a son,
that sorroweth for his mother.
15
But in my halting, glad together,
the abject-scourges got:
In spite or scorn, I knew not whether,
to rend me, resting not.
16
With flatterers, flouting Parasites
at riotous Revells met,
To feast their feasters with delight,
their teeth against me whet.
17
This, Lord, how long will thou behold?
my soul from tumult free:
My dearling from the Lions hold,
let safely rescued be.
18
So in the great Assembly thanks
to thee will I present:
And through a mighty peoples ranks,
will make thy praise be sent.
19
O make not my false-hearted foes
triumphers over me:
With causlesse hate, their eyes which close,
and sleering will not see.
20
For why? they speak not peace as friends,
but bear us fair in hand,
To cross with their deceitful ends
the quiet of the land.
21
Their mouth on me they opened wide,
and full of scorn and ire:
Aha, Aha, Our eye has spied,
(said they) our hearts desire.
22
Thou, Lord, have seen all this excess,
then hold not thou thy tongue:
From me, O Lord, in this distress
depart not far, nor long.
23
Arise, and make no longer pause,
to judge my right awake:
My God, my Lord, to plead my cause,
of mine thine own it make.
24
As Justice is thy touch, to try,
judge, Lord my God, of me:
And let not their unrighteous eye,
my fall, their triumph see.
25
Let them not say within their heart,
Ha, this our soul would have:
Let them not say, We for our part
have made our throat his grave.
26
Abash't confusion cloud their face,
that at my hurt rejoice:
Shame be their shroud, to my disgrace
that magnify their voice.
27
But joyful shouting raise their spirit,
and give their gladness way:
That in my Justice take delight,
this always let them say,
28
"Thy servant prospers more, the more
"his proud oppressors cease:
"The Lord be magnified therefore,
"that loves his servants peace.
29
And so thy Justice shall fulfill
the music of my tongue:
Upon thy praise shall be my skill
to descant all day long.
PSALM. 36. Dixit Insipiens. Ad Praestantem, servi Domini David.
TRansgression of the wicked cries
(within my heart I hear)
Assuredly before his eyes
of God there is no fear.
2
For flatt'rie is the glozing dress,
wherewith his eyes he blinds,
Until his hateful wickedness
an end as hateful finds.
3
Of wicked words, and sly deceit,
his mouth powr's out a flood:
His heart for wisdom is no sear,
his deeds dis-us'd to good.
4
In bed his mischief he begets,
and throw's in thought-full breast:
Himself in no good way he sets,
nor evil does detest.
5
Thy mercy, Lord, to Heaven extends,
the Heavens are not so hie:
Thy faithfulness the clouds transcends,
transcends the highest sky.
6
Thy Justice, as Gods Mountains steep,
list up a losty crest:
Thy Judgments are a mighty deep,
thou, Lord, sav'st man and beast.
7
How good, O God, how precious things
thy mercy does enclose:
When under shadow of thy wings
men's sons their trust repose!
8
The fatness of thy house, their fill
on them thou shall bestow;
And of the streams to drink at will,
from whence thy pleasures flow.
9
For why? of life from thee that streams,
the fountain is with thee:
We in thy lights resplendent beams,
enlightened light shall see.
10
To them that know thee, through this light
thy tender love extend;
To them that are in heart upright,
thy Justice recommend.
11
Let not the lofty foot of pride
invade me from on hie:
Let not the wicked arm provide
a hand to make me fly.
12
There are they fallen, that wickedness
with travel exercise:
Down are they cast without redress,
or able means to rise.
PSALM. 37. Noli aemulari. Davidis, Acrostichon.
(...) AT evil doers evil deeds
repine not, though they thrive:
Envy them not, when well succeeds
what wicked heads contrive.
2
For as the grass to ripeness grow'n,
down shall they soon be cut;
And withered like the green herb mow'n,
whereto the sith is put.
(...) 3
Build on the Lord thy trust; do good,
and dwelling in this mind,
Dwell in the land, where store of food
thy faith shall surely find.
4
Upon the Lord set thy delight,
thy vows let him inspire;
And he thy service shall requite
above thy hearts desire.
(...) 5
Go to the Lord to lead thy way,
thy trust to him commit:
And he thy steps shall (walking) stay,
and make thy hopes to hit.
6
Thy Justice clear as is the light,
his furnace shall refine:
The day at noon shines not so bright,
as shall thy Justice shine.
(...) 7
Dumb-silent on the Lord attend,
undaunted at his way,
That prospers, when malignant end
his sly devices lay.
(...) 8
Hold off from anger, wrath assuage,
fret not thy self a whit;
Lest like transgressors, in thy rage
like evil thou commit.
9
For evil doers best success
themselves cut off shall end:
The earth shall they and theirs possess,
that on the Lord attend.
(...) 10
Well, yet a little while expect,
the wicked shall not be:
Thine eye upon his place reflect,
they are not His, nor He.
11
They shall possess the earths increase,
that are of humble sp'rit:
And in the multitude of peace,
shall set their whole delight.
(...) 12
Zealously bent against the Just,
the wicked grinds his teeth:
13
The Lord shall laugh to scorn his trust,
whose day at hand he sees.
(...) 14
Hand on the sword un-sheath'd, and bow
fore-bent, the wicked lay:
The poor afflicted down to throw,
the upright-wai'd to slay.
15
Their sword on them his point shall try,
and through their heart shall pierce:
The bows they bent shall broken lie,
wherewith they were so fierce.
(...) 16
The little that the Just possess
availes to better steed,
Than wicked riches, never less,
than when they most exceed.
17
For broken shall be found the arms,
where to the wicked trust:
But with his powerful arm, from harms,
the Lord upholds the Just.
(...) 18
Instructed in the Perfect's ways,
the Lord has his forecast:
An heritage before them lays,
that shall for ever last.
19
In them shall shame inure no stain,
when evil times grow rough:
And in the days that dearth does reign,
then shall they have enough.
(...) 20
Consumed yet wicked men in haste,
JAH'S foes shall soon decay;
As fat of lambs, as smoke does waste,
shall they consume away.
(...) 21
Large sums the wicked borrowing, shifts,
and nothing pays again:
The Just is bountiful in gifts,
of mercy makes his gain.
22
In him shall they that blessed are
possess the earths increase:
But they that in his curse have share,
cut off (and soon) shall cease.
(...) 23
Man's steps, where-ever-so he treads,
the Lord upholder stays:
His way to him delightful leads,
and to his liking lays.
24
He through his frailty though he fall,
away shall not be cast:
For to uphold his hand withal,
a hand, O Lord, thou have.
(...) 25
Now I that have been young, am old,
the Just man and his seed,
Yet never did mine eye behold
forsook, nor seeking bread.
26
All day, he mercy shows and lends,
not lessening so his heap:
His seed that from his loins descends,
the more in blessing reap.
(...) 27
Shun evils evil neighborhood,
no dwelling near that door:
Depart from evil, and do good,
and dwell for evermore.
28
The Lord loves Judgment, and will not
forsake his Saints at need:
Preserved for ever is their lot,
cut off the wicked seed.
(...) 29
The soil the Just inherit shall
for their possession:
The termlesse term perpetual,
that they shall dwell thereon.
(...) 30
Plenty that in the Just abounds,
from forth his floud-gates breaks:
His mouth the deeps of wisdom sounds,
his tongue of Judgment speaks.
31
Go where he will, stay or depart,
he has a perfect guide:
His great Gods Law is in his heart,
his footing shall not slide.
(...) 32
To stall the Just man in his way,
the wicked sets his watch:
And takes occasion him to slay,
advantage if he catch.
33
And though he fall into his hand,
the Lord there leaves him not:
Accused in judgment though he stand,
the sentence is forgot.
(...) 34
Cleave to the Lord, and keep his way,
and he shall hold up thee,
To hold the land: whence cut away
the wicked thou shall see.
(...) 35
Ruffling the wicked have I seen,
in highest pride of all:
Wide-spreading, like a Laurel green,
and like a Cedar, tall.
36
He past away, and lo was gone
this Lord of so much ground;
I sought him, but of such a one,
no footstep could be found.
(...) 37
See and observe the Perfects close,
the righteous man attend,
What ever pressure him oppose,
peace is his after-end.
38
Together, where transgressors all
shall be destroi'd in haste:
Of wicked men, their endless fall
shall cut them off at last.
(...) 39
To all the righteous, from the Lord
does their salvation flow:
Whose strength to them does strength afford,
when trouble strikes them low.
By them the Lord their helper stands,
deliverer of the Just;
Deliverer-safe from wicked hands,
because in him they trust.
PSALM. 38. Domine, ne in furore. Psalmus Davidis ad commemorandum.
MY faults, let no reproof of thine,
Lord, in thy wrath repeat:
Nor chastise any crime of mine
in thy displeasures heat.
2
A shower of arrows shot from thee,
come storming on my crown:
And some of them stick fast in me,
thy hand does press me down.
3
My flesh is all un-sound within,
in thy displeasure lest:
My bones, by reason of my sin,
are of their peace berest.
4
My wickednesses heaped store,
above my head is gone:
The burden of them is too sore,
for me to bear alone.
5
My festred stripes a loathsome sent,
my foolishness bewray:
6
So crooked I, so bowed, so bent,
go mourning all the day.
7
My flanks inflamed with scorching smarts,
that in my boiles abound:
My flesh, that has so many parts,
not any part has sound.
8
I feeble am, and broken sore,
in mine unquiet fits:
For grief of heart I groan and roar,
my pain so near me sits.
9
Before thee, Lord, my whole desire,
my sighs not hid from thee:
10
My heart does pant, my strength expire,
mine eyesight not with me.
11
Alooffe my loving neighbors stood,
before my stroke at hand:
My friends, the nearest of my blood,
strove who should furthest stand.
12
And they that seek my soul, set snares,
that evil search and say:
To circumvent me unawares,
went musing all the day.
13
I like a deaf man am become,
that hears no sound at all:
As from whose mouth (a man struck dumb)
not any word does fall.
14
As one not hearing, held I fast
mine ears, mine answers hold;
As one un-meeke, reproves to cast,
whose mouth was not the mold.
15
Because, O Lord, I wait for thee,
for thee my hopes awake:
Thou, Lord my God, shall answer me,
and answer for me make.
16
Hear me in this distress (said I)
lest they rejoice at me:
And when my foot but steps awry,
they magnify to see.
17
And ready sure I am to halt,
so hard thy hand does strain:
Continually with fresh assault,
before me is my pain.
18
My crimes I freely will confess,
and openly declare:
Be sorry for my sins excess,
with un dissembled care.
19
Yet live my mighty foe^ the while,
their power with mine compare:
And they that doubled hate with guile,
how multiplied they are!
20
And they that evil pay for good,
for gain return me loss:
Against me that for goodness stood,
ungraciously stand cross.
21
Me do not thou, O Lord, forsake,
nor far from me be gone:
22
My God, more haste to help me make,
Lord, my salvation.
PSALM. 39. Dixi custodiam. Ad Praestantem, ad Ieduthun, Psalmus David.
WHat ways my wary foot shall press,
I will (said I) take heed:
And with my tongue lest I transgress,
advisedly proceed.
My mouth from speaking word amiss,
as with a bridle curb,
Before me while the wicked is,
lest some distaste disturb.
2
With stillness dumb I nothing spoke,
from terms I did refrain,
Even good, until my heart did ache,
and troubled, was my pain.
3
My heart was hot in my desire,
which silence smoth'red long:
While thus I mused, out burst the fire,
then spoke I with my tongue.
4
Lord, make me know my journies end,
the measure of my days:
That I may learn what is to spend,
how ceasing soon my ways.
5
Lo, t^ou have given my days a span,
my world as nothing plain:
Before thee every settled man
is (doubtless) wholly vain. Selah.
6
Sure, shadow-like, man makes a show,
in vain they vex their mind:
He heaps up goods, and does not know
what gatherer them shall find.
7
And now, Lord, what do I expect?
on whom do I attend?
On thee do all my hopes reflect,
in thee begin and end.
8
From all my foes deliver me,
that on my shame encroach;
And make me not for faults to thee,
to be the fools reproach.
9
As one struck dumb, deprived of sense,
complaint my mouth made none;
Nor opened once that two-leav'd fence,
for thou did what was done.
10
Thy plague away from me revoke,
more than I can withstand:
That am consumed by the stroke
of thy resistlesse hand.
11
When man for sin thy chastning wroth,
with stripes calls home again:
Thou melt'st his beauty like a Moth;
sure, earthly man is vain. Selah.
12
Hear, Lord, my prayer, and with thine ears,
consider of my cries:
Hold not thy peace, my speaking tears,
hot-showring from mine eyes.
For I a stranger am with thee,
nor seat have certain here:
A sojourner thou harbour'st me,
as all my fathers were.
13
O spare me with a little breath,
my strength to me restore:
Before I go from hence to death,
and then I be no more.
PSALM. 40. Expectans expectavi. Ad Praestantem, Davidis Psalmus.
AS waiting for the Lord I stayed,
I waited patiently;
And he to me with present aid
inclining, heard my cry.
2
He brought me from the groaning pit,
out of the my'rie clay:
Upon a rock my feet did fit,
and ord'red all my way.
3
He gave into my mouth a song,
that newly was compiled:
A Psalm to praise that did belong,
and to our God was styled.
This sight shall many eyes behold,
and fear what he has done:
Their hopes shall on the Lord lay hold,
by my example won.
4
Blessed is the man, whose hopes reflect
upon the Lord his eyes:
That to the proud gives no respect,
nor such as turn to lies.
5
O Lord my God, thy wonders wrought,
thy thoughts, no thought of man:
As thou to us, to thee has brought,
nor bring in order, can.
6
When I to speak of them address,
and would their sum declare;
Names greater than I can express,
past number sums they are.
7
No sacrifice did thou desire,
yet opened have mine ears:
Nor offring-burnt for sin require,
which bloud-stain'd Altar bears.
8
My self I come, then (said I) lo,
the booke-roll to attest:
Thy will, my God, I joy to do,
thy Law is in my breast.
9
I to the great Assembly told,
the Justice that thou show:
Nor shall my lips refrain, behold,
and that, O Lord, thou know.
10
Thy Justice did I not obscure,
hid in my heart to dwell:
Thy faithfulness did I assure,
and thy salvation tell.
Thy loving kindness have I not,
nor yet thy truth concealed:
Nor in the great concourse forgot,
to make them both revealed.
11
Withold not, thou, O Lord, from me
thy tender bowels store:
Thy mercy, and thy truth let be
my safeguards evermore.
12
For evils more than may be told
have round-environ'd me:
My sins on me have caught such hold,
I have no power to see.
The hairs upon my head that grow,
in number they exceed:
My heart with trouble stricken low,
forsakes me at my need.
13
Lord, let it be thy pleasure now,
to safe deliver me:
O Lord, to help me hasten thou,
as able, ready be.
14
Shames loading let them never lack,
that would my soul destroy:
Abash't confusion drive them back,
that at my evil joy.
15
Let desolation be their pay,
the pension of their shame,
Aha, Aha, to me that say,
and make my grief their game.
16
Let those that seek thee all, always
with joy in thee abide:
Let thy salvations lovers say,
"The Lord be magnified.
17
On me that poor and needy stand,
yet thinks the Lord my stay:
My help with thy redeeming hand,
my God, make no delay.
PSALM. 41. Beat us vir, qui intelligit. Ad Praestantem, Psalmus David.
Blessed is the man, that wisely weigh
the poore-afflicted can:
Deliverance in the evil day,
the Lord will send that man.
2
Him shall the Lord preserve alive,
and keep on earth to bless:
Him to his foes thou shall not give,
their soul shall not possess.
3
The Lord upholds his feeble head
upon his couch of pain:
Turns in his sickness all his bed,
returns his health again.
4
I said in depth of my distress,
Be gracious, Lord, to me:
O heal my soul, whose sinfulness
has sore offended thee.
5
On me mine enemies exclaim,
and evil of me say:
When shall he die? when shall his nam^
with him be cast away?
6
And if to visit me he come,
his heart vain falsehood speaks:
Iniquity, his errands sum,
at his return forth breaks.
7
All they that hate me, on a knot,
against me whispering swarm:
Against me they this evil plot,
devised to do me harm.
8
"An evil doom on him is past,
"which he deserved before:
And now (say they) that he lies fast,
let him rise up no more.
9
Yea, in my peace the man so great,
to special trust received:
Which of my bread did also eat,
his heel against me heaved.
10
Be gracious, Lord, to me therefore,
and raise me up again;
And I to them shall then restore,
like payment for their pain.
11
By this I know thou favour'st me,
that though my foes assail:
Triumphers yet they shall not be,
against me, nor prevail.
12
But me, in mine integrity
thy hand does still uphold:
And set me, where eternally
thy face I may behold.
13
The Lord, the God of Israel,
be blessed for ever then:
Let age to age eternal tell
his praise: Amen, Amen.
Finis Libri primi.
LIB. II.
PSALM. 42. Quemadmodum desiderat. Ad Praestantem, erudiens, filiis Coreh.
LIke as the braying Hind embost,
desires the water brooks;
So after thee, my soul near lost,
O God, sends longing looks.
2
To God, the living God, for whom
my soul so thirsts sore:
O when shall my appearance come,
the face of God before?
3
My tears to me have been the food,
that day and night I eat:
While daily they in scornful mood,
Where is thy God? repeat.
4
Remembrance of the time fore-spent,
my soul upon me poures;
When to the House of God I went,
at our accustomed hours.
We in the voice of joy and thanks,
together held our way:
A multitude of ordered ranks,
that holy kept the day.
5
Why does my daunted soul give place,
and droop in my distress?
Wait thou on God, healths of my face,
whom ye^ I will confess.
6
My soul (my God) within me sinkes,
and here in deserts still,
On Jordan land, on Chermon thinks,
on little Mitsghar hill.
7
Deep calls on deep, with thundering voice
thy water-Canons sound:
Thy billows all with horrid noise,
thy waves above me bound.
8
His mercy will the Lord by day
command, his song by night,
With me a prayer to God to pray,
my lives eternal light.
9
I unto God my Rock will say,
Why do thou me forget?
Why walk I mourning on my way,
oppressed, and foe-beset?
10
A murdering through my bones does gride,
to my reproach all day:
Where is thy God? in scornful pride,
when my distressors say.
11
Why does my daunted soul give place,
and droop in my distress?
Trust God, my God, healths of my face,
whom yet I will confess.
PSALM. 43. Iudica me, Deus.
JUdge me, O God, my pleading plead,
against a perverse land:
Assert me from the wily head,
and from the wrongers hand.
2
For of my strength the God thou art,
why trun'st thou me to go,
Oppressed in habit as in heart,
to mourn before the foe?
3
Send forth thy light and truth to fill
my dark distrustful breast,
To guide me to thy holy Hill,
thy Tabernacles rest.
4
Then to Gods Altar will I go,
to God, my joys excess:
And thee with Harp and Hymns thereto,
O God, my God, confess.
5
Why does my daunted soul give place,
and droop in my distress?
Trust God, my God, healths of my face,
whom yet I will confess.
PSALM. 44. Deus auribus. Ad Praestantem, filiis Coreh animadversio.
O God, we heard it with our ears,
our fathers have us told,
What deeds thou did in former years,
what in their days of old.
2
The Heathens how thy hand outcast,
our fathers seed to sow:
The people how thou did lay waste,
and made our parents grow.
3
For not by their own swords keen edge,
did they possess the soil;
Nor their own arm can they allege,
did for their safety toil.
But thy right hand, thine arms defense,
thy countenances light;
Thy favor gave them eminence,
in them thou took'st delight.
4
My King, O God, on Jacobs head,
thy saving healths command:
5
To hundge our foes, them down to tread,
thy Name for us shall stand.
6
For neither bow nor sword I have,
whereon my trust to ground:
7
But thou art he from foes did save,
our haters did confound.
8
Of God all day the praise we spread,
and ever sing thy Name. Selah.
9
Of ours no host yet do thou lead,
but shunn'st, and leave us shame.
10
Thou make us turn our backs in fight,
and to our foes give way:
That they that hate us hold but right,
to make our goods their prey.
11
Thou sortest us on terms un-even,
like sheep to serve for meat:
Have scatt'red us among the Heathen,
as chafe of winnow'd wheat.
12
Thy people have thou sold for naught:
Sold! rather have forsook:
For they that sold, of them that bought,
no prices for them took.
13
Thou have exposed us to reproach
of neighbors round about;
Too near upon us that encroach,
at us to scorn and flout.
14
Among the Heath'ns of our estate,
a byword did thou make;
The people that our heads did hate,
their heads at us did shake.
15
And every day before mine eyes
is my confusion set:
Beneath the veil that on me lies,
my face and shame are met.
16
The loud reproachers voice I hear,
the proud blasphemer brook:
To see thy face (my foe) I fear,
and for the Avenger look.
17
All this upon us have we felt,
yet have not thee forgot;
Nor falsely with thy Covenant dealt,
therein we failed thee not.
18
Our heart is backward turned to none,
revolt is not our fault:
Our steps out of thy paths not gone,
nor in thy paths did halt.
19
In dens, where Dragons draw their breath,
though thou have crush't us near;
And covered with the shade of death,
our heads thou heldst so dear;
20
If of our God at any time
the Name we have forgot;
Or of a stranger god, the crime,
our hands up-lifted, blot.
21
Wherever self this sin bestows,
shall God not search it out?
For he the very secrets knows,
in heart un-brought about.
22
For thy sake all day are we killed,
whom else no crime could stain:
On this account our blood is spilled,
like sheep in shambles slain.
23
Awake, why sleep'st thou all this space?
for ever leave us not:
24
Rise, Lord, why hidest thou thy face,
our wants, our woes forgot?
25
Our soul is humbled to the dust,
our belly glew'd to ground:
Rise, help, redeem us, of whose trust
thy mercy is the bound.
PSALM. 45. Eructavit cor meum. Ad Praestantem, super Shoshannim, filiis Cor^h.
Canticum Amorum.
MIne heart is working out
a piece of peerlesse skill:
Mine argument the King, my tongue
a speedy writers quill.
2
Than Adams sons more fair,
grace from thy lips does flow;
His blessings therefore God on thee
for ever did bestow.
3
Gird on thy thigh thy sword,
great Champion as thou art:
4
With glory armed, and high renown,
fair prosper thy desert.
5
Ride on, the word of Truth
and Meekness reign thy Steeds;
With Justice managed, thy right hand
shall teach thee dreadful deeds.
6
Whole Nations under thee,
thine arrows sharp shall bring:
Shall of thy foes subdue the heads,
and pierce the hearts, O King.
7
Thy Throne, O God, out-lasts
the longest ages light:
Thy Kingdoms Scepter, as the hand
that holds the Scepter, right.
8
Just (as thy hate) thy love,
with Justice loves to go:
Thy hate against injustice, just,
holds wickedness thy foe.
Thee therefore God, thy God,
so to himself endeers,
As to anoint thee with the oil
of joy above thy Peers.
9
In robes perfumed with tears
of Myrrh and Aloe clad,
With Cassia from the Ivory roofes,
more than thy Makers glad.
10
Kings daughters in thy Train,
of thee their honor hold:
Upon thy right hand sits the Queen.
attired in Ophir gold.
11
O daughter, hear and see,
hereto incline thine ear:
Thy people, and thy fathers house
forget that thine they were.
12
So covet shall the King
thy beauty, his desire;
He is thy Lord, him serve, observe,
adore with heart entire.
13
Tyres daughter with a gift
shall there beseech thy face:
The wealthy Sydons peopled shores
with presents sue for grace.
14
The daughter of the King
all-glorious is within;
Her robes of gold, her fairer face
her fairest souls fair Inn.
15
So comes she to the King,
in vesture needle-wrought.
With Virgin-Ladies of her train,
to thee shall she be brought.
16
This Royal Troup along
shall joy and gladness bring:
And enter shall they in this pomp
the Palace of the King.
17
Sons in thy fathers stead,
of thee shall he beget:
Sons whom thou may in all the earth,
for sovereign Princes set.
18
Thy Name to age and age
shall my remembrance sing:
The people therefore on thy praise
shall ever dwell, O King.
PSALM. 46. Deus noster, refugium. Ad Praestantem, siliis Choreh, super
Gnalamoth. Canti^um.
ON God our stay and strength we ground,
that refuge else have none:
Abundantly in trouble found,
when other helps are gone.
2
Though earth should change, we would not fear,
although the mountains steep;
Were rent, and hurried here and there,
dis-bowell'd in the deep.
3
Should waves of waters roar and swell,
or should the mountains shake;
When seas against the rocks rebel,
and billows batt'rie make: Selah.
4
There is a river streaming by,
makes glad Gods City walls:
The holy Torrent, O most-Hie,
that from thy Mansion falls.
5
Amidst her God this care has took,
removed she shall not be:
Which, forth before the morning look,
will God her keeper see.
6
The Heath'ns enraged these tumults felt,
moved Kingdoms made a noise:
He thundered, and the earth did melt,
when God gave forth his voice.
7
The Lord of Hosts is on our side,
our hosts to fortify:
The God of Jacob shall abide
for us a refuge hie. Selah.
8
O come but hither, and behold
what works the Lord has wrought:
What desolations late, and old,
his hand on earth has brought.
9
Unto the earths extremest ends,
he makes war expire:
The bow he breaks, the spear he rends,
the chariots burns with fire.
10
That I am God, surcease, and know,
among the Heath'ns will I
Exalted be, by high and low,
and in the earth made hie.
11
The Lord of Hosts is on our side,
our hosts to fortify:
The God of Jacob shall abide
for us a refuge hie.
PSALM. 47. Omnes Gentes plaudite. Ad Praestantem, filiis Choreh, Psalmus.
YE people all, the Quire to fill,
come clap your hands on hie:
With joyful voice to God shout shrill
triumphant melody.
2
For dreadful is the Lord most-High,
through earth a mighty King:
3
That Tribes and Nations far and nigh,
beneath our feet did bring.
4
An heritage for us he chose,
(right) not to be removed:
The excellency to dispose
of Jacob his beloved.
5
In triumph, with applauding noise,
is God himself gone by:
The Lord is with the Trumpets voice
ascended up on hie.
6
Sing, make the praise of God your mirth,
sing praises to our King:
7
For God is King of all the earth,
a Psalm instructive sing.
8
Above the Heath'ns God reigns alone,
co-equall none admits;
Above the Heavens upon his Throne
of Holiness he sits.
9
The Nations Princes feed among
the God of Abraham's flock:
For earths great shields to God belong,
their high-exalted Rock.
PSALM. 48. Magnus Dominus. Canticum Psalmi, filiorum Coreh.
GReat is the Lord, praised all abroad,
but chiefly to be praised;
Where in the City of our God,
his holy Mount is raised.
2
Mount Sion beauteous is in site,
besides the Northern lands:
Of all the earth the glad delight,
the great Kings City stands.
3
God in her Palaces is known
for her a refuge hie:
4
For Kings (behold) oppugnants grow'n,
are gone together by.
5
This wondrous sight struck suddenly
such terror in their mind:
No heart to stay, scarce feet to fly,
could fear confounded find.
6
Upon them fear strong hold did build,
and pain, the rack of fear;
7
As, when a woman big with child,
her burden throws to bear.
8
So (tempest-beaten) at their leake,
the ships salt water drink:
The ships of Tarshish do thou break,
and with an East wind, sink.
9
As we have heard what deeds have been
done in our fathers coasts;
Like have we in the City seen,
thy City, Lord of Hosts.
The City which our God has chose,
and cleared from hostile hand,
Will God establish and dispose
eternally to stand.
10
In silence we (O God) attend,
thy faithfulness to find:
And when thy mercy thou will send,
amidst thy Temple, mind.
11
Thy praise, O God, as far extends,
as does thy Names command:
Thy praise of earth fills all the ends,
and Justice thy right hand.
12
Rejoice, Mount Sion, most of all,
be Judahs daughters glad:
Because thy Judgments made them fall,
that made her faces sad.
13
Go compass stately Sion Mount,
her walls walk round about:
The number of her Towers account,
observe her strength throughout.
14
Set ye your heart upon her fort,
view her high places well;
And to your nephews make report,
that they to theirs may tell;
15
That this is God, our God, whose power
for ever and beyond,
Will be our guide and governor,
and us till death defend.
PSALM. 49. Audite haec. Ad Praestantem, filiis Coreh, Psalmus.
Hear, O ye people all, this lore,
all in the world that dwell;
Earth-borne and noble, rich and poor,
together hearken well.
2
Of my discourse in every part,
my mouth shall wisdoms teach,
The meditation of my heart
to understanding reach.
3
To hear a Parable proposed,
mine ear will I incline:
Dark mysteries, and undisclos'd,
upon my Harp divine.
4
I see no cause why I should dread,
or day of evil doubt:
When on my heels the sins that tread,
shall compass me about.
5
Of them, whose hopes their heaps esteem,
and of their riches boast:
His brother no man may redeem,
nor clear to God that coast.
6
For precious is their soul of price,
and dearer to release,
Than whereunto may ransom rise,
so that must ever cease.
7
That he may yet for ever live,
and not to death submit:
Nor to the earth his ashes give,
nor see corruptions pit.
8
The wise, the fool, the brutish sot,
he sees together die;
And leave the wealth that they have got,
on others wings to fly.
9
And yet they hold their houses sure,
their shields unsoil'd with shames,
Shall so from sire to son endure,
and give their lands their names.
10
But man in honor bearing place,
the night of death arrests:
His brutish life by sin made base.
is silenc't like the beasts.
11
This is the foolish way they love,
unconstant constant end:
Which their posterity approve,
and from their mouth commend. Selah.
12
They in the grave lie pent, like sheep,
where death on them shall feed,
Who, when the morning calls from sleep,
obey the righteous seed.
13
Their image shall the grave bereave,
and waste from where they dwell:
But God shall ransom and receive
my soul from hand of Hell. Selah.
14
Though one thou see of riches seaz'd,
yet be thou not afraid:
With glory of his house increased,
though he thy wants upbraid.
15
For nothing with him when he dies
conveigh from hence he must:
His windy-glory from him flies,
when he descends the dust.
16
For while on earth his days did dwell,
his soul he seemed to bless:
And to thy self when thou do well,
of thee will men confess.
17
His dwelling with his fathers all,
shall be the house of Night:
This brood of darkness never shall
behold eternal Light.
18
Man in this honor bearing place,
of understanding void:
Like brutish in his life, and base,
is like the beasts destroi'd.
PSALM. 50. Deus Deorum. Psalmus Asaph.
THe God of Gods, the Lord has spoke,
and earth to hear did call:
From where the Eastern Sunbeams smoke,
to where the Western fall.
2
From Sion (Beauties perfect prize)
a Beauty more divine,
That Sions beauties beautifies,
did God in brightness shine.
3
Our God shall come, and silence cease,
a fire before him eat:
A vehement tempest shall increase,
and round about him beat.
4
Heaven from above, earth from below,
his dreadful voice will call:
What Judgments weight, that they may know,
shall on his people fall.
5
My Saints to me assemble now,
whose pledges I have took:
My Covenant, that by solemn vow
with sacrifice have struck.
6
His righteousness heavens shall declare,
where his decrees are writ,
Where kept his Courts of Justice are,
where God the Judge does sit.
7
Hear, O my people, what I say,
and I will testify
Against thee (Israel) this day,
God, even thy God am I.
8
For not thy sacrifices want
in thee will I reprove:
Before me thy burnt-offrings scant,
mine anger never move.
9
I take no Bullock from thy stall,
nor Buck-goat from thy fold:
10
Mine are the Beasts that forests all,
or thousand mountains hold.
11
I know all Fowls on every hill,
the fields wild Beasts with me:
12
If hungry, mine the worlds whole fill,
I take and tell not thee.
13
Eat I Bulls flesh, or drink the blood
of rancid Goats will I?
14
Sacrifice praise, thy vows make good,
to God, to God Most-Hie.
15
And in thy trouble call on me,
that day upon me cry;
And thy delivere^ will I be,
whom thou shall glorify.
16
But God to man ungodly says,
My Law why do thou preach?
My Covenant, failing in thy faith,
affirming in thy speech.
17
Where thou to be reformed do hate,
of all thy faults fore-past;
And of my words the weight abate,
and back behind thee cast.
18
Saw thou a Thie^e, it was thy care,
with him to hold consent;
And with Adulterers, for thy share,
thy feet forerunners went.
19
Thy mouth thou turn'st to evil talk,
thy evil thoughts to join:
Thy tongue, the hammer, that does walk,
deceitful slips to coin.
20
Thou sitt'st, and what was never done,
against thy brother speak;
And slandring so thy mothers son,
thine inbred malice wreak'st.
21
I held my peace, when thou had done,
thy wicked thought supposed,
Me like thy self, another one,
as wickedly disposed.
22
But I shall thee reprove eftsoone,
and set before thine e^es,
The evil deeds that thou have done,
the thoughts thou did devise.
23
Forgetful ye, and ^low of sense,
of God unmindfull minds,
Consider, lest I rend you hence,
where guilt no rescue finds.
24
He honors me, that praises paies,
for sacrifices due;
And I to him that rights his ways,
will Gods salvation show.
PSALM. 51. Miserere mei Deus. Ad Praestantem, Psalmus David, cum venit ad eum
Nathan Propheta, postquam ingressus est ad Bathsabagh.
THy mercy great, O God, to me
as graciously express:
As thy compassions many be,
blot out my trespasses.
2
Much deeper my defections lie,
my soulnesse farther in:
Wash thoroughly mine iniquity,
and cleanse me from my sin.
3
For of my crimes I know the cries,
acknowledge every one:
Continually before me lies
the sin that I have done.
4
To thee, thee only, sinned have I,
done evil in thine eyes:
Thy Word of truth to justify,
how clear thy judgment tries.
5
Behold, my shape when I received,
did wickedness begin:
My mother when she me conceived,
conceived in heat of sin.
6
Lo, truth within mine inmost part
does thy delight affect:
And thou the secret of my heart,
by wisdom shall direct.
7
With hyssop purify this deed,
so purged I clean shall grow:
Wash me, my whiteness shall exceed
the whiteness of the snow.
8
Of joy and gladness, make me hear
thy reconciling voice:
The bones by thee that broken were,
shall then afresh rejoice.
9
Hide from my sins thy face, forget
what follies I have done:
All my misdeeds blot out, and let
thy wrath remember none.
10
Clean heart to me, O God, create,
this spirit of mine subdue;
Right spirit in me regenerate,
and re-inspire anew.
11
And cast me not, but of thy face,
where sight I may possess:
Nor from my sinful flesh displace
thy Spirit of Holiness.
12
The joy that thy salvation gives,
restore to me again;
And with thy Spirit, where freedom lives,
my sin-bound soul sustain.
13
Then shall I teach transgressors all,
within thy ways to tread;
And sinners my example shall
to thee converted lead.
14
Deliver me, O God, from blood,
pale deaths polluted spring:
God of my health, my tongue aloud
shall of thy Justice sing.
15
My sin-shut lips, Lord, open thou
with thy kind mercies keys:
So then my mouth will I bestow,
in setting forth thy praise.
16
For sacrifice none thou requir'st,
else would I give it thee:
Burnt-offrings neither thou desir'st,
nor thy delights they be.
17
A wounded spirits heartbreaking smart,
to God burns sacrifice:
A broken and a contrite heart,
thou, God, wilt not despise.
18
On Sion, as thy goodness falls,
with wonted favor filled:
Of thy Jerusalem the walls,
on thy good pleasure build.
19
Then sacrifice of righteousness
to please thee shall ascend:
Burnt-offrings whole thine Altar press,
and frequent Calves contend.
PSALM. 52. Quid gloriaris? Ad Praestantem, M^schil Davidis. Cum veniret Doeg
Idumaeus, and nunciaret Sauli, ac diceret illi, Venit David in domum Achimelec.
WHy do thou, Tyrant, mischief boast,
how much thou can procure?
Gods mercy (do thy worst and most)
does daily yet endure.
2
Thy tongue of evil does entreat,
which forth thy falsehood puts:
As thou with doing of deceit,
so sharp no razor cuts.
3
At evil more than good to reach,
thy earnest love is bent;
And then on Justice is thy speech,
on falsehood rather spent.
4
To speak all words that may devour,
thy lewd desire does long,
To swallow up, where thou have power,
O thou deceitful tongue.
5
For ever thee shall God destroy,
and from thy dwelling place,
From where the living land enjoy,
rend and root out thy race.
6
And this the Just shall also see,
and seeing this shall fear;
And laugh to scorn the Brave, whom he
thus brought to naught shall hear.
7
Behold the strong, that of his state,
not God the strength did seat:
Whose trust was in his riches rate,
in evil only great.
8
I, always like an Olive green,
my growth of days to spend:
Shall in the House of God be seen,
whose mercy I attend.
9
Thy deeds my praises shall proclaim
in public evermore:
And patiently expect thy Name
so good, thy Saints before.
PSALM. 53. Dixit Insipiens. Ad Praestantem, super Mahalath. Psalmus Davidis.
THere is no God, in heart to say,
so far the fool is gone:
Corrupt and odious is their way,
good-doer there is none.
2
Down from the Heavens God looked to see,
what Adams sons desired:
Of understanding who was he,
that after God inquired.
3
Out of the way they are all gone,
gone altogether back:
Good deed, good-doer none, not one,
of all their loathsome pack.
4
Is all their understanding fled,
to wicked works that fall?
That eat my people up like bread,
on God they never call.
5
There did they fear, where was no fear,
to fright those guilty ones:
For God has scattered here and there
the proud besiegers bones.
6
Them to confusion have thou sent,
thine enemies surpised
With shame (of sin the best event)
for God has them despised.
7
Salvations who to Israel
shall out of Sion give?
When they that now in bondage dwell,
no longer captives live.
His people home when God has had,
of whom he made his choice:
Then Jacobs Nation shall be glad,
and Israel rejoice.
PSALM. 54. Deus, in nomine. Ad Praestantem, in Neghinoth, M^schil Davidis, cum
venissent Ziphaei, and dixissent Sauli, Nonne David abscondit se nobiscum?
THy Name in this distress of mine,
O God, to save me send:
To judge me, as revenge is thine,
thy powerful strength extend.
2
Unto my prayer, O God, draw near,
that I to thee commend;
And of my mouth the words to hear,
thine ear attentive bend.
3
For strangers up against me rise,
and tyrants take the way,
Not taking God before their eyes,
to mark my soul their prey. Selah.
4
But God my helper is, behold,
in my defense to stand:
To help them that my soul uphold,
the Lord is near at hand.
5
By evil that my foes contrive,
of their desired success,
His like reward shall them deprive,
them in thy truth suppress.
6
An offering of a free-will'd heart
to thee will I present;
And praise thy Name, O Lord, that art
to goodness wholly bent.
7
For by the helps he did apply,
my troubles all expire:
And on mine enemies, mine eye
has seen my full desire.
PSALM. 55. Exaudi Deus. Ad Praestantem, in Neghinoth, Maschil Davidis.
UNto my prayer, O God, give ear,
that where thou art in place,
My supplication may come there,
and thou not hide thy face.
2
Intend, and answer my complaint,
with straining up my voice:
In these extremes of woe that faint,
and make a troubled noise.
3
The enemies reproaches ring,
the wicked raise debate:
Iniquity on me they bring,
and wroth the hand of hate.
4
My heart within me troubled sore,
is racked to sorrows height:
Than death it self, deaths terrors more
oppress me with their weight.
5
Upon me fear and trembling fell,
and over me at last,
(My sorrows best befitting cell)
a covering, horror cast.
6
O, had I of a Dove (said I)
the wing, to waft my breast,
I then from these assaults would fly,
and find some seat of rest.
7
Hence would I get me far (behold)
and in the Deserts bide,
Where I could seize some safer hold,
my harmless head to hide.
8
Hence would I hasten mine escape,
and (horror left behind)
Exchange my shelter and my shape,
to shun the stormy wind.
9
Their discord-tongues, O Lord, divide,
by swallowing up their life:
For in the City have I spied,
that rapine reigns and strife.
10
Upon the walls thereof they go,
in compass day and night,
And in the midst thereof by woe,
stands mischief armed with might.
11
Within her, who there walks awhile,
but wickedness he meets:
Dissembling mates, deceit and guile,
depart not from her streets.
12
For, not my foe was my disgrace,
his blow I could have borne:
From open hate have hid my face,
had he heaved up his horn.
13
But it was thou, that went aside,
did (faithless) faith pretend:
O man, my other half, my guide,
mine own familiar friend.
14
Our Counsel sweetly did consent,
conceived on either part:
As brethren to Gods House we went,
as in two breasts one heart.
15
Let hasty death upon them throng,
and send them quick to Hell:
For evils are their roofes among,
within them where they dwell.
16
But I will call on God, and soon
the Lord will safety send.
At even will pray, at morn, at noone,
while he my cry intend.
17
He has redeemed my soul in peace,
from battles doubtful fear:
Against me, as they did increase,
so with me many were.
18
Yea, God shall hear, and hold them low,
he that of old abode: Selah.
For changelesse, but to worse they grow,
and why? they fear not God.
19
Against the heads, with him at peace
he has sent forth his hand;
And (faithless) having no release,
profaned his Covenants band.
20
His mouth more smooth than butter, words,
but in his heart made war;
More soft than oil, than spears, darts, swords,
words wounding deeper far.
21
Upon the Lord thy burden cast,
and he shall nourish thee;
And give the Just to stand so fast,
that moved they never be.
22
The wicked, thou, O God, shall fling
into corruptions pit:
Where they untimely perishing,
beyond all time shall sit.
Men stained with bloods, and fraudulent,
ripe age shall never see:
Nor live out half their days well-spent;
but I will trust in thee.
PSALM. 56. Miserere mei Deus. Ad Praestantem, super Columbam mutam Remotorum,
Michtam Davidis, cum deprehenderenteum Pelishtim in Gath.
BE merciful, O God, to me,
whom man would make his prey:
Whose hands from fighting never free,
oppress me all the day.
2
My foes to swallow me outright,
their daily powers apply:
For many hands against me fight,
O thou that art Most-Hie.
3
The day that cloudy doubts appear,
to make my heart afraid;
My hopes yet shining through my fear,
expect thy promised aid.
4
In God by me his Word sincere,
sincerely praised shall be:
In God I trust, and will not fear
what flesh can do to me.
5
To wrest my words is all their care,
their daily counsels end,
Against me, all for evil are
the thoughts that they entend.
6
Together all lay out their line,
as close as hook in bait:
Observing every step of mine,
when for my soul they wait.
7
Shall wickedness such wages have?
so safe shall they escape?
Dig in thy wrath, O God, the grave
that for their fall shall gape.
8
Thou numbrest all my wandering years,
what toiles I undertook:
Told in thy bottle put my tears,
are they not in thy book?
9
That day that I upon thee call,
my foes shall turn their back:
Of God, I know, I never shall
the gracious favor lack.
10
In God the Word will I commend,
the Word praiseworthy most:
Lord, of thy Word, where is no end
of praise, my praise shall boast.
11
On God my hopes their anchor throw,
afraid I will not be,
What earthly man to me can do,
or challenge done by me.
12
Thy vows, O God, upon me are,
which I to thee will pay:
And sacrifice of praise prepare
before thy face to lay.
13
For thou my soul from death did free,
my feet from sliding quite:
To walk, O God, in sight of thee,
with them that live in light.
PSALM. 57. Miserere mei Deus. Ad Praestantem. Ne corrumpas, Michtam Davidis,
cum fugeret a facie S^ulis in speluncam.
BE merciful to me, O God,
be merciful to me:
For as my safeties sole abode
my soul does trust in thee.
And in the shadow of thy wings,
my hopes assurance seat:
Till time an end of evils brings,
and calm this tempests heat.
2
I unto God Most-High will call,
my plaint before him lay:
Whose promise firm performance shall
in full perfection pay.
3
He from the Heavens shall send his hand,
and save me by his power:
Has marked him with reproaches brand,
whose mouth would me devour. Selah.
4
His mercy, and his truth, before
shall God send forth in aid:
For, where fierce Lions ramp and roar,
my soul is subject laid.
5
Among the sons of man I lie,
that fire and fury breathe:
Spears from whose teeth, and arrows fly,
whose tongues sharp swords unsheath.
6
O God, where brightness most abounds,
above the Heavens ascend:
Thy glories beams beyond the bounds
of all the earth extend.
7
A net they for my steps have laid,
and down my soul is bowed:
But in the trench are they betrayed,
which they for me had plowed.
8
My heart, O God, is fixed on thee,
on thee my heart is fixed:
The song that I shall sing, shall be
of thanks and praises mixed.
9
Awake, my glory, slow delay
my Lute and Harp off shake:
Before the Star that ushers day,
I early will awake.
10
To thee, O Lord, my thanks will I
among the people bring;
And where the Nations scatt'red lie,
aloud thy praises sing.
11
The greatness of thy mercies store
above the Heavens does streach:
Thy truth up to the skies does soar,
a higher pitch to reach.
12
O God, where brightness most abounds,
above the Heavens ascend:
Thy glories beams, beyond the bounds
of all the earth extend.
PSALM. 58. Si vere u^ique. Ad Praestantem. Ne corrumpas. Davidis.
ANd call ye this (O men of Might)
pronouncing sentence just?
And call ye this to judge upright,
O eldest sons of dust?
2
Yea, wickedness ye work in heart,
and under fair pretense:
Where through the earth ye hold your Mart,
your hands weigh violence.
3
The wicked, from their mothers womb
estranged, from goodness fly;
And erring, from the belly come,
no sooner speak, but lie.
4
The poisoning Serpent poison bears,
less deadly than their sting:
With like deaf ear the Python hears
the wise Enchanter sing.
5
Their teeth, O God, break in their mouth,
the Lions tuskes out-root:
6
Like waters, Lord, shrink up their growth,
cut off the shafts they shoot.
7
As Snaile consumed within the shell,
all out in slime is run:
Abortive as the birth that sell,
so see they not the Sun.
8
Before your pots perceive the thorn,
or feel the brambles heat,
Let whirling-fury tempest-borne,
their counsels crude defeat.
9
So shall the Just rejoice a good,
to see the vengeance reign;
And wash his feet in reeking blood
of wicked doers slain.
10
So say shall men of mortal kind,
fruit for the just there is:
There is a God, the earth shall find,
and judgment (doubtless) his.
PSALM. 59. Eripe me. Ad Praestantem. Ne corrumpas, D^vidis Michtam, cum
mittente S^ule, observaretur domus, ut interfice^ent eum.
FRom them that are mine enemies,
my God, deliver me:
From them that up against me rise,
my head up-rais'd set free.
2
Assert thou me from their pursuit,
that evil work with pain;
And from their hands, whom bloods pollute,
in safety me sustain.
3
Lo, for my soul in wait they lie,
the strong together draw:
When fault of mine they none could spy,
nor sin, O Lord, they saw.
4
Without iniquity in me,
they run and ready make
To meet me, raise thy self and see;
my helper, Lord, awake.
5
Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts,
thou God of Israel,
To visit all the Heathen coasts,
against thee that rebel.
6
And where for grace to thee alone,
frail sinners find access:
O let thy mercy favor none,
that faithlesly transgress. Selah.
7
They, when the evening Sun shuts in,
run jetting to and fro;
And like a dog they howl and grin,
and round the City go.
8
Vollies lo from their mouth they shoot,
swords in their lips they bear:
Weapons that war with silent foot,
for who (say they) shall hear?
9
But thou, O Lord, shall them deride,
make all the Heath'ns a mock:
That strength to thee will I ascribe,
to thee, O God, my Rock.
10
God of my mercy shall prevent,
and in such plight to me;
Mine enemies shall God present,
as my desire would see.
11
Whom let not slaughters hand devour,
lest that my flock forget:
Disperse them by thy mighty power,
them, Lord our shield, defeat.
12
Their sinful mouth, their lip-wise words,
let their swollen pride descry:
And take them in their selfe-twin'd cords,
that curse, forswear, and lie.
13
Consume, consume them in thy wrath,
that they no more may grow:
What empire God in Jacob has,
through earth that they may know.
14
As soon as day his light draws in,
return they to and fro;
And like the dog, they howl and grin,
and round the City go.
15
Go wandering here and there for meat,
and snart, if un-suffic'd:
They find short fare for them to eat,
by want and hunger sized.
16
But I will sing thy mighty power,
thy mercy early praise:
For thou have been my fortresse-Tower,
my Rock in restless days.
17
I, O my strength, to thee will sing,
to God, my refuge hie:
The God that makes his mercies spring,
my mercies treasury.
PSALM. 60. Deus repulisti. Ad Praestantem, super Sushan-Eduth, Michtam Davidis,
ad docendum, cum contenderet erga Aram Naharaim, and erga Aram-zobah, and
conversus Ioab, et percussit Edom in valle Salis duodecim millia.
THou have, O God, cast us aside,
routed our poor remain:
Thine angry brow have bent to chide,
O turn to us again.
2
The trembling earth thou did invade,
and rifts therein have cleft:
O heal the breaches thou have made,
for it is shaking left.
3
Thou shewdst thy people harder things,
than they had borne before:
Of wine, that stupid horror brings,
to drink, thou gav'st them store.
4
To them that fear thee have thou given
a sign, to shun the bow:
A Banner, by the hand of Heaven
set up, for truth to show.
5
That free deliverance they may have,
that are beloved of thee:
With thy resistlesse right hand save,
O hear and answer me.
6
God in his Holiness has spoke,
which I with joy repeat:
In Shechem will I strike the stroke,
and Succoths valley mete.
7
Mine Galghad is, Manasseh mine,
strength of my head does live:
In quiver-bearing Ephraims line,
my Law shall Judah give.
8
My wash-pot Moab will I make,
my shoe on Edom fling:
Thy pride, Pelesheth overtake,
and to my triumphs bring.
9
The City of such strength within,
what guide shall make me get?
The warlike Edoms towers to win,
what Leader shall I set?
10
When thou, O God, as naught of worth,
have cast us off so long;
And with our Armies wentst not forth,
to make our battles strong.
11
O give us help from our distress,
man's health is vain deceit:
Through God we shall do valiantness,
our foes he shall defeat.
PSALM. 61. Exaudi Deus. Ad Praestantem, super Neghinoth. Davidis.
MY cry, O God, my prayer attend,
when I to thee complain:
2
When from this earths extremest end
my smoth'red heart I strain.
3
Conduct me to the Rock of power,
that higher is than I:
4
For thou have been my hopes strong tower
against the enemy.
5
Thy Tabernacle will I take,
for ever there to dwell;
And to my hopes a shelter make,
thy wings my secret cell. Selah.
6
For thou to hear my vows from heaven,
thine ear, O God, did frame;
An heritage to me have given,
of them that fear thy Name.
7
Days upon days encreast by thee,
thou to the King shall give:
The compass of his years shall be,
from age to age to live.
8
Him God before his face to sit,
for ever shall accept:
With mercy, truth prepare thou fit,
by whom he may be kept.
9
Praise to thy Name so will I sing,
for ever day by day:
To thee my vows upon me bring,
that I may duly pay.
PSALM. 62. Nonne Deo? Ad Praestantem, apud Ieduthun. Psalmus Davidis.
ON God my silent soul attends,
his seasons (surely) heeds:
To him my safeties care commends,
from whom my health proceeds.
2
He surely is my Rock of power,
and my salvation proved:
My hold, my high-defensive tower,
I shall not much be moved.
3
How long on mischief will ye think?
Man-slayers, slaughtred all,
Ye like a ruined sense shall sink,
and like a shaken wall.
4
His dignity how to suppress,
their counsels they convert:
Delight in lies, with mouth they bless,
but curse within their heart. Selah.
5
On God, yet never thou the less,
my silent soul, attend:
From whom my hopeful patientnesse
expects a happy end.
6
He surely is my Rock of power,
and my salvation proved:
My hold, my high-defensive tower,
I shall not be removed.
7
In God is my Salvations port,
my Glories lofty crest,
Rock of my strength, in God my Fort,
my Confidences rest.
8
O people, trust in him always,
your heart before him power:
For of our hopes God is the stay,
our safeties trusty tower.
9
Sure, Adams sons are vanity,
and lighter in account:
The best together weighed, a lie,
and make the balance mount.
10
Trust not in wrong, to reap your part,
in rapine be not vain:
If wealth increase, set not your heart
on baited lures of gain.
11
God spoke at once, which twice I heard,
"To God the power pertaines;
Of punishment, and of reward,
of pardons, and of pains.
12
And mercy, Lord, in thee alone
exceeds, from thee proceeds:
For thou will render every one
according to his deeds.
PSALM. 63. Deus, Deus meus. Psalmus David, cum is esset insolitudine Iehudah.
THou art, O God, my God alone,
mine eyes shall watch to see
The Nights obscurer watchmen gone,
and early seek for thee.
2
For thee my thirsty soul does toil,
for thee my flesh does long:
Within a waste and weary soil,
and waters none among.
3
Within thy Sanctuaries seat,
which now I see no more;
To see thy power and glory great,
as I have seen before.
4
For, good thy mercy is above
the gladsome length of days,
More lovely is than life thy love,
"My lips shall sing thy praise.
5
Thus will I bless thee, while I live,
while breath this breast commands;
And in thy Name, the offering give
of my up-lifted hands.
6
With marrow, and with fatness fed,
my soul shall be full filled;
And from my mouth thy praises spread,
through joyful lips distilled.
7
Of thee my bed remembrance brings,
by night I watch for thee:
8
And shout, when shadowed with thy wings,
thy saving help I see.
9
To thee my Hermit-soule adheres,
here, from thy House expelled;
Where never thy right hand forbeares,
nor leaves me un-upheld.
10
But they, that make my life their prey,
and for my soul contend:
Where lowest earth has made their way,
to death let them descend.
11
A hand on them the sword shall heave,
and shed their guilty blood:
The loathed remainder they shall leave,
shall be the Foxes food.
12
In God, be glad, yet shall the King,
and all that swear Him by,
Shall glory, but be stopped the spring,
the lips that speak a lie.
PSALM. 64. Exaudi Deus. Ad Praestantem. Psalmus David.
UNto my voice, O God, give ear,
to whom my prayer does go:
Preserve my life from pallid fear,
of my pursuing foe.
2
My head from secret counsels hide,
that wicked heads contrive;
From rage against me open wide,
that evil doers drive.
3
With venomed edge and fell intent
which whet their tongues like swords;
And shoot in bows by malice bent,
(sharp arrows) bitter words.
4
A secret shot at him to fit,
that is in heart upright:
With sure and sudden hand they hit,
and fear not where it light.
5
Themselves in mischief make they bold,
and commune how to lay
Their secret snares, to take sure hold,
and, who shall see them? say.
6
Iniquities new shapes have sought,
and masked faces found;
Discovering of their wicked thought,
the heart-corrupted ground.
7
But God, a sudden shaft sharp ground,
and swifter than the wind,
Shall shoot at them, and in the wound,
shall leave the head behind.
8
Yea, their own tongues shall they incite,
upon themselves to fall:
Which all that see, with fearful flight,
shun their example shall.
9
All earthly men shall in their fear,
the work of God declare;
And wisely weigh what these men were,
and whose these doings are.
10
The just and upright, for his part,
shall in the Lord rejoice;
And trust in him: All true of heart,
shall glory in their choice.
PSALM. 65. Te decet Hymnus. Ad Praestantem. Psalmus David Canticum.
ON thee waits Sions silent praise,
O God, that hear'st the prayer:
2
To thee, the vow thy people paies,
to thee all flesh repair.
3
Iniquities, with words at will,
against me have prevailed;
But our transgressions covering still,
thy mercy never failed.
4
O blessed he, whom thou do choose,
so near thy Courts to dwell:
Thy Houses goods where we may use,
thy Temples plenty, tell.
5
Thou God, our health, by fearful signs
shall answer us again:
Just hope of all that earth confines,
or farthest seas contain.
6
Which by his strength lifts up the hills,
above the plains to tower;
And firmness to their height fulfills,
which girded is with power.
7
Which stills the raging of the seas,
be-calmes the billows sounds;
And (more outrageous, to appease)
the peoples tumult bounds.
8
On earth, the utmost dwellers fear
thy signs: The goings out
Of East and West (thy light that bear)
for joy thou make to shout.
9
Thou visitest the soil with showers,
of life-inspiring rain;
Rich Mines of pearl, thy deaw down powers,
the greedy Plowmans gain.
10
Gods River reaches far and wide,
thy care prepares the corn;
And seed, to mother earth do hide,
in teeming-furrow borne.
11
The waters melt her drunken plain,
the verdant blossoms swell;
On whose increase, as drops of rain,
so many blessings dwell.
12
The year, with goodness do thou crown,
beginning where thou end'st;
And every step stills fatness down,
which from the clouds thou send'st.
13
They drop upon the pastures wide,
that robe the wilderness;
The little hills, begirt with pride,
no little joy express.
14
The pastures clothed with flocks un-shorne,
their double fleeces bring:
The valleys covered are with corn,
for joy they shout and sing.
PSALM. 66. Iubilate Deo. Ad Praestantem, Canticum Psalmi.
IN God be joyful all the earth,
his Names renown to raise:
2
Sing Psalms, make loud triumphant mirth,
put glory to his praise.
3
Say unto God, Thy dreadful deeds,
who can enough express?
Whose foes, thy power, that so exceeds,
(faign'd tongues, false hearts) confess.
4
The earth throughout, to worship thee,
their humbled hearts shall frame;
And of thy praise, in Psalms agree,
to sing unto thy Name. Selah.
5
The works of God, O come and see,
what he to pass has brought,
What terrible achievements he
for Adams sons has wrought.
6
The Sea, away on heaps he sent,
the Deep he made dry ground:
Where, through the flood on foot we went,
in him, there joy we found.
7
He rules for ever by his power,
on Nations sets his eyes:
That (never raised, but, to devour)
rebellion, never rise. Selah.
8
And ye, our God, O people bless,
with tongues, and hearts prepared,
Through every land, let more or less,
his praises voice be heard.
9
Which putting deaths black darts aside,
our soul in life does stay:
And suffering not our foot to slide,
upholds us in our way.
10
For thou, O God, did trial make,
what heat we could endure:
If fire could force us thee forsake,
that fines the silver pure.
11
Thou broughtst us where we were betrayed,
and tangled in the net:
Where straitness on our loins was laid,
and pinching pannels set.
12
Thou causedst men, as heads of naught,
above our heads to ride:
Through fire and waters have us brought,
where peace and plenty bide.
13
With offerings burnt my vows to pay,
I to thine house will press,
Performing what my lips did say,
the mouth of my distress.
14
Burnt sacrifices, fatlings throats,
to thee will I return:
Rams incense, Bullockes, and Buck-goats,
upon thine Altar burn. Selah.
15
O come, and hearken every one,
of God that stand in fear;
And for my soul what he has done,
ye from my mouth shall hear.
16
I with my mouth to him complained,
his praise my tongue preferred:
If wicked sight my heart had stained,
the Lord would not have heard.
17
God surely heard my voice complain,
my prayer to him repair:
Blessed God, that turned not back again
his mercy from my prai'r.
PSALM. 67. Deus misereatur. Ad Praestantem, in Neghinoth. Psalmus Cantici.
IN mercy God to us incline,
and bless us with his grace:
Upon our darkness make to shine,
his light out-shining face. Selah.
2
That known may be thy heavenly way,
within this earthly round:
That thy salvations message may
among all Nations sound.
3
Thy praise, O God, let peoples sing,
as far as nights and days,
The Sun transcends his signs to bring;
all people sing thy praise.
4
For joy let all the Nations shout,
for thou with righteous doom,
Shall judge the people earth throughout,
the Nations guide become. Selah.
5
Thy praise, O God, let peoples sing,
as far as nights and days,
The Sun transcends his signs to bring;
all peoples sing thy praise.
6
In field and furrow then the land
shall yield her fruits increase;
And God, our God, with gracious hand,
to bless us shall not cease.
7
His blessing God on us shall send,
all Nations far and near:
The earth throughout, from end to end,
of him shall stand in fear.
PSALM. 68. Exurgat Deus. Ad Praestantem, Davidis, Psalmus Cantici.
LEt God arise, and (disarai'd)
his scattred foes give place:
And let his haters all dismayed,
fly from before his face.
2
Driven, as the smoke before the wind,
as wax, at fire, does melt;
So perish let the wicked kind,
Gods awefull presence felt.
3
But let the Just in him rejoice,
before Gods face express
Their joy of heart, with gladsome voice
shout out their joys excess.
4
Sing, sing to God, his Name on hye,
that rides through Deserts, raise:
Make JAH'S Name way, and joyfully
before his face sing praise.
5
The Father of the fatherless,
Judge of the widows cry
Is God, whose Throne of Holiness,
whose Mansion is on hie.
6
God into households does dispose
the solitary Cell:
The prisoners locked in chains sets loose,
in drought lets Rebels dwell.
7
O God, when through the Desert-sands,
thou went before thy flocks;
And taught'st their clay-worne feet and hands,
to climb Arabian rocks. Selah.
8
Earth shook, Heavens swet, Mount Sinai fell,
and shrunk, to give God place:
When God, the God of Israel,
showed forth his face: His face!
9
Thou shedd'st, O God, a gracious Rain,
and thine Inheritance,
Long languishing in thirsty pain,
thy deawes did re-advance.
10
Therein the Congregation dwelt,
this coast thy creatures shared:
Thus has (O God) thy goodness dealt,
thus for the poor prepared.
11
The Lord gave word, by women spread,
through that great Army they
Sung, "Kings, with Armies fled; they fled,
the Ho^^e-Dove shared the prey.
12
Your beauty, though the pots have spilt,
where (sooty) ye have line:
With silver wings, necks parcell-gilt,
your Dove-like plumes shall shine.
13
When God Almighty gave the blow,
where Kings confounded fell:
Our Sion, shady-Tsalmons snow,
for whiteness did excel.
14
Gods Mountain, as Mount Basan stands,
Mount Basan, fertile, hie:
Whose crest, so many crests commands,
to Sion comes not nie.
15
Insulting Hills, so high, so great,
this Mountain God loves well:
The Lord desires to make his seat,
for ever here to dwell.
16
Myriads of Angels; Mighty Names,
Gods Chariots, Millions fill;
In them the Lord, as Sinai's flames,
on Sions holy Hill.
17
Thou art ascended up on hie,
above the fiery heaven;
Have captive led captivity,
and gifts in man have given.
With them (the more ungrateful they,
that faithless did rebel;
And but compelled, would not obey)
that thou Lord God might dwell.
18
The Lord be blessed, throughout our land,
whose boundless mines of wealth,
With bounty daily load our hand,
the God, our saving health. Selah.
19
God our salvations is become,
our God, that gives us breath,
Eternal is, the Lord, to whom
the issues are of death.
20
Sure, God will smite his haters heads,
and wound the hairie skull
Of him, that life ungodly leads,
and sin on sin does pull.
21
The Lord said, I will bring again,
from Basans slaughtred King;
Thee, from the gulfes amid the Maine,
again, my people, bring.
22
Deep in the blood of Tyrants shed,
thy trampling foot to stain;
And of thy dogs the tongue die red,
where all thy foes lie slain.
23
What triumphs thee, O God, did bring,
they saw it face to face;
Thy goings, O my God, my King,
within thy holy place.
24
Before went singers, afte they
on Instruments that played;
Among them Damsels held their way,
that hand on Timbrell laid.
25
In thine assembly let not thanks
from God the Lord depart:
O Fountain, closed in Isreal's banks,
from fountain of thy heart.
26
There, little Benjamin set hie,
with Judahs Royal race;
Of Zebulun, and Nephthali,
the Princes crowned the place.
27
Strength from his strength forth-issuing,
thy Gods command has brought;
Establish thou, O God, the thing,
that thou for us have wrought.
28
And for Jerusalems dear sake,
and for thy Temple there;
To thee shall Kings their homage make,
and humbly presents bear.
29
Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed,
the Bulls incursions bar:
Whose calves on silver fragments feed,
disperse the friends of war.
30
Sultans shall from Canopus come,
Cush, from Cassumo's Sun,
To God, on glad Embassage home,
with hands out-stretch't shall run.
31
To God, on earth ye Kingdoms nie,
to God like praises bring;
In Psalms sing to the Lord Most-Hie,
your highest praises sing. Selah.
32
To him that on the Heavens does ride,
the Heavens that were of old;
Lo, what he is, his voice has tried,
a voice of strength has told.
33
To God give strength, that does excel,
from whom all strengths arise:
Whose glory over Israel,
whose strength is in the skies.
34
How dreadful is, O God, thy sight,
thy Sanctuaries tell:
Bless God, that gives his people might,
the God of Israel.
PSALM. 69. Salvum me fac. Ad Praestantem super Sosannim, Davidis.
SAve me, O God, the waters rise,
so fast the floods come on,
That even unto my souls surprise,
the swallowing gulf is gone.
2
Down in the mud I sink so low,
to stand I find no ground;
So high the waves above me slow,
so deep the surge to sound.
3
My weary spirit is spent with cries,
my throat with scorching strait:
My sight attentive, fails mine eyes,
while for my God I wait.
4
My head has haters more than hairs,
whom wrong upon me throws;
And power, that in my right impaires,
in mine oppressors grows.
5
I paid them that I never took,
what follies are in me:
What faults, when thou art pleased to look,
are known, O God, to thee.
6
Let not (Lord God of Hosts) my blame,
abash thy servants care:
O God of Israel, in my shame,
let none that seek thee, share.
7
For thy sake have I borne reproach,
in me this blot thou have:
No covering else could shame encroach,
upon my face to cast.
8
My brethren, no such brother know,
no fremme, befriended less:
My mothers children, none such owe,
none more unwelcome guest.
9
Out-eaten with thy Houses zeal,
mine earning heart is rent;
And their reproaches on me steal,
that at thy face were bent.
10
Mine eyes to weep, my soul to fast,
was my reproach and shame;
11
And sackcloth on my shoulders cast,
their jesting-stocke became.
12
Within the gate, did they that sit,
against me set their tongue:
Their tipling-talke, my troubles fit,
I was the Drunkards song.
13
But, Lord, a gracious time assign,
to answer me with ruth:
Thy mercies beams, O God, let shine,
and thy salvations truth.
14
Deliver me out of the mire,
my feet from sinking keep:
Redeem me from my haters ire,
and from these waters deep.
15
Let not the gulfie-mountaines tomb,
her crest above me put:
Let not the pits insatiate womb,
her mouth upon me shut.
16
Lord, answer me, for thou art kind,
and gracious evermore:
O turn thy face, that I may find
thy tender mercy store.
17
And from thy servant cease to hide
thy face in time of need:
In my distresses springing tide,
to answer me make speed.
18
Draw near, my soul, and clear the debt,
for my redemption due:
Deliver me, whom sore beset,
mine enemies pursue.
19
Reproach and shame (thou know) have brought
mine honor in disgrace:
All this have my distressors wrought,
and all before thy face.
20
Rebuke has broken through my heart,
some balm for sorrows wound
I sought; but none to salve my smart,
no comforter I found.
21
For food to eat they gave me gall,
my hungry taste to dine:
For drink, when, thirsty, I did call,
they gave me eagre wine.
22
Let be their table made their snare,
to trap themselves withal;
And well what might have made them fare,
be warp to make them fall.
23
Dark eyes, let darker judgment bleare,
nor sight, nor foresight take;
And make their loins for guilty fear,
continually to shake.
24
Thine indignation on them power,
with dread to strike them cold;
Or let thy hot displeasures shower,
upon their heads take hold.
25
Waste let their ruined Castle lie,
no hand their soil manure:
Nor Lord, nor Tenant hold thereby,
no head their Tents endure.
26
For whom thou smit'st, they persecute;
thou chastenest, they confound:
And how to mischief they dispute,
where thou have made a wound.
27
From wickedness to wickedness,
let their offenses fall;
And to thy Justice have access,
of them let none at all.
28
Out of the Book let them be crossed,
where thine Elected live;
And with the Just no name engrost,
of them no notion give.
29
As poor and pensive as I stand,
thy saving healths supply,
Let find, O God, a powerful hand,
to raise me up on hie.
30
To bless thy Name, O God, will I
a Psalm of praises bring;
And with confession magnify
his mercy, whom I sing.
31
And this shall do the Lord more good,
and better please in proof,
Than tendrest Bullockes reeking blood,
in pride of horn and hoof.
32
To see this sight, with joy of heart,
it shall transport the meek:
Your soul from life shall not depart,
if after God ye seek.
33
For to the poor the Lord gives ear,
his prisoners cares to keep:
34
Heavens, Earth, and Seas, his praises bear,
and all that in them creep.
35
For his Mount Sion God will save,
and Judah's Cities build:
That there their dwellings men may have,
with heirs of promise filled.
36
And of his servants shall the seed
possess the heritage:
And they that love his Name, succeed
therein, from age to age.
PSALM. 70. Deus in adjutorium. Ad Praestantem, Psalm. Davidis, ad recordandum.
NOw, now, in my extremes of need,
O lose no time in waste;
Deliver me, O God, with speed,
to help me, Lord, make haste.
2
Shame and confusion on them lie,
that seek my souls annoy:
Turned back, and blushing let them fly,
that in my evil joy.
3
Let this reward their wages pay,
to send them back with shame:
Aha, in scorn to me that say,
and make my grief their game.
4
Let them that seek thee, all always,
in thee with joy abide:
Let thy Salvations lovers say
still, God be magnified.
5
To me, poor soul, so low down cast,
O God, make speed away:
My help, and my deliverer haste,
O Lord, make no delay.
PSALM. 71. In te Domine.
FOr ever, me, that in thee trust,
Lord, let not shame deprave:
2
My plaintiffe-soule, as thou art just,
deliver, hear, and save.
3
Be thou, where I may enter, still
my Rock of residence;
To save me, is thy Precepts will,
the Fort of my defense.
4
The raging hand, my God, becalme,
assert my liberty,
Safe, from the evill-doers palm,
sow'r-leav'nd in cruelty.
5
For thou, Lord God, art of my rest
the long-expected scope;
Thou art my weaner from the breast,
mine infant-ages hope.
6
My navill, since the womb forsook,
thy hand did me uphold:
Me, from my mothers bowels took,
of thee, my praise still told.
7
As from a Monster, many eyes,
from me astonished start:
When strong distress yet on me lies,
my stronger hope thou art.
8
My mouth, no other music fill,
no story style my song;
To descant of thy praise, my skill,
thy glory, all day long.
9
O, cast me not in age away,
when weakness strong assailes:
Now leave me not to my decay,
when strength enfeebled fails.
10
For they that bare me causeless hate,
(my foes) against me spoke;
And they that for my soul lay wait,
together counsel take.
11
Since God (say they) does him forsake,
now left he is alone:
On, on, him persecute, him take,
to rescue him is none.
12
But go not far, O God, from me,
nor fit occasion waste;
At present need as present be,
my God, to help me haste.
13
Confusion let confound them all,
that to my soul are foes:
Reproach, dishonor on them fall,
that seek my evil woes.
14
Yet shall my hope wait patiently
upon thy help in store;
And to thy praise, continually
add praises more and more.
15
Thy Justice shall my mouth express,
thy saving health all day:
Whose numbers sum so numberless,
my ciphers cannot say.
16
To sing thy power, this power of mine,
how be it (Lord God) too weak;
Yet of thy Justice, only thine,
somewhat, suffice, I speak.
17
My heart, O God, have thou prepared,
and from my childhood taught:
And hitherto have I declared,
what wonders thou have wrought.
18
And now, that I (O God) am old,
mine Almond-tree grown gray:
Mine age, from thee, let none behold,
forsaken, sent away.
19
Till I have showed thine Arms extent
unto this Ages view;
And of thy power, a president,
to all that shall ensue.
20
Thy Justice is in thee alone,
O God, unto on hie:
To those great acts which thou have done,
who like (O God) comes nie?
21
Thou shew'dst me many evil days,
much sorrow made me see;
From under ground yet did thou raise,
return, and quicken me.
22
To make me greater, far and wide
thou gav'st me great increase;
To better me on every side,
thy goodness did not cease.
23
Thee, and thy Truth, my God, to praise,
not Psalterie alone;
But Song and Harp will I up-raise,
O Isreal's Holy-One.
24
With joy, above all joys esteemed,
my lips shall shout to thee;
So shall my soul, by thee redeemed,
in Psalms as joyful be.
25
My tongue, the Trumpet, shall proclaim
thy Justice all the day:
For they are blank't, and brought to shame,
that seek my souls decay.
PSALM. 72. Deus, Iudicium. Solomoni.
O God, give Judgment to the King,
thy Judgments depths to sound;
And to the Kings son, Knowledge bring,
where Justice may be found.
2
So, he that gives the life to Laws,
an upright hand shall bear:
With Justice judge the peoples cause,
the poor, with Judgment, hear.
3
The Mountains, that in height excel,
shall bring the people peace;
The lesser Hills, that lower dwell,
by Justice shall increase.
4
Him, for their Judge the poor shall have,
to crush the fraudulent:
The sons of needy-soules to save,
suppress the violent.
5
And they with fear shall thee adore,
when days and nights are none;
When Sun and Moon shall shine no more,
when Ages all are gone.
6
He shall come down, like soaking showers,
in fleece-shorne meadow mowne;
Embroid'ring earth with fruits and flowers,
on Summers mantle grown.
7
The Just shall flourish in his days,
and multitude of peace;
Until the Moons extinguished rays,
shall change, to change, and cease.
8
The utmost shore, from sea to sea,
shall be his Empires bound;
And from Euphrates watrie-lea,
as far as earth has ground.
9
The Ethiopian Sunburned Crust,
shall (bowed before him) kneel:
His enemies shall lick the dust,
that scatt'reth from his heel.
10
With presents, and with precious things,
from Tharshish, and the Isles;
From Sheba, and from Seba, Kings,
shall measure worlds of miles.
11
All Kings (before whom subjects kneel)
kneel down, and serve him shall:
All Nations, his dread Scepter feel,
and down before him fall.
12
For he that hears him, shall redeem
the needy, when he cries:
The poor un-heeded soul esteem,
and him that helpless lies.
13
The simple he (with want, that strive)
shall mercifully spare:
Preserve the needy-soules alive,
and for their safety care.
14
Their soul from rapine he shall free,
whom fraud or force betray:
And precious in his eyes shall be
the blood that they shall pay.
15
And he shall live, and Sheba's gold,
to him shall men commend;
And prayers for him continual hold,
to praise him all day spend.
16
A shocke of corn the Hills shall make,
the City shall abound;
Whose fruit, like Lebanon shall shake,
and spring, as grass on ground.
17
His Name (the SON) when Sun shall rest,
shine fresh for ever shall:
Yea, in his Name (and call him blessed)
be blessed shall Nations all.
11
To God the Lord, the God in whom
the sons of Israel live:
From whom alone all wonders come,
to him all blessings give.
19
Be ever blessed his glorious Name,
and by the sons of men,
Let with his glory, earths whole frame
be filled, Amen, Amen.
20
For Solomon his son to sing,
this Psalm his father penned;
So David's prayers here did the King,
the son of Jishai, end.
Finis Libri secundi.
LIB. III.
PSALM. 73. Quam bonus Deus. Psalmus Asaphi.
YEt God to Israel is good,
affects the pure in heart!
2
And I; my feet, but faltring stood,
my steps were like to start.
3
I envied follies proud commands,
the wickeds peace I saw:
4
For in their death there are no bands,
but Lording-strength their Law.
5
Tell them of troubles, where, or when,
for care they keep no room;
Nor are they plagued, like other men,
near them no cross may come.
6
Of pride therefore a chain hung down,
about their necks they bear:
And violences guarded gown,
the garment is they wear.
7
Their fat-swolne eyes bear out so bold,
in plenty share such part:
Their heaps no house enough to hold,
their happiness no heart.
8
Corrupt, in their licentious vain,
with their malicious tongue:
Oppression proudly they maintain,
and highly boast of wrong.
9
Their mouth against the heavens they vent,
to brave, blaspheme, and fling,
Throughout the earth, till they have spent
their tongues envenomed sting.
10
His people therefore hither turn,
and seeking like success,
Of waters wrung from their full urne,
suck up the bitterness.
11
Tush, how should God, that comes not nie,
(say they) such trifles know:
Or how shall he, that is Most-Hie,
esteem of things so low?
12
Lo, these the worlds ungodly guests,
and there, these prosper best:
Lo, these are they, that wealth possess;
Nay, are by wealth possessed.
13
Now surely I, on poor pretense,
have cleans'd my heart in vain;
And washed my hands in innocence,
with labor for my pain.
14
And dieted I am all day
with plagues, for my repast;
And in the mornings, is my pay,
rebuke, to break my fast.
15
Thus, if I say, when I have said,
How (faithless) I offend;
And of thy sons, the race up-brai'd,
and rashly read their end?
16
Then thought I how to clear this doubt,
to sound this depth again;
But found it hard to find it out,
and in mine eyes a pain.
17
Till to Gods holy House I went,
and wisely did attend:
Of these men, there, and their extent,
I understood the end.
18
Them, surely, have thou set aloft,
on high, but slippery seats:
Whence, when they fall, they fall not often,
but soon thy hand defeats.
19
How suddenly left desolate,
to ruin are they brought;
How soon consumed is their estate,
with terrors over-wrought?
20
As, on the wing of fancy flies,
a dream from one awake;
So, Lord, when up thou shall arise,
despised their image make.
21
My sowre-leav'nd heart did surely pant,
my reins corrected me:
22
So brutish I, so ignorant,
was, as the beasts, with thee.
23
With thee, yet still did I abide,
to thee, my right hand, cleave:
Me, with thy counsel shall thou guide,
to glory then receive.
24
In Heaven, what one have I, but thee,
to whom my hopes suspire:
25
In earth, delights are none for me,
but thou, my life's desire.
26
My flesh and heart, consumed at length,
as now, assist me not:
But of my heart, the Rock of strength,
for ever, God my lot.
27
For lo, by thee be overthrown,
and perish shall each one,
That are to Idols of their own,
from thee awhoring gone.
28
As for my good, I hold it best,
near God to draw my care:
On God the Lord, my hopes to rest,
and all thy works declare.
PSALM. 74. Ut quid Deus? Admonitio Asaphi.
FOrever! what does thee provoke,
from us cast off to keep?
Still shall, O God, thy nostrils smoke,
against thy pasture-sheep?
2
Thy Congregation call to mind,
thy now forsaken fold,
Whom thou, from bondage did unbind,
and purchased have of old.
3
Thine Heritages rod redeemed,
among our fathers dealt:
This Sion-Mount, so much esteemed,
the seat, where thou have dwelt.
4
Lift up thy feet: Thy foe defeat
for ever, every one:
That to thy Sanctuaries seat
have all this evil done.
5
Amidst thy holy places met,
thine adversaries roar:
Their Ensigns up for signs they set
of conquest got before.
6
He that high groves of Cedars grown,
with axe up-lifted felled,
By much less loud report was known,
like ours, no spoiler held.
7
And now they rend, and raze as fast,
the roofes, the beams, lie broke,
The carved columns down are cast,
with maule and hammers stroke.
8
Thy Sanctuaries, set on fire,
laid level with the ground:
The place profaned, where thy desire
to plant thy Name was found.
9
Let us (in heart, said they) make spoil,
together them destroy:
Unburnt, let God, in all the soil,
no Synagogue enjoy.
10
Our signs, we see not! Prophet none,
our Seers all among:
Before our evil day be done,
none left, that knows how long.
11
How long, O God, of this our shame,
shall our distressor dream?
How long, for ever, shall thy Name
the Enemy blaspheme?
12
Why, turn thy hand? why, thy right hand
held in thy bosom void?
Why, this (while thou, withdrawn do stand)
Destroier undestroi'd?
13
For why? God is my King of old,
by whom, Salvations wrought,
Do we, amidst the earth behold,
as from their fountain brought.
14
Through standing seas divided walls,
thy power, thy peoples leads;
And with thy batt'ring water-falls,
thou break'st the Dragons heads.
15
Leviathans great heads (more great)
thy surges swept away:
Thou gav'st him to be peoples meat,
the Desert-dwellers prey.
16
Thou made out of the stony rock
whole floods and fountains fly;
And through their laps, to lead thy flocks,
drew'st mighty rivers dry.
17
Thine is the day, the night is thine,
thou have prepared the light:
By day, the golden Sun to shine,
the silver Moon by night.
18
(The seas, shut up within their shores)
thou quarter'st out the coasts:
The Summers, and the Winters flowers,
thou lay'st with fires and frosts.
19
Remember, Lord, how this reproach,
the Enemy did frame:
How foolish people did encroach,
that durst blaspheme thy Name.
20
Thy Turtles soul commit thou not
to be the wild beasts prey;
Nor thine afflicted flock, forgot,
for ever cast away.
21
Unto thy Covenant have respect,
for all the earth is dark;
And here, her roofes has rapine decked,
oppression set her mark.
22
O, let not thine oppressed depart,
repuls't with brand of shame:
But let the poor afflicted heart,
and n^edy, praise thy Name.
23
Arise, O God, thy plea proceed,
to plead without delay,
Remember how the foole-mad breed,
reproach thee all the day.
24
Forget not, of thine enemies*
the voice that thee offends:
Their tumult, that against thee ^ise,
continually ascends.
PLAL. 75. Confitebimur tibi. Ad Praestantem. Ne corrumpas. Psalmus Asaphi,
Canticum.
TO thee, O God, our thanks confess,
thy praise we celebrate;
And near to us thy Names access,
thy wondrous works relate.
2
When time shall bring about the day,
that I the Rule receive:
With Justice will I guide the way,
and righteous Judgment give.
3
The earth, and earths in-dwellers all,
dissolved, and down are cast:
Her shaken fabric, from to fall,
her pillars I set fast. Selah.
4
To mad-proud fools I said, Beware,
let folly be forborne;
And to the wicked, Have a care,
ye lift not up the Horn.
5
Fools, heave not up your Horn on hie,
lest Heaven your Antliers check:
Your words on lowly wing let fly,
not with a stiffe-borne neck.
6
For, neither from the East nor West,
nor Hills, high-callings come:
But God the Judge, "Some humbles best,
"Exalts other some.
7
For, in his hand the Lord does bear
a cup, whose wine is red;
And full of mixture is the Mere
by him distributed.
Of indignation in this cup,
on earth, the wicked all,
Wring-out the dregs, and drink them up,
deprived of mercy shall.
8
But I, for ever will declare,
and Hymns of gladness bring:
Which I, for praises shall prepare,
to Jacobs God to sing.
9
And of the wicked, every horn,
I from their heads will rend:
When high shall every beam be borne,
that forth the Just shall send.
PSALM. 76. Notus in Judea. Ad Praestantem, in Neghinoth. Psalmus Asaphi,
Canticum.
IN Judah God is known, his Name
is great in Israel:
2
His Tent in Salem: He the same,
that does in Sion dwell.
3
The burning arrows, there he brake,
shot from the bow-mans hand:
The sword and shield, made field forsake,
and warlike bands dis-band. Selah.
4
Much brighter shines thy Glories Crown,
than brightness shines by day:
Thine Excellence of more renown,
than are the Mounts of prey.
5
There, mighty-hearted men lay foil'^,
and falling, slept their sleep:
The men of power, of power, found spoiled,
which none found hands to keep.
6
O God of Jacob, thy reproof,
sent many a daring head:
Chariot and Horse, with thundering hoof,
to sleep among the dead.
7
Thou, thou art to be feared alone,
for thy resistlesse might:
And in thy wrath, from then, what one
shall stand before thy sight?
8
From Heaven, to have thy Judgment heard,
it was thy dreadful will;
And at thy thundering voice afeard,
earth trembled, and was still.
9
When God in Judgment rose, to save
the meek on earth, un-slaine: Selah.
Praise of man's rage, th^^ sure shall have,
the rest thou shall, ^^straine.
10
Vow to the Lord your God, and pay,
all round about him near;
Your present in the presence lay,
of Jacobs Fathers Fear.
The spirit of Princes rank-growne pride,
his gathering spirit shall prune:
That is, on earth an awful guide,
to keep their Kings in tune.
PSALM. 77. Voce mea ad Dominum. Ad Praestantem, super Ieduthun, Asaphi Psalmus.
I With my voice to God did cry,
so loud, that he might hear:
My voice to God I raised on hie,
and he to me gave ear.
2
While day to my distress gave light*
unto the Lord I mourned:
My restless sore ran out by night,
my soul from comfort turned.
3
I thought on God: My troubled thought
betook me no relief:
My spirit complained, but over-wrought
was my complaint with grief. Selah.
4
Thou heldst my heavy eyes awake,
while I, with watching, weak,
Would rest; but rest I could not take,
astonished, could not speak.
5
I thought upon the days of old,
their complete sum to cast;
And of our fathers ages told,
what years in number past.
6
I called to mind my song by night,
I commun'd with my heart;
And thoroughly out to search my spirit,
bare every part a part.
7
For ever, will the Lord, displeased,
cast off, and not restore:
And will his anger, unappeas'd,
add no acceptance more?
8
For ever, is his Mercy done,
his Word, to ceasing put;
9
His Grace, has God forgot so soon,
in wrath his Bowels shut? Selah.
10
Or, is my sickness this, (said I)
that I so late began:
Of his right hand, that is Most-Hie,
the changing turns to skan?
11
To my remembrance will I call,
what works the Lord has wrought,
What wonders did of late befall,
will ponder in my thought.
12
Of all thy works will I advise,
and as I meditate,
Make my discourses exercise,
thy doings to relate.
13
Most Holy is (O God) thy way,
thy Sanctuaries seat;
Thy Second, whom can any say,
as God, as God so great?
14
Thou art the God; that Strength, thou art,
that strange designs have shown;
And of thy power, have made thy part,
among the people known.
15
Thy peoples generations,
thine arm redeemed of old:
Thy Jacobs, and thy Joseph's sons,
whom Joseph's brethren sold.
16
Thy face, O God, the waters saw,
the waters saw thy face;
The trembling waters stood in awe,
the groaning deeps gave place.
17
The clouds on earth, their tempests powered,
the skies gave out a sound:
Thine arrows from the quiver showered,
made seas on seas rebound.
18
Thy thunder-shot roared round about,
the world with lightnings shone;
The earth was stirred, and shook, in doubt,
her daylight lamp was gone.
Yea, even this dreadful glimmering light,
glad comfort gave their eye;
That in this darknesse-double-night,
yet let them see to die.
19
Thy way, is in the sea aside,
on heaps divided thrown:
Thy paths through many waters guide,
thy footsteps are not known.
20
Thou leadst thy people through the Land,
as Shepherd leads his sheep:
By Moses, and by Aarons hand,
thy flock ordained to keep.
PSALM. 78. Attendite, Popule. Admonitio Asaphi.
MY Law, that I shall give in charge,
O ye my people, hear:
To what my lips shall speak at large,
incline your heedfull ear.
2
A Parable my mouth shall show,
dark mysteries of old,
3
What we have heard, and known, renew,
as have our fathers told.
4
Which of the Ages sons un-borne,
we will conceal from none,
What Crowns of praise the Lord has worn,
what powerful wonders done?
5
A Covenant he with Jacob struck,
gave Israel a Law:
Wherein, strait charge our fathers took,
to hold their sons in awe.
6
That their Posterity might know,
and learn by them alive:
From seed to seed rise up and sow,
from son to son derive.
7
On God, their hopes that they might set,
Gods acts charactred deep
Within their breast, might not forget,
and his Commandments keep.
8
Not, as their fathers disobeyed,
a race that did rebel:
A race, from God, whose heart un-stai'd,
whose spirit unfaithful, fell.
9
Such as the sons of Ephraim were,
that armed, and bearing bow,
Flung down their arms, and fled for fear
before the signall-blow.
10
Of God, the Covenant kept they not,
his Precepts paths eschew'd:
11
What deeds he did for them, forgot
what wondrous works he showed.
12
What wonders in their fathers sight,
sad proof can Egypt yield,
Whereto, though Misraim all, had right,
most right had Zoan field.
13
The sea for them did he divide,
and made them passage all:
He heap't the waters side by side,
to stand, as wall by wall.
14
A cloud all day, their course to keep,
all night, a light of fire:
15
From Desert-rockes, as from the Deep,
gave drink at their desire.
16
Swift streams out of the Rock he brought,
that forth like rivers fly:
17
Their sin, on sin, in Desert wrought,
provoked, yet, God Most-Hie.
18
And, tempting God, with grudging hearts,
their soul requiring meat:
19
Shall God (said they) in Desert parts,
on tables set to eat?
20
Behold, he smote the stony Rock,
whence flowed those streams afresh:
But can he for his peopled flock
find bread, or furnish flesh?
21
This heard the Lord; but heard with wrath,
the fire that Jacob blew:
For this ungrateful breach of troth,
on faithless Israel slew.
22
For they to God no faith had given,
nor his salvation trust:
23
Though clouds enjoined, and doors of Heaven,
lay open to their lust.
24
He, Manna down on them did rain,
their hunger to suffice;
And gave them of that Heavenly grain,
from Garners of the skies.
25
That man, the Mighties Bread might eat,
it was his Makers will:
Who sent them this Celestial meat,
of Angels food, their fill.
26
He, from Heavens Nabathean mouth,
his East wind made to blow:
His power brought from Sabean South,
a softer gale to glow.
27
He rained down flesh, the Desert dust,
to number, is not more;
And feathred-fowle, to fill their lust,
as sand, on sea-driv'n shore.
28
He made it fall, his Camp throughout,
so big the cloud did swell;
His habitations round about,
the feathred-tempest fell.
29
So they did eat, and had their fill,
their lust, so highly prized,
Had what they would, yet, not their will;
were cloi'd, but not sufficed.
30
While yet the meat was in their mouth,
Gods wrath upon them came;
And slew the fat of all their youth,
the hopes of Isreal's name.
31
This done, yet sinned they more and more,
the more their God to grieve:
His wonders slighting, as before,
nor would they yet believe.
32
He therefore did consume their days
in vanity, their years,
Not close, with Ages kind decaies,
but cross, with hasty fears.
33
On them, when slaughters hand he brought,
then home to him retired:
Then sought him, early then him sought,
then after God inquired.
34
That God was then their Rock of strength,
they could remember well;
And that the Highest God, at length,
was their Redeemer, tell.
35
Yet did their mouth but faigne the while,
this was but flat^'ries gloze,
Their tongue framed this alluring style,
these lies with him to close.
36
Their heart with him was wrong within,
his Covenants faith forgot:
His mercy covered yet their sin,
and them corrupted not.
37
How often his compassions wing,
could wind his wrath aside;
And on their heads forbear to bring
his whole displeasures tide.
38
Remembering that they were but flesh,
a vapor, whift away:
Whose flower may never spring, refresh,
but once, and soon decay.
39
How often did they him provoke,
the Wilderness can speak:
How often his displeasures stroke,
the Deserts saw him break.
40
Yet turning back, to sin they fell,
and tempting God again:
The Holy-One of Israel,
their limits would contain.
41
Nor minded they his Mighty hand,
nor their Redemption-day:
When he them freed from Pharaoh's Land,
from bondage sent away.
42
What strange designs in Egypt done,
what wonders Zoan-plaines:
All Ages wonder, equal none,
and Memphis yet complains.
43
He turned their rivers into blood,
that thirst it self did shrink,
In plenty, poor; of Nilus flood
when Egypt could not drink.
44
Devouring flies, promiscuous swarms,
to eat them up, he sent;
And fenny frogs importune charms,
corrupting, where they went.
45
He let the Caterpiller eat
the fruit of all their soil;
And gave their labors hopeful sweat,
to be the Locusts spoil.
46
Their Vines, with haile-stones he destroi'd,
their Sycamores with frost:
47
With hail, their herds, their flocks annoi'd,
in flames of lightning lost.
48
His indignations fi'rie stripes,
his fury on them spent;
And guilty-soules tormenting gripes,
by evil Angels sent.
49
He spared not their soul from death,
to weigh his angers way,
Made man and beast give up their breath,
the Pestilences prey.
50
The first of all in Egypt borne,
unequal death prevents;
The Principal of strength, the Horn,
where Cham had pitched his Tents.
51
But sorth, like sheep, from tempest fled,
he made his people pass;
And, like a flock in Deserts led,
as in deep pasture grass.
52
He led them safe, and free from fear,
their walks were through the waves;
But drowned their foes, that here and there
had made the sea their graves.
53
And them, he to his Rock of rest,
his holy Border, brought,
This Mountain loved above the best,
and with his right hand bought.
54
Before them, out the Heath'ns he cast,
and shared their lot by line;
Where Anak reigned in Ages past,
the shields of Jacob shine.
55
Ungrateful they, their God Most-Hie,
yet tempt, afresh provoke:
His Testimonies naught set by,
with them can bear no stroke.
56
They turn their backs, disloyal grow,
and fly their fathers flight:
"So starts aside the warping bow,
the Archer aiming right.
57
And now, to grate his angry gall,
Hill-Altars, Idoll-Groves,
Grav'n-Imagery, whereto they fall,
his jealous fury moves.
58
This, hearing God, his wrath grew hot,
so foul revolt to hear;
So Israel his hatred got,
his people held so dear.
59
His Tabernacle he forsook,
that Shilo loved so well;
His Tabernacle, where he took
delight with men, to dwell.
60
His Arc, his Monument of Power,
he left in captive bands;
And gave his Glories beauteous flower
into Distressors hands.
61
He chained his people to the chance
of Tyrants raging blade;
And wroth with his Inheritance,
their heads the hostage made.
62
Their young men were untimely driven,
of fire to be the food:
Their virgins not in marriage given,
nor by their praisers wooed.
63
Their Priests anointed, slain with glaves,
and laid on bloody Beers:
No widows, on their wedlockes graves,
to melt some mourning tears.
64
So wak't the Lord, as after sleep,
the rowzed spirits refine:
Or, as a Giant, sowsed deep
in lavish cups of wine.
65
With Hemorroids, on their parts behind,
his enemies he smote;
And branded them, and all their kind,
with shames eternal note.
66
For Joseph's Tent he did refuse,
or Ephraims Tribe to move:
67
But Judah's Royal Tribe did choose,
and Sion-Mount his love.
68
There, built his Temples Horns on hie,
his Holy-place so sure,
That founded to Eternity,
might firm, as earth, endure.
69
His servant David (hook and sling)
he drew from folds of sheep;
And of a Shepherd, made a King,
a flock of souls to keep.
70
From following Ewes, with young ones great,
of Jacobs chosen seed:
Possessed him of a Regall-seat,
his Israel to feed.
And them within this Holy Land,
with perfect heart he fed:
Them, with a prudent Pastors hand,
(his flock) discreetly led.
PSALM. 79. Deus, venerunt. Psalmus Asaphi.
THine Heritage, O God, expil'd,
invading Heath'ns laid waste:
Thine Holy place have they defiled,
on heaps have Salem cast.
2
The caskasse of thy servants, meat
given to the foul of Heaven;
And of thy Saints, the flesh to eat,
to earths wild beast is given.
3
Their blood, about thy Salem, round,
like waters have they shed,
Profanely left above the ground,
their bones un-buried.
4
Our neighbors near, on every side,
reproach us face to face;
And round about us scorn, deride,
and load us with disgrace.
5
How long? for ever, Lord, how long,
before thine anger turn?
O, shall thy jealousy so strong,
like fire for ever burn?
6
Upon the Heath'n power out thy wrath,
and make their Kingdoms flame,
Whose heart of thee no knowledge has,
that call not on thy Name.
7
For, they have eat up Jacobs race,
his seed, by sword devoured;
And on his wasted dwelling place,
their fire and fury powered.
8
Call not our former sins to mind,
with speed some mercy show;
Prevent us with thy bowels kind,
whose loss has brought us low.
9
Help us, God of our health, and make
thy Name the glory share:
Deliver us, for thy Names sake,
our sins in mercy spare.
10
For why live we, to see this day,
to bear this byword home;
To hear the Heath'n-blasphemer say,
Where is their God become?
To Heath'ns let this be understood,
before our eyes be read;
How dear thy vengeance sells the blood
of us thy servants shed.
11
Let prisoners sighs, yet re^king warm,
before thee bring their breath:
According to thy powerful arm,
reserve the sons of death.
12
And their reproach, which to our pain,
our neighbors on thee lay;
Into their bosom, Lord, again,
with sevenfold pain repay.
13
So we, thy peoples pasture sheep,
shall ever of thy praise,
With thankful Hymns, Memorials keep,
to Age, and Age of days.
PSALM. 80. Quiregis Israel. Ad Praestantem, super Sosannim G^eduth. Asaphi
Psalmus.
Shepherd of Israel, give ear,
That Joseph, like a sheep, do lead,
That sitt'st upon the winged-chaire,
The Cherubims, clear up thy head.
2
Before Ephraim, and Benjamin,
Before Manasseh, to us come;
Stir up thy mighty strength herein,
And for salvation bring us home.
3
To show, that saving health is thine,
Turn us, O turn to us again:
Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
Salvation so shall we attain.
4
Lord God of Hosts, how long will thou,
In these extremes of our affairs,
Hot-smoaking bend thine angry brow,
Against thy peoples humble prayers?
5
Thou make them eat the bread of tears,
Of tears, to drink in measure great,
6
Our neighbors strife to fill our ears,
With scorn, our foes us soul entreat.
7
To show, that saving health is thine,
O God of Hosts, turn us again,
Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
Salvation so shall we attain.
8
A Vine from Egypt have thou brought,
The Heath'ns dis-planted by thy hand,
9
Before thy plant the way have wrought*
Which, taking root, has filled the Land.
10
The Hills were covered with the shade,
That from her fan of leaves did fall;
For cold, for heat, kind shelter made,
Her stature, like Gods Cedars, tall.
11
Her branches bound the sea, a Crown,
Her boughs be-deck't Euphrates shore*
12
Her hedge, why have thou broken down,
That passers-by, her clusters tore?
13
To root it up, the woods wild Boar,
To rend it down, the fields wild Beasts,
All glutted with her purple gore,
Were this fair Vines unfitting guests.
14
Return, O God of Hosts, and now,
With eyes, than light, that brighter shine,
Look down from Heaven upon this bough,
Behold, and visit thou this Vine.
15
This Vine, the strength of thy right hand,
Stock, burnt with fire, the boughs cut down;
16
Son, for thy self made strong to stand,
They perish at thy faces frown.
15
Upon the Man of thy right hand,
O let thy hand continue long;
Upon the Son of man let stand,
Whom for thy self thou made so strong.
18
So no revolt of ours shall give,
Our backs to thee, to brand with shame,
O, quicken us, and we shall live;
And living, call upon thy Name.
19
To show, that saving health is thine,
Lord God of Hosts, turn us again;
And cause on us thy face to shine,
Salvation so shall we attain.
PSALM. 81. Exultate Deo. Ad Praestantem, super Gitti^h, Asaphi.
TO God, our strength, with joyful voice,
in triumph let us sing:
To Jacobs God, with echoing noise,
make we the air to ring.
2
Take up the Psalms sweet melody,
the sounding Timbrell bring:
The pleasant Harp, the Psalterie,
strain voice, and wind, and string.
3
Blow up the Trumpet, when the Moon,
her silver horns renewes:
At solemn feast, as to have done,
on our high day we use.
4
For this a statute was ordained,
to Israel foretold:
A Rite to Jacobs God retained,
for Jacobs sons to hold.
5
In Joseph was this witness cleared,
when he from Pharaoh's land
Went forth, a language there I heard,
I did not understand.
6
"I eased him of the burden there,
that on his shoulders lay;
His palms by me delivered were,
from carrying hods of clay.
7
Thou call'dst me in distress, thy yoke
of bondage I removed;
To thee in cloud of thunder spoke,
at Meribah thee proved. Selah.
8
Hear, O my people, my Record,
and I will witness bear;
O Israel, to this my word,
give thou but heedfull ear.
9
Strange God in thee there shall none be,
nor worship shall thou spend,
To any other God but me,
thine humbled knee to bend.
10
I, that from Egypt up thee brought,
the Lord thy God am still;
Whom land nor sea can fill, thy throat
wide open, I shall fill.
11
But this my people would not hear,
my voice could not atone;
Of me, for favor nor for fear,
my Israel would none.
12
On this revolt, and breach of trust,
did I from him depart;
And sent them, to pursue their lust,
the counsels of their heart.
13
O, had their ear my people bent,
in their declining days,
Had Israel his wanderings spent
in walking in my ways.
14
Their foes I should have soon put down,
that now against them stand;
On their distressors heads have thrown
my wraths directed hand.
15
The haters of the Lord, with lies,
confounded had been found;
But of their favor, in his eyes,
had boundless been the bound.
16
With fat of wheat would I have fed
his hunger, highly prized;
And from the Rock, with honey shed,
would I have thee sufficed.
PSALM. 82. Deus stetit in Synagoga. Psalmus Asaphi.
WIth Princes (peoples heads) the head
of Princes, God does stand,
Great Judge amidst the gods to plead,
with Judges of the land.
2
How long will ye Judge evil good,
in wrongs no measure kept:
Of wicked heads, prefer the hood,
the faces, well accept?
3
The weak, and fatherless befriend,
that Justice judge them right;
The needy and distressed defend,
from over-bearing might.
4
The weakling, and the poor discharge,
that they may live un-harm'd,
Them, from the powerful hand enlarge,
which wickedness has armed.
5
They know not, neither understand,
their walks in darkness end:
Move all foundations of the Land,
it moves them not to mend.
6
That ye are Gods, so said have I,
sons of the Highest, all:
7
Yet sure, ye Gods, like men shall die,
and, one with Princes, fall.
8
Great Judge on earth, of Kingdoms King,
thy self, O God, advance:
For, all the Nations shall thou bring
to thine Inheritance.
PSALM. 83. Deus, quis? Canticum Psalmi Asaph.
CEase nor, as deaf, O God, so long,
so long hold not thy peace:
In silence still keep not thy tongue,
O God, thy ceasing cease.
2
For lo, thy foes a tumult make,
rheir troops against us lead;
And they that hate thee, for our sake,
have lifted up their head.
3
Against thy people they discourse,
in consultations:
Contriving fraud with open force,
against thy secret ones.
4
Come, Let us cut them off (they said)
that Nation never more,
Nor name of Israel decal'd,
remembering Age restore.
5
For they have cast with one consent,
and struck a league in heart,
Their powerful arms against thee bent,
against us to convert.
6
The Tents of Edom, Ismaelites,
with Moabs mis-borne breed:
The Hagarens, the Gebalites,
and peopled Ammons seed.
7
With them does Amalek conspire,
with them Pelesheth runs:
Ashur, with them that dwell at Tire,
arm Lots rebellious sons. Selah.
8
Such end do thou upon them bring,
as Madian Princes took:
Like Sisara, like Jabin King,
that fell at Kishon brook.
9
Which perished on Endor plain,
where (monuments of shame)
In dust and blood, their bodies slain,
as dung on earth became.
10
Let Oreb, and let Zeeb foretell
theirs, and their Princes fall:
As Zebach, and Zalmunnah fell,
so fall their Princes all.
11
Which said, "Our Houses to advance,
Gods Houses let us take;
And heirs of his Inheritance,
our heirs succeeding, make.
12
Make like a wheel, my God, the race
of their outrageous lives;
Or, as the winds distemp'red face,
the withered stubble drives.
13
As fire, that burns up the wood,
and bares the thickest hold;
Or, as the flame devoures for food
the Mountains sulphur-mold.
14
So with thy tempests wrath dismayed,
pursue them to the death;
And make them with thy storm afraid,
to draw their guilty breath.
15
Their brazen faces, brands of shame,
their souls, of sorrow, bear,
That they, O Lord, may seek thy Name,
if not for love, for fear.
16
Confusion sudden evermore,
and trouble them torment;
And give their sinful lives before,
a shameful deaths event.
17
That they may know, that thou alone,
whose name is ETERNAL,
On earth thy footstool, Heaven thy Throne,
Most-Hie art over all.
PSALM. 84. Quam dilecta? Ad Praestantem, super Gittith. Filiorum Choreh Psalmus.
HOw amiable (Lord of Hosts)
thy dwelling places are?
How far above all other coasts,
thy Tents exceed compare?
2
Lord, of thy Courts, to joy the sight,
my longing soul suspires,
My flesh, my heart, above delight,
the living God desires.
3
The Sparrow finds a room to rest,
from reach of common wrong:
The Swallow builds a curious nest,
where she may couch her young.
4
They, Lord of Hosts, within thy roof,
even to thine Altars home,
My King, my God, without reproof,
(O me excluded) come.
5
With them, what blessings dwellers are,
that in thy dwellings dwell:
A house for thee, their hearts prepare,
thy praises shall they tell. Selah.
6
They through the vale of Baca go,
where tears find comforts spring;
And showers, to quench the sighs of woe,
in cisterns, blessings bring.
7
So marching on, from strength to strength,
them shall their vigor bear;
Till to the God of Gods, at length,
in Sion they appear.
8
Lord God of Hosts, from Heaven thy seat,
my supplication hear:
To what my prayers of thee entreat,
O Jacobs God, give ^are.
9
See who it is that sues for grace,
see whom thou have forsook:
O God, our shield, upon the face
of thine anointed look.
10
For, in thy Courts the sweet content,
that one day spent, commends;
Is better than a thousand spent,
that elsewhere any spends.
More in thine House love I their room,
that at thy threshold sit;
Than in their Tents, my God, to come,
that wickedness commit.
11
For God the Lord our Sun and Shield,
will grace and glory give;
And no good thing withhold to yield,
to them that perfect live.
12
O Lord of Hosts, thy Arm of Power,
that Armies powers does bend;
Shall on the man thy blessings power,
whose hopes on thee depend.
PSALM. 85. Benedixisli Domine. Ad Praestantem, filiis Choreb, Psalmus.
NOw art thou gracious Lord become,
unto thy chosen Land:
Thou have returned thy Jacob home,
redeemed from captive hand.
2
Thy peoples faults have thou forgiven,
and covered all their sin:
Thy furious wrath away have driven,
and called thine anger in.
3
O God of our salvation, see,
our former cares increase:
Turn thou to us, turn us to thee,
thine indignation cease.
4
For ever will thou be displeased
with us, and never end?
Will thou, thine anger un-appeas'd,
to Age and Age extend?
5
Will thou not once return again,
and us to life restore;
That we, thy peoples poor remain,
may joy in thee therefore?
6
Severely, Lord, as thou have dealt,
to us thy mercy show:
Thy heavy hand, as we have felt,
thy saving health bestow.
7
To hear what God the Lord will speak,
with heed will I attend:
Whose promise he will never break,
but with performance end.
For he will cause our pressures cease,
and comfort such as mourn;
And to his gracious Saints speak peace,
lest they to folly turn.
8
His saving health, sure near at hand,
shall they that fear him win:
That glory may in-dwell our land,
in glorious made by sin.
9
With Mercy, Truth in one did meet,
and hands together strike;
Where Justice, Peace with kiss did greet,
and peace returned the like.
10
Truth, Heaven her place of birth forsook,
out of the earth shall spring;
And Justice down from Heaven shall look,
a heaven on earth to bring.
11
The Lord his goodness shall express,
so shall our Land not cease;
The Lord with blessings us to bless,
our Land with fruits increase.
12
Before his face shall Justice go,
and in the way respect,
To put her ordered footsteps so,
as he shall them direct.
PSALM. 86. Inclina Domine. Oration Davidis.
INcline thine ear, O Lord, to me,
and hear my humble prayer:
For poor and needy, I to thee,
for answer make repair.
2
Thee, let my soul her keeper have,
for merciful am I:
Thou, O my God, thy servant save,
whose hopes on thee rely.
3
Upon thee all day calls my voice,
Lord, for thy Graces gift:
4
O, make thy servants soul rejoice,
which, Lord, to thee I list.
5
For thou, O Lord, art good to all,
and ready to forgive;
And much in mercy, all that call
upon thee, to relieve.
6
Give ear, Lord, what my prayer requires,
in these extremes of mine;
And of my humble-ey'd desires,
unto the voice incline.
7
I, in the day of my distress,
will call aloud to thee;
Nor doubt access, nor good success,
for thou will answer me.
8
Among the Gods, O Lord, is none
with thee that can compare:
Nor like the works that thou have done,
works done by any are.
9
All people, Lord, whom thou have framed,
shall come and worship thee,
And glorious shall thy Name be named,
by Nations all that be.
For, great thou art, as we have found,
by those great marvels done:
That neither equal have, nor bound,
thou God, thy self alone.
10
My walks, Lord, in thy way so fit,
and in thy truth so frame;
My heart to thee so firmly knit,
that I may fear thy Name.
11
To sing, O Lord my God, thy praise,
my heart shall wholly tend;
And to thy Name such glory raise,
as never shall have end.
12
For toward me thy mercy great,
no measure may esteem;
And from in Hell the lowest seat,
my soul did thou redeem.
13
The proud, O God, against me rise,
and force with falsehood met,
Have sought to make my soul their prize,
nor thee before them set.
14
Thy pity, streams, Lord God, so strong,
as no compassion such:
Thy grace abundant, suffrance long,
thy Truth and Mercy much.
15
O turn thy face to me at length,
as grace has well begun;
To me thy servant give thy strength,
and save thy handmaids son.
Some sign, for good, upon me show,
which let my haters see;
And blush, when thou, O Lord, they know,
did help and comfort me.
PSALM. 87. Fundamenta ejus. Filiis Choreb. Psalm^^ C^n^^ct.
LOw, where the hallowed Mountains fall,
lie his foundation-plates*
2
Much more than Jacobs dwellings all,
the Lord loves Sion gates.
3
Like glorious things have not been heard,
nor modern, nor of old,
To God, thou City most endeared,
as have of thee been told. Selah.
4
In my remembrance Rahab runs,
and Babel, knowing me:
Lo Palestine, and Tire, thy sons,
with Cush, there borne was he.
5
And of thee, Sion, shall be said,
the mother of us all,
Whom the Most-Hie so firm has laid,
shall man and man thee call.
6
With him, when he the peoples writes,
the Lord shall first begin;
And say, when he their names recites,
This man was borne therein. Selah.
7
Singers, and Instruments that sound,
rejoycers all with me:
Voice, string, wind, water-falls abound,
"My springs are all in thee.
PSALM. 88. Domine, Deus Salutis. Canticum Psalmi, filiis Choreh, ad
Praestantem, super Mahalath Lignanoth, Maschil, Heman Israitae.
MY crying supplication,
Before thee day and night,
Lord God of my salvation,
2
Let enter in thy sight.
Incline thine ear, and hear me,
My souls full troubles tell,
3
Whose evils trench so near me,
My life draws near to Hell.
4
Like them to death betaken,
That down the pit are gone,
I seem a man forsaken;
A strength, that strength has none.
5
Among the dead, free-sleeping,
That in the grave lie slain,
Which (cast out of thy keeping)
Cut from the hand remain.
6
My head thou have captived
Within the lowest pit,
Where I of light deprived,
In deeps of darkness sit.
7
Thy furies heat inflicted,
Lies heavy on my crown,
With all thy floods afflicted,
Thy billows bear me down. Selah.
8
Set far from mine acquaintance,
To them thou have me set,
Abhorred, shut up in durance,
Whence out I cannot get.
9
Faint-ey'd, to tuning fall I,
Afflictions sobs my Psalms,
On thee, Lord, all day call I,
To thee I spread my palms.
10
Will thou from deaths vast Regions,
Prodigious shadows raise;
Of all those Idoll-legions,
What one shall sing thy praise?
11
And shall thy loving kindness,
Within the garve be told?
Or shall ABADDON'S blindness,
Thy faithfulness unfold?
12
Thy deeds of Admiration
Shall Darkness bring to light?
Who in Oblivions Nation,
Thy Justice shall recite?
13
But, Lord, to thee sincerely
My plaint do I present;
And in the morning early,
My prai'r shall thee prevent.
14
Why, Lord, do thou reject me?
Why lay my soul aside?
Why let thine ear neglect me?
Thy face why do thou hide?
15
Afflicted soul, deceasing,
Thy ceaseless stripes I bear,
From since my youths increasing,
Distraction, doubtful fear.
16
Thine angers over grow me,
Thy frightings me dismay:
17
All round they overflow me,
Like waters, all the day.
18
From me thou have removed
My friends, my known delight,
My lovers, my beloved,
Are darkness in my sight.
PSALM. 89. Misericordias Domini. Maschil, Etan Israitae.
THe tender mercies of the Lord
shall ever be my song;
So shall my mouth thy truths record,
to age and age prolong.
2
For mercy shall be built (I said)
eternal to endure:
The Heavens established have thou laid,
then Heaven, thy truth more sure.
3
The Covenant with thy chosen struck,
shall in my mind be borne:
The oath, which I to David took,
to him my servant sworn.
4
For ever, of thy seed to reign,
will I establish one;
To Age and Age that shall remain,
will I build up thy Throne. Selah.
5
In speechless speech the Heavens, O Lord,
thy wondrous works confess;
The Saints Assemblies, of thy Word
declare the faithfulness.
6
For who in Heavens high Mansions
may with the Lord compare?
Or who among the mighties sons,
can equal lordship share?
7
God is exceeding dreadful, where
his Saints their secret hold;
And round about him full of fear,
all-over to behold.
8
Lord God of Hosts, All-powerfull Lord,
what power is like to thine?
The splendor of whose faithful Word,
does round about thee shine.
9
Thou rul'st the swelling of the Seas,
proud billows of the Maine;
Their waves high-rising to appease,
and still their storms again.
10
The Pharian Rahab did thou smite,
as one that wounded lies:
Thou scatt'redst with thine arm of might
thy mighty enemies.
11
Thine are the Heavens, the earth is thine,
the world thy Word did found;
And all within the vast Machine,
the plenty of this Round.
12
Thee, North and South, Creator call,
to sing thy Name they run:
From Western Tabors shady fall,
from Chermons rising Sun.
13
Thou have a Mighty Arms command,
extended far and nie:
Of strength resistlesse is thy hand,
and thy right hand is hie.
14
With Justice Judgment, Bases stand,
supporters of thy Throne;
And Truth with Mercy, hand in hand,
before thy face are gone.
15
O people blessed, that know aright
the Trumpets joyful sound;
Still walking in thy faces light,
shall they, O Lord, be found.
16
For in thy Name shall they delight,
all day remembering thee;
And in thy Justice made upright,
shall they exalted be.
17
The glory of their strength thou art,
to us thy favor borne,
Shall be the strengthner of our heart,
up-lifter of our Horn.
18
Suffice it, that the Lord alone
in our defense we bring:
Our shield is of the Holy One
of Israel, our King.
19
In Vision, to thy Holy One,
then spoke thy Spirit, and said,
My help have I, to hold the Throne,
on one, made Mighty, laid.
20
One of the people, raised to lead
my flock, did I appoint,
My servant David, and his head,
my holy oil anoint.
21
With whom my hand shall be so strong,
that strengthened with my arm,
Him, nor exacting foe shall wrong,
nor son of evil harm.
22
And his distressors, from his face,
with strokes will I beat down;
And give my plague a lighting place
upon his haters crown.
23
My faithfulness shall be the same,
with him my mercy rest;
His Horn shall flourish in my Name,
with high-exalted crest.
24
From shore to shore, from land to land,
enrich't with unbought goods,
I in the sea will set his hand,
his right hand in the floods.
25
Himself the issue of my stock,
my son, and me lie shall,
My father thou, my God, the Rock
of my salvation call.
26
And him the firstborn will I give,
the Kings of earth above;
With him my love shall ever live,
my Covenant faithful prove.
27
And in their changes to succeed,
when times and times are done;
For ever will I set his seed,
as days of Heaven his Throne.
28
But if my Law his sons forsake,
my Judgments walk beside;
Profane my Statutes, fail to take
my Precepts for their guide.
29
To visit their misdeeds will I
then with the rod begin;
Lay stripes on their iniquity,
and scourge them for their sin.
30
My mercy yet shall no repeal,
to part from him prevail;
Nor I with him will falsely deal,
against my faith, nor fail.
31
My covenant shall no change profane,
what league my lips did tie:
My Holiness once swore in vain,
if I to David lie.
32
His seed shall ever be: His Throne
before me shall appear,
Like Heavens bright pair, the Sun, the Moon,
that faithful witness bear.
34
But thine Anointed left forsook,
thy wrath has beaten down;
The Covenant of thy servant broke,
profaned on earth his Crown.
35
His hedges all has overthrown,
wide open flung his folds,
Where any fort of his was known,
to ruin brought his holds.
36
All passengers of him make prey,
to neighbors nearer home
An object, he of scorn and play
a loud reproach become.
37
His foes right hand have thou up-set,
his hands success to cross:
Their joy, his joys from him to get,
their laughter made his loss.
38
His swords keen edge did thou abate,
his hand in battle bound;
Have made to cease his glories date,
and thrown his throne to ground.
39
His days of youth have thou made short,
cut off before they came:
Un-ripened reapt, but to abort,
and wrapped him up with shame. Selah.
40
For ever, Lord, and no return,
how long self absent?
How long will thou thy wrath shall burn,
like fire, and not relent?
41
Remember, O how swift my time,
how short my ages span?
In vain, why all the sons of slime,
have thou created man?
42
What strong man lives, and sees not death
or who his soul shall save;
And stop the hand that stops his breath,
the hand of Hell, the Grave? Selah.
43
Where, Lord, where are those loves of old,
thy former favors borne,
So long forborne, so quenched, so cold,
thy faith to David sworn?
44
Remember, Lord, thy servants shames,
what foul reproach they hear;
How many (all great peoples) blames,
I in my bosom bear.
45
Wherewith thy foes, Lord, have reproach't,
wherewith reproach't they have:
Of thine Anointed scandals broach't,
the footsteps to deprave.
To Age and Age, as heretofore,
among the sons of men:
Blessed be the Lord for evermore,
Amen (say we) Amen.
Finis Libri tortii.
LIB. IIII.
PSALM. 90. Domine, refugium. Oration Mosis Viri Dei.
THou, Lord, have bin our dwelling place,
nor other refuge we;
Nor other found our fathers race,
from Age to Age but thee.
2
Before the Mountains borne were named,
of mother earth a part:
Before the earth or world were framed,
eternal God thou ART.
3
Man to his mold dissolved thou laist
in dust of death, and then,
To frail and contrite earth thou say,
Return ye sons of men.
4
For years a thousand in thine eyes,
are but as yesterday;
When past it is, by night; so flies
the wing'd-foot watch away.
5
Thou bearst them as a flood of sleep,
that slides along the sand;
As morning deaws on Meddowes weep,
that wait the Mowers hand.
6
Whose grass the rising Sun sees green,
and flowring fresh as day;
Which down at evening mowne is seen,
a withered lock of hay.
7
For as thine anger waxes great,
so we consume withal;
And troubled at thy furies heat,
how sudden is our fall?
8
Our faults, that fear or shame would hide,
before thee have thou set;
And at thy faces light descri'd,
our secret sins are met.
9
For when thy wrath on us is brought,
then all our days decline:
Our years consume we as a thought,
our blast of breath resign.
10
Our days are threescore years and ten,
fourscore, if strength supply,
Pride reapt with pain, and (wretched men)
how soon away we fly?
11
Who knows what power thine anger has,
who has the power to bear?
Sure, best the fury of thy wrath,
is measured by thy fear.
12
O teach us then to know our days,
their number so to try,
That taught by thee to wisdoms ways,
our hearts we may apply.
13
Return, O Lord, how long? at last,
O let it thee repent:
Of thy displeasures bitter blast,
against thy servants bent.
14
And let thy mercies morning deaw,
upon us down distill;
So all our days of life (a few)
shall joy and gladness fill.
15
Like joyful days, as while by thee
afflicted we have been;
Good years, like many, let us see,
as evil we have seen.
16
And what thy hand for us has wrought,
to us thy servants show;
And what thy glory forth has brought,
make thou our sons to know.
17
And, Lord our God, on us let stand,
thy pleasing graciousnesse:
To prosper what we take in hand,
our handy work to bless.
PSALM. 91. Qui habitat.
HE that with him, that is Most-Hie,
in secret shall abide,
Shall to the Almighties shadow fly,
his safe-lodg'd head to hide.
2
With him: "My refuge, thou, my Fort,
(say to the Lord will I;)
My God, with whom in safeties Port,
my hopes at anchor lie.
3
He, where the Fowler sets his snare,
shall set thee free from thence;
And to preserve thee have a care,
from woeful Pestilence.
4
His wing, to over-shade thee spread,
his plumes thy confidence:
His Truth a shield to save thy head,
a buckler for defense.
5
Nor shall thee, terror of the night,
nor arrow shot by day:
6
Nor Plague, that walks in darkness, smite,
nor noon-tide-KETEB slay.
7
A thousand fall beside thee shall,
yet thou not fall thereby:
Ten thousand at thy right hand fall,
yet thee no Plague come nie.
8
This only shall thine eye behold,
what payment for their pain:
For what reward their service sold,
what hire the wicked gain.
9
Because thou, Lord (my hope has said)
my hope do fortify;
The Mansion of my hope is laid
in him, that is Most-Hie.
10
There shall no evil thee befall,
thy Tent no Plague annoy:
11
Thy keepers, he his Angels shall
in all thy ways employ.
12
And they, to bear thee up from ground,
shall join their palms in one:
Thy foot, lest lightly thou should wound,
or dash against a stone.
13
Upon the Lion shall thou tread,
upon the Aspikes crown:
The Lions whelp, the Dragons head,
thy foot shall trample down.
14
Because on me he set his love,
whence his deliverance came;
Him will I set his harms above,
for he has known my Name.
15
His calling on me will I hear,
and answer his entreat:
Be with him in distress, set clear,
and make his honor great.
16
Long life on him will I bestow,
and fill him full of days;
And unto him the splendor show
of my salvations rays.
PSALM. 92. Bonum est confiteri. Ad diem Sabbathi.
TO praise the Lord, is to present
a good and gracious thing;
And, O Most-Hie, a day well spent,
Psalms to thy Name to sing.
2
When for my morning songs delight,
I strike thy Mercies string:
Still-musicke, when to silent night,
thy faithfulness I sing.
3
To touch the ten-string'd Lute with art,
on Psalterie to sound;
The meditation of my heart,
to make my Harp expound.
4
For thou, O Lord, have made me glad,
such work thou bringst about;
And such success thy hands have had,
that I for joy will shout.
5
Thine actions are, O Lord, how great?
thy thoughts exceeding deep,
Whereof the brute has no conceit,
the foolish takes no keep.
6
When, like the grass, the wicked grows,
to evil doers nie:
Their endless fall, their flower fore-shewes;
thou Lord, for ever hie.
8
For, lo thy foes, Lord, lo thy foes,
their ruins time attends;
And wicked workers work the woes,
that work them woeful ends.
9
But like the Unicorne's, my Horn,
exalted shall appear:
And with fresh Oil, mine Age, unworne,
anointed, shall I bear;
10
With envious eyes, who me behold,
their fall shall feed mine eyes,
Mine eyes shall hear their ruin told,
that up against me rise.
11
The Just shall like a Palm tree spread,
what blast soever blows,
And Cedar-like, lift up his head,
in Lebanon that grows.
12
The planted, where the Lord does dwell,
the plants there rooted deep;
Within the Courts shall prosper well,
where house our God does keep.
13
Their graynesse fruit yet forth shall bring,
no Ages grievance, seen:
Their Almond-tree, their Autumne-spring,
shall sprout out fat and green.
14
That they may show, and men may see,
the Lord to be upright;
That no unrighteousness can be
in him, my Rock of might.
PSALM. 93. Dominus regnaoit.
THe Lord reigns Sovereign Governor,
is clothed with glory bright:
The Lord is clothed in robes of power,
has girt himself with might.
The world is also made so sure,
to be removed by none:
2
From then, established to endure,
eternal is thy Throne.
3
The floods up-rais'd, Lord, make a noise,
with mouths, like gaping graves,
The floods have lifted up their voice,
the floods lift up their waves.
4
When many waters voices cry,
and winds raise mighty seas,
More mighty he that sits on hie,
the Lord can them appease.
5
Thy Testimonies are the sums
of very faithful says:
Thine House, Lord, Holiness becomes,
to endless length of days.
PSALM. 94. Deus ultionum.
LOrd God, to whom revenge belongs,
set forth thy self thereto:
O God, avenger of all wrongs,
show what thy power can do.
2
Judge of the earth, lift up thy head,
the proud hit up their hearts;
Upon the haughty-hearted tread,
reward them their deserts.
3
How long insult, O Lord, how long
shall wicked, wicked scorn,
Contriving, executing wrong,
with such delight be borne?
4
How long shall wicked workers speak
the language of disdain;
And forth in such proud boastings break
their mischiefs, bred with pain?
5
Thy people, Lord, they bruise, they bray,
thine heritage oppress:
The widow and the stranger slay,
strike dead the fatherless.
6
God shall not look (say they) so nie,
and who shall make him know?
7
The God of Jacob is too hie,
to understand so low.
8
Unwise among the people heed,
in time your selves advise,
Before too far your pride proceed:
Fools, when will ye be wise?
9
Shall he, whose hand did plant the ear,
of hearing have no sense?
Nor sight, the eyes great Enginer,
that formed their sevenfold fense?
10
He that whole Nations does chastise,
his censure who shall bear?
He that in knowledge schools the wise,
his compass who shall steer?
11
The Lord, he knows man's thoughts (vain fool)
to vain conclusions draw:
12
Blessed (Lord) the man thou sett'st to school,
and lesson'st in thy Law.
13
To give him, from the evil days,
in quiet rest to sit:
From them that follow wicked ways,
until be dug the pit.
14
His people want the Lord may make,
yet will not leave them there;
Nor his Inheritance forsake,
howbeit, sometime forbear.
15
But Judgment shall to Justice fall,
to Righteousness revert;
And after it shall follow all
that are upright in heart.
16
Against the evil doers head,
with me who lifts a hand?
Against iniquity to plead,
on my part who will stand?
17
If from the Lord, that never fails,
some help I had not felt,
My soul had then (that now prevails)
almost in silence dwelt.
18
When, Lord, I said my foot did move,
thy mercy was my stay;
My souls delights (thy comforts) drove
my clouds of thoughts away.
19
Of Tyran-evills shall the throne
have fellowship with thee;
Whose shadowed lusts, for law have gone,
of mischief make decree?
20
The Just man's soul they hunt by troops,
condemn the guiltless blood:
21
My refuge yet, the Lord, my hopes,
my God their Rock, makes good.
22
On them the Lord shall cause to fall
their painful wickedness:
Suppress them in their malice shall,
our God shall them suppress.
PSALM. 95. Venite, exultemus.
COme to the Lord, sing joyfully,
let us together flock;
And shout aloud triumphantly,
in our Salvations Rock.
2
His face with praise let us prevent,
in him with Psalms rejoice:
Triumphant shouts to him present,
and make a cheerful noise.
3
For why? the Lord our God is great,
a mighty King he is:
Above all gods, the Sovereign seat,
the power Imperial his.
4
The deeps of earth are in his hand,
his, is the strength of Hills:
The shore-bound sea, the dry-laid land,
his hand that formed, fulfills.
5
O come, and let us then adore,
due worship yield him all;
And prostrate on our knees, before
the Lord our Maker fall.
6
For in his folds and fields is he
our God, that does us keep:
The pasture his, his people we,
we of his hand the sheep.
7
To day his voice if ye will hear,
then harden not your hearts:
In Meribah, like them that were,
in Massah's Desert parts.
8
That day your fathers faulty were,
shook off their former awe:
9
To tempt Me fell, to prove Me there,
and yet my works they saw.
10
To whom (said I) with grief de ferr'd,
full forty years of da^es,
This people in their heart have erred,
and have not known my ways.
11
To whom I swore it in my wrath,
hot boiling in my breast:
If ever --: witness this mine oath,
they enter not my rest.
PSALM. 96. Canta^e Domino.
SIng to the Lord a new set song,
that all the earth may sing;
That all, that to the Lord belong,
his praise aloud may ring.
2
Sing to the Lord, and bless his Name,
wherever day does dwell;
Good tidings day by day proclaim,
of his salvation tell.
3
Among the Heath'ns his glory show,
to Nations far and near;
His wonders let the people know,
with wondrous gladness hear.
4
For great the Lord, his greatness more,
than can by praise be praised:
All other gods above, before,
his fear is to be raised.
5
For all the gods among the Heath'ns,
are off-gods, Idols vain:
The Lord is he that made the Heavens,
of Heavens, that holds the reine.
6
Before him beams of glory bright,
and Majesty bow down:
His Sanctuary, marchlesse might,
and beauteous glory crown.
7
Ascribe unto the Lord, ascribe
of every line that live;
Of all the people, every tribe,
all power and glory give.
8
Give to the Lord the honored Name,
that with his glory sorts:
Take up an offering to the same,
and come into his Courts.
9
In honor of his Holy place,
before the Lord appear:
Bow down your selves, and at his face
stand all the earth in fear.
10
The Lord (so tell the Nations) reigns,
established by his might:
That he, the world unmoved contains,
shall judge the people right.
11
Let Heavens (the havens of joy) rejoice,
and let the earth be glad;
The sea set forth his roaring voice,
in all his plenty clad.
12
Field, and what ever clothes the field,
shout out in speechless noise;
All trees, that Frith or Forest yield,
before the Lord rejoice.
13
Because he comes, because he comes,
with Judgment in his mouth,
To judge the world with righteous doomes,
earths people with his Truth.
PSALM. 97. Dominus regnavit.
Rejoice let earths whole Continent,
it is the Lord that reigns:
Be glad, ye many Islands, pent
within the Maines demaines.
2
About him clouds and darkness round,
obscured the light that shone:
With Justice, Judgment laid the ground,
the Bases of his Throne.
3
Consuming fire before him goes,
that flaming from on hie,
On every side pursues his foes,
them following where they sly.
4
His lightnings at the world shoot light,
which bright, but dreadful shines;
The earth lies trembling at the sight,
and from her hinge declines.
5
In presence when the Lord appeared,
like wax, the Mountains melt:
The Lord of all the earth they feared,
his presence (trembling) felt.
6
His Justice, as the Heavens declare,
whose Ministers they be;
On earth how great his glories are,
so all the people see.
7
Graven Images all they that serve,
confusion stands before;
That boast of Idols, whom they carve,
him, all ye gods, adore.
8
This Sion heard, and joy'd to hear,
that such success they had;
Thy ^udgements, Lord, with reverend fear,
made Judah's daughters glad.
9
For thou, O Lord, ^ar higher art,
than all the earth is hie;
No height, to thy heights lowest part,
of all the gods comes nie.
10
Hate evil, ye that love the Lord,
who for his Saints does stand;
His servants favour'd-soules restored,
to free from wicked hand.
11
A light is for the Just one sown,
whose crop shall come to light:
From whence shall sheaves of joy be mow'n,
by men in heart upright.
12
Ye ^ust then in the Lord rejoice,
your music make his praise:
His Holiness, with thankful voice,
remembering to up-raise.
PSALM. 98. Cantate Domino.
SIng to the Lord a new-set song,
for wonders has he done:
With holy Arm, whose right hand strong,
has his Salvation won.
2
His saving health the Lord made known,
the Nations eyes beheld:
His Justice to the people shown,
has he himself revealed.
3
His Truth and Mercy, mindful friends
to Isreal's house have been;
And of the earth, have all the ends,
our Gods Salvation seen.
4
Shout to the Lord a cheerful cry,
let all the earth up-raise:
Shout out, rejoice triumphantly,
in joyful Psalms sing praise.
5
Sing Psalms with Harp, with Harp and Voice,
Psalms to the Eternal sing;
6
With Trumpets sound, with Cornets noise,
before the Lord the King.
7
Roar sea, and all that sea full fills,
world, and world-dwellers all:
8
High-rising rivers, high-borne Hills,
clap hands, to shouting fall
9
Before the Lord: for he in ^ight,
to judge the earth is come:
To give the world his judgments right,
the peoples equal doom.
PSALM. 99. Dominus regnavit.
THe Lord is King, though peoples sits,
his reign (in rage) reprove:
Between the Cherubims he sits,
let earths foundations move.
2
The Lord is great in Zions fame,
above all people hie:
3
Great, fearful, holy is his Name,
let their confession cry.
4
Strength-strengthning Judgment loves the King,
of Righteousness his Throne:
With Justice Judgment stablishing,
in Jacob have thou done.
5
The Lord our God, as it is meet,
exalt, and prostrate all;
Before the footstool of his feet,
(for he is Holy) fall.
6
With Moses, Aarons Priests enstall'd,
and Samuel, on his Name,
With them that call, on JAH they called,
the Lord then answered them.
7
He from the cloudy Pillar spoke,
they in obedience have
His Testimonies kept unbroke,
the Law to them he gave.
8
Thou Lord our God did answer make,
their pardoning God thou went;
Yet did thy vengeance overtake,
and their inventions thwart.
9
Exalt the Lord our God, before
his holy Mountain all;
(For Holy is our God) therefore
bow down your selves, and fall.
PSALM. 100. Iubilate De^. Psalmus, ad Confessionem.
SIng loud unto the Lord a song,
that all the earth may ring:
2
With gladness serve the Lord among,
before him come and sing.
3
Know that the Lord is God, that he,
not we our selves did make:
His pasture-sheep, his people, we
from him our being take.
4
Go in his gates, your thanks proclaim,
his praise within his Cour^s:
To praise him, and to bless his Name,
make thither your resorts.
5
For good and gracious is the Lord,
his Mercy never ends:
The truth of his eternal Word,
to Age and Age extends.
PSALM. 101. Misericordiam and Iudicium. Davidis Psalmus.
WHat Mercy, and what Judgment say,
Lord, I will sing to thee:
2
And wisely take the perfect way,
when thou shall come to me.
3
My self will good example give,
to walk with upright heart;
And others, as I live, to live,
amidst my house convert.
3
I will not in mine eyes, abide
a word of Belial:
I hate their work, that turn aside,
nor cleave to me it shall:
4
A froward heart, an evil man,
from me unknown depart:
5
Detractors tongue, nor bear I can,
proud look, nor large of heart.
6
The faithful of the Land mine eyes
so^t out with me to sit;
In perfect way, whose walking lies,
for me is servant fit.
7
Within mine house deceitful wight
there shall not any dwell;
Nor be established in my sight,
whose lips does leasings tell.
8
The wicked all out of the land,
my morning search shall shut,
That from Gods City may my hand
all evil doers cut.
PSALM. 102. Domine, exaudi. Oration afflicti, cum obruitur, and ef^undit coram
Domino meditationem suam.
IN my distress to comfort me,
yet hear, O Lord, my prayer;
And let the crying unto thee
of my complaint repair.
2
Hide not thy face from me this day,
when trouble tells my need:
Incline thine ear, and hear me pray,
to answer me make speed.
3
For here my days consumed on earth,
away like smoke are gone:
My bones are burnt up, lie an hearth
of fire-out-eaten stone.
4
My heart is smitten down for dead,
and withred as the grass;
That I, to eat my daily bread,
forgetful, overpasse.
5
My breast, my sorrows uncouth Inn,
breathes forth such broken groans,
My flesh but knits up with my skin,
a sack of saplesse bones.
6
So mournes the Wildernesses Foul,
the Hermit-Pellican:
In Dese^t shades so shri^kes the Owl,
portending spells of bane.
7
I watch the widowed Sparrowes watch,
on houses ridge alone,
That of (her better half) her match,
bewailes the comfort gone.
8
Reproaches bitter gall, my foes
cast daily in my dish;
And in their madness make my woes,
the measure of their wish.
9
For I, when faintness would be fed,
and thirst no longer bears,
Have eaten ashes as my bread,
and blent my drinks with tears.
10
Thine angry threat so sore does lie,
so fierce thy wrath does grow;
Thy hand but heaved me up so hie
to hurl me down as low.
11
The shadow of my days declined,
my light in darkness spends;
Like withred grass my breath resigned,
the house of death attends.
12
But thou, O Lord, one and the same,
for ever do reside;
And this Memorial of thy Name,
shall age and age abide.
13
Thou to thy mercies seat shall climb,
and bring thy Sion home:
For now of mercy is the time,
(the time appointed) come.
14
Now, though thy servants naught relieve,
delight her stones yet move:
To see her in the dust they grieve,
and yet her dust they love.
15
Thy Name, O lord, the Heath'ns shall fear,
to find what thou have done;
And all the Kings on earth, to hear
what glory thou have won.
16
When Sion up the Lord to build,
in glory shall appear:
17
He to the lowlies prayer shall yield,
nor them despise to hear.
18
This writing shall remain un-worne,
when after-age shall live;
And praise, the people yet un-borne,
unto the Lord shall give.
For from his Sanctuaries height,
he down did cast his look:
The Lord from Heaven did veil his sight,
when earths survey he took.
20
To hear the heavy groans of those,
that draw imprisoned breath;
From chimes of iron chains to loose
the eldest sons of death.
21
That of the Lord their tongues the Name
in Sion may declare;
And in Jerusalem proclaim
his praises what they are.
22
When Nations, from their farthest home,
together gathred meet:
To serve the Lord, when Sovereigns come,
and Kingdoms kiss his feet.
23
My strength, when able strength began,
he weakened in my ways:
Cut off my pilgrimages span,
and shorter made my days.
24
I said, my God, post not my Sun
at noone to mid-nights stage;
My race of days is half to run,
thy years are Age and Age.
25
The earths foundations, on their weight,
thou Lord have laid of old:
Those lamps of Heaven, their orbs, their height,
thy fingers did enfold.
26
When they shall perish, thou shall hold
the Center of thy years:
They, as a garment, all wax old,
as changed, a vesture wears.
27
But thee, for evermore the same,
no compass comprehends;
And of thy years eternal frame,
the circle never ends.
28
Thy servants children shall succeed,
to stand before thee fast;
And last-succeeding times, their seed
succeeding, shall out-last.
PSALM. 103. Benedic anima. D^vidis.
MY soul, and every secret part,
within my bodies frame,
To praise the Lord assist my heart,
to bless his holy Name.
2
To bless the Lord, let nothing let
my soul thy ready way:
No benefit of his forget,
with praises to repay.
3
Which pardoning all thy sins fore-past,
w^^h thee in mercy deals;
To cure thy frailties does forecast,
and all thy sickness heales.
4
Which frees thy life from going down
into corruptions Pit;
His mercies and Compassions Crown
upon thine head does fit.
5
With good things, to thy hearts desire,
which satiates thy mouth;
And, Eagle-like, renewes the fire,
in embers of thy youth.
6
To Justices the Lord gives light,
he guides the balance best;
And Judgments executes aright,
to all that are oppressed.
7
His ways he made to Moses known,
the limits of his Law:
His wondrous actions, all his own,
the sons of Israel saw.
8
Compassion from the Lord does flow,
for clemency none such;
Of suffrance long, to anger flow,
his tender mercy much.
9
His censure checkes not each offense,
he will not always chide;
Nor keep his anger in suspense,
for ever to abide.
10
He has not, as our sins require,
with us severely dealt;
Nor our iniquities like hire,
to our deserts have felt.
11
But, as the Heavens unmeasured height,
above the earth is hie;
Such is his Mercies matchless might,
to them that fear him, nie.
12
As far as whore the Sun begins,
to where he sets the day;
So far has he removed our sins,
and rid his wrath away.
13
As with compassion on his sons,
a fathers bowels melt;
So in the Lord compassion runs,
by them that fear him, felt.
14
For to the mold he knows we must,
whereof our mass was made:
Remembers that we be but dust,
our Harbinger, the spade.
15
The days of man, as of the grass,
attend the sith of death:
As flower in field, his flower does pass,
and withreth with a breath.
16
A blast of wind upon it blew,
and then it ceast to grow;
Then ceast to be, and where it grew,
the place no more did know,
17
To them the Lord is ever kind,
that to his fear do cleave*
Them shall the childrens children find,
his Justice shall not leave.
18
On them, that to his Covenant bind
their hearts observance strait;
And his Commandments bear in mind
to practice, Mercies wait.
19
The Lord has firmly for his stall
in Heavens prepared his Throne:
His Kingdoms Scepter over all
has Soveraigntie alone.
20
O ye his Angels, bless the Lord,
y^ that in strength excel;
That do his Word, and of his Word
attend the voices spell.
21
Bless ye the Lord, all ye his Hosts,
his Armies at his will;
His Cursitors in all his coasts,
his pleasure to fulfill.
22
All ye his works, that where he reigns,
all places may afford:
To bless the Lord employ your pains,
may soul, bless thou the Lord.
PSALM. 104. Benedic anima.
SIng to the Lord, my soul, sing praise;
Thou Lord my God art wondrous great,
Whose vestures golden-circled rays,
With beauteous glory crown thy seat.
2
Which deck'st thy self, as with a robe,
With light, that never eye attained;
Which for thy veil about earths globe,
The Canopie of Heaven have strained.
3
His roofes with starre-set seas he seeles,
Their beams in plates of waters binds,
Ascends the clouds, his chariot wheels,
And walks upon the long-wing'd winds.
4
He makes his Angels messengers,
And with his Spirit their spirits inspires;
Sends forth his Judgments ministers,
The lightning-foo^ed flames of fires.
5
The earth upon her Bases laid,
To one so equal point he drove,
To one so steadfast Center weighed,
As never weight her weight might move.
6
As with a garment, with the deep,
Thou coveredst earth: the Maine (...)
Maine sea above the Mountains steep,
Above the Mount of Ararat.
7
At thy rebuke the waters fled,
Thy thunders voice them rid away.
8
The Hills un-heald, held up their head,
The Valleys, where thou laidst them, lay.
9
The Waters bound did thou ordain,
Bound, which they should not dare to pass,
Nor ever more return again,
To drown the earth, as once it was.
10
He into Valleys sends his springs,
To dye their dusty mantles green;
From Rock-rent heads their current brings,
To walk the Mountain veins between.
11
Whose channels having cheered the field,
And to the earth given moisture first,
To all the wild Beasts beaverage yield,
There break the Onagers their thirst.
12
The Fowls of heaven their households bring,
And there in notes of Natures choice,
Their Makers Halelu-jahs sing;
Between the branches give the voice.
13
Upon the Mountains garden-land,
His deawes are from his Limbecks stilled:
With store, without man's helping hand,
(Fruit of thy works) the earth is filled.
14
For cattle makes he grass to grow,
And herb for use of earthly man,
Whose simples, who so wise, that know
As well for meat, as medicine can.
15
The earth to bring forth bread and wine,
The wine, with joy that swells the veins,
With oil, that makes man's face to shine,
And bread, that strength of heart sustaines.
16
The trees of God are filled with sap,
The Cedar trees of Lebanon,
Which he has planted on the lap
Of earth, for them to feed upon.
17
That there their nests the Birds may build,
The kind-love Storke, in Pine Tree grove,
18
High Mountain cliffes the Roe-deere wild,
Safe-sheltring Rocks the Conies love,
19
The Moon ne made for certain tides,
Constant in her inconstant face:
The Sun, that daily progress rides,
Of his dismounting knows the place.
20
Thou put darkness, darkness, night;
Then all the woods wild Beasts forth creep,
By prey that live, and love not light,
(Then harmfull wake, when harmless sleep.)
21
Fierce Lions roaring for their prey,
Their food of life from God request:
22
The Sun gets up, they get away,
And in their dens couch down to rest:
23
Then out goes man, to take in hand
His work, till night his travel end,
With toiling Beast from labored land,
Till evening home him weary send.
24
Thy works, O Lord, how many are,
In wisdom have thou made them all,
The earths abundance is thy care,
Whose riches thee Creator call.
25
This sea, so great wide-handed deep,
Thou foundedst, fathom'st, fillst the seat,
Where kinds innumerable creep,
Lords of the sin, both small and great.
26
There ships their course by compass can,
And cut the Maine, to make their way:
There walks the vast Leviathan,
Whom thou therein have formed for play.
27
These all on thee attentive look,
That thou in season give them food;
28
Thou giv'st, they take, and having took,
From thy free hand are filled with good.
29
Thou hid'st from them thy faces day,
They at so sudden trouble mourn;
Their spirit thou take (their breath) away,
They to their dust again return.
30
Again, thou sendest forth thy Spirit,
Whence they created, take their birth,
Which (by traduction) they inherit.
As thou renew'st the face of earth.
31
The glory of the Lord shall shine
For ever in eternal light:
Which length of time shall not confine,
The Lord shall in his works delight.
32
The earth stands trembling at his look,
Unable to endure his sight:
Let him but touch, the Mountains smoke,
And clothe the earth in clouds of night.
33
Sing to the Lord will I so long,
As life in me leaves any breath:
Sung to the Lord shall be my song,
Until my being be in death.
34
My Muse on him shall sweetly call,
And in the Lord rejoice with me:
35
Consumed from earth let sinners fall,
And wicked men no more let be.
PSALM. 105. Confitemini Domino.
COnfessing to the Lord, give thanks,
and call upon his Name:
Make known among the peoples ranks,
his powerful acts proclaim.
2
Sing ye to him, to him sing praise,
a Psalm that shall excel:
His praise-excelling works up-raise,
of all his wonders tell.
3
His holy Name your glory make.
and let their heart rejoice,
That for the Lord all joy forsake,
to seek him set their choice.
4
O seek the Lord with zealous mind,
his Oracle of grace;
His Arc of strength enquire to find,
seek evermore his face.
5
His marvels done, his wonders heed,
his mouths expressions:
6
O ye his servant Abrams seed,
his chosen Jacobs sons.
7
He is the Lord our God, whose care
in us has special right:
In all the earth his Judgments are,
in every Nations sight.
8
His Covenant he does ever mind,
his words command fore-past;
That childrens childrens seed should find
a thousand ages last.
9
This Covenant he with Abram struck,
to Isaac swore to pay:
10
To Jacob for a Law betook,
to Israel for aye.
11
Thine offspring (saying) to advance.
I Cana'n land will give,
The line of thine Inheritance,
wherein thy seed shall live.
12
When few of number, means bereft,
they strangers in the land:
13
One Nation for another left,
as Kingdoms came to band.
14
To do them wrong, he suffered none*
even Kings for them he charmed:
15
"Of mine Anointed touch not one,
nor see my Prophets harmed.
16
He called a famine on the Land,
so long with plenty fed:
To weaken their ungrateful hand,
brake all the staff of bread.
17
Before them, for the dearth foretold,
he sent a man at last;
Young Joseph, for a servant sold,
and into prison cast.
18
His seet in setters fast they pent,
where wrung, and wrested long,
His soul, into the iron went,
into his soul, the wrong.
19
Until his cause for sentence cried,
his innocence to scan:
Until by word the Lord had tried,
what worth was in the man.
20
The King would his discharger be,
for his deliverance sent:
The peoples Ruler set him free
from fault, from punishment.
21
Lord of his house he him assigned,
his substance to assise:
22
His Princes to his soul to bind,
and make his Elders wise.
23
So Israel into Egypt came,
from Cana'ns better clime;
And Jacob in the land of Cham,
did sojourne for a time.
24
His people mightily increase,
then their oppressors made
A Nation more secure for peace,
and stronger to invade.
25
Yet Egypts heart averse was felt,
his people they did hate;
And doubly with his servants dealt,
unjustly held debate.
26
His servant Moses then he sent,
and Aarons chosen head:
27
Words of his signs among them spent,
in Cham his wonders spread.
28
His Word in darkness clothed the light,
three days continued they
In darkness, darker than the night,
and did not disobey.
28
He turned their waters into blood,
their fi^h flung dead on shore;
Changed Nilus to a noisome flood,
her silver streams to gore.
30
Their land in legions brought forth frogs,
in field, in house, in hall:
In Kings bed-chambers, as in bogs,
the loathsome Paddockes crawle.
31
He spoke the word, and in a trice,
a cloud of Vermin armed,
Wing'd-Flies, and Infantries of Lice,
in all their quarters swarmed.
32
For showers of rain from gentler hand,
he flung them stones of hail;
And flames of fire, that made their land
of flock and fruit to fail.
33
With storm their Vine, their Fig Tree struck,
most fruitful, most of all;
Of Trees throughout their border broke
the highest, soonest fall.
34
Of Grasshoppers a mighty press,
his word inspired with power;
And Caterpiller numberless,
35
All herbs and fruit devour.
36
In Egypt all their eldest borne,
with hand of death he smote;
The prime of all their fleece was shorn,
their strongest men of no^e.
37
He brought them forth (these wonders done)
with silver and with gold:
Among their Tribes there was not one,
a feeble person told.
38
At their departure Egypt glad,
was of their stay afraid;
So lately to forsake them, sad,
now loath to see them stayed.
39
A covering of a cloud he spread,
to shade the heat of day:
Of fire by night, a lamp to lead,
and light them on their way.
40
Of Quail, he brought at their request
a shower, that down did rain;
And with the bread of Heaven them blessed,
sufficed with Angels grain.
41
The Rock of stone made open fly,
with waters stored the land,
That rivers ran in places dry,
^^here late lay Desert sand.
42
His holy promise held so fast,
from time it first began
To Abraham his servant past,
in his remembrance ran.
43
With joy his people forth he brought,
his chosen with a shout:
44
And gave them lands, and labors wrought
of Heath'ns, for them cast out:
45
Observe his statutes, that they might,
and of his holy Word
The Laws obey, and learn aright
to practice: Praise the Lord.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 106. Confitemint. Halelu-jah.
THe Lord is good, with thanks confess,
his Mercy has no end:
2
The Lords great powers who can express?
who all his praise commend?
3
What blessings kept for them remain,
that Judgments keepers are!
For him, that Justice to maintain,
at all times sets his care!
4
Remember, Lord, I numbered be
with them thou take to grace:
With thy Salvation visit me,
with thy choice people place.
5
To see what blessings by thy choice,
thy chosen flock have got:
And with thy Nations joy rejoice,
and glory in their lot.
6
We, with our fathers sinfully
transgrest have every one;
Committed like iniquity,
as wickedly have done.
7
Thy wonder-passing wonders past,
which Egypts plagues could find,
Our fathers did not wisely cast,
nor compass in their mind.
Thy many Mercies held no plea,
from their remembrance fell;
But they (revolters) at the sea,
(the red sea) did rebel.
8
Yet for his Names sake, not the less,
was he their Savior:
His Mercy, as they must confess,
to make them know his power.
9
The red seas course he back did keep,
and with rebuke repress:
He led them dry-foot through the deep,
as through the wilderness.
10
And so he set them all on land,
in safety from the foe;
And from their haters harmfull hand
redeemed, and let them go.
11
Their troublers, by the waters fall,
were all of life bereft;
The waters overwhelmed them all,
not one of them was left.
12
With them his words then credit got,
they sung his praise to height:
13
But all in haste his works forgot,
his counsels would not wait.
14
So in the wilderness, at last,
upon them came their lust;
And in ^he Desert, Gods forecast
they tempted with distrust.
15
And food he gave them at their call,
above their lusts content:
But loathing leanness therewithal
into their soul he sent.
15
They weari'd Moses with complaint,
in their envious mood;
And Aaron, of the Lord, the Saint,
within the Camp withstood.
17
The mother-earth that Rebels hates,
an open grave did rive;
Where Dathan and Abirams Mates
were swallowed up alive.
18
And fire from Heaven that kindled came
on their rebellious crew;
Burnt up the wicked in the flame,
their furious treasons due.
19
They made a Calfe in Choreb Mount,
adored a molten Mass:
20
Their glories type, to base account,
turned Ox, that eats grass.
21
And God their Savior they forgate,
his Arms remembrance gone,
That had so mighty things of late
for them in Egypt done.
22
Works wondrous, for a world of graves,
in Chams un-peopled coast;
And fearful, for the red sea waves,
that saved, that drowned, an host.
23
And to destroy them in his mood,
flew out his wrathful speech,
Had not his chosen Moses stood
before him in the breach.
24
His milder temper, mixed with zeal,
Gods wrath, so hot that burned;
With hard entreaty did congeale,
and from corrupting turned.
25
They of desire despised the land,
believing not his word;
But in their tents in tumult stand,
and will not hear the Lord.
26
Against them therefore urged, aloft
he lifted up his hand,
To overthrow them threatened often,
in that forsaken land.
27
Among the Nations, not their own,
to fell their rootlesse seed;
And in the lands, to them unknown,
to fan their exiled breed.
28
And to Baal Phegors Idoll-head,
they joined themselves amain,
The offerings eating of the dead,
to powers Infernal slain.
29
Thus they to anger him provoke,
with Rites that they invent;
And in the plague upon them broke,
their follies punishment.
30
Then stood up Phineas in pursuit
of Cosbies carnal sin;
His hand did Judgment execute,
so was the plague called in.
31
The Author of so just a deed,
his Justice did commend:
From age to age that shall succeed,
whose praise shall never end.
32
They vexed him at the floods of strife,
with Moses ill it went:
For them he had a weary life,
and for their sakes was shent.
33
Because his spirit they did provoke,
and him to murmr pressed;
That unadvisedly he spoke,
and with his lips transgrest.
34
The Nations did they not destroy,
of whom the Lord had said,
Nor land, nor life let them enjoy,
his charge they disobeyed.
35
But mingled with the Heath'ns they were,
to learn their works took care:
36
To serve their Idols well could bear,
which were to them a snare.
37
The blood of sons and daughters slain,
on Devils Altars stood:
Of Innocents the bloody stain
of sons and daughters blood.
Whose limbs their Divellish-led desire
with murthrous hand had pil'd;
To Cana'n-Idolls burnt with fire,
the Land with blood defiled.
38
With works their own thus were they stained,
on them their zeal they spent:
39
As their Inventions entertained,
a whoring thus they went.
40
The fury therefore of the Lord
against his people burned:
His own Inheritance abhorred,
his love to loathing turned.
41
He gave them up to Tyran's law,
into the Heathens hand;
That whom they hated held in awe,
and Lord-like might command.
42
By enemies, with humbling strokes,
oppressed and bowed they were:
Whose hand on them laid heavy yokes,
above their strength to bear.
43
Them many a time did he redeem,
but they eftsoon begin;
And of their counsels more esteem,
though humbled for their sin.
44
Yet when he saw their hard restraint,
how their afflictions grew;
Then harkening he to their complaint,
his chastisement withdrew.
45
His Covenant did he bear in mind,
that he with them had struck;
On them his many mercies kind,
repentant pity took.
46
He gave them to the tender ear
of their Commanders will:
Made them, to whom they captives were,
their eyes with favors fill.
47
Proceed, O Lord our God, to save,
from Heath'ns our heads to raise,
That praise thy holy Name may have,
we glory in thy praise.
48
The Lord the God, of Israel King,
be blessed eternally:
Amen, let all the people sing,
all Halelu-jah cry.

LIB. V.
PSALM. 107. Consitemini Domino.
THe Lord is God, with thanks express,
His mercy is for ever: and
2
So let the Lords redeemed confess,
Redeemed from their distressors hand.
3
Which gathred were out of the lands,
From shining East, from shady West,
From where the frozen Pole-starre stands,
From Desert south-seas sunburned breast.
4
They wandered in the Wilderness,
And took a solitary way,
Where soot of man did seldom press,
Nor found they City where to stay.
5
With hunger pined with thirsting faint,
Their anguish't soul was overcharged.
6
Then to the Lord they made complaint,
Who them from their distress enlarged.
7
He led them on, and brought them home,
The readiest way, for them the best;
(...) to a City they might come,
(...)tation where to rest.
8
Let them before the Lord confess
His tender mercies many a one,
To men his wondrous works express,
That he for Adams sons has done.
9
The thirsty soul he satiates,
The hungry soul with good sustaines,
10
That sits in darkness, at the gates,
And shade of death in iron chains,
11
Because, against the words of God,
They bent themselves rebelliously,
Despised his counsel, and withstood
The hand of him that is Most-Hie.
12
Thus humbled, for they did not well,
In grief of heart he let them lie,
Where down they fell, but helpless fell,
For refuge none, nor help was nie.
13
Distressed, unto the Lord they cried,
Who set them free from their distress:
14
From darkness, from deaths shade unti'd,
And brake their bands of heaviness.
15
Let them before the Lord confess
His tender mercies many a one,
To men his wondrous works express,
That he for Adams sons has done.
16
For he the gates of brass has broke,
The gates of brass against him bent;
And by his hands resistlesse stroke,
The iron bars in sunder rent.
17
Fools for their faults afflicted are,
Whose way has made their will their law:
18
Their soul abhorres all kind of fare,
Near to the gates of death they draw.
19
Distressed, unto the Lord they cry,
Who them from dying anguish saves:
20
He heales them by his words supply,
And frees them from corrupting graves.
21
Let them before the Lord confess
His tender mercies many a one,
To men his wondrous works express,
Which he for Adams sons has done.
22
Before him offerings let them lay,
Confessions of their thankfulness,
And sacrifice of praises pay,
His works with shouts of joy express.
23
They that in ships go down to sea,
And Marts in many waters keep:
24
What deeds the Lord has shown them, see
His works of wonder in the deep.
25
The stormy wind his word bespake,
That all the Maine with Mountains fills:
The sea-wet stars their mantles shake,
The brinie downs are turned to hills.
26
As high as Heaven the billows mount,
Dis-mounted, deep as hell descend:
Their melting soul makes small account,
But fear of death, in death to end.
27
Thus bandi'd to and fro they reele,
And stagger like a drunken man:
Ill may the Pilot rule the keele,
Where wisdoms care so little can.
28
Distressed, unto the Lord they cry,
Who sets them free from their distress:
29
The storm he calmes with cleerer sky,
And sets their waves at quietness.
30
The combat ceast, the seamen glad,
That winds and waves were parted friends,
He that of them the conduct had,
To their desired haven them sends.
31
Let them before the Lord confess
His tender mercies many a one,
To men his wondrous works express,
That he for Adams sons has done.
32
Assembled in the peoples throngs,
His worthy acts when they repeat,
With hymns of praise, and thankful songs,
Exalt him in the Elders seat.
33
Which turns the floods to desert sands.
To dryness draws the springing We^^:
34
With salt he sowes the fruitful lands,
For their misdeeds that therein dwell.
35
Again, he turns the desert dry,
To standing pooles with water filled:
36
And seats the hungry down thereby,
Where they to dwell a City build.
37
Their fields they sow, their vines they plant,
Which yield them fruits of fair increase.
38
Their Mines of wealth no blessings want,
Nor suffers he their herds decrease.
39
On them made less, and low brought down,
He makes restraint, and anguish prey:
40
On Princes leaves contempt to frown,
In Deserts lets them lose their way.
41
Yet raises he the poor man's head,
And makes him peopled households keep,
From selfe-waste want, with plenty fed,
For number like a flock of sheep.
42
Right-sighted eyes shall see this day,
The joy of all the righteous name,
And all iniquity shall lay
Her hand upon her mouth for shame.
43
Who so is wise, will take in hand
These observations to record:
And they shall truly understand
The tender mercies of the Lord.
PSALM. 108. Paratum cor. Canticum Psalmi David.
MY heart, O God, is ready pressed,
the glory of my tongue: --
My voice, the organ of my breast,
(...) praise shall be my song.
2
My Lute and Harp already strung,
my readier hand up take;
Before the dawning day have sprung,
I early will awake.
3
My thanks to thee, O Lord, will I
among the people bring;
And of thy praise in harmony,
with Q^ires of Nations sing.
4
For why? the Heavens are not so hie,
as is thy Mercy great:
Thy Truth a higher pitch does fly,
than in the clouds to seat.
5
Thy self, O God, in highest place,
above the Heavens enshrine;
And let the glory of thy face,
on earth, thy footstool, shine.
6
That free deliverance they may have,
that are beloved of thee:
With thy right hands assistance save,
O hear, and answer me.
7
God in his Holiness has spoke,
which I with joy repeat,
"In Shechem will I strike a stroke,
and Succoths Valley mete.
8
Mine Gilead is, Manasseh mine,
strength of my head does live,
In quiver-bearing Ephrams line;
my Law shall Judah give.
9
My wash-pot Moab will I make,
my shoe on Edom cast:
In triumph, thee Pelesheth, take,
triumph't on mine that have.
10
The City for defense so strong,
what guide will guide me to?
To Edoms warlike Towers along,
what leader with me go?
11
Not thou, O God, as naught of worth,
that have us cast away:
Nor with our hosts, O God, wentst forth,
upon the Battles day.
12
O give us help from our distress,
man's health is vain deceit:
Through God we shall do valiantness,
our foes he shall defeat.
PSALM. 109. Deus laudem. Ad Praestantem, Psalmus Davidis.
CEase not as deaf, God of my praise,
for wicked mouths consent:
2
Deceitful mouths their engines raise,
against me open bent.
3
With falsehoods tongue to me they speak,
and compass me with hate:
In bitter language forth they break,
and (causlesse) wage debate.
4
They for my friendship were my foes,
with whom by prayer I strove:
For good against me evil goes,
and hatred for my love.
5
His Ruler, some ungodly wretch,
set thou at his right hand:
6
Let Satan all advantage catch,
his adversary stand.
7
In Judgment let him not evade,
but go condemned therein;
And let his prayer for favor made,
be ^^rn'd to further sin.
8
His days a few and evil make,
determined in disgrace:
His office let another take,
a worthier hold his place.
9
His sons let fatherless be left,
his wife a widow poor:
10
His children of abode beref^,
beg bread from door to door.
11
Extortion tangle all his toil,
the Creditor ensnare:
His labor let the stranger spoil,
for lone, the lender share.
12
To pity him let there be none^
none mercy on him show:
His children father less, not one
with kind compassion know.
13
Of his posterity destroi'd,
let naught remain but shame;
And let the following age make void,
and clean put out his name.
14
Remembrance of his fathers crime,
the Lord before him lay:
His mothers sin at any time,
let not be wiped away.
15
Before the Lord continually,
in presence let them stand;
On earth let their memorial dye,
cut off by Gods own hand.
16
For mercy was not in his mind,
the poor he made his prey;
The needy soul he sought to grind,
the wounded heart to slay.
17
He loved cursing, let it light,
and him from blessing bar;
As blessing was not his delight,
be blessing from him far.
18
Of cursing, as his clothes were made,
so cursing be his spoil;
His bowels and his bones invade,
like water, and like oil.
19
About him folded let it fall,
him as a cloak enclose;
Or as the girdle, wherewithal
he always girded goes.
20
This be mine adversaries pay,
this from the Lord the stroke,
On them that evil any way
against my soul have spoke.
21
As thou, Lord God, for me have stood,
so for thy Names sake stand;
And for thy Mercy, ever good,
release me out of hand.
22
For poor afflicted I complain,
where no relief is found;
And stripes of sorrows silent pain,
my soul within me wound.
23
As shade, at setting Sun declined,
so I from life am gone;
And as the Locust, with the wind*
change place, but pain change none.
24
Through fasting feeble are my knees,
as lean as living ghost:
For cold my cramp-shrunk sinews freeze,
my flesh has fatness lost.
25
Reproaches foot upon me treads,
and blots my brow with shame;
While they that see me, shake their heads,
and make my grief their game.
26
Help, Lord my God, of thee I crave,
that helper else have none:
According to thy mercy save
thy poore-forsaken one.
27
And let them know, that this thy Arm,
that this thy hand alone,
Could help me more than they could harm,
that this, thou Lord, have done.
28
And let them curse, but do thou bless;
them rise, but rise to fall;
And that their fall their shame express,
rejoice thy servant shall.
29
Shame let mine adversaries bear,
such clothing as they spin;
And as a cloak, confusion wear,
the winding sheet of sin.
30
But to the Lord my mouth shall sing,
and greatly render thanks:
Shall make his highest praises ring,
in midst of many ranks.
31
Who at the poores right hand will stand,
and there his name enroule;
With his redeemed, out of the hand
of them that judge his soul.
PSALM. 110. Dixit Dominus. Psalmus Davidis.
THus to my Lord the Lord did say,
Thy seat upon my right hand take,
Until thine eyes behold the day,
That I thy foes thy footstool make.
2
The Lord shall out of Sion send
The Rod, that shall thy strength maintain,
The Scepter to thy hand commend,
Where thou amidst thy foes shall reign.
3
Thy voluntary people glad,
That to thy power all power shall stoop,
That day in holy beauties clad,
Shall march in thy triumphant troop.
Thee from the mornings womb I reared,
Thy youth with pearls of deaw beset,
Before the Star of light appeared,
I of my Substance did beget.
4
The Lord has sworn, and having sworn,
His oath shall no repentance check:
"Thou art a Priest for ever borne,
And ordered as Melchizedeck.
5
The Lord at thy right hand in arms,
Through Tyrans troops shall make thee way;
And stand between thee and thy harms,
To wound even Kings that wrathful day.
6
He shall be Judge among the Heath'n,
And strew the street with bodies dead:
With earth lay mighty Armies even,
Of many Nations smite the head.
7
The Brook that meets him by the way,
(His hot pursuit shall be so swift)
His thirst shall serve him to allay:
His head he therefore shall up-lift.
PSALM. III. Confitebor tibi, Domine. Acroflichon. Halelu-jah.
(...) ALl hearty praise, and hearts-complaints,
to thee, Lord, will I bring:
(...) Be (...) in secret with the Saints,
of in the Q^ire I sing.
(...) 2
Great are the actions of the Lord,
and greatly after sought:
(...) Desired of all, in whom his Word
a true delight has wrought.
(...) 3
His glory, and his honors praise,
his work all works obscures:
(...) Unto beyond the length of days,
his Justice firm endures.
(...) Sums of his marvels left to be
memorials on record:
(...) How full of clemency is he!
how merciful the Lord!
(...) 5
To them that fear him has his hand
an un-bought portion given:
(...) Is mindful with his Covenants band,
for ever to make even.
(...) 6
Conquests of power, proud Nations spoils,
he let his people see:
(...) Left them and theirs, of Heathen soiles
Inheritors to be.
(...) 7
Made all of Truth and Judgment are
the actions of his hands:
(...)No less as faithful, past compare,
are all his Precepts bands.
(...) 8
Set steadfast are they every one,
beyond the length of days:
(...) How truly, how sincerely done,
how upright in their ways.
(...) 9
Precovenanted Redemption came,
his people to restore:
(...) Sent in his holy dreadful Name,
(...) commanded evermore.
(...) 10
Right entrance, wisdoms ports into,
to fear the Lord first lay:
(...) So wisely do they all that do,
(...) their praise shall stand for aye.
PSALM. 112. Beatus Vir. Acroflichon. Halelu-jah.
(...) ALl blessings bless the man, that stands
of God the Lord in fear:
(...) But of delight in his commands,
of no delight can hear.
(...) 2
Grow mighty shall on earth his seed,
about his dwelling place.
(...) Daily shall blessings blessings breed,
to bless the righteous race.
(...) 3
His house of wealth and treasures heap't,
shall be a house of store:
(...) What with his Justice he has reap't,
shall stand for evermore.
(...) 4
Such light in darkness shall arise,
as lightens hearts upright:
(...) Him Grace and Mercy magnifies,
his lamp shall Justice light.
(...) 5
The good man graciously proceeds,
and bountifully lends:
(...) In sound advisement weighs his deeds,
his words with Judgment spends.
(...) 6
Certainly his foundations frame,
no adverse storm shall strain,
(...) Lasting for ever shall his Name
In memory remain.
(...) 7
Make him to fear the foul event,
none evil hearsay shall:
(...) Not so, his heart is fixed and bent,
^o trust the Lord withal.
(...) 8
Set steadfast holds his heart his hold,
from fear of peril free;
(...) His enemies to ruin sold,
till he in safety see.
(...) 9
Poor souls among his Alms are thrown,
(...) such Justice days and days
(...) Continue shall, by bounty grown,
his Horn shall honor raise.
(...) 10
Repining shall the wicked see,
this sight, and pallid ire
(...) Shall gnash the teeth, shall melted be
(...) to naught with his desire.
PSALM. 113. Laudate puer^. Halelu-jah.
PRaise, ye that serve the Lord, proclaim,
sing to the Lords Name praise:
2
Blessed be the Lords eternal Name,
beyond the length of days:
3
The Lords eternal Name be praised,
throughout this Sun-race Round;
From where the Eastern beams are raised,
to where the Western bound.
4
The Lord is high above the Heathens,
Commander in all lands:
His glory is above the Heavens,
and all their Host commands.
5
Who with the Lord our God compares,
whose dwelling is on hie?
And yet on Heaven and Earth he cares,
and daignes to cast his eye.
6
From dust the down-cast raised he takes,
from dung the needy cleeres:
The poor, with Princes Peers, he makes
his peoples Princes Peers.
7
He makes the barren dweller breed,
and house-build-issue bring:
A joyful mother of her seed,
her Halelu-jah sing.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 114. In exitu Israel.
WHen Israel out from Egypt went,
from Pharaohs heavy hand;
And Jacobs house from bondage sent,
had left that strange-tongu'd land.
2
His Sanctuary Judah led,
his Scepters Israel:
3
The sea that saw, gave way and fled,
and Jordan backward fell.
4
The Mountains leap't, like high-fed Rams
among the flocks of sheep:
The little Hills, like wanton Lambs,
like-wanton revells keep.
5
What ailed thee, O thou sea, to fly,
and leave thy coral bed?
That Jordan back thou turn'dst, and why
revolted to thy head?
6
Ye Mountains, that like Rams ye leap't
among the flocks of sheep?
Like Lambs, ye ravished Hillocks heap't,
like-raptur'd revells keep?
7
The presence of the Lord compelled,
the earth beyond her law:
Of Jacobs God the presence held
the trembling earth in awe.
8
Which from the veins of Rocks let blood,
his water-lakes does bring:
And makes into a mighty flood,
from flint the fountain spring.
PSALM. 115. Non nobis.
NOt unto us, Lord, not to us,
give glory to thy Name:
Proclaim it for thy Mercy thus,
thus for thy Truth proclaim.
2
And wherefore should the Heathens cry,
Where is their God forsooth?
3
Our God is in the Heavens most hie,
and what him pleases, does.
4
Their Idols silver are and gold,
whose melted mass they serve;
Work, which the hand of man does mold,
and curious is to carve.
5
A mouth they have, but speech none there,
and eyes, but casements blind:
6
And ears, but ears that cannot hear,
nor scent their noses wind.
7
Hands, where no sense of feeling found,
feet, that foot never went;
Their senseless trunkes at all no sound,
nor lungs, or throat to vent.
8
Like stuff to them their makers are,
like dross of diverse dust:
Like Saints, like Servitors compare,
are all that in them trust.
9
Trust in the Lord, O Israel,
on him their hopes who build,
Their hopes are sure to speed them well,
he is their help and shield.
10
Upon the Lord, O Aarons house,
your hopes foundation build,
Such hopes find him auspicious,
he is their help and shield.
11
O ye, in holy reverence,
to fear the Lord that yield,
In whom ye fear, put confidence,
he is their help and shield.
12
The Lord to us, remembering well
his blessing to express,
Will bless the house of Israel,
the house of Aaron bless.
13
Be ^t your state small means afford,
sit ye in honors seat;
Young, old, that fear the Lord, the Lord
will bless you, small and great.
14
To add to you, and to your race,
the Lord will yet proceed,
To multiply on you his grace,
on you, and on your seed.
15
The blessed of the Lord ye are,
his blessings ye partake:
Your Maker, he makes you his care,
that Heaven and Earth did make.
16
The Heavens, and Heavens supremest Heaven,
the Lord alone commands:
The Earth to Adams sons has given,
to serve him in all lands.
17
And though the dead, Lord, of thy praise,
no song in silence sing:
18
To praise thee Lord, shall endless days
our Halelu-jahs ring.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 116. Dilexi quoniam.
I Love the Lord, that so loved me,
my voice, my prayers to hear:
2
And in my days will call, for he
to me inclined his care.
3
The pangs of death did wind about,
and had beset me round:
The straights of Hell had found me out,
distress and grief, I found.
4
Upon the Lords Name then I called,
and ecchoing did repeat:
Deliver thou my soul enthralled,
O Lord, I thee entreat.
5
How gracious is the Lord, and just,
our God is merciful:
6
The Lord the simple keeps, from dust
my ransomed head did pull.
7
Soul, to thy rest return: for why?
the Lord has rendered thee,
8
My soul from death, from tears mine eye,
my feet from falling, free.
9
My walks before the Lord I make
the lands of them that live:
10
I did believe, and therefore spoke,
for greatly did I grieve.
11
I did, as fear and haste conceived,
"All men are liars, say:
12
For bounties from the Lord received,
what gift shall I repay?
13
Salvations cup will I up take,
and on the Lords Name call:
14
And of my vows now payment make,
before his people all.
15
His gracious Saints the Lord beholds,
his eyes high-prize their days:
Their death in dear account he holds,
and with revenge repaies.
16
Sure, Lord, I am thy servant, one
redeemed from hostile hands:
Thy servant I, thy handmaids son,
thou have unloos'd my bands.
17
A sacrifice of praise to thee
my thankful heart shall frame:
My sacrifice, O Lord, shall be
to call upon thy Name.
18
My vows I to the Lord will pay,
and put them off no more:
But on my hearts pure altar lay
his people all before.
19
Lord, in thy houses courts let me,
these vows upon me bring;
O Salem, in the midst of thee
mine Halelu-jah sing.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 117. Laudate Dominum.
O Praise the Lord, ye Gentiles all,
throughout the earth that dwell:
Upon his Name all Nations call,
his praise all people tell.
2
For toward us his Graciousnesse,
his Mercies mighty store;
And of the Lord the faithfulness,
endures for evermore.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 118. Confitemini Domino.
THe Lord is good, with thanks confess,
his mercy is for ever:
2
Let Israel now say no less,
his mercy fails never.
3
Now Aarons house acknowledge may
his mercy is for ever:
4
Let them that fear the Lord, now say,
his mercy fails never.
5
From where in straight distress I lay,
unto the Lord I cried:
The Lord made answer, with my way
about me made more wide.
6
The Lord for me, I fear not all
what man can do to me:
7
The Lord my helpers helps, I shall
upon my haters see.
8
The hopes that on the Lord are laid,
lie safer than on man:
9
Our hopes the Lord can better aid,
than powerful Princes can.
10
All Nations round about me came,
conspirers for my fall:
But in the Lords more-powerfull Name,
I shall cut off them all.
11
They pressed in swarms on every side,
on every side they swarmed:
But, Lord, thy Name my weapon tried,
to cut them off me armed.
12
Like swarms of Bees their forces linked,
they round about me bent:
Whom, Lord, like fire, in thorns extinct,
thy Name shall soon prevent.
13
That I might fall by some offense,
thou have thrust at me sore:
But yet, a hand in my defense,
the Lord my helper, bore.
14
The Lord is of my strength the sum,
the subject of my songs;
And my salvation is become,
to whom my life belongs.
15
The voice of joy and health is heard
in tents where Justice dwells:
The right hand of the Lord up-rear'd,
in fortitude excells.
16
The right hand of the Lord preferred,
pre-eminence has won;
The right hand of the Lord up-rear'd,
right valiant deeds has done.
17
Thy deeds in death, Lord, they that dwell,
to light have never brought,
I shall not die, but live to tell
what works the Lord has wrought.
18
Thy stripes, O Lord, I feel; some blood
thy chastisement did draw:
Yet has not given me up for food
to deaths devouring jaw.
19
The gates of Justice open me,
that I may enter there;
And there, O Lord, confess to thee,
that Saints thy praise may hear.
20
Of God the Lord this is the gate,
the Just shall enter there:
21
Where thee, my Savior, celebrate
will I, whom thou did hear.
22
The Stone the Builders did despise,
is made head cornerstone.
23
And mavelous is in our eyes
this that the Lord has done.
24
This day, the Lord that gave it light,
did unto us commend:
This Festival, from morn to night,
let joy and gladness spend.
25
Save now, O Lord, send happiness,
Hosanna now we sing:
Salvation, Lord, and good success;
Hosanna to our King.
26
Who in the Lords Name comes, Good-speed,
fair blessings him befall:
We, from the Lords House, whence proceed
all blessings, bless you all.
27
God is the Lord, that light affords,
has given us gladsome mornes:
The Host, for sacrifice, with cords
bind to the Altars horns.
28
Thou art my God, I will confess,
that have exalted me:
What then, my God, can I do less,
but thy Exalter be?
29
O praise the Lord, beyond all bounds,
whose goodness does extend:
Whose tender mercy farther sounds,
than time shall ever end.
PSALM. 119. Beati immaculati. Octostichon Acrostichon.
(...) ALl blessed they, in perfect way
that undefiled are found:
That of their walks, the steps to stay,
make (Lord) thy Law their bound.
(...) 2
All blessed they, that all their days,
and daily care convert,
To keep his Testimonies ways,
him seek with all their heart.
(...) 3
As no iniquity they do,
his ways their walking guide:
As steadfast in his paths they go,
then footing cannot slide.
(...) 4
All thy Commandments give command,
to do, as to discern:
To stand to, as to understand,
to live in, as to learn.
(...) 5
Assisted, O that by thy grace
directed were my ways;
So should my footsteps hold their place,
thy Statutes be my stays.
(...) 6
Abasht confusion should not fall,
nor shame on me reflect:
While unto thy Commandments all,
I had a due respect.
(...) 7
An upright heart will I prepare,
to make thy praise discerned,
What Judgments of thy Justice are,
when I have truly learned.
(...) 8
All my observance will I make,
thy Statutes how to keep:
O do not utterly forsake
thy wandering pasture-sheep.
BETH.
(...) BY what means may a young best,
be sure to cleanse his way:
But on thy says to set his rest,
thy Word his warrant lay?
(...) 2
Before all search, with all my heart,
as I have sought for thee;
So from thy Precepts paths depart,
and wander let not me.
(...) 3
Bound and laid up my heart within,
thy sayings have I hid:
Against thee that I might not sin,
nor do, as they forbid.
(...) 4
Beyond our blessings highest reach,
O Lord thou blessed art:
O teach me what thy Statutes teach,
their paths to me impart.
(...) 5
By utt'rance have my lips not spared,
their loudest notes to strain:
The Judgments of thy mouth declared,
made all their sentence plain.
(...) 6
Bent on thy Testimonies way,
much more did I rejoice,
Than they in store that riches lay,
the pride of all their choice.
(...) 7
Before all studies, early, late,
by setting all essays:
Thy Precepts will I meditate,
and well respect thy ways.
(...) 8
But in thy Statutes, no delight
where, else, my heart to set:
Because thy Says are so upright,
them shall I not forget.
GIMEL.
(...) GIve to thy servant this reward,
this favor me afford,
That living, though beset so hard,
I may observe thy Word.
(...) 2
Grown dark of sight, my veil withdraw,
the mysteries unfold,
That these mine eyes may of thy Law,
the wondrous things behold.
(...) 3
Great stranger I, and wanting light,
on earth in darkness stray:
Hide not thy Precepts from my sight,
the LYRE to lead my way.
(...) 4
Ground is my soul, and broken small,
enflamed is my desire:
At all times, mine affections all,
thy Judgments set on fire.
(...) 5
Given up, the proud do thou forsake,
whom though thy check defer;
The curse at length shall overtake,
that from thy Precepts err.
(...) 6
Grown in reproach, upon me crept,
^eld in contempt to be;
Thy Testimonies having kept,
O keep these shames from me.
(...) 7
Great Princes sat, and framed their style,
some fault with me to find:
But on thy Statutes all the while,
thy servant sets his mind.
(...) 8
Good cause, no other joy invites
my better-settled care:
Thy Testimonies my delights,
my men of counsel are.
DALETH.
(...) Down cast, and cleaving to the dust,
my soul draws near the death;
According as thy Word is just,
revive my dying breath.
(...) 2
Declared my ways to thee I have,
and answer had of thee:
Instruction only this, I crave,
thy Statutes teach thou me.
(...) 3
Direct me how to understand,
what way thy Precepts hold:
My Meditations, of thy hand
the wonders shall unfold.
(...) 4
Dejected soul, so much I grieve,
mine eyes drop showers of rain:
According to thy Word relieve,
and raise me up again.
(...) 5
Deceits false way from me withdraw,
put lying ways away;
And graciously give me thy Law,
to be my faithful stay.
(...) 6
Disposer of my feet, the way
of faithfulness I chose:
Thy Judgments I before me lay,
and for my guides propose.
(...) 7
Drawn from thy Testimonies now,
whereto I cleave so fast:
I cannot shrink; upon my brow,
Lord, let not shame be cast.
(...) 7
Directly in the way will I
of thy Commandments run:
Mine heart when thou shall amplify,
till grace the Goal have won.
HE.
(...) HOw! teach me, Lord, thy Statutes way,
the way to apprehend,
That make it all my care I may,
to keep it to the end.
(...) 2
Hide not my understandings light,
that I may keep thy Law:
From all delights shall this delight
mine hearts observance draw.
(...) 3
How I may tread thy Precepts path,
instruct me in the way:
For pleasure else mine heart none has,
no joy, but there to stay.
(...) 4
Hold in my heart, inclined to heed
thy Testimonies will;
And not on Avarice to feed,
still fed, yet famish't still.
(...) 5
Hence, hence mine eyes from pleasures hook,
un-tempted, turn away:
Lest after vanity they look,
revive me in thy way.
(...) 6
Here let thy Word performance bear,
to me thy servant past:
On whom, devoted to thy fear,
thy promised favor cast.
(...) 7
Hold off reproach, which in my way,
I am afraid has stood:
For say, what sinful tongues can say,
yet are thy Judgments good.
(...) 8
How to observe thy Precepts bounds,
lo, my delights aspire:
As Justice now in thee abounds,
O quicken my desire.
VAV.
(...) WIth thy kind Mercy come to me,
and be propitious, Lord,
O make me thy Salvation see,
according to thy Word.
(...) 2
What else to answer shall I have,
to mouths that me upbraid;
But that my trust, which they deprave,
upon thy Word is laid?
(...) 3
Withdraw not from my mouth this scope,
the Word of Truth to urge:
Because thy Judgments are my hope,
thy Truths contemners scourge.
(...) 4
Unto for ever in thy Law,
my life then will I spend;
And till this breath I cease to draw,
my service never end.
(...) 5
Within a spacious room forth brought,
shall I be walking found:
Because thy Precepts I have sought,
whereon my steps to ground.
(...) 6
Were Kings in presence, I would speak
thy Testimonies praise:
Nor shame to say, Yield Kingdoms weak,
stoop Scepters to his Says.
(...) 7
With thy Commandments, my delight
shall (all delights above)
Stand best delighted, in my sight
sole objects of my love.
(...) Up-lifted palms will I out-stretch,
thy Precepts to embrace;
And on thy Statutes, what they ^each,
my meditation place.
ZAIN.
(...) SUre promise to thy servant past,
as steadfast bear in mind:
That where my hopes thou settled have,
performance I may ^ind.
(...) 2
Sound comfort yet in this I take,
afflicted when I see,
All other succors me forsake,
thy saying quickens me.
(...) 3
Scorn did the proud, and much deride
this serious course of mine:
Yet from thy Precepts, for their pride,
my feet did not decline.
(...) 4
Such Judgments have thou done of old,
as when I call to mind,
My courage (Lord) grows then more bold,
and comfort thence I find.
(...) 5
Straight hold on me did horror take,
when wicked men I saw;
And seeing, soon I did forsake
forsakers of thy Law.
(...) 6
Songs have thy Statutes been to me,
whose Ditties I repeat;
And in this Dorter sing to thee,
my Pilgrimages seat.
(...) 7
Sitting in darkness of the night,
thy Name, when others slept,
Have I remembered: my delight,
thy Law (Lord) have I kept.
(...) 8
Success, what ever me befall,
these benefits I reap't:
This was to me, thy Precepts all,
because I duly kept.
HETH.
(...) HAve who that will such heaps up-laid,
as worldly wealth affords:
My Portion, Lord (as I have said)
is to observe thy words.
(...) 2
Heartily I besought thy face,
with earnest zeal I prayed:
And but performance of thy grace,
thy promised Mercy stayed.
(...) 3
Heedfully thought I on my ways,
what way I held most meet:
And to thy Testimonies stays,
I turned my staylesse feet.
(...) 4
Haste made I to avoid neglect,
to cut off all delay:
As thy Commandments shall direct,
to walk no other way.
(...) 5
Hindered by wicked robbers bands,
that make my goods their prey,
Yet have I not in safer hands,
thy Law forgot to lay.
(...) 6
How often at midnight do I rise,
to praise thee on my knees:
Because thy Judgments are the eyes,
wherewith thy Justice sees!
(...) 7
Hold all with me in friendships bands,
in fear of thee that stand:
Observers all of thy commands,
my service may command.
(...) 8
How far, O Lord, thy mercies reach,
when earth is filled thereby!
O teach me what thy Statutes teach,
to follow, what to fly.
TETH.
(...) THy promise stands for good, O Lord,
which thou thy self have bound:
The like performance of thy Word,
have I thy servant found.
(...) 2
To me let thy Instruction give
good Judgment, to discern:
As in thy Precepts I believe,
thence knowledge let me learn.
(...) 3
Till wise affliction crossed my way,
I held mine own accord:
My heart un-humbled, went astray,
but now I keep thy Word.
(...) 4
That thou art good, I find it still,
and to do good, inclined*
Thy Statutes learn me to fulfill;
this good, O let me find.
(...) 5
The proud against me forged a lie,
a falsehood for my fall:
But with mine heart entire do I
observe thy Precepts all.
(...) 6
Their peace and plenty them invite,
their heart is fat as grease:
But in thy Law is my delight,
my plenty, and my peace.
(...) 7
These faults are fruits of fairer days,
affliction did me good:
For thence I learn thy Statutes ways
are truly'st understood.
(...) 8
The Law that from thy mouth proceeds,
more good to me assigns;
And treasures more, than millions breeds
of gold and silver Mines.
JOD.
(...) Inspired, and fashioned by thy hand,
this spirit ere death withdrawes,
O make me made to understand,
that I may learn thy Laws.
(...) 2
In them that fear thee, when they see
what fruit my hopes afford:
Shall joy of heart join hopes with me,
that wait upon thy Word.
(...) 3
I know, O Lord (although severe)
thy Judgments are upright:
Thy faithfulnesses stripes I bear,
thy hand does justly smite.
(...) 4
In thy kind mercies free accord,
such comfort on me cast,
As to thy servant, on thy Word,
by promise is fore-past.
(...) 5
In tender mercies come to me,
and quicken up my spirits,
That I may live: revived by thee,
thy Law is my delights.
(...) 6
Infamous shame on them be laid,
that proudly me abuse:
That perversely my truth upbraid,
that on thy Precepts muse.
(...) 7
In holy fear such as are grown,
thy followers fit to be,
Thy Testimonies have they known,
let them return to me.
(...) 8
In thy Decrees, confirmed by thee,
O let my heart be sound,
And so my face, that all may see,
shall never shame confound.
CAPH.
(...) COncerning thy salvations stay,
my soul lies at receipt:
And fainting after long delay,
upon thy Word I wait.
(...) 2
Consumed, to see thy promise fail,
now, fail mine eyes to see:
O say, when shall thy Says prevail,
when come, to comfort me?
(...) 3
Clung, like a bottle in the smoke,
dried up, and waxen old:
Thy Statutes bounds I have not broke,
nor them forgot to hold.
(...) 4
Cast up thy servants sum of days,
how many are they all:
On them that persecute my ways,
when will thy Judgments fall?
(...) 5
Close have the proud for me dug pits,
my life from me to draw:
Where fraud with force in ambush sits,
which suits not with thy Law.
(...) 6
Commandments all thou giv'st are true,
in faithfulness agree:
With falsehood do they me pursue,
pursued, O rescue me.
(...) 7
Consumed on earth, but little less
than life from me they took:
Thy Precepts in this deep distress,
yet have I not forsook.
(...) 8
Call back my lives low-ebbing tide,
as Mercy flows from thee:
And, what thy mouth has testified,
shall be observed by me.
LAMED.
(...) LOng since before the Heavens were laid,
thy Word for ever sure;
In Heaven, than Heaven, more steadfast stayed,
(Eternal) shall endure.
(...) 2
Lasting thy Truth to Age and Age,
thy Word a faithful band:
The Earths foundations did thou gage,
and steadfast shall it stand.
(...) 3
Laws for their revolutions bounds,
are compast by thy care:
This day they stand thy Judgments grounds,
for all thy servants are.
(...) 4
Led not thy Law my whole delights,
with cares so many crossed,
In mine afflictions cloudy nights,
my comforts had been lost.
(...) 5
Let be, what ever be my let,
were strife it self that strived,
Thy Laws I never shall forget,
by them, by thee, revived.
(...) 6
Loose, leave me not, for I am thine,
save, but whom thou have bought:
For with this ransomed soul of mine,
thy Precepts have I sought.
(...) 7
Laid have for me the wicked wait,
to see my soul destroi'd:
But on thy Testimonies weight,
my studies were emploi'd.
(...) 8
Lost in themselves Perfections all,
mine eyes have seen to end:
But thy Commandments (sums though small)
exceeding broad extend.
MEM.
(...) MY souls sole object, motive strong,
Lord, how I love thy Law!
My Meditation all day long,
the lodestone to withdraw.
(...) 2
Much wiser than mine enemies,
thy Precepts I fulfill;
And thou by them have made me wise,
for they are with me still.
(...) 3
More than my Teachers am I taught,
a higher skill to reach:
Thy Testimonies are my thought,
my Teachers thus I teach.
(...) 4
Much deeper wisdom have I found,
than Ages shallow deep:
The Elders are not so profound,
while I thy Precepts keep.
(...) 5
My feet from every evil way,
for this have I refrained:
That from the Rules I might not stray,
within thy Word contained.
(...) 6
My Judgment thine has not declined,
to ponder in my thought:
To practice what I bear in mind,
to do, as thou have taught.
(...) 7
Much sweetness in thy words thou have,
to slake my pallat's drougth;
More pleasant in my throat they taste,
than honey in my mouth.
(...) 8
Minding thy Precepts for my stay,
I understanding get:
And therefore hate I every way
that falsehood has fore-set.
NVN.
(...) NOw, dangers where on earth I meet,
and darksome shades of night:
Thy Word a lantern to my feet,
and to my path gives light.
(...) 2
Now I have sworn, perform I will,
at no time to neglect,
Thy righteous Judgments to fulfill,
as Justice shall direct.
(...) 3
No mean in mine affliction, Lord,
now over-worne with woe:
O quicken me, as by thy Word
thou have assured to do.
(...) 4
None but free-offrings in good part,
Lord, from my mouth accept;
And teach me how within my heart,
thy Judgments may be kept.
(...) 5
No day my soul but in my hand,
with deadly snares beset,
To do, as does thy Law command,
yet do I not forget.
(...) 6
Near to my way, at unawares,
the wicked laid their snare:
Yet careless I of other cares,
thy Precepts made my care.
(...) None but thy Testimonies took
for mine Inheritance:
For ever, as on them I look,
mine heart for joy does dance.
(...) 8
No days but in thy Laws to spend,
till life from me depart;
And to perform them to the end,
have I inclined my heart.
SAMECH.
(...) SEducers vain my hatred move,
my heart from them to draw:
But as I love thy Law, I love
observance of thy Law.
(...) 2
Secret thou art to me, and shield,
to keep thy promise, just:
To thee my hopes their service yield,
and to thy Word I trust.
(...) 3
Such as in evil ways have trod,
my paths approach not me:
To keep the Precepts of my God,
while I mine heart apply.
(...) 4
Sustain thou me, that I may live,
to make thy promise good:
Let not my hopes made frustrate, give
my head a shameful hood.
(...) 5
Secure my health, I shall be bold
of safety in thy sight;
And in chief price continual hold
thy Statutes my delight.
(...) 6
Such fugitives thou tread'st down all,
as from thy Statutes stray:
Deceitfully from thee they fall,
for falsehood is their way.
(...) 7
So from the earth the wicked are
as dross by thee removed:
I therefore have with purer care
thy Testimonies loved.
(...) 8
Such horror in my flesh for thee,
to feel I am afraid:
And so severe thy Judgments be,
that I am sore dismi^'d.
GNAIIN.
(...) HAve Judgment I, and Justice done,
unjustly judged to stand!
O let me not be over-gone
by mine oppressors hand.
(...) 2
Hold surety for thy servants good,
become sufficient bail;
And let not mine oppressors proud,
to my reproach prevail.
(...) 3
Have not mine eyes bid many a storm,
for thy Salvation worn;
And when thy Justice would perform
thy promise long forborne?
(...) 4
Hold on, in mercy to proceed,
so with thy servant deal:
That what thy Statutes have decreed,
to me thou may reveal.
(...) 5
Here I thy servant, make me sound
in understanding grow;
And on thy Testimonies ground,
my grain of knowledge sow.
(...) 6
High time is, Lord, they be destroi'd,
thy vengefull sword to draw,
To make their lawless labors void,
that have made void thy Law.
(...) 7
How precious I thy Precepts hold,
and therefore love them more
Than gold, above the finest gold,
tried from the richest Ore.
(...) 8
How I esteem thy Precepts right,
that always truth relate!
And I, that in the truth delight,
always of falsehood hate.
PE.
(...) PRofound, and marvellously deep
thy Testimonies are:
Them, as they well deserve to keep,
my soul has therefore care.
(...) 2
Port-open'd of thy words gives light,
gives light that ever lives;
And understandings piercing sight,
to simpl^ people gives.
(...) 3
Panting with open mouth, a draught
I thirsted sore to prove;
And made the Precepts thou had taught,
the wine press of my love.
(...) 4
Proceed, but so, as Mercies eye
in Judgment me behold,
With those, that on thy Names supply,
by love have taken hold.
(...) 5
Put in thy Word, my steps direct,
and place them every where,
That never wickedness deject,
nor rule above me bear.
(...) 6
Protect me from oppressing man,
for my redemption pay,
That do what earthly pressure can,
thy Precepts keep I may.
(...) 7
Procure thy countenances light,
on me thy servant shine;
And in thy Statutes lesson right
these tutored steps of mine.
(...) 8
Powered out in grief that drowns mine eyes,
my tears like rivers flow*
Thy Law when men I see despise,
and in contempt to grow.
TSADE.
(...) SO just thou Lord art in thy deeds,
thy promise to acquit:
To sentence when thy mouth proceeds,
then are thy Judgments right.
(...) 2
Such charge thy Testimonies charge,
that Justice should attend;
Thy promises performed at large,
thy faithfulness commend.
(...) 3
Surpised I was with burning zeal,
that on my bosom preys:
That my distressors so should deal,
as to forget thy Says.
(...) 4
So pure thy Word, as much resin'd
the metal tried by fire:
And thereupon thy servants mind,
has set his hearts desire.
(...) 5
Small am I much, and much despised,
as much affect I not:
With me thy Precepts highly prized,
so have I not forgot.
(...) 6
Such Justice is thy Justice tried,
as evermore remains,
A righteous and a faithful guide,
thy Law the Truth contains.
(...) 7
Straitness and anguish found my spirits,
fast hold on me to get:
Yet are thy Precepts those delights,
whereon my heart is set.
(...) 8
Such Justice, such eternal Right
thy Testimonies give:
O give me understandings light,
that I may learn to live.
COPH.
(...) CRying, with heart entire I cried,
hear, Lord, and answer make:
To keep thy Statutes for my guide,
then will I undertake.
(...) 2
Calling upon thee, did I call,
from dangers deepest deep;
Be thou my Savior, and I shall
thy Testimonies keep.
(...) 3
Crying, the twilight I prevent,
my call called up the day:
To wait on thee was mine intent,
upon thy Word to stay.
(...) 4
Could any eyes by watching late,
like watch to mine have kept,
Upon thy Word to meditate,
that wak't, when others slept?
(...) 5
Can thy great mercies ear less do,
than hear my voice complain?
Thy Judgment, Lord, according to,
O quicken me again.
(...) 6
Close-follow'd by a wicked crew,
how near to me they draw!
In mischief they that me pursue,
are far off from thy Law.
(...) 7
Can duty, can default be done,
but thou, O Lord, art near?
Truth are thy Precepts every one,
all thy Commandments clear.
(...) 8
Continued are (I know) of old
thy Testimonies says:
That thou have founded them to hold
beyond the length of days.
RESH.
(...) REgard what pressures I sustain,
weigh, and their weight withdraw;
Release me, that for all my pain,
have not forgot thy Law.
(...) 2
Right thou my cause that comes to thee,
oppressed and hard withstood:
Redeem thou me, and quicken me,
to make thy saying good.
(...) 3
Removed is from the wicked far
Salvation, them she flies,
That with thy Statutes, tongues to jarre,
to seek them, have no eyes.
(...) 4
Repeat thy many mercies great,
how can thou them refrain?
Thy wonted Judgments, Lord, repeat,
to quicken me again.
(...) 5
Ready my Persecutors are,
oppressors many mine;
Drawn from thy Testimonies care,
yet did I not decline.
(...) 6
Revolting sinners how I saw,
I sorrow to record;
How perversely they break thy Law,
and have not kept thy Word.
(...) 7
Respect thy Precepts how I love,
to quicken zeales desire:
Let, Lord, thy loving kindness prove,
thy mercy blow the fire.
(...) 8
Right entrance to thy Word, truth gives,
and endless as it grows,
For ever every Judgment lives,
that from thy Justice flows.
SCHIN.
(...) SUppressors of my harmless head,
together Princes draw:
But of thy Word than of their deed,
my heart stands more in awe.
(...) 2
So much thy Word is my delight,
as after care and toil,
When from the vanquished foe in flight,
the Victor bears the spoil.
(...) 3
Sworn foe I am professed to fraud,
and falsehood I detest;
Yet does my love thy Law applaud,
and there sets up my rest.
(...) 4
Seven times, ere one days Sun descend,
to praise thee forth I break,
Thy righteous Judgments to commend,
and of their Justice speak.
(...) 4
Such peace is given in recompense,
to them that love thy Law:
No stumbling-blocke shall give offense,
no danger them withdraw.
(...) 6
Salvation, Lord, my hope attends,
for thine attends alone;
And dreadlesse of distrustful ends,
thy Precepts have I done.
(...) 7
Safe in my soul, my souls delight,
thy Testimonies lie;
And them have I observed aright,
and loved exceedingly.
(...) 8
Strictly thy Laws are kept by me,
and Testimonies thine:
To thee no ways can ever be
(I know) unknown of mine.
THAV.
(...) TO thee let my complaint come near,
and lie before thee, Lord:
O give me understanding clear,
according to thy Word.
(...) 2
The supplication in thy sight,
that I prefer, accept;
And let thy promise be upright,
in my deliverance kept.
(...) 3
Then as a fountains fluent spring,
my lips shall utter praise,
My tutored steps when thou shall bring,
to walk thy Statutes ways.
(...) 4
Then of thy Word my tongue shall sound
a Psalm, that shall entreat:
For just are all thy Precepts found,
as Justice is their seat.
(...) 5
To help me let thy hand prevail,
when perils me oppose:
For (leaving other helps that fail)
thy Precepts have I chose.
(...) 6
To have of thy Salvation sight,
Lord, I have longed full sore;
And in thy Law so I delight,
I shall desire no more.
(...) 7
Then let my soul but live so long,
this ground till I have laid,
To make thy praise fill up my song,
to get thy Judgments aid.
(...) 8
Thy wandering servant gone astray,
as shepherd, his lost sheep,
O seek, so mindful in thy way,
thy Precepts pressed to keep.
PSALM. 120. Ad Dominum, cum tribul. Canticum Graduum.
IN my distresses anguish,
When I did lie and languish,
Upon the Lord I called:
No longer he deferred me,
But at mine instance heard me,
From where I lay enthralled.
2
My soul, O Lord, deliver
From lips of lies the quiver,
And from a double tongue:
3
False tongue, what gives it to thee?
What profit shall it do thee,
When thy fell sting has stung?
4
Sharp arrows are less cruel,
No Juniper, like fuel:
So deadly are they not,
As are those forked quarrels,
As are those wildfire barrells,
The tongues malignant shot.
5
Now, woe is me, these dangers,
More strange to me then strangers,
That exiled life re-sents:
Against my will constrain me,
With Meshech to contain me,
And dwell in Kedars Tents.
6
My soul has too long resting,
With him, that peace detesting,
Is ever malcontent:
I am for peace, that love it,
And when my speeches move it,
for war then are they bent.
PSALM. 121. Levavi oculos. Canticum Graduum.
UP to the Hills I lift mine eyes,
from whence will come mine aid:
2
From, with the Lord come my supplies,
which Heavens and Earth has laid.
3
He will not suffer thee to slide,
thy foot to tread awry:
He will not give, that slumber hide
thy keepers wakefull eye.
4
Lo, him that keeps Israel,
shall Isreal's keeper keep,
That on his eye no slumber dwell,
his eyelid lodge no sleep.
5
The Lord, the Lord thy keeper is,
his helpe's at thy right hand,
To shade thee, spread those wings of his,
to lead thee, ready stand.
6
So thee, with scorching heat by day,
the Sunbeams shall not smite;
Nor shall the Moon thy vigor slay,
with vapors of the night.
7
The Lord shall thy preserver be,
that thou no evil have;
And keep thy soul, that over thee
no sting be in the grave.
8
Yea, go thou out, or come thou in,
the Lord shall keep the door;
Be with thee from thou do begin,
protect thee evermore.
PSALM. 122. Laetatus sum. Canticum Graduum Davidis.
IT was my joy, amidst our woe,
to hear the people say:
When to the Lords House we shall go,
O times too long delay!
2
Our feet, in our oppressed estates,
which press a stranger land,
As heretofore within thy gates,
to see (O Salem) stand.
3
Jerusalem is so exact,
a City of such site:
Her stately structures so compact,
her to her self unite.
4
And thither do the Tribes frequent,
Tribes of the Lord ascend,
To Isreal's TESTIMONY sent,
the Lords Name to commend.
5
There are the Thrones for Judgment set,
Thrones, where that Royal seed,
The sons that David shall beget,
for ever shall succeed.
6
O pray we for Jerusalem,
her quiet may increase:
And may fair peace as well love them,
that love fair Salems peace.
6
Within thy walls let peace be still,
and trusty Warder stand*
Thy palaces let plenty fill,
with prosper-making hand.
8
My brethren and companion^ loves,
compassion move in me:
Compassion like condition moves,
now speak I peace to thee.
9
And seeing Salems Temple here,
where Sion-Mount I see;
This House the Lord our God holds dear,
I will seek good to thee.
PSALM. 123. Ad te levavi. Canticum Graduum.
TO thee, that sitt'st above the skies,
that Heavens in-dweller art,
I lift up my submissive eyes,
from valleys of my heart.
2
Lo, as upon their Masters hand,
the servants eyes depend:
As on her Mistresses command,
a maidens eyes attend;
Upon the Lord our God our eyes,
so waiting are intent,
Until his Graces free supplies,
in Mercy us prevent.
3
In Mercy, us (O Lord) exempt,
thy Mercy make appear:
For we are filled with much contempt,
more than our hearts can bear.
4
Our soul is cloi'd above the crown,
we bear beyond our might:
With scorn the wealthy weigh us down;
the proud, with high despite.
PSALM. 124. Nisi quia Dominus. Canticum Graduum Davidis.
EXcept the Lord for us had been,
may Israel now say:
2
Had not the Lord their pride foreseen,
whose powers against us lay:
3
Then had they swallowed us alive,
when kindled was their rage,
In vain had been for us to strive,
their fury to assuage.
4
The floods had drowned us every one,
so fiercely did they flow:
Above our soul the surge had gone,
so mighty did it grow.
5
We had been covered in this cloud,
the waters proud-controule,
The swelling waters of the proud
had over-gone our soul.
6
Blessed be the Lord, that them withstood,
and frustrate sent away;
That has not given our guiltless blood
unto their teeth a prey.
7
Our soul is as a bird escaped
out of the Fowlers snare:
The snare is broke that us entrap't,
and we delivered are.
8
The help, whereon our hopes depend,
is in the Eternals Name:
He that our help to us does send,
the Heavens and Earth did frame.
PSALM. 125. Qui confidunt. Canticum Graduum.
Whosoever commend their trust approved,
unto the Lords command,
Shall, as Mount Sion, not be moved,
but fast for ever stand.
2
Jerusalem is walled with Hills,
so bounds the Lord his ground;
And evermore the Compass fills,
about his people round.
3
For wickednesses rod shall not
upon the Just abutt;
Lest thence to draw a wicked lot,
the Just their hands forth put.
4
As all good gifts thou do confer,
Lord, to the good do good;
And, righteous as thou art, prefer
the upright-hearted brood.
5
But such, as to their crooked vain
revolt, the Lord shall lead,
With them that evil work with pain:
"Peace be on Isreal's head.
PSALM. 126. In convertendo. Canticum Graduum.
WHen Sion (Babels captive) thence
the Lord did home redeem:
Our ravished hopes, scarce trusting sense,
we were like them that dream.
2
Our mouth was filled with laughter, then
for joy no tongue but sings:
The Heath'ns could say, for these good men
the Lord has done great things.
3
Great things indeed, and many too,
for us, as well appears;
The Lord has magnified, to do,
to joy has turned our tears.
4
Turn, Lord, as welcome showers of rain,
refresh the Deserts drouth;
Our captive Remnant turn again,
like Torrents from the South.
5
They that in furrows filled with tears,
the seed of sorrow sow,
When Harvest comes of laden ears,
a joyful crop shall mow.
6
He going goes, and weeps to see,
what deere-bought seed he leaves:
Home-comming comes, as joyful he,
and (shouting) bears his sheaves.
PSALM. 127. Nisi Dominus. Canticum Graduum Solomonis.
EXcept the Lord the house do build,
vain toil the builder takes:
Except the Lord the City shield,
in vain the Warder wakes.
2
As vain it is, ye early rise,
late hours of rest ye keep,
To eat the bread that sorrow buys,
while his beloved sleep.
3
Lo, children are an heritage,
a gift the Lord bestows:
Fruit that revives the fathers age,
rewards the mothers throws.
4
The arrows from the Mighties hand,
with no such terror go,
As go the sons of youth, to stand
against the fathers foe.
5
Blessed is the man, that of such shot
has stored his quiver full;
Within the gate, their foes shall not
reproach upon them pull.
PSALM. 128. Beati omnes qui. Canticum Graduum.
ALl happiness, who ever thou art,
attend upon thy days,
To fear the Lord that fram'st thy heart,
thy feet, to walk his ways.
2
The labor of thy hands, thy mess
of savoury meat shall be:
Thee, and thy dwelling place to bless,
shall goodness dwell with thee.
3
Thy wise, as spreads the fruitful Vine,
thy houses sides shall bound:
Thy sons, like Olive-plants, shall twine
about thy Table round.
4
These blessings lo, and many more,
this life shall here afford;
And better far there are in store,
for them that fear the Lord.
5
Such happiness the Lord to thee
shall out of Sion give:
The God of Salem shall thou see,
while thou have day to live.
6
And ended ere thy days shall be,
thy seed to prosper well:
Thy childrens children shall thou see,
and peace on Israel.
PSALM. 129. Saepe expugnaverunt. Canticum Graduum.
AGainst me my distressors power
has done the worst they may:
From since my youth began to flower,
may Israel now say:
2
Afflictions on my head to sling,
full often have they assailed,
Against me, from my youthful spring,
yet have they not prevailed.
3
The plowers plowed upon my back,
and made their furrows long:
4
The Lord the Just, yet cut the Rock
the wicked made so strong.
5
Let soul confusion on them light,
and send them back with shame,
That look at Sion in despite,
as haters of her Name.
6
Let them be as the grass that grows,
upon the houses top:
Which withreth ere the sith it mowes,
and leaves an empty crop.
7
Whose seed un-rooted in the land,
is fed with fruitless sap;
Which neither fills the mowers hand,
nor lades the binders lap.
8
So as no passer by shall say,
The Lord give good success:
The Name of God the Lord (we pray)
you and your labor bless.
PSALM. 130. De profundis. Cantic^m Graduum.
OUt of the deeps that thou may hear,
Lord, my complaints repair:
2
Lord, hear my voice, and let thine ear
attend my voices prayer.
3
Our sins if thou, O Lord, should sum,
and mark, where we have miss't:
When thy revengefull stroke shall come,
who, Lord, shall then subsist?
4
But by forgiveness of our sin,
thy mercy has appeared:
And, as our love thy Judgments win,
thy mercy makes thee feared.
5
I earnestly expect the Lord,
expect his promise just:
My soul has waited for his Word,
wherein my hopes put trust.
6
My soul upon the Lord depends,
attends for her dispatch;
More than for morn the watch attends,
more than for morn the watch.
7
With confidence let Israel,
attend the Lord therefore:
For with the Lord does Mercy dwell,
with him redemption store.
8
And Israel redeem he shall,
and make him freedom win,
From all his sorrows bonds, from all
his sorrow-breeding sin.
PSALM. 131. Domine non est. Canticum Graduum Davidis.
A Haughty heart, high-looking eyes,
O Lord, I never brook:
I wade not in deep mysteries,
nor after marvells look.
2
I stilled my soul, and made it mild,
as from the mothers breasts,
A weanling, as a weanling child,
my soul in silence rests.
Trust in the Lord, his time attend,
O Jacobs family:
Attend his time, that has no end,
from now, eternally.
PSALM. 132. Memento, Domine. Canticum Graduum.
OF David, and his troublous days,
be mindful, Lord, and how
2
To Jacobs mighty Lord he pays
his oaths solemnized vow.
3
Nor tent, nor house, my harbor be,
repose my bed forbids:
4
To sleep, mine eyes shall pardon me,
to slumber, mine eyelids.
5
Until a dwelling place I find,
where may the Lord remain,
The Mighty One of Jacobs kind,
a house to entertain.
6
Lo^, Ephrata we understood,
thereof good tidings yields:
At length, we found it in the wood,
in Kirjath-jears fields.
7
Within his house we will go meet,
and there assembled all;
Before his ^oot-stoole, at his feet
bow down our selves, and fall.
8
Arise, O Lord, into thy rest
return, to dwell at length;
In Salem, sometime Silo's guest,
thou, and thy Arc of strength.
9
Let be (that thine they may be known)
thy Priests with Justice clothed:
And (seeking thee more than their own)
thy Saints to joy betrothed.
10
And for thy servant David's sake,
turn not the face away
Of thine Anointed: Sovereigns make
his seed, his Scepter sway.
11
The Lord in Truth to David swear,
and will not turn from it:
Fruit of thy womb will I prepare
upon thy Throne to sit.
12
My Covenant if thy sons retain,
my Testimonies heed;
Thy sons perpetually shall reign,
and on thy Throne succeed.
13
For as the Lord loves Sion best,
his liking is so great,
That her, he has above the rest,
selected for his seat.
14
This is my rest, a longer space,
than Sun shall lend his light,
Perpetual here my dwelling place,
here my desired delight.
15
Her victuals blessing will I bless,
her poor with bread suffice:
16
Her Priests in pure Salvation dress,
her Saints shall joy surprise.
17
There will I make the Horn upright,
to bud on David's head:
A lamp for mine Anointed light,
throughout all lands to spread.
18
His enemies shall shame befall,
and weave the web they wear:
Up on his head while flourish shall
the Crown that he shall bear.
PSALM. 133. Ecce quam bonum. Canticum Graduum Davidis.
BEhold how good it is, how pleasing well,
that there dwell unity, where Brethren dwell:
2
The precious odor did not sweeter smell,
When on the head, the holy Oil that fell,
As down the beard, down Aarons beard it went,
Perfumed the border of his Vestiment*
3
So fall the pearly gems from Hermon H^ll,
On Sion Mountains so the deaws distill;
And eithers fields with rich embroidry fill,
Powdring the'r un-shorne locks with various skill:
For there, the Lords command the blessing bound,
And Brethrens love with life eternal crowned.
PSALM. 134. Ecce nunc benedicite. Canticum Graduum.
BEhold, praise ye the Lord all ye,
observers of his Rites,
That servants in the Lords House be,
before him stand by nights.
2
There, where his Sanctuary stands,
to sanctify his Name:
To bless the Lord, up-lifted hands,
let hearts low-humbled frame.
3
And he, whose blessings over-shade
the Hill of Holiness:
The Lord, that Heavens and earth has made,
thee out of Sion bless.
PSALM. 135. Laudate nomen Domini. Halelu-jah.
SIng Halelu-jah, praise the Eternals Name,
Ye servants of the Lord, set forth his praise:
2
That to the Lords House stand, his praise proclaim,
In our Gods Houses Courts that spend your days.
3
Praise JAH: The Lord is good, as then is meet,
Sing Psalms unto his Name, so pleasing sweet,
4
For to himself the Lord has Jacob chose,
And his chief treasure Israel accounts.
5
Great is the Lord, my knowledge can disclose:
And that our Lord all other gods surmounts.
6
What will the Lord have done: his will alone
In Heavens, Earth, Seas, and all the Deeps is done.
7
From earths extremes he makes the clouds ascend,
His fires and waters on the air he flings;
In lightning-shot, and showers of rain to spend,
The wind out of his treasuries he brings:
8
And branded Egypt bare his furies note,
Whose firstborn all, from man to beast he smote.
9
His signs and wonders here and there he sent,
Hard hearted Egypt, in the midst of thee,
On Pharaoh's head, and all his servants spent:
Yet who so blind, as they that would not see:
His signs and wonders, sent and spent in vain,
Nor Pharaoh's nor his servants pride restrain.
10
He smote great Nations, mighty Kings he slew.
11
As Heshbons Sehon, King of Amorites;
And Ghog the King of Bashan overthrew,
With all the Kingdoms of the Cananites!
12
And dispossessed them of their land, to bless,
And give his people Israel to possess.
13
Thy Name, O Lord, is ever permanent,
Thy memory, Lord, is to age and age:
14
The Lord will judge his people, and repent
To execute the rigor of his rage:
His servants faults as ready to forbear,
As to their foes in his revenge severe.
15
The Heathens Idols silver are and gold,
Work of man's hand, their makers worth beneath;
16
Mouths, eyes, ears, noses, can their makers mold;
17
But cannot make them speak, see, hear, nor breathe:
18
Vain Idoll-mongers, like your Idols just,
That Idols make, or in made Idols trust.
19
O bless the Lord ye house of Israel,
O bless the Lord, ye house of Aarons line:
20
O house of Levi* bless the Lord: As well
Who fear the Lord, to bless the Lord incline:
21
From out of Sion his high praise record,
Whose dwelling is in Salem: Praise the Lord.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 136. Confitemini Domino.
O Praise the Lord, for he is good,
his mercy is for ever:
2
Praise him, that is of gods the God,
whose mercy fails never.
3
Praise him, that is of lords the Lord,
whose mercy is for ever:
4
His sole done wonders great, record,
whose mercy fails never.
5
The Heavens, that by his wisdom made,
whose mercy is for ever:
6
The earth above the waters spread,
his mercy cease never.
7
Which made great lights for several place,
his mercy is for ever:
8
The Sun by day to run his race,
his mercy failing never.
9
The Moon and Stars to govern night,
his mercy lasting ever:
10
In their firstborn did Egypt smite,
his mercy failing never.
11
And Israel from amidst them brought,
his mercy is for ever:
12
With mighty hand, and arm out-rought,
his mercy failing never.
13
The red sea into parts did lay,
his mercy is for ever:
14
And through the midst made Israel way,
his mercy failing never.
15
There shook off Pharaoh and his Host,
his mercy lasting ever:
16
His people led through Desert-coast,
his mercy failing never.
17
Great Kings he smote, and overthrew,
his mercy is for ever:
18
And mighty Kings in battle slew,
his mercy failing never.
19
As Sehon King of Amorites,
his mercy lasting ever:
20
And Ghog the King of Basanites,
his mercy ceasing never.
21
Their land in heritage to have,
his mercy is for ever:
22
To Israel his servant gave,
his mercy failing never.
23
Which of our humbled state esteemed,
his mercy is for ever:
24
From our distressors us redeemed,
his mercy failing never.
25
Bread to all flesh by whom is given,
his mercy lasting ever:
26
Confess ye to the God of Heaven,
whose mercy cease never.
PSALM. 137. Super flumina Babyl.
Down sat we by the rivers side,
that waters Babels wall:
To raise whose streams, a springing tide
of tears our eyes let fall.
Remembering Sion in our vows,
our useless Harps we hung
2
Upon amidst the willow boughs,
as slightly tuned as strung.
3
For they that led us captives there,
required of us a song;
A Sion-song (said) let us hear,
these moanes, some mirth among.
4
O no! nor harp we have, nor hand,
nor voice to strain, nor string:
Our Sion-song, in Shinar-land,
song of the Lord to sing.
5
If, O Jerusalem, I set
no more by thee than so;
Let my right hand her skill forget,
my voice her song forgo.
6
My tongue fast to my palate cling,
and never tune employ,
If ought I do but Salem sing,
the Sovereign of my joy.
7
Be mindful, Lord, of Edoms sons,
who said on Salems day,
Raze, Raze, to her foundations,
with earth her level lay.
8
Thou Daughter, Babel, laidst us waste,
thy self shall wasted be:
O happy! that as done thou have
to us, shall do to thee.
9
O happy! that thy little ones,
from mothers breasts shall rash*
And (pitilesse) against the stones,
their brains in pieces dash.
PSALM. 138. Consitebor tibi. Davidis.
I Will confess thee to their face,
with all the heart in me,
Were Princes, Angels, Gods in place,
Psalms will I sing to thee.
2
Prostrate before thy holy Seat,
thy Name will I confess;
Thy tender mercies there repeat,
and sing thy faithfulness.
For all thy powerful deeds proclaim,
and ample proof afford,
That thou have magnified thy Name,
above all Name thy Word!
3
The day I cried, to thee I cried,
thou heardst, and answerdst me:
My soul with vigor was supplied,
and strengthened much by thee.
4
Kings of the earth shall all confess,
and make thy praise appear;
When of thy mouth, the faithfulness,
the words (O Lord) they hear.
5
Their songs shall of the ways entreat,
that to the Lord belong:
For of the Lord the glory great,
is subject of their song.
6
For though the Lord be throned on hie,
yet are his eyes below:
The lowly-hearted ever nie,
the proud afar to know.
7
Amidst distress although I went,
revived by thee I stand:
Thy hand against my haters sent,
to save me, thy right hand.
8
This work, the hand that wrought me this,
the Lord accomplish will:
Thy mercy, Lord, for ever is,
thy handy-worke fulfill.
PSALM. 139. Domine, probisti. Ad Praestantem, Davidis Psalmus.
THou have, O Lord, me searched out and known,
2
My sitting down, and my up-rising are
Within thy knowledge, cleerer than mine own:
My thoughts un-thought, thou understandst afar,
3
My path, my pallet, winnow'd with thy fan,
And all my ways thy custom is to scan.
4
For in my tongue there teem's not any word,
The breathless infant of my pregnant thought*
Bucloe, un-borne, thou know it wholly, Lord,
Though with the organs of my speech un-wrought:
5
Behind, before, thou have beset me straight,
And of thy hand upon me put the weight.
6
It is too wonderful for me to know,
To it^ cannot it is set so hie:
7
O, from thy spirit whither shall I go?
And whither shall I from thy presence fly?
8
If I ascend the Heavens, the Heavens thee bear;
Make I my bed the Hell, lo thou art there.
9
Take I the early-rising mornings wings,
And utmost seas my uncouth dwelling make,
10
Even thither me thy hand my leader brings,
And thy right hand fast hold on me shall take:
11
Yet sure shall darkness shroud me, if I say,
The night about me shall be light as day.
12
For light-lesse darkness, darkneth not from thee,
But as the day, before thee shines the night:
Where seeing sees not, thou have eyes to see,
As darkness is to thee, so is the light.
13
My reins are but the texture of thy loome.
Thou coveredst me within my mothers womb.
14
For casting me in such a covert mold,
My praise shall of thy fearful wonders tell;
How mavelous thy works are to behold,
My soul cannot express, yet knows right well.
15
No bone of mine from thee is hid to know,
Though close embroidred in the earth below.
16
Thine eyes did on my shapelesse substance look,
And framed my members from a formlesse mass;
Each one of them is written in thy book,
What day they formed were, when none there was.
17
How precious are, O God, thy thoughts to me,
Of their increase what mighty sums I see!
18
To number them, to number were the sand,
As often as I awake, I am with thee:
19
That thou, O God, would slay the wicked band,
And men of bloods: Depart ye all from me:
20
Which speak of thee what mischief can devise,
And, but lift up in vain, thine enemies.
21
And do not I, Lord, them that hate thee, hate,
And grieve at those that up against thee rise,
As if with me thy haters held debate,
As if they me despised, that thee despise?
22
In hatreds full perfection them I hate,
And in the number of my foes relate.
23
Search me, O God, my secret angles sound,
And of my heart exactest knowledge take,
Examine mine intentions from their ground,
Of all my thoughts a perfect audit make.
See whether I in sorrows by-path stray,
And lead me in the everlasting way.
PSALM. 140. Eripe me Domine. Ad Praestantem, Psalmus Davidis.
THe evil man, the violent,
from me, O Lord, keep far:
2
Whose heart on mischief wholly bent,
they daily gather war.
3
They, like a Serpent, whet their tongue,
beneath their lips bear stings;
With Aspes fell poison to be stung,
less deadly danger brings. Selah.
4
Lord, keep me from the wicked hand,
and from the violent;
To thrust away my feet, which stand,
and study to prevent.
5
For me the proud have hid a snare,
with cords wide spread a net:
Waylaid my path at un-aware,
their grins for me have set. Selah.
9
Thou to the Lord my God, I said,
to hear this voice of mine,
A suitor to thy grace for aid,
thine ear, O Lord, incline.
7
Lord God my strength, my strength to lead,
my saving health from harms:
Thou sett'st the Helmet on my head,
upon the day of Arms.
8
Lord, wicked men encourage not,
nor grant them their desire,
O further not his crafty plot,
lest further they aspire. Selah.
9
Upon my chiefest haters head,
that compass me about,
A covering of their lips to spread,
let mischief ma^ke them out.
10
Let burning coals on them descend;
hot fire on them let fall:
And into dungeons deep them send.
whence rise they never shall.
11
A man of tongue shall never grow
established in the land:
But evil, to his overthrow,
shall hunt the griping hand.
12
I know, the Lord will Justice frame,
the poor oppressed to quit:
The Just shall sure confess thy Name,
the right, before thee sit.
PSALM. 141. Ad te, Domine. Psalmus Davidis.
TO this complaint, O Lord, of mine,
thy speedy help apply:
Thine ear unto my voice incline,
when unto thee I cry.
2
As incense, let my prayer be sent,
and right before thee rise;
Let mine up-lifted palms present
an evening sacrifice.
3
Set, Lord, a watch my mouth before,
my wandering tongue to tie;
And of my lips keep fast the door,
whence words have wings to fly.
4
To evil further not my heart,
pretenses to pretend:
Their dainties let me eat no part,
whom wicked deeds commend.
5
But smite me, let the Just in love,
his hand up-lifted lights;
Compassions his reprovings prove,
his Mawle in mercy smites.
Such balm (none such the wicked power)
shall never break mine head:
For in their evils evil hour,
my prayer for them shall plead.
6
Their ^udges, though by hands of rocks,
lie felled beneath our feet,
To hear my sayings, swarm by flocks,
for they are pleasing sweet.
7
Our scattred bones together put,
the mouth of Hell receives,
As stone on earth from Quarry cut,
as chips the cleaver cleaves.
8
But unto thee, O God the Lord,
mine eyes attendant look,
When help thou will my hopes afford,
leave not my soul forsook.
9
Preserve me from the handed-snare,
which they for me have laid,
And grins, for which their wicked care,
with cost and pain has paid.
10
But let the wicked down be cast,
his toil his taker be:
While I, together over-past,
his fall, my safety see.
PSALM. 142. Voce mea ad Dominum. Maschil Davidis, cum esset in spelunca, oration.
MY voice, up to the Lord, I strained,
and showed my woeful case;
My voice, unto the Lord complained,
and humbly su'd for grace.
2
My meditation I prepared,
before him to express;
Before his face, have I declared,
and powered out my distress.
3
When, sunk my spirit within me lay,
my path then did thou know;
A snare to walk on, in my way,
they closely did bestow.
4
On my right hand I looked, and saw,
to know me there was none:
All refuge did from me withdraw;
to seek my soul, not one.
5
To thee, o Lord, I cried, and said,
to thee my hopes arrive;
My lot before me thou have laid,
the land of them that live.
6
Consider my complaint, to thee,
attend my low-brought cry:
From my pursuers rescue me,
they stronger are than I.
7
My soul out of close prison bring,
I shall confess thy Name;
The just about me in a ring,
thy bounty shall proclaim.
PSALM. 143. Deus exaudi. Psalmus Davidis.
Hear, Lord, my prayer, my fuits entend,
which I for grace to thee,
And to thy faithfulness commend,
in justice answer me!
2
And enter not by judgments right,
thy servants sins to sound;
For justified shall in thy sight,
not one that lives be found.
3
My soul, is by my foe pursued,
my life, to earth, lies smit:
Among the dead, for ever mewed,
in darkness set, to sit.
4
My spirit, within me spent, has left
my understanding crazed:
My troubled heart, of rest bereft,
amidst me lies amazed.
5
I call to mind the days of old,
on all thy work I muse;
Thy deeds my serious thoughts behold,
what pass thy hands peruse.
6
To thee I stretch forth either hand,
thy help to entertain:
My soul ^or thee, as weary land,
thirsts after welcome rain. Selah.
7
Haste Lord and hear, my spirit is done,
hide not thy face from me:
Like them that down the pit are gone,
lest else made soon I be.
8
Thy morning mercy make me hear,
in thee I trust, to me
The way I am to walk make clear,
I list my soul to thee.
9
From my pursuing enemies,
O Lord, deliver me:
That where my safeties shelter lies,
for covert fly to thee.
10
Thou art my God, to do thy will,
O make me understand,
To guide me, thy good Spirit instill,
where right commands the land.
11
And for that Names sake of thine own,
thou, Lord, shall quicken me:
As for thy Justice thou art known,
my soul from pressure free.
12
Against my foes thy power employ,
make strong thy Mercies arm:
My souls distressors all destroy,
that me thy servant harm.
PSALM. 144. Benedictus Dominus. Davidis.
Blessed be the Lord, my Rock of Might,
my Fortress, never far:
By whom my hands are taught to fight,
my fingers framed for war.
2
My Mercy, my strong Hold, my Tower,
my Savior, and my Shield:
In whom I trust, and by whose power,
to me my people yield.
3
Lord, what is man, that thy respect,
to know him, takes such care?
Why on the sons of man reflect,
and reckon what they are?
4
Man is of vanity a mass,
made up, on earth to creep;
Whose days, as slides the shadow, pass
to death, the house of sleep.
5
Thy Heavens, O Lord, bow and come down,
with tempests warning stroke;
And with thy clouds, the Mountains crown,
but touch, and they shall smoke.
6
Lighten thy lightnings fi'ry darts,
to scatter them withal:
Send home thine arrows to their hearts,
and, troubled, make them fall.
7
Thy saving hand send from on hi^,
for my deliverance stand:
Rid from the many waters nie,
freed from strange childrens hand.
8
Whose mouth of vanity the mold,
dissembles in their style*
On falsehood, whose right hand takes hold,
a right hand full of guile.
9
To thee, O God, prepare will I,
a new-set song to sing,
On ten-string'd Lute and Psalterie,
with sound of voice and string.
10
His gift it is whereby Kings stand,
salvation that they have;
Does from the sword in mischiefs hand,
his servant David save.
11
Release me from strange childrens hand,
whose mouth the mint of lies;
Whose right hand, right hand is to band,
and vent vain forgeries.
12
Which say, "Our sons young plants shall grow;
the daughters we beget,
Like polish't angles on a row,
in Royal Palace set.
13
That yielding sorts of meats and meats.
our Garners never cease:
Our flocks bring thousands in our streets,
ten thousands of increase.
14
Our Oxen fed, to labor stout,
the burden, strong to bear:
No breaking in, none going out,
our streets no clamor hear.
15
O blessed people! (people say)
with goods, not goodness stored:
O, rather blessed people they,
whose good is God the Lord.
PSALM. 145. Exaltabo te Deus. Tehillah (...) Davidis.
Acrostichon, deest Nun Hebr.
(...) ADvance thy praise, my King, O God, will I,
and I will bless thy Name perpetually:
(...) 2
Blessing thee every day will I dispend,
to praise thy Name my song shall never end.
(...) 3
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,
and to his greatness can no search ^e raised.
(...) 4
Deeds done by thee shall age to age commend,
to show thy powers, posterities contend.
(...) 5
How beauteous is thy glorious Majesty,
words of thy marvells meditate will I.
(...) 6
Whose dreadful power to speak they shall not spare,
as for thy greatness, that will I declare.
(...) 7
Sums of thy goodness shall men's minds employ,
to sing thy Justice, they shall shout for joy.
(...) 8
How full of grace! with pity how repleat
the Lord! long-suffring, and in mercy great.
(...) 9
To all, the Lord his goodness sends down,
and all his works his tender mercies crown.
(...) 10
In praising thee, Lord, all thy works confess,
and (blessed in being thine) thy Saints thee bless.
(...) 11
Clear glory of thy Kingdom they shall tell,
and with thy glory speak what power does dwell.
(...) 12
Let Adams children know his mighty hand,
his Kingdoms comely honor understand.
(...) 13
Measure of time thy Kingdoms reign transcends,
and thy Dominion age and age extends.
(...) 14
Sustainer is the Lord of all that fall,
and them that crooked are, erecteth all*
(...) 15
Intent on thee their eyes all creatures bend,
and thou, in time to them their meat do send.
(...) 16
Plentifully, with open hand, at will,
each living things desire thou do fulfill.
(...) 17
So just the Lord in all the ways he goes,
so merciful in all the works he does.
(...) 18
Callers on him to all the Lord is nie,
to all that call upon him faithfully.
(...) 19
Requests all granted, shall his fearers have,
to hear their cry, and them distressed to save.
(...) 20
So all that love him, will the Lord sustain;
and of the wicked, let not one remain.
(...) 21
To praise the Lord, my mouth a song shall frame,
all flesh for ever bless his holy Name.
PSALM. 146. Lauda anima med Dominum. Halelu-jah.
O Praise the Lord, my soul, as long
as life (Lord) lends me days:
2
Thy praise (while I!) shall be my song,
my God, to sing thy praise.
3
In Princes, and in Adams son,
whose substance is but dust,
With whom is no salvation,
repose no settled trust.
4
Who, when his prisoned spirit goes forth,
turns to his earth again:
That day his thoughts are nothing worth
he traveled with in pain.
5
O happy he, that has fore-laid,
to be his strong abode,
The God of Jacob for his aid,
his hope, the Lord his God.
6
Which made the heavens, the earth, the deeps,
and what they all contain:
His promise faithfully who keeps,
for ever to remain.
7
Which judges those that suffer wrong,
gives to the hungry bread:
The Lord from chains and fetters strong,
sets loose the captive head.
8
The Lord gives light to lightlesse eyes,
restores the blind to sight:
The Lord erects that crooked lies,
the Lord the Just loves right.
9
The Lord keeps strangers from distress,
of Orphans is the stay:
Relieves the widow comfortless,
subverts the wicked way.
10
The Lord, upon his Royal Throne
eternally shall reign;
Thy God, O Sion, King alone,
shall age and age remain.
PSALM. 147. Laudate Dominum.
PRaise God, for it is good to sing,
a song of praise is sweet:
To praise our God a pleasant thing,
his praise, a practice meet.
2
Of his Jerusalem the walls,
the Lord builds up again;
The scattred outcasts home recalls,
His Isreal's remain.
3
His hand the brokenhearted heales,
their depth of sorrow sounds:
Safe medicine for their sickness deals,
binds up their bleeding wounds.
4
The number of the Stars he tells,
and gives them names express:
5
Great is the Lord, his Power excells,
his Prudence numberless.
6
The Lord lifts-up the meek on wings,
to base oppression thrust;
But headlong down the wicked flings,
and drownes their pomp in dust.
7
O sing unto the Lord with praise,
with praise of voice and string;
High to the Harp our voices raise,
Psalms to our God to sing.
8
Which covers Heavens with clouds, below
for earth prepares the rain;
On Mountains cliffes makes grass to grow,
as on the Meadowie-plaine.
9
Which to the Nation of the beast,
their feeding does supply;
And gives the sons of Ravens a feast,
when they for hunger cry.
10
He takes no pleasure in the might,
and manage of the Horse;
Nor in the legs of man delight,
supporters of his force.
11
The Lords delight is on them set,
that on his fear depend:
That to his Mercy seek to get,
whereon their hopes attend.
12
O Salem, laud the Lord Most-Hie,
Sion, thy God confess:
13
For he thy gates does fortify,
^hy sons within thee, bless.
14
He in thy border settleth peace,
from fear of hostile hand:
With kidneys fat of wheats increase,
he loads thy labored land.
15
The earth his blessings does afford,
at his commanding will;
And very swiftly runs his Word,
his Precept to fulfill.
16
He from his clouds, with scattring gale,
like locks of wool gives snow;
Does on the Hill, the Down, the Dale,
hoare-frosts, like ashes, strew.
17
His ice, like morsels, forth he casts,
to bind the streams in bands:
Before his cold-congealing blasts,
who stands, that them withstands?
18
He sends his Word, that wills them melt,
his South Wind bids to blow;
Whose thawing breath no sooner felt,
the frozen waters flow.
19
His Word of truth, whereon to trust,
to Jacob has he told:
His Statutes and his Judgments just,
taught Israel to hold.
20
He has not so in any case,
with any Nation dealt;
Nor with like knowledge of his grace,
his Judgments have they felt.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 148. Laudate Dominum. Halelu-jah.
YE Quiristers of Heavenly Quire,
to praise the Lord Most-Hie,
From Heaven, whereto our Hymns aspire,
confess him from on hie.
2
Ye Angels all, that in a ring,
about his Throne attend:
His praise in heavenly consort sing,
him all his Hosts commend.
3
O Sun, the Sovereign of the day,
and Moon, the Queen of night;
His praises Sun and Moon display,
with all the Stars of light.
4
Ye Heavens of Heavens, confess him all,
about your Spheres that move:
From Aire's mid-region, ye that fall,
cold waters from above.
5
To praise the Name of God the Lord,
their part each creature bear:
For his Commandment gave the word,
and they created were.
6
Their Order, and eternal Round,
by him established was;
His Law, their limits certain bound,
they have no power to pass.
7
Dragons and Whales, your deepest note,
to praise the Lord compose;
That range in So^les or Seas remote,
his praise all Deeps disclose.
8
Fire, Hail, Snow, Vapor, stormy Wind,
his ministers at hand;
To burn, to bruise, to lose, to bind,
to do his Words command.
9
Mountains, Hills, Desert, or in Field,
Trees, free-growne, planted; all,
As well that fruit by culture yield,
as Laric-Cedars tall.
10
Wild Beast, that Cave or Covert keeps,
all Cattle, every thing,
On mother-earth as well that creeps,
as aire-cut Foul of wing.
11
Kings great on earth, to Soveraigne's-Great,
all Subjects that belong:
Princes, and all on Judgments Seat,
that judge Earths right and wrong.
12
Young Men and Maidens, whose fresh flowers
of youth begin to bloome:
Old Men and Children, whose best powers
are past, or yet to come.
13
The Lords Name let them praise, for hie
his Name is raised alone;
Above the earth his Majesty,
above the Heavens his Throne.
14
And he has raised his peoples Horn,
a praise his Saints hold dear;
Of Israel the children borne,
a Nation to him near.
PSALM. 149. Cantate Domino. Halelu-jah.
SIng to the Lord a new-set song,
un-heard in former days:
His Saints assemblies sing among,
and celebrate his praise.
2
With joy his Makers praise to sing,
let Israel make choice;
As loyal Subjects to their King;
let Sions sons rejoice.
3
To praise his Name with Flute and Dance,
his praise in consort sing,
With Timbrels touch his praise advance,
with Hymns and Harps sweet string.
4
The Lord is with his people pleased,
the meek in heart cast down,
With his Salvations beauty eased,
with glorious Wreath to crown.
5
In glory let the Saints rejoice,
in holy company;
And shout at home with joyful noise,
as on their beds they lie.
6
Of Gods high praises, let the word
within their throat resound;
And in their hand a two-mouth'd sword,
on each side sharp, be found.
7
The Heath'ns with vengeance to pursue,
with pride, that so did swell:
The Nations, with reprovings due,
to check, when they rebel.
8
To bind their Kings in captive chains,
and leave their Hosts no head:
Their Nobles, with their lordly trains,
in iron bolts to lead.
9
To execute the Judgment writ,
upon them every one:
Such honor as does best befit,
to all his Saints be done.
Halelu-jah.
PSALM. 150. Laudate Dominum. Halelu-jah.
O Praise God in his Holiness,
his firmament of might:
2
His powers, his greatness numberless,
with boundless praise recite.
3
His praise let sound of Trumpet ring,
praise him with Lute and Lyre:
4
Praise him with Tymbrel, Flute, and String,
with Organ fill the Quire.
5
Praise him with Cymbals sounding shrill,
his praises great record:
Let loudest-sounding Cymbals fill:
"Let all breath praise the Lord.
PSALM. 151. Ex Additione Apollinarii. 1 SAMUEL cap. 17.
OF all my brethren, I (the least)
my Harp and Song assai'd;
And while my flock was at their feast,
to feast their Master played.
2
Such happiness have Shepherds crew,
that know no further care:
How happy were they, if they knew,
how happy men they are!
3
That common not, where clamours dwell,
nor covet but their own;
Nor to their Betters known too well,
dye to themselves unknown.
4
But ah, my Shepherds fare, farewell,
farewell my flock of sheep;
My little flock, who kept you well,
must you no longer keep.
5
Yet Harp and Song, that Shepherd sings,
to whom the Muse is given,
May change a strain, and sing of Kings,
may sing the King of Heaven.
6
Say then, what Angel came to call
Heavens Champion forth to fight,
Against Heavens foe, and in his fall
put all his Host to flight?
7
A man of Gath, an Infidel,
with him, at handy-strokes,
Of all the Host of Israel,
a Combatant provokes.
8
His limbs were vast, and ample nerv'd,
his weapons not a few:
His sword and shield, the Saint he served,
his Idols served for show.
9
My Brethren valiant were and strong,
but God had not decreed,
To them the glory should belong,
of this Heaven-sorted deed.
10
God gave me courage to confound
this crest-swolne Pythons power;
To batter down, and bring to ground
this cloud-threat Babel Tower.
11
Full forty days this Behemoth came,
to our hearts grief to hear,
Blaspheming Gods Almighty Name.
Like Weavers beam, his Spear.
12
No Spear brought I, nor Bow, nor Bill,
of Armor use had none:
To charge a Sling I had some skill,
and thence discharge a stone.
13
Wherewith, if right his Murrion sit,
may I but see his face,
My thunder-handed bolt shall hit
the destined speeding-place.
14
Enraged, mine eldest brother cried,
This fight com^st thou to see?
Avaunt, proud Boy: I soon replied,
Is here no cause for me?
15
More calm King Saul: My heart (holds) good,
years (doubts) too few, in truth:
Gath flesh't in battles, broil^s, and blood,
a kill-man from his youth.
16
But I, What is he more than man?
Let no man's heart (said) fail:
Against six cubits and a span,
shall not Heavens Arm prevail?
17
A Lion and a Bear surpised,
and slain my right hand has:
This Philistine uncircumsised,
What is this man of Gath?
18
Comes Gath to shed our blood for spoil,
as wine press sheds the grape?
Or does his Ekrons hungry soil,
for Judah's Cities gape?
19
With him to deal do I desire,
these Rephaims force to feel:
Although his hands were hands of fire,
or gads of burning steel.
20
The Lion and the Bear for might,
were much the better part:
But man to man is equal fight,
the odds is in the heart.
21
Admit with sith he mow his beard,
with harrow rake his head:
His Lance be like a maine-mast reared,
an iron rack his bed!
22
I bring to field (and God before)
as many hands as he:
A better cause, and courage more,
and these are Arms for me.
23
The iron he is wont to wear,
who blames me to refuse?
As much perhaps as I can bear,
much more than he can use.
24
He comes to me with Sword and Shield,
with steeled bead Spear in hand;
Armed with his Name, come I to field,
that Armies can command.
25
Then he, thy dreame-beleeving boasts,
old Jesse's beardlesse son:
Thine Host, thine Hosts, Lord God of Hosts,
accursed be all, as one:
26
What honor shall my Combat gain,
with Shepherd Rival shared:
Of thee, when men shall say (though slain)
yet this was he that dared.
27
The only man of all his Host,
so often urged thereto:
What none durst do, who durst do most,
that undertook to do.
28
That dared with one, that did excel,
encounter hand to hand:
In which encounter though he fell,
he fell, where none durst stand.
29
Thy glory will be easy bought,
a deathlesse victory,
With me sit match, but to be thought,
though purchas't with to die.
30
Give me a man, my equal match,
where like proportion lies:
With Flies men may not Eagles catch,
and Eagles catch no Flies.
31
Ye Reeds of Judah, raise high wind,
and Trumpet loud of war:
But we by proof, asunder find,
your sound and substance far.
32
Why, Race of leaves? why, shades on wall,
why should your female fear,
Since ^all ye must, refuse to fall
by great Pelesheths spear?
33
By us to have been overcome,
what loss shall ye sustain?
Sometime to have been lost, to some
has proved the loosers gain.
34
Yield us your Lords, and home return,
possess your days in peace:
With sword, incense not fire to burn,
thy Braves, Ben-Jesse, cease.
35
Five thousand shekels weight of brass,
my coat of Maile out-weighes:
Six hundred iron shekels mass,
upon my speare-pile plays.
36
Beneath this weight thou scarce can stand,
scarce this bare burden bear:
But much more heavy my right hand,
dye, ere thou feel, for fear.
37
Add then my Helm, Sword, Shield, and Lance,
a second load alone,
Too big for thee but to advance,
Brat, with thy feeble bone!
38
Thou have three brethren armed in field,
were all your strength in one;
All four could not one Anak yield,
to combat me alone.
39
More blessed had thou abode at home,
and served thy fathers slaves,
Than, Wretch, with me to cope have come,
as to a dog with staves.
40
In scorn, my sword is stained with none,
before my wroth be whet:
Now scorn and anger join in one,
what rage shall both beget?
41
Thy bowels, and white-marrow'd bones,
shall therefore wild beasts eat:
Thy brains beat out with bats and stones,
shall be the Vultures meat.
42
What help! I had no reaching dart,
no tackling, but a thong:
A sling my weapon; but a heart
above all weapon, strong.
43
Thy railing challenge speaks thee base,
in terms blasphemous flung:
Nor suits it with a soldiers grace,
to be so rank of tongue.
44
A Lions head (Fool) can out-beard
an host of heartlesse Hinds:
The greatest men (is often heard)
bear not the greatest minds.
45
Thy Helm and Target trust thou not,
with those unwieldy thighs:
The compleat-arm'd Rhinocerot,
look where he falls, he lies.
46
Thine Armours load, but laggs faint heart,
for flight the more unfit:
The bigger man thou art, thou art
the bigger mark to hit.
47
Thou have not soul enough to cramme,
that Carricks every chinke:
The hugest Hulke that ever swamme,
a small sprung leake may sink.
48
When Air and Water fall to mire,
the purest from to fall,
The soul of Elements, the fire,
is spher'd above them all.
49
No spark of that Ethereall flame,
inspired thine earth-borne birth:
As from the earth thy Chaos came,
thou have a soul of earth.
50
As earth, thy mother groaned in pain,
when she thy burden gave:
Thy breath, between thy teeth constrain,
and groaning gnaw thy grave.
51
But most, to make thy quarrel good,
must grounded cause be given:
Thy vantage is but flesh and blood,
mine is the hand of Heaven.
52
What fury forced thee on these pikes,
forlorn attempt to give?
"At Heaven who strikes, himself he strikes,
and has not long to live.
53
Of five, I chose one pibble round,
that level flew as li^e;
And in his forehead sunk a wound;
Thou have it, Philistine!
54
Now, for mine own I can thee claim!
"To Ida's faire-ey'd Swain,
"The Delian gave not so good aim,
"when Thetis son was slain.
55
God, even our God, of Mighties most,
whom thou revild'st this day,
By me, the meanest of his Host,
has sent thee death for pay.
56
His sword then drew I from his side,
and grovelling on the land,
As he the living God defied,
at once, with either hand,
57
His head I from his shoulders struck,
there our Colossus fell;
So this reproach Ben-Jesse took
from honored Israel.
58
Thou, Vale of Elah, saw this fight,
that cost Goliaths head:
Thou, Vale of Elah, saw this flight,
when lost Pelesheth fled.
59
Ye neighbor Groves, and ecchoing Trees,
heard Gath on Dagon call:
Proud Ashteroth, beneath our knees,
saw Ekrons Idols fall.
60
For joy let Judah shout to God,
while Gath and Ekron howl;
My soul a valiant march has trod,
a valiant march my soul.
