Loves Lunacie. Or, Mad Besses Fegary.
Declaring her sorrow, care and moan,
Which may cause many a sigh and groan:
A Young Man did this Maid some wrong,
Wherefore she writ this mournful Song.
To the Tune of, The mad man's Morris.



Poor Besse, mad Besse, so they call me,
I Am metamorphosed;
Strange sights and visions I do see,
by Furies I am led:
Tom was the cause of all my woe,
to him I loudly cry,
My love to him there is none does know,
yet here he lets me lie.
This Bethlem is a place of torment,
here is fearful notes still sounding;
Here minds are filled with discontent,
and terrors still abounding.
Some shake their chains in woeful wise,
some swear, some curse, some roaring,
Some shrieking out with fearful cries,
and some their clothes are tearing.
O cursed Alecto that fierce fury,
Megara, Tysiphon!
Are governors of my late glory;
wise Pa^las me does shun:
My jems, my sewels and my earings,
are turned to ^^on fetters;
They now do serve for others wearings,
such as are now my betters.
Orcades Fairies now do lead me,
Ore mountains, hills and valleys,
Naiades does through waters drive me,
and Brizo with me dallies:
O sometimes I dream of my Tom,
then with my folded arms
I him embrace, saying welcome,
but waking breeds my harms.
Adrastea now robs me,
of all my wit and patience,
Angarona will not receive me,
to live in peace and silence:
My mind runs on my fine apparel,
which once did fit my wearing:
Then with my self I seem to quarrel,
my rags I fall to tearing.
O once I was as fair as Briseis,
and chaste as was Cassandra,
But living void of joy and blisses,
I Am Hero to Leander:
For as chaste Hero her self drowned,
so I am droun'd in sorrow;
The Fates on me has sorely frowned,
no patience I can borrow.
The second part, To the same tune.


I AM like to fair Philomela,
by Tereus basely ravished;
Yet when his burning lust did thaw,
he closely her imprisoned;
And even so I Am quite defloured
by Tom of all my senses;
My love and means he has devowred,
making no recompenses.
You Gods and all you Goddesses,
pray listen to my mourning,
And grace me with this happiness,
to see my Toms returning.
Or if you will not grant me this,
to send him hither to me,
Send me but word whereas he is,
and Tom, I Will come unto thee.
If that he be in God Marses train,
where armor brightly glisters;
Be sure I Will fetch him home again,
in spite of the three Sisters:
Or if he be in Venus Court,
where Cupid shoots his arrows:
I Will fetch him thence from all his sport,
only to ease my sorrows.
Stay, who comes here? it is the sisters three,
which lately I did mention,
I doubt they come to chide with me
and hinder my intention.
Clotho brings wool, Lachesis does spin,
Atropos cuts asunder;
Now I Will away and not be seen,
each one is my Commander.
You Maids and Uirgins fair and pure
note well my careful calling,
You cannot think what I endure,
Cupid has caused my falling:
When I was as now many be.
free from God Cupids arrows,
I would have smiled at any she,
that should tell me of sorrows.
My lodging once was soft and easy,
my garments silk and satin;
Now in a lock of straw I lie,
this is a woeful pattin:
My diet once was choice and fine,
all which did not content me;
Now I drink water, once good wine
was naught unless twere sent me.
Thus pride and love together joynd
to work my utter ruin;
They wrought my discontent in mind,
which causes my undoing.
And thus good people all adue,
perhaps you nere may see me,
Farewell I bid once more to you,
I Am grieved sore believe me.
But if you chance once more to come,
bring tidings from my dearest,
By all means bring my true love Tom,
he is welcomst when he is nearest:
The day is past, and night is come,
and here comes our commander;
He Will lock me into a dark room,
it is sorrows chiefest Chamber.
FINIS.
