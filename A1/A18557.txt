^hou fires god of arms / mars the read
That in the frosty contre called trace
Within thy grysly temple full of dread
Honored art as patron of that place
With thy bellona / pallas full of grace
Be present and my song continue and gye
At my beginning thus to the I cry
For it full deep is sonken in my mind
With pieteus heart in english for tendyte
This old storye in latin that I find
Of queen anelida and falls arcyte
That elde that all can frete and byte
As it has freten many anoble storye
Has nyh devoured out of my memory
Be favorable eke thou polimia
On pernaso that with thy sustren glade
By elycon / not fer from cirrea
Singest with wis memorial in the shade
Under the laurer the which may not fade
And do that I my ship to haven wynue
First follow I stace and after that corynne
When theseus with werres long and great
Thaspre folk of cithye / had overcome
With laurer crowned i^ his chare gold beat
Home to his contre hool is come
For which the people / blisful al and some
So cryeden / that to the sterres it went
And him to honouren / did al their ente^te
Biforn this duc in sign of victory
The trompes come / and in his baner large
The image of mars / and in tokeni^g of glory
Men might see of tresour many a charge
Many bright helm and many a spear and targe
Mani a fresh kinght and mani a blisful route
On horse and foot all the field about
Ipolita his wife / the hardy queen
Of cythia / that he conquered had
With emelie / her youg suster shene
Fair in a chare of gold / he with him lad
That al ye ground about her chare she sprad
With brightness of the beauty of her face
Fulfillyd with largess of all grace
With this tryu^phe and laurer crowned thus
In all the flower of fortunes yeuyng
Let I this noble prince Theseus
Toward atthenes in his way rydyng
And fond I will shortly for to bring
The sleyght way of that I began to write
Of queen anelida / and false arcyte
Mars that with his furyous course of Ire
Tholde wrath of Juno to susfylle
Has set the peples hertes both a fire
Of thebes and greece / each other to kylle
With blody speres / ne rested never stylle
But thro^g / now here / now there among botle
Til eueryche other slowhe so were they wroth
For when amphiorax and tideus
Ipomedon and / parthonope also
Were deed and slain and proud ca^paneus
And when the wretched brethern two
Were slain and king adrastus hom y go
So desolate stood thebes / and so bare
That no wight / couthe remedy of his fare
And when tholde creon began espy
How the blood ryal was brought adoun
He held that cite by his tyranny
And did the gentyls of that regyoun
To ben his friends / and women in that toun^
So what for love of him / and what for awe
The noble folk were to the toun^ ydrawe
Among all these / anelida the queen
Of ermonye / was in that toun^ dwelling
That fayrer was / than is the son shene
Through the world so began her name spryng
That her to seen / had every wight lykyng
For as of troth / is there none her lyche
Of all the women / in the world rich
Young was this queen / of.xx. year old
Of myddel stature / and of such fayrnes
That nature had a Joy / her to byholde
And for to speak of her stedefastnes
She pussed has penolope and lucres
And shortly if she shall be comprehended
In her might nothing been amended
This theban knight eke soth to seyne
Was young and there with all a lusty knight
But he was double in love and nothing pleyn^
And subtyl in that craft over any wight
And with his cu^nyng wan ye lady bright
For so ferforth he began to her troth ensure
That she him trusted over any crature
What should I seyn she loved arcyte so
That when he was absent any throw
An^on her thought her heart breast atwo
For in her sight to her he bare him low
So that she wend have al his heart yknowe
But he was falls it was but feyned chere
Al needs not to men such craft te lere
But natheles full mychel besynes
Had he or he might his lady win
And swear he would dye for destres
Or from his wit he said he would twynne
Allas the while for it was routh and sin
That she upon his sorrows would rewe
But nothing thinks the false as the true
Hye fredam^ fond arcyte in such manner
That al was his that she has / much or lite
Ne to no creature / made she chere
Further / than that it lykyth to arcyte
There nas lack / wherewith he might her wite
She was so ferforth yeuen him to plese
That all that lyketh him it deed her eese
There nas to her / no manner ^re^ sent
That touched love / from any manner wight
That she ne shewid it him / er it was brent
So pleyn she was and did her full might
That she nel hiden nothing from her knight
Lest he of any untruth her vpbreyde
With out bode / his heste she obeyde
And eke he made him Jealous over here
That when any man had to her said
Anon he would prayen her to swear
What was ye word / or make him euel paid
And than we^de she out of her wit have brayd
But all this nas but sleyght and flaterye
Without love he feyned Ielousye
And all this took she so debonairly
That al his will it thought her skilful thing
And ever the longer she loves him te^derly
And did him honor / as he were a king
Her heart was to him wedded with a ring
So ferforth upon truth / is her entente
That where he goth / her heart with him went
When she shall ete / on him is al her thought
That well vnuethe / of mete took she keep
And when yt she was to her rest ybrought
On him she thought always / til yt she sleep
When he was absent / pryuely she would weep
Thus lyneth fair anelyda the queen
For falls arcyte / that did her all this tene
This false arcyte / of his newfanglenes
For she to him / so lowly was and true
Took less deynte / of her stedfastnes
And saw another lady proud and new
And right anon he clad him in her hew
Wot I not whether / in white read or grene
And falshede fair aneli^da the queen
But natheles great wonder was it none
Though he was falls / it is kind of man^
Sith lameth was / that is so long a goon
To be in love as falls / as ever he can
He was the first fader that began
To louen two / and was in bygamye
And he fond tents first but if men lie
This false arcyte / somewhat must he feyne
When he was falls / to couere his trayterye
Right as an horse / yt can both bite and pleyne
For he bar her on hond / of trecherye
And swore / he couthe her doublenes espy
And al was falsnes that she to him meant
Thus swore this thief and forth his way he went
Allas what heart / might enduren it
For routh and woo / her sorrow for to tell
Or what man has ye connyng or the wit
Or what man might within ye chamber duelle
If that I reherce should the hell
That suffers fair anelida the queen
For falls arcyte / that did her all this tene
She wepith. wayleth. sw^wneth pytously
To ground deed / she falls as a stone
Crampissheth her lyme^s / ^^ckedly
She spekith as her wit were al agone
Other color than asshen / has she none
None other word speaks she much or lyte
But mercy cruel heart mine arcyte
And thus endures til that she was so mate
That she and foot on which she may sustene
But forth languysshing ever in this astate
On which arcyte has couthe non ne tene
His heart was else where / new and grene
That on her woo / not deyneth him to think
Him recketh not / whether she flete or synke
His new lady holds him so narow
Up by the brydel / at the staves end
That every word / he drad as an arowe
Her dan^ger made him both bow and bend
And as her list / made him turn and wend
For she ne grants him in her living
No grace / why that he has lust to sing
But d^of him sorth uneath ^^st her know
That he was servant / unto her ladyship
But lest y^ he were proud she held him low
Thus serves he / without mete or sype
She sent him now to land and now to shype
And for she gaf him danger / al his fill
There fore she had him / at her owen will
Ensample of this ye thryfty women all
Takes head of anelida and arcyte
That for her list / him dear heart call
And was so meke / therefore he loves her lite
The kind of man^s heart / is to delight
In thing that stran^ge is / also god me save
For what he may not get / that would he have
Now torn we to anelida agayn^
That pyneth day by day languysshyng
But when she saw / that her gate no gayn^
Upon a day / full sorrowful weeping
She cast her^for to make a compleynyng
And of her owen hand she began it write
And send it to her theban knight arcyte
Here follows the compleynt of anelida queen of hermenye upon false arcyte of
Thebes.
So thirleth with the poi^t of remembrance
The swerd of sorrow / whet with falls plesa^ce
My heart bare of bliss / and blak of hew
That turned is / in quakyng / al my dance
My sewerte in a whaped con^tenaunce
Sith it auaylleth not to be true
For who so trewest is it shall her rewe
That serves love / and does her observance
Always till one / and changes for no new
I wot my self / as well as any wight
For I loved one with all my heart and might
More than my self / an.C. thousand sithe
And called him / my hertis life / my knight
And was all his / as fer as it was right
And when he was glad / than was I blithe
And his disese / was my death as swithe
And he again / his troth has me plight
For euermo / his lady me to kythe
Now is he falls / alas / and causeles
And of my woo / he is so routheles
That with a word / him list not ones deyne
To bring again / my sorouful heart in pe^
For he is caught up / in an other lees
Right as him list / he laweth at my pain
And I ne can my heart / not restreyne
For to love him / neither thelees
And of all this / I note to whom^ to pleyne
And shall I pleyne / alas the hard stounde
Unto my foo / that yaf my heart / a wound
And yet desires / that my harm be more
Nay certes / for there shall never be found
None other help / my sores for to sound
My destyne has shape it so / full yore
I will none other medicine / ne lore
I will be ay / there I was ones bound
That I have said be said for evermore
Allas / where is bicome your gentillesse
Your words full of plesance and humblesse
Your obsernances / and lo low manner
Your awaytyng / and your business
Upon me / that ye called your maistresse
Your sovereign of thise world is here
Alas / and is there now no word ^e chere
Ye wuchen sauf, upon my heaviness
Alas / your love / I bye it al to dear
Now certes sweet / though that ye
Thus causeles / the cause be
Of my dedely / aduersite
Your manly reason / ought it to respyte
To sle your friend / and namely me
That never yet in no degree
Offendyd / as wysly he
That al wot / out of woe my soul quyte
But for I was so plain arcyte
In all my werkis / much and lite
And so besy / you to delight
Mine honor sauf / meke. kind. and free
Therefore ye put on me this wite
And also ye reken not a myte
Though that the swerd of sorrow bite
My woeful heart / through your cruelte
My sweet foo / why do ye so. for shame
And think ye / that furtherd be / your name
To love a new / and be untrue / nay
And put you / in sklaundre now / and blame
And do to me / aduersyte / and grame
That love you most / god thou wost / always
Yet come again / and be thou plain / some day
And then shall this / ye now is mis / be game
And all foryeue / while I live / may
Lo heart mine / all this is for to seyn
As whether shall I pray / or ellis pleyn
Which is the way / to do you to be true
For either mote I han you in my cheyn
Or with the death / ye mote depart us tweyn
There lie none other mean weyes new
For god so wysly / on my soul rewe
As verily ye sle me with the peyn
That may ye se unfeigned an my hew
And should I pray / and weyuen woma^hede
Nay rather dye / than do so cruel deed
And axe mercy causeles / what need
And if I pleyne / what life that I led
Then will ye lawhe I know it out of deed
And if that I to you / mine oaths bid
For mine excuse / a skorn shall be my mede
Your chere flourith / but it will not sede
For long a goo / I often han take heed
For though I had you to morn ageyn
I might as well hold apryll for reyn
As holden you / to make you steadfast
All mighty god of troth souereyn
Where is ye truth of man who has it sleyn
Who ye him loves shall him find as fast
As in a tempeste is a roten maste
Is that a tame be / that is ay fayn
To fle away / when he is leest agaste
But mercy sweet / if I mys seye
Have I ought said out of the weye
I note / my wit is half a weye
I fare as does the song of chanteplure
For now I pleyne / and now I pleye
I am so marred that I deye
Arcyte has born awey the keye
Of all my world and good adventure
For in this world / nys creature
Wakyng in more discumfiture
Than I / ne more sorrow endure
And if I sleep / a furlong weye or twey
Then thinks me / your figure
Before me stont / clothid in azure
To profren eft / and new assure
For to be true / and love me / til he deye
The long night / this wonder sight / I dry
And on the day / for thilke affray / I dye
And of all this right naught ywis ye recche
Ne never mo / mine eyes two / be dry
And to your routhe / and to your truth / I cry
But well awey / fer ben they / to fecche
Thus holds we / my destyne / a wrecche
But me to read / out of this dread / or gye
Ne may my wit / so weyke is it / not strecche
Then I thus / syn I may do no more
I give it up / for now and evermore
For shall I never / eft putten in balance
My sikernes / or learn of love the lore
But as the swan / I have herd seye full yore
Again his death / shall syngen his penan^ce
So sing I here / my destyne or chan^ce
How that arcite / anelida so sore
Has thirled with the peynt of remembrance
Thus ends the compleynt of anelida
The conplei^t of chaucer unto his empty purse
To you my purs / and to none other wight
Complain I for ye be my lady dear
I am sorry now / that ye be light
For certes / ye now make me heavy chere
Me were as ^ef / be leyd upon a bear
For which / unto your mercy thus I cry
Be heavy again / or ellis mote I dye
Now wuchesauf / this day or yet be night
That I of you / the blisful sown may here
Or see your color like the son bright
That of yelownes had never pere
Ye be my life / ye be my herte^ stere
Queen of confort / and of good company
Be heavy again / or ellis mote I dye
Now purs that be to me my lives light
And saueour / as down in this world here
Out of this town help me by your might
Syn that ye will not be my tresorere
For I am ^haue / as nyghe as any friar
But I pray unto your curtoisye
Be heavy again / or ellis mote I dye
The nuoye of chaucer unto the king
O conqueror of brutes albion
Which that by line / and fre election^
Ben very king / this to you I send
And ye that may / all harms amend
Have mind upon my supplicacion^
Explicit.
When feyth failleth in prestes sawes
And lords hestes ar holden for laws
And robbery is holden purchase
And lechery is holden solas
Than shall the land of albion
Be brought to great confusion^
Hit falls for every gentilm^an
To say the best that he can
In man's absence
And the soth in his presence
Hit comes by kind of gentil blood
To cast away al heaviness
And gadre to gidre words good
The werk of wisdom herith witness
Et sic est finis
