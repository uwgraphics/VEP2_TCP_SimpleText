TO THE READER
MAny have been desirous to understand on what hopes, helps, and grounds, Sir
Anthony Sherley, with his brother Sir Robert Sherley, and many other friends
and followers, of our Nation, could not only be induced to undertake to
travel into a Kingdom so far remote, and to live amongst a people so far
different in Religion, Language, and Manners, as that of Persia is from ours:
but also he supplied of all necessaries for life, in a plenteous and
magnificent manner; and so highly endeare his service and industry to that King
and State, as to be esteemed and called a Mirza, or Prince of Persia, and to
be employed, within few months after his coming thither, as Ambassador from
so great a Potentate, in a matter of such ma^ne consequence and trust, to many
of the greatest Princes and States of Christendom.

And no less have many meruailed, how, after his failing in the accomplishment
of so great an enterprise, for want of due correspondence in an Instrument, he
had taken unto him, out of that Country for his better credence, his Brother
Sir Robert Sherley, whom he left behind him in Persia, could not only
maintain his reputation, but win so much credit with that King, as to be
honored with the Title of his Ambassador, to the Princes of Christendom, in
the like employment newly revived.

At his late being here in England (where he has been so accepted as in the
Courts of other great Princes of Christendom) a Gentleman of some
understanding conuersing oftentimes with him, and being desirous of true
information, concerning that action (whereof he had formerly heard, and read
some incoherent and fabulous reports) conferred with him often, concerning the
carriage, and circumstances of their proceedings: and thereby gave him occasion
to discourse unto him as well of the motives of that enterprise, as of many
accidents that befell him and his Brother in the conduct of that affair.
Wherein, al-be-it he received good satisfaction in diverse particularities;
yet, because the questions, occasioning such discourse, were but incidently
moved; and (by many occasions that happened) their conferences were often
interrupted: On the entreaty of the said Gentleman, for the better satisfying
of himself, and such others of his friends, as might be desirous, out of
their curiosity, to understand the whole progress, dependence, and prosecution
of the said voyage into Persia, he obtained of the Persian Ambassador, a Copy
of this discourse, penned by his Brother Sir Anthony Sherley (as it seems)
since his return out of Persia into Europe, for the better satisfaction of his
friends, and preserving the memory of so memorable an action.

To these labors of his Brother, Sir Robert Sherley himself as time and
opportunity shall give him leave, has promised some addition of his own
endeavors: which being not yet in such readiness, as his friends have wished
and desired; This discourse being but the former part, yet containing the
Register ^f so rare an attempt (whatsoever the suc^sse has been, or may be)
as has seldom been seen in this, or any former age, by a private Gentleman
to have been enterprized, the same being recorded by his own pen who has
been the first and chief Actor in it, has been thought by men of mature
judgment, to whom it has been communicated, (besides the History it self
which is pleasing and delightful) to contain many fruitful aduertisements.

So that having in it both the eleuations of a high spirit, and the
observations of a man experienced and versed in great affairs: it is the
rather unto thee re-commended.

THE TRVE History of Sir Anthony Sherleys Travels into Persia, Penned by
himself.
SINCE men are brought forth upon the earth for good ends, the principallest of
which is the glory of God, and then to better the world; in which many have had
bands, either of necessity, or other occupations, to have less experience by
their knowledge: I think, I should mightily err, if I should not deliver as
well to others, what I have seen and learned by my passing so many, and so
strange countries; as I should have done, if had not given my time and the
expense of it to the first end, which was, and is, God his great glory.

In my first years, my friends bestowed on me those learnings which were fit
for a Gentleman's ornament, without directing them to an occupation; and when
they were fit for agible things, they bestowed them and me on my Princes
service, in which I ran many courses, of diverse fortunes, according to the
condition of the wars, in which, as I was most exercised, so was I most
subject to accidents: With what opinion I carried my self (since the causes of
good or ill must be in my self, and that a thing without my self) I leave it
to them to speak; my places yet in authority, in those occasions were ever of
the best; in which, if I committed error it was contrary to my will, and a
weakness in my judgment; which, notwithstanding, I ever industriated my
self to make perfect, correcting my own ouer-sights by the most virtuous
examples I could make choice of: Amongst which, as there was not a Subject of
more worthiness and virtue, for such examples to grow from, then the
everliving in honor, and condign estimation the Earl of Essex, as my
reverence and regard to his rare qualities was exceeding; so I desired (as much
as my humility might answer, with such an eminency) to make him the pattern
of my civil life, and from him to draw a worthy model of all my actions. And
as my true love to him, did transform me from my many imperfections, to be,
as it were, an imitator of his virtues; so his affection was such to me, that
he was not only contended, I should do so, but in the true Nobleness of his
mind gave me liberally the best treasure of his mind in counselling me; his
fortune to help me forward; and his very care to bear me up in all those
courses, which might give honor to my self, and inworthy the name of his
friend: in so much, that after many actions, into which, peradventure, he
provoked my own slackenesse, The Duke of Ferrara dying, and leaving Don Cesare
D'Este Inheritor of that Principality, who by his birth could, indeed,
challenge nothing justly, being a Bastard; notwithstanding, in the worlds
opinion he was most likely to have been established in that succession,
through the long continuance of the government in that name; and the Princes of
that name, having ever through their temperate and just condition of Ruling,
wouen themselves into a sincere affection of that people: which was well
proved, by that great league made against it in former time by the Pope, the
French, and the Venetians, frustrated by the true devotion of those Subjects to
their Prince; besides, the great expectation, which was generally had of that
Don Cesare, and the extreme bondage of the government of the Church, which
those that have lived in another quality do utterly abhor. Which that
excellent Earl also considering, and besides (having no thought in him ever
separated from those circumstances, which might bring to an happy end his
infinite desire of her Majesty's Honor, Service, and prosperous good of his
Country,) judging that the Pope would not give his claim unto the Duchy
without words, and acts, and by the impotency of both those Princes in
themselves, both to make and continue so great a war (as that was likely to
have been by former examples) but that it must grow to great partiallities: The
lesser Princes of Italy being not likely to endure the Churches so great
increase of Temporality, which error was so greatly reprehended by them all in
Lewis the twelfth King of France; And that giving place to the right of that
title, they should interesse him in the same judgment for Vrbine also, and
many other places: so that the war, by these reasons, in all appearance likely
to be somented: and that the King of Spain, both in hope to better his
estates in Italy by that trouble, and by necessity to preserve those, which he
had already, and for being Vicar to the Church, and obliged for his kingdom of
Naples, must be embarked fully in that action; which would have been both a
great diuersion from his other designs, and a facillitating of any enterprise,
which that generous spirit of that Earl was ever framing, and undertaking
against him: and holding opinion that the Dukes greatest necessity at the first
must be of encouragement, and Captains, sent me presently (though the least
amongst many) accompanied with diverse Soldiers of approved valor, and
procured the Count Maurice, General of the States Army, to write him letters
of as much comfort, as could be given from so brave a Prince, and so famous an
Estate: and though my journey was undertaken in the dead of Winter, and I left
no pains untaken to accelerat it; yet before I could arrive in Italy, I found
the Duke given over to quieter resolutions, and Ferrara yielded to the Pope;
himself satisfying himself with Modona, and Rhegium, of which he now bears
the Title. Which when I had advertised the Earl of; as he, who never had his
own thoughts, limited, within any bounds of honorable and just ambition; So
he also desired, that those whom he had chosen into a neerenesse of affection
should also answer both his own conceit of them, and satisfy the world in
his election of them: wherefore, not willing I should return, and turn such a
voice as was raised of my going to nothing; as unwilling that I should, by a
vain expense of my time, money, and hope, be made a scorn to his and
(through him) to my enemies: He proposed unto me (after a small relation,
which I made unto him from Venice) the voyage of Persia, grounding of it upon
two points.

First, the glory of God; to which, his excellent religious mind was evermore
deuote. Then, if God would not please to choose me as a worthy instrument to
that great end; yet by making a profitable experience of my seeing those
Countries, limitting upon the King of Spaines vniall parts, and answering to
her Majesty's Merchants trades in Turkey, and Muskouy; and besides, being not
unlikely but some parts might have been found fit for the Indian Navigations,
then principiated in Holland, and muttered of in England; It might prove a
subject to extract great and good matter out of, for the honor of her Majesty,
and the particular good of our Country: Besides, some more private designs,
which my fortune, being of the condition, which my persecutions have brought it
unto, counsels me not to speak of: though they were most worthy ones, and
honorable, and honest in him, as a great Subject, and maine Pillar of that
State, which he was bound to serve by all means and all industry. Having with
these Aduertisements received strength to my own mind, large means and
letters of favor and credit to the company of Merchants at Aleppo; without
opening the secrets of my deliberation to any, as fearing the strange humor of
the world, rather inclined to mis-iudge of all actions, then to give them only
a charitable construction: not willing to be scorned if it effected not; and
assuring my self of all sort of reputation, if it proceeded well.

I embarked my self at Venice for Aleppo, in a Venetian ship, called the
morizell, the four and twentieth of May 1599. Five and twenty days the Ship
was sailing between Malmocko the Port of Venice, and Zant; in which space one
of the worst in the Ship, a passenger to Ciprus, used most scandalous speeches
of her Majesty, which being brought unto me, not only moved with the dutiful
zeal which a Subject owes to his Prince; but even with that respect which
every Gentleman owes to a Lady, I commanded one of my people to give him a
fit reward for so vile an abuse: which was no sooner done, but the Ship was
all in an uproar. And though the cause of the act was just, and so understood
by diverse principal Merchants, which went to Zant, and that the punishment was
nothing proportionable to the sceleratnesse of the fact; yet through the
instigation of one Hugo de Potso, a Portingall Factor, which was going to Ormus
(though they showed all to be satisfied, because they durst do no other, yet)
when we were to have departed in the ship from Zant, they would no more
receive us, so that we were forced to hire a Carramosall to carry us to Candy,
where we received most honorable entertainment, (the coming of strangers
thither being a thing so vnsuall that the Duke desired to show the Magnificence
of the great Signory to us that came first; and peradventure should be the
last for a long time.)

From thence in the same Carramosall we departed to Cyprus, and Paphos, where
we found nothing to answer the famous relations given by ancient Histores of
the excellency of that Island, but the name only, (the barbarousnesse of the
Turk, and time, having defaced all the Monuments of Antiquity) no show of
splendour, no habitation of men in a fashion, nor possessors of the ground in a
Principallity; but rather Slaves to cruel Masters, or prisoners shut up in
diverse prisons: so grievous is the burden of that miserable people, and so
deformed is the state of that Noble Realm. Notwithstanding, the present power
(I mean resident in that Island, which is the instrument of that great tyranny)
is so small, that if the little remnant of people, which is left there had
courage; or if they have courage, had also arms; or if the Princes Christian
had but a compassionate eye turned upon the miserable calamity of a place so
near them, rent from the Church of God, by the usurpation of Gods and the
worlds great enemy: and maintained more by the terror, which his name has
stroke into some truly; into others no more, but that they are contented he
should be thought terrible, for the better progress of their own more unjust
designs; I do not see, in that small judgment which my experience has given
me, but the redemption of that place and people were most facile (being but
four thousand Turks in the whole Island) and the glory would be immortal to
the Actor; besides the profit which must needs follow from so great an
acquist; and the preserving of it would also be of no expense, nor hazard: the
peoples affection binding it self to their redeemer; besides a necessity to
keep them united unto him by the means of so abhorred a neighbor, from whom
their vindication, into liberty, must be maintained by their own constancy:
and his extreme weakness by sea, warranting all tranquillity from fear of a
powrefull invasion, by which the Conqueror might be put in the least hazard.
But God (who in his great judgment weighs man's sins, and appoints, forth
of his treasury of wrath, scourges for their iniquities) perhaps has not fully
satisfied his causefull indignation, yet, with the suffering of that people;
and therefore blinds the eyes of the good understanding, of all his great
instruments, whom he has raised in the world to glorify his name, to
administer justice, and to lighten the burden of the oppressed, that they
should not see the calamites of that Country, nor that their cries should come
into their ears, by which their generous hearts should be moved to condign
compassion; nor that their judgments should be free to see their own
particular honor, and profit: So God uses to show man that he is a bubble,
raised only by his breath, moving by the same, and falling by the same,
according to the will of his great providence, to which we in the pride of our
nature, yield not the true attribution due unto it: yet the powerful working
of it is such, that with the confusion of our foolish pride, it proves it
self an eternal wisdom, which will give laws to the world, and the bridle
to all people, and guides only the hearts of Princes.

From Paphos we went to the Salin^s in a little hired bark, A (...).
where we found the morizell, in which we came to Zant. The Portingal, and
his accomplices presently went on shore to the Subbassa of the place (for so is
called the governor there) and told him diverse Pirates, who had lost their
Ships, were come into the harbor in a small Boat, amongst whom were some
boys, and youths, worth much money; besides, I know not what jewels and
treasure we had amongst us; with the which he would give him a good present
also, if he would send some of his Soldiers, and take us.

At this Oration of his, were present certain Armenian passengers, who had
known us in the ship, which moved with the enormity of so vile an act (that
Christians should sell and betray Christians to Turks, and that upon no cause
of offense, which they were witnesses of, we should be persecuted with such a
kind of inhumane cruelty) with all speed possible hired a Boat, themselves,
for Alexandretta, came with it unto us, provided in it victuals for us, and the
Masters themselves to loose no time; and beseeched us, with tears in their
eyes, to fly from thence with all speed possible; relating unto us the
scelerattreason conspired against us, and our imminent peril. Wherefore we
instantly changed into that Boat, and perceiving a Fregat a far off, rowing
toward us, for have, left most of our things behind us, and yet could not make
so much speed, but that the Ianizaries, which were in the Fregat, and chased
us, bestowed some shot upon us, and had peradventure overtaken us, if the night
had not ended their chasing us, and our dangers.

This Boat, in which we were, was an ordinary passenger between Ciprus and
Alexandretta, a small way of only a night and a half sailing, and half a
days sailing: So that by reason the Master was unlike to mistake his way,
much less so just contrary as he did, toward two hours in the night, we met
another passage-Boate, put off from Famagusta, holding the course which we
intended: The night was fair, with the shining of the moon and starlight;
yet, by reason of the difference in sailing, we first lost sight of that
Boat, then by our different course, the Master of ours, instead of
Alexandretta, going for Tripoly, which, certainly, was a great work of God to
preserve us. The other Boat, at break of the day, being taken at the entrance
of the port of Alexandretta, by certain Turkish Pirates, who put all to the
sword, that were in it, and hearing of us, we had rowed so far into the River
Orontes, before they could recover us, that they durst no further prosecute
that prey.

There we found a goodly Country, repleat even naturally with all the blessings
the earth can give to man, for the most part vncultiuated, here and there, as
it were, sprinkled with miserable Inhabitors, which in their fashion showed the
necessity they had to live, rather then any pleasure in their living.

From thence we sent our Interpretor to Antiochia, to provide us horses to
bring us thither, which he returned within two days after, and with them we
proceeded thither, full of great care how we should escape from thence: The
Turk having given certain scales to trade in, out of which, as it was
unlawful for any to converse; so it must needs be an inevitable peril for so
great a company, when the same great Providence, which at first defended us
from the former hazards, gave us the good hap to meet with two Ianizaries,
Hungarish-runnagates, who understanding that we were Christians, compelled
against our dispositions into that place, our intention to be a visitation of
Jerusalem, and with all our fear of some great prejudice by our being arrived
out of the distinguished places for all Christians; having told us first, that
they themselves had been Christians, and though they had, for reasons best
known to themselves, altered that condition; yet they wished well to those
which still were so, and especially to all of those parts: and afterward
cheerfully comforting us, invited us to lodge in their house, securing us, by
a number of protestations, from all dangers; which as they courteously offered,
so (if I may give so fair a term, to such a people) they honorably
performed: For being by the Cady of Antiochia required to present us unto him,
they did not only deny us, as bound unto it by the laws of hospitality, in
respect of their promise, as they themselves said; but called fifty other
Ianizaries of Damasco, their friends, to defend us, if the Cady should have
offered violence.

And now that I have had occasion to speak of the Ianizaries of Damasco, which
by likelihood, of that they presumed to do in that point, must be men of
great authority, both in power and estimation: It will not be amiss, to use
so fit an opportunity to discourse of the Turks whole government of those
parts, which I did not behold with the eyes of a common Pilgrim, or Merchant;
which passing only by goodly Cities and Territories, make their judgment
upon the superficial appearance of what they see: but as a Gentleman bred up
in such experience, which has made me somewhat capable to penetrate into the
perfection and imperfection of the form of the State, and into the good and
ill Orders by which it is governed. And though it be true, that my weakness
in judging may rather do harm then good, to such as will favor me with too
much belief; yet it will ever be a help of some feeling to those which know
less: Our duties being to further all, and chiefly those who have most need.

^he course of (...)s Turks ^ouernment.
The Original of the Turks many have written well of; the maintaining of their
state has been their Subects true, and deuote adherence to their religion,
without Schism or Faction; and obedience to their Princes. They increase the
same religion also, (which continually instigateth them to the propogation of
it) and the reason of their beginning, which was Arms; they, induced by a
confidence in them, have ever desired to use them. And to detain such a
stirring disposition from civil dissentions, their Princes have ever with
foreign enterprises, led them to the exercise of them. The means of the
preservation of their States so great, and so many acquisted, have been the
securest of any other: the Princes personally inhabiting of the most dangerous;
and ruinating, and possessing by Colonies actually, though in another name, the
rest. So that where the Dominion joins with the power of the Christian
Princes; his presence keeps those parts from danger of innovation: Where he
is further separated, his Tymarri, (which are certain to whom he distributeth
so much land for their desert in virtue, which was their first institution; and
by that tenure are bound to find him their persons, and so many horses in his
wars) they, I say, having their estates soly depending upon his government,
assuring him from all peril of alteration. And besides, to strengthen himself
the more, he has not only destroyed the Noble blood of the Countries; but in
most places the Cities, Towns and Houses, to remove from the very memory of
men, by the renewing of those spectacles the apprehension of their former
condition of living: and since the government of those states were so far
separated, least the mind of him, to whom he gave such an administration,
might lift it self up to higher thoughts, he changes them continually from
time, to time, without any prefixed order; and gives them by the ancient
form, which the vertuouser Princes enacted; but to men of great merit:
besides, so dissolueth all strength from their supreme authority in case of
absoluteness, that without a special commission for some special cause, the
Bassa has nothing to do with the Souldiory, but those are ordered in their
function, by either one Agam or Sarda, the Bashawes ends directing themselves
to the civil government; from the just administering of which, they were
learned heretofore, by terrible examples, not to decline; their faults being
brought speedily to the Court, the emulation of which as speedily presented
them to the Prince; the maine point of whose estate drove him to execute
rigorous remedies to confirm his awfulnesse and obedience, by which he did
subsist among his Subjects.

Those Ianizaries of Damasco, amongst other Garrisons were appointed as those
of Cairo against the invasions of the Arabs: who are, through all those
Provinces, a people dispersed, living in Tents, without a certain place of
abode, remoouing their habitations according to the seasons, and their own
commodities: part of which, who are removed on that side of Euphrates, which is
of Mesopotamia, now called Diarbe^h, are peaceable to the Turk, and not much
infestious to Trauellors; their King being a Saniacke of the Turks, and by that
title holding Ana and Der, two Towns upon the River, which pay him his stipend.

The other, upon the other side, toward Egypt, through all Arabia, Petra, and
Deserta, and spreding as far as the limits of Arabia Felix; being in
multitudes, and not possible be brought to a quiet and wel-formed manner of
living, are dangerous to strangers, and continual spoylers of those parts of
the Turks Dominions, which every way border upon them: for the safety of
which, as I said, those two garrisons of Caeiro, and Damasco were instituted,
the first of 12000, the other of 1500 Ianizaries. Neither must it be thought,
since these of Damasco do not only defend that part, but are also distributed
through other Cities of Soria, As Aleppo, Antiochia, and further in Jerusalem
also, that 1500 men are able to sustain, and answer well to such a charge.
But these being both Ianizaries, and by great services heretofore done,
proceeding also to be Tymarrie, have many followers, which do augment mightily
their number, and every year were accustomed (besides those which stayed to
preserve the country) to send great troops, not only warlikely, but
pompously provided, into Hungary: but now that through the incapacity of this
Prince presently reigning, there are extreme corruptions grown through all
the members of his estate: his subjects generally taking example of his
weakensse, and particularly his great ones, making their profit thereof. As
virtue is generally forgotten, so they which have authority, are so far from
industriating themselves to replant it, that they, making a commodity of the
ill, are ever desirous it should increase, to increase with it their gain. For
as places of government, and of all sort of administration, were anciently
given unto those, who by their worthiness grew to a condign estimation with
the Prince; This time has brought things* to another condition; that now men
are weighed by the abundance of their fortune, not of their virtue: who buying
their authority of the Prince, like Merchants, must make their profit of the
people under their charge; wherein they rather desire to be vile, base, and
offenders, then to have them of better, fitter, and honester spirits: the
gains being small, if the people were good, by a just caring for them; and
greatest, as they are by punishing, by extortion, and oppression, and also as
ill as they are by many wrongs: which the people also finding, and withal that
mischief increases, rather then diminishes; taking example from so great
patterns, add by those more wickedness to the badnesse of their own
dispositions. And as they are all made a prey to the greatest, so every one
according to his power, does deal with the lesser; like a forest of wild
beasts, living all upon rapine, without any sense of humanity, more then an
appearance.

This violent humor in them has brought disobedience (Covetousness, and
Luxury, dissoluing the bonds of all respect; our wills ever carrying us from
our selves, from all awfulnesse, and all Laws, when they are ouer-maistered by
those two mighty enemies to particular men, much more then to general states,)
So that the Princes commandment is no more esteemed in any part, far removed
from his own presence, then it fitteth with the honor and profit of him to
whom it comes. From whence have grown so many and so dangerous rebellions,
so huge wastes in Countries; and caused through all those parts those Ianizaries
(which were appointed for the safety of the provinces, and had their first
privileges, not only for a reward to their virtues; but to bind them by such
rewards, to answer the Princes confidence in them) to obey no authority which
calls them to other wars: but by combining themselves in a strength
together, to tyrannize the Countries committed to their charges: in such a
sort, that they are not only Princes, as it were, over the people, but do also
terrific the greater Ministers. And though this be a great weakness in the
very Basis of so huge an estate (which can by no means be held together but by
such an unite compaction as may justly, and ever move by the heads intentions;
lest it should sway this way, or that way; and so either break, or bend by his
own great weight, or bruise it self, which in so ouer-growne a body must come
to dangerous ulcers, where no care is taken for the curing of the parts) Yet it
does not only show, that Gods judgment has determined it a short time of
continuance, by that one great sign, but by many other: as their negligence of
the maintaining of a strenth by Sea;; which did (as it were) knit together many
great parts of it, far divided; and gave an essential strength in force and
reputation to his whole state: His want of necessary provision for the wars
in all those parts; not speaking of those for peace, sithence the ruin of the
Provinces, for the most part, and the misery of those poor flock of people,
which do live in the parts inhabited, are only the means to give him peace.
Yet the negligence of the Princes Christian will not make use of these extreme
defects of his to amplify their Dominions, to eternize their Honors; and
(that which is the greatest) to glorify God, which has made them Princes,
only to execute his judgments; (none of which now can be more justly
inflicted upon any, then upon that great blasphemer against his Holy one, and
tyrant of the world) give peace to their inique passions, which give cause to
the very earth to sigh, to all good hearts to groan, and kindle Gods
indignation against them, and their people: and turn first their aspects to
that which they owe to God; and then to the true ambition of a Prince, to do
great and just things; which with their honor might also bring profit to
their present estates; and are of such a condition, that the effecting of them
is utterly without danger, or difficulty: seeing with the very sight of a
complete Army, his Souldiary, in those parts, would be terrified, through
their inability, to resist; and the people, who cannot change possible to worse
fortune, would all follow those Ensigns, which their extremity does already
force them to wish for. And let all judgment, give themselves but a small time
of truce, with other passions; and we shall see, not only what shame it is to
the very Name of Christianity, to suffer that great Sepulcher of our Redemption
to be possessed, to our eternal ignominy, by his professed enemies, who
vouchsafed to give his dearest blood, to buy us from perdition. Religion is
that which ever moves the blindest hearts of men to the most resolute
enterprises.: and an awful love has ever been the strongest band to bind
men to their Princes, to their Country, and to common society.

Romulus, when his people fled before the Sabines; so that the victory showed
it self undoubtedly on their side, and overthrow on his: the very remembering
them of leaving Jupiter, and the rest of the Gods in the Capitol, to the
possession of their enemies, was sufficient to turn that desperate fortune.
And when the French had sacked and burnt a great part of Rome; the same awful
reverence to their Gods, and love to their Country, could bind them rather to
re-build their ruinated City, then to go to Vejes, a Town ready, and
magnificently builded. But we can leave, in the Turks possession, not only
the Country of our Savior, (which should be deerer unto us then our own, for
his great name sake;) but this the Sepulcher of his precious blood, which he
gave freely an oblation, to give us, by that sacrifice, that which is above
all, eternal life; without compunction of love or Religion. So much are our
hearts hardened against the appearing mercies of God, which has made him for a
great, a weak enemy; to give us courage by such an unhoped fore-signe, to
produce that supreme act of our duties. Where are those generous spirits of the
fore-passed Princes, and men; which against all humane reason, to revenge
injuries, and wrongs done to the holy name of God, thrust themselves into most
dangerous enterprises, only trusting in the true worthiness of their cause,
which they judged God would miraculously prosper; being undertaken with so good
and true hearts for him? The successes of which also, we may read to have
been most prosperous: God striving in mercy with man's intentions: And though
it be true, that the days of Visions, and such apparent Miracles are finished;
yet let us not, by too great preciseness, mistake the things which indeed are:
but take this for a great miracle, in regard of our manifold sins, which
deserve all bitter vengeance, and no good; that God yet has pleased, (whilst
we devour one another in this poor small; flock of Gods Church; and by our
cruelly resolving to our civil destruction, do open the breach for the common
enemy) to enlarge his power and greatness by his only breath to shake him
with such infection, that his overthrow is most facille, if we will use the
time pointed unto us by his merciful finger: which also may turn unto us as
heavy a judgment, if we do not, with the best council, and most desirous
affection of our hearts, and souls, embrace the beams of his compassion. But
since Princes hearts are in the hands of God, and he turns them either for
their own chastisements, or for those of the people, to a certain secret point
of direction, from the which they cannot divert; as those which are too great
judgments for me to penetrate into, I will leave them, and speak of my
Ianizaries rare disposition unto me; who did not only perform their promise
in defending me in Antiochia; but delivered me safely from them into our
English Consuls hands in Aleppo: from whom, and from all the Merchants there
abiding, I received such an entertainment, with so careful, so kind, and so
honorable a respect, as I must needs say, they were the only Gentlemen, or
the most benign Gentlemen that ever I met withal: For my company being so
great, that it was no light burden unto them; besides, gave an occasion to the
Turks condition of getting to make quarrels for that end: so that they were
not only at expense by defraying me and mine; but at more by preserving us
from oppression amongst them. I had not been fully one month expecting a
commodity of passage by carrauan into Persia: but that the Morizell arrived,
who presently had the advice of my being at Aleppo: And though that Hugo de
Potso threatened as much as an ill mind, and great purse could make him hope to
prevail against me by; and questionless had raised some great trouble against
me, happy d^lirance from ^ger.
if he had come safe to Aleppo: Yet ever the first providence, which saved me
before, determined so well also for me then, that four miles from Aleppo he
dyed: By which means I was preserved from peril; and those honest Merchants,
my friends, from great trouble. Neither do I speak of these strange escapings
with a vain ostentation of pride, as though I would have the world judge more
of my person, then of a most ordiry fellow; but only to example to other how
much it pleases God to favor good intentions: that those which put themselves
into the worlds dangers, may ever arm themselves with them, as the only
preservative against all sort of Inconveniences. For though in the corruption
of our nature generally, and weakness of our faith, we cannot possibly hope
to be defended by such a strong working hand, as God uses for the safety of
his Saints: yet no question good intentions have such a sympathy with Gods own
disposition, that he will both assist them which have them, for their better
encouragement, and for others example, being one of the chief means by which
he instructs the world. After 6 weeks staying in Aleppo (a wearisome time to
my self, being drawn from thence continually by the instigation of my desire,
which longed for the accomplishment of the end, that I proposed to my self:
and as chargeable a time for my friends, which would needs make me a
burdensome guest unto them) the Tafterdall, which is the Treasurer, and the
great Cady, which is, as it were, the Lord chief Justice of Babylon, arrived
at Aleppo, from thence to go by the river of Euphrates to the place of their
regiment. With those, as diverse others went, so did I also, for the more
security of my voyage (their company being ever defended, besides with the
respect of their persons, with a good company of Ianizaries) to Birr, which is
the place of imbarkment. Diverse of our Merchants brought me, and left me not
until I was boated. Thirty days we were going upon the river to Babylon,
resting every night by the shore side: In all which way we found few towns;
only Racha, Ana, Derrit, and otherwise as little habitation, except here and
there a small village: and one of better reputation, which is the landing
place, thirty miles from Babylon, called Phalugium. To tell wonders, of things
I saw, strange to us, that are borne in these parts, is for a Traveler of
another profession then I am, who had my end to see, and make use of the best
things; not to feed my self, and the world, with such trifles, as either by
their strangeness, might have a suspicion of untruth: or by their lightness
add to the rest of my imperfections, the vanity, or smallness of my
judgment. But because I was desirous to certify my self truly of the estate
of the Turk in those parts, through which I passed, understanding, where we
lodged one night, that the Camp of Aborisci, King of those Arabies, which
inhabit the desert of Messopotamia, was a mile off; I hazarded my self in
that curiosity, to go into it; and saw a poor King with a ten or twelve
thousand beggarly subjects, living in tents of black haire-cloth: yet so well
governed, that though our clothes were much better then theirs, and their want
might have made them apt enough to have borrowed them of us; we passed
notwithstanding, through them all in such peace, as we could not have done,
being strangers, amongst ciueller bred people.

That day, as it happened, was the day of Justice amongst them, which was
pretty, and warlike: Certain chief Officers of the Kings, mounting on^
horseback; armed after their manner, with their staves, targets, bows, and
arrows; and so giving judgment of all cases which the people brought before
them. The King gave us good words, without any kind of barbarous wondering, or
other distasteful fashion. But when we returned to our boat, we found the
master of his house, master of our boat; with a sort of his Arabs: and in
conclusion, we were forced to send his master three verstes of cloth of gold,
for beholding his person. This is that King of the Arabs, which I said before,
was a Saniake of the Turks; and for that place held of the Turk, Ana, and
Dirr, two Towns upon the river.

As soon as we came to Babylon, having put the stock which I had all into
Jewels, and Merchandise, to carry the fashion of a Merchant; at the Dog^na,
which is the Custom House, all (whatsoever) was stayed for the Bassa: and (as
I perceived) not so much for any great use which he meant to make of those
things; as for the suspicion which he had of me, and mine extraordinary company
bearing much cause thereof with it; and because I gave out I had more goods
coming with the carrauan by land, to bind me not to start from thence. In the
mean time, by very necessity, having left me nothing in the world; what
extreme affliction I was in, by that means, for the present; and in what just
cause of fear for the future, every man may easily judge. I had my brother
with me, a young Gentleman; whose affection to me, had only led him to that
disaster; and the working of his own virtue: desiring in the beginning of his
best years, to enable himself to those things, which his good mind raised
his thoughts unto. I had also five and twenty other, Gentlemen, for the most
part: the rest, such as had served me long; only carried with their loves to
me, into the couse of my fortune. I had no means to give them sustenance to
live, A hard distress.
and less hope to unwrap them from the horrible snare, into which I had
brought them; being far from all friends, and further from counsel, not
understanding the language of the people, into whose hands I was fallen; much
less their proceedings: only thus much I knew, they were Turks, inhumane in
their natures, and adicted to get by all means just, and unjust.

But I will leave my self a little in that great straight; and speak of
Babylon; not to the intent to tell stories, either of the huge ruins of the
first Town, or the splendour of this second: but because nothing does impresse
any thing in man's nature more, then example, to show the truth of Gods word,
whose vengeance, threatened by his Prophets, are truly succeeded in all those
parts; which were once so swollen with the pride of the greatness of their
state, which they possessed, with their felicity, their magnificencie, and
their riches; that as they were the heads of the world, by their power, and by
their excellency; so were they, by that opinion in themselves, blown up to a
conceit of eternity: As though any earthly foundation, let it be grounded
never so firmly upon council, upon force and reputation, could possibly be
perpetual.

Niniuy (that which God himself calls, that great City) has not one stone
standing, which may give the memory of the being of a Town: one English mile
from it, is a place called Mosul, a small thing; rather to be a witness of
the others mightiness, and Gods judgment, then of any fashion of Magnificency
in it self. All the ground on which Babylon was spread, is left now desolate,
nothing standing in that Peninsula, between the Euphrates and the Tigris, but
only part, and that a small part, of the great Tower; which God has suffered
to stand (if man may speak so confidently of his great impenetrable Counsels)
for an eternal testimony of his great work in the confusion of man's pride;
and that Arc of Nebuchadnezar, for as perpetual a memory of his great
idolatry, and condign punishment: nothing else showing the figure of any
thing, which has been, either of ornament, or of greatness, or of place
inhabited: So truly does God judge the huge sins of the world, and
maintains so justly the credit of his Messengers; that though they speak
great things, they never speak vain things.

The Town, which is now called Bagdat, and is on the other side of Tigris,
toward Persia (only a small suburb in the Peninsula) but removed from any
stirpe of the first; to which men pass ordinarily by a bridge of Boats, which
every night is dissolved, for fear either of the Arabs, or some storm upon
the River, which might carry away the Boats, when there were no help ready.
The buildings are after the Morisco fashion, low, without stories; and the
Castle, where the Bassa is resident, is a great vaste place, without beauty or
strength, either by Art, or Nature; the people somewhat more abstinent from
offending Christians, then in other parts, through the necessity of the trade
of Ormus: upon which stands both the particular, and public wealth of that
State. Victuals are most abundant, and excellent good of all sorts, and very
cheap; which was a mighty blessing for Me, which had nothing but a general
wardrope of clothes, ^^^ard di^esse.
not in our Coffers, but upon our backs; which we were forced to make money of
by peece-meale, according to the falling of the lot, and our necessity; and
with that lived: and if feeding-well had been all, which we had cause to care
for, we also lived well. But after one month was past, and time fastened every
man's eyes more firmly upon us; ^^strange pre^^ence.
One day a Florentine Merchant (whom I had only known in the way between
Aleppo and Babylon by a riding acquaintance) came unto me, and after a little
other discourse, told me, that there was a great muttering amongst diverse great
men there, what I was, and what my designs might be; that he found me to be
dangerously spied after: and wished me to have regard, (if not to my self) yet
to so many, which he did imagine were impawned in that misfortune by my means.
And though it were true, that he came upon the motion of an honest, pious, and
charitable heart; yet I was so fearful of an Italian Merchant, that I did
rather imagine him to be the spy, then lightly to have been an instrument of
his prevention. Therefore agreeing with him in the complement only, I answered
determinately in the rest; that I knew no just cause of peril, therefore I
feared none; and if there were any curious eyes upon me, because of the number
of my company, the Carauan coming, they should see good use made of them all:
and until that time I would have patience with their looking and speaking. Him
I thanked for his kindness, and offered my self largely unto him, as though I
had least suspected him; though in truth I did most: and most unjustly. For,
two days after he returned to me again, and as a man moved in his very soul
with anguish, told me that within ten days, the Carauan of Aleppo would
arrive; in the mean time, beseeched me, not to cover my self longer from
him, who did truly wish me well, not so much for my person (which he could
know little) but because his conceit was, that I would not have hazarded my
self in such a journey, but for some great end, which he did believe well of;
and besides, in charity to a Christian, and so many Christians with me: saying,
that there was a Carauan of Persian Pilgrims, arrived two days since from
Mecca without the Town, who were forced to take that way (though the longest)
by reason of the Plague, which reigned very exceedingly in those places, by
which they should have passed. ^^strange and ^^traordinary ^^ndnesse of a
^^orentine.
He was not ignorant of my wants, for which he also had provided; and taking
me by the hand, beseeched me again to believe him, and to go presently with
him to the carrauan: which I did, not being able to answer, through admiration
of so generous a part in him, and an amazement, with a thousand diverse thoughts
spread upon me. When I came there he brought me to a Vittorin, of whom he had
already hired Horses, Camels, and Moiles for me; and I found a Tent pitched by
his servants: and then opening his gown, he delivered me a bag of Chakins,
with these very words: The God of heaven bless you, and your whole company,
and your enterprise, which I will no further desire to know, then in my hope,
which persuades me that it is good; My self am going to China, whence if I
return, I shall little need the repayment of this courtesy, which I have done
you with a most free heart; if I die by the way, I shall less need it: But if
it please God so to direct both our safeties with good providence, that we may
meet again, I assure my self, that you will remember me to be your friend;
which is enough, for all that I can say to a man of your sort. And almost,
without giving me leisure to yield him condign thanks (if any thanks could be
condign) for so great and so noble a benefit, he departed from me: And as I
heard afterward from him by letters from Ormus, he received much trouble after
my departure, through his honorable desire to perfect the kindness which he
had begone. For imagining, that by the continual spies, which claue to my
house, that my flight could not be secret: he had no sooner left me in the
Carauan, but that he changed his lodging to mine, saying that I had done the
like to his; and went to the Cady, telling him that I was sick, desiring his
Physician to visit me, knowing well enough that the Cady had none, but only
to give color to my not appearing in the Town: The Cady answered, he was
sorry for my sickness, and would send to the Bassa for his Physician, which
Signior Victorio Speciero (for so was this honorable Florentine called) would
by no means; hoping, as he said, that my sickness would not be so great, as
would require the trouble of his Highness. By this means five days passed
before I was missed; and when I was once discovered to be gone, Fifty
Ianizaries were sent after me, to bring me back again: the carauan having
divided it self by the way, whereof one part went a visitation of a Santon in
the deserts of Samarone; and the other passed the right way for Persia, by the
Mountains governed by a Prince of the Courdines, called Cobatbeague. The
Ianizaries hearing of them to be past, and thinking that all had been so they
returned: and that noble-minded Florentine was forced to pay five hundred
Crowns, to make his peace with the Bassa.

And though it be a miserable thing for a man to grow an example in cases of
affliction, yet it is necessary that some men should be so; and because it
pleases God, that I should be one, and a great one of these: So I may also be
taken, for as great a one of his infinite mercies, and through them his direct
pleasure in what sort, he will have men govern themselves. For having
fastened my mind to that good purpose, and intermingled some particular
intentions of mine own ambitions: as God showed a sensible disposition to
favor the one; so by humbling me to the very pit of extremities, he taught me
to cast away the other; and to have my sole confidence in him, disposing my
mind to his pleasure; not to the counsel of my own frailty, which founded in
the perfectest man, moves to continual errors: not that man does not more
desire to intend good then evil, by a natural reason, (virtue being the
health of the mind, and vice the sickness, and all natures abhorring
sickness, and the destruction of nature. But the great enemy of mankind
cousoneth our weakness with a shadow, and color of good, in the very
extremest ills; and so induces us to embrace, and desire, them masked in the
appearance of good: The true effect of which we afterward feel in the
desperate working of the poison, when it has (for want of due provision) so
possessed our vital parts, that were left both to our selves, and to the
world, (to whose benefit the virtues and good parts of good men are
appropriated) and (that which is most) to God; which is the great, and only
good, to which the end of our life is, or ought to be directed.

Neither must man think that for many burdens, which God lays upon him,
that he is wholly abandoned, and so leap from an awful humility to a direct
despair of his mercies: Since God, like a great Prince, will have men his
Subjects, so truly his, that all their thoughts shall depend upon his
authority, and not upon the swollen bubbles of their own hearts. which if they
err in, humility is the true reconciliation of their offense, before that
great Judge: and desperation, a manifest token of a maine rebellious spirit;
which, reposed upon a vain assurance of himself, plungeth him in that
extremity, upon the contrary proceeding of his intentions: which are so far
from power to effect themselves by any ability in himself, that himself can
no longer subsist, then Gods providence is he should.

Finally, God is not as man, whom we may abuse, by having diverse propositions
mingled of good and bad ends: the books of our hearts being laid open before
him, in which he reads our most inward thoughts; for which we must
continually give an account, feeling the reward of our good motions by the
magnificency of his mercies and our bad by the infliction of calamites; which
we may avoid, if we will understand God and our selves; which we may ever do
by making the best use of the wisdom which we have borne in our selves; by
learning of other; and exercitation; which are the acquisters of all Sciences:
amongst all which, none is so great in it self, nor so greatly importing man.
And though many, in the misunderstanding of the world, are acounted learned
and wise without it; let them know, that such are like untimely fruit, which
carry with them a temporal wonder, raised through the ignorance of other,
which put no distinction between the effects of the world, and the workings of
God, when there is so great a one, as permanency in the last, and no more but
apparition in the other, showing it self, and dissoluing without, almost, any
memory, that any such thing was: which should make the judgment of men not to
proceed to their absoluteness, by beholding the present fortune of any; but
first see the end which God has appointed him unto; and then to give a
diffinitiue sentence; in which they cannot err, drawing their judgment from
his, who never erreth. Of most part of which things (as I said) I may be a
most present, and a most certain example, both of the mutablenesse of fortunes
workings, of the causes, (which I confess freely) of Gods infinite mercies,
and of his order of government, under which he disposes men's actions. And
though I had, through the sencible apprehensions of such great lessons, given
me by so diverse judgments, thrown away all other opinions, then those, which
had their aspects only turned to the promotion of his glory: Yet my frailty
gave me a continual terror during those thirty days in which we wandered with
that company of blind Pilgrims through the Deserts; not knowing what God had
wrought for my security, and those which were with me, by that good man,
Signior Vittorio. At the end of which we arrived in the King of Persia's
dominions, having first passed a great tract of good and ill Countries, the
desert places of which being only sand, gave no means for inhabitants to
live: the fruitfuller parts were used by certain people, called Courdines,
living in Tents, knowing no other fruit of the earth, but what belonged to the
sustenance of their cattle, upon the milk, butter, and flesh, of which they
live, ruled by certain particular Princes of their own, which give partly an
obedience to the Turk, and part to the Persian, as they are nearest the
Confines of the one or the other. Yet in that simplicity of living (not being
without that contagion of all Mankind, of all Provinces, and of all States,
ambition of getting superiority, and larger Dominion) some wars daily grow in
amongst them, even to the extirpation of a whole Nation: As we found freshly,
when we passed by one of those Princes, called Hiderbeague, all whose people
were deuored by the sword, or carried away captive, by Cobatbeague: and
himself remained, only with some twenty souls, in certain poor Holds in a
Rock.

The precise sum, which I received of the Florentine, I set not down, to
prevent the scandales of diverse, who measuring every man's mind by the
straightness of theirs, will believe no act, which does not symbolize with
themselves: but so much it was, that being thirty days upon the way to the
Confines; then fifteen from the Confines to Casbine, where we attended one
month the Kings arrival; it was not only sufficient to give us abundant
means for that time, but to cloth us all in rich apparel, fit to present our
selves before the presence of any Prince, and to spend extraordinarily in
gifts, by which we insinuated far into the favor of those, which had the
authority of that Province, during our abode, and expectation of the Kings
coming: In which time we were well used, more by the opinion, which they had,
that the King would take satisfaction by us, then by their own humors; being
an ill people in themselves; and only good by the example of their King, and
their exceeding obedience unto him. The Governor visited me once;
Marganabeague, master of the Kings house, (whom I had won unto me by presents)
came oftentimes to see me: besides (as it seemed) being more inwardly
acquainted with the Kings inclination, fitted himself more to that, then
others did, which knew it less.

And now that Iam in Persia, and speak of the kings absence; since he is both
one of the mightiest Princes that are, and one of the excelle^test, for the
true virtues of a Prince, that is, or has bin; and having come to this
greatness, though by right; yet through the circumstances of the time, and the
occasions, which then were, solely his own worthiness, and virtue, made way
to his right: besides, the fashion of his government differing so much from
that which we call barbarousnesse, that it may justly serve for as great an
Idea for a Principality, as Platoes Commonwealth did for a Government, of that
sort. I hold it not amiss to speak amply first of his person, the nature of
his people, the distribution of his government; the administration of his
justice, the condition of the bordering Princes, and the causes of those
wars, in which he was then occupied; that by the true expression of those,
this discourse may pass with a more lively, and more sensible feeling.

His person then is such, as a well-vnderstanding Nature would fit for the end
proposed for his being, excellently well shaped, of a most well proportioned
stature, strong, and active; his color somewhat inclined to a man-like
blackness, is also more black by the suns burning: his furniture of his
mind infinitely royal, wise, valiant, liberal, temperate, merciful, and an
exceeding lover of Justice, embracing royally others virtues, as far from
pride and vanity, as from all unprincely signs, or acts; knowing his power
justly what it is; and the like acknowledgement will also have from others,
without any gentilitious adoration; but with those respects, which are fit for
the majesty of a Prince; which foundeth it self upon the power of his state,
general love, and awful terror. His fortunes determining to make proof of his
virtue, drove him (in his first years) into many dangerous extremities; which
he ouercomming by his virtue, has made great use of, both in the excellent
increase of his particular understanding, and general tranquillity, strength of
his country, and propagation of his Empire. For the laws, and customs, or
both, of that kingdom, being such, that though the king have a large increase
of Issue, the first borne only rules; and to avoid all kind of cause of civil
dissension, the rest are not inhumanly murdered, according to the use of the
Turkish government, but made blind with burning basins: and have otherwise all
sort of contentment and regard fit for Princes children. Xa-Tamas King of
Persia dying without Issue, Xa Codabent, his brother, was called blind to the
kingdom; who had Issue, Sultan Hamzire Mirza the eldest, who succeeded him,
and this present King called Abas. In the fathers time Sinan Bas^a began the
enterprise of Persia (which the Turks ever reserve in their times of peace
with the Christians, to keep their souldiary in action, and their arms from
rusting) Before he could attempt any important action, he was called to the
port, and advanced to be principal Viseire: and Mustapha Bassa was appointed
his successor, whose industry and valor was accompanied with good fortune, in
a short space taking Vannes and Tiphelis, two strong fortresses, and importing
much for the entrance of Scieruan; which he with the like felicity conquered.
Notwithstanding Synan taking advantage of some sinister accident, happened him
by ouer-sight (which is ever most incident to those which sway all things with
a happy course of fortune) and being his enemy, bearing his suppositions also
against him, by the strength of his authority, caused him to be re-called in
the fair course of his victory; and being within some few days travel of
Constantinople, whether the cause grew from the pride of his heart, which
despised to live after such an injury received from his enemy, whose fortune
being so great, gave him neither means, nor hope of revenge; or else for fear
of death and disgrace together, at the Port, he poisoned himself. Into whose
place was advanced Osman Bassa, a great Soldier (borne of that Mamaluckes
blood, who had been last Sultan of Egypt) in great estimation with the
generalty of the Turks, and as much with the Prince himself; not only through
his own valor, which in truth did merit it; but by his mothers favor, who
was great with the Prince, and with the Sultana his mother. He instantly
acquitted all disorders grown, either by the death or negligence of Mustapba;
and intending utterly to subdue all Persia, and to extinguish the reign of the
Sophies; judging that the shortest way was to begin with the best parts, went
presently against Tauris: and though he were long impeached from taking of it,
both by the resolute valor of the Defendants, which was all the obstacle in
the place, the walls being only of mud, without art, or strength, and by
continual attempts of the king of Persia, sometimes in person (though he saw
nothing) but most by his eldest son to succor it: Finally after many
victories, and sometimes losses, his fortune concurring with his obstinate
resolution, he got the place; in which he had no sooner established a meet
garrison, and an order of government in the country about it, which followed
the fortune of the place; but having all his care fixed upon his design, for
the through accomplishment of his prosperous begun victory, he also died, as it
is said, poisoned by Cicala. Whiles the mother cried out at the port for
justice; and the ambition of other competitors for so great a place; and so
large a breach, already made to enter into honor by; the time ran so far in
length, that the peace brake between the Emperor and the Turk, and the wars
revived in Hungary: so that the age of the king of Persia, his being broken
with those first troubles, and suspicion of intestine, answering just to the
desire of the Turk; there was a truce concluded between those two potentates
upon no other condition; But that each should be contented with that they had.
The eldest son of the king remained at the Court of his father, administering
all that, which his fathers defect of light unabled him to do. Abas the second
son, twelve years of age, under the government of Tutors, held the province
of Yasde; and (as Courts are full of rumors, and suspicion never wants in
Princes, especially which have such imperfections, as they are compelled to
take knowledge of) the virtues of Abas, by which he bound to him the hearts of
his prouincials, spread themselves further, and so to the Court; where they were
increased to such a condition, as altered the father, and brothers rejoicing in
them, to an opinion that his winning of the affections of the people, proceeded
not from any other worthiness, but artifice; which had the intent of it
stretching to the Crown: which took such hold in the f^thers mind, worn with
age, and grief, and sore with his late misfortunes, that he resolved secretly
his death: The news of which being brought to Abas speedily by the means of
secret friends, not only to himself, but to his Governors (which as they were
the greatest of the state, so they were not vnfriended in the Court) being so
far from any such design, that he had no sort of provision at hand to defend
himself; he fled to the king of Corasan, a country of the Tartars, limiting
upon the east of Persia, ever infestu o us to that state, not more in their
own disposition, (being a people given to spoil, unquiet, and which cannot
live in rest) then through their depe^dance upon the Turk, whose religion they
profess, (which the Persians do not, but much altered) and whose petnionaries
they were, by which they were bound in all seasons, when the Turk was tied to
the Christians wars, to divert the Persian from looking to the commodity of
such a time; besides, on occasions, the Turk used to transport great forces of
them over the Caspian sea into Siruana; and from thence passed them into
Hungary; either the longer way by land, or the shorter by sea, over Negropont.
To this king Abas was exceeding welcome, and cherished, and honored like his
own son. Shortly after the flight, the father died, and Sultan Hamzire
Mirza, his son, succeeded him, who renewed the truce with the Turk, through
the necessity which he had to use the most, which his strength and power could
yield him, to suppress a great rebellion of the Turcomans: whom, at the last,
he so brake with diverse battles, and all other sort of afflictions, that they
delivered him up their Princes, and then themselves. Their Princes he beheaded,
and of them, slew twenty thousand of the ablest for the wars, assuring his
peace with them by their extremest ruin; and as he was, by all reports, a most
brave, and warlike Prince, having pacified his own state, and desirous to
recover, not only what was freshly lost; but all which was formerly taken from
the Sophies kingdom, by the power of the Ottomans; united all his thoughts,
and all his Councels to that one great end; which all finished with his life,
ending it self by treason of his Princes (not without persuasion of the Turk)
when he had fit years, mind, and courage; and means joined with ocasio^, to
have made himself the greatest Prince of many ages: all which though they made
his death miserable, yet the manner was more miserable; being vilely slain by
his Barber, retiring half drunk from a banquet, to which he was provoked by
the conspirators, which presently parted the state between them; every man
making himself absolute Prince of those provinces, which they had in
government; and parting the royal treasure amongst them for their reciprocal
maintenance, disposed themselves vnitely to resist the coming in of Abas; whom
notwithstanding they did not much fear, having promise of the Turk that he
should be detained in Corassan where he was refuged: and knowing that he had
neither men nor money, nor years to give him any incoragement to attempt
against them, who had soon confirmed themselves, both with giving good
satisfaction to the people, and with liberality to the Souldiary; and their
entrance into the state being without opposition, and so, without offense, made
the foundation both more sure and more facile.

The Turks Council also was exceeding good for his ends; for having
dissipated the unite power of that great dominion into so many branches, which
though he knew could continue together to maintain their wrong against the
true kings right; yet that their own ambitions in short time would stir them
to debate amongst themselves: by which, as he was out of doubt of peril,
during the travels of his wars, so he was assured that at his convenient
occasion, either by their own quarrels, or by his power, they should be all
subjected to him.

Abas in the mean time, whose just Title made him king, assured himself that
both the murder of his brother, and this parting of the state, had the Turks
counsel concurring with those Princes impiety: and not doubting but the king
of Corasan was also persuaded to deteine him, resolved notwithstanding by his
necessity, began to deal boldly with him for his assistance against his
rebels, laying before him how preiuditiall the example was to all Princes; and
most to him who was chief of all those Tartar Princes, rather by their
voluntary election, then his states surpassing them in power; that as ambitions
were unlimited generally, so were they ever most in those, which had most power
to use them largely; that all the states of the Tartars were held by great
Princes, and absolute, which had obeyed him so long, rather because they would,
then they could do no other. If this rebellion of natural subjects proceeded
to a happy course, much more would they be animated to do the like which were
Lords, and no subjects: besides, though the counsel of the Turk had not
palesated it self openly, yet in all judgment it might be perceived, that he
had only raised this, as a Pageant, to fill the world with gazing, whilst he
fitted his designs to impatronize himself of the state; which if he should
do, how terrible a neighbor he would be to the King of Corassan, he submitted
to his wise consideration. For himself, that he had bin so bound to him in his
first calamity, that without other re asons, he did not doubt but the same
royal and generous spirit, which moved him then to take compassion of him,
would also move him to the like now: And the more, having greater hopes of
means for a grateful acknowledgement from him; which he which had the
management so long of his disposition could not doubt of; and if he had begun
to persuade him with other reasons, he did it rather in the duty of a true
friend, to lay before him his own interest, then in any diffidence of his free
inclination to his good. Whereupon the king of Corasan, though pre-occupied by
the Turk, yet desirous to be his friend a far off, and also doubting the
success of Abas, neither having years, nor experience, nor friends; In fine,
being destitute of all reasonable hope, not to move the Turks displeasure upon
such a disaduantagious condition, was notwithstanding contented to see whether
something might be moved by such a help as should not appear to given by him,
but rather voluntary followers of Abas his fortune: he gave him three thousand
horse only to put him in possession of that state, which by his virtue, and
fortune, is grown now so great, that it has devoured all the states of the
Tartars, extended it self so far as Cabull to the East; the Arabian gulf
down to Ballsarack on the South; within three days journey of Babylon on the
West; and to Tauris on the North; embracing the whole circumference of the
Caspian sea unto Astracan, which is the uttermost of the Moscouites Dominion,
and Seruane of the Turks, which lies upon that sea: an Empire so great, so
populous, and so abundant; that as it may compare with most of the greatest
that ever were, so is it terrible to the Turks, which is the greatest that now
is; though I do think verily, That in Asia the Persian has as great an
extent of Territories, as the Turk, and better inhabited, better governed, and
in better obedience, and affection, I am sure he has. With this small troop,
the King of Persia, guided by his infinite Royal courage, entered Persia. But
as those which are wicked, are ever so well instructed in the Art of their
profession, that they never want instruments in themselves to devise, and in
others to act those counsels which must ever be waking, to maintain what they
have gotten by their sceleratenesse: So their Spies hastened, with such
diligence, to give those Rebels notice, of their Kings being on foot, that
the next of them to him, had time to arm great forces, and incountred him in a
Province, called Sistane: and though his invincible spirit, without any spark
of fear, made him adventure to fight upon so vn-equall terms, as was three
thousand against twenty thousand; he found by his experience, that Majesty and
right, is nothing without power to bear them up: and that no exquisite vigor
of the mind, can resist the violence of sinister fortune, nor oppression of
many hands. Yet did fortune so much care (for so great virtue) that she gave
him way to escape to to the Mountains, all the rest of the small troop being
cut in pieces.

This victory assured the Rebels (as they thought) from all further danger;
supposing that these small forces, were all, which then their King could, or
hereafter should be able to lead against them: Imagining that the King of
Corrasan, if he would have succored him indeed, that he would never have cast
a way those few, to increase the strength of their foundation, and to diminish
the others reputation, which is so effectual in a not well confirmed Princes
first actions, especially in a Prince who must come to his right by his virtue
and fortune. But the King of Persia, whose own mind ever comforted him, with
a steadfast assurance of his greatness, to which he is now grown, having
recovered the Mountains, lived amongst the Heardes-men for three months,
unknown, changing continually, from place to place, without any certain
abode, accompanied only with ten or twelve followers, which were of his first
Governors, and other young Gentlemen brought up with him from his childhood.

But being now no longer able to temporize with his great desire, resolving to
prove the last, and the uttermost of his fortune, and remembering how much love
and affection those of Yasd had showed toward him in the time of his governing
them, and how much he had truly deserved of them, determined to show himself
in that Province; and prove what effect the Majesty of his person, the justice
of his cause, and former obligation would work in them: which, though it were
a foundation proved ever false, almost by all experiences, The peoples
affections ever raising men's hopes, and ruining their persons: Yet it proved
otherwise with this King; who was no sooner certain known in those parts, but
numbers of people came flocking to him, armed and appointed for the wars: in
such sort, that before any provision could be made against him (this being an
accident so far removed from all sort of suspicion) he had a power together,
too strong to be easily suppressed; which was no sooner heard by Ferrat Can, a
great Prince, and discontented with the alteration of the government (to whose
share none of that partition had fallen, his fortune being such, that at the
time of the other Kings death, he had none of the Provinces to administer, and
they were parted only between them, which held them) he I say, with his
brother, and a company of some ten thousand, came and joined themselves to the
forces of the King. Neither were the men so welcome, as that Ferrat Can, being
a wise Prince, and a great Soldier, grew a party, and such as the King also
stood in need of: Neither did the King loose any sort of opportunity, but
hearing of the Assembly which certain of the Princes were making in the
nearest Provinces unto him, with all speed fell upon them, and ouer-throwing
them followed them as far as Casbin.

In the mean time, those of Shyras, Asphaan, Cassan assisted by the Kings of
Gheylan, and Mazandran, gather mighty forces; the Turks armed at Tauris, and
the Prince of Hamadan, having called in a strength of the Courdiues, to his
assistance, was marching also toward Casbin: So that the King was likely to be
so enclosed with all these Armies, that his first victory would rather have
proved a snare to his intrapment; then important, as he hoped, to the some of
his affairs: Whence he resolved to help, with Art, that which he was much too
weak to accomplish by strength. Wherefore he leaves Ferrat Can, in Casbin
with some five thousand men, accompanied with Zulpher his brother; and
himself, with the rest of his power marched toward the Can of Hamadane.
Ferrat Can, according to the deliberation taken between the King and him,
thewed himself altered from the Kings part, writes to the Rebels, which were
all, in a gross, advanced as far, as the midway between Cassan and Casbin,
and offers not only to join that strength which he had with them, but to
mutine the Kings army, which was lodged in the Mountains toward Hammadane, in
a show to keep those straights, to give impeachment to the passage of that
other Army; but indeed to protract time only, and to expect the event of his
other counsels. The other Cans rebelled easily and desiro^sly embraced Ferrat
Cans proposition, hasted the Army toward Casbin, which they entered without
difficulty, both by the nature of the place, which is not of any strength, and
conueyance of Ferrat.

There were many days spent in Counsel, and at last it was concluded, since
the suppression of the King was certain, being abandoned by him which was his
only Captain and Counselor; by so great a part of his strength; and upon
the confidence which Ferrat gave them to mutine the rest; that it would prove
too dangerous, to call in those forces of the Turks, which were in readiness
for their succor; Not knowing whether they should so easily free themselves of
them again, if they were once entered. They feared the Turks purposes, and as
much feared to know them; therefore to avoid the danger of being compelled to
experience them, they determined to write to the Bassa of Tauris, that the war
was so certain to be finished, by themselves, that they would reserve his
favor till a more urgent opportunity: and with that deliberation a principal
man was dispatched with a present for the Bassa. Of this, the King had present
advice, by a confident messenger, and also that few nights after, the
principals of the Army were to meet together at Ferrats house, invited to a
great banquet; which being understood by him, electing five thousand of his
best men, and best horsing, with great, and close iourneies, he came to Casbin;
where having secretly disposed his people, in the Mountain, covered with the
quarter of Ferrats troop, he expected the sign which was to be given him.
The Prince (as it was appointed) failed not of coming, nor he of his sign to
the King, nor the King to accomplish his resolution: For Ferrat having
protracted the banquet the most part of the night, when the whole company was
heavy with wine and sleep, the King was received into the house with three
hundred men, where without any vp-roare, he slew all those which were invited,
to the number of three score and ten; the servants and Pages being so suddenly
taken hold of, and with such dexterity, that without any moving of other
rumors, the same fashion of feast of singing and of dancing, continued all the
night; and in that space all the rest of those people, which the King had with
him, were appointed, in the breaking of the day, to make the greatest show, and
the greatest noise that they could under the foot of the Mountain, as though
all the Army had been there, marching to the Town. When the Alarm began to
be hot in the Town, and every man fell to his Arms, and repaired to Ferrats
lodging, where they supposed their Princes to have been; the King having
disposed his three hundred men which were shut fitly in the house, and Zulpher
having his five thousand all in a Troop, in the great place, the threescore
and ten Cans heads were showed all laced upon a string, and hung out of a
Tarras; upon which the King presently showed himself, accompanied with Ferrat
Can; whereas the Majesty of the King, the terror of the sight, represented
before them, the fear of the Army, which they saw (as they thought) at hand,
Zulpher and Ferrat Cans power amongst them, which they perceived turned against
them; their being destitute of Commanders, and the guiltiness of their own
consciences, for their rebellion, stroke them into so dead an amazement, that
they stood ready, rather to receive all mischief, then that they had either
courage, or minds, or counsel to avoid it.

The King, as though he had a while advised with himself what he would both
say and do; at last after a good pause, seeming that his royal mercy had
prevailed against his just indignation; he told them, that the wickedness of
their universal conspiracy against him, was such, that he was distracted in
himself, what to say or do against them: for though they might excuse
themselves upon those Princes which had seduced them; yet they knew, that the
others authority, had no more force upon them then their own willing obedience,
which called as great a punishment upon the one, as the other. What cause they
should have, generally, to desire such an innovation of government, as they,
by their own conuenence had erected amongst them, he could not devise; his
Grandfather, Father, and Brother, having ever guided the Helm of their State,
with that integrity of justice, and that universal satisfaction, that it was
not to be wished, of any, to find more tranquillity, for those which desired to
live only quietly; nor more just measure of honor, or due reward, then was
magnificently given to those which had deserved them; and why they should have
less hope of him, he knew not, never having made, willingly, any other
demonstration of his mind, then such as might be proportionable to their best
expectations. But since his true feeling of humane frailty, made him well
understand how easy men's minds are to be abused by others artifice, and their
own corruption, he to oak so great a compassion of the calamity into which
they had, (either wilfully, or misled by others errors) cast themselves; that
if he could have any confidence, that they would truly repent of their past
wickedness, and bend their minds to serve him with a perfect heart, he could
also easily persuade himself to change the severity of the judgment, which
they had merited, into mercy, forgiveness, and forgetfulness of their
offense; and content himself, that this injurious great disorder (which had
happened, as all other of that kind do, through the ignorance of many, and malice
of few) should also be expiated by the blood of those few, who had already
concluded the greatness of their usurped authority, and their long hopes with
a short and just death.

This being spoken, by the King, with courage and majesty; and being so far
from that which their guilty consciences did cause them to apprehend, facily
brought forth the ordinary effects of a multitude, which being easily inclined
to hope more then they should, and to suffer less then is fit, as though the
King, with his royal merciful speech, had given them as great a present good,
as if he had discharged them from the terror of the punishment of almost an
unpardonable offense: cried out, let the King live, let the King live; we are
all King Abas his slaves, and will not suffer to live any of his enemies: and
there was more trouble to defend the poor people of Casbin from sacking by
them, (their Town ever having been a wel-disposed harbor for the Rebels) then
to turn their hearts and arms to the Kings part. Besides the succors which
the Kings of Gheylan and Mazandran had sent the Rebels, were with great
difficulty saved, and returned to their countries by the King of Persia, with
commandment to tell their Masters, that as the poor men were not culpable,
which obeyed their Princes authority, by whom they were sent against him, and
for that innocence, he had given them their lives; so that he would not be
long from seeking his revenge upon their Masters, which had more justly
deserved it, by his never provoking them to any offense. And when he came with
his Army thither, he would prove, by those men's acknowledgement unto him,
whether they could discern by the benefits they had already recieued of him
in the gift of their lives, which they had forfeited unto him, by bearing Arms
with Rebels against him, what better hopes they might conceive of him, if they
would dispose themselves to deserve good of him.

In this mean time, the same of this great success, flew to both the Armies
about the Mountains of Hamadan: which, as it comforted the Kings with
exceeding ioyfulnesse; so it entered into the others with such a terror, that
they presently vanished, every man retyring to his best known safe-gard, that
part of the war ending with the blast only of the fortune of the other, with
little expense of time, labor, and blood: which being understood by the King,
he raised Oliuer-Dibeague to the title of a Can, and sent him, with those
forces which he had, to Hamadan, to settle the Country in a good form of
government, and to ease it from the oppression of the other dispersed troops.
Zulpher he also called Can, and sent him to Ardoutle which frontireth upon
Tauris, with an Army consisting of twenty and four thousand men, in show to
quiet the Country, but indeed, to prevent any moving of the Turks. And
because he knew, that as his state stood then weak, raised (as it were)
freshly from a deadly sickness, it was not fit for him (at that time) to
bind himself to wrestle with such an enemy, by taking knowledge of his ill
disposition toward him; he dispatched Ambassadors to Constantinople, to
Tauris, and to the Bassa of Babylon, to congratulate with them, as with his
friends, for the felicity of his fortune; and to strengthen himself, by
alliance, also the more firmly, against the proceeding of any thing which the
Turk might design against him, either then or in future time; he required the
daughter of Simon Can, one of the Princes of the Georgians, to wife, which was,
with as ready an affection performed, as demanded.

Whiles that Lady was coming from her father, the King understanding that the
Cans son of Hisphaean held yet strong the Castle, and whether he gave it out
to amaze his Army, which now began to look for satisfaction, for the great
travels and dangers which they had passed, or whether he had heard so indeed;
true it is, that he gave out, that the most part of the treasure of the former
Kings of Persia, was, by the consent of the Rebels, for security, kept together
in that Castle: to receive the which, and to chastise that Rebel, the King
marched thither with a part only of his Army, leaving the rest at Casbin,
which was Frontier to Gheylan, against which his purpose carried him. Without
much trouble, he expugned the Fort at Hisph^^an, being a large circumference
only of Mud-wals, some what thick, with Towers, and certain ill battlements,
and suppressed that Rebel; but Treasure he found none, for the indignation
whereof, he made the world believe, he dismantled the Castle. His own
necessity to content the Army, and his Armies necessity to ask contentment,
drew him suddenly back from thence to Casbin, where he had not stayed many
days, (for daily satisfaction with hope having no real means) but that the
Queen arrived, honorably accompanied with 2000 horse, and Byraicke Myrza her
brother. The Marriage was soon dispatched, those countries using few
ceremonies in such cases: and God blessed them both so happily, that within the
term of less then one year, she brought him a gallant young Prince who is
now living, called Sophir Mirza.

The King unwilling to oppress his country, and desiring to revenge himself
upon the kings of Gheylan, and Mazandran, to enlarge his Empire, and to content
his Soldiers; having a flourishing Army, both in men, and the reputation of
his present victory; resolved, all under one, to increase his stare, honor
himself, ease his country, and satisfy his Soldiers with the enemies
spoils. Gheylan is a country cut off from Persia, with great mountains, hard
to pass, full of woods (which Persia wants; being here and there only
sprinkled with hills, and very penurious of fuel, only their gardens give them
wood to burn, and those hills, which are some fagots of Pistachios, of which
they are well replenished) between those hills there are certain breaches,
rather then valleys; which, in the spring, when the snow dissolueth, and the
great abundance of rain falls, are full of torrents; the Caspian sea
includes this Country on the East: between which and the hills, is a
continuing valley, so abounding in Silk, in Rice, and in Corn, and so
infinitely peopled, that Nature seems to contend with the peoples industry;
the one in sowing of men, the other in cultiuating the land; in which you shall
see no piece of ground which is not fitted to one use or other: their hills also
(which are rocks toward Casbin) are so fruitful of herbage, shadowed by the
trees, as they show, turned toward the sea, that they are ever full of
cattle, which yields commodity to the country, by furnishing diverse other
parts. In this then lay the difficulty most of the kings enterprise, how to
enter the country: for the rest there were great reasons of his hopes, the
kings of those countries being amazed with these first great successes of the
king of Persia, their people discouraged, many Princes, which though they might
unite themselves against a common enemy, yet their deliberations could not be
so speedy, as from one alone, nor so firm; many accidents happening, which
might either absolutely dis-ioyne, or divert them one from the other, or cast
suspicion amongst them, which might give the way to a good occasion against
one, by which the victory against the other might be also facilitated: Besides,
his own Army was so much raised in courage by their last happy successes, and
those so animated, through an opinion in themselves, of that reputation which
had first followed the King, and the rest so desirous to wash away the ignominy
of their offense, by some great and good act, joined to the hope of rich
preyes; that there could be almost thought of no obstacle able to withstand
their valor and willingness.

Yet before the king would enter into this action, remembering, that before he
had better settled himself in his own state, that he thrust himself upon a
cast of fortune, to seek after the winning of others; yet since he was forced
unto it, by a certain great necessity, he resolved to take the best ways for
the securing all dangers which might rise against himself at home; and setting
his country in a reposed state, from so many tempests, which had contrarily
moved it, as well as to make due and confident provisions for his intended
wars. First then he called unto him to Casbin, all governors, and all
administrators of Justice, whosoever had occupied those functions, during the
usurped rule of the Cans, through all his provinces; with the kinsmen, friends
and children of the said Cans: besides, that all men of power, as Mirzaes,
Cans, Sultans, and Beagues, which are principal Titles of Dukes, Princes, and
Lords, should repair thither, without excuse of age, The means which K. Ab^
settled the qu^ et of Persia.
sickness, or any other pretense whatsoever: which being done, he appointed
new Governors and Officers of all sorts; he cleared all his provinces for three
years, from paying any tribute-custome, or any other ordinary or extraordinary
exaction whatsoever. His chief Viseire he made one Haldenbeague, a wise man,
excellently seen in all affairs, of great experience; but such a one as was
only his creature, without friends or power: him he commanded to pass
through all his provinces, accompanied with the Xa-Hammadaga; who is, as it
were, Knight Marshall, to clear them from vagabonds, robbers, and seditious
persons. Ologonlie, which had followed him in all his adversity (a man of great
worthiness) he made bearer of his great Seal, which is an office there, liker
the Lord privy Seal, then Chancellor (The place of the Viseire comprehending
in it, the office of Chancellor, and high Treasurer) him he also advanced to
the dignity of a Can. Bastana, an ancient approved man, both for fidelity and
other worthiness, he made principal Aga of his house; which is as great
Chamberlain. Curtchibasschie Captain of his Guard, which is a general-ship of
twelve thousand shot, who attend at the Port by turns, two hundred and fifty
every quarter; except when the King goes to the wars, that they are all
bound to be present. Ferrat Can he made his General.

Thus having wisely and prouidently placed, through all his estates, those who
must be most assured to him, their fortunes depending only upon him, having no
more strength, nor authority in themselves, then they received from him: and
having all the great ones in his Army with him, or such of them as could not
be able to follow him, either by their few, or many years, or sickness, so
securely left at Casbin, that they could not by themselves, or any other, move
any innovation. And moreover, having dispatched all those, and keeping their
persons with him which had any obligation to the former Cans, secured by that
means (as much as the counsel of any man could secure him) from peril at
home: having called Oliver di Can from Hamadan, and appointed him a successor
for that Government with ten thousand new men; he set himself forward to his
enterprise, with his old Troops, and great part of his rebelled Army, with no
greater courage and counsel then fortune: for those men which were remitted by
him to Gheylan, and Mazandran, (as those which had been somewhat exercised in
the wars) having, with some more, adioined unto them the guard of the
straights, from which the maine Army of the Kings was some four leagues
removed (remembering the benefit of the King, better then their faith to their
Princes) at the very sight of the first Troops, retired themselves from the
places left to their confidence in charge; which advantage being followed by
Ferrat, with the Alarm given, fell so justly upon that Army, that what with
the unexpected terror of the straights abandoning, and their being surprised in
disorder, the Army was facily broken, with the death of two of the Kings, and
an infinite slaughter of people, which had been much greater if the woods had
not covered them from the fury of their enemies. The greatest of those kings
having escaped with much difficulty (accompanied ever with the terror of the
peril from which he had escaped) never ended his flight, until he came into
Seruane; and from thence went to Constantinople, to desire succor from the
Turk, where he yet lives. The other, which remained, being but one, without
any great difficulty, or alteration of fortune, was suppressed.

The Country being first spoiled, and ransomed at a great rate, which they
might well bear, by reason of their great riches, which they had gathered
together through a long peace, and the Kings Army excellently well satisfied;
he dispatched, instantly, Ambassadors to the Turk, the Georgians and his old
friend, the King of Corassan, to give them an account of this new victory: not
doubting, but as it would be exceeding pleasant to some; so it would be as
bitter to others: and leaving Ferrat Can to govern the Country, and Oliver
Dibeague, as his assistant, but to be commanded by him, he returned himself
full of glory, and great victory into Persia, disposing himself to reduce his
state to that excellent form of government which now it has.

First then, after his arrival in Casbin, having heard by his Viseire, and the
relation of Xa-Hammadaga, of some who had not only spoiled the Subjects in
their substances; but the country of all orders, and just form of government,
which now it has; and given them, by that means, more matter of disunion,
then union; insomuch, that they were full of thieves, of vagabonds, of factions,
and such like insolences: he judged it fit, to reduce it the more peaceable
and obedient, to give it in those cases, a good condition of government:
Whereupon, he presently dispatched that Xa-hammadaga, a terrible, and resolute
person, with full power and authority, for the reformation of those disorders;
who in short time, though with most terrible examples, reduced all the
Provinces to a unite tranquillity, with mighty reputation.

Whilst he was busied in that administration; the King, to show that it was
necessity, that counseled to give him that excessive authority, and to
preserve it from being odious to himself, appointed in the chief city of
every Province, a Governor elected of those of most valor: to him he joined
two Judges of criminal and civil causes, a Treasurer, two Secretaries, with
an excellent president, and two Advocates general, for the causes both
particular and general of the whole Province; Besides the particular Advocate
of every City, which should be resident in that Metropolis. These determined
all causes within themselves of those Provinces in which they had the
administration; and because they should neither be burdensome to the
Provinces, nor corrupted in paritializing; the King paid them their stipend,
enioyning them upon pain of life to take no other sort of reward. And because
such things, and causes might fall out, as by reason of the importance of them,
or appellations of the parties might be brought before himself, because he
would ever know what he did, and be continually informed, not only of the
general state of the Provinces, but of their particular administration; he
ordained Posts once every weeks from all parts, to bring all sort of relations
to the Court; for which cause also he willed that one of the two general
Advocates should ever be resident there, who receiving those relations
presents them to the Viseire, and he to the King. The Viseire, sits every
morning in counsel about the general state of all the Kings Provinces,
accompanied with the Kings Council, Advocates resident, and the Secretaries of
State; there are all matters heard, and the opinions of the Council written by
the Secretaries of State; then after dinner, the Council, or such a part of
them as the King will admit, present those papers, of which the King pricketh
those he will have proceed; the rest are cancelled; which being done: the
Council retire them again to the Viseirs, and then determine of the
particular business of the Kings house. The King himself every Wednesday,
sits in the Council publicly, accompanied with all those of his Council,
and the foresaid Advocates: thither come a flood of all sorts of people, rich
and poor, and of all Nations without distinction, and speak freely to the
King in their own cases, and deliver every one his own several Bill, which
the King receives; pricketh some, and rejects other, to be better informed
of. The Secretaries of State presently record in the Kings Book those which he
has pricked, with all other acts, then by him enacted; the which book is
carried by a Gentleman of the Chamber, into his Chamber, where it ever
remains: and woe be to his Viseire, if after the King has pricked, Bill, or
Supplication, it be again brought the second time.

When he goes abroad to take the air, or to pass the time in any exercise,
the poorest creature in the world may give him his Supplication: which he
receives, reads, and causes to be registered; and one request, or
complaint, is not, ordinarily, brought him twice: and though these be great
ways, wise ways, and just ways, to tie unto him the hearts of any people;
yet the nature of those is so vile in themselves, that they are no more, nor
longer good, then they are by a strong and wisely-tempered hand made so: The
Country not being inhabited by those nobly-disposed Persians, of which there
are but a few, and those few are as they ever were: But being mightily wasted
by the inundation of Tamberlaine, and Ismael afterward making himself the head
of a Faction, against the Ottomans, and by that reason, forced to re-people his
Country to give himself strength of men against so potent an Adversary,
calling in Tartars, Turcomans, Courdines, and of all scum of Nations; which
though they now live in a better country, yet have not changed their bad
natures: though as, I said, so careful and true Princely a regard of the King
for the establishment of good and just orders, for the government of this
Country, in equity, general security, and tranquillity; had been of
sufficient ability to have bound the hearts of people unto him: Yet knowing
what his were, and to leave no means vnacted which might both assure them
more, and himself with them; because he knew, that their own dispositions,
which were evil, would never, rightly, judge of the cause of many rigorous
examples that had passed, which by that fault in them, had engendered him hatred
amongst them; to purge their minds from that sickness, and gain them the
more confidently, he determined to show, that if there were any cruel act,
brought forth, it did not grow from himself, but from necessity. Wherefore he
displaced, by little, (finding particular occasions daily against some or
other) all the whole Tymarri of his estate; as though from them had grown all
such disorders, as had corrupted the whole government, sending new ones, and a
great part of them Gheylaners to their possessions, with more limited
authority, and more favorable to the people; the old ones part he casherd,
part he distributed in Gheylan and Mazandran, which he had new conquered: so
that by that Art, the people began to rest exceeding well satisfied, and
himself the more secured; those which succeeded them being bound to his
fortune; and those which were removed also, being disposed in the new conquered
Provinces, which they were bound to maintain in security, for their own
fortunes, which depended only upon their preserving them for the King.

When all these things were done, and the King began to think himself,
thoroughly established, for a long time, both from intrinsicke and extrinsicke
dangers, The Turks forces being so occupied in the wars of Hungary, that he
had no leisure to look to his increasing; the Tartarres of Corrasan, his
friends, by the old hospitality which he had received from their King; and if
not his friends, yet cold enemies, such as would be long resolving, before
they would attempt any thing to his prejudice: There fell out a new occasion to
trouble, both the peace of his mind and Country, if it had not been
prevented with great dexterity, celerity, and fortune. For Ferrat Can, not
regarding his benefits done to the King, knowing too well his own
worthiness, and attributing unto that, the successes of all the kings
fortunes, and for so great causes, not being able to limit his mind within any
compass of satisfaction, not resting contented with the place of General, nor
Government of Gheylan, nor with the honor to be called the Kings Father, but
despising that Haldenbeague should be Viseire, and not himself all; which had
given the king all; began to take counsel, to innouate, and alter things with
the Bassaes of Seruan, and Tauris. So dangerous are too great benefits from a
subject to a Prince, both for themselves and the Prince, when they have their
minds only capable of merit, and nothing of duty.

These practices of his, were most dangerous, for which he did more assure
himself, to have laid a strong foundation for the coffeehouse of those
Timari which the King had sent into his Government; and so had they been,
questionless, if Oliver di-Can, through his true zeal to his Masters
service; and, perhaps, a little envy at the others greatness, had not made
him so watchfully diligent, that having gathered his intentions by very
momentuall circumstances, he gave the King, from time to time, notice of them;
which at the first were negligently received, and rather taken as matter of
emulation, then truth: But when those very same aduertisements ever continued,
and Oliver di Can, was not at all terrified from sending of them; neither by
the kings neglecting them, nor rebuke, and that Mahomet Shefia was also
secretly arrived in the Court, with more particular and certain advice, that
the Bassa of Seruan had sent a great sum of money to Ferrat, which was
received on a certain day, and in a certain place. The king hereupon
presently sent Xa-Tamascoolibeague, his chief favorite, to will Ferrat Can,
for very important affairs, for the determining of which his presence was
requisite, to repair to the Court; which he excused, through his
indisposition, which he said to be such, that he could not possibly travel:
so that persisting in that denial, when Xa-Tamas Coolibeague perceived that he
would not be persuaded, he returned with all expedition to the king; who
assuring himself the more by the denial, of the former related accusations,
instantly commanded his guard of twelve thousand Courtchies to be in a
readiness; with which, and a thousand of the Xa-Hammagaes he used such
celerity, that he prevented the news of his coming, and was sooner arrived at
Ferrats house then he had almost opinion that his messenger had been returned:
yet, although amazed with his own guiltiness, and the kings sudden coming,
he made shift to make great show of the indisposition which he had so long
counterfeited.

The king, as soon as he came unto him, said; that he had taken a great
journey to visit him in his sickness, and to bring him the cure thereof; and
having commanded all out of the Chamber, but themselves only alone (as the
king himself told me) he used such like speeches unto him: Father, ^he kings
gra^^us speech Ferrat.
I do acknowledge, that first from God, then from you, these fortunes which now
I have, have received their being; And I know, that as a man, I may both err
in my merit to God, and in my well deserving of your service. But my intention,
I can assure you, is most perfect in both: the time of my establishment in my
estate, has been so small, that I could scarce use it sufficiently to
perform my general duty toward my people, over whom (by Gods permission) I
am appointed; much less to provide for every particular satisfaction, as I
mind, and will do; which you principally, as a Father to me, both in your
years, and my election should have borne withal. But since some ill spirit
has had power to mis-leade your wisdom, so far as to make you forget your
great virtue; you shall once receive wholesome counsel from me, as I have done
often from you: And because that all counsels, as well in public, as private
deliberations, require a reposed spirit, free, and pure from wrath, fear, all
perturbation or particular interest; for a troubled mind is more apt to err,
then to aduse justly, and has more need of proper medicines for it self, then
it has properly in it self to apply any comfort to others; and is fitter to
receive, then to give counsel: from which, as from a great and violent
current, are carried all those errors and disorders which are brought upon rash
deliberations, the which have ever long repentances, and disasters, as the
perpetual memories of their having been; and are most of all detestably
blameable, when such an imprudency is accompanied with that infinite damage, as
to think of alteration in a state, which cannot proceed without in-iustice,
seeleratenesse, blood, and a thousand mischiefs: an act in it self wonderful
difficult, wonderful wicked, and proceeding from an incomparable vile quality.
But he that can restrain himself from being transported by intemperate
apetites, and can dominate his passions, and give a just rule to himself, to
his cupidities and desires, does ever give the best time to all deliberations,
by mittigating heat and fury; and so alters all counsel, from that nature
which it receives, from an unquiet and troubled mind: Which if you had done,
you would not have entered into a thought only of so dangerous an action
against your self, nor so dishonorable as to have machinated the ruin and
trouble of your own King, Friend, and Country; which though it be palesated,
it is but to my self only, who rather desire to chastise you as a friend, with
good admonition, then by rigor. Therefore, though it be ever incident to all
men, to have this great defect, to fear chiefly nearest dangers, and to
esteem much less, then they ought, of the future: Yet be you most assured,
that the peril which you might fear from my person, is much less then that
which you had thrown your self into, if you had, or should prosecute your
enterprises. From my person you shall never, (except by great constraint from
your self) look for any thing of other condition, then a true Princely love,
and a Royal regard of your services: In the other course, you called against
my will, upon your self, the rigor of Justice, and fury of the sword, which in
the war consumes all alike. And because in that adversity which a man's mind
brings upon himself, the fears and terrors are ever greater then the evils
which concur with them; be you of good comfort without the feeling only of
any such conditioned thing, and call strength from your mind to your body,
that you may endure to go with me to Hisphaan, where you shall have cause to
digest all these melancholies. Ferrat neither excused, nor confessed; but
indifferently answered the king, as sorry to have given cause of offense, and
infinitely rejoicing (as he seemed) that the king had so royally pacified
himself with him: and not daring to refuse to go with the king, desired him to
use some few days in the visiting of the Country; in which time, he hoped
that God, and the comfort of his presence, would raise him from his infirmity.
The king certainly (as I before said) was by all necessity in the world, either
forced to execute him, or to reco^cile him perfectly unto him: for any middle
course had but made him desperate, and aggrauated all sort of peril, which he
might have feared from him; his services already done, his valor and virtue
were of great moment to persuade the king to the easier way; being joined to
his own excellent mind, which I have seen the rarest proofs of, that may be
brought forth by Prince, or man living.

But Ferrat Can (who knew, that true justice never weighs offenses, and
deserts, but severally, and without intermingling them together, rewards the
one, and chasticeth the other; and that benefits are more easier forgotten,
then injuries) feeling the weight of his offense, and measuring the kings heart
by his own, gave the wickedness of his mind power over his virtue; And,
though he seemed altered to all good intentions, yet his heart was still
swollen with that poison which shortly brought him to destruction. The king
having staid some eight, or ten days in the Country, was sooner hastened
thence, then he thought, by the news of the Queens death, who was deceased
by a sudden and violent sickness, after his departure: so that with great
speed, taking Ferrat with him; and leaving Lieu-tenant in the Country, for
Ferrat, Mahomet Shefia, he returned to Hisphaan; where, after some days spent
in sorrow, for his great loss, he sent to Alexander, the other Can of the
Georgians, to demand his daughter, by that means to bind again that league,
which might have been dissolved by the death of the other Queen: In that
Embassage went Xa-Tamas Coolibeague, who returned with the Lady within few
months.

In the mean time, the brother to that king of Corasan, who had so royally and
carefully brought up the king of Persia, when he fled from the wrath of his
father, rebelled against his brother, slew him, and all his children; but only
one; whose tutors fled with him into the mountains, and so escaped the present
danger, and persecution of that tyrant. Diverse other also, as they had been in
estimation or favor with the old king, fearing for that, the violence of the
present authority, and others, only discontented with the alteration, and the
wicked means of it, fled into Persia; by whom the king having largely and
perfectly understood the state of things, having so fair a way both to show an
infinite royal point of gratitude to that one poor posterity of the murdered
king, for great obligations to the father; and withal, to assure himself in
future times and occasions, from that certain enemy, which had ever hung, like
a dangerous cloud over his state, usually breaking into terrible tempests, as
it was, or should be carried against him by the breath of the Turk: though he
knew those Tartars so obstinate enemies to his Government, and Religion, that
if they had the most odious reasons of disunion amongst themselves, yet that
they would combine against him; without reposing himself upon any hope to be
helped by those partialities, which the refuged unto him seemed to promise; but
confident only in the justice of the cause which he intended, in his own
force, virtue, wisdom and fortune; he resolved to gather his Army, and to
go for those parts; to which he was, besides his own disposition, mightily
instigated by Ferrat Can, whose fear and ambition, being without means of
end, gave him assurance, by the place of General which he held, to have some
fair opportunity given him to end them, with the kings ruin, and without his
own danger.

Thirty thousand men the king took with him for that war, twelve thousand
Harquebusiers, which bare long pieces, half a foot longer then our Muskets,
slightly made; the bullet of the height of Caliuer, which they use well and
certainly: and eighteen thousand horse, which may seem a small troop in these
places, where the wars are carried with innumerable multitudes. But the king of
Persiaes judgment agrees with that of the best experienced Captains, that
multitudes are confusers of orders, and deuourers of time, and of those means
which nourish the wars; and are good for no other use, but to make a war soon
break off, and to consume the world. This Army being chosen out from all his
forces, of elected good men, he carried into Corasan with wonderful
expedition; and had taken it utterly unprovided, if Ferrat Cans advertisement
had not prevented his celerity; who had not only given notice to them, but to
the Bassa of Tauris, of the kings purpose, and his own resolution, promising
them a certain victory, and the delivery of the kings own person. A days
journey the king passed peaceably into the Country, without the sight only of
an enemy: himself with five thousand of the best men, accompanied with diverse
of the principal lest, was a kind of vauntguard to the rest, which followed
with Ferrat Can, Zulphir Can, and Oliver di-Can, which marched softly. The king
by that means, was far advanced; and being almost assured in himself, that
through the celerity of his coming, he should find yet no enemy sufficiently
able to resist him, and more confidently, by the persuasion of Ferrat Can: some
six hundred horse, under the leading of Vseph-Aga (which were sent to discover
before the kings troop) fell upon fifty thousand of the enemy; upon which
sight he would feign have retired: but being so far engaged, that he could
not, and unable to resist so great a force, with the loss of almost all his
company, he was beaten back to the Kings gross: who by the dust rising a far
off, and the great noise following, imagining what it was indeed, with a great
and ready courage provided himself ready to fight, and dispatched Messenger
upon Messenger, to command Ferrat Can to advance unto him. To the first Ferrat
answered, that it was but a troop of some few rascals, and desired the king to
march on, and not trouble himself nor his Army, and to diverse the like. At the
last, when young Hassan-Can came from the king, and told him the kings danger,
and that certainly the whole force of the enemy had charged him; he began to
show fear, and to call a Council of the Commanders, then to know what they
were best to resolve of, for the saving of the Army, since the king had so
rashly lost himself. Which when Oliver di-Can heard, vpbraiding him of
treason, called upon all those which loved the king to follow him; and putting
spurs to his horse, being followed by Courtchibassa, and most of the kings
Guard, and many other, with all possible haste, speeded to the king; who, by
this time, was forced to sustain, and retire, as well as he could, without
disorder, or show of fear. But when this Troop, of Oliver di-Can was seen,
his men received new courage; and the enemy, which depended more upon Ferrats
treason, then their own valor, began to be exceeding amazed, doubting that it
had bin the whole Army, and that Ferrat had exchanged his treason from his
Master to them: Wherefore slacking their first fury, and rather standing at a
gaze, then fighting, the king commanded Vseph-Aga to charge them thoroughly
afresh, and not to give them time to take new courage: which he did, with so
good fortune, that lighting upon the usurper of Corasan, and his son, he
slew them both with his own hands; from which grew the first maine flight of
the enemy, and the beginning of the victory for the king. The chase was
desperately followed, so that in that battle, and the chase were slain 30000
men, with the usurper king and his son; and diverse of the principal of the
country taken. That night the king pitched his Tents in the place of the
battle; and being informed, by Oliver di-Can, and the whole army, which cried
out, with open mouth, of Ferrats treason, te^pering the outward show of his
indignation with a compassionat feeling of man's errors, and frailty; excused
the constraint, and necessity, of the justice which he was forced to do:
protesting, that though for his states, and own preservation he was at last
compelled to give his justice place, above the power of his love, and
obligation: yet what the father had rent from himself, by the violence of his
own misdeeds; his son should find ripened for him, who should be heir of
what his father had well merited by his former services, as he hoped he would
be of his virtue; praying God, that his fathers vices, only, might die with
himself. Which when he had said, he gave Oliver Di-Can the Generalship of his
Army, and appointed him to do execution upon Ferrat, who being resolved of that
judgment, which his double offense had brought upon him, attended ready in his
Tent, without fear, to die, or desire to live; and there received that
punishment, which was unworthy of his excellent parts, if he had made that
true use of them which he should.

Zulpher Can, his brother, knowing that he had as highly and as much offended
as his brother had, yet wanting the same courage to receive the judgment,
which he had to offend, fled to the port of the Kings Tent, and there
prostrated himself on the ground; whence being called by Oliver Di-Can, he
denied to die any where, but there; that the King when he should come forth,
might tread upon that blood, which had so vilely, and undeservedly offended
him: which being brought to the King, by a Page that wished well to Zulpher,
and had some good hope of the Kings nature, that he might do the poor Prince
some good; after a little pause, the King came forth, and beholding Zulpher
lying grouelling on the ground, pitied him, and despising, withal, his little
valor: Behold, said he, to those which stood by, how weak a foundation
reputation has, which is not erected from a man's own virtue. This man was so
great yesterday, that you all honored him, and now lies despised before you
all, through his own wickedness. He has been advanced by me, for his
brothers virtues, and with the death of his brother, he does show you all, that
no worthiness of his own, but that which abounded in his brother, if he
could have made good use of it, gave him courage also to seem capable of those
honors which I bestowed on him. Zulpher, God forgiueth me as great sins
hourly, which I commit against him, as thy fault can be to me: and since it
has pleased him, that I hold so great a place by him here, I will also use the
example of his infinite goodness, for the pattern of this mercy, and refer
my vengeance to him, and give thee time to repent; and the rather, because thy
abiectnesse takes all apprehension from me of cause to doubt thee: He never
dares hurt a King, which fears to die. And remember that this is the first
day of thy life, in which thou must take more virtuous ways, then thou have
hitherto walked in, that I may have honor by the mercy which I have showed
thee, and profit by thy good services; and thy self, may cast away far
from thee, by honest and good deeds, the shameful memory which men will have
of thy past wicked Treason. This was the end of that great and foul
conspiracy, which gave great hope to the Kings enemies; and ending by such a
providence, was the means of the Kings greater and better security, which
could never have been perfect so long as so great a man had lived, both having
cause to fear, and by that giving continual cause to be feared. Next day, the
King marched farther into the Country, and so daily advanced on without
obstacle; the keys of all their Towns meeting him by the way; and at the
last, an Embassage from the whole state, with a general submission: which when
he had received, having spent some time, in the settling of such a government
as was securest for himself, and having received the young Rrince, son to the
first King, and diverse others of the principal of the Country, having left
order with Xa-Endibeague, whom he left there with the best part of his Army,
which he increased afterward to 30000 men, to extirpate all those which were
likeliest, either through their obligation to the usurper, or through their
own particular interest, to make innovation, he returned with that young
Prince, and those prisoners into Persia.

The most part of this time I was at Casbin, courteously used by Marganobeague,
the Master of the Kings house, and not amiss by any. When the King was come
within six miles of Casbin, he stayed there, some three days, to the intent
to make his entry with such an estimation of his victory, The Kings Triumphant
entry into Cabin after his victory.
as was fit for so great and happy a success of fortune: and, in truth, I
think that he did it most, to declare the greatness of it to us that were
strangers, by such a strange demonstration. The night before he entered, there
were 30000 men, sent out of the Town on foot with horse-mens staves, upon
which were fastened vizards of so many heads: All those in the morning, when we
were commanded to meet him, (the Governor having pro^ided us horses) we found
marching in battle array toward the Town; and before the two heads of the
King, and his son, four Officers of Arms, such as they use, bearing in
their hands great Axes of shining Steel, with long helues; after those
battalions, followed the Xa-Hammadagacs horsemen; after those, a number of
Gentlemen of the Kings Court; after those, a 100 spare-horses, with as many of
the Kings Pages; after those, the prisoners, accompanied with Bastan-Aga; then
a great rank of his chief Princes; amongst whom, were all the Ambassadors,
which used to be resident in his Court; then followed the young Prince of
Corazan, accompanied with Xa-Tamas-Coolibeague, the Kings principal favorite;
and then the King himself alone; and after him, some five hundred Courtiers of
his Guard. Marganobeague was with us, and making us large passage, through all
those Troops.

^ir Anthony herleis first ^utation, and ^eech to the ^ing.
When we came to the King, we alighted, and kissed his Stirrup: my speech was
short unto him; the time being fit for no other: That the fame of his Royal
virtues, had brought me from a far Country, to be a present spectator of
them; as I had been a wonderer at the report of them a far off: if there
were any thing of worth in me, I presented it with my self, to his Majesty's
service. Of what I was, I submitted the consideration to his Majesty's
judgment; which he should make upon the length, the danger, and the expense of
my voyage, only to see him, of whom I had received such magnificent and
glorious relations.

The Kings an^were.
The Kings answer unto me was infinite affable: That his Country, whilst I
should stay there, should be freely commanded by me, as a Gentleman that had
done him infinite honor, to make such a journey for his sake; only bid me
beware that I were not deceived by rumors, which had, peradventure, made him
other then I should find him: It was true, that God had given him both power
and mind to answer to the largest reports which might be made good of him;
which if he erred in the use of, he would ask counsel of me, who must needs
have much virtue in my self, that could move me to undergo so much, and so
many perils to know that of another. And that he spoke smiling, willing me to
get on horseback: which when I had done, he called Haldenbeague, his Viseire,
and Oliver Di-Can his General, and commanded them to take my brother and me
betwixt them; and my company was disposed by Marganobeague, amongst the rest of
the Kings Gentlemen of his Court: and in that ord^r, the King entered Casbin,
and passing to the great place, he alighted with the chiefest of his Princes
and Officers, who^ he caused to bring us with them, and went into a kind of
banqueting house, in which there were stairs to ascend by into a Tarras,
where the King ^ate down, and the greatest of those Princes, and we among the^.
This Tarras looked upon the place, where after we had been a little, and beheld
some of the Court exercising themselves at giuoco-di-canna, that great troop
was suddenly vanished, so without all sort of rumor, that it bred infinite
wonder in me, considering how much tumulte we made in these parts in the
disposing of a far less company. Whilst we sat there, the King called me
again unto him; and when I had confirmed in more words, the very same I had
before said unto him: The^, said he, you must have the proof of time to show
you, either the errors, or the truth of these rumors, since you can make no
judgment of what you have yet seen, which is but the person of a man, and
this emine^ce which God has given me, for any thing you know, may be more
through my fortune, the^ my virtue. But since your pains and travel has had no
other aspect, but to know me, we must have a more intrinsicke acquaintance to
perfect that knowledge; and how you will endure the fashions of my country, you
can judge best your self which are master of your own humor: This I will
assure you of, you shall want no respect from my people, nor honor from my
self; and therewith bid me fare-wel, for that present, comitting me and my
company to Bastan-Aga to be conducted to my lodging.

Next morning I sent the King a present, Sir Anthony Sher^^is present to the
King of Per^
of six pair of Pendants of exceeding fair Emerauldes, and marvelous
artificially cut; and two other Jewels of Topasses, excellent well cut also;
one cup of three pieces, set together with gold inameled; the other a Salt,
and a very fair Ewer of Crystal, covered with a kind of cutworke of silver
and gilt, the shape of a Dragon; (all which, I had of that Noble Florentine)
which his Majesty accepted very graciously: and that night, I was, with my
brother, invited by him to a banquet, where there was only Byraicke Myrza, and
Sultan Alye, with Xa-Tamas-Coolibeague, his chief Minion; there he had diverse
discourses with me, not of our apparel, building, beauty of our women, or
such vanities; but of our proceeding in our wars, of our usual Arms, of the
commodity and discommodity of Fortresses, of the use of Artillary, and of the
orders of our government: in which, though my unskillfulness were such, that I
knew my errors were greater then my judgment; yet I had that felicity of a
good time, that I gave him good satisfaction, as it seemed. For in my
discourse, having mentioned the having of certain Models of Fortification in
some books at my lodging, which were only left me in the spoil which was
made of me at Babylon: Next day, after dinner, he came thither, with all the
principallest of the Court, where he spent, at least, three hours in perusing
them, and not improperly speaking of the reasons of those things himself. Next
night he sent for me again, into a place which they call Bazar, like our
Burze; the shops, and the roof of which were so full of lights, that it seemed
all of a fire. There was a little Scaffold made where he sat, and as every man
presented him with diverse sorts of friuts, so he parted them some to one, some
to another, and there he continued some four hours; in which time, he took
me aside, with my Interpreter, and asked me, very sadly, whether I would
content my self to stay with him; not for ever, for that were too a great
wrong to my friends, who should loose me from their comfort, being divided so
far from them; for my own fortune he would not speak of, but only thus
much; since I had told him I was a subject to a Prince, he knew, that then my
fortune also must depend upon the will and favor of that Prince; and he
assured himself, that he was as able, and more desirous to do me good then
any: therefore if I would resolve to give him that little satisfaction; he
should persuade himself the more confidently, that the cause of my coming was
such, as I told him, the love of his person and nothing else. I answered him, I
could say no more ^o his Majesty then I had already done; that a report, only,
of his excellent virtues, had brought me thither, that a better experience had
bound me so fast to him and them, that as he was Master of my mind, so he
should be of my person and time, which were both subject to his command. For
those things of fortune, they were the least things that I regarded, as his
Majesty well saw by my great expense thither, only to satisfy my sight: but
as I knew my self infinitely honored by his Majesty vouchsafing to serve
himself of me; so that was to me above all other fortunes and satisfactions.
His Majesty seemed wonderfully well content with my answer; and that night
began to show me extra-ordinary public favor, and so continued all the time
of his being in Casbin, daily increasing by some or other great demonstration.

Six weeks he stayed there, giving his accustomed audience to the people; In
which time I saw the notablest example of true impartial royal justice, that
I think any Prince in the world could produce. The Gouerner of Casbin was
appointed to that administration, A memo^ punishm^ extortio^*
in the maine service of the Kings state when the Rebels were first suppressed;
A man exceedingly and perticularly favored of the King: he taking the adantage
of the time, which being troubled, gave him lively color, to make great
profit upon the people, and confident in the Kings favor, abused both the one
and the other by extreme extortions; thinking (because of his own greatness,
and the Countries offense against the King, the memory of which every man would
fear to receive) that what he did by violence and force should by as great
power of terror remain unknown: but some, to who^ he had offered so much
that they thought no extremity could happen them of a worse condition, made
desperate through that hazard to put up lamentable supplications to the King;
who having read them (as his fashion is) commanded the parties to-speake
freely; with this caution, that they should beware that they charged nothing
falsely; for as he would not that any minister of his should abuse his
authority, by any unjust burden, upon the worst of the people; so he would
also provide by severe example, that none should presume to impose false
accusations upon any, whom he had thought worthy to carry authority under him.
Notwithstanding, those poor men did not only mainetaine their accusations,
but brought forth diverse witnesses; and others, perceiving so just a course
held by his Majesty, emboldned by it, laid before him also, in their humble
sort, their own oppressions, suffered by the like violence: Upon which he
commanded Marganobeague to be sent for, who was the Master of his house in
Casbin, demanding of him whether he had heard of those things; he answered no,
being private acts of the Governor, (public causes, which were brought
before the President, Judges, Advocates, and his Majesty's Council, appointed
for the good of the Province, having ever taken those direct ways which were
fit for his Majesty, and benefit of the Province) if the Governor, in his
particular acts, had taken counsels with his particular appetites, and executed
them according to the same, neither he, nor any of the Council were blameable;
never having heard a voice only to that effect: which those men also, (who
were a great number) falling down upon their faces, confessed to the King; and
that their long silence had given the Governor the more boldness to use the
vtermost of extortion, and tyrannous exaction upon them.

The Governor denied some, maintained other to be done upon just causes: but
all so confusedly, and with so unstable a fashion of proceeding, as he
bewrayed his own guiltiness: notwithstanding the king stayed his judgment,
either of him or the causes, until another day of hearing.

In the mean time he appointed Marganobeague, Bastan-Aga, and one
Maxausebeague; (which is, as it were, Treasurer of his house) to take some
secret ways to find the true carriage of the Governor, during the whole time
of his function; Which they did with great uprightness and dexterity. And
having related what they had approuedly found, there were so many, and so great
causes brought against him, I mean of wresting of Money, bribery,
monopolizing, and such things, as more could not be imagined: which had been
small matters in a Princes state, whose favors and graces are privileged
above the common good of the people; and who change by their own conniuence,
their Royal estate to a tyranny of favorites, and a few Counselors: who
concurring in the spoil of the people, concur also in so cruel a
suppression of their just cries, that their lifting up their voices, for
Justice, is as great a sin, as almost a perfect Rebellion: and the same
Justice, which should protect them against inique oppression, inflicteth severe
chastisement; only for presuming to palesate such oppressions: A miserable
calamity for the poor flock, where the Sheepheards hears the wool, and
the Brambles rent the flesh.

But this King (whom we call barbarous, though from his example we may learn
many great and good things) knowing that the true care of a Prince, must be
ever the public good; and the capablenesse of his ruling, would be judged by
his true Justice, and election of his Ministers, and distribution of his favor
upon the worthiest (which also should make a worthy use of it) The next day
that he sat in judgment, he called the Governor: then having told him that
he which had lived with him in the time of his greatest calamity, must needs
be so well acquainted with the inwardnesse of his disposition, that all the
world would imagine, as Princes ever are examples of good or evil to their
subjects; so they are most to those which are neereliest conversant with them.
And according to that opinion, he had given him his authority, for the great
favor and confidence he reposed in him, that he knew well the error which
they had both committed, the one not making a true judgment of the others
disposition. That the transgression of Laws, and Orders in any State, was the
first natural corruption which grew in it: to provide for which, good Princes
did both watchfully industriate themselves, and dispersed part of the care,
which grew too great for themselves, to the trust they had in the virtue of
their Ministers, who should ever, as the very greatest and truest causes,
beware of those courses of Justice, which should be of least terror, and
procure themselves and their Princes most hatred, which was to pill the
subjects goods: a thing of no example, but to evil, and of infinite
odiousness, especially when there was no just cause why any sort of punishment
should be inflicted.

And because these acts, of so great a Minister, as he was, both for the place
he held of authority, and favor with him; might give the world cause to
suspect his own inclination; the which since no former example could make him
know, he would now show the world, and teach him, that the wickedness of
Princes, and great Men, are worse in the example, th^n in the fault; since, by
the evil custom of the world to follow them, they generate great corruptions
by the imitation of others. And because in a man of his place, there could be
no more wicked acts then he had committed; nor, in a Prince, nothing more
proportionable with his place, nor fitter for his security, then the
chastisement of such wicked acts; And if he should pardon so great extortions,
and scelerate wrongs as he had inflicted upon the poor people, committed to
his charge, besides, that he should verify the worst suspicions men might
have of him, he should, by so ill a president, trouble the minds of his whole
state, cast many good men, and their goods, into ruin; multiply the like, or
worse scandals, oppressing the causes of Justice; and so draw into the world,
without shame or fear, all sort of excesses: this should be his judgment;
The King of Persiacs judgment upon a^ Extortioner.
That all his Goods, and Lands, should be sold, for the satisfaction of those
men, whom he had spoiled: And if any thing wanted, since the King, by giving
him that Authority, was partly the cause of those excesses, he condemned
himself to pay the residue out of his Treasury. That if any thing advanced, it
should be given to his Children, with a grievous Edict, that no succor should
be ministered unto himself. For that, since Death was a concluder of his
offense, shame, and the memory of it, he should not dye; but go, during his
life, with a great yoke, like a Hoggesyoke, about his neck, have his Nose and
Ears cut off, and have no charitable relief from any, but what he gained
with his own hands: that he might feel in himself the misery which poor men
have to get, and what a sin it is to rent from them by violent extortion, the
birth of their sweat and labor.

This Judgment struck a mighty amazement into all the great men present, and
gave an infinite joy and comfort to the people. The Turks Ambassador, which
was there, after he had stood silent a great while, as a man half distracted,
swear publicly, that he saw before his eyes, his masters ruin: being
impossible that such fortune and virtue, as the king was accompanied with,
could receive any obstacle.

That night he made Marganobeagus Governor of Casbin, being well admonished
by that great example of his duty. Constantino, a brave young Gentleman, being a
Christian of Georgia, he called Mirza, and gave him the government of
Hisphaan; and me also he called Mirza: Sir Anthony ^^ade a Mirza.
telling me, that he would provide condignely for me. And because he had an
urgent occasion to go post to Cassan, I should receive his pleasure by
Marganobeague; who brought me, the next morning, a thousand Tomanas, The rich
present sent him by the King.
which is sixteen thousand Ducats of our Money: forty horses all furnished;
two with exceeding rich Saddles, plated with gold, and set with Rubies and
Turkesses, the rest either plated with silver, or velvet embroidered, and
guilt; sixteen Moyles; twelve Cammels, laden with Tents, and all furniture
both for my house and voyage; telling me withal, that this was but a small
demonstration of the Kings favor, by which I might (notwithstanding) conceive
what better hopes I might gather: And that it was his Majesty's pleasure I
should follow him to Cassan: In the house where I was I should leave a keeper,
being his Majesty's pleasure to bestow it on me: and that there were ten
Courtchies which should attend me the next morning, to serve me in my journey.

All this while I moved nothing to the King of that which was the maine purpose
of my coming, both because I had no fit opportunity; and if I had, yet it was
too soon: and besides, it was too great a business to expose, without such an
occasion as might help my good intention, with the goodness of it self.

Moreover, though I knew little; yet so much I knew, that in handling with
Princes especial affairs, of such momentuall importance, I ought not so much
to repose my self upon the good, and just property of my proposition, as in
the direct knowledge of the nature of the Prince; who either might grow jealous
of the hazard, or having his ambitions turned to other ends, might mistake, or
not regard my aduertisements. Both which would have been the ruin of what I
intended: A business hardly rising again, and recovering grace, which has
been once foiled. Therefore I took time to deem by the proceeding of other
deliberations, of the way which I should take; and to make my self learned in
the purpose of his actions, by his nature, and inclination; besides, not only
to get, first a kind of possession in his own affection, but of all his great
men; especially of those whom I did imagine would be best and strongest
assisters of my purpose: which I did judge to be Oliver di-Can, his General,
and Xa-Tamas Coolibeague, both which were Georgians; and though they were made
Mahometans by the father of the King, to whom they were brought young, yet they
had ever Christians hearts, and infinitely well-inclined to all those things
which might promoue the Christians enterprises, publicly wishing well to
their proceedings, and taking all offered occasions, to give them honor and
reputation.

Then Constantino Mirza, who was a Christian, and in great favor with the
King: Yet for all this, that I meant to make those the maine helpers of my
design, I left no sort of fashion forgotten which might procure me favor
from all the other: though I soon found their appearances answered not with
their minds, which were only contained from ill demonstrations against me,
by the Kings favor to me, and their fear of offending him; not only through
the ordinary envy which follows all Courts, but by the great hatred which
they had to the very name of a Christian, being in their souls Turks: though
not daring to palesate it for their own certain danger.

For the king knowing how potent a uniter of men's minds the selfsame
Religion is for the tranquillity of an Estate: and the like dis-vniter several
Religions are for the disturbance of the peace of an Estate, he is exceeding
curious and vigilant to suppress, through all his Dominions, that Religion of
Mahomet, which follows the interpretation of Vssen and Omar, and to make his
people cleave to that of Aly: Not (as I judge) through any Conscience, which
carries him more to the one then the other; but first to extirpate intrinsicke
factions, then to secure himself the more firmly against the Turk, who
being head of that part which follows Omar and Vssen, should have too
powerful a way into his Country, if his peoples hearts were inclined unto him
by the force of Religion. Therefore he does not only strive to root it out,
but to defile it, and make it odious; having in use, once a year, with great
solemnity, to burn publicly, as maine Heretics, the Images of Vssen and
Omar: then does he cause his great men publicly (in scorn of their
institution) to go with a Flagon of Wine, carried by a Foote-man, and at every
Village, or where they see any Assembly of people, to drink; which himself
also uses, not for the love of the Wine, but to scandalize so much more the
contrary Religion: that by such a kind of profaning of it, they may wear the
respect of it out of the peoples hearts: Which when it fails with reverence
in Religion, the pillars thereof are utterly broken. Yet (as I say) there are
of the very greatest, exceeding precise Turks, if they durst do other for
their own fortune sake, then cover, with all artifice, that infection.

Ten days I was between Casbin and Cassan, where arrived, I received more
gracious demonstrations from the King, then I could hope for, or wish: being
far beyond my present merit, and my judgment how to deserve it at all.

Four days his Majesty stayed there, after my coming; in which time there
passed many Triumphs at giuoco-di-canna in the day, and good fireworks in the
night: at which I was ever present with himself, with no less respect, then
if I had been his brother, as he also called me, and continued that name
afterward, all the time of my being in Persia.

The second day of his Journey, from thence, toward Hisphaan, he called me
unto him, my Brother and my Interpreter; and (after some few discourses) he
began to tell us the whole history of those his fortunes which I have
discoursed: and joined that he understood, the Turk had sent him a fair
sword (he did believe) to cut off his head withall^, if Ferrat Cans treason
had well succeeded: for after the Messenger arrived at Tauris, understanding
how God his great providence, had not only mightily preserved, but given him
that famous victory over his enemies, he had sent for new order to
Constantinople, which came to no other end, but to call him back again. But
the best was, the more the Prince hated him, the more his subjects loved him,
having received news at Cassan, of ten thousand souls of Courdins which had
abandoned their possessions under the Turk, and required some waste land of
him to inhabit in; which he had given them.

And though this discourse opened somewhat largely the Kings heart unto me, I
durst be no bolder, at that time, then to say, It was ever, almost impossible
to preserve a quiet amity between two so great Potentates, as himself, and
the Turk; especially being so near neighbors: that I doubted not, but his
Majesty, in his great wisdom, provided his Counsel and strength always
ready against any danger which might grow from him, of which there was no
present doubt, as long as he was so powerfully diuerted by the wars of
Hungary; which if they were ended, I saw no Obligation of faith, or any thing
else, which could secure his Majesty from those Arms, which had been ever so
ready against his State, in all occasions; especially now that his Majesty's
virtue, and fortune ministered to the Turks will too great maine causes; First
to stop the course of his too fast rising greatness, which he could by no
reason willingly suffer; Then to recover his reputation, which his Majesty had
taken from him, by assubiecting the Tartars, which were under his protection.
And if with both these he saw his subjects also fall from him to his Majesty,
in so great troops, it might be a mighty effectual working-reason to hasten
him to a conclusion, upon indifferent terms of those wars in Hungary; his
Majesty being much more dangerous unto him, not only through his power, the
reputation of his late victories, and such a flood of fortune, joined to his
great virtue and wisdom, but also by the symbolizing of religion, which would
more facilitate an entry into his state, then the sword, when there should grow
no more mutation in the maine points of government, laws, nor orders, but the
person of the Prince only. The obstinate wars, and resistances of the
progress of the one and the other, between the Turks and the Christians,
grew from the maine alterations of all Laws, Orders, and form of government,
with the utter ruin of the conquered, being so diverse in all those; and more
in the principal point of religion, by which he was evermore assured of us,
generally infestuous to the very apprehension of his Subjects. But his Majesty,
from whom there was none of these general dangers, was, questionless, the
more perticularly feared by him: And ever he that is feared wrongeth his
judgment, if he live into great and careless security. I concluded, it would
please his Majesty to pardon me that I said so much, that if I had erred, it
was in my judgment, not in my zealous affection unto him; neither had I
presumed to look into such high matters, if his Majesty, by his discourse, had
not directed my sight; which if it had been amiss, his Majesty's benignity and
great wisdom could pardon the fault, for the true affection which caused it.

He answered, that he was so far from mis-liking my liberty of speech that he
thanked me for it, desiring me to continue it. For Princes (said he) are,
indeed more then men, when they find faithful friends which will freely advise
them; and less them men when they are without such: the brightness of their
greatness so dimming their sight, that they have much more need of help,
then private men; who being conversant in all things, gather experience of
every thing, which a Prince cannot have; Nature, only, bringing forth a man,
his perfection following by his own virtue, learning and experience; the two
first a Prince might have, the last hardly, and ever imperfect. Which made him
ever carefully desire such, friends, as might minister a faithful help to
that defect; but because we are now in journey we shall leave those things for
a more reposed time, to be spoken of at Hisphaan, where we shall have leisure
enough both to deliberate and resolve of some good things; and with that called
some other, who entertained him with discourses of Hunting, and Hauking, in
which he is much delighted, and uses them with great magnificence: Never going
to any of those sports, but that he carries forth above five hundred dogs,
and as many Hauks, nothing rising before him but it is game. For flies he has
sparrowes; for Birds, Hobbies and Marlins; for the greatest sort some Hawke or
other; and for Roedeare Eagles; he has particular Agaes for his Hawks and
Dogs, and other Officers to them a great number.

The next day, I singled out Oliver Di-Can, with whom, (after a few
complements) I communicated the Kings discourse with me, of his first troubles,
and latter fortunes; extolling his Majesty as it was fit; and besides, giving
the greatest honor to himself, without flattery, that I could devise; then I
told him of my answer to the King, and on purpose I said, I feared, that it
might turn to my harm, being newly planted in the Kings favor, subject to
the envy of the Court, and wanting a tongue to speak for my self: and that to
entermeddle in so great and perrilous matters, it could not choose but awake
some covered malice, to take occasion to work me some damage. But my
confidence was such, first in the Heroycke mind of the King himself, then in
the generous disposition of his excellency, that I should be protected from
peril for this fault, as I would preserve my self with more cautel hereafter.

He answered me, that the Kings affection unto me was such, that no man durst
lift up a thought against me: which the Court knew well. For himself, as he
knew not the conditions of our Courts, so I might mistake those of theirs: if
envy bare so great a sway with us, we had lighter Princes, and men of more
presumption. In this Court there was not a Gentleman but the King: the rest
were shadows which moved with his body. But in this which I had said to the
King, if I had intended it, to move him to war in so fit a time against the
Turk, I had done well; and assured me that both he, and Xa-Tamas-Coolibeague
would with all their powers concur with me to bring it to an essential
deliberation; though, said he, there be three dogs, Haldenbeague, Bastan-Aga,
and Courtchy Bassa, that will mainely oppose themselves against it: yet in the
conscience of my duty, which I owe to his Majesty, I assure my self, that
there is no secure way, either for the preservation of his person, or state,
but that. Therefore since you have begun in so happy an hour, to break the
Ice of so great and so good an enterprise, follow it without fear, since God
will prosper your good intention in it, and we will second you, with all the
strength and industry which we have. This was all which I desired, to be
assured of some friend; especially such a one, as might have both opinion and
credit of wisdom and favor with the King. For being a stranger, if I had
undertaken the bearing of so weighty a business my self alone, I should
hardly have escaped the being ouer-weighed with it, knowing that the best
propositions have ever oppositions, men's humors never concurring all to one
end, and the nature of men being always opposite to a strangers advancement:
Which since it must proceed in such a place from a special act of his own
virtue, which could never be produced without a subject to work by, the next
way to wash away insensibly such a growing reputation, was to keep me from any
other means of establishment, then bare Favor, which as it is very transitory
in private men, so is it much more in Princes; the volubility of whose natures
makes them easily glutted, and most mutable in their kinds of satisfaction:
and if once I had declined in the height of my fortune, I knew there was no
bayting place, ^etweene mediocrity, and precipitation: so dangerous are the
^aies of Princes, and all men so foolish to strive to run ^ them.

The Kings entrance into Hisphaan was there of the same fashion that it was at
Cassan; differing only in this, that for some two English miles, the ways
were covered all with Velvet, Satin, and cloth of Gold, where his ^orse should
pass. After he had been settled there foure^eene days, remembering what Oliver
Di-Can had said unto me, I determined to loose no more time, but to try the
uttermost of my fortune, in bringing to a resolution, that enterprise; the
imagination of which, had cost me so much time, and so much danger; and was
the chief mouing-cause at the first, and now the only moving cause of coming
thither. And I was the more encouraged to do it by the fresh memory of God his
mighty providence over me past, and by the exceeding great favor of the King;
which I knew to be his great work, who moves the hearts of Princes to make
them instruments of his judgments, which by all apparent demonstrations, I
conceived, determined against the Turk: Therefore taking the opportunity of
the Kings being alone with me and my brother in a Garden, with my Interpreter
only and Xa-Tamas-Coolibeague, I spoke unto him to this effect; ^ir. Ant^ony
^her^^es per^wasiue to the (...), to ^^ke war against the (...).
That my affection, grown only upon the fame of his Majesty, had guided me
from a far Country into his presence; by which I found his royal virtues,
so far exceeding the relation which I had heard, that as I did admire them, so
I had a kind of forceable moving in my nature to desire condign fortunes to
accompany them: Besides, my particular obligation to his Majesty was so great,
that I was bound, not only, to say what I thought fit for his service; but to
do as much, as my life might accomplish for the same. More-ouer being emboldned
by his royal gracious answer unto me upon the way, (which I did take for a
kind of commandment) I would presume to say something more largely then I did
then, of that which I took to concern his Majesty, as much as any thing else
could. Neither would I speak any thing of other condition, then such, as he in
his great judgment should find so well grounded; that nothing could be added,
either to the just cause, honor, vtility, or facility of the enterprise, which
I would propose. And because I would clear all clouds, which might hang about
it, my self which propounded it, was such, that I was only a shadow, which,
by the urging of my own nature, and delight, should follow the body of his
victories, rather then have, or hope, for any other particular interest in them
my self. For the first points, There could no deliberation be grounded upon a
greater foundation of equity, then that which had his end only directed to the
recovery of that, which was by force and violence usurped from his State: nor
nothing more honorable for a Prince then to be able, without hazard, not
only to revenge private and public wrongs; but to recover their members
again to his seats, by his wisdom and virtue, which have been separate
either by the defect, or fortune of his Predecessors; All this, both public
and private profit, followed so great an increase of State (increasing in all
points the force of his State) and his poor Subjects, which were thrown out
of their possessions, either through their true devotion to his Majesty, which
could give them no peace under another government, or through the extreme
tyranny of the Turk, should be recovered again to their own, with his
infinite glory, and vtility. The facility showed it self diverse ways;
principally in his own fortune, wisdom, and virtue; against which, there was
no likely resistance, especially when there was no equal obstacle; then the
reputation of his late victories, joined with the other, would find, or make a
way through all difficulties; then his Militia which was fresh and uncorrupted;
then the incapacity of the Turk, his corruptions of government, want of
obedience, sundry rebellions, and distractions from any possibility of being
able to make any potent resistance against his Majesty's proceedings, by his
wars in Hungary, which his Majesty might assure the continuance of; if it
pleased him to inuit the Princes Christian to his amity, which he should
offer upon that condition: by which also, he should receive one other worthy
benefit fit for such excelling parts, as he was most richly abundant in, not
to conclude the true knowledge of them, in that one corner of the world: but
with making these great Princes known unto himself, he should make his own
worthiness, like-wise, known unto them. Neither, (as I said at the first to
his Majesty) though these were great points to move so high a spirit, intending
to glory, and great things, as his was, that they were so important as other
were. For these might either be deferred, or not at all acted, being bound unto
them by no greater necessity then his own will, counseled by good reason. But
his case was such, that he must resolve, both for the security of his estate
and person, to make or endure a war.

As I was proceeding, Haldenbeague the Viseire, BastanAga, and Oliver Di-Can
came in: the King presently called them, and told them what I was propounding
unto him; upon which, the Viseire swelling against me, answered instantly.

Your Majesty may now perceive that true which some of your servants have been
bold to tell you, The Vscive^ di^swa^ue (...) position.
at the first coming of these Christians, and many times since, that they were
sent to disquiet your Majesty's tranquillity of your state; and to embarke you
in dangerous enterprises for others interresses. For what likelihood was
there, that a Gentleman of quality, without some great disaster fallen him,
should take such a voyage, so full of dangers and expenses, upon a fame of a
Prince, spread by ordinary Merchants? Since I know, he could never have spoken
with men of better quality in those parts, which could have known your
Majesty: And if it were true, that such a motion, only, had brought him; why
should he not give time to the growing of his better fortunes, by your
Majesty's Munificencies and favors; without drawing himself into the danger,
to be a perswader of a perrilous enterprise: then which, he cannot be so
ignorant, as to understand no way to be so precipitious for himself; But
because it is enjoined him, he must do it; without regard to your Majesty, to
whom he is only, newly, bound, for present benefits; which he cares but to
enjoy, until he has entangled you in his designs: and then will he rely
upon those, to whom he owes greater obedience, for more permanent benefits,
and greater through so great a merit. God keep your Maiestly from giving care
to his persuasions, which carry nothing with them but extreme peril: The Turk
having been a heavy neighbor to your Majesty's state, when it was found
through a long peace, and when your Predecessors were abundant in money,
which is the heart of the wars, and the sinews which bind together an
estate. Your Majesty has now a certain peace with him, and that the more
certain through his necessity, which assures you of time to gather treasure
and all kind of strength against him, if he should break the faith of his
truce, or move against you hereafter. That it is just, honorable, and
profitable for your Majesty, perhaps I may agree; though it be a question,
whether it be just, or honorable, to break a peace, without a just occasion
given. But howsoever, it is more wisdom for your Majesty to find a better,
and more fit time which shall furnish you with all necessary provisions for so
great an enterprise: And further, I say, if the Turks government be
corrupted, give it more time, and the sickness will increase. Is he
incapable? his years are too many to make him amend; therefore by giving your
self time, you loose nothing; he will be incapable still. But Sinan Bassa was
a great name; So was Mustapha; and so was Osman; and so has he many now; so
that his state does neither stand nor decline, with his defects, as long as he
has worthy men to maintain it. His Countries are full of rebellion; These are
Rumors with which wise men are never moved: since they grow by reports, and
diminish by experience. And if they be true, let him consume with his own
malady: and your Majesty's designs, (whenever you shall resolve of them)
will pass with the more facility. How dangerous a thing it is to embrace
diverse and continual action, your Majesty's greatest wisdom can better tell
you then I; your Tartars have but newly felt the offense of your Arms; they
are far from being well tasted, or at all secured with your Majesty's
government: Begin a war with the Turk, (in which must be engaged the
uttermost of your strength) what other opinion is to be had of them, but that,
like old enemies, and freshly more then ever offended they will rebel, and
infest you with the greatest resolutions that extreme enemies can? And again,
Where is your Majesty's treasure? where is your munition? and where is your
Artillery: all which must be had for a war; and though your fortune, and the
nature of the country (which has no strong places) did not require them
against the Tartars, yet of necessity, you must have them against the Turk,
who has a Fortress in Tauris, Tifflis and Vannes, strong places; and never
moves his Armies, but full of Artillery: which you must also have, if you
mean to proceed honorably, and with condign fortune against him.

Moreover, for you to send, and beg an Amity of the Christian Princes, what a
sit persuasion is it for your Majesty's greatness? which notwithstanding, if
you were compelled by necessity, somewhat from your self, yet necessity would
make it tolerable: But for you to seek them which have need of you, there is
so little reason, that he has sinned against your power, person, and state,
which has propounded it. Your Majesty may, in your too great benignity, pass
over your just indignation for such acouncell: but we know what it meriteth.

There is behind you, Lar, and Ormus, the one a kingdom fomentated as a bar
between you and the Portugals: and the other, which is usurped, from a king
anciently tributary to your predecessors. Whilst your Majesty makes your self
ready for the greater, begin with the lesser enterprise. Nothing will give you
more honor then that; First, to vindicate those places, in which your religion
is oppressed; and by that, justify the more whatsoever you shall enterprise. If
this Christian can give you these; if he can give you abundance of all other
wants, if he can give you Hostages from his Kings, that they shall not in
Hungary alone, but in other places also, fasten upon that huge body of the
Turk; and that they shall neither make peace nor truce with him, except your
Majesty's consent concur, that nothing may be defective in so great an
action: And that your Majesty may be secure, that the weight of all shall not
wholly fall upon your self; then your Majesty shall have some foundation to
deliberate on. Otherwise, I think neither his persuasions to be harkened to,
nor himself to be retained: who shows by his sudden beginning, that no
favor, grace, nor benefits from your Majesty, can acquiet his mind from
stirring you against your own peace, tranquillity and security of your state
and person.

(...) Persian (...)nerall his (...)swear to the (...)s disswa(...)e.
Oliver di-Can answered, that there was difference between a proposition which
was only moved to be councelled of, and a persuasion. That he thought I
councelled nothing, (much less persuaded) but only propounded that to the
king, which if it were not then fit to be executed, for reasons that I knew
not in the present condition of the kings affairs; yet I deserved not so
bitter a censure: since Princes ought to hear all, and elect the best; and for
that elections sake, to animate all to speak freely. And because it has
pleased his Majesty to give you, and me, and all of us, leave to speak, as it
is all our duties to say what we think: so our places are of such a
condition, that our powers are nothing in resolving: but only in discoursing
before his Majesty, those things which in the truth of our consciences, we
think meetest for his service. And if convenient and necessary things be
propounded, by a Christian, by a Jew, or by the worst man living; not only in
religion, but the very disposition of his life, I see no cause why you, nor I,
nor any should reject that which is good for the illes sake; since Princes
must, and ought, make their benefit of all men: not regarding what they are,
but how they may serve them. This Christian has come from far, and through
great dangers (he faith) through his affection, growing from the excelling fame
of his Majesty; and should not I think, that his glory is worthy to be carried
as far as tongues of men go? And shall not I think, also, that a Merchant
speaking of his virtues, is not enabled beyond his spirit, raised by such a
subject, to show it like it self, not like his own Merchandise? And why
should I judge him sent by any, when he has not assumed to himself the
honor, dignity, nor privileges of an Embassdour in a strange Country, where
no man would neglect any thing which might advance his quality, or security?
But he has only put himself upon the Kings favor; and what he has
proposed, has proceeded rather from a mind, to merit by some good act, that
favor, then a demonstration of other dependence: for having given himself to
the king, to serve him without limitation of time, but as long as it shall
please his Majesty to serve himself of him, he shows plainly, that he
has included his hope of fortune, and benefit by this, or any other action,
within the compass only of his Majesty's gracious benignity. And serving his
Majesty in this, or any other employment, which his Majesty will vouchsafe to
make use of him, If he do it as a stranger, he has no hope, but in the merit
of his own virtue, which must be discerned and rewarded by his majesty; if he
serve as a Prince of his Majesty (as now by his great magnificency he bears
the title and place; the same virtue must ever confirm and advance his favor,
and the same king must judge and reward it. And this I have said in a double
duty; first, to maintain the act of his Majesty's great judgment, which cannot
mistake it self in the distribution worthily of his favors; then in that of
hospitality, to answer justly for a Gentleman, come to our home, where we are
all bound to defend him from wrong: especially bearing about him so great a
privilege as a true affection to our king.

But now to speak of the proposition, the Viseirs objections against it: as I
do think them worthy of so wise a man; yet because particular factions do
sometimes blind men, both in councelling, and deliberating: So questionless
his great judgment has been much clouded with some of those; which have made
him err directly in the judgment of some things; and to misconceiue of the
maine purpose generally of the proposition. For no man's intention is to be
judged to stretch beyond possibility: So that whatsoever was propounded to his
Majesty as necessary, honorable, and profitable for him, and his state,
included withal that well-vnderstanding intention, that it would please his
majesty to provide, in the firmness of his wisdom and council, condignely
for it: if he want treasure, to gather it; if he want munition and Artilery, to
make quantity of both: which must indeed require a time for the act; not the
resolution upon the act. Without which his Majesty (as he shall have no great
cause himself) and his Ministers will be less diligent in the expedition of
all such provisions; of which (to say the truth) that huge mass of money is of
least importance; his Majesty being able to make in the time of this Turks
distraction (and if his whole power were also united) a sufficient Army of his
Timarri, and such as he already pays, upon the Frontier, to proceed with
any great design against him. For admit he should (upon the moving of the
Kings Armies) come to any foul conditions of peace in Hungary, as it is unlike
that he will; yet there must be so much time between the proposition and
concluding of the peace, and removing of his Army thence, and transporting it
hither, that any great thing will be first effected, before any obstacle will
appear against it. But in reason, he should rather endure any unreasonable
loss this way, then the least there: For (besides that his principal parts
are altogether disposed on that side; in so much that the danger of Hungary
does extend it self to Constantinople) We are even of the self same, or
little different religion, so that the wars cannot proceed with a mortal
hatred and desire of extirpation, which bears with it so much the less
danger: and as it is the more facile to be satisfied, so easier and less
perilous conditions will ever end it. That Tauris, Tistis, Vannes, are strong
places, I do not deny it; but withal I know that the strength of no place can
maintain it self against the power and fury, and the ordinary miseries
brought by the wars, without a certain succor; which I cannot see how they
can be confident of. The Tartars you say are newly conquered, and will rebel
with such a great opportunity: surely I take that opportunity the only
direct means to answer them, nothing breeding discontentments to a dangerous
breaking forth, so much as idleness, and the continual sight of that which
they take to be their oppression. Therefore his Majesty having an Army of
thirty thousand men there, and from thence drawing forth thirty thousand
Tartars of the best able for the wars, the Province must be most assured; the
means and chief actors of innovation being in his Majesty's Army; and their
wives, children, and parents, in pawn with their country for their true
serving his Majesty in his wars: which he did think so necessary for the
King to undertake, that he made no difference between putting his state in
extreme peril, and the not undertaking of them; counselling his Majesty to
do in that point, as all wise Princes use to do, not only to have regard to
the present evils but to the future, and to repair them with all industrious
providence: because that by seeing them, and preventing them a far off, the
remedy might be applied with great facility and good effect; but by expecting
them until they bear down all by their great weight with them, their cure
will be taken and used out of time, the sickness being grown to incurable
terms: as the Physicians say of the Hecticke seauer, which in his first
entrance into the body is easy to be cured and hard to be known, but through
the continuance of time with the rancor of the disease by not having known it,
and applied remedy in the beginning, it changes the first order, and grows
it self facile to be known and impossible to be remedied: so does it occur
in matters of state; for foreseeing with wise providence, the evils which rise
toward it, there is no difficulty in avoiding them; but when from either
neglect or ignorance of preventing them they palisate themselves to every man's
understanding, there is no more remedy familiar with our reason securely
auailable against them. Which makes me be bold to say, that since the
inconveniences which his Majesty must suffer by the Turk are so apparent, he
must resolve and strengthen his mind and means to remove them, and not to
give them greater power to follow him by avoiding a war: since you may know
that the war cannot be absolutely taken away, but deferred only with the
enemies advantage. Neither will I ever be advised by that which is always in
the mouth of the wise men of these days, which is to enjoy the benefit of
time; but will say and ever think, that Every Prince, and every man should
make use of his own virtue and wisdom, seeing time driving every thing before
it does ordinarily produce as often good as ill, and ill as good. And why it
should at any time diminish the reputation of his Majesty's greatness to
inuit the Princes Christian to so honorable and great an action, I cannot
discern, when it is one of the greatest foundations of a Princes reputation to
raise himself to the greatest enterprises, in which his judgment may not be
mistaken in the possibility of effecting them. And since it is necessary for
his Majesty to combine himself with them for his own strength and
reputation, if either he attempt the Turk, or be attempted by him, why should
it not be more honorable and more facile for him, for the accomplishment of
his ends, to speak unto them in their necessity (if there be any of either
part) and so to link himself the stronglier with them by such a bond; then in
his own necessity, in which condition there is a great question whether he
shall be heard. Lastly, how strange a conclusion you have made, I will desire
you to behold with better consideration. You will not have the King to make
war with the Turk, to avoid expense of money and munition, where the best
parts and most plentiful of both countries are confining, which would give
abundance, and cheaper living to an Army; but you will have him go to Larre,
to Ormus, sterile countries far removed, where the charges only of supplying
victuals to an Army, would be of more cost then all other munition and expense
of the Army besides. And besides; there is no danger of the King of Spain, who
has ever held a fashion of maintaining himself rather then increasing.
Besides the nature of his force is of a contrary quality to give us fear of
his too great enlargement, having neither abundance of horse nor men, but only
galleys which assure his forts, with which also he is sufficiently contented.
And how wearying out a war to his Majesty's treasure, and men, that must be
where he must fight but at the enemies pleasure and advantage, the strength of
his enemy standing upon the Sea, in which the King has no sort of show of
power, he submitted to his Majesty's wisest consideration: besides the infinite
danger by the nature of the lying of the state of the Turks and the King of
Spaines, and the essential of their potenties were of such a condition, that
whatsoever was diminished from his Majesty's, or the King of Spaines, was an
absolute addition to the Turk; who by that advantage of the weakening each
others forces, should have a more facile entry upon any one or both of them.
And that it was well proved by his Majesty's predecessors, that there was not a
more maine vpholder of the beginning, and foundation of their state nor manner
of preserving it (which was all they could do) then that league which united
both their forces ever against the common enemy. And now that God and the
great virtue of his Majesty had so augmented the limits of his dominion, that
he had power joined with true justice and necessity, to recover those usurped
Provinces which the Turk held from him (In which action nothing could more
secure him, then first, an assured relative friendship between the Princes
Christian and him generally, and particularly the forces of the King of Spaynes
by Sea in those parts) it should be a strange Counsel to persuade his Majesty
to make war with him whom he had ever profited by, and to offend all in
offending him; and voluntarily to in^ble the Turk in whatsoever he would
undertake against him: which must needs be by all reason and judgment his
enemy. Which made him beseech his Majesty to continue that so commodious
friendship unto him, and to strengthen himself with new, to fomentate those
rebellions, which were no rumors, (one of those that were in Arms being
Moombaregue a Prince tributarie to his Majesty; the others, though no men of
great quality, yet of great happiness in their proceedings) and to provide
for all things necessary for so great an enterprise: for which, though the
Vicesire were otherwise persuaded, nothing did more facilitate the judgment of
his good success, then the Prince of the Turks own incapacitie; Nothing
having ever been proved more certain, then that the Ministers of any Prince
do ever symbolize with their Masters virtues or vices; and that men of
extraordinary virtue with them, have ever little power, or little time:
suspicion being the best preserver of their defects, which ever aymeth at those
who have more virtue then themselves, as fearing them most. A discourse proved
true by the miserable end of all those named, and by many examples which he
would leave vnrehearsed, as things that never bare more credit then the faith
of the hearer gave them. And so left off, humbly beseeching his Majesty to
pardon his boldness and freenes which were ever the birth of true zealous
devotion: he had only expressed what he thought, his Majesty might please to
resolve of that he thought honorable, secure, and profitable for his state
and person. The causes of his danger from the Turk he spoke not of, first
touched by me, and apparent to all. The king then commanded Baslan-Aga to
speak freely also what he thought, who after a reverence unto him, having
repeated the arguments past, commended them all (as it is his fashion
apparently to offend no body: but what he does in that quality is secretly)
and then as though he meant no such matter, dividing what he would speak into
two points, The great Chamberlai^ speech.
the war, and my person, he proceeded thus. This proposition by the wisdom
of his Majesty resting doubtful, so that none of us by knowing which way his
own disposition inclines, have any sort of constraint, either by fearing to
oppose our opinions against what his will intended, or by a desire to raise our
judgments into a better conceit of f^uour, by making them to symbolize with
his, gives us so great liberty of deliberation, that if we speak not well to
the purpose, at least we shall speak truly what we think. I say then that all
wars are either made upon the Confines of the States which move them: or
far from the Confines of the maker of them, by penetrating further into the
maine body of him upon whom they are made. And it is not possible for any to
use great Arms or small a long time, which have not a fountain of great
revenues from at home, and a foundation of great plenty in the field. For as
without sinews the members of this compact of our body cannot move; and if
they do, show a stirring only, for a testimony of their life, which may be
in them; yet that moving is imperfect both in vigor and continuance: So Arms
neither can be gathered, neither can they be appropriated to necessary
dessignes, nor maintained united in any enterprise without a River of money
which may refresh them in convenient time, and make swim after them
munitions, victualles, and other necessary provisions both for the sustenance
of every particular body, and importing to the good purpose and effect of the
mannagement of their Arms. And because the revenues of just and good Princes,
(as the faculties of the subjects from whom they are derived) are limited; and
drawing without measure for one year or two huge quantities of money out of
their estates, their countries will remain poor and exhausted of gold and
silver. From whence proceeds that wars of such a condition as cannot be
ended near at hand, but draw (through the necessity of perfecting them well
when they are once begun) the Prince and the Army a far off; neither can be
undertaken nor continued, but by Princes who have infinite treasures acumulated
through long times providence, or neuer-ending mines (for other sort of
ordinary abundance of what greatness soever it be, will be dried up and
vanish; and a short time brings it to an end) the times of peace gathering by
minutes that which the war spends by hours: and one year of war
consumes the fruits of many years of peace. Mustapha Bashaw, when Soliman
deliberated of the wars which he made with our great king Ismael, told him
that before he resolved of it, that there were four torrents to be opened; the
one of men, the other of victuals, the other of munition, the other of money:
and in all he said well, but in the last best. For if every sort of war
require mighty expense, questionless such a one does it most, which is
carried far from your own home, where the nourishment of your own country
may subminister abundance and cheapnesse to your people: which the Turk proved
true: for having undertaken that war more upon the Confidence of his
resolution then good Council, being a Prince of so great power, he so consumed
his treasure that he was compelled to abase the allay of his Gold and Silver:
and for all that to raise the price to the double value: and to comport it with
the falsification of money, and many such great inconueniencies; for which the
Ianizaries rushed into strange mutinies, and many perrillous successes
followed: yet had he Timarri as your Majesty has; but when the length and
quality of the war devoured the^ faster the^ their ability was to bear, the
Prince was constrained if he would use them, to give them means of sustenance
also: and your Majesty which has a state as yet exceeding feeble, and scarce
recovered from a mortal sickness, is so much unable to bear the burden of
such a war, that by over weakening it in drawing from it that small vital
sustenance which it has, it may (which God forbid) occasion the last ruin of
it; like a sick body, which aggrauated with the ill of the disease, loses
his natural vigor. Therefore great fortunes and victories sometimes when they
meet not with a^^rude of that excellent wisdom and virtue, that is able to
use them iudiciously and temperately, are the most powerful means of the
ruin of the Prince and state: when being carried away with the confidence soly
of a continuing felicity, they embrace more then they can possibly claspe: and
the mischiefs which succeed of such ill measured wars fall not only upon
the Prince, but are pernicious also to his poor people, when through their
ambitions and cupidities they are Authors and stirrers of new perturbations.
Your Majesty has now assured your self from all such ruins, as heretofore
kept you from uniting your self either for your defense against the Turk, or
offense when your general force might make you able for such a resolution; and
that which is more, those men, which were accustomably used against you, are
added to your own power: your wants are money, munitions, artillarie, which you
have time enough to provide abundantly, by the greatness, unity, and wealth,
of your own Dominions: and the Turks present distractions, troubles, and
general corruptions, which in natural discourse are likelier to increase by
time then decrease. For Good and I Would have in the government of men this
difference between themselves, that Good though it be brought forth by time,
yet it is not renewed by time; and though by our studies and industries it be
maintained, it corrupts not-withstanding by degrees of it self, and finally
of it self, also extinguisheth; as we may read and see in the succeedings of
all states and of all Sects: the contrary of which appears in Ill, since it
does not wast by little and little through the wearing of time, as Good does;
but rather increases to a more powerful validity, and by easy passages
rises to the extremity of declination. So that having such assurance of the
working of time in that quality with which the Turk is already infected,
Your Majesty may reponder and resolve at leisure of the proceeding of your
enterprise: only provide means to establish and perfect it when it shall be
concluded. This Christian has brought with him a Founder of artillarie: let
him be useful to your Majesty in something; and let us your servants have
the comfort to see some good fruit of your infinite magnificencie. In the mean
time, by deferring your deliberation, Your Majesty shall ever have advantage to
determine by the progress and success of things, and so shall you either
move or stand what way soever you incline unto, more surely founded. For your
Majesty's sending to the Princes Christian, I give also the same counsel to
beware of error by acceleration, since if they be great, and have need of
colligating themselves with your Majesty (as your need of them shall never be
without theirs of you, both rising from the same, either the Turks potencie to
sustain him jointly, or his impotencie to dissolve him jointly) they I say
without once measuring obligations, honor done, or benefits past, for their
present interest will ever embrace your favor and friendship, at what time
soever it shall be offered. If they be Princes of no great power in
themselves, their suspicion, fear, and jealousy will naturally induce them to
combine themselves with your Majesty, or any Prince of a porportionable power
for such an effect, for the ruin and destruction of a more powerful enemy.
That this Christian does insist to have it done now, I cannot discern his
reason; for if his condition be good in his own Country, it is unlikely that
for the enjoying of any other fortune he will perpetually banish himself from
thence, and would be glad to have such a demonstration there of his valor and
fortune, to have bin able to persuade a great King of Persia to such an act: in
which if the books of our former Kings err not, many great Kings, or at least
Kings, have fai^ed. For the present using of your Majesty's Soldiers to keep
them in practice and not to suffer their courage to be overcome with too much
and too long ease, You have two ways; one to change often your Army in
Corassane; the other to employ them toward Larr and these parts; which is a
most just, facile, and profitable enterprise. For taking of Larr, you shall
bring those of Ormus to an acknowledgement both of tribute and homage to you,
which will give a great satisfaction to your Subjects, by that beginning
conceiving a hope of greater things: and be the more assured of them and their
help, if you need it hereafter, by the nearer you are to prejudice them, if
they should not be apt to serve you: and the expense can be nothing against a
small King, the Tymarri only of Syraz sufficing for that enterprise. But as I
have said thus much by your Majesty's commandment only, so I will never make
my self an obstinate Author of a Council: but humbly submit what I have said
to your Majesty's excelling judgment, and the resolution of your determination
to Gods direction, and your wisdom; and the execution to his great providence
and your Majesty's infinite virtue. And (laughing upon me) son (said he) have
I not said true of your mind? When he had ended, I beseeched his Majesty to
vouchsafe to hear me once more; which he said was needless, and the day fa^e
spent: therefore since every man had already spoken their opinion he would also
say somewhat of his own, and refer the farther deliberation of things until
an other time. The proposition which Mirz^ Antonio (says he) made unto me, The
Kings censure and conciu^ on o^ ^he comultation.
is quest^onlesse in i^selfe such an one, as I must not only thank him for
propounding it, by which it has received life, but I must also provide for the
execution of it, that the life which it ha^h may be used to good purpose. The
force of the Turk consists in cauallerie, infantery, galleys, artillery,
munitions, money. And the cause why they proceeded not in their war against
this state in my fathers time, was not either the death of Osman Bassa, nor
their diuersion into Hungary, but that ancient art by the which they ever
carried their wars; which has been always to offend and prevent an enemy;
to use exceeding celeri^ie in all their enterprises; to have their forces in
perpetual readiness; not to attempt two enterprises at one time, and if it
were possible, not to be troubled with the^ at one time; not to spend the
benefit of time, and their men and treasure upon matters of small importance:
and not to continue a wa^re long with any, to avoid by such a means the
informing by practice any Prince or his people in the exercise of arms. Which
if it have otherwise happened in Hungary, it proceeds rather from the
obstination of the Princes Christian, then from any part of his own desire. I
(said the king) want footmen, artillery, and money, which I must make ready;
the Turks never having advantage upon my people through their vaiour, but only
by that defect. Galleys I have none; therefore since they must be necessary for
some purpose, of which the wars may bring forth the occasion; and perhaps
also of necessity; and I can only hope for them of the Portugeses: it will be
an ill counsel to offend them in any point, and then afterward upon a new
treaty to rely upon them in so great a case, and in which my necessity may
also concur. For the Turks present state, and the judgment of his future, it
is a thing facile to make, and hard to err in; since, by the ordinary course
of the working causes of mutations of states, when a government does proceed
from suffering the first abuses, to confirm them in the most part of the
state, a few intelligent instruments are not sufficient to bear the weight of
the disorders, and to correct them; being the nature of men, when they fly
from one extreme to runn: head^ong without any mediocritie into another: by
which the Turks extreme obedience is become a direct despisablenesse of his
person and authority. And this Princes incapacity must be in this point the
ruin of their state, diffusing the like infection into the members, for such
as is the Prince, such are his greater ministers, and such are his people. Then
whether I give my self time or no time, for what belongs unto him, that may
perhaps be all one, since his being as he is, or worse, shows facility
enough for the well proceeding of any enterprise fundamentally designed against
him. Yet many times general rules fail in particular subjects, and a new
Prince may and can reform those disorders; but the time in truth which my own
wants force me to take (and not these arguments which are no other then
arguments) shall show that I am not defective in those points, in which he is.
But that which I begin shall have the extract of it from sound counsel, and the
ending from as perfect virtue, if I or my people have it. For the flame of our
war once breaking forth (believe it) will not be so facily extinguished,
both, because great Princes difficilly speak of peace while they feel
themselves able to make wars; and the diversity of our religion will strive
with a more mortal rancor then contraries. Therefore I must strengthen my
self by all possible ways to bear the fury of it: which must be done by the
inabling and augmentation of my forces, changing the orders of my own militia,
to such as are properest for the enemy which I propound to my self*
establishing the government of my country in such a sort, that the general
abundance may without the feeling of a heavy exaction replenish my treasures;
cause plentiful provisions of artillery, arms and munitions; and add to
these internal powers of my own, those of the Princes either by protection or
league: of which the first sort, I mean I have already the Georgians being
all under my protection: but it is a weak help, I being bound by that
condition to defend them upon my charge, and they unable to assist me, except
upon the same also. And though it be true that they bring me a fashion of
reputation, yet is it such a reputation as has no essential point of
foundation: but only serves me by ignorance of the quality, in which they are
unto me, rather then in the substance and strength. Leagues are usually of more
appearance then effect, and of more splendour in the beginning, then of profit
or durablenesse in the end (so many accidents causing disunion, suspicion, or
some other ill quality amongst confederates) yet when a league is made for
preservation against the common peril rising from a potent enemy, and when
diverse bodies are moved to one end, and with one consent, and not one body
with diverse consents, and every one of these having particular respect to a
diverse end, and when if there be any thing acquisited the distribution of the
members of that body is such, upon whom the acqueit is to be made, that there
is no possible pretendence from one to the others getting; I do not see but
that such a league must bring substantial reputation, and general commodity
that will not be subjected to any common accident of dissolution. For the
Tartars which I have as subjected if I were Oliver Di-Chan, Ha^denheagu^, ^r
Bas^an-Ag^, I could think of few better means to assure my self of their
rebellions, then those which they have propou^d^d: except one addition of
suffering them to enjoy their ancient order, laws, and their particular course
of justice. But as I am borne with a mind^ of another constitution, I can
secure them better by giving them to their own natural Prince, and him to
them. For to whose father I was ^o much bound, that through the royalty of his
disposition I hold my life, and had the beginning of what I am, I can do little
for the son, and no grateful act at all for the memory of the father, if I
cannot give him a kingdom which is the least part of what I am. The Kings (...)
the c^nsulta^ tion.
To conclude as good deliberations in their many points, must be grounded upon
the example of the past, the experience of the present, and the judgment of
the future and the Turk has been ever heavy to my State in long p^ssed, and
late pass^d times, and is now by some accidents partly proceeding from himself,
partly from others (in all liklihood) easy to be perpetually assured: which
point of time that gives so good an occasion if it be let pass, may give him
power (for a mind he can nor will never want) to be intolerable again
hereafter; or if not intolerable, at the least dangerous. We have two great
powers of our minds, the one a wise power of understanding, by which we
penetrate into the knowledge of things; the other a strong power of resolving,
by which we execute things well understood: and now that we have judged of all,
we must resolve of somewhat; and of that which is probabliest best. Therefore
our necessity, our honor, and our justice calling us against the Turk, and
since wi^h all these concurreth so good an opportunity: he must be the maine
end of which we will determine: and because to prepare us to that end amongst
many other circumstances, the sending to the Princes Christian has been
intimated as one of the most necessary: we shall do well in the general good
use which we must make of this interposition of time, to do also that. For
though it be true, that their interesses will ever make such a proposition
acceptable: yet where there is a proffer of such a condition, as bears with
it a kind of Obligation, as it is of mere honorable fashion for us, so it
adds grace and reputation and more strength to it, or any such like purpose.
For neither will I rely so much upon my own power, or fortune, or the present
benefit which I mean to bestow upon these of Corasan, that I will forget I
have offended them, and to arm my self with all the best advise I can against
the sinister working of any fortune. Neither will I so much preiudicate the
opinion, which I desire the world (without vain ostentation) should hold of
me, and my ministers, as that my enterprises should not have a way given them
by the wisest and best weighed counsel, and perfect concurrence made between
my fortune well judging of my counsel, and all proper occasions. As for Mirza
Antonio (for so he ever called me) what he is to me vou all must know, and my
estimation of him: which I ass^re my self to be grounded upon a good and true
judgment, since he has been the first and only propounder of the manifest
point of all other, which does or may concern me most. So for that matter of
sending in which there is more diversity of opinions about the form of
circumstance, then essential matter of substance, I will remit it to his
fidelity and true affection to me, to dispose as he shall in those two great
works in a noble mind, find meetest for my honor, and convenient, and
certainest for the effecting. Yet this must I tell you and him, which has not
yet been thought of, That a great Prince, as I am, must receive a denial for
an injury: and I had rather not know them at all, then with knowing them to be
also offended by them; though (this I say also) that he cannot be judged to
have authority to command their wills, therefore must be blameless in all,
except in the lightness of his imagination, upon which slender occasion he
ought not, for the credit of his own judgment, to have formed a Counsel.
Before I could frame one word of reply, he rose, and having talked a little
while alone with Xathmascolibeague, he called my interpreter, and held him some
quarter of an hour in a very earnest speech: which was, to command him (as he
afterward told me) not to let me know what his Viseire had said against me,
but charged him to animate me to love his people, and also to confirm (in all
he could) my affection and well-hearted intention to his own service. The
Persian V^^c^^rs complement with Sir Anthony S^e^^^y.
After he was retired, the Viseire came unto me, and having saluted me with a
goodly fashion of courtesy, he began to desire me not to be offended, that his
being curious of his Majesty's good, had stirred in him so violent a desire,
that through it he had mistaken me, and the true aspect of my ends. But as
there was ever a good remedy for all known errors, and especially for the
most accelerated, so there should be in his toward me all the best and
careful service, which he might possibly do unto me. And though I stood in
need of little help to put forward the kings affection toward me, yet he
assured me, that in all due and fit opportunities he would not be wanting to
perform the uttermost part of a true friend, in that o^ any thing else which
might protend my good. I did make all the show I could to believe him;
commended his zeal to his king; and withal desired him to have a constant
opinion, that my good intention to his service also might misl^ad my judgment
of some things, but the truth of my heart never. Therefore I desired him, that
if I did err also in such a point, it would please him to correct me as a
father, and not to oppose against the rising of my fortune as an enemy, since
I knew my hopes to be of small time or expectation if they must wrestle with
his power and wisdom: also that I knew his virtue too great to envy a man
which could not grow at all, but under him, and that I knew a good desert of my
self toward him in the conscience of my most affectionate respective
disposition, which would never fail to make very perfect demonstrations of it
self unto him, in all worthy occasions which should either offer themselves,
or he should command. And so were parted with a mutual show of great
satisfaction, which I know now of us both had.

That night Cou^chi Bassa arrived at the Court; and next day as the king told
me, accompanied with the Viseir and Bastan. Aga persuaded him again, not
against making him ready for the war against the Turk, if he should be
counseled unto it by any good advantage, or forced by the Christians peace
with him: but (because his Majesty was almost determined that way) to use all
the best means, first to weaken him without showing himself purposely an
actor in it. (And that was to be done by encouraging his rebels, and by
breaking as much as he could the trade and commerce into his dominions, which
subministred unto him both the sinews of his war, and those also which did
bind the body of his state together.) That Mombarecke (which held of his
Majesty the principality of Sustane; of the Turk Giziwr, and the deserts
from Balsaracke to Damasco with the lest conuenence of his Majesty, would
continue his Arms against the Turk, and make all those passages so
infestuous, that neither Bagdet nor Damasco should receive the commodity, of
any of those Carauans of Merchants which usually came to them from Ba^sarah: by
which the Turk should loose every year two millions of Entrata. For the
Portugeses (if his Majesty would please to judge indifferently) it was as
likely that they would mislike his too great increase as the Turk, and so much
the more as they were less able to resist him, then the Turk was; Larr and
Nicolow joined together: whereof by taking the one, he did more assure any
moving of theirs against him; and if they meant him well they could not be
offended at the neerenesse of his neighborhood. And engaging the other in some
actions against the Turk as to rob, spoil, and hinder the traffic of the
Arabian gulf, and such like should by such an act make him desperate of the
Turk; and so join him through his own necessity surely to him: and though
he were otherwise of no great importance, yet by his bordering upon the sea,
and his men's expertnes of the sea, he was to be made in that point very
profitable hereafter, and a good instrument for the present (and every small
addition of force, or means gathers reputation to all great actions) when
the time were fit that they should appear partials to to his Majesty. And for
sending an Ambassador to the Princes Christian, he thought it first against his
dignity to offer himself unto them, who in their need of him through their
pride neglected once to speak unto, or with his Majesty. Then in the well
carrying of his other purposes, which would be palesated by so maine a cause of
suspicion. Therefore that his Majesty must either determine to break
presently with the Turk, not which he could; or else to give him no apparent
suspicion of any such inclination or carriage of things: by which he should
win time to make his own provisions with good foundation, and keep the
Turk unfurnished; ever, nourishing him with so wise artifice, that he might be
secured from any opinion of such moving the time nor nothing else promising
felicity to his actions so much as the wise using of the time, and of those
things which, were offered him.

What the king replied I know not (having received this opinion of Courtchi
Bassa from the king himself, who by that and other eternal contrary counsels
was so much distracted in his own resolution as a prince that desires to do
great things, and them also well determines not suddenly upon fair hopes, but
carries his hopes to perfection by the working of his wisdom: so that many
days after, when I would begin to enter into a new discourse of those
deliberations, he would presently turn himself to speak of other matters.
In this fashion more then one month passed, in which I had no comfort of my
desire, but only that which Xa-Thamas Colibeague and Oliver Di Chan gave me,
and the kings exceeding favor which rather increased then decreased toward me.

In this time (as though all the strength of that ill spirit, who ever raises
the uttermost of his skill and power to prevent all good purposes had conspired
to overthrow the well proceeding of this good business) There came news to
the Court, that Mahomet-Aga General of the Ianizaries of Bagdat was entered
into the kings Confines, as Ambassador from the Turk, with a rich present, and
marvelous honorable train: And that those of Ormus had stayed by force
sixteen slaves which were sent by the great Mogore to the king; with nine
other which Oliver Di-Chan had bought in those parts, and the Merchants for
their more security had sent them with those of the kings. This raised the
courages of those which opposed themselves to the maine business, alienated
mightily the hearts of Oliver Di-Chan, and Xa-Tamas Colibeague from all, and
exasperated the king himself so much against them, that his ordinary speech
was no other, but that he would shortly learn them to have a respect unto
him, which did so exceedingly fill my very soul with perplexity, and
anxietie, that I fell into a very dangerous sickness, in which the king never
failed daily to visit me himself; and finding that the recordation of those
things did aggrauate both the grief of my mind, and unquiet of my body, he
forbad that any in my presence should speak more of it, but only comfort me
with all sort of discourse of recreation, with so royal and so gracious a
regard, that he showed apparently enough, that few accidents could dispose his
mind from any reasonable contentment which he might give me. In the mean time
Mahomet-Aga arrived at the Court, whom the king sent his Viseire and
Courtchibassa to meet accompanied with a thousand horse of the principal of
the Court, and of the City. These (no question) gave him large instructions,
and as large hopes; which if he had guided also rightly, he might have done his
Master great service, and himself infinite honor: but through his own too
hasty greediness, assurance, and desire, he prevented himself whilst he
striued first beyond that which was indifferently good, then beyond that which
was better, and at the last beyond all reasonable (and I think his own)
hopes. For first being proudly confident upon the greatness of his Master; then
upon the difficulty of the king of Persians present estate, to be moved to
offend so potent a neighbor; then upon so great and strong a faction in the
Court; besides having heard by them that the kings mind was altered from those
of Ormus, and that Oliver Chan also was then likewise alienated from his first
censure through the particular wrong done unto himself, or else that he
changed the inclination of his mind according to the corrupt condition of all
Courts, in which the love of obsequiousness to the Prince, and fitting
themselves to their appetites (by that means to strengthen their own
emulations) is more power-able then the fear to do ill, and the working of
their own consciences: or else that in all things there is a certain
revolution; and as there are mouings of times, so there are also vartations in
our minds and fashions. Making himself strong in his assurance upon these
foundations, etc upon the weakness of his opposition, which was left much
infeebled by the distraction of Oliver Di-Chan, he left the right way of moving
by degrees so great a business to carry it even without agitation or danger:
And as though with knowing the circumstances he had attained the end, he
overthrew his Masters intention, his own honor, and almost lost his life, if
the kings infinite clemency had not either desp^sed or pitied his error.

Neither do I set down these things with so particular a care for my own
sake to make either my work the greater, or to make an ostentation of any
thing which was not, but because in all discourses which I have seen given
forth for the worlds better understanding of those things which one man has
compiled out of the largenes of his reading or experience, it has been a good
and necessary use to set down the nature of the people treated of, and in
what sort they might be or were temperately governed, and how much was learned
of the Princes and great men's disposition, judgment and skill in ruling; by
which course, they which observed it, were accounted wise and prudent
vndersta^ders of the times and places which they conuersed in: so in this time
of greater corruption where all contrary examples not seen, nor known by us,
may breed a wonder, by that rareness of others virtues, and by that, a
detestation of our own familiar vices, which give few amongst us the wisdom
to make a true distinction of honesty from dishonestie, and that which is
justly profitable from that which is unjustly harmefull; by which means may be
gathered more and better profit by other men's foraine experience, then those
examples in which they are daily exercised. But as such a fashion of
declaration will be of the best sort of use, so I am not ignorant with how
little delight and credit, it will be accompanied. For to relate the situation
of of countries, the variable events of the acts of great Princes and
Captains, these do detain and revive, as it were the minds of the readers. I
speak only of a good intention, tossed with the tempests, first of many
desperate calamities; then with many potent oppositions; the justice, wisdom,
temperance, liberality, valor, mercifulness, and generality of all excellent
virtues in a Prince esteemed by us barbarous, and yet indeed fit to be a
pattern and mirror to some of ours, who have Christ in our mouths, and not
the least of his Saints in our hearts. Besides the variety of his fortunes
disposition, bridled and brought to a good inclination by the force of his
wisdom and goodness, and true experience of the power of fortune: in which
discourse there is no alteration of matter; the subject being ever the person
of the king, and his excelling virtues: which I had rather speak of, to point
out by them the happiness of his state, then to see a far off the miseries
of some of ours swimming in blood, full of cruel commandment, continual
accusations, false frendships, the ruin of innocents, implacable factions, and
pernicious ends of things: contrary to that which ought to be with us of a
better profession; and is with those which we despise.

But to return to my purpose. Mahomet-Aga being arrived at the Court: and
refreshed some small time, the day of his audience was honored with all the
Princes of the kings Court, and my self being too weak through my long
sickness, the king commanded that my brother should be present also; where
after a magnificent oration of his Masters potencie in all conditions of force,
he told the king, The proud message delivered by the Turks Ambassador to the
King of Pe^si^
that he was sent to admonish him to remain constant in the truce with his
Master; to require restitution of those Courdines which without license had
abandoned their possessions in his Masters Provinces, and contrary to the
terms of amity were entertained by him. That his Master also demanded the
restitution of Corassa^ to the former government in the alteration of which,
though he knew his greatness and Majesty violated, yet he could yield so much
from what he ought to do to the king of Persias years and heat of valor; that
he would content himself with that satisfaction. Then he advised him to force
his nature, and cover this vain glimmering of fortune with judgment and good
counsel; which ever would advise him to maintain and preserve his estate,
rather with wary then violent counsels. This his Master demanded of him to
obliterate (by the facile granting of it) all greater injuries; wished his
Majesty to consider well of the demand, the condition of the demander and his
own: Denials ever to such Potentates being received for maine offenses; that
it was ever a wise determination to yield to the authority of time, and
necessity, and to avoid by that good judgment, urgent perils, and sinister
conditions: nothing being a more secure repair, then to strike satle against
insupportable tempests, it many times happening that the too great valor of
men used with too great confidence is ^itterly persecuted, and sometimes
oppressed with an unhappy course of fortune: against the current of which,
when once through error it breaks, ^orth no humane force, or wit can make any
resistance. And because all men for the most part are blind in discerning the
judgment of good or ill counsels, from their end, celebrating them when they
prosper with a false argument from the success: his Majesty should give a
great example of true wisdom, not to be so much ouerborne with the present
delight, or future hopes, extracted from those first prosperous successes, as
not to be able to lift up his eyes to see the clouds which he had raised by
some of them: which if they were not prevented, would break forth into extreme
tempests. To conclude, he said that his Majesty must be so far from thinking
to weaken his Master by cunning and by artifice, and so to keep his Arms
far from him; that he must resolve such courses to be servile: and to execute
apparently and presently only, princely, and like himself; so that either he
must prove himself a friend, or declare himself an enemy. The first would
merit any private grace, which should be no sooner deserved then attained; the
other would give glory and honor to the victor, ever dear and honest to the
winner, precipitious and shameful to the looser. And not speaking of the
inuinciblenesse of his Master, God himself would judge the first unjust
infringer of an amity sworn to his great name.

The King without any thing moving from his accustomed gravity, tempering the
justice of his indignation with the true magnanimity of his mind, answered
him to this effect. The King of (...) his answer to the Turk^ Emba^^ador.
That as the greatness of riches and treasure were oftentimes pernicious to
Princes; so were abundance of men, and largeness of dominions, to such as were
too weak to govern them: therefore that extolling the magnificency of his
Master (which might breed wonder and terror in those who were not capable of
greatness, was no mouer of him to decline from any part of that which belonged
to his own greatness. He had received the Courdines (oppressed by the
tyranny of cruel ministers) into his protection; and as their coming to him
proceeded of their own will, so their return from him should be voluntary,
and not through his constraint. Corasan he had justly taken from an usurper,
and would restore the lawful Prince, who should receive the benefit from his
munificence: and not from any point of the Turks instance. But wherefore should
he be bound to give a stricter account of his actions to the Turk, then became
equal Princes to ask the one of the other; as though the laws of ruling had
but one moderator, before whose tribunal they should be all presented? Tauris
belonged to his predecessors; so did Sicruan, so did Dierbech; and what justice
had his king to detain them? If none other but by the potencie of his arms;
the same point of justice he had also to preserve what he had already gotten:
and to vindicate also those unjustly detained from him. If he will break the
truce made between my father and him, and continued by my brother and me, upon
so manifest unjust causes; as the war was never prosperously provoked against
our state by his predecessors nor himself, but through some strange accident,
error, or our own disunion: so believe that it will now break forth to his
own destruction. Yet I do not deny but that I had rather, both to preserve
what I have, and to recover what my ancestors have lost, by equity then blood;
and by the force of reason, rather then of arms: which if I cannot, I will
certainly amend by virtue what I have erred in by cunctation. My power and
glory is yet soundly whole, and more increased through the merit of Modesty,
which was never yet despised by the greatest which have been among men: and is
esteemed by God himself. Wresting of acts could not deceive others; which as
they were made to God; so the judgment of their breaking or abusing would ever
be in God, and his memory, care, and power. For Mahomet-Aga himself; though
he had forfeited the privileges of an Ambassador, by executing under that
title a contrary office; if I should (said he) presently and condignly punish
you, both the memory of your present fortune (into which pride and folly has
thrown you) and my glory would be darkened; and the punishment would be
followed with a sudden forgetfulness; but if I free you (as I will) from your
punishment, though I cannot from the fault, I shall be an eternal memory to
the world of clemency, and leave you a great precept either of more judgment,
or less employment: until you can make your self fitter for such a one as
this, to which you have been unworthily elected.

As I said before if he had used the opportunities (which he had) discreetly,
he might have done his Master a notable service, and honored himself much.
Tor the kings great coffeehouse with those of Ormus, and the strong
opposition of most of his counsel to any proposition against the Turk, did
facilitate a way for him to have fashioned the king to any condition of firmer
terms with his Master, then they had hitherto stood in. And though it was not
likely that there could have been mediated a restitution of those Courdines,
yet the loss of them had been small, being a people ever unstable in any
certain habitation, neither having understanding of good, nor care of ill;
proper ministers only of rapine, and to possess improper places for ciuiller
inhabitants: and he might easily have procured a restraint that none other
hereafter should have done the like; if he had propounded it from his Master,
disobliged him to the king of Persia, and restored the peoples minds to their
first dependence, being a Nation, though otherwise of doubtful faith, both
through their own nature, and situation of their country, yet more inclined
to the Turk then any both by the bond of the same religion, and hatred to the
Persians.

The next morning the king came unto me, and after some other discourses, The
King of Persia agrees to the persuasion of Sir Anthony Sherley.
he told me he had well considered of my proposition, which though otherwise he
had no great inclination unto, both, because of the great separation by
distance, and difficult means of correspondencie, which could be made between
the Princes Christian and himself, besides the small necessity he had of
them, (God having given him so ample, so rich, and so warlike a dominion) and
if he had, their own disunion amongst themselves gave him small hope of any
great good effect in what he should propound unto them: Besides the derogation
from his own greatness to be a demander of their amity, whose predecessors
had sought it of his by diverse means, and upon great conditions. Yet to show
me how dear an estimation he held of me, he was contented not to see what
belonged to himself, but only to regard my satisfaction: which he willed me
to determine of, and assured me of the effecting of it whatsoever it was.

And after I had given his Majesty thanks which were convenient for so high a
favor, Sir Anthony She^ly c^^firmeth the King in hi^ purpos^ of sending to the
P^in^es of Christ^n^^m.
I told him that I had propounded nothing but that which the future experience,
and present reason of things would prove not only infinitely available, but
also necessary for his honor, profit and security: to which counsel I was
ready and desirous to add my own peril, which could by no other means
bring an answerable benefit to the greatness of itself, but only in the true
estimation which I made of the merit of his Majesty's virtue, and my infinite
affection to his service.

The necessity of his state, I knew either counseled him to provide for a
war; or to make a war: Private cogitation^ having their progress of such a
condition, that they may take (as themselves w^ll) either more of less of
fortune; but those which had raised their thoughts to the sublimitie of
dominion are no more in their own power: having no mean to step upon between
the highest of all, and precipitation. For his Majesty to sleep longer,
called upon by so maine reasons which did evidently demonstrate unto him the
inevitable danger, (if not rain) of his state, and contrariwise, the certain
addition which his majesty might make to his glory and state, would seem to
those that did not rightly understand the excellency of his Majesty's heart,
such a weakness in him, as is incident to those which have not power to
temper felicity, from glutting themselves with the abundant fruits of present
prosperity; though they have a patient forced vigor to withstand adversity.
That the Turk was to be vanquished, his own Rebels had showed, which have
overcome with small forces his great power in sundry encounters. If his
Militia has had heretofore more vigor and valor; it is now changed through
pleasure, ease, and surferinges by (their Princes example) with great
corruptions; which a more virtuous Prince may reduce to their soundness: his
Majesty's wisdom should work immediately upon the present general defect
and error. Neither should he make a proportionable concurrence between his
factes, and wisdom, if he did loose time in doubtful deliberations, in such
a case which did evidently show him that if he might securely continue in
peace, yet that peace was more pernicious unto him then war: leesing so many
fair occasions of propagating his Empire, and making his estate eternally
invincible, and to dangerous to be attempted again by the Turk: when there
should be so equal a balance of potencie, as would be between them, but by
the recovery of his own, if his desire and fortune, and virtue disposed no
more unto him then that which was justly his own, and was unjustly deteyned
from him. For those rebellions of the Turks they were likely rather to
increase then diminish: such manner of people evermore easily consenting in
unity, in war, then in peace to be commanded, or yield obedience: And the
greatest powers which are, have been, or may be, which united bear all
before them, the violence of their strength, once divided either by time, by
p^t^^^^, or by diversity of fortune, (which cannot be at all times, and in
all places alike) may be and are subverted. The war it self will open and
disclose many hidden and swelling wounds, which are now only covered by
ignorance, and others detracting of their determination.

And though it be true that the Princes Christian be far divided; and some of
them incombred with particular designs amongst themselves, through the
passions of their private interests; yet the Emperor (who is the greatest in
title, and by his alliance of the most power) is already engaged against the
Turk: which war he will more or less prosecute according as he shall have
more or less hopes. And what greater (almost assurance of prosperous success
can be have then the conjunction with your Majesty, whose power and virtues
he shall know? And the moving of both your ends being the same can loose no
property in their working, by the large separation or distinction of places.
The Pope also (who carries a Supreme authority among Princes to move them to
those things which shall best preserve, or augment the limits of his Church)
animated by your Majesty's great name and offer; will assuredly use the
uttermost of the strength, of his authority, and industry, to reconcile all
particular enmities, and to combine all hearts to that General war, in which
every particular is truly much interessed; if they consider their conscience
to their profession, and the danger wherewith they all have been threatened, by
that great Enemies potencie: diverse Princes having already by it suffered the
uttermost of ruin.

Neither shall your Majesty despair, but that all may be persuaded to so
honorable and pious an action being a property in man's nature to follow, that
which has been contrary to their disposition to begin: And if they all
should not; yet the Emperor, Pope, and King of Spain absolutely will embrace
the amity, honor the name of your Majesty, and unite themselves in any
terms of Princely alliance: and your Majesty shall have an eternal glory
amongst all; for inviting them all to so Noble, Generous and Royal an action:
and at the least, draw great intercourse of Merchants of all those parts; which
will give an entrance to a kind of sociablenesse, and that will proceed to a
common respect, and so to a mutual friendship which will give the
communication and knowledge of many things hidden (both in the knowledge, use
and profit of them) for want of such an intercourse.

Your Majesty also wisely desires to take away all reputation from the
Turkish Religion, through your Dominions, both by scandalizing it publikly, and
punishing it in particular persons: Sithence Heresy in all Religion causes
Diui^ion, and the corrupted part becomes a pernicious enemy to the Prince
who supporteth the contrary; From it arise as from a maine turbulent Spring,
Treasons, Conspiracies, secret Conventicles, and Se^^tions.

Besides the greatest and largest way, which the Turk has into your
Dominions, is the faction of his Sect; as Ismael your Predecessor had, of that
which your Majesty professes, to divide your state from him: He is an
absolute and Tyrannous enemy to the Christians; Your Majesty's Religion, has
a charitable opinion of them: and if drinking of Wine, burning of their
Prophets Images, and such less apparances be in your Majesty's opinion
effectual things to estrange the peoples hearts from that Religion, by a
contrary use, with those opprobries, to the other; a greater means your
Majesty may work by: in giving liberty of Christian Religion, so much
abhorred of their part, and security of trade, goods and person to Christians,
by which you shall bind their Princes, express the charity of your Law, serve
your self in diverse things of them which have been hidden unto you, both for
your utility, strength and pleasure: and more invre your people to despise the
other Religion, by so contrary, so apparent and so great effect. Neither can
they ever be dangerous to your Majesty, their increase being always to be
limited by your will. This also will give your Majesty great fame, since by
their means you shall recover available instruments both to preserve and
augment your estate by: as Founders of Ordinance, Makers of all sorts of
Arms, and Munition. So that though it may seem a strange act in your Majesty
to be contented to enlarge to Christian, so new and so great a fau^ur, yet
since all great examples ever have in them some thing o^ an extraordinary
quality, those are to be made use of that repair by public profit, those
particular disgu^ls which private men may rece^^e of them: I know that it is
for the most part a f^^l^cious ambition which imbraceth greedily new and
dangerous things; but to determine and execute fit and convenient things, is
the proper effect of wisdom and courage. Your Majesty knows your present
estate, remembers the courses of the times past; and the excellency of your
judgment weighs, that which may succeed hereafter. No man receives harm
but from himself; nor your Majesty can suffer none but from that which your
self will determine of your self: you are invited to no act depending upon
fortune, but such a one as shall have his fundation upon Council, reason, and
judgment. My satisfaction shall be above all other greatest if your Majesty
resolve of that which will be most secure, honorable and commodious for your
person, state, and particular Subjects.

Well said the King you would then have me to write to as many of the Christian
Princes as are greatest amongst them, ^ King of (...) Re^^^on to em^y Sir
A^^^^ny S^^l^y as Embassa^^r.
who if they will apply themselves to our purpose may draw all other lesser
unto it, by the example of their authority; or at the least (if they will not
consent in that point) will command their Merchants to repair to our Dominions:
so that we and they may have some good friendly use the one of the other. The
letters you shall appoint to be written to as many and to whom, you will; with
privilege for Merchants, and the secure profession of their Religion and
peaceable possession of their goods, and persons, in as ample sort as your
self will devise; and not only for them but for all Christians whatsoever,
which for curiosity to see, or love to me, will take pains to come hither; or
for any purpose so ever: being impossible their purpose can at any time be
ill toward us, which wish them in all things so well. And because you have
been the Mouer and Perswader of this business, you also shall be the Actor of
it, assuring my self that my Honor cannot be more securely reposed many man's
hands, then your own: both in that I judge of your own disposition; and more,
in that which I know of your obligation to me; besides, There is none so proper
an Executor of any enterprise, S^r A (...) (...) the ^n (...).
as he which is the first deviser of it: I humbly thanked his Majesty for his
confidence; and excused my inhabilitie to perform so great a charge; Many men
being more fit to propound then to execute: That requiring a particular
valor and experience, which I had not. Notwithstanding, since I would not give
his Majesty cause to suspect, that I had intimated such a thing unto him, as
either was so dangerous to carry, or impossible to effect, that I durst not for
those causes undertake it: I would only beseech of his Majesty one of his
Princes, either to be my superior or equal in the Embassage, or such a one as
might be a^solutely my inferior, for a testimony, only of my assured coming
from his Majesty. The first I did require because equal authority where there
is the self same power, is commonly pernitions to all actions, (...)
being impossible to fit two minds of so (...) a temper, that they should not
have some motions of dissen^^^g. Yet if I must be joined, through the gracious
favor (...). Majesty (who had no more end of his honoring me, th^n my
affection had in serving him:) I desired it might (...) a noble man, whose mind
being made to greatness could not feel the ill working of a sudden alteration.
The last I required, not, that such a one could hold any condition in the
former reason, but as an Armor against envy and malice: being a thing
incident, and almost certain in all men's natures to behold with sore eyes the
new grown felicity of others, and to exact a sharp account of their
fortunes, especially in home they have seen, either inferior, or in equality
with themselves. All which he promised: commended my reason and providence in
that point; and offering also presents of great value, and worth to accompany
his Letters, which should be goodly Carpets, Swords and Daggers covered with
Gold, and Jewels, Plumes according to their Country fashion, and other things
worthy to be esteemed, both for the price and rareness. Then he told me I must
recover my self, strengthen my mind and come abroad, that he might feast me
before my departure. And though it is likely that the disposition of the World
(evermore inclined to detraction, then to a generous beholding of men's actions)
will in the iniquity of that nature, hardly believe the magnificent fashion of
that King held toward me then in all points, and confirmed by his infinite
Royal favor, continued and increased to my brother now: Yet the act he did,
does plainly demonstrate, part of the one, and amongst Honorable minds, I
shall be believed for the rest. And though that viper of malice which I so much
feared, did bite me in a maine member of my Honor, and infeebled it so much,
that it remained lame from being able to pass forward in that pase of
reputation, which so great a labor, so many dangers, so great an enterprise,
and so pious an action merited; yet it is impossible that malice it self, much
less the infusion of it in wicked spirits can take from me, the true knowledge
to this time, and memory to posterity, that I was a zealous author of so
Christianlike a purpose: They much mistaking my mind, which judged it rather
capable and desirous of apparent then the true substance of things; though it
be true that every man will contend for both, when both are his right.

For thirty days continually, the King made that feast in a great garden of
more then two miles compass, ^he Persian ^agnifi^ence their so^mne feasts.
under tents pitched by certain small courses of running water, like diverse
rivers, where every man that would come, was placed according to his degree,
either under one or other Tent, provided for abundantly with meat, fruit, and
wine, drinking as they would, some largely, some moderately without
compulsion. A roialty and spl^ndor which I have not seen, nor shall not see
again but by the same King: Our Princes abhorring such vain expenses,
desiring rather to have the power of dominion, then to make those sorts of
ostentation; but such is and has been anciently the custom of that Country
(as the holy Book of God shows us.) And if with so great authority, it^were
needful, or comely to produce other histories, there are diverse which speak
also of many magnificences of those Kings, and of that amongst the rest: and
therefore it is ever to be praised for the constant antiquite, if not for the
reason of the expense. The joy of the feast was much augmented by two great
fortunes, Two great fortunes which befell the king during his feast.

1. The submission of the Tartars to his Crown.


which gave themselves at that time to the King; which were these: The Tartars
of Buckehawrd, (which have ever been of greatest reputation amongst all those
of the Orient, both for their valor in arms and wealth) moved unto it through
their own divisions; the Captains of which being of validity and proper
industry, to inflame the civil dissentions, and unfit to temper their
alternate good successes, ( It being the condition of troubles and disorders to
give most power and authority to those of the worst sort, and most mischievous
spirits: whereas to appease them requires great art, and reposed spirits,)
wearied with the vexation of their own troubles in such a state of things, as
produced nothing but disorders amongst the factious, a desperate rage amongst
the vanquished, and no authority amongst the victors:^ neither the vigor of
the laws standing, none almost of the Princes living: when all these
extremities could not bring them to consent to the erecting of their own
estate, as it first was of an absolut principality, yet by the fame of the king
of Persiaes justice in government, and the felicity which followed all his
enterprises, they were brought to consent vnitely in one to send, and deliver
themselves, and their Country under his subjection. 2. The rich present with
the all^^n^e of the great Mog^r off^^ed to the P^^s^^^.
And the great Moghor King of Labor moved by the like fame, sent a great
Ambassador to desire a marriage between his eldest sons daughter, and Cephir
Micza, a eldest* son to the King of Persia, with a mighty present, and as
mighty offers both of ready money, and to pay 30000. men in any war, which
the King of Persia should undertake for seven years. Such a quality has
prosperity, when it beholds a man, or State, with affectionate eyes to
intru^e it self upon him or it, though themselves would not: an^ sometimes in
things which the wisdom of men holds impossible to be intimated, and
^nfeasible to be executed, which makes wise men often rather to desire them,
then to hope for them.

In this time came unto me a Portingal Friar, named Alphonso Cordero, The
coming of two Friars to insinuate with Sir Anthon, Sherl^y.
of the order of the Franciscans Secular, and an other Armenian Friar of
Jerusalem, with a message from an other Friar of better estimation, called
Nichola Di-Meto: the effect of which was this, that he had been Inquisitor
general of the Indies, and his time being finished, as also, having received
commandment from the Pope and King of Spain to return, and for some other
important causes to the christianity of these parts not being willing to attend
the tedious voyage of the Porting all Fleet by sea, chose rather the hassard to
go over Land: to which he was the more animated having heard of the favor and
estimation which certain Christians held in that Court, which he did not
doubt would Christian-like honor him, being so great an instrument of the
Church, and of so great a Potentate as the King of Spain.

For though we were English and he Portugese, and by the private interresses
of our Princes, their names were made enemies in the ordinary sort of our
Nation, Yet Religious men were ever privileged, from common malice; and that
place which was opposite of it self to the profession of Christ, would be a
persuading argument enough, for any Noble or Pious mind, to honor, in all
persons our oppressed faith, without regarding the title or Country of the
profession thereof. But when he came, though this insinuation of his were like
a good mean; and showed to proceed from the best condition of spirits; Yet he
did so much degenerate from the name of a Christian, much more of a Religious
man, of a true Subject to his Prince, and of a Pious wisher to those things
which tended to the general good of the whole Commonwealth of Christendom,
that he forgot not only the honor which I had freely, and with a good heart
done him (waking again the names of those enmities which he desired to have
suppressed) at the first secretly, at the last openly, setting forth many
pretenses against me: which if it had proceeded from the ordinary
imperfections of na^u^e, (which runs more headingly to the revenge of
injuries even in opinion, then to the record^tion of essenti^ll and ciuid
benefus: gracious acts being a burden, revenge es^eemed a game to us) though
the cause of it had proceeded from that imperfection had been ill; yet being
natural it, had been somewhat tolerable: and if he had not also added to
that fault another inexcusable one, not only to neglect, but even to despise
all those other greater duties: which if they bound him not in affection; yet
they must have bound in awfulnesse and fear an^ C^^^t^re, which had not been
utterly given over to the worst temptations of the wicked spirit, and enemy to
Mankin^ and substantial subuertor of all godly purposes.

For I (though otherwise vnobliged) willing in the beginning of the foundation
which the King permitted me to lay, of God his true knowledge in those parts,
to show all devout respects to God and to all his Ministers and knowing that
the name of division amongst our selves, would but scandalize all) used him
with all those duties and reuerences which I could possibly devise, or any
amb^tious heart could desire: which gave (as it fell out) but a freer passage
to the iniquity of his soul; to my great gri^fe, prejudice of the estimation
in those parts of Religious men, and to the most infinite affliction of the
other Franciscan, that can be expressed; he being certainly a good man, and as
far as his understanding guided him zealous to persuade others to be so,
helping to expres^^ by a sincere and holy example of^i^e what he wanted in
discourse. But vbi Dei numen praetenditur secleribus, subit animum timor, ne
fraudibus humanis vind^candis, diu^ni iuris aliquid inamixtum violemus. For
which reason I will say only this: that to free my self from the unexpected
crosses which daily rose against my business, I pressed the King as hotly (as
ciuilly I could) for my dispatch: which he granted me at the thirty days
end: having appointed Assan, Chan a gallant young Prince to go with me: so
complete in all worthy graces that if God had pleased, that he had proceeded
in the business, he had brought great Honor to the King, reputation to his
Country, and had established the affairs to the universal good of the World.
But the beginnings of all great things being derived from God, so their ends
are either perfected or disanu^led by his determination. For though nature has
given us as men great and excellent faculties, yet GOD will have us know, and
acknowledge him to be GOD: and that nothing is properly our own, or gotten by
our own power but given us only through his munificencie. And therefore
peradventure, The enterprise of ^ur A^ti^^^ Sl^^^^ o^ert^^o vne by his own
Inst^^ment.
GOD would not so much satisfy the pride which the very love of affecting so
great and glorious a business had swollen me in: but made me my self find an
instrument to overthrow my labors and wrestle against my proceedings (which
durst not almost stand in my presence) and forced me to a^ke him of the King,
and to be the Author of my own h^rme. So strangely does God correct the
errors and sins of our humanities, and takes from the strong imagination:
which stir in us (through the innated iniquity of our hearts.) the thoughts
of any other causes of those inflictions, then that true working of his very
judgments: by which we may see if we will not be obstinate against ourselves,
that the full use of those things which we possess, the very light which we
enjoy, the spaces of the Earth which our feet tread over, whatsoever we can
do, say, or think, is raised, distributed and guided, by God his counsel,
will and providence. For when it was concluded that Assan Chan should go, and
his provisions were all ready, my commission and parent (for the principal
points of my business) sealed; the King married him to an Aunt of his much
against his Princes will and more to my grief; none other of the great ones
having a spirit to apprehend only such a voyage, much less a heart to perform
it.

So that being instantly sued to by Cuchin-Allibi a Courtchie of six Thomans
stipend by the year, and in disgrace also, for some ill part that he had
played, I (pressed thereunto by the Viseir and Bastan Aga) spoke unto the king
that he might go with me, in the form only of a testimony, though honored
with some good words in the letters, for the bettter reputation of the
business: which the King was exceeding backward in consenting unto, desiring
me either to go alone, or better accompanied. The last I told him lay in his
Majesty's power to command; the other I could not do, and promise him, or hope
my self for good success: nothing being more frail then such a reputation
(as would suddenly grow by such a business) vnsupported by any sort of
strength, so that it would be an object for all sort of malice to work upon,
his Majesty being too far removed to give just proof of my employment from
him, if it should be opposed. And the more strange it was, and less hoped for,
as it would be the more joyfully embraced by the good. So it would give the
more color* and strength to bad minds against me. At the last (I think
through the secret working of those which were ever enemies to the proceeding
of this business, and the mainescarcitie of others which had minds fit for
such employment, and qualities also fit for such minds.) I was urged to take
that fellow, and the king content to let him go. But would bestow on him no
more then 50. Tomans for the whole expense: which he called also cast away. Him
I left to bring the appointed present after me; and the letters to the
particular Princes; which were then ready at my departure not sealed, and the
present not thoroughly provided: my self desiring to free my self from the
Court, where every occasion was received by those which were contrary to the
enterprise to hinder it.

After I had taken my leave of the king, the morning before my departure he
came to find me again at my house: The cause^ for whi^^ the King of ^^^s^a
deta^ned Sir Robert S^^rley.
and after a little other speech he said unto me, that my absence from him
would exceedingly griue him, his affection to me being true, and his hopes of
me many. If he had been furnished of any sit to have undergone the mannagement
of this affair, he would never have enjoined me to so much travail, and so
many perils, but that I knew his Court to be ignorant of the language and
properties of ^ur parts, and since he was provoked by me to send thi^her, he
knew that I would be contented with my labor to keep him, and his from all
sorts of scorn. That my brother was young, and therefore the more to be
tendered, and not every day to be exposed to new labors: his love to us both
made him careful in that point, but more particularly his infinite desire of
my return; which he thought would be more assured by so dear a pawn: And by
daily relation which I should receive of his royal usage, I should also be
daily invited to return howsoever. If I met with such fortunes as would be
worthy to make me stay from him; or such accidents as had power to hinder me by
their necessity; the company of my brother should give him great satisfaction
in my absence. And if the worst should happen unto me, he did desire ever to
have a subject so near unto me, upon whom he might make a declaration unto the
world, both of what quality his own mind was; and of what condition his true
and royal affection toward me was.

Before I could answer this infinite favorable and and gracious speech of
his: my Brother (whose mind, ever disposed him to the best things) having by
his own nature, and excellent spirit (which in his younger years he bettered
with higher studies, not as many who under a magnificent title, love slothful
idleness, but using them in their true property) to confirm our ordinary
weakness against the tempests of fortune, The ab^se wi^h the true and ^roper
v^e o^ studies.
and to learn by the goodly precepts of wise men, that which the frailty of
man's constitution blinds from our sight: and to esteem only good that which
is honest, and evil those things which do participate with viciousness. And
though he might ar^ogate as much to the Nobi^itie of his blood, as the best
borne Gentleman may, S^r Anton, Sherleys com^^ndation of his brothe Sir Robert
S^erley.
yet (ever making estimation of that, and other such qualified ornaments as
were without the mind, neither to be accoun^ed amongst the special good or
ill things which a man should truly behold in himself) he has and does
contend more with himself to be worthy of the best titles, then to be esteemed
by those he has, contemning equally riches and superfluity, and poverty
which grows by a man's own vice: being steadfast and just in good things, and
constant against all fear: and if he be guided by the height of his mind to
strive with more fervor then wariness, for glory and reputation, the best
judging sort of the world know that the covetousness of that point of eternity
is the last appetite which the wisest men dispoile themselves of. Neither am I
induced to celebrate so much the memory of so many virtues as I know in him,
because he is my brother: but absolutely am led unto it without favor or
ambition, by the persuasion only of a good conscience, for the sole merit and
reward of the same. That mind I say of his ever counseled by such thoughts,
apprehending that his staying with the king, might be of wonderful effect, to
keep his mind constant in the resolution which he had taken: and gessing at
many occasions which might happen in my absence, the well using of which might
confirm him more: some also if they were not tempered might cool his
resolutions (which he knew to be taken rather to satisfy me, and with an
intent to see the success of the proceeding of things, then a more constant
determination) answered the king, Sir Robert S^erleys answer to the King of
Persia.
presently thus. That our two souls were so vnitely conjoined, that our wills
were divided in nothing, our affections to his Majesty, and our desires to
serve him were the same, and such as they could not be separated from his
commandments. And though the promise of favors from him which could command,
did bring ever with it the force of necessity, yet we both were so clear in
the judgment of the royal disposition of his Majesty that he would neither
absolutely will, nor seem to desire of us any thing but that which should be
honorable for his authority, and convenient for our obedience to be done by
us. The parting of both our bodies from his presence was nothing, in respect of
our best parts which ever should attend his Majesty with vows, and profers,
and wishes which were worthy to proceed from his true servants and friends.
And as worthy of his infinite virtues. But because he did desire to have one
of us which was himself to remain with him, he would do it, and give his
Majesty so much greater occasion to love us both by that effect of virtue
which he should prove in him, tempering the necessity of his passion, for his
Majesty's satisfaction, and better purposes which time and such occasions as
must needs be brought forth, should show his Majesty. Neither did he incline
at all to do this for any feeling which he would have in that point of his
Majesty's munificences promised, but only for the sensiblenesse of doing well
which he thought and knew he should do by obeying his Majesty in that
commanding request. He did confess notwithstanding that the world could not
lay upon him a greater adversity, then to be separated from me: yet he would
never be so broken with any fortune, (though it should rise from other causes)
as to loose the least title of the dignity of his mind. His years were but
few, but neither gray heirs nor wrinckles should (with so wise an
understanding judgment as his Majesty's) give more authority to any then the
good fruits proceeding from an honest and virtuous spending of the time which
a man has passed: he did desire no more favor with his Majesty for his
staying then his other merits should be worthy of: yet because he was left
alone without other comfort then what his own heart gave him, he would be
confident that his Majesty would not forget what he owed to himself as a
Prince, nor to him as a Gentleman which had freely matched obedience with
affection. What my brother shall effect with the Princes Christian, as it is a
thing uncertain; so he nor I will promise any thing: but I know he will
industriate himself to his uttermost for your Majesty's honor and service,
and I will hope well of the end of his labors. In the mean time I beseech
God, since the Turks love cannot apply it self by no means to your Majesty,
that their hatreds may continue one against the other: no destiny being able to
urge faster forward the greatness of your Dominion, nor no fortune being of
more validity to make an even way unto it, then the amity of our Princes, and
eternal discord amongst your enemies. I was almost saying, that God would
prosper your Majesty in all things; but certainly I trust he will: and I say
so, since it belongs more rightly to his great Holiness, and to our
reverence to believe constantly of his deeds then to know them. And this great
reason I have of my confidence, the greatness which God has given your
Majesty joined to so great and excellent virtues* which questionles are
appointed to some great and extrordinary end. Then that your Majesty has
pleased not to deceive your self in this withering peace which you have with
the Turk, which is more delighting for the present, then safe for the future:
that rest being ever false, which is taken amongst inopulent and strong
neighbors.

The Ambassador having showed by his arrogancy in speaking, that when there
shall be given a fit opportunity for doing, modesty and honesty will be only
names of times past. And your just and good proceeding in an adversity of
fortune, will be esteemed such a weakness as is far from you and their good
success, will be attributed to their valor and wisdom. And though your
Majesty in the sublime excellency of your royal mind do ever number fortune
amongst doubtful things, and virtue amongst the certain: yet true wisdom of
the world will always care to strengthen the one with the other, by so proper
a concurre^ce, that your virtue shall ever have the attendance of fortune, to
fill your Majesty with good and glorious acts, and the world with good and
famous words, and relations.

These words of his were graciously and tenderly received of the king, and
after some tears on al parts, the king and himself having brought me some
six miles, we all parted they for the Court, my self for my journey, having
first left with my brother, my heart certainly, not only for the conjunction
which nature had made between us, but also for those worthy sparks, which I
found in him likely to be brought to great perfection by his virtue, which
cannot leave working in any, which will give them way, much more in him, who
will make way for them.

And besides diverse instructions (which though he ted not) yet the common duty
of those which are bound in so near respects as we are, Sir Anthony She^ley^
instructions and advice to his brother Sir Robert She^ley, when he left him in
Persia.
required not deeds of want, but abundance all benefits loo^ing much of their
splendour, both in the giver and receiver, that do bear with them an
exprobratiue term of necessity:) first, I desired him to remember, that his
fortune and safety in that place subsisted only upon the kings favor, which in
virtuous princes was ever to be maintained by virtue: That Princes ^ares and
eyes were in every place, Courts being full of spies, and nothing hidden from
emulation; which by how much more it would be carried covertly; so much more
would it be dangerous, against which he could prevail of nothing better then
his own innocence, and patience, the one of which would preserve him from all
fault; the other from peril; the wisdom of men ouercomming more by working of
time, the^ by violent passions which do never remove the ill, but only open
secret imperfections, which give power to our enemies to work upon, and the
more courage by prevailing themselves upon error and weakness. But because
for what belonged to the good government of himself, I knew that he could
have no better precepts then those which his own mind would give him, I would
only desire him that neither absence, nor opinions, which might rise through the
tediousnes of long abse^ce, nor ill instruments might prevail so fa^re with
him as to make any breach in his affection toward me: our perfect union
tending to both our preseruations, and reciprocal increase of both our
fortunes. The bond of Nature and ^^oud.
Time, Fortune, or sometimes ambition, and other errors might diminish, change,
and dissolve private friendships; but our own blood was ever vnalterably the
same and though in the freenes of our natures, others usually participite of
our prosperities: yet none so fully as those which are bound by so dear titles
of nature, and our adversities no man would ever feel but our selves, neither
could the Kings affection increase, or be constant to any of us both, if it
were not indeared by our own example. The cause of his staying with the King,
though his commandment and desire bare the color of it; yet essentially and
truly it was to advance the great work, of which God had laid the foundation
and had chosen us, for true instruments, not moving it by Emperors, Kings or
Princes, but by so humble Agents, questionless for the greater retribution of
his glory: for which we must care as his servants and creatures in all things:
but most in this as particularly directed by him to it. And though it was
likely that God his infinite wisdom would not fail to subminister eternally to
his understanding, proper and convenient means of proceeding for the
perfection of his own work: yet we should find, that some great part of those
means are insensibly infused into our reasons, the instruction of which in
good things we must ever follow as his, and though that we speak, and speak
always as men, notwithstanding when it pleased God to prosper the effect of
our conceptions: questionless, there is a greater power predominant then man's.
What, we have diverse times proiected secretly together, God you see has
perfected, and therefore we may boldly say, more intending to that end, upon
the same confidence and assurance: Wherefore, when you shall either by the
Kings own motion or others importunde occasions fall in discourse with him upon
any point of these affairs: you must know, Negotiation with Princes.
that as all Princes ought to lay the foundation of all their enterprises upon
these three maine rocks, the Justice of the cause, Facility of the enterprise,
and fruit of the victory: so in negotiations with them you must never be so
confident upon those points, especially, the best of equity and justice, as
upon the true experience and knowledge of the Princes disposition, who either
jealous to hazard or ambitious to get, attends ordinarily to interest and
profit, and not to what he ought to do, neither in the uprightness of this
honor, or faith given, or obligation of precedent favor or benefit: Therefore
since being too secure does but give way, to danger and the knowledge of the
worst is the best means to prevent all that may be ill, let not your desires
of promouing this great and good business, blind you from foreseeing all sorts
of preoccupations, which we both have ta^ed of, and you alone may perchance
find greater, but not beholding too fixed and steadfastly what the King in
equity, and the truth of the cause should do: penetrate into the soul of the
actio^, the stability, or mutablenesse of his nature: his ordinary or forced
inclinations.

Finally into his present humors or ^uture likely pretenses, and then present
him with those reasons which your best judgment, shall have provided for him
in fit time and with a well understanding dexterity.

The factio^s of the Court you must make your self learned in and bear your
self wisely and uprightly between both; Factions of the Court.
you having no strength to add power to any of both: but any of those having
power to subvert you; so that by showing to understand those that are against
you, you shall but make them your more apparent enemies and by depending
absolutely upon the other procure no assured strength to our self, but a
demonstration without effect, and whenever they shall ioyn together for their
own interesses (which often happens between factions in Courts) you shall be
left a pray to those which hate you; whose revenge shall be certain, the others
faith nothing. The corruptions of all Courts giving a license to great men to
serve their turns upon lesser, in all things and more then for that to regard
them in nothing. Besides the ordinary dispositions of such is to wink at our
private friends mischief, and as you must not declare your self soly for the
one, nor wholly against the other; so you must not covertly bear them both in
hand that you are theirs: such artifice being of the poorest and weakest
condition, nothing being able to be hid from the spying eyes in Court, and such
an illusion once perceived, is so far without remedy as every man will hate
you and no man trust you. You must then bear your self equally to all,
keeping all friends and making no enemies depending upon no man, Factions.
but your own virtue and worthiness, and his affection, which in the
perfection of his own royal mind, is only to be preserved by honest ways.

In cases of your business you shall need use no such diligence as frame,
partialities, factions being already made and animated and armed, watching
with the very strength of their desires to advance their Honors by the good
or ill success of it.

Rumors.
You must be constant against rumors, and beware to be noted a willing bearer
of such reports as may either touch any in Honor or otherwise to be taken for
an offense, and may give your self cause of suspicion, for any of those bring
extrinsicke danger, or intrinsicke errors from both which you must live free
and vnattained. You shall hear many speak sometimes through their own
imperfections sometime to prove yours, Speeches.
and sometimes to please (as they think) the company: but you must know that
all hearts are not of one complexion: and you shall hazard ever to Card ill,
that play to please one by displeasing another, since benefits ever be more
easily forgotten then iniures, and though the respect of common friendship (and
almost societiere) quire otherwise; yet such wrongs are without means of
revenge, and good turns are without memory of recompense. Inconstancy.
You must avoid inconstancy and the very appearance of lightness as a
dangerous downfall: for where it is, there is neither understanding or
judgment to discern the actions of others nor gravity to measure that which
properly belongs to your self: besides the world by taking notice of your
infirmity will always fear volubilitie in all your actions.

Finally, though I am most assured virtue has so great power in your mind,
and your own understanding so full of all good things, that you may be an
example to my precepts: Yet I will say this, not as needing, but in the
necessity of my love; which desires more then it doubts of. Give your self
(dear Brother) to learn of the best: fashion your self to the most worthy
examples which you have seen, aspire to nothing for vanity or ostentation,
neglect no good thing for fear, and mingle equally awfulnesse to offend, and
diligence to proceed worthily in all your actions: And you shall have favor
from the King, love from the best, hatred from none, security from all, honor
from the effects which will proceed from your doings; and God will bless you
with his mercy, directing your ways to his glory, to good ends: and so to
good example among these misbeleeuers, with who^ for a time it is your fortune
to live, and to raise from this place, a long lasting glory and reputation to
your self; and name for ever.

And this was all my exceeding sorrow could force it self to utter: and the
King returning also (whom my Brother must follow) interrupted the course of any
longer discourse of mine, or his answer.

But when I came to Casbin, though I knew his mind both by nature, and
learning, as plentifully furnished as a Gentleman might be, who had hopeful
conditions in himself, and all the additions which the tender care of
friends, and his own diligently well-spent time could give him: Yet
understanding well in how dangerous a sea his young years were to nauigate, and
that no addition of providence could be superfluous firmly to support his own
security, and the maine end of our great business: having compiled (as well
as the shortness of the time of my abiding in that place would suffer me, and
as much as I could bring to any sort of fashion out of so imperfect a mould as
that of my little understanding) these remnants of the chief properties of a^l
estates, to give him the better light how clearly to see into that wherein he
was; and to help the way of his business, according to the motives which it
was like) he might receive by the commandment of some of our Princes from
hence: desiring him with all to remember, that Court carriages were riddles,
which though seen, could not be resolved without exceeding patience, and well
judging experience. And that by no means he should fly from his own virtue,
to make his foundation upon the Kings favor, Princes ever having this
imperfection almost inseparable to their greatness, to be infinite voluble,
and as their minds are large, so they easily ouerlooke their first favors,
which they purposed, and can as hardly love truly, as acknowledge a benefit:
their disposition being to be easily glutted with the present, and hope better
of the future, especially having no other necessity in the constant carrying of
their affections, then their own satisfactions. And these other trifles which
I lent him, I did wish him to ouerlooke as grounds, only for his spirit to
discourse more largely upon: desiring by them to point unto him that exercise,
which the cause that we were entered in, made not only fittest for his mind
to use, but most necessary; our fortune having then given into our management
the good or ill of diverse states, according to the success of our employment.
And since there is a certain judgment of the event of things, according to
the perfect or imperfect disposition of the body, by which those things are to
be effected: his judgment would be the better to discourse, and discern what
the proceeding of this business was like to be, by understanding the principal
elements, by which the body of all estates are compacted, and then by dilating
with himself the good or defective mixture in every particular state, which
he knew by his own experience and others relation.

Those Elements which give both matter and being, to those huge bodies, were
Counsel, Force, and Reputation.

The Form, were the Laws which Aristotle calls Men's sine appetitu.

The Organ by which this work, and the whole body moves to his end, is the
Prince and his Ministers. But because the time I had was so short as I could
but briefly speak of all these, I did conclude them in the Discourse which I
gave him of these three maine foundations, Counsel, Force, and Reputation.

FINIS.
