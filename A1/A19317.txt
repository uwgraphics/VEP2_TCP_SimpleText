Prologus of Robert Copland the auctor.
AT Brentforde on ye west of London
Nigh to a place that called is Syon
There dwelt a widow of a holy sort
Honest in substance and full of sport
Da^ly she could with pastime and Jests
Among her neighbors and her guests
She kept an Inn of right good lodging
For all estates that thither were coming
It chanced this widow as it is supposed
In her sport and merrily disposed
After her death for a remembrance
Thought to have some matter of pastance
For people to laughe at in such company
As are disposed for to talk merrily
Mingled with many proper scoffs and boords
Of sundry tauntes with some me^y words
The which I have heard at many seasons
Full of pastime with pretty reasons
For if any did a thing overthwart
They said ever ye shall have a fart
Of Iyll of Brantford for your pain
The which laying often troubled my brain
For I never kn^w what the matter was
Nor could the meaning bring to pass
Till at the last upon a day
I met on John hardlesay
A merry fellow in each company
Which said Copland thou look dry
The truth quod I is as ye say
For I drank not of all this day
And of a short tale to make an end
to the red lion at the shambles end
We went for to drink good ale
and as he was telling his tale
I offered him for to drink first
Copland quoth he art thou a thirst
And bids me before the to drink
to my judgment I do think
Of Iyll of Brentforde worthy thou art
by her bequest to have a fart
And truly now is come to my mind
not long ago how I did find
An old scrow all ragged and rent
beseming it is some merry intent
As diverse say that do it reed
but gallant toys there semes indeed
It is Antic, broken / and so raced
that all the cheef is clean defaced
Take it and I pray the heartily
look thereon and if thou espy
That it be of any substance
of mirth or of honest pastaunce
And where thou spiest that it does want
or where for lack the matter is scant
Put to it as is according
to the matter in every thing
Keep it with thee, and take sum pain
the poor mare shall have his man again
When I came home, at leisure
My heart not parfitly at pleasure
For the loss of a certain friend
As God knows few be to find
For recreation I it took
to pas the time thereon to look
And of troth often in the reding
it did stir me to fall on smiling
Considering the pretty pastime
and rydicle order of the rhyme
The covert terms, under a merry sense
showing of many the blind insolence
Taunting of things past and to come
where as my self was hit with some
And for that cause I did intend
after this manner to have it pend
Praying all them that merry be
if it touch them not to blame me
An end of the prologue.
Here follows the preface and Testament of mistres Iyllyen of Braintford
THis merry widow mastres Iyllian
On a day dysposed joyfully
By any way that I presuppose can
Ordained a little banquet of deinty
At the which to bear her company
For certain of her neighbors she sent
and for her Curat to be there present
Praying him for to bring paper and ynke
To write somewhat after her intent
She made him cheer of her meat and drink
That done she said, this is mine intent
That you as now shall write my testament
For I do feel that age does me oppress
Good is to have all thing in readiness
My neighbors here shall be with you record how I am penitent at this making
And whole of mind now thanks to our Lord how be it I have often a shrewd shaking
Ye shall be pleased for your pain taking yea maistres quod he I am your curate
I am bound to serve you erly and late
Well than quod she, In dei nomine Amen
My soul I ^equeth to our Lord almight
He has it made, it is his own then he has it bought, it is his be right
In heaven to be in the eternal light and to the earth I bequethe my body
It is his own I can it not deny
My sins all I commit to the Devil let him take them with him to hell
For he was the causer of all mine evil
My goods to the world of I do well
For they be his I can it not expel
here I found them, here they must remain
Save fame and name I leave nothing certain
Now unto my friends, reason is I should have a singular aspect by nature
I give unto them all that they hold
As Much as I do to any creature if they get ought then are they sure
After my death if they do for me
I bequethe to them of my charity
But now good sir I pray you for to take
This cup of ale and drink ones for Gods sake
For I am disposed to ordain a dole
to all manner people through a hole
For I would not have to over much prease
Lest that with throng my alms should cease
Now ye have drunk ones good ghostly father
I trust for to make an end the rather
And write as I do bid you hardly
I bequethe a fart to him that is angry
with his friend, and wots not why
To him that sells all his heritage
And all his life lives in seruage
I bequethe a fart, for him in his age
He that sets by no man, nor none by him
And to promotion fain would clim
I bequethe a fart, for to make him trim
He that will not learn, and can do nothing
And with lewd folk, is ever conuersing
I bequethe a fart, toward his living
He that boroweth, without advantage
And ever more renueth in arrerage
I bequeath a fart for to lie to gage
He that gives, and keeps naught at all
And by kindenes to poverty does fall
Shall have a fart to help him with all
He that is ever wayward at heart
And with every man is overthwart
For to please him I bequethe a fart
He that has drink in his hand and is dry
Bidding him drink first that stands him by
I bequethe a fart his thirst to satisfy
He that has a fa^re wench in bed all night
And kisseth her not onse or it be day light
Shall have a fart to cleanse his eye sight
He that lends a horse with all things meet
and on his own voyage goes on his feet
Shall have a fart to keep him fro weet
He that suffers all manner of offense
and loses his goods through negligence
Shall have a fart for a recompense
He that takes a wife and has nothing
and boroweth althing to them belonging
I will a fart toward their offering
He that prepares not for his household
Against winter, and him self is old
Shall have a fart, to keep him from cold
He that goes to a feast, to sup or to dine
and has no knife with him, neither course nor fie
Shall have a fart, for to drink with his wine
He yt boroweth so much, til none will lend him
and swereth so much / til none will believe him
Shall have a fart / for to relieve him
He that mourns for that, he cannot have
and impossible to get, that he does crave
Shall have a fart / as a foolish knave
He that does nothing, but shave and poll
and takes no thought / to save his soll
Shall have a fart, his passing bell to toll.
A Prentice, or servant that will not obey
and will not learn, but often run away
a fart for his freedom, I do puruay.
He that suffers his wife to do her lust
and sees that to folly she is full trust
Shall have a fart, though I should burst.
A widdowe that once, has been in the brake
and cares not whom that she does take
Shall have a fart, though mine at sake
A maid that marries, not caring whom
And does repent when she comes home
Shall have a fart to by her a come
He that does drink evermore
and will not shift to pay therefore
Shall have a fart for to set on his score
He that goes to a fray at the beginning
and to a good meal at the latter ending
Shall have a fart for his good attending
He that goes often where he is not welcome
And to his friends house goes but seldom
Shall have a fart for his good wisdom
Maistres Iyll Now hold your hand make a stay there
How many farts have I bequest here
For by my trothe I am almost weary

The Curat. For sooth maistres / here is four and twenty

Maistres Iyll Nay set in one mo to make a hole quarteron

Curat Tell me what, and it shall be done anon

Maistres Iyll Mary he that does his wepon lend
And has nothing him self to defend
Shall have a fart, and there an end
These I do bequethe in especial
But as for all the other in general
that are without number shall not be swarued
But dealt to all such as have them deserved
But tarry I pray you all if ye please
For I feel me sudenly evil at ease
It is a stich, rumbling in my side
which does grieve me at many a tide
I must rest me til the pang be gone
For other medisin know I none
It comes in manner of a wind
That causes my belly for to grind
I fear it will turn to a strangury
to an vndom, or to a timpany
With qualmes and stitches it does me torment
that all my body is torn and rent
I have a little box full of diaculum
I dare not for nigardship take sum
I wisse I am unwise so for to spare it
For I should take thereof a fore the fit

The Curat. With that she groned as panged with pain
griping her belly with her hands twain
And lift up her buttok somewhat a wry
and like a handgun, she let a fart fly

Maistres Iyll. Ah sira, mary a way the mare
the devil give thee sorrow and care
For thou had me almost slain
I pray God thou come never again

The Curat. With that sum laughed / and sum did frown
and for shame held their heads down

Mistres Iyll Be merry neighbors, much good do it you
I thank God, I am well eased now
Lo there is my greef gone and past
I wist well that it would not long last
I pray you all for to be merry
I give it among this company
For to make you some cheer with all
For I tell you mine executors shall
Never have all by God I swear
I will deal while I am here
Now and than, where as I list
By Christ I tell you, I have a chest
Full that shall be open while I live
Secretly and openly for to give
I shall have enough / I will not them spare
As well for other, as mine own welfare
When I am dead they that come after me
Shall dele the rest, at their necessity
Therefore as now, this is sufficient
As concerning this said Testament
To subscribe your names it shall not skill
For I make it but a copy of a will
As touching the choice of mine executours
Of my funeralles / and suruciours
And other trifles ye shall not take the pains
Another time when it comes in my brains
It shall be ordered after such a sort
That some shall not take it as a sport
But neighbors I pray you be not angry
Because that I am to bold and homly
To keep you here at my foolish reason
Some will think my wits be geson
But yet I tell you that all this season
We have neither said herely nor treason
And if they take it never so at hearts
I wis it is but a bequest of farts
Willed to them that with out aduisement
Do that thing where they repent
Therefore I will you no longer trouble
What maid, come hither I shrew your neck
Bring us up shortly a quart of Seck
a cuple of Bunnes and set us some cheese
Lo friends, ye shall not all your labor leese
I have as now no better cheer to make you
Be merry and welcome, to God I betake you

Finis.


The auctor
WHen ye company was all passed and gone
And ye curate with maistris Iil alone
maistres quod he, if it be your plesance
ye know it is ye custom and ordinance
Of them that write a deed indenture or Bil
That it is or right, reason and skill
Some recompense of labor for to have
Give what ye lust, for I will not crave
By our Lady quod she, that is but well said
What Johan How / come hither maid
Go call the company again to me
For I have to say / two words or three
When they came, she said neighbors I pray
you bear record what I do say
I sent for you / for a certain purpose
which a fore you I did disclose
The truth is so, after the same rate
I did send also for master Curat
To write the same my simple Testament
Now indeed, as is convenient
He does ask for his labor therefore
indeed, because he made no bargain before
And does put it to my conscience
Truly this shall he have for a recompense
And because before hand he knew not my mind
he shall not find me to him unkind
A fart and a half / I will give him no les
nor no more this is of my gentleness
For be ye woorketh unknowing what to have
Not half a fart is worthy for to crave
And beside that, a hood full of bells
why quod the priest, get I nothing else
Than to the devil, I give whole fart half and all
nay take it thy self, foolish sir hoball
Sir John whipdok, sir Iak whipstock
Sir John smelsmock, as wise as a woodcok
A hedge Curat, with as much wit as a Calf
To sit so long for a fart and a half
But to prove your brains to be thinner
Or ever ye go / pay for your dinner
This she railed as her manner was to jest
and so without farwell lost her daily gest
Finis.
Thus ends Iyll of Brainfords testament containing xxvi. farts and a half.
An exhortation.
My masters I pray you all that shall reed
Or hear this little pretty fantasy
Passing forth meryly in it to proceed
The manner how for to dele most egally
This half fart, truly for to try
That the Curat, for his part be not denied
Of the fart and the half, and let the rest ly
and who shall have ye half among you to be tried
In this matter if you do agree
Who shall have this half fart, say ye?
Imprinted at London by me William Copland.
