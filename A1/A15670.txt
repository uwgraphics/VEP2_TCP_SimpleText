Half a dozen of good Wives.
All for a penny.

Kind Cozens or Countrymen what ere you be,
If you want a good pennyworth, come buy it of me,
Six Wives for a penny a young one or old,
A cleanely good huswife, a Slut or a Scold.
To the tune of, The clean contraryway.



IF any standers by
that leads a single life,
Desirous be of marriage,
and feign would have a Wife,
Unto the sign of Fortune,
let him forthwith repair,
And either she or I will help
such customers to ware;
For in my time I have
made proof of half a dozen,
And if thou have a mind unto't,
come take one honest Cozen,
oh come take her honest Cozen.
The first of all my Wives
did prove so cross a Dame.
What ere I said she still would do
contrary to the same,
She is so obstinate,
that she must have her will.
And let me do the best I can,
she will be Master still:
Oh this was my good Wife,
the best, etc.
Besides all these good parts,
she has humors five or six,
Though I please her nere so well at home,
she will play the meretrixe,
For if my back be turned,
abroad the straight must gad,
And to be brief she is so cross,
as I am ene horne-mad:
O this was my first Wife,
the best, etc.
The second wife I had,
was not so light as she,
But yet she had I speak to her praise,
as rare a quality.
A thrifty Dame she was,
which proved her greatest fault,
She let the Maggots crawle in the meat,
to save the charge of Salt:
Oh this was my good Wife,
the best of the half dozen, etc.
And when she went to Market,
good penny worth^ she bought,
The cheap'st she laid her hands upon,
she always with her brought,
But if that I disliked
what she had done that day,
She Would keep the best until it stunke,
and thr^w the rest away:
O this was my good Wife,
the best, etc.
The third was some what cleanely,
but yet a drunken Sot,
She Would pawn all things for Ale and Beer,
what ever she had got,
She scarce would leave a smock,
or shoe unto her foot,
But at the Alehouse all these went
and some what else to boot:
O this was my good Wife,
the best of the half dozen,
And if you are weary of a single life,
Then take her honest Cozen.
O then take her honest Cozen.
The second part. To the same Tune.


BUt yet she had skill in spinning,
with her the world runs on wheels:
On any ground where ere she comes,
she cannot stand, but reeles:
And yet but once a week
with drink she is overtaine,
Which lasts still from Sunday night,
till Sunday come again.
Oh this was my good wife,
the best of the half dozen,
And if thou art weary of a single life,
then take her honest cosen,
oh then take her honest cosen.
The fourth good Wife of mine
was wondrous careful ^ent,
She had a care of the maine-chance,
to see how all things went:
She never would be quiet,
if from her sight I were,
For fear lest I should spend it all,
and she not have a share.
Oh this was my good wife,
the best, etc.
And if unto a Tavern
without her I had gone,
She would be there as soon as I,
Oh 'twas a loving one.
And for my ill husbandry
she would keep a pittious ^o^le,
And call me Rogue and Cuckold too:
but what was she the while?
I think one of my A^^^,
the best, etc.
The fifth was a good old woman,
and had great care of me:
Now could she (...) for by her age
she might my (...) be.
And though I say it my self,
she stood me in great stead,
I durst trust her in any place,
and never fear my head:
O this was one of my wives,
the best, etc.
Yet if I chanced to kiss,
or on a young wench look;
You would not think poor harmles (...)
how pitiously she took't:
For often times she would blame me,
that I abroad should rome,
And love another, when I had,
so good a piece at home:
O this was my good wife,
the best, etc.
But oh the last of all,
she had an excellent tongue,
Which is the rarest property,
that does to a woman belong;
And if I had but vexed her,
she used her tongue so well,
As when she to the purpose spoke,
it sounded like a Bell:
O this was my good Wife,
the best, etc.
She was so good a wife,
I must praise her again:
For she excelled all the Scolds,
that dwell in Turne-agen Lane ^
I speak as I have felt her,
for thee banged me once so sore,
As I have vowed ere since that ti^^
never to marry more.
But here do leave my wives,
in number half a dozen,
And for a penny will sell all,
then take them honest cozen,
oh then take them honest cozen.
And now good women all,
whosoever hears this Song,
I do no private person tax,
to do them any wrong.
But if you take exceptions,
the thorn you know will prick,
And if you touch a galled Horse bac^e,
the Proverb says he will kick.
For I make mention of
no less than half a dozen:
Then whosoere is angry now,
will prove my honest cozen,
oh will prove my honest cozen.
FINIS.
