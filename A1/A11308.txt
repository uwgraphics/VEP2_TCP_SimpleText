The first dialogue in Englisshe / with new additions.





Here after follows the first Dyaloge in English / betwyxte a Doctor of
Divinity / and a Stude^t in the laws of England of the grounds of the said
Laws / and of conseyence / newly corrected: and eft sons Enprynted with new
additions
The Introduccion.
A Doctoure of divinity that was of great acquayntaunce / and familiarity
with a Student in the laws of England said thus unto him / I have had great
desire of long time to know where upon the law of England is grounded / but
because much part of the law of England is written in the french tongue.
Therefore I can not through mine own study atteygne to the knowledge thereof:
for in that tongue I am nothing expert. And because I have always found the a
faithful friend to me in all my busynes. Therefore I am bold to come to the
before any other to know thy mind what be the very grou^des of the law of
England as thou thynkest.

Student) that would ask a great leisure / and it is also above my conning to
do it. Nevertheless that thou shall not think that I would wilfully refuse to
fulfill thy desire: I shall with good will do that in me is to satisfy thy
mind / but I pray the that thou will first show me somewhat of other laws
that pertayne most to this matter: and that Doctoures treat of how laws
have begone. And then I will gladly show the as me tynketh what be the
grou^des of the law of England.


Doctoure) I will with good will do as thou sayste: wherefore thou shall
understand that Doctors treat of four laws / the which as me seems
pertayne most to this matter. The first is the law eternal. The second is
the law of nature of reasonable creature / the which as I have hard say is
called by them that be learned in the law of England the law of reason. The
third is the law of god. The fourth is the law of man. And therefore I will
first treat of the law eternal.


Of the law eternal. The first Chapitre.
DOctoure) like as there is in every artificer a reason of such things as are
to be made by his craft / so like ^^se it behooves that in every governor
there be a reason and before sight in the governor of such things as shall be
ordered and done by him: to the^ that he has the governance of. And for as
much as almightye god is the creator and maker of all creatures / to the
which he is compared as a workema^ to his works. And is also the governor of
all deeds and mouynges that be found in any creature. Therefore as the reason
of the wisdom of god in asmoche as creatures be creat by him has the reason
and foresight of all crafts and warkes that have been or shall be / so the reason
of the wisdom of god mouynge all things by him made to a good end /
opteyneth the name and reason of a law / and that is called the law eternal.
And this law eternal is called the first law / and it is well called the
first / for it was before all other laws. And all other laws be deriuied of
it / whereupon saint Augustine says in his first book of fre arbytrement that
in temporal laws nothing is rightwyse ne lawful / but that the people have
deriuied to them out of the law eternal. wherefore every man has right and
title to have that he has rightwysely of the rightwyse Judgment of the first
reason / which is the law eternal.


Student) but how may this law eternal be known / for as the Apostle
writtet in the.v. chapitre. of his first Epistle to the Corynthies. Quesu^t
dernemo scit nisi spiritus dei. That is to say: no man knows what is in god /
but the spirit of god / wherefore it seems that he opens his mouth in to
heaven that attempteth to know it.


Doctoure) this law eternal no man may know as it is in it self / but only
blessed souls that se god face to face / but almighty god of his goodness
shows of it as much to hes creatures as is necessary for them / for else god
should bind his creatures to a thing inpossible. which may in no wise be
thought in him. Therefore it is to understand that three manner of ways
almightye god makes this law eternal known to his creatures reasonable.
First by the light of natural reason. Second by heavenly reuelacion. Thyrdly
by the order of a prince or of any other seco^darie governor that has power
to bind his subgectes to a law. And when the law eternal or the will of god
is known to his creatures reasonable by the light of natural understanding /
or by the light of natural reason / then it is called the law of reason And
when it is showed by heavenly reuelacion in such manner as hereafter shall
appear / then it is called the law of god. And when it is showed unto him by
the order of a prince / or of any other secundarye gouernoure that has power
to set a law upon his subgectes / then it is called the law of man: though
originallie it be made of god / for laws made by man / that has received
thereto power of god be made by god. Therefore the said three laws: that is to
say / the law of reason / the law of god / and the law of man the which
have several names after the manner as they be showed to man / be called in god
one law eternal. And this is the law of whom it is written. Prouerbioru^
octauo / where it is said. Perme reges regnant et legu^ conditores iusta
descernu^t: that is to say by me kings reygne / and makers of laws descerne
the troth. And this suffices for this time of the law eternal.


Of the law of reason / the which by Doctoures / is called the law of nature
of reasonable creature The.ii. Chapitre.
DOctoure) First it is to be understand / that the law of nature may be
considered in two manners / that is to say generally and specially / when it is
considered generally / then it is referred to al creatures / as well reasonable as
unreasonable / for all unreasonable creatures live under a certain reule to them
given by nature / necessary for them to the conseruacion of their being / but
of this law it is not our intent to treat at this time. The law of nature
specially considered: which is also called the law of reason pertains only
to creatures reasonable that is man / which is create to the image of god. And
this law ought to be kept as well among Jews and gentels / as among christian
me^. And this law is always good and rightwyse styryng and enclynyng a man to
good / and abhorrynge evil: and as to the ordering of the deeds of man it is
preferred before the law of god. And it is written i^ the heart of every man
techynge him what is to be done and what is to be fled. And because it is
written in the heart / therefore it may not be put away / ne it is never
chau^geable by no dyuersitie of place ne time. And therefore against this law
prescripcio^ / statute / nor custom may not prevail / and if any be brought
in against it they be no prescripcions statutes nor customs / but things void
and against justice. And al other laws as well the laws of god as to the acts
of men as other be grounded thereupon.


Student) sith the law of reason is written in the heart of every man / as
thou haste said before techynge him what is to be done and what is to be fled
/ and the which thou sayste may never be put out of the heart / what neded it
than to have any other law brought in to order the acts and deeds of the
people.


Doctoure) though the law of reason may not be changed nor hollye put away:
nevertheless before the law written it was greatly let and blinded by evil
customs and by many sins of the people beside the original sin / in so
much that it might hardly be discerned what was rightwyse and what was
vnrightwyse / and what good and what evil / wherefore it was necessary for the
good order of the people to have many things added to the law of reason as well
by the Church: as by seculer princes according to the manners of the country
and of the people / where such additions should be excersised. And this law of
reason differs fro the law of god in two manners / for the law of god is
given by reuelacio^ of god / and this law is given by a natural light of
understanding. And also the law of god orders a man of it self by a nighe
way to the felicity that ever shall endure. And the law of reason ordered a
man to the felicity of this life.


Student) but what be tho things that the law of reason techeth to be done /
and what to be fled / I pray the show me.


Doctoure) the law of reason techeth that good is to be loved and evil is to
be fled. Also that thou shalt do to another that thou would another should
do to the. Also that we may do nothing against troth. Also that a man must
live peacefully with other. That justice is to be done to every man: and that
wrong is not to be done to any man. And also that a trespasser is worthy to be
punisshed and such other / of the which follow diverse other secundarie
commandments the which be as necessary conclusions deriuied of the first
/ as of that commandment that good is to be beloved it follows that a man
shall love his benefactour: for a benefactour in that he is a benefactour
includes in him a reason of goodness for else he ought not to be called a
benefactour / that is to say a good doer: but an evil doer. And so in that he
is a benefactour / he is to be beloved in all times / and in all places. And
this law also suffers many things to be done / as that it is lawful to put
away force with force. And that it is lawful for every man to defend him
self and his goods against an unlawful power. And this law renneth with
every man's law / and also with the law of god as to the deeds of man / and
must be always kept and observed / and shall always declare what ought to folo
upon the general rewles of the law of man / and shall restrayn the^ if they
be in any thing contrary unto it. And here it is to be understand / that
after some men / that law whereby all things were in common was never of the
law of reason / but only in the time of extreme necessity. For they say
that the law of reason may not be changed / but they say it is evident that
the law whereby all things should be in common is changed / wherefore they
conclude that it was never the law of reason.


Of the law of god. The.iii. Chapitre.
DOctoure) the law of god is a certain law given by reuelacion to reasonable
creature showing him the will of god / wyllyng that creature reasonable to be
bound to do a thing or not to do it for optaynynge of the felicity eternal.
And it is said (for the optaynyng of the felicity eternal) to exclude the
laws showed by reuelacion of god for the political rewle of the people the
which be called Judicials: for a law is not proprely called the law of god
because it was showed by reuelacion of god / but also because it directs a
man by the nerest way to the felicity ternall as be^ the laws of the old
Testament that be called Morals / and the law of the Eua^gelistes: the which
were showed in much more excellent manner: the^ the law of the old Testament
was: for that was showed by the mediacion of an Angel. But the law of the
Eua^gelistes was showed by the mediacion of our lord Jesus Christ god an man /
and the law of god is always rightwyse and just / for it is made and given
after the will of god. And therefore all acts and deeds of man be called
rightwyse and just when they be done according to the law of god and be
comfortable to it. Also sometime a law made by man: is called the law of god.
As when a law takes his principal ground upon the law of god / and is made
for the declaracion or co^seruacion of the faith / and to put away heresies /
as diverse laws Canno^s and also diverse laws made by the common people sometime
do. The which therefore are rather to be called the law of god / the^ the law
of man / yet nevertheless all the laws Ca^no^ be not the laws of god. For
many of them be made only for the political rewle and conversation of the
people whereupon John^ Gerson in the treatise of the spirituell life of the
soul the second Lesson / and the third cororally says thus. all the Ca^nons
of Popes nor their decres be not the law of god. For many of them be made
only for the political co^uersacio^ of the people. And if any man will say be
not all the goods of the Church spirituel For they belo^ge to the
spiritualitie and leed to the spiritueltie / we answer that in the hole
political co^uersacion of the people / there be some specially deputed and
dedicate to the service of god / the which most specially as by an
excellency are called spirituell me^ as religious me^ are. And other though
they walk in the way of god / yet nevertheless because their office is most
specially to be occupied about such things as pertayne to the common wealth /
and to the good order of the people / they be therefore called seculer men or
lay men / nevertheless the goods of the first may no more be called spirituell
/ the^ the goods of the other for they be things mere temporal and keeping
the body as they do in the other And by like reason laws made for the
political order of the Church be called many time spirituell / or the laws
of god Nevertheless it is but vnproprely: and other be called Civil or the
law of man. And in this point many be ofttymes deceived / and also deceive
other / the which Judge tho things to be spirituell / the which al me^ know
be things material and carnal. These be the words of John^ Gerson in the
place alleged before. Furthermore beside the law of reason and the law of man
it was necessary to have the law of god for four reasons. The first because
man is ordained to the end of eternal felicite the which excedeth the
proportion and faculty of man's power. Therefore it was necessary that beside
the law of reason and the law of man: he should be directed to his end by a
law made of god. Second for asmoche as for the vncerteinte of man's Judgment
specially of things particular and seldo^ falli^g It hapeneth often times to
follow diverse Iugementes of diverse men / and also diversities of laws / and
therefore to the intent that a man without any doubt may know what he should
do / and what he should not do. It was necessary that he should be directed in
all his deeds by a law heavenly given by god / the which is so apparante that
no man may swerve fro it as is the law of god. Thyrdly man may only make a
law of such things as he may Judge upon / and the Judgment of man may not be
of inward things / but only of outward things / and nevertheless it
belongs to perfeccion that a man be well ordered in both / that is to say /
as well inward as outward. Therefore it was necessary to have the law of god /
the which should order a man as well of inward things as of outward things.
The fourth is because as saint Augustyn says in the first book of fre
arbitrament / the law of man may not punisshe all offenses: for if all
offenses should be punisshed / the common wealth should be hurt as it is of
co^tractes for it can not be avoided / but that as long as contractes be
suffered many offenses shall follow thereby / and yet they be suffered for the
common welthe. And therefore that no evil should be unpunished / it was
necessary to have the law of god that should leave no evil unpunished.


Of the law of man The.iiii. Chapitre.
DOctoure) The law of man the which sometime is called the law positive is
deriuied by reason as a thing which is necessarily and probably following of
the law of reason / and of the law of god. And that is called probable that
appears to many and specially to wise men to be true. And therefore in every
law positive well made is somewhat of the law of reason / and of the law of
god: and to discern the law of god and the law of reason fro the law
positive is very hard / and though it be hard yet it is much necessary in
every moral doctrine / and in all laws made for the commonwealth. And that
the law of man be Just and rightwyse / two things be necessary / that is to
say / wisdom and auctorite. wisdom that he may Judge after reason / what is to
be done for the co^minaltie / and what is expedient for a peasible conversation
/ and necessary sustentacion of the^. Authority that he have authority to
make laws. For the law is named of Ligare: that is to say / to bind. But the
sentence of a wise man does not bind the co^minalte / if he have no rewle
over them. Also to every good law be required these propreties: that is to
say that it be honest / rightwyse / possible in it self / and after the
custom of the country / conueniente for the place and time / necessary /
profitable / and also manifest that it be not capcious by any dark sentence
ne myxte with any pryuate wealth / but all made for the common wealth. And after
saint Bryget in the fourth book in the.C. xxix. Chapitre / every good law is
ordained to the health of the soul and to the fulfillinge of the laws of god:
and to enduce the people to fly evil desires and to do good warkes. Also as
the cardinal of Camer writtet what so ever is rightwyse in the law of man is
rightwyse in the law of god / for every man's law must be co^sonant to the
law of god. And therefore the laws of princes / the commandments of prelates
/ the statutes of co^mynalties / ne yet the ordinance of the Church is not
rightwyse nor obligatorie / but it be co^sonant to the law of god. And of such
a law of man that is consonant to the law of god / it appears who has right
to lands and goods / and who not: for what so ever a man has by such laws
of man he has rightwyslye. And what so ever is had against such laws is
vnrightwyslie had For laws of man not contrary to the law of god / nor to the
law of reason must be observed in the law of the soul / and he that
dispiseth the^ dispiseth god and resists god. And furthermore as Gracian
says because evil men fere to offend for fere of pain. Therefore it was
necessary that diverse pains should be ordained for diverse offenses / as
Phisicions ordain diverse remedies for several disseases. And such pains be
ordained by the makers of laws after the necessity of the time / and after
the disposicio^ of the people. And though that law that ordeyneth such
pains has thereby a confermitie to the law of god: for that the law of god
commands that the people shall take away evil from among them self / yet
they belo^ge not so much to the law of god / but that other pains sta^dyng
the first pri^ciples might be ordained and appointed / and therefore that is
the law that is called most proprely the law positive and the law of man. And
the Philosopher said in the third book of his Etykes / that the intent of a
maker of a law is to make the people good and to bring them to virtue. And
though I have somewhat in a generality showed the whereupon the law of England
is grounded. For of necessity it must be grounded of the said laws / that
is to say of the law eternal / of the law of reason / and of the law of
god. Nevertheless I pray the show me more specially whereupon it is grounded
as thou thynkest / as thou before haste promised to do.


Student) I will with good will do therein that lies in me / for thou have
showed me a right plain and a strayte way thereto. Therefore thou shalt
understand that the law of England is grounded upon six pryncipall
grou^des. First it is grounded on the law of reason. Second on the law of
god. Thyrdly on diverse general customs of the realm. Fourthly of diverse
principles that be called maxymes. Fyftly on diverse particular customs Sixthly
on diverse statutes made in parliamentes by the king and by the common counsel
of the realm / of which grou^des I shall speak by order as they be reherced
before / and first of the law of reason.


Of the first ground of the law of England. The.v. Chapitre.
STudent) The first ground of the law of England is the law of reason /
whereof thou haste treated before in the second chapitre / the which is kept
in this realm as it is in all other realms and as of necessity it must needs
be as thou have said before.


Doctor) But I would know what is called the law of nature after the laws
of England.


Student) It is not used among them that be learned in the laws of England to
reason what thing is commanded or prohibet by the law of nature and what
not: but all the resonynge in that behalf is under these manner: as when any
thing is grounded upon the law of nature: they say that reason will that such
a thing be done / and if it be prohibit by the law of nature. They say it is
against reason or that reason will not suffer that it be done.


Doctoure) Then I pray the show me what they that be learned in the laws of
the realm hold to be commanded or prohibit by the law of nature under
such terms and after such manner as is used amongst the^ that be learned in
the said laws.


Student) There be put by them that be learned i^ the laws of England two
degrees of the law of reason / that is to say / the law of reason primarie /
and the law of reason secundarie by the law of reason primarie be prohibit
in the laws of England murder that is the death of him that is Innocent /
perjury / disceyte / brekynge of the peace and many other like. And by the
same law also it is lawful for a man to defend hi^ self agai^ste an unjust
power so he keep dew circumstaunce. And also if any promise be made by man as
to the body it is by the law of reason void in the laws of England. The
other is called the law of secu^darie reason / the which is divided in to two
branches / that is to say: in to the law of a secundarie reason general /
and in to a law of secundarie reason particular.

The law of a secundarie reason general is grounded and deriuied of that
general law or general custom of propretie whereby goods mouable and
immovable be brought in to a certain propretie / so that every man may know
his own thing. And by this brau^che be prohibited in the laws of England
disseasons / trespass in lands and goods rescues theft unlawful with
holding of another man's goods and such other. And by the same law it is a
ground in the laws of England that satisfaccion must be made for a
trespass / and that restitucio^ must be made of such goods as one man has
that belong to another man / that dettes must by paid: couenau^tes fulfulled
and such other. And because disseasons / trespass in lands and goods:
theft and such other had not ben known / if the law of propretie had not
ben ordained. Therefore all things that be diriuied by reason out of the said
law of propretie / be called the law of reason secundarie general / for that
law of propretie is generally kept in all our cou^tres. The law of reason
secundarie particular is that law that is deriuied upon diverse customs
general and particular and of diverse maxims and statutes ordained in this
realm. And it is called the law of reason secu^darie particular because that
reason i^ that case is deriuied of such a law that is only holden for law in
this realm / and in none other realm.


Addition.
Doctoure) I pray the show me some special case of such law of reason
secu^darie particular for an example.


Student) There is a law i^ England / which is a law of custom that if a man
take a distress lawfully that he shall put it in a pound ouerte there to
remain till he be satisfied of that he distrayned for. And then thereupon may
be asked this question that if the beasts dye in pound for lack of meat at
whose peril dye they / whether dye they at the peril of him that distreyned or
of him that owes the beasts.


Doctoure If the law be as thou sayste and than a man for a just cause takes
a distres and puts it in pound ouerte and no law compels him that
distreyneth to give the^ meat / then it seems of reason that if the distres
dye in pound for lack of meat / that it dyed at the peril of him that owes
the beasts and not of him that distrayned / for i^ him that distreyned there
can be assigned no defaute / but in the other may be assigned a defaute /
because the rent was unpaid.


Student) Thou haste given a true Judgment and who has taught the to do so /
but reason diriuied of the said general custom. And the law is so full of
such secu^darie reasons diriuied out of the general customs and maxims of
the realm that some men have affermed that all the law of the realm is the
law of reason: but that ca^ not be proved as me seems as I have partly showed
before and more fully will show after. And it is not much used in the laws
of England to reason what law is grounded upon the law of the first reason
primary / or of the law of reason secu^darie / for they be most commonly
openly known of them self / but for the knowledge of the law of reason
secu^darie is greater difficulty / and therefore therein depends much the
manner and form of arguments i^ the laws of England. And it is to be noted
that all the deriuie^ge of reason i^ the laws of England proceeds of the
first principles of the law or of some thing that is deriuied of the^. And
therefore no man may right wisely Judge ne grou^dly reason i^ the laws of
England if he be ygnoraut in the first principles. Also all birds / fowls /
wild beasts as beasts of forestes and warren and such other be excepted by
the laws of England out of the said general law and custom of propretie.
For by the laws of the realm no propretie may be of them in any person
oneles they be tame Nevertheless the eggs of Hawks / hero^s / or such other
as build in the ground of any person / be adiuged by the said laws to be
long to him that owes the ground.


Of the.ii. ground of the law of England. The.vi. Chapitre.
STudent) The second ground of the law of England is the law of god and
therefore for punisshement of them that offended against the law of god / it is
enquered in many courts in this realm / if any hold any opynions secretly
or in any other manner against the true catholicall faith. And also if any
general custom were directly against the law of god / or if any statute
were made directly against it / as if it were ordained that no alms should
be given for no necessity that custom and statute were void. Never thelesse
the statute made in the.xxiii. year of king Edward the.iii. whereby it is
ordained that no man under pain of Imprysoneme^t shall give any alms to any
valiant beggars that may well labor that they may so be compelled to labor
for their living is a good statute / for it observes the intent of the law of
god. And also by authority of this law there is a ground in the laws of
England / that he that is accursed shall maynteyne no accion in the kings
court / except it be in very few cases so that the same exco^municacion be
certified before the kings Justices in such manner as the law of the realm
has appointed. And by the authority also of this ground / the law of
England amitteth the spirituell Iurisdiccio^ of dysmes and offerynges. And of
all other things that of right belong unto it. And receives also all laws
of the Church dewly made and that excede not the power of them that made them.
In so much that in many cases it behooves the kings Justices to judge after
the laws of the Church.


Doctoure) How may that be that the kings Justices should judge in the kings
courts after the law of the Church / for it seems that the Church should
rather give judgment in such things as it may make laws of the^ the kings
Justices.


Stude^t) That may be done in many cases / whereof I shall for an example put
this case. If a writ of right of ward be brought of the body. etc. And the
tenant confessyng the tenor and the no^age of the Infa^t / says that the
Infa^t was married in his auncesters days. etc^. whereupon.xii. men besworne
which give this verdyt / that the Infa^te was married in the life of his
auncestour. And that the woman in the life of his auncestour sued a deuorce
whereupon sentence was given that they should be deuorced. And that the heir
appeled which hangs yet undiscussed prayenge the aid of the Justice to
know whether the Infant in this case shall be said married or not. In this case
if the law of the Church be that the said sentence of deuorce stands in
his strength and virtue until it be adnulled upon the said appele. Than the
Infant at the death of his auncestoure was unmarried because the first marriage
was adnulled by that deuorce. And if the law of the Church be that the
sentence of that deuorce stands not in effect till it be affermed upon the
said appele / then is the Infant yet married / so that the value of his
marriage ca^ not belo^ge unto the lord. And therefore in this case Judgment
condicionell shall be given. etc^. And in likewise the kings Justice in many
other cases shall Judge after the law of the Church like as the spirituell
Iuges must in many cases form their Judgment after the kings laws.


Doctoure) How may that be that the spirituel Iuges should judge after the king
laws. I pray the show me some certain case thereof.


Stude^t) Though it be somewhat a digressio^ fro our first purpose / yet I will
not with say thy desire / but will with good will put the a case or two thereof
/ that thou may the better perceive what I mean. If A. and B. have goods
jointly / and A. by his last will byqueteth his portion therein to C. and
makes the said B. his executour and dyed / and C. asks the execucion of
this will in the spirituell court. In this case the Iuges there be bound to
Judge that will to be void: because it is void by the laws of the realm And
in likewise if a man be outlawed / and aft by his will bequeteth certain goods
to John^ at style / and make his executours and dye the king seaseth the
goods and after gives the^ again to the executours / and after John^ at
style suyth a sitacion out of the spirituell court against the executours to
have execucion of the will / in this case the Iuges of the spirituell court
must judge the will to be void as the law of the realm is that it is. And yet
there is no such law of forfayture of goods by out lagarie in the spirituell
law.


Of the third ground of the law of England. The.vii. Chapitre.
STudent) The third ground of the law of England stands upon diverse
general customs of old time used through all the realm: which have been
accepted and approved by our soueraygne lord the king and his progenitors
and all their subgectes. And by cause the said customs be neither against the
law of god / nor the law of reason / and have been always taken to be good and
necessary for the common wealth of all the real me. Therefore they have optayned
the stre^ghte of a law / in so much that he that does against them does
against Justice. And these be the customs that proprely be called the common
law. And it shall always be determined by the Justices whether there be any
such general custom or not / and not by. xii. men. And of these general
customs and of certain principles that be called maxims which also take
effect by the old custom of the real me / as shall appear in the Chapitre
next following depends most part of the law of this realm. And therefore
our soueraygne lord the king at his coronacion among other things takes a
solemn oath / that he shall cause all the customs of his realm faithfully
to be observed.


Doctoure) I pray the show me some of these general customs.


Student) I will with good will / and first I shall show the how the custom
of the realm is the very ground of diverse courts in the realm / that is to
say of the Chau^cerie of the kyngea benche / of the common place: and the
Escheker / the which be courts of record because none may sit as Judge i^
those courts by by the kings letters pate^tes. And these courts have diverse
auctorites whereof it is not to treat at these time. Other courts there be also
only grounded by the custom of the realm: that be of much less auctorite
the^ the courts before reherced / as i^ every shyre within the realm there is
a court that is called the Cou^tye / and another that is called the Shyryftes
torn / and i^ every manner is a court that is called a court Baron. And to
every fair and market is incident a court that is called a court of Pypowdres.
And though in some statutes is made mention sometime of the said courts / yet
nevertheless of the first Institucion of the said courts: and that such
courts should be / there is no statute nor law written in the laws of
England. And so all the ground and begynni^g of the said courts depe^de
upon the custom of the realm the which custom is of so high authority that
the said courts ne their auctorities may not be altered / ne their names
changed without Parlyament.

Also by the old custom of the realm no man shall be taken i^prysoned
disseased nor otherwise destroyed / but he be put to answer by the law of the
land: and this custom is co^fermed by the statute of Magnacarta the.xxvi.
chapitre.

Also by the old custom of the realm all men great and small shall do and
receive Justice in the kings courts / and this custom is co^fermed by the
statute of Marl the.i. Chapitre.

Also by the old custom of the realm the eldest sone is only heir to his
auncestour / and if there be no sons but daughters then all the daughters
shall be heir: and so it is of susters and other kynneswomen. And if there be
another sone / daughter / brother / nor suster / then shall the enheritaunce
discende to the next kynnesman or kynneswoman of the hole blood to him that
had the enhitau^ce of how many degrees so ever they be from him. And if there
be no heir general nor special / then the land shall Eschete to the lord
of whom the land is holden.

Also by the old custom of the realm lands shall never ascend / nor
disce^de from the sone to the father or mother / nor to any other auncestre in
the right line / but it shall rather Eschete to the lord of the fee.

Also if any alye^ have a sone that is an alyen and after is made Denizyn / and
has another sone / and after purchases lands and dyed / the yo^ger sone
shall enherite as heyr and not the eldest.

Also if there be three brethren and the mydlest brother purchase lands and
dyed without heir of his body / the eldest brother shall inheryt as heir to
him: and not the younger brother.

Also if land in fee simple disce^de to a man by the perre of his father and
he dyed without heir of his body / then that inheritance shall discende to
the next heir of the part of his father. And if there be no such heir of
the part of his father / then if the father purchased the lands it shall go to
the next heir of the fathers mother / and not to the next heirs of the
sonesmother but it shall rather Eschete to the lord of the fee: but if a man
purchase lands to him and to his heirs and dye without heir of his body as
is said before / the^ that land shall disce^de to the next heir of the part
of his father if there be any / and if not then to the next heir of the part
of his mother.

Also if the sone purchases lands i^ fee and dye without heir of his body /
the land shall discende to his uncle and shall not asce^de to his father / but
if the father have a sone though it be many years after the death of the elder
brother / yet that sone shall put out his uncle and shall enjoy the land as
heir to his elder brother for ever.

Also by the custom of the realm the child that is borne before spouselles
is bastard and shall not inheryte.

Also the custom of the realm is that no manner of goods nor catalles real
nor parsonell shall never go the the heir / but to the executours / or to the
ordinary or administratours.

Also the husband shall have all the Chatelles parsonelles that his wife had
at the time of the spouselles or after: and also Chatelles real if he over live
hes wife but if he sell or give away the Chatelles realles and dye by that sale
or gift the enterest of the wife is determined / and else they shall remain to
the wife if she over live her husband.

Also the husband shall have all the inheritance of his wife whereof he was
seized in deed in the right of his wife during the spouselles in fee or in fee
tail general for term of life / if he have any child by her to hold as
tenant by the curtesye of England / and the wife shall have the third part
of the inheritance of her husband whereof he was seized in deed or in law
after the spouselles. etc. but in that case the wife at the death of her
husband must be of the age of.ix. year or about / or else she shall have no
dowrye.


Doctoure) what if the husband at his death be within the age of.ix. year.


Student) I suppose she shall yet have her dower.

Also the old law and custom of the realm is that after the death of every
tena^te that holds his lands by knights service the lord shall have the
ward and marriage of the heir till the heir come to the age of.xxi. year. And
if the heir in that case be of full age at the death of his auncestre / then he
shall pay to his lord his relyefe / which at the common law was not
certain / but by the statute of Magna carta / it is put in certain: that is
to say for every hole knights fee to pay. C.s^. And for a hole baronye to pay
a.C. mark for relyef. And for a hole erledom to pay a.C. li. and after the
rate. And if the heir of such a tenant be a woman / and she at the death of
her auncestre be within the age of.xiiii. years / then by the common law she
should have been inward only till.xiiii. year / but by the statute of Westminster
the first in such case she shall be inward till.xvi. year. And if at the death
of the auncestre she be of the age of.xiiii. year or above / she shall be out of
ward / though the lands be holden of the king. And the^ she shall pay relyef
as an heir male shall.

Also of lands holden in socage if the auncestre dye / his heir being within
the age of.xiiii. years / the next fre^d of the heyt to whom the inheritance
may not discende shall have the ward of his body and lands till he shall come
to the age of.xiiii. year / and the^ he may enter. And when the heir comes
to the age of.xxi. year / the^ the gardeyn shall yield him acco^pte for the
profettes thereof by him received.

Also such an heir in socage for his relyefe shall double his rent to the
lord the year following the death of his auncestre / as if his au^cestre held
by.xii. d. rent the heir in the year following shall pay that.xii. d. for
his re^t / and other.xii. d for his relyef. And that relyefe he must pay
though he be within age at the death of his auncestre.

Also there is an old law and custom in this realm that a freholde by way of
feffement gift or lease passes not without lyuery of season be made upon the
land according though a deed of feffeme^t be thereof made and delivered: but by
way of surrendre particion and eschau^ge a freholde may pass without livery.

Also if a man make a will of land whereof his is seized i^ his demesne as of
fee / that will is void / but if it had stand in feffes hands it had been
good. And also in London such a will is good by the custom of the city if it
be inrowled.

Also a lease for term of years is but a chatel in the law / and therefore it
may pass without any livery of season / but otherwise it is of a state for
term of life for that is a freholde in the law / and therefore lyuerey must be
made thereof or else the freholde passes not.

Also by the old custom of the realm a man may distreyne for a rent service
of common right. And also for a rent reserved upon a gift in tail / a lease
term of life / of years and at will / and in such case the lord may
distreyne the tenauntes of beestes as soon as they come upon the ground / but
the beasts of strangers that come i^ but by manner of an escape / he may not
distreyne till they have be^ leua^t and coucha^t upon the ground: but for
debt upon an obligacio^ nor upon a contracte / nor for account ne yet for
arerages of acco^pte / nor for no manner of trespass / reparacions / nor such
other no man may distreyne.

Also by the old law and custom of the realm all yssues that shall be joined
betwixt party and party in any court of record within the realm except a
few whereof it needs not to treat at these time / must be tried by.xii. fre
and lawful me^ of the visne that be not of affinity to none of the parties.
And in other courts that be not of record / as in the countye / court baron /
hundred and such other like / they shall be tried by the other of the protyes
and not other wise oneles the parties assente that it shall be tried by the
homage. And it is to be noted that lords / Barons / and all pyers of the
realm be excepted out of such trialles if they will / but if they will
wylfully be sworn therein / some say it is no error And they may if they will
have a writ out of the Chauncerie directed to the Shyryfe co^maundynge him
that he shall not impanell them upon no enqueste.

And of this that is saydbefore it appears that the customs aforesaid nor
other like unto the^ / whereof be very many in the laws of England can not be
proved to have the strenght of a law only by reason for how may it be proved
by reason that the eldest sone shall only enherite his father and the yo^ger
to have no part / or that the husband shall have the hole land for term of
his life as tenant by the courtesye in such manner as before appears. And
that the wife shall have only the third part in the name of her dower / and
that the husband shall have all the goods of his wife as his own. And that
if he dye living the wife / that his executours shall have the goods / and
not the wife. All these and such other can not be proved only by reason that
it should be so and no otherwise all though they be reasonable / and that with
the custom theri^ used suffiseth in the law And a statute made against such
general customs ought to be observed because they be not merely the law of
reason.

Also the law of propretie is not the law of reason / but a law of custom how
be it that it is kept / and is also right necessary to be kept in all realms
and among all people And so it may be no^bred among the general customs of
the realm. And it is to understand that there is no statute that treats of
the beginning of the said customs: ne why they should beholden for law. And
therefore after the^ that be learned in the laws of the realm: the old custom
of the realm is the only and sufficient authority to them in that behalf.
And I pray the show me what doctors hold therein / that is to say whether a
custom only be sufficient authority of any law.


Doctoure) doctors hold that a law grounded upon a custom is the most
surest law / but this must always understand therewith that such a custom is
another contrary to the law of reason / nor to the law of god. And now I pray
the show me somewhat of the maxymes of the law of England whereof thou haste
made mencio^ before in the.iiii. chapitre.


Stude^t) I will with good will.


Of the.iiii. ground of the law of England. The.viii. Chapitre.
STudent) The.iiii. ground of the law of England stands in diverse
principles that be called in the law maxims / the which have been always taken
for law i^ this realm / fo that it is not lawful for none that is learned to
deny them / for every one of those maxims is sufficient authority to him
self. And which is a maxim / and which not shall always be determined by the
Iuges / and not by.xii. men And it needs not to assign any reason / why they
were first received for maxims for it suffiseth that they be not against the
law of reason nor the law of god / and that they have always be taken for law.
And such maxims be not only holden for law / but also other cases like unto
the^ and all things that necessarily follows upon the same / ar to be reduced
to like law And therefore most co^me^ly there be assigned some reasons or
co^sideracion why such maxims be reasonable to the intent that other cases
like may the more conveniently be applied to them. And they be of the same
strength and effect in the law as statutes be. And though the general custom
of the realm be the strength and warraunte of the said maxims: as they be of
the general customs of the realm / yet because the said general customs be
in manner known through the realm as well to them that be unlearned as learned
/ and may lightly be had and known and that with little study. And the said
maxims be only known in the kings courts or among them that take great
study in the law of the realm / and among few other persons. Therefore
they be set in this writtynge for several grounds and he that lysteth may so
account them / or if he will he may take the^ for one ground after his
pleasure / of which maxims I shall hereafter show the part.

First there is a maxim that escuage uncertain makes knights service.

Also there is another maxim that escuage certain makes socage.

Also that he that holds by castelgarde / holds by knights service / but
he holds not by escuage. And that he that holds by.xx. s. to the guard of a
castle holds by socage.

Also there is a maxim that a disce^t takes away an enter.

Also that no prescripcion in lands makes a right.

Also that a prescripcion of rent and of profits aprendre out of land makes
a right.

Also that the limitacio^ of a perscripcio^ generally taken is from the time
that no man's mind renuyth to the contrary.

Also that assigns may be made upon lands given in fee for term of life / or
for tme of years though no me^cio^ be made of assigns / and the same law is
of a rent that is granted / but otherwise it is of a wara^tie and of a
couenaunte.

Also that a condition to avoid a freholde can not be pleaded without deed /
but to avoid a gift of a chatel it may be pleaded without deed.

Also that a release or a confirmacion made by him that at the time of the
release or co^firmacion made had no right is void in the law / though a
right come to him after / except it be with warrau^tye / and the^ it shall
bar him of all right that he shall have after the warrau^tye made.

Also that a right or title of accio^ that only depends in accion can not be
given nor granted to none other but only to the tenant of the ground / or
to him that has the reuercion or remayndre of the same land.

Also that in an accion of debt upon a contracte the def. may wage his law /
but otherwise it is upon a lease of lands for term of years or at will.

Also that if an exigent in case of felonye be awarded against a man: he has
thereby forthwith forfeted his goods to the king.

Also if the sone be attai^ted in the life of the father / and after he
purchases his Chartour of pardon of the king / and after the father dyed. In
this case the land shall Eschete to the lord of the fee in so much that that
though he have a yo^gerbrother yet the land shall not discende to him / for by
the atteyndre of the elder brother the blood is corrupt and the father in the
law dyed without heir.

Also if an Abbot or a Priour alyene the lands of his house and dyed / in that
case though his successor have right to the land / yet he may not enter: but
he must take his accio^ that is appointed hi^ by the law.

Also there is a maxim i^ the law that if a villayne purchase lands and the
lord enter / he shall enjoy the land as his own / but if the villayne alyene
before the lord enter / that alienacion is good. And the same law is of goods.

Also if a man stele goods to the value of.xii. d. or above it is felonye /
and he shall dye for it. And if it be under the value of.xii. d. then it is but
petite larcinie and he shall not dye for it / but shall be otherwise punysshed
after the discrecio^ of the Iuges except it be taken fro the person / for if a
man take any thing how little so ever it be / from a man's person felonously
/ it is called roberye and he shall dye for it.

Also he that is areyned upon an Inditeme^t of felony shall be admitted i^
favor of life to challenge.xxxv. jurors pere^torily but if he challenge any
above that nombre / the law takes hi^ as one that has refused the law because
he has refused three hole enquestes / and therefore he shall dye: but with cause
he may challenge as many as he has cause of challenge to. And further it is to
be understand that such peremtorie challenge shall not be admitted in appeal
because it is at the suyt of the party.

Also the land of every man is in the law enclosed from other though it lie i^
the open field. And therefore if a man do a trespass theri^ the writ shall be quare
clausu^ fregit.

Also that re^tes / commons of pasture of turbary reuercio^s remayndres / nor
such other things which lie not in manuell occupacio^ may not be given nor
granted to none other without writtynge.

Also that he that recouereth debt or damages in the kings court by such an
accio^ within a Capias lay in to the process may within a year after the
recovery have a Capias ad satisfaciendu^ to take the body of the defendau^t
and to commit hi^ to prison till he have paid the debt and damages but if
there lay no Capias i^ the first accio^ the^ the pleyntyfe shall have no Capias
ad satisfacie^du^ / but must take a Fierifacias or an Elegit within the year:
or a Scire fac^ aft the year or within the year if he will.

Also if a release or confirmacio^ be made to him: that at the time of the
release made had no thing in the land. etc^. the release or co^firmacio^ is
void except certai^ cases as to vouchye and certain other which need not
here to be remembered.

Also there is a maxim in the law of England that the king may dissease no
man / ne that no man may dissease the king ne pull any reuercyon or remayndre
out of him.

Also the kings excellency is so high in the law that no freholde may be
given to the king ne be deriuied from him / but by matter of record.

Also there was sometime a maxim and a law in England that no man should have
a writ of right: but by special suyt to the king. And for a fine to be made
in the Chau^cerie for it / but these maxims be changed by the statute of
Magna carta the.xvi. Chapi. where it is said thus Nulli negabimus nulli
vendemus rectum vel iusticiam. And by the words nulli negabimus / a man shall
have a writ of right of course in the Chau^cerie without suynge to the king
for it. And by the words nulli vendemus. He shall have it without fine and so
many times the old maxims of the law be changed by statutes.

Also though it be reasonable that for the many sold diversities of accions
that be in the laws of England / that there should be diversities of process
as in the reale accions after one manner / and in personal accions after
another manner: yet it can not be proved merely by reason that the same process
ought to be had and none other / for by statute it might be altered.

And so the ground of the said process is to be referred only to the
maxims and customs of the realms. And I have showed the these maxims before
reherced / not to the intent to show the specially what is the cause of the law
in the^ / for that would ask a great respite / but I have showed them only to
the intent that thou may perceive that the said maxims and other like may
conveniently be set for one of the grounds of the laws of England /
moreover there be diverse cases / whereof I am in doubt whether they be only
maxims of the law or that they be grounded upon the law of reason / wherein I
pray the let me here thyn opinion.


Doctoure) I pray the show those cases that thou meanest: and I shall make the
answer therein as I shall se cause.


Hereafter follows diverse cases wherein the Student douteth whether they be
only maxims of the law or that they be grounded upon the law of reason.
The.ix. Chapitre.
STude^t) The law of England is that if a man command another to do a
trespass and he does it / that the co^mau^dour is a trespasser. And I am in
doubt whether that be only by a maxim of the law / or that it be by the law
of reason.

Also I am in doubt upon what law it is grounded that the Accessory shall not
be put to answer before the principal. and.c^.

Also the law is that if an Abbot bye a thing that comes to the use of the
house and dyed that his successors shall be charge / and I am somewhat in doubt
upon what ground that law depends.

Also that he that has possession of land though it be by disseason has
right against all men / but against him that has right.

Also that if an accion real be sued against any man that has nothing i^ the
thing demanded he writ shall abate as at the common law.

Also that the alienacio^ of the tenant hanging the writ nor his enter in to
religion / or if he be made a knight / or if she be a woman and take an
husband hangyng the writ / that the writ shall not abate.

Also if land and rent that is going out of the same land come in to one
man's hand of like estate and like suertye of title / the rent is extincte.

Also if land discende to hi^ that has right to the same land before / he
shall be remitted to his better title if he will.

Also if two tytles be concurra^t together / the eldest title shall be preferred.

Also that every man is bound to make recompense for such hurt as his
beasts shall do in the corn or grass of his neighbor though he know not
that they were there.

Also if the drmaundau^t or playntyfe hanging his writ will enter in to the
thing demanded this writ shall abate. And it is many times very hard and
of great difficulty to know what cases of the law of England be grounded
upon the law of reason / and what upon custom of the realm / and though it
be hard to discuss it: yet is very necessary to be known for the knowele of
the parfyte reason of the law / and if any man think that these cases before
reherced be grounded upon the law of reason / then he may refer them to the
first ground of the law of England which is the law of reason / whereof is
made mention in the.v. Chepi. And if any man think that they be grounded upon
the law of custom / then he may refer them to the maxims of the law /
which be assigned for the third ground of the law of England / whereof
mention is made in the.viii. Chapitre. as before appears.


Doctoure) But I pray the show me by what authority is it proved in the
laws of England that the cases that thou haste put before in the.viii.
Chapitre / and such other which thou call maxims ought not to be denied
/ but ought to be taken as maxims / for sithe they can not be proved by reason
as thou agreest thy self they can not / they may as lightly be denied as
affermed onles there be some sufficient authority to approve the^.


Student) Many of the customs and maxims of the laws of England be known
by the use and the custom of the realm so apparently that it needs not to
have any law written thereof / for what needs it to have any law written that
the eldest sone shall enherite his father / or that all the daughters shall
enherite together as one heir / if there be no sone / or that the husband
shall have the goods and chatels of his wife that she has at the time of the
spouselles or after / or that a bastard shall not enheryte as heir / or that
executours shall have the disposicion of all the goods of their testatoure:
and if there be no executours that the ordinary shall have it / and that the
heir shall not meddled with the goods of his auncestre: but any particular
custom help him. The other maxims and customs of the law that be not so
openly known among the people may be known partly by the law of reason:
and partly by the books of the laws of England called years of terms / and
partly by diverse records remaining in the kings courts and in his tresorie.
And specially by a book that is called the regestre / and also by diverse
statutes wherein many of the said customs / and maxims be often resited / as
to a dilligent sercher will evidently appear.


Of the.v. ground of the law of England. The.x. Chapitre.
STudent) The.v. ground of the law of England stands in diverse particular
customs used in diverse countres towns / cities / and lordshyppes in this
realm / the which particular custom because they be not against the law of
reason / nor the law of god / though they be against the said general
customs or maxims of the law: yet nevertheless they stand in effect and be
taken for law / but if it rise i^ question in the kings courts whether there
be any such particular custom or not it shall be tried by.xii. men / and not by
the Iuges / except the same particular custom be of record in the same
court. Of which particular customs / I have hereafter noted some for an
example.

First there is a custom in Ke^t that is called Bauelkynde / that all the
brethren shall enherit together as systers at the common law.

Also there is another particular custom / that is called burghe^glisshe where
the yo^ger sone shall enheryte before the eldest and that custom is in
Notynghame.

Also there is a custom in the city of London that fre me^ there / may by
their testament inrouled byqueth their lands that they be seized of to whom
they will / except to mortmayn. And if they be cytizie^s and fre men / then
they may also byqueth lands to mortmayne.

Also in gauelkynde though the father be hanged the sone shall enheryt / for
their custom is the father to the bough / the son to the ploughe.

Also in some countres the wife shall have the half of the husbands lands in
the name of her dowrye as long as she lives sole.

Also in some country the husband shall have the half of the enheritau^ce of
hes wife / though he have no issue by her.

Also in some country an Infant when he is of the age of.xv. year may make a
feoffement / and the feoffement good. And in some country when he can mete an
elle or clothe


Of the.vi. ground of the law of England. The.xi. Chapitre.
STudent) The.vi. ground of the law of England stands in diverse statutes
made by our soueraygne lord the king and his progenitors / and by the lords
spiritual and temporal / and the commons in diverse parlyamentes in such cases
where the law of reason / the law of god / customs / maxims / ne other
grou^des of the law seemed not to be sufficient to punysshe evil me^ / and to
reward good me^. And I remember not that I have seen any other grou^des of the
law of England / but only these that I have before remembered. Furthermore it
appears of that I have said before that often times two or three grou^des of the
law of England must be joined together / or that the playntyfe ca^ open and
declare his right / as it may appear by these example. If a man enter in to
another man's land by force: and after makes a feffeme^t for mai^tenau^ce to
defraunde the pleyntyfe from his accion. In this case it appears that the said
unlawful enter is prohibit by the law of reason / but the playntyfe shall
recover treble damages / that is by reason of the statute made in the.viii.
year of king Henry the.vi. the: ix. Cha. And that the damages shall be seized.
by.xii. men that is by the custom of the realm. And so in this case.iii.
grou^des of the law of England mayntene the playntyfes accion. And so it is in
diverse other cases that need not to be remembered now. and thus I make an end
for this time / to speak any ferther of the grounds of the law of England.


Doctoure) I thank the for the great pain that thou haste taken therein /
nevertheless for as much as it appears that thou haste said before that the
learned men of the law of England pretend / to veryfie that the law of
England will nothing do / ne attempt against the law of reason / nor the law
of god / I pray the a^swere me to some questions grounded upon the law of
England how as the thinks the law may stand with reason or conscience in
the^.


Stude^t) Put the case and I shall make answer theri^ as well as I can.


The first question of the Doctoure of the law of England and conscience.
The.xii. Chapitre.
DOctoure) I have hard say / that if a man that is bound in an obligacio^
pay the money: but he takes no acquitaunce or if he take one and it happens
hi^ to lose it / that in that case he shall be compelled by the laws of
England to pay the money again / and how may it be said then / that that
law stands with reason or conscience / for as it is grounded upon the law of
reason that dettes ought of right to be paid / so it is grounded upon the law
of reason (as me seems) that when they be paid that he that paid them should
be discharged.


Student) First thou must understand that it is not the law of England /
that if a man that is bound in an obligacion pay the money without acquitaunce
/ or if he take acquitau^ce and lose it: that therefore the law determines that
he ought of right to pay the money eftesones / for that law were both
against reason and conscience / but trougth it is that there is a general
maxim in the law of England / that in an accion of debt sued upon an
obligacion / the defendaunt shall not plede that he owes not the money / ne
can in no wise discarge hi^slefe in that accion / but he have acquitaunce or
some other writtynge sufficient in the law or some other thing like /
witnessynge that he has paid the money / and that is ordained by the law to
avoid a great inconvenience that else might happen to come to many people that
is to say that every man by a nude paroll and by a bare auerment should avoid
an oblygacyon / wherefore to avoid that inconvenience the law has ordained
that as the defendau^t is charged by a sufficient writting / that so he must be
discharged by sufficient writtynge / or by some other thing of as high
auctoritye as the obligacion is. And though it may follow thereupon that in some
particular case a man by occasion of that general maxim may be compelled to
pay the money again that he paid before / yet nevertheless no defaute can be
therefore assigned in the law. For like as makers of laws take heed to such
things as may often fall / and do most hurt among the people rather the^ to
particular cases. So in likewise the general grounds of the law of England
/ head more what is good for many / then what is good for one singular person
only. And because it should be a hurt to many / if an obligacion should be so
lightly avoided by word.

Therefore the law specially preue^teth that hurt under such manner as before
appears. And yet intends not / nor commands not that the money of right
ought to be paid again / but sets a general rule / which is good and
necessary to all the people / and that every man may well keep / without it be
through his own defaute / and if such defaut happen in any person / whereby
he is without remedy at the common law: yet he may be helped by a Subpena /
and so he may in many other cases where conscience serves for him / that were
to long to reherce now.


Doctor) But I pray the show me under what manner a man may beholpen by
conscience. And whether he shall be helped in the same court or in an other.


Student) Because it can not be well declared where a man shall be helped by
conscience and where not / but it be first known what conscience is therefore
because it perteyneth to the most proprelye / to treat of the nature and
quality of conscience / therefore I pray the that thou will make me some
brief declaracion of the nature and quality of conscience and then I shall
answer to thy question as well as I ca^.


Doctor) I will with good will do as thou sayste / and to the intent that thou
may the better understand that I shall say of conscience / I shall first
show the what sinderesis is / and then what reason is / and then what
conscience is. And how these three differ among them self I shall somewhat
touch.


What sinderesis is. The.xiii. Chapitre
DOctoure) Sinderesis is a natural power of the soul set i^ the highest part
thereof / mouynge and sterrynge it to good / and abhorrynge evil. And therefore
Sinderesis never sins nor erreth. And this Sinderesis our lord put in man
to the intent that the order of things should be observed. For after saint
Deonise the wisdom of god joins the beginning of the second things to the
last of the first things / for Angel is of a nature to understand without
searching of reason: and to that nature man is joined by Sinderesis / the
which Sinderesis may not hollye be extincted nether in man ne yet in dampened
souls. But nevertheless as to the use and exersise thereof / it may be let for
a time either through the darkness of ignorance / or for indiscreet
delectacio^ or for the hardness of obstinacy. First by the darkness of
ygnoraunce Sinderesis may be let that it shall not murmr against evil /
because he believes evil to be good / as it is in heretykes / the which when
they dye for the wickydnes of their Error believe that they dye for the very
truth of the faith. And by indiscreet delectacion / Sinderesis is sometime so
over laid that remorce or grudge of conscience for the time can have no place.
For the hardness of obstinacy sinderesis is also let that it may not stir to
goodness as it is in dampened souls that be so obstinate in evil / that they
may never be inclined to good. And though sinderesis may be said to that point
extincte in dampened souls: yet it may not be said that it is fully extincte to
all intentes. For they always murmr against the evil of the pain that they
suffer for sin. And so it may not be said that it is universally / and to
all intentes / and to all times extincte / and this sinderisis is the
begynnnynge of all things that may be learned by speculacion or study / and
mynystreth the general grounds and pri^ciples thereof. And also of all things
that are to be done by man / an example of such things as many be learned by
speculacio^ appears thus: sinderesis says that every hole thing is more then
any one part of the same thing / and that is a sure ground that never
fails. And an example of things that are to be done / or not to be done: is
where sinderesis says: no evil is to be done: but that goodness is to be done
and followed / and evil to be fled and such other. And therefore sinderesis
is called by some men the law of reason / for it mynistreth the prynciples of
the law of reason / the which be in every man by nature in that he is a
reasonable creature.


Of reason. The.xiiii. Chapitre.
Doctoure) when the first man Ada^ was create / he received of god a double
eye / that is to say. An outward eye / whereby he might se visible thiges / and
know his bodily enemies and eschew them. And an inward eye / that is the eye
of the reason / whereby he might se his spirituel enemies that fights against
his soul and beware of them. And among all gifts that god gave to man / this
gift of reasan is the most noblest / for thereby man precelleth all beestes /
and is made like to the dignity of Aungelles / discernynge troth from
falsshede / and evil from good. Wherefore he gothe far from that effect that
he was made to when he takes not head to the troth: or when he prefers
evil before good. And therefore after Doctoures reason is that power of the
soul / that discerueth between good and evil / and between good and better
co^pari^g the one to the other: the which also shows vtues / loves god / and
flees vices. And reason is called ryghtwyse and good for it is conformable to
the will of god and that is the first thing and the first rewle that all
things must be rueled by / and reason that is not rightwyse nor strayte: but
that is said culpable is either because she is deceived with an error that
might be overcome / or else through her pride or slouthfulnes she enquereth not
for knowelege of the troth that ought to be enquered Also reason is divided in
two parties that is to say in to the higher part / and in to the lower part.
The higher part hedeth heavenly things and eternal / and reasons by heavenly
laws / or by heavenly resons what is to be done / and what is not to be done /
and what things god commands / and what he prohibiteth.

And this higher part of reason has no regard to transitory things / or
temporal things: but that sometime as it were by manner of council she
brings forth heavenly reasons / to order well temporal things. The lower
part of reason works most to govern well temporal things. And she
grounded her reasons much upon laws of man / and upon reason of man / whereby
she concludes that that is to be done / that is honest and expedient to the
commonwealth / or not to be done for it is not expedient to the common wealth.
And so that reason whereby I know god and such things as perteyne to god /
belongs to the hygheste part of reason. And that reason whereby I know
creatures belongs to the lower perte of reason. And though these two parts /
that is to say / the higher perte and the lower part be won i^ deed and
essence / yet they differ by reason of their working and of their office as it
is of one self eye: that sometime looks upward / and sometime downewarde.


Of conscience. The.xv. Chapitre.
DOctoure) This word conscience / which in latin is called Co^scie^cia is
compowned of this preposicion: cum / that is to say in english: with / and
with this nowne scientia / that is to say in english knowledge / and so
conscience is as much to say as knowelege of one thing with another thing /
and conscience so taken in nothing else / but an applienge of any science or
knowledge to some particular act of man. And so conscience may sometime err and
sometime not err. And of conscience thus taken doctors make many discripcions:
whereof one doctoure says / that conscience is the law of our understanding.
Another that conscience is an habit of the mind discernyng betwixt good and
evil. Another that conscience is the judgment of reason / iugynge on the
particular acts of man / all which sayenges agree in one effect / that is to
say that conscience is an actuell applyeng of any co^nyng or knowledge to such
things as be done: whereupon it follows that upon the most parfite knowledge
of any law or cunnyng. And of the most parfite and most true applyenge of the
same / to any particular act of man / follows the most profit / the most
pure / and the most best conscience. And if therebe defaute in knowing of the
truth of such a law / or in the applyenge of the same to any particular
act / than thereupon follows an error or defaute in conscience / as it may
appear by this example. Sinderesis ministeryth a universal principle yt never
erreth / that is to say / that an unlawful thing is not to be done. And than
it might be taken by some man that every oath is unlawful / because our lord
says Matthew. v. Ye shall in no wise swear. And yet he that by reason of the
said words will hold that it is no lawful in no case to swear / erreth in
conscience / for he has not the profit knowledge and understanding of the
troth of the said gospel / nor he reduces not yt saying of scripture / to
other scriptures / in which it is granted that i^ some case an oath may be
lawful: and the cause why conscience may so err in the said case and in
other like / is because conscience is formed of a certain particular
proposicion or question grounded upon vntuersal rewles ordained for such
things as are to be done. And because a particular proposicion is not known
of himself / but must appear and beserched by a dilligent search of reason /
therefore in that search and in the conscience that should be formed thereupon
may happen to be error / and thereupon it is said that there is error in
conscience / which error comes either because he does not assente to that
he ought to assent unto / or else because his reason whereby he does refer one
thing to another is disceyued. For further declaracion whereof it is to
understand that error in conscience comes.vii. manner of ways. First is
through ignorance: and that is when a man knows not what he ought to do /
and what he ought not to do: and than he ought to ask conceyll of them that he
thinks most expert in that science whereupon his doubt ryseth. And if he can
have no conceyll / tha^ he must holly commit him to god: and he of his goodness
will so order him / that he will save him from offense. The second is through
necligence / as when a man is necligent to search his own conscience / or to
enquere the truth of other. The third is through pride / as when he will
not mekyn him self ne believe them that be better and wyser than he is.

The fourth is through singularity as when a man follows his own wit / and
will not conferme him self to other / nor follow the good common ways of good
men. The fyfth is through an in ordinat affeccion to him self / whereby he
makes co^sciensce to follow his desire / and so he causes her to go out of
her right course. The sixte is through pusillaminite whereby some person
dredeth often times such things as of reason he ought not to dread. The seuynth
is through perplexity / and that is when a man believes him self to be so
set betwyxte two sins yt he thinks it impossible / but that he shall fall
in to the one but a man can never be so proplexed i^ deed but through an Erour
in conscience: and if hy will put away that error he shall be delivered.
Therefore I pray the that thou will always have a good conscience and if thou
have so / thou shall always be merry / and if thine own heart reprove the not
thou shalt always have inward peace. The gladness of rightewyse men is of god
and in god / and their joy is always in troth and goodness. There be many
diversities of conscience / but there is none better then that / whereby a man
truly knows him self. Many men know many great and high co^nynge things:
and yet know not them self and truly he that knows not him self knows no
thing well. Also he has a good and a clean conscience / that has purity and
clennes in his heart / troth in his word / and rightwysenes in his deed. And
as a light is set in a lantern that all that is in the house may ben seen
thereby: so almighty god has set conscience in the mids of every reasonable
soul as a light whereby he may discern and know what he ought to do / and what
he ought not to do. Therefore for as much as it behooves the to be occupied in
such things as perteyne to the law. It is necessary that thou ever hold a
pure and a clean conscience / specially in such things as concern
restitucion: for the syn^e is not forgyuen / but the thing that is wrongfully
taken be restored. And I conceyll the also that thou love that is good / and
fly that is evil / and that thou do to another as thou would should be done
to the: and that thou do no thing to other that thou would not should be
done to the. That thou do no thing against troth / that thou live peasablye
with thy neighbor / and that thou do justice to every man as much as in the
is. And also that in every general rule of the law / thou do observe and keep
equite: and if thou do thus I trust the light of thy lantern / that is thy
conscience shall never be extyneted.


Stud. But I pray the show me what is that equity that thou haste spoken of
before / and that thou would that I should keep.


Doctor) I will with good will show the somewhat thereof.


What is Equytie. The.xvi. Cha.
Doctoure. Equytie is a ryghtwystnes that considers all the particular
circumstances of the deed / the which also is tempered with the swetnes of
mercy. And such an equytie must always be observed in every law of man / and
in every general rule thereof / and that knew he well that said thus. Laws
covet to be rewled by equytie. And the wise man says. Be not over much
ryghtwyse: for the extreme ryghtwysenes is extreme wrong / as who says: if
thou take all that the words of the law gives the / thou shalt sometime do
against the law. And for the playner declaracion what equytie is thou shalt
understand that sith the deeds and acts of men / for which laws ben
ordained happen in diverse manners infinitlye. It is not possible to make any
general rule of the law / but that it shall fail in some case. And therefore
makers of laws take heed to such things as may often come and not to every
particular case / for they could not though they would. And therefore to follow
the words of the law / were in some case both against Justice and the common
wealth: wherefore in some cases it is necessary to leave the words of the law /
and to follow that reason and Justice requires / and to that intent equytie is
ordained: that is to say to tempre and mittigate the rygour of the law. And it
is called also by some men Epicata / the which is no other thing but an
excepcion of the law of god / or of the law of reason from the general rules
of ye law of man: when they by reason of their generalytie would in any
particular case judge against the law of god / or the law of reason / the
which excepcion is secretly understand in every general rule of every
positive law. And so it appears that equity takes not away the very right /
but only that / that seems to be right by the general words of the law: nor
it is not ordained against the cruelnes of the law / for the law in such
case generally taken is good in him self / but equytie follows the law in
all particular cases where right and Justice requires / not withstanding that
a general rule of the law be to the contrary: wherefore it appears yt if any
law were made by man without any such excepcion expressed or employed it were
manifestly unreasonable and were not to be suffered / for such cases might come
that he that would observe that law should break both the law of god and the
law of reason. As if a man make a vow that he will never eat white meat /
and after it happens him to come there where he can get none other meat.
In this case it behouyth him to break his auowe / for that particular case is
excepted secretly from his general auowe by this equytie or epykay / as it
is said before. Also if a law were made in a city that no man under the pain
of death should open the gates of the city before the son rysynge: yet if the
cytezens before that hour fleing from their enemies come to the gates of
the city / and one for saving of the cytyzens opens the gates before the
hour appointed by the law / yet he offe^deth not the law / for that case is
excepted from the said general law by equytie / as is said before: and so it
appears that equytie rather follows the intent of the law / then the words
of the law. And I suppose that there be in likewise some like equyties
grounded upon the general rules of the law of the realm.


Stud) ye yearly whereof one is this. There is a general prohybicion in the
laws of England: that it shall not be lawful to no man to enter i^ to the
freholde of another with out authority of the owner or of the law: but yet it
is excepted from the said prohybicion by the law of reason: that if a man
drive beasts by the high way and the beasts haphen to escape in to the
corn of his neighbor. And he to bring out his beasts that they should do
no hurt gothe in to the ground and fetteth out the beasts: there he shall
iustifye that enter in to the ground by the law. Also not withstandyng the
statute of Edward the third made the. 23. year of his reygne / whereby it is
ordained that no man upon pain of imprisonement should give any alms to any
valiant beggar / that is well able to labor: yet if a man mete with such a
valiant beggar in so cold a wether and so light apparel / that if he have no
clothes he shall i^ at be able to come to any town to have succoure / but is
lykely rather to dye by the way: and he therefore gives him apparel to save
his life he shall be excused of the said statute by such an excepcion of the
law of reason as I have spoken of.


Doc. I know well that as thou say he shall be exceptyd of the said statute
by conscience / and over that / that he shall have great reward of god / for
his good deed / but I would wit whether the party shall be also discharged in
the common law by such an excepcion of the law of reason or not / for though
ignorance invincible of a statute excuse the party against god / yet as I
have herd it excusyth not in the laws of the realm / ne yet in the
chauncerye as some say all though the case be so that the party to whom the
forfeyture is given may not with conscience leave it.


Stud) verily by thy question thou haste put me in a great doubt / wherefore I
pray the give me a respite therein to make the an answer / but as I suppose
for the time how be it I will not fully afferme it to be as I say / but it
should seem that he should well plede it for his discharge at the common law /
because it shall be taken that it was the intent of the makers of the statute to
except such cases. And the Iuges may many times judge after the mind of the
makers as far as the letter may suffer and so it semyth they may in this
case. And diverse other excepcions there be also from other general grou^des of
the law of the realm by such equyties / as thou have remembered before that
were to long to reherce now.


Doctor. But yet I pray the show me shortly somewhat more of thy mind under
what manner a man may be helped i^ this realm by such equytie.


Student) I will with good will show the somewhat therein.


In what manner a man shall be helped by equyties in the laws of England.
The.xvii. Chapitre.
STudent) First it is to be understand there be in many cases diverse
excepcions from the general grou^des of the law of the realm by other
reasonable grounds of the same law / whereby a man shall be helped in the common
law / as it is of this general ground that it is not lawful for no man to
enter upon a descent / yet for the reasonablenes of the law excepteth from
that ground an infant that has right and has suffered such a descent / and
him also that makes co^tinuell claim and suffers them to enter /
natwitstandynge the dyscent. And of that excepcion they shall have auantage in
the common law: and so it is likewise of diverse statutes as of the statute
whereby it is prohybit / that certain particular tenauntes shall do no waste:
yet if a lease for term of years be made to an infant that is within years of
discrecion / as of ye age of.v. or.vi. years and a stranger do waste / in this
case this infant shall not be punysshed for the wast / for he is excepted and
excused by the law of reason. And a woman couerte to whom such a lease is
made after the couerture shall be also discharged of waste after her husbands
death by a reasonable maxim and custom of the realm. And also for reparacio^s
to be made upon ye same ground: it is lawful for such particular tenantes to
cute down trees upon the same ground to make reparacions. But the cause there
as I suppose is for that the mind of the makers of the said estatute shall be
taken to be that / that case should be excepted. And in all these cases the
parties shall be helped in the same court and by the common law. And thus it
appears that sometime a man may be excepted fro the rigor of a maxine of the
law by another maxim of the law. And sometime fro the rigor of a statute by
the law of reason: and some time by the intent of the makers of the statute:
but yet it is to be understand that most commonly where any thing is
excepted fro the general customs or maxims of the laws of the realm. By
the law of reason the party must have his remedy by a wryt that is called
Sub pena. if a Subpena lie in the case: but where a Subpena lies / and where
not: it is not our intent to treat of at this time. And in some case there is
no remedy for such an equytie by way of compulsion / but all the remedy
therein must be committed to the conscience of the party.


Doctor) but in case where a Sub pena lies to whom shall it be directed:
whether to the Judge or to the party.


Stud) It shall never be directed to the Judge / but to the pertie pleintyfe or
to his attorney and thereupon an iniu^ction co^maundynge them by the same under
a certain pain therein to be contained that he proceed no ferther at the common
law / till it be determined in the kings chauncerye: whether the pleyntyfe
has title in conscience to recover or not. And when the pleyntife by reason
of such an iniu^ction seasseth to ask any ferther process: the Iuges will in
likewise seasse to make any ferther process in that behalf.


Doctor) Is there any mention made in the laws of England of any such
equyties.


Stud) Of this term equytie to that intent that is spoken of here there is no
mention made in the laws of England / but of an equytie dyriuyed upon
certain statutes mention is made many times and often in the law of England.
But that equytie is all of another effect then this is / but of the effect of
this equytie that we now speak of mention is made many times / for it is often
times argued in the law of England where a Sub pena lies and where not: and
daily bylles be made by men lernyd in the law of the realm to have Sub penas.
And it is not prohybite by the law / but that they may well do it so that they
make them not: but in case where they ought to be made and not for vexacion of
the party / but according to the troth of the matter. And the law will in
many cases that there shall be such remedy in the chauncerye upon diverse
things groundyd upon such equyties / and than the lord Chanceller must order
his conscience after the rules and grou^des of the law of the realm / in so
much that it had not ben much inconvenient to have assigned such remedy in
the chauncerye upon such equyties for the.vii. ground of the law of England
/ but for as much as no record remaynethe in the kings courts of no such
bylle ne of the writ of Sub pena or Iniunction that is suyd thereupon:
therefore it is not set as for a special ground of the law / but as a thing
that is suffered by the law.


Doc. Then sithe the parties ought of right in many cases to be helped in the
chauncerye upon such equyties. It seems that if it were ordained by stutute /
that there should be no remedy upon such equyties in the chauncerye nor in
none other place / but that every matter should be orderyd only by the rules
and grou^des of the common law: that that statute were against right and
conscience.


Stude^t) I think the same / but I suppose there is no such statute.


Doc. There is a statute of that effect as I have herd say / wherein I would
gladly here thy oppinion.


Student. Show me that statute and I shall with good will say as me thinks
therein.


Whether the statute herafter reherced by the doctoure be against conscience
or not. The.xviii. Chapitre.
DOctoure. There is a statute made in the.iiii. year of king Henry the fourth
the.xxii. chapitre / whereby it is enacted that iugementes given in the kings
courts / shall not be examined in the chauncerye / parliament / nor else where
/ by which statute it apperyth that if any judgment be given in the kings
courts against an equytie or against any matter of conscience / that there can
be had no remedy by that equytie / for the judgment can not be reformed without
examinacion / and the examinacion is be the said statute prohibit: wherefore it
semyth that the said statute is against conscience / what is thyn oppinion
therein.


Stud) If iugeme^tes given in the kings courts should be examined in the
chauncerye before the kings co^ceyl or in any other place / the plaintifes or
demandauntes should seldom come to the effect of their suyte / ne the law
should never have end. And therefore to eschew that inco^uenice yt statute was
made. And though peraue^ture by reason of that statute / some singular person
may happen to have loss. Nevertheless the said statute is very necessary
to eschew many great vexacions and iniust expenses that would else come to many
plaintifes that have right wisely recovered in the kings courts. And it is
much more provided for in the law of England that hurt nor damages should
not come to many than only to one. And also the said statute does not
prohybite equity / but it prohybiteth only the examinacion of the judgment for
the eschewynge of the inco^uenie^ce before reherced. And so it semethe that the
said statute stands with good conscience.

And in many other cases where a man does wrong / yet he shall not be
co^pellyd by way of compulsion to reform it / for many times it must be
left to the conscience of the party / whether he will redress it or not. And
in such case he is in conscience as well bound to redress it if he will save
his soul / as he were if he werre compellable thereto by the law as it may
appear in diverse cases that may be put upon the same ground.


Doctoure) I pray the put some of those cases for an example.


Stud) If the defendant wage his law in an accion of debt brought upon a
true debt the pleintyfe has no means to come to his debt by way of
co^pulsion / neither by Subpena nor other wise / and yet the defendau^t is
bound in conscience to pay him. Also if the grande Jury in attaynt afferme a
false verdit given by the pety Iurye there is no further remedy but the
conscience of the party. Also where there can be had no sufficient prouffe /
there can be no remedy in the Chauncerye / no more than there may be in the
spiritual court. And because thou haste given an occasion to speak of
conscience / I would gladly here thy oppynion where conscience shall be ruled
after the law / and where the law shall be ruled after conscience.


Doc. And of yt matter I would likewise gladly here thy oppinion / specially in
cases grou^dyd upon the laws of Enlgande / for I have not herd but little
thereof in time past / but before thou put any cases thereof: I would that thou
would show me how those two questions after thy oppinion are to be
understand.


Of what law this question is to be understand: that is to say / where
conscience shall be ruled after the law. The.xix. Chapitre.
STudent. The law whereof mention is made in this question: that is to say
where conscience shall be ruled by the law / is not as me seems to be
understand only of the law of reason / and of the law of god / but also of
the law of man that is not contrary to the law of reason nor the law of god:
but that it is supperadded unto them for the better ordering of the common
wealth / for such a law of man is always to be set as a rule in conscience:
so that it is not lawful for no man to go fro it on the one side ne on the
other / for such a law of man has not only the strength of man's law / but
also of the law of reason / or of the law of god / whereof it is dyriuied / for
laws made by man which have received of god power to make laws be made by
god. And therefore conscience must be ordered by that law / as it must be
upon the law of god / and upon the law of reason. And ferthermore that law
whereof mention is made in the latter end of the chapitre next before: that is
to say in that question wherein it is asked where the law is to be left and
forsaken for conscience / is not to be understand of the law of reason nor of
the law of god: for tho two laws may not be left / nor it is not to be
understand of the law of man that is made in particular cases / and that is
consonant to the law of reason / and to the law of god / and that yet that
law should be left for conscience: for of such a law made by man conscience
must be ruled / as is said before. Nor it is not to be vndepsta^de of a law
made by man co^maundynge or prohybitynge any thing to be done that is against
the law of reason or the law of god. For if any law made by man / bind any
person to any thing that is against the said laws / it is no law / but a
corrupcion and a manifest error. Therefore after them that be learned in the
laws of England / the said question: that is to say where the law is to be
left for conscience and where not / is to be understand in diverse manners and
after diverse rules / as here after shall somewhat be touched.

First many unlearned persons believe that it is lawful for them to do with good
conscience / all things which if they do them / they shall not be punysshed
therefore by the law / though the law does not warraunt them to do that they do
/ but only when it is done does not for some reasonable co^sideracion punysshe
him that does it / but leuyth it only to his conscience. And therefore many
persons do often times that they should not do / and keep as their own that /
that in conscience tey ought to restore / whereof there is in the laws of
England this case. If two men have a wood jointly / and the one of them
sells ye wood and keeps all the money hollye to him self. In this case his
fellow shall have no remedy against him by the law / for as they when they
took the wood ioyntlye put each other in trust / and were contented to occupy
together: so the law sufferyth them to order the profittes thereof according
to the trust that each of them put other in. And yet if one took all the
profittes / he is bound in conscience to restore the half to his fellow: for
as the law gives him right only to the half land / so it gives him right
only in conscience to the half profittes. And yet nevertheless it can not be
said in that case / that the law is against conscience / for the law neither
wyllyth ne co^maundyth that one should take all the profittes / but leuyth it
to their conscience: so that no defaute can be found in the law / but in him
that takes all the profittes to him self may be assigned defaute / which is
bound in conscience to reform if he will save his soul / though he can not
be compelled thereto by the law. And therefore in this case and other like /
that oppinion which some have / that they may do with conscience all that they
shall not be punysshed: for by the law if they do it / is to be left for
conscience / but the law is not to be left for conscience.


Addicion.
Also many men think that if a man have land that another has title to / if
he that has the right shall not by the accion that is given him by the law to
recouere his right by: recouere damages / that then he that has the land is
also discharged of damages in conscience: and that is a great error in
conscience / for though he can not be compelled to yield the damages by no
man's law / yet he is compelled thereto by the law of reason and by the law
of god / whereby we be bound to do as we would be done to / and that we shall
not coueyte our neighbors good. And therefore if tenant in tail be disseased
and the disseasour dies seized / and then the heir i^ the tail brings a
Formedon and recoueryth the land / and no damages: for the law gives him no
damage in that case: yet the tenant by conscience is bounden to yield damages
to the heir in tail fro the death of his ancestre. Also it is taken by some
men / that the law must be left for conscience where the law does not
suffer a man to deny yt he has before affermed in court of record / or for
that he has wylfully excluded him self thereof for some other cause / as if
the daughter that is only heir to her father will sue lyuerey with her suster
that is bastard / in that case she shall not be after received to say that her
suster is bastard: in so much that if her suster take half the land with
her / there is no remedy against her by the law. And no more there is of
diversity other estopelles / which were to long to reherce now And yet the
party that may take auantage of such an estopel by the law / is bound in
conscience to forsake that auantage specially if he were so estopped by
ignorance / and not by his own knowledge and assent for though the law i^
such cases gives no remedy to him that is estopped: yet the law iugeth not
that the other has right unto the thing that is in variaunce bytwyxte them.
Also it is understand that the law is to be left for conscience / where a
thing is tried and found by verdit against the troth / for in the common law
the judgment must be given according as it is pleaded and tried like as it is
i^ other laws / that the judgment must be given according to that / that is
pleaded and proved.

Also it is understand that the law is to be left for conscience / where the
cause of the law does cease: for when the cause of the law does cease / the
law also does cease in conscience / as apperyth by this case here after
following.

Addicion.
A man makes a lease for term of life / and after a stranger does waste /
wherefore the less bri^geth an accion of Trn^s and has judgment to recover
damages having regard to the treble damages that he shall yield to him i^ the
reuercion. And aft he in the reuercion before accion of waste sued dies: so yt
the accion of waste is thereby extincted / then the tenant for term of life
(though he may sue execucion of the said judgment by the law) yet he may not
do it by conscience: for in conscience he may take no more then he is hurted
by the said trespass / because he is not chargyd over with the treble damages
to his lessoure.

Also it is understand where a law is grounded upon a presumpcion / for if
the presumpcion be untrue / then the law is not to be holden in conscience.
And now I have showed the somewhat how that question: that is to say where the
law shall be ruled after conscience I pray the show me whether there be not
like diversities in other laws bytwyxte law and conscience.

Doctor) Yes verily very many whereof thou haste recyted one before / where a
thing that is untrue is pleaded and proved / in which case judgment must be
given according as well in the law Cyuile as in the law Canon. And another
case is that if the heir make not his inuentory / he shall be bound after the
law Cyuile to all the dettes though the goods amount not to so much. And the
law Canon is not against that law / and yet in conscience the heir which
in the laws of England is called an executour is not in that case charged to
the dettes / but accordi^ge to the value of the goods. And now I pray the
show me some cases where conscience shall be ruled after ye law.


Stud. I will with good will show the somewhat as me thinks therein.


Here follows diverse cases where conscience is to be orderyd after the law.
The.xx. Chapitre.
STudent) The eldest sone shall have and enjoy his father lands at the common
law in conscience / as he shall in the law. And in Burghenglysshe the younger
sone shall enjoy the inheritance / and that in conscience. And in Gauelkynde
all the sons shall inherit the land together as daughters at the common law
and that in conscience. And there can be none other cause assigned why
conscience in the first case is with the eldest brother / and in the second
with the younger brother / and i^ the third case with all the brethren. But
because the law of England by reason of diverse customs does sometime give
the land hollye to the eldest sone / sometime to the youngest / and sometime to
all.

Also if a man of his mere mocion make a feffeme^t of two acres of land lyenge
in two several shyres / and makes lyuerey of season in the one acre in the
name of both In this case the feffe has right but only to that acre whereof
lyuerey of season was made / because he has no title by ye law: but if both
acres had been in one shyre he had had good right to both. And in these cases
the diversity of the law makyth the diversity of conscience.

Also if a man of his mere mocion make a feffement of a manner and says not to
have and to hold. etc^. with the appurtynances / in that case the feffe has
right to ye demesne lands and to the rentes / if there be atturnament and to
the common parteynynge to the manner / but he has another right to the aduowsons
appendaunt if any be / nor to the vylleins regardant: but if this term with
thapurtynau^ces had been in the deed / the feffe had had right in conscience
as well to the aduowsons and vylleins / as to the residue of the manner: but if
the king of his mere mocion give a manner with the appurtynaunces / yet the
donee has neither right in law nor conscience to the aduowsons nor vylleins.
And the diversity of the law in these cases makes the diversity of
conscience.

Also if a man make a lease for term of years yeldynge to him and to his
heirs a certain rent upon condition that if the rent be behind by.xl. days.
etc^. that then it shall be lawful to the lessour and his heirs to rentre. And
after the rent is behind the lessour askyth the rent according to the law
and it is not paid / the lessour dies his heir enters. In this case his
enter is lawful both in law and conscience: but if the lessoure had dyed
before he had demau^dyd the rent / and his heir demand the rent / and
because it is not paid he rentreth / in that case his rentre is not lawful
another in law nor in conscience.

Also if the tenant in dower sow her land and dye before her corn be ripe /
that corn in conscience belongs to her executours / and not to him in the
reuercion / but otherwise it is in conscience of grass and fruits. And the
diversity of the law makyth there also the diversity in conscience.

Also if a man seized of lands in his demesne as of fee / byquethyth the same
by his last will to another and to his heirs and dies. In these case the heir
not with sta^dynge the will has right to the land in conscience. And the
reason is because the law iugeth that will to be void: and as it is void in
the law / so it is void in conscience. Also if a man grant a rent for
term of life and make a lease of land to the same grant for term of life /
and the tenaunte alyeneth both in fee. In this case he in the reuercion has
good title to the land / both i^ law and conscience and not to the rent. And
the reason is because the land by that alienacion is forfeyt by the law to
him i^ the reuercion and not ye rent.


Addicion.
Also if lands be given to two men and to a woman in fee / and after one of
the men entermarieth with the woman and alieneth the land and dies. In this
case the woman has right but only to the third part / but if the man and
the woman had been married together before the first feffement / then the woman
natwithsta^dyng the alienacion of her husband should have had right in law
and conscience to the one half of the land. And so in these two cases
conscience does follow the law of the realm. Also if a man have two sons /
one before spousellys and another after spouselles / and after the father dies
seized of certain lands. In that case the younger sone shall enjoy the lands
in this realm as heir to his father both in law and conscience. And the
cause is / because the sone borne after spousellys / is by the law of this
realm the very heir / and the elder sone is a bastard. And of these cases and
many other like in the laws of England may be formed the Silogisme of
conscience / or the true judgment of conscience in this manner. Sinderesis
ministers the mayor thus. Ryghtwysenesse is to be done to every man: upon
which mayor the law of England ministers the minor thus. The inheritance
bylongeth to the sone borne aft spouselles / and not to the sone borne before
spouselles / then conscience makes the conclusion and says therefore the
inheritance is in conscience to be given to the sone borne after spousellys.
And so in other cases infinite may be formed by the law the Silogisme or the
right judgment of conscience: wherefore they that be lernyd in the law of the
realm say that in every case where any law is ordained for the disposicion of
lands and goods / which is not against the law of god / nor yet against the
law of reason / that that law byndeth all them that be under the law in the
court of conscience / that is to say inwardly i^ his soul. And therefore it is
somewhat to marvel that spiritual men have not endeavored themself in time
past to have more knowledge of the kings laws then they have done / or that
they yet do: for by the ignorance thereof they be often times ignorant of that /
that should order them according to right and justice / as well concerning
themself as other yt come to them for co^ceyll. And now for as much as I have
answered to thy questions as well as I can: I pray the that thou will show
me thy oppinion in diverse cases formed upon the law of Eglande wherein I am in
doubt / what is to be holden therein in conscience.

Doctoure) Show me thy questions and I will say as me thinks therein.


The first question of the student. The.xxi. Chapitre.
STudent) If an infaunt that is of the age of.xx. year and has reason and
wisdom to govern himself sells his land and with the money thereof byeth
other land of greater value then the first was and takes the profittes thereof
/ whether may that infaunte ask his first land again i^ conscience / as he
may by the law.


Doctor. What thynkest thou in that question.


Stud) Me seems that for as much as the law of England in this article is
grounded upon a presumpcion / that is to say that infauntes commonly before
they be of the age of.xxi. years be not able to govern them self / that yet
for as much as that presumpcion fails i^ this infau^te that he may not in
this case with conscience ask the land again that he has sold to his great
advantage as before appears.


Doc. Is not this sale of the infaunte and the feffeme^t made thereupon if any
were voydable in the law.


Stud. Yes verylye.


Doc. And if the feffe have no right by the bargayne / nor by the feffement
made thereupon: whereby should he then have right thereto as thou thynkest.


Stud. By conscience as me thinks for ye reason that I have made before.


Doctor) And upon what law should that conscience be grounded that thou
spekest of / for it can not be grounded by the law of the realm as thou haste
said thy self. And me thinks that it can not be grounded upon the law of
god / nor upon the law of reason: for feffeme^tes nor contractes be not
grounded upon neither of tho laws / but upon the law of man.


Stud) After the law of propriete was ordained / the people might not
conveniently live together without contractes / and therefore it seems yt
co^tractes be grounded upon the law of reason / or at the least upon the law
that is called Ius gentium.


Doct. Though contractes be grounded upon that law that is called Ius gentiu^ /
because they be so necessary and so general among all people / yet that
proves not that co^tractes be grounded upon the law of reason: for though
that law called Ius gentium be much necessary for the people yet it may be
changed. And therefore if it were ordained by statute yt there should be no
sale of land / ne no co^tracte of goods. And if any were that it should be
void / so that every man should co^tynewe still seized of his lands and
possessed of his goods / the statute were good. And then if a man against yt
statute sold his land for a su^me of money / yet the seller might lawfully
retain his land according to the statute. And then he were bound to no more
/ but to repaye the money that he received with reasonable expe^ces in that
behalf / and so i^ likewise me thinks that in this case the infant may with
good conscience reentre in to his first land / because the co^tracte after the
maxims of the law of the realm is void / for as I have herd the maxims of
the law be of as great strength in the law as statutes. And so me thinks
that in this case the infaunt is bound to no more / but only to repay the
money to him that he sold his land unto / with such reasonable costs and
charges as he has sustained by reason of the same. But if a man sell his land
by a sufficient and lawful co^tracte though there lacks lyuerye of season or
such other solempnities of the law: yet the seller is bound in conscience to
perform the contracte / but in this case the contracte is insufficient / and
so me thinks great diversity bytwyxt the cases.


Stud. For this time I hold me contented with thy opoinion.


The second question of the student. The.xxii. Chapitre.
STudent. If a man that has lands for term of life be impanelled upon an
inquest / and thereupon leseth yssues and dies / where may tho yssues be
levied upon him in the reuercion in conscience as they may be by the law.


Doct. If they may be levied by the law / what is the cause why thou do
doubt whether they may be levied by conscience.


Stude^t) For there is a maxim in the laws of England / that where two
tytles run together / the eldeste title shall be preferred. And in this case
the title of him in the reuercion is before the title of the forfetour of the
yssues. And therefore I doubt somewhat whether they may be lawfully leuyed.


Doct. By that reason it symeth thou art in doubt what the law is in these
case / but that must necessarely be known / for else it where in vain to argue
what conscience will therein.


Stud. it is certain that the law is such / and so it is like wise if the
husband forfet yssues and dye / tho yssues shall be leuyed on the lands of the
wife.


Doct. And if the law be such it symeth that conscience is so in likewise /
forsyth it is the law that for execucion of Justice every man shall be
i^panelled when need requires it seems reasonable / that if he will not
appear that he should have some punyssheme^t for his not apperau^ce: for else
the law should be clearly frustrate in that point. And that pain as I have
herd is that he shall lose yssues to ye king for his not apperau^ce / wherefore
it seems not inconuenie^t nor against conscience though the law be that tho
yssues shall be leuyed of him i^ the reuercion / for that condition was secretlye
understand in the law to pass with the lease wha^ the lease was made. And
therefore it is for ye lessour to beware and to prevent that danger at the
making of the lease / or else it shall be aiuged his own defaute. And than this
pertyculer maxyme whereby such yssues shall be leuyed upon him in the reuercyon
is a pertyculer excepcyon in the law of England from that general maxyme
that thou haste remembered before: that is to say that where two tytles run
together / that the eldest title shall be preferred / and so in this case that
general maxim in this point shall hold no place / another in law nor in
conscience / for by this particular maxim the strength of that general
maxim is restreyned to every intent / that is to say / as well in law as in
conscience.


The third question of the student. The.xxiii. Chapitre.
STude^t. If a tenant for term of life / or for term of years do waste whereby
they be bound by the law to yield to him in the reuercion treble damages. And
shall also forfet the place wasted / whether is he also bound in conscience to
pay tho damages / and to restore the place wasted immediately after the waste
done / as he is the single damages / or that he is not bound thereto till the
treble damages and the place wasted be recovered in the kings court.


Doctor. Before judgment given of the treble damages and of the place wasted
he is not bound in conscience to pay them. For it is uncertain what he should
pay / but it suffiseth that he be ready till judgment be given to yield damages
according to the value of the waste / but after the judgment given / he is
bounden in conscience to yield the treble damages / and also the place wasted.
And the same law is in all statutes penal / that is to say / yt no man is
bound in conscience to pay the penaltye till it be recovered by the law.


Stud. Whether may he that has offended against such a statute penal defend
the accion and hyndre the judgment to the intent he would not pay the penalty
/ but only the single damages.


Doctor. If the accion be taken ryghtwysely according to the statute and upon
a just cause / the defendant may in no wise defend the accion / onles he
have a true dylatorie matter to plede: which should be hurtful to him if he
pleded it not / though he be not bound to pay the penalty till it be
recovered.


The fourth question of the stude^t. The.xxiiii. chapitre.
STudent. If a man infeffe another in certain land upon condition that if he
infeffe any other: that it shall be lawful for the feffour and his heirs to
reentre etc^. whether is this condition good in conscience though it be void
in the law


Doctor. What is the cause why this condition is void in the law.


Stud. The cause is this / by the law it is incide^t to every state of fee
simple / that he that has that estate may lawfully by the law and by the
gift of the feffoure make a feffement thereof. And than when the feffoure
restrayneth him after that he shall make no feffement to no man against his
own former grant / and also against the purity of the state of a fee simple
/ the law iugeth the condition to be void / but if the condition had been that
he should not have infeffed such a man / or such a man that condition had been
good / for yet he might infeffe other.


Doctor. though the said condition be against the effect of the stand of a
fee simple and also against the law. Nevertheless it is not against the
intent that the parties agreed upon and that at the time of the lyuerey. And
for as much as the intent of the party was that if the feffe infeffed any man
of the land / that the the feffour should enter / and to that intent the feffe
took the estate and after break the intent it seems that the land in
conscience should return to the feffour.


Stud. the intent of the parties in the laws of England is void in many
cases / that is to say if it be not ordered according to the law. As if a man
of his mere mocion without any recompense intending to give lands to another
and to his heirs make a deed unto him / whereby he gives him the lands to
have and to hold to him for ever intendyng that by that word (for ever) the
feffe should have the land to him and to his heirs / in this case his intent
is void / and the other shall have the land only for term of life. Also if a
man give lands to another and to his heirs for term of.xx. years inte^dyng
that if the lessee dye within the term / that than his heirs should enjoy
the land during the term. In this case his intent is void / for by the law
of the realm all chatellys real and personal shall go to ye executoures /
and not to the heir. Also if a man give lands to a man and to his wife / and
to the third person intending that every of them should take the third part
of the land as three common persons should his intent is void / for the
husband and the wife as one person in the law shall take only the one half
and the third person ye other half / but these cases be always to be
understand where the said estates be made without any recompense And for as
much as in this principal case / the intent of the feoffour is groundid
against the law: and that there is no recompense appointed for the feffement:
me thinks yt the feffour has neither right to the land by law nor
conscience / for if he should have it by conscience / that conscience should be
grounded upon the law of reason and yt it can not / for conditions be not
grounded upon the law of reason / but upon the maxymes and custom of the
realm. And therefore it might be ordained by statute / that al condicio^s made
upon land should be void. And wha^ a condition is void by the maxims of the
law / it is as fully void to every intent as if it were made void by statute
/ and so me thinks that in this case the feffour has no right to the land
in law nor in conscience.


Doctoure. I am content thy opinion stand till we shall have hereafter a
better leisure to speak ferther in this matter.


The.v. question of the Student. The.xxv. Chapitre.
STudent. If a fine with proclamacio^ be leuyed according to the statute and
no claim made within.v. years. etc^. whether is the right of a stranger
extincted thereby in conscience / as it is in the law.


Doctoure. Upon what consideracion was that statute made.


Stude^t that the right of lands and tenementes might be the more certainly
known and not to be so uncertain as they were before that statute.


Doctoure. And when any law of man is made for a common welthe / or for a good
peace and quietness of the people / or for any inconvenience or hurt to be
saved from them / that law is good though percase it extincte the right of a
stranger and must be kept in the court of conscience for as it is said before
in the.iiii. chapitre. By laws rightewysely made by man: it appears who has
right to the lands and goods: for what so ever a man has by such a law
he has it rightewisely.

And what so ever he holds against such a law he holds vnrightwisely.
And ferthermore as it is said there all laws made by man / which be not
contrary to the law of god must be observed and kept / and that in
conscience.

And he that dispiseth them dispiseth god: and that resists them resists
god / also it is to be understand that possessions / and the right thereof be
subject to the laws / so that they therefore with a cause reasonable may be
translated and altered from one man to another by the act of the law. And of
this consideracion that law is grounded that by a contracte made in feyres and
markettes the propretye is altered except the propretye be to the king / so
that the byer pay toll / or do such other things as is a customed there to
be done upon such contractes / and that the byer knows not the former
propretye. And in the law Civil there is a like law that if a man have
another man's good with a title.iii. year thinking that he has right to it
he has the very right unto the thing: and that was made for a law to the
intent that the propretye and right of things should not be uncertain / and
that variaunce and strife should not be among the people. And for as much as
the said statute was ordained to give a certei^te of title in the lands and
teneme^tes comprised in the fine / It seems that that fine exti^cted the title
of all other / as well in conscience as it does in the law. And sithe I have
answered to thy question I pray the let me know thy mind in one question
concerning tayled lands and than I will trouble the no ferther at this time.


A question made by the Doctor / how certain recoueries that be used i^ the
kings courts to defete tayled land may stand with conscience. The.xxvi.
Chapitre.
Doctor. I have herd say that wha^ a man that is seized of lands in the
tail sells the land. That it is commonly used that he that byeth the land
shall for his suertye / and for the auoydyng of the tail in that behalf /
cause some of his friends to recover the said lands against the said tenant
in tail: which recouerye as I have been credably informed shall be had in this
manner / the demaundau^tes shall suppose in their writ and declaracion that
the tenant has no enter / but by such a stranger as the byer shall list to
name and appoynte / where in deed the demaundauntes never had possession thereof
/ nor yet the said stranger. And thereupo^ the said tenaunte in tail shall
appear in the court and by coue^ and by alient of the parties / shall vouche to
warrante one that he knows well has nothing to yield in value. And that
vouche shall appear and the demaundauntes shall declare against him / and
thereupon he shall take a day to enperle i^ the same term: and at that day by
assent and couen of the parties / he shall make defaulte upon which default
because it is a default in despite of the court / the demaundauntes shall have
judgment to recover against the tenant in tail / and he over in value against
the vouche and this judgment and recovery in value / is taken for a bar of
the tail for ever / how may it therefore be taken that that law stands with
conscience that as it seems aloweth and favors such feigned recoueries.


Stude^t. If the tenant in tail sell the land for a certain su^me of money as
is agreed betwixt them at such a price as is commonly used of other lands /
and for the suertye of the sale suffers such a recouerye as is aforesaid /
what is the cause that moves the to doubt whether the said contracte or the
recovery made thereupon: for the suertye of the byer that has truly paid his
money for the same should stand with conscience.


Doctor. Two things cause me to doubt therein / one is for that yt aft our
lord had given the land of byheste to Abrahan and to his sede / that is to
say to his children in possession always to continue / he said to Moses as
it appears Leuitice^. xxv. the land shall not be sold for ever / for it is
mine. And than our lord assigned a certain manner how the land might be
redeemed in the year of Jubilee if it were sold before: and for as much as our
lord would that the land so given to Abraham and his children should not be
sold for ever / it seems yt he does against the ensample of god yt alieneth
or sells the land that is given to him and to his children as lands
intayled be given. Another cause is this: it appears by the commandment of
god that thou shall not coueyt the house of thy neighbor. etc^. And if the
co^cupisce^ce be prohibited more stronger the unlawful taking and withholding
thereof is prohibit / and for as much as tayled land wha^ the auncestre is
deed is a thing that of right is belonging to his heir / for that he is
heir according to the gift / how may that land with right or conscience be
holden from him


Stude^t. Natwithstandynge that prohibicion of almighti god: whereby the land
that was given to Abraham and to his seed might not be aliened for ever / yet
lands within walled towns might lawfully be aliened for ever / except the
lands of the levites as it appears in the said chapitre of Leuitici.xxv. And
so it appears yt the said prohibicion was not general for every place: and
that among the Jews.

And it appears also that it was given only for Abraham and his children /
and so it was not general to all people. And it appears also that it extended
not but only to the land of promission / as it appears by the words of the
said chapitre / where it is said thus all the region of your possession shall be
sold under the condition of redemynge / whereby appears that lands in other
countres be not bound to yt condition / and as they be not bound to yt
condition: by the same reason / it follows that they be not bound to the same
succession. Therefore the said law that will that the land given to Abraham
and to his seed shall not be sold for ever / binds no land out of the land
of promission / and some men will say that sythen the passion of our lord was
promulgate and known it byndeth not there. And to the second reason which is
grounded upon the commandment of god: It must needs be granted that it is
not lawfully to any man unlawfully to couere the house of his neighbor / and
that than more stronger he may not unlawfully take it from him: but tha^ it
remains for the yet to prove / how in this case this tayled land that is
sold by his auncestre / and whereof a recovery is had of record in the kings
court may be said the land of the heirs.


Doctor. that may be proved by the law of the real me / that is to say by the
statute of westmi^ster the second the first chapitre / where it is said thus.
The will of the gyuer expressly contained in the deed of his gift shall be from
hensforth observed / so yt they to whom the tenementes be so given shall not
have power to alyen / but that the lands after their death shall remayn to
their issue or return to the donour if the issue fail / by the which
statute it appears evidently that though they to whom the tenementes were so
given aliened them away / that yet nevertheless they in law and conscience by
reason of the said statute ought to remayn to the heirs according to the
gift / for it is holden commonly by all Doctoures that the commandments and
rewles of the law of man or of a positive law that is lawfully made / bind
all yt be subjects to that law according to ye mind of the maker and that in
the court of conscience.


Student. Do thou think that if a man offend against a statute penal that
he offends in conscience admit that he do it not of a wilful disobedience
for that he will not obey the law / for if he do it of disobedience I think he
offe^deth


Doctor. If it be but only a statute yt is called Populare it byndeth not in
conscience to the payment of the penalitie / til it be recovered by the law.
And than it does bind in conscience / but if a statute be made principally to
remedy the hurt of the party / and for that hurt it gives a penaltye to the
party in that case the offendour of the statute is bound immediately to
restore the damages to the value of the hurt as it is upon the statute of waste
/ but the penaltye above the hurt he is not bound to pay till judgment be
given as it is said before / but statutes by ye which it is assigned who shall
have right or propertye to these lands and teneme^tes / or to these goods or
catailes if it be not against the law of god / nor against the law of reason
bind all them that be subgecte to the law: in law and conscience / and such
a statute is the statute of westminster the.ii. whereof we have treated before
/ wherefore it must* be observed in conscience.


Stud. But some hold that the said statute of Westmynster* the.ii. was made
of a singularity and presumpcion of many that were at the said parliament for
exaltinge and magnifienge of their own blood: and therefore they say that that
statute made by such a presumpcion byndeth not in conscience.


Doctor. It is very perilous to judge for certain that the said statute was
made of such a presumpcion as thou spekest of / for there be many
consideracions to prove that the said statute was not made of such a
presumpcion but rather of a very good mind of all the parlyamente / or at the least of the more part thereof / and for the common welthe of all the realm /
and first in the king the which in the said parliament was the head and most
chyef and principal part of the parliament as he is in every parliament / can
not be noted no such intent / For it is not necessary nor it was not than in
use that lands of the crown should be entayled: and in spiritual men ne yet
in certain burgesies and cytize^s of the said parlyamente which at that time
had no land / there can be noted no such singularity / nor yet in the noble
me^ and gentilmen nor such other as were of ye said parliament and had lands
and teneme^tes It is not good to judge i^ certain that they did it of such a
presu^pcion / but it is good and expedient in this case as it is in other cases
that be in doubt to hold the surer way / and that is that it was made of
charity / to the intent that he nor the heirs of him to whom the land was
given should not fall in to extreme pouertye / and thereby haplye to run in
to offense against god / and though it were true as they say that it was
not made of charytie but of presumpcion and singularity as they speak of.
Nevertheless for as much as the statute is not against the law of god nor
against the law of reason it must be observed by all the^ that be subjects
unto that law / For as John^ Gerson says in the treatise that he entituleth
in latin De vita spirituali anime: the fourth lesson and the third
corollarie: says that god will that makers of laws judge only of outward
things and reserve secret things to him. And so it appears that man may
not judge of the inward intent of the deed / but of such things as be
apparau^t / and certain it is that it is not apparaunte that there was any
such corrupt intent in the makers of the said statute / how may it therefore
be said that yt law is good or right wise / that not only suffers such
things against the statute / but also against the commandment of god.


Stude^t. To that some answer and say: that when the land is sold and a
recovery is had thereupon in the kings court of record that it suffices to
bar the tail in conscience / for they say that as the tail was first
ordained by the law.

So they say that by the law it is adnulled again.


Doctoure. Be thou thy self judge if in that case there be like auctorite in the
making of the tail as there is in the adnullynge thereof / for it was ordained
by auctorite of parliament / the which is always taken for the most high court
in this realm before any other / and it is anulled by a false supposell: for
that that they that be named demaundau^tes should have right to the land where
in truth they never had right thereto: whereupon follows a false supposell in
the writ / and a false supposell in the declaracion and a voucher to
warrau^te by couyn of such a person as has nothing to yield in value and
thereupon by couyn and collucion of the perties follows the default of the
vouchee: by the which default the judgment shall be given. And so all that
judgment is deriuyed and grounded of the untrue supposell and ouyn of the
parties / whereby the law of realm that has ordained such a writ of enter
to help them that have right to lands or tenementes is defrauded: the court
is desceyued the heir is disherited: and as it is to doubt the byer and the
seller and their heirs and assigns having knowledge of the tail be bound to
restitucion / and verily I have herd many times / that aft the law of the
realm such recoueries should be no bar to the heir in the tail if the
law of the realm might be therein indifferently hard.


Stude^t. I can not se but that after the law of the realm it is a bar of
the tail / for when the tenant in tail has vouched to warrauntie / and the
vouchee has appeared and entered in to the warrauntye / and after has made
defaut in despite of the court: whereupon judgment is given for the demaundaunt
against the tenant / and for the tenant that he shall recover in value
against the vouchee / the heir in the tail should after bring his form done
and recover the lands intayled / and after vouchee purchases lands / than
should the heir also have execucion against him to the value of the lands
entayled as heir to his auncestre yt was tenant in the first accion: and so
he should have his own lands / and also the lands recovered in value: and
therefore because of that presumpcion that the vouchee may purchase lands
after the judgment / some be of opinion that it is in the law a good bar of
the tail.


Doctor. I suppose that in that case thou haste put that the vouche may bar
the heir in tail of his recovery in value because he has recovered the
first lands. Nevertheless I will take a respite to be advised of that
recouerye in value. And if thou can yet show me any other consideracion why
the said recoueries should stand with conscience / I pray the let me here thy
co^ceyte therein / for the multitude of the said recoueries is so great that it
were great pytye that all they should be bound to restitucion that have lands
by such recoueries sith there is none that as far as I can here disposes them
to restore.


Student. Some men make an other reason to prove that the said recoueries
should be sufficient by the law to a void the state of west. than and if they
be sufficient thereto / they be sufficient in conscience.


Doctor. What is their reason therein.


Student. In the.vii. year of king Henry the.viii. the.iiii. chapitre among
other things it is enacted / that all recouers their heirs and assigns may
aduowe and justify for rentes service and customs by them recovered: as they
against whom they recovered might have done.

And than they say that wha^ the parliament gave to such recouerers auctorite
to aduowe and justify for such re^tes customs and services as they recovered
/ that ye intent of the parliament was yt such recouers should have right to
that: for the which they should aduowe or iustifi: for else they say that it
should be in vain to give the^ such power / and that the parliament should else
be taken in manner as fortifiers of wrong full rules: and so they say that such
recouerers by reason of the said statute have right the law.


Doctor. That statute as it seems was made only to give to the recouerers a
form to aduowe and iustyfie / which they had not before though they had
recoueryd upon a good title. And the cause why they had no form to aduowe or
justify before the said statute was for as much as the recouerers did not by
the pretense of their accio^ afferme the possession of him or the^ against
whom they recovered / nor claymed not by them / but rather disafermed and
distroyed their astate. And therefore they ca^ not alege any continaunce of
their title by the^ / as they may that have rentes or services / or such other
of the grant of other by deed or by fine. And therefore as it seems the most
principal intent of that statute was: that such recouerers should auowe and
justify for rentes services and customs as they should or might do that had
them by fine or deed not having any respect as it seems whether they
recovered against tenant in fee simple or in fee tail / nor whether the
recoueries were had upon a rightful title. And therefore as me seems the said
estatute neither affermeth nor disaffermeth the title of the recoueries whereby
they do aduowe for if a man had right before the recouerye that right should
remain unto him natwithstandynge the said statute: and so me seems that the
title of them that have the lands entayled by such recoueries is nothing
fortyfyed nor affermyd by the said estatute but that they are i^ the same case
as they were before: what thynkest thou therein.


Student / this matter is great / for as thou sayste there be so many that have
tayled lands by such recoueries / that it were great pytie and heaviness to
condemn so many persons and to judge that they all were bound to
restitucion: For I think there be but few i^ this real me that have lands of
any notable value but that they or their au^cestours / or some other by whom
they claim have had part thereof by such recoueries / In so much that lords
spiritual and temporal knights / squyres rich men / and poor / monasteries
/ collegies / and hospitalles have such lands / for such recoueries have been
used of long time / who may think therefore without great heuines that so many
men should be bound to restitucion / and that yet as thou sayste / no man
disposes him to make restitucion. And so I am in manner perplexed and wot not
what to say in this case / but that yet I trust that ignorance may excuse
many persons in this behalf.


Doctoure. Ignorance of the deed may excuse / but ignorance of the law
excuses not but it be invincible / that is to say that they have done that i^
them is to know the truth as to council with learned men: and to ask the^
what the law is in that behalf and if they answer them that they may do this
or that lawfully / than they be thereby excused in conscience / but yet in
man's laws they be not thereby discharged / but they that have taken upon
them to have knowledge of the law be not excused by ignorance of the law / ne
no more are they that have a wilful ignorance and that would rather be
ignorant than to know the troth. And therefore they will not dispose them to
ask any council in it / and if it be of a thing that is against the law of
god / or the law of reason / no man shall be excused by ignorance / and to
there be but few that be excused by ignorance.


Stude^t. what than shall we condemn so many and so no table men.


Doctoure. We shall not condemn them / but we shall show them their peril.


Student. yet I trust that their danger is not so great that they should be
bound to restitucion. For Ioha^ Gerson says in the said book called Devintate
ecclesiastica consideracione secunda / quod co^munie error facitius. That is to
say a common error makes a right / of which words as it seems some trust
may be had / that though it were fully admitted that the said recoueries were
first had upon an unlawful ground and against the good order of conscience
that yet nevertheless for as much as they have been used of long time / so that
they have been taken of diverse men that have been right well learned in manner as
for a law / that the buyers partly be excused so yt they be not bound to
restitucio^. And moreover it is certain that yt statute of westminster the. 2 nor
none other statute made by man ca^ not be of greater virtue or strength / tha^
was the bond of matrimony that was ordained by god. And though that bond of
matrimoni was indissoluble / yet nevertheless Moses suffered a byll of refusell
to the Jews / which in latin is called Libellu^ repudu / and so they might
thereby forsake their wyfes. As it appears Deutro. xxiii. and therefore like
as a dispensacion was sufred against that bo^de / so it seems it may be
against this statute.


Doctor. as to that reason that thou haste last made of a byll of refusell /
let all purchasours of land here what our lord says in the Gospel to the
Jews of that byll of refusell Mathei. xix. where he says thus / To the
hardness of iour hertes / Moses suffered you to leave your wyfes / for at the
beginning it was not so / of which words Doctors hold commonly that
though such a byll of refusell was lawful so that they yt refused their
wyfes thereby / should be without pain in the law / that yet it was never
lawful so that it should be with out sin. And so likewise it may be said in
this case / that such recoueries be suffered for the hardness of the hertes of
Englisshemen / which desire land and possessions with so great gredynes that
they ca^ not be withdrawn from it neither by the law of god / nor by the law
of the realm And therefore that rich men should not take the possessions of
poor me^ from the^ by power without color of title / that is to say either
by open disseson / or by the only sale of the tenaunte in tail and so to
hold them against the express words of the statute / such recoueryes have been suffered. And though for their great multitude they may haplye be without
pain as to the law of the realm: yet it is to fear that they be not without
offense as against god / and as to thy other reason that a common error should
make a right those words as me seems be to be thus understand / that a
custom used against the law of man shall be taken in some cou^tres for law if
the people be suffered so to continue. And yet some me^ call such a custom an
error because that the continuance of that custom against the law: was
partlye an error in ye people / for that yt they would not obey to the law
that was made by their superiors to the contrary of yt custom: but it is to
be understand that the said recoueries though they have been long used may not
be taken to have the strength of a custom / for many as well learned as
unlearned have always spoken against the^ and yet do. And furthermore as I have
herd say a custom or a prescripcion in this realm against the statutes of
the realm prevail not in the law.


Stude^t. though a custom in this realm preuayleth not against a statute as
to the law / yet it seems that it may prevail against the statute in
conscience / for though ignorance of a statute excuses not in the law /
nevertheless it may excuse in conscience / and so it seems that it may do of a
custom.


Doctoure. But it such recoueries can not be brought in to a lawful custom in
the law / it seems they may not be brought in to a custom in conscience /
for conscience must always be grounded upon some law: and in this case it can
not be grounded upon the law of reason / nor upon the law of god: and
therefore if the law of man serve not / there is no ground whereupon
conscience in this case may be grounded / and at the beginning of such
recoueries they were taken to be goood / because the law should warraunt them
to be good and not by reason of any custom and so if the reason of the law
will not serve in tho recoueries / the custom ca^ not help for an evil
custom is to be put away. And therefore me seems that tho recoueries be not
without offense against god / though haplye for their great multitude / and
that there should not be as it were a subversion of the inheritance of many in
this realm: as well of spiritual as temporal / they be without pain in the
law of the realm: except such recoueries as by the common course of the law
be voydable in the law by reason of some use / or of some other special
matter / but what pain that is I will not temerously judge / but commit it to
the goodness of our lord whose iugementes be very deep and profounde / nor I
will not fully afferme that they that have lands by such recoueries ought to
be compelled to restitucion / but this seems to me to be good council that
every man hereafter hold that is certain and leave that is vncertai^ and that
is that he keep him self from such recoueries and than he shall be fre from all
sertrulousnes of conscience / in that behalf


Student. It seems that in this question thou ponderest greatly the said
statute of Westminster. the.ii. and that though it be but only a law made by man
/ that yet for as much as it is not against the law of reason / nor the law
of god / thou thynkest that it must be holden in conscience / and over that as
it seems thou art somewhat in double whether those recoueries be any bar to
the heir in the tail by the law of the realm onles that he have in value in
deed upon the voucher / and that thou will thereupo^ take a respite or thou
show thy full mind therein / and in likewise thou thi^kest as I take it that
those recoueries can not be brought in to a custom but that ye longer that
they be suffered to continue if they be not good by the law the greater is the
offense against god. And therefore thou ponderest little that custom / but yet
thou agreest that it is good to spare the multitude of them that be paste:
lest a subuercion of the inheritance of many of these realm might follow and
great strife and variaunce also: if they should be adnulled for the time past:
except there be any other especial cause to avoid them by the law as thou
haste touched in thy last reason / but thou thynkest that it were good that
from hensforth such recoueryes should be clearly prohibit and not be suffered to
be had in use as they have been before: and thou cou^ceyllest all men therefore
to refrain them self from such recoueries hereafter.


Doctor. Thou take well that I have said and according as I have mente it


Stude^t. Now I pray the sith I have hard thy question of these recoueries
according to thy desire that thou would answer me to some particular
questions concerning tayled lands: whereof thou have at this time given us
occasion to speak.


Doctoure. show me those questions: and I will show the my mind therein with
good will


The first question of the Student concerning tayled lands. The.xxvii.
Chapitre.
Student. If a dissesour make a gift in the tail to Johan at style and Ioha^
at style for the redemyng of the title of the dissesye agrees with him that he
shall have a certain rent out of the same land to him and to his heirs / and
for the suertye of that rent it is divised that the dissesye shall release his
right in the land. etc^. and that such a recovery as we have spoken of before
shall be had against the said Johan at style to the use of the payment of ye
said rent and of the former tail whether stands that recovery well with
conscience or not as thou thynkest.


Doctor I suppose it does for it is made for the strength and suertye of the
tail which the dissesye might have clearly defeated and avoided if he would /
and therefore as I think if the said Johan at style had granted to the
dissesye only by his deed a certain rent for the releasinge of his title
that grant should have bound the heirs in the tail for ever. And than if
the dissesye for his more suertye will have such a recovery a before appears
it seems that that recouerye stands with good conscience.


Student. It seems that thy oppynion is right good in this matter. And so it
appears that with a reasonable cause some particular recoueries may stand
both with law and conscience to bar a tail.


The second question of the Student concerning tayled lands The.xxviii.
Chapitre.
STudent. I a tenant in tail suffer a recovery against him of the lands
entayled to the intent that the recouerers shall stand seized thereof to the
use of a certain woman whom he ente^deth to take to his wife / for term of
her life / and after to the use of the first tail: and after he maryeth the
same woman / whether stands that recovery with conscience though other
recoueries upon bargaynes and sales did not.


Doctoure. It seems yes / for though the statute be / that they to whom the
tenementes be so given should not have power to aliene / but that the lands
after their death should remain to their issues or reuert to the donours if the
issues failed: yet if he to whom the lands were so given take a wife and
dies seized without heir of his body / and the donour enter the woman shall
recover against him the third part to hold in ye name of her dowre for
term of her life though ye tail be determined / and the same law is of tenant
by ye curtesy: yt is to say of hi^ yt happens to marye one yt is an
e^heritrix of ye land entayled: and they have issue the wife dies and ye
issue dies / he shall hold the lands for term of his life as tenant by the
curtesye / natwithstanding the words of the statute which say that after ye
death of the tenant in tail without issue the lands shall reuert to the
donour / and I think the cause is because the intent of that statute shall
not be taken that it intended to put away such titles as the law should give
by reason of the tail / and so it seems that a like intent of the statute
shall be taken for ioyntours / for else the statute might be sometime a lettynge
of matrymony / and it is not like that the statute intended so / and therefore
it seems that by the only deed of the tenant in tail a ioyntour may be made
by the intent of the statute / though the words of the statute serve not
expressly for it / for many times the intent of the letter shall be taken and
not the bare letter / as it appears in the same statute where it is said that
he to whom ye lands be given shall have no power to alien / yet the same
statute is construed yt neither he nor his heirs of his body shall have no
power to alyen / and so me thinks that such an intent shall be taken here for
saving of ioyntours.


Student. troth it is that sometime the intent of a statute shall be taken
ferther than the express letter stretches / but yet there may no intent be
taken against the express words of ye statute / for that should be rather an
interpretacion of the statute than an exposicio^ and it can not be reasonably
taken / but that the intent of the makers of the statute was that the land
should remain continually in the heirs of the tail as long as the tail
endures / and there can no ioyntour be made neither by deed nor be recouerye /
but that the tail must thereby be discontinued / and therefore this case of
ioyntoure is not like to the said cases of tenant in dower or tenant by the
courtesy / for the title of dowrye and of tenaunty by the curtesye grows
most specially by the continuau^ce of the possession in the heirs of the
tail but it is not so of ioyntoures / and therefore by the only deed of the
tenaunte in tail / there may no Ioyntour be lawfully made against the
express words of the statute. And if there be any made by way of recouerye /
than it seems that it must be put under the same rewle as other recoueryes
must be of lands intayled.


The third question of the Student / concerning tayled lands The.xxix.
Chapitre.
STudent. If John^ at noke being seized of lands in fee of his mere mocio^
make a feoffement of a certain lands to the intent that the feoffes shall
thereof make a gift to the said Johan at noke to have to him and to his heirs
of his body and they make the gift according. And after the said Johan at noke
falls in to debt / wherefore he is taken and put in prison / and thereupon
for payment of his dettes he sells the same land / and for suertye of the
byer he suffers a recovery to be had against him in such manner as before
appears / whether stands that recouerye with conscience or not.


Doctor I would here make a litell digression to ask the another question or
that I made answer to thine: that is to say to feel thy mind how that law
by the which the body of the dettoure shall be taken and cast in to prison
there to remain till he have paid the debt may stand with conscience
specially if the have nothing to pay it with / for as it seems if he will
relinquisshe his goods / which in some laws is called in laten Cedere bonis
that he shall not be inprysoned / and that is to understand most specially if
he be fallen in to pouertye and not through his own defaute.


Student. There is no law in this realm that the defendaunt may in any case
Cedere bones / and as me seems if there were such a law it should not be
indifferent / for as to the knowledge of him that the money is owing to the
dettoure might Cedere bonis / that is to say relinquisshe his goods / and
yet retain to him self secretly great riches. And therefore that law in
such case seems more indifferent and rightouse that commits such a
dettour to the conscience of the plai^tyfe to whom the money is owing tha^
that commits him to the conscience of hi^ that is the dettour / for in the
dettour some defaute may be assigned / but in him to whom the money is owing
may be assinged no defaut.


Doctor. But if he to whom the debt is owinge / knows that the dettoure
has nothing to pay the det with / and that he is fallen in to that poverty by
some casualtie. And not through his own defaute / does the law of England
hold that he may with good conscience keep the dettour still in prison till
he be paid.


Student. nay verily: but it thinks more reasonable to appoint the liberty
and the judgment of conscience in that case to the debt than to the dettoure /
for the cause before rehearsed. And than the debt / if he know the truth is
as thou haste said bound in conscience to let him go at liberty though he
be not compellable thereto by the law. And therefore admittynge it for this
time / that the law of England in this point is good and just. I pray the
that thou will make answer to my question.


Doctor. I will with good will / and therefore as me seems for as much as it
appears that the said gift was made of the mere liberte and fre will of the
said Johan at noke / and without any recompense that therefore it can not be
otherwise taken / but that the intent of the said Ioha^ at noke as well at the
time of ye said feoffement / as at the time that he received again the said
gift in the tail / was yt if he happened afterward to fall in to poverty
/ that he might alyen the said land to releue him with / for how may it be
though that a man will so much pondre the welthe of his heir / that he will
forget him self / and so it seems that not only the said recouerye stands
with conscience: but also that if he had made only a feoffement of the land
that that feoffement should be in conscience a good bar of the tail / but if
the said feoffement and gift had been made in consideracio^ of any recompense
of money or for any matrimony or such other / than the feoffemente of the said
Johan at noke should not bind his heir / and if he than suffered any recouerye
thereof: than that recouerye should be of like effect as other recoueries
whereof we have treated before / and the which I said it was good to favor
rather for their multitude than for the conscience: and the same law is that
if the son and the heir of the said Johan at noke in case yt the said gift
was made without recompense alyen the land for pouertye after the death of his
father that recouerye byndeth not but as other recoueries do / for it ca^ not
be thought that the intent of the father was that any of his heirs in tail
should for any necessite dissherite all other heirs in tail that should come
after him but for hi^ self me thinks it is reasonable to judge in such manner
as I have said before.


Student. And though the intent of the said Johan at noke when he made the
said feoffement / and when he took again the said gift in tail: were that
if he fell in need that he might alien: yet I suppose that he may not alien
though percase for the more suerte he declared his intent to be such upon the
liveries of season: for that intent was contrary to the gift that he frelye
took upon him: and when any intent or condition is declared or reserved against
the state that any man makes or accepts: than such an intent or condition
is void by the law as by a case that hereafter follows will appear / that is
to say if a man make a feoffement in fee upon condition that the feffe shall
not alien it to any man that condition is void for it is incidente to every
state of the fee simple that he that is so seized may alien. And like as in a
fee simple there is incident a power to aliene / so in a state tail there is a
secret intent understand in the gift / that no alienacion shall be made.

And therefore though the intent of the said Johan at noke were that if he
fell in to poverty that he might sell: and though he at the taking of the
gift openly declared his intent to be so / yet that intent should be void by
the law as me seems and if it be void by the law it is also void in
conscience / and so the said recovery must be taken in this case to be of the
same effect as recoueryes of other lands intayled be / and in none other
manner.


The.iiii. question of the Student / concerning recoueryes of enheritau^ce
entayled. The.xxx. Chapitre.
STudent. If an annuite be granted to a man to have and to perceive to the
grant and to the heirs of his body of the cofers of the grauntour. And after
the grant suffers a recouere against him in a writ of enter by the name
of a rent in dale of like sum as the annuite is of with vouchers and judgment
after ye common course / and both parties intend that yt annuite shall be
recovered: whether shall that recouere bind the heir i^ the tail of his
annuite.


Doctor. what if it were a re^t going out of land of what effect should the
recouere be than.


Student. It should be than of like effect as if it were of land.


Doctoure. And so it seems to be of this annuite / for as me thinks a re^te
and an annuite be of one effect / for the one of them shall be paid in redye
money as the other shall.


Stude^t. That is troth and yet there be many great diversities betwixt them
in the law.


Doctoure. I pray the show me some of tho diversities.


Student. Part I shall show ye / but I wot not whether I can show the al but
first thou shalt understand that one diversity is this. Every rent be it
rent service / rent charge / or re^t seek / is going out of land / but an
annuite goth not out of any land / but charge only the person: that is to
say the grauntoure or his heirs that have assez by discente / or the house if
it be granted by a house of a religion to perceive of their cofers. Also of an
annuyte there lies no accion but only a writ of annuite against the grau^tour
his heirs or successors / and that writ of annuite lies never against the
pernoure: but only against the grauntour or his heirs / but of a rent the
same accions may lie as do of land as the case requires: and it lies
sometime of rent against the tenaunte of the ground / and sometime against the
pernour of the rent / that is to say against him that takes the rent
wrongefully / and sometime against neither: as of a rent service assise may
lie for the lord against the mesme and a dissesoure / or sometime against the
mesne only if he did also the disseason. Also an annuite is never taken for an
asses because it is no freholde in the law / ne it shall not be put in execucion
upon a statute merchant / statute staple ne elegit as rent may. And because
the said writ of enter lay not in this case of this annuite. And that it
can not be ente^ded in the law to be the same annuite / though it be of like
sum with the annuite: ne though ye parties assented and mente to have the same
annuite recovered by the said writ of enter / therefore the said recovery
is void in law and conscience / but if such a recovery be had of rent with
a vouchere over than it shall be taken to be of like effect as recoueries of
lands be in such manner as we have treated of before.


The.v. question of the Student / concerning tayled lands. The.xxxi. Chapitre.
STudent. If lands be given to a man and to his wife in the name of his
ioyntoure by the father of the husband to have and to hold to them and to ye
heirs of their two bodies begotten / and after they have issue and the
husband dies and the wife alieneth the land / and against the statute of.xi.
H. vii. suffers a recouerye thereof to be had against her to the use of the
byer / and after her sone and heir apparaunte / that is heir to the tail
releaseth to the recouerers by fine and dies having a brother on live / and
after the mother dies who has right to that land the byer or the brother of
him that released.


Doctoure. what is thine oppinion therein / I pray the show me.


Student. We seems that the byer has right / for by the said statute made
in the.xi. year of king Henry the.vii. among other things it is enacted that
if any man / which has lands of the gift of her husband / or of the gift
of any of the auncestoures of the husband / suffer any recouerye thereof
against her by couyne / that than such recouerye shall be void / and that it
shall be lawful to him that should have the land after the death of the woman
to enter and it to hold as in his first right / provided always that that
statute shall not extend where he yt should have the land after the death of
the woman is agreeable to any such alienacion or recouerye: so that / that
agremente be of record. And for as much as the heir in this case agreed to
the said recouerye by fine / which is one of the highest records in the law /
it seems that the byer has right against that heir that agreed and
against all that shall be heirs of the tail / and that not only by the said
recovery / but also by the said statute whereby the said recouerye with
assent of the heir is affermed.


Doctor. Though the byer in this case have right during the life of the heir
that released / yet nevertheless after his death his heir as it seems may
lawfully enter / for the agreement whereof the statute speaks must as I suppose
either be had before the recovery / or else at ye time of ye recovery: for if a
title by reason of ye said statute be ones deuolute to the heir in the tail /
than yt right as it seems can not be extincte nor put away by the only fine
of the heir / no more than if he had dyed and the next heir to him had
released to the byer by fine / in which case the release could not extincte
the right of the rail / nor the right of enter that is given by the statute
/ and so as me seems his next heir may therefore enter.


Student. As I perceive all thy dowte is in this case because the assent of the
heir was after the recovery / for if it had been at the time of the
recovery as if the heir had been vouched to warrantye in the same recovery
and he had enterred: and thereupon the Judgment had be given thou agreest well
/ yt that recouerye should have avoided the tail for ever.


Doctoure. That is true for it is in the express words of the statute / but
when the assente is after the recouerye / than me thinks it is not so / ne yt
the right of the first tail / which was reuyed by the said statute shall
not be extincte by his fine / no more than it shall in other tails.


Student. I will be advised upon thy opinion in this matter / but yet one thing
would I move ferther upon this statute and that is this. Some say that by this
statute all other recoueries that have been had / over and beside these
recoueries of (...) be affermed / for they say that sith the parliament at the
maki^g of this statute / knew well that many other recoueries were than used
and had to defete tails and that it was like yt they would so continue / which
nevertheless the parliament did not prohibit for the time to come as it did
the said recoueries of ioyntours: that it is therefore to suppose that they
thought that they should stand with law and conscience: but because
iointoures were made rather for the saving of the inheritance of the husband
/ than to destroy the inheritance / they say that the parliament thought and
adiuged the alienacions and recoueries of such ioyntours to be against the
law and conscience and not the alienacion of other lands entayled / for if
they had they say / that the parliament would have aduoyded recoueries of
tayled lands generally as well as it did of recoueries of ioyntoures.


Doctoure. As to that opinion I will answer the thus for this time / that
though that the makers of the said estatute only put away recoueries of
ioyntoures / and not other recoueries that yet it can not be taken therefore
that their intent was that the other recoueries should stand good and perfect
/ for they speak tha^ only of ioyntours because there was no complaynte made
in the parliament at yt time / but against recoueries had of ioyntours / and
therefore it seems that they intended nothing concerning other recoueries:
but that they should be of the same effect as they were before and no
otherwise. And that will appear more plainly thus / though the makers of the
said estatute intended to put away and adnull such recoueries as should be
made of ioyntours after a certain day limited in the statute / that yet they
intended not to aduoyde ne afferme such recoueries of ioyntours as were passed
before that time: and if they intended not to aduoyde ne afferme the recoueries
had of ioyntoures before that time: than how can it be taken that they
intended to put away or afferme other recoueries that were passed before that
time and not of ioyntours / that would not afferme ne put away recoueries
passed of ioyntoures before that time And so as it seems they intended to
spare the multitude of them that were passed of both and not to comfort any
to take them after that time.


Student. I am content thy oppinion stand for this time / and I will ask the
another question.


The.vi. question of the Student / concerning tayled lands. The.xxxii.
Chapitre.
STudent. If tenant in tail be disseased / and dye and an auncestre
collateral to the heir in tail release with a warrauntye and dye / and the
warra^tye descends upon the heir in the tail / whether is he thereby barred
in conscience / as he is in the law.


Doctor. Because our principal intent at this time is to speak of recoueries
and not of warra^ties: and also because it has been of long time taken for a
principal maxim of the law yt it should be a bar to ye heir as well yt
claymeth by a fee simple as by a state tayly / and for that also that it was
not put away by the said statute of westminster the.i. which ordained the
tail I will not at this time make the an answer then / but will take a respite
to be advised.


Student. Than I pray the yet or we depart show me what was the most
principal cause that moved the so move this question of recoueries had of
tayled lands.


Doctor. This moved me thereto / I have perceived many times that there be
many diverse oppinions of those recoueries: whether they stand with conscience
or not / and that it is to dowte that many persons re^ into offense of
conscience thereby. And therefore I thought to feel thy mind in them whether I
could perceive that it were clear / that they served to break the tail in
law and conscience / or that it were clearly against conscience so to break
the the tail / or that it were a matter in dowt and if it appeared a matter in
dowte / or yt it appeared that the matter were used clearly against conscience
/ than I thought to do somewhat to make the matter appear as it is to the
intent: that they that have the rewle and the charge over the people as well
the spiritual men as temporal men / should the rather endeuer them to se it
reformed for the commonwealth of the people / as well in body as in soul. For
when any thing is used to the displesure of god / it hurreth not only the
body but also the soul. And te^porall rewlers have not only cure of the
bodies / but also of the souls / and shall answer for them if they perysshe
i^ their defaute: and because it seems by the more apparaunt reason that the
tails be not broken ne fully avoided by the said recoueries / and that yet
nevertheless the great multitude of the^ that be passed is right much to be
pondered Therefore it were very good to prohibit them for time to come / to
put away such ambiguities and dowtes as rise now by occasion of the said
recoueries / and so they be but as snares to deceive the people / and so will
they be as long as they be suffered to continue. And me thinks verily that
it were therefore right expedient that tayled lands should from hensforthe
either be made so strong in the law that the tail should not be broken by
recovery fine with proclamacion collateral warrantye nor otherwise / or else
that all tayls should be made fee simple / so that every man that list to sell
his land might sell it by his bare feoffement and without any scriple or
gruge of conscience: and tha^ there should not be so great expenses in the law
nor so great variaunce among the people: ne yet so great offense of
conscience as there is now in many persons.


Student. Verily me thinks that thy oppinion is right good and charitable in
this behalf. And that the rewlers be bound in conscience to look well upon it
to se it reformed and brought in to good order And verily by that thou haste
said therein thou haste brought me in to remembrance that there be diverse
like snares concerning spiritual matters suffered among the people / whereby
I dowte that many spiritual rewlers be in great offense against god. As it
is of that point that the spiritual men have spoken so much of that priests
should not be put to answer before lay men specially of felonies and
murders / and of the statute of xlv. E. iii. the.iii. chapitre / where it is
said that a prohibicion shall lie / where a man is sued in the spiritual
court for tithe of wood / that is above the age of.xx. year / by the name of
Silua cedua as it has done before / and they have in open Sermons and in
diverse other open communicacio^s and counsayles causes it to be openly
notefied and known that they should be all accursed that put priests to
answer / or that maynteyne the said estatute / or any other like to it. And
after wha^ they have right well perceived that not withstanding all that they
have done therein / it has been used in the same poi^tes through all the realm
in like manner as it was by fore. Than they have sit still and let the
matter pass / and so when they have brought many persons in great danger /
but most specially them that have given credence to their saying / and yet by
reason of the old custom have done as they did before / than there they have
let the^ / but verily it is to fear that there is to themself right great
offense thereby / that is for to say to s^ so many i^ so great danger as they
say they be. And to do no more to bring them out of it than they have done for
if it be true as they say / they ought to stick to it with effect in all
charity till it were reformed. And if it be not as they say tha^ they have
caused many to offend that have given crede^ce to them / and yet countrary to
their own conscience do as they did before / and that percase should not have
offended if such saynges had not ben. And so it seems that they have i^ these
matters done either to much or to libel And I beseech all mighty god that some
good man may so call upon all these matters that we have now co^moned of / so
yt they that be in auctorite may somewhat pondre them / and to order them in
such manner that offense of conscience grow not so lightly thereby hereafter
as it has done in time paste. And verily he that on the cross knew the
price of man's soul will hereafter ask a right strayte account of rewlers
for every soul that is under them and that shall perysshe through their
defaulte.


Addition.
THus I have showed unto the i^ this little Dialoge how the law of England is
grounded upon the law of reason the law of god / the general customs of the
realm / and upon certain principles that be called maxims upon the
particular customs used in diverse Cities and countries / and upon statutes
which have been made in diverse parliamentes by our soue rain lord the king
and his progenitoures / and by the lords spiritual and temporal / and all
the commons of the realm.

And I have also showed the in the.ix. chapitre of this book / under what manner
the said general customs and maxims of the law may be proved and affermed
if they were denied / and diverse other things be contained in this present
Dialoge / which will appear in the table / that is in the latter end of the
book / as to the reders will appear. And in the end of the said Dialoge I have
at thy desire showed the my co^ceyte concerni^ge recoueries of tayled lands /
and thou haste upon the said recoueries showed me thine oppinion. And I
beseech our lord set them shortelye in a good clear way / for surely it will
be right expediente for the well ordrynge of conscience in many persons that
they be so. And thus god of peace and love be always with us. Amen.

The second dyalogue in english / between a doctor of diuynyte and a
student in the laws of England / newly corrected and imprinted with new
addycions.

HEre after follows the Second dyaloge in englisshe between a doctor of
divinity and a student in the law of England. In the beginning of which
dyalogue the doctor answers to certain questions / which the student made
to the doctoure before the making of this dyalogue concerning the laws of
England and conscience / as appears in a dyalogue made between them in latin
the 24. chap. And he answers also to diverse other questions that the stude^t
makes to him in these dyaloge of the law of England and conscience. And in
diverse other chapiters of this present dyalogue is touched shortly / how the
laws of England are to be observed and kept in this realm / as to temporal
things as well in law as in conscience before any other laws. And in some of
the chapitres thereof is also touched that spiritual Iuges in diverse cases be
bound to give their iugeme^tes according to the kings law. And in the later
end of the book the doctoure moves diverse cases concerning the laws of
England / wherein he douteth how they may stand with conscience / whereunto the
student makes answer in such manner as to the reder will appear.

The introductyon.
STudent. In the later end of our first dyalogue i^ latin / I put diverse
cases grounded upon the laws of England / wherein I douted and yet do what is
to be holden therein in conscience. But for as much as the time was than far
paste / I showed the that I would not desire the to make answer to the^
forthwith at that time / but at some better leyser: whereunto thou saydest thou
would not only show thine opinyon in tho cases / but also in such other
cases as I would put. wherefore I pray the now (for as much as me thinkethe
thou haste good leyser) that thou will show me thine opinyon therein.


Doctor. I will with good will acomplysshe thy desire: but I would that when I
am in doubt what the law of this realm is in such cases as thou shalt put /
that thou will show me what the law is therein: for though I have by occasyon
of our first dyalogue in latin / learned many things of the laws of this
realm / which I knew not before: yet nevertheless there be many mo things
that I am yet ignorant in / and that peraue^ture in these self cases that thou
haste put / and entendest here after to put: and as I said in the first
dyalogue in latin / the.xx. chapyter / to search conscience upon any case of
the law / it is in vain / but where the law in the same case is perfytely
known.


Student. I will with good will do as thou say / and I entende to put diverse
of the same questyons that be in the last chapter of the said dyalogue in
latin: and sometime I entende to alter some of them and to add some new
questyons to them / such as I shall be most in doubt of.


Doctor. I pray the do as thou say / and I shall with good will either make
answer to them forthwith as well as I can / or shall take longer respyte to be
aduysed / or else perauenture agree to thine opinyon therein / as I shall se
cause. But first I would gladly know the cause why thou have begone this
dyalogue in the english tongue / and not in the latin tongue / as the first
cases that thou desyredest to know mine opinyon be in / or in french as the
substance of the law is.


Student. The cause is this. It is right necessary to all men in this realm /
both spiritual and temporal for the good orderi^ge of their conscience to
know many things of the law of England that they be ignorant in. And
though it had been more pleasant to them that be learned in the latyne tongue to
have had it in latyne rather than in english: yet nevertheless for as much
as many can read english that understand no latin / and some that can not
read english: by heri^ge it read may learn diverse things by it that they
should not have learned if it were in latin. Therefore for the profit of the
multitude it is put into the english tongue rather than into the latin or
french tongue. For if it had been in french: few should have understand it /
but they that be learned in the law / and they have lest need of it / for as
much as they know the law in the same cases without it / and can better declare
what conscience will thereupon / than they that know not the law nothi^ge at
all. To them therefore that be not learned i^ the law of the realm this
treatice is specially made / for thou know well by such studyes thou haste
taken to some knowledge of the law of the realm that is to them most expedient.


Doctoure. It is true that thou say and therefore I pray the now proceed to
thy questions.


The first question of the Student The first chapitre.
STtudent. If tenant in tail after possibility of issue extincte do wast /
whether does he thereby offend in conscience though he be not punysshable of
waste by the law.


Doctoure. Is the law clear that he is not punysshable for the waste?


Stude^t. ye verily.


Doct. And what is the law of tenantes for tme of life or for tme of years if
they do waste.


Student. They be punysshable of wast by the statute and shall yield treble
damages / but at the common law before that statute they were not punysshable.


Doctor. But whether thynkest thou that before that statute they might have
done waste with conscience because they were not punysshable by the law?


Stude^t. I think not / for as I take it: the doing of the wast of such
particular tenantes for term of life / for term of years / or of tenantes in
dower / or by the curtesye: is prohibit by the law of reason / for it seems
of reason that when such leases be made / or that such tytles in dower or by
the curtesy be given by ye law that there is only given unto them the annual
profits of the land and not the houses and trees and the grauel to dygge and
carry away / whereby the hole profit of them in the reuercion should be taken
away for ever. And therefore at the common law for waste done by tenant in dower
or tenant by the curtesy there was punyssheme^t ordained by the law by a
prohibicion of waste whereby they should have yielded damages to the value of the
waste. But against tenant for term of life or for tme of years lay no such
prohibicion / for there was no maxim i^ the law therein against them as there
was against the other. And I think the cause was for as much as it was iuged
a folly in the lessour that made such a lease for term of life / or for term
of years: that at the time of the lessee he did not prohibit them that they
should not do waste / and sithe he did not provide no remedy for him self:
the law would none provide. But yet I think not that the intent of the law
was that they might lawfully and with good conscience do waste / but against
tenantes in dower and by the curtesye the law provided remedy for they had
their title vy the law.


Do. And verily me thinks that this tenant in tail as to doing of waste /
should be like to a tenant for term of life / for he shall have the land no
longer than for term of his life: no more tha^ a tenant for term of life
shall / and the waste of this tenant is as great hurt to him in the reuercion
or remayndre / as is the waste of a tenant for term of life: and if he alyene
/ the donoure shall enter for the forfeyture as he shall upon the alyenacion of
a tenant for term of life / and if he make defaute in a Precipe quod reddat:
the donour shall be received as he shall be upon the defaute of a tenant for term
of life / and therefore me thinks he shall also be punysshable of wast / as
tenant for term of life shall.


Student. If he alyen: the donour shall enter / as thou say because that
alyenacion is to his disheritance / and therefore it is a forfeyture of his
estate: and that is by an ancient maxim of the law that gives that
forfeyture in that self case / and if he make defaute in a Prec^. quod redd:
he in the reuercion / as thou say shall be received / but that is by the
statute of West.ii. for at the common law there was no such receyt / and as for
the statute that gives the accion of waste against a tenant for term of life
and for term of years it is a statute penal and shall not be taken by equite
/ and so there is no remedy given against him / neither by common law nor by
statute / as there is against tenant for term of life / and therefore he is
vnpunysshable of waste by the law.


Doctor. And though he be vnpunysshable of waste by the law: yet
nevertheless me thinks he may not by conscience do that / that shall be
hurtefull to the inheritance after his time / sithe he has the land but for
term of his life no more than a tenaunte for term of life may / for than he
should do as he would not be done to / for thou agreest thy self that though
a tenant for term of life was not punysshable of wast before the statute that
yet the law iuged not that he might ryghtfully and with good conscience do
wast. And therefore at this day if a feffement be made to the use af a man for
term of life / though there lie no accion against him for waste / yet he
offends conscience if he do waste as the tenaunte for term of life did
before the statute when no remedy lay against him by the law.


Stud. That is true / but there is great diversity between this tenant and a
tenant for term of life: for this tenant has good authorite by the donour to
do waste / and so has not the tenaunte for term of life / as it is said
before. For the estate of a tenant in tail after possibilite of issue
extyncte is in this manner. When lands be given to a man and to his wife and to
the heirs of their two bodies begotten / and after the one of them dies
without heirs of their bodies begotten / than he or she that ouerlyueth / is
called tenant in tail after possibilite of issue extyncte / because there can
never by no possibilite be any heir that may inheryte by force of that gift.
And thus it apereth yt the donees at the time of the gift: received of the
donour estate of enheritance / which by possibilite might have continued for
ever / whereby they had power to cut down trees and to do all thing that is
wast / as tenant i^ fee simple might and that authorite was as strong in the
law as if the lessour that makes a lease for term of life say by express
words in the lease that the less shall not be punysshable of waste. And
therefore if the donour in this case had granted to the donees that they should
not be punisshable of wast that grant had been void because it was included in
the gift before as it should be upon a gift in fe simple: and so for as much
as by the first gift and by the lyuere of season made upon the same: the
donees had authorite by the donour to do waste. Therefore though the one of the
donees be now deed without issue / so that it is certain that after the death
of the other: the land shall reuerte to the donour / yet the authorite that
they had by the donour to do waste: continues as long as the gift and the
lyuerey of season made upon the same continues: and I take this to be the
reason why he shall not have in aid as tenant for term of life shall / that is
to say / for that he can not ask help of that maxim / whereby it is ordained
that a tenant for term of life shall have in aid / for he can not say but yt
he took a greater estate by the lyuerey of season that was made to him: which
yet continues than for term of life / and so I think him not bound to make
any restitucion to him in the reuercion in this case for the waste.


Do. Is thy mind only to prove that these tenant is not bound to make
restitucion to him in the reuercion for the waste: or that thou thynkest that
he may with clear conscience do all manner of wast.


Stud. I entende to prove no more but that he is not bound to restitucion to
him in the reuercion.


Do. Than I will right well agree to thyn oppinion for the reason that thou
haste made / but if thy mind had been to have proved that he might with clear
conscience have done all manner of waste: I would have thought the contrary
thereto / and that the tenant in fee simple may not do all manner of waste and
destruction with conscience / as to pull down houses and make pastures of
cities and towns / or to do such other acts which be against the common
welthe. And therefore some will say that tenant in fee simple may not with
conscience destroy his wodes and cole pyttes whereby a hole country for their
money have had fuel. And yet though he do so he is not bound by conscience to
make restitucion to no person in certain. But now I pray the or thou proceed
to the second case: that thou will somewhat show me what thou meanest when
thou say: at the common law it was thus or thus: I understand not fully
what thou meanest by that tme at the common law.


Stud. I shall with good will show the what I mean thereby.


What is meant by this term when it is said / thus it was at the common law.
The second chapitre.
STudent. The common law is taken three manner of ways. First it is taken as the
law of this realm of England disceyuered from all other laws / and under
this manner taken. It is oftentimes argued in the laws of England what matters
ought of right to be determined by the common law / and what by the admiralles
court or by the spiritual court. And also if an obligacion bear date out of
the realm / as in Spain / France / or such other It is said in the law and
truth it is that they be not pledable at the common law.

Secondely the common law is taken as the kings courts of his benche or of
the common place / and it is so taken when a ple is removed out of auncien
demean for that the land is frank fee and pledable at the common law / that
is to say in the kings court and not in ancien demean. And under this manner
taken / it is ofte^tymes pleaded also in base courts as in court Barons / the
Contie and the court of Pypouders and such other that this matter or that.
etc^. ought not to be determined in that court but at the common law / that is
to say in the kings courts. etc^. Thyrdely by the common law is understand
such things as were law before any statute made in that point that is in
question: so that / that point was holden for law by the general or particular
customs and maxims of the realm or by the law of reason and the law of
god: no other law added to them by statute nor otherwise / as i^ the case
before rehearsed in the first chapitre: where it is said that at the common
law tenante by the curtesy and tenant in dower were punysshable of waste /
that is to say / that before any statute of waste made they were punysshable of
waste by the ground and maxims of the law used before the statute made in
that point / but tenant for term if life ne for term of years were not
punysshable by the said grounds and maxims till by the statute remedy was
given against them: and therefore it is said that at the common law they were
not punysshable of waste.


Doc. I pray the now proceed unto the second question.


The second question of the student. The third chapitre.
STudent. If a man be outlawed and never had knowledge of ye suit / whether may
the king take all his goods and reteyne them in conscience as he may by the
law.


Docour. What is the reason why they be forfeyted by the law in that case.


Stud. The very reason is for that it is an old custume and an old maxim in
the law: that he that is outlawed shall forfeyte his goods to the king / and
the cause why that maxim began was this. Wha^ a man had done a trespace to
another or an other offense wherefore process of outlagary lay / and he that
the offense was done to had taken an accion against him according to the law /
if he had absented him self and had had no lands: there had been no remedy
against him: for after the law of England no man shall be condemned without
answer / or that he appear and will not answer / except it be by reason of
any statute. Therefore for the punisshement of such offenders as would not
appear to make answer and to be justified in the kings court / it has been
used without time of mind / that an attacheme^t in that case should be
directed against him returnable into the kings benche or the common place /
and if it were returned there upon that he had naught whereby he might be
attached that than should go forth a Capias to take his person / and after an
alias Capias / and than a Pluries: and if it were returned upon every of the
said Capias that he could not be found and he appeared not: than should an
Exige^t be dyrected against him which should have so long day of return /
that five cou^ties might be holden before the return thereof and in every of
the said five conties the defendant to be solemlye called: and if he appeared
not / than for his contumacy and disobedience of the law: the coroners to give
judgment that he shall be outlawed / whereby he shall forfeyt his goods to the
king and lose diverse other advantages in the law y needs not here to be
remembered now. And so because he was in this case called according to the
law and appeared not: it seems that the king has good title to the goods
both in law and conscience.


Doctoure. If he had knowelege of the suit in very deed it seems the king
has good title in conscience as thou say. But if he had no knowledge thereof:
it seems not so / for the defaut that is adiuged in hi^ (as it appears by
thine own reason) is his contumacie and disobedience of the law / and if he
were ignorant of the suit / than can there ben assigned in him no disobedience
/ for a disobedience implies a knowelege of that he should have obeyed unto.


Student. It seems i^ this case that he should be compelled to take knowledge
of the suit at his peril / for sithe he has attempted to offe^de the law:
it seems reason that he shall be compelled to take heed what the law will do
against him for it / and not only that: but that he should rather offer
amends for his trespass than for to tarry till he were sued for it. And so it
seems the ignorance of the suit is of his own defaute / specially sith i^
the law is set such order that every man may know if he will what suit is
taken against him / and may se the records thereof when he will / and so it
seems that neither the party nor the law be not bounden to give him no
knowledge therein. And over this I would somewhat move ferther in this matter thus
That though the accio^ were untrue / and the defendau^t not gylthy / that yet
the goods be forfeyted to the king for his not apparau^ce in law and also in
conscience / and that for this cause / the king as souereyne and head of the
law is bounden of justice to grant such writtes and such processes as be
oppoynted in the law to every person that will complain: be his surmyse true
or false / and there upon the king (of justice) owes as well to make process
to bring the defendaunt to answer wha^ he is not gyltye as when he is gyltie /
and tha^ wha^ there is no maxim in the law that if a man be outlawed in such
manner as before appears that he shall forfayte all his goods to the king /
and makes no excepcio^ whether the accio^ be true or untrue / it seems that
the said maxim more regards the general ministracion of justice: than the
particular right of the party: and that therefore the property by the outlawry
and by the said maxim ordained for ministracion of justice is altered and is
given to the king as before appears / and that both in law and conscience as
well as if the accion were true. And than the pertie that is so outlawed is
driven to sue for his remedy against him that has so caused him to be
outlawed upon an untrue accio^


Doct. If he have not sufficient to make recompense or dye before recouere can
be had / what remedy is than.


Student. I think no remedy / and for a ferther declaracion in this case and
in such other like cases where the property of goods may be altered without
asse^t of the owner: it is to co^sydre that the property of goods be not
given to the owners directly by the law of reason nor by the law of god but by
the law of man / and is suffered by the law of reason and by the law of god so
to be. For at the beginning al goods were in common / but after they were
brought by the law of man into a certain property so that every man might
know his own: and tha^ when such property is given by the law of man the
same law may assign such co^dicio^s upon the property as it lysteth / so
they be not against the law of god ne the law of reason / and may lawfully
take away that it gives / and appoint how long the property shall continue.
And one co^dicio^ that goes with every property i^ this realm: is if he that
has the property be outlawed according to such process as is ordained by the
law / that he shall forfayte the property unto the king / and diverse other
cases there be also: where by property in goods shall be altered in the law and
the right in lands also without assente of the owner / whereof I shall shortly
touch some without laynge any aucthorite therein / for the more shortness. First
by a sale in open marked the property is altered. Also goods stolen and
seized for the king or weyued be forfaite oneles appelle or enditement be
sued. Also strayes if they be proclaimed and be not after claymed by the owner
within the year be forfayte / and also a deodand is forfayte to whom so ever
the property was before / except it belonged to the king and shall be disposed
for the soul of him that was slain therewith: and a fine with a nonclayme at
the common law was a bar if claim were not made within a year as it is now
by statute if the clay We be not made within.v. years. And al these forfaytures
were ordained by the law upon certain consideracions which I omit at this
time / but certain it is that none of the^ was made upon a better
co^sideracion than this forfayture of outlagary was. For if no especial
punissheme^t should have been ordained for offenders that would absent them
self and not appear when they were sued in the kings courts many suits in
the kings courts should have been of small effect. And sithe this maxim was
ordained for the execucion of Justice and as much done therein by the common
law as policy of man could reasonably devise to make the party have
knowelege of the suit and now is added thereto by the statute made the syxte
year of king Hnry the.viii. that a writ of proclamacion shall be sued if the
party be dwelling in a another shyre / it seems that such title as is given
to the king thereby is good in conscience / especially seeing that the king is
bounden to make process upon the surmyse of the playntyfe and may not examine
but by the ple of the party whether the surmyse be true or not. But if the
party be returned.v. times called where in deed hf was never called as in the
second case oe the last Chapitre of the said dialogue i^ latyne is contained
/ than it seems the party shall have good remedy by petition to the king /
specially if he that made the return be not sufficient to make recompense or
dye before recouere can be had.


Doct. Now sith I have herd thine opinion in this case whereby it appears
that many things must be seen or a full and a plain declaracion can be made
in this behalf / and seeing also that the plain answer to this case shall
give a great light to diverse other cases that may come by such forfeyture. I
pray the give me a ferther respyte or that I show the my full opinion therein /
and here after I shall right gladly do it.

And therefore I pray the proceed now to some other case.


The third question of the student. The fourth Chapitre.
STudent. If a stranger do waste in lands that a another holds for term of
life without assent af the tenant for term of life: wether may he in the
reuercion recover treble damages and the place wasted against the tenant for
term of life according to the statute in conscience as he may by the law: if
the stranger be not sufficient to make recompense for the wast done.


Doctoure. Is the law clear in this case that he in the reuercion shall recover
against the tenant for term of life though that he assented not to the doing
of the wast.


Student. ye verily / and yet if the tenant for term of life had been bounden
in an obligacion in a certain su^me of money that he should do no waste: he
should not forfayt his bo^de by the wast of a stranger / and the diversity is
this. It has been used as an ancient maxim in the law that tenant by the
curtesy and tenant in dower should take the land with this charge / that is to
say / that they should do no waste them self ne suffer none to be done / and
when an accion of wast was given after against a tenant for term of life:
tha^ was he taken to be in the same case as to that point of waste as tenant
by the curtesy and tenant in dower was / that is to say / that he should do
no waste nor suffer none to be done / for there is a another maxim in the law
of England that all cases like unto other cases shall be iuged aft the same law
as the other cases be and sith no reso^ of diversity can be assigned why thete
na^t for term of life after an accio^ of wast was given against hi^ should have
any more favor i^ the law tha^ the tenant by the courtesy or tenant i^ dower
should / therefore be is put vnd the same maxim as they be / that is to say /
that he shall do no wast ne suffer none to be done / and so it semethe that the
law in this case does not considre the abilite of the person that does the
waste whether he be able to make recompense for the wast or not. But the assent
of the said tenauntes whereby they have wylfully taken upon the^ the charge to
se that no wast shall be done.


Doctor. I have herd that if houses of these tenauntes be destroyed with
sodeyne tempest or with strange enemies that they shall not be charged with
wast.


Student. Truth it is.


Doct. And I think the reason is because they can have no recouere over.


Student. I take not that for the reason: but that it is an old reasonable
maxim i^ the law that they should be discharged i^ those cases / how be it
some will say that in those cases the law of reason does discharge them and
therefore they say that if a statute were made that they should be charged in
those cases of wast that the statute were against reason and not to be observed
/ but yet nevertheless I take it not so / for they might refuse to take such
estate if they would / and if they will take the state after the law made: it
seems reasonable that they take it with the charge and with the condition that
is appointed thereto by the law though hurt might follow to the^ afterward
thereby / for it is oftentimes seen i^ the law that the law does suffer him to
have hurt without help of the law that will wylfully run into it of his
own act not compelled thereto and aiugeth it is folly so to run into it /
for which folly he shall also be many times without remedy in conscience. As
if a man take lands for term of life and byndeth him self by obligacion that
he shall leave the land in as good case as he found it / if the houses be
after blowe^ down with tempest or destroyed with strange enemies as in the
case that thou have put before he shall be bound to repair them or else he shall
forfayte his obligacio^ in law and conscience because it is his own act to
bind hi^ to it / and yet the law would not have bound him thereto as thou
have said before. So me thi^keth that the cause why the said tenauntes be
discharged in the law in an accion of wast wha^ the houses be destroyed by
sodeyne tempest or by strange enemies: is by a special reasonable maxim in
the law / whereby they be excepted fro the other general bond before reherced
/ that is to say they shall at their peril se that no waste shall be done and
not by the law of reason / and sith there is no maxim in this case to help
this tenant ne that he can not be helped by the law of reason / it seems
that he shall be charged in this case by his own act both in law and
conscience whether the stranger be able to recompense him or not.


Doctor. I doubt i^ this case whether the maxim that thou spekest of be
reasonable or not / that is to say / that tenauntes by the curtesye and
tenauntes in dower were bounden by the common law law that they should do no
waste them self / and over that at their peril to se that no waste should be
done by none other. For that law seems not reasonable that byndeth a man to
an impossibilite. And it is impossible to prevent that no wast shall be done by
strangers / for it may be suddenly done i^ the night that the tenau^tes can
have no notice of / or by great power that they be not able to resyste / and
therefore me thi^keth they ought not to be charged in those cases for the waste
/ without they may have good remedy over. and tha^ percase the said maxim were
sufferable / and else my thinks it is maxim against reason.


Stude^t. As I have said before no man shall be compelled to take that bo^de upon
him but he that will take the land and if he will take the land: it is reason
he take the charge as the law has appointed with it / and tha^ if any hurt
grow to him thereby: it is through his own act and his own assent / for he
might have refused the lease if he would.


Doctoure. Though a man may refuse to take estate for term of life or for
term of years / and a woman may refuse to take her dower: yet tenant by the
curtesy can not refuse to take his estate for immedeatly after the death of his
wife: the possession abides still i^ him by the act of the law without enter
/ and tha^ I put the case that after the death of his wife he would weyue the
possession and after wast were done by a stranger: whether thi^kest thou that
he should answer to the wast


Stu. I think he should by the law.


Doct. And how stands that with reason / seeing there is no defaut i^ hi^.


Stu. It was his defaut / and at his own peril that he would marye an
enheritrice whereupon such danger might follow.


Doc. I put case that he were within age at the marriage or that the land
disce^ded to his wife aft he married her.


Stu. there thou mouest a (...) doubt than the first question is / and though
it were as thou say / yet thou cannest not say but that there is as great
defaut in hi^ as is in him in the reuercion / and that there is as great reason
why he should be charged with the waste as that he in the reuercion should be
disherited and have no manner remedy ne yet no profytte of the land as the
other has / and though he said maxim may be thought very streyt to the said
tenauntes: yet is it for to be favored as much as may be reasonably / because
it helps much the common welthe / for it hurts the common welthe greatly
when wodes and houses ben destroyed / and if they should answer for no waste /
but for waste done by them self there might be waste done by strangers by
their commandment or assent in such colorable manner that they i^ the
reuercion should never have proof of their assent.


Doctoure. I am content thine opinion stand for this time / and I pray the
now proceed to a another question.


The fourth question of the student. The.v. Chapitre.
STudente. If he that is the very heir be certified by the ordinary bastard:
and after bring an accion as heir against an other person / whether may any
man knowing the truth be of counsel with the tenant and plede the said
certificate against the demaundaunt by conscience or not.


Doctoure. Is the law in this case that al other against whom the demaundaunt
has title shall take advantage of this certificate as well as he at whose
suit he is certified bastard.


Student. ye verily / and that for two causes / where of the one is this. There
is an old maxim in the law that a mischyfe shall be rather suffered tha^ an
inconuenie^ce / and than in this case if a another writ should afterward be
sent to a another bysshope i^ an other accion to certify wether he were
bastard or not / peradventure that bysshope would certify that he were mulier
/ that is to say lawfully begotten and than he should recover as heir / and so
he should in one self court be taken as mulier and bastard / for avoiding of
which contrariosyte: the law will suffer no mo wrytes to go forth in that
case / and suffers also all men to take advantage of that certificate rather
tha^ to suffer such a contradicion in the court which in the law called an
inconuenie^ce / and the other cause is because this certificate of the bysshope
is the highest trial that is i^ the law i^ this behalf. But this is not
understand but where bastardy is laid in one that is perty to the wryt / for
if bastardy be laid in one that is estra^ge to the writ as i^ a vouch pray en
aid or such other / than that bastardy shall be tried by.xii. me^ by which
trial he i^ whom the bastardy is laid shall not be concluded because he is
not prive to the trial and may have no attai^t / but he that is perty to the
issue may have attaint / and therefore he shall be concluded and none other but he
and for as much as the said maxim was or deyned to eschew an inco^uenie^cy
(as before appears) it seems that every man learned: may with conscience plede
the said certificate for auoydyng thereof / and give cou^saill therein to the
perty according unto the law for else the said inco^uenie^cy must nedely
follow. But yet nevertheless I do not mean thereby that the party may after when
he has barred the demau^da^t by the said certificate retain the land in
conscience by reason of the said certificate / for though there be no law to
co^pel him to restore it / yet I think well that in conscience he is bound to
restore it / if he know that the demaundau^t is the very true heir: whereof I
have put diverse cases like in the.xvii. chapi. of our first dialogue i^ latin:
but my intent is that a man learned i^ the law i^ this case and other like may
with conscience give his counsel according to the law in auoydyng of such
things as the law think it should for a reasonable cause be eschewed.


Doc. Though he that does not know whether he be bastard or not may give his
counsel and also plede the said certificate: yet I think that he that does
know him self to be the very true heir may not plede it / and that is for
two causes. Whereof the one is this. Every man is bound by the law of reason
to do as he would be done to / but I think that if he that pledeth that
certificate were in like case: he would think that no man knowing the said
certificate to be untrue might with conscience plede it against hi^ / wherefore
no more may he plede it against none other. The other cause is this / although
the certificate be pleded: yet is the tenant bounden in conscience to make
restitucion thereof as thou have said thy self / and tha^ in case that he would
not make restitucion / than he that pleads the plee: should run thereby in
like offense / for he has helped to set the other man in such a liberty that
he may chose whether he will restore the land or not / and so he should put him
self to the ieoparty of a another man's conscience. And it is written
Ecclesiasti.iii. Qui amat periculum: peribit in illo. That is / he that
wylfully will put hi^ self in ieoparty to offend: shall perysshe therein / and
therefore it is the surest way to eschew perils / fro him that knows that he
is heir: not to plede it / and as for the inconvenience that thou say must
nedely follow but the certificate be pleded: as to that it may be answered that
it may be pleded by some other that knows not that he is very heir / and if
the case be so far put that there is none other learned there but he: than me
thinks that he shall rather suffer the said inconvenience than to hurt his
own conscience / for always charity begins at him self and so every man
ought to suffer all other offenses rather than he him self should offend. And
now that in this case I pray the proceed to thou know mine opinion a another
question.


The.v. question of the student. The.vi. Chapitre.
STudent. Whether may a man with conscience be of counsel with the playntyfe
in an accion of the common law knowing that the defendaunt has sufficient
matter in conscience whereby he may be discharged by a Sub pena in the chau^cery
which he can not plead at the common law or not.


Doctoure. I pray the put a case thereof in certain for else the question is
very general.


Student. I will put the same case that thou put i^ our first dialogue in
latyne the.x. Chapitre. that is to say / if a man bound in an obligacion / pay
the money and takes none acquitaunce so that by the common law he shall be
compelled to pay the money agyne for such co^sideracion as appears in the.xv.
chapitre of the said dialogue where it is showed evidently how the law in
that case is made upon a good reasonable ground much necessary for all the
people / how be it that a man may sometime through his own defaut take hurt
thereby / wherein I pray the show me thine opinion


Doctoure. this case seems to be like to the case that thou haste put next
before this / and that he that knows the payment to be made does not as he
would be done to if he give counsel that an accion should be taken to have it
paid again.


Sudent. If he be sworn to give counsel according to the law as
sergeauntes at the law be: it seems he is bound to give counsel according
to the law / for else he should not perform his oath.


Doctor. In those words (according to the law) is understand the law of
god and the law of reason: as well as the law and customs of the realm /
for as thou have said thy self i^ our first dialogue in latin that the law of
god and the law of reason be two especial grounds of the laws of England.
Wherefore as me thi^keth he may give no counsel (saving his oath) neither
against the law of god nor the law of reason / and certain it is that this
article that is to say / that a man shall do as he would done to: is grounded
upon both the said laws. And first that it is grounded upon the law of
reason: it is evident of it self. And in the.vi. Chap. of saint Luke it is
said. Et prout vultis vt faciant vobis homines: et vos facite illis similiter.
That is to say / all that ye will that other men should do to you: do you to
them / and so it is grounded upon the law of god / wherefore: if he should give
counsel again the defendau^t in that case: he should do against both the
said laws.


Stu. If the defendaunt had none other remedy but at the common law: I would
agree well it were as thou say / but in this case he may have good remedy
by a Sub pena / and this is the way that shall induce hi^ directly to his Sub
pena / that is to say / wha^ it appears that the playntyfe shall recover by the
law.


Doc. Though the defe^da^t may be discharged by Sub pena / yet the bryngyng i^
of his profes there will be to the charge of the defe^da^t / and also the
profes may dye or they come in. Also there is a ground i^ the law of reason /
quoth nihil possimus co^tra veritatem / that is / we may do nothing against the
troth / and sith he knowethe it is truth that the money is paid he may do
nothing against the troth and if he should be of co^sayle with the plai^tyf he
must suppose and auerre that it is the verey due det of the plai^tyfe / and
that the defe^dau^t withholdeth it fro hi^ unlawfully / which he knows hi^
self to be untrue / wherefore he may not with conscience i^ this case be of
counsel with the plai^tyfe / knowing that the plai^tyf is paid al ready /
wherefore if thou be contented with this answer I pray the proceed to some
other question.


Stud. I will with good will.


The.vii. question of the student. The.vii. Chapitre.
STudent. A man makes a feoffement to the use of him and of his heirs / and
after the feoffour puts in his beestes to manure the ground and the feoffe
takes them as damages fesaunt and puts them in pound / and the feoffour
brings an accion of trespass against him for entryng into his ground.
etc^. whether may any man knowing the said use be of counsel with the feoffe
to avoid that accion.


Doctoure. May he by the common law avoid that accion seeing that the
feoffour ought in conscience to have the profytes.


Student. ye verily / for as to the common law the hole interest is i^ the
feoffe and if the feoffe will break his conscience and take the profytes: the
feoffour has no remedy by the common law: but is driven in that case to sue
for his remedy by Sub pena for the profytes / and to cause him to refeoffe him
again / and that was sometime the most common case where the Sub pena was sued
/ that is to say / before the statute of Richard the third but sith that
statut the feoffour may lawfully make a feoffement. But nevertheless for the
profytes received: the feoffour has yet no remedy but by Sub pena as he had
before the said estatute. And so the supposell af this accio^ of trespass is
untrue in every point as to the common law.


Doctoure. Though. the accion be untrue as to the law: yet he that sueth it
ought (in conscience) to have that he demands by the accion / that is to say
/ damages for the profytes / and as it seems no man may with conscience give
counsel against that he knows conscience would have done.


Stu. Thouhe conscience would he should have the profytes / yet conscience will
that for the attayning thereof the feoffour should make an untrue surmyse.
Therefore against that untrue surmyse every man may with conscience give his
counsel / for in that doing he resysteth not the playntyfe to have the
profytes / but he withsta^deth him that he should not maintain an untrue
accion for the profits. And it suffiseth not i^ the law ne yet in conscience
as me semethe that a man have right to that he sueth for / but that also he
sue be a just means / and that he have both good right and also a good and a
true co^ueyau^ce to come to his right for if a man have right to lands as
heir to his father and he will bring an accion as heir to his mother that
never had right / every man may give counsel against that accion though he
know he have right by an other means / and so as me thinks he may do in
dilatories / whereby the party may take hurt if it were not pleaded / though
he know the plaintyfe have right as if the pertie or the town be misnamed /
or if the degrees in wryttes of enter be mistaken / but if the party should
take no hurt by admittynge of a dilatorye there he that knows that the
playntyfe has right may not plead that dilatorie with conscience as in a
Form done to plead in abatement of the writ because he has not made him
self heir to hi^ that was last seized / or in a writ of right for that the
demaundaunt has omitted one that tended right ne such other / ne he may not
assent to the castyng of an Essoyne nor proteccion for him if he know that the
dema^dau^t has right / ne he may not vouche for him except it be that he
knows that the tenant has a true cause of voucher and of lain / and that
he does it to bring him thereto / and in lykwyse he may not pray in age for
him: oneles he know the pray have good cause of voucher and lain over / or
that he know that the pray has somewhat to plead that the tenant may not
plead as vyllen age in the demaundaunte or such other.


Doctor. Though the playntyfe has brought an accion that is untrue and not
mayntenable in the law / yet the defendaunte does wrong to the playntyfe in
the withholdynge of the profytes as well before the accion brought as hanging
the accion / and that wrong as it seems the cou^saylour does mayntaine / and
also shows him self to favor the party in that wrong when he gives
co^cell against the accion.


Sudent. If the playntyfe do take that for a favor and a maynteynau^ce of his
wrong: he iugethe ferther than the cause is given / so that the cou^saylour do
no more but give counsel against the accion / for though he give hi^
counsel to withstand the accio^ for the untruth of it / and that he should
not confess it and to make thereby a fine to the king without cause / yet it
may stand with: that he may give counsel to the party to yield the profytes
/ and therefore I think he may in this case of counsel with him at the common
law and be against him in the chau^cery and in either court give his cou^sayl
without any contrariosite or hurt of conscience / and upon this ground it is
that a man may with good conscience be of counsel with him that has land by
descent or by a discontinuau^ce withouten title / if he that has the right
bring not his accion according to the law for the recouerynge of his right
in that behalf.


The seventh question of the studente. The.viii. Chapitre.
STudent. If a man take a distress for debt upon an obligacio^ or upon a
co^tracte or such other thing that he has right title to have: but that he
ought not by the law to distrayne for it / and nevertheless he keeps the same
distress in pound till he be paid of his duty / what restitucion is he
bound to make in this case / whether shall he repay the money because he is
come to it by an unlawful menes or only to restore the party for the
wrongful taking of the distres or for neither I pray you show me.


Doctoure. what is the law in this case.


Student That he that is distrayned may bring a special accion of trespass
against hi^ that distreyned / for that he took his beestes wrong fully and kept
them till he made a fine / and therefore he shall recover that fine in damages as
he shall do for the residue of trespass for that taking of the money by such
co^pulcion is taken in the law but as a fine wrongfully taken / though it be
his duete to have it.


Doctor. yet though he may so recover: me thinks that as to the repayment of
the money he is not bound thereto in conscience so that he take no more tha^ of
right he ought to have / for though he come to it by an unjust mean / yet wha^
the money is paid him it is his of right and he is not bound to repaye it
oneles it be recovered as thou said / and than when he has repayed it he is
as me thynkethe restored to his first accio^ / but to the redelyuere of the
beestes with such damages such hurt as he has by the distress. I suppose
he is bound to make recompense of them in conscience without compulcion or
suit in the law / for though he might lawfully have sued for his duete in
such manner as the law has ordered / yet I agree well that he may not take
upon him to be his own judge and to come to his duty against the order of the
law / and therefore if any hurt come to the party by that disorder he is
bound to restore it. But I would think it were the more doubt if a man took
such a distress for a trespass done to him and keeps the distress till
amends be made for the trespass / for i^ that cas the damages ben not in
certain but be arbitrable either by assent of the parties or by.xii. men / and
it seems that there is no asse^t of the party in this case specially no fre
assent / for that he does: is by compulcion and to have his dystres again /
and so his assent is not much to be pondered in that case / for all is the
assessynge of hi^ that took the distress / and so he has made hi^ self his
own judge / and that is prohibited in all laws / but in that case where the
distress is taken for debt: he is not his own judge / for the debt was iuged
incertaine by fore by the first contracte / and therefore some think great
diversity between the cases.


Student. By that reason it seems that if he that distrayneth in the first
case for the debt take any thing for his damages that he is bound in
conscience to restore it again / for damages be arbitrable and not certain no
more than trespass is / and me seems that both in the case of trespass and
debt he is bound in conscience to restore that he takes / for though he
ought in right to have like su^me as he resceyueth / yet he ought not to have
that money that he receives / for he came to that money by an unjust menes /
wherefore it seems he ought to restore it again.


Doctor. And if he should be compelled to restore it again: should he not yet
(for that he received it ones) be barred of his first accion not withsta^dyng
the repayme^t.


Stud. I will not at this time clearly assoyle the that question / but this I
will say that if any hurt come to him thereby: it is through his own defaut
for that he would do against the law / but nevertheless a little I will say to
thy question / that as me seems wha^ he has repayed the money that he is
restored to his first accio^. As if a man co^de^pned in an accion of trespass
pay the money / and after the defendau^t reuers the judgment by a writ of
error and have his money repayed / than the playntyfe is restored to his first
accio^. And therefore if he that i^ this case took the money: restored that he
took by the wrong full distress: or that he ordered the matter so liberally that
the other murmr not neco^playne not at it / me semethe he did verey well to
be sure in conscience: and therefore I would advise every man to be well ware
how he distrayneth in such case against the law.


Doctoure. Thy counsel is good / and I note much in this case that the party
may have an accion of trespass against him that distrayned so that he is
taken in the law but as a wrong doer / and therefore to pay the money again is
the sure way as thou have said before.

And I pray the now show me for what thing a man may lawfully distrayne as
thou thynkest.


For what thing a man may lawfully distrayne. The.ix. Chapitre.
STudent. A man may lawfully distrayn for a rent service and for all manner of
services / as homage / fealty / escuage / suit of court / relyefs and such
other. Also for a rent reserved upon a gift in tail / a lease for term of
life / for years / or at will / if he reserve the reuercion: the feoffour shall
distrayne of common right though there be no distress spoken of. But in case a
man make a feoffement and that in fee by indenture reseruyng a rent he shall not
distrayne for that rent oneles a distres be expressly reserved / and if the
feoffeme^t be made with outen deed reseruyng a rent that reseruacion is void
in the law / and he shall have the rent only in conscience and shall not
distrayne for it / and like law is where a gift in tail or a lease for term
of life is made the remayndre over in fee reseruyng a rent that reseruacion is
void in the law. Also if a man seized of lands for term of life grants
away his hole estate reseruyng a rent / that reseruacion is void i^ the law
without it be by endenture / and if it be by endenture: yet he shall not
distrayne for the rent but a distress be reserved. Also for a merciamente in a
leete the lord shall distrayne. But for a merciament in a court Baron he shall
not distrayne. Also if a man make a lease at Mighelmasse for a year /
reserving a rent payable at the feast of the Annunciacion of our Lady and
saint Michell the Archaungell / in that case he shall distrayne for the rent due
at our Lady aye / but not for the rent due at Mighelmasse / because the term
is expired. But if a man make a lease at the feast of Christemasse for to
endure to the feast of Christemasse next following / that is to say for a year
a reseruyng a rent at the aforsayd feast of the Annunciacion of our Lady and
saint Michel the Archaungell: there he shall distrayne for both the rentes as
long as the term continues / that is to say till the aforsayd feast of
Christemasse. Also if a man have land for term of life of Ioha^ at Noke / and
makes a lease for term of years reserving a rent / that rent is behind /
and Johan at Noke dies / there he shall not distrayne because his reuercion is
determined. Also if he to whose use feffes ben seized makes a lease for term
of years / or for term of life / or a gift in tail reserving a rent / there
the reseruacion is good and the lessour shall distrayne.

Also if a towneshype be amercied and the neighbors by assent assesseth a
certain sum upon every inhabitaunt / and agree that if it be not paid by
such a day: that certain persons thereto assigned shall distrayne. In this
case the distress is laweful. If lord and tenant be / and the tenant does
hold of the lord by fealtye and rent / and the lord does grant away the
fealty reserving the rent / and the tenant attorneth in this case / he that
was lord may not distrayne for the rent / for it is become a rent secke. But
if a man make a gift in tail to a another reseruyng fealty and certain rent /
and after that he grants away the fealty reseruyng the rent and the
reuercion to him self / in this case he shall distrayne for the rent / for the
grant of the fealty is void / for the fealty can not be severed fro the
reuercion. Also for heryof service the lord shall distrayne and for heriot
custom he shall sease and not distrayne.

Also if a rent be assigned to make a particion or assignemente of dower egall
he or she to whom that rent is assigned may distrayne and in all these cases
above said where a man may distrayne he may not distrayne in the night / but
for damages fesaunt / that is to say / where beestes do hurt in his ground he
may distrayne in the night. Also for wastes / for reperacions / for accomptes /
for dettes upon contractes or such other no man may lawfully distrayne.


The.viii. question of the student. The.x. Chapitre.
STudent. If a man do a trespass and after make his executours and dye before
any amends made whether be his executours bound in conscience to make amends
for the trespass if they have sufficient goods thereto though there be no
remedy against them be the law to compel them to it.


Doctor. It is no doubt but they are bound thereto in conscience before any
other deed in charity that they may do for him of their own devotion.


Stu. Than would I wete if the testatour made legacies by his will / whether
the executores be bound to do first / that is to say / to make amends for the
trespass or to pay the legacies / in case they have no goods to do both.


Doctoure. To pay legacies. For if they should first make recompense for the
trespass / and than have not sufficient to pay the legacies: they should be
taken i^ the law as wasters of their testatours goods for they were not
compellable by no law to make ame^des for the trespass because every trespass
dies with the person / but the legacies they should be compelled by the law
spiritual to fulfill / and so they should be compelled to pay the legacies of
their own goods / and they shall not be compelled thereto by no law ne
conscience / but if the case were that he leave sufficient goods to do both:
tha^ me thinks they be bound to do both / and that they be bounden to make
amends for the trespass before they may do any other charitable deed for the
testatoure of their own mind as I have said before / except the funeral
expe^ces that be necessary which must be allowed before all other things.


Student. And what the prouyng of the testament.


Doctor. The ordinary may nothing take by conscience therefore / if there be
not sufficient goods beside for the funeralles to pay the dettes and to make
restitucion. And in like wise the executours ben bound to pay dettes upon a
simple contracte before any other deed of charity that they may do for their
testatoure of their own devotion though they shall not be compelled thereto by
the law.


Stude^t. And whether think thou that they be bound to do first / that is
to say / to make amends for the trespass or to pay the dettes upon a simple
co^tracte.


Doctoure. To pay the dettes for that is certain and the trespass is arbitrable.


Student. Than for the playner declaracion of this matter and other like I
pray the show me thy mind by what law it is that a man may make executours
and that the executours if they take upon them be bound to perform the will
and to dispose the goods that remain for the testatour.


Doctor. I think that it is by the law of reason.


Student. And me thinks it should be rather by the custom of the realm.


Doctor. In all co^treys and in all lands they make executours


Stude^t. That seems to be rather by a general custom after that the law
and custom of property was brought in than by the law of reason / for as
long as all things were in common: there were no executours ne wylles ne they
neded not tha^ / and when property was after brought in: me thinks that yet
making of executours and disposyng of goods by will after a man's death
followed not necessarely there upon / for it might have been made for a law that
a man should have had the property of his goods only during his life / and
that tha^ his dettes paid / all his goods to have been left to his wife and
clyldren or next of his kynne without any legacies making there of and so might
it now be ordained by statute / and the statut good and not against reason /
wherefore it appears that executours have no auctorite by the law of reason but
by the law of man. And by the old law and custom of this realm a man may
make executours and dispose his goods by his will / and than his executours
shall have the execucion thereof and his heirs shall have nothing / but if any
particular custom help / and the executours shall also have the hole
possession ad disposicion of all his goods and catels / as well real as
personal / though no word be expressly spoken in the will that they shall
have them / and they shall have also accions to recover al dettes due to the
testatour though all dettes and legacies of the testatour by paid before /
and shall have the disposicion of them to the use of the testatour and not to
their own use / and so me thinks that the auctorite to make executours and
that they shall dispose the goods for the testatour: is by the custom of the
realm. But than I think as thou say that by the law of god they shall be
bound to do that first / that is to the most profit of the soul of their
testatour where the disposicion thereof is left to their discrecion / and that
I agree well is to pay dettes upon contractes and to make amends for wro^ges
done to the testatour though they be not compelled thereto by the law and
custom of the realm if there be none other debt nor legacy that they be
bound to pay by the law / but if two several dettes be payable by the law:
tha^ which debt they shall do first in conscience: I am somewhat in doubt.


Doctoure. Let us first know what the common law is therein.


Student. The common law is that if the testatoure owe.x. li. to two men
severally by obligacion or by such other manner that an accion lies against
his executours thereof by the law / and he leueth goods to pay the one and not
both / that in that case he that can first optaine his judgment against the
executours shall have execucion of the hole / and the other shall have nothing
/ but to which of them he shall in conscience owe his favor: the common law
treats not.


Doctor. There in must be considered the cause why the dettes began / and
than he must after conscience bear his lawful favor to hi^ that has the
clerest cause of debt / and if both have like cause: than in conscience he
must bear his favor where is most need and greatest charity.


Student. May the executours in that case delay that accio^ that is first taken
if it stand not with so good conscience to be paid as a another debt whereof
no accion is brought and procure that an accion may be brought thereof and than
to confess that accion / that he may so have execucion / and tha^ the
executours to be discharged against the other.


Doctor. Why may he not in that case pay the other without accion and so be
discharged in the law against the first.


Sudent. No verily for after an accion is taken the executoure may not
ministre the goods so / but that he leave so much as shall pay the debt whereof
the accion is taken / and if he do he shall pay it of his own goods /
except a another recover and have judgment against him hanging that accion and
that without couyn.


Doctor. Tha^ to answer to thy question I think that by delays that be
lawful as by Essoyne / emperlaunce / or by a Dilatory plee in abatement of the
writ that is true / he may delay it / but he may plede no untrue ple to
prefer the other to his duty. But I pray the what is the law of legacies
restitucions and dettes upon co^tractes that perease ought rather after charity
to be paid tha^ a debt upon an obligacio^ what may the favor of the
executoures do in those cases.


Student. Nothing for if they either perform legacies / make restitucions /
or pay dettes upon contractes and keep not sufficient to pay dettes which
they are compellable by the law to pay / that shall be taken as a deuastauerunt
bona testatoris / that is to say / that they have wasted the goods of their
testatour and therefore they shall be compelled to pay the dettes of their own
goods / and so it is if they pay a debt upon an obligacion whereof the day is
yet to come though it be the clerer debt and that it be the more charity to
have it paid.


Doc. yet in that case if he to whom the debt is al ready owing forbere till
after the day of the other obligacion is paste / than he may pay him without
danger.


Student. That is true if there be no accion taken upon it and though there be
/ yet if that accio^ may be delayed by lawful means as thou have spoken of
before: till after the day and than an accion is taken upon it than may the
executours confess that accion and than after judgment he may pay the debt
without danger of the law.


Doctor. Is not that confessyng of the accion so done of purpose a couyn in
the law.


Student. No verily / for couyn is where the accio^ is untrue / and not where
the executours bear a lawful favor.


Doctor. The ordinary upon the account in all the cases before reherced will
regard much what is best for the testatour.


Stude^t. But he may not drive them to account against the order of the common
law.


The.ix. question of the student. The.xi. Chapitre.
STudent. A man is indetted to another upon a simple contracte in.xx. li. and
he makethe his will and byquetheth xx. li. to Henry heart and dies and leueth
goods to his executours only to bury hi^ with / ano to perform the said
legacy / and after the said executoures deliver the goods of their testatour
in perfourmaunce of the said byquest / whether is he to whom the byquest is
made: bound in conscience to pay the said debt upon the simple contracte to
the said Henry heart or not.


Doct. Is he not bound thereto by the law.


Student. No verily.


Doctor And what thynkest thou he is in conscience


Student. I think that he is not bound thereto in conscience / for he is
neither ordinary administratour / nor executour. And I have not herd that any
man is bound to pay dettes of any man that is decessed / but he be one of
those three / for the goods that the testatour left to the executoures were
never charged with the debt / but the person of the testatour while he lived
was only charged with the debt and not his goods / and his executours that
represent his estate after his death having goods thereto of the testatoures be
charged also with the dettes and not the goods. And therefore if an executour
give away or sell all the goods of the testatoure or otherwise waste them: he
that has the goods is not charged with the dettes in law nor conscience /
but the executours shall be charged of their own goods / and in like wise if
Johan at Noke owe to A. B. xx. li. and A. B. owes to C.D. xx. li. and after
A.B. dies intestate having none other goods but the said.xx. li. which the
said Johan at Noke owes hi^ / yet the said C. D. shall have no remedy against
the said Johan at Noke / for he stands not charged to hi^ in law nor
conscience. But the ordinary in that case must commit administracion of the
goods of the said A. B. And the said administratour must leuy the money of the
said Johan at Noke and pay it to the said C.D. And the said Johan at N. shall
not pay it him self because he is not charge therewith to hi^ / and no more
me thinks i^ this case that he to whom the byquest is made is neither
charge to hi^ that the money was owing to i^ law nor conscience.


Doctor. Than show me thy mind by what law it is grounded as thou thynkest
that executores be bound to pay dettes before legacies / whether is it by the
law of god / or by the law of reso^ / or by the law of man as thou thynkest.


Studente. I think that it is both by the law of reason and by the law of
god / for reason will that they shall do first that is best for the testatour /
and that is to pay dettes that his testatour is bound to pay before legacies
that he is not bound to.

And also by the law of god they are bound to pay the dettes first / for
sithe they are bounden by the law of god to love their neighbor / they are
bound to do for him that shall be best for him when they have taken the charge
thereto / as executours do when they agree to take the charge of the will of
their testatour upon them / and it is better for the testatour that his dettes
be paid: wherefore his soul shall suffer pain: than that his legacies be
performed / wherefore he shall suffer no pain for the not perfourmynge of
them. And that is to be understand where the legacy is made of his own fre
will and not where it is made as a satisfaccion of any dute. And after the
saying of saint Gregory / the very true proffe of love is the deed. But this
man is not i^ that case / for he never took the charge upon him to pay the
dettes of the testatour. And therefore he is not bound to the^ in law nor
conscience as me seems. But rather the executoures should have been ware or
they had paid the legacies seeing there were dettes to pay.


Doct. The executours might none otherwise have done in this case but to pay
the legacies for the^ they should have been compelled by the law to have paid /
and so they could not have been to have paid the debt upon a contracte. And
therefore they did well in perfourminge of the legacy / but he to whom the
legacy was made ought not to have taken them / but ought in conscience to have
suffered them to have gone to the payment of the debt / and sithe he did not so
but took them where he had no right to them / it seems that when he took them
/ he took the^ with the charge in conscience to pay the debt / for sith the
executours were compellable by the law to perform the byquest and not to
pay the debt / therefore when they performed that byqueste / they were
discharged thereby against him that the debt was owing to in the law and
conscience and than the charge rested upon hi^ that took the goods where he
ought not in conscience to have taken them / but if it had been a debt upon an
obligacion or such other debt / whereupon remedy might have been had against
the executoures by the law / there I suppose that though the executoures had
performed the legacy that yet he to whom the legacye was made and performed
had not been charged in conscience to the payment of the debt / for the
executoures stood still charged there to of their own goods / and he to whom
that byqueste was made was only bound in consciende to repaye that he
received to the executoures because he had no right to have received it / for
against the executours he had no right thereto.


Student. Than it seems in this case that in like wise he to whom the bequest
was made should repay that he received to the executours / and than they to pay
it rather than he.


Doctor. The executours have no ferther medlynge with it as this case is / for
when they performed the byquest they were discharged against both the other
in law and conscience / and also he to whom the byqueste was made stood not
in this case charged to the executours / for as against them he had good title
by the law / and so this charge stands only against him that the debt is
owyng to / and the same law that is in this case upon a debt upon a contracte
is if the testatour had done a trespass whereupon he ought to have made
restitucion / that is to say / that he to whom the byquest is made is bound
to make the amends for the trespass / for it should be no discharge to him to
pay it again to the executoures without they paid it over / and it were
uncertain to hi^ whether they would pay it or not. And therefore to be out of
peril: it is necessary that he pay it him self / and than is he surely
discharged against all men.


The.x. question of the student. The.xii. Chapitre.
STudent. A man seized of certain land in his demean as of fee / has issue
two sons and dies seized / after whose death a stranger abateth / and takes
the profytes / and after the eldest sone dies without issue and his brother
brings an assise of Mortdau^cestre as sone and heir to his father not
making mention of his brother and recouereth the land with damages fro the
death of his father as he may well by the law / whether i^ this case is the
younger brother bound in conscience to pay to the executours of the eldest
brother the value of the profytes of the said land that belonged to the eldest
brother in his life or not.


Doctor. What is thine opinion therein.


Student. That like as the said profytes belonged of right to the eldest
brother in his life / and that he had full auctorite to have released as well
the right of the said land as of the said profytes / which release should
have been a clear bar to the younger brother for ever. That the right of the
said damages which be in the law but a chatell / bylonge to his executoures
and not to the heir / for no manner of chatell neither real nor parsonall
shall not after the law of the realm discende unto the heir.


Doctoure. Thou saydest to the case next before / that it is not of the law of
reason that a man shall may make executours / and dispose his goods by his
will / and that the executoures shall have the goods to dispose but by the
law of man / and if it be left to the terminacion of the law of man. Tha^ in
such cases as the law gives such chatelles unto the executoures / they
shall have good right unto them / and in such cases as the law takethe such
chatelles from them: they been ryghtfully taken from them. And therefore it is
thought by many that if a man sue a writ of right of ward of awarde that
he has by his own fee and dies hanging the writ / and his heir sue a
resomons according to the statute of Westmester second / and recouereth: that
in that case the heir shall enjoy the wardeshype against the executoures /
and yet it is but a chatel / and they take the reason to be because of the said
estatute / and so might it be ordained by statute that all wards should go to
the heirs and not to the executoures. Right so i^ this case sith the law is
such that the younger brother shall in this case have an assyse of Mort
dauncestre as heir to his father: not making any mention of his elder brother
and recover damages as well i^ the time of his brother as in his own time: it
appears that the law gives the right of these damages to the heir / and
therefore no recompense ought to be made to the executoures as me seems / and
it is not like to a wryt of Ayel: where as I have learned i^ Latin (sith our
first dialogue) the demaundau^t shall recover damages only fro the death of
his father if he over live the Ayel / and the cause is for the demau^t though
his Ayel over lived his father must of necessite make his co^ueyau^ce by his
father and must make hi^ self sone and heir to his father and cosyn and
heir to his Ayel / and therefore in that case if the father over lived the
Ayel: the abatour were bounden in conscience to restore to the executours of
the father the profytes re^ne in his time / for no law takes the^ fro hi^ /
but otherwise is i^ this case as me seems.


Student. If the younger brother in this case had entered into the land without
taking any assyse of Mort dauncestoure as he might if he would / to whom were
the abatour than bounden to make restitucio^ for those profytes as thou
thynkest.


Doctor. To the executours of the eldest brother / for i^ that case there is
no law that takes them from them / and therefore the general ground which is
that al chatels shall go to the executoures: holds in that case / but in this
case that ground is broken and holds not for the reason that I have made
before / for commonly there is no general ground in the law so sure: but that
it fails in some particular case.


The.xi. question of the student. The.xiii. Chapitre.
STudent. A man seized of land in fee takes a wife / and after alieneth the
land and dies / after whose death his wife asks her dower and the aliene
refuses to assign it unto her / but after she asks her dower again and he
assigns it unto her / whether is the alme in this case bound in conscience
to give the woman damages for the profits of the land after her third part
fro the death of her husband / or fro the first request of her dower or
neither the one nor the other.


Doct. what is the law in this case.


Student By the law the woman shall recover no damages / for at the common law
the demau^daunt i^ a writ of dower should never have recovered damages. But
by the statute of Marton yt is ordained that where the husband dies seized
that the woman shall recover damages which is understand the profytes of the
land sithe the death of her husband / and such damages as she has by the
forberynge of it / but in this case the husband dyed not seized / where fore
she shall recover no damages by the law


Doctor. yet the law is that immediately after the death of her husband the
wife ought of right to have her dower if she ask it though her husband died
not seized.


Student. That is true.


Doctoure. And sith she ought to have her dower fro the death of her husband
yt seems that she ought in conscience to have also the profytes fro the death
of her husband though she have no remedy to come to them by the law / for me
thinks that that this case is like too a case that thou put in our first
dyalogue in latin the xvii. chapter. That if a tenaunte for term of life be
dysseased and dye / and the disseasoure dies / and his heir enters and
takes the profytes / and after he in the reuercyon recouereth the lands
against the heir as he ought too do by the law / that in that case he shall
recover no damages by the law. And yet thou dydest agree that i^ that case the
heir is bound in concience to pay the damages to the demaundaunt and so me
thinks i^ this case that the feoffe ought in conscience to pay the damages
fro the death of her husband saying that immediately after his death she ought
too have her dower.


Student. Though she ought too be endowed immediately after the death of her
husband / yet she can lay no defaute in the feoffe till she demand her dower
upon the ground / and that the tenaunte be not there too assign it / or if
he be there that he will not assign it / for he that has the possessyon of
land whereunto any woman has title of dower has good auctorytye as against
her to take the profytes till she require her dower for every woman that
demands dower affermeth the possessyon of the tenant as against her and
therefore all though she recover it by accyo^ she leueth the reuercyon alwey in
him against whom she recouereth though he be a dysseasour and brings not
the reuercyon by her recovery to him that has right as other tenauntes for
term of life do. And for this reason it is that the tenaunte in a writ of
dower where the husband dyed seized if he appear the first day may say to
excuse himself of damages that he is and all times has been ready to yield
dower if it had been demanded / and so he shall not be received to do i^ a wryt
ofcosynage nether i^ the case that thou remembrest above / for in both cases
the renauntes be supposed by the writ to be wrong doers / but it is not so
in this case / and so me thinks it clear that the feoffe i^ this case shall
nether be bound by law nor conscience to yield damages for the time that
passed before the request / but for the time after the request is greater
doubt / how be it some thinks him not there bound to yield damages because
his title is good as is said before and that it is her defaute that she brought
not her accyon.


Doctor. As unto the time before the request I hold me content with thine
opinion so that he assign the dower when he is required / but when he refuses
to assign it: than I think him bound in conscience to yield damages for
both times though he shall none recover by the law. And first as for the
time after the refusell: it appears euidentely that when he denied to assign
her dower: he did against conscience / for he did not that of right to have
done by the law / ne as he would should have been done to him / and so after
the request he holds her dower fro her wrongfully and ought in conscience to
yield damages therefore. And as to the defaute that thou assignest in her that
she took not her accio^ / that forces little for accio^s need not / but where
the party will not do that he ought to do of right. And for that he ought of
right to have done and did it not / he can take none advantage / and than as
to the damages before the request me thinks him also bounden to pay the^ /
for when he was required to assygne dower and refused. It appears that he
never intended to yield dower fro the beginning / and so he is a wrong doer in
his own conscience / and more over if the husband dye seized the law is such
that if the tenant refuse to assign dower when he is required wherefore the
woman brings a writ of dower against him / that in that case the woman
shall recover damages as well for the time before the request as after / and yet
he ought not i^ that case after thine opinion to have yielded any manner of
damages if he had been ready to assign dower when it was demanded / and so me
thinks here.


Studente. The cause in that case that thou haste put is for that the statute
is general that the demau^dau^t shall recover damages where the husband dyed
seized / and that statute has been always construed that where the tenant
may not say that he is and has been always ready to yield dower. etc^. that
the demaundaunt shall recover damages fro the death of her husband. But in
this case there is no law of the realm that helps for the damaundau^t
neither common law nor statut / and forthermore though it might be proved by
his refusell that he never intended fro the death of the husband to assign her
dower yet that proves not / but that he had good right to take the profits of
her third part for the time as well as he had of his own two parts: till
request be made as is before said / and so me thinks that not withstandyng the
denyer he is not bound to yield damages in this case but fro the time of the
request / and not for the time before.


Doctoure. For this time I am content with thy reason.


The.xii. question of the student. The.xiiii. Chapitre.
STudent. A man seized of certain lands knowing that an other has good right
and title to them leuieth a fine with proclamacion to the intent he would
extyncte the right of the other man / and the other man makethe no claim
within the.v. years / whether may he that leuyed the fine hold the land in
conscience as he may do by the law.


Doctoure. By this question it seems that thou doste agree that if he that
leuyeth the fine had no knowledge of the other man's right: that his right
should than be extyncted by the fine in conscience.


Student. ye verily / for thou dydest show a reasoneble cause why it should be
so in our first dialogue in latyne the.xxiiii. Chapitre as there appears.
But if he that leuyeth a fine and that would extyncte the right of an other /
knowing that the other has more right than he (than I doubt therein) for I
take thine opinion in our first dialogue to be understand in conscience where
he that would extincte former ryghtes by such a fine with proclamacio^ knows
not of any former title but for his more surety if any such former right be:
he takes the remedy that is ordained by the law.


Doctoure. Whether do thou mean in this case that thou put now that he
that has right: knows of the fine and wylfully lettethe the.v. year pas
without claim or that he knows not any thing of the fine.


Student. I pray the let me know thine opinion in both cases and whether thou
think that he that has right be barred in either of the cases by conscience
as he is by the law or not.


Doctor. I will with good will here after show me thy mind therein / but at
this time I pray the give a little sparyng and proceed now for this time to
some other question.


The.xiii. question of the student. The.xv. Chapitre.
STudent. A man seized of certain lands in fee has a daughter which is his
heir apparau^te / the daughter takes a husband and they have issue: the
father deyeth seized / and the husband as soon as he hereth of his death goes
toward the land to take possession / and before he can come there: his wife
dies / whether ought he to have the land in conscience for term of his life
as tenant by the courtesy because he has done that in him was to have had
possession in his wives life so that he might have been tenant by the courtesy
according to the law / or that he shall neither have it by law nor
conscience.


Doctor. Is it clearly holde^ in the law that he shall not be tenant by the
curtesy in this case because he had not possession in deed.


Student. ye verily / and yet upon a possessicio^ in law a woman shall have her
dower / but no man shall be tenaunte by the courtesy of land without his wife
have possession in deed.


Doctoure. A man shall be tenant by the courtesy of a rent though his wife dye
before the day of payment / and in like wise of an aduowson though she dye
before the auoydaunce.


Studente. That is truth / for the old custom and maxim of the law is
that he shall be so / but of land there is no maxim that serves him but his
wife have possession in deed


Doctor. And what is the reason that there is such a maxim in the law of
the rent and of the aduowson rather tha^ of land / when the husband does as
much as in him is to have possession and can not


Stude^t. Some assign the reason to be because it is impossible to have
possession in deed of the rent or of aduouson before the day of payment of the
rent / or before the auoydaunce of the aduouson.


Doct. And so is impossible that he shall have possession in deed of land if
his wife dye so sone that he may not by possibility come to the land after
her fathers death / and in her life as this case is.


Student. The law is such as I have showed the before and I take the verey
cause to be for that there is a maxim serves for the rent and the aduouson /
and not for the lands as I have said before / and as it is said in the viii.
chapitre of our first dialogue / it is not always necessary to assign a
reason or co^sideracio^ why the maxims of the law of England were first
ordained and admitted for maxims / but it suffisethe that they have been always
taken for law and that they be neither contrary to the law of reason nor to
the law of god as this maxim is not / and therefore if the husband in this
case be not helped by conscience he can not be helped by the law.


Doctor. And if the law help him not: conscience can not help him in this
case / for conscience must always be grounded upon some law / and it can not
in this case be grounded upon the law of reason nor upon the law of god / for
it is not dyrectely by those laws that a man shall be tenant by the curtesy /
but by the custom of the realm. And therefore if that custom help hi^ not:
he can nothing have in this case by conscience / for conscience never resysteth
the law of man nor adds nothing to it / but where the law of man is in it
self dyrectly against the law of reason or else the law of god / and than
properly it can not be called a law but a corrupcion / or where the general
grounds of the law of man works in any particular case against the said
laws as it may do / and yet the law good as it appears in diverse places in
our first dialogue in latyne / or else where there is no law of man provided
for him that has right to a thing by the law of reason or by the law of
god. And than sometime there is remedy given to execute that in conscience / as
by a Sub pena but not in all cases / for sometime it shall be referred to the
conscience of the party / and upon this ground (that is to say) that when
there is no title given by the common law: that there is no title by
conscience. There be diverse other cases whereof I shall put some for an
example. As if a reuercion be granted unto one / but there is none
attournement / or if a new rent be granted by word with out deed: there is
no remedy by conscience oneles the said grauntes were made upon consideracions
of money or such other.

And in like wise where he that is seized of lands in fee simple makes a will
thereof / the will is void in conscience because the ground seruethe not for
him whereby the conscience should take effect / that is to say / the law /
and if the tenaunte make a feoffement of the land that he holds by priorite
and takes estate again and dies (his heir within age) the lord of whom
the land was first holden by prioritie shall have no remedy for the body by
conscience / for the law that first was with him / is now against him / and
therefore conscience is altered in like wise as the law alters / and diverse
and many cases like be in the law that were to long to reherce now. And thus
me thinks that if the law be as thou say: the husband i^ this case has
neither right by the law nor conscience.


The.xiiii. question of the student. The.xvi. Chapitre.
STudent. A rent is granted to a man i^ fee to perceive of two acres of land /
and after the grau^tour enfeoffeth the grauntee of one of the said acres /
whether is the hole rent extyncte thereby in conscience as it is in the law.


Doctor. Thy case is somewhat uncertain / for it appears not whether the
grauntour enfeoffed him on trust: or that he gave the acre to him of his mere
mocion to the use of the said feoffe / or else that the feoffement was made upon
a bargayne / and if it were but only a feoffement of trust / than I think
the hole rent abides in conscience though it be extyncted in the law / and
first that it continues in that case in conscience / for that part that the
grauntee has to the use of the grauntour / it is euidente / for he may not
take the profytes of the land / and it is against conscience that he should
lose both / and in like wise it abides i^ conscience for the acre that
remains in the hands of the grauntour though it be extyncte in the law /
for there was a defaute in the grauntoure that he would make the feoffement to
the grauntee as well as there was in the grauntee to take it. And it is no
conscience that of his own defaute he should take so great avail to be
discharged of the hole rent seeing that the feoffement was made to his own
use. And if the feoffeme^t were made upon a bargayne and a contracte between
them / than it is to se whether they remembered the rent in in their bargayne /
or that they remembered it not / and if they remembered it in their bargayne and
contracte / than conscience must follow the bargain / as thus if they agreed
that the grauntee should have the rent after the portion in the other acre than
by conscience he ought to have it though it be extincted i^ the law. And if
they agreed that the hoole rent should be extyncte and made their price
according than it is extyncte in law and conscience / and if they clearly
forgete it and made no mention of it / or for lack of conning took the law
to be that it should continue in the other acre after the portion and made
their price according / ponderynge only the value of the acre that was sold:
than me thinks / it does continue in conscience after the portion / and if
the feoffement were made to the use of the grau^tee / than it seems the hole
rent is extyncte in law and conscience.


Student. Than take that to be the case / that is to say / that the feoffement
was made to the use of the grau^tee.


Doctoure. What is than thine opinion therein.


Student. That the rent should abide in conscience after the portion for the
acre that remains in the hands of the grauntoure natwithstandynge it be
extyncte in the law.


Doctoure. Than show me thine opinion i^ this that I shall ask the. Of what
law is it that grauntes of rent and of such other profits out of lands may
be made and that they shall be good and effectual to the grau^tees / whether is
it by the law of reason or by the law of god or by the custom and law of
the realm.


Studente. I think it is by the law of reason / for by the same reason that a
man may give away all his lands: he may as it semethe give away the
profytes thereof or grant a rent out of the land if he will.


Doctor. But than by what law is it that a man may give away his lands / I
trow by none other law but by the custom of the realm / for by statute all
alienacions and gifts of lands may be prohibit / and than that reason
proves not that grauntes of the profytes of land or of a rent should be good
by cause he may alien the land / if alienacions of land be by custom and
not by the law of reason as I suppose it is / whereof I touched somewhat in our
first dialogue in latyne the.xix. Chapitre. And also if grauntes should have
their effect by the law of reason: than reason would that they should be good
by the only word of the grauntoure as well as by his deed / and that is not so
/ for without deed the grant of rent is void in the law and so my thinks
that grau^tes have their effect only by the law of the realm.


Stude^t (Admyt it to be so) what meanest thou thereby


Doctor. I shall show the here after as I shall show the the cause why I
think the rent is extyncte in conscience as well as in law. And first as I
take it the reason why it is extyncte in the law is because the rent by the
first grant was going out of both acres / and was not going part out of the
one acre and part out of the other / but the hole rent was going out of both /
and than when the grauntee of his one folly will take estate in the one acre
whereby that acre is discharged / than the other acre also must be discharged
oneles it should be apporcioned and the law will not that any apporcioneme^t
should be in that case / but rather in as much as the party has by his own
act discharged the one acre: the law discharges also the other / rather than
to suffer the other acre to be charged contrary to the form of the grant /
for this re^t begins all by the act of the party and as I have herd is
called a re^t against common right / wherefore it is not favored i^ the law as a
rent service is / and than me thinks that for as much as it is not grounded
by the law of reason that grauntes of rent should be made out of land / but
by the custom and law of the realm as I have said before / that so in like
wise it remains to the law and custom of the realm to determine how long
such rentes shall continue. And when the law iugeth such rentes to be void:
I suppose that so does conscience also / except the judgment of the law be
against the law of reason or the law of god / as it is not in this case for
in this case he that takes the feoffement has profit by the feoffement / and
knows that he has such a rent out of the land / and that his purchase
should extynct it / whereby it appears that he asienteth unto the law whereto
he was not compelled / and that is his own act and his own defaut so to do /
which shall extyncte his hole rent as well in consciente as in the law. But
if he have no profit of the land or be ignorant that he has such a rent
out of the land which is called ignorance of the deed / or if he be
ignorant that the law would extyncte his hole re^t thereby / which is called
ignorance of the law / than me thynkethe it remains in conscience after the
portion.


Student. Ignorance of the law or of the deed helps not but in few cases
i^ the law of England.


Doctoure. And therefore it must be reformed by conscience / that is to say by
the law of reason / for wha^ the general maxims of the law be i^ any
particular cases against the law of reason as this maxim seems to be because
it excepteth not the^ that be ignorant though it be an ignorance in vincible
tha^ do they not agree with the law of reason.


Student. We thinks that ignorance i^ this case helps little / for when a
man byethe any land or takes it of the gift of any other he takes it at his
peril / so that if the title be not good: ignorance ca^ not help / for the
byer must byware what he byeth / and so in this case if the taking of the one
acre should extincte the hole rent in conscience if he were not ignorant /
some thinks it should in like wise extincte it also though he be ignorant
of the law or of the deed / for every man must be compelled to take notyce of
his own title: and out of what land his rent is going / and some thinks
ignorance is but little to be considered in this case.


Doctor. If a man bye land or take it of the gift of an other: it is reason
that he take it with the peril though he be ignorant that a another has right
/ for it were not standing with reason that his ignorance should extyncte the
right of a another / but in this case there is no doubt of the right of the land
/ but all the doubt is how the rent shall be ordered in conscience if he that
has the rent take part of the land / and therein is great diversity between
him that is ignorant in the law / and him that knows the law / and
knowethe well also that he has a rent out of that land and other. For I put
case that he asked counsel of the grauntour him self therein and he saying as
he thought told hi^ yt the taking of the one acre should not extyncte the rent
but for the portion: and so he thinking the law to be: took the other acre of
his gift. Is it not reasonable in that case that that ignorance should save
the rent in conscience.


Student. yes / for there the grauntour him self is party to his ignorance
and is in manner the cause thereof.


Doctor. And me thynkethe all is one if any other had showed him so / or if he
had asked no counsel at all / for me thynkethe it suffiseth in this case that
he be ignorant of the law / for why / it is more hard in this cas to prove
that the rent should be extyncte in conscience though he know it shall be
extyncted in the law: than to prove that it continues in conscience after the
portion if he be ignorant / and thou thy self were of the same opinion / as it
appears in the beginning of this present Chapitre / but if that opinion were
true: it would be hard to prove but that the said general maxim were holly
against reason / and tha^ it were void / but I have sufficiently answered
thereto as me semethe / and that it is extyncte in the law and also in
conscience / except ignorance help it to be apporcioned. And more over for
as much as apporcioneme^t is suffered in the law where perte of the land
discendeth to the grauntee because no defaute can be assigned in him / so me
thinks no defaute can be assigned in him in conscience wha^ he is ignorant
of the law or of the deed though such ignorance do not excuse in the law
of the realm.


Student. I am content with thine opinion in this behalf at this time.


The.xv. question of the student. The.xvii. Chapitre.
STudent. A man grau^teth a re^t charge out of two acres of land / and after
the grauntour enfeoffeth Henry heart in one of the said two acres to the use of
the said Henry heart and of his heirs / and after the said Henry heart
entendynge to extyncte all the rent causes the said acre to be recovered
against him to his own use in a wryt of enter in the post in the name of the
grauntee and of other after the common course / the grauntee not knowing of it /
and by force of the said recouere the other demaundau^tes enter and dye /
living the grauntee / so that the grau^tee is seized of al by the surueiour to
the use of the said Henry heart / whether is the said rent extyncte in
conscience in part nor in all or i^ no part.


Doctor. I am in doubt of the law in this case.


Student. In what point.


Doctoure whether the hole rent be going out of the acre that remains in the
hands of the grau^tour because the grauntee comes to the land by way of
recouere / or that it shall be extyncte in the law / but after the porcio^ by
cause the grau^tee has not the acre to his own use / or that the hole re^t
shall be extincte i^ the law.


Student. The rent can not be hoole going out of the acre that the grauntoure
has / for this recouere is upon a feigned title / and the grau^tour because he
is strange to it: shall be well resceyued to falsify it.

But if the recouerye had been upon a true title: than it had been as thou say
/ for if the grauntee recover the one acre against the grauntour upon a true
title / the grau^tour shall pay the hole rent out of that land that remains
in his hand / and as to the use it makes no matter to the grauntoure as to the
law in whom the use be / for the possession without the use extynguyssheth
the hole rent as against him in the law as well as if the possession and use
were both joined to gether in the grauntee.


Doct. Than me thynkethe that the said Henry heart is bounden in conscience to
pay the grau^tee the rent after the portion of that acre that was recovered /
for it ca^ not stand with conscience that he should lose his rent and have no
profits of the land.


Student. Than of whom shall he have the other portion of his rent.


Doctoure. Is the law clear that the acre that the grauntour has shall be in
this case discharged in the law.


Student. I take the law so.


Doctor. And what in conscience.


Student. As against the grauntoure me thinks / also it is extyncte in
conscience for the reason that thou have made in the.xvi. Chapitre / for it is
all one in conscience in this case as against the grau^tour whether the
recouere were to the use of the grauntee or not / especially seeing that the
grauntoure is not priuey to the recovery / for the unite of possession is the
cause of extinguissheme^t of the rent against the grau^toure both in law and
conscience where so ever the use be / but if the grauntour had been priuey to
the cause of the extynguisshement as he was in the case that I put in the last
Chapitre where the grauntoure enfeoffed the grauntee of one of the acres to the
use of the grauntee there it is not extyncte in conscience in that acre that
remains in the hands of the grauntoure though it be extyncted i^ the law /
because he was pryuey to the extynguisshement himself / but he is not so in
this case / and therefore it is extyncte against him i^ law and conscience. And
therefore me thynkethe that the grauntee shall in conscience have the hoole
rent of the said Henry heart that caused the said recouere to be had in his
name / for in him was all the defaute / but it is to be understand that in all
the cases where it is said before in this Chapitre or in the Chapitre next
before: that the rent is extincte in the law and not in conscience that in
such case all the remedies that the party might first have had for the rent
at the common law by distres assyse or otherwise are determined / and the
party that ought to have the rent in conscience shall be driven to sue for his
remedy by Sub pena.


Doctor. I am content with thy conceyte in this matter for this time.


The.xvi. question of the student. The.xviii. Chapitre.
STudent. A vylleyne is granted to a man for term of life / the vylleyne
purchases lands to him and to his heirs / the tenant for term of life
enter the / in this case by the law he shall enjoy the lands to him and to
his heirs / whether shall he do so in like wise in conscienec.


Doctor. Me thinks it first good to se whether it may stand with
conscience that one man may claim an other to be his vylleyne / and that he
may take fro hi^ his lands and goods and put his body in pryso^ if he will /
it seems he loves not his neighbor as him self that does so to him.


Sudent. That law has been so long used in this realm and in other also /
and has been admitted so long in the laws of this realm and of diverse other
laws also and has been affermed by bisshoppes / abbotes / priors / and many
other men both spiritual and temporal which have take advantage by the said
law and have seized the lands and goods of their vylleyns thereby and call it
their right enheritaunce so to do: that I think it not good / now to make a
doubt ne to put it in argument whether it stand with conscience or not / and
therefore I pray the admittyng the law in that behalf to stand in conscience
show me thine opinion in the question that I have made.


Doctor. Is the law clear that he that has the vylleyne but only for the
term of life shall have the lands yt the vylleyne purchases in fee to him and
to his heirs.


Student. I verily I take it so.


Doctor. I would have take the law otherwise / for if a seygnoury be granted
to a man for term of life and the tenant attourne / and after the land
eschete and the tenant for term of life enters he shall have there none other
estate i^ the land than he had in the seygnourye / and me thinks that it
should be like law in this case / and that the lord ought to have in the land
but such estate as he has in the vyllayne.


Stud. The cases be not like / for in that case of the eschete the tenant for
term of life of the seygnourye has the lands in the lieu of the seignourie
/ that is to say / in the place of the seignourie / and the seignourie is
clearly extincte / but in this case he has not the land i^ the lieu of the
vylleyne / for he shall have the villeyne still as he had before / but he has
the lands as a profit come by means of the vylleyne which he shall have in
like case as the vylleyne had them / that is to say / of all goods and
catalles he shall have the hole property and of a lease for term of years he
shall have the hole term / and for term of life he shall have the same estate
/ the lord shall have the land during the life of the vyleyne and of land
in fee simple and of an estate tail that the vylleyne has / the lord shall
have the hole fee simple / all though he had the vylleyne but only for term
of years so that he enter or sease according to the law before the vylleyne
alien: or else he shall have nothing.


Doctoure. Verily and if the law be so / I think conscience folowethe the
law therein / for admyttynge that a man may with conscience have an other man
to be his hylleyne / the judgment of the law in this case as to termine what
estat the lord has in the land by his enter is neither against the law of
reason nor against the law of god / and therefore conscience must follow the
law of the realm / but I pray the let me make a little dygression to here
thine opinion in a another case somewhat perteynynge to the question / and it is
this if an executour have a vylleyne that is his testatoure had for term of
years and he purchases lands in fee and the executour enters in to the land
/ what estate has he by his enter.


Student. A fee simple / but that shall be to the behoue of the testatoure and
shall be an assesse in his hands.


Doctoure. Well than I am contented with thine conceyte at this time in this
case and I pray the proceed to a another question.


Ttudente. For as much as it appears in this case and in some other before yt
ye knowledge of the law of England is right necessary for the good ordering
of conscience. I would here thine opinion if a man mistake the law what
danger it is in conscience for the mistakynge of it.


Doctor. I pray the put some case in certain thereof that thou doutest in /
and I will with good will show the my mind therein for else it will be
somewhat long or it can be plainly declared / and I would not be tedious in
this writing.


The.xvii. question of the student. The.xix. Chapitre.
STudent. A man has a vylleyne for term of life the vylleyne purchases
lands in fee as in the case in the last Chapitre and the tenant for term of
life enters and after the vylleyne dies / he in the reuercion pretendynge
that the tenant for term of life has nothing in the land but for term of
life of the vylleine / asks counsel of one that shows him that he has
good right to the land and that he may lawfully enter / and through that
counsel he in the reuercion enters / by reason of the which enter great
suits and expenses follow in the law to the great hurt of both parties /
what danger is this to him that gave the counsel.


Doctor. Whether meanest thou that he that gave the counsel gave it
wyttyngly against the law / or that he was ignorant of the law.


Student. That he was ignorant of the law for if he knew the law and gave
counsel to the contrary I think him bound to restitucion both to him
against whom he gave the counsel / and also to his client if he would not
have sued but for his counsel of all that they be dampnified by it.


Doctor. Than will I yet ferther ask the this question / whether he of whom
he asked counsel gave him self to learning and to have knowledge of the law
after his capacite or that he took upon hi^ to give counsel and took no study
competent to have learning / for if he did so I think he be bounden in
conscience to restitucion of all the costs and damages that he sustained to
whom he gave counsel if he would not have sued but through his counsel.
And also to the other party / but if a man that has taken sufficient study
in the law / mystake the law in some poi^t that is hard to come to the
knowle of: he is not bounden to such restitucion / for he has done that in
him is / but if such a man knowing the law give counsel against the law:
he is bound in conscience to restitucion of costs and damages as thou have
said before / and also to make amends for the untruth.


Student. What if he ask counsel of one that he knowethe is not learned and
he gives him counsel i^ this case to enter by force whereof he enters.


Doctoure. Than be they both bound in conscience to restitucion / that is to
say / the party if he be sufficient and else the cou^sayloure because he
assented and gave counsel to the wrong.


Stude^t. But what is the counsaylloure in that case bounden to / to him that
he gave counsel to.


Doctoure. To nothing for there was as much defaut in him that asked the
counsel as in him that gave it / for he asked counsel of him that he knew
was ignorant / and in the other was defaut for the presumpcion that he would
take upon him to give counsel in that he was ignorant in.


Stud. But what if he that gave the counsel knew not but that he that asked
it had trust in him that he could and would give him good counsel and that
he asked counsel for to order well his conscience how be it that the truth
was that he could not so do.


Doct. Than is he that gave the counsel bounden to offer to the other amends
/ but yet the other may not take it in conscience.


Student. That were somewhat perilous for happily he would take it though he have
no right to it / except the world be well amended.


Doc. What thynkest thou in that amendment.


Sudent. I trust every man will do now in this world as they would be done to
/ speak as they think / restore where they have done wrong / refuse money if
they have no right to it though it be offered them do yt they ought for to do by
conscience / though they can not be compelled to it by no law and that none
will give counsel but that they shall think to be according to conscience /
and if they do: to do that they can to refourme it / and not to entremit them
self with such matters as they be ignorant in / but in such cases to send
them that ask the counsel to other that they shall think be more conning
than they are.


Doct. It were very well if it were as thou haste said / but ye more petie is:
it is not always so / and specially there is great defaute in gyuers of
counsel / for some for their own lucre and profit give counsel to
comfort other to sue that they know have no right / but I trust there be but
few of the^ / and some for dread / some for favor / some for malice / and
some upon confederacies and to have as much done for them a another time to
hyde the truth. And some take upon them to give counsel in that they be
ignorant in / and yet wha^ they know the truth: will not withdraw that
they have misdone / for they think it should be greatly to their rebuke / and
such persons follow not this counsel that says (That we have unadvisedly
done: let us with good advise revoke again)


Student. And if a man give counsel in this realm after as his lerninge and
conscience gives him / and regardethe not the laws of the realm / gives he
good counsel.


Doc. If the law of the realm be not i^ that case against the law of god nor
against the law of reason he gives not good counsel / for every man is
bound to follow the law of the country where he is / so it be not against
the said laws / and so may the case be that he may bind him self to
restitucion.


Student. At this time I will no ferther trouble the in this question.


The.xviii. question of the student. The.xx. Chapitre.
STudent. If a man of his mere mocion give lands to Henry heart and to his
heirs by indenture upon condition that he shall yearly at a certain day pay
to Iohanat Style out of the same land a certain rent / and if he do not that
than it shall be lawful to the said Johan at style to enter. etc. if the rent i^
this case be not paid to Johan at style / whether may the said Johan at style
enter in to the lands by conscience though he may not enter by the law.


Doctor. May he not enter in this case by the law sith the words of the
indenture be that he shall enter.


Stude^t No verelye for there is an ancient maxim in the law that no man
shall take advantage of a condition but he that is pertie or priuey to the
condition / and this man is not party nor priuey / wherefore he shall have none
advantage of it.


Doctoure. Though he can have none advantage of it as party yet because it
appears euidentely that the intent of the gyuer was that if he were not paid
of the rent that he should have the land. It seems that in conscience he
ought to have it though he can not have it by the law.


Student. In many cases the entente of the party is void to all intentes if
it be not grounded according to the law.

And therefore if a man make a lease to a another for term of life / and after
of his mere mocion he confermeth his estate for term of life / to remain
after his death to a another and to his heirs / in this case that remayndre is
void in law and conscience / for by the law there can no remayndre depe^de
upon no estate but yt the same estate begi^neth at the same time yt the
remai^dre does / and in this case the estate began before and the
confirmacion enlarged not his estate nor gave him no new estate / but if a
lease be made to a man for term of a another man's life and after the lessour
only of his mere mocion confermeth the land to his less for term of his
own life the remayndre over in fee / this is a good remayndre in law and
conscience / and so me thinks the intent of the party shall not be regarded
in this case.


Doctoure. And in the first case that thou have put me thinks though it pass
not by way of remayndre that yet it shall pass as by way of grant of the
reuercion / for every deed shall be taken most strong against the grau^tour and
the taking of the deed i^ this case is an attournament in it self.


Stude^t. That can not be / for he in the remayndre is not party to the deed
and therefore it can not be taken by way of grant of the reuercion / for no
grant can be made but to him that is party to the deed except it be by way
of remayndre / and therefore if a man make a lease for term of life / and after
the lessour grant to a stau^ger that the tenant for term of life shall have
the land to him and to his heirs / that grant is void if it be made only
of his mere mocion without recompense. And in like wise if a man make a lease
for term of life and after grant the reuercio^ to one for term of life / the
remayndre over in fee / and the renau^t atturneth to him that has the state
for term of life only / inte^dyng that he only should have advantage of the
grant: his intent is void / and both shall take advantage thereof / and the
atturnament shall be taken good according to the grant / and so in this case
though the feoffoure intended yt if the rent were not paid: that the
stranger should enter / yet because the law gyuethe him no enter in that case
that intent is void / and the same staunger shall neither enter into the land
by law nor conscience.


Doctor. What shall than be done with the land as thou thynkest after the
condition broken.


Student. I think that the feoffour in this case may lawfully reentre / for
when the feoffeme^t was made upon condition that the feoffe should pay a rent
to a stranger: in tho words is concluded in the law that if the rent were
not paid to the stranger that the feoffoure should reentre for tho words
upon condition / implie so much in the law though it be expressed. And than
wha^ the feoffour went ferther and said that if the re^t were not paid that
the stranger should enter / those words were void in the law / and so the
effect of the deed stood upon the first words whereby the feoffour may
reentre in law and conscience: but if the first words had not ben
co^dicionall I would have holden it the greater doubt.


Doctor. I pray the put the case thereof in certain with such words as be
not condicionall that I may the better perceive what thou meanest therein.


The.xix. question of the studente. The.xxi. Chapitre.
SSudent. A man makes a feoffement by deed indetted / and by the same deed it
is agreed yt ye feffe shall pay to A.B. and to his heirs a certain re^t yearly
at certain days / and yt if he pay not the re^t: tha^ it is agreed that A.B.
or his heirs shall enter into the land / and after the feoffe pays not the
rent / than the question is who ought in conscience to have this land and rent.


Doctoure. Or we argue what conscience will: let us know first what the law
will therein.


Student. I think that by the law neither the feoffoure ne yet the said A.B.
shall never enter into the land in this case for not paymente of the rent for
there is no reentre in this case given to the feoffour for not payment of the
rent as there is in the case next before / and the enter that is given to the
said A. B. for not payment thereof is void in the law because he is estrau^ge
to the deed as it appears also in the next Chapitre before.

And therefore me thinks that the greatest doubt in this case is to se to what
use this feoffement shall be taken.


Doctor. There appears in this case as thou haste put it: no consideracion ne
recompense given to the feoffour whereupon any use may be deriuied / and if the
case be so in deed and that the feoffour declared never his mind therein / to
what use shall it tha^ be taken.


Stu. I think it shall be taken to be to the use of the feoffe as long as he
pays the rent / for there is no reason why the feoffe should be busied with
payment of the rent having nothing for his labor / ne it may not conveniently
be taken that the intent of the feoffour was so / except he expressed it / and
tha^ it must be taken that he intended to reco^pense the feffe for the busynes
that he should have in the payment over / and by the words following his intent
appears to be so as me thinks / for if the re^t were not paid he would that
A.B. should enter / and so it seems he intended not to have any use him self
and thus as me seems this case should varye fro the common case of uses / that
is to say / if a man seized of land make a feoffement thereof: and it
apperethe not to what use the feoffement was made ne it is not upon any
bargayne or other recompense: than it shall be taken to be to the use of the
feoffoure / except the contrary can be proved by some bargain or other like
/ or that his intent at the time of the lyuerey of season was expressed that it
should be to the use of the feoffe or of some other / and than it shall go
according to his intent / but in this case me thinks it shall be taken that
his intent was that it should first be to the use of the feoffe for the cause
before reherced except the contrary can be proved / and so the knowledge of
the intent of the feoffour is the greatest certaynte for knowelege of the use
in this case as me seems / but wha^ the feoffour goes ferther and says that
if the rent be not paid: tha^ the said A.B. should enter into the land / tha^
it appears that his intent was that the rent should cease / and that A. B.
should enter into the land / and though he may not by those words enter
into the land after the rules of the law / and to have freholde / yet those
words seem to be sufficient to prove that the intent of the feoffour was that
he should have the use of the land / for sithe he had the rent to his own
use and not to the use of the feoffoure: so it seems he shall have the use of
the land that is assigned to him for not paymente of the rent.


Doctor. But I am somewhat in doubt whether he had the rent to his own use /
for the intent of the feoffour might be that he should pay the re^t for hi^ to
some other or some other use might be appointed thereof by the feoffour.


Student. If such an intent can be proved: than that intent must be observed /
but we be i^ the case to wete to what use it shall be taken if the intent of the
feoffour can not be proved / and tha^ me thinks it can not be otherwise taken
but that it shall be to the use of hi^ to whom it should be paid / for though
it be called a rent yet it is no rent in the law / ne in the law he shall
never have remedy for it / though it were assigned to him and to his heirs
with out condition / neither by distress / by Assyse / by writ of Annuite /
nor otherwise / but he shall be driven to sue in the chauncery for his remedy /
and than wha^ he sueth in the chauncery: he must surmitte that he ought to have
it by conscience / and that he can have no remedy for it in the law.

And than sithe he has no remedy to come to it but by way of conscience: it
seems it shall be taken that when he has recovered it that he ought to have it
in conscience and that to his own use without the contrary cane be proved /
and if the contrary can be proved: and that the intent of the feoffoure was
that he should dispose it for him as he should appoint than has he the re^t
in use to a another use / and so one use should be depe^dynge upon a another use
which is seldom seen and shall not be intended till it be proved / and so
sithe no such matter is here expressed: me thynkethe the rent shall be taken to
be to the use of hi^ that it is paid to / and that the land in likewise that
it is appointed to hi^ for not payment of the said rent shall be also to his use
/ how thynkest thou / will conscience therein.


Doctor. I think that as thou take the law now: that conscience (in this
case) and the law be all one / for the law sercheth the same thing in this
case to know the use that conscience does / that is to say / the intent of the
feoffour / and therefore I would move the ferther in one thing.


Student. What is that.


Doctoure. That sith the intent of the feoffour / shall be so much regarded i^
this case: why it ought not also to be as much regarded i^ the case that is i^
the last Chapitre next before this where the words be co^dicionall / and give
the feoffour a title of reentre / for me thinks that though the feoffour may
in that case reentre for the condition broken: that yet after his reentre he
shall be seized of the land after his enter to the use of him to whom the land
was assigned by the said indenture for lack of payment of the rent because the
intent of the feoffour shall be taken to be so in that case as well as in this.
And I pray the let me know thy mind what diversity thou put between them


Student. Thou dryuest me now to a narowe diversity / but yet I will answer
thy therein as well as I can.


Doctor. But first or thou show me that diversity: I pray the show me how
uses began / and why so much land has been put in use in this realm as has been.


Stud. I will with good will say as me thinks therein.


How uses of land first bygan / and by what law / and the cause why so much
land is put in use. The.xxii. Chapitre.
STudent. Uses were reserved by a secondary conclusion of the law of reason in
this manner / when the general custom of property whereby every man knew his
own good fro his neighbors was brought in among the people. It followed of
reason that such lands and goods as a man had: ought not to be taken fro him
but by his assent or by order of a law / and than sith it is so that every man
that has lands has thereby two things in him / that is to say / the
possession of the land which after the law of England is called the
franketenement or the free hold / and the other is authority to take thereby
the profits of the land / wherefore it follows that he that has land and
intends to give only the possession and free hold thereof to a another / and
to keep the profits to him self ought in reason and conscience to have the
profits / seeing there is no law made to prohibit / but that in conscience
such reseruacio^ may be made. And so when a man makes a feoffemente to a
another and inte^deth that he him self shall take the profits tha^ that feffe
is said seized to his use that so enfeffed him / that is to say / to the use
that he shall have the possession and freeholde thereof as in the law to that
intent that the feoffoure shall take the profits / and under this manner as I
suppose uses of land first began.


Doctor. It seems that the reseruyng of such use is prohibit by the law /
for if a man make a feoffeme^te and reserve the profits or any part of the
profits as the gresse wode or such other / that reseruacio^ is void in the
law / and me thynkethe it is all one to say that the law iugeth such a
thing if it be done to be void / and that the law prohibiteth that that
thing shall not be done.


Student Truth it is that such reseruacion is void in the law as thou
say and that is by reason of a maxim i^ the law that wylleth that such
reseruacion of part of the same thing shall be iuged void in the law / but yet
the law does not prohibit that no such reseruacion shall be made / but if it
be made it iugeth of what effect it shall be that is to say that it shall be void
/ and so he that makes such reseruacion offends no law thereby / ne brekethe
no law thereby and therefore the reseruacion in conscience is good / but if it
were prohibit by statute that no man should make such reseruacion / ne that
no feoffement of trust should be made / but that all feoffeme^tes should be to
the use of him to whom possession of the land is given / than the reseruacion
of such use against the statut should be void because it were against the
law / and yet such a statute should not be a statute against reason because
such uses were first grounded and reserved by the law of reason / but it
should prevent the law of reason and should put away the co^sideracion where
upon the law of reason was grounded before the statute made.

And than to thy other question / that is to say / why so much land has been put in use / it will be somewhat long and peradventure to some tedious to
show all the causes perticulerly / but the very cause whythe use remained to
the feffe natwithsta^dyng his own feoffement or fine and sometime
natwithstandynge a recovery against hi^ is al upon one co^sideracion after the
cause and intent of the gift / fine / or recovery / as is aforesaid.


Doctoure. Though reason may serve that upon a feoffement a use may be
reserved to the feoffour by the intent of the feoffour against the form of
his gift as thou have said before / yet I marvel how such an use may be
reserved against a fine that is one of the highest records that is in the law
/ and is taken in the law of so high effect that it should make an end of
all stryffes / or against a recouere that is ordained in the law for them that
be wronged to recover their right by / and me thi^keth that great enco^uenience
and hurt may follow when such records may so lightly be avoided by a secret
intent or use of the perties and by a nude and bare auerment and matter in deed
/ and specially sithe such a matter in deed may be aleged that is not true
whereby may rise great strife between the parties / and great confusion and
vncertaynte in the law / but nevertheless sithe our intent is not at this time
to treat of that matter I pray the touch shortly some of the causes why there
has been so many persons put in estate of lands to the use of other as there
has been / for as I here say / few men be sole seized of their own lands.


Student. There has been many causes thereof / of the which some be put away by
diverse statutes / and some remain yet / wherefore thou shalt understand that
some have put their land in feoffent secretly to the intent that they that
have right to the land should not know against whom to bring their accion /
and that is much what remedied by diverse statutes that give accio^s against
pernours and takers of the profits. And sometime such feoffeme^tes of trust
have been made to have mayntenaunce and berynge of their feoffes / which
peradventure were great lords or rulers in the countreye / and therefore to put
a way such mayntenaunce: treble damages be given by statute against the^ that
make such feoffementes for mayntenau^ce. And sometime they were made to the use
of mort main which might than be made with out forfayture though it were
prohibit that the freeholde might not be given in mortmayne. But that is put
away by the statute of Richard the second. And sometime they were made to
defraude the lords of wards / relyefs / harryots / and of the lands of their
vylleyns / but those poi^tes be put away by diverse statutes made i^ the time
of king Henry the.vii. Sometime they were made to avoid execucions upon
statutes Staple / Statute Marchau^te / and Recognisaunce / and remedy is
provided for that that a man shall have execucion of all such lands as any
person is seized of to the use of him that is so bound at the time of
execucion sued i^ the.xix. year of H. the.vii. And yet remain feoffementes /
fynes / and recoueres in use for many other causes / in manner as many as there
did before the said estatutes. And one cause is why they be yet thus used is
to put away tenauncy by the curtesy and tytles of dower. An other cause is for
that lands in use shall not be put in execucion upon a statute staple /
statute merchant / nor recognisaunce / but such as be in the hands of the
recognisour time of the execucion sued.

And sometime lands be put i^ use that they should not be put in execucion upon
a wryt of Extendi facias ad valencia^. And sometime such uses be made that he
to whose use. etc^. may declare his will thereon / and sometime for surety of
diverse couenauntes in indentures / of marriage / and other bargains / and these
two last articles be the chyefe and principal causes why so much land is put
in use. Also lands in use be no asses neither in a Fourmedone nor in an accion
of Det against the heir: ne they shall not be put in execucion by an Elegit
sued upon a recouere as some men say and these be the very chyefe causes as I
now remember why so much land stands i^ use as there does / and all the
said uses be reserved by the intent of the parties understand or agreed
between them / and that many times dyrectely against the words of feoffement /
fine / or recouere / and that is done by the law of reason as is aforesaid.


Doctor May not an use be assigned to a stranger as well as to be reserved to
the feoffour if the feoffour so appointed it upon his feoffement.


Student. yes as well / and in likewise to the feoffe and that upon a fre gift
without any bargayne or recompense if the feoffour so will.


Doctor. What if no feoffement be made but that a man grant to his feoffe
that fro thens forth he shall stand seized to his own use / is not the use
changed though there be no recompense


Student. I think yes for there was an use in Esse before the gift which he
may as lawfully give away as he might the land if he had it in possession.


Doc. And what if a man being seized of land in fee grant to a another of
his mere mocion without bargayne or recompense that he fro thens forth shall be
seized to the use of the other / is not that grant good.


Student. I suppose that it is not good / for as I take the law: a man can not
commence an use but by lyuerey of season or upon a bargayne or some other
recompense.


Doctoure. I hold me contented with that thou haste said in this Chaphitre for
this time and I pray the show me what diversity thou putteste between those
two cases that thou have before reherced in the xx. Chapitre and in the.xxi.
Chapitre of this present book.


Student. I will with good will.


The diversity between two cases here after following / whereof one is put in
the.xx. Chapitre and the other in the.xxi. Chapitre of this present book.
The.xxiii. Chapitre.
STudent. The first case of the said two cases is this. A man makes a
feoffement by deed indented upon a condition that the feoffe shall pay a
certain rent yearly to a stranger. etc^. and if he pay it not: that it
shall be lawful to the stranger to enter into the land. In this case I said
before in the.xx. Chapitre: that the stranger might not enter because that he
was not pryuey unto the condition. But I said that i^ that case the feoffour
might lawfully reentre by the first words of the indenture because they
implye a condition in the law and that the other words (that is to say) that
the stranger should enter be void in law and conscience. And therefore I said
ferther that when the feoffour had ree^tred that he was seized of the land to
his own use and not to the use of the stranger / though his intent at the
making of the feoffement were that the stranger after his enter should have had
the la^d to his own use if he might have entered by the law. And the cause why
I think that the feoffour was seized i^ that case to his own use I shall
show the afterward. The second case is this. A man makes a feoffement in
fee / and it is agreed upon the feoffement that the feoffe shall pay a yearly
re^t to a stranger / and if he pay it not: that tha^ the stranger shall enter
into the land.

In this case I said as it appears in the said.xxi. Chapitre / that if the
feoffe paid not the rent: that the stranger should have the use of the land
though he may not by the rules of the land enter into the land / and the
diversity between the cases me thynkethe to be this. In the first case it
apperethe as I have said before in the said xx. Chapitre / that the feoffour
might lawfully reentre by the law for not payment of the rent / and than wha^
he entered according: he by that enter avoided the first lyuery of season / in
so much that after the reentre he was seized of the land of like estate as he
was before the feoffemente.

And so remaynethe no thing / whereupon the stranger might ground his use /
but only the bare grant or entente of the feoffour wha^ he gave the land to
the feoffe upon condition that he should pay the rent to the stranger / and
if not / that it should be lawful to the stranger to enter / for the
feoffement is avoided by the reentre of the feoffour as I have said before /
and as I said in the last Chapitre as I suppose a nude or bare grant of him
that is seized of land is not sufficient to begin an use upon.


Doctor. A bare grant may change an use as thou thy self agredest in the
last Chapitre: why tha^ may not an use as well begin upon a bare grant.


Student. When an use is i^ Esse he that has the use may of his mere mocion
give it away if he will without recompense as he might the land if he had it
in possession / but I take it for a ground that he can not so begin an use
without a lyuerey of season or upon a recompense or bargayne / and that there
is such a ground in the law that it may not so begin it appears thus / it
has been always holden for law that if a man make a deed of feoffement to a
another and deliver the deed to him as his deed / that in that case he to whom
the deed is delivered has no title ne medelynge with the land before lyuerey
of season be made to him but only that he may enter and occupy the land at
the will of the feoffour / and there is no book says that the feoffour in
that case is seized there of before lyuerey to the use of the feoffe.

And in likewise if a man make a deed of feoffement of two acres of land that
lie in two shyres intendyng to give them to the feoffe and makes lyuerey of
season in the one shyre and not in the other / in this case is it commonly
holden in books that the deed is void to that acre where no lyuerey is made
except it lie within the view save only that he may enter and occupy at
will as is aforsayde / and there is no book that says that the feoffe should
have the use of the other acre / for if an use passed thereby than were not the
deed void to all intentes / and yet it apperethe by the words of the deed
that the feoffour gave the lands to the feoffe / but for lack of lyuerey of
season the gift was void and some thinks it is here without lyuerey of
season be made according. But in the second case of the said two cases the
feoffe may not reentre for non payment of the rent / and so the first lyuerey
of season continues and stands in effect / and thereupon the first use may
well begin and take effect in the stranger: of the land wha^ the rent is
not paid unto him according to the first agreement. And so me thinks that in
the first case the use is determined by cause the lyuerey of season where upon
it co^menced is determined / and that in the second case the use of the land
takes effect i^ the stranger for not payment of the re^t by the grant made
at the first lyuerey which yet continues in his effect / and this my
thi^keth is the diversity between the cases.


Doc. yet natwithstandyng the reason that thou haste made me thinks that if a
man seized of lands makethe a gift thereof by a nude promise without any
lyuerey of season or recompense to him made: and grant that he shall be seized
to his use: that though that promise be void in the law: that yet
nevertheless it must hold and stand good in conscience and by the law of
reason / for one rule of the law of reason is / yt we may do nothing against
the truth / and sith the truth is that the owner of the ground has
granted that he shall be seized to the use of the other: that grant must
needs stand in effect or else there is no troth in the grauntour.


Student. It is not against the truth of the grau^tour in this case though
by that grant he be not seized to the use of the other / but it proves that
he has granted / that the law will not waraunt him to grant / wherefore
his grant is void. But if the grauntour had gone ferther and said that he
would also suffer the other to take the profits of the lands without let or
other interupcion / or that he would make hi^ estate in the land when he
should be required / than I think in those cases he were bounden in conscience
by that rule of the law of reason that thou have remembered to perform them /
if he intended to be bounden by his promise / for else he should go against
his own truth and against his own promise. But yet it shall make no use in
that case / nor he to whom the promise is made shall have no accion in the
law upon that promise although it be not performed / for it is called in
the law a nude or a naked promise. And thus me thynkethe that in the first
case of the said two cases the grant is now avoided in the law by the
reentre of the feoffoure / feoffour / and that the feoffour is not bounden by
his grant neither in law nor conscience but that i^ the second case he is
bound / so that the use passethe from him as I have said before.


Doctoure. I hold me content with thy conceit for this time / but I pray the
show me somewhat more at large what is taken for a nude co^tracte or a naked
promise in the laws of England / and where an accion may lie there upon and
where not.


Student. I will with good will say as me thinks therein.


What is a nude contracte or naked promise after the laws of England / and
whether any accion may lie thereupon. The.xxiiii. Chapitre.
STudent. First it is to be understand that contractes be grounded upon a
custom of the realm and by the law that is called (Ius gentium) and not
dyrectely by the law of reason / for when all things were in common: it neded
not to have contractes / but after property was brought in: they were right
expediente to all people / so that a man might have of his neighbor that he
had not of his own / and that could not be lawfully but by his gift / by way
of lendynge / concord / or by some lease / bargain / or sale / and such
bargaynes and sales be called contractes / and be made by assent of the parties
upon agreement between them of goods or lands for money or for for other
recompense / but of money vsuell / for money vsuell is no contracte. Also a
concord is properly upon an agreement between the parties with diverse artycles
therein / some rysyng on the one pert and some on the other / as if Johan at
style lets a chamber to Henry heart and it is ferther agreed between them
that the said Henry heart shall go to board with the said Johan at style / and
the said Henry heart to pay for the chamber and bordynge a certain su^me.
etc^. this is properly called a concord / but it is also a contracte and a
good accion lies upon it / how beit it is not much argued in the laws of
England what diversity is between a co^tracte / a co^corde / a promise / a
gift / a love / or a pledge / a bargayne / a covenant / or such other / for
the intent / of the law is to have the effect of the matter argued and not
the terms / and a nude contracte is where a man makethe a bargayne or a sale
of his goods or lands without any recompense appointed for it. As if I say to
a another I sell the all my land or all my goods and nothing is assigned that
the other shall give or pay for it / that is a nude contracte / and as I take
it: it is void in the law and conscience / and a nude or naked promise is
where a man promyseth an other to give him certain money such a day or to
build him an house / or to do him such certain service / and nothing is
assigned for the money / for the building / nor for the service / these be
called naked promyses / because there is nothing assigned why they should be
made / and I think no accion lyethe in those cases though they be not
performed. Also if I promise to a another to keep him such certain goods
sauely to such a time / and after I refuse to take the^ there lies no accion
against me for it / but if I take them and after they be lost or empeyred
through my negligent keeping / there an accion lies.


Doctor. But what opinion hold they that be learned in the law of England in
such promyses that be called naked or nude promyses / whether do they hold
that they that make the promise be bounden in conscience to perform their
promise though they can not be compelled thereto by the law or not.


Student. The books of the law of England treat little thereof / for it is
lefe to the determinacion of doctoures / and therefore I pray the show me
somewhat now of thy mind therein / and than I shall show the therein somewhat
of the minds of diverse that be learned in the law of the realm.


Doctoure. To declare that matter plainly after the saying of doctoures: it
would ask a long time and therefore I will touch it briefly to give the
occasion to desire to here more therein here after. First thou shalt
understand that there is a promise that is called an aduowe / and that is a
promise made to god / and he that does make such a vow upon a deliberate
mind entendynge to perform it is bound in conscience to do it / though it
be only made in the heart without pronouncynge of words / and of other
promyses made to man upon a certain consideracion / if the promise be not
against the law.

As if A. promise to give B. xx. pound / because he has made him such a
house or has lent him such a thing or such other like / I think him
bound to keep his promise. But if his promise be so naked that there is no
manner of co^sideracio^ why it should be made / than I think him not bound to
perform it / for it is to suppose that there was some error in the making of
the promise / but if such a promise be made to an university / to a city /
to ye church / to the clergy / or to pore men of such a place / and to the
honor of god or such other cause like / as for mayntenaunce of learning / of
the common welthe / of the service of god / or in relyefe of poverty or such
other / than I think that he is bounden in conscience to perform it though
there be no co^sideracion of worldly profit that the grauntour has had or
ente^deth to have for it / and in all such promyses it must be understand
that he that made the promise intended to be bound by his promise / for else
como^ly after al doctoures he is not bound / oneles he were bound to it
before his promise. As if a man promise to give his father a gown that has
need of it to keep him fro cold / and yet thi^keth not to give it him /
nevertheless he is bound to give it for he was bound thereto before.

Also after some doctors a man may be excused of such a promise in conscience
by a casualite that comes after the promise if it be so that if he had known
of that casualite at the making of the promise he would not have made it. And
also such promyses if they shall bind they must be honest / lawful / and
possible / and else they are not to be holden in conscience though there be a
cause. etc. And if the promise be good and with a cause though no worldly
profit shall grow thereby to hi^ that makes the promise but only a
spiritual profit as in the case before rehearsed of a promise made to an
university / to a city / to the church / or such other and with a cause /
as to the honor of god other / there it is most commonly holden that an
accion upon those promises lies in the law canon.


Stu. Whether do thou mean in such promyses made to a university / to a
city / or to such other as thou haste reherced before / and with a cause / as
to the honor of god or such other. That the party shall be bound by his
promise if he intended not to be bounden thereby ye or nay.


Doctor. I thynk nay no more than upon promyses made unto common persons.


Student. And than me thinks clearly that no accion can lie against him upon
such promyses / for it is secret in his own co^cience whether he intended
for to be bound or nay. And of the entente inward in the heart: man's law
cane not judge / and that is one of the causes why the law of god is necessary
(that is to say) to judge inward things / and if an accion should lie in that
case in the law Canon / than should the law Canon judge upon the inward
intent of the heart / which can not be as me seems.

And therefore after diverse that be learned i^ the laws of the realm: all
promyses shall be taken in this manner. That is to say: If he to whom the
promise is made: have a charge by reason of the promise which has also
performed: than in that case he shall have an accion for that thing that was
promised though he that made the promise have no worldly profit by it. As if
a man say to a another / heel such a pore man of his dissease / or make such
an high way / and I shall give the thus much / and if he do it I think an
accion lies at the common law. And more over though the thing that he shall
do be al spiritual: yet if he perform it I think an accion lyethe at the
common law. As if a man say to a another / fast for me all the next Lent and I
shall give the.xx. pound / and he perfourmethe it / I think an accion lies
at the common law. And in like wise if a man say to a another mary my daughter
and I will give the.xx. pound. Upon this promise an accion lies if he mary
his daughter / and in this case he cane not discharge the promise though he
thought not to be bound thereby / for it is a good contracte / and he may have
Quid pro quo / that is to say / the prefermente of his daughter for his money.
But in those promyses made to an university or such other as thou have
remembered before / with such causes as thou have showed / that is to say / to
the honor of god / or to the increase of learning / or such other like /
where the pertie to whom the promise was made is bound to no new charge by
reason of the promise made to him but as he was bound to before / there they
think that no accion lies against hi^ though he perform not his promise /
for it is no contracte / and so his own conscience must be his judge whether he
intended to be bound by his promise or not. And if he intended it not: than he
offended for his dissimulacion only / but if he intended to be bound: than if
he perform it not: untruth is in him / and he proves him self to be a
liar which is prohibited as well by the law of god as by the law of reason /
and ferthermore many of that be learned in the law of England hold that a man
is as much bounden in conscience by a promise made to a common person if he
intended to be bound by his promise as he is i^ the other cases that thou
haste remembered of a promise made to the church / or to the clergy / or such
other / for they say that as much untruth is in the brekynge of the one as of
the other / and they say that the untruth is more to be pondered than the
person to whom the promyses be made.


Doctoure. But what hold they if the promise be made for a thing paste / as I
promise the.xl. pound for that thou have builded me such a house / lyethe an
accion there.


Stude^t. They suppose nay / but he shall be bound in conscience to perform it
after his entente as is before said.


Doctor. And if a man promise to give a another.xl. pound in recompense for
such a trespass that he has done him / lies an accion there.


Student. I suppose nay / and the cause is for that such promise be no perfect
contractes / for a contracte is properly where a man for his money shall have
by asse^t of the other party certain goods or some other profit at the time
of the contracte or after / but if the thing be promised for a cause that is
past by way of a recompense the^ it is rather an accord then a contracte / but
then the law is that upon such accord the thing that is promised in
recompense must be paid or delivered in hand / for upon an accord there
lies no accion.


Doct. But in the case of trespass whether hold they that he be bound by his
promise though he intended not to be bound thereby.


Student. They think nay no more the^ in the other cases that be put before.


Doct. In the other cases he was not bound to that he promised but only by
his promise / but i^ this case of trespass he was bound i^ conscience before
the promise to make recompense for the trespass and therefore it seems that he
is bound in conscience to keep his promise though he intended not to be
bounden thereby.


Stu. Though he were bound before the promise to make recompense for his
trespass yet he was not bounden to no su^me in certain but by his promise / and
because yt ye su^me may be to much or to little and not egal to the trespass /
and that the party to whom the trespass was done natwithsta^dyng the promise is
at lyberty to take his accio^ of trespass if he will therefore they hold that he
may be his own judge in conscience whether he inte^dyd to be bound by his
promise or not as he may in other cases / but if it were of a debt / then they
hold that he is bounden to perform his promise in conscience.


Docctoure What if in the case of trespass he afferme his promise with an oath.


Student Then they hold that he is bound to perform it for sauinge of his
outhe though he intended not to be bounden but if he intended to be bound by
his promise / then they say that an oath needs not but to enforce the promise
for they say he breketh the law of reason which is yt we may do nothing
against the truth / as well when he breketh his promise that he thought in
his own heart to be bound by as he does when he breketh his oath though the
offense be not so great by reason of the perjury more over to that thou sayste
that upon such promyses as thou have rehersyd before shall lie an accyo^ after
the law canon verylye as to yt in this realm there ca^ no accio^ lie thereon
in ye spiritual court if ye promise be of a temporal thing for a prohybicion
or a praemunire facias should lie in that case.


Doctor. That is marvel sith there can no accyon lie thereon in the kings
court as thou say thy self.


Student. That makes no matter / for though there lie no accion in the kings
court against executours upon a simple contracte / yet if they be suyd in that
case for the debt in the spiritual court a prohybicion lies. And in like
wise if a man wage his law untruly in an accyo^ of debt upon a co^tracte in
the kings court / yet he shall not be sued for that perjury in the spiritual
court / and yet no remedy lies for that periurye in the kings court / for
the prohybicion lies not only where a man is sued in the spiritual court of
such things as the party may have his remedy i^ ye kings court but also
where the spiritual court holds plee in such case where they by the kings
prerogative and by the au^cyent custom of the realm ought none to hold.


Doctor. I will take aduysement upon that thou haste said in this matter till
another time and I pray the now proceed to another questyon.


The.xx. question of the student. The.xxv. chapitre.
STude^t. A man has two sons / one borne before espousels and the other after
espousels and the father by his will bequetheth to his son and heir all his
goods which of these two sons shall have the goods in conscience.


Doctoure. As I said in our first dyalogue in latin the last chapitre / the
doubt of this case depends not in the knowing what conscience will in the
case / but rather in knowing which of the sons shall be iuged heir (that is
to say) whether he shall be taken for heir that is heir by the spiritual law
or he that is heir by the law of the realm / or else that it shall be Iuged for
him that the father took for heir.


Student. As to that point admyt the fathers mind not to be known or else
that his mind was that he should be taken for heir that should be iuged for
heir by that law that in these case it ought to be iuged by. And tha^ I pray
the show me thy mind therein / for though the questyon be not dyrectly
dependynge upon that point to se what consicence will in this case / yet it is
right expedient for the well ordering of conscience that it be known after
what law it shall be Iuged for if it ought to be iuged after the temporal law
who should be heir: than it were against conscience if the Iuges in the
spiritual law should Judge him for heir that is heir by the spiritual law
/ and I think they should be bound to restitucion thereby / and therefore I
pray the show me thyn oppinion after what law it shall be iuged.


Doctor. Me thinks that in this case it shall be iuged after the law of the
church / for it apperth that the byquest is of goods / and therefore if any
suit shall be taken upon the execucyon of the will for that bequest it must be
taken in the spiritual court and when it is dependynge in the spiritual
court me thinks it must be iuged after the spiritual law for of the
temporal law they have no knowledge / nor they are not bound to know it as
me thinks and more stronger not to judge after it. But if the byquest had been
of a chatell real as of a lease for term of years or of a ward or such
other then the matter should have come i^ debate in the kings court / and
the^ I think the iuges there should judge after the law of the realm and that
is that the younger brother is heir / and so me thinks the dyuersytye of the
courts shall make the dyuersytye of the judgment.


Student Of that might follow a great inconuenye^ce as me seems / for it
might be that in such case both chatels realle and chatels personel were in
ye will / and tha^ after thine opinion ye one son should have the chatels
personel: and the othersone the chatels real and it can not be co^uenyently
taken as me thi^keth but that the fathers will was that the one son should
have all and not to be divided. Therefore me thinks that he shall be iuged for
heir that is heir by the common law. And that the iuges spiritual in this
case be bound to take notyce what the common law is for sith the things that
be in varyaunce be temporal that is to say / the goods of the father / it is
reason that the right of them in this realm shall be determined by the law of
the realm.


Doctoure. How may that be for the Iuges spiritual know not the law of the
realm ne they can not know it as to the most part of it for much part of
the law is in such speech that few men have knowledge of it and there is no
means ne famylyarytye of study between them that learn the said laws / for
they be learned in several places and after diverse ways and after diverse
manners of techynges and in diverse speches and commonly the one of them have none
of the books of the other / and to bind the spiritual Iuges to give judgment
after that law that they know not / ne that they can not come to the knowledge
of / it seems not reasonable.


Stude^t. They must do therein as the kings Iuges must do when any matter
comes before them that ought to be Iuged after the spiritual law / whereof I
put diverse cases in our first dialoge in englyssh the.vii. chapitre / that is
to say / they must either take / knowledge of it by their own study / orelles
they must enquere of the^ that be learned in the law of the church what the
law is and in likewise must they do. But it is to doubt that some of them
would be loathe to ask any such questyon in such case / or to confess that
they are bound to give their judgment after the te^porall law and surely they
may lightly offend their conscience.


Doctoure. I suppose that some be of opynion that they are not bounden to know
the law of the realm and verelye to my remembrance I have not herd that
iuges of the spiritual law are bound to know the law of the realm


Stude^t. And I suppose that they are not only bounden to know the law of
the realm or to do that in them is to know it when the knowledge of it opens
the right of the matter that depends before the^ but that they be also
bounden to know where and i^ what case they ought to Judge after it / for in
such cases they must take the kings law as the law spiritual to that
point and are bounden in conscience to follow it as it may appear by diverse
cases whereof one is this. Two ioynttenauntes be of goods and the one of them
by his last will bequeteth all his part to a stranger and makes the other
ioynttenaunt his executor and dies / if he to whom the bequest is made sue
the other iointtenaunt / upon the legacy as executour etc. upon this matter
showed / the iuges of the spiritual law are bounden / to judge the will to be
void / by cause it is void by the law of the realm whereby the iointtenaunt
has right to the hole goods by ye title of the suruiuour and is iuged to have
ye goods as by the first gift which is before ye title of ye will and must
therefore have preferreme^t as ye elder title and if ye iuges of ye spiritual
court judge other wise: they are bound to restitucio^ and by like reason the
executours of a man that is outlawed the time of his death may dyscharge them
self in the spiritual court of the perfourmyng of legacyes / because they be
chargeable to the king and yet there is no such law of outlagary in the
spiritual law.


Doctoure. By occasyon of that thou haste said before I would ask of the this
question. If a parson of a church alyen a porcyon of dysmes according as the
spiritual law has ordained / is not that alienacion sufficient though it
have not the solempnities of the temporal law.


Student. I am in doubt therein if the portion be under the fourth part of the
value of the church but if it be to the value of the.iiii. part of the
church or above / it is not sufficient and therefore was the writ of right of
dysmes ordained / and if i^ a writ of right of dysmes it be Iuged in the
kings court for the patron of the successoure of hi^ that alieneth because
the alyenacyon was not made according to the common law / than the Iuges of
the spiritual law are bounden to give their judgment according to the
judgment given in the kings court. And in like wise if a parson of a church
agree to take a pencyo^ for the tithe of a mylle / if the pencyo^ be to the
fourth part of the value of the church or above / than it must be alyened
after the solempnytyes of the kings laws as lands and tenementes must / or
else the patron of the successoure of him that alyened may bring a wryt of
right of dysmes and recover in the kings court / and than the Iuges of the
spiritual court are bounden to give Judgment in the spiritual court
accordyngly as is aforesaid


Doccour. I have herd say that a wryt of right of dysmes is given by the
statute of westmynster. the second and that speaks only of dysmes and not of
pencion.


Student. where a parson of a church is wrongfully deforcyd of his dysmes and
is let by an Indicauit to ask his dysmes in the spiritual court than his
patro^ may have a writ of right of dysm^ and by the statute that thou spekest
of / for there lay none at the common law for the person had there good right
though he were let by the i^dicauit to sue for his right But when the person
had no remedy at the spiritual law there a writ of right of dismes lay for
the patro^ by the common law as well of pencyons as of dysmes / and some say
that in such case it lay of less than of the fourth part by the common law
but that I pass over. And the reason why it lay at the common law if the dysme
or pencyo^s were above the fourth part. etc. was this by the spiritual law
the alienacyo^ of the person with assent of the bisshope and of the chapitre
shall bar the successor without assente of the patron / and so the patron
might lose his patronage and he not assentinge thereto for his encu^bent might
have no remedy but i^ the spiritual court and there he was barred wherefore the
patron i^ that case shall have his remedy by the common law where the assent
of the ordinary and chapitre without the patron shall not serve as is said
before. But where the encumbent had good right by the spiritual law there lay
no remedy for the patron by the common law though the encumbe^t were let by an
indicauit / and for that cause was the said statute made and it lies as well
by the equity for offeringes and pensions as for dismes Than farther I would
think that where the spiritual court may hold ple of a temporal thing that
they must judge after the temporal law / and that ygnoraunce shall not excuse
them in that case for by taking of their office they have bound them self to
have knowledge of as much as belongs to there office as al Iuges be spiritual
and temporal. But if it were in argument in this case whether the eldest son
might be a priest by cause he is a bastard i^ ye temporal law that should be
iuged after ye spiritual law for ye matter is spiritual.


Doct. yet notwithstanding all the reasons that thou haste made I ca^ not se
how the iuges of the spiritual law shall be compelled to take notice of the
temporal law seeing that the most part of it is in the french tongue for it
were hard that every spiritual judge should be compelled to learn that tongue:
But if the law of the realm were set i^ such order yt they that i^tende to
study ye law cano^ might first have a sight of the law of the realm as they
have now of ye law civil and yt some books and treatises were made of cases of
conscience concerning those two laws as there be now concerning the law
civil and the law cano^ I would asse^t yt it were right expedye^t and tha^
reason might serve ye better yt they should be compelled to take notyce of the
law of the realm as they be now bounden in such countries as the law
civil is used to take notyce of that law.


Student Me thinks thine oppinion is right good and reasonable but till such
an order be taken they are bound as I suppose to enquere of them that be
learned i^ the common law what the law is / and so to give their judgment
according / if they will keep them self fro offense of conscience / and for as
much as thou haste well satisfied my mind in all these questions before. I
pray the now that I may so^what feel thy mind in diverse artycles that be
written in diverse books for the ordering of conscience upon the law canon and
civil / for me thinks that there be diverse conclusyo^s put in diverse books /
as i^ the su^mes called Summa angelica / and Summa rosella / and diverse other
for the good order of conscience that be against the law of this realm and
rather blind conscience tha^ to give any light unto it.


Docto. I pray the show me some of those cases


Student. I will with good will.


Whether an abbot may with conscience present to an aduouson of a church that
belongs to the house without assente of the covent. The.xxvi. chapitre.
Doctor. It appears i^ the chapitre Eanoscitur de hus que fiunt a prelates /
the which chapitre is recited in the sum called Summa angelica in the title
abbas the.xxvii. article that he may not without any costume or any special
privilege do help there iii.


Student. Truth it is that there is such a decretale / but they that be
learned in the law of England hold that decretale byndeth not in this realm
/ and this is the cause why they do hold that oppynyon. By the law of the
realm the hole disposicion of the lands and goods of the abbey is the abbot
only for the time that he is abbot and not in the covent / for they be but as
deed persons i^ the law and therefore the abbot shall sue and be sued only
without the coue^t do homage fealty atturne make leases and present to
aduousons only in his own name / and they say farther that this authority
can not be taken fro him but by the law of the realm / and so they say that
the makers of that decretale excedyd their power wherefore they say it is not to
be holden in conscience / no more than if a decre were made that a lease for
term of years or at will made by the abbot without the coue^te should be
immedyatly void / and so they think that the abbot may i^ this case present
i^ his own name without offense of conscience by cause the said decretale
holds not i^ this realm.


Doctoure. But many be of oppynyo^ that no man has aucthorytye to present in
right and conscience to any benefice with cure but the pope or he that has his
aucthorytye therei^ deriuied fro the Pope for they say that for as much as ye
Pope is the vycar general under god and has the charge of ye souls of all
people that be in the floke of Christ's church it is reason yt sith he cannat
ministre to all ne do yt is necessary to all the people for their soul health
in his own person that he shall assygne deputyes for his dyscharge i^ that
behalf / and because patrons claim to present to churches in this realm by
their own right without title deriuied fro the Pope they say that they usurp
upon the popes authority / and therefore they conclude that though the abbot
have title by the law of the realm to present i^ this case i^ his own name
that yet because that title is against the popes prerogative that that title ne
yet the law of the realm that mayntenyth that title holds not i^
conscience. And they say also that it belongs to the law canon to determine
ye right of presentme^t of benefices for it is a thing spiritual and
belongs to the spiritual iurisdiccio^ as the depryuacio^ fro a benefice does
and so they say ye said decretale bi^deth i^ co^scye^ce though i^ the law of
the realm it bind not.


Stude^t. As to thy first co^sideracion. I would right well agree that if the
patro^s of churches in this realm claymed to put encumbentes in to such
churches as should fall void of their patronage without prese^ting them to the
bishop or if they claymed that ye bhysshop should admit such encumbent as they
should present without any examinacion to be made of his abylite in that
behalf / that that claim were against reason and co^scye^ce for the cause
that thou have rehercyd but for as much as the patro^s i^ these realm claim
no more but to present their encu^bentes to the bishop and the^ the bishop to
examine the abylitie of the encumbe^t / and if he find him by the examinacyo^
not able to have cure of soul / he the^ to refuse hi^ and ye patron to
present another that shall be able / and if he be able tha^ ye bishop to admit
hi^ i^stitute hi^ and i^ducte him. I think yt this claim and their
presenteme^tes thereupon stand with good reason and conscience / and as to the
second consideracyo^ it is holden in the laws of the realm that the right of
prese^tement to a church is a temporal enherytau^ce and shall desce^de by
course of enheritau^ce fro heir to heir as lands and tenementes shall and
shall be taken as an asses as lands and teneme^tes be and for the trial of
the right of patronages be ordained i^ the law diverse accyo^s for the^ that be
wro^ged in that behalf as writtes of right of aduouson Assizes of ^aren
presentement Quare impedit and diverse other / which always without / time of
mind have been pledyd in the kings courts as things preteyning to his crown
and royal dygnytie / and therefore they say that in this case his laws ought
to be obeyed in law and conscience.


Doctoure. If it come in variaunce whether he that is so presented be able or
not able be whom shall the ability be tried.


Stude^t. if the ordinary be not party to the accyon it shall be tried be the
ordinary / and if he be party it shall be tried be the metropolitan.


Doctoure. Than the law is more reasonable in that point than I thought it had been but i^ the other point I will take aduisement in it till a another time /
and I pray the show me thy mind in these point if an abbot name his covent
with him in his presentacyon does that make the presentacion void in the law
or is the presentacyon good that not withstanding.


Student. I think it is not void therefore but the namyng of them is void and
a thing more tha^ needs / for if the abbot be disturbed he must bring his
accion in his own name without the couente.


Doctoure. Then I perceive well that it is not prohibit in the law of England
but that the abbot may name the covent i^ his presentacion with him / and also
take their assent whom he shall presenet if he will / and then I hold it the
surest way that he so do / for in so doing he shall not offe^de another in
law nor conscience.


Student. To take the asse^t of the coue^t whom he shall present and to name
them also in the presentacyon / knowing that he may do otherwise both i^ law
and conscience if he will / is no offense. But if he take their assent or name
them with him in the presentacyon thinking that he is so bound to do in law
and conscience / setting a conscience where none is / and regareth not the law
of the realm that will dyscharg his conscience in this behalf if he will so
that he present an able man as he may do without their assent / there is an
error and offense of conscynce in the abbot. And in like wise if the abbot
present i^ his own name / and therefore the covent says that he offends
conscience i^ that he observes not the law of the church for that he takes
not their assente / than they offend in iuginge him to offend / that
offends not And therefore the sure way is i^ this case to Judge both the said
laws of such effect as they be / and not to set an offense of conscience by
brekyng of the said decre which stands not i^ effect i^ this behalf within
this realm.


If a man find beasts in his ground doing hurt / whether may he by his
own authority take them and keep them till he be satysfyed for the hurt.
The.xxvii. Chapitre.
DOctoure. This question is made in the Su^me called summa rosella in the title
of restytucyo^ / that is to say restitucio.xiii. the.ix. article / and there
it is answered that he may not take them for to hold them as aplegd till he be
satisfied for the hurt: but that he may take them and keep them till he know
who owes them that he may thereby learn against whom to have his remedy. Is
not the law of the realm so in like wise.


Stude^t. No verily / for by the law of the realm: he yt in yt case has the
hurt may take the beasts as a dystresse and put them i^ a pound ouert so it
be within the same shyre / and there let them remayn till the owner will make
him amends for the hurt.


Doctor. what call thou apound ouerte.


Student. A pound ouerte is not only such pounds as be commonly made in
towns and lordshyppes for to put in beestes that be dystreyned / but it is
also every place where they may be i^ lawfully not maki^ge the own our an
offe^der for there being there and that it be there also that the owner may
lawfully give the beestes meat and dri^ke while they be i^ pound.


Doctor. And if they dye i^ pound for lake of mete whose ieopereye is it.


Stude^t If it be such a pound ouerte as I speak of it is at the peril of
him that owyth the beestes so that he that had the hurt shall be a liberty to
take his accion for the trespass if he will and if it be not a lawful pound
the^ it is at the peril of him that dystrayned / and so it is if he drive them
out of the shyre And they dye there.


Doctoure. I put case that he that owyth the beestes offer suffycye^t ame^des
and the other will not take it but keeps the beasts still in pound / may not
the over take them out.


Student. No for he may not be his own judge. And if he do an accyon lies
against him for brekyng of the pound / but he must sue a repleuyn to have his
beasts delivered him out of pound / and thereupon it shall be tried by.xii.
men whether the amendis that was offered were suffycie^t or not / and if it be
found that the offer was not suffycyent: than he that has the hurt shall
have such amends as the.xii. me^ shall asses.


Doctoure If it be found by the.xii. men that the amends were suffycent /
shall he that refused to take it have no punysshment for his refusell and for
keeping of the beestes in pound after that time.


Student. I think no / but that he shall yield damages in the repleuyn because
the issue is tried against him.


Doctoure. I put case that the beasts after that refusell dye in pound for
lack of meat at whose ieoperdie is it than.


Student. At the ieoperdie of him that owid the beasts as it was before for he
is bound at his peril by reason of that wrong that was done at the
beginning to se that they have meat as long as they shall be in pound: oneles
the kings writ come to deliver them and he resists it / for after that
time it will be at his ieoperdye if they dye for lack of meat and the
damages shall be recovered in an accion brought upon the statute for disobeynge
the kings writ.


Whether a gift made by one under the age of.xxv. year be good. The.xxviii.
Chapitre.
DOctoure. It appears in Summa angelica in the title donacio prima the.vii.
article that a man before the age of.xxv. year may not give without it be with
the authority of his tutoure. Is it not so likewise at the common law.


Student. The age of Infau^tes to give or selle their lands and goods in the
law of England at his.xxi. year / or above / so that after that age the gift
is good / and before that age it is not good / by whose assent so ever it be /
except it be for his meat and drink or apparel / or that he do it as
executour in perfourmaunce of the will of his testatour or in some other like
cases that needs not to be reherced here / and that age must be observed in
this realm in law and conscience and not the said age of.xxv. year.


Doctoure. I put case it were ordained by a decree of the church yt if any man
by his will bequethe goods to an other / and wills that they shall be
delivered to him at hes full age and yt i^ that case.xxv. year shall be taken
for ye full age shall not that decre be observed and stand good after the law
of England.


Stude^t. I suppose it shall not for though it belo^ge to ye church to have ye
probate and ye execucio^s of testame^tes made of goods and chatels except it
be in certain lordshypes and seygnories that have the^ by prescripcion / yet
the church may not as it seems determine what shall be the lawful age for any
person to have the goods for that belongs to the king and his laws to
determine / and therefore if it were ordained by a statute of ye realm that he
should not in such case have the goods till he were of the age of.xxv. year
that statute were good and to be observed as well in the spiritual law as in
the law of the realm and if a statute were good in that case / than a decre
made thereof is not to be observed / for the ordering of the age may not be
under two several powers / and one property of every good law of man is that
the maker excede not his authority / and I think that the spiritual Iuges in
that case ought to judge the full age after the law of the realm seeing that
the matter of the age concerns temporal goods / and I suppose ferther that
as the king by authority of his parliament may ordeyne that all wylles shall be
void and that the goods of every man shall be disposed in such manner as by
statute should be assigned: that more stronger he may appoynte at what age
such wills as be made shall be performed.


Doctoure. Thynkest thou than that the king may take away the power of the
ordinary that he shall not call executours to acco^pte.


Student. I am somewhat in dout theri^ / but it seems that if it might be
enacted by statute that all wills should be void as is aforesaid: that tha^
it might be enacted that no man should have authority to call none to account
upon such wills but such as the statute shall therein appoi^te / for he that
may do the more may do the less / not withstanding I will nothing speak
determinately in that point at this time / ne I mean not that it were good for
to make a statute that all wylles should be void / for I think them right
expedient / but mine intent is to prove that the common law may ordeyne the
time of the full age / as well in wylles of temporal things as otherwise / and
also that no will shall be made. And if it may so do: than much stronger it
belongs to the kings laws to interpretate wills concerning te^porall
things as well when they come i^ argument before his Iuges: as wha^ they come
in argument before spiritual Iuges and that they ought not to be iuged by
several laws (that is to say) by the spiritual iuges in one manner: and by
the kings iuges in another manner.


If a man be conuicte of heresye before the ordinari / whether his goods be
forfayth. The.xxix. Chapitre.
DOctoure. It appears in Summa angelica in the title Donatio prima the.xiii.
article / that he that is an heretyke may not make executoures / for in the
law his goods be forfet / what is the law of the realm therein.


Student. If a man be conuicte of heresy and abjure he has forfet no goods /
but if he be conuicte of heresye and be delivered to lay me^nes hands than
has he forfet all his goods that he has at the time that he is delivered to
them / though he be not put in execucion for the heresye / but his lands he
shall not forfet except he be deed for the heresye / and than he shall forfet
the^ to the lords of the fee / as in case of felony except they be holden of
the ordinary / for tha^ the king shall have the forfeture / as it appears by
a statute made the second year of king Henry the.v. the.vii. Chapitre.


Doctor. Me thynket that as it belongs only to the church to determine
heresies / that so it belongs to the church to determine what punissheme^t
he shall have for his heresye / except death which they may not be iuges in /
but if the church decre that he shall therefore forfet his goods me thi^keth
that they be forfet by that decre.


Student. Nay verily for they be te^porall and belong to the judgment of the
kings court and I think the ordinary might have set no fine upon none
empeched of heresye till it was ordained by the statute of Henry the.iiii. that
he may set a fine in that case if he se cause / and than the king shall have
that fine as in the said statute appears.


Where diverse patrons be of an auous^ and the church voydeth / the patro^s
vary in their presentementes / whether the bisshope shall have liberty to
present which of the encu^be^tes that he will or not The.xxx. Chapitre.
DOctoure. This question is asked in Su^ma rosella i^ ye title Patronus ye ix.
article and there it appears by the better oppinion that he may present
whether clerk he will / how be it the maker of the said sum / says that
by the / rigor of the law the bisshope in such case may present a stranger
because the patro^s agree not / and in the same chapitre patronus the.xv.
article. It is said that he must be preferred that has the most merits and
has the most part of the patrons. And if the nombre be egall / that than it
is to consider the merits of the patrons and if they be of like merit / than
may the bishop command them to agree and to present again. And if they can
not yet agree than the liberty to present is given to the bishop to take
which he will / and if he may not yet present without great trouble than
shall the bishop order the church in the best manner he can / and if he can
not order it / than shall he suspende the church and take away the relikes /
to the rebuke of the patro^s / and if they will not be so ordered than must he
ask help of the temporalitie / and in the.xv. article of the said title
Patronus / It is asked whether it be expedient in such case that the more
part of the patro^s agree having respect to all the patrons / or that it
suffice to have the more part in comparison of the less part as thus. There
be.iiii. patrons two present one clerk: the third presents another: and the
fourth another / he that is presented by.ii. has not the more part in
comparison of all patrons for they be egall / but he has the more part
having respect to the other presenteme^tes / to this question it is answered
that other the presentement is made of them that be of colage and there is
requisite the more part haui^ge respect to all the colage / or else every
man presents for him self as como^ly do lay men that have the patronage of
their patrimony / and than it suffiseth to have the more part in respect of
the other parts / does not the law of England agree to these diversities.


Stude^t. No verily


Doctor. What order than shall be taken in the law of England if the patrons
vary in their presentementes.


Student. After the laws of England this order shall be taken / if they be
ioyntenau^tes or tenauntes in common of the patronage / and they vary in
presentemente the ordinary is not bounden to admit none of their clerks
nether ye more part nor the less / and if the vi. months pass or they agree
the^ he may present by the laps. But he may not present within the.vi. months
/ for if he do they may agree and bring a Quare impedit against him / and
remove his clerk / and so the ordinary shall be as distourboure. And if ye
patrons have the patronage by disce^te as coperceners than is the ordinary
bound to admit the clerk of the eldest sister for the eldest shall have the
preferment in the law if she will / and than at the next auoydaunce the next
sister shall present and so by turn one sister after another till all the
systers or their heirs have presented / and than the eldest sister shall begin
again / and this is called a presentynge by turn / and it holds always
between coperceners of an aduouson / except they agree to present together / or
that they agree by co^posicion to present in some other manner / and if they do
so that agreement must stand / but this must be always except that if at the
first auoydaunce that shall be after the death of the common auncestre the king
have the ward of the longest daughter / that tha^ the king by his prerogative
shall have the presentement. And at the next auoydau^ce the eldest sister and
so by turn. But it is to understand that if after the death of the common
au^cestre the church voydeth and the eldest sister presented together with
another of the systers / and the other systers every one i^ their own name or
together that in yt case the ordinary is not bounden to receive none of their
clerks but may suffer the church to run in to the lapas as it is said
before for he shall not be bound to receive the clerk of the eldest sister
but where she presents in her own name. And in this case where the patrones
varye in presentement the church is not properlye said letigiouse so that the
ordinary should be bound at his peril to direct a writ to enquere (de Iure
patronatus) for that writ lies where two present by several titles / but
these patro^s present all in one title / and therefore the ordinary may suffer
it to pass if he will in to the laps / and this manner of presenteme^tes must
be observed in this realm in law and conscience.


How long time the patron shall have to present to a benefice. The.xxxi.
Chapitre.
DOctoure. These question is asked i^ Su^ma a^gelica i^ ye title Ius patrona^us
the.xvi. article / and there it is a^swered that if the patron be a lay man
that he shall have.iiii. months / and if he be a clerk he shall have.vi.
months.


Student. And by the common law he shall have.vi. months whether he be a lay
man or a clerk / and I se no reason why a clerk should have more respite than
a lay man: but rather the contrary.


Doctor. Fro what time shall the.vi. months be accounted.


Stude^t. That is in diverse manners after the manner of the voydance / for if the
church void by death / creacion / or cession: the.vi. months shall be co^pted
fro the death of the encumbent / or fro the creacion / or cession / whereof the
patron shall be compelled to take notice at his peril / and if the voydance be
by resignacion or depriuacion: than the.vi. months shall begin when the
patron has knowledge given him by the bishop of the resignacion or depriuacion.


Doctoure. what if he have knowledge of the resignacion or depriuacion and not
by the bisshope but by some other / shall not the six months begin: tha^ fro
the time of that knowledge.


Student. I suppose that it shall not begin till he have knowledge given him by
the bisshope.


Doctoure. An union is also a cause of voydaunce how shall the.vi. months be
rekened there.


Stude^t. There can no Union be made but the patrons must have knowledge / and
it must be appointed who shall present after that union / that is to say / one
of them or both / either ioi^tly or by tunre one after another as the agreement
is upon the vnio^ / and sithe the patron is privy to the auoida^ce and is not
ignorante of it: the.vi. months shall be accounted fro the agremente.


Doctor. I se well by the reason that thou haste made in this chapitre that
ignorance sometime excuses in the law of England / for in some of the said
auoydaunces it shall excuse the patrones as it appears by thy reasons above /
and in some it shall not / wherefore I pray the show me somewhat where ignorance
excuses in the law of England and where not after thine oppinion.


Student. I will with good will here after do as thou sayste if thou put me in
remembrance thereof. But I would yet move the somewhat ferther in such
questions as I have moved the before / concerning the diversities between the
laws of England and other laws / for there be many mo cases thereof that as
me seems have right great need for the good order of conscience of many
persons to be reformed and to be brought in to one oppinion both among
spiritual and te^porall / as it is in the case where doctors hold opinion
that ye statutes of laymen that restrain liberty to give lands to the
church should be void / and they say ferther that if it were prohibit by a
statute that no gift should be made to foreyns / that yet a gift made to the
church should be good / for they say that the inferior may not take away the
authority of the superioure and this saying is directly against the statutes
whereby it is prohibit that lands should not be given in to mortmayne / and
they say also yt byquestes and gifts to the church must be determined after
the law canon and not after the laws and statutes of lay me^ / and so they
regard much to whom the gift is made whether to the church or to make
causes / or to common persons / and bear more favor in gifts to the church
than to other / and the law of the realm beholds the thing that is given and
pretends that if the thing that is given be of lands or goods that the
determinacion thereof of right belongs in this realm to ye kings laws
whether it be to spiritual man or temporal / to ye church or to other / and
so is great division in these behalf when one prefers his opinion and
another his / and one this iurisdiccion / and another that and that as it is to
fere more of singularity tha^ of charity wherefore it seems that they yt have
the greatest charge over the people / specially to the health of their souls /
are most bound in conscience before other to look to this matter and to do yt
in them is in all charity to have it reformed / not beholdynge the te^porall
iurisdiccion nor spiritual iurisdiccion but the common welthe and quietenes of
the people / and that undoubtedly would shortly follow if this division were
put away / which I suppose verily will not be but that all men within the
realm both spiritual and te^porall be ordered and ruled by one law as to
te^porall things not wihstandynge for as much as the purpose of this writtyng
is not to treat of this matter therefore I will no ferther speak thereof at this
time.


Doctoure. Than I pray the proceed to another question as thou say thy mind
is to do.


Student. I will with good will.


If a man be exco^menged / whether he may in any case be assoyled without
making satisfaccio^. The.xxxii. Chapitre.
STudent. In the sum called Su^ma rosella in the title absolucio quarta ye
second article: it is said that he that is excommunicate for a wrong if he be
able to make satisfaccion ought not to be assoyled but he do satisfy / and that
they offend yt do assoyle him / but yet nevertheless he is assoyled / and if he
be not able to make amends that he must yet be assoyled / taking a
sufficient gage to satysfie if he be able here after / or else that he make
an oath to satisfy if he be able.

And these sayenges in many things hold not in the laws of England.


Doctoure. I pray the show me wheri^ the law of the realm varieth therfro.


Stude^t If a man be excommunicate in the spiritual court for det / trespass /
or such other things as belong to the kings crown and to his royal dignite
there he ought to be assoyled without making any satisfaccion / for the
spiritual court exceded their power in that they held ple in those cases and
the party if he will may thereupon have a Praemunire facias as well against the
party that sued him as against the judge and therefore in this case they ought
in conscience to make absolucion without any satisfaccion / for they not only
offended the party in calling him to answer before the^ of such things as
belong to the law of the realm: but also the king / for he by reason of such
suits may lose great aduauntages by the reason of the writtes originals /
judicials / fynes / amerciamentes / and such other things as might grow to
him if such suits had be^ taken in his courts according to his laws / and
according to his saying: it apperet in diverse statutes that if a man lay
violent hands upon a clerk and beat him / that for ye betynge ame^des shall be
made in the kings court / and for the layeng of violent hands upon the clerk
amends shall be made in the court cristie^. And therefore if the judge in the
court cristie^ would awarde the party to yield damages for the betynge: he did
against the statute / but admit that a man be excommenged for a thing that
the spiritual court may awarde the party to make satisfaccio^ of / as for the
not inclosinge of the church yard / or for not apparelli^ge of ye church
conveniently. Than I think the party must make restitucion or lay a
sufficient causion if he be able or he be assoyled / but if the party offer
sufficient ame^des and have his absolucion / and the judge will not make him his
letters of absolucion if the excommengemente be of record in the kings court
tha^ the king may writ unto the spiritual judge co^maundyng him that he make
the party his letters of absolucion upon pain of a contempt / and if the said
excommunicacio^ be not of record in ye kings court than the party may in
such case have his accion against the Judge spiritual for that he would not
make hi^ his lettres of absolucion but if he be not assoyled or if he be not
able to make satisfaccion and therefore the judge spiritual will not assoyle him
/ what the kings laws may do i^ tha case I am somewhat in doubt / and will
not much speak of it at this time / but as I suppose he may as well have his
accion in that case for the not assoylynge him as where he is assoyled and that
ye Judge will not make hi^ his letters of absolucion / and I suppose the same
law to be where a man is accursed for a thing that he judge had no power to
accurse hi^ in / as for debt / trespass / or such other.


Doctor. There he may have other remedies as a praemunire facias or such other
/ and therefore I suppose ye other accio^ lies not for hi^.


Student. The judge and the party may be ded / and tha^ no praemunire lies /
and though they were alive and were co^de^pned in a Praemunire / yet that should
not avoid the e^co^mengement / and therefore I think the accion lies specially
if he be thereby delayed of accions that he might have in the kings court if
the said exco^mengement had not ben.


Whether a Prelate may refuse a legaci. The.xxxiii. Chapitre.
STude^t. It is moved in ye said sum named Rosella in the title alienacio.
xx. the.xi. article whether a prelate may refuse a legaci / where in diverse
opynions be recited there / which as me thinks have need after the laws of
the realm to be more plainly declared.


Doctoure. I pray the show me what the law of the realm will therein.


Stude^t. I think yt every prelate and suffereyn that may only sue and be
suyd in his own name as Abbates* Priours: and such other may refuse any
legaci that is made to the house: for the legacy is not perfyte till he to
whom it is made assent to take it: for else if he might not refuse it he might
be compelled to have lands whereby he might in some case have great loss but
than if he intend to refuse he must as soon as his title by the legacy
falls relinquisshe to take the profits of the thing bequethe / for if he
ones take the profits thereof he shall not after refuse the legaci: but yet his
successor may if he will refuse the taking of the profits to save the house
fro yeldynge of damages or fro arrerages of rentes if any such be: and like
law is of a remayndre as is in legaci: for though in the case of a remaindre
and also of a devise as most men say the freholde is cast upon him by the
law when the remayndre or devise falls: yet it is in his liberty to refuse
the taking of the profits and to refuse the remai^dre or devise if he will as
he might do of a gift of lands or goods for if a gift be made to a man
that refuses to take it / the gift is void: and if it be made to a man that
is absent the gift takes not effect in him till he assent: no more than if a
man dissease one to another man's use / he to whose use the disseason is made
has nothing in that land ne is no disseasoure till he agree. And to such
disseasons and gifts an Abbot or Priour may disagre as well as any other man
but after some men a Bisshope of a devise or remayndre that is made to the
Bishop and to the deane and chapitre nor a deane and a chapitre of a devise or
remayndre made to the^ ne yet the master of a colage of such a devise or
remayndre made to hi^ and to his brethren / may not disagre without the
chapitre or brethren for the Bisshoppe of of such lands as he has with the
deane and chapitre: ne the deane nor master: of such land as they have with
the chapitre or brethren may not answer without ye chapitre and brethren:
and therefore some say that if the deane or master will refuse or disclayme in
the lands that they have by the devise or remaindre that that disclaymour
without the chapitre or bretherneis void. And therefore it is holde^ in the law
that if a Bisshope be vouched to warra^tie and the tenant byndeth hi^ to the
warra^tye by reason of a lease made to him by ye Bisshope and by the deane and
the chapitre yelding a rent / that in that case the Bisshoppe may not
disclayme in that reuercion without the assent of the deane and chapitre. But
yet if a reuercion were granted to a deane and a chapitre and the deane refuse
/ the grant is void / and so it appears that a deane may refuse to take a
gift or grant of lands or goods or of a reuercion made to him and to the
chapitre and that yet he may not disagre to a remai^dre or devise / and the
diversity is because the remayndre and devise be cast upon him without any
assent / whereunto nether the deane nor the chapitre by them self may in no
wise disagre without the assent of the other / but a gift or grant is not
good to them without they both asse^t and in such gifts as I suppose an
Infaunt may disagre as well as one of full age / but if a woman covert disagre
to a gift and the husband agree that gift is good.


Doctoure. what if the lands in that case of a man and his wife be charged
with damages or be charged with more rent than the land is worth / and the
husband dye shall the wife be charged to the damages or to the rent.


Stude^t. I think nay if the wife refuse the occupacion of the ground after
her husband death / and I think the same law to be if a lease be made to the
husband and to the wife yelding a greater rent tha^ the land is worth that
the wife after the husbands death may refuse the lease to save her fro the
payment of the rent / and so may ye successor of an Abbot.


Docto. And if the husband in that case ouerliue the wife and than make his
executours and dye / whether may his executours in likewise refuse the lease.


Student. If they have goods sufficient of their testatoure to pay the rent I
think they may not refuse it / but if they have no goods sufficient of their
testatours to pay the rent to the end of the term / I think if they
relinquisshe the occupacion they may by special pleedynge discharge them self
of the rent and the lease / and if they do not they may lightly charge them
self of their own goods. And if a lease be made for term of life the
remayndre to an Abbot for term of the life of Johan at style / reserving a
greater rent than the land is worth / and after the tenaunte for term of
life dies the Abbot may refuse the remayndre for the cause before reherced /
and in case that the Abbot assent to the remaindre whereby he is charged to ye
re^t during the time that is Abbot / and after he dies or is deposed living
the said Ioha^ at style / in that case his successoure may discharge him self
by refusinge the occupacion of the land as is aforesaid. But I think that if
such a remayndre were made to a deane / and to the chapitre / and the deane
agree without the assent of the chapitre yt in that case the deane and the
chapitre may afterward disagre to the remayndre: and that the act of the
deane without ye asse^t of the chapitre shall not charge the chapitre i^ yt
behalf / and thus it appears though the meaning of the said chapitre and
article in the said sum be / that a prelate may not disagre unto a legacy
for hurti^ge of the house / yet he may after the laws of the realm disagre
thereto where it should hurt his house. And if in a Precipe quod reddat there
be but one tenant be he spiritual or temporal / and he refuse by way of
disclaymoure in such case where he may disclayme by the law / there the
land shall vest in the demaundaunt / and if there be two tenauntes than it
shall vest in his fellow / if he will take the hole tenau^cie upon him or else
it shall vest in the demaundaunte. But if an Abbot or a lay man refuse the
taking of the profits / and show a special cause why it should hurt him if
he did assente and be thereby discharged as is said before / In whom the
land shall than vest it is more doubt whereof I will no ferther speak at this
time. And thus it appears by diverse of the cases that be put in this chapitre
that he that is ignorant in the law of the realm / shall lack the true
judgment of conscience in many cases / For in many of these cases that that
may be done therein by the law must also be observed in conscience. etc^.


Whether a gift made under a condition be void if the sovereign only break
the condition The.xxxiiii. Chapitre.
SLudent. In Su^ma rosella in the title alienacio / the.xii. article is asked
this question whether a gift made under a certain form may be avoided or
revoked because the prelate or souereyne only did break the form / and it is
there answered that it may not for that the deed of the prelate only ought not
to hurt the church / and if those words under a manner be understand of a
gift upon condition as they seem to be / than the said solucion holds not in
this realm nether in law nor conscience.


Doctoure. What is than the law of England if a man enfeffe an Abbot by deed
intented upon condition that if the Abbot pay not to the feffoure a certain
some of money at such a day / that than it shall be lawful to the feoffour to
reentre / and at yt day ye Abbot fails of his payment may the feoffer
lawfully reentre and put out the Abbot.


Student. ye verily for he had no right to the land but by the gift of the
feffour and his gift was condicionell and therefore if the condition be broken
it is lawful by the law of England for the feffoure to reentre and to take
his land again and to hold it as in his first estate by which reentre after
the laws of the realm he disproueth the first lyuerey of season and all the
mean acts done between the first feffement and the ree^tre / and it forces
little in the law in whom the defaute be that the condition was not performed
whether in the Abbot or in his coue^t or i^ both / or in any other person
what so ever he be: except it be in the feffoure himself. And it is great
diversity between a clear gift made to an Abbot without co^dicio^ / and where
it is made with co^dicto^ / for when it is made without co^dicio^ the act of
the Abbot only shall not by the common law disherite the house but it be in
very few cases / but yet upon diverse statutes the sufferau^ce of the Abbot
only may disherite the house as by his cesser / or by leuieng of a cross
upon a house against the statute thereof made / in which case the house thereby
shall lose the land / and some say that by the common law upon his disclaymour
in auourie a writ of right of disclamour lies / but if the gift be upon
condition it stands nether with law nor conscience that the Abbot should have
any more perfect or sure estate than was given unto hi^ / and therefore as the
said estate was made to the house upon co^dicio^ so that estate may he avoided
for not performyng of the condition / and I think verily yt this that I have
said is to beholde^ in this realm both in law and conscience / and that the
decrees of the church to the contrari bind not in this case. But if lands be
given to an Abbot and to his coue^t to the intent to find a la^pe / or to give
certain alms to poor me^ / though the intent be not in those cases fulfilled
/ yet ye feoffer nor hes heirs may not ree^tre for he reserved no reentre by
express words / ne in the words wha^ he says the entente to find a lamp
or to give alms. etc^. Is employed no reentre / ne the feoffoure nor his heirs
shall have no remedy in such cases / onelesse it be within the case of the
statute of Westmynster the second that gives the Cessau^t de cantaria.


Whether a covenant made upon a gift to the church that it shall not be
aliened (be good.) The.xxxv. Chapitre.
STudent. In the said sum called Summa rosella in the said title alienacio
/ the.xiii. article is asked these question / whether a covenant made upon a
gift to the church that it shall not be aliened be good. And the same question
is moved again in the said sum called rosella / in the title condicio the
first article and in Summa angelica / in the title Donatio prima / the.li.
and.lii. articles / and the inte^te of the question there is: whether not
withstanding that the condition be good to some alienacions whether that yet
it be good to restrain alienacions for the redemption of them that be in
captivity under the infideles or for the greater advantage to the house / and
though the better opinion be there that the condition may not be broken for
redemption of them that be in captivity: yet it is in manner a hole opinion that
it may be sold for the greater advantage to the house / for it is said there
that it may not be taken but that the intent of the gyuer was so / and
therefore they call the condition that prohibiteth it to be sold (condicio
turpis) that is to say / a vile condition / wherefore they regard it not: but
verily as I take it if a condition may restrain any manner of alienacion than
it shall as well restrain alienacions for the two causes before reherced as
for any other causes / and though me thinks that that condition is good
after the laws of the realm that upon gifts to the church restrayneth
alienacions: yet I shall touch one reason that is made to the contrary / that
is this. There is a clear ground in the law that if a feoffement be made to a
common person in fee upon condition that the feoffe shall not alie^ to no man:
that that condition is void because it is contrary to the estate of a fee
simple to bind him that has that estate that he should not aliene if he list
/ and some say that an Abbot that has land to him and to his successors has
as high and as perfect a fee simple as has a lay man yt has land to him and
to his heirs / and therefore they say that it is as well against the law of the
realm to prohibit that the Abbot shall not alien as it is to prohibit a lay
man thereof / and though it be therein true as they say as to the hyghnes of the
estate: yet me thinks there is great diversity between the cases concerning
their alienacio^s / for when lands be given in fee simple to a common person:
the intent of the law is that the feoffe shall have power to aliene / and if
he do aliene it is not against the intent of the law ne yet against the intent
of the feoffer / but when lands be given to an Abbot and to his successors
the intent of the law is and also of the gyuer as it is to presume that it
should remain in the house for ever / and therefore it is called mortmayne /
that is to say a ded hand as who says that it shall abide there always as a
thing ded to the house. And therefore as I suppose the law will suffer yt
co^dicio^ to be good yt is made to restrain that such mortmayne should not be
aliened and that yet it may prohibit the same condition to be made upon a
feoffeme^t made in fee simple to a man and to his heirs for that is the most
high / the most free and the most purest state that is in the law. But the
law suffers such a condition he made upon a gift in tayse because the
statute prohibiteth that no altenacion should be made thereof. And than as the
law suffers such a condition upon a gift in mort main / that is to say /
that it shall not be aliened / to be good / than it iugeth the condition also
according to the words / that is to say / if the condition be general that
they shall aliene to no man as this case is that it shall be taken generaly
according to the words / and it shall not be taken yt the intent of the gyuer
was otherwise tha^ he expressed in his gift though percase if he were alive him
self and ye question where asked hi^ whether he would be co^te^ted it should be
alieued for ye said two causes or not / he would say ye / but wha^ he is ded no
man has authority to i^terpretate his gift otherwise tha^ ye law suffers /
ne otherwise tha^ ye words of ye gift be. And if ye co^dicio^ be special yt is
to say / that the land shall not be aliened to such a man or such a man /
tha^ the co^dicio^ shall be taken according to the words / and tha^ they may be
aliened as for that condition to any other but to them to whom it is
expresselie prohibit that the land should not be aliened to. And if the lands
in that case be aliened to one that is not except in the condition / than he
may aliene the land to him that is first excepted without brekynge of the
condition / for conditions be taken straytely in the law and without equity.
And thus me thinks that because ye said condition is general and
restreyneth all alienacions / that it may not be aliened nether by the law of
the realm ne yet by conscience / no more for the said two causes than it may
for any other cause / and this case must of necessity be iuged after the
rules and grounds of the law of the realm and after no other law as me
seems.


If the patron present not within.vi. months who shall present. The.xxxvi.
Chapitre.
STudent. In the said sum called Summa rosella in the title Beneficio in
principio it is asked / if the patron present not within.vi. months who shall
present and within what time the presentement must be made. And it is answered
there that if the patro^ present not within vi. months that the chapitre
shall have. vi. months to present / and if the chapitre present not
within.vi. months that tha^ ye Bisshope shall have other.vi. months. And if
he be necligent / than the Metropolitan shall have other.vi. months / and if
he present not than the presentement is deuolute to the Patriarch. And if the
metropolitan have no superior under the Pope / than the presenteme^t is
deuolute to the Pope. And so as it is said there the archebisshope shall
supplye the necligence of the Bisshope if he be not exempte / and if he be
exempte the presentement immediately shall fall fro the Bisshope to the Pope. An
as I suppose these diversities hold not in the laws of the realm.


Doctor. Tha^ I pray the show me who shall present by ye laws of the realm
if the patron do not present within his.vi. months.


Stude^t. Than for defaute of the patron the Bisshope shall present / oneles
the king be patron / and if the Bishop present not within vi. months / than
the metropolitan shall present whether the Bisshope be exempte or not. And if
the metropolitan present not within the time limited by the law / than
there be diverse oppinions who shall present / for some say yt the Pope shall
present / as it is said before / and some say ye ki^ge shall present.


Doctoure. what reason make they that say the king should present in that case.


Stude^t. This is their reason they say that the king is patron peramounte
of all the benifices within the real me. And they say further that the king
and his progenitors kings of England without time of mind have had
authority to determine the right of patronages in this realm in their own
courts / and are bounden to se their subjects have right in that behalf
within the realm / and that in that case fro him lies no appele. And than
they say that if the Pope in this case should present that than the king
should not only lose his patronage peramounte / but also that he should not
sometime be able to do right to his subjects.


Doctoure. In what case were that.


Student. It is in this case / the law of the realm is / that if a benefice
fall void / that ye patron shall present within.vi. months: and if he do
not that tha^ the ordinary shall persent but yet ye law is ferther i^ yt case
that if the patro^ present before the ordinari put in his clerk: that tha^
the patro^ of right shall inioye his presentement / and so it is / though the
time should fall after to the metropolitan or to the Pope / and if the
presentement should fall to the Pope / than though the aduouson abode still
void / so that ye patron might of right present / yet the patron should not
know to whom he should present / oneles he should go to the Pope / and so he
should fail of right within the realm. And if percase he went to the Pope and
presented an able clerk unto him / and yet his clerk were refused and another
put in at the collacio^ of the Pope or at the presentement of a stranger yet
the patron could have no remedy for that wrong within the realm / for the
encumbente might abide stille out of the realm. And therefore the law will
suffer no title in this case to fall to the Pope.

And they say that for alyke reason it is that the law of the realm will not
allow an exco^mengeme^t that is certified in to the kings court under ye popes
bulls. For if the party offered sufficient ame^des / and yet could not
obtain his letters of absolucion / the king should not know to whom to writ
for the letters of absolucio^ / and so the party could not have right / and
that the law will in no wise suffer.


Doctoure. The patron in that case may present to the ordinary as long as
the church is void / and if the ordinary accept him not / the patron may
have his remedy against him within the realm. But if the Pope will put in an
encumbe^t before the patron present / it is reason that he have the
preferme^te as me seems before the king.


Student. When the ordinary has surcessed his time he has lost his power as
to yt presentement / specially if the collacion be deuolute to the pope. And
also when the presentement is in the Metropolitan he shall put in the clerk
him self and not the ordinary / and so there is no defaute in the ordinary
though he present not the clerk of the patron if his time be past / and so
there lies no remedy against him for the patron.


Doctor. Though the encumbe^t abide still out of the realm yet may a Quare
impedit lie against him within the realm / and if the encu^bent make defaute
upon the distress and appear not to show his title: than the patron shall have
a writ to the Bisshope according to the statute / and so he is not without
remedy.


Stude^t. But in this case he can not be sommoned / attached / nor distrayned /
within the realm.


Doctoure. He may be somoned by the church as the tenant may in a writ of
right of auouson.


Student. There the auouson is in demand / and here the presentement is only
in debate / and so he can not be somoned by the church here no more than if it
were in a writ of annuitie / and there the common return is (quod clericus
est and beneficiatus non habens laicum feodum vbi potest summoniri). And
though he might be somoned in the church / yet he might nether be attached nor
distrayned there / and so the patron should be without remedy.


Doctoure. And if he were with out remedy / he should yet be in as good case
as he should be if the king should present / for if the title should be given
to the king the patron had lost his presentement clearly for yt time though
the church abide still void. For I have herd say that in in such
presentementes no time after the law of the realm renneth unto the king


Stude^t. That is true / but there the presentement should be taken fro him by
right and by the law and here it should be taken fro him against the law /
and there as the law could not help him and that the law will not suffer.


Doctoure. yet me thinks always yt the title of the laps i^ such case is given
by the law of the church and not by the te^porall law / and therefore it
forseth but littell / what the temporal law will in it as me seems.


Student. In such countries where the Pope has power to determine the right
of temporal things I think it is as thou say / but in this realm it is
not so. And the right of presentement is a temporal thing and a temporal
enheritaunce / and therefore I think it belongs to the kings law to
determine / and also to make laws who shall present after the.vi. months /
as well as before / so that the title of examinacion of ability or none
ability be not thereby taken fro the ordinaries / and in likewise it is of
auoydau^ce of benefices / that is to say / that it shall be iuged by the kings
laws when a benefice shall be said void and wha^ not / and not by the law of
the church as when a person is made a Bisshope or accepts another benefice
without license / or resigneth / or is deprived in these cases the common law
says that the benefices be void and so they should be though a law were made
by the church to the contrary / and so if the Pope should have any title in
this case to present / it should be by the law of the realm. And I have not
seen ne herd that the law of the realm has given any title to ye Pope to
determine any te^porall thing that may be lawfully determined by the kings
court.


Doctoure. It seems by that reason that thou haste made now that thou
preferrest the kings authority in presenteme^tes before the Popes / and that
me thinks should not stand with the law of god: sith the Pope is the vicar
general under god.


Stude^t That I have said proves not that / for ye highest preferme^t in
presenteme^tes is to have authority to examine the abylitie of the person that
is presented / for if the present be able / it suffiseth to the discharge of
the ordinary / by whom so ever he be presented and that authority is not
denied by the law of the realm to belo^ge always to ye spiritual iurisdiccio^
/ but my meaning is that as to the right of presentementes and to determine who
ought to present and who not and at what time / and wha^ the church shall be
iuged to be void and wha^ not / belongs to the king and his laws / for
else it were a thing in vain for him to hold ple of aduousons or to
determine the right of patronage in his own courts and not to have
aucthorite to determyne the right thereof / and these claymes seems not to be
against the law of god. And so me seems in this case the presentement is
given the king.


Doctor. And if the king should have right to present than might the church
happen to continue void for ever for as we have said before no time renneth
to the king in such presentementes.


Student. If any such case happen if the king present not than may the
ordinary set in a deputy to serve the cure as he may do wha^ neclige^ce is in
other patrons that may present and do not / and also it can not be thought
that the king which has the rule and governance over the people not only of
their bodies but also of their souls will hurt his conscience and suffer a
benefice continually to stand without a curate no more than he does in
auousons that be of his own presentemente.


Whether the presentement and collacio^ of all benefices and dignities voydynge
at Rome belong only to the Pope The.xxxvii. Chapitre.
STudent. In the said sum called Summa rosella in the title Beneficiu^
primum / i^ the.xiii. article. It is said that benefices / dignities / and
personages / voydynge in the court of Rome may not be given but by the Pope
and likewise of the Popes servants and of other that come and go fro the
court if they dye in places nigh to the court within two days journey all
these belong to the Pope / but if the Pope present not within a month: than
after the month they to whom it belongs to present may present by them
self only or by their vicar general if they be in far parties and these
saynges hold not in the laws of the realm.


Doctoure. what is the cause that they hold not i^ this realm as well as in
all other realms.


Stude^t One cause is this. The king i^ this realm according to the au^cie^t
right of his crown / of all his aduousons that be of his patronage owes to
present. And in likewise other patrons of benefices of their presentement / and
the plee of the right of presentementes of benefices within this realm belong
to the king and his crown. And these titles can not be taken fro the king and
his subjects but by their assent / and so the law that is made therein to put
away that title byndeth not in this realm / and over that before the statute
of.xxv. of Edward the.iii there was a great inconuenie^ce and mischief by
reason of diverse prouisio^s and reseruacio^s that the Pope made to benefices in
this realm co^trari to the old right of ye king and other patrons in this
realm as well to archebisshopryches / Bisshopryches / deauries / and Abbes: as
to other dignities and benefices of the church. And many times alie^s thereby
had benefices within the realm yt understood not the englisshe tongue / so that
they could not counsel ne conforte the people when need required / and by
that occasion great riches was co^uayed out of the realm / wherefore to avoid
such inconveniences: it was ordained by the said statute that all patro^s as
well spiritual as te^porall should have their presenteme^tes freely / and in
case yt collacio^ or provision were made by the Pope in disturbau^ce of any
spiritual patro^: that tha^ for that time the king should have the
presenteme^t / and if it were i^ disturbau^ce of any lay patro^: that tha^ if
the patro^ presented not within the half year after such voyda^ce: nor the
Bisshope of the place within a month after the half year: that tha^ the king
should have also the presentement / and yt the king should have the profits of
the benefices so occupied by provision except abbes and priours and other
houses that have colage and coue^t / and there the colage and coue^t to have
the profits / and because the statute is general and excepteth not such
benefices as shall void in the court of Rome or in such other place as
before appears / therefore they be taken to be within the provision of the said
estatute as well as the benefices that void within the realm / and all
prouisours and executours of the said collacio^s and prouisio^s and al their
atturneys / notaries / and mainteners shall be out of the proteccio^ of the king
/ and shall have like punissheme^t as they should have for executing of
benefices voyding within the realm.


Doctor. But I ca^ not se how the said statute may stand with conscience that
so far restrayneth the Pope of his liberty / which as me seems he ought i^
this case right to have.


Stude^t. Because as I suppose ye patro^s ought of right to have their
presenteme^tes under such manner as they claim the^ in these realm as I have
said before / and as in the.xxvi chapi. of this book appears more at large and
also for as much as it apereth evidently that great inconvenient followed upon
the said provisions / and that the said estatute was made to avoid the same /
which sith that time has been suffered by the Pope and has been always used in
this realm without resistaunce that the said estatute should therefore stand
with good conscience.


If a house by chance fall upon a horse that is borrowed who shall bear the
loss The.xxxviii. Chapitre.
STudent. In the said sum called Summa rosella / in the title casus for
tuitus / i^ the begi^nyng is put this case if a man lend to another a horse
which is called there depositu^ and a house by chance falls upon the horse
whether in that case he shall answer for the horse. And it is answered there
that if the house were like to fall that than it can not be taken as a chance
but as the defaut of him that had the horse delivered to hi^. But if the house
were strong and of likeliholde and by common presumpcion in no danger of
falling but that it fell by sudden tempeste or such other casueltie that than
it shall be taken as a chance / and he that had the keeping of the horse shall be
discharged / and though his diversity agrees with the laws of the realm yet
for the more playner declaracion thereof and for other like cases and chances
that may happen to goods that a man has in his keeping that be not his own. I
shall add a littell more thereto that shall be somewhat necessary as me thinks
to the orderinge of conscience. First a man may have of another by way of lone
or borowynge / money / corn / wine / and such other things where the same
thing can not be delivered if it be occupied but another thing of like nature
and like value must be redeliuered for it / and such things he that they be
l^^e to may by force of that lene use as his own. And therefore if they
perysshe it is at his ieoperdye and this is most properly called a loone.
Also a man may le^de to another a horse / an ox / a carte / or such other
things that may be delivered again / and they by force of that leave may be
used and occupied reasonably i^ such manner as they were borrowed for / or as it
was agreed at the time of the loone that they should be occupied / and if such
things be occupied / otherwise tha^ according to the intent of the lone / and
in that occupacio^ they perysshe in what wise so ever they perysshe / so it be
not in defaute of the owner / he that borrowed them shall be charged therewith in
law and conscience / and if he that borrowed them occupy them in such manner as
they were lent for / and in that occupacion they perysshe in defaute of him
that they were lent to: tha^ he shall answer for them. And if they perysshe
not through his defaute: than he that owes them shall bear the loss. Also if
a man have goods to keep to a certain day for a certain recompense for the
keeping he shall stand charged or not charged after as defaute or no defaute
shall be in him / as before appears / and so it is if he have nothing for the
keeping / but if he have for the keeping and make promise at the time of the
deliuerye to redeliuer them saufe at his peril: than he shall be charged with
all chances that may fall. But if he make that promise and have nothing for
keeping I think he is bound to no such casuelties / but that be wilful and
his own defaute / for yt is a nude or a naked promise whereupon as I suppose no
accion lies. Also if a man find goods of another if they be after hurt or
lost by wilful necligence he shall be charged to the owner / but if they be
lost by other casuelte as if they be laid in a house that by chance is burned
/ or if he deliver the^ to another to keep that renueth away with the^: I
think he be discharged / and these diuersites hold most commonly upon pledges /
or where a man hurith goods of his neighbor to a certain day for certain
money / and many other diversities be in the law of the realm what shall be to
the ieopardy of the one and what of the other which I will not speak of at
these time. And by this it may appear that as it is commonly holden in the laws
of England if a common caryer go by by ways that be dangerous for robbynge /
or drive by night or in other vnconueniente time and be robbed / or if he over
charge a horse whereby he falls into the water or otherwise / so that the
stuff is hurt or empeyred / that he shall stand charged for his
misdemeanoure / and if he would percase refuse to carye it / onelesse promise
were made unto him yt he shall not be charged for no misdemeanour that should
be in him that promise were void. For it were against reason and against good
manners and so it is in all other causes like.

And all these diversities be grounded by secondarie conclusions diriuied upon
the law of reason without any estatute made i^ that behalf. And peradventure
the laws and the conclusio^s therein be the more plain and the more open. For
if any statute were made thereon: I think verily mo doutes and questions would
rise upon that statute tha^ does now wha^ they be only argued and iuged after
the common law.


If a priest have wo^ne much by saie^g of mass / whether he may give those
goods or make a will of them. The.xxxix. Chapitre.
STude^t. In the said sum called Su^ma rosella in the title clericus quartus
the third article / is asked this question if a priest has wo^ne much goods
by saying of mass whether he may give those goods or make a will of the^ /
whereto it is answered there that he may give them or make a will of the^
specially wha^ a man bequeteth money for to have masses said for him / and that
like law is of such things as a clerk wynneth by the reason of an office.
For it is said there yt such things come to him by reason of his own
person / which sai^ges I think accord with the law of the realm. But for
as much as in the said article and in diverse other places of the said chapitre
/ and in diverse other chapitres of the said sum is put great diversity
between such goods as a clerk has by reason of his church and such
goods as he has by reason of his person: and that he must dispose such
goods as he has by reason of his church in such manner as is appoi^ted by
the law of the church / so that he may not dispose them so liberally as he
may the goods that come by reason of his own person / therefore I shall a
little touch what spiritual me^ may do with their goods after the law of the
realm. First a Bishop of such goods as he has with the deane and the
chapitre he may nether make gift nor byquest / but of such goods as he has
of his own by reason of his church or of the gift of his auncestres or of
any other / or of his patrimony he may both make gifts and byquestes
lawfullye. And an Abbot of the goods of his church may make a gift and the
gift is good as to the law. But what it is in conscience that is after the
cause and intent and quality of ye gift / for if it be so much that it
notably hurts the house or the covent / or if he give away the books or the
chalyces / or such other things as belong to the service of god / he
offends in conscience / and yet he is not punisshable in the law / ne yet by
a sub pena after some me^ ne in none other wise but by the law of the church
as a waster of the goods of his monastery.

But nevertheless I will not fully hold yt opinion as to that that belongs
necessaryly to the service of god / whether any remedy lie against him or not
/ but remyt it to the judgment of other. And a deane and a chapitre and a
master and brethren of goods that they have to them self. And also of
goods that they have with the chapitre and brethren the same diversity
holds as appears before of a Bisshope and the deane and chapitre / except
that in the case of a master and brethren the goods shall be ordered as shall be
assigned by the fundacion. And moreover of a parson of a church vicar / and
chaunterie priest / or such other / all such goods as they have / as well
such as they have by reason of the personage / vicarage / or chau^tery / as
that they have by reason of their own person they may lawfully give and
bequethe where they will after the common law. And if they dispose part among
their parysshens and part to the byldinge of churches / or give part to the
ordinary / or to poor men / or in such other manner as is appointed by the law
of the church they offend not therein / oneles they think them self bounden
thereto by duty and by authorite of the law of the church / not regarding
the kings laws / for if they do so it seems they resist the ordenaunce of
god / which has given power to princes to make laws. But there as the Pope
has soueraintie in temporal things as he has in spiritual things / there
some say that the goods of prestes must in conscience be disposed as is
contained in the said sum / but that holds not i^ these realm / for ye
goods of spu^al me^ be temporal i^ what manner so ever ye come to the^ / and
must be ordered after the temporal law as the goods of ye te^porall me^ must
be. How be it if there were a statute made i^ this case of like effect in many
poi^tes / as the law of ye church is. I think it were a right good and a
profitable statute.


Who shall succeed a clerk that dies intestate. The.xl. Chapitre.
STudent. In the said sum called rosella in the chapitre Clericus quartus
the.vii. article / is asked this question / who shall succeed to a clerk that
dies intestate. And it is answered that in goods gotten by reason of the
church the church shall succeed. But in other goods his kinnesmen shall
succeed after the order of the law / and if there be not kinnesmen than the
church shall succeed. And it is there said forther that goods gotten by a
canon seculer by reason of his church or prebende shall not go to his
successor in the prebende / but to ye chapitre. But where one that is
beneficed is not of the congregation / but he has a benefice clearly separate
/ as if he be a parsone of a parysshe church or is a president or an
archedeacon not beneficed by the chapitre / than the goods gotten by reason of
his benefice / shall go to his successoure and not to the chapitre / and none
of these sayenges hold place in the laws of England.


Doctor. what is tha^ the law if a pa^rsone of a church or a vycar in the
country dye intestate / or if a chanon seculer be also a parson and have gods
by reason thereof and also by a prebende that he has in a cathedral church and
he dye intestate / who shall have his goods.


Student. At the common law the ordinary in all these cases may administre the
goods and after he must commit administracion to the next faith full friends
of him that is ded intestate yt will desire it as he is bound to do where lay
men that have goods dye intestate.

And if no man desire to have administracion than the ordinary may administre
and sethe dettes paid and he must beware that he pay the dettes after such
order as is appointed in the common law / for if he pay dettes upon simple
co^tractes before an obligacion he shall be compelled to pay the debt upon the
obligacion of his own goods if there be not goods sufficient of him that
dyed intestate / and though it be suffered in such case that the ordinary
may pay pound and pound like that is to apporcion the goods among the
dettours after his discrecion / yet by the rigor of the common law he might
be charged to him that ca^ first have his judgment against him. And
ferthermore by that is said before in ye last chapitre appears if a Bisshope
that has goods of his patrimony / or a master of a colage / or a deane of
goods that they have of their own only to them self dye intestate / that
the ordinary shall commit administracion thereof as before appears and if they
make executours than the executours shall have the ministracion thereof. But
the heirs nor the kynnesme^ by that reason only yt they be heirs or of kynne
to him that is decessed shall have no medlyng with his goods except it be by
custom of some contreys where the heirs shall have heir lomes. Or where the
children / the dettes and legacis paid / shall have a reasonable part of the
goods after the custom of the country.


Addition. If a man be owtlawed of felony or be attaynted for murdre or felony:
or that is an ascismus may be slain by every straungeour The.xli. Chapitre.
Doctor. It appears in the said su^me called Summa angelica in the.xxi.
chapitre. in the title of Ascismus the.2. Paragraf yt he is an ascismus that
will slay men for money at the instaunce of every man that will move him to it
/ and such man may lawfully be slain not only by the Judge but by every
private person. But it is said there in the.4. Paragrafe. that he must first
be iuged by the law as an ascismus or he may be slain or his goods seized.
And it is said ferther there in the.2. Paragraf that also in conscience such
an ascismus may be slain if it be done through a zele of justice and else
not. Is not the law of the realm likewise of me^ outlawed / abiured / or
iuged for felony.


Student. In the law of the realm there is no such law that a man shall be
adiuged as an ascismus / ne if a man be in full purpose for a certain su^me of
money that he has received to slay a man: yet it is no felony ne murdre in the
law till he has done ye act for ye intent in felony nor murdre is not
punisshable by ye common law of ye realm though it be dedly syn before god / but
i^ treason or i^ some other particular cases by statute ye i^te^t may be
punisshed. And though a man in such case kill a man for money: yet he shall
not be attaynted that he is an ascismus. For as it is said before: there is no
such term of ascismus in the law of the realm: but he shall in such case be
arrayned upon the murdre. And if he confess it or plede that he is not gylty
and is found gylty by.xii. men: he shall have judgment of life and of membre
/ and shall forfeyte his lands and goods. And like law is if in appele
brought of the murdre: he stand dombe and will not answer to the murdre: he
shall be attaynted of the murdre and shall forfeyt life lands / and goods / but
if he arrayned of the murdre upon an Inditeme^t at the kings suit: and there
upon stands dombe and will not answer: there he shall not be attainted of ye
murdre / but he shall have pain forte and dure (that is to say) he shall be
pressed to does and he shall there forfayte his goods and not his lands. But
in none of these cases (that is to say) though a man be outlawed for murdre or
felony / or be abiured / or that he be otherwise attai^ted: yet it is not
lawful for no man to murdre him or slay him ne to put him in execucion but by
authority of the kings laws. In so much that if a man be adiuged to have
pain forte and dure / and the officer by hedeth him / or on the contrary wise
puts him to pain forte and dure where he should byhede him: he offends
the law.

And if an officer which has authority to put a man to death (may not put
hi^ to death but according to the judgment) than me thynket it should follow
that more stronger a stranger may not put such a man to death of his own
authority without commandment of the law.

But if the judgment be that he shall be hanged in chains / and the officer
hangs him in other things and not in chains I suppose he is not gylty of
his death / but some say he shall there make a fine to the king because he
has not followed the words of the judgment.

Also if a man that is no officer would a rest a man that is outlawed / abiured
/ or attaynted of murdre or felony as is aforesaid / and he disobeyeth the
arrest / and by reason of that disobedience he is slain: I suppose the other
shall not be empeched for his death / for it is lawful unto every man to take
such persons and to bring the^ forth that they may be ordered according to
the law. But if a capias be directed unto the Sheryfe to take a man in an
accion of debt or trespass: there no man may take that man but he have
authority from the Sheryfe. And if any man attempt of his own auctorite to
take him and he resists / and in that resistinge is slain: he that would
have taken him is gylty of his death.


Addition. Whether a man shall be bounden by that act or offense of his servant
or officer The.xlii. Chapitre.
STudent. In the said su^me called Su^ma a^gelica in the title dominus.4.
Paragrafe: Is asked this question / whether a man shall be charged for his
household And it is said there that he shall wha^ the household offends in
an office or ministry that the master is the chyefe officer of: and he has
the work and the profit of ye household. For it shall be his defaut yt he would
choose such servant / for he ought to appoynte honest persons / but it is
said there that that is to be understand ciuilly and not criminally / whereby
as is said there he that is a governor is bound for the offense of his
officers / and that the same is to be holde^ of a Captain / that he shall be
bound for the offense of his squiers. And an host for his ghest and such
other. Nevertheless it is said there yt certain doctors there reherced / and
thereto yt if the office be an open or a publyke office / as an office of power
or other like: It suffices to bring forth him that offended. But it is
otherwise. If it be not a public office: but an host or a tauerner or
otherlyke. But if the household offended not in the office: the lord is not
bound as to the law: but in conscience he is bound if he were in defaut by
not correctinge them / for he is bound to correct them both by word and
example / and if he find any incorrigible he is bound to put him away
except that he has presumpcious that if he do so: he will be the worse / and
than he may do that he thinks best / and he is escused and else not. For
to such persons it is said (Error qui no^ resistitur: approbatur) that is to
say (An error that is resisted: is approved. And though diverse of the
saynges before reherced agree with the law of the realm / yet all do not so /
and also tho that do: are to be observed by authority of the law of the
realm and not by the auctorite alleged in the said paragrafe. And therefore I
ente^de to treat so^what where the master shall be charged by his serua^te or
deputy / or by them that be under him in any office / and where not / and than
I ente^de to touch some other things where the master after the laws of the
realm shall be charged by the act of his servant in other cases not
concerning offices and where not.

First if a man be committed to ward upon arrerages of account: and the keeper
of the pryso^ suffers him to go at large: tha^ an accio^ of det shall lie
against him. And if he be not sufficient: than it lies against him that
committed the prison unto him and that is by reason of the statute of West in
the.ii. the.xi. Chapitre.

Also if Baylyfes of frauncheses that have return of writtes make a false
return the party shall have auerment against it as well of to little yssues as
of other things as well as he shall have against the Sheryfe / but all the
punisshemente shall be only upon the bailey and not upon the lord of the
fraunchese / and that does appear by the statute made in the first year of
king Edward the.iii. the.v. chapitre. But if an under Sheryfe make a return
where upon the sheryfe shall be amercied there ye high sheryfe shall be amercied
for the return is made expressly in his name. But if it be a false return
where upon an accion of disceyt lies: in that case it may be brought against
the under sheryfe / and se thereof the statute that is called Statutu^ de male
returnantibus breuia.

Also if the kings butteler make deputies he shall auswere for his deputies as
for him self. As appears in the statute made in the.xxv. year of king
Edward the third. De prodicionibus the.xxi. Chapitre.

Also in the statute that is called statutum scaccaru it is enacted among
other things that no officer of the eschequer shall put any clerk under him
but such as he will answer for. And for as much as the statute is general:
it seems that he shall answer as well for an untruth in any such clerk as
for an over sight.

Also in the.xiiii. year of king Edward the third the.ix. chapitre: it is
enacted that all Gayles shall be adjoined again to the shyres / and that the
sheryfe shall have the keeping of the^ / and that the sheryfe shall make such
under gardeyns for the which they will answer. And nevertheless I suppose that
if there be an escape by defaute of the Gayler: that the king may charge the
Gayler if he w l. But it is no dout but he may charge the sheryte by reason of
his statute it he will / But if it be a wilful escape in the Gayler which is
felonye in him the sheryfe shall not be bound to answer to that felonye ne
none other but the Gayler him self and they that assented to him.

Also if a man have a shyrefwyke / constableship / or bailey wyke in see /
whereby he has the keeping of prisoners / if he let any to repleuyn that be
not repleuisshable and thereof be attaynt / he shall lefe the office. etc^. And
if it be an vndersheryfe / constable / or baylyfe that has the keeping of the
prison that does it without knowelege of the lord: he shall have
enprysonement by. iii. years / and after shall be raunsomed at the kings will /
as appears in the statute of Westminster. the first the.xv. chapitre. And so it
appears that in this case he that is the lord of the prison is not bound to
answer for the offense of them that have the rule of the pryso^ under him:
but that they shall have the punisshment them self for their misdemeanoure.

Also there is a statute made i^ the.xxvii. year of king Edward the.iii.
the.xix. chapitre is called the statute of the Staple whereby it is ordained
that no merchant ne none other man shall not lose their goods for the trespass
or forfayte of their servants / onelesse it be by commandment of his master
/ or that the offend in the office that his master has put him in / or else
that the master shall be bound to answer for the deed of his servant by the
law marchaunte / as in some place it is used.

Also it is enacted in the.xiiii. year of king Edward the.iii. the.viii.
chapitre that wapentakes and hundredes that be severed from the counties
shall be adjoined again unto them / and that if the sheryfe hold the^ in his
own hands: that he shall put in the^ such baylyfes that have lands
sufficient / and for the which he will answer / and that if he let them to
ferme: that they be let to the ancient ferme / but after it is prohibited by
the statute of the.xxiii. year of king Henry the.vi. the.x. chapitre. That no
sheryfe shall let his baylywykes nor wapentakes ^o ferme. And so when they be
ones in the sheryfes own hands and the sheryfe puts in baylyfes: they be
but as under baylyfes to the king and the sheryfe the high baylyfe / and they
in manner the sheryfes servants and put in only by him. And therefore by the
said statute of king Edward the.iiii. He shall answer for them if they
offend in their office / but if the sheryfe let them to ferme: tha^ though the
sheryfe offend the stature in yt doing / yet whether he shall be charged for
their misdemeanor in the office or not: is a great doubt to some men / for
they say that this statute is only to be understand where the baylywykes be
in the sheryfes hands: but here they be not so / ne the baylyfes be not his
servants but his fermours And therefore they say that if the sheryfe shall be
charged for them: It is by the common law and not by the statute aforesaid.

Also in the.ii. year of king Henry the.vi. the.xiiii. chapitre it is enacted
that officers by patente in every court of the king that by virtue of their
office have power to make clerks i^ ye said courts shall be charged and sworn
to make such clerks under the^ for whom they will answer.

Also the Hospitelers and Templers be prohibit that they shall hold no plee
that bylo^geth to the kings courts upon pain to yield damages to the party
grieved and to make ransom to the king / and that the superiors shall
answer for their obedie^ces as for their own deed. Westminster the.ii. the xliii.
Chapitre.

Also the sergeaunt of the caterye shall satisfy all the dertes / damages / an
execucions that shall be recovered against any that is purueyour or achatour
under him and that offend against the statute of.xxxvi of Edward the third /
or against this statute of.xxiii. of Henry the.vi. In case yt the purueyour or
achatour be not sufficient etc^. And the party pleyntyfe shall have a Scire
facias against the said sergeaunte in this case to have execucion as appears
in the.xxiii. year of king Henry the.vi. ye first Chapitre.

Also if a man be sent to prison upon a statute merchant by the Mayre / before
whom the recognisaunce was taken / and the Gayler will not receive him: he
shall answer for the det if he have where with / and if not: than he shall
answer that committed the Gayler to him / as appears in the statute called
the statute marchaunte.

Also if outrageous toll be taken in a town marcha^t / if it be the kings
town let to seem: the king shall take the fraunchese of the market into his
hands. And if it be done by the lord of the town: the king shall do i^ like
wise. And if it be done by the baylyfe unknowing the lord: he shall yield
again as much as he has taken / and shall have enprysonme^t of.xl. days. And
so it appears that ye lord in this case shall not answer for his bailey.
Westminster the first the.xxx. chapitre. And in all the cases before reherced where
ye superior is charged by the defaut of him that is under hi^: he in whose
defaut his superior is so charged: is bound in conscience to restore him that
is so charged through his defaut. Except the case before reherced of the
hospitelers / for all that the obediencer has: is the superiors if he will
take it. And therefore what recompense shall be made by the obeciencer in that
case: is all at the will of the superior. And now I entende to show the some
particular cases where the master after the laws of the realm shall be
charged by the act of his servant / baylyfe / or deputy / and where not /
and so for to make an end of this chapitre.

First for trespass of batery or of wrong full enter into lands or tenementes:
ne yet for felony or murdre the master shall not be charged for his seruau^te
/ oneles he did it by his commandment.

Also if a servant borowe money i^ his masters name: the master shall not be
charged with it oneles it come to his use and that by his assente / and the
same law is if the servant make a contracie in his masters name / the
contracie shall not bind his master oneles it were by his masters
commandment or that it came to the masters use by his assent. But if a man
send his servant to a fair or market to bye for him certain things /
though he command him not to bye them of no man in certain: and the servant
do. he according the master shall be charged / but if the servant in that case
bye the^ in his own name not speaking of his master: the maester shall not be
charged onelee (...) bought come to his use.

Also if a man send his servant to the market with a thing which he knows
to be defective to be sold to a certain man and he sells it to him: there
an accion lies against the master / but if ye master bids him not selle
it to any person in certain but generally to whom he ca^. And he sells it
according: there lies no accio^ of disceyt against the master.

Also if the servant keep the masters fire neclige^tly / whereby his masters
house is brent and his neighbors also / there an accion lies against the
master. But if the servant bear fire necligently in the street and thereby
the house of a another is bre^ned / there lies no accion against the master.

Also if a man desire to logge with one that is no common hostiler and one that
is serua^te to him that he lodges with: robs his chamber / his master shall
not be charged for that robbynge / but if he had been a common hostyler he should
have been charged.

Also if a man be gardeyn of a prison wherein is a man that is condemned in a
certain sum of money / and another that is in prison for felonye and a
servant of the gardeyn that has the rule of the prison under him wylfully
lets them both escape in this case the gardeyn shall answer for the det and
shall pay a fine for the escape of the other as for a neclygent escape and the
servant only shall be put to answer to the felonye for the wylful escape Also
if a man make a another his general receyueure / and that receyuoure receyuith
money of a credytoure of his master and makyth him an acquytaunce and after
pays not his master yet that payment dyschargeth the credytoure: but if the
credytoure had taken an acquytaunce of him without payeng him any money: that
acquytaunce only were no bar to the master / onles he made him recyueour by
writing and gave him authority to make acquytaunces / and than that
aucthorytye must be showed. And if ye creby four i^ such case by agreement
between the receyuoure and him: deliver to ye receyuour a horse or an other
thing i^ recompense of the dete: that delyuery dyschargeth not the credytour
onles yt be delivered over unto the master and he agree to it. For the
receyuoure has no such power to make no such co^mutacion but his master
give him special commandment thereto.

Also if a servant show a creditoure of his master that his master sense
him for his money / and he pays it unto him / yt payment discharges him not
if the master did not send him for it in deed / except that it come after
unto the use of the master by his assent.

Also if a man make a baylyfe of a manner and after the lord of whom the manner
is holden granted the seygnoury to another and the baylyfe after pays the
rent unto the grant: that payment of the rent countreuayleth no attournant
though it were by fine / ne shall not bind his master till he atturne him
self / but if the lord of whom the land is holden dye seized of the seynoury
and the baylyfe pays the rent to the heir of the lord: that is a good
season to the heir though the baylyfe had no commandment of his master to
pay it For it belongs to his office to pay rentes service but not rentte
charge as some men say.

Also an encrochemente by the baylyfe shall bind the master in auowry if he
had no commaundementte of the master to pay it.

Also if there be lord Mesne and tenant and the renaunte holds of the Mesne
as of his manner of D the Mesne makes a baylyfe. And after the tenant makes a
feoffement: the feoffe rendeth notice to the baylyfe and he accepts his rent
with the arrerages / this notice shall not bind the lord ne compel him to
alter his auowry / for the office of a baylyfe stretches not thereto but he
must have there in a special commandment of his master. Also if a servant
ride on his masters horse to do an erraunt for his master into a town that
has authority to make attachementes of goods upon playntes of debt etc^.
and there upon a playnte of debt made against the servant: the masters horse
is atached by the officers thynkinge that the horse were his own / and because
the servant appears not: the officers sease the horse as forfeyt / i^ this
case the lord shall have an accion of trespass against the officers / and this
attacheme^t for the det of his servant shall not bind hi^. etc^. but yt an
host or a keeper of a tavern shall be charged for their ghestes oneles it be done
by their asse^t or commandment. I do not remember that I have read it in the
laws of England.


Addition. Whether a villayne or abonde man may give away his goods.
The.xliii. Chapitre.
DOctoure. It appears in the said su^ne called Summa angelica in the citle
donatio prima ye.9. Paragrafe that a bond man nor a religious man / nor a
monk / ne such other that has nothing in propre may not give but it be by
the license of their superior / but that saying is not as it is said there to
be understand of religious persons that have lawful ministracio^ of goods /
for if they give with a cause reasonable: it is good / but without cause they
may not.

Also if they by the license if their prelate with the council of the more
part of the covent abide at scole or go on pilgrimage: they may give as other
honest scolers and pilgrymes be reasonably wont to do / and they may also
give alms where there is great need if they have no time to ask license.

Also if they se one in extreme necessite they may give alms though their
superiors prohibit them / for than all things be in common by the law of
god. And therefore they be bounden for to do it / as appears in the aforesaid
sum called Su^ma angelica in the title Elemosina the.6. Pagrafe. Does not
the law of England agree with these diversities.


Student. For as much as the question is only made whether a villayne or a
bo^de man may give away his goods or not. And it seems that after the
foresaid Sum in ye title which thou haste before reherced / yt he ne none
other yt has no property may not give / whereby it appears yt the said Sum
takes it that a bondeman should have no property in his goods / and yt
therefore his gift should be void: I shall somewhat touch what property and
what authority a villayn has in his goods after ye law of the realm / and
what authority the lord has over them. And I will leave the diversities that
thou have remembered before of religiouse persons to them that list to treat
ferther therein hereafter.

First if a villayne have goods either by his own proper byenge and selling
/ or otherwise by the gift of other men / he has as perfect a property and
also as (...) interest in them / and may as lawfully give the^ away as any
free man has may. But if the lords sease the^ before his gift: than they be
the lords / and the interest of the villayne therein is determined.

Also if the lord sease part of the goods of his villayne in the name of all
the goods that the villayne has or shall hereafter have that seasure is good
for all ye goods that he had at that time / though they were not there
present at the time of the sesure. But if goods come to the villayne after the
seasure: he may lawfully give them away not withstanding the said seasure.

Also if the lord claim all the goods of the villayne and seasith no part
of the^: that seasure is void / and the gift of the villayne is good not
withstanding that seasure.

Also if a man be bound to villayne in an obligacion in a certain sum of
money / and the lord seaseth the obligacion: tha^ the obligacion is his / but
yet he can take no accion there upon but in the name of the villayne / and
therefore if the villayne release the debt: the lord is barred by that release.

Also if a woman be a nyef / and she maryeth a free man / the goods
immediately by the marriage be the husbands / and the lord shall come to la^e
to make any seasure / and if the husband in that case makes his wife his
executrix and dies / and ye wife takes the same goods again as executrix to
her husband / yet it shall not be lawful for the lord to take them from her
though she be a nyefe as she was before the marriage.

Also if goods be given to a man to the use of a villayne / and the lord
seaseth those goods / that seasure after some me^ is good by the statute made
in the.xix. year of ki^ge Henry the.vii. whereby it is enacted that the lord
shall enter i^ to lands whereof other persons be seized to the use of his
villayne and they say that the same statute shall be understand by equity of
goods in use / as well as of lands in use.

Also if a villayn be made a priest / yet nevertheless ye lord may sease his
goods and lands as he might before. And until ye seses he may alien them and
give them away as he might before he was priest. And in this case the lord
may order him so that he shall do him such service as belongs to a priest
to do before any other: but he may not put him to no labor nor other business
but that is honest and lawful for a priest to do.

Also if a villayn enter in to religion (...) his year of proffe he may
dispose his goods as he might have done before he took the habitte upon him.
And in likewise the lord may sease his goods as he might have done before:
but if he aftre make executours and be professed. And the executours take the
goods to the perfourmaunce of the will: than the lord may not seize the
goods though the executours have them to the perfourmaunce of the will of him
that is his villayne: nor in yt case the lord may not sease his body ne put
him to no manner of labor but must suffer him to abide in his religion under
the obedience of his superior as other religiouse persons do that be no
bondmen. And the lord has no remedy in that case for loss of his bo^d man
but only to take an accio^ of trespass against him that received him into
religion without his license / and therevpo^ to recover damages as shall be
assessed by.xii. men. Many other cases there be co^cerni^g the gift of the
goods of a vilayn whereof I will speak no more at these time for this that I
have said suffiseth to show that the knowledge of the kings law is right
expediente to the good order of conscience concerning such goods.


If a clerk be promoted to the title of his patrimony and after sells his
patrimonye and after falls to pouertye whether shall he have his title therein
or not. The.xliiii. Chapitre.
STudent. In the said su^me called Rosella in the title Clericus quartus / the
xxiiii. article it is asked if a clerk be promoted to ye title of his
patrimony whether he may aliene it at his pleasure and whether in that
alienacion the solempnite needs to be kept that is to be kept in alienacio^
of things of the church / and it is answered there that it may not be aliened
no more tha^ ye goods of a spiritual benefice if it be accepted for a title
and expressly assigned unto him / so that it should go as in to a rhynge of
the church / except he have after an other benefice whereof he may live. But if
it be secretly assigned to his title: some agree it may be aliened / and in
this case by the laws of the realm it may be lawfully aliened whether it be
secretly or openly assigned to his title / for the ordinary ne yet the party
him self after the old customs of the realm have no auctorite to bi^de any
inheritance by authority of the spiritual law / and therefore the land
after it is assigned and accepted to be his title stands: in the same self
case to be boughte / sold / charged / or put in execucio^ as it did before.
And therefore it is somewhat to be maruayled that ordinaries will admit such
land for a title to the inte^te that be that is promoted should not fall to
extreme poverty or go openly a beggynge / without knowing how the common law
will serve therein / for of mere right all enheritau^ce within this realm ought
to be ordered by the kings laws / and inheritance can not be bounden in this
realm but by fine or some other matter of record / or by feoffeme^t / or
such other or at least by a bargain that changes an use. And over that to
assign a stare for term of life to him that has a fee simple before: is
void in the laws of England without it be by such a matter that it work by
way of conclusion or estapell / and in this case is no such matter of
conclusion / and therefore all that is done in such case in assignynge of the
said title is void. Also there is no interest that a man has in any manner
lands or tenementes for term of life / for term of years / or otherwise /
but that he by the law of the realm may put away his right therein if he will.
And than when this man alieneth his land generally: it were against the law
of ye realm yt any interest of such a title should remain in him against his
own sale / and there is no diversity whether the assignement of the title were
open or secret / and so that title is void to all intentes. And in in
likewise if a house of religion or any other spiritual man that has granted
a title after the custom used in such titles sell all the lands and goods
that they have that sale in the laws of England is good as against that
title / and the byer shall never be put to answer to yt title. Also some say
that upon the common titles yt be made daily in such case that if he fall to
poverty that has the title he is without remedy / for they be so made that at
the common law there is no remedy for them / and if he take a suit in the
spiritual court may men say that a prohibicio^ or a praemunire lies And
therefore it were good for ordinaries i^ such case to counsel with them that
be learned in the law of the realm to have such a form devised for making
of such titles / that if need be would serve the^ that they be made unto / or
else let the^ be promoted without any title / and to trust in god that if
they serve him as they ought to do he will provide for them to have sufficient
for them to live upon. And beside these cases that I have remembered before /
there be many other cases put in the said sums for the well ordering of
conscience / that is as me thinks are not to be observed in this realm
neither in law nor in conscience.


Doctor. Doste thou than think that there was defaute in them yt drew the
said su^mes and put there in such cases and such solucions that as thou
thynkest hurt conscience / rather than to give any light to it / specially as
in this realm.


Sudent. I think no defaute in them / but I think that they were right well
and charitably occupied to take so great pain and labor as they did therein
for the welthe of the people and clerynge of their consciences / for they have
thereby given a right great light in conscience to all countries where the
law Civil and the law Canon be used to temporal things. But as for the
laws of this realm they knew them not ne they were not bound to know the^ /
and if they had known them it would litell have helped for the countries that
they most specially made their treatices for / and in this country also they
be right necessary and much profitable to all men for such doutes as rise in
conscience in diverse other manners not concerning the law of the realm. And I
marvel greatly that none of them that in this realm are most bounden to do
that in them is to keep the people in a right judgment and in a clerenes of
conscience: have done no more in time past to have the law of the realm
known than they have done / for though ignorance may sometime excuse / yet the
knowledge of the troth and the true judgment is much better / and sometime
though ignorance excuses in part it excuses not i^ all / and therefore me
thi^keth they did very well if they would yet be callers on to have that point
reformed as shortly as they could. And now because thou haste well satisfied my
mind in many of these questions that I have made: I purpose for this time to
make an end.


Doctor. I pray the yet show me or that thou make an end mo of ye cases
that after thine oppynion be set in diverse books for clerynge of conscience
that as thou thynkest for lack of knowing of the laws of the realm do
rather blind conscience than give a light unto it / for if it be so than
surely as thou haste said it would be reformed / for I think verily ye laws
of the realm i^ many cases must in this realm be observed as well in
conscience as in the judicial courts of the realm


Stude^t. I will with good will show to the shortly some other questions that
be made in the said sum to give the and other occasion to se therein the
oppinions of the said sums / and to se ferther thereupon how the opinions
and ye laws of the realm do agree together. And yet beside these questions yt I
inte^de to show unto the there be many other questions in the said sums that
had as great need to be more plainly declared according to the laws of ye
real me as those that I shall show the hereafter or as I have spoken of before /
but to the cases that I shall speak of hereafter I will show the nothing of my
conceyt in them / but will leave it to other that will of charity take some
ferther pain hereafter in yt behalf.

these questions / and because thou desyredest me in the.xxxi. chapitre to show
the somewhat where ignorance excuses in the law of the realm and where not /
I will answer somewhat to thy question and so commit the to god.

Where ignorance of the law excuses in the laws England and where not.
The.xlvi. Chapitre.
STudent. Ignorance of the law though it be inuincyble does not excuse as to
the law but in few cases / for every man is bound at his peril to take
knowledge what the law of ye realm is as well ye law made by statute as ye
common law / but ignorance of the deed which may be called the ignorance of
the troth of the deed may excuse in many cases.


Doctoure. I put case that a statute penal be made and it is enacted that ye
statute shall be proclaimed before such a day in every shyre / and it is not
proclaimed before the day / and after the day a man offends against the
statute shall he run in the penalty.


Stude^t. I think ye / if there be no ferther words in the statute to help
him / that is to say / that if the proclamacion be not made that no man shall
be bound by the statute / and the cause is this / there is no statute made in
this realm but by the asse^t of ye lords spiritual and temporal and of all
the commons / that is to say / by the knights of the shyre Cytezens / and
Burgeses that be chosen by assente of the commons / which in the parliament
represente the estate of the hoole commons. And every statute there made is of
as strong effect in the law as if all the commons were there present
personally at the making thereof / and like as there neded no proclamacion if
all were there present in their own person / so the law presumes / there
needs no proclamacion when it is made by their authority / and than wha^ it
is enacted that it shall be proclaimed. etc^. that is but of the favor of the
makers of the statute and not of necessite / and it can not therefore be taken
that their intent was that it should be void if it were not proclaimed.
Nevertheless some be of oppinio^ that if a man before the day appointed for the
proclamacion offend the estatute that he should not in that case be punisshed
/ for they say that the intent of the makers of the statute shall be taken to be
yt none should be punisshed before that day / which is a doubt to some other
/ but admit it be as they say that he shall be excused / yet he is not excused
by the ignorance of the law / but by cause the intent of the makers excused
him.


Doctoure. It is enacted in the vii. year of king Richard the second the vi.
chapitre that every shyryfe shall proclayme the statute of Wynchestre three
times every year in every market town to the intent that offenders shall not
be excused by ignorance / and it seems by those words that if no proclamacion
be made that the offender may be excused by ignorance


Stude^t. Some take the intent of that statute to be that the people by that
proclamacio^ should have knowledge of the statute of Winchestre to the intent
that the forfeture therein may be taken as well in conscience as in law / and
some take the statute to be of such effect as thou spekest of / that is to say
/ that no forfeture should grow upon the statute of Wynchestre against the^
that were ignorant but proclamacion were made according to the said statute of
Rychard. And if it be so taken tha^ the statute of Wynchestre is of small
effect against most part of the people: for certain it is that the said
proclamacion is not made / but admit it be as they say / tha^ they that be
ignoraunte be excused by the said particular estature specially made in that
case and not by the general rules of the law / and sometime in diverse statutes
penalles they yt be ignorant be excused by the self statute as it is upon the
statute of Richard the.ii. the.xiii. year / the second statute and the last
chapitre where it is enacted yt if any person take a benefice by provision
that he shall be banysshed the realm and forfet all his goods / and yt if he be
in the realm he avoid within.vi. wekes after he has accepted it and that none
shall receive hi^ that is so banysshed after the said.vi. wekes upon like
forfeture / if he have knowledge / and so he that has no knowledge is excused by
ye express words of the statute. And in likewise he that offends against
Magna carta is not exco^menged but he have knowledge that it is prohibit that he
does. For they be only exco^menged by the sentence called (Se^tentia lata
super cartas) yt does it wilfully or that does it by ignorance / and
correct not the self within.xv. days after they have warninge. And sometime ye
yt be ignoraunte of a statute be excused fro the penalty of statute because it
shall be taken that the inte^te of the makers of ye statute was that none shall be
bound but they that have knowledge / but that any man should be discharged in
the law by ignorance of the law only for that he is ignorante. I know few
causes except it might be applied to infantes that be in their infancy and
within years of discrecion / for if ignorance of the law should excuse in the
law many offenders would pretend ignorance.


Doctor. Shall an infaunte that has discrecion and knows good fro evil be
punisshed by a penal statute yt he is ignorant in.


Stude^t. If the statute be that for ye offense he should have corporal pain
I think he shall be excused and have no corporal pain / but I suppose that
that is not for the ignorance / for though he knew the statute and wittigly
offended / yet I thike he shall have no corporal pain as where he pleeded I
ointenauncie by deed that is found against him / or if he piede a record i^
assise and fails of it at his day / but that is because the law presumes
that it was not the intent of the makers of the statute that he should have
that punishment / but if he be of years of discrecion to know good fro evil
whether he shall than forfet the penalty of a penal statute it is more doubt
/ for it is como^ly holden that if an infau^t had not ben excepted in the
statute of foriugeme^t yt ye foriugeme^t should have bound hi^ / and so shall
his cesser and hes leuie^ge of a cross against the stat / or if he be a
gardei^ of a prysone and suffer a prisoner escape he shall pay the derte
because the statutes be general and if he should by tho statutes be bound
within age like reason will that he may by a statute penal liese his goods.


Doctor. If an infaunt do a murder or a felonye at such years as he has
discrecion to know the law / shall he not have the punisshement of the law
as one of full age.


Stude^t. I think yes / but that is by an old maxim of the law for
eschewynge of murders and felonyes / and so it is of a trespass / but these
cases run not upon the ground of ignorance / but with what acre infantes
shall be punisshable or not punisshable / for the tenderness of their age though
they be not ignorance.


Doctoure. Be not yet knights and noble men that are bound most properly to
set their study to acts of chyualrye for defense of the realm. And husband
men that must use tyllage and husbandry for the susteynaunce of the cominaltie
/ and that may not by reason of their labor put the^ self to know the
law: discharged by ignorance of the law.


Stude^t. No verily / for since all were makers of the statute: the law
presumes that all have knowledge of that that they make / as it is said before
/ and as they be bound at their peril to take knowledge of the statute that
they make: so be all that come after the^. And as for knights and other nobles
of the realm me seems yt they should be bound to take knowledge of the law
as well as any other within the realm except them that give the^ self to the
study and exercise o the law and except spiritual iuges that in many cases be
bound to take knowledge of the law of the realm as is said before in the.xxv.
chapitre. For though they be bound to acts of chyualry for defense of the
realm / yet they be bounden also to the acts of justice / and that as it
seems more tha^ other be by reason of their great possessions and authority.
And for the well ordering of they tenantes / servants and neighbors that
many times have need of their help / and also because they be often called to
be of kings counsel and to the general counsayles of the realm / where
their counsel is right expedient and neccessarie for the common welthe / and
therefore if the noble men of this realm would se their children brought up in
such manner that they should have lerni^ge and knowledge more than they have
commonly used to have in time past / specially of the grounds and principles of
the law of the realm wherein they be enheryte / though they had not ye high
co^nynge of the hole body of the law / but after such manner as master
Fortescue i^ in his book that he intitelleth the book (de laudibus legum
Anglie) auertisith the prince to have knowelege of the laws of his realm / I
suppose it would be a great help hereafter to the ministracion of Justice in
this relame. A great surely for the^ self and a right great gladness to all
the people for certain it is the more part of the people would more gladly
here that their rulers and governors intended to order them with wisdom and
Justice than with power and great retynues. But ignorance of the deed many
times excuses in the laws of England. And I shall shortly touch some cases
thereof to show where it shall excuse and wbere it shall not excuse / and tha^
the reder may add to it after his pleasure and as he shall think to be
conueniente.


Certain cases and grounds where ignorance of the deed excuses in the laws
of England and where not. The.xlvii. Chapitre.
STudent. If a man bye a horse in open market of him that in right has no
propertye in him not knowing but that he has right / he has good title and
right to the horse / and that ignorance shall excuse him. But if he had
bought him out of open market / or if he had known that the seller had no
right / the byeng in open market had not excused him Also if a man reteyne a
another man's servant not knowing that he is retained with him / that
ignorance excuses him both for the offense that was at the common law
against the maxim that prohibited such reteynynge of a another man's
servant. And also against the statute of.xxiii. of Edward the.iii. whereby it
is prohibit upon pain of inprysonemente that none shall reteyne no servant
that departs within his term without license or reasonable cause / for it
has been always taken that the intent of the makers of the said statute was
that they that were ignorant of the first reteynoure should not run in any
penaltye of the statute. And the same law is of him that reteyneth one that is
ward to another / not knowing that he is his ward. And if homage be due and
the tenant after that the homage is due makes a feoffement / and after the
lord not knowing of the feoffement distreyneth for ye homage in that case
that ignorance shall excuse him of damages in a Repleuin / though he can not
auowe for the homage but if he had known of the feoffemente he should have
yielded damages for the wro^gfull taking. Also if a man be bound in an
obligacio^ that he shall repair the houses of him that he is bound to by
such a certain time as ofre as need shall require / and after the houses have
need to be repaired but he that is bound knows it not / that ignorance
shall not excuse him for he has bound him self to it / and so he must take
knowledge at his peril / but if the condition had been that should repair such
houses as he to whom he was bound should assign / and after he assigns
certain houses to be repaired / but he that is bound has no knowledge of that
assignement / that ignorance shall excuse him in the law / for he has not
bound him self to no reparacio^s in certain / but to such as the party will
assign / and if he none assign he is bound to none / and therefore sith he
that should make the assignement is priuye to the deed he is bound to give
notice of his own assignement / but if the assignement had been appointed to a
stranger tha^ the oblegour must have taken knowledge of the assignement at his
peril. Also if a man bye lands whereunto a another has title which the byer
knows not / that ignorance excuses him not in the law no more than it
does of goods. Also if a servant come with his masters horse to a town that
by custom may attache goods for det / and upon a playnte against the
seruau^te: an officer of the town by informacion of the party attacheth the
masters horse thinking that it were the servants horse / that ignorance
excuses him not / for when a man will do an act as to enter in to land / sea
se goods / take a distress or such other / he must by the law at his peril
se that that he does be lawfully done as in the case before reherced. And in
likewise if a shyryfe by a repleuyn deliver other beasts than were distreyned
/ though the party that distreyned showed him they were the same beasts /
yet an accion of trespass lies against him / and ignorance shall not excuse
him for he shall be compelled by the law as all officers commonly be to execute
the kings writ at his peril according to the tenor of it and to se yt the
act that he does be lawfully done. But otherwise it is after some men if upon
a somons in a Precipe quod reddat the shyryfe by informacion of the demaundaunt
somoneth the tenant in a another man's land thinking it for the tenauntes
land there they say he shall be excused / for in that case he does not sea se
the land ne take possession in the land / but only does somon the tenant
upon ye land / and the writ commands him not that he shall somon the
tenant upon his own land but generally that he shall somon him and names
not in what land and than by an old maxim in the law it is taken that he
shall somon him upon the land in demand / and therefore though he mistake the
land and ignorant of it / yet if the demaundaunt inform him that that is the
land that he demands that suffyseth to the shyryfe as to his enter for the
so monynge as they say: though it be not ye tenau^tes land. And here I make
an end of these questions for this time.


Doctor. I pray the yet or we depart take a litell more pain at my desire.


Stude^t. what is that.


Doctor. That thou would show me thy mind in diverse cases of the law of
the realm / which as me seems stand not so clearly with conscience as they
should do. And therefore I would gladly here thy conceyte therein how they may
stand with conscience.


Student. Put the cases and I shall with good will say as I think to them.


Addition. The first question of the Doctor. How the law of England may
be said reasonable that prohibiteth them that be arreyned upon an Inditemente
of felony or murdre to have counsel. The.xlviii. Chapitre.
STudent. Me thinks that the law in that point is very good and indifferent
taking the law therein as it is


Doctoure. why what is the law in this point.


Student. The law is as thou say that he shall have no counsel / but tha^
the law is ferther / that in all things that perteyne to the order of
pledynge: the Iuges shall so instruct him and so order him that he shall run
into mo ieopardye by his mispleadyng / as if he will plead that he never knew
the man that was slain / or that he never had a penny worth of the goods /
that is supposed yt he should steel in these cases the Iuges are bound in
conscience to inform him that he must take the general issue and plede that
he is not gyltye / for thouh they be set to be (...) between the king and the
party as to the party as to the principal matter as they be in all other
matters: yet they be (...) this case to se that the party have no hurt in
form of pleadynge in such induces as he shall show to be the truth of ye
matter / and that is a great favor of the law / for i^ appell though the
Justices of favor will most commonly help fourth the party and sometime his
counsel also in the form of pleadynge as they do also many times in common
plees / yet they might in tho cases if they would bid the party and his
counsel plede at their peril. But they may not do so with conscience upon
eno^^ementes as me seems / for it were a great unreasonableness in the law if
it should prohibit him that stands in ieopardy of his life that he should
have no counsel / and tha^ to drive him to plede after the strayte rules and
formalities of the law that he knows not.


Doctoure. But what if he be known for a common offender / or that the Iuges
know by examinacio^ or by an evident presumpcion that he is gylty and he
asks sent wary / or pledeth misnomer or has some record to plede that he
can not plede after the form. May not the Iuges in such cases bid him plede
at his peril.


Student. I suppose that they may not / for though he be a common offender or
that he be gyltye / yet he ought to have yt the law gives him / and that is
that he shall have the effect of his plees and of his matters entered after the
forume of ye law / and also sometime a man by examinacion and by wytnes may
appear gyltye that is not gyltye. And in likewise there may be a vehement
suspicion that he is gyltye and that yet he is not gyltye / and therefore for
such susspicious or vehement presumpcious me thinks a man may not with
conscience be put fro that he ought to have by the law: ne yet all though the
Iuges knew it of their own knowledge. But if it were in appele I suppose that
the Iuges might do therein as they should think best to be done in conscience /
for there is no law that byndeth them to i^structe him / but as they do
como^ly the parties of favor in all other cases but they may if they will bid
them plede at their peril by advise of their counsel / and if the appelle be
pore and have no counsel: the court must assign him counsel if he ask it
as they must do i^ all other plees / and that me thinks they are bound to
do in conscience though the appelle were never so great an offender / and
though the Iuges knew never so certainly that he were gyltye / for the law
byndeth the^ to do it. And some thinks that there is great diversity between
an indicte and an appelle. And ye reason why the law prohibiteth not counsel
in appelle as it does in an indictment I suppose is this. There is no appell
brought but that of common presumpcion the appellau^t has great malice against
the appelle. As when the appele is brought by the wife of the death of her
husband / or by the sone of the death of his father / or that an appele of
robbery is brought for steli^g of goods. And therefore if the iuges should in
those cases show them self to instruct the appells: the appellauntes would
grutche and think the^ perciall / and therefore as well for the inde^pnitie of
the court as of the appelle in case yt he be not gyltye the law suffers the
appelle to have counsel / but wha^ that a man is indicted at ye kings suit /
ye ki^ge inte^deth nothing but justice with favor and yt is to ye rest and
quietness of hes faithful subjects / and to pull away misdoers among them
charitably / and therefore he will be contented that his justices shall help
forth the offenders according to the truth as fe^te as reasone and justice
may sufice. And as the king will be contented therein: it is to presume that
his counsel will be contented. And so there is no danger thereby neither to
the cou^^ ne to the party / and as I suppose for this treason it bega that they
should have no council upon inditementes and that has so long continued that
it is now grow into a custom and into a maxi of the law that they shall
none have.


Doctoure. But if the iuges know of their own knowledge that the induer is
gylty / and than he pledeth misnomer or a record that he was autre ^oytz
arraynded and acquyt of the same murdre or felony / and the iuges of their own
knowledge know that the plee is untrue: may they not than bid hi^ plede at his
peril.


Student. I think yes: but if they know of their own knowledge that he were
gylty of the murdre or felonye: but yt the plee was untrue they knew not but
by conjecture or informacio^ I think they might not then bid him plead at
his peril.


The second question of the Doctoure whether the warrantie of the ionger
brother that is taken as heir because it is not known but that the eldest
brother is ded / be in conscience a bar unto the elder brother as it is in
the law The.xlix. Chapitre.
DOctoure. A man seized of lands in see has issue two sons the eldest sone
goth beyond the sea and because a common voice is that he is ded the ionger
brother is taken for heir / the father dies the ionger brother enters as
heir and alieneth the land with a warantye and dies without any heir of his
body / and after the elder brother comes again and claymeth the land as
heir to his father / whether shall he be barred by that warantye in conscience
as he is in the law.


Stude^t. It is an maxim in the law that the eldest brother shall in that
case be barred. And that maxim is taken to be of as strong effect in the
law as if it were ordained by statute to be a bar. And it is as old a law
that such a wara^tye shall bar the heir as it is that the enheritaunce of
ye father shall only descend to the eldest sone. And sith the law is so why
should not tha^ conscience follow the law as well as it does in that point yt
the eldest sone shall have the land.


Doctor. For there appears no reasonable cause whereupon that maxim might
have a lawful beginning / for what reason is it that the warantye of an
auncestre that has no right to the land should bar him that has right.
And if it were ordained by statute that one man should have a another man's
land and no cause is expressed why he should have it / in that case though he
might hold the land by force of that statute / yet he could not hold it in
conscience without there were a cause why he should have it and these cases be
not like as me semyth to the forfeture of goods by an outlawrye / for I will
agree for this time that that forfeture stands with conscience because it is
ordained for ministracio^ of justice / but I ca^ not perceive any such cause
here: and therefore me thinks yt this case is like to the maxim yt was at the
common law of wrecke of the sea / that is to say that if a man's goods had be^
wrecked upon the sea that the goods should have been i^mediatly forfayted to the
king. And it is holde^ by all doctors yt yt law is against conscience except
certain cases that were to long to reherce now. And it was ordained by the
statute at Westmynster the first that if a dog or cat come alive to the sa^de
that the owner if he prove the goods within a year and a day to be his shall
have the^ whereby the said law of wreckes of the sea is made more sufferable
tha^ it was before / and some thinks in this case yt this warrantie is no
bar in conscience though it be a bar in the law.


Stude^t. I pray the keep that case of wrecke of the sea i^ thy remembrance
and put it hereafter as one of thy questions and thereupon show me thy ferther
mind therein / and I shall with good will show the mind / and as to this
case that we be in now me thinks the maxim whereby the warra^tye shall be a
bar is good and reasonable / for it seems not against reason that a man
shall be bound as to te^porall things by the act of his au^cestre to whom he
is heir / for like as by the law it is ordained that he shall have advantage
by the same auncestre and have al his lands by dissent if he have any right
so it seems that it is not unreasonable though the law for the priuity of
blood yt is between them suffer him to have a disaduauntage by the same
auncestre / but if the maxim were that if any of his auncestres though he were
not heir to hi^ made such a warrantye that it should be a bar I think that
maxim were against conscience / for in that case there were no ground nor
co^sideracio^ to prove how the said maxim should have a lawful beginning
wherefore it were to be taken as a maxim against the law of reason / but me
thinks it is otherwise i^ this case for the reason that I have made before.


Doctor. If the father bind him and his heirs to ye paymente of a debt and
dye / in that case the sone shall not be bound to pay the det oneles he have
asses by descent fro his father. And so I would agree that if this man had
asses by descent fro the au^cestre that made the warranty: that he should have
be barred / but else me thinks it should stand hardly with conscience that
it should be a bar.


Student. In that case of the obligacio^ the law is as thou say / and ye
cause is for that the maxim of the law in yt case is none other but that he
shall be charged if he have asses by discente / but if the maxyme had been
general that the heir should be bounden in that case without any asses / or
if it were ordained by statute that it should be so / I think that both the
maxim and the statute should well stand with conscience. And like law is
where a man is vouched as heir / he may enter as he that has nothing by
descent / but where he claymeth the land in his own right there the warrantie
of his auncestre shall be a bar to hi^ though he have no assesse fro the same
au^cestre / and though it be said in Ezechiel the.xviii. chapitre. That the
sone shall not bear the wyckednes of the father / that is understand
spiritually: But as to te^porall goods the opinion of doctors is / yt the
sone sometime may bear the offense of his father.


Doctor. Now that I have herd thy mind in this case I will take aduisement
therein till a better leisure. And will now proceed to another question.


Stude^t. I pray the do as thou sayste and I shall with good will make answer
thereto as well as I can.


The third question of the Doctoure if a man procure a collateral warra^tye
to extincte a right that he knows a another man has to land / whether it be
a bar in conscience as it is i^ the law or not The.l. Chapitre.
DOctoure. A man is disseased of certain land the disseasoure sells the
land. etc^. the aliene knowing of the disseason optayneth a release with a
wara^tye of an auncrestre colaterall to the disseasie that knows also the
right of ye disseasye. The auncestre colaterall dies after whose death the
warra^tye discendeth upon the disseasye / whether may the aliene in that case
hold the land in conscience as he may by the law.


Stude^t. Sith the warantye is descended upon him whereby he is barred in the
law / me thinks that he shall also be barred in conscience / and that this
case is like to the case in the next chapitre before / wherein I have said that
as me thinks it is a bar in conscience.


Doctor. Though it might be taken for a bar in conscience in that case / yet
me thinks in this case it can not / for in that case the longer brother
entered as heyr knowing none other but that he was heir of right / and after
when he sold the land the byer knew not but that he that sold it had good
right to sell it / and so he was ignorant of the title of the eldest brother
and that ignorance came by the defaut and absence of him self that was the
elder brother. But in this case as well the byer as he that made the colaterall
warra^tie knew the right of the disseasye and did that they could to extincte
that right / and so they did as they would not should have be done to them /
and so it seems that he that has the land may not with conscience keep it.


Student. Though it be as thou sayste that all they offended in opteynyng of
the said colaterall warrantie / yet such offense is not to be considered in
the law but it be in very special cases / for if such alegiau^ce should be
accepted in ye law / relesses and other writtinges should be of small effect /
and upon every light surmise all writtinges might come i^ trial whether they
were made with conscience or not. Therefore to avoid that inco^uenie^ce ye law
will drive ye party to a^swere only whether it be his deed or not / and not
whether the deed were made with conscience or against conscience / and though
the party may be at a mischyefe thereby / yet the law will rather suffer that
mischief tha^ the said inconvenience. And like law is if a woman covert for
dread of her husband and by co^pulcion of him leuye a fine / yet the woman
after her husbands death shall not be admitted to show that matter in
avoiding of the fine for the inco^uenie^ce that might follow thereupon. And
after the opinion of many men there is no remedy in these cases in the
chauncery for they say that were the common law in cases concerning
enheritaunce puts the party fro any auerment for eschewynge of an
inconvenience that might follow of it among the people / that if the same
inconvenience should follow in the chauncery if the same matter might be
pleaded there that no sub pena should lie in such cases / and so it is in the
cases before reherced. For as much vexacion / delay / costs / and expenses
might grow to the party if he should be put to answer to such auermentes in
the chauncerye as if he were put to answer to the^ at the common law and
therefore they think that no sub pena lies in the said cases ne in other like
unto them. Nevertheless I do not take it that their opynion is that he yt
boughte the land in this case may with good conscience hold the land because
he shall not be compelled by no law to restore it / but that he is in
conscience and by the law of reason bound to restore it or otherwise to
recompense the party so as he shall be contented and I suppose verily it is so
if he will keep his soul out of peril and danger. And after some men to
these cases may be rese^bled ye case of a fine with none claim that is
remember before in the.xiiii. chapitre of this book / where a man knowing
another to have right to certain land causes a fine to be levied thereof with
proclamacion and the other suffers five years to pass without claim in yt
case he has no remedy nether by common law nor by sub pena / and that yet he
that leuyed the fine is bound to restore the land in conscience. And me
thinks I could right well agree that it should be so in this case / and that
specially / by cause the party him self knows perfitelye that the said
colaterall warrantye was obtained by couen and against conscience.


The fourth question of the doctor is of wrecke of the sea The.li. Chapitre.
Doctor. I pray the let me now here thy mind how the law of England
concerning goods that be wrecked upon the sea may stand with conscience for
I am in great doubt of it.


Student. I pray the let me first here thine opinion what thou thynkest
therein.


Doctoure. The statute of Westmynstre the first / that speaks of wrecke is /
that if any man dog or catte come alive to the land out of the ship or
barge / thatt it shall not be iuged for wrecke so that if the party to whom
the goods belong come within a year and a day and prove them to be his that
he shall have them or else that they shall remain to the king. And me thinks
that the said statute stands not with conscience / for there is no lawful
cause why the party ought to forfet his goods ne that the king or lords ought
to have them for there is no cause of forfeture in the party but rather a
cause of sorrow and heuines. And so that law seems to add sorrow upon sorrow
(...) therefore doctors hold commonly that he that has such goods is bound
to restitucion and that no custom may help for they say it is against the
commandment of god. Le.xix. Where it is commanded that a man shall love his
neighbor as him self / and that they say he does not that takes away his
neighbors goods / but they agree that if any man have cost and labor for the
saving of such goods wrecked specially such goods as would perysshe if
they lay still in the water / as sugar / paper / salt / mele / and such
other / that he ought to be allowed for his costs and labor but he must
restore the goods except he could not save them without puttinge his life in
ieoperdie for them / and than if he put his life in such ieoperdie and the
owner by common presumpcion had had no way to have saved them tha^ it is most
como^ly holden that he may keep the goods in conscience / but of other goods
that would not so lightly perysshe / but yt the owner might of common
presumpcio^ save them him self or that might be saved without any peril of
life / the takers of them be bound to restitucion to the owner whether he come
within the year or after the year. And me thi^ket this case is somewhat like to
a case that I shall put / if there were a law and a custom in this realm or
if it were ordained by statute that if any alie^ came through the realm in
pylgrimage and dyed / that all his goods should be forfet / that law should
be against conscience for there is no cause reasonable why the said goods
should be forfet. And no more me thinks there is of wrecke.


Student. There be diverse cases where a man shall lose his goods and no
defaute in him / as where beasts straye away fro a man and they be taken up
and proclaimed and the owner has not herd of them within the year and the day
/ though he made sufficient diligence to have herd of them / yet the goods be
forfet and no defaute in him / and so it is where a man kylleth a another with
the sword of I. at style the sword shall be forfet as a deoda^de and yet no
defaute is in the owner / and so me thinks it may be in this case / and that
since the common law before the said statute was that the goods wrecked upon
the sea shall be forfet to the king that they be also forfet now after the
statute except they be saved by following the statute / for the law must
needs reduce the propertye of all goods to some man and when the goods be
wrecked it seems the property is in no man but admit that the property
remain still in the owner tha^ if the owner percase would never claim than it
should not be known who ought to taken the^: and so might they be distroyed
and no profit come of them / wherefore me thinks it reasonable that the law
shall appoint who ought to have the^ / and that has the law appointed to the
king as souerayn and head over the people.


Doctoure. In the cases that thou haste put before of the stray and deodand
there be consideracions why they be forfet / but it is not so here / and me
thinks that in this case it were not unreasonable that the law should suffer
any man that would take the^ to take and keep them to the use of ye owner /
sauinge his reasonable expe^ces / and this me thinks were more reasonable law
than to pull the property out of the owner with out cause. But if a man in the sea cast his goods out of the ship as forsaken: there doctors hold that
every man may take them lawfully that will / but otherwise it is as they say if
he throw them out for fere that they should ouercharge the ship.


Stude^t. There is no such law in this realm of goods forsaken / for though
a man weyue the possession of his goods and says he forsakes than / yet by
the law of the realm the property remains still in him / and he may sease
them after wha^ he will / and if any man in the mean time put the goods in
saufegarde so the use of the owner: I think he does lawfully and that he
shall be allowed for his reasonable expenses in that behalf as he shall be of
goods found / but he shall have no property in the^ no more tha^ in goods
found. And I would agree that if a man prescribe that if he find any goods
within his manner yt he should have the^ as his own: that yt prescripcion were
void / for there is no co^sideracio^ how that prescriptio^ might have a lawful
beginning / but in this case me thi^keth there is


Doctor. what is that.


Stude^t. It is this. The king by the old custom of the realm as lord of the
narow see is bound as it is said to scour ye see of pirates and petyt robbers
of the sea. And so it is read of the noble king saint Edgare: yt he would
twice in the year scour the sea of such pyrattes / but I mean not thereby that
ye king is bound to conduct his marcha^tes upon ye see against al outward
enemies: but yt he is bound only to put away such pirates and petite robers
And because yt can not be done without great charge it is not unreasonable if
he have such goods as be wrecked upon the sea toward yt charge.


Doctor. Upon that reason I will take a respite till a another time.


The.v. question of the Doctoure whether it stand with conscience to prohibit
a Jury of meat and drink till they be agreed. The.lii. Chapitre.
Doctor. If one of the.xii. men of an enquest know the very troth of his own
knowledge and instructs his fellows thereof: and they will in no wise give
credence to him / and thereupon because meat and drink is prohibit them: he
is driven to that point that either he must assente to them and give the
verdyte against his own knowledge and against his own conscience / or dye for
lack of meat / how may that law than stand with conscience that will drive
an innocent to that extremity to be either forsworn or to be famisshed and dye
for lack of meat.


Stude^t I take not ye law of ye realm to be yt jury after they be sworn may
not eat nor dri^ke till they be agreed of the verdicte: but troth it is there
is a maxim and an old custom in the law that they shall not ease nor drink
after they be sworn till they have given their verdit without the assente and
^^tece of the justice / and that is ordained by the law for the eschewynge of
diverse inconuenie^ces that might follow thervpo^ / and that specially if they
should eat or dri^ke at the costs of the parties / and therefore if they do
the contrary: it may be said in areste of the judgment / but with the assente
of the Justices they may both ere and dri^ke as it any of the Jurors fall
sick before they be agreed of their verdit to sore that he may not common of
the verdit / tha^ by ye assent of the Justices he may have meat and drink and
also such other things as be necessary for him / and his fellows also at
their own costs or at the indifferent costs of the parties if they so agree
by the assent of the justices may both eat and dri^ke and therefore if the
case happen that thou now spekest of and that the Iuri can in no wise agree in
their verdit / and that appears to ye Justices by examinacio^: the Justices
may in that case suffer them have both meat and drink for a time to se
wheter they will agree / and if they will in no wise agree: I think that than
Justices may set such order in the matter as shall seem to them by their
discrecion to stand with reason and conscience by awardynge of a new enqueste
and by settinge sines upon the^ that they shall find in defaute or otherwise as
they shall think best by their discrecion like as they may do if one of the
Jury dye before verdit or if any other like casualties fall in yt behalf But
what the justices ought to do in this case that thou haste put by their
discrecio^: I will not tret of at this time.


The.vi. question of the Doctor whether the colors that be given at the common
law in assizes / accions of trespass / and diverse other accions stand with
conscience because they be most commonly feyned and be not true. The.liii.
Chapitre.
Doctor. I pray the let me here thy mind to what intent such colors be
given / and sith they be commonly untrue: how they may stand mith conscience


Stude^t. The cause why such colors be given is this / there is a maxim and
a ground in the law of England: that if the defendant or tenant in any
accio^ plede a plee that amou^teth to the general issue that he shall be
compelled to take the general issue / and if he will not / he shall be
conde^pned for lack of answer / and the general issue in assise is / that he
that is named the disseasoure has done no wrong nor no disseason. And in a
writ of enter in the nature of assise the general issue is that he disseased
him not / and in an accio^ of trespass that he is not gyltye and so every accio^
has his general issue assigned by the law / and the tenant must of
necessity either take that general issue / or plede some plee in abatement of
the writ / to the iurisdiccio^ / to the person or else some bar or some
matter by way of conclusion. And therefore if Johan at style infeffe Henry heart
of land and a stranger brings an assise against the said Henry heart for
that land whose title he knows not. In these case if he should be compelled to
plede to the point of the assise / that is to say / yt he has done no wrong
ne no disseason the matter should be put in the mouths of.xii. lay men which
be not learned in the law / and therefore better it is that the law be so
ordered that it be put in the determinacion of the iuges than of lay men. And
if the said Henry heart in the case before reherced would plede in bar of the
assise that Johan at style was seized and infessed him / byforce whereof he
entered and asked judgment if that assise should lie against him that ple were
not good for it amou^teth but to the general issue and therefore he shall be
compelled to take the general issue or else the assise shall be awarded against
hi^ for lack of answer. And therefore to the intent the matter may be showed
and pleded before the iuges rather than before Jury / the tenantes use to give
the pleyntyfe a color / that is to say a color of accion whereby it shall
appear yt it were hurtful to the tenant to put that matter that he pleads to
the judgment of.xii. me^ / and the most eomon color that is used in such
case is this / when he has pleded yt such a man enfeffed him as before
apereth it is used that he shall plede ferther and say that the pleyntyfe
claming in by a color of a deed of feffeme^t made by ye said feffor before
the feffemente made to him / where naught passed by ye deed e^tred / upon whom
he entered and asks judgment if the assiselye against him. In this case
because it appears to be a dout to unlearned me^ whether the land pass by the
deed without lyuerey or not / therefore the law suffers the tenant to have
that special matter to bring the matter to the determinacion of the Iuges. And
in such case the Iuges may not put the tenant fro the plee / for they know
not as Iuges but that it is true / and so if any defaut be it is in the
tenant and not in the court. And though the truth be that there were no
such deed of feoffeme^t made to the playntyfe as the tenant pleads / yet me
thinks it is no defaute in the tenant for he does it to a good intent as
before appears.


Doctor. If the tenante know that the feoffour made no such deed of
feoffement to the pleyntyfe / tha^ there is a defaut in the tenant to plede it
/ for he wittingly says against the truth / and it is holden by all
doctors that every lie is an offense more or less / for if it be of malice
and to the hurt of his neighbor / than it is called (Mendaciu^ permiciosum)
and that is dedely sin. And if it be in sport and to the hurt of no man /
nor of custom used / ne of pleasure that he has in lyenge / than it is
venial sin / and is called in latin me^dacium iocosum. And if it be to the
profit of his neighbor and to the hurt of no man than it is also venial
sin / and is called in latin mendacium officiosum. And though it be the
leeste of tho three yet it is a venial sin and would be eschewed.


Student. Though the mydwyfes of Egipte lied when they had reserved the male
children of ye Ebrewes / sai^g to the king Pharao / that the Ebrewes had women
that were connyng in the same craft which or they came had reserved the
children alive where in deed they themself of pytye and of dread of god
reserved them. yet saint Jerome expounds the text following which says that
our lord therefore gave the^ houses yt it is to be understand that he gave
them spiritual houses and that they had therefore eternal reward / and if
they sinned by that lie all though it were but venial / yet I ca^ not se how
they should have therefore eternal reward. And also if a man intending to slay
a another ask me where that man / is it not better for me to lie and to say I
can not tell where he is though I know it / tha^ to show where he is whereupon
murder should follow.


Doctor. The deed that the mydwyfes of Egipte did in saving yt children was
meritorious and deserved reward everlasting (if they believed in god) and did
good deeds beside as it is to presume they did / when they for the love of god
refused the death of the Innocents / and than though they made a lie after
which was but venial sin that could not take fro them their reward / for
a venial sin does not utterly extincte charity but lets the fervor
thereof: and therefore it may well stand with the words of saint Jerome that
they had for their good deed eternal houses / and yet the lie that they made
to be a venial sin / but nevertheless if such a lie that is of it self but
venial be affirmed with an oath / it is always mortal if he know it befalse
that he swereth. And as to the other question it is not like to this question
that we have in hand as me seems / for sometime a man for eschewing of the
greater evil may do a less evil / and than the less is no offense in him /
and so it is in the case that thou have put wherein because it is less offense
to say he wotteth not where he is though he know where he is than it is to
show where he is / whereupon murdre should follow / it is therefore no sin to
say he wotteth not where he is / for every man is bound to love his neighbor
and if he show in this case where he is knowing his death should follow
thereupon it seems that he loved him not / ne that he did not to hi^ as he
would be done to / but i^ the case that we be in here / there is no such sin
eschewed / for though the party pleded the general issue the jury might find
the troth in every thing / and therefore in that he says that the pleyntyfe
claymi^ge in by the color of a deed of feffement where naught passed entered.
etc^. knowing yt there was no such feffeme^t it was a lie in him and a
venial sin as me thinks. And every man is bounde^ to suffer a deedly sin
in his neighbor / rather than a venial sin in himself.


Stude^t. Though the Jury upon the general issue may find the troth as thou
sayste / yet it is much more dangerous to the Jury to enquere of many poi^tes
tha^ to enquere only of one poi^t. And for as much as our lord has given a
commandment to every man upon hes neighbor / therefore every man is bound to
forse as much as i^ hi^ is yt by hi^ no occasion of offense come to hes
neyghbor. And for ye same cause / ye law has ordained diverse maxims and
principles whereby issues in the kings court may be joined upon one point in
certain as nyghe as may be / and not generaltye / lest offense might follow
thereupon against god / and a hurt also unto the Iuri / wherefore it seems yt
he loves not in his neighbor as him self ne that he does not as he would
be done to that offers such danger to his neighbor where he may well and
conveniently keep it fro him if he will follow the order of the law / and it
seems that he puts him self wilfully an ieoperdye that does it / and it
is written Ecclesiastici.iii. Qui amat periculum in illo peribit / that is to
say / he that loves peril shall perysshe in it / and he that puts his
neighbor in peril to offend puts hi^ self i^ the same / and so should he
do me seems that would wilfully take the general issue where he might
co^uenie^tly have the special matter / and ferthermore it is none offense in
princes and rulers to suffer co^tractes and bye^g and selli^g in markettes /
fayres / though both periure and disceyte will follow thereupon / because
such contractes be necessary for the common welthe / so it seems likewise
that there is no defaute in the party that pleads such a special matter to
avoid fro his neighbor the danger of perjury / ne yet in the court though
they enduce him to it / as they do sometime for the intent before reherced / and
in likewise some will say that if the rulers of Cytyes and communaltyes sometime
for the punisshement of felons / murderers / and such other offenders will to
the inte^te they would have the^ to confess the troth say to the^ that be
suspected that they be informed in such certain defautes or misdemeanors i^
the offenders and that they do to the intent to have the^ to confess the
truth that though they were not so informed that yet it no offense to say they
were so i^formed because they do it for the common welthe / for if offenders
were suffered to go unpunished ye common wealth would soon decay and utterly
perysshe.


Doctor. I will take aduiseme^t upon the reason in this matter till an other
season and I will now ask the another question somewhat like unto this. I pray
the let me here thy mind therein.


Stude^t. Let me here thy question and I shall with good will say as I think
therein.


Addition. The.vii. question of the Doctoure concerns the pleadynge in assise
whereby the tenauntes use sometime to plead in such manner that they shall
confess no ouster The.liiii. Chapitre.
DOctoure. It is commonly used as I have herd say that when the tenant in
assise pleads that a strange our was seized and enfeoffede him and gives
the plai^tyfe a color in such manner as before appears in the.liii. chapitre
/ that the tenant many times when he has pleaded thus: and the pleyntyfe
claymyng in by a color of a deed of feoffemente made by the said strau^geour /
where naught passed by the deed entered / and that than they use to say ferther
upon whom. A. B. entered upon whom the tenant entered / where in deed ye said.
A. B. never entered / ne haplye there was never no such man. How can this
pleadynge be excused of an untruth / and what reasonable cause can be why
such a pledynge should be suffered against the truth.


Student. The cause why that manner of pleading is suffered is this. If ye
tenant by his pleadyng confessed an immediate entrye upon the plai^tyfe: or an
immediate putting out of the playntyfe / which in french is called an oustre
/ tha^ if the title were after found for the playntyfe: the tenant by his
confession were attained of the disseason. And because it may be that though
the playntyfe have good title to the land: that yet the tenant is no
disseasour. Therefore the tenau^tes use many times to plead in such manner as
thou have said before to save them self fro confessing of an oustre / and so
if there be any defaut it is not in the court ne in the law / for they know
not the troth therein till it be tried and me thinks also that there is in
this case right little defaut or none in ye tenant nor in his counsel /
specially if the counsel know that the tenant is no dissesour. But as to that
point I pray the that like as thou haste taken a respite to be aduysed or that
thou show thy full mind in the question of a color given in assise whereof
mencio^ is made in the said.liii. chapitre / that I in likewise may have a
like respyte in this case till other time to be advised / and than I shall with
good will show the my full mind therein.


Doctor. I am content it be as thou say but I pray the yt I may yet add a
another question to the two questions before rehearsed of ye colors in assise
and feel thy mind therein / because that sowneth much to the same effect yt
the other do (that is to say) to prove that there be diverse things suffered in
the law to be pleaded that be against the truth / and I pray the let me
hereafter know thy mind in all three questions / and thou shall tha^ with a
good will know mine.


Student. I pray the show me the case that thou spekest of.


Doctoure. If a man stele an horse secretly in the night: It is used that
there upon he shall be Indyted at the kings suyte / and it is used that in that
Indytement it shall be supposed that he such a day and place with force and
arms / that is to say / with staves / swords / and knyues. etc^ felonouslye
stele the horse against the kings peace / and that form must be kept in
every Indytement / though the fellon had neither sword nor other weapon with
hi^: but that he came secretly without weapon How can it therefore be excused
but that therein is an untruth.


Student. It is not alleged in the Indytement by matter in deed that he had
such weapon / for the form of an Indytement is this. Inquiratur pro domino
Rege si. A. tali die and Anno apud talem locum vi and armis videlicet gladus
etc^. talem equam talis hominis felonice cepit. etc^. And than the twelve me^
be only charged with the effect of the byl. That is to say / whether he be
gylty of ye felonye or not / and not whether he be gyltye under such manner and
form as the bylle specifieth or not / and so when they say (billavera) they
say true as they take the effect of the bylle to be. And therefore if there
were false latin in the byll of Indictement: and the Jury says (billa vera)
yet their verdit is true / for their verdite stretches not to the troth or
falls head of the latin: but to the felonye / ne to the form of the words:
but to the effect of the matter / and that is to inquire whether there were any
such felonye done by that person or not / and though the byll vary from the
day / fro the year / and also from the place where the felony was done in / so
it vary not fro the Shyre yt the felony was done in. And the Jury says (billa
vera) they have given a true verdite / for they are bound by their oath to
give their verdite according to the effect of the byll: and not according to
the form of the byll. And so is he that makes auow bound likewise to that
that by the law is the effect of his auowe / and not only to the words of
his auow. As if a man auowneuer to eat white meat / yet in time of extreme
necessity he may eat white meat rather tha^ dye and not break his auow
though he affermed it with an oath / for by the effect of his aduowe: extreme
necessitye was excepted: though it were not expressly excepted in the words
of the auowe / and so likewise though ye words of the byl be to enquire
whether such a man such a day and year and in such a place did such a
felony / yet the effect of the byll is to inquire whether he did the felony
within the shyre or no / and therefore the justices before whom such
inditeme^tes be taken: most como^ly enfourme ye Jury that they are bound to
regard the effect of the byll and not the form. And therefore there is no
untruth i^ this case: neither in him that made the byll: ne yet i^ the jury
as me seems.


Doctor. But if the party yt ought the horse bring an accion of trespass and
declares that the defendaunt took the horse with force and arms: where he
took hi^ without force and arms.

How may the playntyfe there be excused of an untruth.


Stude^t. And if the plai^tyfe surmit an untruth / what is that to ye court or
to the law / for they must believe ye playntyfe till that that he says be
denied by the defendant. And yet as this case is: there is no untruth in the
playntyfe to say he took the horse with force and arms though he came never
so secretly and without weapon / for every trespass is in the law done with
force and arms / so that if he be attai^ted and found gyltie of ye trespass:
he is at taynted of the force and arms. And sith the law adiugeth every
trespass to be done with force: therefore the playntyfe says trewely that he
took him with force as the law meneth to be force. For though he took the
horse as a fellon: yet upon that felonouse taking: the owner may take an
accion of trespass and if he will for every felony is a trespass and more.
And so I have showed the some part of my mind to prove that in those cases
there is no untruth neither in the parties / neither in the Iurye / nor in
the law. law. Nevertheless at a better leisure I will show the my mind
more fully theri^ with good will as thou haste promised me to do in the cases of
the colors of the assise and of the oustre that be before rehearsed.


The.viii. question of the Doctor whether the statute of.xlv. of Edward the
third of Silua cedua stand with conscience. The.lv. Chapitre.
Doctor. In the.xlv. year of the reygne of king Edward the third / it was
enacted that a prohibicio^ should lie where a man is empleded in the court
cristien for dismes of wood of the age of. xx. year or above by the name of
Silua cedua / how may that statute stand with conscience that is so directely
against the lybertye of the church and that is made of such things as the
parlyament had no auctorite to make any law of.


Stude^t. It appears in the said statute that it is enacted that a
prohibicion should lie in yt case as it had used to do before that time and if
the prohibicion lay by a prescripcio^ before that statute why is not tha^ the
statute good as a confirmacion of that prescripcion.


Doctor. If there were such a prescripcion before that statute yt
prescripcion was void / for it prohibiteth the payment of tithes of trees of
the age of.xx. year or above / and payenge of tithes is grounded as well upon
the law of god as upon the law of reason and against tho laws liet no
prescripcion as it is holden most como^ly by all me^.


Stude^t. That there was such a prescripcion before the said statute / and
that if a man before the said statute had been suyd in the spiritual court for
tithes of wode of the age of.xx. year or above that a prohibicion lay /
appears in the said statute / and it can not be thought yt a statute that is
made by authority of the hole realm / as well of the king and of the lords
spiritual and te^porall as of all the commons / will recyte a thing against
the troth. And ferthermore I can not se how it can be grounded by the law of
god or by the law of reason that he tenthe part should be paid for tithe and
none other portion but that but I think that it be grounded upon the law of
reason that a man should give some reasonable portion of his goods temporal
to them that myninstre to him things spiritual / for every man is bound to
honor god of his proper subst^^ce / and the gyuyng of such portion has not
ben only used among faithful people / but also among unfaithful people as
it appears Genesis.xlvii. where corn was given to the prestes in Egipte ye or
common barnes. And saint Poule in his epistles affermeth the same in many places
/ as in his first epistle to the Corinthies the.ix. chapitre where he says
he that works in the church shall eat of that yt belongs to the church.
And in this epistle to the Galathes the.vi. chapitre he says / let hi^ that is
instructed in spiritual things depart of his goods to him that i^structed
him. And saint Luke in the.x. chapitre says that the workma^ is worthy to
have his hyre / all which saynges may right conveniently be taken and applied
to his purpose that spiritual men which ministre to ye people spiritual
things / ought for their ministracion to have a competent lyuinge of them that
they minister to. But yt the x. part should be assigned for such a porcio^
and neither more nor less. I can not perceive that yt should be grounded by
the law of reason nor immediately by ye law of god for before the law written
there was no certain porcio^ assigned for the spiritual ministres neither
the.x. part nor the.xii. part unto the time of Jacob / for it appears Gene.
xxviii. that Jacob auowed to pay Dismes which was among the Jews for the.x.
part / if our lord prospered him in his journey / and if the.x. part had be^
his duty before that auowe / it had been in vain to have auowed it / and so it
had (...) it had been grounded by the law of reason / and as to that that is
spoken in the Evangelists and in the new law of tithes / it belongs rather
to the gyuinge of tithes in the time of the old law than of the new law as
appears Mathe.xxiii. and Lu. xi. where our lord speaks to the phariseis
says / woe be to you phariseis that sithe mynies / rewe / and herbs / and
forgette the Judgment and the charity of god / these it behooves you to do and
the other not to omit / that is to say / it behooves you to do justice and
charity of god an not to omit payenge of tithes though it be of small things
as of myntes / rewe / herbs / and such other. And also that yt the pharisei
says Luce.xvii. I pay my tithes of all that I have / is to be ferred too the
old law not to the time to the time of the new law. Therefore as I take it
that the paynge of tithes or of a certain portion to spiritual me^ for their
spiritual ministracion to the people / has been grounded in diverse manners.
First before the law written a certain portion sufficient for the spiritual
ministers was due to them by the law of nature / which after them that be
learned in the law of ye realm is called the law of reason / and that portion
is due by all laws and in the law written the Jews were bound to give
the.x. part to their prestes as well by the said auowe of Jacob as by the
law of god in the old testamente called the Judicials. And in the new law
the payenge of the tenth part is by a law that is made by the church. And
the reason wherefore the te^the part was ordained by the church to be paid
for the tithe was this.

There is no cause why ye people of ye new law ought to pay less to the
ministers of the new law / than the people of the old testament gave to the
ministers of the old testamente / For the people of the new law be bound to
greater things / than the people of the old law were as it appears. Mathe.v.
where it is said / but your good works habou^de above the works of the
scribes and the pharisees / ye may not enter in to the kingdom of heaven.

And ye sacrifice of the old law was not so honorable as the sacrifice of the
new law is / for the sacrifice of the old law was only the figure / and the
sacrifice of the new law is the thing that is figured / yt was the shadow /
this is the troth. And therefore the church upon that reasonable co^sideracion
ordained that the.x. part should be paid for the sustenaunce of the ministers
in the new law as it was for the sustenaunce of the ministers in the old law
/ and so that law with a cause may be increased or minisshed to more portion
or to less as shall be necessary for them.


Doctoure. It appears Genesis.xiiii. that Abraham gave to Melchisedech dismes
and that is taken to be the.x. part and that was long before the law written
/ and therefore it is to suppose that he did that by the law of god.


Student. It appears not by any scripture that he did that by the
commandment of god / ne by any reuelacio^. And therefore it is rather to
suppose that he did part of duyte and part of his own fre will / for in that
he gave the dismes / as a reasonable porcio^ for the sustenau^ce of Melchisedech
and his ministers / he did it by commandment of the law of reason as before
appears / but that gave the.x. part that was of his free will / and because
he thought it sufficient and reasonable but if he had thought the.xii. part or
the.xiii. part had suffised might have given it and that with good conscience.
And so I suppose that in the new law the gyuinge of the.x. part is by a law
of the church and not by the law of god / oneles it be taken that the law of
the church is the law of god / as it is sometime taken to be / but not
appropriatly nor immediatli for that is taken appropriatly to be the law of god
/ that is contained in scripture that is to say: in the old testament or in
the new


Doctor. It is somewhat dangerous to say that tithes be grounded only upon
the law of the church / for some men as it is said say that man's law
byndeth not i^ conscience / and so they might happen to take a boldness thereby
to deny their tithes.


Stude^t. I trust there be none of yt opinion / and if there be it is great
^ytye. And nevertheless they may be compelled in that case by the law of the
church to pay their tithes as well as they should be if payenge of tithes were
grounded merely upon the law of god.


Doctor. I think well it be as thou sayste and therefore I hold me co^tended
therein. But I pray the show me thy mind in this question / if a hole
country prescribe to pay no tithes for corn or hey nor such other / whether
thou think that that prescripcion is good.


Stude^t. That question depends much upon yt that is said before / for if
payenge of the.x. part be by the law of reason or by the law of god / than
the prescripcion is void but if it be by the law of man / than it is a good
prescripcion so that the ministers have a syfficient portion beside.


Doctoure. Ioha^ gerson which was a doctor of divinity in a treatice that he
named regule morales: says that dismes be paid to prestes by the law of god.


Stude^t. The words that he speaks there of yt matter be these (Solutio
decimarum sacerdotibus est de iure diuino quarenus i would sustente^tur: sed quota^
ha^c vel illa^ assignare: aut i^ alios redditus co^mutare positiui iures
existit). That is thus much to say / the paye^ge of dismes to prestes is of
the law of god / that they may thereby be sustained / but to assign these
porcio^ or that / or to change it to other rentes / that is by the law
positive / and if it should be taken that by that word: decimarum: which in
english is called dysmes or tithes / that he meant the tent part and that
that.x. part should be paid for tithe by the law of god / than is the
sentence that follows after against that saying / for as it appears above
the text says afterward thus / but to assign this portion or that or to /
change it in to other rentes belongs to the law positive / that is to the
law of man / and if the.x. part were assigned by god / than may not a less
part be assigned by the law of man for that should be contrary to the law of
god / and so it should be void. And me thinks that it is not likely that so
famous a clerk would speak any sentence contrary to the law of god or contrary
to that he had spoken before / and to prove that he mente not by that term:
decime: that dismes should always be taken for the tenth part / yet appears in
the.iiii. part of his works in the.xxxii. title: litte ray / where he says
thus (No^ vocatur porcio curatis debita propterea: decime: eo quoth semper sit
decima pars immo est interdu^ vicesima aut tricesima). That is to say ye
portion due to curates / is not therefore called dismes for that it is always
the.x. part for sometime it is the.xx. or the.xxx. part / and so it appareth
that by this word decimarum: he mente in the text before reherced a certain
portion and not precisely the.x. part / and that that portion should be paid
to prestes by the law of god to sustain them with / taking as it seems the
law of reason in that saye^ge for the law of god as it may one way be well
and conuenie^tly taken: because the law of reason is given to every reasonable
creature by god. And than it follows pursueantlye that it belongs to the
law of man / to assign this portion or that as necessite shall require for
their sustenaunce / and than his saying agrees well to that that is said
before / yt is to say / that a certain portion is due for prestes for their
spiritual ministracio^ by the law of reason. And than it would follow thereupon
that if it were ordained for a law yt al paye^ge of tithes should fro he^sforth
cesse / and that every curate should have assigned to him such certain
portion of land rent or annuite as should be sufficient for him and for such
ministers as should be necessary to be under him according to the nombre of
the people there / or yt every parisshene or householder should give a certain
of money to that use: I suppose the law were good / and that was the meaning
of Ioha^ gerson as it seems in his words before rehearsed / where he says /
but to change tithes in to other rentes is by the law positive / that is to
say by the law of man. And so me thinks that if a hole country prescribe to
be quyte of tithes of corn or gres so that the spiritual ministers have a
sufficient portion beside to live upon / yt it is a good prescripcion / and
that they should not offend / that in such countries paid no tithes / for it
were hard to say that all the men of italy or of the cest parties be dampened
because they pay no tithes but a certain porcio^ after the custom therefore
certain it is to pay such a certain porcio^ as well they as all other be
bound: if ye church ask it / any custom not withstanding / but if ye church
ask it not it seems yt by that not asking ye church remitteth it and an
example thereof we may take of ye apostle Poule yt though he might have taken
his necessari living of the^ that he preched to / yet he took it not / and
nevertheless they yt gave it him not did not offe^de because he did not ask it
/ but if one man i^ a town would prescribe to be discharged of tithes of corn
and gres / me thinks the prescripcio^ is not good / oneles he ca^ prove that
he reco^penseth it in another thing / for it seems not reasonable that he
should pay less for his tithes tha^ his neighbors do / seeing that the
spiritual ministers are bound to take as much diligence for him as they be
for any other of ye parysshe / wherefore it might stand with reason that he
should be compelled to pay his tithes as his neighbors do / oneles he ca^ prove
that he pays in reco^pe^ce thereof more tha^ the.x. perte in another thing.
Nevertheless I leave that matter to ye judgment of other / and tha^ for a ferther
proof that the said prescripcio^ of not paye^ge tithes for trees of.xx. year
and above / though it were not good of corn and gres should be good / some
make this reason / they say that there is no tithe but it is either a prediall
tithe a personal tithe / or a mixed tithe / and they say yt if a tithe should be
paid of trees wha^ they be so sold: that yt tithe were not a p^dial tithe / for
ye p^dial tithe of trees is of such trees as bring forth fruits and e^crease ye
rely / as apple trees / nut trees / pere trees / and such other whereof ye
p^dial tithe is the apples / nutes / peers and such other fruits as com of them
yearly and when the fruits be tithed: if the owner after fell the trees / there
is no tithe due thereby / for two tithes may not be paid of one thing / and of
these tithes (yt is to say) of prediall tithes was the commandment given in
the old law to the Jews / as appears Leuitici. xxvii. where it is said
(Omnes decime terre: sieve de pomis arborum: sieve de frugibus: domini su^t: and
illi sanctificantur) that is to say / all tithes of the earth either of apples
/ of trees / or of grains be our lords / and to him they be sanctified / and
though the said law spekyth only of apples / yet yt was understand of all
manner of fruits. And because yt says that all the tithes of the earth be our
lords: therefore calves / lambs / and such other must also be tythed / and
they be called by some men prediall tithes / that is say / tithes that come of
the ground / how be it thy call them only predialles mediate / and they be
the fame tithes that in this writtyng be called mixed tithes / and the other
tithes (that is to say) tithes of apples and corn and such other: be called
predialles immediate / for they come immediately of the ground / and so do not
mixte tithes as evidently appears.


Doctoure. But what think thou shall be the prediall tithes of ashes / elmes
/ salowes / alders / and such other trees as bear no fruits / whereof any
profit comes / why shall not the.x. part of the self thing be the tithe
thereof if they be cut down as well as it is of corn and gras.


Student. For I think that there is to that inte^te great diversity between
corn gres / and trees / and that for diverse consideracions whereof one is this.
The property of corn and gras is not to grow over one year and if it do: it
will perysshe and come to naught and so the cuttynge down of it: is the
perfeccio^ and preseruacio^ thereof / and the special cause that any increase
follows of the same.

And therefore the.x. part of that increase shall be paid as a predyall tithe /
and there no deduccion shall be made for the charges of it / and so it is of
sheep and beasts that must be taken and killed in time / for else they may
perysshe and come to naught. But wha^ trees be felled: that fellynge is not the
perfeccio^ of the trees / ne it causes not them to increase but to decay / for
most commonly the trees would be better if they might grow still. And therefore
upon that yt is the cause of the decay and distruccio^ of them it seems there
can no prediall tithe rise / and some me^ say that this was the cause why our
lord in the said chapter of Leuitici.xxvii. gave no commandment to tithe the
trees but ye fruits of the trees only.


Doctor. It appears in Paralape.xxxi. that the Jews in the time of the king
Ezechias offered in the temple all things that the groude brought forth / and
that was trees as well as corn and gres.


Stude^t. It appears not that they did that by the co^ma^dement of god and
therefore it is like that they did it of their own devotion and of a favor
that they had above their duty to the repayrynge of the temple which the
king Ezechias had the^ commanded to be repaired / and so that (...) proves
nothing that tithe should be paid for trees / and therefore they say ferther
that troth it is that if a man to the intent he would pay no tithe: would
wilfully suffer his corn and gres to stand still and to perisshe / he should
offend conscience thereby / but though he suffer his trees to stand still
continually without fellinge because he thi^keth a tithe would be asked if he
felled the^ (so yt he do it not of an evil will of the curate) he offe^deth
not i^ conscience / ne he is not bound to restitucio^ therefore as he should be
if it were of corn and gres as before apereth / and another diuersiti is these
In this case of rythe word / the tithe thereof would serve so little so that
purpose that tithes be paid for: that it is not likely yt they yt made ye law
for payment of tithes ente^ded that any fythe should be paid for trees or wode
/ for the spiritual ministers must of necessity spend daily and wekely /
and therefore the tithe of trees or wode that comes so seldo^ would serve so
litell to the purpose that it should be paid for that it would not help the^ in
their necessite so yt if they should be driven to trust thereto though it might
help hi^ in whose time it should happen to fall yet it should deceive the that
trusted to it in the mean time: and also should leave the parysshe without any
to minister to the^.


Doctor. I would well agree that for trees that bear fruit there should no
predial tithe be paid wha^ they be sold / for the prediall tithe of the^ is
the fruits that come of the^ and so there ca^ not be two p^diales of one thing
/ as thou have said. But of other tres that bear no fruit me thi^keth that a
p^dial tithe should be paid wha^ they be sold / and so it appears that there
ought to be by ye co^stitucio^ provincial made by the reuerente father in god
Robertte whyncelse late archebisshope of Cauntorbury where it is said and
declared that (silua cedua) is or every kind of trees that have being in that
that they should be curte or that be able to be cut whereof we will says he
that the possessoure of the said woods be compelled by the censures of the
church to pay to ye parysshe church / or mother church the tithe as a real
or prediall tithe and so by virtue of that constitucion provincial a prediall
tithe must be paid of such trees as have no fruit / for I would well agree
that the said constitucion provincial stretched not to trees that bear fruits
though the words be general for all trees as before appears.


Student. I take not the reason why a prediall tithe should not be paid for
trees yt bear fruit to be because two prediall tithes can not be paid for one
thing / for when the tithe is paid of lambs yet shall tithe be paid of wolle
of the same sheep / for it is paid for a another increase / and so it might be
said that the frut of a tree is one increase and the fellyng a another / but I
take the cause to be for the two causes before reherced and also for as much
as the fellynge is not properly an increase of the trees but a distruccio^ of
the trees as it is said before. And ferther I would here thy mind upon the
said co^stitucion prouincial which will that tithe should be paid for trees
by the possessoures of the wood that if the possessour sell the wood for.C.
li. and give the byer a certain time to sell it in / what tithe shall the
possessour pay as long as the wood stands.


Doctoure. I think none for the prediall tithe comes not till the wood be
felled and a personal tithe he can not pay / no more than if a man pluck
down his how se and sells it / or if he sell all his land / in which cases
I agree well he shall pay no tithe neither prediall nor personal.


Student And than I put case that the byer sells the wood again as it is
sta^dyng upon the ground to a another for.cc. li. what tithe shall be paid than.


Doctoure. Than the first byer shall pay tithe of the surplusage that he
takes over the.C. li. that he paid as a personal tithe.


Student. And than if the second byer after that cut it down and sell it when
it is cut down for less than he paid / what tithe shall than be paid.


Doctor. Tha^ shall he that felleth them paythe tithe for the trees as a
predial tithe.


Student. I can not se how that ca be for he nether has the trees that the
predial tithe should be paid for if any ought to be paid / nor he is not
possessour of the ground where the trees grow: and therefore if any predial
tithe should be paid it should be paid either by ye first possessour by reason of
the words of the said constitucio^ prouincial which be yt the tithe shall be
paid by the possessoure of the wood / or by the last byer because he has the
trees that should be tythed and by ye first possessour the tithe can not be
paid as a p^dial for he cut not the^ down ne they were not cut down upon his
bargayne / and by the last byer it ca^ not be paid neither as a predial tithe
for the said constitucion says yt the possessours of the wodes should be
compelled to pay it. And therefore I suppose that the troth is that in that
case no ^^the shall be paid / for as to the last seller he shall pay no
personal tithe for he gained nothing as it appears before / and no p^diall
tithe shall be paid / for it should be against ye said prescripcio^ / and also the
cuttinge down is the distruccion of trees and not their preseruacion as is
said before.


Doctor. Tha^ take thou the said constitucion to be of small effect as it
seems


Stude^t. I take it to be of this effect that of wood above.xx. year it
binds not because it is co^trari to the common law and to the said
prescripcion that stands good in the common law / but of wood under.xx. year
whereof tithe has be^ accustomed to be paid: ye co^stitucio^ is not against the
said prescripcion because pate^g of tithe under.xx. year is not prohibit but
suffered by the said statute how be it some say that by the very rigor of the
common law tithes should not be paid for wood under.xx. year no more than for
above.xx. year and that a prohibicio^ in that case lies by ye common law /
neuerthiles because it has been suffered to the contrary and that in many
places tithe has been paid thereof. I pass it over but where tithe has not be
paid of wood under.xx. year. I think none ought to be paid at this day in law
nor conscience: but admit it that the said constitucio^ takes effect for
payment of tithe wood under.xx. year as of a predial tithe / yet I can not se
how the tithe thereof should be paid by the possessoure of the wode if he sell
the^ but that it should be paid rather by him yt has the trees / for the
constitucion is that the tithe shall be paid as a real or a predial tithe / and
that is the.x. part of the same trees as it is of corn / and if a man bye
corn upon the ground the byer shall pay the tithe and not the seller and so
it should seem to be here and what the constitucion mente to decree the
contrari in tithe wode I can not tell oneles the meaning were to enduce ye
owners to pay tyths of great trees when they fell the^ to their own use which
me thinks should be very hard to prove to stand with reason though the said
statute had never be made as I have said before. And ferthermore I would here
under correccion move one thing and that is this that as it seems they yt
were at the making of the said constitucion that knew the said prescripcion
did not follow ye direct order of charity therein so perfitely as they might
have done / for when they made the said constitucion provincial directely
against ye said prescripcio^ / they set law against custom / and power against
power and in manner the spirituality against the te^poraltie / whereby they
might well know that great variau^ce and suit should follow / and therefore if
they had clearly seen that the said prescripcion had been against conscience
they should first have moved the king and his counsel and the nobles of the
realm to have assented to the reformacion of that prescripcion and not to make
a law as it were by authorite and power against the prescripcion and than to
threte the people and make the^ believe that they all were accursed yt kept the
said prescripcio^ or that maintain it / and it seems to stand hardely with
conscience to report so many to stand accursed for folowinge of the said
statute and of the said prescripcion as there do and yet to do no more than
has be done to bring them out of it


Doctor. Me thinks that it is not convenient that lay me^ should argue the
laws and the decrees or constitucio^s of the church and therefore it were
better for them to give credence to spiritual rulers that have cure of their
souls than to trust to their own opinions / and if they would do so than
such matters would much the more rather cesse than they will do by such
reasoninges.


Stude^t. In that that belongs to the articles of the faith I think the
people be bound to believe the church / for the church gadered to gyder in the
holy ghost can not err in such things as belong to ye catholic faith but
where the church makes any laws whereby ye goods or possessions of the
people may be bound / or by this occasion or that may be taken fro them there
the people may lawfully reason whether the laws bideth the^ or not for in
such laws the church may err and be deceived and deceive other either for
singularite or for couetyce for some other cause / and for that consideracion
it perteyneth most to the^ that be learned in the law of the realm to know
such laws of the church as trete of the ordering of lands or goods and to
se whether they may stand with the laws of the realm or not and therefore it
is necessary for them to know the laws of the church that treat of dismes
of executours of testamentes of legacies bastardye matrimony and diverse other
wherein they be bound to know wha^ the law of the church must be followed and
wha^ the law of the realm / whereof because it is not our purpose to treat. I
leave to speak any more at this time / and will resort again to speak of
tithes / wherein some me^ say yt of tynne / cole / and lead no tithe should be
paid when they be sold by the own of the ground because it is part of the
enheritaunce and it is more rather a distruccion of the enheritaunce than an
encreace / and therefore they say that if a man take a tyn work and give the
lord the tenthe dysshe according to the custom that the lord shall pay no
tithe of that tenth dysshe neither prediall nor personal: but if the other
that takes the work have geyns and advantage by the work it seems that it
were not against reason that he should pay a personal tithe of his geyns the
charges deducte.


Doctoure. I pray the show me first what thou take for a personal tithe and
upon what ground personal tithes be paid as thou think so that one of us
mystake not a another theri^.


Stude^t. I will with good will and therefore thou shall understand that as I
take it personal tithes be not paid for any increase of the ground / but for
such profit as comes by the labor or industry of the person / as by byeng
and selling and such other / and such personal tithes as I take it must be
ordered after ye custom and the church has not used to leuye those tithes by
compulsion but by conscience of the parties / nevertheless Raymond says that it
is good to pay personal tithes or with the assente of the person to distribute
them to pore me^ / or else to pay a certain porcio^ for the hole / but as
Innoce^ says / where ye custom is yt they should be paid the people be bound
to pay the^ as well as predialles / the expenses deducte / how be it in the
church of England they use to sue for such personal tithes as well as for
predialles and that is by reason of a co^stitucio^ provincial that was made by
Robert wynchelsey late archebisshope of Cau^torbury / by the which it was
ordained yt personal tithes should be paid of crafts and marchandyse / and of
the lucre of byeng and sellinge / and in likewise of carpe^ters / smythes /
weuers / masons and all other that work for hyre that they shall pay tithes of
their hyre except they will give any thing certain to the use or to the light
of the church if it so please the person / and in another place the said
archebisshoppe says that of the pawnage of woods and such other things
etc^. and of fysshynges / trees / bees / downs / and of diverse other things
there remembered / and of crafts / and of byenge and selling and of the
profits of diverse other things there receyted / every man should hold satisfi
competently to the church / to the which they be bound to give it of right /
no expenses by the gyuinge of the said tithes deducte or withholden / but only
for the payment of tithes of crafts and of byenge and sellinge / and vy reason
of the said constitucions prouincials sometime suits be taken in the spiritual
court for personal tithes / and thereof many men do marvel / because the
deduccions many times must be referred to the conscience of the parties. And
they meruayl also why a law should be made in this realm for pai^ge of
personal tithes more than there is in other contreys. And here I would move
the ferther in one thing concerning such personal tithes to know thy mind
therein / and that is / if a man give to another an horse / and he sells that
horse for a certain sum / shall he pay any tithe of that sum.


Doctoure. what thi^kest thou therein.


Student. I think that he shall pay no tithe / for there as I take it the
profit comes not to hi^ by his own industri but by the gift of an other /
and as I take it: personal tithes be not paid for every profit or advantage
that comes newly to a man except it come by his own industri or labor and so
it does not here.

And also if he should pay tithe of that he sold the horse for: he should pay
tithe for the very hole value of the thing. And as I take it: the personal
tithes for byenge and sellinge shall never be paid for the value of the thing
/ but for the clear geynes of the thing / and therefore I take the cases before
rehearsed where a man sells his land or pulls down a house and sells the
stuff / that he should there pay no tithe / that it is there to be
understand that he has the land or house by gift or by descent / for if a
man bye land / or bye the timber and stuff of a house and sell it for again I
suppose that he should pay a personal tithe for that gain / and this case is
not like to a fee or annuite granted for counsel where the hole fee shall be
tythed / for the charges deducte or some certain some for it by agreement / for
there the hole fee comes for his counsel which is by his own industry.
But in the other case it is not so / and the same reason as for the person all
tithe might be made of trees when they descend or be given to any man and he
sells them to a another that he shall pay no personal tithe.


Doctoure. Me thinks that if the horse amend in his keeping and than he sell
the horse / that than the tithe shall be paid of that that the horse has
increased in value after ye gift and so it may be of trees that he shall pay
tithe of that that the trees be amended after the gift or descent.


Student. Than the tithe must be the.x. part of the increase the expenses
deducte / and than of trees the charges must also be deducte / for it is than
a personal tithe / and there is no tree that is so much worth as it has
hurt the ground by the growing / and therefore there can no personal tithe be
paid by the owner of the ground when he sells the^ though they have
increased in this time. Nevertheless I will speak no ferther of yt matter at
this time / but will show the that if time / led / cole / or trees be sold
that a myxte tithe can not grow thereby / for a myxt tithe is properly of
calves / la^bes / pigs / and such other that come part of the ground that
they be fed of / and part of the keeping industri and oversight of the owners
as it is said before / but tynne / led / and cole are part of the ground and
of the freholde / and trees grow of the^ self / and be also annexed to the
freholde and will grow of themself / and also the mixte tithe must be paid
yearly at certain times appoi^ted by the law or by custom of ye country / but
it may happen that ti^ne / led / cole / and trees shall not be felled nor
taken in many years / and so it seems it can not be any mixed tithe / and these
be some of the reasons which they that would maintain that statute and
prescripcion to be good: make to prove their intent as they think.


Doctor. What think they if a man sell the loppes of his wood whether any
tithe ought there to be paid


Student. They think all one law of the trees and of the loppes.


Doctor. And if he use to fell the loppes ones in.xii. or.xvi. year / what
hold they tha^.


Stude^t. That all his one.


Doctoure. And what is their reason why tithe ought not to be paid there as
well as for wood under.xx. year.


Student. For they say that the loppes are to be taken of the same condition as
the trees be what time so ever they be felled / and that no custom will serve
in that case against the statute / no more tha^ it should do of great trees.


Doctor. And what hold they of the bark of the trees.


Stude^t. Therein I have not herd their opinions / but it seems to be one law
with the loppes.


Doctor. I perceive well by that thou have said before that thy mind is that
if a hole country prescribe to be quite of tithes of trees / corn / and gres /
or of any other tithes: that that prescripcion is good so that the spiritual
ministers have sufficient beside to live upon / do thou not mean so.


Student. yes verily.


Doctor. And than I would know thy mind if any man contrary to that
prescripcion were sued in the spiritual court for corn and gres or any other
rythes whether a prohibicion should lie in that case as it did after thy mind
before the said statute where a man was sued in the spiritual court for tithe
wood.


Student. I think nay.


Doctoure. And why not there as well as is did where a man was sued for the
tithe wood.


Stude^t. For as I take it: there is great diuersiti between the cases and that
for this cause / there is a maxim i^ the law of England that if any suit be
taken in the spiritual court whereby any goods or lands might be recovered /
which after the grou^des of the law of the realm ought not to be sued there:
though percase the kings court shall hold no plee thereof: that yet a
prohibicion should lie / and after when it had continued long that no tithes
were paid of wood because of the said prohibicion and that after by process of
time some curates began to ask tithes of wood contrary to the law and contrary
to the said prescripcion: so that variau^ce began to rise between curates and
their parysshens in that behalf / than for appeasinge of the said variaunce
the said statute was made / and that as it seems more at the calling on of
the spiritualty tha^ of the te^poralty / for the statute does not expressly
grant that the prohibicion in that case of tithe wood should lie so largely as
some say it lay by the law: how be it / it does not restrayn the common law
therein as it appears evidently by ye words of the statute / and so after some
men it appeared before the statute and also after ye statute as I have touched
before / that the spiritual court ought not in that case to have made any
process for ^ythe wood: and therefore if they did a prohibicion lay by the
common law: and like law is if the spiritual court make process upon such
a legaci as by the law of the realm is void. As if a man bequethe so one a
another man's horse / and the spiritual court thereupon makes process to
execute yt legaci: there a prohibicio^ lies / for it appears evidently in the
lybell if all the troth appear in the lybell that in the law of the realm
that legaci is void to all ente^tes. And that he to whom the legacy is made
shall neither have the horse nor the value of the horse. And in likewise if a
man sell his land for C. li. and he is sued after i^ the spiritual court for
the tithe of the said. C. li. There a prohibicion shall lie / for it appears
in that case openly in the lybel that no tithe ought to be paid / and that the
spiritual law ought not in that case to make any process whereby the goods
of him that sold the land might be taken fro him against the law of the
realm / and upon this ground it is that if a man were sued in the spiritual
court now sithe the statute for a mortuary that a prohibicion should lie /
for it appears in the lybell: that sithe the statute there ought no sure to
be taken for mortuaryes / and the same law is if any suit were taken in the
spiritual court for a new duty that is of late taken in some places upon
leases of personages and vycarages which is called a dimission noble / for it
appears evidently in the lybell if any be made thereupon that no such process
ought by the law of the realm to be made in that behalf / but in the case
of tithe corn / or gresse / or such other things wherei^ thou haste desired
to know my mind / there appears nothing in the lybel but that the suit
thereof of right perteyneth to the spiritual law and so for any thing that
appears the party may be helped in the spiritual court by that prescripcion
/ and if the case were so far put that in the spiritual court they would
not allow the said prescripcion / yet I think no prohibicion should lie / for
though the spiritual iuges in a spiritual matter deny the parties of
justice / yet the kings laws can not reform that / but must remitte it to
their conscience. But if there were some remedy provided in that case / it
were well done / for some say that in the spiritual court they will admit
no plee against tithes. And also if a composicion were made by assent of the
patron and also of the ordinari between a person and one of his parysshens
that the person and his successors should have for a certain ground so many
quarters of corn for his tithe yearly / and after contrary to that composicion
the person in the spiritual court asks the tithes as they fall / that in
this case no prohibicio^ should lie / ne yet though the case were further put
that the composicion were pleaded in the court and were disalowed / but all
rests in the conscience of the iuges spiritual as is said before how be it
because some be of opinion that a prohibicion should lie in this last case /
therefore I well refer it to the judgment of other / but in the case of the
prescripcion before rehearsed I take it for ye clerer case / that no prohibicio^
shall lie as I have said before. And I beseech our lord that this matter and
such other like thereto may be so charitably looked upon that there be not
here after such divisions ne such diversities of opinions therein as has been
in time paste whereby has followed great costs and charges to many persons in
this realm and yt has moved me to speak so far in this chapitre and in
diverse other chapitres of this present book as I have done / not entendynge
thereby to give occasion to any person to witholde his tithes that of right
ought to be paid / ne to alter the portion therein before accustomed / but
that as me thinks they ought to be claymed by the same title as they ought
to be paid / and by none other / and that it may also so^what appear yt the
said statute of.xlv. of Edward the.3. was well and lawfully made and upon a
good reasonable consideracion / and that the said prescripcion is good also /
so that no man was in any danger of excommunicacion for the making of the
said statute / nor yet is not for the obseruyng thereof / ne yet of the said
prescripcion as it is noted by some persons that there should be. And thus I
commit the unto our lord: who ever have both the and me in his blessed keeping
euerlasti^gly. Ame^.
