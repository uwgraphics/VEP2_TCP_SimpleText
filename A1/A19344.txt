TO THE VALEROVS AND TRVELY MAGNANIMOVS KNIGHT SIR EDWARD DYMMOCKE, THE KINGS
CHAMPION.
SIR
AS a poor man, indebted to many, and desirous to pay what he can, deuides
that little he has among many, to give contentment, at least, to some: so, I
(right Worthy SIR) am constrained to make the like distribution of this poor
Mite of mine; being all I have, for the present, to content you my Worthiest
Creditors. But first, for that I stand most obliged to you, even Conscience
moves me to show my willingness to satisfy you first. Your approved and
generally-beloued Noble- Nature (resembling that Divine) will (I hope) take my
Will for Deed, who in both ever will be

Yours entirely to dispose, William Corkine.

I. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^EAch lovely grace my Lady does possess, Let all men view, and in their
^^view admire, In whose sweet breast all virtuous thoughts do rest, Zealous to
pity, Chaste in her ^ ^owne desire, And to make up a rare and worthy creature,
Both wise, and chaste, and fair in ^ ^forme and feature, Enter but in to
thought of her perfecti- on, Thou will confess, thou will con- ^ ^fesse, thou will confess, and in confessing prove, How none de- serves like praise, nor
yet like love. ^

BASSVS.
^TRuth-trying Time, etc. ^

II. CANTVS.
^TRuth-trying Time shall cause my Mistress say, My Love was perfect, ^ ^con-
stant as the Day: And as the day when Evening does ap- pear, Does suffer ^
^doome to be or foul or clear, So, shall my last bequeast make known to all,
My ^ ^Loue in her did rise, did live, did fall. ^

2
You Gods of Love, who often heard my desires
Prepare her heart by your Loue-charming fires,
To think on those sweet revels, peaceful fights,
Nere-changing Custom, taught at Nuptial rites*
O g^erdonize my prayers but with this,
That I may taste of that long wisht-for bliss.
III. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^TWo Lovers sat la- menting, hard by a Crystal brook, Each ^^others heart
tor- menting, Exchanging look for look, With sighs and tears bewraying,
Their ^ ^silent thoughts de- laying, At last coth one, shall we a- lone, sit
here our thoughts bewraying? ^ ^Fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, Oh fie, it may not be,
Set looking by, let speaking set us free. ^

2
Then thus their silence breaking
Their thoughts too long estranged
They do bewray by speaking,
And words with words exchanged:
Then one of them replied
Great pity we had dyed,
Thus all alone
in silent moan
And not our thoughts descryed.
Fie, fie, oh fie,
Oh fie, that had been ill
that inwardly
Silence the heart should kill.
3
From looks and words to kisses
They made their next proceeding,
And as their only blisses
They therein were exceeding.
Oh what a joy is this,
To look, to talk, to kiss?
But thus begun
is all now done?
Ah: all then nothing is.
Fie, fie, oh fie,
Oh fie, it is a Hell
And better dye
Then kiss, and not end well.
IIII. CANTVS. BASSVS
^TIs true, it is day, what though it be? and will you ^^therefore rise from me?
What will you rise, what will you rise because it is light? Did we lie ^ ^downe
because it was Night? Love that in spite of darkness brought us he- there, ^ ^In
spite of Light should keep us still to- ge- there, In spite of Light should
keep us still to- ^ ^gether. In spite of Light should keep us still to- ge-
there. ^

2
Light has no tongue, but is all Eye,
If it could speak as well as spy,
This ^ere the worst that it could say,
That being well I feign would stay.
And that I love my heart and honor so
That I would not from him that has them go.
Is It business that does you remove?
Oh, that is the worst disease of Love,
The poor, the foul, the false, love can
Admit, but not the busied man:
He that has business, and makes love does do,
Such wrong as if a married man should woe.
BASSVS.
^DEere, though your, etc. ^

V. CANTVS.
^DEere, though your mind stand so auerse, That no assaulting words can
pierce, ^ ^Your swift and angry flight for- bear, What need you doubt, what
need you fear? In vain I ^ ^striue your thoughts to move, But yet, yet, yet,
yet, yet, yet, stay, stay, ^ ^stay, and hear me sweet love. ^

2
Words may entreat you, not enforce,
Speak though I might till I were hoarse,
Already you resolve I know
No gentle look or Grace to show.
My passions all must hapless roue,
But stay and hear me yet sweet love.
3
Since here no help nor hope remains,
To ease my grief, or end my pains,
I Will seek in lowest shades to find
Rest for my heart, peace for my mind.
Go thou more cruel far then fair,
And now, * leave me to my despair.
VI. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^SHall I be with joys deceived? Can Loves bands be ^^sealed with kisses?
Cupid of his eyes be- reaued, ^ ^Yet in darkness seldom misses, Let not
dallying lose these blisses, Let not dallying ^ ^lose these blisses. ^

2
Sleep has sealed their eyes and ears
That our loves so long have guarded:
Himen hides your maiden fears,
Now my love may be rewarded,
Let my suite be now regarded.
VII. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^DOwne, down proud mind, thou soarest far above thy might, Aspiring
^^heart, will thou not cease to breed my woe? High thoughts, meet with dis-
daine, Peace and Love ^ ^fight, Peace thou have wone the field, and Love shall
hence in bon- dage go. ^

This fall from Pride my rising is from griefs great de^pe
That bottom wants, up to the top of happy bliss:
In peace and rest I shall securely sleep,
Where neither scorn, disdain, Loves torment, grief, or anguish is.
Or this:
Stoop, stoop, proud heart, and mounting hopes down, down descend,
Rise Spleen and burst, hence Joys; for, Grief must now ascend:
My Stars conspire my spoil; which is effected:
I dye, yet live in death; of Love and Life (at once) rejected.
Then, O descend; and from the height of Hope come down:
My Love and Fates on me (aye me) do jointly frown,
Then Death (if ever) now come do thy duty;
And martyr him (alas) that martir'd is by Love and Beauty.
VIII. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^BEware fair Maids of Musky Courtiers oaths, Take heed, take ^^heede what
gifts and favors you receive, Let not the fading gloss of Silken Clothes,
Dazell your ^ ^vertues, or your fame be- reaue. For loose but once the hold
you have of Grace, ^ ^Who will re- guard your fortune, or your face? Who will
regard your ^ ^fortune, or your face? ^

2
Each greedy hand will strive to catch the Flower,
When none regards the stalk it grows upon:
Each nature seeks the Fruit still to devour,
And leave the Tree to fall or stand alone.
Yet this advise (fair Creatures) take of me,
Let none take Fruit unless he take the Tree.
3
Believe no oaths, nor much protesting men,
Credit no vows, nor their bewayling songs:
Let Courtiers swear, forswear, and swear again,
Their hearts do live ten regions from their tongues.
For, when with oaths they make thy heart to bremble,
Believe them least, for then they most dissemble.
4
Beware least Caesar do corrupt thy mind,
And fond Ambition sell thy modesty:
Say though a King thou ever courteous find,
He cannot pardon thine impuritie.
Begin with King, to Subject thou will fall,
From Lord to Lackey, and at last to all.
TO THE MOST NOBLE AND WORTHY BRETHREN, Sr. ROBERT, AND Sr. HENRY RICH:
Knights of the Honorable Order of the BATH.
IN your truly Noble affections there is an heavenly harmony, by the
operation of Grace; in your corporal constitutions, an harmony of the
Elements, by the highest art of Nature; in your heroical carriage and actions,
an harmony by the work of wel-discerning Judgment; and, in all, such an
highly-commended symphonie each with other, that to no two (as One) could I
more properly consecrate these ensuing Accents, coming from, and tending to
Harmony, then to you. If then they like you, it argues them most harmonious,
since like loves the like. But howsoever, I humbly refer both my self and
them, to your favor and good opinion; which with my harts-ioy makes such
harmony, as Amphions sweetest strains cannot half so much glad me; Ever
remaining, the humble honourer and admirer of your heroical perfections.

William Corkine.

IX. CANTVS.
^THe Fire to see my woes for anger burns, The Air in rain for ^ ^my
afflicti-on weepeth, The Sea to Ebb for grief his flowing turns, The Earth
with ^ ^pitty dull his Center turns. Fame is with wonder blased, Time runs
away for ^ ^sorrow, Place stands still amassed, To see my night of ^ ^ils
which has no morrow. Alas, all only she no pity takes ^

Fire, burn me quite, till sense of burning leave me:
Air, let me draw thy breath no more in anguish:
Sea, drowned in thee, of tedious life bereave me:
Earth, take this earth, wherein my spirits languish.
Fame, say I was not borne,
Time, haste my dying hour,
Place, see my grave vptorne.
Fire, Air, Sea, Earth, Fame, Time, Place, show your power.
Alas, from all their helps I am exiled:
For hers am I, and death fears her displeasure,
Fie death thou art beguilde.
Though I be hers, she sets by me no treasure.
^to know my mise- ries, But Chaste and cruel, My fall her glo- ry ma- keth, ^
^Yet still her eyes give to my flames their fu- ell. ^

IX. BASSVS.
^THe fire to see my woes, etc. ^ ^ ^

X. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^GOe hea- uy thoughts down to the place of woe, Tell Grief, tell ^^Paine,
and torments how they used me, Say unto Sorrow who is now my foe, And
fretfulnes which ^ ^long time has abusde me, Mauger them all, in time they
shall excuse me, Till then my ^ ^hart shall bear my wrongs so hie. Until the
strings do burst, and then I dye. ^

2
For being dead, what grief can me offend?
All pains do cease, all sorrows have their end,
Vexation cannot vex my flesh no more,
Nor any torments wrong my soul so sore;
All living will my liuelesse corpse abhor.
Yet thus I Will say, that death does make conclusion,
But yet with righteous souls there is no confusion.
XI. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^MY dearest Mistrisse, let us live and love, And care not what old doting
^^fooles re- prove, Let us not fear their sensures, nor e-steeme, What they of
us and of our loves shall ^ ^deeme, Old ages critticke and sensorious brow,
Cannot of youthful dal-liance allow, Nor never could en- ^ ^dure that we
should taste, Of those delights which they themselves are past. ^

XII. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^MAn like a Prophet of ensuing years, Begins his life with cries, he
^^ends with pain, The rest is so di- stract twixt hopes and fears, That life
seems but a loss and death a ^ ^gaine, My hopeless love is like my hapless
life, Begun in pain, and ends it self in grief. ^

Yet death in one's an end of pain and fears,
But cruel Love though ever living dies:
And she that gives me death when death appears
Reuiues my dying hopes, and death denies.
My hopeless love is like my hapless life,
Begun in pain, and ends is self in grief.
XIII. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^AS by a fountain chaste Di- a- na sat, ^^Viewing of Natures pride, her
beauteous face, The waters boild with ^ ^loue, she boyles with hate, Chastning
their pride with exile from their place; -They murmuring ran to ^ ^Sea and
being there; Each liquid drop turned to a bri- nish tear. ^

XIIII. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^AWay, away, a- way, call back what you have said, When you did vow to live
and dye a Maid, O ^^if you knew what shame to them befell, That dance about
with bobtaile Apes in hell, You Would break your oath, and ^ ^for a world of
gain, From Hymen's pleasing sports no more abstain. Your self, your Virgin
girdle would divide, ^ ^And put aside, and put aside, * the Maiden veil that
hides the chiefest Iemme of Nature. And would lie, ^ ^Prostrate to every
Peasant that goes by, Rather then under- go such shame, No tongue can tell,
what injury is ^ ^done to Maids in hell. No tongue can tell, What injury is
done to Maids in hell. ^

BASSVS.
^WHen I was borne, etc. ^

CANTVS. XV.
^WHen I was borne, Lucina crosse-legg'd sat, The angry stars with ^ ^ommi-
nous aspects, frownd on my birth, And the foredooming Fate, ordained to ^
^brand me with their dire effects, The Sun did hide his face, and left the
night to bring me to ^ ^this worlds accur- sed light. The Sun did hide his
face, and left the night to bring me ^ ^to this worlds ac- cur- sed light. ^

TO THE TWO TRVELY VIRTUOUS AND DISCREET GENTLEVVOMEN, Mis. VRSVLA STAPLETON,
AND Mis. ELIZABETH COPE, DAVGHTERS TO the Right Worthy Knights, Sr. Robert
Stapleton, and Sr. Walter Cope.
HOH quickly the Art of Music may be abolished, or at leastwise fall to decay
(worthy Ladies) may easily be conceived, if it were not guarded under your
Patronaging favors, or rather shrouded under such Eagles wings as Yours, to
prevent all future malignant reproaches, or by your commanding powers (as who
knows not what your beauties may command?) able to make all tongues silent at
any crimes by me committed. To your virtues have I Dedicated these few Songs
and Lyra Lessons, and the rather because you are both welwishers and
well-affected to Music, and are led away with a more then ordinary delight
in the same. Only let me be bold to entreat your favorable acceptance of
them, and that you will not let this Book be made an Orphant in his birth, but
that it may be a Child of your fostering, and live under your protections.
Then shall I think my self happy, and hereafter be encouraged in more ample
sort to publish my poor labors. Thus hoping for no less then I have formerly
entreated, I ever rest

Yours in all love, duty and service William Corkine.

XVI. CANTVS. BASSVS.
^SHall a smile, or guilefull glance. Or a sigh, that is but ^^fayned, Shall
but tears that come by chance, make me ^ ^dote that was dis- dayned? No, I
will no more be chayned. ^

2
Shall I sell my freedom so,
Being now from Love remised?
Shall I learn (what I do know
To my cost) that Love's disguised?
No, I will be more advised.
3
Must she fall? and I must stand?
Must she fly? and I pursue her?
Must I give her heart, and land,
And, for naught, with them endue her?
No, first I will find her truer.
XVII. CANTVS.
^WEe yet a- gree, but shall be ^ ^straight ways out, Thy passions are so
harsh and strange to me, The time is ^ ^lost which I have spent for thee, for
thee, Yet one the ground must be which you shall ^ ^proue, That descant on my
love. That descant on my love, That descant on my ^ ^loue, That descant on my
love. ^

XVII. BASSVS Primus.
^WEe yet agree, but shall be straight ways out, Thy ^BASSVS secundus.
^Passions are so harsh and strange to me, That when the concord's perfect I
may doubt, ^ ^The time is lost which I have spent for thee, Yet one the ground
must be, which you shall prove, Can ^ ^beare all parts that descant on my love,
That descant on my love, * That ^ ^descant on my love. ^

XVIII. CANTVS.
^FLy swift my thoughts, pos- sessemy Mi- stris ^Fly swift my thoughts, pos-
sesse my Mi- stris ^heare, And as you find her love plead my de- sert, If she
be ^heart, my Mistrisse heart, And as you find her love plead my de- sert, If
she be ^somewhat wayward happy my de- sires, A lit- tle coyness does but blow
men's fires, But ^somewhat wayward happy my desires, A lit- tle coyness does
but blow men's fires, But will ^will she needs forbid the baines I crave, Re-
tire, re- tire, and be buried in your Masters grave. ^she needs forbid the
baines I crave, Re- tire and be buried in your Masters grave.
