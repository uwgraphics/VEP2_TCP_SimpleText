THE RELATION OF the Right Honorable the Lord De-La-Warre, Lord Governor and
Captain General of the Colonie, planted in VIRGINEA.



LONDON Printed by William Hall, for William Welbie, dwelling in Paul's
Church-yeard at the Sign of the Swan. 1611.

A SHORT RElation made by the Lord De-La-Warre, to the Lords and others of the
Counsel of Virginea, touching his unexpected return home, and afterward
delivered to the general Assembly of the said Company, at a Court holden the
twenty five of June, 1611.
Published by authority of the said Counsel.
My Lords, etc.
BEing now by accident returned from my Charge at Virginea, contrary either to
my own desire, or other men's expectations, who spare not to censure me, in
point of duty, and to discourse and question the reason, though they apprehend
not the true cause of my return, I am forced, (out of willingness to satisfy
every man) to deliver unto your Lordships, and the rest of this Assembly,
briefly, (but truly) in what state I have lived, ever since my arrival to
the Colonie; what has been the just occasion of my sudden departure thence;
and in what terms I have left the same: The rather because I perceive, that
since my coming into England, such a coldness and irresolution is bred, in
many of the Adventurers, that some of them seek to withdraw those paime^ts,
which they have subscribed toward the Charge of the Plantation, and by which
that Action must be supported and maintained; making this my return, the
color of their needless backwardnes and unjust protraction. Which, that you
may the better understand, I must inform your Lordships, that presently after
my arriual in James Town, I was welcomed by a hot and violent Ague, which
held me a time, till by the advice of my Physician, Doctor Laurence Bohun, (by
blood letting) I was recovered, as in my first Letters by Sir Thomas Gates I
have informed you. That disease had not long left me, til (within three weeks
after I had gotten a little strength) I began to be distempered with other
grievous sicknesses, which successively and severally assailed me: for besides
a relapse into the former disease, which with much more violence held me more
then a month, and brought me to great weakness, the Flux surprised me, and
kept me many days; then the Crampe assaulted my weak body, with strong pains;
and afterward the Gout (with which I had heretofore been sometime troubled)
afflicted me in such sort, that making my body through weakness unable to
stir, or to use any manner of exercise, drew upon me the disease called the
Scuruy; which though in others it be a sickness of slothfulness, yet was in
me an effect of weakness, which never left me, till I was upon the point to
leave the world.

These several maladies and calamities, I am the more desirous to
particularise unto your Lordships (although they were too notorious to the
whole Colonie) lest any man should misdeeme that under the general name and
common excuse of sickness, I went about to cloak either sloth, or fear, or any
other base apprehension, unworthy the high and Honorable charge, which you had
entrusted to my Fidelity.

In these extremities I resolved to consult my friends, who (finding Nature
spent in me, and my body almost consumed, my pains likewise daily increasing)
gave me advise to prefer a hopeful recovery, before an assured ruin, which
must necessarily have ensued, had I lived, but twenty days longer, in
Virginia: wanting at that instant, both food and Physic, fit to remedy such
extraordinary diseases, and restore that strength so desperately decayed.

VVhereupon, after a long consultation held, I resolved by general consent and
persuasion, to ship my self for Meuis, an Island in the West Indies, famous
for wholesome Bathes, there to try what help the Heavenly Providence would
afford me, by the benefit of the hot Bath: But GOD, who guides all things,
according to his good will and pleasure, so provided, that after we had sailed
an hundred Leagues, we met with Southerly winds which forced me to change my
purpose, (my body being altogether unable to endure the tediousness of a long
voyage) and so stern my course for the VVestern Islands, which I no sooner
recovered, then I found help for my health, and my sickness assuaged, by
means of fresh diet, and especially of Orenges and Lemonds, an undoubted
remedy and medicine for that disease, which lastly, and so long, had afflicted
me: which ease as soon as I found, I resolved (although my body remained
still feeble and weak, to return back to my charge in Virginia again, but I
was advised not to hazard my self before I had perfectly recovered my
strength, which by counsel I was persuaded to seek in the natural Air of my
Country, and so I came for England. In which Accident, I doubt not but men of
reason, and of judgment will imagine, there would more danger and prejudice
have happened by my death there, then I hope can do by my return

In the next place, I am to give account in what estate I left the Collony for
government in my absence. It may please your Lordships therefore to understand,
that upon my departure thence, I made choice of Captain George Pearcie, (a
Gentleman of honor and resolution, and of no small experience in that place,
to remain Deputy Governor, until the coming of the Marshall Sir Thomas
Dale, whose Commission was likewise to be determined, upon the arrival of Sir
Thomas Gates, according to the intent and order of your Lordships, and the
Council here.

The number of men I left there, were upward of two hundred, the most in
health, and provided of at least ten months victuals, in their storehouse,
(which is daily issued unto them) besides other helps in the Country, lately
found out by Captain Argoll by trading with petty Kings in those parts, who
for a small return of a piece of Iron, Copper, etc. have consented to trucke
great quantities of Corn, and willingly embrace the intercourse of Traffic,
showing unto our people certain signs of amity and affection.

And for the better strengthening and securing of the Collony, in the time of
my weakness there, I took order for the building of three several Forts, two
of which are seated near Point Comfort, to which adioyneth a large Circuit of
ground, open, and fit for Corn: the third Fort is at the Falls, upon an Island
environed also with Corn ground. These are not all manned, for I wanted the
commodity of Boats, having but two, and one Bardge, in all the Country,
which has been cause that our fishing has been (in some sort) hindered, for
want of those provisions, which easily will be remedied when we can gain
sufficient men to be employed about those businesses, which in Virginia I found
not: but since meeting with Sir Thomas Gates at the Cowes near Portsmouth (to
whom I gave a particular account of all my proceedings, and of the present
estate of the Collony as I left it) I understood those wants are supplied in
his Fleet.

The Country is wonderful fertile and very rich, and makes good whatsoever
heretofore has been reported of it, the Cattle already there, are much
increased, and thrive exceedingly with the pasture of that Country: The Kine
all this last VVinter, though the ground was covered most with Snow, and the
season sharp, lived without other feeding then the grass they found, with
which they prospered well, and many of them ready to fall with Calue: Milk
being a great nourishment and refreshing to our people, serving also (in
occasion) as well for Physic as for food, so that it is no way to be doubted,
but when it shall please God that Sir Thomas Dale, and Sir Thomas Gates, shall
arrive in Virginia with their extraordinary supply of one hundred Kine, and two
hundred Swine, besides store of all manner of other provisions for the
sustenance and maintenance of the Collony, there will appear that success in
the Action as shall give no man cause of distrust that has already adventured,
but encourage every good mind to further so worthy a work, as will redound
both to the Glory of GOD, to the Credit of our Nation, and to the Comfort of
all those that have been Instruments in the furthering of it.

The last discovery, during my continual sickness, was by Captain Argoll,
who has found a trade with Patamack (a King as great as Powhatan, who still
remains our enemy, though not able to do us hurt.) This is in a goodly River
called Patomack, upon the borders whereof there are grown the goodliest Trees
for Masts, that may be found elsewhere in the World: Hemp better then
English, growing wild in abundance: Mines of Antimonie and Lead,

There is also found without our Bay to the Northward an excellent fishing
Bancke for Codde, and Ling, as good as can be eaten, and of a kind that will
keep a whole year, in Ships hold, with little care; a trial whereof I now
have brought over with me. Other Islands there are upon our Coasts, that do
promise rich merchandise, and will further exceedingly the establishing of the
Plantation, by supply of many helps, and will speedily afford a return of
many vvorthie Commodities.

I have left much ground in part manured to receive Corn, having caused it the
last VVinter to be sowed for roots, with which our people were greatly
relieved.

There are many Vines planted in diverse places, and do prosper well, there is
no want of any thing, if the action can be vpheld with constancy and
resolution.

Lastly, concerning my self, and my course, though the World may imagine that
this Country and Climate, will (by that which I have suffered beyond any
other of that Plantation) ill agree, with the state of my body, yet I am so
far from shrinking or giving over this honorable enterprise, as that I am
vvilling and ready to lay all I am worth upon the adventure of the Action,
rather then so Honorable a work should fail, and to return with all the
convenient expedition I may, beseeching your Lordships, and the rest, not only
to excuse my former wants, happened by the Almighty hand: but to second my
resolutions with your friendly endeavors: that both the State may receive
Honor, your selves Profit, and I future Comfort, by being employed (though but
as a weak Instrument) in so great an Action.

And thus having plainly, truly, and briefly, delivered the cause of my
return, with the state of our affairs, as we now stand, I hope every
worthy and indifferent hearer, will by comparing my present resolution of
return, with the necessity of my coming home, rest satisfied with this true
and short Declaration.

FINIS.
